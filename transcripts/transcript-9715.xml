STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MVP<br />
THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF INDONESIA'S INDEPENDENCE<br />
Fifty years ago, in the same week in which victory was finally achieved in the Pacific<br />
war, the leaders of Indonesia's nationalist movement proclaimed their country's<br />
independence from the Dutch.<br />
That declaration on 17 August 1945 by Sukarno and Mohammned Hatta set in train the<br />
momentous events which created the modern Indonesian state and transformed our<br />
region. On behalf of the Australian Government and people I am very happy to offer the<br />
Government and people of Indonesia our warmest congratulations on the<br />
anniversary of this historic event.<br />
Few developments since the end of the Second World War have had such beneficial<br />
strategic and political consequences for Australia as Indonesia's development as a<br />
united and increasingly prosperous country.<br />
In its half-century of independence, Indonesia has faced huge nation building<br />
challenges. [ t has had to mould a unified nation and create a modern and outwardlooking<br />
economy in a diverse archipelago comprising a vast number of different<br />
cultures, languages, religions and ethnic groups.<br />
Its population of 190 million is now the fourth largest of any country in the world.<br />
In the face of these challenges, the accomplishments of the Indonesian people have<br />
been remarkable.<br />
Under the New Order Government of President Soeharto, the number of Indonesians<br />
living below the poverty line has fallen from 60 per cent of the population to 13 per<br />
cent in 1994. By the end of the century it is expected to fall to 6 per cent. Infant<br />
mortality has more than halved over the past 25 years and life expectancy has risen by<br />
17 years. In 1960 39 per cent of Indonesians were literate; now more than 80 per cent<br />
are. Each year the Indonesian economy has been growing at around 6 per cent. It is<br />
expected to continue to grow at this rate for the rest of the century. </p>
<p>Indonesia has also had an important influence in the wider international community.<br />
The Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries in 1955 led to the<br />
establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement. Indonesia has been a core member of<br />
ASEAN. And at the Bogor conference of APEC leaders last year under President<br />
Soeharto's chairmanship, the framework was set in place for economic growth in the<br />
Asia Pacific region into the 2 1st century.<br />
These developments have formed the foundation for the growing economic partnership<br />
between Australia and Indonesia, which has hugze, untapped potential for both our<br />
countries. Australia's merchandise exports to Indonesia were worth more than $ 2 billion in 1994<br />
and more than 300 AustraX'..-companies now have a presence there.<br />
But Indonesia's independence struggle was also important to Australia in another way.<br />
Our policy response to the developments to our north our decision to support the<br />
new national leadership and to help marshal international support for Indonesian<br />
independence rather than simply to acquiesce in the post-war return of the colonial<br />
system marked a turning point in the development of an independent Australian<br />
foreign policy.<br />
Australia's choice reflected the realities of our geography and the realisation that the<br />
aspirations of the people in this region mattered to Australia.<br />
Australians can take pride in the contributions this country made at that time through<br />
public support for the struggle, including Trade Union blackbans on shipping, and the<br />
Government's decision to bring the struggle to the attention of the United Nations and<br />
our key role as advocate of Indonesia on the Committee of Good Offices.<br />
Far-sighted individuals such as the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, the Foreign Minister,<br />
Dr Evatt, Sir Richard Kirby, Mr John Burton, Professor W McMahon Ball and Mr<br />
Tom Critchley, as well as many private individuals and trade unions like the Waterside<br />
Workers' Federation helped to secure the cause of Indonesian independence and, in<br />
doing so, shaped a new direction for Australian foreign policy.<br />
I have often said before that no country is more important to Australia than Indonesia.<br />
The future of our two countries is inextricably linked.<br />
Year by year the network of government to government and people to people<br />
contacts between us has been growing in strength and depth. I am delighted with the<br />
rapid increase in Indonesian students and tourists coming to Australia. One of the<br />
Australian Government's major policy aims is to ensure that this strong partnership<br />
between us continues to develop and that it becomes a source of stability and<br />
prosperity for our whole region over the next fifty years.<br />
For that reason, I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government has decided<br />
to mark the 50th anniversary of Indonesian's independence by establishing a prestigious<br />
new scholarship scheme to be called the Australia-Indonesia Merdeka Fellowships. </p>
<p>These will be mid-career awards directed at future leaders in each country from across<br />
a wide range of professions and disciplines.<br />
It is our hope that over time these fellowships will help consolidate in each country a<br />
community of people who share common experiences and a common vision of our<br />
bilateral relationship.<br />
It is my very great pleasure on Australia's behalf to congratulate Indonesia and its<br />
people on the achievements of fifty years of independence.<br />
CANBERRA 16 August 1995 </p>
