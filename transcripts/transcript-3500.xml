EMBARGO: 8.00 PM<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINISTER BY FOUR CORNERS ( AA' 11TO3ADI1<br />
NOVEMBER 1974<br />
HOGAN: Prime Minister, after two years in office, what single<br />
act or piece of legislation do you think is the Labor Governments<br />
probdest achievement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The two pieces, I would think, would be the<br />
Grants Commission which has made it possible to do things for<br />
the Capitals and the big provincial cities, and the Schools<br />
Commission, which has given people a good start at school.<br />
HOGAN: On the other hand, what do you think are Labor's<br />
biggest disappointments and failures?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The fact that we have come to office at a<br />
time of world-wide inflation.<br />
HOGAN: Why is that disappointing to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was something that nobody expected to be so<br />
serious and it is something where, of course, every country<br />
like us all the trading countries, all the industrialised<br />
countries, the-whole of: the world is embroiled at the one time;<br />
all with the same problems and all infecting each other.<br />
HOGAN: Is there any need though, for Australia'Is rate of<br />
inflation to be as high as it is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's probably inevitable. Everybody has COPPedIit.<br />
I mean, two years ago there wasn't a single western country<br />
which would have expected to have the problems of inflation<br />
and Lnemployment which every one of them is experienrinqj tow.<br />
HOGAN: YL we are, say, ahead of tvest Germany, aren't in the<br />
inflation rc.-e and we are not, like they are, dependent on<br />
imported oil or minerals, where to a certain extent we are<br />
self-sufficient in those areas. Could we hope that ouinflation<br />
rate could be made to be :-little lower, do ,,' ou<br />
think by government n'anagement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope we can get it down. We are trying evcry.<br />
meai., we have; we examine what every other country is doing.<br />
West ' Zermany's unemployment, of course, is much w, -se D~ ii-s<br />
about twice as bad as ours in percentage termTS. _. eir inflatio.:<br />
is not as bad as ours. But there again, two years ago i.-i<br />
West Germc--y. the unemployment and inflation that they ha" 1<br />
would have absolutely incredible and in-tolerable. ' Chat<br />
we all have it.<br />
HOGAN: Would it be fair to say though, that inflation has to<br />
a certain extent robbed the average Australian of t1l. benafifor<br />
the alleged benefits of the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: of some of the benefits, but nevertheless the<br />
average incomes in Australia have gone up much more in the las'<br />
two years the years that we have been in than have prices.<br />
The incomes have gone up over those two years, I think, by<br />
about 7 per cent more than the prices. So on balance, people<br />
are all better off in Australia but not as much better off as<br />
we had hoped. That is, just going on incomes and prices. </p>
<p>But where we have made a very great difference is in provi li<br />
things free, at public expense, for everybody. Govui: nacr<br />
services have Lb-een very greatly improved as a resuli of t wc<br />
have done.<br />
HOGAN: Has that in itself been a cause of the inflation do<br />
you think?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Only infinitesimally. It might have had some,<br />
but the point is that if we had done none of those things, if we<br />
had abandoned all our proposals for making better use of our<br />
resources or better opportunities for our citizens, we would still<br />
have had a rate of inflation which, a couple of years ago, would<br />
have been regarded as incredible and intolerable. It is no<br />
solution, say, to just postpone our program.<br />
HOGAN: Yet it would seem that many people in Australia today<br />
think that the rate is incredible and intolerable. A poll this<br />
week, for example, suggested that 7 out of every 10 Australians<br />
don't think you have been effective in controlling inflation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we haven't been able to keep it down as<br />
we would have liked. But what I think Australians in general<br />
realise is that there in no Head of Government no government<br />
anywhere in the western world which has what we would have<br />
regarded in the past as a tolerable record in this regard;<br />
all of us.<br />
HOGAN: You have made some Cabinet changes in recent weeks or<br />
they are to take place shortly.<br />
PRIMt. MINISTER: One, I have made one change in over a year.<br />
HOGAN: 2. fairly important one. Do you think that this change,<br />
the rep];, ' ent of Mr Crean by Dr Cairns would have a dramatic<br />
effect on ii. lation or by cutting the rate of inflation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't say that anything has a c<br />
No, I don't say that, and I don't wc., c to givw any imprcss.<br />
that what has been happening in Australia can he uickly cuc:<br />
or can be cured in isolation. We are too big a t'ding country<br />
proportionally we are one of the most dependent of all countries<br />
on t;, ade we just can't isolate ourselves. T1.: e won'" h,<br />
anyt. i , g dramatic but I do believe that there w. 1-' ae an<br />
improv. mc t.<br />
HOGAN: i{ a-you any cause now to regret; the h-ndli: 2g of E C:<br />
reshuffle, ti,. lismissal of Mr Crean from the Treasury?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Do ynu mind if I use my terms: exchanging<br />
the portfolios that Dr Cait.. f and Mr Crean had. T would h-e<br />
liked it to have happened more quickly but the news . tckc: r out<br />
when Dr Cairns was overseas and thej . vhen he came bac, tkL.<br />
proprieties dictated that I should discuss it with the Gr. vernor<br />
General, and he was in Tasmania for a couple of days, so T couldn't.<br />
do that.<br />
HOGAN: Was it not possible in that period and it was a very<br />
long period while the leaks continued that Mr Crean may go: were<br />
you yourself responsible for any of those leaks? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: None whatever and no-one associated with<br />
There was no atom of benefit for iiie in those leaks occu--ng.<br />
None whatever.<br />
HOGAN: Do you think that Mr Crean was treated badly by the<br />
affair?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the media were quite cruel to him.<br />
HOGAN: In a sense, though, could you have taken the pressure<br />
off by making some sort of statement in that long period....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I will not do it. I will not respond to<br />
questions whether somebody is going to have some appointment or<br />
if I am going to make changes. Once I yield on that I will<br />
be asked every day whether somebody is going to have another<br />
position. HOGAN: Do you think it appears in restrospect that Mr Crean<br />
has taken the blame for the management of the economy which<br />
perhaps should have been shared by the entire Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course, any blame that there is, any credit<br />
that there is, is shared by us all. And Mr Crean must accept it:<br />
any blame, his share; he is entitled to credit, any credit.<br />
There is no suggestion whatever that Mr Crean has not acted as<br />
the Government decided.<br />
HOGAN: Will you yourself now be taking a more active role in<br />
control of the economy? There is some speculation that you<br />
have been sitting back, letting other ministers have a stronger<br />
say in the economy than yourself.<br />
PRIME Y". VTSTER: I'll be more directly involved, yes.<br />
HOGAN: In h-t way?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll be more fully and regularly brief ed<br />
I have taken steps to see that statistics and ii. dices ares<br />
comprehensively compiled and more promptly analysed.<br />
HOGAN: After two years in Government do you think Lhat it is<br />
a ki: late to be making those changes, could yoai have n ot seen<br />
that arlier?<br />
PRIME AINISTER: In retrospect that is right. Nevertheics<br />
our stat.. -~ al information, our assessments, have not b,', en<br />
adequate in tralia. You can blame us for the last tuo ye'<br />
You can'tC blame for 25 years before that.<br />
HOGAN: But we can blame you for the last two years?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In retrospect, obviously. It could have been<br />
done quicker: Mr McMahon is now saying that too. But he didn't<br />
do it when he was Prime Minister. We are all wiser now.<br />
HOGAN: One thing that the Cabinet exchange highlights was perhaps<br />
the difficulty you have in selecting ministers. Would you like<br />
to see any change in the system whereby the Labor Party elects<br />
its Cabinet? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, none whatever. I suport , his system -nd<br />
I continue to support it. I believe that the best way get<br />
harmony in a political party is for all members of thr olitical<br />
party to have their say in determining who will nold cf7ice in it.<br />
I've always supported that and I will continue to support it.<br />
HOGAN: Does it mean that perhaps there are young and able men<br />
in the Labor Party who you aren't able to elect to Cabinet because<br />
of the Caucus decision as to how Cabinet is elected?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Maybe. I don't, on the other hand, suggest that<br />
any political leader should be able to make his own personal<br />
and maybe capricious choice. I have influence in these things,<br />
naturally, but I am happy with the system. I don't want anybody<br />
to have the impression that I would change that system. I would<br />
not change that system. I believe that the whole of the Party<br />
that is all the Labor members of Parliament, the Caucus should<br />
have an equal say in determining who will be the Ministers and<br />
that the leader the Prime Minister should have the<br />
responsibilities of saying what portfolio each Minister should<br />
have. HOGAN: Prime Minister the level of unemployment in Australia is<br />
now at its highest since the depression. Is that tolerable under<br />
a Labor Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't think it is tolerable under any<br />
government and we have taken steps to reverse that.<br />
HOGAN: Is the situation going to get worse before it gets better?<br />
' RIME MINISTER: In the next couple of months it will probably get<br />
wo e. This is, of course, the time of the year when the<br />
nuiler of people seeking jobs is always the greatest. So the<br />
figure, will not look good.<br />
HOGAN; h, uch worse could it get?<br />
' PRIME MINISTER: I won't speculate.<br />
HOGAN: Could it<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The statistics frankly are not cJoc-enough ñ or<br />
me to speculate. The statistics tlat can. e o; it thtree weeks ago<br />
cEL' tit everybody by surprise, everybody. Now may b, a<br />
def.ø icy in the statistics.<br />
HOGAN: '" at can be rectified, do you think?<br />
PRIME MINISTEi. I hope so. I am certainly haviig this exaxm-Li<br />
The statistics avi; 1a!,. ' o the Government, the official<br />
. statistics in matters lix. inemployment and liquidity, h; ve<br />
been adequate and I am taki. I-to see that tl e<br />
are improved. About four weeks a. ook similar &amp;: tac<br />
that statistics on imports were improved.<br />
HOGAN: Are you worried about the reaction of the trade union<br />
movement to the unemployment situation? Mr Hawke . this week L. is<br />
been saying that he will be speaking to you next week about the<br />
need for stronger measures to prevent unemployment. </p>
<p>PRIME MTNISTER: I regard the rEac: iun of the tradu uuio;' Lo<br />
unemployment as completely predict&amp; ble and completecy p. . er.<br />
Some of the suggestions that the trade union moveraent makes<br />
or some sections of it, I believe, are ill-founde,:.<br />
HOGAN: Could unemployment bring down the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It could bring down any government. There is<br />
no Government in the Western world which is secure; none whatever.<br />
HOGAN: Are you worried that it could bring down your Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have to be worried about this but I am quite<br />
satisfied that at an election I would win.<br />
HOGAN: Do you see your change in tariff policy or import quotas<br />
as likely to affect the unemployment situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They have a marginal effect. They have more than<br />
a marginal effect in some industries. But it is nonsense to<br />
suggest that the unemployment in Australia has been caused by<br />
our more rational approach to protection. That might have affected<br />
some industries, but it is garbage to say that it has been<br />
responsible for the unemployment. Some trade unionists have said<br />
this; some of them, worse still, have said it in collaboration<br />
with employers, including overseas companies. Their attitude<br />
they are entitled to express it but it is my duty to correct<br />
them when they exaggerate or distort the position. The unemployment<br />
in Australia is primarily due now to the fact that people are<br />
pricing themselves out of jobs.<br />
HOGAN: They are pricing themselves out of jobs.<br />
PRIME M: NISTER: Yes, the people can't afford employers can't<br />
afford employ people at the rate of increase in wages whJ,'-<br />
is taking this year.<br />
HOGAN: Well this is perhaps something that The trade uni<br />
movement might be expected to take: an active role in in<br />
restraint. Do you s-' e the need for wage restraint?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly I do.<br />
HOCA Are you getting all the co-operation that ln-i eei from<br />
the t. ad! unions in that area?<br />
PRIME MINY-TPR: We are getting a great deal of co-operac-ion<br />
and this is, course,. one of the things which we regularly<br />
discuss. Any mL. tings that I have with Mr Hawke are always<br />
well publicised. I have -etings with a very great number of<br />
people too; they aren't p. cised. But obviously this is<br />
something which Mr Hawke and -r and some othi--fic&gt;.<br />
from time to time, of the ACTU discu s with me and seniior colñ ø s<br />
and we believe that we are likely to secure restraint. The way<br />
we are doing it, of course, is by putting to the Arbitration<br />
Commission that it should take into account the very great tax<br />
reductions which we aremkin._ and that it should regard those<br />
tax deductions as compensation for any increase in prices, in<br />
the present quarter. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
HOGAN: And yet only this week it would appear from newF~ aper<br />
reports that you personally approved an increase of 24 per cent<br />
in pilots' salaries.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't. The attitude that I support is that<br />
employers, including TAA, should be able to pass on to their<br />
customers any increases due to increases in salaries which have<br />
been made in Industrial Awards. Now anything that employers,<br />
including TAA, pay above awards, they have to take out of their<br />
profits. HOGAN: But was that not a inflationary settlement, an increase<br />
of 24 per cent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think so. I don't think TAA should have done<br />
it but I don't believe that a Government or any Minister can<br />
effectively take over the day-to-day running of something such<br />
as TAA or Qantas or the Commonwealth Bank: any of these<br />
Government enterprises.<br />
HOGAN: Are you in effect saying that you are powerless to stop<br />
., inflationary wage increases like that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have taken action by submissions to the Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal to ask them not to approve price increases<br />
which are due to over-award wage settlements and my Minister<br />
for Transport, Mr Jones, has made it plain that TAA and Ansett<br />
cannot pass on to people flying by air the settlements which<br />
they have made in excess of what Mr Justice Coldham awarded.<br />
S HOAN: To take another area, Prime Minister, and that's the<br />
rural sector of the economy. The man on the land claims that<br />
he is being deprived socially and economically by the Labor<br />
Govern t. Have you any sympathy with that point of view?<br />
PRIME MINIS. 7_: The point of view is incorrect. The way t,<br />
some people distort what the Government has done, I car,<br />
many people in the country having th. at view. The fact i.<br />
there is better hope now for most people whc live in tht.. Lr.<br />
and most of them lie in country towns than * Wr, Defore. Life<br />
in country towns will be very much ow'e varied and attractive<br />
thai it has ever been this century, as a resullt of initoaLives<br />
by i Government. Now what we have d'one is, , e rnted t) s,<br />
tha. V'-. re governments give assistance through i -:, ar. ion<br />
or thioagh subsidies for primary production, naC-t that 2: sis,.&gt;-<br />
goes * o the people who need it most. Secondly, we wantri ;-o<br />
ensure , here primary producers produce more than Austra'<br />
themselves ca.. consume, they are able to rely on long-term t<br />
agreements with other cr-lntries. There has never been a govern'.<br />
which has achieved so ma. trade agreements with other countr-c..<br />
as my Government.<br />
HOGAN: We have talked about the worker, we have talked dbout<br />
the man on the land, what about the businessman? What . as he<br />
got to thank Labor for for the last two years?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He knows that the Government operates very much<br />
more openly than previous Governments. That if he wants some<br />
benefit from a Government, then he can make out a case and it will<br />
ibe looked at and the reasons given. There is no behind-the-door or </p>
<p>-7-<br />
under-the-counter deals. We have stated our principles, we have<br />
established bodies to report on all these things. And business<br />
people have shown their respect at least for the way we have gone<br />
about things.<br />
HOGAN: If not enthusiasm?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's right. But there have never been so<br />
many businessmen who have been willing to advise a Federal<br />
Government, as there have been willing to advise my Government.<br />
And they have been willing to do it because they realise that<br />
whether they agree with us or not, whether their views which we<br />
have sought are palatable to us or not, those views will be<br />
made public and the public will know what the advice is. And<br />
. usually, usually we accept that advice.<br />
HOGAN: Are you aware of real hostility from the business<br />
community to the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I imagine that I would know most of the<br />
important, responsible businessmen in Australia and I think<br />
they realise that they can express their views to me and I<br />
will welcome those views and our personal relations are perfectly<br />
cordial. Now what I would like to put is that you can't quote<br />
any substantial experienced responsible business leader, any<br />
managing director or chairman of directors of any substantial<br />
enterprise, any general manager or chairman of directors....<br />
HOGAN: Perhaps the Chairman of Ampol would disagree with you<br />
about the operation of the Prices Justification Tribunal?<br />
PRIME AINISTER: I don't remember him saying anything about it.<br />
But I v. iJ be dining with him tonight. I have known him for<br />
many year-', I respect him and as far as I can see, he respects<br />
me. But have very good relations. The fact is, you don't<br />
get expeiiehi -d or substantial leaders of the business commrunity.<br />
directors of c .? anies, general managers of companies who have<br />
gone on public record in criticism of my Government.<br />
HOGAN: Turning to the immediate evens of tniz week, Prime ster,<br />
we have seen a struggi.. for the leadership of the Liberal Party.<br />
Would you have preferred to have seen Mr Fraser win that battle?<br />
PRIM! INISTER: It doesn't help any of the caindida. es and<br />
Mr Sne and Mr Fraser are not the only candidate, for the<br />
leadersh. of the Liberal Party if I say whom L * ould like tc<br />
see there. There are some people whom I would like to set . herc<br />
from the na. L oolitical point of view, ones that wouldn'. coev<br />
successfully, s_ with fije. There are others<br />
HOGAN: Do you think Mr Se. competes successfully with you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't th: But there are rth s<br />
who I would like to see there in the contingency of a c'anqe ol<br />
Government. It doesn't help. I have on one or two occasions<br />
in the past suggested whom I thought to be the best alternatives<br />
on that side of politics and it embarrasses the people I have<br />
named and of course, they feel bound to react to disprove it or<br />
to disprove my kind words.<br />
HOGAN: You have been in power now for two years, will you still<br />
have the same job in two years? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe so.<br />
HOGAN: We will have to wait to see what the electors have to<br />
say about that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, they might not have the opportunity in two<br />
years. I expect two and a half years and I think they will<br />
re-elect me.<br />
HOGAN: Thank you Prime Minister.<br />
