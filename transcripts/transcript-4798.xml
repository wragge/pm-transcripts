PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 27 AUGUST l978<br />
EL1ECTURATE TALK<br />
The rank and file members of the Australian Telecommunications<br />
Employees Association are on tihe eve of a momentus decision.<br />
It's a decision that will touch their own lives, and the lives<br />
of their families. It is a decision that will affect every<br />
Australian. It must be weighed with care, calm and reason.<br />
The members of this union have a serious responsibility to<br />
Australia. They work in an utterly vital service industry<br />
which is at the heart of this nation's life.<br />
Australia needs their skills. There is no denying that.<br />
But the men must remember that they need their employer,<br />
Telecom, for their jobs and their security.<br />
It is clear they are unlikely to find other jobs as well<br />
paid and as secure for which they are specially trained<br />
and qualified.<br />
This point about job security is important. I suspect the general<br />
public is not aware that Telecom has given a cast-iron<br />
guarantee to the union membership against any retrenchment<br />
as a result of technological change. What other industry, what<br />
other employer has achieved that for its own employees.<br />
The issues in this dispute have been widely canvassed. The<br />
central issue about loss of jobs through technological advance<br />
is important. it is of concern to this union, every other<br />
union and to the Government.<br />
Commissioner Clarkson recognized this point in his six-point<br />
peace proposal that the union rejected. His proposal involved<br />
independent assessment, trial period and full and proper<br />
consultation with the union. I would have thought that was<br />
a fair deal something reasonable and worth discussing.<br />
This weekend, Mr. Street called the National Labour Consultative<br />
Council to inform them of the Government's concern and advise<br />
them of the state of the telecommunications network in Australia.<br />
The Government wanted to leave no doubt that if the men were to<br />
decide to continue thie ban then the Government would be<br />
compelled to use whatever powers it has under the law.<br />
Following this briefing by Mr. Street, the National Labour<br />
Consultative Council unanimously decided that the parties<br />
the ATEA and Telecom together with the other peak councils,<br />
should enter into discussions in an attempt to resolve the<br />
dispute using Commissioner Clarkson' s six-point formula as a basis.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The fact that these discussions are continuing is a<br />
hopeful sign. All Australians hope it will lead to the<br />
men eventually being able to return to work.<br />
What seems to have been forgotten in this particular dispute<br />
is that we would not have a telecommunications industry at<br />
all without the advance of technology.<br />
The men would not have had their skilled and secure jobs<br />
without technology a technology that will lead to improved<br />
services and lower costs to the consumer.<br />
The argument that this union has with its employer has been<br />
heard before Australia's arbitration system. Regrettably,<br />
the union's executive has turned its back on the umpires<br />
decision. Commissioner Clarkson has proposed three separate settlements<br />
to this dispute. Telecom accepted each of these proposals<br />
in principle. But the Union Executive has blocked every<br />
attempt to negotiate a settlement. The Federal Executive<br />
has thumbed its nose at Australia's long-standing system of<br />
arbitration it has thumbed its nose at the Australian people.<br />
I have made the Government's position plain. We fully support<br />
the decisions taken by Telecom, which has been reasonable in<br />
a most difficult situation. Telecom has fully supported<br />
commissioner Clarkson's proposals for settlement. We fully<br />
support Telecom's policy of no work, no pay.<br />
Some 3,500 employees are already off pay because they have<br />
refused to do the work they are paid for. The number will<br />
inevitably increase significantly. Wages are now being lost<br />
at the rate of $ 1.6 million a fortnight. So the hardship<br />
on ATEA members alone is considerable and is bound to increase.<br />
That pay is lost for all time. It will not be made good as<br />
part of the settlement.<br />
The Government also endorses the decision of Telecom to<br />
commence deregistration proceedings against the union.<br />
In a statement to Parliament on Thursday night, I said the<br />
Commonwealth had a range of legal powers available to it if members<br />
of the union do not accept their responsibility to the<br />
community. That position remains.<br />
It is now time for the rank and file membership to take stock.<br />
It is time for the men to look ahead, seriously, at the<br />
consequences of a continuation of this ban. It is time for<br />
the men to think of the families in isolated areas cut of f from<br />
the cities, from suppliers, from essential services.<br />
What would happen if a Cyclone Tracey struck a northern outpost,<br />
or a flood or fire swept through a tiny country town or<br />
settlement? How wouid the innocent residents call for help?<br />
How couldthey mobilise forces to save life and stock? / 13 </p>
<p>3<br />
It's time for the men to think of Australians cut off from<br />
police services, from hospitals, from doctors cut off<br />
from help. It's time to face these consequences because<br />
this is what faces Australia.<br />
I have made the point before about the fair-mindedness and<br />
commonsense of Australia's working men and women. Now is the<br />
time for the rank and file members of this union to<br />
demonstrate those qualities.<br />
I am sure the wives and families of the men understand that<br />
the longer the dispute goes on the miaore wages will be lost,<br />
and the more their personal and family position will be<br />
prejudiced. The Government has no option but to stand firm<br />
in this matter. We are completely resolute.<br />
Whatever the harm, whatever the difficulty the continued<br />
deterioration of communication services causes in Australia<br />
the ultimate harm in caving in to minority blackmail would<br />
be much greater.<br />
I look to the men voting on their Executive's decision to<br />
think of their families, to think of their friends and<br />
to think of all Australians. I call on them to allow the<br />
process of arbitration to work. 000---</p>
