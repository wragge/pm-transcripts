PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE, PERTH, 5 JANUARY 1976<br />
2UESTION: Why was it necessary for the Government to issue an undertaking<br />
by Mr Lynch that Australia won't devalue?<br />
? RIME MINISTER:-Well there have been rumours to this effect and we wanted<br />
to make it quite certain that they remained rumours, that people<br />
would put that sort of attitude well behind them. And the<br />
statement the Treasurer made was a strong, a forthright statement;<br />
it had been fully discussed, not only with myself but also with<br />
Mr Anthony.<br />
NESTION:, Are you very concerned with the drop in Australia's international<br />
reserves?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I would think that whatever movements that did take<br />
place were' temporary movements and speculative movements.<br />
There had-been a good deal of talk this in te ne-wt spapers<br />
as you kn4, and we felt it was time, and our advisers felt it<br />
was time, for the Treasurer to make the sort of statement that he did.<br />
! UESTION: It's aniunusual occurrence to make such a statement?<br />
' RIME MINISTER: No, not in the circumstances that prevailed, no.<br />
, UESTION: Mr Fraser what consideration is given to the Country Party<br />
in the ! decision not to devalue.<br />
RIME MINISTER: Well the Government is one Government, It is not two<br />
separate Parties and I've never known an issue in which there has<br />
been a division between, on Party lines, in any Cabinet discussion. </p>
<p>This matter was fully discussed by the Treasurer with myself<br />
and with Mr Anthony. I had a number of discussions with Mr Anthony<br />
in relation to it. We all in complete agreement with the statement.<br />
UESTION: There have been suggestions that the Young Liberal Movement<br />
will be pushing for a complete split with the Country Party.<br />
Will you be discussing this with them at all today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I wouldn't be interested in discussing that with anyone,<br />
and would have no intention of doing so. There is a coalition<br />
that worked very well in Opposition, and it will work very well in<br />
Government and it will work for the advantage of all Australians.<br />
And any suggestions of anything else is just so much nonsense.<br />
People have said that because there is a large majority<br />
in the House of Representatives a coalition is not needed.<br />
Well the people that say that are talking nonsense.--Australia<br />
needs it and there is a firm partnership between the two Parties,<br />
, and between Mr Anthony and-myself. That is going to continue.<br />
' I hope for a long while and for Australia's-advantage.<br />
SUESTION: But if the Young Liberals passed a resolution that all Liberals<br />
should stand against all Country Party candidates would you...<br />
RIME MINISTER: i Oh, look, some States have different views about how they<br />
handle local electoral matters. What I'm talking about is the<br />
coalition in Canberra and that is firm, it is absolute and<br />
nothing will shake it. </p>
<p>QUESTION: You're here to open the Young Liberal Movement's Convention,<br />
how much notice will you take if a resolution is passed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We listen closely to what the Young Liberals say,<br />
obviously. They have an important'point of view to put on many<br />
issues of-importance, national issues, local issues, not ones that<br />
just affect young people. : So obviously we pay close attention<br />
to many of the things that they say.<br />
QUESTION:' Mr Prime Minister, another of the resolutions is that there should<br />
be compensation for defeated members of Parliament, so that they<br />
can be sure that they've got money coming in. How does that<br />
idea appeal to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: , All branches of the Party, State branches and it is not only<br />
-the Young4Liberal branches, sometimes pass resolutions that<br />
I mightn'i always agree with. I. think that anything that does<br />
, occur in jelation to members . of Parliament ought to flow out of<br />
the Renumeration Tribunal. Any ideas that might be put forward<br />
and that the Tribunal felt were worthwhile, could be looked at,<br />
But losinq your seat is one of the hazards of politics, and I think<br />
it has to be accepted as such.<br />
UESTION: Mr Prime Minister, what Federal powers do you predict will be<br />
handed back to the States?<br />
' RIME MINISTER: Federal powers I think is maybe the wrong way of putting<br />
the question. A meeting is being scheduled for the 4th and<br />
of February to discuss in the major part the initiat implementation<br />
of our new Federalism policy. A-great deal of work will have </p>
<p>to be done and I've got no doubt that we and the States will have<br />
views about the way in which working parties will need to be<br />
established to define some of the finer details of the policy,<br />
such as -the equalisation arrangements as I've said the interests<br />
of States, such as Western Australia or Tasmania, and others<br />
will be completely and absolutely guaranteed, that the rights<br />
and positions of the smaller States will be absolutely protected.<br />
Those equalisation arrangements will take a good deal of working<br />
out between officials in fine detail and this is something that<br />
it just was not possible to do in Opposition. You need the<br />
advice of your officials, advice from Government Departments<br />
and the information that they've got to-enable this work to be<br />
undertaken. . I regard this initial meeting with the Premiers<br />
as an important one in laying the ground work for the work that<br />
has to be * done before the policy can actually be applied.<br />
I hope it'can be applied as soon. as possible.<br />
UESTION: Well Mr Dunstan's described the meeting as a " con job". What<br />
is your r4action to that?<br />
RIPE MINISTER: Well let's see what Mr Dunstan says when he actually gets<br />
to the meeting.<br />
UESTION: Are you prepared to take over the State railways as Mr Whitlam<br />
said he would?<br />
RIME MINISTER: I would have thought that States would basically want to<br />
maintain control over their own railways. One of the things<br />
that hasn't been always understood is that when the Commonwealth<br />
takes over State railways, they take over the States<br />
L </p>
<p>development. While there are some differences between<br />
arrangements to South Australia and to Tasmania, if the Commonwealth<br />
has control over internal transport within a State, it's basically<br />
got contr6l over what can--happen within that State. It is worth<br />
noting, I think in the Tasmanian agreement anyway, there was<br />
power for the Commonwealth to enter into competition with private<br />
road hauliers, virtually power to control the sorts of licences<br />
that might be provided for road hauliers. Now this is giving<br />
complete control to the Commonwealth. I can't really imagine<br />
the State that has a belief and faith in its own capacity to<br />
look after its own affairs wanting to pass that kind of power over<br />
to the Commonwealth.<br />
QUESTION: Many geople were disappointed that some well-known Liberals<br />
. like Don Chipp, Bill Snedden, Peter Rae, Senator Peter Rae, were<br />
left out df your Cabinet. Would you Comment on why they were left ' out?<br />
IRIME MINISTER: I've got no commerit to make on any individuals in the<br />
Parliamentary Liberal'Party.<br />
UESTION: Mr Prime Minister, what percentage of income tax do you intend<br />
giving to the States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think you're asking questions that would be better<br />
to ask! at a later point, after there have been discussions with<br />
the States. The policy does state, in broad outlines, the sort<br />
of base level which would apply as the working point, as the<br />
starting point, as the percentage that the States now get for<br />
tax reimbursement reasons, or from the tax reimbursement formula. </p>
<p>But there's a great deal to be done, a great deal to be<br />
worked out and I've got no doubt that there will be a fair amount<br />
of time before the final details are settled between the States<br />
and ourselves.<br />
QUESTION: Will there be . less tied'grants?<br />
? RIME MINISTER: Well that's the objective, yes,-very much the objective<br />
to give the States more independence, more initiative, more capacity<br />
to do what they believe needs to be done for their own people.<br />
And also, having that capacity then they are accountable for what<br />
they do and don't do, and aren't in a situation in which somebody<br />
from Canberra is telling them what they must do. This makes Canberra<br />
accountable for everything, and I think wrongly so.. Because people<br />
closer to Perth must know their interests, and Western Australia's<br />
interests, 4better than people who are i'n Canberra.-The-whole<br />
thrust of the policy was to create circumstances in which there would<br />
be independent capacity, not only for State Governments but also<br />
for local governments.-<br />
UESTION: Have you moved into the Lodge yet, Mr Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
UESTION: Your wife suggested that it might be a bit too small for you.<br />
RIME MINISTER: Well, we didn't know how many beds there were, and I think<br />
it's some while since a Prime Minister's been in the Lodge with<br />
children. And I did case the joint a week or two ago. T here are </p>
<p>enough beds.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, now that the number of the House of<br />
Representatives.-Jias been finalised, do you feel that having such<br />
a large majority well no doubt you're quite happy to have<br />
such a large majority but do you think it's in the best<br />
interests of the country to have such a large majority?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it was in the best interests of the country that<br />
the verdict against Labor and the three years ofLabor was as strong<br />
* as it was. But I also thought it wasn't just a negative vote<br />
against Labor, because we were offering positive and different..<br />
policies that would take Australia into the 1980' s and beyond.<br />
So I believe, it was also a vote for what we were offering and<br />
I'm very glad that the movement was as firm and as vigorous<br />
* as it wasiagainst what we'd said was the worst Governm-ent in<br />
Australial's history, the worst Government since Federation.<br />
Now what lpesin the future depends upon ourselves what we do<br />
. the way we govern, the conta-twe maintain with people outside<br />
in the general community, the contact we maintain, the cooperation<br />
we establish with State Governments, and through State<br />
Governments with local government. One of the things which will be<br />
important is to make sure that all members of Parliament not only<br />
have, but feel they have, and this is very important for new<br />
member's, the useful and constructive role to play. Now this will be<br />
done through our own Party committees, through Parliamentary<br />
committees, and through discussions in the Party room. I'd already<br />
made it plain as Leader of the Opposition-" and earlier that I'd<br />
wanted to see </p>
<p>substantial changes and improvements in the committee system<br />
in the House of Representatives, giving private members a more<br />
meaningful role to fill and to play. There's a great deal to<br />
be done..' . We've" already established a committee of our own<br />
private members who are preparing a paper for me on the role of<br />
private members in Government, and their role in the Party Room.<br />
And there are particular reasons for this. There are a large<br />
number of new members and because the majority is so large.<br />
So out of all of this I believe we'll get not only good Government<br />
for Australia but a parliament in which people believe they're<br />
being usefully used.<br />
QUESTION:, You don't feel that having so many tends to lead to a feeling of<br />
complacency Within the Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: 0N, well I think the branches-. of the Party,-State Premiers,<br />
, the Young! Liberal Movement and the Party room itself will certainly<br />
prevent the Government from becoming complacent. I've seen on<br />
previous occasions how vigorous Party room debates have kept<br />
Governme4s on their toes this is going back a fair number of years,<br />
I think that the nature of the Liberal Party and the sense<br />
of purpose we have, what we want to achieve will make sure that we<br />
don't feel complacent, and don't become complacent. I'm certain<br />
that if there is any sign of that there will be a great many people<br />
from within the Party and outside who will start to tell us to<br />
get up and start doing things.<br />
UESTION: It's now three weeks since the election, Mr Prime Minister, and<br />
we still don't know properly what the new composition of the<br />
Parliament will be. Would you like to see the voting procedure </p>
<p>a, I 9.<br />
simplified so that we would have a quicker result, a definite<br />
result more quickly?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well Io. think we have a definite result haven't we?<br />
There's a very definite result in the House of Representatives<br />
and there's also a pretty definite result in the Senate.<br />
It's just a question of how large the majority in fact will be in<br />
the Senate.<br />
QUESTION: Wouldn't you like to see the finalisation of it earlier or quicker?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would like to see the finalisation of it earlier<br />
but I wouldn't like to see injustices created merely to achieve an<br />
earlier ' result. If you start to change the voting system<br />
you could. lead tO a situation in which injustices might occur,<br />
some of the changes which were suggested in the past could have<br />
led to that sort of injustice. Changes can be suggested that<br />
: can achievre a quicker result but preserve equity for all Parties<br />
and all people. That's obviously something that we'd look at. </p>
