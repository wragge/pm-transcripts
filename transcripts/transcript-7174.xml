EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
CEDA LUNCHEON<br />
MELBOURNE 15 MAY 1987<br />
Mr Chairman, CEDA members and guests,<br />
The May Statement provides further proof that this<br />
Government is determined to carry through the vital task of<br />
economic reconstruction which, as the revival of the steel<br />
industry dramatically proves, has been the central task of<br />
this Government since its first day in office.<br />
It demonstrated again our capacity to take the hard<br />
decisions which are necessary to restore economic<br />
prosperity. It underlined again our commitment to scrutinise our<br />
spending priorities constantly and to ensure our budget<br />
continues to meet real needs.<br />
Before I turn to the May Statement specifically I want to<br />
trace briefly the economic circumstances which required us<br />
to bring it down.<br />
The roots of Australia's economic problem lie in its failure<br />
in the l96Cs and 70s to participate in the dramatic<br />
expansion of world trade in manufactures and services.<br />
Inward looking economic policies and a systematically<br />
overvalued exchange rate resulted in a largely uncompetitive<br />
manufacturing sector focused on domestic demand and an<br />
export sector overreliant on farming and mining.<br />
The consequences of that failure have become suddenly and<br />
dramatically apparent since late 1984 with the collapse in<br />
world prices of primary commodities. Our terms of trade<br />
have declined by 17.6 per cent, wiping $ 9 billion off our<br />
national economic capacity, blowing out our current account<br />
deficit to an unsustainable 6 per cent of GDP in 1985-86,<br />
and pumping up our external indebtedness at an untenable<br />
rate.<br />
In the four years since we came to office we have<br />
consistently worked to create the new attitudes and new<br />
approaches we need to solve these problems. </p>
<p>In my first campaign as Leader of the Labor Party in March<br />
1983 1 spoke of the need for a three-part program of<br />
national recovery, national reconciliation and national<br />
reconstruction. If you like, these 3 Rs can be boiled down to one the<br />
single need for us all to accept our national responsibility<br />
to achieve sustainable economic growth and a fair<br />
distribution of the benefits of that growth.<br />
As the newly elected Labor Government we accepted that<br />
responsibility and committed ourselves to ensuring the<br />
prosperity of the whole Australian community and not, as our<br />
predecessors had done, working to divide the community and<br />
punish the weaker members of it.<br />
The new attitudes which we brought to Government have struck<br />
a responsive chord in the wider community.<br />
Today we can say there is a new acceptance of the need to<br />
reduce our dependence on our primary industries.<br />
There is a new and widespread rejection of that addictive<br />
drug of dependence called protectionism, which has cramped<br />
our industries at home and which is crushing our export<br />
opportunities abroad.<br />
There is a new acceptance on the part of Australian workers<br />
of the need for restraint in the growth of labour costs to<br />
preserve our national competitiveness and to keep inflation<br />
down. There is a new acceptance of the fact that Governments have<br />
to conserve their limited welfare resources for people who<br />
most need it.<br />
There is a new and widespread acceptance that there should<br />
be no free ridee at the taxpayer's expense for the<br />
privileged at tho expense of the community as a whole.<br />
In short, there is a new acceptance that all of us must take<br />
up the challenge of rescuing Australia from its economic<br />
difficulties. All of us have to bear part of the burden and<br />
work together. That way we can ensure that all of us will<br />
benefit in the future from the prosperity our sacrifices now<br />
will bring about.<br />
The external crisis facing Australia has required a tough<br />
Government response in all areas of general economic policy:<br />
monetary, fiscal and wages. Each has had to be held tight,<br />
in a co-ordinated fashion. Each has brought its temporary<br />
costs but each is absolutely essential to building our<br />
long-term future.<br />
But the speed with which we achieve that goal also depends<br />
fundamentally on how adaptable our industries are. </p>
<p>It is a matter of record that in 1983 our industrial base<br />
was anything but adaptable.<br />
Recognition of that fact was the driving force behind the<br />
initiatives which we have progressively implemented:<br />
to open up the Australian economy to competition;<br />
to encourage industrial research and development;<br />
S to foster co-operation between employers and workers<br />
aimed at boosting productivity;<br />
S to get the dead weight of bureaucracy off the back of<br />
Australian business;<br />
S to reinvlgorate our education and training systems; and<br />
S to promote Australian interests in world trade.<br />
I want to come back to aspects of this theme a little later<br />
because it is a theme which is also prominent in the May<br />
Statement. There can be little doubt that those policies are working.<br />
The principal domestic indicators have turned for the<br />
better: S inflation is on its way down, gradually but certainly;<br />
S the December quarter National Accounts show the<br />
resumption of significant economic growth;<br />
interest rates have begun to decline, a trend which I<br />
believe the May Statement will help to confirm;<br />
S real unit labour costs have fallen by 6 per cent;<br />
most encouraging of all, over 780,000 new jobs have been<br />
created under my Government, and 100,000 new jobs in the<br />
past six months alone; and<br />
S investment has begun to increase, including in<br />
manufacturing.<br />
Just as importantly, however there is substantial evidence<br />
that fundamental restructuring is occurring.<br />
S net exports are likely to account for all of the growth<br />
of the economy in 1986-87;<br />
particularly pleasing have been the strong performance<br />
of manufacturing exports up 32 per cent so far this<br />
financial year and also the 28 per cent decline in the<br />
services deficit covering tourism, freight and the like; </p>
<p>although seasonal factors helped to inflate the April<br />
deficit to just under $ 1 billion, the current account<br />
deficit has fallen, with the 1986-87 outcome likely to<br />
be more than $ 1 billion less than the Budget forecast of<br />
$ 14 3/ 4 billion.<br />
and, while the monthly figures will continue to be<br />
inflated in coming months by seasonal factors, the<br />
underlying improvement in the current account<br />
deficit is expected to continue in 1987-88.<br />
The task is a large and difficult one, however, and there is<br />
still a long, hard haul ahead.<br />
This week's Statement represents a further major step<br />
towards our goal.<br />
The reason is not just the more obvious one that we need to<br />
stop the government sector gobbling up domestic saving so<br />
that the pri-vate sector's appetite can be satisfied, leading<br />
to new investment, without running up an excessive external<br />
debt. It is also because the May Statement is a further step in<br />
our continuing endeavour to rebuild Australia's economic<br />
infrastructure.<br />
The May Statement provides for a combination of spending<br />
cuts, asset sales and receipts measures which will slice a<br />
massive.$ 4 billion from the prospective 1987-88 Budget<br />
deficit. Real outlays growth has been cut from a positive 2 1/ 2 per<br />
cent in the forward estimates to a negative 2 per cent, the<br />
lowest in 30 years. The measures woud consistent with a<br />
deficit of less than 1 per cent of GDP in the August Budget<br />
compared with 1 1/ 2 per cent in 1986-87 and lest it ever<br />
be forgotten, the scandalous 5 per cent which we inherited.<br />
The spending cuts include $ 1 billion from general purpose<br />
payments to the States and $ 1.6 billion from the<br />
Commonwealth's own spending, including major savingg in the<br />
defence and welfare areas.<br />
In the welfare area, this Government has been determined to<br />
accept its responsibility to subject its welfare budget to<br />
the most searching review ever undertaken.<br />
Our motives have not simply been inspired by a recognition<br />
of the economic exigencies. They also recognise the<br />
desirability of overhauling poorly directed programs.<br />
We have not fallen into the trap of assuming that all<br />
welfare recipients were by definition needy and deserving of<br />
automatic, full, and permanent government support regardless<br />
of whatever capacities they may have to support themselves. </p>
<p>Our decisions mean that savings will flow from an all-out<br />
assault on fraud and abuse, from further sharpening the<br />
focus of benefits to those most in need, and from<br />
redesigning programs to better meet the need of young<br />
people, and other welfare recipients to become more self<br />
supporting. Let me make a specific comment about welfare abuse. Welfare<br />
abuse is not only an attack on the taxpayers who fund the<br />
social security system it is also an assault on the<br />
genuine welfare recipients whose circumstances fully entitle<br />
them to community support.<br />
The Government introduced a series of measures in last<br />
year's Budget to detect and stop abuse which have already<br />
removed thousands from the unemployment benefit rolls; these<br />
measures will reduce the average number of unemployment<br />
benefit recipients by some 25,000 in 1987-88.<br />
As a result of the May Statement we will be introducing<br />
additional deterrents to fraud in this area. The original<br />
five teams set up to review unemployment benefit<br />
entitlements will be increased to 19 one for each social<br />
security region.<br />
Earlier this year, we announced that we would establish a<br />
Child Support Agency and strengthen the child maintenance<br />
provisions of the Family Law Act.<br />
These w. ill be the first steps towards ensuring parents who<br />
can afford it will meet their obligations to their children.<br />
The May Statement includes administrative changes to support<br />
these moves, including:<br />
regular reviews of sole parents' eligibility for<br />
income support;<br />
the introduction of 6 new regional review teams<br />
which will operate similarly to those reviewing<br />
unemployment benefits;<br />
a requirement for greater proof of separation and<br />
stricter co-habitation rules.<br />
A central principle in the May Statement's approach to the<br />
welfare budget is our belief that the best help it can give<br />
to many of those relying on social security is to help them<br />
become self-supporting individuals.<br />
However the rationale for this approach is not simply a wish<br />
to conserve the welfare dollar or to encourage individuals<br />
to seek personal fulfillment through work though they are<br />
both important goals.<br />
It is also a fundamental reform designed to help Australia<br />
trade out of its difficulties by making best use of its best<br />
resource its people.<br />
I I </p>
<p>This is why the May Statement initiates new measures<br />
designed to help young people stay at school or in training<br />
rather than go on the dole.<br />
we have virtually eliminated the financial incentive that<br />
existed to leave school by abolishing the dole for 16 and 17<br />
year olds.<br />
This is consistent with the thrust of Government policy to<br />
encourage the completion of secondary education which will<br />
have lifted school retention rates from 36 per cent in 1983<br />
to over 50 per cent by the end of this year.<br />
However, after September, for those who do opt to leave<br />
school, we will now provide a new allowance after three<br />
months, to be called the Job Search Allowance. This is<br />
designed to help defray the costs associated with finding<br />
employment. The new allowance will be fixed at $ 25 per week<br />
half the existing junior rate for unemployment benefit.<br />
An additional payment of up to a further $ 25 a week will be<br />
available subject to a strict test on parental income.<br />
To clear up any misconceptions, let me point out that<br />
existing junior recipients of unemployment benefit will not<br />
be affected by these changes while they remain on the<br />
benefit. Moreover, for genuinely needy homeless young people, the<br />
existing provisions of the Young Homeless Allowance will<br />
apply.<br />
The new job search all. owance does not offer a free ride<br />
for young people.<br />
But it does give them a strong incentive to take up a job<br />
quickly. If they cannot find work, then we offer structured<br />
help to improve their future employment prospects by<br />
directing them to relevant training including training in<br />
job search skills.<br />
This initiative has been reported by some ill informed<br />
commentators as " hitting at" the 16 and 17 year olds. The<br />
opposite is true. These measures will positively benefit<br />
young people by helping them get proper training and more<br />
fulfilling work rather than drifting towards the dead-end<br />
represented by the dole.<br />
Consistent with that approach we have increased our budget<br />
for job training programs by $ 32 million in 1987-88 ($ 63<br />
million in a full year. On top of the strong rise in<br />
training funds already incorporated into the forward<br />
estimates that implies a 50 per cent increase in 1987-88.<br />
It has been one of my Government's very significant<br />
achievements to have imposed an assets test on pensions.<br />
This assets test has had the beneficial effect of removing<br />
from millionaires the right to draw a pension from the<br />
I __ J </p>
<p>public purse without, I stress, damaging the entitlements<br />
of the majority of elderly people to a secure retirement.<br />
This has made the welfare system fairer although it is one<br />
of the Labor Government reforms which the Liberal Opposition<br />
is pledged to reverse.<br />
The May Statement has extended this fairness principle to<br />
other areas of the welfare budget.<br />
Henceforth, the same assets test that applies to aged<br />
pensions will also apply to adults receiving unemployment<br />
and sickness benefits.<br />
Curiously the Opposition Leader supports this assets test,<br />
but not the one on pensions. I have asked him in Parliament<br />
to reveal the chain of logic that leads to that position.<br />
The Government has also decided to impose a means test on<br />
family allowances.<br />
We believe our decision to withdraw family allowance from<br />
families with combined incomes of $ 50,000 or more with<br />
higher limits for larger families strikes a fair balance<br />
between a needs-based social security system and the<br />
acknowledged greater expenses incurred by families with<br />
children. It will be clear I think that the necessary cuts in spending<br />
which we have imposed have been shared across the whole<br />
community. The Government has made certain that its own areas of<br />
spending especially the administration of the public<br />
service have not escaped the knife.<br />
The Government will be closely examining staff requirements<br />
in the course of finalising the August Budget but we are<br />
committed to holding staff numbers down in 1987-88 to less<br />
than those budgeted for this year.<br />
We have also established the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit to<br />
review all sectors of the public service. We have accepted<br />
a number of the Unit's recommendations, providing savings<br />
worth $ 70 million in a full year, ensuring that the public<br />
service becomes at least as lean, efficient and productive<br />
as the private sector's bureaucracy.<br />
Another round of scrutiny reviews will begin shortly. One<br />
of them will examine the workings of the Public Service<br />
Board, which will be restructured to maximise efficiency<br />
while preserving the independence of public sector staffing<br />
decisions. The Commonwealth will also set an example for private<br />
employers in dealing with wage claims under the new<br />
second-tier arrangements. </p>
<p>Before agreeing to any second-tier claim, we will require<br />
the removal of restrictive work and management practices<br />
which will produce efficiency gains commensurate with the<br />
costs of any wage increase granted.<br />
I urge the private sector to adopt a similar approach.<br />
Finally let me comment briefly on pensions.<br />
Having last year imposed a six weeks deferral of payment on<br />
pensioners, we thought it only fair that full indexation of<br />
pension rates should continue. There were no cuts or<br />
deferrals in the May Statement and there will be none in the<br />
August budget.<br />
In addition, the measures previously announced to ease<br />
pensioner means tests, including for rent assistance will go<br />
ahead from 1 July.<br />
Pensioners were asked to share part of the national economic<br />
burden and their response was magnificent. They have made<br />
their contribution!<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I want to leave you with some thoughts and some evidence<br />
about the comparative ability of Labor and our conservative<br />
predecessors to manage the nation's economic challenge.<br />
As you would remember, the previous Government had to manage<br />
a significant decline in the terms of trade between the June<br />
quarter of 1976 and the December quarter of 1977.<br />
Though some improvement took place in the following<br />
quarters, the previous government over their first four<br />
years had to fashion economic policies to cope with a net<br />
decline of 7.3 per cent in the terms of trade.<br />
But they failed to see the writing on the wall. They failed<br />
to set in train the necessary policies to restructure the<br />
Australian economy and revitalise Australian industry.<br />
The fruits of their economic management over that period<br />
were real GDP growth of 13.4 per cent and employment growth<br />
of 4 per cent about a quarter of a million jobs.<br />
By contrast the decline in the terms of trade during Labor's<br />
period has been much sharper and more protracted. The net<br />
fall over the first four years of this government is<br />
expected to be of the order of 17 or 18 per cent more than<br />
twice that of our predecessors over the same period of time.<br />
How has Labor managed? Real GDP seems set to rise by some<br />
19 or 20 per cent over our four years in office 40 to<br />
per cent more than in their first four years and<br />
employment growth under my Government has been three times<br />
what it was under them. </p>
<p>So this Government has produced more growth and more jobs in<br />
the first four years despite more than double the fall in<br />
the terms of trade.<br />
Even more conclusively we have achieved it in a world<br />
environment which has been less conducive to export sales.<br />
Real GDP growth in OECD countries rose 16.2 per cent over<br />
those Fraser/ Howard years but, on current forecasts, only<br />
13.4 per cent during our first four years.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
For three decades out of the four since the end of the<br />
Second World War, Australia was ruled by conservative<br />
governments which adopted short--sighted, insular and ad hoc<br />
approaches to the task of national economic decision-making.<br />
They practiced an outdated style of politics, which failed<br />
in the task of equipping the nation for the challenges it<br />
would face in the future.<br />
In particular, they succumbed to the pressures of sectional<br />
interest groups, gaining political support by further<br />
feather-bedding what were usually the more privileged groups<br />
in the community to begin with.<br />
That was a failure of political leadership it put the<br />
political self-interest of the government ahead of the<br />
national interest.<br />
We have turned that chronic political failure on its head.<br />
For example, last month I announced that I would not<br />
exercise my right to call an early election. At the time I<br />
was confident we would have won an early election and this<br />
week's public opinion poll and the continuing disarray among<br />
the Opposition factions fully confirms that judgement.<br />
But I decided to forego the short-term political gain for<br />
this reason: because at that time an early election would<br />
have been inconsistent with our long-term strategy to<br />
restructure the Australian economy.<br />
As I said last June, and repeated on many occasions since, I<br />
would rather lose Government than go soft on the difficult<br />
economic decisions that have to be taken.<br />
So we are putting the nation first and that practice is<br />
winning the respect of the Australian community.<br />
Last night, Mr Howard had the perfect opportunity to close<br />
his $ 16 billion credibility gap. He squibbed it.<br />
In our May Statement, we sat the test. And we passed with<br />
flying colours. I I </p>
<p>Mr Howard sat the test in his reply last night, and he<br />
failed. He did not repudiate any of his tax or spending<br />
commitments. Instead he repeated his expensive tax promises<br />
repeal of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains<br />
tax, and cuts in income tax for the rich.<br />
Mr Howard's credibility gap is fast becoming a yawning<br />
chasm.<br />
My Government will not engage in the pseudo-macho displays<br />
which have characterised the opposition's and the New<br />
Right's contributions to the national economic debate.<br />
our achievement bears no resemblance to their simpleminded<br />
espousal of indiscriminate slashing of Government spending.<br />
Sure, the May Statement is tough.<br />
And sure, its achievements are unprecedented.<br />
But the cuts are, above all, fair and purposeful.<br />
They are designed to improve the effectiveness with which we<br />
spend taxpayers' money, be it on welfare or defence on<br />
public service salaries or job training.<br />
And they are consistent with our strategy, stretching now<br />
over 4 years, to rebuild the Australian economy.<br />
Taken together with the Opposition Leader's reply last<br />
night, the may Statement dramatically reveals that<br />
Australian politics is now divided along a new and profound<br />
fault line.<br />
on one side of this fault line stands the Government, with<br />
its proven commitment to implement national policies which<br />
are both fair dinkum and fair.<br />
Fair dinkum: because they are directed to resolving in a<br />
responsible fashion the real economic challenge facing the<br />
nation.<br />
And fair: because they meet that challenge without<br />
threatening Labor's tradition of compassionate help for the<br />
underprivileged. on the other side of the fault line of Australian politics<br />
stand the various factions which make up the conservative<br />
forces today.<br />
Where our policies add up, theirs do not. Where our<br />
policies spread the burden fairly, theirs are tilted towards<br />
helping the privileged few. where our policies look forward<br />
to a productive prosperous Australia, theirs look backwards<br />
to the days of tax rorting and free rides.<br />
The May Statement and Mr Howard's reply show how deep is<br />
that political fault line. </p>
<p>11<br />
As the benefits of the May Statement are increasingly felt<br />
and as the Australian economy grows increasingly strong as<br />
we enter the 1990s the fault line will become even more<br />
clear cut.<br />
And I have no doubt which side of the divide will be<br />
recognised by the Australian people as providing the best<br />
future for this country. </p>
