    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to learn of the death today of General John Baker AC DSM. </p>
<p>General Baker had a distinguished career in the Australian Defence Force, culminating in his appointment as Chief of Defence Force from 1995 to 1998.</p>
<p>I knew General Baker well. He was the first Chief of Defence Force I worked with when I came to office in 1996 and I valued his sage advice in that period.</p>
<p>His leadership of the Defence Force through a significant period of change, including integration of the military and civilian arms of Defence, was inspirational. </p>
<p>General Baker continued to serve Australia with distinction after his retirement, making a valuable contribution to many community groups including Australia Day in the National Capital.</p>
<p>General Baker was an outstanding public servant and a deserving recipient of our nation's highest honour when appointed as a Companion in the Order of Australia. Janette joins me in extending our deepest sympathy to General Baker's family on the loss of a fine Australian.  </p>
