EMBARGO: 7.30 p. m.<br />
Monday 4 June 1973<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL WILLESEE BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR E. G. WHITLAM, CANBERRA<br />
MONDAY 4 JUNE 1973<br />
WILLESEE: This would seem to be an interview which doesn't<br />
require a great introduction. The Prime Minister, Mr Gough<br />
Whitlam, is the first Labor Prime Minister in 23 years and he<br />
has now been at it for six months. Mr Whitlam; Do you think<br />
that the worst thing that has happened to you so far might<br />
be the Victorian State elections?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. That's only an episode.<br />
WILLESEE: Have you had a worse episode in six months?<br />
PhIME MINISTER: No. Of course I was disappointed at: how badly<br />
we did our Party did in Victoria. But I think the clear<br />
thing was this. That a good progressive Liberal can still do<br />
well and keep the middle ground. We won it in Victoria six<br />
months ago; Mr Hamer was able to keep it at the present time.<br />
WILLESEE: Sir Henry Bolte said-, " Thank God for Gough Whitlam!"<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But if Sir Henry Bolte had been there, there<br />
would have been a very different result. Mr Hamer is different<br />
from Sir Henry Bolte and the people of Victoria knew it.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you think yoi~ lre wise to say to the people of<br />
Victoria: Make this a test vote; show me what you think of<br />
the Opposition's actions in the Senate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I wasn't. They took no notice of me.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you sure they took no notice.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They took no notice.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you ever think that you can do it that way, say<br />
make this a test vote?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought<br />
WILLESEE: If you had won you would have claimed a success,<br />
wouldn't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course. I suppose this is always the<br />
difficulty. If a Federal Leader is asked to take part in a<br />
State Election, what is he to talk about? All the interests<br />
I have in politics are Federal, not State. So I made a speech<br />
and I put this in, Mr Hamer is a good politician; he didn't<br />
pick up the dead cat. It got no publicity; it had no effect.<br />
WILLESEE: As you have been the front runner in Australian<br />
politics for six months, very clearly. You have been talked<br />
about most. The political atmosphere has been one of discussion<br />
about Gough Whitlam, and one State had an election, and you<br />
didn't do very well. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If you want to go on that basis we did very<br />
well in the Brisbane City Council elections. We did very well<br />
in the South Australian elections. I don't take the credit for<br />
either. I am not going to take the blame for the Victorian.<br />
The fact is that on all the issues of significance Mr Hamer<br />
was not at odds with me. Mr Hamer and Mr Holding were putting<br />
substantially the same program as I would put in the position<br />
of either of them.<br />
WILLESEE: What do you think about the Catholic Bishop coming in<br />
and saying '-Don't vote Labor because of abortionP'.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well let's be specific. it was one wicked old<br />
man; he is contemptible. I will waste no time on him. He was<br />
a liar and I am not going to enter into controversy with him<br />
WILLESEE: What do you think oE the Church for allowing one of<br />
its Bishops to interfere in politics in that manner?<br />
PRXME MINISTER: I think that the Church would do well to be<br />
tougher and to insist on the retiring age for some of its wicked<br />
old men. But the Church has made terrific changes in the last<br />
couple of decades and there are changes which some Bishops<br />
don't like.<br />
WILLESEE: Did you ask anybody in the Church to try and counteract<br />
what that Bishop said?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no,<br />
WILLESEE: Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: it is not my business; the Church can deal<br />
with these things very well.<br />
WILLESEE: Let's move from one State to the States. One<br />
overriding problem that you appear to be having is one of State<br />
rights, dismissal of the Privy Council, the last court of appeal<br />
and also ownership of Australian minerals offshore. How was it<br />
that you and Don Dunstan can differ so markedly over this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a difference between all the States<br />
on this issue and the Commonwealth has been ever since<br />
John Gorton first brought it up. There is a difference these<br />
days between the Liberals in the Federal Parliament as there<br />
has been for the last three years. Now the whole point about<br />
it is this. We can't as a nation a llow our offshore resources<br />
to be dissipated in the way our onshore resources were. Look<br />
what would happen if you had six States making different<br />
arrangements as you had, say, Sir Charles Court and Mr BjelkePetersen<br />
doing with onshore resources. We have to deal as a nation or<br />
we fail and Mr Connor has shown how successfully we can deal as<br />
a nation. Look at the deal he got from the Japanese mineral<br />
importers this last week.<br />
WILLESEE: Three of your Labor Premiers disagree with you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Does that alarm you. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. They are wrong. They are playing the<br />
role of Canute. There is no question that Australians don't<br />
believe that British courts are better than the High Court<br />
of Australia. Why should we still have appeals to the Privy<br />
Council in England? Also I don't believe that Australians<br />
believe the States can look after offshore resources better<br />
than the Commonwealth.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you agree that in most senses you and<br />
Don Dunstan think in a very similar manner?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, we do. We always have; we have been<br />
closely associated for twenty years.<br />
WILLESEE: Then why do you differ so markedly on this one?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We don't discuss it, we just differ on it.<br />
WILLESEE: Could it be that your respective positions influence<br />
your thinking?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose.<br />
WILLESEE: Well could it be then that Gough Whitlam would like<br />
more power?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On things like this I am certain that the<br />
Australian Government, whether it was under Mr Gorton or under<br />
Gough Whitlam, needs to carry this responsibility. I am quite<br />
convinced of this and I believe that my predecessors as<br />
Prime Minister would really have been of the same view.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you think Don Dunstan would change his mind if<br />
he were in charge in Canberra?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, but he won't prevail on this issue. In<br />
Canberra, yes he probably would.<br />
WILLESEE: You say he won't prevail.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course not.<br />
WILLESEE: In the Federal Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course not.<br />
WILLESEE: Your quite sure on that:?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Absolutely. Do you really think that the<br />
Federal Conference of the Labor Party would do anything to<br />
down-grade the first Federal Government we have had in a<br />
quarter of a century?<br />
WILLESEE: Could I put that question to you? Do you think they<br />
would? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: The Labor Party has a rather nasty history of toppling<br />
tall poppies from time to time, </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but not when they are carrying out party<br />
policy. This was settled at our last Conference, and that they<br />
will not be deterred by the obstruction of the Privy Council<br />
or the offshore resources.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Don't mind me putting this in. The differences<br />
of significance on this matter are within the Liberal Party.<br />
The Labor Party in the Federal Parliament is absolutely united<br />
on this. The Liberals have differed between the House of<br />
Representatives and the Senate.<br />
WILLESEE: I just suggested perhaps unfairly that you may be<br />
motiviated in these actions for a desire for more power. You<br />
have had power for six months now. Do you enjoy that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, sure. Very much.<br />
WILLESEE: How different does it feel to have power?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: All the frustrations of twenty years preparation<br />
in opposition are no longer there.<br />
WILLESEE: Are there different frustrations now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose so, but they haven't yet emerged.<br />
WILLESEE: What about Caucus, that body of all the Federal Labor<br />
Parliamentarians who can override you and your Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. They haven't. They are fully involved<br />
in the whole process and they get the same satisfaction.<br />
WILLESEE: What would you do if they did?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well of course I would accept it. But is it<br />
Slikely? It hasn't happened. Do not let us be hypothetical<br />
about these things.<br />
WILLESEE: Well politics is almost the art of hypothis isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. it is the art of the possible. And is<br />
Caucus going to embarrass a successful, positive, Government?<br />
They are proud of it. They are part of it.<br />
WILLESEE: In personal terms, while we are talking about,<br />
your attitude to power and so on, you still come under<br />
some criticism for your personality, Strangely you win the<br />
popularity polls that are taken by the survey people. The<br />
last one I recall you were clearly ahead of Mr Snedden and<br />
Mr Anthony in most factors except arrogance. They were rated<br />
to be more humble than you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought that we were all pretty close. I<br />
suppose they have more to be humble about. Is that what you<br />
expect me to say?<br />
WILLESEE: I don't expect any answer. Does that concern you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not terribly. I expect, you know, it is<br />
inevitable in a Parliamentary system where people are asked </p>
<p>questions and give answers and so on that whoever has the<br />
numbers, whoever is the Prime Minister or the Premier will<br />
appear or be called arrogant. It goes with the job.<br />
WILLESEE: It is not a peculiarly personal weakness perhaps?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I can't tell. You ask me to be too<br />
subjective.<br />
WILLESEE: The other point, that is raised against you is<br />
that you are sometimes<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Is the Federal Conference tossing me? Are the<br />
State Premiers tossing me, the Caucus tossing me, the<br />
personality faults? What's next?<br />
WILLESEE: We have twenty minutes to go. To be impetuous<br />
appears to be a Whitlam trait? Is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't think so. The things which I<br />
do are usually the result of years of consideration. I mean<br />
you have been talking about some of these matters of policy<br />
on which there would be, say, a difference in the Party.<br />
These are deep seated views of mine, you can go back for twenty<br />
years...... WILLESEE: I don't think I can accept that fully, I am not<br />
talking about policy<br />
PRIME MINITSTER: There has been a very consistent or you might<br />
say stubbon adherence to those principles.<br />
WILLESEE: I think I am talking about Whitlam on his feet.<br />
What about the outburst about President Nixon a couple of days<br />
ago. PRIME MINISTER: No outburtt. No outburst.<br />
WILLESEE: Really?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. No outburst. You are going on the headlines.<br />
WILLESEE: No, I am going on whht you said. I read it, I<br />
interpret it as a criticism of both President Nixon and the<br />
United States political system.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe Australia has a better political<br />
system than the United States, Don't you?<br />
WILLESEE: It doesn't matter.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No? Well I think it does matter, and I don't<br />
believe that we gain anything by suggesting that the Australian<br />
political system is inferior to the American political system.<br />
America is a very great democracy but she has run into some<br />
very bad shoals, because of deficiences in the syst%-em.<br />
WILLESEE: You talked about the parlous position that President<br />
Nixon finds himself in because of his personal behaviour. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I respond to a smart question by my<br />
predecessor saying that I am breaking-in in a Watergate fashion.<br />
Now is the reference to Watergate meant to be insulting to<br />
President Nixon or to me?<br />
WILLESEE: But it doesn't matter. He is not the Prime Minister,<br />
you are.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Nixon wouldn't take it as flattering.<br />
I didn't take it as flattering either. Watergate has been a<br />
disaster. I didn't mention it, it was mentioned in a question<br />
to me.<br />
WILLESEE: You must accept that what you said could only harm<br />
personal relations.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not at all. Where President Nixon has been<br />
right I have been unstinting in my acknowledgement and praise<br />
of the fact that he was right. He is the first American<br />
President who has faced up, in twenty years and more, to<br />
the existence of China. He is the first one who has faced up<br />
to the necessity of having reasonable relations with the Soviet<br />
Union. He is the first American President for twelve years who<br />
faced up to the necessity of getting out of Vietnam and I<br />
praised him for those three positive achievements.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you the first Australian Prime Minister to face<br />
up to an Axneican President?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, where he has been wrong as I thought he<br />
was and every other leader in the world is of the same view.<br />
He was wrong on the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.<br />
WILLESEE: Does it help for you to draw his-* attention to his<br />
embarrassement over the Watergate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't. The Watergate was raised by my<br />
predecessor.<br />
WILLESEE: And you answered?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. What am I to say? He is in a parlous<br />
position and so is the Presidency because of deficiencies which<br />
have now been shown in the American system compared with ours.<br />
Now look, let's face it. Mr Heath or I, we face a Parliament<br />
every day it is sitting. If president Nixon had had to be in<br />
touch with public opinion every day the Congress was sitting,<br />
things wouldn't have been allowed to drag on till they became<br />
so critical<br />
WILLESEE: Alright, you support<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And I do prefer, and there are many forms of<br />
democracy in the world, I must say I prefer the system where the<br />
Executive is responsible to the legislature.<br />
WILLESEE: Now you stand by your actions and your words about<br />
President Nixon, but you must accept that a lot of people think... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: That is, I praise him where he is right.<br />
I have done so publicly. I have explained to him privately<br />
where I have thought he was wrong.<br />
WILLESEE: Well, let's accept that there are some people, it<br />
doesn't matter how many, in Australia who are most concerned<br />
about what you said. What are you going to do to allay their<br />
fears? Will you meet President Nixon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect so. No arrangements have been<br />
made yet. But I am glad you ra * ised this, because the last three<br />
Prime Ministers of Australia has sought an official<br />
invitation to visit the United States, as if it were a test<br />
of legitimacy. They had to go to a coronation. Sir Robert<br />
Menzies, Mr Menzies, he didn't wait for official invitations;<br />
if he was going to Britain or the United States he would expect<br />
to see the Prime Minister, the President. They don't wait<br />
for an official invitation. I expect to see Mr Heath,<br />
I expect to see Mr Nixon.<br />
WILLESEE: It is a fair sort of gamble if it doesn't pay off<br />
in Washington, isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On whose side?<br />
WILLESEE: On your side.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well let's face it. I am going. It has been<br />
known for months that I am going to the Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government Conference in Ottawa early in August. Among the<br />
many invitations that I have received to make official visits to<br />
countries where Australian Prime Ministers have never previously<br />
made a visit is Mexico and I said, right, I will go there on<br />
the way to Ottawa. I will obviously go through or across the<br />
United States, and in those circumstances I. would expect to see<br />
Mr Nixon. After all, Australia and the United States are more<br />
closely associated than most of the Commonwealth countries are<br />
associated with the United States. What would be said if I went<br />
straight to Ottawa and didn't visit the United States?<br />
WILLESEE: What would be said if you went straight to Washington<br />
and didn't see Nixon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wait until that happens. You know very well<br />
that anything we say on this program will continue all the<br />
speculation on this matter. Now I believe that President Nixon<br />
is a mature, courteous head of government.<br />
WILLESEE: A lot of Australians see a great need for a big<br />
powerful friend in defence terms. They want some sort of<br />
umbrella and they still see America as being No. 1.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In the case of a world war, that is so, I<br />
agree. WILLESEE: You would not jeopardise that position?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not at all. Don't forget, America needs us<br />
in the case of a world war, just as much as we need America.<br />
WILLIESEE: Do you accept that </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a mutuality of benefit here.<br />
WILLESEE: Some Australian voters think that you are jeopardising<br />
that umbrella?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course some of them think that; they brought<br />
that at the last elections. But the majority of the Australian<br />
people no longer want to touch the forelock to any great<br />
power. They think Australia ought to make some decisions<br />
herself. WILLESEE: Are you happy about the performance of your Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In most cases I am delighted.<br />
WILLESEE: Does Senator Murphy ernbarass you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In some respects, yes; in other respects,<br />
I am delighted with him.<br />
WILLESEE: Where does he embarrass you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't go over that. But let me bring in<br />
where I am delighted. Nobody could have done more...<br />
WILLESEE: I am sure people are more interested in<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not. But I want the public to realise<br />
that Senator Murphy has done a magnificent job, not just for<br />
the Government, but for the Australian nation. In Britain<br />
on the Privy Council issue. In The Hague, before the world<br />
court, on the French Test Issue, and he will do so in modernising,<br />
humanising, our laws. There is no man better equipped to do<br />
these jobs, no man more dedicated in doing them, than<br />
Senator Murphy.<br />
WILLESEE: What about the Croatian controversy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will no re-hash that, at this notice.<br />
Senator Murphy has my complete confidence in doing these things<br />
I have mentioned.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you think a Prime Minister should be able to say a<br />
Cabinet Minister embarrasses me in some respects and let it go<br />
at that? Shouldn't you do something about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I keep a sense of proportion. The important<br />
things have been done splendidly.<br />
WILLESEE: Does Dr Cairns embarrass you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. When he is doing his job as minister for<br />
Overseas Trade he has been the most successful we have had in<br />
our country's history. This visit he has just made to China<br />
will be as significant as the relations which John McEwen was<br />
able to establish with Japan in the middle fifties. This has<br />
been a landmark in our overseas trade.<br />
WILLESEE: You said when he is doing his job. What about when<br />
he steps outside that job? </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, he doesn't. And I am not going into<br />
various headlines there.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you show unqualified support for Dr Cairns?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As Minister for Overseas Trade he is the best<br />
Australia's ever had. This has been a landmark.<br />
WILLESEE: You keep qualifying your support to that job.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not going to be distracted from the<br />
essential things. I chose Dr Cairns in that portfolio and<br />
I am delighted with his performance of it. And every Australian<br />
ought to be proud of it. This was the biggest overseas trade<br />
mission we've ever had. And it has been very successful.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you like a Cabinet reshuffle?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: You are quite happy the way it is?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. That is the people that Caucus chose for<br />
me I think were good choices. I mean I might have made a few<br />
different choices, but they have been good choices. The<br />
allocation of portfolios I would not change.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you suprised by the performances of some of<br />
your Ministers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Who?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is, I am still more pleased than I expected<br />
to be with many of them, yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Disappointed with some?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: What can you do about that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They are learning.<br />
WILLESEE: If you are disappointed with some why don't you<br />
want a Cabinet reshuffle?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because they are learning.<br />
WILLESEE: Is it because you can't?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I could reshuffle the Cabinet, that is, I can<br />
reallocate the portfolios whenever I want to. I don't want to.<br />
They are doing very well.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you like to have the right to choose your<br />
Ministers? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No. Certainly not. A lot of people suggest<br />
that somehow this is an embarrassment; it's not in the least.<br />
And the most successful, the only successful Liberal leader in<br />
Australia, Mr Hamer has the same sort of Cabinet, one elected<br />
by his Caucus. That is the effective and democratic way<br />
of going about it. I have alway5 supported it, not least now<br />
that I have such a Cabinet.*<br />
WILLESEE: In very general terms, how is the man in the street<br />
affected by this Labor Government? What is different in his<br />
country for him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, there are some external things that<br />
we have mentioned already; for instance, what Connor has<br />
done with the export of minerals to Japan, what Cairns has done<br />
WILLESEE: Can I chip in, because that is almost not what I<br />
ami talking about?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, OK then, you mean internally?<br />
WILLESEE: Yes, Foreign Affairs, switch in emphasis and all that.<br />
It takes a long time to get through to the man in the street.<br />
How does he know he is in a different Australia? Or is he in<br />
a different Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well there are very great number of people<br />
who are already benefittingfrom the things which can be done<br />
swiftly internally, such as welfare matters. There has been<br />
the biggest improvement in welfare payments, repatriation,<br />
social services, that there has ever been, and there is the<br />
guarantee to maintain those benefits in the future. People<br />
in the Armed Forces, certainly, and to a fairer extent the<br />
Public Service, realise that they now have a Federal Government<br />
which will look after them properly. The other things are<br />
emerging; for instance this week we got what I think is<br />
probably the most substantial achievement we have had so far.<br />
We had the report of the Interim Schools Committee. I ordered<br />
it before Christmas, it came in last Wednesday. A couple of<br />
weeks before there was the one on the Insurance, the Health<br />
Funds, and also this week there was the one on the Hospitals.<br />
Now it is on this basis of expert reports which are now available<br />
for everybody to read.<br />
WILLESEE: Are things going fast enough for you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I mean of course I would like to do some<br />
things more quickly, but it is not possible to deal with, say,<br />
hospitals and schools any faster than what we have. We have<br />
acted on these very quickly. We were in six months last<br />
Saturday and we have got the basic reports in already. Now<br />
that is pretty fast work. The experts have collaborated with<br />
us amazingly, and the State Government, I want to acknowledge<br />
that too. N. S. W. has made available five of their Supreme<br />
Court Judges. New Zealand has made one of their Judges of<br />
Appeal available. And there are several Federal Judges and many<br />
other top business people and academics are happy to work for </p>
<p>-11-<br />
us, because they know that what they say won't be suppressed,<br />
the public will know what their recommendations are. We are<br />
seeking advice, we are publicising it and w will try to carry<br />
it out.<br />
WILLESEE: Your programs are costing you more than you anticipated,<br />
aren't they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In some respects, yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Does that alarm you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. But at the same time we have a task<br />
force under Dr Coombs, that will cut back on a lot of the<br />
freakless expenditures which we inherited.<br />
WILLESEE: Will this money problem stop you from doing some<br />
things that you want to do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will stop us doing as many things as we want<br />
or doing them as quickly as we wanted. That is true, but we<br />
will be committing ourselves to the programs unquestioningly.<br />
Let me give you an instance: I suppose we will not be able to<br />
carry out the sewerage schemes in all our big cities as quickly<br />
as we wanted to.<br />
WILLESEE: Is your overall job much more difficult than you<br />
thought it would be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Is it easy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it is not easy. It is satisfying. There<br />
are some things which obviously I would be able to do better<br />
and my colleagues would be able to do better, if, for instance<br />
the States, were to hand over their railways, and their<br />
hospitals to the Australian Government. The railways and the<br />
hospitals in Australia would be very much better. This will<br />
take longer. I am not surprised at their acting so slowly or<br />
reluctantly, I accept that that is in the game.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you a confident Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I suppose so.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you confident enought to really have a double<br />
dissolution and take both houses back to the electors.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If the Senate makes it clear, in a few months,<br />
because there can't be a double dissolution for a few months,<br />
the situation has not arisen yet, but if by the end of the<br />
year or early next year it's plain that the Senate will not let<br />
basic legislation through, then we will have a double<br />
dissolution. WILLESEE: You are quite firm on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE; You are not prepared to concede any of your<br />
substantive legislation? </p>
<p>-12-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The important things are to get th ' e structure<br />
transformed. To get basic legislation through, and if the<br />
Senate prevents that then the people will have to decide.<br />
WILLESEE: Will you let the doctors beat you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Not just beating us, beat the public.<br />
WILLESEE: How can you stop them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The doctors depend for half their incomes on<br />
the taxpayer. The doctors, specialists and surgeons, depend<br />
on the public to provide them with their equipment, their<br />
laboratories their operating theatres, and so on. There is no<br />
calling in Australia which depends so much on public<br />
expenditure taxation as the doctors.<br />
WILLESEE: But precisely how do you make them compromise?<br />
How do you make them see reason, see what you would see as<br />
reason?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The conditions on which doctors use public<br />
facilities, the conditions on which the public underwrites<br />
doctors incomes, is determined by elected people, by Government.<br />
WILLESEE: But if you take action in those areas you risk<br />
hurting the people again, the patients.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No we won't.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you satisfied you will win?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Public opinion is behind us. Because<br />
doctors will do very well out of our programs. We want the<br />
public to have as good a health service as possible. Now don't<br />
forget that the doctors are very much divided on this. There<br />
are only, in simple terms, some of the general practitioners,<br />
who are obstructing. The research people, the specialists,<br />
the surgeons, the young ones, they are in general much in<br />
favour of what we want to achieve on behalf of the Australian<br />
public. WILLESEE: Mr Whitlam, we are now out of time now. You have been<br />
Prime minister for six months, how long do you think you will<br />
be Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am determined to give up the job before I<br />
am sixty-five. So what is that, another three Parliaments?<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Whitlam thanks very much for talking with us. </p>
