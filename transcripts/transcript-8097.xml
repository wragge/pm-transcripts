INTERVIEW WITH JOHN STANLEY, RADIO 2UE, 22 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
STANLEY: Good afternoon Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good afternoon.<br />
STANLEY: Well the stage performers I guess like to check<br />
their reviews after opening night and I know that<br />
politicians, whatever they think of the media, like to do<br />
the same on the morning after the Budget. Now your<br />
reviews today you've got ' Keating slashes social<br />
welfare', ' Keating savages battlers', you've also got<br />
another one, ' slugger Keating, old, sick and jobless<br />
hit'. Is that a fair representation of the Budget?<br />
PM: Yes, but if you look at the same one you read from<br />
about Keating savages battlers, you look over to the left<br />
hand column and you get their economic correspondent,<br />
Ross Gittins', ' welcome to Paul's pop gun'. Now that one<br />
page really characterises the reaction I think. What you<br />
have as on the one hand people saying that we've been<br />
tough on the other hand, people saying we've not tough<br />
enough. So that typifies the reviews, in a funny sort of<br />
way it also points to the internal contradictions of Dr<br />
Hewson's reaction. He put out a statement last night<br />
that even Peacock would have been ashamed of at his best.<br />
He started off saying we've brought in further cuts in<br />
living standards, hammering us for that and then goes on<br />
to say that we haven't hit hard enough. So it just goes<br />
to show I think that we've probably got it right. I mean<br />
we've had to do some hard things, but we haven't been<br />
ruthless. STANLEY: Yes, but a lot of people are saying you should<br />
have been tougher particularly at the beginning of a<br />
three year term, when you are this far away from an<br />
election? PM: Yes, that's fair enough. But there is no merit<br />
either economic or political in being hairy chested for<br />
the sake of saying everyone look at my great hairy chest.<br />
I mean what budgets and economic policy are about are<br />
bringing down decisions which are appropriate to the<br />
economic and social needs of the country. And what we<br />
have committed ourselves to last year and this year<br />
is not to plunging this economy into recession. We've<br />
tried to lower the level of activity and at the same </p>
<p>time, however, keep a level of growth there. Now if<br />
you're going to do that you can't just go massively<br />
surgically operating on the economy.<br />
STANLEY: Well you're a punter, a lot of this budget is<br />
predicated on a punt on where the oil price is going to<br />
be during this year?<br />
PM: That's part of it and as you know we've used an<br />
assumption of $ 23 oil prices are in US dollars. Now<br />
just let me make a couple of points on that, I alluded to<br />
it in the House yesterday. I'll just go to it briefly.<br />
The price before the crisis arose was just about $ 20 a<br />
barrel. It shot up to thirty at one point and is now<br />
back to the mid twenties. Now that of itself shows<br />
volatility. The statistics are these. The loss of Iraqi<br />
and Kuwait crude equals about four million barrels per<br />
day. Now this has happened at a time when the stocks in<br />
the world are higher virtually than they've ever been<br />
before. Now those stocks could easily be run down for<br />
quite a period of time at about one million barrels per<br />
day. That would leave about three million barrels a day<br />
to be made up by OPEC and non OPEC, and that's easily<br />
capable of being done and the signs are that they are<br />
doing it. So you could have oil prices peaking in the<br />
December quarter and then running down in the second half<br />
of this financial year. So I think that $ 23 is a not<br />
unrealistic figure.<br />
STANLEY: But if it is wrong, it could push up inflation.<br />
The unions are saying that they would want to be<br />
compensated for that. Should they be compensated through<br />
wage increases or through tax cuts, or neither?<br />
PM: Well that's a speculation as to what might happen.<br />
I think we've shown in the past that there is a<br />
flexibility within the Accord arrangements, both on the<br />
part of the Government and of the trade unions, and I<br />
think the unions have been tremendously responsible in<br />
the way they've restrained wage claims at times of very<br />
high levels of economic activity. We're not going to<br />
abuse the restraint which they have exercised. I'm<br />
confident that if we get a difficult situation arising<br />
that we'll be able to talk through with the unions an<br />
outcome which is in the best interests of the country.<br />
STANLEY: Yes and would it be in wages or in terms of<br />
some tax cuts?<br />
PM: Well we've shown in the past there's a flexibility<br />
in regard to sort of delaying implementation of wage<br />
increases or in looking at tax cuts. We've shown a<br />
flexibility in the past, I believe we'll be able to do<br />
that if it's necessary in the future. Of course I think<br />
its all our hope in that we're going to see an early end<br />
to the crisis. </p>
<p>STANLEY: I want to get onto that in a moment. But on<br />
the question of the budget, can you understand there'd be<br />
a lot of fear and trepidation among pensioners today,<br />
maybe misplaced for many of them, but they<br />
PM: Yes I can, I can. For instance, it's helpful in<br />
trying to analyse a situation like this to look at<br />
experience. In some sense you can go back to the assets<br />
test. Remember when we brought that in, as I've said,<br />
everyone was saying it's the end of civilisation as we<br />
know it. Well of course that wasn't so. It was a<br />
correct structural decision. In this case the two major<br />
decisions we've taken affecting pensioners are the<br />
correct decisions and will not adversely affect<br />
pensioners. If you take firstly, in regard to<br />
pharmaceuticals, by definition no pensioner will be worse<br />
of f. But the fact that price signals will be introduced<br />
should mean that there'll be a very significant cutting<br />
in the unnecessary accumulation of drugs. The rate of<br />
cost increase for the community was unsustainable. The<br />
most important statistic in this respect in the budget<br />
was the one that Paul referred to. It took almost<br />
years up until 1985 for the cost of the scheme to get to<br />
half a billion dollars. It only took another four years<br />
from ' 85-' 89 for the next half a billion. It was<br />
exploding and so we had to do this. And it's interesting<br />
that independent commentators generally have recognised<br />
this fact. But because we're compensating with that<br />
pension increase no pensioner will be worse off. Now in<br />
regard to the deeming, we have a situation there where<br />
unfortunately what was happening in the community was<br />
that so many of our elderly citizens were simply<br />
subsidising the banking system, putting tens and tens of<br />
millions of dollars in low deposit rates with the banks<br />
and the banks, they' re putting three to four per cent<br />
and the banks lending it out at 18. This was against<br />
their own interests. So the important thing is that no<br />
pensioners will lose their benefit cards which are of<br />
importance to them, and why they were doing this sort of<br />
thing. They won't lose that, existing pensioners. It's<br />
a change that had to be made.<br />
STANLEY: Now you've had structural reform in the social<br />
welfare system over a number of years. A lot of people<br />
are saying today, and the expectation was created by your<br />
own government, that micro reform would be the primary<br />
goal during this term and yet we've seen very little of<br />
that in this budget.<br />
PM: Very little in the budget. That is true. But there<br />
are two things to be said. In the areas where we don't<br />
need any change in our Party policy the work is going on.<br />
Substantial work is going on particuarly with Senator Bob<br />
Collins who I think is very quickly earning the respect<br />
of the whole community for the assiduous way in which<br />
he's accelerating reforms in his area and the waterfront<br />
and so on. That work is continuing. But the second<br />
point was that in regard to the telecommunications area </p>
<p>4<br />
and anything we might do further in regard to the<br />
airlines, we do need to get a change of Party policy.<br />
I've been quite open about this. And therefore we'll go<br />
to our special Party conference at the end of September.<br />
I believe we'll get a sensible outcome from that and that<br />
will enable us then to quickly move in that area. So the<br />
promise I've made about very significant micro-economic<br />
reform in this fourth term will be delivered.<br />
STANLEY: But the economic benefits won't come through<br />
until the next financial year?<br />
PM: No, it is the case quite possibly that if we get the<br />
decisions I hope to get in September, that we can see<br />
some impact in this financial year. But it would not<br />
have been appropriate or statistically acceptable to<br />
conjecture those figures into these budget figurings.<br />
STANLEY: No, but it is possible that if you were to get<br />
some money from sales of some of those assets it would be<br />
in this financial year?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
STANLEY: And it could affect this budget with some<br />
adj ustment?<br />
PM: That could happen, yes.<br />
STANLEY: Alright, just on the question of foreign debt.<br />
It's at record levels and then we have Paul Keating back<br />
in 1988 saying we're going to bring home the bacon with<br />
this budget. We've got foreign debt at record levels,<br />
interest rates are still at very high levels<br />
historically. I mean when are Australians going to start<br />
reaping the rewards of all the rhetoric that we've been<br />
hearing about bringing home the bacon?<br />
PM: In a sense we already are. If you look at the<br />
question of debt, and you've got to understand that as<br />
far as the Commonwealth is concerned as a result of the<br />
financial fiscal stringency which we've imposed, we've<br />
changed the situation from one where the Commonwealth,<br />
the nation of Australia in its federal capacity was a<br />
we were a net international creditor. We've done that.<br />
We've been able to significantly pay off large amounts of<br />
foreign denominated debt. In this budget as a result of<br />
what we've done we have the situation where the total<br />
public sector has a zero borrowing requirement. That is<br />
the public, that government is making no demands upon our<br />
savings. Now that's, you know, an absolute essential<br />
condition for tackling the problems that you're talking<br />
about. STANLEY: Alright, now I can't let you go without talking<br />
about the Middle East<br />
PM: Of course. </p>
<p>STANLEY: because that's the principle concern of<br />
everybody. Is there any more news at the moment on<br />
Australian citizens in the Middle East, any more news you<br />
can give to those people who may have relatives or<br />
friends who they haven't been able to keep track of.<br />
PM: I wish that I were able to say to those people, the<br />
relatives and the loved ones of Australian citizens<br />
detained in Kuwait and Iraq that I had good news. I<br />
haven't. I have nothing to add to really what I said in<br />
the Parliament yesterday and that is that we have this<br />
horrific situation where Suddam Hussein, the leader of<br />
Iraq, is pursuing a course of behaviour which is horrific<br />
and unacceptable by international standards of behaviour<br />
and by the codes which should determine the relations<br />
between nations. There is evidence that foreigners are<br />
being dispersed to strategic targets. We've got, at this<br />
point, no evidence of any number of Australians being in<br />
that situation but one would honestly have to say that<br />
that is a possibility and I'd be misleading your<br />
listeners or the people concerned if I tried to hide that<br />
fact. It's our very very strong hope that the increasing<br />
repulsion and repugnance that has been exhibited around<br />
the world will reflect itself in even more determination<br />
on the part of nations to make it clear to Suddam Hussein<br />
that this is not acceptable and that he will understand<br />
that the best interests of his own people can only be<br />
served by withdrawal.<br />
STANLEY: I know hypothetical questions are not really<br />
the types of questions you should ask in these situations<br />
particularly, but a lot of people have been looking at Mr<br />
Bush's situation, a lot of commentators suggesting that<br />
Mr Bush if he were to engage in a strike against Iraq<br />
would regard the hostages as expendable. If he were to<br />
seek your counsel about military action against Iraq and<br />
ask you for your view, what would you say?<br />
PM: A terribly hard question. Fair enough to put it of<br />
course. You've put an hypothesis, I mean I normally<br />
don't answer hypothetical questions, but let me say to<br />
you in that it's an incomplete hypothesis. I mean I<br />
would need to know the total intelligence situation. I<br />
mean if I were being asked and let me interrupt myself<br />
by saying that we do get excellent intelligence, our own<br />
and our allies share much of theirs with us. The point<br />
I'm making is that if I were being asked to give advice<br />
on that most fundamental of questions then I would need<br />
to be in possession of every single piece of information<br />
that was relevant to making a decision.<br />
STANLEY: Do you expect to be consulted?<br />
PM: I would hope that if the United States is<br />
contemplating any significant escalation of action that<br />
we would be. I would hope that that would be the case.<br />
You've got to understand that really as far as the United </p>
<p>.4<br />
States are concerned there are two aspects of what they<br />
are doing. Firstly they have sent forces to Saudi Arabia<br />
and now to the United Arab Emirates to answer requests<br />
that have been specifically sent to them for forces.<br />
Those forces were essentially sent in a protective<br />
capacity because all the evidence looked as though Saddam<br />
Hussein was going to make a strike against Saudi Arabia<br />
from Kuwait. It looks as though the very prompt action<br />
of the United States in answering those requests has<br />
limited the likelihood of the Iraqis making such a<br />
strike. Now that's one aspect of what the Americans are<br />
doing. The other of course is that they have sent their<br />
naval forces in to attempt to give effect to the<br />
sanctions of the United Nations. It is in association<br />
with the United States and other countries that our naval<br />
forces have gone in that exercise. It would be a matter<br />
really of in what capacity and in what respect the United<br />
States was contemplating any further action, but I've<br />
made it quite clear, and I'm sure that this is what the<br />
SAustralian people would want, that if in fact any upping<br />
of the Australian involvement was to be sought, then I<br />
would obviously consult as widely as I could, not only<br />
within my own Party but I would consult with the Leader<br />
of the Opposition and the matter would go to Cabinet.<br />
STANLEY: Alright Prime Minister, I know you've got a<br />
very busy day. Thank you very much for joining us this<br />
afternoon. PM: It's been my pleasure. Thank you very much.<br />
ends </p>
