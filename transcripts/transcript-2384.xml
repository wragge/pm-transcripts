PRESS) RAD! O AND TV INTER VIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR WILLIAM MCMAHON AT<br />
LIBERAL PARTY HEADQUARTERS, CANBERRA 12 MARCH 1971<br />
Q. Prime Minister, can you confirm any rumours or<br />
speculation about Ministebal appointments, for example Mr Fairbairn<br />
as Foreign Minister?<br />
PM: I can't confirm anything yet because I have not<br />
made up my mind. I can't say that I cannot, but you will this<br />
afternoon be getting a statement on administrative changes that is,<br />
the changes in the structure of Departments. There will be the<br />
abolidtbn of two Departments and the formation of two new Departments.<br />
As soon as this matter is cleared with the Governor-General, you will<br />
get a statement.<br />
Q. Having in mind, Sir, that we will be going to air<br />
at 6~. 30, could you outline them for me now?<br />
PM: No, I can't. You will get it in time to go on air<br />
at 6.<br />
Q. Sir, can you say what will be the main topics you<br />
will be discussing here at the Liberal Party?<br />
PM: Mainly the organis akin, because I believe the<br />
organisation has to run in parallel with the Parliamentary Party.<br />
I want them to be independent, completely independent ind to be able<br />
to give us independent advice as to what they think we ought to do,<br />
r heir evaluation of what the public is thinking, and the best advice they<br />
can give us in the interests of the Party as a whole.<br />
Q. Has the machine itself been rather run down, low<br />
morale<br />
P M: I never like to look at the past and I am not interested<br />
in the past. What I am interested in is making certain that it is part and<br />
parcel of the Liberal Party and has an equal right to express its opinions<br />
together with the Cabinet and the Parliamentary Party.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you said last night that you may not<br />
be announcing changes in the Ministry for possibly another two months now.<br />
Isn't there a risk that this will cause some dissent within the Ministry,<br />
that people won't know what their situation will be? / 2 </p>
<p>PM: You can't do the impossible, and I will have to<br />
explain it to the Party, and if there is any forecast or any attempt<br />
to try to create trouble, then I will immediately state my opinion,<br />
I will immediately say whether their forecasts are right or wrong.<br />
But most of the time it will be that they are wrong because I won't<br />
make up my mind and convey my decisiors to anyone else until I am<br />
ready to make it available to the Press ard to the other media.<br />
Q. Sir, could I address a question to Mr Southey?<br />
What would you like to talk to Mr McMahon about?<br />
Mr Southey I also have organisational matters to discuss with him.<br />
I called on him yesterday morning to offer him the undivided loyalty<br />
of the Party organisation throughout Australia. This I will reaffirm<br />
today and we will go on from there.<br />
