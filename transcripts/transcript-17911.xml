The Federal Government today released new reports that clearly show Australia is not acting alone or ahead of other countries when it comes to action on climate change. </p>
<p>Fact sheets prepared by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency show many countries, including all the major emitters, are acting now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The fact sheets show a broad range of countries have introduced or are planning market based emissions trading schemes and carbon taxes.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet released the fact sheets today, which confirm Australia is one of the world's top 20 polluters.</p>
<p>We release more pollution per person than any other country in the developed world.</p>
<p>It is yet further evidence confirming we have a national and global responsibility to act.</p>
<p>The fact sheets show the Gillard Labor Government's move to put a price on carbon follows similar steps in many countries, with others planning or in the process of introducing similar arrangements. </p>
<p>For example, Australia's top five trading partners - China, Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea and India and another six of our top twenty trading partners have implemented or are piloting carbon trading or taxation schemes.</p>
<p>The European Union has had an emissions trading scheme since 2005, which covers half a billion people.</p>
<p>China has announced it will introduce emissions trading progressively in a number of key cities and provinces, including Beijing and Shanghai, which cover more than 100 million people.</p>
<p>These fact sheets set the record straight on the level of international action on climate change and where Australia is positioned in comparison.</p>
<p>Australia is not going it alone on climate change  -  we are taking the right steps along with many other countries to protect the planet for generations to come.</p>
<p>The fact sheets also support last week's findings from the Productivity Commission confirming the world is increasingly acting on climate change and that a carbon price is the lowest-cost way to cut pollution.</p>
<p>These reports also highlight that far from striking out on its own, Australia risks falling behind the rest of the world if we fail to put a price on pollution. </p>
<p>The fact sheets also point to the high levels of investment internationally in clean and renewable energy.</p>
<p>For example, India has a clean energy tax on coal that will raise more than half a billion dollars of revenue for clean technology development in its first 12 months.</p>
<p>In 2010, global investment in the clean energy sector totalled US$243 billion, including $54.4 billion in China and $34 billion in the US.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is committed to maximising the opportunities that come from moving to a clean energy future.</p>
<p>Introducing a carbon price in Australia will make dirty energy more expensive and clean energy like solar, gas and wind cheaper.</p>
<p>The carbon price will apply to less than 1,000 big polluters, requiring them to pay for every tonne of carbon pollution that they emit.</p>
<p>This is the most effective and cheapest way for us to build a clean energy economy and protect our precious natural environment for future generations.</p>
