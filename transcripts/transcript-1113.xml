COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 65/ 079<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON THE<br />
SECOND READING<br />
OF THE<br />
UNIVERSITIES ( FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)<br />
BILL 1965<br />
[ Front the " Parliamentary Debates," 18th May 1965]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 8.11-I move-<br />
That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />
In October 1963, the Parliament passed an<br />
act to provide finance for universities in thc<br />
various States during the calendar years<br />
1965 and 1966. In November 1964,<br />
* Parliament amended that act to make<br />
some additional provision for higher<br />
academic salaries in State universities during<br />
1964. The present Bill is for the purpose<br />
A~ a mending the previous legislation in order<br />
1 make more Commonwealth funds availate<br />
in respect of the three years 1964, 1965<br />
and 1966. More finance is necessary to<br />
increase the capital grants to universities folfollowing<br />
the Government's acceptance of<br />
the recommendations in the Tertiary Education<br />
Committee report, and to provide for<br />
increases in recurrent costs resulting from<br />
acceptance of the increases in academic<br />
salaries which were recommended last year<br />
in the Eggleston report. Funds are also<br />
required to give effect to the Government's<br />
583 1/ 65 decision to support an increase in fees paid<br />
to part-time academic staff, and to provide<br />
further amounts for research in State<br />
universities. As recommended by the Tertiary Education<br />
Committee, the Commonwealth will<br />
meet half the cost of certain additional<br />
capital works to be undertaken during the<br />
next 18 months at the following universities<br />
-Macquarie, La Trobe, Bedford Park,<br />
Newcastle, Townsville University Collegeand<br />
for a start on a second university institution<br />
in the Brisbane area. The total value of<br />
these works is Å 2,450,000 of which the<br />
Commonwealth will pay 1,225,000. The Bill<br />
makes provision for the Commonwealth<br />
contribution. Honorable members will recall<br />
that in November 1964, following consideration<br />
by the Parliament of the<br />
Eggleston report, an amendment was made<br />
to the Universities ( Financial Assistance)<br />
Act 1963 to permit payment of the estimated<br />
cost of increased academic salaries during<br />
1964. We have since obtained from the </p>
<p>Australian Universities Commission precise<br />
figures for each State university for each<br />
of the years 1964, 1965 and 1966, and the<br />
present Bill revises the interim grants for<br />
1964 and increases the grants for<br />
1965 and 1966.<br />
The Government has now decided to support<br />
higher fees for part-time academic staff<br />
commencing from 1st July 1965. The Commonwealth<br />
is prepared to join with any<br />
State in providing funds to support a maximum<br />
fee of Å 6 per hour for part-time lecturers,<br />
together with appropriate rates for<br />
other part-time academic staff. Where a<br />
State decides on a lower fee, that will be<br />
the limit to our support. This decision is<br />
in accord with the advice of the Universities<br />
Commission and the revised First Schedule<br />
to the Act incorporates the higher rates for<br />
both full-time and part-time academic staff.<br />
In October 1963, the Parliament also provided<br />
Å 500,000 as the Commonwealth's half<br />
share of funds to be specially set aside for<br />
research in State universities. This money<br />
was used during 1964 for post-graduate<br />
research activities, which are closely bound<br />
up with post-graduate training. The Government<br />
is now proposing that a like amount<br />
be provided for the same purposes during<br />
each of the years 1965 and 1966. The total<br />
cost to the Commonwealth over the three<br />
years will be Å 1.5 million, and the distribution<br />
among the State universities will be as<br />
the Universities Commission has recommended.<br />
The final provision in this Bill to which<br />
I wish to refer is the recognition of the<br />
Univcrsity of Newcastle in its own right. It will be remembered that in response to a<br />
request from the Government of New South<br />
Wales, the Government has agreed to<br />
recognise the independence of Newcastle<br />
from 1st January 1965. The Bill does this<br />
by making provision in the schedules for<br />
the University of Newcastle to the extent<br />
contemplated when that institution was part<br />
of the University of New South Wales, and<br />
the sums set aside for the University of New<br />
South Wales have been adjusted accordingly.<br />
The amendments now before the House<br />
require Commonwealth grants for State universities<br />
of Å 6,947,000 above those<br />
originally made for the years 1964, 1965<br />
and 1966. The total Commonwealth contribution<br />
to State universities over those<br />
three years will now be about Å 64 milli<br />
In conclusion I point out to the H1<br />
that we arc not proposing any funds in this<br />
Bill in support of teaching costs in medical<br />
hospitals. I shall explain why that is so. A<br />
report from the Universities ComMissi<br />
was presented to the Government a few d m<br />
ago, but there has been no opporit 0<br />
take decisions and carry them forward into<br />
this Bill. Nevertheless, I assure the House<br />
that the Government will deal with this<br />
matter promptly, and I know that the<br />
House will agree that when we are ready<br />
to announce our decisions we should do so<br />
for the benefit of all concerned, without<br />
waiting for resumption of the Parliament.<br />
Honorable members will see what I mean<br />
by that. Normally, one would wait until the<br />
House was sitting, but as there will be an<br />
interval, the sooner these decisions are q<br />
known, the better. I commend the Bill to M<br />
House.<br />
