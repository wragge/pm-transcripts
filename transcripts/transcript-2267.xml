Premiers' Conference<br />
Opening Statement by Prime Minister<br />
It is only a little more than two months since we<br />
last met in Premiers' Conference to discuss the budgetary<br />
situation then facing you in 1970-71o For myself, I carried<br />
away from that meeting a feeling of genuine achievement.<br />
The Commonwealth had, I felt, by its offer to provide special<br />
revenue assistance of some $ 43 million, gone a long way<br />
towards meeting the residual problem with which the States,<br />
even after the efforts they had made in the preceding month<br />
or so, were still faced.<br />
So indeed it has proved. Information about your<br />
expected financial outcome for 1970-71 ( and for 1971-72,<br />
which I shall come to later) has been supplied to us by you<br />
and your Treasury officers and I would like to digress for<br />
a moment to express the Commonwealth's real appreciation<br />
for the ready co-operation you and they have displayed. I<br />
know that the Treasurer would join me in that expression of<br />
thanks, The information for 1970-71 which you have supplied<br />
indicates that, compared with the situation prior to the<br />
April Conference, there has been an improvement of over<br />
million in the States' revenue and loan accounts. The<br />
special revenue assistance which we provided accounted, of<br />
course, for the larger part of that, some $ 43 million. In </p>
<p>addition, the financial assistance grants payable to the States<br />
under the formula have turned out to be some $ 13.2 million<br />
higher than they had been estimated to be at that time a<br />
fact of which, I understand, you were advised last week.<br />
Finally, the estimates for all but one State show some<br />
improvement, quite apart from these two factors, over the<br />
estimates supplied last Aprilo Overall, whereas last April<br />
the States as a whole had appeared to be facing deficits on<br />
revenue and loan accounts combined of over $ 70 million, on<br />
the present estimates the combined result, taking the States<br />
as a whole, will be a virtual balance<br />
All in all, Gentlemen, I think that is not a<br />
bad outcome from what has obviously been a situation fraught<br />
with difficulty for all parties, both the States and the<br />
Commonwealth. When I recall that in bringing down their own<br />
budgets the States actually budgeted for a deficit of nearly<br />
$ 33 million on combined revenue and loan accounts; and when<br />
I recall also that the effects on State finances of postbudget<br />
wage awards in 1970-71 have been of the order of $ 100<br />
million, I think the outcome that has actually been achieved<br />
is striking. Now I hasten to add that I am well aware that this<br />
outcome has not been achieved without cost. In part it has<br />
been achieved at the cost of the Commonwealth, with<br />
consequences for our own budget and the economy that I shall<br />
come to later. In part, however indeed, in somewhat larger<br />
part it has been achieved at the cost of sharp cut-backs in </p>
<p>one field or another of State expenditures or, to a much<br />
lesser degree, of increases in State taxation. Those are<br />
the measures, one might say, of the wage inflation that has<br />
been imposed upon State Governments in 1970-71 by circumstances<br />
largely beyond their control. We would all recognise that the<br />
outcome is not, in that sense, a happy one.<br />
So much for the 1970-71 position. Since the<br />
April Conference, however, the States have re-examined their<br />
prospects for 1971-72 and the figures submitted to us in<br />
that regard show a rather depressing picture. In short,<br />
the " full year" effects of the extraordinary wage awards<br />
made this year will mean that the States will face in 1971-72<br />
no less than $ 170 million of additional expenditures on that<br />
score alone, over and above the very large increase already<br />
suffered from that factor in 1970-71. This clearly means that<br />
the States must inevitably face a very difficult year.<br />
In passing, Iwantto underline one point. It relates<br />
particularly to the field of the State budgets, but also to a<br />
very large extent to our own Commonwealth budget.<br />
1970-71 has been a year characterized by increased<br />
wage awards of a startling kind. It is not too much to say<br />
that this factor alone has served to unhinge the budgets<br />
of public authorities throughout Australia at all levels of<br />
government. It will continue to do so through its " full year"<br />
effects in 1971-72. I cannot too strongly stress the<br />
gravity with which the Commonwealth contemplates that situation.<br />
To return to the situation facing the States in<br />
1971-72, no doubt the figures that you have supplied to us<br />
could be debated here and there at the margin; but broadly </p>
<p>speaking I can say that we accept them as constituting, to all<br />
intents and purposes, a good indication of the order of<br />
magnitude of the problems you are all facing. No doubt you<br />
will all have something more to say about that when we come<br />
to hear you on the positions of your own States.<br />
We are, believe me, very conscious of the<br />
problems you are facing. It is true that, with luck, 1971-72<br />
may prove to be a passing phenomenon for the States indeed<br />
it would be hard to contemplate another such year in 1972-73.<br />
If so, that may provide a basis for lifting our eyes a<br />
little beyond 1971-72 itself, and regarding the problems of<br />
that year as somewhat more manageable, viewed from that<br />
wider perspective, than perhaps they might appear if we<br />
concentrate upon them alone. That, however, is as may be<br />
the States' financial problems in 1971-72 will be difficult<br />
viewed from any standpoint, and you should know that we<br />
acknoiledge that fact fully.<br />
That, very naturally, is the problem as the States<br />
see it. We in the Commonwealth see it too, but see also<br />
an over-riding economic problem. I refer in particular to<br />
our own budgetary position, and the serious situation<br />
confronting us in the field of general management of the<br />
economy. As to our own budget, not only shall we finish<br />
this present financial year with expenditures sharply up,<br />
and our overall position appreciably worse, by comparison with<br />
what we had budgeted for last August, but also the outlook </p>
<p>for 1971-72 is, to say the least, grim. In large part<br />
because of the sharp increase in our payments to the States,<br />
associated in particular with the compensation for cessation<br />
of receipts duty revenue and with the special revenue<br />
assistance we have provided, our expenditures in 1970-71<br />
seem likely to be of the order of $ 1,000 million up on<br />
1969-70. Revenues will be up also; but not commensurately,<br />
and our overall position will, as I say, show a marked<br />
deterioration from what we had provided for last August.<br />
As to 1971-72, it is of course too early to be<br />
able to gain a fully considered picture of our own budget<br />
outlook. At this point of time we are still in process of<br />
considering the expenditure " bids" submitted by Departments,<br />
based as those purport to be solely on existing policies.<br />
The Treasurer will have his pruning knife out with respect<br />
even to those figures; but, without entering upon the detail<br />
of them at this time, I can say that the prospective position<br />
they reveal with respect to the likely growth in Commonwealth<br />
expenditure in 1971-72 even in the absence of any of the new<br />
spending policies which are being pressed upon us from all sides<br />
( including, I have no doubt, the policy of assistance to<br />
yourselves which you will be pressing upon us) is nothing short<br />
of alarming. So far from reining in the increase in our<br />
expenditures, which is and must be the central objective of<br />
our budgetary policy at this time, it is clear that we shall<br />
have to exercise the most extreme restraint if we are to hold<br />
the increase below that which has occurred in 1970-71. </p>
<p>Such an increase in Commonwealth expenditures<br />
would, in my mind, give rise to sharp questioning at any time.<br />
It would be doubly open to question in the context of our<br />
present economic situation and prospect. In brief compass,<br />
that situation is that inflationary pressures have not abated.<br />
Overall demand is increasing strongly with continuing strong<br />
escalation of costs and prices, and the public sector is<br />
contributing more than proportionately to that position.<br />
Such a situation, if allowed to continue, and particularly given<br />
the possibility that increased demand from other quarters<br />
could also eventuate, would be fraught with consequences for<br />
the economy of the gravest possible kind. You will therefore<br />
readily see why I say that, in this context, the prospective<br />
increases which are being foreshadowed in our own expenditures<br />
are nothing short of alarming. As to these questions of the<br />
budgetary and economic situations, you may want to hear<br />
further from the Treasurer. All I will say further at this<br />
time is that, in these circumstances, we conceive it to be<br />
the first and foremost duty of the Commonwealth to provide<br />
leadership in contesting this obviously disturbing state of<br />
affairs. It has necessarily been against this background of<br />
our own budgetary difficulties and our continuing concern<br />
with the overall economic situation, that we have been looking<br />
at the whole question of a growth tax for the States which<br />
would assist you in meeting your own difficulties. I say at<br />
the outset that we see a lot of advantage in the States having </p>
<p>access to a new and broadly based tax field. We have,<br />
consequently, made a wide-ranging study of the whole field<br />
of possibilities. One point to emerge quite early in such a study<br />
is, of course, that there are various constraints upon the<br />
possibilities. For example, and in some ways most<br />
importantly, the constitutional position clearly debars the<br />
States from imposing virtually any form of sales tax<br />
( including, so far as we can see, a value added tax). The<br />
unhappy history of the receipts duty is a salutary lesson.<br />
Nor would such a tax imposed by the Commonwealth on behalf<br />
of the States ( which would have to be imposed at a uniform<br />
rate throughout the Commonwealth) offer a satisfactory<br />
alternative to the States. Indeed we have always regarded<br />
any State growth tax, to be at all satisfactory, as necessarily<br />
offering the possibility of variations in their own rates by<br />
individual States that wish to do so.<br />
That narrows the field considerably. We have, as<br />
I say, looked in detail at the remainder of the field but,<br />
for one reason or another we find ourselves forced to the<br />
conclusion that there are in fact only two areas which offer<br />
scope for any move of this kind. The first is personal income<br />
tax and the second is the pay-roll tax.<br />
As to the first, that is income tax, we have given<br />
close study to the possibilities, as indeed we have on several<br />
earlier occasions, and have come to the view that it would<br />
not be advisable to re-open the field of personal income tax to </p>
<p>the States. I doubt if much useful purpose will be served by<br />
going in detail into the pros and the cons as we see them.<br />
Our decision is, of course, based upon general grounds; I add,<br />
however, that it has particular pertinence in the economic and<br />
financial circumstances which we find confronting us at present.<br />
The Commonwealth has therefore closely examined<br />
what appears to be the sole remaining possibility, namely<br />
that of giving the States access to the field of pay-roll tax.<br />
We recognise that, from some viewpoints, this may not in<br />
itself be regarded as an ideal tax although we also believe<br />
that a good many of the arguments commonly brought against it<br />
are not well-founded. In particular, the argument that it<br />
adds to costs can, broadly speaking, be applied to all taxes.<br />
However, it is broadly based, grows almost directly in line<br />
with the economy, would be relatively simple to administer I,<br />
( partly because employers already draw up returns on a State<br />
basis) and certainly offers some prospect for raising<br />
additional revenue should States wish to use it for that<br />
purpose. We have therefore, after full and thorough<br />
examination, decided that if the States would like to have<br />
access to this additional taxation field, the Commonwealth<br />
would be prepared to withdraw from the field completely ( apart<br />
from levying a similar tax within our own Territories). In<br />
doing so, arrangements would be made to ensure, at the<br />
Commonwealth's expense, continuation of the export incentive<br />
scheme based on the present pay-roll tax rate of 2' per cent. </p>
<p>In withdrawing from the field of pay-roll tax, the<br />
Commcnwealth could not of course contemplate the loss of<br />
revenue involved and we would therefore propose to offset<br />
that loss, subject to some qualifications which I shall come<br />
to in a moment, by commensurate reductions in the financial<br />
assistance grants.<br />
In considering the amount of those reductions, we<br />
would be prepared to take into account three points:<br />
The additional cost to the States in<br />
administering the new tax, which would, of<br />
course, be minor.<br />
The fact that, since revenues from pay-roll<br />
tax at constant rates would probably grow<br />
slightly more slowly than the financial<br />
assistance grants the States would be losing<br />
would have done, the reduction in the grants<br />
" base" for 1972-73 and subsequent years would<br />
need to be adjusted accordingly. ( There would<br />
be no effect of this kind in 1971-72 and the<br />
grants arrangements as a vrhole are, of course,<br />
subject to review in four years' time.); and<br />
Having in mind the state of the finances of<br />
some local authorities, the States might well<br />
feel that, once the pay-roll tax became a State<br />
tax, they would find it difficult to continue<br />
levying it upon the non-business activities of<br />
local authorities. If so, there would of course </p>
<p>be some loss of revenue involved, and in that<br />
case the Commonwealth would regard it as doing<br />
the fair thing if it were to share as to half<br />
in that loss.<br />
On this approach what the Commonwealth would, in<br />
effect, be doing is to hand over to the States the pay-roll<br />
tax on the basis that, while levying the tax at the present<br />
rate, they would be unaffected financially by the transfer except<br />
in so far of course as they join us in relieving local<br />
authorities from payment of the tax in respect of their<br />
non-business activities. The States would of course stand to<br />
benefit from the scope for raising additional revenue that the<br />
new tax, once in their own hands, would give them.<br />
That, Gentlemen, is at this stage the sum and<br />
substance of the Commonwealth's offer in this matter. The<br />
question to which I think we need an answer is whether the<br />
States would wish to take advantage of this offer. In order<br />
to assist you and your officers in your consideration of<br />
that question, we are now circulating a document in which<br />
fuller details of a scheme along the lines I have suggested<br />
are set out. </p>
