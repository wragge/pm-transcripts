PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The findings bliat emerged from the tabling of the Costigan Repoxt<br />
in Parliament last Tuesday must be a matter of the utmost<br />
concern for all Australians. Indeed, the initiative takon by<br />
thre Federal Government and the Victorian Liberal Government in<br />
commissioning Mr. Costigan to investigate the activities of the<br />
Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union has been fully justified<br />
by what his report has revealed.<br />
Much has been said about the revelation5 concerning tax avoidance<br />
and the deficiencies of the Crown Solicitors office. The Governmeonlt,<br />
haa acted with vigour and determination on both of these m~ atters.<br />
LVven berore this report was completed, the Governmnr had3<br />
taken action on 26 occasions through over 20 pieces of<br />
legislation against over 50 schemes of tax avoidance and evasion.<br />
This is-indeed in sharp contrast to the record of Labor when it<br />
was in office and indeed when Mr. Haydeni was Treasurer, a period<br />
which saw the explosion of the tax avoidance industry and its<br />
encouragement by the inaction of the Labor government.<br />
Perhaps one ought to reflect for a m~ oment on the boost the tax<br />
avoidance industry was given by Labor's refusal to act on the<br />
Curran Scheme.<br />
But the aspects of Mr. Costigan' s findings which are of eqiial<br />
concern are those which relate to the activities of the painters<br />
and dockers themselves. Mr. Costigan nioted that " in Victoria,<br />
the Union is under the control of hardened criminals". He<br />
referxred to " some 15 murders that took place between 1970 and<br />
1979, ' Their answer to any interference with their activities<br />
is not to use the processes of law but rather threats, violenc e<br />
and intimidation", and " in this way the painters and dockers<br />
have assumed for themselves a position outside the law and have<br />
-maintained that position by violence".<br />
Hc~ wever, the criminality of the orz nistion and th e.~ tnp<br />
that it treats the most basic institutions in our society was<br />
most acutely demonstrated by an assertion that the Union's Federal<br />
Secretary, Mr. Gor-don made at the Sweeney Royal Commission. He<br />
said " We catch and kill our Own". Those six words speak for<br />
themselves. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Commonwealth Government has acted with great vigour in<br />
responding to the findings of the Royal Commission. We have<br />
already instituted a number of far-sighted and effective measures<br />
including the decision to appoint a special prosecutor and<br />
task force, the suspension of two officers of the Crown Solicitor's<br />
Perth office named in the Report, the commissioning of the President<br />
of the Law Council of Australia to examine the Perth office, the<br />
appointment of counsel to assist in advancing particular prosecutions<br />
and the urgent examination of S. 16 of the Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act relating to secrecy.<br />
It must therefore be obvious that in response to the Costigan Report<br />
the Commonwealth has now acted swiftly and effectively. Not so the<br />
Victorian Government.<br />
The Report brings to the fore the most horrifying picture of an<br />
organisation whose activities Australians would think belonged to<br />
another world. The Victorian Government has before it a most. grave<br />
and serious challenge. I can only hope that Mr. Cain pursues<br />
the cleaning up of the painters and dockers, " the hardened<br />
criminals" as Mr. Costigan refers to them, with the same enthusiasm<br />
and endeavour that he has talked about pursuing tax avoidance.<br />
Mr. Cain must not allow the fact that the Union is affiliated to<br />
the A. L. P. to influence his actions. It is indeed of immense<br />
concern that the Union should to this day remain an affiliate<br />
of the Victorian sending representation to the State<br />
Conference and being a participant in the supreme policy making<br />
body of that A. L. P. branch. If such an organisation were affiliated<br />
to the Liberal Party I would immediately act to ensure that such<br />
association was repudiated.<br />
It is also disturbing to note that two Labor senators revealed last<br />
Thursday that the painters and dockers are also an affiliate of<br />
the NSW and Qld branches of the Labor Party. Indeed, Senator<br />
Georges' statement " that he was aggrieved by some wild remarks<br />
made about the Ship Painters and Dockers Union" would be listened<br />
to with horror by every decent Australian.<br />
In the light of such revelations, the threat made by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition on Thursday to table the reports supplied to<br />
him in confidence by the Royal Commissioner is all the more<br />
remarkable. It should be made clear that the Government has not<br />
tabled these reports at the request of the Royal Commissioner<br />
in order that his continuing investigations are not prejudiced.<br />
Mr. Hayden's statement that " if the Prime Minister seeks to<br />
associate the Labor Party with the painters and dockers in<br />
the way in which he is about to I will find myself no longer<br />
bound to confidentiality" is most curious. His own senators<br />
tell us of this affiliation.<br />
I&amp; it then to be piesumed tht the Leader o the Opposition Was<br />
prepared to endanger the important continuing investigations of<br />
Commissioner Costigan on the basis of seeking to suppress<br />
information which his own senators made public?<br />
