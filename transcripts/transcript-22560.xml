    <content><![CDATA[<p>In light of the serious water situation in the Murray Darling Basin, I have invited Premiers Iemma, Bracks and Rann and their Water Ministers to a meeting in Canberra next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The prolonged drought is having a terrible impact on farming communities across Australia.</p>
<p>This is being compounded by water inflows to date in 2006-07 that have been significantly below historical minimal levels.</p>
<p>Water storages and allocations are managed differently among the states.</p>
<p>NSW has announced the suspension of water trading in the NSW Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys due to the on-going dry conditions.</p>
<p>Together with Premiers Iemma, Bracks and Rann I would like to explore the outlook for water delivery and to work together to develop contingencies for town and rural water supplies.</p>
<p>My objective in calling this meeting is to agree on actions to provide the best possible outcome for water users at this difficult time.</p>
