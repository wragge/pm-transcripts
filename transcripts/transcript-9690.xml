PRIME MINISTER 78/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SENATOR ALSTON'S ATTACK ON MY WIFE<br />
Senator Alston's attack on my wife, Annita, over her role as the patron of the<br />
Sydney Symphony Orchestra's European tour exposes the low, vindictive quality<br />
of Liberal Party politics. It is a churlish smear the hallmark of the modern<br />
Liberal Party.<br />
My wife was invited to accompany the orchestra on its first European tour in<br />
years; to act as its patron on the tour, and thereby to promote the tour, the<br />
orchestra and Australia. She is proud to be able to assist the orchestra in this<br />
way just as the management of the orchestra is delighted that she is able to<br />
accompany them in her official capacity as the Prime Minister's wife.<br />
During the tour, Annita will do all she can to promote the orchestra, through<br />
publicity, by attending formal receptions for the orchestra, and by attending, and<br />
sometimes introducing, concerts.<br />
Her role on this tour will be similar to her role as a Government representative at<br />
the Barcelona Olympics, and her role as an advocate for the Sydney Olympic bid<br />
at Monte Carlo.<br />
That Senator Alston should have used my wife's involvement in this important<br />
cultural project to attack her and through her, me is typically sleazy. As the<br />
Shadow Minister for Communications and the Arts, he should hang his head in<br />
shame. His leader, John Howard, should dissociate himself from Alston's tactics<br />
and rebuke him, or stand accused of condoning him.<br />
Contrary to today's breathless account in The Sydney Morning Herald, no<br />
$ 1 ,000-a-night hotel rooms and no $ 4,000 limousines have been booked. Any<br />
costs associated with Mrs Keating's official travel will be duly collated and tabled<br />
in Parliament in the usual manner for all such travel by Federal Government<br />
representatives. In answer to one of Senator Alston's insulting questions: Mrs<br />
Keating will not receive a cent of remuneration for her work as a cultural<br />
ambassador on the tour.<br />
I would have hoped The Sydney Morning Herald would have displayed more<br />
support for such an exciting and challenging tour by this great Sydney and<br />
Australian cultural institution.<br />
