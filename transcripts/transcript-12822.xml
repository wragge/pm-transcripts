Speaking today at the APEC Leaders CEO Summit in Los Cabos, the Prime Minister John  Howard announced that Australia will grant tariff and quota free access for 50 of the poorest countries.<br />
The world';s poorest people in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) such as Bangladesh, Cambodia and many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, will benefit from this initiative.  East Timor, which has yet to be formally designated a Least Developed Country by the United Nations, will also receive tariff-free access under the scheme.<br />
For over 25 years, Australia has provided generous preferential market access for the world';s poorest countries, in recognition that their integration into the world economy requires meaningful market access.  This Australian initiative demonstrates further our commitment to opening markets to the poorest countries to help them trade their way out of poverty.<br />
This initiative sends a signal to the rest of the world that we are serious about getting the most disadvantaged to share the fruits of trade liberalization.<br />
The initiative will be implemented swiftly, with access free from tariffs and quotas becoming available to LDCs and East Timor on 1 July, 2003. </p>
