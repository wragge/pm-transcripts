PRIME MINISTER MONDAY, 23 MARCH 1981<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC'S " NEWSV0YCE"<br />
Poland's Free Trade Union leaders will be meeting in a few<br />
hours time to discuss the latest moves in their threatened*<br />

Mark Colvin.<br />
The National Executive of the Australian Labor Party has been<br />
meeting all day in Canberra in a bid to solve the Party's<br />
internal problems in Queensland. The Exectuive is expected<br />
to release a series of recommendations within the hour.<br />
Report from Barrie Cassidy.<br />
Mrs Flo Bjelke-Petersen arrived in Canberra today intent on<br />
dispelling her image as a scone maker and becoming, as she<br />
put it, a political person. Report from Greg Powell. a<br />
Australia's award winning actress Judy Davis says there is a<br />
great future for Australian films as long as they are made<br />
on universal themes. Judy Davis has won the British Academy<br />
Award for Best Actress and Best Newcomer.<br />
The Annual Thorn, Awards presented in Canberra today saw a<br />
clash between the Minister for Communications and the major<br />
award winner, Mr Laurie Oakes. Report from Heather Ewart.<br />
Heather Ewart<br />
The clash was over Mr Oake's leaking of the last Federal Budget<br />
on which he did a report for channel 10 television news.<br />
Mr Sinclair-had earlier stressed the importance and power<br />
of tel-evision news which he described as a rough draft<br />
of history being caught on the television screen. Despite<br />
Mr Sinclair's praise of the fairness and professionalism<br />
of Australian telek-Ã± sion journalists, he did not hestitate<br />
to state that he did not agree with the major Thorn award<br />
being presented to Mr Oakes for his budget report.<br />
Mr Sinclair<br />
Certainly, in all we have a very professional group of people<br />
who are here represented today whom all of us a politicians<br />
or elsewhere in the public forum respect. Certainly, no<br />
one of us would expect any of you to be eunichs in the<br />
political zoo. But there are aspects of political involvement.<br />
that from the Government and Opposition benches alike we<br />
criticise from time to time. Those documents that fall off<br />
the back of the truck from the other side tend to be used<br />
in Parliament and they tend to be used by the media. The<br />
major award is for such an ' occasion. I respect very much<br />
the fact that the panel of,: judges as an independent body<br />
and I really do not envy their task one little bit. I<br />
respect very much the man who has received the award, but<br />
my own assessments of the requirements of television journalism<br />
I / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
would not accord with the judgement they have given..<br />
LaurieQakes I think there are a few things .1I should reply-to. Some<br />
people say what was the point of breaking the Budget story.<br />
two days before delivery. I think the point is obvious.*<br />
There is an old journalistic tradition and that tradition<br />
is being first with the news. That is what this was about. arnd<br />
I regard this award as recognition of that tradition and 0<br />
therefore I am very proud to receive it.<br />
Authors and publishers in Australia will soon get compensation<br />
for works photocopied by schools and universities. Detailsof<br />
the scheme were announced by the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser,<br />
while speaking at the opening of thelnternational Booksellers<br />
Federation Congress.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I understand that the safe guarding of copyright is one of the<br />
matters you will be discussing at this Congress. My Government<br />
has recently been giving renewed attention to this major issue<br />
as it is affected by photocopying. The changes which we are<br />
making will come into effect on 1. July this year or as soon<br />
as possible after that,-* as soon as time has been allowed for<br />
the necessary preparations : are made. What we are doing<br />
is to establish a system of to Australian authors and publishers<br />
for the muliple copying of their. works in ecucational institutions.<br />
Delegates of this congress can be assured that while this Government'<br />
recognises the importance of the right of freedom to publish,<br />
the Government also recognises the principle of the protection<br />
of copyright.<br />
The Opposition Spokesman on Industrial Relations, Mr Hawke,<br />
has-. agreed in principle with the proposal from the West<br />
Australian Premier, Sir Charles Court, for a national inquir-y<br />
Anto industrial relations. But, Mr Hawke stressed that the<br />
inquiry should hamze a constructive purpose with fair terms<br />
of reference. Sir Charles Court has suggested sweeping<br />
changes to the industrial relations system including the<br />
application of civil law to the industrial process, simultaneous<br />
court control union ballots and a time limit to settlement<br />
of disputes. Report from Naree Creed.<br />
Bob'Hawke There is no doubt there are features of industrial relations<br />
in Australia on the part of trade unions, employers and<br />
governments including Sir Charles Court's own Government<br />
which need improvement and if the inquiry is set up without<br />
in the beginning attributing and saying our industrial<br />
relations,, problemb are all the fault of the trade unions<br />
or if you-like all the fauilt of the employers, then I can<br />
see the possibility of some useful purpose.* But, I do want<br />
to emphasise Naree that it is going to be counter productive 2 </p>
<p>3<br />
if indeed it is postulated on the premise that the problem<br />
of bad industrial relations is simply a function of attitudes<br />
of trade unionism.<br />
The New South Wales Government today -released an environmental<br />
study that cost them $ 1 million, but is they say ' one<br />
of the most comprehensive'study's every carried out in<br />
Australia. The study will, be carried out on Botany Bay.<br />
