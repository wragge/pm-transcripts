F PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANDREW ROBB<br />
Andrew Robb' s departure as federal director is a great loss to the Liberal Party. He<br />
has been an outstanding director and played a key role as campaign director in the<br />
highly successful 1996 federal election campaign.<br />
I have greatly valued Andrew's quiet but effective management style, his patient<br />
handling of internal organisational matters and his sensible political advice.<br />
He has served our party for just on ten years and has experienced both the highs and<br />
lows of political life.<br />
One of his particular attributes was a keen appreciation of the views of the business<br />
commnunity on policy and political issues.<br />
Although I greatly regret that his services as federal director will no longer be<br />
available to the Liberal Party, I wish him well in the business career he now<br />
proposes to pursue. I amn re-assured that his counsel will still be available, albeit in<br />
somewhat different circumstances.<br />
Janette joins me in wishing Andrew, Maureen and their children the very best for<br />
the future.<br />
24 April 1997<br />
