PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC ' WORLD TODAY, MONDAY,<br />
18 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
FK: Prime Minister, you have accused the Liberal party of now being bereft<br />
of policies, but isn't it truer to say that they are-just moving closer to<br />
yours?<br />
PM: No, their strategy is to have no policy. This is a very strange political<br />
party which has actually had a weekend meeting to develop a strategy<br />
to have no policies. ' Fightback' the policy which they said was too<br />
good to be changed, which Dr Hewson said he would resign over if it<br />
was changed is now, he said, dead and buried and had they won the<br />
1993 election he would be putting it into place. So, the policies which<br />
he said were critical to Australia and Australians he would have, had<br />
he won the election, be now implementing, he has now said are dead<br />
and buried, they were wrong and they don't need them. So, basically<br />
what's happened to the Liberal party is it's now given up on policy and<br />
is picking up themes. Whenever you hear a conservative party<br />
running on law and order, the Queen, the monarchy, the flag, all that's<br />
happened to the Liberal party is it's getting further and further back<br />
towards 1954.<br />
FK: But what they spent their time yesterday saying was that the time has<br />
moved on now for the economic stuff, that the recovery is in place and<br />
now it is time to focus on the social implications of high unemployment,<br />
building bridges with the minority groups. Now, you and your voters<br />
would have to support that as a focus wouldn't you, that's the way you<br />
go?<br />
PM: We don't have to support that as a focus. We are the focus. I was the<br />
person who introducing ' One Nation' said this was a policy of social<br />
inclusion. I used the wora-' Tnclusion' there, I used the word ' inclusion'<br />
in the speech on election night and right through the course of the<br />
eighteen months up to the election when I was Prime Minister and </p>
<p>since. When John Hewson talks about inclusion he is thinking of<br />
something which will include him. When he talks about consensus he<br />
is thinking of a consensus about his leadership. The consensus is, as<br />
you and I know Fran, that he should go so, he has changed his<br />
identity. If he came out in a toupee and a moustache he couldn't be<br />
more obvious. This is just simply the most hollow change.<br />
FK: But you couldn't be recommending that he hang on to ' Fightback'. You<br />
must welcome the change that the conservative party is now focussing<br />
on the socially bereft?<br />
PM: But, this is the party of inclusion he says now. He is going to use the<br />
word ' inclusion' except for the unemployed, except for the low paid.<br />
He says he is interested in the welfare of Aboriginals except he<br />
wouldn't support Mabo. He is now going to focus on immigration, but<br />
he is down on migrants. This is the same fellow who attacked renters,<br />
school teachers, churches, nurses. He says, for instance, they talk<br />
about family values, but they want to take away the material supports<br />
for the family. The fact is, these people when they talk about law and<br />
order they are at the same time talking about inequality, lower wages,<br />
a weaker safety net, they want all the conditions in place that actually<br />
lead to a break down of law and order. This policy statement or this<br />
strategy statement of theirs is the most comprehensive twaddle I've<br />
heard since John Howard came up with incentivation a few years ago.<br />
FK: They have done extensive research and their research shows that<br />
middle Australia is upset about the changes caused under your<br />
Government, changes caused by high unemployment, the<br />
hopelessness amongst the young, the rising' crime rate, the<br />
disintegration of families as the poverty levels rise. These are all<br />
problems that have risen under you.<br />
PM: But these are people who say they don't want to support families.<br />
They say when we increased the Family Allowance Supplement in<br />
' One Nation' it was bankrupting the-country. These are people who<br />
want to tug away at lower end wages. These are people who want to<br />
attack someone on $ 360 a week and say they should be exposed to<br />
peasant wages under individual wage contracts. People who should<br />
be dragged down from $ 360 a week while at the same time they're out<br />
there talking about the family. You've never heard them say anything<br />
either about Medicare, where they stand on that. They say that they<br />
have junked ' Fightback', but where do they stand on Medicare and<br />
health? And are they still supporting South-east Asian wage rates?<br />
Are they still supporting individual wage contracts? I'll bet they are.<br />
FK: But, politically, aren't they smarter to fight you without a detailed<br />
economic policy document, fight you on your ground if you like, so they<br />
can't now be accused of being heartless econocrats as they were last<br />
time round? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: Well, they are a party now officially without a policy. This is going to<br />
be a novel experience in Australian political life. They are going to go<br />
to an election without a policy and I don't believe that this community,<br />
conscientious as it is for change and prodding the political system all<br />
the time for change economic. -change, change in our social<br />
environment, change in the region we live in, integration, exports,<br />
research and development all of those things, will take a party that<br />
has got no policies or a party which said our policy which we would<br />
now be implementing had we won the last election was all wrong and it<br />
is now dead and buried. I mean, where does it leave them? Where<br />
does it leave John Hewson who said he would resign over the policy if<br />
he had to change it, that it was too good to be changed where does it<br />
leave him now'? A person who was elected on the basis that he had<br />
some economic credentials? Fran, what they have said, is they have<br />
given up on the economy, the economy is doing too well. They have<br />
said the economy is growing too well, we can give up by it. This was<br />
their principal focus of attack not a year ago. So, where are they left<br />
now? They are now saying we are now for inclusion, just forget the<br />
fact we attacked the renters and the school teachers and the churches<br />
and the nurses and we are going to attack the low paid, we don't<br />
support the long-term unemployed, we tried to knock over Mabo, I<br />
mean, as I say, if he came out with a toupee and a moustache he<br />
would be no more obvious.<br />
FK: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you, Fran.<br />
