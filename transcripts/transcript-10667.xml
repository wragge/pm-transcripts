    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>John, congratulations on an excellent speech. Over the last 20 years</p>
<p> I have heard most of your outstanding speeches and this has beaten</p>
<p> them all, and I think it is the most credible, brilliant package that,</p>
<p> it does fulfil all that we have been striving for. And with all of</p>
<p> the themes that you mentioned, one of the best you didn't happen</p>
<p> to include just now, and that was what we are doing for average families.</p>
<p> Could you say something about our family package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it does represent a huge further level of support for families.</p>
<p> I am well known for the commitment I have for a greater sense of tax</p>
<p> justice and choice for Australian families and the biggest benefits</p>
<p> under the income tax changes are for families in low and middle income</p>
<p> brackets. One of the very, very strong features of the package is</p>
<p> that we have a 30 per cent marginal tax rate for everybody who earns</p>
<p> less than $50,000 a year. And can I remind this audience that that</p>
<p> is 81% of all Australian taxpayers. Eighty one per cent of all Australian</p>
<p> tax payers earn less than $50,000 a year. At the moment, only 30 per</p>
<p> cent of Australian taxpayers have a top marginal, are on a top marginal</p>
<p> rate of 30 cents in a dollar. As result of this plan that will now</p>
<p> become 81 per cent of all Australian taxpayers. On top of that, we</p>
<p> have doubled the tax free threshold from $1000 to $2000 for each child</p>
<p> under our family tax initiative. We have also doubled from $2,500</p>
<p> to $5,000 the additional tax free zone that a single income family</p>
<p> with a child under five can have. And that means that the aggregate</p>
<p> tax free zone for a single income family with a child under five,</p>
<p> at least one child under five, will be $13,000.</p>
<p>Now the purpose of these changes is to increase the choice available</p>
<p> to parents. It is not the role of the government to dictate a stereotype.</p>
<p> It is not for the government to say that one parent should be at home</p>
<p> when children are young, or that both parents should be in the workforce,</p>
<p> that's not our business, that's the business of the parents.</p>
<p> But it is our business and it is our responsibility to facilitate</p>
<p> choice. And I think young parents now want greater choice. They want</p>
<p> the opportunity, if they so choose, for one of them to be out of the</p>
<p> workforce for a period of time while their children are young, and</p>
<p> then perhaps when the youngest child has gone to school, or even before,</p>
<p> the parent at home might move back into the part-time workforce and</p>
<p> then over another period of years, back into the full time workforce.</p>
<p> In other words they want choice, they don't want the government</p>
<p> saying, you will do this, or you will do that and rigging the tax</p>
<p> scales to bring about that result. And what we're in the business</p>
<p> of doing is to facilitate choice, and I think this plan will do it</p>
<p> to a much greater extent.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Chairman, Di Wilkins, Chairman of Women's Council.</p>
<p> Prime Minister, Baden has actually pre-empted what I was going to</p>
<p> ask you, but I would like you to scotch a nasty rumour that is around</p>
<p> in the media, print media and the talk back radio, even in today's</p>
<p> Advertiser, that the one which says that we, the Liberal Party,</p>
<p> really want all women to stay at home behind the white picket fence</p>
<p> looking after children. I wanted you to reassure me and the many women</p>
<p> around Australia that the new tax system acknowledges the diversity</p>
<p> of today's family unit and continues to enable choice for women</p>
<p> today. Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course it does. But I mean what is on at the moment, I mean</p>
<p> you should understand that there are a section of our critics and</p>
<p> sections of the media who look at everything that the Government does</p>
<p> through the frame of reference of the Labor Party, through the frame</p>
<p> of reference of the Labor Party, and therefore they make these outrageous</p>
<p> allegations that in some way we are trying to stereotype a particular</p>
<p> kind of behaviour. Of all the revolutions that have occurred in the</p>
<p> way people lead their lives in the last 30 to 40 years, none has been</p>
<p> greater than the change in the role of women. I have said in a speech</p>
<p> I delivered in Melbourne a few months ago that when I thought about</p>
<p> the three women that have influenced my life most, my mother, my wife</p>
<p> and my daughter, and I think of the social circumstances into which</p>
<p> each of them had been born, and the way in which they conducted their</p>
<p> lives, one could see the progression and yet one could also have a</p>
<p> sense of continuity that each of them has, in the circumstances of</p>
<p> their period of time and the age into which they were born, a deep</p>
<p> commitment to the importance of family in their lives.</p>
<p>But they would exercise that deep commitment and they would express</p>
<p> it in different ways because of the circumstances of their time. And</p>
<p> I have often talked to my 24 year old daughter about this, and she</p>
<p> is a person who has a commitment to family but also has a commitment</p>
<p> to a career. And she's a woman of the 1990s and understands the</p>
<p> importance of career choice but also understands the immense value</p>
<p> of the stable home environment, as all of us do. And what you have</p>
<p> to do is to find, to set a paradigm that allows people to freely choose</p>
<p> how to organise their lives. And we don't want one side of the</p>
<p> argument saying what the others are doing is wrong. I am fed up with</p>
<p> people attacking women who stay at home full time to look after their</p>
<p> children. I am fed up with those people being sort of treated as somehow</p>
<p> or other they're second class citizens.</p>
<p>Equally, the women who have a career and who are looking after their</p>
<p> children and are making their own arrangements in the way that they</p>
<p> think fit for their own families, they shouldn't be told that</p>
<p> they are neglecting their parental responsibilities. So, in other</p>
<p> words, we all ought to recognise that what we should be on about is</p>
<p> choice and respecting the decisions that parents make. It's for</p>
<p> parents to make the decision. It is for us to set the framework to</p>
<p> allow them to make the full range of the decisions that they want</p>
<p> to make.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Hi, Alex Smith, Young Liberal President. Mr Prime Minister, last night</p>
<p> the Young Liberals tried to move a motion through this body to reaffirm</p>
<p> South Australia's support for one of your early and very great</p>
<p> achievements upon coming to office in 1996, and that was your gun</p>
<p> legislation. Given that debate on this motion was adjourned last night,</p>
<p> I was wondering if, here today, you would like to reaffirm your support</p>
<p> for the gun legislation moved a couple years ago.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's very easy. I mean, I know there are some people</p>
<p> who didn't agree with that, but can I say, I am proud of that.</p>
<p> I think it was a good thing for Australia. I think it has delivered</p>
<p> a safer Australia. I think it has something that has particularly</p>
<p> strong support from the women of Australia. And I won't budge</p>
<p> an inch on those gun laws. Now I don't want to influence the</p>
<p> debate in any way, but there are some things where you, people should</p>
<p> be in no doubt, I am not interested in any compromise on those gun</p>
<p> laws. I am sorry if that offends anybody, but I am not interested</p>
<p> in changing the Government's position and I won't.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Gene Lorry, Price FEC. John, when the election comes along, health</p>
<p> is going to be a major issue. It seems to me that we're trying</p>
<p> to do something to bring people back into private health. But when</p>
<p> I go into a supermarket and pay for my goods, I pay for them. When</p>
<p> I go out the door I wouldn't like to be asked to pay for them</p>
<p> again. And it seems to me that that's the problem with out health</p>
<p> system. I think, if we could have a system whereby people either pay</p>
<p> the levy or pay for a private fund, we would find people would come</p>
<p> back in droves to support the private funds. Is there any possibility</p>
<p> that we could make such a change?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no. We are committed to the maintenance of the Medicare system.</p>
<p> And we can't afford to leave any doubt, and I will not leave</p>
<p> any doubt in the minds of the Australian public about our support</p>
<p> for the basic Medicare system. Our health policy is built upon support</p>
<p> for the basic Medicare system, and I don't use that "basic"</p>
<p> in any qualifying sense. It's unqualified support for the Medicare</p>
<p> system, supplemented by very strong support for the private part of</p>
<p> the health system, through the sort of incentives that will be provided</p>
<p> under the plan announced a couple of nights ago. You need a balance</p>
<p> between public and private. We recently announced the injection of</p>
<p> an additional $915 million into the public hospital systems of the</p>
<p> states.</p>
<p>That now means that over the next five years there will be a real</p>
<p> increase of 17 per cent across Australia in federal money flowing</p>
<p> to the state governments for the public hospital system. You need</p>
<p> a strong public hospital system. You also need to give people more</p>
<p> incentive to take out private health insurance. And we are doing that.</p>
<p> This initiative will mean that from the 1st of January</p>
<p> next year, from January next year, and this health initiative starts</p>
<p> next year - you don't have to wait until July of 2000, the health</p>
<p> initiative from January of next year, if you have a policy of say,</p>
<p> $2000 you will be able to get $600 of that off your tax. And that's</p>
<p> 30 per cent of the cost. And that applies to everybody. There is no</p>
<p> income test. Let me repeat that - there is no income test. And that</p>
<p> means that it will be available to everybody, irrespective of their</p>
<p> income. And it will be available for people at the low end of the</p>
<p> income bracket who don't pay enough tax to get it back through</p>
<p> their tax, to get it as a direct payment. Indeed anybody will be able</p>
<p> to get it as a direct payment.</p>
<p>But, there is a lot of public support for the essential thrust of</p>
<p> Medicare, there really is. And I don't think it is not good policy,</p>
<p> and nor is it intelligent political management to be canvassing any</p>
<p> kind of change to the essentials of Medicare. What we have to do is</p>
<p> to build on it. And what we have to do is improve the weaknesses in</p>
<p> the private area, and one of them is to give people more incentive,</p>
<p> and I know people have concern about gap insurance, I understand that.</p>
<p> I have frequently said in the past when I have been asked about those</p>
<p> things that health is an area where you never completely close the</p>
<p> book on making further change. But the change that I announced on</p>
<p> Thursday was a very big one and I am sure that it will result in a</p>
<p> large number of people coming back into private health insurance.</p>
<p>QUESTIONER:</p>
<p>I hope so John.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Thank you, Margaret Wilson from Eastern Metropolitan Convention. First</p>
<p> of all Prime Minister, I would like to congratulate you on the courage</p>
<p> for, to reform the taxation system before an election rather than</p>
<p> afterwards. Secondly every three or four years I have a trip to New</p>
<p> Zealand, and I have always noticed that supermarket prices over there</p>
<p> have been higher than here in Australia. And I thought that that was</p>
<p> partly because of the exchange rate difference, partly because they</p>
<p> have a smaller market, and partly because I don't have the opportunity</p>
<p> to shop around. But this time in June when I was back there, there</p>
<p> was the added GST, in their case of 12.5 per cent. So I was expecting</p>
<p> prices to be of the order of more than 30 per cent higher than they</p>
<p> are in the supermarkets here. And I was pleasantly surprised to find</p>
<p> them only 10 per cent, maybe 15 per cent and in many cases, much cheaper.</p>
<p> Now could we please ensure that that message gets through to the general</p>
<p> population that a GST is not going to make their supermarket prices</p>
<p> 12.5 per cent higher, because there are many other factors come into</p>
<p> it as well. Including the reduction of these other taxes and they</p>
<p> may even find many of them, including food prices lower for having</p>
<p> a tax on it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We certainly will. And the point that has to be made again, and again,</p>
<p> that the GST will replace existing taxes. I mean there are many services</p>
<p> that will be cheaper. Medical services will be cheaper because they</p>
<p> are GST free, and the people who provide them will be able to deduct,</p>
<p> get back the taxes paid on their inputs. Same with dental services.</p>
<p> The same with child care. Three very critical things where the cost</p>
<p> of those services ought to fall. Fall. Not just relatively but in</p>
<p> absolute terms ought to fall. And if there is enough competitive pressure</p>
<p> that will happen.</p>
<p>As far as the supermarket is concerned, the average increase in costs</p>
<p> across the whole community is going to be about 1.9 per cent. We will</p>
<p> be undertaking, and it has already started, an extensive public education</p>
<p> programme. You will have seen the three full page advertisements in</p>
<p> The Advertiser this morning listing the features of the plan,</p>
<p> listing the tax scales with individual cameos. We started a television</p>
<p> advertising campaign last night, and that is going to go on for several</p>
<p> weeks, so that people fully informed. This is not propaganda, it's</p>
<p> providing people with information. I mean, they are entitled to know</p>
<p> what's involved in this big change. And one of the things they</p>
<p> will get is a householder booklet, sixteen pages long. Everybody will</p>
<p> have it within two weeks and it will explain the detail of the plan</p>
<p> and it will also point out that the GST replaces existing taxes and</p>
<p> as a result, many things will fall in price. Others will go up but</p>
<p> in net terms, people will be fully protected and better off because</p>
<p> they will either get an increase in their pension or benefit plus</p>
<p> a tax cut, or if you are a self funded retiree, you will get a number</p>
<p> of other individual benefits. But I agree with you, it's an important</p>
<p> message to communicate.</p>
<p>QUESTIONER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you for what you are doing for us. This room here</p>
<p> who has never been hungry, are going to benefit in enormous ways but</p>
<p> taxi drivers  I have had two or three recently and their agony</p>
<p> and their talk is, but what about these poor people who don't</p>
<p> have enough food half the time. It's going to be more. I think</p>
<p> from what you just said, you are sending the booklet out but can you</p>
<p> do a simple ad directed to people who are often hungry, that they</p>
<p> are going to be better off. The taxi drivers need reassurance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am quite certain that the advertising campaign will be comprehensive</p>
<p> enough to include that information. We must accept that our opponents</p>
<p> are going to run a fear campaign. They are going to try and exploit</p>
<p> fear. Remember in 1993, Mr Keating said you can have a tax cut without</p>
<p> a GST. And when he got back into office, he and Mr Beazley, what did</p>
<p> they do? They took away the tax cut and they gave the poor of Australia</p>
<p> a GST without any compensation. I mean, let me just spell out to you</p>
<p> that the impact of a GST is virtually the same in percentage of GDP</p>
<p> terms as the indirect tax increases that were brought in by Mr Dawkins</p>
<p> in the 1993 budget. They brought in their own GST after then 1993</p>
<p> election, they provided no compensation to pensioners, there were</p>
<p> no 4% increases, there was no compensation for the elderly, no compensation</p>
<p> for the unemployed, and for good measure they took away the tax cut</p>
<p> that they promised before the election.</p>
<p>And Mr Beazley is going to do the same thing. You can see it coming</p>
<p> down straight at you like an express train. In a couple of weeks he</p>
<p> will stand up and say, you can have this tax cut and you don't</p>
<p> need any of this GST business. Forget about that. You can have this</p>
<p> and you don't need any reform. And he will cross his fingers</p>
<p> and he will close his eyes and he will hope it will work because he</p>
<p> will remember what Keating did in 1993. Remember L-A-W law. You can</p>
<p> have the tax cuts, we're not going to have Hewson's GST.</p>
<p> We're going to give you all of these goodies without any reform.</p>
<p>Now we all know that's not possible. That's unrealistic.</p>
<p> But Mr Beazley is going to try it again. You can see it coming. I</p>
<p> can write the script. I could almost do the first interview. Because</p>
<p> he's got a lot of form on this. I mean, he was there by Mr Keating's</p>
<p> side. I mean, it was really the greatest con job of all time. You</p>
<p> offer a tax cut, you say no GST. You win the election, you take away</p>
<p> the tax cut and you give them a GST without compensation and you wonder</p>
<p> why people don't trust you.</p>
<p>Now they are shaping up to do it again and I just hope that the Australian</p>
<p> people on this occasion, and I have great confidence they will recognise</p>
<p> that and they will know that if you really want serious reform, if</p>
<p> you really want benefits, you've got to have serious reform as</p>
<p> well. And I think we can succeed on this occasion in doing that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
