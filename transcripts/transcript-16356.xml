    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will contribute $5 million to the new Bernie Banton Centre, the world's first dedicated asbestos research institute.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made the announcement at the opening of the Centre, a major co-development between the NSW Government and the ANZAC Research Institute at Concord Hospital in Sydney.</p>
<p>The federal government contribution will go towards the final fit-out costs of the Centre, also known as the Asbestos Disease Research Institute.</p>
<p>The Centre honours Bernie Banton, a man of exceptional decency and humility who stayed full of life and fight during his darkest days, battling to help and support victims of mesothelioma and asbestos-related disease.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Centre is a major boost to research conducted on the Concord Hospital campus, where Bernie Banton was treated.</p>
<p>Its work will be complemented by the ongoing work of the National Research Centre for Asbestos-Related Diseases (NRCARD), which links together 11 research centres around Australia.</p>
<p>It will also work alongside the future Centre of Research Excellence into Asbestos-Related Disease, which will be established from 2010 with $2.5 million in federal funds to support world-class research.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government has also previously announced the establishment of a Bernie Banton Asbestos Research Fellowship under the National Health and Medical Research Centre fellowship program for researchers of renown.</p>
<p>Mesothelioma is a cancer, and is usually fatal. It typically occurs 20 to 30 years after exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p>By 2020, it is estimated that Australia will have 13,000 cases of mesothelioma and a further 40,000 cases of asbestos-related cancer.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government recognises that those suffering asbestos-related disease face enormous challenges.</p>
<p>The Bernie Banton Centre at Concord Hospital will promote prevention and education about asbestos-related disease in Australia and throughout the Asian region.</p>
