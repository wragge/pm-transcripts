PRIME MINIISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TO THE NATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT OUTLOOK CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 7 DECEMBER 1994<br />
** CHECK AGAINST DELI VERY"*<br />
It is a great pleasure to be able to address the National Trade and Investment<br />
Outlook Conference again.<br />
When I spoke at the inaugural meeting last year, 900 people were present,<br />
representing 162 Australian companies. We were very pleased with that<br />
response and we are even more pleased with this one.<br />
This year we have 1500 delegates representing 450 companies.<br />
And twice as many international delegates are attending the conference this<br />
year. This is an excellent result. It reflects the growing interest among Australian<br />
companies in going off-shore, in exporting, in looking at a global market rather<br />
than a market of 18 million people.<br />
A real change is taking place in Australian business culture.<br />
Export performance, best practice, international competitiveness are all<br />
increasingly central tothe approach of Australian businesspeople and<br />
Australian workers.<br />
Already, around one in eight Australian manufacturers is involved in exporting.<br />
But the important lesson and one that is getting through to more and more<br />
Australian companies is that, irrespective of size, these manufacturing<br />
exporters outperform their non-exporting counterparts.<br />
In fact, firms which operate internationally are 65 per cent more productive<br />
than those which operate only in the domestic market and they consistently<br />
invest more in new capital equipment. </p>
<p>The people in this room understand this. There really is no more important<br />
message for Australian business and for the Australian community at large. If<br />
it was not apparent before, the APEC leaders' meeting at Bogor certainly<br />
should have driven it home.<br />
That is what I want to talk about this morning APEC, Australia and our trade<br />
priorities. I have spoken a good deal about AP-EC.. over recent weeks, and I know you<br />
have already heard from Bob McMullan on the subject, so I only want to put a<br />
few simple propositions to you7<br />
First, the commitments made at the Bogor meeting to achieve free trade<br />
between the APEC economies by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020<br />
for developing economies will change fundamentally the way the countries of<br />
the Asia-Pacific work together and the climate for business in the region.<br />
Second, Australia is well placed to take advantage of this change.<br />
Third, while APEC provides a tremendous framework for growth in the region,<br />
the trade and commerce it facilitates will take place bilaterally. In other words,<br />
we must not ignore our bilateral links with individual regional countries. And<br />
when I say " our" I mean both of us governments and business.<br />
And, fourth, while Australia's policy focus has been on the Asia-Pacific and<br />
APEC, this does not mean that we will ignore the great importance to us of<br />
other markets and other international relationships.<br />
The term " historic achievement" is thrown around very loosely about<br />
international meetings. But I think the Bogor meeting which President<br />
Soeharto chaired was one by any measure.<br />
The Declaration we agreed there commits us to establish free trade no later<br />
than 2020 among a group of countries which already account for half the<br />
world's production. It establishes an Asia-Pacific association which makes any<br />
fracturing of the world into three contending trade groupings less likely. And it<br />
offers an unprecedented opportunity to maintain dynamic economic growth in<br />
Asia and the Pacific, while preserving strategic stability.<br />
A good deal of work remains to be done as we fill out the details of the trade<br />
liberalisation process in the lead-up to the next leaders' meeting in Osaka.<br />
But the critical part getting the political commitment to trade and investment<br />
liberalisation is now behind us. All the APEC economies have accepted that<br />
we are working towards a common goal. </p>
<p>And I am convinced that, as was the case when this Government began<br />
dismantling the ring fence of protectionism behind which Australia had<br />
slumbered for so long, the timetable we are now talking about will come<br />
forward as businesses begin to factor the decisions we have made into their<br />
planning.<br />
Most of the public attention since Bogor has been focussed on the free trade<br />
aspect of the declaration.<br />
That is understandable because the benefits from APEC-wide free trade for<br />
Asia-Pacific economies are huge according to our estimates, around three<br />
times the size of the Uruguay Round outcome alone.<br />
But it is important not to lose sight of the other part of APEC's work the trade<br />
facilitation agenda.<br />
In this area, a lot of work is underway which will be of real benefit to business,<br />
especially as formal barriers in the region such as tariff rates begin to come<br />
down. At Bogor, for example, we agreed on:<br />
a set of common investment principles, a first-step in a region-wide<br />
effort to make investment flows easier<br />
a commitment to improve customs procedures, establish common<br />
standards and lower administrative barriers to market access<br />
a " standstill" agreement, committing regional economies to refrain on a<br />
best endeavours basis from increasing protection measures<br />
the need to examine a voluntary dispute mediation service which could<br />
supplement the WTO's more formal requirements<br />
and support for the growing economic policy dialogue taking place<br />
under the auspices of APEC Finance Ministers<br />
All these decisions, together with the trade liberalisation commitment, add up<br />
to an agreed agenda which has set the pattern for regional co-operation over<br />
the next twenty five years.<br />
This is a fundamental change in the political, economic and strategic dynamics<br />
of the Asia-Pacific region. It offers enormous opportunities to businesses that<br />
are creative and flexible and understand the wider environment. They can<br />
plan on access to an increasingly large and integrated regional market,<br />
representing forty per cent of the world's population. </p>
<p>The Bogor commitments have in my view changed the way business will have<br />
to operate in the region. They will have to conceive of their operations in a<br />
more integrated way. And, naturally, as they work to the new agenda, they will<br />
do best if they work more closely with government. And the Government you<br />
can be sure wants to work very closely with business.<br />
Bob McMullan and Peter Cook and other Ministers will be consulting very<br />
dro-sely with ' business -in thie period ahead.<br />
And I have asked two distinguished Australian business people, Philip Brass of<br />
Pacific Dunlop and Imelda Roche of Nutri-metics, to continue to represent<br />
Australia on the Pacific Business Forum group, to which APEC leaders will be<br />
looking for further guidance on what business needs from APEC.<br />
The second point I want to make today is that Australia is very well placed to<br />
meet these new challenges set by APEC.<br />
By 2000 a full decade before Australia is required to achieve free trade under<br />
the Bogor commitment our average trade-weighted tariff will be just 2.9 per<br />
cent. Even in industries traditionally regarded as highly protected, such as textiles,<br />
clothing and footwear and motor vehicles, tariffs will be low by 2000 only<br />
per cent in the case of motor vehicles and between 5 per cent and 25 per cent<br />
for TCF.<br />
Much of our adjustment has already been made.<br />
The effective rate of industry protection in Australia is now about one-third of<br />
what it was in the early 1980s and yet our exports represent 22 per cent of our<br />
GDP compared with less than 14 per cent in 1983.<br />
Elaborately transformed manufactures, which now dominate world trade,<br />
account for 21 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports. And services,<br />
which will be increasingly important as economic growth in the region<br />
continues, account for 20 per cent of our exports.<br />
All Australian industries will benefit from lower barriers in a region where<br />
formal and informal trade barriers have geine6-riily been' higher than our own.<br />
This brings me to my third point:<br />
Although APEC provides a structural framework for co-operation throughout<br />
the Asia-Pacific, the actual business of commerce is conducted country-tocountry<br />
and company-to-company.<br />
When we talk about the opportunities which Bogor creates, that is what it<br />
translates to on the ground contact between Australians and their Asia-<br />
Pacific counterparts. </p>
<p>APEC can be an important accretion to but never a substitute for the<br />
development of strong bilateral links with individual regional countries.<br />
The process is mutually reinforcing.<br />
At the time of the APEC leaders' meeting in Bogor, for example, I was able to<br />
have a very useful series of meetings with ten other heads of government to<br />
discuss bilateral issues.<br />
And good bilateral relationships, in turn, make it easier to do things cooperatively<br />
in the APEC forum.<br />
The Government will continue to look for ways of strengthening relations with<br />
individual regional countries.<br />
A good example has been Indonesia, where we have established the Australia-<br />
Indonesia Ministerial Forum, which has helped broaden the whole focus of the<br />
rela'tionship, and where the Australia Today promotion earlier this year was<br />
such a success in getting the message through to business and the public.<br />
We have been working on the same sort of pattern with other regional<br />
countries, too.<br />
During my visit to Singapore in 1992, for example, our two Governments<br />
agreed to support the efforts of Australian and Singaporean companies to<br />
develop joint business opportunities so-called strategic linkages elsewhere<br />
in Asia.<br />
When Prime Minister Goh visited Australia in September we agreed to<br />
contribute $ 1 million each to establish a Joint Venture Feasibility Study Fund<br />
under this program to assist companies operating jointly in third markets.<br />
We also agreed to establish a Singapore-Australia Business Alliance Forum<br />
which will play a strategic role in developing commercial relations between<br />
Australia and Singapore and business partnerships in third country markets.<br />
We will each be nominating a select group of CEOs to the Forum, representing<br />
companies with strong track records in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
We will retain close stewardship of the forum to ensure it meets each country's<br />
aims. At the Strategic Business Partnerships session here tomorrow, I hope business<br />
people from Australia and Singap~ e will decide on a destination for a joint<br />
mission next year which will be led by Senator McMullan.<br />
Initiatives such as this can be applied to other countries. </p>
<p>In Australia last month, both President Frei of Chile and President Kim of<br />
Korea, expressed interest in developing linkages between their business<br />
sectors and Australian companies. And I have also discussed such<br />
opportunities with Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia.<br />
My discussion with President Frei envisaged Australia as a gateway for<br />
Chilean companies into Asia and Chile as a beach-head for Australia into<br />
South America.<br />
President Kim Young Sam and I also talked about the tremendous potential for<br />
b6--o-perati-on betvween Australian and Korean firms in the science and<br />
technology area.<br />
We agreed to negotiate a new science and technology agreement and to<br />
jointly invest in industrial technology projects in areas like the information<br />
superhighway and clean energy.<br />
These are just some examples of initiatives we are taking to develop bilateral<br />
relationships in ways which facilitate closer private sector links as well.<br />
The story here is being repeated with all our neighbours with China, with<br />
Thailand, with Japan, with Vietnam and around the region.<br />
The fourth point is one I want to make particularly clearly, because the<br />
message sometimes gets lost.<br />
It is that, despite the importance to Australia of APEC and regional economic<br />
linkages, we fully recognise the continuing importance of our relationships with<br />
other countries and other regions.<br />
In other words, we are quite able to walk and chew gum at the same time.<br />
That is why we particularly welcome the delegations here from France, India,<br />
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Mexico ( although Mexico is also a partner in<br />
APEC). The message we hope you will take back is that this country has a lot to offer<br />
you and your businesses through trade and investment, in Australia itself and,<br />
through Australia, into the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Because this is a very good place to do business an information-rich,<br />
technologically advanced country, situated in the fastest growing region of the<br />
world and with a highly trained multicultural workforce.<br />
Business conditions here are the best they have been for years. The<br />
Australian economy is growing strongly six per cent per annum over the past<br />
twelve months. </p>
<p>And inflation remains below two per cent, less than the OECD average. For<br />
the first time since the early 1960s, we have seen inflation under 2% per cent<br />
for nearly three years.<br />
Wages growth has been very subdued in the past few years, and we have<br />
seen significant improvements in productivity.<br />
These favourable business conditions have been reflected in high profits and<br />
high levels of business confidence. Corporate profits rose by over 11 per cent<br />
through the twelve months to the September quarter. The profit share is now<br />
at its highest level since 1985.<br />
Business investment, especially in plant and equipment, is mounting a strong<br />
recovery which will upgrade and expand the productive capacity of the<br />
economy. This in turn will boost the prospects for Australian exports.<br />
In 1993-94, our volume of exports of goods and services grew by 9 per cent,<br />
more strongly than the Budget forecast, while exports of elaborately<br />
transformed manufactures grew by 16 per cent.<br />
And it is important to appreciate that although Australia is still best known<br />
overseas as an efficient producer of agriculture and minerals, this is a<br />
technologically sophisticated country with a first rate scientific research base.<br />
The image of Australia is to some extent divorced from the contemporary facts.<br />
To give you some random examples:<br />
We have more computers and processing power per head than any country<br />
other than the United States and have invested a higher percentage of our<br />
GDP in telecommunications infrastructure than any country other than Korea<br />
and Germany.<br />
Hundreds of Australian information technology and telecommunications firms<br />
are exporting successfully worldwide.<br />
Australian software runs the tracking, reservation and booking systems for<br />
Lufthansa and other airlines, for example.<br />
Buses in the UK and Denmark use ' smart card' ticketing developed by an<br />
Australian company.<br />
In March I will be attending the CeBIT' 95 Trade Fair in Hanover where 130<br />
Australian companies will be participating. </p>
<p>Australian research and technology is leading the world in areas like gene<br />
shears, which have huge benefits for plant, animal and human health; an antiinfluenza<br />
drug which offers real hope of treatment for all strains of flu; and a<br />
multibeam antenna, capable of communicating with twenty satellites at once<br />
and which makes communications links more cost-effective.<br />
A Co-operative Research Centres program linking universities and research<br />
insfiflitions with industry is pioneering world-class technologies in Australia.<br />
But although Australia has many great attributes, none is more important than<br />
our people. The ethnic diversity of Australia's people gives this country a<br />
natural network for doing global business.<br />
All of the world's nationalities, cultures, religions and traditions are represented<br />
here, but in a uniquely Australian blend.<br />
Here again I suspect the image abroad is a little behind the reality.<br />
Forty two per cent of Australians were either born overseas or have at least<br />
one parent born overseas. Seventeen per cent of Australians speak a<br />
language other than English at home.<br />
We are implementing strategies to make effective economic use of our cultural<br />
diversity which is becoming integral to our approach to industry and trade<br />
development. There are more than 160 ethnic chambers of commerce and bilateral business<br />
organisations around Australia, all actively engaged with Australia's<br />
international commercial relations.<br />
To help businesses get access to these networks, the Government recently<br />
commissioned a study to identify the organisations and their networking<br />
potential. I am pleased to announce that the associated database is available at this<br />
conference for the first time. It is a resource which will help Australian<br />
companies tap into global business networks by providing them with easy<br />
access to people with inside knowledge of markets, first-hand experience,<br />
fluency in their languages and an intimate knowledge of their cultures and<br />
consumer preferences.<br />
There are already many examples where astute Australian businesspeople<br />
have drawn on this resource.<br />
Among manufacturers, for example, Vulcanite and Utilux have utilised<br />
Chinese-born Australian employees to capitalise on market opportunities in<br />
China. </p>
<p>Of the more than 90 international corporations who have set up significant<br />
regional activities from Australia, a number including Data General, the Hong<br />
Kong Jockey Club, IBM, Novell and Oracle have cited Australia's multicultural<br />
population as an important factor in making a decision to locate their regional<br />
headquarters in Australia.<br />
The final point I want to make is about the relationship between business and<br />
government. The world we are moving into is very different from what we have known in the<br />
past. It is more integrated than ever, a globalised environment in which more and<br />
more aspects of our national economy have an international dimension to<br />
them, and in which our external interests economic, strategic, political are<br />
intertwined in a way we have never seen before.<br />
In this sort of world, it is increasingly important that business and government<br />
each understand what the other is saying and work in a complementary way.<br />
That is a very important aim of this Government.<br />
For example, a major part of the work of Australia's overseas posts is now to<br />
assist Australian firms take advantage of trade and investment opportunities.<br />
The Government's overseas trade support network, particularly in China,<br />
Vietnam and other key Asian countries is being strengthened.<br />
Our overseas network is also now increasingly specialised to cater for the<br />
specific needs of Australian exporters. As well as a wide network of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade posts, and Austrade staff here and overseas, we have<br />
education counsellors promoting the export of education services and industry,<br />
science and technology counsellors stationed around the globe.<br />
And nine investment commissioners are encouraging foreign firms to set up<br />
operations in Australia, either independently or as joint ventures with<br />
Australian firms.<br />
Government officials here or overseas can't make your deal happen. They<br />
can't write the contracts. But they can help you through their local knowledge<br />
and put you in touch with the right people. Using them can save time and<br />
effort, open doors to opportunities and remove obstacles to doing business.<br />
You should use the next two days to meet with the Australian Ambassadors<br />
and Austrade overseas officers who have returned to be at this conference.<br />
Let them know how they can help in your chosen markets and keep in touch<br />
with them when they get back to their posts. </p>
<p>I hope all of you Australian delegates and international guests find this not<br />
only an interesting couple of days but profitable ones.<br />
Because, in the end, the purpose of this conference is not to listen to speakers<br />
but to do business to help link our private sector with potential partners<br />
overseas. As the theme says: to create networks for global business. </p>
