No. 694<br />
FOR PRESS 65/ 094<br />
CABINET DISCUSSES DROUGHT<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen, announced that<br />
in the course of a meeting in Melbourne today the Cabinet had<br />
further discussed aspects of the drought in Eastern Australia.<br />
Proposals which have recently been received from the<br />
Governments of New South Wales and Queensland for Commonwealth<br />
assistance towards drought relief measures instituted by those<br />
states were under study and. would be further considered by<br />
Cabinet. As had already been announced the Commonwealth was closely<br />
watching banking aspects, having regard to the needs of farmers<br />
and graziers in drought areas. It was in touch with the<br />
Reserve Bank about this.<br />
The Reserve Bank had itself been conducting consultations<br />
with the trading banks to ascertain the requirement and<br />
availability of banking assistance being sought for drought<br />
purposes. The Government was also examining taxation implications<br />
for farmers and graziers of transactions in which they may be<br />
involved as a result of the drought, such as the disposal of<br />
stock and subsequent restocking.<br />
The Treasurer had already clarified those taxation aspects<br />
which arose from donations of fodder and cash towards drought<br />
relief. CANBERRA. A. C. T.<br />
