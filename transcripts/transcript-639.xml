P. M. No. 78/ 1 962<br />
FOR PRESS AMPOL TANXER ALXT. LTO REPRESENTATIONS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, today received<br />
a deputation from the A. C. T. U. led by its President, Mr.<br />
A. E, Monk, on the question of manning the Ampol tanker, " IP. J,<br />
Adams." t The deputation proposed that the Commonwealth<br />
Government should subsidise wages by at least Å“ Q5,000 a year so<br />
that the operating company could use an Australian crew.<br />
The Prime Minister rejected the proposal and,' in<br />
doing so, drew the deputation's attention to Clause 21 of the<br />
Agreement between the Commonwealth and Ampol covering the registration<br />
of the s hi p. The Clause reads<br />
" 121( 1) The said vessel shall be registered as a<br />
British ship. The company may, but shall<br />
not be obliged to, register the vessel in<br />
Australia but should the vessel be registered<br />
outside Australia the port of registration<br />
shall be London in the United Kingdom.<br />
On or before delivery of the vessel the<br />
Commonwealth shall deliver to the company<br />
all documents necessary to enable the vessel<br />
to be registered in the Registry selected<br />
by the company."<br />
Mr. Menzies pointed out to the A. C. T. U. representatives<br />
that when the proposal to subsidise the building of<br />
the " 1P. J. Adams" was before Cabinet, Ampol made it a condition<br />
to the placing of an order for building the vessel in Australia<br />
that they should not be obliged to register the vessel in<br />
Australia. The Government decided that it should, nevertheless,<br />
agree to subsidise the building of the tanker at 4hyalla because<br />
of the substantial employment this would create in the shipbuilding<br />
and related industries.<br />
Mr. Menzies further noted that Ampol's intention<br />
to operate the vessel on the British registry had, in fact,<br />
been known for a long time and had been the subject of questions<br />
in the House of Representatives in 1958.<br />
The Prime Minister added that, having entered into<br />
an agreement with the company in the circumstances outlined, he<br />
could not agree that the Commonwealth should now consider a further<br />
and continuing subsidy towards the operation of the vessel.<br />
