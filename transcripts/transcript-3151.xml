PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMfENT NO. 181<br />
11 February 1974<br />
RELEASE OF TARIFF BOARD REPORTS<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Barnard, today<br />
released three reports which the Government had received<br />
from the Tariff Board in the latter half of 1973. The<br />
reports are titled, Textile Bags; Film Processing<br />
Industry, Advertising Film ( Value for Duty); and Paper<br />
and Textile Bags.<br />
Mr Barnard said that the Government's action,<br />
which was taken after receiving the views of<br />
Mr G. A. Rattigan, Chairman of the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission, was consistent with the earlier<br />
announcement made by the Prime Minister on 19 December<br />
1973 that all reports of the new Industries Assistance<br />
Commission which would not cause damaging speculation<br />
would be made public as soon as they were printed.<br />
Mr Barnard also said that the Government's<br />
decisions on the reports will be announced at the<br />
earliest practicable date. </p>
