<p>  SUBJECTS: taxation reform, business taxation system, Ralph Report, Asian-Pacific</p>
<p>   region, Australia's relationship with Israel.</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Chris for that very warm and generous introduction.</p>
<p>   To Leon Kempler, to his Excellency the Ambassador to Australia from Israel,</p>
<p>   Sir Zelman Cowen, the former Governor-General of Australia, my ministerial</p>
<p>   and parliamentary colleagues, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane,</p>
<p>   and many distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  It is for me a particular honour and pleasure to be at this lunch. And there</p>
<p>   are a number of things I want to say about the connection I feel I have</p>
<p>   with the Chamber and what the Chamber represents in terms of relations between</p>
<p>   the people of Australia and the people of Israel.</p>
<p>  But I think it is appropriate for me to say at the very beginning that I</p>
<p>   know that I speak on behalf of all of you here, and I know millions of Australians,</p>
<p>   in expressing to the Government and the people of Turkey our immense sadness</p>
<p>   at the enormous natural disaster which has overtaken that country. I've</p>
<p>   asked the relevant sections of our Government to assess what assistance</p>
<p>   Australia can provide to the Government and to the people of Turkey and</p>
<p>   I know that the thoughts of many Australians and most particularly those</p>
<p>   within our community who have family links with Turkey will be very much</p>
<p>   with the people who are suffering as a result of this terrible natural disaster.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen my pleasure in being here today and the honour I feel</p>
<p>   in being invited to address this lunch is based in no small measure than</p>
<p>   on the association at a personal level I've had, long pre-dating my entry</p>
<p>   into public life, with the Jewish people of Australia and the profound admiration</p>
<p>   that I've had for the State of Israel and what that country has achieved</p>
<p>   since it's formation in 1948 in such adversarial and difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>   And I'm very proud of the fact that I've led a government which has, whilst</p>
<p>   its kept its eye very clearly on the maintenance of a fair and just peace</p>
<p>   in the Middle East, is a Government that has always in terms of its voting</p>
<p>   record in the United Nations and generally in a diplomatic sense deported</p>
<p>   itself in a way that is profoundly sympathetic and understanding towards</p>
<p>   the Government and the people of Israel. And the Australian Government has</p>
<p>   always understood the difficulties faced by the State of Israel and has</p>
<p>   pursued policies which are conducive to a further understanding of that.</p>
<p>  I welcome very warmly the message that was sent to this luncheon by the</p>
<p>   newly elected Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak. He starts with a very</p>
<p>   large mandate and I can say from personal experience its always good to</p>
<p>   have your first term in government with a very large majority because you're</p>
<p>   bound in the course of taking decisions that are important to the future</p>
<p>   of your country and the long term stability of your government, you are</p>
<p>   bound to take some decisions that are going lose you a few friends and lose</p>
<p>   you a bit of support. I look forward to the Prime Ministership of Mr Barak.</p>
<p>   I wish him well. I know that he will pursue a just and lasting peace in</p>
<p>   the Middle East and I know that it is the desire of not only of my government</p>
<p>   but of all Australians of goodwill that there be that peace which recognises</p>
<p>   the legitimate rights, not only of the State of Israel and the people of</p>
<p>   Israel, but also the legitimate rights of other nations and other peoples</p>
<p>   within the Middle East.</p>
<p>  The relationship between Australia and Israel is a very close relationship.</p>
<p>   It is a relationship built on some common values. It is a relationship built</p>
<p>   on the common value of our commitment to individual liberty and freedom.</p>
<p>   Israel has been since her foundation a beacon of democracy and liberty in</p>
<p>   the Middle East. We share those values and those aspirations with Israel</p>
<p>   and our two peoples feel close as a consequence. We have of course very</p>
<p>   special links through the vibrant character of the Jewish community in Australia,</p>
<p>   but not only that but also because of the great respect so many Australians</p>
<p>   feel towards Israel and what Israel has achieved over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>  We have substantial economic links. But those economic links can be advanced</p>
<p>   and I'm glad that the information technology delegation that was led by</p>
<p>   Richard Alston to Israel was seen in such a highly successful light and</p>
<p>   I hope that the delegation dealing with agribusiness, which will shortly</p>
<p>   go to Israel, led by Phil Scanlan of Bonlac will be equally successful because</p>
<p>   in those two areas in particular, information technology and agribusiness,</p>
<p>   there is much to be shared between our two nations and our two societies.</p>
<p>   And it is through those sorts of links that we can build the modern 21st</p>
<p>   century characteristics of the relationship. The bonds of culture, the bonds</p>
<p>   of freedom, the people to people links, the cultural links, will always</p>
<p>   be there. But as Dr Johnstone exhorted us to do we should always keep our</p>
<p>   friendships in good repair and the friendship between Australia and Israel</p>
<p>   is no exception and we must seek in every way to build new ways of deepening</p>
<p>   and widening that friendship.</p>
<p>  And on that score I would like on behalf of the Government to address some</p>
<p>   words of thanks to you Mr Ambassador as you complete your tour of duty here</p>
<p>   in Australia. Over the last four years you have represented your country</p>
<p>   with great skill and dignity and grace. You have been a fine Ambassador</p>
<p>   for the people of Israel. You have understood the character of the relationship</p>
<p>   between our two nations and our two societies and you have interpreted in</p>
<p>   a new and fresh way the relevance of the links between our two societies</p>
<p>   as we move towards the 21st century. And I therefore thank you and your</p>
<p>   wife for the great work you have done in building even deeper links between</p>
<p>   our two societies and on behalf of everybody here I wish you well in your</p>
<p>   diplomatic and personal future as you leave this country with our immense</p>
<p>   gratitude and our immense goodwill for a job remarkably well done.</p>
<p>  In his introductory remarks Chris Anderson was kind enough to speak of the</p>
<p>   health and the strength of the Australian economy. And I want to spend just</p>
<p>   a few moments reinforcing the importance and the relevance of the strong</p>
<p>   economic climate that has been created in Australia over the last few years.</p>
<p>  There is little doubt that we are now experiencing the strongest economic</p>
<p>   fundamentals that Australia has seen since the late 1960s and in many ways</p>
<p>   the fundamentals are better now than they were then because then we were</p>
<p>   living in something of a world of economic unreality. We still then lived</p>
<p>   behind high tariff barriers. We lived under a centralised wage fixation</p>
<p>   system. We saw our markets as rather limited. The potential economically</p>
<p>   of the Asian Pacific region was yet to be fully realised and when we look</p>
<p>   back on those years, prosperous though they were, we could see that in a</p>
<p>   sense they were something of a calm before the economic storm which overtook</p>
<p>   the world in the 1970s with the end of fixed exchange rates, the quadrupling</p>
<p>   of oil prices and the other fundamental changes that occurred around the</p>
<p>   world.</p>
<p>  But now 30 years on our economy has been transformed. We are now an outward</p>
<p>   looking economy. We have low tariff barriers. We have a floating exchange</p>
<p>   rate. We are very much part of the global economy. We see information technology</p>
<p>   as being at the leading edge of economic achievement as we go into the next</p>
<p>   millennium. And importantly we've had governments, and I say governments</p>
<p>   because I am willing to give credit to my predecessors in one or two areas</p>
<p>   where I believe they undertook reforms that have been important to the long</p>
<p>   term economic strength of this country. And I think particularly of the</p>
<p>   decisions taken to deregulate the financial system and reduce tariff levels</p>
<p>   in Australia. But we have therefore had governments and most particularly</p>
<p>   the government that I've had the privilege of leading over the last three</p>
<p>   and a half years that have been willing to embrace fundamental change and</p>
<p>   reform and it is no accident that we have been able to stare down the worst</p>
<p>   economic downturn Asia has ever experienced.</p>
<p>  People often say to me that we have been lucky. Now we have been lucky.</p>
<p>   It's a great saying about Australia - the lucky country - coined by Donald</p>
<p>   Horne. But it's also true that you make your own luck. You make your own</p>
<p>   luck in life and you make your own luck as a nation. And we have made our</p>
<p>   own luck over the last few years. We could have squibbed it with the budget</p>
<p>   when we came into office. We could have said oh well if economic growth</p>
<p>   increases it will whirr back into surplus as somebody once famously said.</p>
<p>   We could have done that. We could have taken the easy way out in relation</p>
<p>   to industrial relations reform. We could have squibbed the fight that was</p>
<p>   needed to reform the Australian waterfront. We could have put taxation reform</p>
<p>   aside because it was too difficult. We could have gone soft on competition</p>
<p>   reform. We could have done all of those things. And if we had done all of</p>
<p>   those things, if we had sat on our economic reform hands after 1996, you</p>
<p>   would not now be experiencing the sort of buoyant business conditions that</p>
<p>   I think most Australians in business are now experiencing. And the economic</p>
<p>   strength we now have and the respect that is now afforded to Australia in</p>
<p>   international political and economic forums is no accident. It is a consequence</p>
<p>   of the policy changes that we have embraced over the last three and a half</p>
<p>   years.</p>
<p>  A few weeks ago I was in the United States and naturally I visited not only</p>
<p>   Washington, but also the financial centre of the world New York and I found</p>
<p>   there the greatest level of respect for the strength of the Australian economy</p>
<p>   that I have encountered at any time in the 25 years that I have been visiting</p>
<p>   that city in various political capacities. And the greatest thing to me</p>
<p>   out of what Australia has achieved over the last few years is the psychological</p>
<p>   boost it's given all of us. We've always been a confident people. We've</p>
<p>   always been an optimistic people. But there's also been quite a number amongst</p>
<p>   us who believe that when it gets to the rough and tumble of international</p>
<p>   economic competition sometimes we can't cut the mustard. But what I think</p>
<p>   out capacity to stare down this Asian economic downturn has done is that</p>
<p>   it's given to us a national self-confidence, a national self-belief, a national</p>
<p>   sense of economic achievement, the like of which this country has not had</p>
<p>   certainly not in my experience and perhaps in our experience since the end</p>
<p>   of World War II.</p>
<p>  So we are looking at a situation where our economic fundamentals are very</p>
<p>   strong. And as I frequently say this is not a council of complacency or</p>
<p>   smugness. You climb one economic reform hill and you find another in front</p>
<p>   of you. You never rest. You can never say well we've had three and a half</p>
<p>   very good years. Now we'll sit back and enjoy it and just let the economy</p>
<p>   look after itself. Once you start to do that people are entitled to ask</p>
<p>   the question are you any longer fit to be in government? Because the process</p>
<p>   of reform is an ongoing one It's an ongoing challenge. And that is why having</p>
<p>   successfully negotiated 85 to 90 per cent of our tax package through the</p>
<p>   Parliament, and I regret the fact that we didn't get the lot. We went to</p>
<p>   the Australian public with a package. The Australian public voted for that.</p>
<p>   I felt right up until Senator Harradine made that famous speech in the Senate</p>
<p>   I thought there was a chance of getting the lot through. And when he stood</p>
<p>   up and said "I can't", or "I can not", I think and he</p>
<p>   didn't. I knew that what we had to do was to sit down and negotiate with</p>
<p>   the Australian Democrats and see what we could get through.</p>
<p>  And as a result of that negotiation we didn't get everything but we got</p>
<p>   85 to 90 per cent of it. And that represents the most historic change to</p>
<p>   our taxation system since Federation.</p>
<p>  But the next shoe to fall as far as taxation reform is, of course, reforming</p>
<p>   our business taxation system. And I want first of all in my remarks about</p>
<p>   it today I want to record my immense gratitude to my friend and an eminent</p>
<p>   Australia businessman, John Ralph, who is here today, for his chairmanship</p>
<p>   and stewardship of this remarkably coherent examination of Australia's business</p>
<p>   taxation system. I also want to thank Rick Allet and Bob Joss who assisted</p>
<p>   John Ralph in preparing this review.</p>
<p>  It is without question the most comprehensive and detailed review of Australia's</p>
<p>   business taxation system ever. It is not, of course, the first review that's</p>
<p>   ever been carried out of Australia's taxation system. We have been regularly</p>
<p>   reviewing our system now for as long as I have been in Parliament. In fact,</p>
<p>   within a few months of my coming into Parliament in 1974 we got the report</p>
<p>   of the Asprey review which was commissioned by the late Billy Snedden when</p>
<p>   he was Treasurer in the McMahon Government. And now a quarter of a century</p>
<p>   on the big thing that has changed is that governments have begun to implement</p>
<p>   reviews of our taxation system.</p>
<p>  We have brought about fundamental change to the general taxation system.</p>
<p>   We are now about to focus on fundamental change of the business tax system.</p>
<p>   And we couldn't have been better served by the report that John has delivered.</p>
<p>   And I want to thank him very warmly on your behalf and on behalf of the</p>
<p>   Government for the tremendous dedication that he has brought to the task</p>
<p>   over the last nine or ten months.</p>
<p>  Now, I can't announce to you today, much as all that a few people suggested</p>
<p>   I should, I can't announce to you today all of the decisions that the Government</p>
<p>   has taken on the review that John and his colleagues have prepared. I can</p>
<p>   however take you as best I can into my confidence, the Government's confidence,</p>
<p>   regarding the process that we are going to bring to an examination of the</p>
<p>   review.</p>
<p>  We have commenced the detailed examination in Cabinet of the Ralph report.</p>
<p>   We haven't taken decisions, we still have a number of meetings to hold and</p>
<p>   quite a deal of analysis to undertake and no doubt at various stages quite</p>
<p>   a lot of questioning of members of the review group and people associated</p>
<p>   with preparation of the report.</p>
<p>  I am able to say to you that the Australian business taxation system will</p>
<p>   undergo quite fundamental change as a result of the recommendations of the</p>
<p>   report. And without canvassing areas of the report that I cannot canvass</p>
<p>   by dint of the fact that many elements of it do have a market sensitivity</p>
<p>   and until the Government has taken a decision as to which direction to go</p>
<p>   it is inappropriate to speculate.</p>
<p>  But I can say a number of things about the recommendations that are important</p>
<p>   for the Government's understanding and I hope the business community's understanding</p>
<p>   of it. And that is first and foremost it's very cohesive and integrated.</p>
<p>   It represents a total road map of the way forward so far as our taxation</p>
<p>   system is concerned. It's not one of those reports that, sort of, puts and</p>
<p>   takes and where you end up with something that lacks coherence and lacks</p>
<p>   integration. It's a report that quite properly is designed to make this</p>
<p>   country competitive in the 21st century.</p>
<p>  And I frequently say at gatherings like this that we are, for better or</p>
<p>   for worse, we are part of the global world economy. Those who think that</p>
<p>   in some way we can go back to the old days of shutting out the world and</p>
<p>   letting it pass us by are deluding themselves. We can't do that. And if</p>
<p>   we are to survive and if we are to do better than we are doing at the present</p>
<p>   time then, of course, we have to be part of the global economy. And that</p>
<p>   means we have to make investment decisions in this country as attractive</p>
<p>   as possible. It means that when we are looking at something like the capital</p>
<p>   gains tax, which I and the Government believe does need significant change</p>
<p>   and reform, we need to look at the attractiveness not only of Australians</p>
<p>   making investment in this country but also the attractiveness of Australia</p>
<p>   for people elsewhere to make investments. When we are looking at the attractiveness</p>
<p>   of Australia as a country in which to invest we must also look at the capacity</p>
<p>   of Australian companies to invest abroad and the value of the returns those</p>
<p>   Australians get from investing abroad.</p>
<p>  It is no secret that one of the issues that we need to resolve and one of</p>
<p>   the issues that's been a matter of very significant public debate in Australia</p>
<p>   over the last few months is, of course, the question of whether or not we</p>
<p>   might as a community opt for a lower general company tax rate, say 30 per</p>
<p>   cent, paid for in part by the removal of some existing provisions in the</p>
<p>   taxation legislation such as accelerated depreciation.</p>
<p>  Now, this has quite legitimately raised debate from within the business</p>
<p>   community about the relative impact on sectors. And that's a proper debate.</p>
<p>   If you are a manufacturer you will bring a particular view to tax reform.</p>
<p>   If you are in the service industries you will bring another view. If you</p>
<p>   are in the mining industry you will bring yet a third view.</p>
<p>  But it's important not only as we assess those competing claims, it's also</p>
<p>   important when the business community assesses those competing claims that</p>
<p>   they don't look at one section of taxation reform in isolation. It's not</p>
<p>   good enough for the manufacturers to say, well, I'll look at the impact</p>
<p>   on us, of say a lower company tax rate and less accelerated depreciation,</p>
<p>   without also looking at the aggregate impact of taxation reform generally.</p>
<p>   Because I think it is fair to say that what has already gone through the</p>
<p>   Parliament has in relative terms been of greater advantage to some sections</p>
<p>   of the business community than it has been to other sections.</p>
<p>  And what is important therefore when the Government reaches its decision</p>
<p>   as well as when business reaches its decision that all of us take into account</p>
<p>   the aggregate impact, the integrated impact, the whole impact of taxation</p>
<p>   reform and all aspects of it on the operations of business.</p>
<p>  I know that there is intense interest and speculation not only in the media</p>
<p>   but within the business community. And we are keen to take our decisions,</p>
<p>   to announce them and to see them implemented as soon as possible. But it</p>
<p>   is also desirable that we get those decisions right. You don't get one or</p>
<p>   two bites of business taxation reform. The opportunity that is in front</p>
<p>   of us at the moment is an opportunity that comes only once in a generation.</p>
<p>   And just as we took time to take our decisions in relation to general taxation</p>
<p>   reform and the result turned out to be a very positive one so it is with</p>
<p>   business taxation reform that we will take not an inordinate amount of time</p>
<p>   but we will take the right amount of time in order to reach the right decision.</p>
<p>  We will involve those in the community who should be involved in discussions</p>
<p>   to the appropriate degree. Can I point out that there has already been very</p>
<p>   extensive consultation between John and his committee and members of the</p>
<p>   business community in putting this reform proposal together.</p>
<p>  I find it very difficult on an occasion like this or indeed any other occasion</p>
<p>   when I am addressing a gathering of men and women who are involved in business</p>
<p>   in Australia to talk without turning a great sense of optimism and enthusiasm</p>
<p>   indeed excitement about the economic prospects that lie in front of this</p>
<p>   country.</p>
<p>  Chris said in his remarks that we occupy a very special place in the world.</p>
<p>   I have often said that Australia occupies a unique intersection. We are</p>
<p>   a nation that has deep links with the people and the nations of Europe.</p>
<p>   We are in many ways a projection of western civilisation in this part of</p>
<p>   the world. We share great democratic and liberal values in the broader sense</p>
<p>   of that word with the countries of North America.</p>
<p>  But here we are geographically in the Asian-Pacific region. And our cultural</p>
<p>   and political and other life is being enriched by the contribution of hundreds</p>
<p>   of thousands of Australians of Asian descent and Asian background. And when</p>
<p>   you put all of that together you find a country that is really quite unique.</p>
<p>   There is no other society in the world that has that combination of background,</p>
<p>   of values, that intersection of geography and history that Australia has.</p>
<p>   And it provides to us not only a tremendous economic opportunity but it</p>
<p>   provides to us a tremendous political opportunity. And the great change</p>
<p>   that I have felt as Prime Minister of Australia over the last few years</p>
<p>   as I have visited the nations particularly of our region is that the view</p>
<p>   of Australia has changed. Because of our economic achievement and strengths</p>
<p>   we are seen with a new respect. We no longer ask ourselves those rather</p>
<p>   silly questions of whether we are part of Asia, whether we are Asian, whether</p>
<p>   we are in Asia or we're enmeshed with Asia. What is happening now is we</p>
<p>   are just being ourselves as Australians in Asia. And we are finding, I think</p>
<p>   to our advantage, that we are no longer seen as the anxious outsider seeking</p>
<p>   admission into the rich club of Asia and the Pacific. Rather, we are seen</p>
<p>   as a very confident, self-assured, successful, where appropriate compassionate</p>
<p>   partner in the Asian-Pacific region.</p>
<p>  I am proud of the fact that we were strong enough economically to be, along</p>
<p>   with Japan, the only country in the world that contributed to the IMF bail-outs</p>
<p>   of Indonesia, Korea and Thailand. I am proud of the fact that we are seen</p>
<p>   in this part of the world as punching above our weight. Most of all, I am</p>
<p>   proud of the fact that we are seen as doing it with that special combination</p>
<p>   of unique Australian values that our history, our geography and our cultural</p>
<p>   inheritance has given us.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Chamber for the invitation to be here</p>
<p>   today. I salute those in the Israel-Australia Chamber of Commerce for the</p>
<p>   contribution they make to the vibrancy and the success of the business community</p>
<p>   in Australia. Many people in this room today have made a massive contribution</p>
<p>   to the economic strength and the economic vitality of our country. You have</p>
<p>   enriched the quality of the country's business life and many of you have</p>
<p>   also made a massive contribution to the quality of Australia's cultural</p>
<p>   life.</p>
<p>  As Prime Minister of Australia I am very conscious of that. I honour that</p>
<p>   contribution and I warmly thank you for what you are doing for Australia</p>
<p>   and in particular in the context of this gathering the great and enduring</p>
<p>   links between the people of Australia and the people of Israel. Thank you.</p>

<p> AUSTRALIA-ISRAEL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE</p>
<p>   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>
<p>   CROWN TOWERS, SOUTHBANK, MELBOURNE</p>
<p>  E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  David Griffiths from Macquarie Bank. A question for Mr Howard. If we look</p>
<p>   at the implications of the tax reform and look at particular things like</p>
<p>   accelerated depreciation and then we lay across that the Kyoto greenhouse</p>
<p>   effect and what that will have on West Australian business, it goes to the</p>
<p>   heart of a lot of our growing businesses which has driven our sector. My</p>
<p>   question is, have you looked at the regional implications of tax reform</p>
<p>   and things like the Kyoto and is there anything the Government can do to</p>
<p>   address those issues?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the answer is that we are, of course, very conscious of regional implications</p>
<p>   as we look at the Ralph Committee recommendations. It is true that a number</p>
<p>   of mining companies have expressed a concern about the situation where you</p>
<p>   might have a lower rate of company tax but accelerated deprecation would</p>
<p>   be withdrawn. Not all mining companies have put that point of view. It's</p>
<p>   also true, if you look at the analysis of the impact of taxation reform</p>
<p>   generally quite a lot of that analysis produces a situation where the benefits</p>
<p>   to the mining sector have been assessed as greater than the benefits to</p>
<p>   other sectors. And that is relevant to the exhortation I made in my earlier</p>
<p>   remarks that as people react to business tax reform and business changes</p>
<p>   I ask them to take into account the aggregate impact of taxation reform.</p>
<p>  Now, I know the contribution of the mining industry of Western Australia</p>
<p>   to this nation's export income. I think it's about 25 per cent of our export</p>
<p>   income comes from the mining exports of Western Australia. And I am very</p>
<p>   conscious of that and we don't intend to take decisions that are going to</p>
<p>   impose unfair burdens or to cripple the capacity or indeed retard the capacity</p>
<p>   of the mining industry to go on making a contribution. And I am also very</p>
<p>   conscious of the revenue climate of large mining projects in Australia.</p>
<p>   So the answer to your question shortly is, yes, I am aware of regional implications.</p>
<p>   The longer answer is the one you have just heard and we'll certainly endeavour</p>
<p>   to put all of those things into the balance.</p>
