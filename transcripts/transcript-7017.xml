PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 OCTOBER 1986<br />
ASSISTANCE PACKAGE FOR QUEENSLAND SUGAR INDUSTRY<br />
JOINT STATCAENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER FOR<br />
PRIMIARY INO~ USTRY<br />
The Commonwealth has today endorsed an agreement reached at<br />
officials level on the fourth and final element of the<br />
Commonwealth/ Queensland Sugar Industry Plan thereby completing<br />
arrangements for the plan's implementation.<br />
The final component of the Plan covers assistance for<br />
canegrowers. The other three components cover programs for<br />
industry : egulation, price support and assistance for sugar<br />
mill rationalisation.<br />
The Prime Minister has written today to the Queensland Premier<br />
advising of his concurrence with the agreement. He urged the<br />
Premier to give his consent, also, to allow the final component<br />
of the package to be implemented.<br />
Under the Plan the Commonwealth will provide up to $ 100 million<br />
over three years in price support and assistance for growers and<br />
for sugar mill development.<br />
The Prime minister said he was very pleased that all the elements<br />
of the Pla~ n had been settled.<br />
" It has been an extremely difficult set of negotiations, but we<br />
have now established a framework within which the viability of<br />
the sugar industry can be secured," he said.<br />
" Due to the persistence of the Commonwealth Government,<br />
canegrowers and their families can now look to a more secure<br />
future"'. The assistance to growers will be delivered under a new scheme<br />
although it will be based on the eligibility criteria and some<br />
other provisions of the existing Rural Adjustment Scheme ( RAS).<br />
The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, said growers had<br />
asked for a more flexible program than the RAS.<br />
" We have gone some way to accommodating this request," he said.<br />
" The new scheme is quite innovative. </p>
<p>2<br />
" Assistance will be available either as an interest subsidy or a.<br />
an up-front grant equivalent to that subsidy. Subsidy assistance<br />
wiji normally be 50% but in some circumstances would go as high<br />
as wThe Commonwealth's contribution to the assistance fund will be<br />
around $ 18 million over 3 years."<br />
mr gerin said that the agreement between officials cleared the<br />
way for the finalisation of the scheme's administration.<br />
He expected the scheme to be administered through the Queensland<br />
Industry Development Corporation. Growers would be advised<br />
shortly about the procedures for applying for assistance.<br />
" The scheme is intended to help growers take advantage of the<br />
recent deregulation of farm peaks and assignments," Mr Kerin<br />
said. " Growers now have the opportunity to fine-tune their operations<br />
with the acquisition/ sale of peak and assignment.<br />
" Preference will therefore be given to proposals for farm<br />
build-up, although there is scope for other forms of assistance."<br />
The prime Minister and Mr Kerin both urged growers to take<br />
advantage of the scheme.<br />
" The sugar industry has taken a beating in recent years. The<br />
world market is still depressed," Mr Hawke said.<br />
,, Nevertheless, the industry is basically sound and needs only<br />
relatively minor adjustment to see a big improvement in<br />
profitability. " The Sugar Industry Plan is aimed at facilitating that<br />
adjustment." </p>
