<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>Well thank you Administrator. Chief Minister, Admiral Fellin, and our other American guests, Defence Minister, Leader of the Opposition, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This has really been quite a remarkable day or so in commemorating a very important event in Australia's history. And I want to congratulate the Northern Territory government, the Chief Minister, and the committee for the Centenary of Federation from the Northern Territory for a marvelous commemoration. Absolutely marvelous.</p>
<p>I go to a lot of commemorations. It goes with the territory.   Most of them are very rewarding. Some of them, you know, of the political kind commemorate things I'd rather forget. But I thought this morning's service was as good as it gets. You had a bit of everything. You had history, you had a local flavour, you had the Australian/American association, you had a magnificent representation of the indigenous contribution to the defence of Darwin and the defence of the Northern Territory, and you had a recognition of the cosmopolitan character of this community.</p>
<p>And there it was in this beautiful memorial with the sea in the background and a permanent reminder to all of the Australians who were there that Darwin is the point that in a sense from time to time in our history is interpreted in ways we may not always like to the rest of the world. So I think Chief Minister, you and your mates up here have done a really first class job.</p>
<p>And it's a great year to be an Australian. It really is. It's always a great year to be an Australian but this a particularly good year because there are so many things about our history that we now have an opportunity to talk about and have it better explained to us. There's a growing passion and nostalgia in the Australian community for the history of this country. I've often said that the most moving experience I've had as Prime Minister over the last year, probably in the whole time I've been Prime Minister, was last ANZAC Day when Janette and I took part in a wonderful service at Gallipoli. And the best thing about it was that there were 12,000 to 15,000 young people there, young Australians mainly, but a lot of New Zealanders as well and others. And they were quite unselfconsciously wandering around with flags draped around their backs and with all sorts of representations of the Australian flag and hats. And the enthusiasm, you know that wonderful sort of friendly involvement, yet a reverence and respect for what was so important and sacred about the occasion.</p>
<p>We have really turned the corner I think in an understanding and respect for and passion for our history and I think that is a wonderful thing. You wouldn't have seen that 30 years ago. People would have been too self-conscious. It was not fashionable 30 years ago to wander around like that. And I just think it is something that whatever our views are on other things on occasions like this we forget our differences on other things. This is an Australian occasion. I think that is wonderful.</p>
<p>And what you've done here with this ceremony is give us your particular part of that because it is different in every part of the country. And the bombing of Darwin was very different because it was the first time there was this open assault on the Australian mainland and that's why it's so much a special part of our history..</p>
<p>So can I simply say to you Dennis and to your colleagues who've organised this it really has been a marvelous occasion in a marvelous year. To our American friends, I was saying to the Admiral we fought together for the first time at the battle of Hamel on the Western Front. I couldn't help saying of course the commanding officer on that occasion was Sir John Monash, probably the greatest field commander that Australia has produced and in the eyes of many people the greatest field commander of World War I.   But it was the beginning of a long partnership.</p>
<p>There's never been a significant military conflict since in which we haven't fought side by side. And again can I say that this is an occasion not only to honour our own history but particularly to include in that honouring a very special and treasured place for the contribution of the people of the United States have made. Well done and nice to have you.</p>
