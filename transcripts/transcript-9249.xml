PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THE HON P J<br />
KEATING, MP AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,<br />
THE RIGHT HON. J MAJOR, MP<br />
DOWNING STREET, LONDON, UK<br />
FRIDAY, 3 JUNE, 1994<br />
JM. rm delighted to see the Prime Minister here. He's here of course for<br />
the D-Day celebrations and we're delighted to see him here. We all<br />
owe a very great debt of gratitude to the many Australian servicemen<br />
who played such a remarkable role in that operation and in other parts<br />
of the war. We've had the opportunity of beginning our bilateral<br />
discussions; we hope to continue them, perhaps in more informal<br />
settings over the weekend.<br />
We have no bilateral problems worth mentioning; there's an extremely<br />
good relationship. Trade between our two countries has been growing<br />
very substantially both ways. In terms of trade flows and investment<br />
flows and we're very attracted to that trend continuing and have been<br />
examining how we might improve it. We've had the opportunity of<br />
reviewing the outcome of the GATT negotiations and are looking<br />
forward to the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, There<br />
have been a series of other regionaldiscussloni on the opportunities<br />
for further trade within the ASEAN region, looking at countries of<br />
mutual interest China and others spring to mind so it has been a<br />
welcome opportunity to exchange views and I'm delighted the Prime<br />
Minister could be here. I'll Invite him just to say a word and we'll then<br />
take any questions you may have.<br />
PK: Thank you, Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister said, we've both<br />
agreed there is no problem of substance in the relationship. Our two.<br />
way trade is growing stronger every year. Australia Is the fourth<br />
largest investor in Britain and Britain is the second largest investor in<br />
Australia, and our two-way investment that is, the Australia-Britain<br />
two-way investment Is the largest Investment relationship Britain has<br />
and the largest investment relationship Australia has. So, that, I think,<br />
underlines the relationship In commercial terms.<br />
In cultural terms I think that it is an ' important opportunity, which I<br />
welcome, to Join with the Prime Minister In these D-Day </p>
<p>commemorations and at least he was kind enough to refer to the role<br />
Australians had played. And, I will take the opportunity. as I will now.<br />
In saying that we will take this chance to pay tribute to Britain and<br />
Britons, In the fight for the democracies against fascism In Europe to<br />
load that fight, to carry the brunt of It, and as a consequence leave<br />
open the prospect of the landings in Normandy and the successful<br />
defeat of Nazism in Europe. so, rm looking forward to that opportunity<br />
over the weekend.<br />
The Prime Minister end I discussed, as he said, the outcome of the<br />
GATT. We've also discussed some of the social and political parallels<br />
In Australia In social and economic policy, and there are quite a<br />
number of profound ones. And, as he said, we'll take up the rest of the<br />
conversation over the course of the weekend.<br />
JM: Now we can ( ake a couple of questions if there are any.<br />
J: Mr Keating, I wonder given our long historical association with Britain,<br />
whether you Informed Mr Major that you wished to change the<br />
Austraia~ n flqg by taking the Union Jack out of the corner and I<br />
wonder, Mr Major, how you might react to that?<br />
PK: Well, this is not an active matter in Australia and hasn' been... for the<br />
Prime Minister's benefit, I was asked a question about this In<br />
Parliament the other day by our Opposition and that's promoted this<br />
question Which I have no more to say about than I said then or as I<br />
have said on many other occasions.<br />
J: Prime Minister Keating, did you discuss the developments in North,<br />
Korea and what is your vlew?<br />
I<br />
PK We didn't but I'm sure the Prime Minister and I would share a similar<br />
view that the defuellIng of reactors in North Korea should be subject to<br />
International inspections, that there must be a clear understanding on<br />
the part of the International Atomic Energy Agency that there Is not<br />
diversion of weapons and, at least for Australiao's part, we stand ready<br />
to join any international decision the United Nations might make<br />
Including sanctions which make the North Koreans accountable In<br />
terms of their nuclear facilities.<br />
J: Would Prime Minister Major regret the fact of Australia removing the<br />
Union Jack from the corner of ( he Australian national flag?<br />
JM: I think that is a matter for Australia. Australia is a very remarkable<br />
country, nothing that happens In any way Is going to damage the<br />
Instinctive relationship and the trade relationship that exists between<br />
the United Kingdom and Australia. It has been there, It Is very strong<br />
and it Isn't going to change In the future. Thank you vary much.<br />
PK: Thank you.<br />
