    <content><![CDATA[<p>The following text was delivered on behalf of the Prime<br />Minister by the Hon Ros Kelly, MP, Minister for Sport at the<br />launch of Evonne Goolagong's biography " Home The Evonne<br />Goolagong Story" in Sydney today.<br />7 October 1993</p>
<p>TEL PRIME MINISTER<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />AT THE LAUNCH OF " HOME! THE EVONNE GOOLAGONG STORY,<br />SYDNEY, 7 OCTOBER 1993<br />Its a very great pleasure to be here today to launch this autobiography of a<br />great Australian.<br />I have to admit that I felt some trepidation about doing so when I read in the<br />book that Evonne was never too thrilled about politicians she didn't know<br />making a big fuss over her.<br />However, I decided that it was worth the risk to put my regard for the book<br />and its subject on the record.<br />At the very least we share one thing in common our admiration for the<br />British tabloid press and their ability, as Evonne puts it, to provide a<br />thoughtful analysis of the situation.<br />Mind you, * Bold and brash, brilliant and boomingm and * the new Miss World'<br />are somewhat kinder than the headlines that I got.<br />But then, I wasn't a 19 year old Aboriginal woman who had just won the first<br />all Australian final in Wimbledon's * history, in a mere 63 minutes, against a<br />great defending champion.<br />As Evonne says, those 63 minutes were long enough to change forever the<br />course of her life.<br />That life, which In this volume unfolds from the history of her family in the<br />early part of this century to her present day rediscovery of Australia and her<br />place in It, makes for compelling reading.<br />With the assistance of Phil Jarratt, It is told in the same way in which we<br />remember Evonne playing tennis with grace and dignity, with flair and<br />excitement, with imagination.<br />And, most of all, with a sense of purpose and a palpable honesty.<br />7 Oct .93 11 : t 6 No U ILI t</p>
<p>TEL 2<br />Like other books of note, it can be appreciated on a number of levels.<br />You can read it, if you want to, 8$ a fairytale story of a Princess magazine<br />type of a young girl from the Australian Outback who gets plucked from<br />obscurity, becomes world famous, finds a handsome prince and lives happily<br />ever after.<br />But that's not a unique story, even among tennis players.<br />And If you were to read it like that, you would be missing out on so much of<br />what this book has to offer.<br />As Evonne relates, she's had and passed up the opportunity to make a<br />movie, because she always felt something was wrong with a Cinderella script.<br />And she passes up that opportunity in this book as well to our lasting<br />benefit. To quote her, " From 1953 my family lived in a white town, and from 1966 1<br />lived in a white society, but the former didn't make us white, and the latter<br />never made me anything other than what I am a proud Aboriginal woman, a<br />Wiradjuri Koori."<br />' Troughout my tennis areer I now realise I stayed close to my Aboriginal<br />roots: from my early days In Sydney through the occasions when I just<br />could not go on with the tennis tour until I had once again sat with my people<br />by the three rivers and felt the cooling breeze of their commonsense., That's<br />a wonderful phrase!<br />Perhaps the most moving part of the book for me are the chapters dealing<br />with Evonne's search for her Aboriginal identity on her return to Australia In<br />1991.<br />Where she drives across Battlecamp Range and has to stop and get out of<br />the car because the realisation of the Battlecamp massacre of 1873 is so<br />compelling. Where she returns to Wiradjuri country and follows her mother's<br />footsteps the Linda lines that take her into parts of the country, and parts<br />of herself, that she had never seen.<br />The story of Evonne Goolagong Cawley can be read, I think, as a story of our<br />times. A story where a young Aboriginal Australian is separated from her own<br />people and adopted by white parents as the best means of getting ahead.<br />Where she excels to the extent that she becomes one of the most popular<br />and admired Australians, but realises, for all her success, that something is<br />missing from her life. She finds it In her culture and identity. (. UCt I I NO viv r u),, L</p>
<p>T EL: Ot.. 11 : 55 No .010<br />3<br />She always come back to the same starting paint: that her iffe story and her<br />preoccupation with her Aboriginal ancestry are one and the same. That<br />being an Australian champion and an Aboriginal Australian are two sides of<br />the same coin.<br />There is a message for all Australians in this process of discovery that<br />Evonne has gone through and written so evocatively about a process that<br />was not always joyful and which sometimes involved considerable pain. A<br />process, nevertheless, which had to be followed through rigorously and<br />honestly. We can all be enriched by understanding and sharing in our culture and by<br />Identifying with this place Australia. We-. can all be enriched by<br />understanding and sharing In Aboriginal culture. And we can all be wiser and<br />better Australians by honestly confronting our past and the tragedy of<br />Aboriginal history since white settlement.<br />That Is precisely the goal of reconciliation the process that we are now<br />going through.<br />Reading Evonne's book provides a good dose of inspiration to carry on with<br />it. And so too do encouraging signs from other areas.<br />I want to say in passing how Impressed I was with the AFL's decision to<br />highlight the contribution of Australia's indigenous people to both our national<br />culture and to football at this years grand final in Melbourne. It was clearly<br />received with enormous enthusiasm by the crowd.<br />You have no doubt realised by now that I don't have a lot to say about the<br />history of Evonne's tennis career or Its many highlights.<br />Of course, I don't need to. Her deeds on the court are the stuff of legend,<br />and her place In the history of tennis is secure. To have seen her play, even<br />on television, Is something I am sure no-one would be able to forget.<br />No tedious two fisted backhand, no interminable baseline rallies, and a sweet<br />silence when she hit the ball. It Is perhaps an overused phrase, but she was<br />grace personifiled when she played.<br />People will remember Evonne for this, and they will remember that for<br />Evonne, perhaps more than any other player, tennis was above all else, a<br />game. I should conclude by saying that one thing In the book which impressed me<br />greatly was the amount of space that Evonne devotes to winning her two<br />Wimbledon titles less than a dozen pages in a total of four hundred.</p>
<p>ILL: (.-UCt .' 1z 1 1 r ci u r<br />4<br />That, apart from a true reflection of her modesty, seems to be also a<br />reflection of the fullness and richness of her life.<br />Of this book we can say, as her father Kenny Goolagong did on the occasion<br />of her first Wimbledon win, " Beaut, just Beaut".<br />To which we can surely add Read it, just read itl"<br />Thank you.</p>
