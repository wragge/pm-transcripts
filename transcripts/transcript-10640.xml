    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p> RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Welcome back Prime Minister, thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's nice to be here Ray.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Now, I heard you when you released that today officially, you called</p>
<p>   it "a moment of excitement". We don't often see John</p>
<p>   Howard excited.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am excited because I really believe in here that this is</p>
<p>   a very good plan for our country. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>You've got to sell it obviously to the people, we're</p>
<p>   going to see how you are going to see how you go tonight. But what</p>
<p>   about this image that it's "trust me I'm a politician."</p>
<p>   Is that the biggest thing you've got to try and get over?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think what you've got to get over is that this is good for</p>
<p>   all of us, it is good for the whole country, and it is fair to individual</p>
<p>   groups. Australians are very decent patriotic people and if they</p>
<p>   think a Government is putting something forward that is really good</p>
<p>   for the country and it is fair to them, they will support it. Now,</p>
<p>   I don't underestimate the challenge, and I'm going to</p>
<p>   go around the country, I'm going to talk to people, I'm</p>
<p>   going to answer their questions and I'm going to try and persuade</p>
<p>   them that it is not only good for the country but it is also good</p>
<p>   for them. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right, we are going to let you do that tonight.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll have a go.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>We'll go around the country. Let's go first to a family</p>
<p>   in Mildura, who are a low income family from Mildura.</p>
<p> Peter, MaryAnn Crisp and their three children Erin, David and</p>
<p>   Katie are battlers from the bush. The family's Mildura based</p>
<p>   citrus growing business brings in around $14, 000 a year and MaryAnn</p>
<p>   receives about $7000 a year from a property trust. Erin gets Austudy</p>
<p>   and MaryAnn also gets the full family payment for David and Katie.</p>
<p>   Because their income is so low, the Crisp's paid no tax last</p>
<p>   year. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right Peter and MaryAnn are with us now. Peter would you like</p>
<p>   to ask the Prime Minister a question?</p>
<p>PETER:</p>
<p>Certainly Ray. Mr Prime Minister, it's going to take me a</p>
<p>   long time to understand this package. It's quite a bit larger</p>
<p>   than I expected and I need time to do that before it gets distorted</p>
<p>   by the hype of an election. You've had the best brains in the</p>
<p>   nation working on this for while, how long have we got to figure</p>
<p>   this out before we go into election mode?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm going to leave it out there for as long as I believe</p>
<p>   is necessary for people to get a reasonable understanding. I haven't</p>
<p>   decided when the election is going to be, and I want to go around</p>
<p>   Australia talking to people and explaining the way their situation</p>
<p>   will be affected. I mean, I understand one of your daughters is</p>
<p>   on Austudy, well, for example, that Austudy is going to up by about</p>
<p>   4%. In your own situation there will be increases for some family</p>
<p>   benefits that will help you and certainly as a result of the changes</p>
<p>   to the income tax scales, given what I was told about your income</p>
<p>   last year, if that continues to obtain into the future then you</p>
<p>   certainly won't be paying any more tax and I think after the</p>
<p>   effects of a GST with the increases in the other payments your position</p>
<p>   will improve.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>We should make the point Peter that you haven't paid any tax</p>
<p>   year that your income was so low.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes well you will get increases in benefits that are there at the</p>
<p>   moment and I calculate on the basis of what I understand that you'll</p>
<p>   probably be about $15 - $16 better off, because one of the fallacies</p>
<p>   of this whole debate is that people think that everything goes up</p>
<p>   by 10%. In fact the across the board cost increase is only about</p>
<p>   2% because by removing all of those hidden taxes like wholesale</p>
<p>   taxes on a lot of household goods, there is a significant fall in</p>
<p>   the cost of a lot of items. So I do want a lot of this to go on</p>
<p>   over the next few weeks. I'm going all around Australia to</p>
<p>   talk to people to answer their questions.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Come on MaryAnn, just get in there and ask the PM a question.</p>
<p>MARYANN:</p>
<p>Well, the Prime Minister has partly answered my first question</p>
<p>   which was that as a farming family we have good years and bad years</p>
<p>   and sometimes we pay little or no tax, and I really can't see</p>
<p>   how tax cuts are going to be much help to us if we are already not</p>
<p>   paying any?</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Yes, but under the changes we've made to the family payments</p>
<p>   you get them irrespective of whether you are in the tax system or</p>
<p>   not, and that's one of the advantages. And of course, in the</p>
<p>   bush, the cuts in the excise on fuel will be of enormous benefit</p>
<p>   in reducing farm costs. The bush will get a tremendous boost out</p>
<p>   of this because the whole cost structure of country Australia is</p>
<p>   going to come down.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right, last question, can we go to you Erin. You are 18, you</p>
<p>   are going to vote this year for the first time in this election,</p>
<p>   whenever it is. What troubles you about this package?</p>
<p>ERIN:</p>
<p>Well I'm a bit unsure that the 4% increase in my Austudy is</p>
<p>   going to compensate for all the living expenses I'll have to</p>
<p>   take care of at Uni.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we think it will because we believe the, across the board</p>
<p>   living increase is going to be in the order of 2% and there's</p>
<p>   a guarantee in the package that at all times there'll be a</p>
<p>   1.5% cushion over and above the increase in prices across the board</p>
<p>   so that people on fixed incomes and people on allowances like you,</p>
<p>   and pensioners will be protected to the tune of about 1.5% above</p>
<p>   the actual cost increase.</p>
<p> MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right. We will move on though. To Peter and MaryAnn [inaudible]</p>
<p>   thank you for being part of tonight and thanks for your questions.</p>
<p>   Let's go on then to Adelaide, in fact Christine Small who is</p>
<p>   a single mum with two tiny children. Adelaide, let's have a</p>
<p>   look.</p>
<p> BACKGROUND:</p>
<p> Christine Small is a single mother from Adelaide with two children,</p>
<p>   Jack 8, little Lucy is 6. Chris is studying part time at university.</p>
<p>   She receives no maintenance from her ex husband so she and the children</p>
<p>   live on $603 a fortnight. A combination of soul parent's pension,</p>
<p>   family payment and Austudy. Chris is concerned that the services</p>
<p>   tax could increase the cost of childcare forcing her to drop her</p>
<p>   studies.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Christine, welcome. Can I ask you, do you feel better off tonight?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>Not really, I feel quite scared actually.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>What scares you?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>It feels like I've been left out. Can I ask Mr Howard a question?</p>
<p>   You talked about fairness in your speech. Under the new tax arrangements</p>
<p>   I'd like to know how much better Mr Costello's family</p>
<p>   will be off in comparison to mine.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can answer you with mine. I don't know the precise</p>
<p>   details of Mr Costello's family because his wife works and</p>
<p>   I don't know her income and I don't seek to know it. But</p>
<p>   the tax cut that I get is in the order of $85 a week. Anybody on</p>
<p>   my income gets that and of course the fact is I now pay about $2000</p>
<p>   a week in tax because of the size of my income. The other thing</p>
<p>   I can say about the Government's tax package is that we haven't</p>
<p>   dropped the top marginal rate of tax. In fact after $75,000 people</p>
<p>   on higher incomes don't get any dollar gain as a result of</p>
<p>   the tax cut. So we have tried in that sense to make it fair. Now,</p>
<p>   you, there was a question asked about childcare. Childcare is free</p>
<p>   of the GST. Therefore the actual cost of childcare should fall,</p>
<p>   quite apart from any increases in the childcare benefits that we're</p>
<p>   providing for....</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>Well you said that with rebates but my childcare costs have increased</p>
<p>   $20 a week because you cut [inaudible] payments as well.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can point out that in relation to this, because of the new</p>
<p>   GST system and because childcare is GST free, childcare operating</p>
<p>   expenses will be lower.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>I didn't actually ask you about childcare.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there was a reference to it in the introduction.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: </p>
<p>Yes I realise that but you've already said in your speech</p>
<p>   that childcare was going to be free from a GST.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Why are you frightened though?</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>Well I'd like to know whether there's any kind of guarantee</p>
<p>   that social security payments will increase if there is an increase</p>
<p>   in the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that will be put into the legislation.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>That they will rise with...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, the guarantee is that the pension will be increased in a way</p>
<p>   that it is always 1.5% above the price impact of the GST. And as</p>
<p>   far as the GST rate itself is concerned it can't be increased</p>
<p>   because...</p>
<p>CHRISTINE: </p>
<p>Mr Howard,...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well could I just finish? You did ask me the question, I'm</p>
<p>   trying to answer it. It can't be increased without the unanimous</p>
<p>   agreement of all of the State and Territory governments of Australia</p>
<p>   plus the Federal Government plus the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>   Now, of 24 years experience I've had in Parliament I've</p>
<p>   never found all of those governments and all of those people agreeing</p>
<p>   on one thing. I don't think there's a chance on Earth</p>
<p>   that you'd ever get their agreement to increase the rate. I</p>
<p>   think it's the greatest guarantee that anybody could give that</p>
<p>   it's not going to go up.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>Well Mr Howard you did promise not to bring in a GST so...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm being honest enough to go to the Australian</p>
<p>   people with this new plan asking them to pass an opinion on it.</p>
<p>   If they like it they'll support it, if they don't they'll</p>
<p>   vote against it. You can't be more open than that.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It doesn't seem fair.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Thank you Christine for talking to us, thanks for the questions.</p>
<p> CHRISTINE:</p>
<p>Thank you Ray.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Let's go to Sydney now. Let's go to Esme and Tony Smith</p>
<p>   who are self funded retirees. Have a look.</p>
<p> BACKGROUND:</p>
<p> Esme and Tony are self funded retirees with three grown up</p>
<p>   children and eight grand children. They've been living in the</p>
<p>   same house in Sydney for the last 40 years. With careful investments</p>
<p>   leave them roughly $500 a week. They lose $120 of that in tax. Esme</p>
<p>   and Tony receive no welfare payments and they have private health</p>
<p>   insurance. Like many on fixed incomes they worry about any rise</p>
<p>   in the cost of living. </p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Welcome both of you. Would you like to ask the PM something?</p>
<p>TONY:</p>
<p>Hello Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, how are you?</p>
<p>TONY:</p>
<p>Fine, pleased to have this opportunity. We're very concerned</p>
<p>   to preserve the earning capacity of life savings which represent</p>
<p>   5% of our gross salary over a period of 35 years from 1953 until</p>
<p>   1989. We don't have the capacity to top that up anymore with</p>
<p>   part-time work which unfortunately I had been able to do for several</p>
<p>   years until just now. That's hardly a question but we are concerned</p>
<p>   to preserve these savings of ours which are providing something</p>
<p>   like $360 a week.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let me set you at ease, on a number of fronts. Like anybody</p>
<p>   you'll get a tax cut and I think just on what you've told</p>
<p>   me is probably in the order of $15 or $16 a week. In addition to</p>
<p>   that, because you have investment income, you'll get access</p>
<p>   to the savings bonuses which is $1000 for everybody 60 years and</p>
<p>   over and there's an additional $2000 for self-funded retirees</p>
<p>   of pensionable age. Then on top of that, if you are in receipt of</p>
<p>   any share income and you will get the benefit, if you get any franked</p>
<p>   dividends, and people in your situation will know what they are.</p>
<p>   That's the dividend you get after the tax has been paid by</p>
<p>   the company, and if the company rate's more than the tax rate</p>
<p>   you're paying at the moment you lose the difference. Well under</p>
<p>   our new plan you'll get it. So that if your tax rate's</p>
<p>   say is, 20%, and 36%'s been paid on the share the tax department</p>
<p>   will send you the other 19% and that is a particular boost for self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees. And one other thing is, you've got private health</p>
<p>   insurance. Now you're going to get 30% of the cost of that</p>
<p>   private health insurance either through the tax system, if that's</p>
<p>   what you want, or simply by going along to the government office</p>
<p>   and presenting the insurance premium receipt and they'll give</p>
<p>   you 30% of it.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right. Esme, quick question for the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>ESME:</p>
<p>Well I can only say that, as it's a broad based tax and it</p>
<p>   seems to be, it's going to be of an advantage to the self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees, and I only hope that the 10% is really set in place and</p>
<p>   will not be raised, although the Prime Minister has said that by</p>
<p>   law it will not be raised so I hope that will be true.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it certainly will be.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right. Well we thank you both for that. Thanks for talking</p>
<p>   to us.</p>
<p>TONY:</p>
<p>Thank you very much indeed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> MARTIN:</p>
<p>Welcome back. We're talking live with Prime Minister John</p>
<p>   Howard. We're talking to a bunch of Australians all around</p>
<p>   the country. Let's go to Melbourne now to a couple who we could</p>
<p>   call a middle income couple. Have a look at this.</p>
<p> BACKGROUND:</p>
<p> Paul and Anne Duffy are middle income earners from Brunswick</p>
<p>   in Melbourne. They have two children, Emily and Hugh. As an engineer</p>
<p>   Paul earns around $50,000 a year and pays about $14,000 in tax.</p>
<p>   Because Anne stays at home with the children she receives the basic</p>
<p>   parenting allowance of $110 a fortnight.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Welcome to us. Would you like to ask question to the Prime Minister?</p>
<p>ANNE:</p>
<p>Yes. Mr Howard, how will you ensure that where a GST means a lower</p>
<p>   tax rates, that the savings will be passed on in full to the consumer.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're going to get the Australian Competition Commission</p>
<p>   with the threat of $10 million fines to make sure that happens.</p>
<p>   And your family will do very well out of this plan because....</p>
<p>ANNE:</p>
<p>How many people are you going to need to do this though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they'll be given all the people they need.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>To police it you mean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well just resuming, so far as your own situation is concerned,</p>
<p>   as I understand from the introduction, your husband's income</p>
<p>   is about $50,000 and you have one child under four therefore you</p>
<p>   will be particularly advantaged by the fact that he'll have</p>
<p>   a tax free threshold of $13,000 and when you add in the tax cuts</p>
<p>   and the additional family benefits and even after allowing for the</p>
<p>   GST I'd estimate that you will be $50 a week better off. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Do you feel better off tonight folks?</p>
<p>PAUL:</p>
<p>Not really no.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Well talk to me Paul. Ask the Prime Minister what your concern</p>
<p>   is.</p>
<p>PAUL:</p>
<p>Well, there seems to be a great emphasis on providing tax incentives</p>
<p>   for everybody and putting money in everybody's pocket but over</p>
<p>   the past few years there has been lots of very savage cuts in just</p>
<p>   basic services to people like hospitals and education and training</p>
<p>   of people who are unemployed, how are those things going to be continued</p>
<p>   to be funded and if there is a bigger pool of money available from</p>
<p>   the GST why can't some money be put back into those services</p>
<p>   that you cut rather than out people's pockets?</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Well, we have done that. Last week I announced that the Federal</p>
<p>   Government would put another $915 million into the public hospitals</p>
<p>   systems of the states over five years, and one of the other things...</p>
<p>ANNE:</p>
<p>Why are you putting $13 billion as tax cuts. The amount you are</p>
<p>   talking about is quite small compared to $13 billion. I mean there's</p>
<p>   been millions cut from education and health, as just two examples.</p>
<p>   Why can't some of that $13 billion go into health, education,</p>
<p>   things that all of us especially low and middle income earners will</p>
<p>   benefit from?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think low and middle income earners will benefit from tax</p>
<p>   cuts, because tax cuts give you more disposable income...</p>
<p>ANNE:</p>
<p>But I would sooner see my children benefiting by a good education,</p>
<p>   good health care for all of us. We are all concerned about health</p>
<p>   care.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this package will enable people to take out private health</p>
<p>   insurance a lot more readily and one of the ways in which I would</p>
<p>   have thought your children would have been benefited would be if</p>
<p>   you had more disposable income in your pocket and you were able</p>
<p>   to spend more on their necessities, and I think, as a parent myself,</p>
<p>   and as somebody who talks to a lot of parents, I know that one of</p>
<p>   their constant pleas is that they would like to have a little more</p>
<p>   in the pocket each week so that those little additional things that</p>
<p>   they would like to buy for their children, they can ....</p>
<p>ANNE:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I would like to ask a question about this please.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Sorry Anne, we will have to go on, we have to go to Perth as well,</p>
<p>   but you sound like a current affairs interviewer there. We'll</p>
<p>   come back to you please Anne and Paul. Stay with us. We'll</p>
<p>   come back to you. Let's go to Perth though, to an aged pensioner</p>
<p>   there, Audrey Warren.</p>
<p> BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Audrey Warren is a 69 year old pensioner from Perth. At the moment</p>
<p>   she receives almost $355 a fortnight. Rent takes up one-fifth of</p>
<p>   that. The pension is Audrey's only source of income. In one</p>
<p>   year, she has just over $9000 to live on. So she is one of those</p>
<p>   most worried by a GST.</p>
<p>Audrey, welcome. Would you like to ask the Prime Minister a question?</p>
<p>AUDREY:</p>
<p>Yes I would. Mr Prime Minister, one of things that happens with</p>
<p>   pensioners at the moment is that our pensions are indexed to the</p>
<p>   CPI, and the CPI doesn't cover things like food and clothes</p>
<p>   and electricity and gas and so on. So that our pension has lagged</p>
<p>   the way behind with no CPI rises in the last two years, and it lags</p>
<p>   away behind. That pension that I get only actually is $177.30 a</p>
<p>   week, which is really not very much. 4% added to that is only going</p>
<p>   to make about $7 difference, less than $8 difference. Are you thinking</p>
<p>   at any time of changing the system so that pensions are actually</p>
<p>   indexed to the cost of living or the CPI counts the cost of living?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Audrey, I have to disagree with you. The CPI does include</p>
<p>   those things. And the CPI is a very comprehensive measure of cost</p>
<p>   of living increases.</p>
<p>AUDREY:</p>
<p>Okay. So...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sorry to.... you know, what you said a moment ago was</p>
<p>   wrong, and I don't think it is fair that I allow it not be</p>
<p>   corrected. I mean, the CPI measure includes all of the things that</p>
<p>   you mentioned and that is why it is quite a fair adjustment and</p>
<p>   under this plan the 4% increase will more than compensate, more</p>
<p>   than cover the estimated increase in the cost of living.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Is Audrey getting any</p>
