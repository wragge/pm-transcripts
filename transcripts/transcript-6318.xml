1, AUSTRAIA L,<br />
TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE STATE GUEST HOUSE, PEKING 8 FEB, 84<br />
TO PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS OFFICE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E. AND O. E. PROOF ONLY.<br />
P. M. LET ME SAY THAT I FOUND THE TALKS WITH PREMIER ZHAO AS I<br />
EXPECTED EXTRAORDINARILY USEFUL AS I FOUND THEM IN4 CANBERRA. HE IS I<br />
BELIEVE AN OUTSTANDING LEADER, ARTICULATE AND COMMUNICATIVE AND ONE<br />
WITH WHOM IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE VERY USEFUL AND DIRECT INTER-CHANGE<br />
OF THOUGHTS. TODAY'S SESSION COVERED IKTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND AS<br />
YOU KNOW TOMORROW WE WILL BE GOING ON TO DISCUSS REGIONAL AND<br />
BILATERAL MATTERS.<br />
AT THE OUTSET I CONVEYED TO PREMIER BY WAY OF SETTING THE CONTEXT<br />
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN THE LAST<br />
DECADE, PROBABLY THE OUTSTANDING FEATURE OF IT HAS BEEN THE<br />
TRANSLATION OF CHINA IN THAT RELATIONSHIP FRO'I A SYMBOLIC AND<br />
DIVISIVE ISSUE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 70' S TO A POSITION IHERE CHINA<br />
IS NOW A MAJOR PARTNER OF AUSTRALIA IN THE ECONOMIC AND TRADING SENSE<br />
AND POLITICALLY A COUNTRY WITH WHOM WE SHARE A WIDE NUHBER OF COMMON<br />
BASIC PERCEPTIONS.<br />
IN THAT OPENING CONTEXT I TALKED WITH THE PREMIER ABOUT THE FACT THAT<br />
SINCE WE LAST MET IN APRIL OF 1983, THE WORLD IS A LESS STABLE AND<br />
SECURE PLACE AND THAT THE TENSIONS INVOLVED AND RIVALRY BETW. EEN THE<br />
TWO SUPERPOWERS HAS INCREASED AND IS REFLECTED SADLY IN THE SUSPENSION<br />
OF THE INF TAI.'( S AND IN REGARD TO START NO DATE HAVING BEEN<br />
SET FOR THE RESUMPTION. AND I PUT TO THAT PREMIER THAT THIS WAS A<br />
MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN TO AUSTRALIA BECAUSE AS CENTRAL TO OUR POSITION<br />
IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IS OUR PURSUIT OF THE ISSUE OF ARMS<br />
CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT.<br />
I SPENT A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME ON THIS ISSUE AND SAID THAT OUR<br />
CONCERNS WERE IN THE ARE OF NUCLEAR TESTING AND NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION.<br />
MAY I* SAY ON THE QUESTION OF NUCLEAR TESTING I<br />
CONVEYED TO THE PREMIER OUR STRONG HOPE THAI CHINA WHICH HAS NUN NOT<br />
TESTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE SINCE THE LATTER PART OF 1980 WOULD NOT<br />
RESUME ATMOSPHERIC NUCLEAR TESTING.<br />
IN THE AREA OF NON-PROLIFERATION I PUT THE VIEW TO THE PREhIER THAT<br />
WHILE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY HAD SOME DIFFERENCES WITH US ON THE<br />
QUESTION OF TIHE NPT, THERE WERE CERTAIN BASIC ISSUES THAT I WANTED TO<br />
BE. AND THAT WAS THAT WE UNDERSTOOD AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOGICAL<br />
BASIS OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE NPT WS, IF YOU LIKE, TIHE BARGGAIN<br />
CONCEPT THAT ON THE BASIS OF THE TWO SUPERPOWERS NOT ENGAGING IN<br />
VERTICAL PROLIFERATION THERE WOULD BE AN ACCEPTANCE ON THE PART OF<br />
THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE WORLD THAT THEY SHOULD NOT THEMSELVES BECOME<br />
INVOLVED IN THE NON-PEACEFUL USE OF ACQUISITION OF NUCLEAR CAPACITY. </p>
<p>HAVING SAID THAT THAr JF COURSE WAS THE CONCEPTUAL LOGICAL BASIS OF<br />
THE NPT, I PUT TO THE PREMIER THAT THE FACT THAT, IF YOU LIKE, THE<br />
BARGAIN HAD N01 BEEH ADIERED TO BY THE TWNO SUPERPOWERS AND THAT<br />
ATHEREIN LAY A GREAT RISK TO THE WORLD A POSSIBLE OUTBREAK OF<br />
HOSTILITIES. AND THAT DID NOT OF ITSELF CON'STITUTE ANY REASON<br />
LOGICALLY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS FOR NOT BEING CONCERNED WITH THE<br />
HORIZONTAL RISK. AND I PU T TO HIM BOTH IN OPENING A'ND IN LATER<br />
STAGES THAT WE HAVE A PERCEPTION THAT IN THE YEARS AHEAD THE RISK TO<br />
THE WOPLD, POTENTIAL RISK TO THE WORLD, OF THE ACQUISITION AND POTENT<br />
-IAL USE OF BELIGERE14T NUCLEAR CAPACITY IS SOMETHING OF GREAT CONCERN<br />
TO US.<br />
THIS DISCUSSION OCCUPIED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN MY EXPOSITION<br />
AND THE PREMIER'S RESPONSE AND LATER A REJOINDER OF MINE. BUT I<br />
THIN4K IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY, AS I PUT TO THE PREMIER THAT WE<br />
WELCOME THE SIGNS EVIDENT IN RECENT TIME IN4CLUJDING PARTICULARLY<br />
OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE PREMIER IN WASHINGTON AND REPEATED AGAIN TN<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH ME, SIGNS OF AN INCREASING DEGREE OF CONVERGENCE OF<br />
CONCERN BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES ON THESE ISSUES. AND INDEElP WE' YE<br />
WELCOMED THE VERY RECENT INDICATIONS WE'VE RECEIVED, JUST WITHIN THE<br />
LAST 48 HOURS FROM THE CHINESE DELEGATION ON THE COMMITTEE ON<br />
DISARMAMENT OF THEIR DESIRE TO CD-OPERATE CLOSELY WITH US IN THAT<br />
PARTICULAR FORUM.<br />
I WON'T GO INTO ANY MORE DETAILS ON THAT BUT I WANT TO) MAR E THE<br />
BASIC POINTS TO YOU. FIRSTLY, THAT TH4E QUESTION OF ARMS CONTROL AND<br />
DISARMAMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE NUCLEAR FIELD OF COURSE, OCCUPIED A<br />
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF OUR TIME.<br />
AND SECONDLY, THAT WHILE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN4 US IN THE<br />
MECHANICS, IF YOU LIKE, IN THE APPROACH PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO THE<br />
NPT WHICH AS YOU KNOW CHINA HAS NOT ADHERED TO NEVERTHELESS WE<br />
WELCOME THE CONVERGENCY OF OBJECTIVES AND THE INCREASING SIGNS OF A<br />
CAPACITY FOR CO-OPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIE: S IN THIS AREA.<br />
FROM THOSE BROAD ISSUES I WENT TO A NUMBER OF PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF<br />
T14E INTERNATIONAL SCENE.-I WELCOMED THlE STRENGTHENING OF RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES REFLECTED IN THE RECENT AVERY<br />
SUCCESSFUL VISIT OF THE PREMIER TO THE UNITED STATES. AND W4E WERE<br />
GRATEFUL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PLAY SOME PART FOLLOWING OUR<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PREMIER LAST YEAR IN CONVEYING CERTAIN CONCERNS<br />
OF THE CHINESE TO THE UNITED STATES. IN TURN THE PREMIER EXPRESSED<br />
GRATIFICATION TO US FOR THAT.<br />
IN THE AREA OF NORTH EAST ASIA WE EXPRESSED TODAY OUR CON4CERN THAT I<br />
HAVE EXPRESSED IN AUSTRALIA AND EARLIER ON IN THIS VISIT ON THE<br />
EXTENSION OF SOVIET OFFENSIVE CAPACITY WITHIN TH4E REGION AND TARGETT<br />
ED ON THE REGION. AND I EXPRESSED AGAIN OtJR CONCERN THAT THE<br />
DISCUSSIONS IN EUROPE IF AND WHEN THEY RESUME IN THE INF AREA WOULD<br />
NOT IN ANY SENSE B3E SATISFACTORY IF THE SOVIET DEPLOYMENT W-ERE TO BE<br />
CHANGED FROM TARGEITIN4G ON EUROPE TO THIS REGION. IT W4AS IN THIS<br />
CONTEXT OF TALKING ABOUT THE ADDED TENSION IN THE REGION OF NORTH<br />
EAST ASIA THAT I WENT TO THlE QUESTION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. I<br />
EXPRESSED OUR CONCERN 10 THE PREMIER TH1AT THIS REMAINED A POTENTIAL<br />
TROUBLE POINT FOR WORLD PEACE. I PUT TO HIM THE REALITIES, THE<br />
UNAVOIDABLE REALITIES, THAT THERE ARE TWO GOVERNMENTS, TWO DISTINCT<br />
ENI ITIES ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA THAT HAS TO BE RECOGNISED, ANBM </p>
<p>THAT THE ESSENCE OF GETTING A RESOLUTION OF THIS POTENTIAL CONFLICT<br />
IS THE NECESSITY FOR DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THOSE TWO ENTITIES. I<br />
EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE CONCEPT OF TRIPARTITE TALKS ADVANCED<br />
RECENTLY BY THE DPRK WAS NOT, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, ACCEPTABLE TO THE<br />
REPUBLIC OF KOREA. AND I EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
WORLD LIKE CHINA AND AUSTRALIA, EACH IN THEIR WAYS WITH CONTACTS WITH<br />
ON THE ONE HAND THE DPRK AND OURSELVES WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA,<br />
THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY SOME PART IN PRODUCING A SITUATION,<br />
WHETHER IT BE IN A QUADRIPARTITE OR EVEN IN A LARGER FRAMEWORK, WHERE<br />
A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES COULD TAKE PLACE I CAN SAY THAT<br />
THERE WAS AGREEMENT, A CONGENIAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN US OF THE<br />
POTENTIAL DANGER AND OF THE NEED TO SECURE A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF<br />
THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THOSE TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
I DID RAISE WITH THE PREMIER THE QUESTION OF NAMIBIA AND I DID THIS<br />
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WHEN HE'D BEEN TO AUSTRALIA HE HAD RAISED THE<br />
ISSUE WITH ME. I WAS ABLE TO REPORT TO THE PREMIER THE VERY USEFUL<br />
DISCUSSIONS I'D WITH SAM NJOMO, THE LEADER OF HAPO, WHEN I WAS IN<br />
DELHI AND INDICATED TO THE PREMIER OUR V!-W THAT THE QUESTION OF<br />
LINKAGE WAS NOT WE BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT WAS PRODUCTIVELY CAPABLE OF<br />
BEING PURSUED THAT THERE WAS A NEED, WE BELIEVE, FOR DIRECT TALKS<br />
WITH THE FRONT LINE STATES AND INDEED DIALOGUE WITH SHAPO. THAT I<br />
HAD FOLLOWING MY TALKS WITH NJOMO AND MY CONVICTION OUT OF THOSE<br />
TALKS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO INTENTION ON THE PART OF A FREE NAMIBIA<br />
TO BE A SITE FOR SOVIET BASES, OR THERE WOULD NOT BE AN'UNWELCOMING<br />
ATTITUDE TO FODEIGN INVESTMENT. THAT HAVING RECEIVED THOSE<br />
ASSURANCES FROM HIM I CONVEYED THOSE VIEWS TO THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
THAT I HOPED THAT THERE COULD BE FOLLOWING THOSE EVENTS SOME<br />
LOOSENING UP OF THE SITUATION IN THAT AREA.<br />
I INDICATED TO THE PREMIER THAT IN FACT THERE DID SEEM TO BE SOME<br />
SLIGHT EVIDENCE OF MOVING TO THAT DIRECTION WHICH WE WELCOMED. AND<br />
THE PREMIER EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THAT AREA<br />
AND HIS FEELINGS OF WHAT WAS OCCURRING.<br />
WITHOUT THE MATTER BEING DEVELOPED IN ANY WAY I SIMPLY INDICATED TO<br />
THE PREMIER ALSO THAT WE STILL REGARDED THE MIDDLE EAST AS THEY DID<br />
AS AN AREA OF POTENTIAL CONFLICT TO ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD AND<br />
INDICATED OUR GREAT CONCERN WITH THE INCREASING TRAGEDY OF LEBANON.<br />
WE DID NOT PURSUE THAT I MERELY INDICATED THAT IF WE WERE, AS HE'D<br />
ASKED ME TO GIVE A CONSPECTUS OF OUR VIEWS ON THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
SITUATION, I OBVIOUSLY HAD TO REFER TO THAT, BUT WE DIDN'T PURSUE THE<br />
DISCUSSION FURTHER.<br />
FINALLY, I INDICATED TO HIM THAT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IF ONE WAS<br />
TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION YOU COULDN'T JUST REFER TO<br />
THE POLITICS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. ONE HAD TO REFER TO<br />
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT HAD BEEN PERLEXING AND BEDEVILLING<br />
THE WORLD IN RECENT YEARS. I INDICATED TO HIM THAT IT WAS<br />
PROBABLY APPROPRIATE THAT WE PICK LIP AN ISSUE AND THE INITIATIVES<br />
THAT WE HAD BEEN TAKING IN REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE LIBERALISATION<br />
AND A REGIONAL APPROACH TO THAT. TOMORROW WE HAVE AGREED THAT<br />
WE WILL DO THAT. </p>
<p>WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN4 THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THE SORTS OF TH4INGS<br />
THAT I PUTP SOME BROA-D IN4DICATION OF THE PEESPONSES OF THE PREMIER. I<br />
1WOULD REPEAT AGAIN THAT IT WAS A DIALOGUE BETWIEEN TWO VERY FRIENDLY<br />
NATIONS AND I REPEAT THAT AT THE EN0 OF 1141 THREE HOURS I HAD WITH<br />
PREMIER ZHAO I AM EVEN MORE ST RENGTHENED AND CONFIRMED IN MY VIEW<br />
THAT YOU KNOW I'VE EXPRESSED TO YOU BEFORE, THAT AUSTRALIA INDEED<br />
DOES HAVE EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF<br />
CHINA, THAT IT IS A RELATIONSHIP OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO US<br />
BILATERALLY, TO EACH OF US, AND IMPORTANTLY WE DO S1HARE COMMON<br />
PERCEPTIONS IN REGARD TO I THINK THE HOST IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CONCERN<br />
IN THE WORLD TODAY. WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES THAT DO EXIST, THERE<br />
ARE AGREED POINTS OF DEPARTURE AND COMMON OBJECTIVES BETWEEN US.<br />
JOURNALIST: HOW DID PREMIER ZHAO REACT WHEN YOU EXPRESSED..<br />
P. M. THERE WAS NO0 SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO THAT BUT I MAY SAY THAT HE<br />
RECEIVED THE OBSERVATION CONGENIALLY. WE GOT NO PROMISES OR INDICATIONS,<br />
I SUPPOSE IT WAS A BIT TOO MUCH TO EXPECT THAT YOU WOULD H4AVE<br />
GOT SPECIFIC INDICATIONS. BUT ALL-I CAN SAY IS THAT I PUT OUR<br />
CONCERN STRONGL. Y TO THE PRESIDENT.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ON KAMPUCHEA?<br />
P. M. NO, WE DELIBERATELY DID NOT GO TO THAT TODAY. THAT WILL BE<br />
A MATTER TO BE EMBRACED WITHIN REGIONAL ISSUES TFOMORROW.<br />
JOURNALIST: WHAT WAS HIS RESPONSE TO YOUR CONVEYANCE TO HIM OF THE<br />
ROK ' S REQUEST FOR WARMER RELATIONS ' WITH THE CHINESE..<br />
WELL, LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR YOU REFER TO MY CONVEYING OF<br />
THEIR REQUEST. THE WAY IN WHICH THIS OCCURRED WAS THAT I EXPRESSED<br />
OUR CONCERN, AUSTRALIA'S CONCERN, ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A WIDER<br />
CONFLICT AND ARISING OUT OF THE DIFFEREN4CES BETW-EEN4 THE TWO1 GOVERNMENTS<br />
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, AND IN THAT CONTEXT I INDICATED THAT I<br />
BELIEVED THAT ONE OF TH4E OPTIMISTIC FEATURES OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br />
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN THE WAY IN WHICH CHINA HAD OPENED<br />
UP ITS RELATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL, AND PERHAPS<br />
MOST PARTICULARLY WITH THE UNITED STATES. AND I EXPRESSED THE<br />
HOPE THAT AGAINST THE SITUATION WHERE CURRENTFLY THEY DID NOT HAVE<br />
FORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE P0K THAT THEY WOULD SEE THEIR W4AY CLEAR TO<br />
DO THAT. AND IN THAT CONTEXT I WAS ABLE TO SAY TO THEM THAT IT HAS<br />
CLEARLY THE WISH OF THE ROK THAT THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. NOW THE PREMIER<br />
KEENLY OBSERVED WHAT I HAD TO SAY ON THAT IT WAS CLEARLY A MATTER<br />
OF INTEREST TO HIM. AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT TIME W4ILL TELL WHAT<br />
THE RESPONSE WILL BE.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID YOU MAKE ABOUT ALL NATIONS SIGNING THE NPT..<br />
P. M1. : THE WAY I PUT IT WAS THAT TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF OUR AMERICAN<br />
FRIENDS, THE NPT IS THE ON4LY GAME IN TOWN. AND THAT WE THOUGHT IT<br />
APPROPRIATE THAT THAT BEING THE ONLY AVENUE IN THE FORMAL SENSE, THAT<br />
IT SHOULD BE PURSUED AND THAT HE INTEND TO PURSUE IT. AND<br />
PARTICULARLY I EXPRESSED THE H4OPE THAT WHILE CHINA, BECAUSE IT AT<br />
THI1S STAGE REGARDED THE NPT AS SOMEWHAT DISCRIMINATORY AND IT HAD NOT<br />
ITSELF B3ECOME AN ADHERENT SIGNATORY, NEVERTHELESS I EXPRESSED THE<br />
HOPE THAT IT WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY GIVE SUPP~ ORT TO THE NPT ADVERSARY<br />
STATES THAT ONE CAN IDENTIFY IN THE W4ORLD TODAY.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINI4STER DO YOU HAVE ANY RFACTION TO THL EVENTS<br />
IN THE LEBANON IN THE LAST 24 HOURS OR 48 HOURS. </p>
<p>YES, YOU KNOW THAT I'VE EXPRESSED IN THE PARLIAMENT AND ELSEWHERE<br />
A SENSE OF GREAT TRAGEDY ABOUT THE LEBANON. I'VE DONE THAT FOR<br />
SOME CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME NOW AND EXPRESSED SOME SENSE 3F<br />
PESSIMISM. AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE RECENT EVENTS CLEARIY<br />
CONFIRM THOSE VIEWS THAT I'VE EXPRESSED BEFORE. THERE IS LITTLE THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN DO TO ALTER THE COURSE OF EVENTS. I WOULD SIMPLY ON<br />
BEHALF OF AUSTRALIA EXPRESS THE PLEA TO EVERYONE CONCERNED, THAT IS<br />
THE COUNTRIES BORDERING LEBANON AND THE FACTIONS WITHIN LEBANON<br />
ITSELF, THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSCIOUS OF THE HORRENDOUS LOSS OF LIFE<br />
THAT HAS BEEN SUFFERED IN THAT COUNTRY PARTICULARLY SINCE ' 75. AND<br />
ISSUE A PLEA TO ALL NATIONS AND THE FACTIONS CONCERNED TO TRY AND<br />
FIND A WAY TO A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS IN THAT TRAGICALLY<br />
SCARRED COUNTRY.<br />
JOURNALIST: DO YOU BELIEVE THE AMERICAN TROOPS SHOULD STAY THERE?<br />
I'M NOT HERE TO PUBLICLY ADVISED THE UNITED STATES ON ITS<br />
POLICY IN REGARD TO THE LEBANON.<br />
JOURNALIST: AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS ARE CLEARLY IN SOME DANGER THERE.<br />
WOULD YOU CONSIDER WITHDRAWING THEM.<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A MATTER WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER<br />
CONSIDERATION IN OUR APPROPRIATE QUARTERS. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS<br />
ADVANCED BY ME GOING BEYOND T;' AT. IT IS A MATTER WHICH IS UNDER<br />
CONSIDERATION. JOURNALIST: DO YOU KNOW OF THEIR SAFETY, PRIME MINISTER?<br />
P. M. ALL I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS MORNING, YOU WILL APPRECIATE THAT<br />
WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR AND THEN GOING INTO THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE<br />
PREMIER, THAT WHAT WAS CONVEYED TO ME WAS THAT WHEN THE SHELL WENT<br />
INTO THE CHANCERY, NO-ONE WAS INJURED. SO I HAVEN'T BEEN INFORMED OF<br />
ANY CASUALTY AND, AS I SAY, INDICATIONS ARE TO ME THAT CONSIDERATION<br />
IS BEING GIVEN TO THE APPROPRIATE STEPS THAT NEED TO DE TAKEN TO<br />
ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR PERSONNEL.<br />
JOURNALIST: JUST GOIN'. BACK TO THIS DISARMAMENT QUESTION. WAS THERE<br />
ANY DISCUSSION OF PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU'S INITATIVE.<br />
P. M. YES IS DID RECEIVE REFERENCE. THE PREMIER REFERRED TO THE<br />
FACT THAT PIERRE HAD COME HERE IN NOVEMBER OF THE LATTER PART OF THE<br />
CHOGM MEETING. THE PREMIER INDICATED WITH REFERENCE TO THAT<br />
INITIATIVE THE BASIC POSITION OF CHINA WHICH IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE<br />
AS A FIRST STEP ACTION BY THE TWO SUPERPOWERS TO REDUCE TO STOP ANY<br />
FURTHER TESTING OR INCREASED SOPHISTICATION OF ON ADDITION TO THE<br />
STOCKPILE OF THE SUPERPOIERS AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MOVE<br />
IMMEDIATELY BY THE SUPERPOWERS TO A 50 PERCENT REDUCTION OF THEIR<br />
ARSENALS. AND THEN IN THAT CONTEXT A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE POWERS<br />
CONCERNED. AND CLEARLY IHAT APPROACH OF THE CHINESE IS NOT CONSISTENT<br />
WITH THE TRUDEAU APPROACH WHICH CALLS FOR THE IMMEDIATE<br />
CONFERENCE OF THE FIVE NUCLEAR POWERS.<br />
JOURNALIST: AND TOMORROW, WHAT WILL YOU BE COVERING TRADE?<br />
P. M. WE'LL BE REVIEWING THE ECONOMIC, TRADING AND CULTURAL AHD<br />
OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS, TO SEE JUST WIHAT HAS<br />
BEEN ACHIEVED SINCE OUR MEETING IN APRIL. AND THERE HAS BEEN VERY<br />
CONSIDERABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN SPECIFIC PROPOSALS<br />
FOR STRENGTHENING RELATIONS. AND I'LL MEET WITH YOU AFTER THE<br />
SESSION TOMORROW AND TELL YOU. </p>
