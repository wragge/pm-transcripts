VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
KUALA LUMPUR<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
at State Dinner given by Tunku Abdul Rahman 12 JUNE 1968<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Holyoake, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
The first thing that I must do, Prime Minister, is to express to you my<br />
thanks, very sincere thanks, for your having extended to my wife and I the<br />
invitation to visit your country. And to say that, during the course of that visit,<br />
you have extended to me many kindnesses which I shall remember as long as<br />
I have breath, You did this morning an honour to my country, through me, by allowing<br />
me to enter your House of Parliament, and by the things you said about my<br />
country, remarks which were seconded by the Leader of the Opposition in that<br />
House. The fact that I was the first Australian Prime Minister to enter your<br />
House of Parliarent, and be so treated is perhaps an indication of how much<br />
closer together wV-e have been getting, and perhaps an indication of how much<br />
closer yet we may get in the future.<br />
The ties betw., een Malaysia and Australia, and particularly that part of<br />
Malaysia which I shall call Malaya, and Australia, go backIC a long while, but<br />
they were in the beginning quite tenuous. The people of my country knew little<br />
of the people of yours and I expect that the people of your country knew little of<br />
mine. But a little more than a quarter of a century ago, those ties began to mean<br />
something rather more real when together, you and we, and New Zealand, Great<br />
Britain and other nations attempted to stem the tide of conquest then sweeping<br />
down the Malayan Peninsular. That, I think, gave to thousands of Australians a<br />
clearer knowledge of this country and of those who live in it. And, since that<br />
time, the inter-flow of the thousands of visitors of -which you spoke, the great<br />
enrichment of our own country by the students who have come in such large numbers<br />
from Malaya, the closer economic co-operation between Malaya and ourselves,<br />
the requirements to use force in order to resist at first an emergency and then a<br />
confrontation, have all strengthened those ties of which you spok e.<br />
Prime Minister, they are not now just ties between Prime Ministers;<br />
now, are they ties between governments or the policies of governments. I<br />
believe that they are now ties between the peoples of my country and of yours<br />
and, I think, that they will grow still more in strength as the years go by. I<br />
don't know, Sir, what the future holds, for none of us have a crystal ball. Vie<br />
have for some time been engaged in joint attempts to safeguard the stability, the<br />
security and the progress of this area but now a change has come and some of<br />
those who are engaged in these attempts may or may not be engaged in them in<br />
the future, or at least not in the same way. And this, of course, has been the<br />
theme of the initial Five Power talks just concluded.<br />
3ut I would hope, Sir, one m~ uld not put one's trust for security in such<br />
things as the w, alls to which you referred which the Romans built ; when they<br />
quitted Britain because, if I remember subsequent events correctly, they were<br />
of no use whatever in preventing the Scots from completely subjugating Britain<br />
and indeed I think New Zealand. But one doesn't of course put one's trust in<br />
such things: rather does one put it in that common pur pose which you have<br />
expressed a common purpose to seek by such means as each of us are able<br />
to spare, the security of an area which is necessary if the peoples of that area<br />
are to progress and get a better standard of living. Rather does one put one' s </p>
<p>trust in a common outlook recognising that security, and progress, are best<br />
secured by those kind of democratic processes, which you put into practice<br />
here and we put into practice in Australia. These are the ties that bind, these<br />
are the objectives in common.<br />
And until that time comes when the motto of the United Nations is<br />
translated into that motto being " They shall beat their swords into ploughshares"-<br />
until that time comes, and it has not come yet, then there will need to be<br />
co-operation for security, and, under that shield, co-operation for progress.<br />
And because I think, as I said, that the people of my country are interested in<br />
the people of yours, and of neighbouring countries, I have high hopes that both<br />
our nations will be able to progress, behind the shield of security, to a future<br />
of even greater security, because the future rests on the will of the peoples and<br />
the standards of living which we will be able to achieve for them.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, would you join me in a toast to the Prime<br />
Minister of Mal ay sia. </p>
