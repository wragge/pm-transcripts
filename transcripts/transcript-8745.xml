TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTR, TME MON P J KEATINOG, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ST VINCENT DE PAUL, BANKSTOWN<br />
27 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J; jobs not second hand olothes and structural<br />
unemployment to the turn of the century?<br />
PM: They want jobs that are going to last, not slick<br />
solutions. Agencies like St Vincent De Paul look after<br />
that segment of society which in one way or another slip<br />
through the social security net. but could you imagine<br />
these agencies with people tipped out of the<br />
unemployment benefit as the Liberals want to do after<br />
nine months. The tens or thousonds of Australians who<br />
would nu lunger be supported by the social security<br />
system would have to come to these places for basic<br />
susteiarlue. It's more than St Vincent De Povl or the<br />
Smith family or the Salvation Army can wear, they do a<br />
marvellous community Job but they can't take the place<br />
of the social security system, which iS what John Hewson<br />
wonte them to do.<br />
J: Mr Keating do you accept some responsibility for St<br />
Vincent De Paul's claim that this will be the worst<br />
Christmas since the Depoession7<br />
PM; I hope it isn't, but the thing is the Labor Government<br />
has got a social security safety net out there, I think<br />
now second to none in the world, and part of thot i<br />
accessand equity in health through Medicare, poor<br />
families can bulk bill their doctor at no oos08t, John<br />
Hewson wants to knock it right out of the way. People<br />
on unemployment benefits, knock it right out of the way.<br />
We have got to keep the primary national values of<br />
Australia, community values, where we are looking after<br />
thooe not well off and those who are poor and those who<br />
are sick because I think as a society if we are at the<br />
point where we are nutL looking after these people what<br />
sort of society would we be. 2 iq v. 1 ; uo o U 6 r u I,. </p>
<p>C: Peter Cook says he doesn't support the national strike<br />
that is planned, what is your view on ft?<br />
PM: The Liberal Party of AuStralia are bent upon turning ten<br />
years of induStrial peace into Industrial warfare. My<br />
very, very strong Contention is that Australia can only<br />
progress together. We can only get along, business and<br />
labour that's 1 a b 0 u r in a compact of<br />
Cooperation. But internecine battling reminiscent of<br />
the ' 60s and ' 706 courtesy of Kennett and Hewoon will<br />
always lead Australia into a low growth path and<br />
industrial disputation, It is their fight it is time<br />
they put It to bed.<br />
J: Do you thik the High Court has over-stepped the mark?<br />
PM; No. The High Court has got very clear imperatives under<br />
the Constitution and the High Court is entitled to sit<br />
in jyugement on all the matters brought before it and<br />
make Judgements without Prime Ministers giving doorstop<br />
commtnts about their work.<br />
J: Will we have a referendum though, on -du8 oitizenship?<br />
PM: I don't know, that is an issue but it has got to be<br />
ranked with the other big issues of Australia.<br />
Js Do you have a Comment on the September quarter trade<br />
figures today?<br />
PM; Well they show again this sort of enormous driver that<br />
exports have become. The driving force of exports, if<br />
you look through the statisticians release as I did you<br />
will see the rural commodity is flat, non-rural<br />
commodity Is bursting away earning for Australia In<br />
exports. The question that the community has to ask Is<br />
where would we be now it we were simply relying, as the<br />
Liberals wanted us to rely, on rural commodities without<br />
that burgeoning export sector now in manufactures and<br />
servicea, which is out there paying Australia'&amp; way in<br />
the world.<br />
J: Will the Government have to reviuo its growth figures<br />
now?<br />
PM: That's not to do with the balance of payments.<br />
J: Do you think the Commission wants greater microeconomic<br />
reform? Do you think we have had enough tPicroeconomic<br />
reform?<br />
PM: The Induvtry Conmassion is a ginger group. They are a<br />
paid for, Government paid, ginger group. And what we<br />
expect ginger groups to do is ginger things up, and<br />
that's what they do. </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Nov. 92 16: 08 No. 006 P. 03<br />
3.<br />
J; Do you believe people should go on strike on Monday, yes<br />
or no?<br />
PM; Don't give me simple questions. The Liberal Party wants<br />
a national conflagration on industrial relations, that's<br />
what they are trying to give us and they are the only<br />
people who can take it off,<br />
J: do you agree with that7<br />
PM: it is not a matter of my opinion on this, the<br />
primary matter here Is the Liberal Perty of Australia.<br />
Zt wants to turn ten years of industrial peace into<br />
industrial warfare and it is for Mr Kennett and Dr<br />
Hewson to reconsider their position,<br />
J: Have you got a Christmas message for the unemployed?<br />
PM: My message is that the only way Australia will deal with<br />
unemployment is with a . growth strategy like the<br />
Government ran right through the ' 80s. We're the only<br />
Party in Australia committed to growing the Australian<br />
economy and growing employment. And the quicker we can<br />
get back to that, the quioker we will add to the 1.8<br />
million jobs we created in the 19809.<br />
ENDS </p>
