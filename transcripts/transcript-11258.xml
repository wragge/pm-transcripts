    <content><![CDATA[<p>  With one year to go until the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, I urge all Australians<br />
   to support our world class Paralympic team next year.</p>
<p>  A total of 4000 athletes from 125 countries will compete in 18 sports in<br />
   the first Paralympic Games in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>  I encourage all Australians to purchase Paralympic tickets for what will<br />
   be the second largest sporting event in the world in 2000.</p>
<p>  This will be the only opportunity in our lifetime to cheer our world champion<br />
   athletes in Paralympic competition on home soil. Buying Paralympic tickets<br />
   now will ensure that Australians don't miss out.</p>
<p>  The Coalition Government is providing significant support to the Paralympic<br />
   Games, including the extension of the Paralympic torch relay to all State<br />
   and Territory capital cities, as well as financial assistance to help school<br />
   children from around the nation to experience the excitement and the achievement<br />
   of the Paralympics.</p>
<p>  These initiatives demonstrate my Government's commitment to making the Sydney<br />
   2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games events for all Australians, right across<br />
   our country.</p>
<p>  I encourage as many Australian families as possible to be a part of the<br />
   Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. By purchasing Paralympic tickets, all Australians<br />
   can experience first hand the successes of our world-class athletes.</p>
