    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recent events in the Middle East have reminded Australians that we live in an uncertain world.</p>
<p>The Government has been working to keep our country as safe as possible – because your security is our first priority.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on advice from experts in our security and intelligence agencies, the National Terrorism Public Alert was raised from medium to high.</p>
<p>ASIO independently determines this threat level.</p>
<p>I stress that the increased alert does not mean that a terror attack is imminent.</p>
<p>The Government’s advice is not based on knowledge of a specific plot but rather on a body of evidence that points to the increased likelihood of a terrorist attack in Australia.</p>
<p>Raising the alert level to High is designed to raise awareness in the community.</p>
<p>People who notice things that are suspicious should ring the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400.</p>
<p>But people should go about their lives normally – reassured that strong arrangements are in place to detect, to prevent and to respond to terrorism.</p>
<p>Long before the events of recent days, our security agencies have been sifting intelligence and working quietly and purposefully behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The Government has committed an extra $630 million to boost our counter terrorism capacity to strengthen our security and intelligence organisations.</p>
<p>The Government is also strengthening our ability to monitor, to arrest, and to prosecute people who have been involved with terrorist groups overseas.</p>
<p>People who get involved with a terrorist organisation will be jailed.</p>
<p>And we will make it harder for would-be terrorists to depart from Australia.</p>
<p>The Government is working with the States and the Territories; consulting with the Opposition; and taking considered action so that you can continue to lead your lives confident that everything, everything possible is being done to protect you.</p>
