PRESS CONFERENCE AT PARLIAM. ENTARY AZNNEXE, NEW DELHI<br />
28 January 1979<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER:<br />
I would like to make one or two preliminary remarks, but<br />
because I had. some words to say at the arrival ceremony<br />
and a speech at the Prime Minister's dinner has also been<br />
issued together of course with the speech to the Joint<br />
Sitting of Parliament, because of that I don't think there<br />
is a need for me to speak at any length before throwing<br />
the conference open to questions.<br />
I do want to make one or two points. I would like to take<br />
this occasion, publicly, to thank Prime Minister Desai and<br />
the Government of India for the very warm hospitality that<br />
has been given to me and my whole family. It is the first<br />
time my children have been out of Australia, and they have<br />
appreciated the warmth of the hospitality very much indeed.<br />
When the Prime Minister ( Mr Desai) and myself met at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London the best<br />
of two years ago 18 months ago we then determined that<br />
we should both jointly work to bringIndia and Australia<br />
closer together and seek out areas of co-operation. And<br />
I think the discussions that we had when the Prime Minister<br />
came to Australia for the regional meeting built'-on that.<br />
I hope that my visit here has further built on the framework<br />
that had already been laid.<br />
In the bilateral discussions we had concerning India-Australia<br />
issues, we have agreed on a number of matters. We havc agreed<br />
on some practical exchanges in science and technology under<br />
the science,. and technology agreement between India and Australia,<br />
and senior scientists from Australia will be visiting india.<br />
And likewise from India they will be visiting Australia to*<br />
see which areas of agricultural research would be most<br />
profitable for joint endeavours, for co-operative efforts*,<br />
between-our scientists. In addition to that, in relation<br />
to energy, the same will occur. Australian scientists and<br />
technologists will visit India. An Indian team will visit<br />
Australia. After that it is intended that the-re should be<br />
joint programs of co-operation in' these areas.<br />
The Commonwealth Regional Meeting in Sydney last year<br />
established an energy group which India convenes. The<br />
work that w. l1 be undertaken in energy will not only be<br />
under the auspices of the science and technology agreement<br />
between India and Australia, it will also be related to that<br />
energy group of the Commonwealth Rejional Meeting.<br />
We have also agreed in the bilateral matters to establish,<br />
in a sense, an early warning system a consultative group<br />
on trade between India and Australia. Wle have such a group<br />
in relation to the ASEAN countries, and I think it is<br />
starting to work well. The purpose of tk-his will be to have </p>
<p>-2<br />
a permanent means of communication at a high level so that<br />
if there are any matters which concern India, they can be<br />
raised. on the other hand, if there were matters that<br />
concerned us, we can also raise them. I think having a<br />
consultative committee on trade between India and Australia<br />
will be useful. It will help to point out when there are<br />
sensitivities on one side or the other. And I believe also<br />
it will help to encourage trade between our two countries.<br />
It has also been agreed that we would seek to open the<br />
doors for an Indian mission on coal to investigate the<br />
possibility of joint ventures in coking coal to the mutual<br />
benefit of both countries. I pointed out that on the<br />
Australian side, the Government itself doesn't actively<br />
operate in that area. It would be a question of working<br />
with some of the major organisations in Australia involved<br />
in coal mining and export. But as a Government, we would<br />
certainly very much welcome joint ventures with India.<br />
Over the remainder of the time I will be in India, I will<br />
be looking forward very much to seeing something of InHdian<br />
life in different parts of the country, in particular<br />
rural life and development in country areas together with<br />
seeing some of the great industrial achievements of India.<br />
During the discussions I had with the Prime Minister,<br />
international matters were, of course, canvassed very<br />
deeply. There are areas of concern for all of us at the<br />
present time. But I think I have said enough in opening<br />
this conference, Mr Chairman, and I am going to make it<br />
open to questions.<br />
QUESTION: Have you set'a target for the Committee of sc ientists to<br />
arrive at some specific recommendations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. There is no specific time limit. But I would hope<br />
that the visits can take place quite quickly and that<br />
recommendations can be made to governments. There is no<br />
intention on our side, and I am sure there is no. intention<br />
on India's side, that there will be. any,,, nnecessary delay.<br />
We intend to proceed, and to proceed in a forthright fashion.<br />
QUESTION: Your Foreign Minister has been in Singlapbre explaining<br />
Australia's new aviation policy under which cheap airfares<br />
are to be introduced from Australia ~ to London from February 1.<br />
Can you tell us about the reasons behind this new policy,<br />
which seems to be causing some&amp; distress in other countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think there is a great deal of misunderstanding in relation<br />
to the policy and I welcome the opportunity to explain it. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The Australian Government had been under enormous pressure<br />
to introduce cheap airfares, not only to London but also to<br />
Asia to India to the United States, to Japan. You all<br />
will have heard of Sir Freddie Laker, and people were saying<br />
that Laker must be allowed into Australia. Now we believe<br />
that if Laker did come in with his kind of operation, it<br />
would jeopardise the services to Australia of the regular<br />
airlines, not just Australian airlines but many airlines,<br />
because loading could be very significantly affected.<br />
Under these circumstances we thought the regular services<br />
might be put in jeopardy, but at the same time we wanted<br />
to respond to the very strong wish to achieve lower airfares.<br />
We also believed that lower airfares could only be achieved<br />
on the regular airlines if the general loading factor can<br />
be kept at a high level.<br />
Now, it is the intention of Australia and of Qantas to<br />
negotiate not just with Britain, and not just with the<br />
United States, but with India and all the countries with<br />
whom we are conducting air services.<br />
I think there has been misunderstanding because it is felt<br />
that when we announced the Aiustralia-London fares, we<br />
hadn't at that time negotiated other fares along the route,<br />
and I suppose when you are negotiating with many countries,<br />
many different airlines, it is difficult to bring it all to<br />
a conclusion at once, and that wasn't possible.<br />
In relation to India, for example, we will be negotiating<br />
quite shortly on an airline to airline basis, and if it r<br />
is necessary to have discussions between our. Departments of<br />
Aviation, that can be arranged. There was some discussion<br />
of this issue over the last couple of days. As I understand<br />
it, India wants to make sure it maintains the relative<br />
attractiveness in relation to the new fares to Britain that<br />
the current fares had to the old fares to Britain. In other<br />
words, the fares to Britain have come down, therefore to<br />
maintain the relative attractiveness of India as a place for<br />
Australians to visit, the fares to India certainly need to<br />
be reduced. Now that would be our objective, and we believe<br />
overall that tourists from Australia and we hope to Australiaare<br />
going to be increased.<br />
It was my understanding earlier that the-ai~ line to airline<br />
negotiations with Air Garuda, Air Malaysia and Air Thai had<br />
been reasonably satisfactory. I think there were some<br />
problems-with Air Singapore, partly-perhaps because they<br />
weren't a member of IATA and conducted their operations on<br />
different. rules<br />
QUESTION: Did your talks include civil aviation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It was covered in the talks with officials and other ministers<br />
present, yes. And I believe there is an understanding of k </p>
<p>4<br />
the position. Certainly it is not the Australian Government's<br />
intention or will to take any action that would jeopardise<br />
Air India or jeopardise an increasing number of Australian<br />
tourists coming to India.<br />
QUESTION: ( First part inaudible)... do you think you will be able to<br />
maintain the present per capita income in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The per capita income of Australians will depend very much<br />
on how hard Australians work now and in the future. If<br />
Australians sit back and donit work, the per capita income<br />
will fall. If they get out and work with initiative and<br />
energy, per capita income of Australia can be maintained<br />
or improved. But I think maybe part of the question relates<br />
to something which I believe is very important, and that is<br />
that we need to achieve a greater growth of trade, we need<br />
to achieve a greater growth of world markets, so that the<br />
living standards, especially in a number of developing countries,<br />
can be improved.<br />
One of the things that distrubs me very greatly is the<br />
extent to which a number of industrial countries make it<br />
difficult at times for goods from developing countries to<br />
enter into the old industrial: markets.<br />
During periods of high inflation, high unemployment and low<br />
growth, the problems and difficulties can be, I think,<br />
understood. But it is very important that the world get<br />
gack on a growth path, because if that doesn't happen<br />
I believe that the prospects of increased trade, better<br />
economic relations between north countries and south countries<br />
will be put very much in jeopardy. Australia quite specifically<br />
seeks to conduct policies that do encourage the products of<br />
developing countries into the Australian market. On a per<br />
capita basis, I think, we import more than any other industrial<br />
country. And we certainly import more than much more in<br />
the sensitive employment areas of textiles, apparel and<br />
footwear than any other industrial country.<br />
In relation to ASEAN, for example, dnd'fjust happen to have<br />
those figures in my mind, if North America and Europe<br />
imported as much textiles, apparel and footwear from them<br />
as Australia did per capita, those . countries would be<br />
exporting-an extra thousand million dollars worth a year.<br />
That would obvious. Ly.. an. enormous increase in trade.<br />
But I very firmly believe that we are all interdependent<br />
in these particular issues, and that we need to look ato<br />
the broader international context to advance the interests<br />
of all countries.<br />
QUESTION: ( Inaudible) </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have a high rate of investment in Australia because we<br />
are a capital importing country, and I think one of the<br />
reasons for that is that there are a number of very expensive<br />
resource development projects underway in Australia. The<br />
Northwest Shelf development, which will be mainly a natural<br />
gas project, will take $ 3,000 million Australian to develop,<br />
and that is probably beyond the capacity of Australia to<br />
provide alone. Therefore the joint ventures need to get<br />
capital and support from overseas.<br />
We will use some of the natural gas in Australia for industry<br />
and some will be exported. And it is because of developments<br />
of that kind I think that Australia needs to be a capital<br />
importing country and I think that might account for the<br />
statistics that you mentioned.<br />
QUESTION: Inaudible.., concerning joint ventures for mining and exploration<br />
of coking coal?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
This was a subject raised during the discussions, and there<br />
has been a significant sale of 600,000 tonnes from Australia<br />
to India. As I understand it, India would like to get continuity<br />
of supply of access for coking coal on a regular basis. And<br />
to make sure of that, as I understand it, India wanted to get<br />
in on the base development in relation to coking coal. Now<br />
that can be done in partnership with Australian enterprises,<br />
in partnership with Australia's coal exporters, and it could<br />
be in relation to exploration; it could be in relation to<br />
development. It is very much at the early stage, and what I have undertaken<br />
to do is to make sure that an Indian mission would be<br />
put in touch with the right people in-Australia and would be<br />
given every encouragement. And from a Government point of<br />
view we would certainly welcome that kind of joint venture,<br />
because one of the things we belidveF-1~ important in this<br />
trade is reliability of access to markets for countries that<br />
are seeking to sell. And if there is a joint venture between<br />
Australian concerns and India in something such as coking<br />
coal, or for that in other areas of % resource development,<br />
then that gives India guaranteed access, guaranteed supply,<br />
and it gives us a reliable market., Xt is therefore in the<br />
interests of both nations. But it is at the momcent in a<br />
very preliminary stage. I was responding to a request put<br />
to me on the Indian side of -the bilateral discussions, and I<br />
was very happy to do so. </p>
<p>-6<br />
QUESTION: TOTALLY INAUDIBLE.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The problem with immigration at the moment is the unemployment<br />
that there is in Australia and wa have as you know a policy<br />
that is non-discriminatory, but it is necessary to have a<br />
job to go to, and there are lists of skills which are in<br />
short supply in Australia.*<br />
That list is being changed and updated as the po sition varies,<br />
but I do know that a large number of doctors from India have<br />
gone -to Australia in recent times, and they are contributing<br />
very greatly to the communities in which they are working<br />
in Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Australia has cut aid to Vietnam as a result of the Vietnamese<br />
backed invasion of Kampuchea. How extensive was this question<br />
discussed with the leaders of India and were there differences<br />
between the Australian and the Indian positions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No; the question of whether aid should or shouldn't continue<br />
wasn't discussed at all. I think we understand each other's<br />
position in relation to it. A statement will be made on<br />
behalf of the Australian Government, and I note that a number<br />
of other countries have either stopped aid or said that no<br />
new aid commitments would be begun under the current<br />
cirucmstances. The British Government is in that position,<br />
and I think a number of European Governments and some governments<br />
in Southeast Asia have certainly welcomed the Australian<br />
position in relation to it. We did that for two simple reasons:<br />
we believed it was wrong to give aid to a country that had<br />
embarked on an invasion and also that was pursuing a particular<br />
policy in relation into its own people concerning refugees.<br />
That's causing a great problem in Thailand and Malaysia, and<br />
to an extent it's causing a problem in lutralia. also, even<br />
though we have taken in relation to our size and population<br />
a large number of refugees from Vietnam and any other nation.<br />
But those ~ were the reasons for it. But a more important element,<br />
which I discussed at length and which P can only advert to<br />
here very briefly, is the concern we must all feel about the<br />
possibilities of escalation in relation to Vietnam and<br />
Kampuchea as a result of the actions that have taken place.<br />
We all know the possibilities of escalation, and I think it<br />
would be very disturbing in Sougheast Asia and the Asian<br />
region generally if that were to occur. It was really in<br />
relation to that aspect of the situation that the discussions<br />
I had were very full and very extensive. </p>
<p>-7<br />
QUESTION:<br />
Mr Prime Minister, as a result of your visit to India, do<br />
you see greater co-operation between India and Australia<br />
on the Indian Ocean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I believe there can be greater co-operation between India<br />
and Australia on a whole range of issues, including the<br />
Indian Ocean. I have stressed very strongly the need for<br />
countries that want to pursue a moderate path, in their<br />
domestic and also their international affairs, to speak<br />
out with the voice of moderation and to speak strongly.<br />
As I understand it, that has been much of India's role as a<br />
leader of the non-aligned movement over a long period. But<br />
the voice of moderation is going to be enormously strengthened<br />
if countries with different positions some aligned, as<br />
Australia is, some non-aligned, as India is all speak for<br />
moderation with great strength and vigour moderation as<br />
opposed to confrontation. And the substance of what I had<br />
to say at the joint sitting was on that theme as you would know.<br />
I believe really that there are few areas of significant<br />
difference between India and Australia. Sometimes there is<br />
a difference of needs, but the objective we have is very<br />
often the same. And in the Indian Ocean our objective is<br />
the same. Our objective is to make sure that the Indian<br />
Ocean does not become an area of great power rivalry. India<br />
wants to achieve that by a Zone of Peace, and I have said<br />
that if that could be achieved it would be most likely to<br />
bring about the desired result. But you have got to get other<br />
people to agree to that, other major powers. We have adopted<br />
a concept of balance balance at the lowest level possible<br />
but our objective is the samue, to prevent the Indian Ocean<br />
from becoming a sphi'ere of great power rivalry and, having the<br />
same objective, I am sure India and Australia can work<br />
together.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, we have had a famous Australian -Germaine Greer, the<br />
Women's Lib leader with us recently.-Do women have equal<br />
opportunity in employment and other spheres as mnin. Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I believe so, yes. -I do think women do have equal<br />
opportunity, but there are some things which historically<br />
I think have made it more difficult fort wc~ men in certain<br />
careers than for men. For example, the political party<br />
which I lead in Victoria has guaranteed-equality of<br />
positions between men and women, and has had since the<br />
foundation of the Party. In the branches of the Party, if<br />
you had a male Vice-President, you had to have a female<br />
Vice--President, and the office bearers were split equally<br />
between men and women. In the higher councils of the Party<br />
in my State, you had equa. numbers of men and equal num~ bers<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
of women. There was one President of the Party, and you<br />
couldn't have two Presidents, but for every other position.<br />
There was a male Vice-President and there was a female<br />
Vice-President. So the concept of equality of opportunity<br />
for women is something that is very deeply rooted in my own<br />
political Party. We have taken a number of Parliamentary<br />
actions to try and make sure that there is complete equality<br />
for all people in Australia and that peoples' rights are<br />
maintained. There are anti-discrimination committees, in the<br />
Department of Employment, operated by the Department of<br />
Employment. In spite of this general philosophy, in some<br />
careers, in some professions I think perhaps for traditional<br />
and historic reasons, there aren't as many women active in the<br />
professions as there are men. I would be very happy to see that<br />
position changed over time.<br />
QUESTION: Australia and India are exporters of iron ore, and I believe<br />
there were discussions between you and Mr Desai on some of the<br />
market trends in iron ore so that your export earnings are<br />
protected. Could you give us some details about these<br />
discussions. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The marketing position for iron ore, as you will all know, has<br />
been very difficult over the last two or three years, and I<br />
think India, Australia and Brazil are probably three of the<br />
major exporters. Up to the present time of negotiations<br />
Brazil, as I am advised, has generally gone into the market<br />
being prepared to undercut the price, and that is one of the<br />
things which has led to a continual pressure on prices. This<br />
time there has been a significant change Brazil has gone<br />
into the Japanese market, and I think the European market,<br />
suggesting a considerably higher price. Now, that is a changed<br />
attitude for Brazil, and I think that gives other exporters such<br />
as Australia and India a better opportunity to maintain or to<br />
improve prices, and 1 agree with the Indian view that prices<br />
need some upward movement. They have been at depressed levels<br />
for quite some time, and if there, wer ' e new projects to be<br />
developed, I don't think they could be at current price levels.<br />
Against that general supply situation, we know. that prices set<br />
by Japan tend to take a leading placa. in-, setting prices for<br />
Iron Ore, and we also know that Japan really organises herself<br />
very effectively and very efficiently, so that the sellers<br />
are really selling to one buyer. If-there are several<br />
Australian companies and Brazilian companies and India, they<br />
are operating as independent units, 4but Japan has operated as<br />
a unified buyer. It was against that backqround that we<br />
were having some discussions, and I'believe that there can<br />
be some advantage both for India and Australia if there can<br />
be some interchanges so that we have a general understanding<br />
and knowledge of what our objectives and attitudes are.<br />
There is no suggestion of firm and fixed arrangements, but<br />
there is a suggestion and I believe it is a good one, that<br />
consultations in this area would be beneficial both the India<br />
and to Australia. And those consul. tations will take place. 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
QUESTION: What difficulty do you foresee in your ( inaudible) commodity<br />
( remainder inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think that's probably a philosophical difference, or a<br />
philosophical difficulty. I don't believe it is healthy<br />
if groups of suppliers ban themselves into a firm hard<br />
group and say we are only going to supply under these<br />
circumstances, just as I don't believe it is healthy if<br />
a group of buyers in a country, or between countries,<br />
ban themselves together and say this is what we are<br />
going to do, and try and use a degree of monopoly power.<br />
I don't think monopoly power is a healthy power to have,<br />
whoever exercises it. And there was never any suggestion<br />
that that should take place. the suggestion was one for<br />
consultation, and I think that can be beneficial, and I have<br />
undertaken to make sure that on our side it occurs.<br />
QUESTION: As I understand, did you suggest India and Australia should<br />
consult on the prices that they will be seeking from Japan<br />
on Iron Ore?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I didn't suggest. The suggestion came from the Indian side,<br />
and I acceded to it. No, there will just be general<br />
consultations about the marketing situation. The proposition<br />
is not as specific as the question you put.<br />
QUESTION: You mentioned earlier that unemployment was at historically<br />
high levels. Do you see this level going down, or do<br />
Australians have to accept the fact that it will remrain at<br />
this level or even go higher for ano. ther 12 months or so.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A number of factors will determine that. One of them is the<br />
level of wage increases. I'm quite certain that the last<br />
wage increase we had in Australia before Christmas would not<br />
have helped that. Another factor is~ the growth in world<br />
trade because that effects all countries. As you know, we<br />
have 28 percent of our GDP represented by trade, and therefore<br />
Australia is sensitive and any improvement in world trade<br />
will obviously help all countries, but it will obviously help<br />
Australia because trade represents a large part of our Gross<br />
Domestic Product. Because of institutional arrangements irn<br />
Australia, the wages decisions are not decisions for<br />
government. Although we can determine them, we can't influence<br />
them, because the level of inflation is too high in North<br />
America, too hiqh in many countries of Europe. I am delighted<br />
1, </p>
<p>10<br />
to see recent U. S. actions which are obviously direcred at<br />
combating that. But for a while inflation may go up a~ nd recent<br />
events in Great Britain are not encouraging that. And while<br />
inflation is too high, market growth will be too low, and<br />
growth of world trade will be too low. I make those points<br />
just to say that in that environment, countries have to rest<br />
on their own energies, their own initiatives. Therefore the<br />
improvement we can achieve we will have to achieve from our<br />
own resources, not looking for assistance outside. We therefore<br />
have to keep our inflation level below that of our major<br />
trading partners, so that our industries become more competitive.<br />
I think over the last 18 months they have.<br />
exports are starting to increase and our own people are<br />
starting to get a better share of our domestic markets.<br />
Over the past two months there has been a great deal of<br />
enthusiasm in Australian manufacturing industry for the<br />
prospects for 1979. Whether that will translate itself<br />
into an increase in employment I can't yet predict. I do<br />
know that manufacturers are starting to look to a much better<br />
future. Overtime has started to increase. If that carries<br />
forward there ought to be some increase on the unemployment<br />
question. I think we are getting to the stage where<br />
policies of the last three years are starting to demonstrate<br />
their effects quite widely within Australia. On top of that,<br />
something which hasn't occurred in Australia for maybe up to<br />
years, we have had good seasons, we haven't had drought over<br />
the past year, and our prices for our products are all good<br />
at the one time. that, coming with a good season, hasn't<br />
happened for a long while. For quite some time the Australian<br />
rural community has been, in a sense, dragging down the rest<br />
of the economy because their incomes have been so low and many<br />
of them were getting into debt and very great difficulty.<br />
But this year the rural sector will be contributing to the<br />
economy instead of detracting from it. That will. have an impact<br />
on country towns and also will be having an impact on orders<br />
and manufacturing industry who supply products needed in<br />
the rural industries. I'm sorry this is such a domestic<br />
answer I'm sorry for those who are not interested in these<br />
matters, but I'm told wire production and steel fence post<br />
production has already, or increased demand has already, hit<br />
BHP and production for these mat ters is already starting to<br />
lift. If that happens in one are'a,** it will happen across<br />
the braod spectrum of the farms of rural Australia. What<br />
I am saying is that coupled wi th,. th. Q, 4Jet ter position of<br />
manufacturing industry, this is a very healthy sign within<br />
the Australian economy. How it will translate itself into the<br />
employment situation is something that I think we have to wait<br />
and see for a little while. There is some cause for a degree<br />
of optimisin whereas before there wsi't.<br />
QUESTION: How active are the Ananda Marg in your country now? / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is difficult to tell. They have been active. They have been<br />
active against representatives of India in Australia. We know<br />
something of the organisation perhaps not as much as we would<br />
like to know. Over the last month or two they have been perhaps<br />
a little quieter than they were earlier, and I hope it continues<br />
that way.<br />
QUESTION: The Government here in Inida is committed to giving autonomy<br />
in broadcasting and television. You have been experimenting with<br />
this thing for quite some time now. What has been your experience?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have an independent Australian broadcasting commission which runs<br />
radio and television. That is a government funded organisation<br />
but it is run by an independent statutory commission. In addition<br />
to that we have commercial broadcasting and television. Because<br />
of the importance of the general public arena, because of the power<br />
of the Media, and especially the power of television, it is subject<br />
to some degree of control by an independent tribunal. I believe<br />
that the mixture of public ownership and private ownership of the<br />
broadcasting and television area works well in Australia. It is<br />
an Australian solution to a problem. I wouldn't try and export it.<br />
I think countries should work out their own particular ways of<br />
solving these things.<br />
QUESTION: In your speech yesterday you mentioned the forces of extremism.<br />
Cani you identify some of these extremist countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Countries can be extremist on particular issues without being<br />
extremist on further issues. I think you see many forms of<br />
extremism in southern Africa. It is another form of extremism that<br />
places Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea;,.. There are many different<br />
forms of extremism. There have been problems in the Middle East<br />
of a continuing kind. Some progress made, but not-yet enough<br />
progress. Problems of race which I menti~ arned in South Africa still<br />
bedevil that continent. And it is not generally understood that<br />
one of my Australian predecessors, Sir Robert Menzies, as early as<br />
1960 or 1961, on behalf of Australia, condemned apartheid and all<br />
that it stood for. He believed then tht it was doomed to failure<br />
and disaster if it was not changed. And I can remember at the last<br />
CHOGM an expectation and hope that Zimbabwe is to be seated at the<br />
next conference. The next conference'is going to be at Lusak,-a in<br />
a little more than eight months time, and I do not think we are<br />
going to see Zimbabwe seated as a fully-fledged member within that<br />
time span. The forces for change, the forces for an acceptable<br />
movement to majority rule seem to have stalled -to an extent. I<br />
would hope that these issues could be picked up again and moved<br />
forward, because it will be a source of turmoil, tension and<br />
tragedy while it continues. </p>

QUESTION: ( Inaudible)*. Concerning Muslims in Pakistan and Kashmir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know that it is proper for me to comment on that.<br />
Australia is not a Muslim country, although Muslims live in<br />
Australia, and it is pre-eminently a matter I would have thought,<br />
for this sub-continent. I would have thought it might be impertinent<br />
for me to try to intrude an Australian view on the matter.<br />
QUESTION: Getting back to the iron ore question, you said that there are to<br />
be consultations between India and Australia on the general<br />
marketing situation which are likely to include discussions of<br />
guideline proces. It should follow that both India and Australia<br />
( remainer inaudible) Is that the intention of the Indian side<br />
in this regard? A second question, it seems that Australia might<br />
improve economically and is starting to move to an upturn. Is there<br />
any chance that quotas'and tariff barriers might come down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Letinme take the iron ore question first. There will be discussions<br />
about the general market situation, but I think it would be wrong<br />
ti imply from that that there would be any suggestion of joint<br />
guidelines. That would be going beyond the scope of joint<br />
discussions as I understand it. I think it more an exchange of<br />
information. I don't think there is any intention of establishing<br />
joint action, as I understand the position. I think Australia's<br />
position and I'm glad the question was asked on quotas and imports<br />
is sometimes misunderstood. We are 14 million people on the edge<br />
of Southeast Asia, and it is quite natural that many countries look<br />
to Australia as a market. But we clearly can't take all the goods<br />
from ASEAN countries, from Asian countries.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is necessary for ASEAN countries to look beyonO Australia, as<br />
of course they do. * But we have treid to have our markets as<br />
open as possible. There are some things which make it difficult<br />
for us to move at a faster pace. But on the historical record,<br />
the ASEAN countries have increased their exports to Australia<br />
by over 30 percent for the past several years, and that's a<br />
very significant rate of increase.-the-y~ f~ ave increased their<br />
exports to Australia in industries where employment in Australia<br />
has fallen dramatically and significantly. I have said to ASEAN<br />
countries many times that I think it is quite unrealistic to<br />
expect a faster rate of growth into the'-Australian market than you<br />
have had, because quite clearly a country that's exporting needs to<br />
be aware of the sensitivity in the target country. It needs to<br />
be aware of the concern that happens when people are put out of jobs<br />
as a result of imports, and quite clearly that has happened in<br />
the ASEAN context. But despite that, we have sought to maintain<br />
the circumstances in which ASEAN exports to Australia, and I<br />
mention themn because they are a group and very close to Australia / 13 </p>
<p>-V I -13<br />
geographically. They continue to expand their exports to Australia<br />
by over 30 percent a year for the last several years. Looking at<br />
it from another point ov view, if we take items that are employment<br />
sensitive textiles, apparels and footware we import from ASEAN<br />
countries much more than nay other developed country, and I think<br />
I might have mentioned earlier that if they have the same access<br />
on a per capita basis to North America and Europe as they have to<br />
Australia, they would be exporting another $ 1,000 million annually.<br />
But we do in fact import more manufactured goods from developing<br />
countries than any other industrial country. I said earlier that<br />
I think there will be, or I know there is, increasing optimism<br />
about prospects for manufacturing industry. But I don't see<br />
any prospects of a dramatic change or of a situation that will<br />
enable Australia's trade position, import position, be substantially<br />
altered over the short term. These things don't change quickly.<br />
And again it needs to be against the historical background of what<br />
has happened in relation ti imports from developing countries.<br />
There is one thing of course that would help Australia enormously.<br />
We have quantitative restrictions on 40% to 50% of Australia's<br />
exports. Quantitative restrictions imposed by Europe North<br />
America and by Japan, and it is those quantitative restrictLions<br />
that prevent Australia doing more of what Australia can do best<br />
and cheapest. Plainly, if those quantitative restrictions did not<br />
exist or if they were minimised, we would be able to open our<br />
markets more to goods from other countries who can do some things<br />
better or more cheaply than we can. So the trade question is involved.<br />
It is complex, it involves many different aspects, and I think in<br />
the consultative group that has been established between ourselves<br />
and ASEAN for example, the general position is ' pretty well understood.<br />
I-have found in Malaysia, for example, understanding for Australia's<br />
position and point of view as we have tried to have of theirs.<br />
I don't think there can be dramatic changes or sudden changes.<br />
