PRIME MINISTER ON RADIO 4BC ( HAYDN SARGENT SHOW) 12/ 6/ 86<br />
H. S. Mr Hawke seems to have copped flak from both sides<br />
of the fence from the unions and from the employers.<br />
Good morning Mr Prime Minister<br />
PM: Good morning Haydn, how are you?<br />
HS: You've copped flaK from both sides of the fence this<br />
morning after last night's speech. The unions weren't<br />
happy, the employers weren't happy. Were you<br />
expecting that sort of reaction?<br />
PM I think in politics in the broad senseadd that<br />
includes Industrial politics, people have<br />
constituencies and I've got to take account of those.<br />
was a little bit surprised by sections of the business<br />
community who in discussions with me indicated a view<br />
about the productivity/ superannuation case In line with<br />
the government and then they make public statemennts<br />
to the contrary. They have their constituencies to<br />
look after. As far as the ACTU is concerned and I<br />
think this is the important point Haydn, they are in<br />
a vacuum at the moment. They've got a case which they've<br />
argued and there's no decision yet. I believe that if<br />
the Commission comes down, arid obviously they are an<br />
independent body and I can't say what they will do, but<br />
I believe that if they come down with a decision which<br />
grants the 2.3, which itself involved a 2 percent<br />
discountt if they come down with that decislon and an<br />
indication that superannuation will be available spread<br />
over a longer period, it means there is a wages situation,<br />
wages systemthere within which the trade union movement<br />
can make clear decisions. I think it will work out on </p>
<p>that 3ide.<br />
HS I was talking to Brett Davis today from the Chamber<br />
of Commerce, he's a senior economist and you probably<br />
know him, and he said the Chamber of Commerce felt that<br />
wage increases Should be based on productivity. Do<br />
you support that idea?<br />
PM: Productivity Is obviously relevent and has to be taken<br />
into account.-But If you have a situation where you only<br />
took account of productivity and no movement in prices,<br />
you would have a continually declining situation as far<br />
as the capacity of people to purchase goods and services.<br />
So you've got to balance the two. But there is a case<br />
that there has to be a reduction In-real standards in<br />
the foreseeable future. The world has cut our national<br />
income by by .3percent. We can'tVw~ ive that fact away,)<br />
we have to accommodate to t.<br />
HS A lot of people feel that the wage earner or Australia<br />
is being asked to carry the can, but that the<br />
manufacturers and the retailers and the wholesalers are<br />
not prepared to enter into some sort of even voluntary<br />
agveements to peg prices.<br />
PM Yes, and that's a fair feeling. Just let me make two or<br />
three comments about that, Haydn. The fact is that wage<br />
and salary earners constitute the great majority of Lhe<br />
nation's income and expenditure so there has to be<br />
restraint In that area. The point Is that under our<br />
constitutional and institutional position In this<br />
country there are mechanisms Including the Arbitration<br />
Commission, for dealing with wages freeze. Under the<br />
same constitution there are no mechanisms fur-exceriling<br />
the same sort of restraint In regard to the Usille~ S<br />
sector, So we've got to rely, baslcally~ asd<br />
substantially, on the decency if you like and the good<br />
sense of the business community, and that is why in thte<br />
area or the three things that they can do aind should do<br />
we have . There are three areas in which the </p>
<p>busln2: Is commun. I. Ty h . i a rP. 5POn!:: 1 hilitY firstly In<br />
regard to to their own salaries, the executives and<br />
directors and so on, they've * oL to exercise the same<br />
restraint and have a real reduction In their standards<br />
by not allowing their remuneration to go at a raster<br />
rate than wages and salaries and I believe we'll<br />
get that restraint. They-certainly have a moral<br />
responsibility to exercise it.<br />
Secondly, in the area of p rices, they should embrace<br />
the voluntary guidelines of the Prices Surveillance<br />
Authority, they should keep price increases to a<br />
minimum and we're going to do our best to see that they<br />
do. Thirdly, in the positive environment that has been<br />
created with profitability back to the levels of the<br />
late 60s and early 70Os, they have responsibility to<br />
invest in this country and we are providing them with<br />
the best sort of environment to do that. They should<br />
be positive in each of those three areas.<br />
HS I notice this morning that The Australian published a<br />
poll that suggested 64 percent of Australians felt we<br />
are In deep financial trouble. I wonder sometimes though<br />
whether the constant talk about our 6eep financial trouble<br />
and the constant media attention to it, doesti't end up<br />
becoming a very negative factor and people thun start<br />
to think negatively and behave negatively instead of<br />
rallying and fighting the common enemy. We just all<br />
tend to sort of flop around and say we're beaten.<br />
PM: That's a fair point and it's precisely that sort, or<br />
consideration that was my major concern last night. I<br />
wanted to tell the Australian community ordinary men<br />
and women of this country, workers and businessmen that'<br />
we do not have cause for dtspair. T reminded them of wha,<br />
we did together at tho boginning of 1983, that. wam th,<br />
worse economic crisis this country had had for 50 years.<br />
Now by realising that by working together we'd do better,*<br />
we then moved into a position of economic growth far and2<br />
away beyond the average of overseas, we got the highmest<br />
rate of employment growth in this country's history and<br />
we brought inflation down to it was down by 5 percent </p>
<p>there at the end of 1984 before we got hit b y this<br />
depreciation. 5o we have demonstrated to o,, e another<br />
that we can face a crisis. Now we don't want to d4spair.<br />
Ue've got to recognise, howeverthe reality that there.<br />
has been this 3 percent cut in our national economic<br />
capacity and we're getting less for what we sell overseas<br />
than what we did before. So we've got to adjust to<br />
that. But if together we work hardert if business<br />
invests and we diversify our export base, we can lick<br />
this. We're Australians and Australia can set a place<br />
in regard to fundamentals solution is in our<br />
hands and if we recognise that fact we can come out on<br />
top.<br />
H-IS You said Australia had a severe crisis in 1983 is<br />
this crisis as big or bigger?<br />
PM What we've got now the challenge is only daunting if<br />
we can control what the world pays us for<br />
our products let's go to a few of the prices so<br />
people can understand what has happened to these prices,<br />
in the last year take aluminium the prices we get have<br />
fallen 13 percent, 4 percent for coal, 10 percent for<br />
wheat, 5 percent wool, beef and veal, 13 percent for<br />
sugar now these are very very substantial declines in<br />
what we get for what we sell. We can't control those<br />
overseas prices. So what we've got to try and do is<br />
diversify our export base, try and increase in absolute<br />
and terms what we do in the manufacturing and<br />
services areas, so we're not so adversely impacted upon<br />
by these movements in prices for rural and mineral<br />
products. I used the example in one discussion I had<br />
last night of Canada they have produced a situation where<br />
they have increased the proportion or manufactured<br />
services relative to agricultural and mineral products.<br />
They were relatively fortunate in living next door to<br />
the United States and having that great big market there<br />
into which it could sell, but we've got to try and do the<br />
same sort of thing. And, my point of rerferring to<br />
Deek and to Sutherland and to Ben Lexcen arid Bertrand<br />
was to say the sort of thing which made those people gree<br />
tht determination the dediScation the Wpardedness to </p>
<p>use the Lbest aidvice and technology the prepairedrieszi<br />
to forego immediate satisfaction for the longer rewards,<br />
those sort o1f principles can be used in our manufacturing<br />
and services sector? and we can do great thing4.<br />
I'll just -quote to you from a letter I had just a rew<br />
days ago from a company in Victoria ' thanks to the<br />
government's support we are now 1In a position<br />
to build a $ 70 million plant late in 1986 due to<br />
government support, 25U jobs will be created immediately<br />
the plant is completed and will Increase to a total or<br />
500 jobs within four year s. 0 And they talk about<br />
developing a whole new range of products for here and<br />
overseas and thank us for what we've done. Now here's<br />
a company which said I all right, here's help and<br />
assistance the government is providing, let's use ourown<br />
imagination and drive and this Is what we can do'.<br />
I've had other letters like this and It seems to me<br />
that's an indication of the sort of thing we've got<br />
to do.<br />
HS Mr Prime Minister you and I both know that the amount of<br />
money spent on former Prime Ministers Is piddling<br />
compared with the National Budget, You and I also<br />
know that the amount of' money spent on wages to<br />
parliakmentarians is petty compared to the National Budget<br />
But out in the marketplace out in the village where<br />
people are, there is enormous resentment about the<br />
amount of' money spent on former Prime Ministers and there<br />
is enormous resentment about comments like the one made<br />
by Mick Young that politicians should get a better dtal.<br />
And when the Prime Minister is talking to the nation of<br />
wage earners about restraint, I think people look with a<br />
degree or resentment at those two areas and they're<br />
waiting for the rank and file parliamentarian to set<br />
the example.<br />
PM Let me say two things about parliamentarians. I say<br />
without any possibility of' contradiction that if you </p>
<p>look at what's happened to parliamentarians salaries<br />
over recent years. they have relatively to wage and<br />
salary earners done worse. They haven't had the sorts<br />
of adjustments that generally havc occurred. But<br />
having said that let me Say the second thing that<br />
the Remuneration Tribunal which deals witn these things?<br />
will be making report to me I believe before very long<br />
and to the government. I obviously have to receive<br />
that report but I indicate that as far as parliamentarians<br />
are concerned they are going to have to exercise the<br />
same sort ot" restraint that I'm talking about. I think<br />
further down the track there's got to be a looking at<br />
this because the quality the electors will get in the<br />
PArliament is going to be related to the remuneratlon.<br />
If you allow that remuneration to go down too far<br />
relative to other obstensibly comparable positions in<br />
the community, that will ultimately reflect in alesser<br />
quality of people who will make themselves available.<br />
But having said that I believe in these current<br />
circumstances when we are asking for restraint from the<br />
rest of the community, parliamentarians from myself down<br />
are going to have to exercise similar restraints.<br />
HS Prime Minister I guess it's a matter of time isn't it?<br />
We seem to be a rairly fragmented socny at the moment<br />
the unions wanting the employers to carry the bag and<br />
the employers wanting to carry the unions arid the work<br />
force to do the sacrificing. It seems to me we've got<br />
a common enemy and all three the politicians, the<br />
employers and the employees must get together and then<br />
we've got a chance.<br />
PM You're absolutely right. I repeat we did that in 1983<br />
and we got out of the worst economic crisis as I sai for<br />
years and we should as a nation be proud of what we did<br />
there is no reason why we can't do it again I have tota'<br />
confidence that we will. </p>
