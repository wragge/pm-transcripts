FOR MEDIA 3 JUNE 1991<br />
I shall be recommending to the Governor-General the<br />
following new Ministerial appointments:<br />
The Hon John Kerin MP as Treasurer;<br />
The Hon Simon Crean MP as Minister for Primary<br />
Industries and Energy;<br />
The Hon Ross Free MP as Minister for Science and<br />
Technology,, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for<br />
Science and Minister Assisting the Treasurer;<br />
I will also be proposing that responsibility for<br />
housing industry matters be added to the portfolio of<br />
the Hon Brian Howe MP, who would then become Minister<br />
for Health, Housing and Community Services.<br />
In addition, Mr Howe, as Deputy Prime Minister, will now<br />
serve as Ministe~ r Assisting the Prime Minister for<br />
Commonwealth-State Relations as well as Minister Assisting<br />
the Prime Minister for Social Justice.<br />
Mr Roger Price MP will be appointed Parliamentary Secretary<br />
to the Prime Minister.<br />
Senator Bob McMuilan will become Manager of Government<br />
Business in the Senate, taking over from Senator Ray.<br />
The formal appoi ' ntment of the new Ministers by the Governor-<br />
General will take place at 9.00 am tomorrow, 4 June 1991.<br />
Mr Kerin, as one of the Government's most senior Ministers,<br />
will bring to the position of Treasurer immense Ministerial<br />
and Parliamentary experience. His record as Minister for<br />
Primary Industries and Energy has been outstanding. As<br />
Treasurer he will play a central role in both the<br />
Government's policies for sustained economic recovery and<br />
our commitment to continued micro economic reform.<br />
Mr Crean also comes to his new position with very strong<br />
credentials, his leadership in the trade union movement<br />
having now been supplemented by experience as a Minister.<br />
He has performed with dedication and creativity in his<br />
present Ministerial position. </p>
<p>Mr Free moves to his first Ministerial post from the<br />
position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister.<br />
Knowing Mr Free's work over this period I am confident he<br />
will provide excellent service to the Government as Minister<br />
for Science and Technology, a field of high importance to<br />
the Government's aspirations for Australia in the 1990s.<br />
The placement in Mr Howe's portfolio of housing industry<br />
matters will assist the development of a more coherent<br />
approach by the Government to the planning and development<br />
of Australian cities.<br />
Federal-State relations is also a key area of reform for the<br />
Government, and one in which Mr Howe has already been<br />
closely involved. I look forward to working with Mr Howe in<br />
carrying this vital and complex initiative forward.<br />
I welcome Mr Price as the new Parliamentary Secretary and<br />
Senator McMullan to his new job.<br />
These appointments will permit the Government to maintain a<br />
large measure of continuity and, at the same time, bring new<br />
energy to bear on matters of high priority.<br />
The full details of the new Hawke Ministry are shown in the<br />
attachment. </p>
