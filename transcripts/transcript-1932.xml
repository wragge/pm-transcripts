QOULBURN LILAC TIME FESTIVAL<br />
CIVIC RECEPTION<br />
GOLJLBURN, N. S. W. 4 OCTOBER 1968<br />
Speech by the-Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Mayor, the Mayoress, Members of Parliament and Distinguished<br />
Guests:-The first thing I must do, Mr. Mayor, is to thank you for<br />
being kind enough to extend to me this civic welcome and to give me the<br />
opportunity to meet some of the leading citizens of Goulburn and its<br />
surroundings. I must make clear though, Mr. Mayor, that this is by no'<br />
means my first visit to this city, although it is my first visit as Prime<br />
Minister. On more than one occasion in the past, I have been here and<br />
have had a chance to tour the city and have had a chance to see it. One<br />
occasion that stands out in my memory was when the State Member and<br />
myself attended the opening and dedication of a science laboratory. at if<br />
remember rightly St. Patrick's College. This also gave us an opportunity<br />
to learn. something of the city of Goulburn. But this is the first visit as<br />
Prime Minister, and it is therefore doubly important to me.<br />
I should have liked to have been able to come earlier today.<br />
In fact it was possible, but extremely difficult. After all, my wife and I<br />
have just spent three days over in Western Australia, du~ ring which I think<br />
we had one fifteen minute spell to ourselves. We arrived back at about<br />
half past five last night in a state of almost utter exhaustion, and I really<br />
did have to do some -work in the office today before I could come.<br />
Nevertheless, I do apologise for having passed up the opportunity to come<br />
earlier and to see Supertex and the other industries here.<br />
It was a pleasure to me, for a variety of reasons, when<br />
Dugald Munro asked me wouild I come to attend the Lilac Time festivities.<br />
One of them, of course, is that it is so pleasantly named. Lilac Time<br />
has got some aura of nostalgia about it for all of us or for most of us,<br />
particularly those who were born about the same time as I was when we<br />
remember Schubert and " Lilac Time" and the songs that came over and<br />
we used to bash them out.<br />
But also for another reason, because it seems to epitomise<br />
a community spirit which is so utterly necessary in towns * such as Goulburn<br />
or in towns such as the one in which I grew up. That was where, for a<br />
while, I was Shire President -Kerang a smaller town, but nevertheless J/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
one that needed this kind of community spirit. Because what is means is<br />
that you began how long ago? fifteen years, sixteen years a long time<br />
ago to work towards attaining something for the town and the citizens who<br />
live in it. You began building that which you now have, the Festivities Hall,<br />
which I haven't seen, but which, judging from the pictures of it, is a real<br />
addition to this or any other community.<br />
Rather than just say, ." Well, we hope someone will give us<br />
the money for this" whether it be a state or whether it be a Commonwealth<br />
Government you did something about it yourselves. You began to get<br />
together as a community and to raise the funds and to build a hail, and you<br />
have been doing it ever since, and.. I can't remember blt $ 70, 000:<br />
or $ 80, 000 or something of that order has already been raised. Here is<br />
this concrete result in this city of the effort that is being put into it. Really,<br />
I think perhaps a manifestation of a community spirit of this kind means<br />
more than the mere bricks and mortar which are seen in the form of a<br />
building. It means,, I would have thought, great satisfaction to all those<br />
who over the years have given something of themselves, something of their<br />
time, in order to see that the community in which they live can be improved.<br />
For these reasons, it appeared to me pleasant to be asked<br />
to attend on this occasion.<br />
I don't know, Sir, that I can comment very much on your<br />
remarks about the development of Canberra and the development of Goulburn<br />
because I haven't had the chance to study them, and therefore anything I<br />
said would be just an immediate reaction.<br />
But what I would hope would be that as the National Capital<br />
develops, and develops as it will to a quarter of a million people before<br />
very long, then it would be inevitable, whether some kind of light industries<br />
were established in it or not, that all the region would benefit if it were only<br />
as a market for what the region surrounding it could produce, if it were only<br />
as a provider of opportunities for employment of young people at a centre<br />
closer to the region than Sydney or Melbourne. I would think that kind of<br />
development must have complementary development in the region around it.<br />
Other than that, Sir, I can do nothing more than join in your<br />
general approach that regional development is good. And when I say that,<br />
I am not just talking because I do claim.. I don't know whether credit is<br />
the right word.. I do claim some involvement with the decision which led<br />
to the building of a teachers' college in this city of Goulburn. I was the<br />
Minister at the time, and if you remember there was some question as to<br />
whether it should go here, or whether it should go somewhere else, or<br />
whether if it went here it would upset going to Canberra, or if Canberra<br />
built one it would upset this one. But it didn't. There is one being built<br />
here, and that will bring undoubtedly, not only those who will be attending<br />
it as students and people who will be teaching the students, but the others<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>S3-<br />
who will be required to meet their needs to maintain their motor cars,<br />
do their laundry and provide what they eat and all the other things<br />
which follow when an accretion of population happens in any particular<br />
district. So at least one small act has been done before these words<br />
were spoken. I finish because I was told I must not talk too long, and I<br />
probably have already. I finish by thanking you once again for the<br />
opportunity of meeting the citizens of Goulburn. I finish by expressing<br />
the hope that in Goulburn and in the centres like it throughout the length<br />
and breadth of Australia, there will be a growth, there will be a fostering<br />
of community pride, of community service.. and through that, pride<br />
and service to the nation. This nation is being built as the centres are<br />
being built, and the centres are being built to a large degree by community<br />
effort by people such as you. And I thank you for that.<br />
