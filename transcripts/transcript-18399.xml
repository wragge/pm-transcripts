    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today we pause to remember the people of Christchurch, who suffered so cruelly when their beautiful city was struck by a great earthquake one year ago today.</p>
<p>The devastating earthquake took the lives of 185 people and grievously wounded many more.</p>
<p>Much of the city was crushed, including historic landmarks like the ChristChurch Cathedral, and thousands of homes were lost to liquefaction.</p>
<p>In this past year more than 10,000 aftershocks have continued to shake the city and its surrounding districts and test its people.</p>
<p>Australians responded with generosity and compassion to this great tragedy, just as New Zealand did in response to our summer of disasters in 2011.</p>
<p>Today, Christchurch is again in our thoughts, our sorrow and grief undiminished, our respect never greater.</p>
