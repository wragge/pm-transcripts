<p>Mr Gyngell has a distinguished track record both within and outside government in the analysis of international issues. </p>

<p>In government, his career has included senior positions in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of National Assessments and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
<p>He has had diplomatic postings in the United States and in Asia. He served as foreign policy adviser to former Prime Minister Paul Keating between 1993 and 1996. </p>
