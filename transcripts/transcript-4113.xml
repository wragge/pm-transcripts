PRIME MINISTER<br />

ELECTORAL TALK<br />
I want to talk with you today about the Government's<br />
federalism reforms as they specifically apply to local<br />
government.. The Liberal and National Country Parties believe in the basic<br />
right of people to seek their own goals in life, with Ã¸ the<br />
Government providing the legal framework and other conditions<br />
that make this possible.<br />
The Labor Party tried to take Australia rapidly down the road<br />
to'. a centralist, tightly regulated, bur2aucratic<br />
state, built on ever-rising taxes and a growing dominance<br />
of government over people.<br />
Our task is to effectively demonstrate that there is a<br />
realistic alternative.<br />
We can have a country where government decisions are made as<br />
close as possible to the people affected. We can have imaginative<br />
yet sound and responsible government at the grass roots.<br />
Unfortunately local government, in Australia has been for too<br />
long regarded as the poor third cousin of our three-tiered<br />
system of government. It has not deserved this status. / 2 </p>
<p>It was aginst this background that the Liberal National<br />
Country Party Federal1 Government shaped an important part of<br />
its federalism policy.<br />
These policies the most far reaching reforms ever proposed<br />
in the decentralisation of government power in Australia<br />
have been acclaimed by State Premiers and at the highest levels<br />
of local government.<br />
Federalism is not just a structural concept. It is not<br />
just about C(-istribution of taxpayers money. It is a cornerstone<br />
of Liberal philosophy.<br />
Let there be no doubt that I and my government regard federalism<br />
as a guarantee of political and individual freedom..<br />
By very nature, federalism will prevent the dangerous<br />
concentration of power into the hands of a few. Federalism<br />
is a new deal and a better deal for the people.<br />
It is gratifying that our federalism reforms have received<br />
strong support by both State and local government.<br />
This week, the controlling body f or local government throughout<br />
Australia the Australian Council of Local Government Associationscame<br />
out and supported our initiatives.<br />
In a comprehensive statement, the Council said:<br />
" Local government is enthusiastic and receptive about the<br />
Commonwealth Government's concept of federalisma; that is,<br />
a philosophy of cooperative government which included the<br />
interaction and operation of the three spheres of Federal,<br />
State and local government." / 13<br />

<p>-3-<br />
The Council accepted the revenue sharing proposals;<br />
applauded the proposal to set up an Advisory Council for<br />
Inter-Governmental Relations and agreed with our proposals<br />
to establish State Grants Commissions in those States that did<br />
not have them.<br />
Included in its statement, the Council had some questions about<br />
specific parts of the reform. This included questions about<br />
the actual level of assistance that will come to local government<br />
in the next Budget.<br />
As I outlined to the Parliament this week, the Grants Commission<br />
is now involved in the complex process of looking at the actual<br />
definition of local government. This is an important matter as<br />
definitions vary from State to State. We are clearly anxious that<br />
local municipalities are given fair and just consideration.<br />
That is the reason for this examination.<br />
The Commission is also examining the breakup of funds between each<br />
State to be made available to loc. al governments.<br />
I am ver much aware of the financial difficulties facing local.<br />
government authorities. Although the implementation of the<br />
revenue-sharing proposals must be looked at in the light of our<br />
present economic situation, a firm decision has been taken that<br />
local government will participate in the new tax-sharing arrangements,<br />
from July 1 this year.<br />
This assistance will be related to the yield of Commonwealth<br />
personal incomte tax. The total level of assistance which local<br />
government might expect to receive, under these new arrangements will<br />
be announced as soon as possible.<br />
Under our reforms local government will be better off. Like the<br />
States local government-will have access to a guaranteed percentage<br />
of income tax. Because income tax is a growth tax local government<br />
will be in a position to respond to the new and growing demands made<br />
on it. </p>
<p>Local government will be able to plan its programmes and services<br />
knowing it has a guaranteed growth in income.<br />
Meantime, a working party of officials from the State and the<br />
Commonwealth has beenset up to work out what matters should<br />
be taken into account when allocating funds within the States.<br />
Thi.-, again is a complex and important consideration and great<br />
care is being taken to make sure that all local municipalitie3<br />
are fairly treated.<br />
Within each State,; a certain proportion of -funds will be<br />
made available to all local governments on a per capita basis<br />
which could be weighted for other dissabilities such as area<br />
and distance. The remaining part will be made available on a<br />
needs basis by State Grant Commissions.<br />
After the last successful Premier's Conference, all Premiers<br />
agreed to establish these State Grants Commissions in those States'<br />
thaL do not already have them.<br />
We believe that each sphere of government should make decisions*<br />
on matters appropriate to that sphere. Matters of proper concern<br />
to more than one sphere should be decided through a process-of<br />
genuine consultation and cooperation.<br />
For the federalism reform to work to the benefit of all<br />
Australians it is important that all State Grants Commissions<br />
are established as soon as possible, so they can make their own<br />
* investigations about specific local needs.<br />
After years in the wilderness, local government in Australia now<br />
has a chance to be treated and to operate as a highly<br />
responsible element of the system of government in Australia.<br />
We all have much to learn about the process of government. It is<br />
quite certain, however, that local governments have much to<br />
contribute to enhance our system of government.<br />
