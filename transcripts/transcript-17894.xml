I am pleased to announced new arrangements for the positions of Secretary in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.</p>
<p>Mr Mark Paterson AO recently finished in the position of Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research in order to take up the position of Director-General of the Department of Trade and Investment in New South Wales. I wish to pay tribute to the contribution that Mr Paterson has made to the Public Service since he joined in 2002 as the Secretary of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. In 2007 he was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his service to business and industry, to the resources sector and to tourism development.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Dr Don Russell as the Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. Dr Russellhas had a varied and distinguished career in both the public and private sectors over a number of years. He is currently the Chairman of the NSW State Super SAS Trustee Corporation. He held senior positions within the Australian government during a period of significant economic reform. He served as a senior executive in the Department of the Treasury in the 1980's. He was principal adviser to former Prime Minister and Treasurer the Hon Paul Keating. As Australia's Ambassador to the United States he helped to promote Australia's interests with one of our key partners. More recently, he has also held a number of senior financial sector positions both in Australia and the US. I am sure Dr Russell's experience and knowledge and his ability to relate effectively to the private sector will be a considerable asset to the Commonwealth in his new role.</p>
<p>Following the early detection and successful treatment of cancer I am pleased that Ms Robyn Kruk AM will return to work and that she has agreed to take up the position of Chief Executive Officer designate of the National Mental Health Commission. The Commission was announced as part of the 2011-12 Budget and will be recommended to the Governor-General for establishment from 1 January 2012.</p>
<p>Ms Kruk comes to this position with a wealth of experience in public administration, including significant experience in health policy from her time as Director-General of the NSW Department of Health. During her time in that position, Ms Kruk oversaw major reforms to NSW Health's clinical governance and health services. Under her direction NSW developed and implemented significant reforms in mental health services. The new Commission will have the benefit of Ms Kruk's considerable expertise in developing this important health initiative.</p>
<p>In order to assist in setting up the Commission prior to taking up her new appointment, Ms Kruk has resigned from her position as Secretary of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Dr Paul Grimes PSM as the Secretary of the Departmentof Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Dr Grimes has been acting in that position since September 2010. Prior to that appointment, he was the Associate Secretary of the Domestic Policy Group in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He has previously held senior roles in the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Treasury and other jurisdictions. Dr Grimes was awarded the Public Service Medal in 2010 for outstanding public service in the development of the Australian Government's response to the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>I thank Mr Paterson and Ms Kruk for their contributions and I congratulate Dr Russell and Dr Grimes on their appointments, which will each be for a period of five years.</p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that Dr Ken Henry AC has been appointed by the Governor-General as Special Adviser on a part-time basis in my portfolio. Dr Henry is currently on extended leave taking a well-deserved break after 10 years of outstanding service as the Secretary to the Treasury. I will be having further discussions with him on the details of the advisory role closer to his return from leave. I am pleased that Dr Henry's extensive knowledge and experience remains available to the Australian Government.  </p>
