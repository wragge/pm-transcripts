    <content><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow I will meet with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Rt Hon Helen Clark in Canberra.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand enjoy a strong and robust bilateral relationship founded on a unique shared history and international outlook.  Probably no two societies in the world are as similar as New Zealand and Australia. </p>
<p>This year marks the 25th Anniversary of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, one of the world's earliest free trade agreements and one of its most successful. </p>
<p>New Zealand is Australia's sixth largest trading partner and our largest for manufactures.  It is our third largest destination for investment overseas.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Clark ways we can continue to grow trans-Tasman relations.</p>
<p>Our close cooperation on regional and international issues, including climate change and the Pacific, will also be important matters for discussion. </p>
<p>I welcome this opportunity to meet Prime Minister Clark so soon after our last meeting in December.  A close cooperative relationship between Australia and New Zealand makes each of us stronger.</p>
