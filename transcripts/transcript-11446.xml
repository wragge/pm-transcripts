<p>  Good evening. Although we live in a time of general economic plenty, there</p>
<p>   are some areas of our country that are missing out. And because we are doing</p>
<p>   well nationally the sense of loss and alienation in those areas is all the</p>
<p>   greater. Many people in rural and regional areas feel this particularly</p>
<p>   keenly when local services close and move away.</p>
<p>  That is why we promised at the last election to do something tangible about</p>
<p>   bringing services back to the bush. One of our key election promises was</p>
<p>   to support the establishment of up to 500 rural transaction centres around</p>
<p>   Australia to provide a range of services that have disappeared from many</p>
<p>   small regional communities.</p>
<p>  By opening rural transaction centres we are sending a clear message to rural</p>
<p>   and regional Australia that we are determined to work with you to bring</p>
<p>   services back to the bush. Those services could include banking, Medicare</p>
<p>   Easyclaim and Centrelink as well as training and business support. This</p>
<p>   will ensure that many more people in country areas have access to the services</p>
<p>   that those of us in the city take for granted. When I recently opened the</p>
<p>   first of these 500 centres in Eugowra, I paid tribute to the local community</p>
<p>   who had worked to bring this about.</p>
<p>  This policy is an example of what I call the social coalition in action.</p>
<p>   We pool the financial resources of the government and the expertise and</p>
<p>   local knowledge of communities and businesses in a creative partnership</p>
<p>   which ensures that the final outcome is better than what any one group acting</p>
<p>   alone could have achieved.</p>
<p>  An important feature of this $70 million programme is that it empowers each</p>
<p>   community to select the services it needs and role of the Government is</p>
<p>   to and respond and listen. Goodnight.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
