SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIA PRIZE<br />
CANBERRA 14 MAY 1990<br />
Prize winners,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Not since the new Parliament House was opened two years ago<br />
have we hosted such a significant occasion in this building.<br />
Your presence here tonight for the inaugural award of the<br />
Australia Prize is itself a statement about our nation's<br />
emerging priorities, a recognition of the standing science<br />
now rightly has in our society.<br />
Australia hos never lacked talented and committed<br />
scientists. In fact our brief history boasts a record of<br />
real achievement in many fields. I doubt, however, I would<br />
get much argument from tonight's audience with the<br />
proposition that, until recently, science has had to<br />
struggle for fair recognition for its role and its<br />
importance. Perhaps you can draw some comfort from the fact<br />
that the recent elections saw, for the first time, science<br />
discussed as an issue in its own right. At the time, I<br />
argued that for Australia's future it was essential that we<br />
should no longer be content to be just the lucky country;<br />
that we must also become the clever country. That sentiment<br />
struck a very receptive chord in the community. The reason<br />
it did was not because it was some catchy slogan that<br />
offered hope in difficult times. Rather it reflected a<br />
genuine belief among Australians that if we are to maintain<br />
our place in the first rank of the developed nations we must<br />
embrace, and embrace enthusiastically, a culture in which<br />
science and technology are vital elements. We are, after<br />
all, in the region of. the world which is growing fastest and<br />
which counts among its member countries some of those at the<br />
forefront of scientific effort.<br />
For government the encouragement of science has to be an end<br />
in itself. In the words of the American science writer<br />
Timothy Ferris: " Science is young. Whether it will survive<br />
long enough to become old depends upon our sanity and<br />
courage and vigour So the challenge now, in an age<br />
when physics pushes into fields once the domain solely of<br />
philosophers and theologians, is to ensure that it does<br />
grow old'. </p>
<p>Scientists have proved in this country that given adequate<br />
resources they will produce work of great worth. The<br />
relevance science now has to the wider community can perhaps<br />
be best demonstrated at the anecdotal level. Had I, a<br />
decade ago, stood here and told you that a book on<br />
theoretical physics Stephen Hawking's " A Brief History of<br />
Time" would be a best-seller I would have been regarded as<br />
slightly eccentric. Had I gone on to claim that books on<br />
chaos theory were also doing a brisk trade that judgement<br />
would have been confirmed. What this phenomenon tells us is<br />
that science is exciting interest in the broader community.<br />
Scientists are also reaching out, educating we laymen and<br />
women that science for its own sake is of fundamental<br />
relevance to us, to our understanding of the world and to<br />
the shape our future might take.<br />
Another factor in the increased interest in and respect for<br />
science can be directly traced to the rapid rise of the<br />
environment as an issue. When people have questions about<br />
environmental issues they do not turn to business or to<br />
political leaders for answers they turn to scientists.<br />
So, too, do governments. The decision my Government made<br />
last year not to proceed with the Wesley Vale pulp mill, in<br />
the end, rested on the work of the CSIRO. After all the<br />
arguments about jobs, development, balance of export<br />
earnings and import replacements had been heard it was the<br />
high-quality, cogent and accessible work of the CSIRO that<br />
convinced the Cabinet that it would not be responsible to<br />
proceed with the project.<br />
Science now has a secure place at the top of my Government's<br />
priorities. One of the critical decisions we have taken to<br />
ensure this was to establish the Prime Minister's Science<br />
Council and the Office of the Chief Scientist in my own<br />
Department. Now, when science speaks in this country I hear<br />
directly what it has to say. [ Ralph Slatyer makes sure of<br />
this!] Foremost amongst our concerns as a Government has been<br />
improving ways of bringing the power of science and<br />
technology to bear on achieving higher rates of economic<br />
growth, on improving the health of the nation, on national<br />
defence, and on solving the pressing problems of the<br />
environment. In addition, we must ensure Australia has a highly skilled<br />
work-force able to support new technologies and new<br />
industrial challenges amenable to science and technology.<br />
To this end, we have provided additional equipment and<br />
research funds for higher education institutions and<br />
government research organisations. We have also provided<br />
extra post-graduate awards to increase the number of highly<br />
qualified young people entering the Australian workforce<br />
young people who will maintain the proud tradition of<br />
Australian scientific research. </p>
<p>Australia has also resolved to work to reduce its reliance<br />
on imported technology and borrowed research. We must<br />
become a leader in the production and export of ideas. My<br />
Government has already dramatically boosted our science and<br />
technology potential with a $ 1,000 million package of<br />
initiatives last year. But to stay abreast and move ahead<br />
of the world, we need to pool the talents of our university,<br />
Commonwealth, State and private sector researchers and link<br />
them more effectively to the rest of the economy. As a step<br />
towards this goal the Government recently announced that it<br />
has decided to establish a network of 50 world class<br />
Cooperative Research Centres. My Minister for Science and<br />
Technology, Simon Crean, will be responsible for the<br />
introduction of these new research centres, which will<br />
create additional jobs for about 1,000 talented Australian<br />
scientists. Each research centre, when fully established over the next<br />
five years, will be staffed with a team of highly skilled<br />
scientists, using the latest high tech equipment, exchanging<br />
information around the world making, we are confident,<br />
scientific breakthroughs in medicine, technology, pollution<br />
control, communications. And so, instead of young<br />
Australian scientists having to go to Europe, America and<br />
Japan to find the leading edge of scientific research, we'll<br />
have their scientists coming to us.<br />
While the measures I have just described are focussed on<br />
strengthening science and technology in Australia, there is<br />
also a pressing need to continue to encourage the<br />
community's awareness of the importance of science and<br />
technology. A central task here is to ensure that our young<br />
people fully appreciate the opportunities that exist for<br />
challenging and rewarding careers in science and technology.<br />
They must also be well prepared to live in an increasingly<br />
technological society, not just as passive observers, but as<br />
active participants.<br />
I am particularly pleased that we have in the audience<br />
tonight a number of young people, representatives of the<br />
young Australians who have already distinguished themselves<br />
in their studies in science and technology.<br />
The attitudes and ambitions of these young people, and<br />
others like them will determine the type of society we have<br />
in this country in the years ahead.<br />
To meet this need for greater public awareness of science<br />
and technology, my Government included a Science and<br />
Technology Awareness Program amongst the measures it<br />
introduced last year. The program's goal is to increase<br />
awareness of the central role of science and technology in<br />
achieving economic growth and improved national well-being.<br />
At the pinnacle of this program is the Australia Prize.<br />
Other measures are designed to inform the general community<br />
of the role of science and technology in national life.<br />
Academic achievement by young Australians is being<br />
encouraged through support for participation in the </p>
<p>Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Olympiads. This year<br />
will also see the introduction of the Australian Students'<br />
Prize. Five hundred of these will be awarded each year to<br />
our best young achievers at the end of Year 12. They will<br />
encourage the ever-increasing number of students finishing<br />
high school to strive for excellence.<br />
Although the Government can do much to increase public<br />
awareness of science and technology, it cannot hope to make<br />
the necessary impact on opinions and attitudes unless it is<br />
supported by other sections of the community. Importantly,<br />
industry is playing its part. The BHP Science Awards for<br />
teachers of science and technology, the CFRA Science Summer<br />
Schools and the Shell Program for Young Achievers all raise<br />
interest and reward enthusiasm and achievement.<br />
Let me turn now to the matter which brings us here this<br />
evening: the Australia Prize.<br />
This is an annual award to recognise an outstanding<br />
achievement in a selected area of science promoting human<br />
welfare. In inaugurating this award, the Government wishes to<br />
recognise and reward scientific achievement, wherever it<br />
occurs. We wish also to enhance and promote Australia's<br />
image as a nation with a proud record of scientific<br />
achievement and appreciation of the value of such<br />
achievement in ourselves and in others.<br />
Despite being a country with a small population, and the<br />
disadvantage of being remote from the major centres of<br />
learning and culture, Australia has an excellent record of<br />
research and of contribution to the world of learning.<br />
I shall not dwell for long on the achievements that led the<br />
Australia Prize Committee to select the distinguished<br />
winners of this inaugural Australia Prize. We have all seen<br />
the excellent video which portrays so graphically the nature<br />
and importance of the work for which they are now being<br />
recognised. The field of research selected by the Committee this year<br />
the biological sciences related to agriculture and the<br />
environment is, of course, one of vital interest to<br />
Australia: one that bridges our lucky country foundations<br />
and our clever country aspirations. During the whole of the<br />
period-since European settlement, our economy has owed much<br />
to agriculture. Although we have prospered from the<br />
abundance of our agricultural production, there has been a<br />
high cost in terms of land degradation and an increasing<br />
dependence on chemical fertilisers, pesticides and<br />
herbicides. As we have just seen, the advances we are<br />
honouring this evening will reduce that dependence on<br />
chemicals. Not only is work in this field of vital<br />
importance to Australia, it is also an area of research in<br />
which Australia has displayed particular strength. For this<br />
reason, it is appropriate, and also particularly gratifying, </p>
<p>that one of the winners of this inaugural Australia Prize<br />
should be an Australian.<br />
Let me record my Government's gratitude for the efforts of<br />
the Australia Prize Committee. This panel of distinguished<br />
Australians has brought wide knowledge and experience to<br />
bear on a difficult and demanding task. They have chosen<br />
wisely and well; I commend them for their efforts; and I<br />
congratulate the distinguished prize-winners on winning the<br />
inaugural Australia Prize. </p>
