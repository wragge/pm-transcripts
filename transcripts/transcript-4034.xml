PRIME MINISTERI<br />
FOR PREbSJanuary 25, 1976<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY<br />
For 188 years, Australians first the convicts, the pioneers,<br />
sezttlers and their descendants and now the migrants of the<br />
Post War years have used their ability and their enterprise<br />
to create a nation with vast potentialities.<br />
Today Australians celebrate the anniversary of frst settlement<br />
amidst national and international challenaes.<br />
Australia's inflation and unemployment rates, although abating,<br />
still remain high.<br />
The Government has taken actions in the economic field to<br />
lay the grounds for economic recovery and for an upturn in<br />
business expansion.<br />
Processes for reviewing Government expenditure have been<br />
initiated. These will bring under control the extravagance<br />
of the past three years and make for a more effective and<br />
economical public sector.<br />
Steps have also been taken to stimulate consumef spending<br />
to encourage economic recovery and bus _ S3 netet The<br />
means we have chosen are designed to lay the foundations for<br />
real recovery.<br />
I again pledge my Government to work for the well-being of all<br />
Australians. We are one people and one nation. / 2 </p>
<p>Our over-riding commitment is to the value and dignity of each<br />
individual and to ensuring that they have the opportunity to<br />
develop their talents and their capacities.<br />
The decisions of the Government will be taken with this as the<br />
prime objective.<br />
I must also say that the solution of our present difficulties<br />
will not be easy.<br />
It will take hard work and commitment. It will take dedication.<br />
It will require a recocnition that our most important interests are<br />
the ones we all share in common.<br />
It will also require the recognition that our material resources<br />
are limited, that the more resources governments take the less<br />
pecple are able to choose for themselves the way in which they<br />
will live their own lives.<br />
Australia was not built by its governments acting alone. Australia<br />
grew out of a sense of the idealism of its people and out of the<br />
combined efforts of people and government. The com unity must<br />
play its part in Australia's recovery and development.<br />
Australia has unparalleled advantages. We have a highly<br />
skilled and educated population, vast natural resources and<br />
responsive political institutions.<br />
These advantages hold out the promise of restored prosperity<br />
in a vigorous and growing nation.<br />
We can have economic stability and progress, industrial harmony,<br />
ensure the security and well being of the disadvantaged, and the<br />
maximum freedom of individual citizens to make their own decisions<br />
about their own lives. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
These things . can only be achieved, if, as a people, we recognise<br />
national interests and national objectives and work together.<br />
We will fail if individuals or groups selfishly pursue their<br />
own ends at the expense of Australia.<br />
The Government, will seek to work with all Australians and<br />
asks that individuals and organisations also recognise their<br />
obligation to the national well-being. </p>
