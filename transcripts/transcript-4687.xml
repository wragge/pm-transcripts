-J 3AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 APRIL 1978<br />
Transfer of Antarctic Division to Kingston,<br />
Tasmania<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that as part of the<br />
Government's implementation of the Callaghan Report ( Structure<br />
of Industry and Employment Situation in Tasmania) he has<br />
written to the Premier of Tasmania, the Honourable D. A. Lowe,<br />
suggesting that discussions, aimed at assisting the<br />
Tasmanian tourist industry, be held in relation to the<br />
construction of the new headquarters for the Antarctic Division<br />
of the Commonwealth Department of Science.<br />
There is potential to develop the new headquarters into a<br />
tourist attraction by incorporating displays depicting Antarctic<br />
operations both past and present in the building comples.<br />
The discussions will also look at the possibility of constructing<br />
a replica of Mawson' s hut in a landscaped area adjacent to the<br />
main entrance. It would be complementary to the display areas<br />
and would contain artifacts from Mawson' s and other Antarctic<br />
expeditions. The Prime MInister also announced that, arising out of the<br />
Government's decisions on the Callaghan Report he is considering<br />
what options are available for accelerating the-transfer of<br />
the Antarctic Division to Kingston. </p>
