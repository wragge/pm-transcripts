    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Good morning, I just want to say as I leave Kuala Lumpur that this has been a very positive and successful visit.  It's been short, but it's been quite intense and it underlines the return to normality at the highest level of the relationship between Australia and Malaysia.  It was always strong underneath, but there were some problems at the top, those problems are now well behind us and Prime Minister Abdullah and I are good and old friends, and this has been a very useful reaffirmation of the full restoration and the full return to normality of the relationship.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Is the Iraq relationship, with the differences over Iraq, going to be any kind of problem down the track do you think?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, not at all.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Are you expecting to get a briefing from the Americans once their new revised strategy on the Iraq is out?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I get constant briefings from the Americans.  The Iraq survey group or whatever you call it, the Iraq, the Baker-Hamilton Group will produce its report.  I don't believe that there is going to be any precipitate American withdrawal, but obviously it's sensible to look at many variations and many iterations of tactics and military activity.  Fundamentally though, the best way forward will be for the politicians within Iraq to seize the moment themselves and try and bring about an end to the sectarian violence.  I have seen some reports this morning suggesting that there is a new grouping possibly involving people from both Shia and the Sunni groups, now without taking sides between any particular group it's  that sort of activity which will offer a great deal of hope in the future.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> The Labor Party is now going to go through another leadership challenge, do you see any benefit at all for the Coalition parties from that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Malcolm, I have no comment to make. The leadership of the Australian Labor Party is a matter for the Labor Party, I am getting on with the job of the leadership of the Government. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Who would you rather face in an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I have no comment to make on the leadership of the Labor Party. I am getting on with the business of government. Thank you.</p>
