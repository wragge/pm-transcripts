SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, Q. C. 1M. P.,<br />
AT A PUBLIC MEETING AT MITCHAM HIGH SCHOOL, MELBOURNE,<br />
FRIDAY 1 MARCH 1974<br />
IT IS WITH A SPECIAL SENSE OF PLEASURE THAT I COME TO<br />
THE EASTERN AREA OF MELBOURNE TONIGHT. FOR IT IS THIS AREA WHICH<br />
PLAYED A VITAL ROLE ON 2 DECEMBER 1972 INTHE ELECTION OF THE FIRST<br />
NATIONAL LABOR GOVERNMENT IN 23 YEARS. WE NEEDED TO W IN FOUR<br />
SEATS TO GAIN GOVERNMENT. ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THE-START OF<br />
COUNTING ON THAT NIGHT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE WOULD WIN THESE<br />
SEATS IN THIS AREA. WE KNEW THEN THAT CASEY, HOLT, DIAMOND VALLEY<br />
AND LA TROBE HAD . GONE To LABOR. OUR GAINS ELSEWHERE WOULD<br />
CONSTITUTE OUR WORKING MAJORITYo OUR SAFETY MARGIN.<br />
ONE . OF THE VICTORIES HERE GAVE ME PARTICULAR SATISFACTION;<br />
IT MEANT THAT RACE MATHEWS, WHO, AS MY PRIVATE SECRETARY HAD DONE<br />
SO MUCH TO DEVELOP OUR POLICIES FOR GOVERNMENT, WOULD ENTER<br />
PARLIAMENT AS THE MEMBER FOR CASEY. NO LEADER WOULD HAVE BEEN<br />
LESS THAN DELIGHTED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS SEAT<br />
ALONGSIDE MAX OLDMEADOW, DAVID MCK( ENZIE AND TONY LArM. As<br />
CANDIDATES THEY PROMISED TO BE EXCELLENT MEMBERS; AS MEMBERS<br />
THEY HAVE ALREADY PROVED THEIR EXCELLENCE. . a a/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
NO PART OF AUSTRALIA PROVIDES A BETTER INDICATION OF WHY<br />
WE WON THE ELECTION THAN THE EASTERN SUBURBS OF MELBOURNE. THEY<br />
HAVE SEEN PHENOMENAL GROWTH IN THE POST-WAR YEARS BUT WITH THIS<br />
GROWTH HAVE COME A HOST OF PROBLEMS. OUR SCHOOLS, OUR HOSPITALS,<br />
OUR HEALTH SERVICES, OUR TRANSPORT FACILITIES, OUR COMMUNITY<br />
SERVICES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE GREAT EXPANSION OF OUR<br />
MAJOR CITIES. THIS WAS PLAIN TO THE VOTERS OF THESE SUBURBS AND<br />
THEY MADE THEIR AWARENESS EQUALLY PLAIN WITH THEIR VOTES. THEY<br />
KNEW THAT NO PROMISE MADE BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT COULD<br />
COMPENSATE FOR 23 YEARS OF NEGLECT AND MIS-MANAGEMENT. THEY KNEW<br />
THAT ONLY AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST AND MOST REPRESENTATIVE POLITICAL<br />
PARTY THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY HAD DRAWN UP PROGRAMS TO TACKLE<br />
THE MAMMOTH PROBLEMS OF OUR CITIES.<br />
THEY ALSO KNEW THAT ONLY THE LABOR PARTY WOULD BE GUIDED<br />
BY THE PRINCI-PLES OF EQUALITY AND EQUITY IN ITS APPROACH TO THESE<br />
PROBLEMS. THOSE PRINCIPLES HAVE REMAINED OUR BEACON IN THE<br />
MONTHS SINCE-THE PEOPLE OF THIS AND OTHER AREAS OF AUSTRALIA<br />
RECORDED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THEM. IN ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THAT<br />
TIME WE HAVE SOUGHT TO MEASURE UP TO THE IDEAL CONTAINED IN MY<br />
ELECTION POLICY SPEECH WHEN I SAID: " IT'S TIME FOR A NEW TEAM,<br />
A NEW PROGRAM, A NEW DRIVE FOR EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITIES; IT'S<br />
TIME TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIANS.-TIME FOR A NEW<br />
VISION OF WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IN THIS GENERATION FOR OUR NATION<br />
AND THE REGION IN WHICH WE LIVE." s @/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
IN THAT SAME SPEECH I SAID THAT OUR PROGRAM WAS<br />
AMBITIOUS, AND THAT WE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO CLEAR AWAY THE<br />
BACKLOG OF 23 YEARS IN 3 MONTHS OR EVEN 3 YEARS, A START, HOWEVER,<br />
HAS BEEN MADE AND, IN LINE WITH OUR GOAL OF SHARED OPPORTUNITY<br />
AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS, WE HAVE SET OUR NATION ON<br />
A NEW COURSE, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DONE ENOUGH TO<br />
ENSURE THAT THERE CAN BE NO TURNINGBACK FROM THAT COURSE,<br />
LET US LOOK AT THE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT JUSTIFY SUCH A<br />
PRONOUNCEMENT. THERE CAN BE NO GREATER JUSTIFICATION THAN OUR<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS IN EDUCATION, WE HAVE RAISED THE EDUCATIONAL<br />
HORIZONS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN, WE HAVE<br />
TAKEN THE FIRST MAJOR STEPS TO FULFIL OUR OBJECTIVE OF BRINGING<br />
HIGHER STANDARDS OF EDUCATION AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN<br />
EDUCATION TO EVERY CHILD AT EVERY LEVEL FROM PRE-SCHOOL TO<br />
TERTIARY, IN ITS FIRST BUDGET THE GOVERNV: ENT COMMITTED<br />
$ 843 MILLION TO EDUCATION FOR 1973/ 74 ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT<br />
GIVEN BY OUR PREDECESSORS IN 1972/ 73. THE ALLOCATION FOR<br />
GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN<br />
VICTORIA ALONE IS $ 57.7 MILLION AN INCREASE OF 153 PER CENT,<br />
WE HAVE ASSUMED FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERTIARY<br />
EDUCATION AND HAVE ABOLISHED FEES, FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE<br />
GIVING ASSISTANCE TO TEACHERS COLLEGES AND PRE-SCHOOL TEACHERS<br />
COLLEGES ON THE SAME BASIS AS UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF<br />
ADVANCED EDUCATION; WE WILL SPEND $ 188 : IILLION ON TEACHER<br />
EDUCATION IN THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS FROM 1 JULY LAST YEAR,<br />
WE ARE GIVING MUCH MORE GENEROUS ALLOWANCES TO STUDENTS AND WE<br />
HAVE MORE THAN TREBLED THE NUMBER OF SCHOLARSHIPS, ,/ 4 </p>
<p>IN'THE SPECIFIC FIELDS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION<br />
WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE A TOTAL OF $ 700 MILLION TO ALL SCHOOLS IN<br />
1974 AND 1975. OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE TO THIS GREAT INCREASE IN FUNDS,<br />
IS OUR ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERMANENT SCHOOLS COMMISSION TO GIVE AID<br />
TO ALL SCHOOLS WITHOUT DISTINCTION ON A " tNEEDS" i BASIS.. THIS WILL<br />
BE A MECHANISM BY WHICH WE WILL SEEK TO ENSURE EQUALITY OF<br />
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN.<br />
IBELIEVE THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS RIGHT TO BE PROUD OF<br />
SUCH ADVANCES. IT MUST BE RECOGNISEDi HOWEVER, THAT. MUCH OF THE<br />
DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR NEW PROGRAMS IN EDUCATION WILL<br />
DEPEND UPON THE PLANNING AND CO-OPERATION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />
AND NON-GOVERNMENT EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. FOR THIS REASON I AM<br />
DIST IURBED AT THE PROPAGANDA EMANATING FROM CERTAIN STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />
THAT THE FUNDS PROVIDED FOR 1974 AND 1975 ARE RIGIDLY EAR-MARKED.<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT ABOUT $ 44 MILLION IS ASSIGNED To GOVERNMENT<br />
DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS THAT IS TO AREAS OF PAST CHRONIC NEGLECT<br />
AND UNDER-ACHIEVEMENT. IT IS TRUE THAT $ 20 MILLION ALLOTTED<br />
TO BUILDING PROJECTS FOR SCHOOLS FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND NEARLY<br />
$ 9 MILLION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND RETRAINING OF TEACHERS OF THESE<br />
CHILDREN. IT IS TRUE THAT $ 16 MILLION IS ALLOTTED TO PRIMARY<br />
SCHOOL LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE RECEIVED NO DIRECT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
SUPPORT IN THE PAST AND MORE THAN $ 17 MILLION IS ALLOCATED TO<br />
SECONDARY LIBRARIES. SURELY NO ONE WOULD DISPUTE THE SPECIAL NEEDS<br />
I N THESE AREAS; SURELY NO ONE WOULD CRITICISE A GOVERNMENT FOR<br />
A DETERMINATION TO MEET THESE NEEDS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THIS SPECIFIC<br />
GRANT, IT IS ABSURD TO TALK ABOUT RIGIDITY WHEN A GLANCE AT THE<br />
STATES GRANTS ( SCHOOLS) ACT SHOWS THAT THE STATES WILL RECEIVE<br />
$ 100 MILLION IN GENERAL BUILDING GRANTS AND $ 174 MILLION IN GRANTS<br />
FOR GENERAL RECURRENT EXPENDITURE FOR GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS. </p>
<p>IT IS BREATHTAKING EFFRONTERY FOR STATE LIBERAL MINISTERS,<br />
WHO SUPPORTED A LIBERAL GOVERNMENT MAKING GRANTS TO STATE SCHOOLS<br />
AT THE RATE OF $ 32 MILLION A YEAR WITHOUT A COMPLAINT, TO SUGGEST<br />
INDIFFERENCE ON THE PART OF AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WHOSE GRANTS<br />
TO STATE SCHOOLS REPRESENTS SOMETHING LIKE A EIGHT-FOLD INCREASE<br />
CRITICAL WORDS ARE ONE THING; ACTIONS ARE ANOTHER. THE<br />
MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, MR BEAZLEY, HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY CONCERNED<br />
TO ENSURE THAT EDUCATION AUTHORITIES IMPLEMENT THE " NEEDS" POLICY<br />
WITH INTEGRITY. HE HAS BEEN INFORMED HE HOPES INCORRECTLY<br />
THAT ONE STATE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, IN HIS ALLOCATION OF THE<br />
EXTRA MONEY PROVIDED FOR DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS, IS OFFERING A MERE<br />
$ 2,000 EACH TO THE PRINCIPALS OF A VAST RANGE OF SCHOOLSo INCLUDING<br />
A NUMBER WHICH ARE CLEARLY DISADVANTAGED. HE HAS ALSO BEEN<br />
INFORMED AGAIN HE HOPES INCORRECTLY THAT THIS MINISTER IS<br />
IDENTIFYING AS DISADVANTAGED SOME ALREADY EXCELLENT HIGH SCHOOLS,<br />
INCLUDING ONE WHICH, IN THE CONSTITUENCY OF A FORMER MINISTER<br />
FOR EDUCATION OF THE STATE, WAS A RECIPIENT OF SPECIAL ADVANTAGES<br />
IN THE PAST. WE WANT FROM EDUCATION AUTHORITIES A CLEAR STATEMENT<br />
ON THEIR CRITERIA OF DISADVANTAGE AND A CLEAR CONCENTRATION OF<br />
THE DISADVANTAGED EXPENDITURE ON SLUM SCHOOLS TO BRING THEM UP TO<br />
STANDARD. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
BEFORE I LEAVE THE SUBJECT OF EDUCATION, I WOULD LIKE TO<br />
MENTION ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR CHILDREN<br />
WHO HAVE TOO OFTEN SUFFERED NEGLECT IN THE PAST. I HAVE ALREADY<br />
MENTIONED OUR ALLOCATION FOR BUILDING PROJECTS FOR SCHOOLS FOR<br />
THE HANDICAPPED. IN THE LAST FORTNIGHT, THE CABINET HAS DECIDED<br />
TO APPROPRIATE A FURTHER $ 1 MILLION FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION APPLIED<br />
SPECIFICALLY FOR RESEARCH AND FOR THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS OF<br />
HANDICAPPED CHILDREN. ULTIMATELY THIS WILL PRODUCE " THE TEACHERS<br />
OF THE TEACHERS" OF THE HANDICAPPED AND THIS IS A CONCOMITANT OF<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS OF ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS FOR THE<br />
HANDICAPPED. I WOULD ALSO STRESS THAT THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION IS<br />
OBLIGED TO HAVE REGARD TO " THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF HANDICAPPED<br />
CHILDREN AND HANDICAPPED YOUNG PERSONS.<br />
AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM OF PERSONAL FORTUNE, THE<br />
SCHOOLS COMMISSION IS CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHARTING<br />
COURSES OF ACTION WHICH WILL PROVIDE " SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY IN<br />
A PARTICULAR FIELD OF STUDIES, INCLUDING SCIENTIFIC, LITERARY,<br />
ARTISTIC OR MUSICAL STUDIES." THE SCHOLARSHIP SCHEMES OF AUSTRALIA<br />
HAVE OFTEN AWARDED MONEY BUT NOT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GENIUS OR TALENT<br />
IN SUCH AREAS TO PROCEED AT THE PACE OF THAT GENIUS AND TALENT AND THIS<br />
IS ONE OF THE MOST BAFFLING BUT FASCINATING PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION.<br />
IT REACHED ITS EXTREME IN A PRODIGY WHO, IN THE UNITED STATES, COULD<br />
LECTURE IN MATHEMATICS AT A UNIVERSITY AT THE AGE OF SEVEN, BUT WHO<br />
ALSO BELIEVED IN FATHER CHRISTMAS. THIS MAY HELP TO REMIND US THAT<br />
INTELLECTUAL BRILLIANCE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN SOCIAL MATURITY<br />
AND THAT SUCH A CHILD IS IN NEED OF SPECIAL ATTENTION. .1/ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
EQUALITY AND EQUITY HAVE BEEN JUST AS MUCH THE PRINCIPAL<br />
FORCES BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT's POLICIES FOR THE PROVISION OF HEALTH<br />
SERVICES IN AUSTRALIA. OUR HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM IS PROOF<br />
ENOUGH OF THIS, AND I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT SHORTLY. As<br />
MUCH PROOF CAN BE FOUND IN THE WORK OF THE HOSPITALS AND-HEALTH<br />
SERVICES COMMISSION WHICH WE ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR. FOR TOO LONG*<br />
THE SITING OF HOSPITALS HAS IGNORED-THE POPULATI* ON TRENDS OF OUR<br />
COUNTRY. FOR TOO LONG PEOPLE IN OUTER URBAN AREAS HAVE HAD TO PUT<br />
UP WITH TRAVELLING MILES TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE HOSPITAL TREATMENT.<br />
FOR TOO LONG NEWLY-DEVELOPED AREAS HAVE HAD TO SUFFER A SHORTAGE<br />
OF DOCTORS. MY COLLEAGUE MAX OLDMEADOW HAS TOLD ME OF. ONE AREA IN<br />
HIS ELECTORATE WITH 18,000 PEOPLE AND ONLY TWO FULL-TIME GENERAL<br />
PRACTITIONERS. THROUGH THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION WE<br />
ARE DETERMINED TO OVERCOME THIS GROTESQUELY UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF<br />
SUCH ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING<br />
HOSPITAL NEEDS AND WILL PRESENT A REPORT AS A BASIS FOR GOVERNMENT<br />
ACTION IN APRIL. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INTRODUCED A MAJOR PROGRAM<br />
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES, WHICH, AMONG<br />
OTHER THINGS,-WILL MAKE AVAILABLE DOCTORS IN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE<br />
CURRENTLY IN SHORT SUPPLY. IN VICTORI A WE EXPECT TO SPEND<br />
$ 4.2 MILLION IN 1973/ 74 ON SUCH COMMUNITY HEALTH FACILITIES. PART<br />
OF OUR PROGRAM IS TO ASSIST THE STATES TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL<br />
HEALTH, ALCHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCY SERVICES. THE ALLOCATION<br />
OF MORE THAN $ 77,000 FOR THE JANEFIELD FAMILY ASSESSMENT UNIT AT<br />
BUNDOORA A CENTRE WHERE WHOLE FAMILIES CAN BE BROUGHT FOR THE<br />
ASSESSMENT OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL DEFICIENCIES IS A<br />
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS PROGRAM IN ACTION IN THE EASTERN SUBURBS OF<br />
MELBOURNE. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
ANOTHER IS THE PROVISION OF NEARLY $ 80,000 FOR THE DANDENONG<br />
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTRE AND TEACHING UNIT IN CONJUNCTION<br />
WITH MONASH UNIVERSITY.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS . ALSO RECOGNISED THE NEED FOR GREATLY<br />
EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY. WE INCREASED<br />
PENSIONS TWICE LAST YEAR AND WILL LIFT THEM AGAIN IN THE AUTUMN.<br />
WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE ABOLITION OF THE MEANS<br />
TEST. WE HAVE INTRODUCED A NUMBER OF NEW BENEFITS AND IMPROVED<br />
A NUMBER OF EXISTING ONES. THESE RANGE FROM INCREASES IN SUBSIDIES<br />
FOR AGED PERSONS HOMES TO GREATER ENCOURAGEMENT FOR HOME CARE<br />
SERVICES; FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF A SUPPORTING MOTHERS BENEFIT<br />
TO THE PROVISION OF AN ORPHAN'IS PENSION. ONE OF OUR MOST AMBITIOUS<br />
PROJECTS IS TO DEVISE AN AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN TO ENABLE LOCAL<br />
AUTHORITIES AND VOLUNTARY AGENCIES TO SHARE THE COST OF A WIDER<br />
RANGE OF WELFARE SERVICES. THE FIRST GRANTS UNDER THE NEW PLAN<br />
AFFECTING VICTORIA WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY<br />
IN OCTOBER. INITIALLY THE GRANTS ARE FOR SETTING UP SECRETARIATS<br />
FOR SOCIAL PLANNING WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
OF REGIONAL COUNCILS FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. OF THE SIX INITIAL<br />
GRANTS, WHICH TOTALLED $ 91,000, A GRANT OF $ 10,000 A YEAR HAS<br />
BEEN MADE TO THE MELBOURNE/ OUTER EASTERN SUBURBS INTERIM COMMITTEE.<br />
IMENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION AND<br />
INADEQUACY OF HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR MAJOR CITIES. THIS IS ONLY ONE<br />
ASPECT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT OUR HUGE URBAN AREAS-FACE. IT IS ONLY<br />
ONE ASPECT OF PROGRAMS WHICH WE HAVE INITIATED TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMSe 289/ 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A LONG-RANGE PROGRAM TO MAKE AUSTRALIAN<br />
CITIES -EXISTING ONES AND NEW ONES AND THEIR SUBURBS MORE<br />
EFFICIENT, MORE ORDERLY AND MORE BEAUTIFUL. THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS CREATED LESS THAN THREE WEEKS<br />
AFTER WE CAME INTO OFFICE AS THE MAJOR POLICY ARM OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IN URBAN AFFAIRS. THE CITIES COMMISSION WAS SET UP TO<br />
PROVIDE TOWN PLANNING AND OTHER PRACTICAL SKILLS FOR DEVELOPING<br />
EXISTING CITIES AND PLANNING NEW GROWTH CENTRES. THE FIRST FRUITS<br />
OF THESE MEASURES HAVE COME WITH THE PLANNING OF A MAJOR CENTRE<br />
IN ALBURY-WODONGA. THIS AND OTHER FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS ARE AIMED AT<br />
RELIEVING OUR EXISTING CITIES, PARTICULARLY MELBOURNE AND SYDNEYJ*<br />
OF THE UNBEARABLE STRAINS CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE DEVELOPMENT.<br />
IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED<br />
A SCHEME TO IMPROVE URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN THE CAPITAL CITIES.<br />
ISAID IN MY POLICY SPEECH THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT " MUST NOW<br />
ACCEPT A SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEMS<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN CITIES." THE SCHEME WE ANNOUNCED MORE THAN LIVES UP<br />
TO THAT PLEDGE. IT IS BASED ON THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
CONTRIBUTING TWO-THIRDS OF THE COST OF IMPROVING URBAN PUBLIC<br />
TRANSPORT AND LEAVING ONLY ONE-THIRD OF THE COST TO THE STATES.<br />
SUGGESTED PROJECTS FOR A FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY<br />
THE STATE GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING VICTORIA. WHILE MOST OF THESE<br />
PROPOSALS ARE BEING EVALUATED, WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO PROVIDE<br />
$ 4.32 MILLION IN 1973/ 74 TO PROVIDE NEW TRAINS, TRAMS AND BUSES<br />
IN THIS STATE. </p>
<p>WE ARE THE FIRST GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNISE THAT ONE OF<br />
THE MOST APPALLING EFFECTS OF THE RAPID GROWTH OF OUR CITIES HAS<br />
BEEN THE INADEQUACY OF SEWERAGE SERVICES IN NEW SUBURBS. WE ARE<br />
THE FIRST NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO ACCEPT A DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY<br />
FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE BUDGET PROVIDED FOR AN ADVANCE OF.<br />
MILLION TO HELP CATCH UP ON THE BACKLOG OF SEWERAGE. THIS<br />
INCLUDES $ 9.3 MILLION FOR VICTORIA.' THE MELBOURNE AND METROPOLITAN<br />
BOARD OF WORKS HAS ADVISED , US THAT $ 7.3 fvILLION OF THIS IS EXPECTED<br />
TO BE ALLOCATED FOR MAJOR AND MINOR SEWERAGE WORKS IN THE EASTERN<br />
SUBURBS OF MELBOURNE IN 1973/ 74. A LONG-TERM NATIONAL SEWERAGE<br />
PROGRAM IS AT PRESENT UNDERGOING DETAILED NEGOTIATION. BETWEEN<br />
THE VARIOUS STATE AND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THE PROGRAM<br />
TO BE DEVELOPED IN VICTORIA IS EXPECTED TO ELIMINATE THE SEWERAGE<br />
BACKLOG IN MAJOR URBAN AREAS BY 1982.<br />
OUR'CITIES HAVE ALSO SUFFERED MIGHTILY FROM THE SHORTAGE<br />
OF HOUSING. AGAIN WE HAVE MOVED TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. THE<br />
TOTAL AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PROVISION FOR HOUSING HAS GONE UP BY<br />
34 PER CENT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR FROM $ 370 MILLION TO $ 495 MILLION.<br />
ADVANCES TO THE STATES INCREASED By 29 PER CENT TO $ 219 MILLION;<br />
VICTORIA RECEIVED $ 53.5 MILLION, COMPARED TO ONLY $ 39 MILLION IN<br />
THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR. VICTORIA IS ADVANCED $ 16 MILLION IN<br />
THE AGREEMENT UNDER THE HOME BUILDERS' ACCOUNT, WHICH IS USED FOR<br />
TERMINATING BUILDING SOCIETY LOANS; THIS IS NEARLY $ 5 MILLION MORE<br />
THAN IN THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR, AND WILL BE SPENT FOR HOMES<br />
FOR SALE, NOT FOR RENTAL, AS STATE AUTHORITIES HAVE TRIED TO CLAIM. ./ 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY ADVANCE FOR USE IN BUILDING HOUSING COMMISSION<br />
HOMES FOR RENTAL AND PURCHASE ROSE IN 1973/ 74 TO $ 37.5 MILLION, AN<br />
INCREASE OF NEARLY $ 10 MILLION ON THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
I WOULD EMPHASISE THAT THESE LARGE INCREASES WERE THE AMOUNTS THE<br />
VICTORIAN STATE GOVERNMENT-SOUGHT, LIMITED ONLY BY THE CAPACITY<br />
OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY.<br />
THESE GENEROUS ADVANCES WILL ENABLE VICTORIA* TO BUILD<br />
3.000 HOUSING COMMISSION DWELLINGS THIS FINANCIAL YEAR A MAJOR<br />
IMPROVEMENT ON THE NUMBERS BUILT WITH MONEY HANDED OUT BY OUR<br />
PREDECESSORS. THE GREAT BULK OF THIS MONEY IS PROVIDED AT THE<br />
HIGHLY CONCESSIONAL INTEREST RATE OF FOUR PER CENT FOR THE FIVE<br />
YEARS OF THE AGREEMENT SURELY A SIGNIFICANT FIGURE WHEN THE BOND<br />
RATE IS AROUND 8.5 PER CENT. THE HOME BUILDERS' ACCOUNT FUNDS<br />
ALLOCATED TO EACH STATE WILL BE LOANED OUT TO HOMESEEKERS AT<br />
INTEREST RATES NOT EXCEEDING FIVE AND THREE-QUARTER PER CENT.<br />
HOUSING COMMISSION DWELLINGS ALSO MUST BE SOLD WITHIN THIS INTEREST<br />
RATE LIMIT, SO IT CAN BE READILY SEEN THAT THE NEW AGREEMENT GIVES<br />
SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AID TO THOSE WHO HAVE TO BUY THEIR HOMES<br />
WITHIN THE PUBLIC HOUSING SECTOR.<br />
WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT STEPS IN THE HOUSING<br />
FIELD. WE ARE WORKING ON A UNIFORM BUILDING REGULATIONS CODE WHICH<br />
MAY EVENTUALLY REDUCE HOUSING COSTS BY AS MUCH AS SIX PER CENT.<br />
A TASK FORCE INVESTIGATING SYSTEMS OF FACTORY PRODUCED HOUSING HAS<br />
ALREADY PRODUCED AN INTERIM REPORT, AND IT MAY PROVE POSSIBLE TO<br />
ACHIEVE SAVINGS AS HIGH As 20 PER CENT FOR A COTTAGE IF THESE NEW<br />
HOUSING TECHNIQUES CAN EFFECTIVELY BE UTILISED IN THE FUTURE. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
THE SCOPE OF THE DEFENCE SERVICES HOMES SCHEME HAS BEEN GREATLY<br />
WIDENED, AND THE MAXIMUM LOAN LIMIT RAISED FROM $ 9,000 TO $ 12,000.<br />
SPENDING ON DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES THIS FINANCIAL YEAR HAS INCREASED<br />
BY 37 PER CENT TO $ 102 MILLION, ABORIGINAL HOUSING ALLOCATIONS HAVE<br />
INCREASED THIS FINANCIAL YEAR" BY 123 PER CENT TO $ 32,4 MILLION,<br />
WE ARE PHASING OUT THE INEQUITABLE HOME SAVINGS GRANT SCHEMEI AND<br />
THIS SESSION OF PARLIAMENT WILL SEE THE INTRODUCTION OF A MUCH<br />
FAIRER AND WIDER SCHEME OF LIMITED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY ON MORTGAGE<br />
INTEREST, WE CONCEDE THAT AUSTRALIA FACES AN AWESOME PROBLEM IN<br />
OVERCOMING OUR ENDEMIC HOUSING CRISIS; BUT THIS GOVERNMENT IS<br />
EVOLVING POLICIES DESIGNED TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM FROM MANY SIDES,<br />
A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IS ALREADY OCCURRING IN THE WELFARE<br />
HOUSING FIELD, AND OUR EFFORTS IN THE OTHER SECTORS WILL SOON SHOW<br />
SIMILAR GAINS, kSPITE ALL WE ARE DOING IN THESE AREAS, WE WILL NOT BE<br />
ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF OUR CITIES AND OTHER PROBLEMS AS<br />
EFFECTIVELY AS WE MUST, IF WE DO NOT ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO<br />
ASSUME A GREATER ROLE IN AUSTRALIA, LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THE ORGAN OF<br />
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE, WHICH KNOWS BEST THEIR<br />
DETAILED NEEDS AND WHICH CAN BE MOST RESPONSIVE TO THOSE NEEDS,<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA FOR TOO LONG HAS BEEN DENIED A PROPER<br />
ROLE, PROPER RESPONSIBILITY AND PROPER FINANCES, IT ALSO PROVIDES<br />
A VIVID DEMONSTRATION OF INEQUALITY IN OUR SOCIETY, LONG-ESTABLISHED<br />
AREAS BENEFIT FROM SERVICES WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER DECADES,<br />
NEWLY-ESTABLISHED AREAS SUFFER FROM THE FACT THAT LOCAL COUNCILS<br />
CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROVISION OF<br />
ESSENTIAL SERVICES, / 13 </p>
<p>./ 14<br />
-13-<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ENABLE LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT TO PLAY A FULL AND PROPER ROLE IN THE AFFAIRS OF OUR<br />
NATION, LAST YEAR WE TOOK A MAJOR STEP IN THIS DIRECTION BY<br />
BRINGING IN THE GRANTS COMMISSION ACT. THIS RECONSTITUTES THE<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION TO GIVE IT POWER TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO<br />
LOCAL AS WELL AS STATE GOVERNMENTS, THIS RECOGNISES THAT THERE<br />
ARE GREAT DISPARITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT AREAS WITHIN ONE STATE<br />
JUST AS THERE HAVE BEEN DISPARITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES.<br />
THE GRANTS COMMISSION IS NOW ABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO REDUCE THESE<br />
REGIONAL DISPARITIES, IN THE LAST FORTNIGHT IT BEGAN ITS FIRST<br />
HEARINGS UNDER THE NEW ACT. IT HEARD AN APPLICATION FROM COUNCILS<br />
IN REGION 16 OF VICTORIA FOR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO OVERCOME THE<br />
BACKLOG OF SERVICES IN THAT REGION, REGION 16 COVERS SOME OF<br />
THE EASTERN SUBURBS OF MELBOURNEI INCLUDING PART OF THIS ELECTORATE<br />
OF CASEY. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY HEARINGS WHICH I TRUST<br />
WILL RESULT IN A PROPER MEASURE OF COMMONWEALTH AID FOR AREAS,<br />
PARTICULARLY NEWLY-DEVELOPED AREAS, WHICH ARE INADEQUATELY<br />
SERVICED AT PRESENT,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR TRIED TO PERSUADE THE<br />
STATES TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT DIRECT ACCESS TO THE LOAN COUNCIL.<br />
THE STATES REFUSED TO AGREE TO THIS PROPOSAL AND SO DEPRIVED, AT<br />
LEAST TEMPORARILY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE<br />
SURE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FUNDS, MY GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO ACCEPT<br />
THE ATTITUDE OF THE STATES ON THIS QUESTION AND WE WILL TAKE THIS<br />
MATTER TO THE PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM TO BE CONDUCTED IN CONJUNCTION<br />
WITH THE SENATE ELECTIONS THIS YEAR, </p>
<p>-14-<br />
THIS LEADS ME TO THE QUESTION OF THE SENATE. I HAVE<br />
OUTLINED TO YOU TONIGHT THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE GUIDED THE<br />
POLICIES WHICH WE HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS.<br />
IN 1972 WE WON A MANDATE FOR'THOSE POLICIES AND AN ENDORSEMENT OF<br />
THOSE PRINCIPLES. YET CONTINUALLY IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS MEN<br />
WHO WERE ELECTED TO THE SENATE AS LONG AGO AS 1967 AND 1970 HAVE<br />
TRIED TO THWART THOSE POLICIES AND PERVERT THOSE PRINCIPLES.<br />
WHERE IS THEIR MANDATE FOR THE 1970' s? THEY DO NOT HAVE ONE.<br />
YET LOOK AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS., LAST YEAR<br />
THE SENATE REJECTED 13 BILLS, DEFERRED ANOTHER 10 AND. AMENDED 21.<br />
I HAVE MENTIONED IN PASSING OUR HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, A PROGRAM<br />
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST THE COST OF<br />
ILLNESS FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS,-INCLUDING THE ONE AND A HALF MILLION<br />
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SUCH PROTECTION AT PRESENT; A PROGRAM DESIGNED<br />
TO PROVIDE THAT PROTECTION BY THE FAIREST METHOD OF CONTRIBUTION.<br />
THIS WAS. PROBABLY THE MOST THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED POLICY PROPOSED<br />
BY THE LABOR PARTY WHILE IT WAS IN OPPOSITION. ITS POPULAR<br />
ACCEPTANCE PLAYED A LARGE PART IN THE GREAT LIFT IN OUR ELECTORAL<br />
FORTUNES IN 1969 AND THE FULFILMENT OF THOSE FORTUNES IN 1972.<br />
YET THESE MEN, ELECTED AS MUCH AS SIX YEARS AGO, HAVE REJECTED OUR<br />
LEGISLATION FOR THAT PROGRAM; THEY HAVE REJECTED THE PRINCIPLES<br />
OF EQUITY AND UNIVERSALITY WHICH ARE ITS CORNERSTONES. </p>
<p>IN THE FACE OF OUR MANDATE* THEY HAVE SHELVED THE TRADE<br />
PRACTICES BILL AND, IN SO DOING, THEY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO<br />
MONOPOLIES AND BIG CORPORATIONS TO FIX PRICES, ORGANISE CARTELS<br />
AND EXPLOIT THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER, AGAIN, THEY HAVE DENIED<br />
AUSTRALIANS FAIRNESS, THEY.-HAVE SHELVED THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BILL AND THUS BLOCKED THE MOST EFFECTIVE'<br />
INSTRUMENT FOR ENSURING AUSTRALIAN CONTROL OF OUR INDUSTRIES AND<br />
FOR DEVELOPING NEW INDUSTRIES, THEY HAVE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO<br />
FOREIGN TAKEOVERS AND FOREIGN EXPLOITATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY, THESE SAME MEN HAVE REJECTED THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE<br />
OF EQUAL ELECTORATES, THESE MEN, WHO ARE SO QUICK TO COMPLAIN OF<br />
STRIKES# HAVE BLOCKED ATTEMPTS TO DEMOCRATISE AND MODERNISE THE<br />
TRADE UNION MOVEMENT, THEY HAVE PRESERVED FOR FOREIGN MINING<br />
INTERESTS THE. RIGHT TO EXPLOIT OUR OFF-SHORE RESOURCES, LIKE THE<br />
STATES, THEY HAVE SOUGHT TO DENY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DIRECT ACCESS<br />
TO NATIONAL REVENUES AND BORROWINGS,<br />
I TRUST THEIR ACTIONS WILL BE REMEMBERED WHEN THE SENATE<br />
ELECTIONS ARE HELD THIS YEAR, I TRUST THAT THE MAJORITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS WHO SUPPORTED OUR POLICIES IN 1972 WILL REMEMBER HOW SOME<br />
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE POLICIES HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY A<br />
HOSTILE AND REACTIONARY OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE,<br />
THE VOTERS OF AUSTRALIA GAVE US THE SUPPORT WE NEEDED TO<br />
INITIATE THOSE POLICIES IN 1972. I TRUST THAT IN 1974 THEY WILL<br />
GIVE US THE POWER TO ENSURE THEIR FULL IMPLEMENTATION, </p>
