EMBARGO: NOT TO HE PUBLISHED, BROADCAST OR TELECAST BEFORE<br />
7.15 P. M. ON TUESDAY, 24TH NOVEMBER.<br />
BROADCAST NO, 1 SENATE ELECTION<br />
BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, OVER ABC NATIONAL STATIONS<br />
IN ALL STATES AT 7,15 P. M. ON TUESDAY,<br />
24TH NOVEMBER, 1964<br />
The primary issue in this Senate Election is whether<br />
you want to reverse your decision of December last.<br />
Now why should you? You agreed with us that Labour,<br />
divided, and under the growing influence of the Left Wing,<br />
is not to be trusted to maintain sturdy foreign policies,<br />
or to have a realistic defence policy.<br />
Why should you change your minds?<br />
Take our domestic policy, from development to<br />
education to housing. We have just concluded the most<br />
active and productive Session in the history of the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament. Many our soecial policy promises<br />
have already been performed or put into legislative form<br />
so that they may operate next year. Prosperity is high.<br />
Wages are at record levels, The national income has grown.<br />
Unemployment has disdppeared<br />
You elected us to carry out a three-years policy,<br />
Why should you now defeat your own choice?<br />
True, Labour does not like our provision for science<br />
teaching and scholarships in secondary schools, without<br />
discrimination between State and Church or private schools,<br />
With. a majority in the Senate, it could defeat any further<br />
legislation in this field, or disallow any Regulations.<br />
On top of all this, we now have a cleavage between<br />
the parties on the vital matter of Defence,<br />
But I should say something to you about our reasons<br />
for introducing a limited measure of compulsory selective<br />
military service in the Regular Army.<br />
Our strategic position has suffered a deterioration<br />
since the end of last year. North Vietnam has not hesitated<br />
to attack ships and forces. South Vietnam is<br />
increasingly threatened by the Communists. Indonesian<br />
attacks upon Malaysia are increasing in illegal boldness.<br />
Our own forces have been engaged in resisting them. Clearly<br />
our defence provisions must be stepped up.<br />
The present strength of the Regular Army, well<br />
trained, well equipped, and mobile, is 22,750. I e are<br />
convinced on the highest military advice, that we should<br />
increase this to 37 500, which would mean an effective force<br />
of 33,000 by the ena of 1966. Current experience of<br />
recruiting shows that these numbers just cannot be achieved<br />
in the time unless there is a compulsory call-up.<br />
We have adopted this policy in the interests of the<br />
national security, You will take your own way of expressing<br />
your own opinions about it, You would have had a poor<br />
opinion of us if we had delayed the announcement until after<br />
the Senate Election. We thought you ought to know right away.<br />
Without this now policy the defence of Australia would be<br />
inadequate. This, in a period of great risk, would be a grave<br />
breach of Government duty, </p>
