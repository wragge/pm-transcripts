Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett today announced joint Commonwealth-Tasmanian Government assistance for primary producers and small businesses in Northern Tasmania affected by flooding.</p>
<p>The Gillard and Bartlett Governments have activated a package of one-off âCategory C Grantsâ  -  worth up to $25,000 - under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRAA). The grants will be funded on a 50/50 basis.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister responded to a request yesterday from Premier Bartlett for Commonwealth additional assistance.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the grants would help producers, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations affected by the floods get back to business as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government is working with the Bartlett Government to support Tasmanian communities as the recovery process continues from the flooding that inundated communities in northern Tasmania earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General Robert McClelland and the Member for Braddon Sid Sidebottom were on the ground in flood-affected areas in Northern Tasmania just yesterday to witness the effect this flooding has had on farmers and small businesses.</p>
<p>Category C assistance will:</p>
<p> * 	Help primary producers with general clean up costs including the removal of debris and dead livestock, purchase of fodder and replacement trading stock and repairs to damaged equipment  and property access  -  without which production and viability could be disrupted beyond the next season; and</p>
<p> * 	Help small businesses affected by flooding to conduct repairs and resume trading as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Today's announcement is in addition to joint Federal-Tasmanian Government assistance available under NDRRA to restore critical public infrastructure  -  such as roads and bridges  -  once certain thresholds are met.</p>
<p>Premier David Bartlett said the additional Commonwealth and State assistance will be welcomed by farmers who are in need of help.</p>
<p>âOur primary producers play a vital role in Tasmania's economy. The Tasmanian Government is pleased to be able to help them recover from the recent flood damage,â Mr Bartlett said.</p>
<p>âI want to thank the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Government for responding so quickly to our request. Our thanks also go to the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, which has worked hard to assess the flood damage with us,â he said.</p>
<p>Category C assistance does not compensate for income losses and is not intended to replace insurance. It does not cover damage to dwellings, damages covered by insurance and cost of using own labour, existing staff or own equipment.</p>
<p>Application forms are available at Service Tasmania shops from Monday 24 January, or by calling 1300 135513, or at <a href="http://www.dpipwe.tas.gov.au">www.dpipwe.tas.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>Applications for assistance must be lodged to Service Tasmania shops by Thursday 30 June, 2011.</p>
<p>For primary producers, applications can also be addressed to:</p>
<p>Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment</p>
<p>GPO Box 44</p>
<p>Hobart, TAS, 7001</p>
