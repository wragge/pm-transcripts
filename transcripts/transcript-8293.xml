PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST, n.. 1JVER EMBARGOED UNTIL DELI1VERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKERS' HERITAGE CENTRE<br />
BARCALDINE, 4 MAY 1991<br />
Over the past few weeks, I have had the honour, as National<br />
Leader of the Aus tralian Labor Party, to speak on several<br />
occasions through Australia to mark the centenary of this<br />
great Party c-f ours.<br />
No Party, no Movement, no Australian institution as<br />
important, as diverse, as enduring as ours, could owe its<br />
origins to a single event in a single State at a single<br />
point in time.<br />
Our Party sprang up, almost simultaneously, in different<br />
places across this vast continent in 1891.<br />
So no single place can claim to be the birthplace of the<br />
Australian Labor Party.<br />
But if there is a single event and a single place that<br />
brings together all the themes, the spirit, and the meaning<br />
of the events which, together, led to the creation of the<br />
ALP, it is here in the central west of Queensland, here in<br />
Barcaldine. The event itself, the event we commemorate and celebrate<br />
today, can be briefly described.<br />
For sixteen weeks, from March to June 1891, 5,000 shearers<br />
were encamped here as were several thousand others in<br />
camps at Longreach, Charleville and other camps in Western<br />
Queensland. It was one of the greatest shows of_ solidarity<br />
in Australian industrial history.<br />
They were all members of the S hearers' Union, the forerunner<br />
of the Australian Workers' Union. They were striking for a<br />
simple cause, a fundamental principle the right to<br />
organise, the right to exist as a union.<br />
That was the cause; that was the principle at stake. </p>
<p>Now, the Queensland colonial government of the time a<br />
so-called liberal government led by Sir Samuel Griffith<br />
determined to break the Shearers' Union once and for all,<br />
and to bring the full power of the state to bear, in order<br />
to do so.<br />
So, 300 armed police and a detachment of the Moreton Bay<br />
Regiment were despatched from Brisbane to arrest the union<br />
leaders and clear out the camps.<br />
The threat of a bloodbath was real. It was that grim<br />
prospect which inspired Henry Lawson's famous lines:<br />
They needn't say the fault is ours<br />
If blood should stain the wattle.<br />
But with tremendous self-discipline and just as important,<br />
with the support and solidarity of the people of Barcaldine,<br />
not least the women of Barcaldine the shearers refused to<br />
be provoked.<br />
Here, where we stand, they were rounded up and many were<br />
left manacled in the open for several days. Twelve of the<br />
union leaders were taken by train to Rockhampton, charged<br />
with conspiracy and sentenced to three years imprisonment.<br />
On 20 June 1891, its resources exhausted, the Shearers'<br />
Union declared the strike at an end.<br />
But it was not the end.<br />
It was a new beginning.<br />
Just as the Unions in New South Wales redoubled their<br />
efforts to form a political Labor Party after the collapse<br />
of the Great Strike of 1890, so the organised workers of<br />
Queensland learnt that strike action was not enough, that<br />
solidarity was not enough, if all the powers of the state<br />
were left, uncontested, unchallenged, in the hands of<br />
labour's adversaries.<br />
This was the lesson learnt here here in Barcaldine, under<br />
the Tree of Knowledge, as they called it.<br />
And in all of the 100 years of our party's history so far,<br />
for all the tremendous changes we have undergone, there has<br />
never been a more important decision than the decision the<br />
unionists of Queensland made as a result of what happened<br />
here. It was a simple decision based upon simple facts. They<br />
recognised that the only way to protect their rights, to<br />
advance their cause, to get better working conditions, to<br />
raise living standards for themselves and their families,<br />
was through action in Parliament not through the weapon of<br />
the strike but through the challenge of the ballot box. </p>
<p>And that meant first, getting enough members into Parliament<br />
to wring concessions from the established conservative<br />
parties the tories then and the tories today and second,<br />
to win a majority in Parliament and form Labor Governments<br />
in our right.<br />
The representatives of the men who fought and lost the<br />
struggle here in June took a leading part, with their fellow<br />
unionists from all over Queensland, in the work of forming<br />
the People's Parliamentary Association in Brisbane in July<br />
1891.<br />
And thus arose, from the ashes of defeat, the Queensland<br />
Branch of the great Australian Labor Party.<br />
The lessons we can draw from this splendid story are as<br />
valid and relevant today, as ever.<br />
First, there is the lesson of that fundamental commitment to<br />
Parliament.<br />
And let this never be forgotten:<br />
Australia today is one of the world's great Parliamentary<br />
democracies. The commitment and determination of the<br />
Australian Labor Party has helped to make it so.<br />
And no one understands this better than the people of<br />
Queensland. In this State, for more than 30 years, the people of<br />
Queensland saw their parliamentary democracy distorted and<br />
virtually sto: Len from them.<br />
It is only because of the perseverance and renewed strength<br />
of the Labor Party, under the leadership of Wayne Goss, that<br />
true parliamentary democracy has been at last restored to<br />
Queensland. The second enduring lesson learned from 1891 concerns the<br />
vital link between industrial Labor and political Labor.<br />
The strength of one remains the strength of the other.<br />
It is true that all Labor Governments have an overriding<br />
responsibility to the people as a whole. We can never<br />
succeed if we are merely a sectional party or a sectional<br />
government. Yet it is equally true that cooperation and a common sense<br />
of purpose, bEtween the union movement and Labor<br />
Governments, remain crucial to the success of both.<br />
And I am deeply proud of the fact that, 100 years after the<br />
unions created. the Labor Party, that constructive<br />
cooperation has never been closer than it is today. </p>
<p>And the third lesson of 1891 lies in the very fact of the<br />
defeat itself. It is a lesson for our adversaries as much<br />
as for ourselves.<br />
This party, this movement, could never have survived for a<br />
century unless we had learnt the hard lessons of adversity.<br />
In January 1970 my first year as President of the ACTU<br />
there was not a single Labor Government anywhere in<br />
Australia. Our only significant centre of power for most of that year<br />
was the Brisbane City Council.<br />
Now, we are back there again, and above all, we have this<br />
great Labor Government in Queensland.<br />
The Labor men and women of Queensland know what it is to go<br />
through difficult times. Our opponents, and the self<br />
appointed pundits and doomsayers, have to learn this about<br />
the Australian Labor Party: we know how to fight, and we<br />
know how to fight back.<br />
We learnt that 100 years ago, in struggles like the one we<br />
commemorate here today, from men and women whose courage we<br />
celebrate today, and whose inspiration we honour.<br />
Now, the Labor pioneers of Barcaldine are part of our<br />
heritage. Not just the workers' heritage. Not just the heritage of<br />
the Labor Party. They are a proud part of the heritage of<br />
Australia and the Australian people.<br />
And it is in that spirit, that I declare open Stage One of<br />
the Australian Workers' Heritage Centre. I congratulate<br />
most heartily the Tree of Knowledge Development Committee,<br />
its supporters, donors and patrons on their work and their<br />
vision. On behalf of the people of Queensland and the<br />
people of Australia, I dedicate this Centre to the honoured<br />
memory of the Labor men and women of 1891, and to the great<br />
cause they have handed down to us, the cause which we have<br />
the privilege of advancing into the next century. </p>
