PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE IRISH BICENTENNIAL GIFT<br />
CANBERRA -12 JULY 1988<br />
Taoiseach and Mrs Haughey,<br />
Ladles and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure on behalf of all Australians to<br />
welcome to Canberra our very good friends, Charles and<br />
Maureen Haughey.<br />
Charles Haughey is the leader not just of a nation with<br />
which Australia has a warm and valuable relationship but<br />
also of a people, a free people, with whom Australians have<br />
the deepest ties of kinship and of history.<br />
I have the added pleasure, since my visit to Ireland last<br />
year, of welcoming Charles Haughey as a personal friend.<br />
That gives me the responsibility, as his host over the next<br />
couple of days, of endeavouring to repay in Australia the<br />
hospitality extended to me on that visit to Ireland. That's<br />
an awesome responsibility but one which I look forward to<br />
meeting.<br />
At the start of your visit, Taoiseach, let me say simply<br />
that we welcome you and your wife to Australia as some of<br />
our closest friends.<br />
I know all Australians would want you to think of Australia<br />
as your second home.<br />
Taoiseach, You come to Australia in its Bicentennial year. This is a<br />
time when we are recalling the more than 40,000 years during<br />
which the Aboriginal people occupied and cared for this<br />
land. And we are celebrating too, the achievements of the<br />
past two hundred years since the arrival of the First Fleet.<br />
They have been two centuries in which the Irish people have<br />
played a prominent and distinguished part.<br />
Just over two hundred years ago, a small party of prisoners<br />
and prison guards set off from the British Isles to<br />
establish in Australia what was planned as merely an<br />
extension of the overcrowded British prison system. 299 </p>
<p>But when they arrived at Port Jackson, the First Fleet<br />
pioneers found not a prison compound, but a wide continent.<br />
And they founded not a jail but a nation.<br />
Two hundred years later, Australians are proud of the way<br />
that nation has grown and prospered, and are determined to<br />
protect and enhance the heritage we have received a<br />
heritage of peace, independence, liberty, prosperity,<br />
egalitarianism. That heritage is the result of the commitment and vision of<br />
many people from many lands.<br />
But it is particularly appropriate that our Bicentennial<br />
should see this visit to Australia by the Irish head of<br />
Government. For Australia owes an incalculable debt to the thousands of<br />
convicts and free settlers who came from Ireland to<br />
Australia over the last two hundred years.<br />
For many of them, seeking an escape from famine and<br />
hardship, Australia offered work, food, land, gold.<br />
For many others, of course, there was no choice about making<br />
the voyage to Australia. They were exiled as a punishment<br />
for criminal acts many of which today of course appear so<br />
petty or as a retribution for attempting to express<br />
through rebellion the stirrings of Irish nationalism.<br />
For all of them, the passage to Australia must have been a<br />
wild venture into the unknown.<br />
But they came in such numbers, and they carried with them in<br />
such great supply, the beauty and the passion of Irish<br />
culture, and on arrival they worked with such diligence,<br />
that before long Australia was familiar territory to the<br />
people of Ireland.<br />
Indeed, as I said in my address to the Dail, Ireland is the<br />
most anti-imperialist of nations. But it does hold sway<br />
over a great spiritual empire, an empire won not by force of<br />
arms but by force of Irish character. And Australia is<br />
proud to be one of its principal provinces.<br />
It is no misrepresentation to say that, from the arrival of<br />
the First Fleet, the Irish constituted Australia's first<br />
ethnic minority. As members of a rich and tolerant<br />
multicultural society, Australians acknowledge that the long<br />
struggle of the Irish for identity, acceptance and full<br />
participation on an equal footing had a dramatic effect in<br />
strengthening our sense of, and our commitment to, justice<br />
and equality of opportunity.<br />
300 </p>
<p>Taoiseach,<br />
Given all this, it is not surprising that Ireland's<br />
contribution to the Australian bicentenary has been generous<br />
and full hearted.<br />
The Asgard II participated in the Parade of Tall Ships. The<br />
Irish Gold and Silver exhibition is currently touring<br />
Australia. A large number of other artistic and scholarly<br />
links have been initiated.<br />
But Australians today are receiving ano ' ther Irish gift<br />
this remarkable and valuable set of computerised records of<br />
some forty thousand people transported from Ireland to<br />
Australia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<br />
This gift will be of great historical value for the many<br />
scholars engaged in the work of understanding our past.<br />
But its chief beneficiaries I believe will be the many<br />
Australian men and women of Irish descent who in s eeking to<br />
discover their own family histories will find in this gift a<br />
resource of outstanding value.<br />
These convict records are to be lodged here in the National<br />
Library, where they will be available for all to use. in<br />
recognition of two hundred years of Irish presence in<br />
Australia, the Library has mounted the exhibition we are<br />
about to see.<br />
I trust you will accept my thanks, Taoiseach, on behalf of<br />
the Australian people, for the generosity of the Irish<br />
people, and the hard work of the Irish Bicentennial<br />
Committee, for this splendid gift.<br />
Taoiseach, The first play performed in Australia was George Farquhar's,<br />
The Recruiting officer. For the production in 1789, a<br />
prologue was written some say by the Irish convict George<br />
Barrington, who was transported to Australia as a<br />
pickpocket. Whoever actually wrote the prologue had a cynical view of<br />
things. He described the convicts as " true patriots all",<br />
" For, be it understood,<br />
we left our country for our country's good<br />
And none will doubt but that our emigration,<br />
Has prov'd most useful to the British nation."<br />
Perhaps it was true at the tine that the process of<br />
transporting convicts to Australia was of benefit to<br />
Britain. 801 </p>
<p>But what is certainly true today, taking the long view<br />
afforded by our Bicentenary, is that the tide of advantage<br />
has turned. It is Australia that gained most from the<br />
arrival of the convicts, including most particularly, those<br />
from Ireland. Over the years Australia has continued to<br />
derive new vigour and new skills from the steady influx of<br />
new settlers from Ireland.<br />
To correct the prologue, then, we should say the Irish left<br />
their country for Australia's good. Their emigration has<br />
proved most useful to the Australian nation.<br />
Sir, your gift of these convict records is a fitting and<br />
lasting Bicentennial gift.<br />
But the even larger and more enduring Bicentennial gift has<br />
already been given to us the great contribution of the<br />
Irish people over the last two hundred years to building our<br />
nation, forging our character and enriching our future.<br />
