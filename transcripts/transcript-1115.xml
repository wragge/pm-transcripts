YOUNG LIBERAL RALLY<br />
HA4dTHORN TOWAN HALL. , E3URNE, VIC. I 21ST MAY, 1965<br />
S pee ch by t he Prime Miitr Rt o SShL ZrRqboy etJ42sj<br />
Sir and Young Liberals: It is great fun for me to come here, It is<br />
thirty-six years ago, which is before most of the Young Liberals<br />
here were born, that I first stood for Parliament you must treat<br />
me with respect;( Laughter) I am an old and doddering follow<br />
it is thirty-six years ago, ( whistle blown) I couldn't even.<br />
whistle like that. ( Laughter) This was in the days when th<br />
Legislative Council was a distinguished body and I aspired to its<br />
membership. ( Laughter) Having been in it for thirteen months<br />
I left it quite voluntarily. But the biggest meeting I had In<br />
the whole of that campaign was in the supper room at the Hawthorn<br />
Town Hall I must tell the Mayor about that. There were fifty<br />
people there. That was the biggest meeting of fifty-six meetings<br />
I had in 1928 and the smallest meeting was four ( Laughter) at the<br />
Glen Iris Bowling Green and of the four, three were members of<br />
my committee. ( Laughter3 Now I tell you that because I think it<br />
may encourage you to realise that you may have small beginning$.<br />
You can't start off you know, completely winning. I learned a<br />
lot in the course ol that campaign.<br />
Then about two years later, I sat down in my<br />
house with two other men, and we decided that there were too many<br />
of the old brigade who were running the Parliament, we really<br />
ought to do something about it. So we started the Young<br />
Nationalist Movement. I am telling you this because I would<br />
like you to realise that I have been young myself ( Laughter) and<br />
nobody understands better how you feel than I do because we were<br />
a bit disgruntled and we said, " Vie will form the Young Nationalists."<br />
And we were terrific, tremendous. We made speeches at street<br />
corners. We received over-ripe tomatoes on our faces ( Laughter)<br />
in the vicinity of the Prahran Market; an egg or two descended<br />
on us, It was really great fun. These were spirited days.<br />
( Laughter) But because we knew what we were at, because we<br />
believed in things because we had enthusiasm just as you have,<br />
at the very next election in Victoria, we came in with very little<br />
short of half the Members on our side of Parliament belonging to<br />
the Young Nationalist Movement. That's worthwhile remembering.<br />
Because however necessary it is to have people of experience and<br />
judgment and what-have-you, it is vital for any party to be<br />
refreshed constantly by young people who come in with their own<br />
ideas, with their own fervour with their own determination to do<br />
something about the state of Lhe nation, This is, believe me,<br />
the most important thing in the world. And so whatever I talk<br />
to you about tonight, you must understand that what I really ought<br />
to do is to say I move a vote of thanks to you, and that would<br />
be eloquent in its own way.<br />
But what I really want to do is not to talk down<br />
to you as if I were educating you, as if I were patronising you<br />
because this is the last thing in the world I should ever dream<br />
of doing. I am talking to you as a veteran in politics and I<br />
am talking to you as my successors in politics. I am ialking / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
to you as people upon whom the future of our country in a<br />
political, and vastly important political sense, depends.<br />
And so I just want to talk to you about one or two matters<br />
as I would wish to talk to members of my own family, knowing<br />
that before long inevitably there will be great changes in<br />
leadership, in personnel, but that inevitably there will be<br />
a growing need for people who believe in things and who<br />
know why they believe in them and who are determined to<br />
promote them. And this Young Liberal Movement whose tie<br />
I am wearing tonight is therefore, in my opinion, the heart<br />
and soul of our side of politics and it is indeed the heart<br />
and soul of the future of the nahion.<br />
Now we have been having a good deal of discussion,<br />
a good deal of controversy ( though it is sometimes difficult'<br />
to discover exactly where somebody is in these matters),<br />
about the position of Australia internationally. There are<br />
people, some of them of eminent respectability, who keep<br />
on saying that we are all wrong, that our foreign policy,<br />
our approach to the rest of the world ought either to be<br />
one of peace at any price or in the alternative, one in<br />
which we leave the responsibilities to other people. I have<br />
had considerable controversies about this matter myself, as<br />
the older among you will remem~ ber,<br />
I had a correspondence Epistles to the Bishops<br />
( Laughter Applause) and one advantage I had over the Apostle<br />
Paul was Lhat when he wrote an Epistle to the Romans or tile<br />
Corinthians or whatever it might be, as far as I know there<br />
was no reply. ( Laughter) But I had replies. Well the<br />
problem was exhibited. I think it was clarified7 and the<br />
more I think about it, the more I realise that this business<br />
really does and must give us furiously to think: What is it<br />
we believe in what is it we stand for. Not as a section<br />
but as Australia because I beg of you, never let it be<br />
said about the Liberal Party that it speaks for anybody<br />
except Australia not for just some people, not just for a<br />
party, but for Australia. I sat down, knowing that I was<br />
coming here, and said to myself t" de11, now, this might be<br />
a good opportunity of doing a little quiet analysis, for<br />
the benefit of my younger colleagues, of our foreign policy<br />
and in particular our desires, our objectives in relation to<br />
the countries of Asia." 1<br />
Now, of course, the first one which apparently<br />
needs to be stated frequently is that we desire to live at<br />
peace with all of these countries, with mutual understanding<br />
and assistance. Now this is true. We have some reason to<br />
be irritated, in fact that is a mild understatement, with the<br />
President of Indonesia but we have continued to do everything<br />
in our power to maintain some friendly contacts with Indonesia.<br />
We have been criticised for some of them. Of course we want<br />
to live at peace. Nothing could be more terrifying for us<br />
than to think we might by erroneous judgments or foolish<br />
actions find ourselves in conflict with the whole of the<br />
people of Asia. Of course we don't want that. We don't<br />
want it for two reasons.<br />
One is that there is no future in that kind of<br />
position and the other is that there is no sense in that<br />
position. We want to live at peace. ! e want to understand<br />
our neighbours. We go to great pains to see that we do.<br />
But at the same time, Sir, our next objective is that we are<br />
to defend our own security and that of our territories -I<br />
say " territories" because, technically, that is right -and<br />
** so / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
of all these people in Papua and New Guinea for whom we have<br />
assumed, in the eyes of the world, tremendous responsibilities,<br />
I hope nobody will want to make us believe for half<br />
a minute that a defeated Australia an enslaved Australia is the<br />
kind of Australia in which we would want our grandchildren:-<br />
mine or yours or yours to have to live. This is a matter of<br />
national security preserving our integrity as a nation,<br />
preserving our own right to live our owm lives according to our<br />
own standards. Now these two things are not easily reconciled, are<br />
they? A desire to be on the best of terms with your neighbours<br />
and at the same time a resolute intention to defend the security<br />
of your own country. No reason why they shouldn't be reconcilable<br />
but for some of the events that we have been looking at recently.<br />
But we have recently been looking at events in South-East Asia<br />
which exhibit in the most practical terms the aggressive quality<br />
of world communism, and in particular the aggressive quality<br />
of Chinese communism because as the Russian communists have<br />
played it a little -more and more softly so have the Chinese<br />
communists emphasised more and more that they have no patience<br />
with peaceful co-existence, they are out for world domination.<br />
These are not just phrases. These are demonstrated<br />
in the field. India knows all about it, because India has been<br />
invaded. Tibet knew all about it because Tibet was overrun.<br />
Laos knows a great deal about it because in that country the<br />
vexations the conflicts in an attempt to create a peaceftul<br />
government have been enormous bnd have by no means finished.<br />
And of course in Vietnam we have, day by day a demonstration<br />
of the fact and these facts can hardly be denied; I have not<br />
heard them seriously denied that inside South Vietnam there<br />
are great pockets of what they call Viet Cong who are communists<br />
and who are out to overthrow the Government of South Vietnam by<br />
force, by terror, and who intend to convert South Vietnam into<br />
a communist community just like North Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh.<br />
These are the simple, painful, horrible facts and this is all a<br />
matter of communist aggression.<br />
These facts are not very well understood. I hope you<br />
will make them well understood. I have had to listen or read<br />
r'emarks from eminent people who don't seem to understand that these<br />
are the facts. It has been said to me as you may recall that<br />
it is really the fault of South Vietnam that there haven't teen<br />
free elections in Vietnam. Now I ask you free elections in<br />
VietnamJ Can you imagine a free election in a communist country?<br />
Did anybody seriously believe that there could be a free election<br />
in Ho Chi Minh's territory? And how would you like to haVe an<br />
election being organised and the ways and means worked out-: and the<br />
electoral act created if we at this very moment were having a<br />
civil war in our own country, with not a thousand or two of Viet<br />
Cong but with scores of thousands of Viet Cong grouped in centres,<br />
invading villages, masscring people all done in the closest<br />
communion with the communist power from the North. To talk in<br />
this theoretical, academic way about free elections is really to<br />
ignore all the facts of life. There can be no freedom, or free<br />
election, or effective self-government in any country which is<br />
being torn asunder by aggression from outside and insurrection<br />
from within. Therefore we, in Australia, have found ourselves<br />
compelled to face a problem which the United States of America<br />
with its immense power has also had to confrontl What can we<br />
do to preserve the freedom of our Asian friends7to help them<br />
to remain outside communist control? Now this is a problem 0 0 0 0a </p>
<p>that hasn't arisen all of a sudden. I want you all to remember<br />
that this Government which I have the honour to lead thought of<br />
all this quite a long time ago. We were one of the promoters<br />
of the South-East Asian Treaty, and the South-East Asian Treaty<br />
has been in existence ever since, and in it you have the United<br />
States, you have France ( a rather hesitating partner at present),<br />
you have Great Britain, you have Australia and New Zealand, you<br />
have Pakistan Thailand, the Philippines and that treaty which<br />
set out to establish the proposition that we wanted to protect<br />
people's freedom we wanted to draw a frontier against communist<br />
aggression in Asia has, I think, had considerable significance.<br />
Under that treaty one of the protocol countries, as it was<br />
expressed, is South Vietnam one of the countries an attack upon<br />
which the SEATO powers would regard as an attack upon them.<br />
And so the first reason why we are there if you want to be<br />
technical about this matter is that we bound ourselves by<br />
treaty to be there should the South Vietnam Government ask us<br />
to come, in just the same way as did the United States of<br />
America. All right. Well how do we offer to protect, to do<br />
what we can to protect our friends and I am talking about our<br />
Asian friends. Dontt let people get away with the idea that this<br />
is a line between the Asian people and the Australian people or<br />
the American people. It's our Asian friends, it's the people<br />
of Vietnam, it's the people of Thailand the people of Laos, the<br />
people of Malaysia these are the people in South East Asia with<br />
whose freedom we are concerned, and in order to concern ourselves,<br />
we believe we have to do this in concert with our allies and,<br />
as I have just indicated, pursuant to our treaty obligations*<br />
Now, in concert with our allies just think<br />
about what that means. Most astonishing business. I don't<br />
want to advertise it though no doubt it will be well attendedbut<br />
Sunday afternoon in the Richmond Town Hall there is to be<br />
a great meeting, a mightyprotest against the Federal Government's<br />
decision to send Australian troops to fight in Vietnam, And to<br />
my intense astonishment among the speakers are Mr, Calwell<br />
( Laughter) and of course, Dr. Cairns. ( laughter) Now I said<br />
to my intense astonishment because I don't think quite honestly<br />
Calwell and Cairns agree on this matter at all ( Laughter<br />
Applause) but with our distinguished opponents in the Ialor<br />
Party, a good deal depends on whether you are reading the first<br />
edition or the late City because things happen in between,<br />
don't they? Now, let us go back to the first edition on the 18th<br />
February of this year I repeat, of this year 18th February,<br />
the Federal Labor Party issued a statement on these matters.<br />
This was very good. The Executive had attendedi a great deal<br />
was said to and fro and I know who are the " tots" and who are<br />
the 11frots"~ ( Laughter) and then the statement came out.<br />
Could I read you three paragraphs of it, in a clear voice?<br />
( Shouts of " yes") t<br />
" In its statement to the Security Council<br />
on February 7th reporting the air strikes against<br />
military installations in the south of North Vietnam,<br />
America insisted that its object in South Vietnam,<br />
while resisting aggression, is to achieve a peacelul<br />
settlement maintained by the presence of international<br />
peace-keeping machinery and that it would not allow the<br />
situation to be changed by terror and violence, 0 0 0 </p>
<p>4 " This statement of American purposes is<br />
unexceptionable 1<br />
Mark that " unexceptionable". Although there are various<br />
interpretations of the E~ nglish language, that doesnt seem to me<br />
to be very ambiguous. " Unexceptionable". This is what was said<br />
by the people who are going to invite people Sunday afternoon<br />
at Richmond to condemn the sending of troops to Vietnam, Well<br />
let's go on. " and the case for the American action of recent<br />
days, as based on the aim of shortening the war and<br />
achieving a negotiated settlement which would establish<br />
and maintain the rights of the South Vietnamese people,<br />
deserves sympathetic Australian understanding."<br />
This is the best thing they ever said. ( Laughter)<br />
" At this moment, it seems clear that President<br />
Johnson is determined to limit the areas of American<br />
retaliation to the factors believed to be assisting<br />
the Viet Cong attacks."<br />
Isn't that right? He has said so time after time.<br />
Well, now what do they mean on Sunday by saying, " Yes,<br />
that's all right for the United States. We quite agree that the<br />
United States is justified in putting Am~ ericans in there or on the<br />
water the Navy, the Army, the Air Force. This is all right.<br />
It is quite unexceptionable that they should do that in order to<br />
help to preserve the freedom of South Vietnam and the people of<br />
South Vietnam, but ( and this is the appendix that will be produced<br />
on Sunday afternoon, let it be understood) that's good for the<br />
United States. It's not good for us. Not good for us. What we<br />
ought to be doing is to say to the United States ' Look, it's<br />
your job. You do it. We'll give you a few kind words, We'll<br />
make an agreeable speech or two, but when it comes to the business,<br />
you understand it's for you."'<br />
Well, really, I am happy to say I know the American<br />
Administration very well and I know that we enjoy some repute with<br />
them because we don't say that kind of thing, because we have made<br />
it clear right through that although we, to a very large extent,<br />
depend when it comes to the last desperate thrust on American help<br />
and American power we don't regard this as one-way traffic. I.-hen<br />
vie executed the ANHUS pact with the United States~ we didn't believe<br />
for a minute that this meant that America was to hlp us but that<br />
we were not to help America.<br />
There is a great and continuing reciprocity about<br />
international engagements. V~ e must never forget it. These are<br />
not one-sided things* You may be disposed some people may be<br />
disposed to say, " Oh, yes, but we are a small country what can<br />
we do? It's very little, and because it's very little, perhaps<br />
if we didn't do it, it wouldn't be noticed." Look, my friends,<br />
I remember the first time I ever made a speech to the American<br />
Congress. Itv been a little bit lucky or they have been<br />
unlucky because I have made about four now over the years.<br />
But the first time, I reminded them that in Lhis century, they<br />
had become the greatest power in the world and that in the<br />
nineteenth century, Great Britain was the greatest power in the<br />
world, and in the nineteenth century when Great Britain, by her<br />
command of the sea, commanded the strategic position of the<br />
world, she was an unpopular country, hardly had a friend in<br />
Europe delivered Europe from Napoleon, delivered Europe time<br />
a e / 6 </p>
<p>4 6-<br />
after time hardly a friend. In France, perfide Albionthe<br />
whole attitude of criticism of a great power, a powerful<br />
power, one that could help us. It's the old business you<br />
know, the old business. Rich relatives and poor relations.<br />
( Laughter) Not too many thanks in Pie world. And she was<br />
unpopular. I said all this to the American Congressi-ten, and<br />
I said, " In this century, you have the power and you are<br />
beginning to worry as to why people aren't more grateful to<br />
you for what you do, and you do wonderful things for the<br />
world. Forget about it. Don't think you are doing anything<br />
for public gratitude. Realise you are doing it because<br />
intrinsically it's the right thing to do, and if it comes to<br />
having a friend or two, well I now declare Australia to be<br />
your friend. ' ve are quite small but even a small friend is<br />
better than none.' ( Laughter) ( Cheers) And quite frankly,<br />
ladies and gentlemen, they have never forgotten that. I ha ve<br />
been reminded of it every time I have been there since. I<br />
don't think they ever will because they realise that our<br />
policies in Australia have been policies of action uip to our<br />
capacity for action and not just kind . yiords.<br />
Now all this adds up to something which is at the<br />
very heart of all this. Of course we wrant peace. J! e are not<br />
going to try to secure peace by appeasement or by surrender.<br />
I would have thought that the world by now would have discovered<br />
that there is no future in that. Jewant peace, a peace<br />
based on understanding, a peace based on a genuinely friendly<br />
approach, a peace bc'sed upon not exacerbating any little<br />
differences that may occur between us and any of our neighbours,<br />
but when it comes to the stage where there are hundreds of<br />
thousands of armed people engaged in war-like operations in<br />
Vietnam and the very frontier of freedom is in that country,<br />
then we must make up our minds that we are not just bystanders.<br />
This is not only thie freedom of South Vietnam, it is<br />
our freedom. It is the freedom of all countries in this part<br />
of the world that is involved, and therefore we say, and I am<br />
sure you agree iwith us, we are not appeasing, we are not<br />
retreating, we are not going to subscribe to any foolish view<br />
that the right way to solve the South Viotnam problem is for<br />
the Americans to desert South Vietnam and for us to go out with<br />
them. Wlhat fantasylJ You settle an argument with communism,<br />
aggressive coimunism, by yielding at the field and delivering<br />
millions of people into its clutches. This is not the<br />
Australian spirit, and it is because I have nevar doubted as<br />
to where the Austr, Iian people stand on this matter that from<br />
first to last we have said what we have said and have done<br />
what we said. Now, time marches on and my years are not illimitable<br />
and yours are to come. It may be in theory that when you have<br />
come into your estate politically, it may be thought that we<br />
were wrong. I hope It won't be. But when you have come into<br />
your estate, I hope that you will have concluded in your own<br />
time that there are some things in life for which you must<br />
stadfor which you must battle, in which you must believe,<br />
whatever the dogs are barking. This is the secret of liberalism.<br />
It is in your hands. </p>
