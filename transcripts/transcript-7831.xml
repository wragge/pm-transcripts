PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, CHURCHILL PARK, ROCKINGHAM,<br />
NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E &amp; O0E -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Pr-ime Minister, how important is a Labor<br />
victory in South Australia for you?<br />
PM: Well, I have said and so has Mr Bannon that the election<br />
-in South Australia is about who's going to govern the<br />
state of South Australia in the next three years. it<br />
can't determine anything else, it can only determine that.<br />
so they've got to. when they go into the ballot box, they've<br />
got to say do they want John Bannon or John Olsen governing<br />
them and I know what the majority decision ought to be.<br />
Now, having said that. I'd much prefer that John Bannon<br />
will win and I think he will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned about the latest polls<br />
that puts the Liberals eight points ahead?<br />
PM: Wait a minute polls, there are a number of polls<br />
and I would say that on the average of the polls Labor<br />
would be showing to win. But in politics as you know<br />
you've got a range of polls, some out there, some there.<br />
On our best reading of, taking all the polls into account<br />
including our own, we should win.<br />
JOURNALIST: But psychologically a defeat there would<br />
be very bad for you<br />
PM: We wouldn't like it. we wouldn't like it, that's<br />
right. JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that Mr Bannon has perhaps<br />
felt the need to distance himself from the Federal issues?<br />
PM: No I understand that completely because he<br />
understands what the realities are, that it's not about<br />
Federal decisions. They can't make any decision there<br />
which affects what happens Federally. All they can decide<br />
Is who is going to be the Premier of the State and which<br />
party Is going to govern the State for the next three<br />
years. That's the only thing that can be decidqpd. </p>
<p>on his record, John Bannon. in my judgement and I'm trying<br />
to be as obJective as r can about that, I think that he's<br />
been an excellent Premier. He deserves to win.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just on another matter that you<br />
touched on yesterday, Cambodia.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there some prospect then that perhaps<br />
if Senator Evans' initiative goes ahead that Australian<br />
troops will end up being sent over there?<br />
PM: don't see that as any immediate outcome and<br />
that's certainly not part of the We've said on that<br />
issue all the way along, through the various proposals<br />
that have been floated through parties immediately concerned<br />
and other nations interested, that if there was a consensus<br />
emerged that in the international control mechanism that<br />
there was a view that you needed some troops we don't<br />
say necessarily that that is the case but if that were<br />
to emerge then we would be prepared to look at participating<br />
In that. We've said that all along, but the proposal<br />
that we've put for-ward of the concept of United Nations<br />
interim administration in Cambodia, it doesn't have that<br />
as a, you know, an inevitable component, that is Australian<br />
troops. But if the proposal were to recommend Itself<br />
and it's probably got as much practicability as a number<br />
of other proposals that have been looked at and tossed<br />
around for some time, then we would face up to that<br />
implication.<br />
JOURNALIST: A lot of the people here are expressing concern<br />
among themselves about Interest rates. What chance have<br />
you got of winning an election with interesL rates aL<br />
this sort of level?<br />
PM1: I think the Australian electorate has got very, very<br />
much more sophisticated in the period since we've been<br />
in office and they know what is a simple and obvious<br />
truth, that I think they think I'm an intelligent bloke.<br />
I think they probably think I'm a pretty sort of reasonable<br />
bloke, and there's no way I mean, you just ask yourself<br />
why would Bob Hawke have interest rates higher for one<br />
day longer than necessary? I'd be mad, I'd be out of<br />
my mind. As I say, I'm not a masochist, I don't like<br />
hurting myself and I don't like hurting other people.<br />
BuL we've got a situation where we've just got to lower<br />
the level of activity and to do that we've just got to<br />
have interest rates a bit higher,. because if we didn't<br />
the economy would Just collapse if we kept on bringing<br />
in the level of imports that we couldn't pay for. So<br />
we've just got to slow things down and as soon as they're<br />
slowed down sufficiently, while still keeping growth,<br />
still keeping the employment of our commnunity going<br />
once that's happened then they will come off. </p>
<p>( PM cont): But I can't do it a day earlier than is necessary.<br />
I'd love to do it tomorrow. I could buy the cheap vote<br />
easily. I could just ring up Canberra and say ease<br />
the screws, rates down. I could got instant popularity<br />
like that, but it would be irresponsible and I won't do<br />
it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Isn't it a fact though that those home loan<br />
interest rates aren't helping Mr Bannon in South Australia?<br />
PM: No they haven't been a plus, but I just repeat what<br />
I've been saying. Wouldn't I be a great Prime Minister<br />
if I said I've got a Labor colleague, the Premier of South<br />
Australia, he's going up for election so I'll be totally<br />
irresponsible, I'll reduce interest rates because that<br />
might help Bannon get through. Well you're looking at<br />
the wrong bloke if you think I'm going to play with the<br />
future of this country like that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just lastly, what's your<br />
perception of how Peter Dowding and his Government have<br />
been handling themselves over here?<br />
PM: I think difficult, some difficult circumstances that<br />
this Government acquired. I think he's been going well<br />
and he's been given a mandate quite recently, just at<br />
the beginning of this year. relatively early in his term,<br />
and I believe that he will show that he and his colleagues<br />
will provide the sort of Government that's required.<br />
JOURNALIST: You would be aware that there's some possibility<br />
anyway that the conservatives over here will block the<br />
Budget going through the House?<br />
PM: Yes, well isn't it, it's a great paradox of<br />
Australian politics and I'd Just like to make it quite<br />
clear. Who is it in politics who always talk about law<br />
and order, respecting the law, respecting the conventions.<br />
It's always the conservatives. You must respect the law.<br />
you must have law and order, you must have convention.<br />
But who are the ones who will talk iibouL breaking the<br />
most fundamental law and order and conventions in our<br />
society? They did it in ' 75 and now they're talking about<br />
it here. This GovernmenL was given a mandate by the people<br />
In the beginning of this year, Lhkey're entitled to serve<br />
and I understand the National Party will have the appropriate<br />
sense of responsibility to ensure that they are allowed<br />
to continue that mandate.<br />
ends </p>
