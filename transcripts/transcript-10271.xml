13 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF NATIONAL<br />
FAMILY DAY, SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Mr Handbury, Mrs Zaetta, Mr Moriarty, your Grace, the<br />
Archbishop of Sydney, Dr John Yu, the Director of the Westmead Children's Hospital,<br />
my Parliamentary colleagues, Peter Collins, Kerry Chikarovski, Marlene Goldsmith,<br />
other guests and everybody, ladies and gentlemen. Can I start by congratulating<br />
Murdoch Magazines and in particular the magazine, Family Circle, for the initiative of<br />
that organisation and that magazine in sponsoring the idea of inaugurating a National<br />
Family Day in Australia.<br />
It is a very important initiative and could I also compliment Telstra for its very heavy<br />
involvement. Of course we all understand the natural symbiosis between Telstra and<br />
teenage families. It's very powerful indeed and we're all very conscious of it and not<br />
surprisingly, you ought to keep promoting National Family Day. You ought to have<br />
several of them and then perhaps your competitors will have several of them, but<br />
seriously, it is another demonstration of another very important strand in our society<br />
and that is the greater willingness of larger business organisations to undertake a<br />
philanthropic role in our society of putting something back into a society and a<br />
community which commercially gives so much to many of our large organisations.<br />
And I do acknowledge particularly the role of Murdoch Magazines and Telstra in<br />
launching and certainly garnering the idea and launching this event which will be<br />
celebrated for the first time in October of this year.<br />
My own views and that of my Government about the importance of the family unit<br />
within our society are very well known. Of course a commitment to the role of the<br />
family in our community is not a matter of political contention. It's one of those things<br />
that all political parties hold in common and all political parties are committed to. I<br />
think it is fair to say that the shape of families has changed dramatically over the last </p>
<p>or 50 years, particularly over the last 20 or 30. But they're important to the<br />
development of the human personality. Their value as a source, not only of emotional<br />
but also of material support has not really altered although the way in which it is<br />
expressed has changed over that period of time.<br />
We naturally see our association and our bonds with our families in emotional,<br />
personal terms but it's also fair to say that in welfare terms, and I have frequently said<br />
this in the past and I will say it again, that a stable, functioning family represents the<br />
best social welfare safety net that mankind has ever devised and no political philosophy<br />
or no economic philosophy can replace the role of that family functioning effectively<br />
and functioning in a supportive fashion. One of the very interesting influences on the<br />
way in which the family has developed in the Australian community has been the<br />
contribution of people of diverse ethnic backgrounds to the strengthening and the<br />
development of family life in Australia. Many Australians of Asian, of Middle Eastern,<br />
of Southern European descent have brought particular strengths to the texture of<br />
Australian family life and the emphasis that so many within our community who<br />
represent those diverse backgrounds, the emphasis they place on the importance of the<br />
role of the family in Australian society is a source of very positive strengths and a<br />
source of great nourishment to the overall impact of family life within our community.<br />
The role of the Government in relation to families of course is not a prescriptive or a<br />
determinant role. Rather it is the role of creating the circumstances of maximum<br />
choice and maximum opportunity. We have made a number of changes to areas which<br />
affect families which we believe are very beneficial. Our changes to the environment in<br />
which people work have enabled in our view, will enable in our view as the changes<br />
come into effect, will enable people to more effectively blend their work and their<br />
family responsibilities. A survey carried out several years ago directed towards<br />
Australian women produced four priority areas so far as women in Australia were<br />
concerned and the one on the top of that list was how women could more effectively<br />
combine their work and their family responsibilities and one of the values of more<br />
flexibility in workplace relations is that you do enable people to find the combination<br />
that best suits them. It's not for the Government to say that you shall work a<br />
particular period of time at a set time or week. It is rather for the Government to<br />
create an environment where you can work out with yourselves and your employer and<br />
your family to the maximum extent possible, and I emphasise that as a realistic caution,<br />
to the maximum extent possible, you work out the most effective combination of work<br />
and family responsibilities.<br />
Another issue of course that emerges very strongly from the emphasis that we place on<br />
policies affecting the family is that we believe very strongly as a Government that the<br />
arrangements that parents make for the care of their children and the combination of<br />
full or part time parental care as distinct from paid childcare is a matter of individual<br />
choice. There is no right or wrong pattern. The pattern for a family is the pattern that<br />
best suits that family and once again, it is not the role of the Government to say which<br />
should be the predominant pattern and it is a wholly unhealthy trend for there to be a<br />
continuing debate within our community as to which is the right or the wrong way to<br />
care for young children. The right way is the way that the parents of the children<br />
decide the environment in which those children should be raised. </p>
<p>My Government has also placed additional resources into areas of parenting education.<br />
We've also doubled the resources available to marriage and relationship counselling,<br />
recognising in this area as in so many other areas the old maxim that prevention is<br />
better than cure is one that ought to be observed as much as possible. Our Family Tax<br />
Initiative, which commenced on the first of January gave expression to our desire to<br />
give additional tax help to families with young children within certain income ranges<br />
and so to emphasise the importance within our community of affording families the<br />
maximum amount of choice possible.<br />
But ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day the family unit is not a accumulation of<br />
tax benefits, an accumulation of industrial relations options or an accumulation of<br />
passionately held economic or political views. The family unit is a source of love and<br />
support, the group in our community from which most of us derived our principle<br />
source of personal satisfaction, personal happiness and personal strengths. Families<br />
come in different combinations. Not all families are happy. It's unrealistic to pretend<br />
that they are. Some families break down. The role of society ought to be comforting<br />
and assisting and also putting in place policies that minimise to the maximum extent<br />
possible the extent to which families do break down. I think it is important in our<br />
society that we emphasise in a very significant way as this National Day will, the<br />
importance of the family unit within our community. It is striking as Mr Handbury said<br />
in his introductory remarks that despite all the changes that have occurred over the last<br />
or 30 years in our society and despite all of the negative talk about how deleterious<br />
are the influences of change on the family unit within our community, when you ask<br />
people what is the most important thing in their lives, most of them unerringly and<br />
quickly and without qualification say my family is the most important thing I have.<br />
And that is a very, very signalled message. It's something that reminds us that<br />
although things have changed a great deal, there are some things that haven't changed<br />
at all and the emotional importance that we place on the family unit is one of those<br />
things that have not altered.<br />
So may I say again in conclusion, to the Murdoch Magazines, to Telstra, and to those<br />
who have organised this little gathering and this little launch, how delighted I am to be<br />
here. The day will have the full support of my Government. I know it will have the<br />
goodwill of both sides of politics in the Australian Parliament and I wish it every great<br />
success and I know that the Australian community will recognise the importance of the<br />
occasion and give it the support that it deserves.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
