FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 4/ 1970<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF " ENDEAVOUR" CANNON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, announced today<br />
that one of the six cannon jettisoned by Captain Cook from the " Endeavour"<br />
on the Great Barrier Reef in 1770 would be mounted and displayed in<br />
the National Capital. Queensland and New South Wales, the States most<br />
intimately associated with Captain Cook would each receive a cannon.<br />
Mr. Gorton said that he had written to Dr. H. Radclyffe<br />
Roberts, Director of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, the<br />
organisation responsible for mounting the expedition and locating the<br />
cannon, and had offered a cannon to them. Another was being presented<br />
to the Governmeat and people of New Zealand as a goodwill gesture to<br />
mark that country's bicentenary celebrations of Cook's circumnavigation<br />
of New Zealand prior to discovering Australia. The sixth cannon would<br />
be presented to Britain for display at the National Maritime Museum at<br />
Greenwich. The Prime Minister said: " I would like to pay tribute to<br />
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, in particular to Dr. Virgil<br />
Kauffman and Brigadier-General Wolf for the magnificent research,<br />
planning and effort which led to the discovery of these important relics..<br />
It was a happy coincidence that they were recovered in time to permit<br />
their restoration for Australia's bicentenary year.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the cannon, which were<br />
coral encrusted, had undergone considerable restoration in the Defence<br />
Standards Laboratories of the Department of Supply under the care of<br />
Dr. C. Pearson and his staff. Considerable study of the original<br />
specifications had been made and it was proposed to construct wooden<br />
mountings for the cannon which were identical with the original mountings.<br />
