<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Eating well and exercising regularly is important for all Australians and especially for children.</p>
<p>Up to a quarter of kids aged between 7 and 15 are considered to be overweight or obese and this makes them more likely to get sick as they get older.</p>
<p>Australia's top science agency - the CSIRO - has developed a quick an easy guide for healthy eating and living for kids.</p>
<p>It recommends water rather than sugary drinks for thirsty kids, plenty of fruit, vegetables and wholegrains and healthy snacks like an apple over chips and lollies. </p>
<p>Children should be encouraged to get out and about - they should be active for at least an hour a day and every morning should start with a healthy breakfast. </p>
<p>It's good advice.</p>
<p>Later today I'll be promoting the CSIRO's new guide which sets out 10 easy steps to follow.</p>
<p>It's part of the government's range of measures to tackle childhood obesity. </p>
<p>Working together, we can all help our kids have a better life.   </p>
<p>Thanks.  </p>
