PRIME MINISTER 87/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY TIlE PRIME MINIS'TER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
PUBLIC AWARENESS OF MABO<br />
I was pleased to note today that an opinion poll has found that Australians broadly<br />
understand the limits of the High Court Mabo decision, and that it does not pose a<br />
threat to backyards, or other privately-owned property.<br />
While I have never been one to rely absolutely on the findings of such surveys, it is<br />
reassuring to learn that an overwhelming majority of people have seen through the<br />
scaremongering. It confirms my confidence in the common sense and fair-mindedness<br />
of Australians.<br />
Only seven per cent of those surveyed said they believed the Mabo judgement entitled<br />
Aborigines to claim " any" land in Australia, including metropolitan land. Of course,<br />
they are ill-informed.<br />
As the Government has maintained since the handing down of the Mabo judgement last<br />
year, the decision does not threaten private property rights, and should be viewed as an<br />
opportunity rather than as a problem.<br />
My Government continues to work and make progress towards a sensible<br />
administrative response to the Mabo decision a response which will balance the<br />
interests of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders with the broad national economic<br />
interest. We are continuing to consult with the States and, as I have said before, we intend to be<br />
in a position to introduce Commonwealth legislation during the Budget session of<br />
Parliament, commencing on August 17.<br />
