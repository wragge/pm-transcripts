P. M. No. 95/ 1961<br />
DEATH OF SIR JACK HOBBS<br />
Statment by the Prine Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Jack Hobbs was of course famous as a great<br />
cricketer. There has never been a player with better<br />
technical equipment or temperament. Good wickets or<br />
bad wiokets seemed to come all alike to him.<br />
He was also a very fine fieldsman in the covers<br />
where he never appeared to hurry yet always seemed to<br />
get to the ball sooner than the batsman expected.<br />
But apart from that, he was a charming and<br />
modest man who enjoyed the personal affection of many<br />
thousands of people.<br />
I saw a good deal of hil on visits to England<br />
and in Australia and was proud to claim him as a friend.<br />
CANBERRA, 22nd December, 1963. </p>
