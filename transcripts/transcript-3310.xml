PRESS STATEMENT NO. 2/ 6<br />
1 July 1974<br />
NEW MEMBERS OF AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE<br />
ARTS AND ITS BOARDS<br />
The Prime minis-ter today announced the names of 46<br />
new members of the Australian Council for the Arts and its<br />
seven specialist boards. These new members will replace<br />
foundation members of the Council and Boards whose terms end<br />
on 30 June. In announcing the names the Prime Minister said that<br />
he had decided to implement at this stage the principle of<br />
rotating membership on which the new organisation would be based.<br />
The system meant that the Council and Boards would have an annual<br />
changeover of a proportion of the membership while keeping a<br />
working continuity of experienced people. Over a period of<br />
years this system would enable many Australians to participate<br />
in the work of the Council. It would also ensure a flow of<br />
new ideas and values.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the list of new appointments<br />
included many people who had put their names forward in response<br />
to a public request by the Council for people wishing to serve<br />
in this way. The Prime Minister expressed his thanks to the many<br />
hundreds of people who had offered their services. He said that<br />
these names would be kept on a list for future reference when new<br />
vacancies occurred. The enthusiastic response from such a wide<br />
sector of the community was a matter for great encouragement.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that he wished to express his great<br />
gratitude to those members ending -their terms of office. " The<br />
establishment phase of any new national institution necessarily<br />
involves a period of difficulty and considerable dedication on the<br />
part of those involved," he said. " In the case of the Council for<br />
the Arts, many of Australia's best artists and many people from<br />
the general community with very heavy personal responsibilities<br />
have been willing to give most generously of their time and interest<br />
to plan an organisation appropriate to the particular needs of the<br />
arts and to sit on boards and committees to establish policies<br />
and decide on financial allocations. Without the generosity and<br />
enthusiasm of these people we would not have succeeded in generating<br />
the degree of activity and wide interest in the arts which have<br />
become apparent over the last 18 months. The sacrifices made by<br />
members with busy careers indicate a dedication to the interests<br />
of the arts of which Australia may feel truly proud". </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the new appointments had been<br />
made with a particular eye to one aspect of Government policy in<br />
the arts namely the aim of increasing awareness, appreciation<br />
and participation in the arts throughout the general community.<br />
" We must at all times ensure through the Council for the Arts<br />
that Australia provides for the interests of its best professionals<br />
and enables people to plan and pursue careers in the arts at the<br />
very highest level in their own cou ' ntry. However this objective<br />
would be empty without a commensurate degree of community<br />
interest and involvement," the Prime Minister said. " Many of the<br />
new members will be able through their background and experience to<br />
contribute to policies which will enable the arts to pervade the<br />
whole texture of our society so that no citizen will be deprived<br />
of an opportunity to enjoy what the arts have to offer either as<br />
a participant or as a member of -the interested public."<br />
