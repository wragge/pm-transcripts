W A G E S, P R I C E S A N D INFLATION<br />
Last week I spoke to you about our arbitration system.<br />
Tonight i want to soeak, to you about a related problem.<br />
We have now reached a crucial point in our campaign to<br />
dampen down the inflationary pressures in the national economy. The<br />
decisions of the Arbitration Commission in the National Wage Case<br />
which was made public only last Friday, was a balanced and sensible<br />
decision. On the one hand the National Wage decision gave a sizeable<br />
increase in the wages of those members of the work force who have been<br />
left furthest behind in the race for higher and higher wages. I am<br />
referring to the increase for people on the minimum wage. The Arbitration<br />
Commission gave this section of the community the greatest assistance.<br />
The National Wage decision is consistent with the submissions<br />
made by the Australian Govern-ent to the Arbitration Commission. I am<br />
glad the Commission adopted the needs approach to these people on the<br />
minimum wage. On the other hand, the Commission came down on the<br />
side of moderation and restraint in its general wage decision. So the<br />
Commission has set us a national example, and it has also given us the<br />
chance to place some brake on inflationary forces.<br />
Let me emphasise there can be absolutely no doubt whatsoever<br />
that wage costs are the biggest factor in the inflationary process. In<br />
the twelve months up till last Christmas, wages went up by an average<br />
of about eleven per cent. We got the inevitable and inescapable result.<br />
Inflationary pressures broke out in a rash of increased prices. In<br />
the twelve months to the end of March this year, the official figures<br />
show that prices went u by seven per cent. This was alright for the<br />
big unions using industrial muscle and strikes to force big wage increases<br />
at the expense of other ' people. And it was at the expense of people on<br />
fixed incomes and people on low incomes who do not have a great influence<br />
over the level of their wages. These sort of excessive and unremitting<br />
demands for higher and higher wages are one of the root causes of.<br />
inflation and in turn high prices. ./ 2 </p>
<p>The other root cause is closely linked to it. And I refer<br />
to the industrial trouble that goes with itese wage demands. In the<br />
last two or three years some trade unionists have got so involved in<br />
their own power and political struggles that they seem to have<br />
forgotten the main interests of their own nimbers lies in curbing<br />
inflation. And in legitimately obtaining through arbitration,<br />
improvements in : ages and conditions in proportion to the'actual and<br />
real increase in production of the national economy. This is the<br />
familiar story of trying to squeeze a quart out of a pint pot. It<br />
just won't work.<br />
In facing up to these causes of inflation, we in the<br />
Government have been determined to put a stop to this sort of thing<br />
in four ways. We have made the biggest changes in the industrial laws<br />
since 1947 to blunt the militant use of union power and to democratise<br />
the unions. The debate on these changes is going on in the National<br />
Parliament today.<br />
We will also promote more competition between businesses by<br />
making the restrictive trade practices laws stronger and by overhauling<br />
the levels of tariffs. The Attorney-General is now preparing<br />
a statement for the Parliament on restrictive trade practices.<br />
I have told you what the Government is doing in the fight<br />
against inflation. I appeal to both union leaders and employers to<br />
show restraint and comnionsense. Union leaders know that the best<br />
interests of their members lie in curbing inflation. And employers,<br />
too, must not use this National Wage decision as an excuse for<br />
further price rises.<br />
I can assure you that inflation works against your best<br />
interests. That is why we in the Government are taking the leadership<br />
to control it and are taking the decisive action to ensure sound<br />
development and rogress in Australia. </p>
