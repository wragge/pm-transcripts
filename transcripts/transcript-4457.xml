PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS I AUGUST 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT BARTON BLECTORATE DINNER<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here tonight to speak at a dinner<br />
organised by Jim Bradfield's Electorate Committee. There were<br />
some wonderful results in the last elect'-ion, but there were few<br />
swings larger than the one in Barton.<br />
We all owe a great deal to people like Jim and his Committeeand<br />
to Maurice Neil and Don Dobie who are also here tonight,<br />
for ensuring a Liberal victory at that watershed election 19<br />
months ago.<br />
It was the Liberal Party's unity and commitment to establishing<br />
the conditions in which men and women can create a better life<br />
for themselves that won us the 1975 election so handsomely. It<br />
has been the same unity and commitment that has enabled us to<br />
begin to translate liberal principles into reality.<br />
The Liberal Party's unity and our concern for the individual<br />
makes us different from the ALP. Labor's National Conference<br />
in Perth showed how divided they were, and how strongly they<br />
wanted to centralise power. Some people say that the ALP's<br />
problem is a lack of leadership. In f act, the ALP has too many<br />
leaders we have got Mr. Whitlam, Mr. Hayden, Mr. Ijren and<br />
Mr. Hawke. All competing with one another. Mr. Hawke is not<br />
even an MP but that does not prevent him announcing that he<br />
will only enter Parliament if he is made Party Leader. He had<br />
to admit that no members of the party rushed forward to offer<br />
their support.<br />
At Perth Mr. Whitlam having retained his leadership by two<br />
votes made a speech saying Labor would have to be economically<br />
responsible. This obviously impressed Mr. Hlayden. lie said that<br />
Mr. whitlam's speech must have been written on the road to<br />
Damascus. It also impressed Mr. Ijawke. He conceded Mr. Whitlam<br />
was a greater man than he was ' for the time being'.<br />
The ALP may have a multiplicity of leaders, but they do agree<br />
that there should be; more government expenditure, more government<br />
intrusion into other people's lives, more taxes, more planning,<br />
more bureaucracy. They 6pent hours discussing this in Perth.<br />
They spent a bare 45 minutes on one of the major issues f acing<br />
Australia the mining and export of uranium. / ThiS is </p>
<p>This is a question of fundamental importance, which involves<br />
many issues affecting the nearby Aboriginal comunities, the<br />
environment, the problem of proliferation, waste disposal,<br />
the energy needs of other countries.<br />
Already, Britain, Germany, Japan, the United States and Franceto<br />
name a few produce a significant proportion of their*<br />
electricity from nuclear reactors. Europe's need for uranium<br />
was strongly emphasised t4-o me by the~ ixropean leaders I spoke to<br />
recently, including th e Socialist leaders of Britain . I<br />
and Germany. A curtailmient of uranium supplies will certainly<br />
lead to dearer energy, and it could lead to energy sbortages<br />
and international tensions.<br />
As we hold 20% of the world's uncommitted reserves of uranium,<br />
the world's energy needs must be considered very carefully.<br />
The Government is continuing its detailed consideration of<br />
this issues, and we have made it plain that there will be no<br />
mining and export of uranium unless the aboriginal communities<br />
and the environment at the mine sites are fully protected.<br />
There will be no mining and export unless a stringent set<br />
of safeguards is observed. we will insist that all customer<br />
countries observe the International Atomic Energy Agency's<br />
safeguards, and the further conditions contained in a special<br />
bilateral agreement with Australia. This is the ruost farreaching<br />
safieguards policy adopted by any country. It goes<br />
further than the safeguards suggested by Mr. Wbitlam in the<br />
House earlier tbis year. it ' is a practical, reasonable and<br />
effective package of safeguard measures. We will make a continuing<br />
effort to find ways of strengthening these safeguards.<br />
We wil~ l be participating, for example, in the international<br />
Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation Progra.-mme.<br />
Labor tries to represent its policy of an indefinite moratorium<br />
on uranium mining as a moral decision. in fact, it was nothing<br />
less than a cynical mnanoeuvre to paper over the differences<br />
between different ALP factions a manoeuvre from which the<br />
extreme left benefitted most. The PFerth decision required all<br />
kinds of intellectual and moral gymnastics from the ALP. When<br />
the ALP was in governmen, it ardently supported uranium mining.<br />
Then, they were concerned with only one consequence of<br />
uranium export the dollars and cents it would earn.<br />
in October 1974, the Minister for Minerals and Energy said<br />
the ALP would " ensure that: our major trading partners, Japan,<br />
Italy and West Germany obtain an equitable share of the<br />
uranitum we have for export." In October 1975, the Minister<br />
for Aboriginal Affairs stated that " International assurances<br />
have been provided by Ministers that Australia will meet the<br />
uranium requirements of our major trading partners which could<br />
arnoun~ t to about 100,000 tons of uranium." In March 1975 the<br />
then Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Cairns, and the Minister for<br />
Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, issued a joint statement with Iran<br />
that " Iran would be given access to supplies of uranium from<br />
Australia under favourxable conditions." On 2 June 1.975, the<br />
present Shadow Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr. Keating,<br />
said " Japan is interested in moving into nuclear power and<br />
en-riched fuel. We are prepared to give the Japanese any amount<br />
of fuel that they need..." " The only thing is that we would<br />
like to do the enriching. Instead of sending just yallowcake / at </p>
<p>3-<br />
at bargain-basement prices, we want to get the profit that<br />
comes f rom enrichmnent.<br />
Only days before going out of office, Mr. Whitlam signed a<br />
Memorandum of Understantding f or developing the Ranger Uranium<br />
deposit. He applauded the development as a " major export<br />
earner". At the 1975 Terrigal Labor Conference he helped to<br />
defeat a motion for a 12 months moratoriu-m on uraniumi mining.<br />
Now he says he opposes uranium mining. The lights on the road<br />
to Damascus must have been so dlazzling that Mr. Whitlam can<br />
reverse his stand on any issue without blinking.<br />
Daring the 45 minute debate, Mr. Whitlam and Mx. Hayden sat<br />
mute. Mr. Hawke who had said his heart said no, but his<br />
head said yes to the mining and export of uranium, also sat<br />
silent. What with his head and heart giving conflicting<br />
instructions, he must have lost his voice. But he did speak<br />
up outside the Conference. lie said that there should be more<br />
debate on the issue, and that as a matter of intellectual<br />
integrity, he was not convinced by the arguments for leaving<br />
uranium in the ground.<br />
Mr. Hawke will not be allowed to say th-is sort of thing in the<br />
future. Some unions complained about his statements. And the<br />
Administrative Committee of the ALP in Victoria rules that<br />
every ALP member had to comply with the Perth decision<br />
" including the National President". Mr. Hawke is now protesting<br />
that his statements did accord with that policy. Poor Mr. H-awke.<br />
He should know by now that " matters of intellectual integrity"<br />
do not count for much with the left.<br />
The mining and exporting of uranium does raise moral issues of<br />
fundamental importance. Labor has always evaded them. My<br />
Goverrnent's steadfast posit-ion has been that decisions on<br />
uranium will not be based on the commercial considerations<br />
that were so transparently at the heart of Labor's approach.<br />
our decision will forma a proper and considered response to all<br />
the complex moral and technical issues which the uranium question<br />
involves. The care witi3 which this Government is dealing with the issue of<br />
uranium mining and export, characterises our approach to all<br />
issues of national importance the economy, to the problem<br />
of inequality and disadvantage, to issues of freedom and civil<br />
liberties, to the problems faced by small business. The<br />
Government has taken a number of important initiatives in all<br />
these areas, and I would like to mention just some of the<br />
actions we have taken to assist the small businessman.<br />
The Government is well aware of the importance of the small<br />
business sector. It is a major employer, and constitutes more<br />
than 90% of all business enterprises in this country. The<br />
health of this sector vitally affects the health of the whole<br />
community. In recent years, small business has been under<br />
considerable pressure. Its most serious difficulty has been<br />
ina finding adequate capital to finance its growth and<br />
development. The small businessman does not have access to<br />
/ the </p>
<p>-4-<br />
the stock market for funds, and other traditional sources of<br />
finance, such as bank~ s, are not always able to lend f inance<br />
when required. one reason that the small businessman has had<br />
such a pressing need to find capital is that he has found it<br />
increasingly difficult to finance his growth out of retained<br />
profits and cash flow, In recognition of this, the Governent<br />
haa introduced a series of taxation concessions designed to<br />
remedy this position.<br />
We have introduced a generous investment allowance, which<br />
provides a special tax deduction of 40% of the capital cost<br />
of eligible plant and improvements. We have introduced a<br />
special deduction, called the Trading Stock Valuation Adjustment,<br />
which discounts the value of stock for t1-ax. purposes to take into<br />
account the effects of inflation. With the needs of small<br />
business particularly in mind, we have increased the retention<br />
allowance that is, the proportion of business income that a<br />
private company may retain free of the special tax on undisturbed<br />
income from 50% to 60%. And for those small businessmen who<br />
are primary producers, the system of income Equalisation Deposits<br />
has been introduced. This helps to overcome the dramatic<br />
fluctuations in income which primary producers receive from<br />
year to year.<br />
In addition, like all taxpayers, small businessmen have benefitted<br />
from the historic reform of tax indexation. All these measures,<br />
together with the success of our anti-inflationary policies, have<br />
caused a dramatic turnaround in company profits. The latest<br />
available figures show that company profits in the March quarter<br />
of this year were running 27% ahead of the comparable position<br />
last year. We are also examining the possibility of increasing<br />
the availability of loan capital to small businessmen. A report<br />
issued last year by the Government concluded that there was a<br />
gap in the supply of medium term and long term finance to an<br />
important number of Australian enterprises. We have set up a<br />
task force to examine this matter further and I hope to receive<br />
their report shortly.<br />
The Commonwealth and th1e States have, in the spirit of the new<br />
federalism policies which my Government is pursuing, agreed on<br />
a co-ordinated approach in assisting small businessmen.<br />
Under the new co-operative scheme, the states are providing<br />
counselling services, management courses, and in some cases,<br />
guarantees for -bank loans. The Government is providing research<br />
and information, and co-ordinating the whole scheme to avoid<br />
duplication and maximise the efficient use of available resources.<br />
The Government is determined to encourage the growth of small<br />
business. Such growth is a vital part of our strategy for the<br />
recovery of the Australian economy.<br />
Another sector which is of vital importance to ouir economy is<br />
our export industries. They too have been under pressure,<br />
particularly from the affects of inflation which has pushed<br />
up their costs, in many cases faster than theprices they have<br />
received in foreign markets. Moreover, this pressure has been<br />
greatly increased for exports of agricultural products by the<br />
problem of obtaining access to major markets in Europe. / For some </p>
<p>For some years t the European Economic community has excluded<br />
virtually all Australian agricultural products other than wool,<br />
and, what is worse, European domestic surpluses have been<br />
exported to third countries under exorbitant subsidies thereby<br />
undercutting us in markets right around the world.<br />
More recently these policies of exclusion have been extended<br />
to Japanese manufactured goods, and steel from Japan and<br />
South Africa.<br />
On my visit to Europe in June, I was informed that, the EEC<br />
wished to make Australia reduce our exports of steel to the<br />
Community by 25%, on the grounds that Australia was allegedly<br />
an unf air trader. I would not voluntarily contemplate such<br />
cuts and the request was subsequently withdrawn. I pointed<br />
out the inequity of the current position under which European<br />
exporters have consistently obtained access to our markets<br />
evert in times of economic difficulty whereas many of * our<br />
exports have been utterly excluded from Europe.<br />
Such exiclusion hurts us because the EE~ C, with 260 million<br />
pe. o ple, is the world's largest trader, accounting for<br />
of the world's trade.<br />
As a result of these deliberations, the European Commission<br />
agreed to hold major bilateral discussions later this year.<br />
it was clearly vital that we be represented at these discumions<br />
at the highest level, and accordingly I have appointed a<br />
M4inister, John Howard, to lead the negotiations.<br />
As the Constitution requires, he will be supported by a<br />
new Department, but it will consist of only some 20-30<br />
people. Its function will be to act as a Secretariat<br />
to the negotiating team.<br />
We do not expect the basic principles of the Community' s<br />
Common Agricultural Policy to be altered. But there is<br />
room within that policy to accoimmodate fairly the mutual<br />
interests of the Community and ourselves. Questions of<br />
trade will also be discussed at my meeting with the five<br />
ASEAN Heads of Government in a f ew days time.<br />
My Government has always attached very great importance to<br />
ASEA. The AS13AN countries are a populous, resource-rich<br />
and economically dynamic group of neighbours. Many of our<br />
vital communications links pass through this area, and we have<br />
important and longstanding security agreements with individual<br />
ASEAN members. The region forms our fairth largest export market<br />
and Australia's imports from the five countries have continued<br />
to grow at a substantial rate each year. Between 1970-71<br />
the 1975-76, ASEAN's exports to Australia increased from<br />
$ 87 million to $ 317 million, a growth rate twice as fast<br />
as that of total Australian imports. Since 1971-72, our<br />
imports * of textiles, clothing and footwear from ASEA~ N countries<br />
have increased four and a half times, and the rapid expansion<br />
of imports of ASEAN textiles and clothing has continued, even<br />
though some general import restraints were introduced on these<br />
items in 1974-75. / The </p>
<p>-6<br />
The Pustralian consumption of ASEAN goods on a per capita<br />
basis is appreciably higher than in other developed countries.<br />
Australian per capita imports of manufactured products from<br />
ASEAN in 1975 was $ 6.50, compared with $ 4.10 for the USA,<br />
$ 2.80 for Japan, $ 2.40 for the BBC and $ 2 for Canada.<br />
The value of our imports of textiles, apparel and footwear<br />
per head was over $ 2 compared with less than $ 1 for each<br />
of the countries 1 have mentioned.<br />
I am confident that as economic conditions in Australia<br />
improve, we will be able to strengthen further our economic<br />
relationship with ASEAN. We have already laid the groundwork<br />
in formulating the Australian Government's long-term policy<br />
towards manufacturing industry. But many parts of the<br />
manufacturing sector have been subjected to exceedingly<br />
rapid rates of change and it is not . reasonable given the<br />
level of unemployment in Australia to subject them to aIc<br />
greater rate of change.<br />
The Government recognises the need for special policies of<br />
protection for-particularly vulnerable industries. I believe<br />
the ASEA~ N Governments themselves recognise Australia's<br />
situation. My discussions later this week will help us to plan for the<br />
future, to investigate together with' the ASEAN countries those<br />
areas in which we can strengthen our economic relations to theI<br />
greatest benefit.<br />
Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to speak here tonight.<br />
Jim Bradfield is a most effective representative for thi3<br />
electorate, and a constructive and energetic member of the<br />
Government team, particularly through his contributions on<br />
the Government Parties Treasu. ry Committee of which he is<br />
Deputy Chairman. I feel sure, judging from the numbers<br />
here tonight, that you are giving Jim your wholehearted support,<br />
and that he will remain the Member for Barton for many years to<br />
come. </p>
