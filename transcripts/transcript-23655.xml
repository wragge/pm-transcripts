    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have instructed that the Australian National Flag be flown at half-mast tomorrow on all Australian Government establishments, here and overseas, as a mark of respect to the Australians who have lost their lives in the tragic grounding of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.</p>
<p>The Governor-General and I will attend a church service at St Maryâs Cathedral in Sydney on Sunday as we stand together as a nation at this difficult time.</p>
<p>A National Commemorative Service will be held at a later time when the families of those who have lost their lives have had time to comprehend this horrific event.</p>
<p>At this time, there will be a National Day of Mourning and flags will be flown at half-mast once more.</p>
<p>18 July 2014</p>
