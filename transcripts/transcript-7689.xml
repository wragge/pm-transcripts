PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL MURPHY, TONIGHT, SBS TV,<br />
26 JULY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MURPHY: Can I begin by asking you what does the agenda<br />
which you've outlined today mean for ethnic communities in<br />
Broadmeadows, Cabramatta, Whyalla, Darwin, wherever they<br />
happen to live in this country?<br />
PM: It means these things. Firstly, a recognition now, I<br />
think, not just from the Government, but forcefully in front<br />
of the whole Australian people about the fact that every<br />
person in this country, irrespective of race, colour, creed,<br />
religion is entitled to a fair go, to access to the services<br />
of Government and to develop their particular talents.<br />
That's up there now in the boldest of letters. It is a<br />
Government commitment. It will become an Australian<br />
reality. Secondly, it means in practical terms the<br />
expenditure of a considerable amount of money in these areas<br />
which will be of importance to those people firstly, to<br />
greatly enhance the recognition of qualifications that these<br />
people have brought to Australia, whether they be trades<br />
qualifications or professional qualifications. There's been<br />
a laxness in the past, over a very long period of time, in<br />
recognising those qualifications and so people haven't been<br />
able to get the sort of employment, which would both give<br />
them the greater satisfaction and which would make the<br />
greatest economic contribution to this country. Secondly,<br />
in terms of the teaching of the English language, a very,<br />
very significant enhancement of expenditures there some<br />
million which will mean that there is going to be a<br />
greater opportunity for those people to acquire the English<br />
language which will mean that they will be better placed in<br />
their working environment as well as in their general social<br />
environment. In terms of the SBS, there's going to be an<br />
extension of the SBS to very large parts of Australia where<br />
there is meeting a criteria of large populations of at least<br />
100,000 and some significant ethnic contribution. In the<br />
area of courts, for instance, if they have any troubles<br />
where directly or indirectly they are involved we're going<br />
to be looking at the question of ensuring that there is a<br />
better provision of interpreters in the courts. So, in<br />
these quite practical ways, in their workplace, in their<br />
language, in their rights, their access to the services of<br />
Government will mean a great improvement for them all. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
MURPHY: So, very much an economic skew and particularly, as<br />
you say, in the workplace. I mean, people needn't fear any<br />
longer that lack of, say, English as a second language will<br />
discriminate against them in employment terms.<br />
PM: We will do everything we can in cooperation with the<br />
States, with employers, our own expenditures to see that<br />
they are given every opportunity to accelerate the<br />
acquisition of English as their language. But while you say<br />
yes, it does have an economic thrust, and in that sense<br />
there's a benefit to every single Australian, every<br />
Australian irrespective of their background, is going to be<br />
beter off if all Australians have the maximum chance of<br />
using their talents. But it's not just an economic thrust.<br />
I mean, very much social justice as well. We're going to<br />
ensure that the programs of Government and the services of<br />
Government are conducted in a way and made available in a<br />
way that no person will feel ill at ease or unable to take<br />
advantage of them because of their cultural or racial<br />
background. MURPHY: Prime Minister, as you know there are always cynics<br />
and critics. The extension of the service of SBS<br />
television. It's been suggested this morning that that<br />
favours Labor marginal seats. Is that valid?<br />
PM: Well, I expect and intend to do very well at the next<br />
election, winning seats from the Opposition, but even in my<br />
wildest dreams I don't expect to take out Darling Downs<br />
centred on Toowoomba. I mean, that's even a bit beyond me,<br />
but it's getting an SBS extension.<br />
MURPHY: In terms of timing, there was the environment<br />
statement last week, now this multicultural agenda. Does<br />
that give us any indication of election timing?<br />
PM: None at all. I mean, the fact is, as was indicated<br />
today, that I initiated these processes before the last<br />
election in April of 1987 when I had the first meeting of<br />
the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs. I said ' what<br />
I want to see for this country', nothing to do with election<br />
timing...., ' what I want to see for this country is a<br />
National Agenda for a multicultural Australia. Get to work<br />
on it and produce for me the work which will enable us to<br />
get that going by the middle of 1989'. So that was the<br />
timetable back then and they have done magnificent work. I<br />
thank them for it.<br />
MURPHY: In ' 86, of course, you were forced to make they<br />
were tough economic times as we are going through now you<br />
had to make cuts in certain multicultural areas, English as<br />
a second language. But does this represent now, this<br />
agenda, really a volte face on that? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: Not a volte face. I mean, I think that our friends,<br />
our fellow Australians, who have come to us from overseas in<br />
the ethnic communities, they would have been disadvantaged,<br />
I believe, if there had been a perception that in the tough<br />
times when we had to cut back on a whole lot of things, that<br />
if they hadn't had to have some share of that restraint and<br />
they overwhelmingly understood that. But now we've restored<br />
that before this agenda statement today. The agenda<br />
statement today represents a very significant increase in<br />
the expenditure of funds in that area because it's very<br />
important. It's not only, as I say, important for those who<br />
need to acquire English in an accelerated way, it's<br />
important for them, but the whole community, every single<br />
Australian benefits if our economy is going to be operating<br />
more efficiently because people are able to operate within<br />
it more efficiently. The estimate is that it's costing us<br />
hundreds, literally hundreds of millions of dollars per<br />
annum because of the absence of English proficiency in a<br />
fair part of the workforce.<br />
MURPHY: Is Cabinet totally behind this agenda?<br />
PM: Yes, yes.<br />
MURPHY: There have been reports that some of your drier,<br />
more harder-headed Ministers think ' why throw money at a<br />
particular segment of the community during tough economic<br />
times'? PM: No, they're totally behind the concept. Always when<br />
you're formulating policy and allocating amounts of money<br />
and if you have a collection of Ministers, some mightn't do<br />
it in terms of the actual amounts in precisely the same way.<br />
I think the amounts are right.<br />
MURPHY: One part of the agenda is that you may have a<br />
multiculturalism act. There may be legislation<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MURPHY: You're examining that?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MURPHY: Of course we know the survey recently put out of<br />
the distressing reality of racial discrimination which is<br />
still in this community. Can you actually legislate against<br />
such a thing?<br />
PM: Well, let me just make these points about it. What<br />
I've said is that I think the concept of an act makes sense,<br />
but I want to have a great deal of consultation in the<br />
community about it. If we can develop not an absolute<br />
consensus, but a wide degree of understanding of the<br />
benefits of this, it'll make sense. You can't legislate </p>
<p>( PM cont): away prejudice. That's a long educative process<br />
and that's why we're going to be having this three year<br />
program, a community program, to try and eliminate or<br />
drastically reduce those things. The idea in an act would<br />
be to define both the ambit and the limits of<br />
multiculturalism, probably to include within it the fact of<br />
English as a national language. Maybe also of provisions<br />
against racial vilification. Now those things are<br />
significant.<br />
MURPHY: You could be looking at those things?<br />
PM: Yes, I believe so but I want the community come along<br />
and understand that these things will make for a better<br />
community.<br />
MURPHY: Yes. on that matter of prejudice, do you think<br />
there is the threat of the backlash amongst, if you like,<br />
old Australians? Do you think the whole concept of<br />
multiculturalism still sadly is just not understood by the<br />
majority of this population?<br />
PM: No, I think the majority understand it. But it is<br />
true, it would be just stupid, Paul, to ignore the fact that<br />
there is prejudice out there and ignorance. But I was so<br />
thrilled, for instance, today to hear a man like Sir<br />
William Keys, widely respected ex-President, National<br />
President of the RSL, taking that issue head on saying the<br />
attitudes of the past, founded in a different society when<br />
percent were of Anglo-Celtic background, now less than<br />
percent. He said the world is different, Australia is<br />
different, the region is different, the world is different.<br />
We've got to face up to those facts. The worst thing, I<br />
mean, I say this to any of your listeners, your viewers, who<br />
have some of that prejudice if you want to do the worst<br />
possible thing for your kids, it is to refuse to recognise<br />
the fact that we are a multicultural society, that we are<br />
part of a region which is going to determine our future<br />
economic welfare. If we act in a way both internally and in<br />
our relations with others in a way which assumes that one<br />
colour is better than another or we are superior to someone<br />
else because of the hue of our skin, then that's the worst<br />
thing you can do for your kids because you'll condemn them<br />
to a significantly lesser economic future. I<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, you've already said that you're<br />
extending SBS. Would you like to see ads on SBS?<br />
PM: Well I don't think it's a question of what I'd like to<br />
see. What we're going to do is to a) provide legislation to<br />
give a distinct, unique legislative background and identity<br />
and justification for SBS. Secondly, we're going to provide<br />
a charter. Now, I'm not going to lay down that charter,<br />
we're going to have community consultation. Now if out of </p>
<p>( PM cont): those processes they want to be more definite<br />
about sponsorship possibilities, then that's up to them.<br />
I'm not going to try and impose it. It is the fact of<br />
course that now, as you know, SBS can have some sponsorship<br />
and I understand in that way they're going to get the world<br />
cup.<br />
MURPHY: Indeed.<br />
PM: So, the concept of sponsorship is there. It's how<br />
people may want to develop it.<br />
MURPHY: Will it always stay it's own entity or could it be<br />
amalgamated in the future with the ABC?<br />
PM: No, we've been there, had that discussion and the point<br />
of the legislation to give it's distinctive legislation its<br />
own charter is to put that fear to rest.<br />
MURPHY: Alright Prime Minister. Before I let you go I'd be<br />
delinquent if I didn't ask you about the CPI figures. Up by<br />
2.4 to 7.6 so far, well above the Treasurer's prediction.<br />
Have you misjudged just how strong this economy is?<br />
PM: But remember, the Treasurer's prediction for what the<br />
annual rate was made before the floods. I mean, every<br />
commentator expected and understood that the June quarter<br />
figure would be affected by the impact of the floods on food<br />
prices. So, I mean, there are lots of things that I can,<br />
with Paul Keating, that we can control and regulate, but<br />
really that's a bit difficult.<br />
MURPHY: Beyond you.<br />
S PM: Yes.<br />
MURPHY: But, well, is it a good result? I mean, are you<br />
heartened by this<br />
PM: Well, you can never be heartened by it but knowing that<br />
the explanation of it, then I can understand it. Obviously<br />
I wish we hadn't had the floods, both for the adverse impact<br />
it had on people at the time and the impact it's had on<br />
prices. But my belief is that we've got the essential<br />
settings right. I mean we've got a wages policy, a<br />
wages-tax trade-off which will mean that the underlying rate<br />
of inflation will be coming down.<br />
MURPHY: It doesn't indicate, does it that consumer demand<br />
is even stronger than you and your colleagues thought?<br />
PM:. No, no. It doesn't indicate that at all.<br />
MURPHY: OK, Prime minister, many thanks indeed for speaking<br />
to us.<br />
ends </p>
