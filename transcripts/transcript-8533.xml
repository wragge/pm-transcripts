TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MAXINE MCKEW ON ABC PM<br />
CANBERRA, 3 JUNE 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MM4: Mr Keating David Hill obviously feels that you<br />
effectively excluded the ABC..<br />
PM: Well we haven't. We have explicitly included them<br />
in the fifth and sixth transponders.<br />
MM: But they are out of one to four?<br />
PM: Well they are out of one to four, because I think<br />
everybody is tired of the old faded and jaded<br />
players, they want some new entrants in the<br />
Australian media. That's what the Caucus wanted,<br />
they wanted a new media player who has not had its<br />
antecedents in the newspapers, or an existing<br />
television networks, but a new set of players. And<br />
the arrangement the Government has now introduced,<br />
or will be introducing, is for the first four<br />
transponders, we'll see in a new medium of media, a<br />
new set of players.<br />
MM: Mr Keating, you weren't talking about faded, jaded<br />
players on Sunday when you said that they could have<br />
a 45 per cent level of ownership in the first four<br />
channels. What has made you change your mind?<br />
PM: Well nothing. What I have done, Mr Hill said that I<br />
had somersaulted, yes I have somersaulted upwards, I<br />
have taken 45 per cent higher to infinity.<br />
MM: That's one way of looking at it.<br />
PM: Well it is the only way of looking at it. 45 per<br />
cent has now become 100. </p>
<p>MM: But two days ago you were quite specific, 45 per<br />
cent when the Caucus hadn't been even imagining<br />
that, they talked you down, did they not, to 35 per<br />
cent yesterday.<br />
PM: We have all got to play the game in whatever field<br />
of endeavour we are in, in these'sorts of issues, in<br />
organising our bargaining positions. Now, I was<br />
quite prepared, frankly who is going to be in a<br />
network, in a four transponder system, probably with<br />
a sunk cost of $ 4 500 million for 15 per cent<br />
equity. That was 45 overall for the networks,<br />
individually, who is going to be in it, who would<br />
bother taking on the management?<br />
MM: Well fine, I mean you changed your mind, you were<br />
talking about new players for five and six on<br />
Sunday.<br />
PM: No, no, I have changed my mind.<br />
MM: Now you have twisted that around.<br />
PM: Yes for a superior outcome. A superior outcome,<br />
because what we have got now is the best of all<br />
worlds, we can have satellite and plastic dish<br />
technology for the four, let's call it the<br />
entertainment segment, but we can go to the<br />
sophisticated fibre optic and other sophisticated<br />
technologies on five and six. So Australia gets the<br />
best of all worlds instead of closing of f. David<br />
called it exclusivity, he thought it was a wise<br />
course. Well the beneficiaries of regulation always<br />
say regulation is wise, but that would have closed<br />
off to Australia the higher technology of fibre<br />
optics and MDS in favour of plastic dishes and<br />
satellites for a decade. I was never prepared as<br />
Prime Minister to shut that technology of f.<br />
MM: Alright, does it mean that one to four stuck with<br />
the old inferior technology?<br />
PM: No, it stuck with a limited technology, but an<br />
immediately applicable technology.<br />
MM: But does that mean then it will be a less viable<br />
option for those people who are interested in<br />
channels one to four?<br />
MM: No, no not in the things that they want to do with<br />
it. That's blockbuster movies, sport, news. But<br />
five and six can get into interactive-services<br />
that is taking your banking to your house.<br />
MM: That's a long way off isn't it?<br />
PM: No, no. </p>
<p>MM: 1 People are saying that that sort of technology is<br />
say 15 years away?<br />
PM: No, no it is only as far off as the cable under the<br />
fence, under the front fence, and if somebody can<br />
af ford to do it on the basis of an entertainment<br />
dimension, as well as then going beyond interactive<br />
services like banking, like buying your household<br />
goods and what have you, or the capacity for fibre<br />
to put many more channels into a house for<br />
educational channels, or the arts, or a voice for<br />
the trade unions or whatever it might be, they are<br />
in the higher orders of much greater capital<br />
intensification because the cost of wiring up the<br />
capital cities is probably $ 3 5 billion. So the<br />
channels five to six can be a very high cost option,<br />
or if the ABC for instance were to be successful in<br />
bidding for either 100 per cent of, or part there<br />
of, of transponders five or six, it can find itself<br />
in a very advantageous position in the media.<br />
MM: Well you are making $ 12.5 million available, but<br />
David Hill would argue that they are not in the race<br />
with Kerry Packer, surely having the.-foot in the<br />
door, with say all of channel five or channel six.<br />
PM: Yes but David speaks before he understands the<br />
policy. Packer or any of them can't bid for five<br />
and six, only for one of the two of them. So if the<br />
ABC bids for one, for instance, it may be the one<br />
that one of the other networks are bidding for which<br />
leaves another one to be open to be capable of being<br />
bidded. Do you understand?<br />
MM2: Well, yes, but you surely haven't introduced that<br />
many new players at the moment, as you say Kerry<br />
Packer could have either five or six, he has already<br />
got to free to air, and he will have the five or<br />
six, which as you say is the superior technology.<br />
That's greater concentration isn't it?<br />
PM: No, no. How could you call it greater<br />
concentration, we are going to have four channels<br />
which is going to have no current media operater in<br />
it.<br />
MM: OK, well David Hill's further point there is. to say<br />
that will be dominated by the Americans?<br />
PM: OK Maxine, look I know, let me say this. The game<br />
has moved to fast for David today, I mean he is<br />
having trouble catching up with the detail of this.<br />
I don't mind noisy, voluble quango leaders good<br />
on them. But let's not think there is any<br />
revolution out there for the ABC having 15 per cent<br />
of a satellite Pay television entertainment<br />
operation. I mean there is no great revolution in<br />
that. Whereas in five and six there is a capacity </p>
<p>4<br />
for real innovation, clever technology, and for<br />
thoughtful people. And that's what the ABC should<br />
do now get the thinking cap on and get the<br />
sticking plaster out and come up with a policy, and<br />
then maybe the ABC will realise that the Government<br />
has done it a favour in giving it a chance it<br />
basically didn't have to give it. Under the ABC's<br />
national charter there is no cause why the<br />
Government needed to be persuaded that the ABC had<br />
any role in Pay television. We have given it the<br />
benefit of the doubt.<br />
MM: Alright. Who are the new bidders do you think<br />
outside the current players, who are the new bidders<br />
who will be interested in channels one to four?<br />
PM: Well I think, obviously the people who run the<br />
picture theatres, you know the Village Roadshow type<br />
companies, people in radio, suppliers of product.<br />
MM: They won't be put of f do you think by the lack of<br />
exclusivity?<br />
PM: No, I mean it's a great opportunity for them, they<br />
have removed the other strong bidders, the networks,<br />
they're gone, we have taken them away.<br />
MM: And there's no chance you would increase the level<br />
of foreign ownership if say the level of Australian<br />
interest was less then you expect? You wouldn't go<br />
beyond that 35 per cent?<br />
PM: No, that's 20 for any single interest and 35 over<br />
all. So there is no worry about it being spooked by<br />
foreigners, I mean you know.<br />
MM: Well it's just that the Democrats already fear that<br />
the next step, maybe we will have to have more<br />
foreign ownership?<br />
PM: Well I mean, David Hill I am sure would like people<br />
to believe the ABC is enlightened, but what it really<br />
wants is a home town clubby decision where there are no<br />
foreigners and they can sit under a bit of regulation and<br />
find themselves a niche market provided by the<br />
Government. Well things are just not that easy in 1992.<br />
MM: Prime Minister thank you very much indeed.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
