PRIME MINISTER<br />
** CHECK AGAINST DELI VERY"*<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN NURSING FEDERATION FEDERAL DELEGATES<br />
CONFERENCE, CANBERRA, 26 OCTOBER 1995<br />
It is an honour to be asked to address the 11 th Biennial Australian Nurses<br />
Federation Conference.<br />
I have been talking to nurses quite a lot lately at Ballarat yesterday, and in<br />
Perth a couple of weeks ago.<br />
And this is not just because I believe that nurses do some of the most<br />
important work in our communities, although I do think that. Nurses provide<br />
-the most important ingredient of any civilised society, any decent community<br />
and, I think it is fair to say, any successful health system. They provide care.<br />
How as a society we treat nurses is therefore a measure of how much we<br />
value care. It is a measure of what we mean by " civilised", by " decent", and<br />
" 1successful".<br />
To take nurses for granted is to compromise those values. To actually cut<br />
into their pay and conditions speaks of abandoning them altogether.<br />
Something similar can be said, I think, about the present fashion for<br />
privatising health services, including ambulance services.<br />
A great many things can be done equally as well by private interests, but<br />
where the people's health is involved there are very clear lines to be drawn.<br />
The people's health should never be subject to ideological fashion or<br />
obsession. It should never be placed at the mercy of no other consideration<br />
than the bottom line.<br />
On these things on the pay and conditions of nursing, on cost cutting and<br />
privatisation in health there is a very significant national debate now raging.<br />
Ar. </p>
<p>At present, the antagonists are the Commonwealth Government and the<br />
conservative state governments. I can tell you now that the Commonwealth<br />
Government will do all it can to protect nurses against state governments like<br />
the one in Western Australia.<br />
The industrial relations policies of the conservative States and the health<br />
policies of the conservative States are of the same ilk. They are related.<br />
They come from the same family of thought.<br />
And, needless to say, the conservative States and the Coalition come from<br />
the same family too. So what we see happening in the conservative States<br />
we can expect from a conservative Coalition. In fact, there are indications<br />
that a Federal Coalition government would hand over much more<br />
responsibility for health to the States.<br />
That is why this debate is so important. It is a debate about not just the<br />
fundamentals of health care or even just the fundamentals of industrial<br />
relations and fair wages it is a debate about the kind of society we want<br />
Australia to be.<br />
If this strikes you as a political speech, you are probably right. There is a<br />
great deal at stake, and the fact is we can only defend the things we have<br />
won and the things we believe in by winning the political debate.<br />
As I said the battles at present are being fought out in the conservative<br />
States. In the conservative States there have been particularly poor dealings<br />
between nurses and those State governments. For example, in Western<br />
Australia and South Australia, the second safety net adjustment of just $ 8 a<br />
week has still not been paid.<br />
Nurses in conservative States have received almost no pay increases for<br />
several years.<br />
This has meant that many thousands of nurses have experienced cuts in the<br />
purchasing power of their pay. Nursing is one of the very few occupations to<br />
have had this experience over recent years.<br />
The lack of empathy for and understanding of nurses' needs led the<br />
Government to make an important decision.<br />
We decided to support a Special Case before the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission on nurses' pay.<br />
This is an Accord commitment to guarantee wage justice for nurses in<br />
conservative States and it should be noted that it is very rare for a specific<br />
occupation to be identified as in need of help in the eight Accords negotiated<br />
with the ACTU. </p>
<p>It speaks volumes for the Accord and, I think, for the difference between<br />
Labor and the Coalition.<br />
Some might say, that's well and good for nurses working in conservative<br />
States, but it's a relatively minor issue, isn't it?<br />
In fact, it is a major issue for all Australian nurses.<br />
It is a major issue because the vast majority of nurses are covered by the<br />
Federal system, and this is where the current industrial relations debate<br />
really matters.<br />
It is a major issue for all workers simply because the Coalition will radically<br />
alter the Federal awards, and that will mean reductions in pay and conditions<br />
for nurses.<br />
The big point and it is a very big point for nurses is that the Coalition's<br />
policy does not guarantee workers' pay. The value of penalty rates, and<br />
overtime, and holiday loadings, among other allowances, will disappear.<br />
When I was in Western Australia I illustrated what this might mean for the<br />
earnings of nurses and, I must say, there were some signs of shock at the<br />
extent of what could happen.<br />
How much pay is involved? Let's have a look at some facts.<br />
Currently working nightshifts typically pays about 15 per cent more than the<br />
day rate, or about $ 15 a night extra. The Coalition's policy means that the<br />
nightshift can be paid at the day rate.<br />
Most nurses who work full-time work some nights and some weekends every<br />
year. For weekends there is at least a time and half penalty rate.<br />
Taking away the penalties and the holiday loading costs the average nurse<br />
around $ 5000 a year. This is a typical nurse, not a special case. $ 5000 a<br />
year. Typical nurses have typical needs. Typical family needs, typical recreation<br />
needs, typical financial commitments. Cut nurses' pay cut anyone's pay<br />
and you cut into their standard of living, into their hopes and expectations,<br />
into their opportunities and opportunities for their children.<br />
Cut nurses' pay and you cut into the quality of health care and the fabric of<br />
communities. Cut nurses' pay and you cut into the basic values of Australian<br />
society. </p>
<p>That is why I have said so often about John Howard and to John Howard<br />
you cannot pretend to stand for families and communities and the decent<br />
values which bind them together and also stand for low wages and wage<br />
cuts. Even if you put aside all the obvious moral judgements to be made, it makes<br />
no logical sense.<br />
Now I don't know whether Australian nurses think of themselves as " battlers".<br />
I prefer nurses myself. But if nurses are battling now, they would be battling<br />
a lot more if a Coalition government were elected and applied the same<br />
policies as Western Australia is applying.<br />
A Federal Coalition government will mean pay cuts of over 20 per cent of<br />
incomes. About $ 100 a week.<br />
The Coalition says that this is a fantasy, that it just won't happen, that it's just<br />
a scare campaign.<br />
Of course, the Coalition would have the Australian public believe that any<br />
questioning or criticism of their intentions to draw the merest negative<br />
inference from their past policies or their present lack of them is a scare<br />
campaign.<br />
They say that anyone who wants to stay on the awards can choose to do so.<br />
But this is not how things work.<br />
And it is not what most nurses will experience.<br />
A huge number of people and a very large number of nurses move into<br />
new jobs every year.<br />
How will these nurses be able to " choose" to stay on an award with penalties<br />
and holiday loadings if such conditions aren't offered as part of the job? After<br />
all, there can't be a choice if the employer doesn't want to offer it. And there<br />
is no effective way a government could insist on this.<br />
In 1994, 1.73 million workers took a job with a new employer, and there were<br />
many nurses among them.<br />
Several hundred thousand of the 1.73 million had just finished higher<br />
education, and there were many nurses in this group.<br />
Around 400,000 were married women returning to the labour force, and many<br />
of them were nurses. 4' </p>
<p>A large number would be workers including nurses who have moved for<br />
any number of essential reasons. Australians often have to move. It is a<br />
pretty basic necessity, and a pretty basic freedom: attach to it the penalty of<br />
significantly lower wages and less security and that freedom is pretty<br />
seriously compromised.<br />
So how many nurses face a new employer each year and would thus, under a<br />
Coalition government, have no effective choice about keeping penalties,<br />
overtime, holiday loadings and other allowances?<br />
In 1994 the number was 32,387 about 22 per cent of all registered nurses.<br />
In just one year.<br />
10,897 of these nurses were women aged between 25 and 34. That's 31 per<br />
cent of all female registered nurses in this age group.<br />
About 1 in every 3 of this group, and just in the course of one year. This<br />
means that the maeority of nurses would have faced a new employer within<br />
just a few years.<br />
And it's not just the nurses facing a new employer who have things to worry<br />
about with the Coalition.<br />
What's to stop an employer even a Federal government employer from<br />
reducing pay and conditions when nurses' contracts without penalties expire?<br />
What's to stop an employer giving preferred working hours to nurses who are<br />
prepared to take the contract instead of the award?<br />
What's to stop an employer offering promotions to those who are willing<br />
initially to move off the award?<br />
And what's to stop an employer from eventually decreasing pay for workers<br />
on contracts without penalties who will find themselves unable to get back<br />
onto the award?<br />
The answer is, nothing.<br />
In bringing these issues to public attention it must be recognised that what<br />
happens to nurses' pay is not just an issue for nurses.<br />
It is a reflection of what can happen to the majority of Australian workers.<br />
And it is a symbol of the essential differences in the sorts of societies valued<br />
by the Government and the Coalition.<br />
This Government will continue to protect the bargaining position of all<br />
workers. </p>
<p>The Government, through its Accord commitments, has worked to ensure that<br />
not only is Australia a place of reform, but also a country in which the welfare<br />
of families is assured.<br />
We say that the best way to ensure the income of families, particularly<br />
working families with children, is through the maintenance of the value of<br />
award conditions.<br />
Our opponents have long made it abundantly clear that they do not value the<br />
Accord and the consensual philosophy on which it is built, or the award<br />
wages system which is in many ways its expression.<br />
They are committed to doing away with both.<br />
That puts at risk our social cohesion, the very nature of our society.<br />
This is evident in more fields than industrial relations, of course. But<br />
industrial relations are the most basic of relations the relations of work and<br />
how we conduct them determines the most basic of our needs and the most<br />
basic characteristics of our society.<br />
That is why I say that this industrial relations debate is so important.<br />
It is why I say the Government must win it.<br />
We also have to win on health.<br />
Labors health policy is built on Medicare universal access to quality health<br />
care. Medicare is affordable, simple and accessible. And, unlike many other<br />
countries, we do this while maintaining spending on health at a sustainable<br />
per cent of GDP.<br />
As front line health workers, nurses are the guardians of Medicare. Nurses<br />
ensure that Medicare means quality care that is efficiently and<br />
compassionately delivered.<br />
A recent survey shows that 88 per cent of Australians are satisfied with<br />
Medicare very few government programs ever reach this level of public<br />
support. And a decade ago the figure was only 44 per cent.<br />
The Government is very proud of this, and you should be too. Because the<br />
best policy in the world will flounder without dedicated and skilled people to<br />
put it into place.<br />
So popular is Medicare that John Howard now says that he also is a<br />
supporter of Medicare. </p>
<p>Just a few years ago he described it as " a great failure"; " an absolute<br />
nightmare"; " a total disaster".<br />
And back in the 1970s he was part of the government team which dismantled<br />
Medibank when that was the name of the national health scheme even<br />
though they had promised the Australian people they would keep it.<br />
This is the same man who was happy to leave 2 million people without any<br />
health insurance.<br />
The same man who voted twice against universal bulkbilling in the Australian<br />
Parliament.<br />
The same man who went to the last election with yet another policy to abolish<br />
Medicare. Some people say I am unfair to disbelieve Howard's change of mind.<br />
I say that for John Howard to support Medicare he would need more than a<br />
change of mind. He would need a change of mind and heart and<br />
fundamental values. He would need a transplant of proportions which are<br />
beyond the reach of both science and credibility.<br />
But more than that, he would need a change of Party.<br />
Because the Liberal Party has never supported public health. They have<br />
never lined up with those who down the years have argued for the right of all<br />
Australians for access to free, public health care.<br />
They went to the last election with a health policy which the AMA described<br />
as " music to the ears".<br />
The ears of the AMA three years ago were pretty well all on the right of<br />
course. They included those attached to the now endorsed Liberal candidate<br />
for the safe seat of Bradfield.<br />
It was reported at the weekend that Mr Nelson is keen to have a say in the<br />
development of the Liberals' health policy. He is also on the record as saying<br />
that bulkbilling should go.<br />
Mind you, he said as recently as May this year, " I don't know what the Liberal<br />
Party's health policy is, and if you do, could you please let me know'. In<br />
doing so, of course, he gave voice to what has become pretty well a national<br />
refrain. But we know that, at its core, the Liberal's health policy will always support<br />
private health over public health.<br />
rC -7N </p>
<p>And if you doubt this, you only have to look at what the State Liberal<br />
Governments are doing to public health.<br />
Jeff Kennett has cut $ 260 million a year out of public health, and plans to<br />
close two public hospitals in the La Trobe Valley and replace them with a<br />
private hospital.<br />
Dean Brown in South Australia reduced health expenditure by $ 35 million last<br />
year and has plans to cut a further $ 35 million over the next two years and<br />
privatise public hospitals.<br />
Ray Groom in Tasmania has privatised the Mercy Hospital.<br />
And, of course, Richard Court has an agenda for widespread privatisation of<br />
the public health system in Western Australia.<br />
All around the country, Liberal Governments are cutting funding and<br />
privatising hospitals. And, in Victoria, even ambulance services.<br />
If John Howard wants to persuade us that he has changed his mind, that he<br />
does really believe in Medicare, that he does really believe in the public<br />
health system, there is one simple thing he can do for a start.<br />
He can condemn the actions of his colleagues in those conservative State<br />
governments who are slashing public health.<br />
If John Howard wants us to believe that he is going to break with the Liberal<br />
tradition of Medicare bashing a tradition he supported in the Fraser<br />
Government, a position he supported at the last election never was there a<br />
better opportunity to demonstrate it.<br />
He can disown the policies of Jeff Kennett, Dean Brown, Ray Groom and<br />
Richard Court. He can tell them they are wrong.<br />
Over the past two years, the Commonwealth has increased health funding to<br />
the States by about $ 800 million. At the same time, the States have cut more<br />
than $ 700 million from public health. He can tell them to put it back.<br />
But maybe taking a stand for public health sounds too much like taking a<br />
policy position.<br />
It strikes me as strange that the only health policy we have heard from John<br />
Howard is that he intends to give tax incentives to encourage people to take<br />
out private health insurance.<br />
Tax deductions for private health insurance would cost over $ 1 billion.<br />
So he is going to show his support for Medicare, for public health, by giving a<br />
billion dollars to the private health system. </p>
<p>This is a novel way to show support.<br />
If you want to improve the public health system, why would you give a billion<br />
dollars to the private health system?<br />
Why is he doing this?<br />
Is he doing this because he thinks the private health system needs support?<br />
But over the past five years, there has been an increase in patients using<br />
private hospitals. Admissions to private hospitals as a proportion of total<br />
admissions has also increased, as have the reserves of the private health<br />
insurance industry from $ 991 million in 1991-92 to over $ 1.35 billion now an<br />
increase of 36 per cent.<br />
At the same time, average premiums for private health insurance have<br />
increased by 40 per cent in real terms.<br />
It doesn't sound like the private funds need an injection of $ 1 billion to stay<br />
solvent. He can't be doing this because he thinks that private insurance is more<br />
efficient than Medicare. The administrative costs of private health funds are<br />
11.6 per cent of the benefits paid, compared with only 3.5 per cent for the<br />
Government's Health Insurance Commission.<br />
In fact, a shift to private health insurance would lead to a less efficient and<br />
more costly health system. Overall, health costs are likely to increase<br />
because of higher administrative costs, fewer controls on over-servicing and<br />
the reluctance of private health funds to encourage cost-containment in<br />
private hospitals.<br />
We would end up with more, not fewer, resources being spent on health care.<br />
And you don't have to take my word for it this is the view of respected health<br />
economists such as Jeff Richardson, Richard Scotton, John Deeble, Stephen<br />
Leeder and Kevin Forde.<br />
The evidence could scarcely be clearer. In the United States the introduction<br />
of tax subsidies for private health insurance caused an increased demand for<br />
medical services. It was a major cause of the rapid escalation of medical<br />
costs in the US.<br />
Tax subsidies for health insurance would also assist specialists to raise their<br />
fees. Specialists have made it clear that the existing system holds their fees<br />
down. </p>
<p>John Howard wants more people to take out private health insurance. But<br />
let's be very clear that this would mean that those families and individuals<br />
who took up private insurance would pay more for health care than they do<br />
today. They would have to pay the difference between the tax subsidy and the cost<br />
of private insurance. And they would have to pay the high cost of gap fees<br />
charged for private hospital care.<br />
His policy is simply cost-shifting. Under the Coalition, the cost of health care<br />
would be shifted from government to the people. Patients would pay more.<br />
And who would get the extra money?<br />
Private hospitals, specialists working in private hospitals and the private<br />
health insurance funds.<br />
The private health system, not the public health system.<br />
In short, the Coalition would deliver neither an efficient nor an equitable<br />
means of solving health care problems. The major beneficiaries of the tax<br />
subsidies would be tax-payers who already have private health insurance<br />
people who we know are more likely to be higher income earners.<br />
The real danger is that a two-tiered health system will develop a rich,<br />
privately funded health system alongside a poor, publicly funded system.<br />
Coalition thinking on health, like their thinking on so much else, betrays a<br />
strange magnetic attraction to the example of the United States. Yet,<br />
America's health system costs nearly twice as much as Australia's and it is<br />
based on sharp distinctions. It treats the well-off privately insured person<br />
very differently from the publicly-insured and uninsured poor people.<br />
As I said in my speech to the nurses in Western Australian, the fundamentals<br />
of health care are not negotiable in the market place the core of the health<br />
system, along with education and other essential human services, resides in<br />
the public sphere. It is the responsibility of communities and governments.<br />
One of the challenges of the public health system is patient waiting lists for<br />
hospital admission.<br />
Our best estimate of the number of patients on waiting lists is between<br />
100,000 and 120,000 at any point in time.<br />
It is not to in any way play down the need to solve this problem to put it in<br />
perspective in fact, only by getting it in perspective will we get the solution<br />
right. -= 7 </p>
<p>There are four million admissions to public hospitals each year in Australia,<br />
about 11,000 a day. So patients on waiting lists make up about 3 per cent of<br />
the total load on the public hospital system. And of the 120,000, 15,000<br />
require surgery within 30 days and 20,000 within a year. These are the<br />
people we have to target.<br />
Many of the other patients are counted on waiting lists because they may at<br />
some later stage need hospitalisation for a condition which does not respond<br />
to other treatments.<br />
I make these points to demonstrate that the solution to waiting lists is not<br />
beyond us. It is within our means. And it lies primarily in the public health<br />
system. It does not lie in giving tax concessions for people to take out private health<br />
insurance. It is folly to think that people who take out private health insurance will only<br />
seek treatment in private hospitals, and thus free up public hospitals. In fact,<br />
many sophisticated procedures are only carried out in public hospitals. And<br />
most people, even Kerry Packer, when involved in an accident or an<br />
emergency, are treated in public hospitals.<br />
Since 1992-93, the Government has provided some $ 88 million additional<br />
funds to the States to reduce waiting times for elective surgery.<br />
The Commonwealth is also funding demonstration models of public hospitals<br />
which have best practice approaches to waiting time management to improve<br />
the delivery of service to patients.<br />
And in this years Budget, the Government provided extra funding to the<br />
States to reduce waiting lists for public patients. Under the new<br />
arrangements, specific targets will be set for waiting times for elective surgery<br />
and for access to accident and emergency care.<br />
We are serious about improving waiting lists. But are the States? Is John<br />
Howard? How serious can the State Governments be about reducing waiting lists if<br />
they cut funding for public hospitals? Jeff Kennett's cut of $ 260 million a year<br />
alone would fund an extra six public hospitals.<br />
How serious can John Howard be about supporting public health if he not<br />
only does not condemn these cuts, but advocates giving $ 1 billion to the<br />
private health system $ 1 billion which would more than pay for the treatment<br />
of all the people on the waiting lists for public hospitals?<br />
I am justified, we are all justified, in disbelieving John Howard's claim to<br />
support public health. </p>
<p>His record shows he is not to be trusted. He has voted against Medicare, he<br />
has campaigned against Medicare. His Party in government at the State and<br />
Federal level has consistently cut funding for public health.<br />
And his proposal for tax concessions for private health insurance shows he<br />
remains a supporter of private health at the expense of public health.<br />
As I said at the beginning, the two issues of support for public health and<br />
support for the wages and working conditions of nurses are inherently linked.<br />
If you support Medicare, you must support the front line workers who deliver<br />
the care and who make the system work. You cannot expect to maintain a<br />
quality health care system if you do not give fair and just reward to nurses for<br />
their expertise and dedication.<br />
And you cannot expect to be believed when you say you support public<br />
health if in the course of your public life you have done little but oppose it,<br />
and your colleagues in the States are just now busily tearing into it.<br />
Labor built Medicare. We have always believed in the right of all Australians<br />
to free hospital care. We have always supported public health. We have<br />
made the building and maintenance of a great public health system one of<br />
the foundations of a fair society an essential and defining element of<br />
Australia's modern democracy.<br />
And because Australia's nurses are an essential and defining element in this<br />
great equation, we will support you. </p>
