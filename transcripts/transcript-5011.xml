CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA_ 5 APRIL 1979<br />
AUSTRALIAN 1988 BICENTENARY<br />
1988 will be the Bicentenary of the first European settlement<br />
in Australia.. In June 1978, the Premiers' Conference agreed<br />
that there should be a major commemoration of Australia's<br />
Bicentenary. Following this decision, there has been<br />
consultation between the Commonwealth, States and the<br />
Northern Territory to devise and agree on a framework<br />
of administrative arrangements by which an Australian<br />
Bicentennial Authority can be-established.<br />
The Authority will be responsible for the planning and staging<br />
of this historic commemoration. As befits a national endeavour<br />
of this kind, the commitment to it will be completely<br />
bi-partisan. The Authority, therefore, will be a joint<br />
organisation of seventeen members: seven appointed by the<br />
Commonwealth; seven appointed by the States and the<br />
Northern Territory; two members drawn respectively from the<br />
Government and the Opposition in Federal Parliament; and<br />
with a Chairman appointed by the Commonwealth.<br />
I am pleased to be able to inform the House that Mr. John Reid<br />
has agreed to serve as the Chairman. His work and reputation<br />
will be known to many Members. He is a businessman<br />
and administrator of outstanding calibre. I am in no doubt<br />
that under his experienced and forceful guidance, the Authority<br />
will be established on-a sound, businesslike footing, and<br />
that he will handle the task he has been given with<br />
distinction. The Authority will be established administratively, as<br />
a company incorporated in the A. C. T. There will be companion<br />
legislation of a general kind to identify the status and role<br />
of the Authority and guarantee its autonomy and continuity.<br />
Such an arrangement will confer an appropriate degree of<br />
independence and flexibility so that the Authority can cope<br />
with changing requirements during the next decade.<br />
The structure envisaged will enable the Authority to operate<br />
expeditiously in a business-like way, and will facilitate<br />
such operations as licensing, franchising and normal<br />
commercial agreements. / 12 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
At the same time, the Authority will be accountable to<br />
the Parliament through the Minister for Administrative<br />
Services who will consult, as necessary, with the<br />
appropriate Minister in each of the States and in<br />
the Northern Territory.<br />
The Authority's accounts will be subject to audit by<br />
the Auditor-General. Any appropriation by the Parliament<br />
for the purposes of the Authority will be subject to<br />
the normal Parliamentary scrutiny. The Authority will also<br />
be required to submit an Annual Report to the Parliament.<br />
The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Authority<br />
and, as appropriate, the companion legislation, will give<br />
effect to the Government's wishes in this regard.<br />
The Authority will have both advising and operational roles.<br />
In its advising role it will be required at an early date<br />
to make recommendations in relation to a " theme" and a<br />
" focus" for the celebrations and on the matter of<br />
international participation. Generally, it will be empowered<br />
to do all things necessary for the successful prosecution of<br />
the role given to it by the Governments and the objectives<br />
specifified in its charter.<br />
The charter will be expressed in an appropriately drawn<br />
Memorandum and Articles of Association designed to provide the<br />
desired wide ambit of activity and authority within the<br />
administrative framework I have indicated, subject, of<br />
course, to the decisions of Governments in relation to policy.<br />
The Bicentenary will be a most important event for Australia.<br />
Deep in any human community is consciousness of its origins and<br />
identity and its hopes and resolutions for the future, a<br />
consciousness to which it will want to return and dwell upon<br />
at particular moments in its history. The marking of a<br />
Bicentenary is one such time.<br />
It will be a time for calling to mind the achievements<br />
throughout this country and by its people over two centuries.<br />
It will be a time to reflect upon our developing and changing<br />
national entity as a united community transformed in a<br />
remarkable way by the migration programmes of the years<br />
since World War II. It will be a time for weighing the<br />
opportunities and the challenges that lie ahead and for<br />
considering our place in the world community.<br />
It will, as I have said, be a matter for the Authority to<br />
propose for the consideration of Governments a theme and a<br />
focus for the celebrations and in doing this, it will need<br />
to draw upon the ideas of highly imaginative and creative<br />
people within our community. It will be for the Authority<br />
to recommend that concrete programmes by which the commemoration<br />
will find expression. o. .3 </p>
<p>3<br />
In the drawing of these programmes, and for their<br />
discharge the Authority will, as far as practicable,<br />
be seeking to devolve responsibility and initiative to<br />
State, Municipal and Local Governments. As well, the<br />
Authority will be seeking to involve all sections and<br />
members of the community individually and collectively.<br />
It will look to encourage initiatives at the grass roots.<br />
Within these programmes there will no doubt be a strong<br />
emphasis on history. This must under-pin any such<br />
commemoration. We are now embarking on an exciting and<br />
challenging project for the nation and I commend it<br />
to Honourable Members for their support.<br />
