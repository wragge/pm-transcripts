PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOW1~ BDIA~ 16 NOVEM'BER 1981<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE 1981 BUIAJETIN/ QANTAS<br />
AWARD FOR AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS11OMAN OF THE YEAR<br />
I am pleased indeed to be here to pr'esent the fourth Businesswomnn<br />
of the Year Award because it is an award which highlights the<br />
contribution whichwomen are mak~ ing in business and so it helps<br />
to reflect? the social transformation in Australia in terms of<br />
opening up -and diversifying opportunities for women.<br />
Virginia Woolf, was on'ce 6 Ãµ kid to speak about her experiences<br />
as a working woman and she seemied to think that she had cheated<br />
because she felt that she had not really made any sort of conscious<br />
decision to write for money. As she put it, she becamne a<br />
journalist simply as a result of posting off to a magazine editor,<br />
without really having any serious hopes of s~ iccess, a few Ra<br />
~ heciue<br />
even though it'was only for one pound ten and sixpence, and she<br />
says that what she bought with the proceeds was a perisian cat.<br />
But then, as she said, " I grew ambitious. A persian cat is<br />
all very well, but a persian cat is not enough. I must have a<br />
motor car... And thus it was that I became a novelist for it<br />
is a very strange thing that people will give you a motor car<br />
if you will tell them a story'.<br />
I don't know whether there is any moral in this story but I have<br />
no doubt that her story underestimates -the hard work~ and<br />
determination that she and other women including many applicants<br />
for this award have had to-put into winning'krooms of your<br />
own in the house hitherto exclusaively owned by men."<br />
There is obviously a great deal that can he said on the subject<br />
of equality of emxploymnent opportunity in our community but one<br />
matter on which there is surely no. doubt is that every future<br />
history of our times will give a significant. place to the<br />
subject of women in the workforce. In some respects, it would<br />
have to be 6aid that substantial strides have been taken<br />
towards equality of opportunity and greater freedom in the<br />
employment system, </p>
<p>Let me mention a few figures. The number of women in administrative,<br />
executive and managerial positions has increased by<br />
40% to over 53i00O in the 10 years to' 1980 and the number<br />
of women inl professional and technical p~ sitions has increased<br />
by almnost 90%, to more than 420,000 in the same period.<br />
Overall female employment grew by 29% over the same 10 year<br />
period compared to 12% growth in male employment.<br />
But there* are other figures v', hichpaint a more disappointing<br />
picture of progress towards the objective of equality of<br />
opportunity. Despite the 40% increahE' that I have mentioned<br />
women now fill * onl'y 14% of adminiistrative, executive and<br />
managerial positions and although women comprise almost<br />
of the workforce, there is an unnatural ccincentr'atiof of2 .% qmenr.<br />
in a narrow ranae of iobs. Fnr Rua2mnp 629-are. in ___ ial<br />
saIea and service -occupations-and last year, women made up<br />
less than half of 1% of those in apprenticeship training ill<br />
Australia if hairdressing is excluded. Still there are surprise~ s<br />
even in the Public Service.<br />
I am told that one of the suburban offices-of the Department<br />
of Social Security has only one man among its fifteen staff<br />
members and he is a social worker. Real attempts are being<br />
made to open up a greater diversity of occupational<br />
opportunities. The National Labour cons ultative COuncil Is<br />
Guidel. ines for Emloyers on equal opportunities for women was<br />
lauched earlier this year and Australia is. a signatory to<br />
the U. N. Convention on the Elimination ' of al. Forms, of<br />
Discrimination Against women.<br />
The Commonwealth will launch a major promotion campaign next<br />
month designed to encourage young women to consider apprentic.-eships<br />
ill traditionally non-female occupations, arid there is little<br />
doubt that quite simple initiatives such as this can have a<br />
significant impact on future employment patterns. It is obvious,<br />
that no matter what may be done to widen opportunities, the<br />
consequences of earlier practices wiill continue to have an<br />
pract on the pattern of employment for manly years.<br />
But in addition to that, there are persisting barriers to<br />
equality and diversity in employment opportunities. There isi<br />
in some places a continuing bias in education towards<br />
traditionally female occupations, There is in some places a<br />
continuing bias of one kind or another in recruitment procedures<br />
and without doubt, there are still varioks forms of discrimination.<br />
In ahistorical perspective, however, the remarkable thing i1w-not<br />
so much that barriers still exist but. that a real notion of<br />
equality of employment opportunity has achieved such widespread<br />
acceptance in commnity attitudes in a comparatively few years.<br />
W-hile the very exi, 5tence of an awa-rd such as this is in a sense<br />
a commentary, if you think albout it, on the fact thait equality<br />
of opportunity is not yet fully a reality, the fact that we find<br />
it hat d, from thte vantage point of 1981, to believe that MarrLied<br />
women were barred from permanent positions in the Public Service<br />
as recently as 1966 is a comentary on how far community attitudes<br />
have shifted. </p>
<p>The full sign~ ificance of the changes tha-: t hav. e been taking place<br />
is not easy to assess and while it is not easy to find an<br />
historical benchmark from which to start:, I find some interest<br />
in the fact that in the original Liberal Party platform of 1946<br />
there is a section entitled " status of women" which contains<br />
the following simple but comprehensive statement " Equality<br />
of opportunities, liberties and statut for men and women".-<br />
These. words were farsighted in several waya, and they are<br />
_. eloquent of the key point which is sometimes forgotten<br />
that while equality of opportunity is plainly a fundwiental aim,<br />
the freedom of women to choose whether to work in employment<br />
or to stay at home to look after their family is also fundamental.<br />
In additi-on to those two choices, there is also the possible<br />
option which a number of people seek and which a number of<br />
employers may be able to develop successfully of flexibility<br />
and a variety of part-time employment arrangements..<br />
This possibility raises a number of questions which have not<br />
been fully answered. But if significant development of this option<br />
should prove to be widely successful in terms of satisfactory<br />
and effective emnployment frot -the point of view of both<br />
employer and employee, it could have consequences not only in<br />
relation to equality of employment opportunity but also in<br />
terms of enlarging the scope for diversity of lifestyles<br />
throughout our community.<br />
Such a development really would contain somne challenging<br />
possibilities because it could provuide a framework for placing<br />
the freedom to choose into its proper relationship with<br />
equal ity--of-oppor tun ity for all in a responsible society.<br />
Buit the purpose of this gathering is; not. so much to look at<br />
future developments but rather to offer congratulations on<br />
present achievements._ Titere is no question about the value to<br />
Australian business -of * the contribution that businesswomen are<br />
making an ' d the nominations for this particuilar award are<br />
indicative of the very wide range of business activities in<br />
which women are engaged. I am advised that the panel of judges<br />
in this particular year-hadac~ considerable field from which<br />
to make their decision and I am pleased to announce that the<br />
wiener of the 1981 Bulletin/ Oantas Award for the Australian<br />
Businesswoman of the Year is lisEve Mahiab.<br />
Eve is widely known in the commuity as a person with a very<br />
considerable capacity to communicate the cause and the special<br />
needs of women in the workforce. I understand that it was in<br />
1968 that Eve started up her consultancy business,. using her<br />
legal qualifications in the recruitment o~ f lawyers for law<br />
f irms and corporations. ThisE business has grown and extended<br />
in several directions. The firm of which Eve Nahlab is now<br />
the Chief Executive has become involved in the prodxttetion of<br />
a number of specialized business. diaries.. It has extended its<br />
consultancy and recruitment ser'. iceg beyond the law to the<br />
construction industry and indeed beyond Auistralia to South East Asia.<br />
Eve, I don' t know., whether you, would want toi extend the employnent<br />
side of your business further anld take on a confract td-deal<br />
with the problem of unemployment as a wqhole but anyway, I do<br />
wan~ t to take the opportunity of congratulating you for Your energy<br />
and initiative in building bustnisshisia<br />
