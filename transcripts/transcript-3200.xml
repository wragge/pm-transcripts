PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 2 APRIL 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, some of the Cabinet decisions<br />
yesterday have already been announced. Mr Crean has done so and<br />
Mr Daly has done so. I, myself, will be issuing later in the day<br />
a statement on the Animal Health Laboratory. In brief, we have<br />
approved a project to provide major protection for the Australian<br />
livestock industry. We will establish at Geelong a laboratory<br />
complex and an Animal Health Laboratory at an estimated cost of<br />
$ 56 million. This will provide a vital protection against animal<br />
diseases for one of Australia' s most important industries.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: Why was Senator Gair appointed Australian Ambassador<br />
to Ireland and, secondly, was this opposed by officials at the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs who would have liked to see the<br />
position filled by a career diplomat rather than a politician?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Department of Foreign Affairs wasn't asked for<br />
a view on it and, of course, didn't presume to express a view on it.<br />
But members of Parliament have been constantly appointed to diplomatic<br />
posts including Ireland. You remember Sir Hugh Roberton was appointed<br />
as Ambassador to Ireland. Other serving members of Parliament who<br />
have been appointed as ambassadors have been Sir Percy Spender<br />
to the United States, Sir Howard Beale to the United States,<br />
Mr Joe Gullett to Greece, Mr Dan Mackinnon to the Argentine, Uruguay<br />
and Peru, and Mr Gordon Freeth to Japan. Members of Parliament who<br />
have been appointed as High Commissioners have been Sir Thomas White<br />
to Britain, Sir Eric Harrison to Britain, Sir Alec Downer to Britain,<br />
Dr Donald C~ rieron -to New Zealand, Dame Annabelle Rankini to New Zealand<br />
and Sir Hubert Opperman to Malta. Then there have been Consul-Generals<br />
Sir Josiai Fran':. is to New York and Mr Roger Dean to San Francisco.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Whitlain, did you appoint Senator Gair because of his<br />
-Cact, diplomacy and agreement with your Government's policies or<br />
so that jou could win another Senate seat in Queensland?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would agree with what M Siiedden said about<br />
Senator Gair on the 4th October: " Senator Gair is a very experienced<br />
anid very senior politician. He has, in fact, been a very great<br />
Australian". My attitude to Senator Gair has Always been same.<br />
QUEJSTION: Can I repeat Mr Oakes' second part of his question?<br />
DO yo~ t hope to win the sixth seat in Queensland?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. No, I correct that; the fifth.<br />
QIJZ-TION: I hav~ e a message from Brisbane. It states that the<br />
qucuensland Premier he may have done this already but in Parliamniet<br />
today he intends to announce that the Queensland Government and the<br />
P-apua New Guinea Government have agreed to retain the present<br />
boundiaries. Are you aware of this, and what are'your comments?<br />
PRIME MINTSTER: I haven't heard.<br />
QUESTION: Do you h-ia"' e dn coneo'ns to ina] e on Russia's request for<br />
consideration of a joint Lide in Australia? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You are referring to a proposal that some Soviet<br />
scientists made in February for the establishment of a joint<br />
Australian/ Soviet station. The proposal is that the station would<br />
be used for purposes of photographing space objects and contributing<br />
to a study of the characteristics of the atmosphere. That was the<br />
way the proposal was put. The proposal is currently under study in<br />
appropriate departments. No advice has been given to Ministers on<br />
it, and Ministers have not considered it.<br />
QUESTION: Was the decision to appoint Senator Gair taken while<br />
you were Acting Foreign Minister in Senator Willesee's absence?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Did the initiative come from yourself?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Was Senator Willesee consulted and what was his view<br />
on the appointment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The appointment was made while I was Acting<br />
Foreign Minister. Senator Willesee knew before he went away and,<br />
of course, he has known since he has returned.<br />
QUESTION: Will Cabinet mak3: the decision on whether there should<br />
be a Russian base here and when do you expect that decision to be<br />
made? PRIME MINISTER: Well Cabinet might, but it might not. It depends<br />
on what the Ministers concerned feel about it. I wouldn't imagine<br />
that there is any particular hurry. I beiieve there have been such<br />
proposals put to our predecessors too, bucz as often happened in<br />
those days, no decision was reached.<br />
QUESTION: Did the Irish Government express any reservations about<br />
a second political appointment to be Ambassador in Ireland.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, the Irish Government made no comment on the<br />
appointment. The Irish Government in fact gave its agre'teit very<br />
rapidly.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, has Senator Gair officially accepted the<br />
position?., PRIME MINISTER: Yes. He hasn't, I understand, resigned from the<br />
Senate yet.<br />
QUESTION: On the Senate election. What would you expect the<br />
state of the parties to be in the Seiiate after the election. How<br />
many seats do you expect to pick up?'<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't worked a( A this out. It may be that matters<br />
are in a state of flux. There may aven be some rearranging of<br />
various tickets.<br />
QUESTION: What other appointments have you offered to members of<br />
the Senate after the Senate elections? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have to wait until other governments have<br />
indicated their agreement. Seriously, there have been no discussions<br />
on any such matters.<br />
QUESTION: Do you welcome the States access to a consumption ti. x<br />
as the High Court determined it yesterday. And will you be vacatinq<br />
the field of Commonwealth sales tax to allow the States access to<br />
a growth tax which you have always advocated or will you be cutting<br />
back on your commonwealth grants to the States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We haven't studied the judgment yet and the other<br />
States, apart from Tasmania, have not considered legislation on this<br />
subject yet. Tasmania wil, as a result of the judgment, presumably<br />
be bringing in fresh legislation. As a matter of general attitude,<br />
however, a consumption tax, a consumer tax, is one which is quite<br />
appropriate for States to levy in a Federal system. There has been<br />
very much doubt and hesitation hitherto by the States in ' imposing<br />
such taxes because there have been a great number of decisions by<br />
the High Court on the Commonwealth's exclusive power to levy excise<br />
duty. There has been doubt as to what taxes would be excise<br />
duties. The High Court decision yesterday clarified this matter<br />
quite considerably.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, in reference to your policy of accepting<br />
only skilled or professional workers from Asia, do you think that<br />
might cause a brain-drain from these countries that would generate<br />
as much antagonism as the White Australia policy.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It might. It well might. I take this opportunity<br />
to comment that many newspaper articles on this and other immigration<br />
matters refer to a " migrant drive". The Government is conducting<br />
no migrant drive. What the Government has done is to make arrangements<br />
for the same method of assessing skills, industrial skills, which<br />
hitherto, have applied to Europe, including Turkey, to the<br />
ascertainment of industrial skills in S. E. Asia, the South Pacific<br />
and Latin America and, accordingly, if people in those other countries<br />
nearer to us now seek to migrate to Australia, their skills will be<br />
able to be determined at home instead of being referred to Australia.<br />
Ile are, in other words, as regards industrial skills making thiv S. vne<br />
arrangements for our neighbourhood and our hemisphere as h4Ve be en<br />
made for some years past in respect to Europe.<br />
QUESTION: Is the Government prepared to pay compensation Lo mining<br />
companies that are not able to go ahead and develop reserves that<br />
they have vacated because of decisions in relation to the environment,<br />
Aboriginal land rights, Aboriginal welfare? Would such compensation,<br />
if it were to be paid, be based on E': oenditures they have incuirred<br />
in vacating the reserves, or would it be related to their expectations<br />
of profits, if they were allowed tco go ahead and develop them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There might be legal implications in any answer I<br />
have to that, so you will understand that I won't answer it. The<br />
general situation is that for the last 20 years, under legislation<br />
introduced by one of the Menzies Governments, uranium in the Australian<br />
territories and there are very great deposits of uranium in the<br />
Northern Territory; we don't know of any in Canberra or Jervis Bay<br />
belong to the Australian Government. And accordingly we have suggested<br />
to companies which have contracts to supply uranium overseas that<br />
they can fulfil those contracts from uranium deposits owned by the / 14 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Australian Government in various parts of the Northern Territory.<br />
We are not prepared to allow any companies to exploit uranium from<br />
Aboriginal reserves until Mr Justice E. A. Woodward has given a<br />
further report on Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, I understand that during your<br />
forthcoming visit to Europe, you are going to visit Yugoslavia. ' Viiis<br />
will be the first ever visit of an Australian Prime Minister to<br />
Yugoslavia? Considering also the fact that there are a quarter of<br />
a million Australians of Yugoslavian origin, do you expect that<br />
your visit will improve better the relationships between the two<br />
countries, and whether some tangible concrete matters will be<br />
discussed? PRIME MINISTER: I have had many invitations from heads of Government<br />
or heads of State in Europe to visit their countries. Among them<br />
there is an invitation from Yugoslavia. Accordingly, when I visit<br />
Europe, I intend to visit Yugoslavia. The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia<br />
visited Australia a year ago and therefore it is proper that I should<br />
reciprocate his visit on my first visit thereafter. I know the<br />
contribution that Yugoslavs have made to Australia, because I believe<br />
that in my electorate there are more people who were born in Yugoslavia<br />
or whose parents were born in Yugoslavia than any other electorate<br />
in Australia.<br />
QUESTION: There is a considerable concern that meat prices are<br />
dropping seriously. A number of abattoirs have been forced to lay<br />
of f staff due to the virtual disappearance of export sales. The main<br />
problem seems to be an over-valuation of the Australian dollar against<br />
the American dollar and the Yen. Is the Government concerned about<br />
this situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will not make any conm f-t in public on matters of<br />
valuation of the currency. Nobody in this job would. If prices<br />
are falling overseas, we might even get them to fall at home.<br />
QUESTION: Will the Government give asylum to an American war desertcr,<br />
currently under detention in the country, and what is the general<br />
attitudes of the Government on at least another ten deserters believed<br />
to be in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government hasn't considered this mat-6* er and I<br />
have only had a very passing discussion about it with my colleagues.<br />
You might forgive me however if I express a tentative view. The man<br />
concerned has an Australian wife and Australian born children. I don't<br />
believe it is possible that in those circumstances he would be<br />
deported.<br />
QUESTION: Presumably you will hope that the DLP will be killed as<br />
a force in the Senate on May 18. Do you hope that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would believe that, there will be one member of the<br />
DLP in the next Parliament after the Senate elections.<br />
QUESTION: Has this hope or belief influenced your decision to<br />
appoint Senator Gair to Ireland?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are DLP candidates standing in several States.<br />
I would not think that any of them have strong prospects of re-election. </p>
<p>QUESTION: You said in the House this morning you hoped that<br />
Senator Gair would be in Dublin in July. When exactly will he take up<br />
his appointment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Before July. I am not sure. I would think about<br />
the end of June. As you know our diplomats in various posts find it<br />
useful and agreeable for them to have a visit by the Prime Minister<br />
or the Foreign Minister because it brings them quite intensely into<br />
governmental circles at their posts.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell me why Professor Ronald Henderson's report<br />
on poverty was not released yesterday as expected?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because it is proper to release it in Parliament while<br />
Parliament is sitting.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us, is there still time between now and<br />
May 18 to have the sixth vacancy elected in Queensland?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Queensland Government if the Queensland Legislative<br />
Assembly is not sitting, or the Queensland Legislative Assembly,<br />
if it is sitting, can made an appointment to fill a casual vacancy.<br />
The replacement is made at the first election, Federal election,<br />
after the occurrence of the casual vacancy in the State. The balance<br />
of Senator Gair's term will be taken by the person elected on 18 May.<br />
QUESTION: That depends on when Senator Gair retires. Do you know<br />
when that will be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: 1.<br />
QUESTION: Can I clarify a point in answer to my earlier question?<br />
When I asked you whether you had had any negotiations referring to<br />
overseas posts, what I was getting at specifically is: Have you<br />
had any discussions with Senator Negus or any other independent<br />
senators regarding the possibility of standing for President after<br />
the Senate elections?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't and if I had I wouldn't tell you. </p>
