    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman today announced up to $6.84 million in disaster funding to help restore the State’s world-renowned parks and reserves that were affected by storms and floods through June.</p>
<p>This assistance will be provided through the Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>The severe weather earlier this year had a significant impact on Tasmania, particularly affecting its national parks and reserves and the State’s vital tourism industry.</p>
<p>The additional disaster assistance will help restore of national parks and reserves, provide access to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, as well as stabilising the Beaconsfield Hart Shaft.</p>
<p>This further demonstrates the commitment of the Australian and Tasmanian Governments to respond to the challenges facing communities recovering from the devastating floods.</p>
<p>Stabilising the Beaconsfield Hart Shaft will allow the Beaconsfield Mine and Heritage Centre to reopen, and repairing flood damage around the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area will restore visitor access to the State’s iconic natural tourism attractions.</p>
<p>Work on restoring our national parks and reserves will include repairing flood damage and cleaning up recreational facilities such as picnic areas, walking tracks and community amenities.</p>

<li>Support for affected local councils to help with the costs of cleaning up and restoring damaged essential public assets</li>
<li>Grants of up to $10,000 for primary producers to assist with clean-up and restoration activities including removing debris, disposing of dead livestock, salvaging crops, grain and feed, and repairing damaged plant and equipment.
<ul><li>These grants are only available to eligible primary producers in the eight LGAs of Break O’Day, Central Coast, Central Highlands, Kentish, Latrobe, Meander Valley, Northern Midlands and Waratah-Wynyard.</li>
