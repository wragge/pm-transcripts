Jj, AUSTRAIA<br />
F PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 JULY, 1979<br />
WHALING<br />
The Prime Minister today welcomed the decision of the<br />
International Whaling Commission in London to declare a worldwide<br />
moratorium on whaling by factory ships.<br />
The only species not included in the moratorium is the small<br />
and populous Minke Whale.<br />
Australia will continue to press for the expansion of themoratorium<br />
to cover all species and for its long-term continuation.<br />
Australia has also taken an initiative to have the Commission<br />
itself examine the consequences of a long-term ban on whaling.<br />
I understand that Australia's motions calling for a report on the<br />
steps necessary to institute a world-wide ban, including the<br />
period required to introduce such a ban and report on the<br />
economic aspects of commercial whaling have been accepted.<br />
These reports should be available for the 32nd Annual Meeting<br />
of the IWC.<br />
Australia will also be pressing for a sanctuary in the Indian Ocean<br />
for all species of whales to ensure their protection.<br />
Private whaling by nations not members of the IWC compromises the<br />
ability of the IWC to manage whale stocks. Australia regards<br />
the activities of these nations vrery seriously and we intend<br />
to exert all our influence in an effort to persuade them to accept<br />
the Commission's rules.<br />
The Australian Delegation to the IWC is led by Professor Ovington<br />
Director Australian National Parks and WildliFe Service.<br />
Dr Radwayallen, Dr Kirkwood, Mr Letts and Mrs Joy Lee are the<br />
other members. -o0o---</p>
