TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, HIGH C~ OMMISSIONERS RESIDENCE, PORT MORESIBY,<br />
113 SEPTEMBER 19S<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think the prosence of the French in the Soudli<br />
Pacnc, is in any way delogitimised by thoir decision to resume nuclear<br />
testing?<br />
PM. I think that there has been a constructive rlationship between the<br />
French) and the countries of the Soith Pacific Snd, I think, the rest of<br />
us. I don't think. there is any doubt that the legitimacy of their presence<br />
or the sincerity of thelii pitmence Is called inlto que~ 4ion by a scant<br />
disregard for the opinions and the interests of peo* l who live inl the<br />
Poiftl Pacific Islanders. But, that is not to make a coMment abotf<br />
the French tonritodes, This h* 3 alway6 been a matter between the<br />
poople who live there and France itself.<br />
4: Prime Minister, what sort of statement would you be looking for out of<br />
the Forum?<br />
PM: I think one that contflues the themes of lost year. That is, where wo<br />
are looking fur managing resources better I think, Sir Julius. has a<br />
themne which is consistent with that and that i. P how to further develop<br />
thm ea. sources, how to keep them sustainable and we are able to, I<br />
think, record from Wat year some substantial and positive, changes in<br />
transport, turning around some of the heavy airline deficits I made the<br />
point year ago that thcre was more money lost in the airline deficits of<br />
" h Pacific countries than there was in this aid whiich Australia and New<br />
Ze$ iand had given to Pacific Island nations and Pacific nations. And.<br />
we are seeing quite substantial and very pleasing changes in the<br />
budgets of those airlines and the rationalisation of those services,<br />
Fisheries we are sftking to Improve the lot of Pecific Island countries<br />
In terrms of flsheries, the benefits available to them, the pnceA they<br />
receive, Those are issues I have taken up with Japan, with Korea.<br />
Logging we are working towards a togging or forest acmod ut this<br />
meetting which began in Brisbane and I hope that we can come to a U 1' U </p>
<p>TEL 13ep. 9 1b No . UU l'U V-<br />
2<br />
point of isyreemeflt a~ QUt forest manggement on this occasion with the<br />
sing~ ing of that 8cmord.<br />
So, these are the things.<br />
J* Haven't the Papua New Guinearis and the Solomon's kiiocked that<br />
forestry code of conduct on the head?<br />
PM, They are agreeing with it, I think, but they are saying well, I'm not<br />
sure exactly what they are saying, but I think, in Papua New Guinea's<br />
Case It Is saying that it hasn't got its own domestic process in place.<br />
But, I would be very disappointed if we couldn't sign the accord up at<br />
this meeting,<br />
Ji: rrime Minister, you have ofered incentiveS to the Solomon Islands to<br />
try and convince them to stop lowging arid they havenl taken those tip,<br />
are you prepared yet to think about the big stick approach. withdrawing<br />
aid?<br />
PM-We are In a constructive, friendly relationship with the Woomon. Islands<br />
and1, ot course, with Papua Now Guinea. Ono sooks to encourage<br />
people to have, in this case, sustainable logging practicos, to help<br />
where we can with sustainable logging processes and planning. I don't<br />
necessarily belief that people always see your side of the arourrent<br />
immediately. but we will keep wearing away at that as In t caso of the<br />
somorons.<br />
J: Whet * bou Gordon Bilney's line, that the Goverment will be leak than<br />
wilting in tho future to eoaist those counties that are squanden their<br />
resources, just how tough is the Governiment prepared to be?<br />
PM-I think It is a case of both a bit of push anid pull. We try to pull people<br />
along hy encouraging them to do things and we try and push them<br />
alon. But again, one does tt within the wrt of protocols of the<br />
rolationshIps. ft Is called trying to be construcive I think.<br />
J; Out is there point in continuing to give aid for sustainable forestry<br />
projects to a country Mhat has anything but a sustainabhi; industry and<br />
which is seeking to defer this code of conduct at the Forum?<br />
PM; Are you speaking of the Solomons, in particular? Well. I mean, the<br />
Solomnon Wsands does not have a sustainable rate of forestry exlractiori<br />
ojr forestry management. That it, an issuo of concern to Us. Wip have<br />
assisted them to understand or at least rneasuro teir forestry<br />
resources and then to be able to plot som sort of chart of extraction<br />
and oustainabilfty, What the indications give us is that It is<br />
unsustainable. We lidve made those points. wh~ ether we continue to<br />
give financial assistance lfo forestry Is something for us to dlatervnfe,<br />
but obviously there gets to a point of where 11e returns are not worth it. </p>
<p>TEL: 13 ep j1: 86 y NO ' JU(<br />
J: Just coming back to th point about the French test again, Prime<br />
Minister, do yntu think fthre is anything more the Forum con<br />
constructively do to argue the case against Padis?<br />
PM: I think the value of the Forum IS for It to spak with one voice a$ the<br />
voice of the Pacific. There is no otr meeting oa a group nf nations<br />
this large or this representative that could say to President Chirac and<br />
his govornment that this is a bad decision which we want reversed.<br />
Thd value of it boing said in this Forum i3 that it is not simnply Australia<br />
or Now Zealand, it is the Forum countries as a whole. So, rather than<br />
now arguments, I think, the value is in the saying of it as a whole, as a<br />
r~ rniuhity.<br />
J. As Chairman of the Forum though. Australia h2S pW out a commnunique<br />
with the Forum against the French testing, what is thi2 communique<br />
that is Qoing to come out tomorrow, how is that going to be different?<br />
PM: I think it will have a strono conderrination of the declsion of Mhe French<br />
to lost, A condemnation of the decision to detonate the first b43st and<br />
calling on the Government of Fran= e to desist. Now. again, Fran, ce Is a<br />
sovereign country, but we will be at least saying that powerfully, I hope.<br />
Xis there a danger that the fact that Australia is a member of this; rorum<br />
could mean new accusations from France that we are gingering up the<br />
Pacm against them?<br />
PM: I think fth French are Worldly WleA. They know what peop think.<br />
They know what thie geneful mood of the Pardfk is They don't like our<br />
attue, but then we don't like theirs. And . I think, they kno&amp; W most<br />
people around here don't like theirl for this either. We wil be sAying<br />
tt in spade: 3, I hope, in the next couple of duys.<br />
en'ds </p>
