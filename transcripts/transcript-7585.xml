PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 4 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction to the CPI<br />
figure or figures today?<br />
PM: Well, I have two reactions. one is that it's at the, I<br />
think, at the lower end of expectations and it shows that<br />
the underlying rate of inflation at 6.8 percent, 6.8 to 6.9,<br />
is lower than the sort of figure that had been talked about<br />
before. But having said that, the second thing I want to<br />
say is that I think the, while that underlying rate is lower<br />
than had been talked about before, still too high and the<br />
various arms of policy will be kept tight to ensure that we<br />
get a further lowering of the underlying rate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do banks have any excuse to raise home loan<br />
rates now?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not here to tell banks how to conduct their<br />
affairs. They've got a competitive system out there, but I<br />
would, my own judgement on the figures, is that they don't<br />
provide such an excuse.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what do you think of the idea of a<br />
pulp mill in Tasmania producing non-bleached paper products?<br />
Would the Commonwealth be inclined to offer such a scheme at<br />
least the same sort of incentives that you're prepared to<br />
offer the other Wesley Vale proposal?<br />
PM: Well I've had some discussions with Mr Field about this<br />
and I'll be going down to Tasmania tomorrow night and I'll<br />
be there on Saturday. I may have something to say about<br />
this then. I think it's more appropriate that anything I've<br />
got to say about it, I say in Tasmania then. You won't have<br />
long to wait.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you believe that the figures<br />
should have provided a measure of what the inflation would<br />
have been under the old measure just so that there's no<br />
accusation of a fiddle?<br />
PM: There can't be an accusation of a fiddle. Just let me<br />
make this point. I understand that some elements in the<br />
media have been desperately going around economists in the<br />
private sector seeking to get from them some condemnation of </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( PM cont): what the Statistician has done. One was rung up<br />
and asked ' well what did you think?' He said ' I think it's<br />
right'. He said ' damn it' the person who rang up said ' damn<br />
it, I can't find any of you who don't agree with what's<br />
being done'. They are right. I mean the position is that<br />
the Statistician has looked at what has been happening, he's<br />
made a decision that the previous method was not appropriate<br />
and that what he's producing now is appropriate. You don't<br />
keep producing an inappropriate method.<br />
JOURNALIST: But wouldn't it have given us a better method<br />
of comparison if it had have been published Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I don't understand your question.<br />
JOURNALIST: With the old method you had, if a figure for<br />
the old method had been published, wouldn't we have had a<br />
better comparison between the old and the new methods?<br />
PM: What's the point of, I mean the Statistician if he's<br />
made a judgement, which he has, his own integrity and<br />
competence has made a decision that a series that he was<br />
producing was inappropriate then it would be an entirely<br />
inappropriate and, I would believe, incompetent decision to<br />
keep in the public arena something that's inappropriate. I<br />
mean, while it may be of some assistance to the one body in<br />
the whole community, that is the opposition, who want to<br />
make something of this can't get any support from any<br />
private sector economists for their view, why should you<br />
pander to that one body? Everyone realises that this is<br />
more appropriate and therefore our statistical and economic<br />
system shouldn't be cluttered with the continuation of<br />
something that's inappropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you give us a prediction for<br />
this financial year's inflation rate, this calendar year's<br />
inflation rate, or next year's inflation?<br />
PM: Well, which one, do you mean. I mean, you had three<br />
goes there, which one do you want? Just nominate which one<br />
first. JOURNALIST: This one.<br />
PM: This calendar or financial year? Well this financial<br />
year is 1988/ 89 and therefore I can tell you that on the<br />
year to date we are at, as I said, 6.8 to 6.9. Then you've<br />
got to ask yourself what happens to the June quarter? As<br />
has been indicated, as I've said myself, as soon as I saw<br />
those floods occurring in New South wales and I think I was<br />
the first to say ' there's a bit of a bad impact on the June<br />
quarter of the CPI', so that will be somewhat artificially<br />
pushed up. But you can see that we've got a situation, an<br />
underlying rate of inflation in this financial year as I've </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM cant): put it, in the order of 6.8/ 6.9. Now you want<br />
to know about, I think you tried secondly this calendar year<br />
and then you tried the next financial year. Well, as far as<br />
both of those periods are concerned I would think, taking<br />
out the one-off character of the floods which I think will<br />
inflate it in the June quarter, we can be looking at a<br />
decline in the underlying rate for two basic reasons. one,<br />
that we already see as has been indicated in the Treasurer's<br />
press release, we're starting to see the impact of the<br />
benefits of the earlier appreciation of the Australian<br />
dollar because the price of imported items increased by 0.7<br />
percent in the quarter which is less than the overall, less<br />
than half the overall increase in the CPI, so we do seem to<br />
be getting some benefit of that early appreciation of the<br />
dollar which has taken some time to come through. Secondly,<br />
we have a position where we've negotiated a wages outcome<br />
which is going to be reasonable and that should, I believe,<br />
together with the gradual lowering of the level of economic<br />
activity which policy has intended to bring about, in total<br />
should result in a lowering, a further lowering of the<br />
underlying rate of inflation.<br />
JOURNALIST: When do you expect to see interest rates start<br />
falling off Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Good try. Good try. Let me give you my standard<br />
response. Standard because it's the right one. I do not<br />
make predictions about short term movements in interest<br />
rates because those movements in short term interest rates<br />
are a result of a combination of factors including what<br />
happens in this country and what happens overseas. So I'm<br />
not going to be making any predictions about short term<br />
movements in interest rates. I have only said, at the<br />
beginning of this year in response to a specific question,<br />
that I thought that by the end of the year they would be<br />
down. I have no reason to change that, but I'm not going to<br />
say anything about immediate movements.<br />
JOURNALIST: You also said then they wouldn't be going up.<br />
PM: Yes, well you can't avoid short term or long term. I'm<br />
simply saying to you quite clear'ly now that as far as the<br />
short term is concerned, I'm not making any predictions<br />
about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is your position greener than the Government<br />
now on the Antartic issue?<br />
PM: Greener or whiter? Let me make it clear that as far as<br />
I'm concerned and the Government are concerned, we are<br />
totally green or totally white as far as the Antarctic is<br />
concerned. This issue will be coming before the Cabinet<br />
shortly and I can tell you that my position is that I'm<br />
totally opposed to mining in the Antarctic. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean signing, ratifying the Treaty or<br />
PM: Well, there'll be arguments, there'll be discussions<br />
about that. Apparently there are some views that you can<br />
best achieve a guarantee of no mining in the Antarctic by in<br />
fact having a minerals convention in place. There are<br />
others who say the opposite. Now I'm going to be listening<br />
to the arguments and discussions with a view to being<br />
satisfied in my mind as to what course of action will bring<br />
about a position of no mining in the Antarctic, of<br />
guaranteeing that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can the Liberals and Democrats stop it, or is<br />
it completely a decision by the Government?<br />
PM: Stop what?<br />
JOURNALIST: The signing of the Treaty. Does it have to go<br />
through Parliament<br />
PM: No, no, no. Don't try and conjure up a position that<br />
what we're going to have is the Liberals with the Democrats<br />
taking up a more appropriate environmental position than<br />
this Government. I mean we haven't reached that peculiar<br />
state of affairs. Their record on environmental questions<br />
is one of vandals. They have no right or authority in<br />
history to claim any substance, any position of merit in<br />
this area and there's not going to be some magical<br />
transformation in the historical position. It's this<br />
Government which is the one which is committed to<br />
appropriate environmental standards. I don't think I could<br />
make it much clearer than I just have in answer to an<br />
earlier question. As far as I and this Government are<br />
concerned, we will be adopting a position which ensures no<br />
mining in the Antarctic.<br />
JOURNALIST: When will you have a decision on this<br />
PM: I'm not<br />
JOURNALIST: Before you go overseas? </p>
<p>PM: Yes. I would expect so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister two days before Peter Wilenski<br />
gave that speech in the UN, you got a long letter from Mr<br />
Isi Leibler complaining about apparently Australia having<br />
eroded their support for Israel. Your comments yesterday<br />
about the Wilenski speech or to allay the growing<br />
concern of the Jewish community in Australia about<br />
Australia's support for Israel?<br />
PM: Well let's get the premises right. I did not, I<br />
personally didn't receive the letter before the speech in<br />
the United Nations. Let me say it quite directly in regard<br />
to that letter as I've made clear to Mr Leibler I rather<br />
object to approaches that have never happened before to me<br />
in my 6 years as Prime Minister, that a letter is published<br />
in full in the Press before I receive it and before I've had<br />
the opportunity of discussions with the person who sends the<br />
letter to me. I made that clear to Mr Leibler in the<br />
2 1/ 2 hour discussion I had with him. Now the position is<br />
quite clear about this matter. I think I couldn't have made<br />
it clearer and that is that I believe the vote of Australia<br />
was a correct vote and that our position amongst the 129<br />
nations was the right position against the two which opposed<br />
it and the one, Liberia, which abstained. I simply have<br />
made the point that when I did see the text of the speech I<br />
thought for the reasons that I put, it was unbalanced. Let<br />
me make it clear as there is some suggestion that the<br />
statement I've made implied some lack of confidence in my<br />
Minister. It does not. I merely expressed on this issue I<br />
thought there should've been another paragraph there. But I<br />
take this opportunity of confirming my absolute confidence<br />
in the Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the text of that speech screened by your<br />
Department Mr Hawke, before it was delivered?<br />
PM: By my Deaprtment?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: Not that I'm aware of. I think not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some members of the Foreign Affairs and Trade<br />
Department believe that your criticism has undermined Dr<br />
Wilenski's credibility. Would you accept that proposition?<br />
PM: No I don't accept that. Let's not get too complicated<br />
about this. Here is a case where in one respect I think an<br />
error of judgement was made. Now I've expressed my view on<br />
that. The position has been quite directly and graciously<br />
accepted by my minister, he's accepted responsibility. As I<br />
say it implies no lack of confidence, quite the contrary. I<br />
think in the relatively short period that he's been Minister<br />
he's done a quite outstanding job on behalf of Australia.<br />
But here I believe there was an error of judgement. I want </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM ( cant): to make the point here as I did briefly in the<br />
House yesterday that it must be understood what happens in<br />
these explanations of votes in the United Nations. You have<br />
the opportunity only of speaking very briefly. The text of<br />
the statement by Dr Wilenski in fact only covered two pages<br />
and you are not able in such circumstances to give a fully<br />
detailed exposition of the Government's policies on the<br />
matters which are under discussion. Of course, if that had<br />
been possible then I'm confident in those circumstances<br />
there that the sort of balance that I think was appropriate<br />
would've been achieved.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Opposition Leader says this reflects deep<br />
divisions in the Government on the issue.<br />
PM: If those deep divisions exist they haven't been brought<br />
to my attention. No-one in Government has had any<br />
discussions with me other than the discussion that I<br />
initiated with the Foreign minister before I made the<br />
statement in the interview that has been published in the<br />
Jewish Press. I spoke with him, he accepted the point I<br />
made. Apart from that discussion which I initiated with the<br />
Foreign Minister no-one has raised the issue with me. Sc I<br />
can understand Mr Howard, who is himself a victim of and in<br />
the centre of the deepest divisions in the conservative<br />
parties that we've seen for many, many years, grasping<br />
hopefully at straws. But this is indeed a straw and it's<br />
not a straw which will save him from the judgement that he<br />
is a weak, feeble, unsupported leader of the conservative<br />
forces in this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Senator Evans immediately see your point Mr<br />
Hawke, or did he feel that the original emphasis was<br />
PM: It was a very, very relatively brief and very friendly<br />
discussion. He took the point<br />
JOURNALIST: Well did he explain the error of judgement?<br />
PM: That's something that really is I suppose that's<br />
directed to the Senator but I mean I simply say this. That<br />
in that post of minister for Foreign Affairs there's an<br />
enormous amount of material that crosses his desk. I'm<br />
aware of the volume of cable traffic because I read most of<br />
the cables myself. There's an enormous amount of cable<br />
traffic and decisions to be taken and you know how ever rany<br />
questions you put to me you won't get me in a postion where<br />
you'll find me being deeply critical of the Minister. I<br />
think as I put it was an error of judgement on this issue,<br />
it's accepted, and I think that should be accepted.<br />
JOURNALIST: When did you have this conversation with<br />
Senator Evans? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM: It would've been last Friday, I was in Melbourne. or<br />
was it the week before? I mean I've got to get it right.<br />
It was the end of the previous week when I was in Melbourne.<br />
So it would have to be, I think, last Friday week is my<br />
recollection. I'd have to confirm that but I'm sure it was<br />
last Friday week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it a case that the Jewish community is just<br />
not prepared to wear any criticism at all by the Australian<br />
Government that<br />
PM: Well, you'd have to ask the Jewish community what they<br />
are prepared or not prepared to accept, but let me say this.<br />
I think if you take the opportunity of reading the very long<br />
interview that I gave to Mr Lipski and Mr Gawenda, which I<br />
believe is published in their media this week, that I made<br />
quite clear the foundational positions of myself and of this<br />
Government. They haven't changed, and that is a total<br />
commitment to the integrity and viability of the State of<br />
Israel. That remains, as I say, foundational and<br />
unchangeable. I've made it clear that I believe that we are<br />
living in circumstances now where changes have taken place.<br />
I believe that it is understandable that Israel should take<br />
the view that there are some risks in accepting and acting<br />
upon the statements that have been made by the leadership of<br />
the PLO. Having said that however I believe that the<br />
statements that have been made do engender a new situation<br />
and that it is in the interests of Israel, of the region and<br />
of the world that they should take the risks that they may<br />
see entailed in entering into negotiations. I made the<br />
fundamental point to Mr Leibler in repudiating the<br />
presumption that he had made to put my arguments, that he<br />
was totally wrong to put my arguments as saying that Israel<br />
should gamble its future. That was an intellectually flawed<br />
position in his letter to me and I so explained it. I said<br />
that I wasn't asking Israel to gamble. I said that I put<br />
this position from a position of strength as a gambler I<br />
have a punt myself. But as I put to Mr Leibler, when I go<br />
to the bookmaker and I have my gamble and my bet, I can't<br />
after the horses have jumped say to the bookie, I'm sorry<br />
bookie, I don't like the way the race is being run, I take<br />
my bet back. Gambling doesn't operate like that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Shame.<br />
PM: Yes, shame as you say. Although if you're a good<br />
punter you wouldn't have to often do it. But I'm making an<br />
extremely serious point. I repudiate it as totally<br />
intellectually flawed, Mr Leibler's analysis where he<br />
presumed I deliberately use the word presumed in his<br />
letter to state my arguments, that he stated my arguments as<br />
saying I'm asking Israel to gamble. I make the point that<br />
when you have a gamble, put your bet, you can't take it back<br />
after the horses have jumped. What I'm saying of course to<br />
Israel is something quite different. I would be the last<br />
person to ask Israel to gamble but I am saying to Israel </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PM ( cont): that they are living in a situation now which is<br />
different and everyone realises that it is different. You<br />
can make the judgement as to how different, how much weight<br />
you attach to the statements that have been made by Mr<br />
Arafat, but those statements have been made. And the fact<br />
of them having been made and on their face meeting the<br />
conditions that I laid down and I say I because I was the<br />
first one in the international community to lay down those<br />
conditions. They subsequently became accepted by others, by<br />
the United States, I believe the Soviet Union and Europe and<br />
other countries who are concerned with this issue. It was I<br />
who first said that there were three conditions and the<br />
three were the acceptance of 242 and 338, secondly and<br />
following that the acceptance of Israel's right to exist,<br />
and thirdly the denunciation of terrorism. It was Bob Hawke<br />
who first laid down those conditions in the international<br />
discussion on this matter. They've been accepted as a<br />
reasonable basis of approach on this issue and the<br />
statements of Arafat, at least if you want to take the most<br />
sceptical view, at least on their face meet those<br />
conditions. They so meet those conditions that countries<br />
including the greatest friend and ally if you like and<br />
supplier of assistance to Israel, that is the United States,<br />
the statements of Mr Arafat so meet those conditions that<br />
they have substantially changed their position. That is<br />
they have entered into discussions with the PLO. No-one<br />
including the State of Israel can argue in these<br />
circumstances that there isn't a change. My position<br />
therefore is not asking Israel to gamble but to say accept<br />
the realities that there are changes, that there may be<br />
risks involved in therefore entering into negotiations, but<br />
you enter into those negotiations and discussions. If in<br />
the process of doing that after taking that risk, if you<br />
want to put it that way, if you find that your worst<br />
apprehensions and assumptions of mala fides are borne out<br />
then you are in a position where you can withdraw and change<br />
your position. But to describe those realities as asking<br />
Israel to gamble is, as I say, fundamentally intellectually<br />
flawed.<br />
JOURNALIST: On another subject Mr Hawke, does the American<br />
sale of subsidised wheat to the Soviet Union plus the<br />
likelihood of a similar sale to China indicate that despite<br />
all the rhetoric, our legitimate interests really account<br />
for nothing there?<br />
PM: I must say that we are of course disappointed with this<br />
announcement by the United States to refer their EEP<br />
subsidised sale to the Soviet Union and to continue the<br />
massive subsidisation by the United States of the Soviet<br />
Union. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned historically<br />
we are somewhat of a residual seller to the Soviet Union but<br />
there is no doubt that our interests will be adversely<br />
affected by this decision, if not in terms of access in<br />
volume terms it will certainly have an impact in price<br />
terms. what makes it the more surprising, if I can put it </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PM ( cont): that way, as well as hurtful, is of course that<br />
in commercial terms it was economically unneccessary. There<br />
is a shortage of grain and there is no need in commercial<br />
terms for the United States to make this decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: On Mr Bowen's imminent record, do you<br />
acknowledge that one key contribution from Mr Bowen to this<br />
Government has been the stability and loyalty that comes<br />
from a deputy who doesn't have leadership aspirations and is<br />
it your wish that that position be continued when he retires<br />
at the end of<br />
PM: I'll simply say two things about that. Firstly my<br />
assessment in appreciation of my mate Lionel Bowen goes far<br />
beyond that, that's an element of it, I mean no-one could<br />
have had a more loyal deputy than I've had in Lionel Bowen.<br />
I don't want to say a great deal more about that because I'm<br />
going to have the opportunity of saying it more publicly<br />
shortly. But my appreciation of Lionel goes far beyond<br />
that, it goes to my assessment of him as a man and secondly,<br />
whoever succeeds Lionel Bowen as deputy Prime Minister in<br />
the fourth Hawke Government will I know in that respect have<br />
exactly the same qualities.<br />
