PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARRAMATTA LEAGUES CLUB,<br />
PARRAMATTA 9 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why was it necessary to ring<br />
Sir Arvi Parbo comments this morning?<br />
PM: It wasn't necessary. I thought it a reasonable thing<br />
to do because I didnt want there to be an unnecessary<br />
O personal interchange between Sir Arvi and myself on the<br />
question of the telephone call. I must say I am indebted<br />
to Sir Arvi for the fact that he has indicated that my<br />
account of what happened in regard to the telephone call<br />
is accurate and that there1 had been a misinterpretation<br />
by the media of what he had to say about it. It's best<br />
that that be clarified and it has been.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well in fact he said you got a bit carried<br />
away. PM: That Is another question. He said 1 had but he did<br />
not dispute the accuracy of my account of what had happened<br />
in regard to the telephone call. And however much you<br />
may want to deflect from the point I was concerned, that<br />
is the misinterpretation of your friends in the media,<br />
he made it quite clear that they had misinterpreted.<br />
They had.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it's an especially edifying<br />
sight Prime Minister to see the Prime Minister and the<br />
Chairman of BlHP slanging it out?<br />
PM: I would have thought, If you could disentangle yourself<br />
from your prejudices, which I know is difficult in your<br />
case, that in fact what my telephone call was about was<br />
to ensure that if there has to be an argument between<br />
Sir Arvi and myself there is no doubt there can be, In<br />
regard to the basic issue of Coronation Hill, that that<br />
be disentangled from a misinterpretation of your friends<br />
in the media. Now I know, as I say you have difficulty<br />
in taking that point, but the fact that you have difficulty<br />
worries me not at all. </p>
<p>2<br />
JOURNALIST: But shouldn't been misinterpreted Prime<br />
Minister, shouldn't he have rung up on his own accord<br />
without.. PM: I'm not here to say what Sir Arvi should have done.<br />
I am unqualified in my gratitude to Sir Az-vi for when<br />
I rang him. He said your account Prime Minister is correct<br />
and there has been a misinterpretation by the media.<br />
Now we can go on and on and on. That basic point you<br />
will not avoid. I repeat it, that my interpretation about<br />
what happened on the telephone call is correct and the<br />
media, as is often the case, were prepared in the first<br />
case not to do their homework. There was a statement<br />
which they interpreted. I would've thought that common<br />
good sense, common good sense would've suggested that<br />
after Sir Arvi had made his statement, before racing off<br />
to misinterpret, common good sense would've suggested<br />
ring the Prime Minister's office. You find out from<br />
S Sir Arvi's statement now that if you had done that there<br />
wouldn't have been the misinterpretation.<br />
