TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH CATHERINE JOB, ABC RADIO " AM" PROGRAM,<br />
17 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
CJ: Well Mr Keating, you have been calling for some policy detail from Mr<br />
Howard, he has just given us some, is it a step in the right direction?<br />
PM. An endorsement of the Western Australian endorsement of the<br />
Western Australian legislation. Hear him slipping and sliding when<br />
you put the questions to him about the strikes, ' yes' he says in his<br />
measured tones ' yes, we do, you know our position, we have been<br />
supporting ballots on strikes for some time now'. Basically, look let me<br />
just make this clear to you, his claim that the Federal Government is<br />
supporting this strike or having anything to do with it is completely<br />
untrue. This was on before I went to Western Australia. The blockade<br />
had been announced before I ever went there and it is there because<br />
of the viciousness of the Western Australian legislation. This year<br />
Catherine, industrial disputes are at their lowest level since 1940.<br />
They are at 70 working days lost per thousand people. When Mr<br />
Howard was last in government it was 790 working days lost per<br />
thousand people. We have, as I say, the lowest level of disputes in<br />
the nation since 1940. What is happening in Western Australia now is<br />
what you would see all over Australia if John Howard were to become<br />
Prime Minister because John Howard endorsed Mr Kierath and Mr<br />
Court's industrial legislation at the Western Australian Liberal Party<br />
conference he spoke at about six weeks ago.<br />
CJ: That was the first wave, of course, that he spoke about six weeks ago,<br />
but this current dispute certainly suits your purposes doesn't it, to paint<br />
a picture of the industrial mayhem you say would ensue under a<br />
Coalition government?<br />
PM: No industrial dispute in this sense suits my purposes. My purposes<br />
are for industrial peace, they are for low inflation, high productivity and<br />
high employment growth which is what we have at the moment. We<br />
have the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940, we have an </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
inflation rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent. We have 2.5 per cent productivity<br />
growth and 3 to 4 per cent employment growth. You don't get that<br />
other than with a co-operative work force. How could you possibly<br />
have row inflation like this and high productivity without a co-operative<br />
work force? And, the whole consensus model, which the Government<br />
has put together under the Accords since 1983, the reason we have<br />
had declining inflation and higher productivity and a whole productivity<br />
culture in the workplace is because of the consensus model. That is,<br />
we have sensible wage outcomes in return for higher rates of<br />
economic growth and employment.<br />
Now, Mr Howard ran a conflict model all through the 1970s. What we<br />
saw then was a massive level of industrial disputes. I'd like to give you<br />
the numbers:, 790 to 70 from my recollection, I think that is exactly the<br />
numbers and it is 10 times as much. There was over 10 or 12 times<br />
more industrial disputes.<br />
CJ: Mr Keating, you say that you don't want to encourage industrial<br />
disputes and you are lauding your record on getting those numbers<br />
down, did you do anything to dissuade the blockade of Western<br />
Australia today?<br />
PM;* Understand this, I spoke at the Nurses Federation over there last<br />
week. Did you know that Richard Court has denied those nurses an<br />
$ 8 wage safety net increase now for over 12 months. We have now<br />
had to join issue with them in the federal court, in the arbitration<br />
commission to support them in having it paid. They probably won't get<br />
it paid until about next March in which case they will be 15 months<br />
waiting for an $ 8 safety net wage increase. Mr Court is absolutely<br />
vicious on these people and he has now brought in this draconian<br />
legislation and were it to be there, of course, without the protection of<br />
the federal award system people would have savage wage cuts and<br />
loss of conditions.<br />
CJ: But Mr Keating, as Mr Howard has pointed out this stunt isn't he says<br />
about work place conditions or about pay, it's about politics. It's about<br />
political donations from union dues and secret ballots for strikes.<br />
PM: Understand this, it is about the whole nature of the Court government's<br />
industrial relations. There is a whole community reaction to Mr Court<br />
over there and that Is what's on. Mr Howard would like to think<br />
otherwise, but you see, It has basically blown up on him. The same<br />
way as Mr Kennett's legislation blew up on him three years ago. Mr<br />
Kennett was telling the Business Council a week ago ' don't worry,<br />
when the Federal Liberals get in we'll have the overarching federal<br />
legislation so my west Victorian legislation will be able to work.' He<br />
said ' the employees will have nowhere to go, they will be trapped'. In<br />
other words, there will be Western Australian legislation right across<br />
the country. I gave the example in the Parliament yesterday of a<br />
librarian who was in touch with us in Victoria, who is not under the<br />
No 020 UZ/ U<br />
16 -OCT c </p>
<p>TEL t t2J5 21 : 11 No . U2U<br />

federal system, she has a wage now of $ 35,000, applied for another<br />
job as a librarian in a part of Melbourne that suited her convenience to<br />
her living and the wage on offer was $ 19,000. From $ 35,000 down to<br />
$ 19,000 because she couldn't get the protection of the federal awards,<br />
so she is staying where she is.<br />
Now, you get that legislation across the country and you will find a<br />
massive reaction, no one is going to have 20 and 30 per cent pay cuts<br />
or in her case nearly a 50 per cent pay cut. Nobody is going to be<br />
accepting that and that is what this is about. All of John Howard's<br />
words are codes for wage cuts for the bottom end of the work force.<br />
He-was out telling ACOSS last week, ' look, in some countries where<br />
we have flexibility there are higher levels of employment growth ie<br />
America'. You have heard the US Labour Secretary Robert Reich<br />
recently talking about an army of working poor in America where<br />
wages have been falling for 16 years. Sure they have had strong<br />
employment growth, but there is literally an army of working poor and it<br />
has done nothing for their economic growth, they are not growing<br />
faster ever than at about 2.5 per cent.<br />
CJ: Mr Keating, you have announced yesterday, if we can just move on to<br />
another subject very briefly, the return of Don Russell our Washington<br />
Ambassador..<br />
PM: Can I just finish on this point, I was asked directly in the Parliament<br />
yesterday did I support this strike? I said I neither endorse nor<br />
t disendorse It and I didn't endorse it in Western Australia. These are<br />
alt words put into my mouth. Mr Howard is conveniently in the<br />
Canberra studio this morning to put words into my mouth, to say that I<br />
support the strike and that I am basically in -some way behind it. I<br />
didn't even know about it before I went to Western Australia, to be<br />
frank with you. I haven't endorsed i t, but you see, he knows that it is a<br />
foretaste of things to come for the community. He knows that the low<br />
levels of industrial disputes now and the whole consensus model is up<br />
for grabs were he to become Prime Minister and he knows I'll make<br />
this point over and over again. That is why he got himself out of bed<br />
and got shaved and sat in the studio at eight o'clock, showered and<br />
dressed with nowhere to go at eight o'clock, to put the spurs into me<br />
over policies that he supports.<br />
CJ: He is very keen to reply to what you have just said Mr Keating if that is<br />
ok with you.<br />
PM: The thing is, of course he would. He would hang there if it was 1: 00am<br />
in the morning, he would be hanging around trying to put his view. But<br />
understand what his view is about, it is the rancid view of people that<br />
despise working people, who want to push their wages and conditions<br />
down. Look at Richard Court, not happy simply to defeat Carmen<br />
Lawrence he had to try to destroy her personally with this vicious royal<br />
commission. He is vicious. He is vicious on the work force and don't<br />

under estimate the degree of community reaction. I'm not talking<br />
about union reaction, but community reaction in Western Australia.<br />
And what the Australian community have got to know, were John<br />
Howard to become Prime Minster, he would see this every week of the<br />
year every week of every year that he was In office and why would<br />
people turn their back on the lowest level of disputes that we are<br />
seeing now 2.5 to 3 per cent inflation and high productivity growth<br />
to take back the model that Mr Howard left as a smouldering ruin in<br />
1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.<br />
CJ: Mr Howard is still here in the studio.<br />
JH: Well, the Prime Minister has had an opportunity over the last few<br />
minutes to behave like a national leader, to behave like a Prime<br />
Minister, not to behave like a partisan politician. He could over the last<br />
few minutes have condemned the strike, he could have called upon<br />
the unions not to precede with it, he could have repudiated it, but what<br />
does he do? Cowardly like and betraying his responsibilities as Prime<br />
Minister Pontius Pilate like, he sits on the fence and he says ' I neither<br />
endorse it nor disendorse it'. In other words, he is not prepared to<br />
express a view on the inflicting of pain and suffering and discomfort on<br />
1.3 mil lion of his fellow Australians. If ever there was a demonstration<br />
that this whiole thing is a political cook-up between the Labor Party and<br />
the ACTU, designed to create the impression that if there is a change<br />
of government there will be industrial chaos. He knows damn well that<br />
there is nothing in our policy that is going to out the wages of workers.<br />
He is the world expert at cutting the wages of Australian workers, he<br />
has cut their wages over the last 13 years, he has increased their<br />
mortgage payments on average by 50 per cent, he has produced a<br />
higher sustained level of unemployment of Australian workers than any<br />
other Prime Minister since the end of World War 11 and what he is<br />
about now is trying to generate a phoney political strike which is doing<br />
real damage to the people of Western Australia. Instead of<br />
condemning it, Instead of being the leader of the country, he is being<br />
the provoker of severe industrial pain and disputation on the Western<br />
Australian people. If people suffer today in Western Australia Paul<br />
Keating is to blame and the last 10 minutes, particularly the last two<br />
minutes of his interview have proved conclusively his political<br />
motivation and attitude regarding this strike.<br />
CJ: A brief response from you Prime Minister, are you going to condemn<br />
the strike?<br />
PM; That is a sort of condescending and supercilious line: " I have behaved<br />
like a partisan politician." What were Mr Howard's first remarks to<br />
come on the program to lay the responsibility at my door In precisely<br />
the partisan way he always behaves. Secondly, it is not my matter.<br />
This dispute is a dispute brought on by the Western Australian Liberal<br />
Party( s legislation. It is a dispute that exists in the state of Western<br />
Australia as a consequence of their behaviour. It is not my matter. I<br />
16 uct .95 21 11 HO .020 P -U4/ Q </p>
<p>TEL<br />
am neither endorsing it nor disendorsing it. It is not my matter, but it is<br />
very much the matter of the Liberal Party. It is very much the matter of<br />
the legislation of the Liberal Party. Let me just correct another thing<br />
Mr Howard said, there haven't been wage cuts through the period of<br />
the government's office. There has been a 7.2 per cent real wage<br />
increase, real wage increase, during the 12 years of the government's<br />
office. A 20 per cent increase per capita in household disposable<br />
income and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income<br />
over 12 years. That is real, 40 per cent real, 20 per cent per capita<br />
real and 7 per cent to real wages. So, Mr Howard is wrong on three<br />
counts. He comes onto your program simply to make political points in a very<br />
partisan way as an apologia for the viciousness of legislation, the<br />
thrust of which, of course, he entirely supports.<br />
CJ: Mr Keating, Mr Howard, thank you both for your time.<br />
