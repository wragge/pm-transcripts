FRPRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
ON HIS VISIT TO PARKES, N. S. W.,<br />
17 MAY 1975<br />
Parkes is typical of the country towns and<br />
cities benefiting from the policies of the Australian<br />
Government. For toro long people in country tow n s<br />
have been putting up with services and amenities inferior<br />
to those in the capital cities. The Labor Government is<br />
determined that townspeople in the country will enjoy a<br />
standard of living equal to the best in Australia.<br />
Our opponents seem to think that a<br />
Government's responsibility in country areas ends with<br />
the farmer, the man on the land. Certainly we recognise<br />
that prosperity in country areas depends largely on a<br />
prosperous rural community. At the same time, we are<br />
not going to neglect the millions of Australians<br />
employees and families who live in towns like Parkes.<br />
They deserve the same standards of education, the same<br />
standards of housing, the same opportunities for health<br />
and recreation as Australians in the major cities.<br />
One of the first acts of this Government<br />
was to empower the Grants Commission to recommend<br />
W assistance for local authorities. In this way the<br />
Grants Commission will be able to alleviate inequalities<br />
between regions, in the same way that it has acted to<br />
remove inequalities between the States. In its first<br />
set of recommendations, the Commission allocated more than<br />
$ 21 million for local councils in New South Wales. Parkes<br />
Municipal Council received $ 76,000 for 1974-75.<br />
That money has been provided free of interest,<br />
as a non-repayable grant. It can be used as the council<br />
sees fit for-the benefit of the people of Parkes.<br />
Under the Regional Employment Development<br />
Scheme, the Australian Government has approved<br />
assistance to the Parkes Municipality amounting to<br />
$ 395,000 to date. The Parkes District Hospital has<br />
received REDS grants totalling $ 253,000 for 7 projects<br />
which have created 73 new jobs. Shires within the<br />
Parkes Employment Office Area have received Government<br />
assistance under REDS totalling $ 765,000. / 2 </p>
<p>e -2-<br />
Grants to Parkes and Forbes since 1972<br />
for aged persons' homes and hostels total $ 1,497,171.<br />
The pre-school in Dalton Street, Parkes,<br />
has qualified for Australian Government recurrent<br />
assistance since January 1974.,' In the present<br />
financial year the school is receiving $ 4491. Recurrent<br />
grants totalling more than $ 41,000 have been made<br />
since January 1973 to 5 non-government schools in'<br />
Parkes Holy Family Primary School, Marist Borthers'<br />
Primary School, St Joseph's Infants School,<br />
Westview Special School and Our Lady of Mercy College.<br />
As part of its program to improve health<br />
care sercvices throughout Australi1a, the Goverrnment is<br />
establishing a Community Health Resources Centre to<br />
serve Parkes, Cowra, Forbes and Wlest Wyalong. The<br />
centre Will recruit and manage a team of nurses and<br />
other health workers to care for people and staff<br />
existing baby health centres. The project has been<br />
allocated $ 89,690 this financial year. </p>
