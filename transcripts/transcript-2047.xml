SECOND ViSiT TO US 1969<br />

EXCHANGE OF REMARKS BETWEEN PRESIDENT NIXON<br />
AND PRIME MINISTER GORTON UPON THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER'S DEPARTURE 7 MAY 1969<br />
PRESIDENT NIXON: Mr Prime Minister, as you leave the White House<br />
and you are not leaving the country yet, because we hope you will stay<br />
here for a few more days I want you to know how grateful I am for your<br />
returning to the United States after having been here at the time of<br />
President Eisenhower' s funeral, and for giving us the opportunity to have<br />
a very full discussion of the major issues that are not really between us<br />
so much as they involve our common interest for peace and security in the<br />
Pacific area. This talk has been most helpful, as far as I am<br />
concerned, and as far as the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defence<br />
are concerned. We have opened a line of communication which will be<br />
used very extensively in the months and years ahead in pursuing our mutual<br />
purposes and goals in the world.<br />
I want to say, finally, that as one who has been to your<br />
country on two occasions, I hope to visit there again. And, like all<br />
Americans, I have a very deep personal feeling, respect, for your country,<br />
for your people and for the leadership that you have provided for your<br />
people. We are very proud to have been your ally and friend in<br />
great struggles in the past and to be your ally and friend as we deal with the<br />
probi ens of the future.<br />
PRIME MINISTER GORTON<br />
Thank you very much, Mr President.<br />
I feel that the written statement which you have made,<br />
and which was agreed between us, gives a clear indication of those matters<br />
of common concern which we were able to discuss in such depth. 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I think that we have reached an arrangement for close,<br />
constant consultation between our two selves on matters which might<br />
arise in the future and that this will be a great advantage to both of our<br />
countries. I can only express gratitude to you for the hospitality<br />
that you have extended, for the complete openness of your talks with me,<br />
and a belief that not only the talks but the underlining of the importance<br />
of the ANZUS Treaty to both of our countries which was evolved from the<br />
talks are of considerable significance to Australia and to Australia's<br />
future and I believe that that, in turn, is of some significance to the<br />
United States and to the nations of the Free World as a whole.<br />
Thank you. </p>
