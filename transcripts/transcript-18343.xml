    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Gillard Government today announced its plan to tackle problem gambling, helping the five million Australians affected by problem gambling in this country.</p>
<p>This plan means the Gillard Government will do more to tackle problem gambling than any Commonwealth Government in Australia's history.</p>
<p>The Government will act to:</p>
<p> * 	Undertake a large scale trial of mandatory pre-commitment;<br />
 * 	Expand pre-commitment technology to every poker machine across the country, that could then be used for mandatory pre-commitment if it is supported by a trial.</p>
<p>Rolling the technology out to every machine now ensures that we will be ready to flick the switch to a best-practice mandatory pre-commitment system, if the trial results support it.</p>
<p>We believe this evidence-based pathway to help problem gamblers and their families will gain the necessary support to pass the current Parliament.</p>
<p>It is our intention to introduce legislation in the first Parliamentary session of this year which will require that:</p>
<p> * 	All new poker machines manufactured from 2013 must be capable of supporting pre-commitment; and<br />
 * 	By 31 December 2016 all poker machines must be part of a state linked pre-commitment system, except eligible small venues which will have longer.</p>
<p>We will also continue to work on pre-commitment technology through the COAG Select Council on Gaming Reform. At this forum in May last year, state and territory gaming ministers agreed to support the required infrastructure for pre-commitment technology in all jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government understands that many Australians enjoy gambling responsibly. But for others it can have devastating consequences.</p>
<p>Problem gambling ruins lives.</p>
<p>That's why in November 2008 we asked the Productivity Commission to inquire into problem gambling in Australia.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission found that problem gambling affects up to five million Australians, including friends, family and employers of people with a gambling problem.</p>
<p>These far reaching impacts are why the Australian Government is delivering genuine, long-lasting reforms to help problem gamblers and their families.</p>
<p>The Government is also taking a range of other actions to support problem gamblers and their families including:</p>
<p> * 	Introducing a $250 daily withdrawal limit from ATMs in gaming venues (excluding casinos) by 1 February 2013;<br />
 * 	Electronic warnings and cost of play displays on poker machines by 2016;<br />
 * 	Additional counselling support with 50 new financial counsellors to work with problem gamblers, and expanding the reach of Gambling Help Online;<br />
 * 	Strengthening self-exclusion arrangements; and<br />
 * 	Improving training for staff in pokies venues.</p>
<p>Further, the Government recognises that gambling online and sports betting are a growing concern, and we will:</p>
<p> * 	Ban the promotion of live odds during sports coverage;<br />
 * 	Extend pre-commitment to online betting services;<br />
 * 	Crack down on online sports betting companies offering credit and introduce stricter limits on betting inducements; and<br />
 * 	Increase the powers of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to enforce these new rules.</p>
<p>The actions the Gillard Government is taking will be the most significant and far reaching national reforms to tackle problem gambling ever seen in this country.</p>
