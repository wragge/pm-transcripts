    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I congratulate President George Bush on his inauguration.</p>
<p>I wish him well in the formidable task of leading the most powerful nation on earth.</p>
<p>The President takes office at a time of great prosperity for the United States but also with some uneven signs emerging in the United States' economy.</p>
<p>The new Administration assembled by the President is both talented and highly experienced.</p>
<p>A number of the members of the Bush team are very familiar with Australia and personally known to me and members of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will work closely with the new Bush Administration.</p>
<p>Inevitably there will be differences on certain issues but overwhelmingly the goals of our governments and our societies are similar.</p>
<p>We seek a stable, prosperous world based on democratic ideals and expanding equality of opportunities for the peoples of all nations.</p>
<p>21 January 2001</p>
