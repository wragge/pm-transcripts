    <subjects>Launch of Spirit of Mateship Yacht,  Governor General,  Australia-Indonesia relationship. </subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It’s really good to be here at <em>Mates 4 Mates</em> and to help launch the <em>Spirit of Mateship. </em>As I said we owe it to the members and former members of our armed forces to stand by them in their time of need and <em>Mates 4 Mates</em> are people who are there for each other in tough times. So, I wish them good luck and God speed on the way to Hobart.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister what is your reaction to the Governor General’s comments and do you think they are appropriate for someone in her position?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It’s more than appropriate for the Governor General approaching the end of her term to express a personal view on a number of subjects and that's what she was doing, she was expressing a personal view and, as you would expect from Quentin Bryce, she did it with grace and style.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] either of those arguments?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, obviously different people have different views on these subjects, and as I said, she was expressing her view, others express their views but whatever our Governor-General does she does it with grace and style.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, have you written to the Indonesian President?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I have written to President Yudhoyono and the letter is now in the process of being delivered.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>And what did it say?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think it would be wrong of me to talk about what I've said to the President before the President has actually received it but I just want to stress that as far as I am concerned one of the fundamental tasks of any Australian government, but certainly one of the fundamental tasks of my Government is to ensure that our relationship with Indonesia goes from strength to strength. Now, obviously there will be good days and there will be better days but my determination is to ensure that the relationship is constantly improving and my gratitude, as always, to President Yudhoyono who has been a very good friend to Australia, one of the best friends we've ever had.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
