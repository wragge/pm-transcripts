TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />

RADIO INTERVIEW NEIL MITCHELL 3AW<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Mr Howard, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning.<br />
MITCHELL: Thanks for your time. You must feel a bit like Father Christmas. You'll run this $ 1 billion Federation<br />
Fund yourself What are you going to spend it on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Big projects.<br />
MITCHELL: Where? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
All around Australia, things to build for the future. We're not going to fritter it away on a thousand<br />
obelisks. We're going to largely make it available for big projects which are about renewing the<br />
infrastructure of this country.<br />
MITCHELL: What sort of projects are you...<br />
MITCHELL: I am going to write to the State Premniers and they will have some ideas. I've got a few ideas of my<br />
own but they are projects that will generate a lot ofjobs in the construction phase and they're projects<br />
that are about laying down some infrastructure that will be available to the Australian people for<br />
decades into the next century. It's very much about the future of Australia in the new century. It is<br />
called the Federation Fund. It will reach its peak at the time we celebrate 100 years of Australia as a<br />
nation. Now a billion dollars is a large amount but it's not inelastic and I would like to see a number of<br />
major projects. I have no doubt that the states have already worked up a few projects and they will be<br />
very happy to submit to me. At the end of the day we will decide where the money is going to be<br />
spent.<br />

MITCHELL: Are we talking about monuments or things that can be used by the people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No we're talking about things that will be of practical use to people. I mean one of the projects I've<br />
already earmarked is the National Museum in Canberra. I have no doubt that the Northern Territory<br />
and South Australian Governments will be putting their views to me about the Darwin to Alice<br />
Springs railway. I am not saying we are going to support that or reject it. I am just saying that they are<br />
the sorts of things that people will be putting up.<br />
MITCHELL: Can you assure us it's not going to embrace the whiteboard style of managemnent, not just marginal<br />
electorates? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Absolutely not. We're talking here about big projects that will be of benefit to the whole of the<br />
community or the whole of the region. This will be a very good exercise for the regional areas of<br />
Australia. It will generate jobs, it will give new hope, it will give new vision and new enthusiasm to the<br />
regional areas of Australia and that is very important because the levels of economnic activity in some<br />
of those regions do need resuscitation.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Is it tempting though to use it as a slush fuind? You're coming into an election, you've got a billion<br />
dollars sitting there, you've got the reason to spend it. It would be very tempting.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I am not going to do that and I am going to run it in a way that people will see that we are<br />
spending the money wisely for thle future and we're not frittering it away on a thousand little projects<br />
of dubious national benefit.<br />
MITCHELL: Will thle decision be made by yourself or by an adviser?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we will get advice from our bureaucracy but the final decision will be made by a committee of<br />
Ministers. I mean we were elected to make decisions. This idea that you fight an election campaign,<br />
you get elected and then you hand over the decision making authority to everybody else. I mean,<br />
what's the point of going into politics? It's our job, the people vote for us and if they don't like us, they<br />
throw us out but while we are there it's our responsibility to take the decision and people can judge the<br />
quality of my decisions on that as they can on any other issue quite fairly and squarely but I can assure<br />
you, it's not going to be a rerun of Ros Kelly's whiteboard. It is going to be very much a visionary<br />
building for the future, investing for the next millennium approach.<br />

When would you expect the project to be approved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Soon but I'm not going to put a month on it.<br />
MIITCHELL: Okay, on something else, unemployment. It's a big....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sorry 1 didn't hear that.<br />
MITCHELL: Unemployment. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, could you repeat that because there was a cut in from your person speaking and I just didn't hear<br />
your question. Could you repeat it?<br />
MITCHELL: I'm sorry. We must have a technical problem. I will address that. Unemployment, you're predicting 8%<br />
by next year. It's not very good, is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:'<br />
Unemployment remains bad until you get rid of it altogether and I suppose there is a level of<br />
unemployment that is in a personal sense satisfactory but we did inherit an 8.5% rate. It had gone to<br />
I1I% in the early 1990s and it was deeply entrenched and it will take time to remove and to get down,<br />
it will take time. We think that if you have several years of strong economic growth, we believe that as<br />
the benefits of our industrial relations reform work through, and remember they only came into<br />
operation at the beginning of the year, and I am very disappointed incidentally on that score that the<br />
Labor Party has now announced that it is going to oppose the unfair dismissal law changes that we<br />
announced a few weeks ago in our small business statement, and that was the proposal whereby every<br />
firm employing fewer than 15 people would be exempted from the unfair dismissal laws altogether in<br />
relation to people who had been on their payroll for less than 12 months.<br />
Now we've put that up in the form of a regulation and the Labor Party has indicated it will vote<br />
against that regulation in the Senate and if, as I fear, the Democrats and Senator Harradine support the<br />
Labor Party then that regulation will be disallowed and that will disappoint the job hopes of many<br />
people and it will also anger quite rightly the small business community of Australia who sees the<br />
unfair dismissal law in its present form as a major barrier to job generation. It's a major disincentive to<br />
taking on more staff. We are trying to fix that but we are continually being frustrated in that<br />
department by the non-Government parties in the Senate.<br />
MITCHELL: Okay, you're talking about say, the middle of next year, predicting That means you would have<br />
dropped haif a percentage point in just over two years in government. Are you saying that that's<br />

( inaudible) or that lies with the Opposition and the minor parties? Is that why, I mean, you must be<br />
disappointed by that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Neil, to the extent that the minor parties and the Labor Party stop this Government through their<br />
numbers in the Senate doing sensible things to reduce unemployment then they are partly to blame, I<br />
say partly to blame. Neil, I never pretended before the election that 1 could solve unemployment<br />
overnight. Unemployment is always the last thing to come right. We have laid the foundations, we<br />
have changed the industrial relations system quite dramatically, not as far as we would have liked. We<br />
have seen falls of 1.5% in interest rates, we have sustainably low inflation, we have given massive<br />
incentives to small business, the latest of them will start on the first of July with a $ 250 million capital<br />
gains tax relief We have done a lot of things that will take time to flow through the economy.<br />
MITCHELL: But I look through the United States and I see them under 1 look at New Zealand which is<br />
( inaudible) I look at most of Asia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, but may I say, you look at Germany which is 12.5%, you look at France which is the same.<br />
Look, the United States has a significantly lower unemployment rate than Australia and the reason for<br />
that is the United States does not have any minimum wage safety net of any consequence. Now this<br />
country traditionally has taken the view that there should be a decent minimum wage and it's part of<br />
thle Culture of Australia that there is a decent minimum wage and you have a lot of working poor in the<br />
United States and you have a lot of people in the United States who are quite literally begging on the<br />
streets because they don't have any welfare assistance.<br />
Now I am as you know a small government man but I will never support an Australian community<br />
where quite literally, people are begging on the streets because they have no assistance at all and sadly,<br />
much in all as I admire a lot about the United States, sadly that is an element of the United States<br />
social welfare system and you have to strike an Australian balance between a freer labour market and<br />
having no social security safety net at all and the Coalition has struck that balance. We have a much<br />
freer labour market and therefore more conducive to employment growth than our predecessors but<br />
we're not prepared to throw people on the scrap heap as occurs in some other countries.<br />
MITCHELL: Where are the initiatives in this budget for jobs, for youth unemployment in particular? Where is the<br />
hope for people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If you create an economy which is growing more strongly, which has the prospect of perhaps lower<br />
interest rates over time, which is going to put aside an investment of a billion dollars in job creating<br />
infrastructure projects, if you have savings initiatives which are going to encourage people to save into<br />
the fuiture, all of those things create a climate of hope and optimism. Now Neil, we inherited a $ 10.5<br />
billion deficit. By year three of our first term of Government we will have turned that into a surplus of<br />
$ 1.6 billion.<br />

The markets are not impressed by...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Neil, Neil, are you saying that we should always be driven by markets?<br />
MITCH ELL:<br />
No, of course not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You're asking me what the hope is. Now the first responsibility of any government is to get the<br />
nation's finances right. That's the first responsibility. Now the nation's finances were in a mess when<br />
we came to power. We had to do that. People can sit on the sidelines and spinl, and tell stories and<br />
p~ eople can criticise it. That's fair enough but it's our responsibility to fix the nation's finances and I am<br />
very proud to say that at the end of our first term in office we will have turned a $ 10.5 billion deficit<br />
into a $ 1.6 billion surplus but by the year 2000, we will have almost cut in half the debts of the<br />
Australian people compared to what they were in 1995. Now that is a monumental achievement.<br />
MITCHELL: If that's Such a monumental achievement, why aren't the markets doing handstands...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I am sorry the markets, the markets are not the only things that govern our lives. If I was a Prime<br />
Minister that was told by the markets what to do I would be failing the great majority of the Australian<br />
people. The markets have seen interest rates fall. The markets overall have been very buoyant for the<br />
last 18 months and they remain very strong but you can't avoid the fact that we inherited big debts.<br />
MITCHELL: But do you think this will now bring interest rates down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is a matter ultimately to be determined, if I may say so, by market forces.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Of course.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Exactly, exactly. Of course it's going to be determined by market forces but I tell you this, Neil, that<br />
Cutting debt further, producing a surplus in year two of this budgetary cycle, that's 98/ 99, that means<br />
that there is downward, and not upward pressure on interest rates. In other words when the monetary<br />
authorities next look at interest rates and I'm not telling them what they ought to do, that's a matter for<br />
the monetary authority, but when they next look at interest rates they will know that the Government<br />
has done its bit. The Government has not added to interest rate pressure. The Government this year<br />
will repay $ 5 billion of the debts of the Australian people. Now.. 5 f 1106/ 3170:/ 3947: 5 9<br />

MITCHELL: At least the Government has set the climate for lower interest rates...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course we have set the climate. Now you ask any small businessman what has bugged them most<br />
over the last ten years and they will say high interest rates. There is nothing that helps small business<br />
more than a continued climate of lower or falling interest rates.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard if we can just move away from what you think or the big picture, look at the average, the<br />
battler if you like. Now the rebate on savings is of concern, isn't going to help most people, is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well people who don't have...<br />
MITCH4ELL: . sort of figures which, the reasonable benefit. $ 60 000 in the bank to get $ 450 back. Most people are<br />
lucky if they've got a couple of grand in the bank.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but it's not only available for interest on bank deposits. It's available for personal contributions<br />
towards superannuation. It's available for all of the returns on investments you make right across the<br />
board. It's not limited to bank savings, that's a mistake. Now I know that some people won't benefit<br />
from this just in the same way that people who don't have children don't benefit from family payments.<br />
People who aren't retired don't benefit from measures that help self flunded retirees. You've got to look<br />
at all of the measures that we have brought in since we came to power.<br />
MITCHELL: Superannuation. Let's look at that. Am I right that it requires $ 3000, you put $ 3000 into super and<br />
you get $ 450 back as rebates.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The maximum you can get is $ 450 and because it's capped at $ 3000, that is right but if you put in<br />
$ 2000 you get proportionately less. I mean, you don't have to put in the $ 3000. Well Neil...<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Not many people have got the money to put . Have you got $ 60 000 in the bank?<br />
MITCH ELL:<br />
No I haven't got $ 60 000 but leave me out of it, leave me out of it. I don't want to get into personal<br />
analysis. But you say what have we done for savings? I mean, this is a 15% tax break for all savings.<br />
For years and years and years people have said to me you've got to give the community an incentive to<br />
6 of I1 063/ 7I: 50<br />
14 May 1997 06/ 30/ 97 17: 35: 00 </p>
<p>14 tMtpy1: 7// www~. ila. gov. au/ piic/ pressrel/ iniiclie2. litiil<br />
save. Young people have said what is the point in saving for a homne. There's no incentive to do so.<br />
This 1 5% tax break will be available for savings towards the deposit on a home. This 15% tax break<br />
will be available for a rental streamn from an investment income. This 15% will be available for<br />
personal contributions to super. It is the first time since federation that any Government in this country<br />
has given a general tax break to savings. Now of course you can say to me, why isn't it more? I'll tell<br />
you why it's not more, because we still have big debts, because we did inherit a deficit of $ 10.5 billion<br />
and we had to use a lot of money to repay that debt, the debts of our predecessors. That's why it's not<br />
more. I'd like it to be more, I'd like it to be far more generous but it can't be because we can't afford it.<br />
Now it's easy for anybody to say, well, why isn't it more? It's not enough. Some people won't benefit.<br />
Of course that's true. That is always the case.<br />
MITCHELL: I can understand why... 1 think it's being oversold a bit, that's all as being this marvellous carrot in the<br />
Budget. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but this represents a psychological shift towards savings, the like of which we haven't seen before.<br />
You know as well as I do, Neil, it's not only the reality of the measure but also the perception of a<br />
measure and the psychological impact of a measure, the symbolism of a measure. Now for the first<br />
time ever, an Australian Government has unambiguously said, we will favour savings. Politicians in<br />
years past have preached to the community about the value of thrift, the need to save, the desirability<br />
of putting away a nest egg, of building for the future but they've done damn all through the tax system<br />
to encourage it to happen and for the first time ever we are giving a general break to savings and that..<br />
MITCHELL: Isn't this just the beginning though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Neil, I don't want on the run to say something that will come back to some kind of promise about<br />
further action. All Prime Ministers and all Treasurers always like to do more to assist people. This is a<br />
very powerful measure. It's a very, very strong indication of the preference that this Government gives<br />
to savings.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, the medical area. I will be talking to Dr Wooldridge later in the morning about this. It's<br />
one very general area that concerns me is where you're addressing drugs in a pretty sensitive area,<br />
blood pressure, hypertension, depression, those sort of drugs and saying to people they might have to<br />
change the sort of drugs they take or pay more. That could affect people who have been taking certain<br />
drugs for a long period of time and their comfort I suppose. You've got vulnerable people with these<br />
sort of illnesses and you could be put in the position of having to make a decision to change which will<br />
unsettle them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Neil, this is a hard area and it's hard because the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is very expensive,<br />
very expensive indeed and it's growing at a faster rate, the cost of it is growing at a faster rate than<br />
most items in the health and welfare side of the budget and what we're going to do is take the advice<br />
of an expert group about what is in effect a benchmark generic drug. It is the case that there is some 7 f II06/ 301/ 977: 3 5: 01<br />

7of 11 </p>
<p>14 Miy1997iltp:/ g/ wovw awu./ nplinac / pressrel/ initcliel2. fitiinI<br />
overprescribing, or how shall I put it, relaxed prescribing in these areas and it's very easy of course for<br />
a fear campaign to be run on it but equally we have a responsibility to see that taxpayers' money is<br />
intelligently spent, and in the nature of things you have a new drug discovery and then for a long<br />
period of time that drug is very widely used, and then there is a cheaper generic drug developed in the<br />
same area that has the same capability. We're simply saying that if on the advice of an expert group<br />
that generic, equally effective drug does the job then it's not unreasonable to say that if people want to<br />
use a more expensive drug they should have to pay a small premium for it.<br />
MITCHELL: Most of the drugs, it must do the job rather because side effects can vary from brand to brand.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is why we're going to get the advice of expert people. Now I acknowledge this is a sensitive area<br />
but the fact that something is sensitive doesn't relieve a Government of the obligation to try and work<br />
at it. I note with interest that the President of the Australian Council of Social Services, the main<br />
spokesman for the needy in the community has said that in principle he supports the proposal although<br />
he is worried about how it might be implemented and I also understand that cautious support has been<br />
expressed by the pharmacists. Now Dr Wooldridge will discuss the matter at length with the doctors.<br />
It will involve some discipline on doctors and some of them will criticise it but I just say to your<br />
listeners, Neil that this is an area which is very expensive and we can't ignore it. I mean, from a<br />
political point of view the easiest thing is to say, walk away from it, leave it but that wouldn't be a<br />
particularly good use of taxpayers' money.<br />
MITCHELL: Tax avoidance. Now there are indications that it is serious. How, or more serious?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There are a whole raft of measures that we are introducing there. I have no time at all for people who<br />
avoid their tax liabilities and I say to them in whatever strata of society they are, they can expect no<br />
sympathy from my Government, none whatsoever. If everybody paid their proper share of tax we'd all<br />
be paying less and we'd have a lot more money to spend in desirable areas of need and it really makes<br />
me sick when I hear stories of people who have very high income streams who try to organise their<br />
affairs in a way to avoid tax and they can't expect any sympathy at all from me.<br />
MITCHELL: The child care areas. Now as I understand it 7000 places capped per year. Is that right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The 7000 cap next year and the year after.<br />
MITCHELL: Now how far short will that fall? Your own Department was saying demand would be about 20 000.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes it could fall that far short. It's very, very hard to estimate. It depends on the take up rate, it<br />
80t, 11 06/ 30/ 97 17: 35: 02<br />
14 May 199.7 </p>
<p>14M ay'~ 2littp: g// owvw. uw/ f. piiiilca/ pressrel/ iinitclicl2. ltiil<br />
depends on a whole range of things. We have not cut the entitlements in any way. We have introduced<br />
that measure and the other measure is that for parents using child care for non work related purposes<br />
we're putting a quite generous limit of 20 hours a week on that. The former Government proposed a<br />
limit of 13 hours a week. We thought that was a bit too limited and we've put it at 20. We understand<br />
that the average usage is about 13 hours a week for people who want child care for non work related<br />
purposes. That's a very fair balance.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Mr Howard, if I could ask you something else and it does sort of lead you back to the budget area. Is<br />
it correct that the Liberal Party will give preferences to Pauline Hanson at the next election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, to my knowledge and can I say at the outset that this is a matter that will be decided by the<br />
Liberal Party organisation close to the next election, but no decision as I understand it has been taken<br />
and I was asked a question about this in the Parliament yesterday and I simply refused to sort of play<br />
Mr Beazley's political game. We will decide how we allocate preferences when we get closer to the<br />
election. MITCH ELL:<br />
Would you be involved in such a decision in such a contentious area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I guess I will get consulted but the organisation decides these things at the end of the day but I'm not<br />
going to get drawn into a talk about preferences. We're two years away from an election and a lot can<br />
happen over that two year period, and can I remind your listeners in case they think there's anything<br />
odd about this, at the last Federal election in my own electorate of Bennelong the Labor Party gave its<br />
preferences to Australians Against Further Immigration ahead of me. Now I didn't complain about<br />
that. I understood why they did it but let's not have any preaching about...<br />
MITCHELL: No but if you're going to take the moral high ground.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm not endeavouring to, I'm not criticising, they're the people who are trying to take the moral high<br />
ground and I am pointing out how hypocritical it was and I also point out that on this issue it took Mr<br />
Beazley a hiell of a long time to expel Graham Campbell from the Labor Party, he having expressed<br />
views on certain issues which he is now criticising as being expressed by the Member for Oxley. I am<br />
not endeavouring to preach to the Labor Party about this. It is endeavouring to do that to me and I am<br />
pointing out that it has feet of clay on the issue of preferences.<br />
M ITCHIELL:<br />
I take your point it's a long time off but...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's just silly. 9 f Ii06/ 301/ 977: 3 5: 03<br />

MITCHIELL: The situation is you would be involved in one way or another in the decision...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would be surprised at some stage if I were not consulted but ultimately, can I assure you ultimately<br />
these things are determined close to an election campaign by the state organisation. I mean, quite<br />
literally that does happen because as leader you are involved in an election campaign and you're racing<br />
around the country but I don't rule out the possibility that they would consult me. I'm not going to say<br />
that. I am just saying that it's two years off I am not going to get into a talk now about how<br />
preferences are going to be allocated. A lot of things can happen over the next two years in relation to<br />
the juxtaposition and the sensitivity of political parties towards Independents.<br />
M ITCHELL:<br />
The next question and that will lead me back to the budget. Media policy I interviewed James Packer<br />
on Monday. When will there be a decision?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We will take a decision soon. We have had other things on our plate this week and we will take a<br />
decision that I believe will be consistent with good media policy. I know the views of Mr Packer but<br />
of course the Parliament and nobody else will decide whether we are going to change the law.<br />
Everybody has got a point of view on this and can tell you, most people talk from self interest.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Do you have a view on the breaking up of the Fairfax empire?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've got quite a number of views but I think my colleagues are entitled to know those views, much in<br />
all as I respect your programme, my colleagues are entitled to know all of those views before anybody<br />
else. We haven't taken a decision yet. Everybody under the sun has put a view to us. All the<br />
proprietors have. The journalists have. The community has. I understand and all I've got to say is that<br />
nobody has a monopoly of high minded policy on this. I've got to say that everybody talks from self<br />
interest, including the journalists. They will tell you they don't but of course they do. I mean, they<br />
believe in absolute, they have an absolute view in one particular area. They see all evil in newspaper<br />
proprietors. Newspaper proprietors have views, the public has views and we've got to take them all<br />
into account., There's a balance between foreign investment and domestic ownership and there's also a<br />
strong view about diversity and I think I made the comment on your programme the other day that I<br />
thought that people onl talkback radio had more influence now than many print journalists.<br />
Now that may have offended some of the print journalists but it does remain the case. I have spent<br />
minutes talking to you about the budget, it reaches thousands of people. I spent a lot of time earlier<br />
today talking to Alan Jones. Now the comments of yourself and Alan on the budget and the way in<br />
which your listeners hear what I say about the budget I believe has a very significant influence in<br />
conditioning public attitudes. Now that is just a fact of media life and I think it's got to be recognised.<br />

I guess, just finally and quickly, that the point of those two questions, leading back to the budget, do<br />
you think the budget will cut through what's been described as the fog?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That was my description. That's the trouble, you make these comments and they keep being used.<br />
Look I think the budget will be seen as addressing the fundamentals. I think people will be grateful<br />
that mny Government in its first term will have wiped out that huge deficit and repaid so much debt. I<br />
think they will like the savings initiative. They will see it as a powerful symbol that savings are<br />
favoured in this country and that it is not just mere rhetoric that we want savings. I also think they will<br />
appreciate the Federation fund as investment in Australia's infrastructure needs.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
The budget is a ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I think it's just, it stands in its own right and it's own merit. Neil, every Government goes through<br />
some difficult periods. It was inevitable after a year that people would start to raise questions and be a<br />
touch critical in certain areas. I accept that. When you are elected after 13 years of another<br />
government and you have a big majority, people understandably think everything is going to change<br />
overnight. Now that can never happen and there is some lowering of expectations. Now I think we've<br />
gone into that phase. It doesn't trouble me and let me say I'm aware of it and I don't want anybody<br />
ever to think that I take their support for granted and that I don't listen to what they have to say.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Mr Howard, thanks for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Okay. Return to Media Interviews<br />
