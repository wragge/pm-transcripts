    <content><![CDATA[<p align="center">The measures outlined in last weekâs Budget are absolutely necessary to secure Australiaâs economic future.</p>
<p>The Budget outlines a clear plan â in fact, the only plan â that will address Laborâs debt and deficit disaster.</p>
<p>Letâs remember the problem that the Government is trying to fix.</p>
<p>When the Coalitions last left office, Australia had a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank but over six years, Labor squandered this and ran up five record deficits and a further $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt headed towards $667 billion.</p>
<p>You pay for that. You pay for that debt every single day and every month Australia is spending one billion dollars just to cover the interest on Laborâs debt.</p>
<p>At the moment we are borrowing to pay that interest, which is like a household paying the mortgage on a credit card.</p>
<p>In my view, that is simply unsustainable.</p>
<p>So through the Budget the Government delivered an Economic Action Strategy that will put Australiaâs finances back on a sustainable footing.</p>
<p>Our plan will strengthen the economy, create jobs and reduce Laborâs debt by almost $300 billion.</p>
<p>We need to take action now or an even greater burden will fall on our kidsâ generation.</p>
<p>Now, the Labor Party is desperately trying to scare people by spreading untruths about the Budget.</p>
<p>For example, they won't tell you that funding for schools and hospitals increases each and every year under our Budget.</p>
<p>And that the rate of the pension will continue to go up twice a year, every year.</p>
