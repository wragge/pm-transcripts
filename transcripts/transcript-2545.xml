EMBARGO NOT FOR RELEASE BEFORE 10.40 PM ON 5/ 2/ 72<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
" THIS WKET6"<br />
Transcrip-of Interview with the Prime Minister,<br />
the Rt Hon. William McMahon, CH, MP, on Channel 7<br />
Melbourne 5 MARCH 1972<br />
Interviewers John Boland<br />
Max Grant<br />
Q. Prime Minister, this week you will celebrate<br />
your first full year as Prime Minister, on Monday,<br />
tomorrow, and I want to ask you two things. First of all,<br />
has this been the hardest period of your p litical career,<br />
this twelve months? With hindsight, would you have taken<br />
the job, knowing what you do know now?<br />
PM: I think it has been the hardest and most<br />
unpredictable year I've known since I've been in politics,<br />
or for that miatter, anywhere else. And even if I'd known<br />
of the difficulties I would have still wanted to take the<br />
job when it was offered to me by my Party.<br />
Q. Well, now, before we discuss as many areas as<br />
we possibly can, the question exercising the minds of most<br />
Australians is " Where is the nation going in the<br />
PM: It's all up to us. But the prospects are good,<br />
providing only we stop looking over our shoulder or looking<br />
down at our feet and look at the distant horizons. Because<br />
no country has the same kind of opportunity as we have.<br />
And if we've got the energy, if we've got the willpower to<br />
go forward, of cou~ rse we will. I can give you all the<br />
reasons if you want them. But the simple answer to your<br />
questions is forward, certainly not backward, or marking<br />
time.<br />
Q. Now Prime Minister, the Gallup Poll and I'm<br />
sure you're very conscious of 4, is last week showed that the<br />
Government's popularity was down to something like 40 per<br />
cent, and that your own personal popularity was down to<br />
28 par cent, and M4r ' Whitiam's, of course, was not on a<br />
crescendo either. But how do you feel with these Gallup<br />
Pol. ls, and the situation as you see it with the polls as<br />
they are at the moment?<br />
PM: It couldn't have been taken at a more unfortunate<br />
time for me or for my P-arty. Because we've had so many crises<br />
of a kind over which we've had no control, that people would / 2 </p>
<p>IPM ( Contd.) naturally bc disappointed and theyr would reflect their<br />
disarppointmcnt in the bia-llotfz. For examnle, we had all the<br />
troubles with the rural industries, which we are slowly<br />
overcoming. We had the trouL'le in the international<br />
exchanges. We had the trouble with inflation. We had a<br />
dozen and one other kinds of trouble of an unpredictable kind.<br />
But I believe we can solve t1-hem all and I think when we see,<br />
f or example, the next figures relating to unemployment,<br />
I think they will show we've turned the corner and that we're<br />
going forward again. In other words, the ballot was taken<br />
at a bad time for us and I think for the future, we'll look<br />
forward.<br />
Q. Would you be temptted to add to your answer<br />
there " given time" " solve the problems, given time".<br />
And perhaps go further and say, " Well, there's no chance of<br />
an early election now"?<br />
PM: It depends what you mean by an early election. What<br />
I'i~* Cdve~ n done is fix a date until I've made up my mind<br />
what the date is likely to be. But you could say in the<br />
immediate future, say, the next one or two months, it's out<br />
of the question.<br />
01. But if you mention the number of crises, as you did,<br />
wouldn't you need until November, the normally thought of<br />
time for an election?<br />
PM: Maybe. But I don't want to announce a time<br />
prematurely. Prime Minister has ever done it and I don't<br />
want to break the rules. Because conditions can change and<br />
can change so rapidly. Why commit yourself when it isn't<br />
necessary?<br />
Q. But you wolildn't like to go to the polls tomorrow?<br />
PM: No, I would not. You're right there.<br />
Q. When you see a Gallup Poll like that, how does<br />
it affect a man personally, and I'm talking about you, the<br />
man, rather than the Prime Minister?<br />
PM: At the beginning it worried me, yes, but on this<br />
occasion I felt that it would turn out much the Way as it has<br />
done, so it didn't worry me greatly. Witat has preoccupied my<br />
thinking all the way through is knowing what the conditions<br />
were, what I had tQ do as the Prime Minister in order to<br />
change the conditions and in order to make certain that by the<br />
time we had held an election they had so much changed, the<br />
people would have changed their minds too.<br />
Q. Would you agree that the state of the economy<br />
will be the crucial election issue?<br />
PM: Not necessarily the crucial one, but it will<br />
be one of the mnost important of them. And that's why, at the<br />
recent Premiers' Conference, we took the very strong measures<br />
we did, primarily to reduce unem~ ployment, and two, to ensure<br />
that there was strong growth in the economy. 1 / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Q. Prime minister, on the questions of the economy<br />
and inflation, is it clearer to the Government now, that last<br />
year's Budget strategy was wrong, particularly in view of the<br />
large hand-outs that you've just mentioned, at the Premiers'<br />
Conference, to stimulate the economy and create employment<br />
opportunities, and twi~ ce, the lowering of the,.-bond rate as we've<br />
seen in recent months?<br />
PM-. If you look at the Budget strategy as such, I don't<br />
think you could say it was wrong. In fact it was right.<br />
But it was predicated on the assumption that demand would grow,<br />
particularly in the consumption area, and that assumption didn't<br />
turn out to be corrrect. And hasn't turned out to be correct<br />
unless you can look at certain special areas. So you'vye got to<br />
look at it in that way. We are worried that consumption demand<br />
hasn't increased sufficiently, butthe potential for this kind<br />
of demand to increase is pretty great and if it grew too fast,<br />
then, of course, we could be in difficulties, particularly if<br />
it superimposed itself on what we call cost inflation. So the<br />
real nroblem that we face today and Sir Henry Bolte made this<br />
clear on Thursday that if people could get a little more<br />
confidonce and stop worrying, if they could spend their money<br />
sensibly, ( and they have the money to spendj, then we'd have ahealthy<br />
economy. And we'd get it much quicker than any measures<br />
the Governmcnt could take. I think it Would be better for the<br />
country toc.<br />
0. I'm just wondering, though YOu've partly<br />
answered that question inasmuch as ynu've said that " Well,<br />
tie did need to backtrack on our original thoughts with the<br />
Budget". Is that a fair assumption, so that there must have<br />
been some areas there wher-e you felt you were right, but you've<br />
been subsequently proved to be incorrect?<br />
PM: On the basis of the assumption that demand would<br />
grow, yes, we have been incorrect. It hasn't gorwn to the extent<br />
that we wanted it to, or we eXpected it to grow. That is why<br />
ever since, well, November/ December of last year, we've<br />
progressively taken measures in order to give the econcmy the<br />
ability to expanC and then to provide funds through which the<br />
States could increase their works and local government expenditures,<br />
provide more money for the unemployment benefits. Also in the<br />
case of rural unemployment, we've provided specific grants<br />
there. As well, on the private level, we've now taken three<br />
different sets of measures to give an increasing amount of<br />
confidence to the manufacturing industries the investment<br />
allowance, research and development allowance, and now we're<br />
just about to establish a training school for industry that we<br />
hope will give them a little more confidence and a little more<br />
reason to believe that the Governme~ nt is interested in them,<br />
and wants to hElp them overcome their problems.<br />
Q. But can you get that figure of 130,000 unemployed<br />
down, and down quickly, because that is really what the voter,<br />
the average voter, looks at sometimes irrationally, perhaps?<br />
PM: I think you're right, and this is something I've<br />
believed all my political life. I've lived for full employment<br />
and I'll do evarything in my power to ensure it. And that's<br />
the approach I will take no matter what the troubles might be<br />
or who might differ with me. That's the approach I took during<br />
the discussions with the Premiers. I regarded it as a conference<br />
relating to uneriplcyment more than anything else. </p>
<p>Ccimtx?. r( Ed with overseas, some developing countries,<br />
we're still high?<br />
PM: No we are not. Thcere is no country of a<br />
comparable kind that has a rate of unemployment that is as<br />
low as ours.<br />
Q. West Germany, JaPan?<br />
PM: Well, West Germany may be a little different,<br />
but you look at the United Kingdom<br />
Q. Point seven in West Germany that's a growth<br />
country.<br />
PM: Yes, but every country wants to be a growth<br />
country. There are very very few countries that have a record<br />
comnarable tco ours. West Germany is an exceptica;-lcase.<br />
Q. Also Japan, I believe 1.3 is the latest figure<br />
th e r.<br />
PM: Well, I can't argue with you there. But what I<br />
can argue with you is that the United States, the United<br />
Kingdom, Canada, and comparable types of countries, and if you<br />
look at the comparable figures then undoubtedly ours are ever<br />
so much better. But where-we have been good, and where the<br />
economic management of the Government has obviously been good,<br />
is that over the long period since Sir Robert Menzies first<br />
came into office, our record has been exceptionally good.<br />
Q. Prime " Ministei you must have been shocked in<br />
your pleas for wages restraints and price increase restraints<br />
when BHP increased their steel prices by 5 per cent, and now<br />
the docto~ rs want to nut their fees up to as high as<br />
for a night visit. Now, there must be something wrong somewhere<br />
in your whole concept when these things can go on and you still<br />
ask the unions to hold fas!' I think that was one of your owvn<br />
expressions.<br />
PM1: ' Show moderation". But could I put it in two ways.<br />
First of all, we don't restrict the unions. We plead with the<br />
Arbitration authorities to show modera.-ti-on in the increase and<br />
the rate of increase in wages. But it is not the Arbitration<br />
Commission alone that determines salaries and wages. In fact<br />
they can have conciliation and arrangements outside the<br />
Coramission. Or they can have a wages drift by direct negotiation.<br />
So there isn't a real limit on wage increases in this country,<br />
and the figures show that completely. insofar as prices are<br />
concerned, usually they're the end result. They're the effect<br />
rather than the cause. But of course we're worried about both.<br />
But the critically important issue that you must understand<br />
and everyone must understand, however difficult it mi,. ht be, is<br />
that if you get wages and salary increases in excess of the<br />
increases in production, or what they call Productivity, then<br />
without any doubt at all., you're going to get inflation, as to<br />
the difference be2tween the two figures. And as we have production<br />
rising at the rate of 2 per cent, average earnings at<br />
11 per cent, the~ n you've got an inbuilt inflationary factor.<br />
Now we can take inflation at the rate of 2 per cent but when<br />
it gets to 7 and 8 par cent, it really works against the best<br />
interests of this country. </p>
<p>-6<br />
PM: I am not sure whnether we have power to fix<br />
prices. I doubt whether we have po'wer to fix wages. But Crown<br />
Law officers are looking at this problem for me and they'll<br />
advise me on it later on. But I'm one of -those who doesn't<br />
believe in fixing prices, at least over the long haul. You<br />
can do it momentarily and then give it up. Because if you try<br />
to fix prices, then, without any doubt at all, you create<br />
greater inflationary pressures because you divert resources<br />
into the wrong areas of production, you create bcttienecks, and<br />
we all know what happened in the immediate post-war years.<br />
Twice Governments4 tried, by referendum to get power to control<br />
prices, and twice, rightly, the people decided that they would<br />
reject them. I've asked for a paper Qn this, and I want to<br />
produce a White Paper in the House, to see what can be done.<br />
But that doesn't end the matter be-. ause I believe that what we<br />
have to do, even though there are price rises, is to show the<br />
people that they are justified or are not Jistified. In other<br />
words, a public Vclations exercise is needed in the interests of<br />
convincing the people themselves. This bthe problem we face,<br />
and how we overcome it is still in the lap of the gods.<br />
But at least I am making the most detailed investigations and<br />
enquiries I can make and I want to have this fuilly debated<br />
in the House.<br />
Q. But all the public relations in the world won't<br />
cover up a bad economic mistake, if we could put the BHP<br />
price rise in that category, polittally, from BHP's point of<br />
view you stated your attitude on it you can't overcome<br />
it can you?<br />
PM: No, you've done rightly when you've said there's<br />
a political and an economic problem here. Economically,<br />
I think that the BHP Company could have justified their rise,<br />
though no-t at the time they made their decision and announced<br />
it. But politically, it could not have been worse, and even<br />
if I can put it worse, more foolish. What is needed, as I've<br />
said in cases like this, is some kind of method by which we<br />
can show that i~ t was justified both in a political and in an<br />
economic sensQ. In the case of BN-P, I understand the South<br />
Australian Prices Commissioner is looking into this problem, and<br />
we'll see what decision he makes about it. But I agree with<br />
you. This was a major political decision, it was a major<br />
political mistake, and it did greet harm to me personally and<br />
I believe to my Government, particularly as the decision was<br />
made known immediately after a triumph at the Premier's<br />
Conference.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I wonder if we could turn to<br />
foreign affairs and this is a subject which you've had a<br />
lot of personal experience with, having been Foreign Affairs<br />
Minister prior to the Prime Ministership now, co~ ming on top<br />
of the Kibel affair last week, and the suqcess Mr Nixon has had<br />
from his visit to China last week, when is Aqstralia going to<br />
seriously get down to the recognition of China problem? / 7 </p>
<p>7..<br />
PM: We have been looking at the problem seriously<br />
for a long time. In fact, I think we were early in the field.<br />
And we took action of a kind to liberalise our trade with them,<br />
and we've got no trade restrictions other than on security<br />
grounds. We will l. et our people go there freely, and we let the<br />
Chinese come here as freely as they want to, ajain subject only<br />
to security grounds. We want missions to come and missions to<br />
go from the two countries. There's little more that we have<br />
to offer But I stated in the early clays of being the<br />
Foreign Minister that I wanted a dialogue with the Chinese<br />
in order to normalise our relationship our total relationship,<br />
with them, whether in trade and cultural relationships or<br />
whatever else it might happen to be. Axnd we appeared tobe<br />
going pretty successfully just prior to the tiMe when China,<br />
became a member of the United Nations. So we've done a lotr<br />
but we've not got very much response podtive and effective<br />
response from them. But we're still pursuing it, and in<br />
order to try and get greater access and greater ability to<br />
communicate with them, we are establishing a diplomatic mission<br />
in Hong Kong, staffed by pretty senior men in the Foreign<br />
Office. We think this is a major step forward in trying to<br />
achieve our objectives. If I could go further. While I wa-gs<br />
not prepared to nermit Mr Peacock as Minister for the Army to<br />
make a orivate visit, neither i nor anyone else in the Ca inet<br />
would, if they were invited, object to a Minister making a<br />
Ministerial visit to Peking and to other parts of the state.<br />
Q. Isn't the real key to the whole question you,<br />
the Prime Minister, seeking to go to China? Isn't this the real<br />
key to it?<br />
PM: Well, they have never put it to me that it ould<br />
be the real key to it.<br />
Q. But could you Put the initiative to them?<br />
PM: I don't know, but I could certainly let it be<br />
known to them, as I'm letting it be known to them now. They<br />
appeared to be willing, but they ap~ peared to be willing to<br />
have a track delegation as well, and when they got into the<br />
United Nations they let us know that the time was not propitious.<br />
But if they gave an indication that they would like a<br />
Ministerial visit, of course we would permit a Minister to go.<br />
And I would choose one who could. properly reopresent this<br />
country, nne who would be able, over a very broad spectrum,<br />
be able to discuss bilateral rel. ationships between the twc<br />
countries, and our position in the Asian theatre.<br />
Q. But if they'd like to see you, would you go?<br />
PM: NoW, look, don't let's get too hypothetical about<br />
these things because I think that when you are dealing with the<br />
Chinese in particular, you must deal with them, as I've said,<br />
with quiet and cautious diplomacy. Don't give all your cards<br />
away at once. We gave all our trade advantages away in one<br />
go, and we haven't got a resoonse from them. We don't want<br />
to put all the advantages their way. We must play this game<br />
as anyone plays the game in diplomatic relationships, by<br />
doing it sensibly, wisely, step by step, and knowing that<br />
it's going to be to our advantage when we make a decision. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Q. Bt. . if Premier Chou En Lai contacted you<br />
tomorrow and said. " Weld like you to come on a visit to<br />
China", you'd go?<br />
PM: I'd give it the most careful consideration. The<br />
moment the invitation arrived, of course, I would discuss it<br />
with my colleag4es, and I'd discuss it without any hard and<br />
fast decisions in my mind.<br />
Q. What's your stand on Taiwan at the moment,<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Our stand on Taiwan remains the same as it was<br />
at the United Nations. We would like this country to have<br />
the right to be independent, but we also take the view that<br />
the resolution of the problems between Mainland China and<br />
Taiwan is one for those two parts of China to be decided by<br />
them. In ether words, we have tgo along with a view, and the<br />
view that has been expressed/ CSi~ Fg Kai Shek on Taiwan claims<br />
the Mainland. Peking claims Taiwan. In other words, both<br />
parts on either side of the Taiwan Strait recognise that they<br />
belong to one China, and we cap't deny that, and the Americans<br />
haven't denied it either. But nonetheless we do feel that in<br />
what is called a de facto way, and according to into: national<br />
law, we feel that Taiwan has a right to be regarded, to be<br />
treated, at international law as having jurisdiction over<br />
Taiwan. But we can't be hard and fast on this. We've got to<br />
be flexible in cur approaches to it, and so far as I'm concerned,<br />
I'm determined to : e flexible too.<br />
Q. Do you feel we have a need to take a more independent<br />
line in Asia, and ha-e a more independent foreign policy,<br />
independent from the United States that is?<br />
PM: I believe we've got to take an independent line<br />
based upon our own national interests. If they fit in with the<br />
views or the declared policy of the United States, well and<br />
good. If they don't, then we'll make up our own mind as<br />
to'what we should do.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I'm wondering if I could put to<br />
you you know, the Kibel affair exercised a lot of publicity<br />
during the week throughout Australia. Do you feel that this<br />
whole exercise did the naticn a lot of harm in its approach<br />
to trying to get to know China better?<br />
PM: Not a bit of harm. The Chinese are businessmen<br />
from start to finish, and I don't think they'll take very much<br />
notice of this kind of problem although they would make<br />
political capital out of it if they could. But they're hard<br />
dealers. If they feel that they will have some advantage<br />
because of a rapprochement with us, then of course they'd<br />
have the rapprochement. But they will be dealing with it in<br />
the same way as we want to deal with it carefully, methodically,<br />
and knowing step by step where their best interests lie. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Q. Now, it has been said that the Federal Liberals<br />
are bowing to the wishes at the moment unti-I I think uou<br />
took the firm stand with the DLP last week to the wishes<br />
of two minority parties,* namely, the Country Party and the<br />
DLP. Now this criticism has come strongly from financial areas,<br />
sharebroking areas, particularly on the devaluation of the<br />
dollar Australia, one of the strongest curren, 7i'es in the<br />
world devalued and there's been a lot of criticism in the<br />
financial world on that. And the time that Cabinet took to<br />
come to that decision, and the opportunity lost to revalue the<br />
Australian dollar to parity with sterling. Now I'xp wondering<br />
whether ycu'd like to put this down in clear terms.<br />
PM: I can put it down in very clear terms. When<br />
You have a major decision like this, time doesn't matter.<br />
TAhned acgraiitniscta lltyh e imdpoolrltaarn tfwteL ~ dhgi dnis' t tod emvaakleu e. t he Wer igahptp redceicaitseiodn . o'r<br />
revalued upwards by, I think, 6.32 per cent, So, against one<br />
of the major currencies in the world, we went upwards and not<br />
downwards. And the second important thing is that....<br />
Q. But you were already up, in layman's language.<br />
Excuse me for interrupting, but in layman's language you<br />
were already up above that dollar anyhow,<br />
PM: No, no, we were not at the time. At the time the<br />
decisions were made there was a little movement yes, but not of<br />
the order of 6.32 per cent. So what we have done officially,<br />
is we have anpreciated against the dollar although we h-ave<br />
depreciated against certain other currencies.<br />
Q. But overseas countries are casting eyes on us<br />
because of the cheapness of the dollar. Takeovers bec,-Do.<br />
more<br />
PM: Now that may be so, and if that is so, then it's<br />
up to us to find other measures to control the inflow of capital.<br />
But if you felt as I dij, after hearing all the arguments,<br />
and I made this decision personally that 6.32 per cent was the<br />
right place to go, and I did~ n't change my mind, and it was my<br />
decision at the finish, my decision. it was accepted by<br />
the rest of Cabinet....<br />
Q. Not Mr anthony's?<br />
PM: No, well, Mr Anthony agreed with it, yes. He did<br />
agree with it. Everyone in Cabinet agreed with it. But I was<br />
the person who decided on the 6.32 per cent.<br />
Q. In terms of collective responsibility?<br />
PM:. In terms of collective responsibility, yes.<br />
Q. Individually they may have differed? </p>
<p>10<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't say differences at the<br />
finish, but in a Cabinet as. rigorous and healthy and with<br />
different kindsof interests to represent, of course there<br />
were differences of views expressed. But when it came to the<br />
actual decision itself, after listening to all the arguments<br />
by Country Party colleagues, and from others around the table,<br />
and then at the finish when I said it's 6.32 per cent, it was<br />
accepted. And I can give you the reasons why.<br />
Q. Have the takeovers since then worried you,<br />
including this latest one by Great Universal Stores of UK for<br />
Pattersons, where you've got 80 stores throughout Australia.<br />
It's a sizable one. And the Jaoanese investment houses<br />
interest in Australia.<br />
PM: Well, that is an interest, the last one is an<br />
interest with'out any precise decision or definite decision as<br />
to a takeover. The other, frankly, I have not had enough time<br />
in the first two weeks of the House to interest myself in it.<br />
But what I have done is this. I've told the Reserve Bank that<br />
I want a complete analysis, in depth, of the problem of capital<br />
inflow. I believe this is the right way to look at it, and I'm<br />
getting a paper on it, and I hope to be able to introduce a<br />
paper in the House, or if I don't the Treasurer will do it,<br />
over the course of the next three to four weeks.<br />
Q. But you may have to take strong action to stop<br />
some of this capital inflow.<br />
PM: It wouldn't be strong action. I believe some<br />
other countries do it. Japan, for example, is doing it now.<br />
mnd I can see no reason why we shouldn't do it. But I'm<br />
not committing myself. I've said, and I've made it clear in<br />
the House, I want an analysis of the pros and cons. And when<br />
we have that, then we can make up cur mind what to do. But<br />
what I do want to impress on you is this. We will act in our<br />
interests as I've said before. The money that is coming in<br />
now is fundamentally investment funds going into the development<br />
of this country. In other words, it's building up our resources,<br />
building up our capacity for increased development, building<br />
up our capacity for increased employment. We've got to be<br />
careful here, but above all, we've got to make certain that<br />
we act in Australia's interests, and we don't let others get<br />
too big a hold on Australian assets.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, still on the point of the two<br />
minor parties in the Parliament, will Australia now press on<br />
with its " get tough" industrial policy in view of the DLP's<br />
decision to knock back this legislation in the Senate?<br />
PM: I'd like to explain my position about the DLP<br />
because I think that many or most of their major objectives<br />
such as their deep dislike of Communism it's the same as<br />
my own, particularly when it reacts against the interest of<br />
this country. Secondly, they want a stronger defence effort,<br />
and so do we, and others of their policies are the same as<br />
ours. But it is ours, and particularly my responsibility<br />
to ensure that when a decision is made, we in the Liberal/<br />
Country Party make it. As to the recent decisions relating to<br />
amalgamation, I long felt and the DLP knows that I long felt,<br />
that we would not stop this amalgamation. We had good reasons / 11 </p>
<p>PM ( Contrl.)<br />
for not doing so. We had no justification for doing it.<br />
But that doesn't mean to say that we give up taking action<br />
where we think there are improper practices, or where the<br />
will of the majority of the members in a trade union is being<br />
thwarted, that we won't take action. In fact, if we find the<br />
facts show that there has been malpractice, then of course we<br />
will tzkc action, and I will be introducing, or the Government<br />
will be introducirig, measures soon. And that will clearly<br />
indicate where we stand.<br />
Q. Even though the DLP may not let them get through<br />
the Senate? You are prepared to face that?<br />
PM: Well, it doesn't necessarily mean that there are<br />
some measures that the DLP doesn't like. As for example, it<br />
might be compuiscrv unionism. we can think about those, of<br />
course, but -the measures that we regard as fundan~ ental we will<br />
push on with.<br />
Q. isuIt sounds as though you're backing down on that<br />
PM: No. Well, you can put it that way if you want<br />
to. But you've got to live in a world of commonsense. And<br />
the issues that really matter, and I bE'Lieve we will make<br />
our position on them more than abundantly clear in the next<br />
few weeks, we'll push ahead with them.<br />
Q. Did it worry you when the Federal President of<br />
the Liberal Pa'rty, Mr Southey, said recently that the Liberal<br />
Party. he virtually said that the Liberal Party couldn't be<br />
sure of going into the next election and winning it. They<br />
would'nt know as they went into the election what the result<br />
would be.<br />
PM: I thought his last statement was a good one.<br />
P. nd as you've put it, I couldn't object to it. As you know,<br />
we in the Liberal Party are liberal in the true sense in that<br />
we don't try and compel people to stick to a rigid party line.<br />
Q. I didn't really ask you whether you objected to<br />
it, Sir, but whether it worried you.<br />
PM: No, it didn't worry me because I know him well<br />
enough and I've been there long enough to be able to listen to<br />
something that's said. And even though I might think, " Oh,<br />
I wish he'd put it a Little bit differently" or I wish he<br />
hadn't said -it, in a few moments' time you've forgotten it,<br />
and you might even ring and say, " Well, now look, Bob, I'd<br />
never put it this way again. Bless your heart and soul, see if<br />
you can put it a little more felicitously in the future".<br />
Q. You talked earlier about thn need for public<br />
relations. W-hat have you got planned to improve your image both<br />
with the Party and with the electorate between now and the<br />
elections, whenever that may be? / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
PM: Well, I think my image with the Party is pretty<br />
good. Not only within my own Party, the political Party, butbetween<br />
the political and the administrative wings. And we are<br />
doing all we can. But as to the publio image public image<br />
will depend upon performance and results. We' tarted off in<br />
last November as you know, because you asked ' e the question<br />
about it but we started off last November in ' asing up on<br />
bank control. We've given them more or less complete liberty.<br />
For example, they can lend money for housing in a way that has<br />
never before been practicable. At the Premiers' Conference,<br />
we took the measures that I've mentioned a few moments ago.<br />
And if we found that they were not enough, particularly so far<br />
as employment was concerned, which I've told you is an article<br />
of faith with me, of course I would make a decision personally<br />
that we have to do more.<br />
Q. Can you just be a little more specilic and say<br />
what figure or what percentage you want to get unemployment<br />
down to?<br />
PMi No, I won't.. I won't be specific there. But I'd<br />
want to get it don to a figure that I regard as acceptable to<br />
the Australian people and particularly acceptable to me.<br />
Q: Which would be below 100,000?<br />
PM: Well, don't pin me to a ficure. I think my mind<br />
and their mind would be identical on this problem. I'd want<br />
it down to a figure where people wouldn't be worrying and I<br />
wouldn't be worrying either.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, time is running out on us and<br />
there are two very important subjects which I would like just<br />
to discuss with you as quickly as possible. There's tremendous<br />
criticism within the Parliament on both sides of the House on<br />
who controls Australia's off-shore and continental shelf<br />
what distance Australia can rightly control and where the States<br />
can fit into this picture. NOw Mr Gorton has threatened to vote<br />
on the other side Of the House this Session if you don't do<br />
something about offshore legislation. There" is the question<br />
of oil, there is the question of fishing rights. Now how<br />
seriously do you view something being done abut this particular<br />
area?<br />
PM: Well, in the course of the last two weeks, I have<br />
been discussing with the Leader of the House, and particularly<br />
with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the combined effects of<br />
all these problems that you've mentioned. Soon there is to be<br />
an international conference on the law of the sea and associated<br />
problems, and he will be stating his position before he leaves<br />
Australia to discuss them at the international conferences.<br />
I believe, too, although I'm not perfectly certain about this<br />
because it's a little outside my jurisdiction, and I haven't had<br />
the time to cross-examine him ccmpletely on this, that he will<br />
be discussing it with the States and will then be taking it into<br />
my own Party Room. I'm just sorry that I Cant give you the<br />
answer to this, but I'm not u, to date on it. If I'd had the<br />
glimmer of a feeling that you might raise this, I would have<br />
discussed it with him this morning, but I didn't do so. ./ 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Q. Are-you consc ious, though, that there is need for<br />
something-to be done, and are you conscious of Mr Gorton's<br />
threat? This-is the point.<br />
PM: Yes, conscious of both and I know the Foreign<br />
Minister and the Leader of the House are both conscious of it,<br />
too, and they believe that i~ t can be overcome.<br />
Q. So that all things being equal, we're likely to<br />
see legislation in this Session?<br />
PM: I don't know about legislation, but I believe the<br />
way in which we are operating, or the way in which they are<br />
operating, which they will recommend to Cabinet, will to a<br />
considerable extent overcome our problems. But you've got<br />
me here, and I have to say this, in an area where I'm not<br />
fully briefed, but I hope to become briefed as soon as a<br />
submission is presented to us.<br />
Q. The other p~ oint I'd like to put to you is the<br />
Constitution. The States met last week to discuss at Attorneys-<br />
General level, a new Constitution. The present one was<br />
described as a horse and buggy Constitution, I think, by the<br />
State Attorney-General, Mr Reid, in Victoria. Now does the<br />
Commonwealth see a need for a change in the present set-up-r<br />
PM: I certainly do. The only trouble I've got is as<br />
to the changes that m'ight be made, and the kind of Commission<br />
we need or Parliamentary group we need in order to come to a<br />
common view about what changes are necessary. But more and<br />
more as I've been in the off ice of the Prime Minister, I've<br />
wrung my hands feeling, " Heaven if ever there's an occasion<br />
when we ought to get a change in the Constitution, this is it."<br />
For examinle, in industrial relations, a control of associations<br />
and organisations, control of interest rates and overall control<br />
of the economy. I believe that we ought to have increased<br />
powers, and I think we ought to be able to t~ Jk to the States<br />
about it. But equally, too, do I believe that there ought to<br />
be greater power for the States to administer, to have the<br />
funds through which they could administer matters that could<br />
be more satisfactorily handlad by them than by us. For<br />
example, hospitals, schooling, roads and matters of that kind,<br />
matters that are very close to the people, because I think they<br />
are closer to the people than we are.<br />
Q. You're almr-st saying taxing powers of some<br />
description?<br />
PM: my own view is that we really want some sort of<br />
a commission on this before we make up our minds. I think you<br />
should know, too, that because there hasn't been quite enough<br />
detailed analysis of the problems of State and Commonwealth<br />
relationships, I have agreed' to the provision of fundIs so that<br />
a school can be established at the National University in order<br />
to give us guidance on this problem. It will give us guidance<br />
from an objective source rather than keep it in the political<br />
area, the political arena, and one that will be a no1kical<br />
football. </p>
<p>14<br />
Q. Mr Prime M~ inister, wh-. at hope do you see for the<br />
recovery of the motor car ind1ustry?<br />
PM: I couldn't g~ ive an immediate forecast, but if<br />
people would have a little more confidence, then I think you<br />
would find the motor car industry would quickly revive. Above<br />
all, I do hope that because of the recent measures we took<br />
to ensure that the -manufacture of small vehicles took place in<br />
Australia we want a large Australian content in small<br />
vehicles then I think you'll find that the production cf<br />
motor vehicles in Australia would increase pretty quickly, and<br />
we'll have. a very Australian content, and we'll have much<br />
increased employmnent by Australians that's the goal I want.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, for " This Week". thank v,-u<br />
very much. I </p>
