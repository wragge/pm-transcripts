    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I had the privilege of meeting Mr Antonio Maria Costa, Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. </p>
<p>Australia is a strong supporter of the work of the Office on Drugs and Crime and, as a member state of the United Nations, is actively engaged in working on measures to combat illicit drug use and organised crime in Australia and the Asia-Pacific.  </p>
<p>During Mr Costa's visit, there will be considerable discussion with government ministers and departments, law enforcement agencies and non-government organisations on mutual areas of interest including:  tackling the problem of amphetamine-type stimulants, drug treatment and prevention programs, and our law enforcement and monitoring efforts in Australia and our region. </p>
<p>The Australian Government has a strong track record in tackling these problems but the fight against drugs and crime is a global one that requires an ongoing and concerted effort by all governments and communities around the world.  </p>
<p>I would like to wish Mr Costa a successful and enjoyable visit.  </p>
