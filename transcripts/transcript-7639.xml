TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, FOREIGN<br />
CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION LUNCHEON, SYDNEY CONVENTION<br />
CENTRE, 14 JUNE 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well obviously the things I'll be saying now are<br />
different to what they would have been at the beginning of<br />
this month because earlier of overseas in ' 84 when I<br />
visited Hong Kong I was there putting a message that I<br />
believed that the developments in China at the time should<br />
be welcomed by Hong Kong and that there was a shared<br />
interest. There would be, I believe, a shared interest<br />
between the Government of China and the people of Hong Kong<br />
as to the purpose of Hong Kong in the post transition<br />
period. I believe that the apprehensions that were<br />
entrenched at that time were not well founded. one<br />
obviously has to say now, after the tragic recent events,<br />
that the people of Hong Kong are entitled to be<br />
significantly apprehensive. Let me say this, that I believe<br />
that in the short term there is not a great deal of room for<br />
optimism about what is happening there. But I do express<br />
the view that in the longer term the repression that is<br />
being practised, the brutality which has been evident and<br />
the attempts to set the Chinese population against the<br />
Chinese population, against itself all these horrendous<br />
things, I believe, will not be able in the longer term to<br />
survive. I don't think that the aspirations of the Chinese<br />
people for a freer society will be able in the longer term<br />
to be repressed. So, putting that perspective together<br />
briefly, I think in response to your particular question,<br />
Red, that I would say that the United Kingdom Government has<br />
to understand that there will be an immediate apprehension<br />
and concern with which they have to deal. I think they have<br />
and I recognise they have certain obligations in this area.<br />
As far as Australia is concerned, we will also adopt an<br />
accommodating policy as we possibly can. In respect of<br />
those people within Australia who are apprehensive about<br />
their future, in case of return to China, we'll be as<br />
accommodating as we possibly can there. In respect of<br />
people from Hong Kong who wish to come here of course we've<br />
had, as you know, a developed Business migration Program.<br />
We welcome these sorts of people within the global limit<br />
that we set for our immigration policy. So that's roughly<br />
the sorts of things that I'll be saying. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: It would be silly, Ian, at this stage to suggest that<br />
one would be confident about mobilising unanimity of view on<br />
this because the evidence at the moment is that that would<br />
be an almost impossible task. But, having said that, there<br />
are already some runs on the board. We have just received<br />
yesterday the message as I think it's been made public from<br />
India that India has come aboard in support of the<br />
Australian position. There are indications of other<br />
significant countries being interested. Against that there<br />
is also the evidence that others say that what we are<br />
proposing is not realistic. So there is a hard job ahead of<br />
us. What we intend to do on this visit, and Gareth Evans is<br />
away now, is to explain the Australian position. You see,<br />
what had been put to us was that it would be possible to<br />
actually sign the convention but have a reservation, express<br />
a reservation that in fact we would be opposed to any<br />
mining. It was put to us as a matter of international legal<br />
interpretation that in fact that ratification would not be<br />
acceptable with that sort of reservation. So that being our<br />
position, that we are against mining in the Antarctic, we<br />
were not able to pursue that task. So what we are about<br />
therefore is to argue that there needs to be a comprehensive<br />
environmental protection convention within such a<br />
framework the establishment of a wilderness park in the<br />
Antarctic. Now there are many people who are opposed to<br />
that, who seem to think that you can have some sort of<br />
halfway house where you can express a concern and an<br />
intention to protect the environment there, but somehow play<br />
around with the concept of mining. We believe that the<br />
evidence about the fragility of the Antarctic is such that<br />
that halfway house is not possible. Some have said that if<br />
we by our action prevent the convention coming into force,<br />
that will mean that the moratorium on mining which has<br />
operated to this point will break down and there'll be no<br />
sort of protective apparatus there at all. We don't accept<br />
that proposition so we will be at all levels arguing the<br />
case for this approach and I can't say no that I'm hopeful<br />
that we will get a unanimous position. But I can say that<br />
from the evidence just in the last few days that we have a<br />
very signficant country that's come aboard and I believe<br />
that that will help Australia in pursuing the task that we<br />
will now pursue vigorously.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM4: This is an international question. You're talking I<br />
presume about an election in Australia. I mean, there are<br />
elections all over the world this year but in the most<br />
important country I wouldn't think there'd be one this year.<br />
I've said Let me make this point about the election.<br />
Please recall the recent events. There was one person, only<br />
one person who started talking about an election, an early<br />
election in Australia. That was a bloke called Howard who<br />
did it, as I pointed out, for two reasons. One, that he </p>
<p>-3-<br />
wanted quite maliciously and on an unfounded basis of fact<br />
to suggest that this was something that the tax cuts<br />
that we were giving were something that were being brought<br />
out of the hat for the purpose of an early election and<br />
ignoring the fact that we'd promised those tax cuts<br />
promised that 12 months before. So it was an attempt to<br />
divert attention from the intrinsic merits and long standing<br />
nature of the promise to deliver them. And secondly he did<br />
it to try and divert attention from what was a gathering<br />
momentum of the dissatisfaction of his leadership. It<br />
didn't work. There was no prospect of an early election as<br />
far as I was concerned. It was something that was conjured<br />
up in the mind of Mr Howard. Well, he got what he deserved<br />
and the proposition will have no more substance than his<br />
leadership. As to the second and fundamentally important<br />
question that you raised. I express to my people that the<br />
odds being offered by Ladbroke's before the event seemed to<br />
me to be absurd. If I'd been actually over there at the<br />
time I would have indulged in my well-known punting<br />
endeavours and had a good at the odds that were being<br />
offered. I think the outcome was appropriate and it gives<br />
substance to the first part of the visit because a week ago<br />
I sent a cable to Allan Border and said " good luck, you'll<br />
win the first and I'll come to see you one up at Lords". So<br />
the prediction has worked out. I expect that they will go<br />
two up after Lords and whether it will be a whitewash or not<br />
I'm not sure. Whether we can win the five is not really a<br />
reflection of the capacity of the Australian cricketers<br />
relative to the English but whether the remarkable run of<br />
recently good weather now will prevail and whether we get<br />
five Tests. But whatever number of Tests there are, we will<br />
win the majority.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I'm not in a position to comment on the report. I<br />
don't intend to comment on it. It's a matter obviously of<br />
sensitivies involved. I don't intend to comment on the<br />
report. As to the second part of your question as to what<br />
impact it will have on Sino-Australian relations, let me<br />
make these points. Firstly, there is probably no country<br />
which has had closer, more detailed relations with China<br />
been developed over the last few years than with Australia<br />
and therefore it was for us, I think, the sadder, the more<br />
tragic, the events that occurred there in recent weeks. Now<br />
that has not precluded us, and myself in particular, from<br />
making very clear, in the most precise terms, our rejection<br />
and repudiation of what has happened. So I think that the<br />
authorities in China are totally aware of our views and our<br />
attitude. I wrote to Premier Li Peng earlier this week and<br />
really I had these purposes in mind in writing that letter.<br />
Firstly, of course, was directly to register the revulsion<br />
that I and the Government and the people of Australia<br />
experienced in recent events. Secondly, to say that it was<br />
our belief that a continuation of that approach would be<br />
deleterious not only for the nation and people of China, but </p>
<p>-4-<br />
for its relations with the region and the rest of the world.<br />
And thirdly, to express the hope that there would be a<br />
change, there would be a reversion to the policies of<br />
openness and of the development of the rights of individuals<br />
an abandonment of the infringement, the drastic infringement<br />
of human rights that characterised recent times and that in<br />
those circumstances Australia stood ready to do what it<br />
could to help. Now I go to those details and I also, of<br />
course, expressed the hope in the letter that there would be<br />
extended to everyone, including those in position of<br />
leadership which had expressed opposing views to those that<br />
had been followed, that there would be extended to those<br />
people leniency and humanitarian<br />
( tape break)<br />
PM: continuing saga over there, this question of<br />
participation or not in the frigate program. The<br />
perception, I think, of this country would be an indirect<br />
one on the economic relationship. The first would be that<br />
if, against the indications we've previously had of the<br />
relevance of the frigate program to New Zealand and that<br />
there would be co-operation, and if that were to not now<br />
eventuate, then clearly there would be a perception I think<br />
that New Zealand wasn't terribly serious about fully<br />
effective co-operation in the defence field. The conclusion<br />
which would be hard to avoid and which I know from my<br />
conversation with Mr Lange, he would regard as being an<br />
appropriate conclusion. Now, if that were to happen, and I<br />
hope all this is hypothetical and it doesn't happen. I hope<br />
that they will participate in the program. But if it were<br />
to happen then in a not measurable way, I can't measure to<br />
what extent, but it must have some adverse affect in the<br />
area of economic co-operation. I can't measure that, no-one<br />
can. But if two countries which have previously had the<br />
closest sorts of co-operation in the defence field, then<br />
went to a situation where the break which was associated<br />
with the ANZUS Treaty position adopted by New Zealand, was<br />
then exacerbated by a refusal to participate in this<br />
program, then the relationship would be diminished. There<br />
is no question about that. It would be diminished. We<br />
would not, as an Australian Government, seek to say, well<br />
now, to the Australian economic community, New Zealand must<br />
be punished for this. We don't operate like that. That<br />
would be silly. But I think it just would reflect a<br />
lowering of the warmth and the total character of the<br />
relationship and it seems to me in those circumstances that<br />
must inevitably have some adverse economic effect.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well the fact that I didn't mention specifically New<br />
Caledonia is not in any sense to mean that I won't be<br />
talking about this issue when I'm in Paris. I obviously<br />
will. I wasn't able to list every single issue that I was<br />
going to be talking about. But I will be talking about it </p>
<p>because it is an important issue for Australia and we are on<br />
the record and I will take the opportunity directly again in<br />
talking to President Mitterand and Prime Minister Rocard to<br />
say to them what we have said publicly. And that is that we<br />
welcome a change of direction which is involved in the<br />
Matignon Accord and that most particularly, may I say, in<br />
direct relevance to your question, I have welcomed the<br />
recognition by the French authorities of the underlying, one<br />
of the fundamental underlying problems. That is that it was<br />
an indictment of previous French Administrations over many<br />
years of different persuasions that we come to the recent<br />
position in New Caledonia with an indigenous population<br />
virtually untrained in areas of public administration,<br />
professional and technical areas, and education and so on.<br />
And the Rocard Government has recognised that fundamental<br />
truth and they have undertaken now an accelerated program of<br />
training of the indigenous population so that by the time<br />
1998 comes you will have many many more people trained for<br />
all these relevant areas, with a capacity to overtake the<br />
sorts of responsibilities that can be associated with<br />
whatever the decision is that is taken at that time. It is<br />
in that area that I have already indicated to the French<br />
authoritie * s that Australia is prepared, not only prepared<br />
but very willing, to co-operate with them in training<br />
programs. We're not seeking to intrude ourselves but<br />
because of our proximity it may be the case, as we've said<br />
to them, that they would like to see some of those training<br />
programs to which they are committed, undertaken in this<br />
country. So, it is obviously consistent with those<br />
positions that I have adopted on behalf of the Government<br />
and people of Australia, that we would see investment by<br />
Australian firms in New Caledonia as an appropriate course<br />
of action. we believe that the French Government deserves<br />
the full support not only of Australia, but of the South<br />
Pacific community in pursuing not merely the Accords which<br />
have been signed but,. as I say, importantly the underlying<br />
considerations behind them. Because what is necessary is<br />
that you have a Kanak population which does have the<br />
training in all relevant areas so that they will be able to<br />
undertake whatever degree of responsibility it is the<br />
decision that they take at that time. So, yes, we are<br />
supportive in this.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Is that a convoluted way of saying do I regard myself<br />
as having a special relationship with Margaret?<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: It's not Margaret that's here, it's me. So you really<br />
should cable your question to Margaret asking her whether<br />
she thinks she has a special relationship with me. But as<br />
being one of the two involved I'll attempt to analyse it and<br />
come to a conclusion. I think she would regard herself as<br />
having a special relationship with me in the sense that I </p>
<p>haven't been backward, nor has she, in meetings of the<br />
Commonwealth in putting our views with strength, conviction,<br />
clarity and, may I say, continuity. So I believe that<br />
Margaret respects that sort of position I think she<br />
finds herself in conflict on a particular issue. I<br />
certainly found that while we are apart on method I don't<br />
question in any sense the commitment that she has to trying<br />
to bring an end to the abhorrence of apartheid in South<br />
Africa. So we are able to operate from that common basis of<br />
a shared abhorrence about the principles and practices of<br />
apartheid and within that framework we have been able to<br />
have fairly detailed, lengthy and relevant discussions. we<br />
also share positions on matters of importance. For<br />
instance, I think Margaret and I were amongst the earliest<br />
who firmly and without equivocation recognised the substance<br />
and significance of what Mikhail Gorbachev was attempting in<br />
the Soviet Union. We have a shared view that it is in the<br />
interests of the people of the Soviet Union, and<br />
particularly as well in the interests of the world<br />
community, that what Gorbachev is trying to do within the<br />
Soviet Union deserves, warrants the positive support and<br />
involvement of the West. We are at one on that and have<br />
been from an early point of time. I also say that as far as<br />
Margaret Thatcher's visit to this country last year was<br />
concerned she regarded it as very important. It was not a<br />
mere formality and she was kind enough after her visit to<br />
express in very fullsome terms her a ppreciation of the<br />
visit, how it was arranged, and then she put it amongst the<br />
most important visits she had undertaken. Following that I<br />
would have to say that her arrangements for the visit that<br />
I'm making to the United Kingdom have been almost<br />
unbelievable in the intensity with which they have been<br />
prepared and the detail and the commitment that she has made<br />
to ensuring that the visit is both comprehensive, relevant<br />
and successful<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The position in regard to those two areas is reasonably<br />
straightforward. Take the area of forests. We have a<br />
position and I'll come to uranium secondly in regard to<br />
forests we have the position that this is an area in which<br />
there is a sharing of responsibility between States and the<br />
Federal Government. That was witnessed over the six years<br />
that we've been in office, some rather significant conflicts<br />
between the Federal Government and the States and<br />
particularly in regard to Tasmania. our position as the<br />
Federal Government is that we recognise the importance of<br />
the forestry industry. AS indeed may I say in fairness to<br />
the conservationists, the environmentalists, they are not<br />
anti-forestry. They're not saying there should be no<br />
forestry industry in this country. The secret of success in<br />
my judgement in handling this issue is first of all to<br />
recognise that there are certain areas of forests in this<br />
country which should be protected at all costs, vide the<br />
Daintree region in north Queensland and certain elements of </p>
<p>-7-<br />
the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests in Tasmania. They<br />
should be categorised as World Heritage areas and completely<br />
protected. In regard to the other areas what we've got to<br />
try and reach is a position where there is an understanding<br />
and agreement of the need to protect those parts of the<br />
National Estate which in addition to the World Heritage<br />
areas contain areas which should not be subject to any<br />
logging at all and to identify other areas where logging can<br />
be undertaken but in a way which we ensure a renewal of the<br />
resources which are being used for those purposes. Now, by<br />
definition, set out those requirements and they are<br />
logical and I think should be pretty broadly accepted. Of<br />
course the problem becomes in defining those areas and<br />
getting agreement to them and to those processes. What<br />
we're trying to do in this country, both through direct<br />
negotiations with the States, the industry, the unions and<br />
9 the environmental movement and now with the establishment of<br />
the Resources Assessment Commission to have a range of<br />
processes whereby we can get agreement on these general<br />
principles. There will continue obviously to be<br />
differences. As you can see for instance it's happening in<br />
the southern forests in NSW at the moment. But that's the<br />
sort of procedure we need to get. The total protection of<br />
certain areas which should have no possibility of access by<br />
the forestry industry, particularly those that should be put<br />
on the World Heritage list, certain areas in the National<br />
Estate which should be protected. But that doesn't mean<br />
that all areas of the National Estate are not subject to<br />
forestry operations and to get the processes underway to get<br />
agreement on those issues. So that's the approach we are<br />
adopting and I am hopeful that we will get further and<br />
further towards agreement on these issues. In regard to<br />
uranium the position there is relatively straightforward I<br />
believe. We are a partner to the non-profileration treaty<br />
and under the non-profileration treaty there is an<br />
obligation treaty for us to provide uranium to those<br />
* nations party to that treaty who undertake to use that<br />
uranium for peaceful purposes. That is a treaty obligation<br />
which we discharge. There is no country which has more<br />
stringent safeguard requirements than we do. That simply<br />
means that, as has been put to us by the International<br />
Atomic Energy Agency, that it would be a tragedy if<br />
Australia were not to provide the uranium. It would mean<br />
that it would be supplied by others who have a less<br />
stringent safeguards approach. So that's what we're doing<br />
and we regard that as appropriate and importantly the only<br />
course which is consistent with our membership and may I say<br />
our vigorous membership of the non-proliferation treaty.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I must say I haven't engaged in an intellectual on<br />
this issue to say whether I regard the French presence<br />
as better and if so to what degree better than Indonesia or<br />
anyone else. I haven't engaged in that intellectual<br />
exercise. I must say regard it as a fascinating one </p>
<p>-8-<br />
which I might undertake sometime on the way home rather than<br />
on the way over there. I simply want to say on that I'll be<br />
talking with Prime Minister Rocard about developments in the<br />
Pacific region and no doubt that will iclude developments in<br />
Fiji. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I really am not going to say to you in advance of<br />
talking to Mr Bush what I'll be saying to him. I don't<br />
think that would either be polite or very productive. In<br />
regard to the second question I think that one has to say<br />
and it would be churlish if you didn't say it that Japan<br />
has improved its position and attitude both in terms of<br />
itself providing access for a range of products compared to<br />
what had been the previous position. And also in terms of<br />
the cooperation that we are receiving from Japan in a number<br />
of the issues that we are raising in the multilateral<br />
trading agenda. Certainly as far as Australian industry is<br />
concerned there has been an opening up, there has been an<br />
improvement and as I say it would be churlish not to<br />
recognise that. We have been having discussions with the<br />
Japanese about these issues generally and most particularly<br />
in the context of the initiatives that I have developed<br />
towards trying to establish a greater degree of cooperation<br />
in the Asia-Pacific region on economic matters including the<br />
role and stance that countries will adopt in the<br />
multilateral trading environment. Certainly we've received<br />
a fairly encouraging response from Japan. So in regard to<br />
the first part of your question, I don't want to say to you<br />
what I'll be saying to the President, but in general we<br />
welcome the sorts of changes in direction,. Perhaps they're<br />
not as rapid as many would like. But I repeat, it would be<br />
churlish not to recognise that there has been an improvement<br />
and I think a reasonably significant improvement in the<br />
Japanese attitude on these issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Let me just quickly reaffirm the basis of your question<br />
The evidence in Vietnam is overwhelming. The tragedy<br />
there is, as I put it before, in a sea, in an ocean, of<br />
growth, they have been an island of economic stagnation. To<br />
their credit they are increasingly recognising that fact and<br />
therefore I believe, the rest of the world to encourage<br />
change and development there, to give the people of Vietnam<br />
the opportunities of experiencing the benefit of economic<br />
growth. Because that will be both to their benefit, the<br />
people of Vietnam, and will obviously in my judgement add to<br />
the stability of the region. I don't think there's any way<br />
in which you can dissociate the political developments now<br />
which see the creation of a basis of optimism for the<br />
settlement of the Kampuchean tragedy. You ' can't in any<br />
sense dissociate that from the facts to which I've been<br />
referring. In other words there has been a decision made<br />
within Vietnam, I would think within the Soviet Union and to </p>
<p>-9-<br />
an extent in China that the decision in the Soviet Union's<br />
an important one but decision made in the Soviet Union<br />
and Vietnam that they can't any longer continue the sort of<br />
economic processes that they have in that country and that<br />
the settlement in IndoChina, the political settlement in<br />
IndoChina is associated with that acceptance and that<br />
realisation. So if we are concerned with a region both of<br />
political stability and economic growth which is widely<br />
shared then there is an inevitable conclusion that follows<br />
from it in my judgement. That is that we should do all that<br />
we can to assist the processes of change within Vietnam and<br />
of growth. I think the one question mark that one has to<br />
have now when talking about this region is what impact all<br />
the changes in China have. While obviously the Soviets and<br />
China have not finalised a position as to all the details of<br />
a settlement in Kampuchea, nevertheless there was a broad<br />
basis of understanding upon which Prince Hun Sen and<br />
Sihanouk have conducted their very productive talks in<br />
Jakarta and which are to be resumed next month in Paris. I<br />
don't know whether the events in China are going to create<br />
any unforeseen difficulties there. Because as you know, one<br />
of the critical points that still remains, what was going to<br />
be the post-withdrawal end of September, withdrawal of<br />
the Vietnamese troops, what were going to be the processes<br />
involving an acceptable role or non-role for the Khmer<br />
Rouge? Now it seemed to be the case that in the discussions<br />
that had taken place that China had accepted some sort of<br />
process which would be acceptable, not only to them but to<br />
the rest of the parties involved and therefore wanting to<br />
have optimism that it was going to work out. I simply say<br />
you have to raise the question mark as to whether now as a<br />
result of recent events in China there is going to be any<br />
change in that position. I fervently hope not.<br />
ends </p>
