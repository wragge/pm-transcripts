    <content><![CDATA[<p> I will visit Malaysia from 29 November to 1 December for discussions with Prime Minister Dato' Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.</p>
<p>  Australia and Malaysia have enjoyed a long history of contact, with our defence, education and people-to-people links a mainstay of the bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>  We are currently negotiating a bilateral Free Trade Agreement and work closely together in the Cairns Group on agricultural trade reform. During my visit I will reaffirm the Australian Government's commitment to an FTA with Malaysia and underline the mutual benefits of an agreement between our countries.</p>
<p>Australia is Malaysia's largest foreign education provider and our defence ties are among the closest in the immediate region.  Malaysia was our eleventh-largest trading partner in 2005-06, with bilateral trade worth $9.3 billion.</p>
<p>  During the visit, Prime Minister Abdullah and I will discuss ways for us to build on these strong links and further our shared interests in promoting regional peace and security.</p>
<p>  In addition to my discussions with Prime Minister Abdullah, I will also address a lunch hosted by the Malaysia-Australia Business Council and will present Endeavour Award scholarships to a number of Malaysian scholars.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abdullah visited Australia in April last year and my return visit will continue to foster and promote the close relationship between our two nations.  </p>
