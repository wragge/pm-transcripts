OPENING OF BLIGH HOUSE. SYDNEY<br />
I 5TH FEBRUARY, 9~<br />
Ãµ Pec th t. Hn. Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. LeCouteur and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I think it is rather good fun for a poJJitic,-Lar<br />
in these days to be invited to open Biligh House. ( Laugbter)<br />
He had, as we are given to believe, some acquaintance with<br />
mutiny and I wil. 1 pass on to the appropriate quarters in<br />
Canberra the fact that I have now been associated with his<br />
name. ( Laughter) One other thing struck me as I came in and that<br />
was, apart from seeing all the " idle" business community in<br />
Sydney as I always do on these occasions the quality and<br />
depth of the carpets. Do you mind me referring to this?<br />
( Laughter) Nothing gives you such a good feeling as to<br />
walk along on a carpet into which you sink in the most genteel<br />
fashion. I made an enquiry from Mr. Prideaux who was a<br />
little uncertain in his reply as to whether the wool in the<br />
carpets came from Australia, This apparently remains to be<br />
seen, but if you don't mind putting up with me for half a<br />
minute on this recollection of<br />
I remember thirty years ago, almost, being in<br />
charge of a little group of Parliamentarians from Australia<br />
who went up to the Midlands in England, and we went to a<br />
rather famous carpet area, Kidderminster. At lunchtime I<br />
had a short but heated argument with the Mayor about bodyline<br />
bowling ( Laughter) and we also went in to this vast<br />
display room and we saw carpets. ' Ve began with beautiful<br />
carpets. W4e gradually descended in the social scale until<br />
we got to the far end of the room where there were the most<br />
revolting carpets that I have ever seen in my life, all orange<br />
and brown splodges and curlicues. I said to the general<br />
manager who was showing us around, " Tell me, how is it that<br />
you can bring yourselves to make carpets like these, having<br />
regard to some that I have seen?" And he said, " That's<br />
all right, Sir" ( he didn't know where we were from) " They<br />
are for th Australian market Sir." ( Laughter) And do you<br />
know that the very next time f went to some provincial town<br />
in Victoria for some necessary purpose, I saw the very carpet<br />
on the floor, ( Laughter) Now, I am not comparing it with<br />
this one. This is one of the many proofs available to us<br />
that we are getting on in the world,<br />
Now this company of course, is a very old<br />
company. I am talking about Lhe A. I. H. L. because I know there<br />
are other people who will make their humble contribution to<br />
this building by becoming tenants obscure people like<br />
QANTAS and so on I know that, but today I just want to say<br />
a few words about this great and famous company, over one<br />
hundred years old, and therefore, for over a century, associated<br />
with development in Australia in the most remarkable fashion.<br />
Now, whenever I am invited to open something,<br />
I usually like to be given a little of what we, in politics,<br />
call the " dope" and so I got the " dope", volumes of it, and<br />
it was very desirable that I should because I had not as<br />
clearly in the po~ st recognised something about the work of the<br />
.00.0e/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
great pastoral companies in Australia because going back to<br />
the beginning of this hundred years, lustra. Aan wool was sold<br />
in London primarily, and sm dyhad to attend the financing<br />
in the inierim six months, n-fne months and so these<br />
companies of which this one is a conspicuous example came into<br />
exitnce in order to finance the woolgrower, who even then was<br />
extremely hard-up finance the woolgrower until the -money came<br />
in. And that 1 imagine, is how it began. ! Jeil., loohkAng back<br />
over the hundred yea.-s, only a portion of which I can surv:, y<br />
writh my ovm eye I am bound to say and you are bound. J<br />
that the wool industry in particular has been and is greatest<br />
industry in this colantry, Its prosperity has meant the<br />
prosperity of As i0Any period of depression in it has<br />
W been a period of 6tE-pession for Australia. This is our great<br />
industry, And htaving said that, one should ask oneself,<br />
" What has contributed to that?" W4ell, there is the woolgrower<br />
himself who has contributed to it because in my experience of<br />
people who have succeeded their fathers and grandfathers in<br />
wool, they have alwrays aimed at a higher and higher level of<br />
quality and of production. This has been a matter of great<br />
pride to the people concerned and of great advantage to Australia,<br />
and at the same time, companies, and I in particular, refer to<br />
this one, have been able to make a conlribution to the development<br />
of wool, and later on, to the development of cattle and<br />
so on, without which I doubt whether we could have had all the<br />
advance that we have recorded in these years. And why is that?<br />
It is not merely that a pastoral company of this kind has been<br />
able to make business transactions with people. It is the<br />
way in which the transactions have been made that has produced<br />
the results that we are witnessing. It is interesting, I think,<br />
to ask oneself what are the elements in this matter, Might<br />
Iventure to suggest one or two of them to you?<br />
First of all, there has been involved complete<br />
integrity of dealing wiith the people with whom the company<br />
deals complete integrity. One slightest breath of doubt could<br />
have destroyed everything. But a complete integrity of dealing,<br />
maintained over generations, has been a powerful contributing<br />
factor, and so I mention it.<br />
In the second place, there is the knowledge, the<br />
personal knowledge the genuine personal interest of the<br />
individual and in~ Zhe individual. This is true of all sorts of<br />
things. I don't believe that anybody, whatever he is doing,<br />
can achieve success unless he is interested in people, in the<br />
individual person, not interested in them as if they were<br />
statistics in a blue book, but interested in them as human<br />
beings, and after all, the success, Sir, of this great company<br />
is fundamentally based upon the fact that you have at all<br />
stages been interested in the individual, you've knoiwn him,<br />
you've known about him, you have been able to form judgments<br />
about him, individual judgments not mass judgmnents,' and he,<br />
in his turn, coming into the ciiy, coming into a branch, coming<br />
into wherever it may be, has felt that he was an individual and<br />
got to know your own people as individuals, so that there was<br />
mutual confidence, mutual knowledge, and these two things are,<br />
in reality, the basis of the success of an enterprise of this<br />
kind. .* ee/ 2 </p>
<p>-3<br />
And in the third place, you have been able to provide<br />
for people on the land expert knowledge and advice, This is<br />
something of tremendous importance. In my own lifetime, I have<br />
seen the move occur because I was born in the country, in<br />
Victoria I have seen the move occur from a stage at which<br />
just rule of thumb observed: " This was all right. The old<br />
man did this and it is good enough for me." de have moved away<br />
from that to a stage where the resources of science, the resources<br />
of new knowledge have been brought to the hand, to the arm of<br />
the man in the field. This, I think, is tremendously important.<br />
My own Government and it is not the only one in<br />
this field my own Government has for a long time been concerned<br />
about the great problem of extending the results of research<br />
to the man who is actually on the farm, and this may seem a<br />
simple enough matter but it is an almost intractable problem<br />
because we rejoice, as you know, Sir, in Australia in having<br />
seven Governments, of which mine is merely the least considerable,<br />
( Laughter) and some Governments have a power, and some have<br />
another power. It isn't easy to say, " 1dell, that's it. This<br />
is what has been discovered, this is what the research men have<br />
told us this goes out tomorrow under proper organisation to the<br />
man on ihe farm, on the station, wherever he may be."<br />
A great deal of work is being done in this matter a<br />
great deal remains to be done. There is still too far greai<br />
a gap between the work done by the scientist and the applied<br />
scientist and the work actually done on the property itself.<br />
We think this is improving. We hope that it will improve very<br />
much more, but I want to express my public acknowl~ edgment to<br />
companies like yours which have been practising this in a very<br />
real sense for many years who have gone to great pains to have<br />
experts in their own staff's, who have gone to great pains to<br />
see that their expert knowledge and their expert advice has<br />
reached the client of the company in the quickest possible time<br />
and in the most effective possible way, You have been<br />
engaging, although you are in a business, in extension services<br />
in the most practical sense and I therefore take the opportunity<br />
of saying that what you have been doing is w,, ork done in<br />
parallel and sometimes more quickly in parallel with the wrork<br />
that governments are seeking to achieve in Australia.<br />
Then the fourth matter which presented itself to me<br />
was this. I don't believe in the theory that some people have<br />
that a business will succeed as long as you have a lot of hardfaced<br />
fellows on the board who insist on getting the l. ast drop<br />
of juice out of the orange, or if the days are rather bad out<br />
of the lemon. ( Laughter) I don't believe in this. I don't<br />
think that any concern of this kind can possibly grow so<br />
dramatically and it has grown dramatically unless it has a<br />
vision which goes beyond the profit and loss account. Indeed,<br />
if it has the vision, if it has an imaginative grasp of the<br />
problems of the man on the land, its profit and loss account<br />
will turn out to be all right because it will represent the<br />
results of imagination and vigour,<br />
The two things that have to be kept in mind if the<br />
imagination is to be exercised in this countiy are the necessity<br />
for productivity Diore and more productivity in unit terms<br />
and growth, growth with productivity. This is what we depena<br />
on, In Australia our population is growing very rapidly<br />
for one reason or another, but it is growing very rapidly, and<br />
0 0 00 0 / 1+ </p>
<p>the demands of our people are growing very rapidly. As<br />
living standards rise, as purchasing power becomes greater<br />
so we have a greater and greater demand, This demand canit<br />
just be satisfied by more imports though it may have to be<br />
to a degree it can't just be satisfied by the inflow of<br />
capital from other countries although we've been rich in<br />
that over a long time now; lundamentally it has to be met<br />
by an increased production and activity in our owm country,<br />
leading to bigger exports, leading to greater strength in<br />
the international exchanges, but above all, leading to an<br />
increased development of wrealth in Australia. Therefore,<br />
productivity must never be overlooked and the need for growth<br />
must never be overlooked. I venture to say that every man<br />
who has an executive responsibility, either here or in a<br />
branch or in the field is cons:-' ous of this and knows that<br />
the best thing he can do for tthe client of the company is to<br />
help him to improve his productivity, to help him to have a<br />
contemplation of growth for the future so that he is never<br />
satisfied with what is going on today but has an imagination<br />
big enough and lively enough to contemplate what is going to<br />
happen next year and in ten years'I time and in fifty years'<br />
time. Now, in all these things this great company has<br />
been carrying out work, I think, ol national importance, and<br />
it satisfies me very much as no socialist, as you way<br />
understand; it satisfies me very much that you have not<br />
done this as the servant of government but as the ally and<br />
friend of government. I know I didn't come down in the<br />
last political showrer and I know that even in your boardroom<br />
from time to time rude noises will be made about my<br />
Government itts my Government at present but somebodyts<br />
Government some time in the future. I know that, This is<br />
good, this is very healthy. I have always been more receptive<br />
to hooting than to applause. I find it very stimulating.<br />
( Laughter) And in the middle-of all that, never forget that<br />
we are playing in the same team, we are in the same interest,<br />
we are both serving this country we, occasionally, by<br />
compulsion; you, not by compulsion but by a great voluntary<br />
and highly intelligent effort.<br />
Now, Sir, I don't want to weary this audience, but<br />
I thought I would like to mention those particular matters<br />
because this is a great day in the history of the company,<br />
a wonderful day. It is a pity that a nice old building had to<br />
be knocked over, isn't it. I sometimes think it is a pity<br />
that in fifty yedrs' time by which time, I assure you, I will<br />
no longer be Prime Minister of Australia ( Laughter) it<br />
comforts me to know it doesn't comfort me rather it<br />
shocks me to know that in fifty years' time, almost every city<br />
will look like almrost every other city. I suppose this is<br />
inevitable in the course of nature because there are some<br />
lovely things in this city, but still, they can't stand in the<br />
wray of development, for practical purposes of the kind of<br />
thing that I have been talking about. I iherefore want to<br />
say to you, publicly, that I thank you on behalf of the<br />
Government for the work that you are doing and that as an<br />
individual, I esteem it a singular honour o be invited to<br />
come here and to declare this building open. 0 </p>
<p>Before I conclude, I must tell you this is one<br />
of my better deed;~ but not entirely voluntary, because about<br />
six months ago, I said to my Secretary, " ILook, I've had this.<br />
I must cut down on my public engagements. There are far<br />
too many speeches to be made and I am very tired of it,<br />
Letts refuse all the invitations that come in for the next<br />
three months." That was a bold stroke, you seel this is<br />
what I believe they call a crash programme " Le Is refuse<br />
them" and so I think I refused this one, and then it turned<br />
out that my Deputy High Commissioner in London, in some way<br />
having become involved with this company I mean in a<br />
perfectly honourable way ( Laughter) he kept sending messages<br />
saying, " As a personal favour60and so when a Prime<br />
Minister is confronted by a Deputy High Commissioner, it<br />
is always difficult but when the Deputy High Commissioner<br />
turns out to have been the Head of the Prime Minister's<br />
Department for half a dozen years, it becomes impossible, and<br />
so I said, " I succumb. I will do it." I have done it very<br />
badly but I assure you I have done it with very great pleasure.<br />
I declare the building open. 5 </p>
