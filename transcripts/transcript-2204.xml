PRIME MINISTER ANSWERS DR. J. CAIRNS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. J. G. Gor-ton, to-day commented<br />
on statements by Dr. J. Cairns in the Australian press.<br />
The Prime Minister said<br />
" Having called for the streets of Melbourne to be taken<br />
over, for the traffic to be brought to a stand-still and i-or Commerce and<br />
industry to be disrupted, Dr. Cairns has now tried to divert attention<br />
from his irresponsible actions by making a personal attack on me.<br />
" If this gives him any satisfaction, it causes me no<br />
distress. " But it doesn't alter the fact that he has called for massive<br />
disruption, has indicated that violence will occur if that disruption is<br />
prevented and has heralded bringing into the Australian pattern of<br />
life the kinds of methods used by storm-trooperG.<br />
" Either he or the Labor Party ought to disavow this call<br />
for anarchy, and if neither does disavow it, theni the peoole of Australia<br />
know the methods the Labor Party is prepared to adopt."<br />
CANBERRA March 197J </p>
