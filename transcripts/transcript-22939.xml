<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How would you describe the achievements of this Paralympic team?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely magnificent. A great example to all of us. My wife and I saw, along with thousands of other Australians, we saw many of the events. Itâs the greatest tally of gold medals, the greatest Paralympics ever and a huge boost to the whole cause of the Paralympics â thatâs the best thing. Itâs really put Paralympics on the map in a way that it wasnât before and Iâm so happy about that. The Australian public has been magnificent and there will be a different attitude and mindset about Paralympics as a result of these Games. I thank the people of Australia, particularly the people of Sydney, for the fantastic support and enthusiastic barracking that they gave to these wonderful athletes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you surprised by that level of enthusiasm? Did you expect that there would be so many spectators?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Australians are always fair and enthusiastic about good sport and they were great athletic performances. Itâs just so encouraging to see that happen. I never doubt the generosity and decency of Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think Australians have set a standard that the rest of the world is going to have to match over the coming years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. As we did with the Olympics.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think it is about Australians that does that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are a can-do country and the fact that weâre such an egalitarian, fair minded country. We have the motto of the fair go. We donât have that for nothing. We do give people a fair go, itâs one of our great qualities and we should be very pleased about it.</p>
