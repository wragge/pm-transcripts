OPENING OF CASEY WING AT ROYAL MEL-BOURNE<br />
INSTITUTE OF ' TECHNOLOGY, MELBOURNE 2 JUNE 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
You were kind enough, Mr. ' Chairman, to mention an early<br />
association of mine with this concept of Colleges of Advanced Education.<br />
And indeed it was, I think, a bold and new experiment to start such colleges<br />
and to make them not competitive with universities, not on a collision<br />
course with universities but turning out people with the same graduate<br />
W standards as the university could turn out, and with a slightly different<br />
motivation in their education. So many of them, unfortunately, ( because<br />
I heard what some had said in the back previously) destined, I am afraid,<br />
to become bourgeousie. And, indeed, Mr. President, the time had come in Australia<br />
when this new experiment should be begun. We are going to have, between<br />
11967 and 1972, 50 per cent more students staying in matriculation forms<br />
at secondary schools and then coming on to tertiary education. And what<br />
we see here in this building is not only the beginning of a ten-year plan of<br />
great significance for this RMIT College of Advanced Education, but is an<br />
example of what is happening through the length and breadth of Australia<br />
in these kinds of institutions. So that in Ballarat, in the Gordon Institute<br />
of Technology, in Bendigo, in every capital city from Rockhampton to<br />
Kalgoorlie, these buildings are going up to serve the requirements of<br />
students who want practical education as well as liberal education and to<br />
serve the requirements of this nation now and in the future.<br />
Mr. Chairman, I think that in the last four or five years or<br />
so, there has been a great advance in the provision for education in Australia.<br />
We have, for example, taking the Commonwealth Government alone, reached<br />
~ astage where we are providing $ 17 a head of population for education,<br />
whereas some years ago it was<br />
The capital requirements alone for buildings such as this,<br />
for universities, for science laboratories in schools, for libraries in schools<br />
totalled some $ 248 M. and adding in all the scholarships that have beer,<br />
brought newly in or expanded, the Australian Government, without<br />
mentioning State Governments, is spending some $ 210 M. a year on<br />
education. Indeed, Mr. President, I can say with some pride to quote<br />
a phrase I seem to have read some time ago that the Australian<br />
Government is " poking its bib into education" in quite a significant way<br />
and to the good of the nation as a whole. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Mr, President, it was some eighty years ago, I believe, that<br />
~"~; Francis Ormond started this College and set the ball rolling, and at that<br />
tietrade unionists subscribed half a crown a head to the capital required<br />
to begin what has now grown and is now growing into a magriificant institution.<br />
And half a crown a head i those days for a trade unionist was no small<br />
Isum of money. It must be as much satisfaction to you, Sir, as it is to me<br />
to see that on the Representative Council of this College the Trades Union<br />
Council is still represented, and may it continue to be so represented.<br />
We will not really know in Australia what the end results<br />
of this will be for some few years. We must wait to see what the reports<br />
are, coming back from industry in Australia. But that there is a requirement<br />
for this kind of education cannot be argued against. Let's take 6ne example<br />
only. The Mining Industry Council just recently pointed out that there would<br />
be a need for twice as many engineers in 1972 in Australia as there is today,<br />
and these, these practical engineers must come from colleges such as this.<br />
iThat is but one example of the requirements of technical education which<br />
V must be allied with a liberal education at the same time.<br />
Sir, you are not, as I said before, embarked on a competitive<br />
or a collision course with universities. Rather you are developing an<br />
alternative system, and I believe it is up to everybody sitting here today,<br />
and indeed everybody standing here today, particularly if they come from<br />
this college and not from outside, to endeavour to sell as hard as is possible<br />
the great requirement for graduates from this kind of college and the great<br />
contribution they can make to our national life.<br />
But it does not, it must not mean that the education here<br />
provided is narrower than the education provided in established universities.<br />
All it means, and what it must mean is that the twig, as it were, is being<br />
bent so that it grows into a great strong tree of as great significance and<br />
able to contribute as much as can any tree grown on any established<br />
university campus. This is something new and an example of progress<br />
that is happening. But it is only a beginning. It is, of course, only a<br />
beginning in the active development of educational systems in Australia<br />
Igenerally. We are here, I think, breaking out with this concept from<br />
the conventions of the past, from the conventions applying to education in<br />
the past, good though they were, strong though they must continue to be.<br />
* Nevertheless, new times demand new thinking and new ways, and from<br />
these colleges new thinking and new ways will, I believe, come. This we<br />
are trying to provide but its success will depend on those going through<br />
the colleges and what they get out of them and what they will contribute to<br />
the nation after they have finished. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Mr. President, I believe that this college can do a great deal<br />
to see that the concept is successful. And I am delighted to see that your<br />
Department Advisory Committee includes representatives of all branches<br />
of industry, because this will help to spread throughout Victoria what the<br />
Victorian Government, our own Government and you are trying to do.<br />
Sir, I believe this that from this new concept will come<br />
students with the skills we require, the more highly developed skills we<br />
require and the cultivated minds that individuals require so that they will<br />
be able to go out into the nation and work in a field they wish to work in,<br />
in which they can develop their own personality, in which they can contribute<br />
to their own satisfaction and to the growth of this country to which they<br />
belong.<br />
b I now declare this building the Casey Building open. </p>
