PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA7 AUGUST 1988<br />
The Government has decided to make 1988/ 89 a year of<br />
citizenship. This will be an appropriate initiative flowing from<br />
Australia's Bicentennial year, in which all Australians have<br />
been celebrating their pride in their nationhood.<br />
As I stressed in my Australia Day address, what makes a<br />
person an Australian is having a commitment to Australia.<br />
It is that common commitment which binds Aboriginal<br />
Australians, the Australian-born of the seventh or eighth<br />
generation and all those of their fellow-Australians born in<br />
any of the 130 countries from which our people are drawn.<br />
The commitment is all.<br />
The ultimate expression of commitment is contained in the<br />
Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance to which a person<br />
subscribes when they take up Australian citizenship.<br />
I know that many of the one million eligible people who are<br />
not currently citizens have a strong commitmentto<br />
Australia, and that there are many reasons why, people have<br />
not taken the citizenship step. For example, many people<br />
from Britain came here at a time when the difference between<br />
being a British subject and an Australian citizen was not<br />
clear.<br />
The Government does not believe that it should force people<br />
into taking up citizenship. For that reason, we do not<br />
intend to threaten people with punitive measures if they do<br />
not take it up. To do so would demean the value of<br />
citizenship. In our free society, this must be a voluntary<br />
step taken consciously and willingly.<br />
The correct approach is to seek to persuade as many of our<br />
fellow Australian residents as possible who are not citizens<br />
to take up citizenship. This will be the objective of the<br />
Year of Citizenship campaign.<br />
Over the years i have attended many citizenship ceremonies.<br />
I recently attended one in my electorate at which over 100<br />
people from 25 different nationalities showed their<br />
commitment to Australia by taking Australian citizenship.<br />

Like everyone else there, I found it a very moving and<br />
joyous occasion, which was clearly one of the most important<br />
nights of their lives for people who were granted<br />
citizenship at the ceremony.<br />
On that occasion, I spoke of the importance of diversity<br />
within a united and cohesive Australia. This is exactly<br />
what multiculturalism means.<br />
I have asked my Ministers and backbenchers to give a high<br />
priority to attending citizenship ceremonies in the future.<br />
The Government will also be looking at ways of more closely<br />
involving Local Government in the campaign.<br />
my colleague, the minister for Immigration, Local Government<br />
and Ethnic Affairs, Clyde Holding, will develop the detailed<br />
mechanisms for the Year of Citizenship. 877 </p>
