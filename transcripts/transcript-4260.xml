FOR PRESS 21 OCTOBER 1976<br />
SEPTEMBER QUARTER CONSUMER PRIC) INDEX<br />
The Consumer Price Index released today shows that<br />
Australia's rate of inflation has moderated further in<br />
the September quarter.<br />
This is a pleasing result. It indicates that the<br />
Government's economic strategy is beginning to show clear<br />
results. The increase in the September quarter was 2.2 percent<br />
compared with the 2.5 percent in the June quarter and<br />
percent in the March quarter.<br />
Leaving aside the effects of Medibank on the index for<br />
the September quarter 1975 ( without which the increase of<br />
0.8 percent would have been 2.9 percent), the September<br />
quarter this year recorded the lowest increase since the<br />
March quarter of 1973.<br />
It is a particularly encouraging sign that the rise in<br />
non-food prices should have moderated sharply from<br />
3.3 percent in the June quarter to 1.9 percent in the<br />
September quarter. This was clear evidence of the benefits<br />
of the moderation in wage increases to which the<br />
Government's policies have been directed.<br />
The foundations for a sound, sustainable recovery in economic<br />
conditions and employment are now clearly emerging.<br />
Although the task ahead remains great, the CPI result<br />
indicates a welcome move in the right direction.<br />
