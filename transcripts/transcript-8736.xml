STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MEETING WITH TV NETWORK CHIEFS<br />
This afternoon met the heads of the three comnmercial television networks, Bob Campbell<br />
of thc 7 Network, Gary Rice of 10 and David Leckie of 9, and Tony Branigan thc general<br />
manager of thc Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations to discuss the<br />
question of violence in films shwn on television.'<br />
I put to them my concern that the present system of broadcasting violent, AO. rated films<br />
at 8.30 exposed too many children to unsuitable material. Since I raised tllis issu e in the,<br />
Parliament several weeks ago, [ hfa-ve received hundreds of letters from equally conccrned<br />
parents who are worried about the impact of violent films on their children.<br />
The networks informed me they will incorporate the following changes to their selfregulatory<br />
code:<br />
mandatory standardised indications of the levels of violence, sex and coarse language<br />
in AO films to be broadcast before films in both audio and visual form<br />
a clear visual indication at the start of each segmient of the film's classification<br />
6 restrict the carly evening promotion of AO films.<br />
broadcast regular announcements explaining the meaning of classification symbols<br />
and content descriptions, increasing the frequency of such announcements during<br />
school holidays.<br />
0 urge newspapers and magazines to display and explain the symbols and content<br />
descriptions when listing television programs.<br />
The networks have also agreed to run a high visibility press advertising campaign during<br />
December to support their on-air announcements.<br />

1 welcomed these improvements to present program descriptions but argued they did not<br />
go far enoughi to meet thc concerns of parents and others about the content of programs<br />
broadcast while substantial numbers of children are watching. As a result of our<br />
discussions two further steps were agreed. Thie networks have undcrtakcnt to work<br />
towards agreement on a common classificatl n systpi. po that television films are rated by<br />
the same system that applies to movies screened in cinemas and to videos.<br />
As previously announced, I Intend to propose to the Council of Australian Governments<br />
mecting in Perth on Dcember 7 that the States and Territories agree to split the prescnt<br />
classification into two, segregating the more violent anid sexually explicit films and<br />
videos. If we can secure agreement for this, Australia will then enjoy a more rational and<br />
sensible uniform classification system.<br />
In addition, in response to my concerns about children being exposed to violent films, the<br />
networks have undertaken to prepare a detailed briefing for me on thc economic and other<br />
consequences of changing the times at which movies are presently screcned. I look<br />
forward to asscssing this advice early next week and taking account of, among other<br />
things, the proposed creation of a " softcr" classification through splitting the present<br />
category.<br />
