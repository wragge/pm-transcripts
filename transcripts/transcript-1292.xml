I. M. No. 38/ 1966<br />
VISIT TO SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr'. Harold Holt<br />
on his arrival in Singapore<br />
I am at the beginnin7 of a short 7isit to<br />
South-East Asian countries which will take me in the coming days<br />
to Viet Nam, Thailand, Malaysia ( includinr a visit to Kuchin*<br />
in Sarawak) and Sinpapore. At this time J am in Singapore<br />
purely in transit, but I shall be meetina Singapore Ministers<br />
for discussions at a later stage in my tour.<br />
My visit is designed to take me to those<br />
South-East Asian countries where Australian forces are serving.<br />
Australia has now and immediately in prospect some 8,000<br />
servicemen in the region. Australian forces are involved in the<br />
defence of these c~ untries under arrangements based on mutual<br />
understandin7 and partnership. We are determined to be a Rood<br />
ally. I shall be explaining to the GQvernments in the region<br />
the active steps which Australia is taking to expand its defence<br />
effort and to shape it for the requirements of collective regional<br />
security. We have taken part in the defence of Singapore<br />
and Malaysia for many years and are proud to have made a<br />
contribution to the preservation of security and stability in<br />
this region. Our forces are now oammitted in a combat role in<br />
Viet Nam, at the request ef the Government of the Republic of<br />
Viet Nam, in assisting the Vietnamese people in their struggle<br />
to defend their national independence aqainst communist aggression.<br />
This awression in the Puise of " a war of national liberation"<br />
or " people's war" is being relentlessly waoed through techniques<br />
of infiltration, terror, subversion and direct military attack.<br />
My visit will not be confined to the immediate<br />
military and security problems, important as they are. I hope<br />
to have discussions with Governments about what Australia can do<br />
to assist in the achievement of social progress and economic<br />
development. The Australian Government wishes to ensure that<br />
the role we play in the fields of economic development, technical<br />
assistance, education and in developing the skills of the region,<br />
is vigorous and prcductive. Australia, of course, is already<br />
closely enap-ed in these matters through the Colombo Plan,<br />
ECAFE, the new Asian Development Bank mand in other ways. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Recent years have seen Australia and most of the<br />
countries of South and South East Asia come much closer together<br />
undcr the pressure of events. This has been accompanied by a<br />
marked growth of understanding, mutual confidence and respect.<br />
It emerges clearly from our political and diplomatic relationships<br />
that, despite the separateness of our histories and of our<br />
cultural backTrounds, our national aims and external attitudes<br />
are very similar indeed respect for national independence,<br />
pear--and stability, economic development, widening opportunities<br />
and conditions of freedom.<br />
This is my first visit abroad as the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia. I am 4lad that it is being made to the region of<br />
South-East Asia where we believe that we have with friendly<br />
neighbours a stron. sense of common interest and mutuality of<br />
purpose. SINGAPORE, 21 April, 1966. </p>
