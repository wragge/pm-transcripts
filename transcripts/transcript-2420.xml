FOR PRESS SPM No. 54/ 1971<br />
DEATH OF SIR PETER HEYDON<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Sir Peter Heydon was one of the best-liked and respected<br />
public servants in Canberra.<br />
His untimely death is a tragic loss to Australia.<br />
I have known and valued his friendship for many years. His<br />
death came as a great shock to me.<br />
An outstanding Australian who spent a lifetime in service<br />
to this nation, Sir Peter Heydon had a long and very distinguished<br />
career with the Department of External Affairs both overseas and in<br />
Australia. He often acted as Head of that Department. He became<br />
Permanent Head of the Department of Immigration in 1961.<br />
He was a warm and human person and he was an international<br />
authority on immigration.<br />
My wife and I extend our deepest sympathy to his widow<br />
and family.<br />
