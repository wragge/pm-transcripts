    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government is taking action to strengthen the integrity of the foreign investment framework.</p>
<p>Foreign investment is integral to Australia’s economy and we welcome all investment that is not contrary to our national interest.</p>
<p>After extensive consultations on our Options Paper, we are announcing important reforms to foreign investment that will help to demonstrate that it is for our country’s benefit.</p>
<p>We will ensure stronger enforcement of new and existing foreign investment rules by transferring all residential real estate functions to the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
<p>The ATO will use its data-matching systems to identify possible breaches and the Commonwealth will pursue those foreign investors who break the rules.</p>
<p>Australia’s foreign investment regime generally does not allow foreign investors to purchase existing residential properties.</p>
<p>There will now be stricter penalties to make it easier to pursue foreign investors who breach the rules. Criminal penalties will be increased to $127,500 or three years imprisonment for individuals and to $637,500 for companies.</p>
<p>Divestment orders will be supplemented by civil pecuniary penalties and infringement notices for less serious breaches.</p>
<p>The Government will also ensure that people who break the rules do not profit by introducing a civil penalty to capture any capital gain made on divestment of a property.</p>
<p>Third parties who knowingly assist a foreign investor to breach the rules will also now be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $42,500 for individuals and $212,500 for companies.</p>
<p>Australian taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for screening foreign investment application applications. Fees will be levied on all foreign investment applications. For residential properties valued at $1 million or less, foreign investors will pay a fee of $5,000. Higher fees will apply to more expensive residential properties as well as business, agriculture and commercial real estate applications.</p>
<p>Australia’s foreign investment policy for residential real estate is designed to increase Australia’s housing stock, but lack of enforcement over recent years has threatened the integrity of the framework.</p>
<p>We will enforce the rules, ensuring that all foreign investors follow the rules and don’t profit from breaking them.</p>
<p>The Government will introduce legislation into Parliament in the Spring Sittings to ensure that the reforms will commence on 1 December 2015.</p>
<p>There will also be increased scrutiny around foreign investment in agriculture and increased transparency on the levels of foreign ownership in Australia through a comprehensive land register.</p>
<p>Further information on the agricultural changes, fees and the penalty regime is attached.</p>
