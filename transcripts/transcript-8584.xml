GLOBALISM AND REGIONALISM: AUSTRALIA'S TRADE POLICY<br />
AGENDA 70R THE 90S KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURERS' CONFERENCE ON " ASIA 2010"<br />
MELBOURNE, MONDAY 20 JULY 1992<br />
You have been talking at your conference here today<br />
about our region, and how we the people of the region<br />
will fare over the next couple of decades.<br />
This evening I want to talk about how Australia and<br />
our region may change over this time, and how the<br />
choices we make today will decide what kind of world<br />
we and our children will find in the new century.<br />
You'll notice that I have already taken Australia to<br />
be part of the Asian region, which is in itself<br />
something of a change in our thinking. We are<br />
geographically part of it, and much of the change in<br />
Australia in recent years has been a process of<br />
cultural attitudes somewhat reluctantly accommodating<br />
themselveg' to geographical facts.<br />
As Presid'ent Soeharto and I agreed during my recent<br />
visit to Indonesia, it is hard to change attitudes,<br />
but not as hard as changing geography!<br />
our economy is also increasingly integrated into the<br />
region, and the visitors here this evening will have<br />
seen in our cities evidence that the fastest growing<br />
migrant population in this country is from Asia.<br />
In the last decade or so the Asian region has been<br />
transformed into the most rapidly growing regional<br />
economy in the world, with a high share of exports in<br />
output, and a high degree of trade within the region. </p>
<p>If we include Canada and the United States irn the<br />
wider region, as we do in APEC, then of course we are<br />
talking about the preponderant grouping in the world<br />
economy, with half the world's output and almost half<br />
the world's trade. Of that trade, nearly two thirds<br />
is with other members of the group.<br />
Australia has been a full participant in these<br />
regional changes, and over the next few decades we<br />
intend to integrate ourselves into our region even<br />
more closely.<br />
But I think that we will soon have to make important<br />
choices in our region. We will soon have to decide<br />
how we as a region, and Australia as a member the<br />
region, will respond to the emerging new pattern in<br />
world affairs which follows the collapse of the Soviet<br />
Union-.. one of the powerful realities we must recognise is<br />
that economic regionalism is shaping the post Cold War<br />
order. As the era of the Cold War ended, we discovered that<br />
we were already entering the era of Maastricht and<br />
NAFTA. In our own region Asean has said it will form<br />
a trade area, and all the countries of the region have<br />
created the 15 member APEC grouping with an agenda of<br />
discussions on trade liberalisation.<br />
But paradoxically another powerful force encouraged by<br />
the of the end of the Cold War is globalism.<br />
The market economy model is now nearly universally<br />
accepted in industrial countries. The former<br />
communist countries are rapidly being integrated into<br />
global institutions like GATT, the IMF and the World<br />
Bank. We are seeing issues like the environment and<br />
weapons proliferation dealt with in global forums.<br />
And in Ki. wait and Cambodia we witness the United<br />
Nations play a role it has not been able to play for<br />
decades. Though they appear to be contradictory, these two<br />
forces of regionalism and globalism are in fact<br />
complementary. They are the two economically unifying counterweights<br />
to the forces of nationalism, ethnicity and religion<br />
which have also been released by the end of the post<br />
war ideological battle.<br />
Certainly I regard them as complementary, and<br />
Australia's international economic policy-embraces<br />
both a global and a regional strategy. </p>
<p>3<br />
The job for governments everywhere is to fit these two<br />
forces of regionalism and globalism together at a time<br />
when, for better or worse, the Uruguay Round of the<br />
GATT is coming to a conclusion.<br />
This recognition that economic regionalism is a<br />
dominant force in the world economy does not for a<br />
moment mean we have lost faith in GATT. It does not<br />
mean that we will cease doing whatever we can,<br />
whenever and wherever we can, to entrench through the<br />
GATT a stronger set of principles of fair trade to<br />
which all countries subscribe.<br />
But we do recognise that trade and investment growth<br />
today is predominantly within regions, that Europe<br />
from the Atlantic to at least the Urals and perhaps<br />
beyond is firmly set on a course of deep economic<br />
integration over coming decades, and that in all<br />
probability we shall be dealing with another free<br />
trade area from Canada to Mexico by the end of this<br />
year. We might not like this evolution, but whether we like<br />
it or not we cannot stop it. The only question is how<br />
we should respond to it.<br />
That is a theme to which I will return later, but let<br />
me set the scene for the next few decades by telling<br />
you about how Australia has changed in the last decade<br />
to prepare itself for the changes to come.<br />
For the decades following World War Two we in this<br />
country hid behind tariff barriers, creating what by<br />
the early eighties had become an industrial museum.<br />
The economy was highly regulated and unable to adjust<br />
to the explosion of growth which was then occurring in<br />
Asia. Over the l~ st decade we have radically reformed.<br />
We tloated the dollar and deregulated financial<br />
markets, replaced conflict with consensus in<br />
industrial relations, set in place a program of tariff<br />
cuts and industry modernisation, and pruned the<br />
government sector<br />
More recently we have encouraged a wholesale shift<br />
into enterprise bargaining as the principal means of<br />
deciding wages, and pushed forward a program of<br />
industry reform which has dramatically increased the<br />
productivity of our ports, and changed the face of our<br />
aviation and telecommunications industries.<br />
We are beginning now on vast new improvements to our<br />
railway~ s and roads. </p>
<p>4<br />
In our One Nation statement earlier this year, we made<br />
changes to our business taxation system which make it<br />
one of the most competitive Among industrial<br />
countries. And I am glad to say that the results of this reform<br />
process have shown up in the transformation of our<br />
trade a transformation in volumes, composition and<br />
destination. A decade ago Australia exported less than one sixth of<br />
our production.<br />
Today we export over a fifth, and it has been steadily<br />
climbing over the whole period.<br />
A decade ago we more often than not imported more<br />
goods pnd services each month than we exported.<br />
Today, we export more than we import. Most Australians<br />
would probably be surprised to know that we have a<br />
stronger goods trading balance than many other<br />
countries in the region, including Singapore,<br />
Thailand, Malaysia, and Korea.<br />
A decade ago Australia had one of the highest<br />
inflation rates in the industrial world.<br />
Today it is one of the lowest, and lower than most of<br />
our regional trading partners.<br />
A decade ago our cost structure made it hard for<br />
exporters to compete.<br />
Today we have increased our competitiveness by a<br />
tenth, and entrenched our competitive advantage with<br />
low inflation and high productivity growth.<br />
As the sheer volume of our exports increased, their<br />
compositi-, on and direction changed.<br />
Both our services exports and manufactured exports<br />
have tripled over the last decade. Last year for the<br />
first time we exported more manufactured products than<br />
rural products. Manufactures earn us more than metal<br />
ores and minerals, or tourism or coal.<br />
Nine out of ten of our largest export markets are now<br />
in Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Today, more than half of our merchandise exports go to<br />
Asia. The countries of. ASEAN are today collectivrely a bigger<br />
export market for us than either the US or the EC. </p>
<p>Ou~ r aim is to be at home in the region, with a highly<br />
competitive world class manufacturing sector,<br />
exporting a diverse range of commodities, manufactures<br />
and services to the region and beyond.<br />
The slow growth we and most other industrial economies<br />
are now experiencing as we recover from recession<br />
obscures the very real change in the economy. But<br />
even with slow growth, we have found that far from<br />
destroying our manufacturing base in this country our<br />
structural reforms have nourished it.<br />
Our manufacturing output today is nearly a tenth<br />
higher than it was a decade ago and nearly a third<br />
higher than it was twenty years ago, the so-called<br />
" golden era" of protected Australian manufacturing.<br />
And as I have explained, we are exporting more of our<br />
manufdoturing output than ever before.<br />
The range and pace of our structural reforms over the<br />
last decade demonstrate our recognition that whatever<br />
happens in the world trading environment we will cope<br />
with it best if we ourselves are as nimble, fleetfooted<br />
and adaptable as possible.<br />
Both the region and this country have profoundly<br />
changed over the last decade. What will happen in the<br />
next two?<br />
I spoke earlier about the strategic choices we face as<br />
the Uruguay round comes to an end, as Europe continues<br />
on a deeper and more comprehensive integration, and as<br />
the United States creates its own free trade area with<br />
Canada and Mexico.<br />
The choice is between entrenching the prosperity of<br />
the region through increasing global openness, or<br />
being forced onto second best paths which restrict<br />
trade and ' Ieave us all worse off.<br />
if governioents make the right decisions, if the<br />
Uruguay Round succeeds and the countries of our region<br />
continue to liberalise, then over the next two decades<br />
East Asia will continue to be the fastest growing area<br />
of the world economy.<br />
Growth of Asian markets will continue to exceed that<br />
of other markets, including the EC and North America,<br />
as population grows and incomes rise.<br />
Japan will be an even stronger, better balanced<br />
economy, while the smaller Asian market economies will<br />
increasingly be concentrating on services and of fshore<br />
manufacturing. </p>
<p>Some, like Korea will have joined the OECD and other<br />
industrial3i-sTd-cuntry organisations. There will be a<br />
new pack of " tigers" in South East Asia, benefiting<br />
from political and strategic stability, and more<br />
outward-looking economic policies.<br />
With a new generation of leaders, China is likely to<br />
commit itself increasingly to the market model, taking<br />
the lead from its thriving coastal trading economy.<br />
Korea may perhaps be reunited, ultimately bringing to<br />
the North the economic prosperity that is transforming<br />
the South.<br />
If all goes well, the three nations of Indochina will<br />
also be growing market economies.<br />
APEC will evolve into an outward looking regional<br />
trading group, with the participation of both Japan<br />
and the United States.<br />
Australia will be changed, too, with an even larger<br />
trade sector, more exports of services and<br />
manufactures, and a-still sharper focus on markets<br />
within the region.<br />
The realisation of this world depends upon increasing<br />
trade within the region, which in turn depends upon<br />
countries' being as willing to buy other countries<br />
exports as they are to sell their own.<br />
It depends on making the right decision to lower<br />
regional trade barriers at the same time as we<br />
entrench fairer global rules.<br />
But if we make the wrong decisions, or if they are<br />
forced upon us, we face another possible future by<br />
2010 a future quite different to the one I sketched<br />
earlier. If the reD~ ion cannot continue to open its own markets,<br />
and still worse if we begin to encounter difficulty in<br />
markets of Europe and North America, then the forces<br />
now underpinning the region's success will be<br />
reversed. We would see a weakened world trade system, with GATT<br />
rules increasingly flouted.<br />
We could see an inward looking North American Free<br />
Trade Agreement, possibly extended throughout the<br />
Americas, edging out competitors from its markets.<br />
We could see Europe going its own way, placating a<br />
multitude of domestic constituencies at tfie expense of<br />
foreign competitors, and of its own future prosperity.. </p>
<p>We could see Japan defensively creating a regional yen<br />
bloc, based on preferential trade and investment<br />
rules. Lesser developed areas, like China and Indochina,<br />
stunted in growth.<br />
And Australia, its exports markets restricted, forced<br />
into difficult economic and strategic choices between<br />
the United States and Japan.<br />
As I said earlier, the choice between the bright<br />
scenario and the gloomy scenario will depend on how we<br />
fit together the forces of regionalism and globalism<br />
in trade policy.<br />
For my part I think the best fit is attained when we<br />
work towards the strongest set of universally agreed<br />
minimwft standards we can on a global basis, and at the<br />
same time attempt to do better on a regional basis.<br />
Given the large and diverse membership of GATT, it is<br />
inevitable that an agreement which is universally<br />
acceptable must leave plenty of opportunities for<br />
regions and subregions to improve on the benchmark<br />
without violating its rules.<br />
And given the fact of propinquity, it is inevitable<br />
that regional arrangements which are GATT friendly<br />
will nonetheless be of greatest benefit to the region<br />
concerned. So we will be seeking constantly to strengthen<br />
international trading rules through the global<br />
institution, GATT, at the same time as we seek to<br />
build regional trade and economic arrangements which<br />
take us beyond what we have been able to achieve on a<br />
global conpensus.<br />
We remain* committed to a successful Uruguay Round<br />
because i~ t can bring us substantial benefits, not just<br />
in agricul'ture but also in manufactures, services,<br />
intellectual property rights and many other areas.<br />
According to one cautious Canadian study, the package<br />
now before us would, if agreed, increase global income<br />
by something of the order of 120 billion dollars a<br />
year. As you know, no breakthrough came about during the<br />
Munich Summit of the G7. I do not pretend to be other<br />
than disappointed at the failure so far to bridge the<br />
remaining differences. We will be pressing hard for<br />
the G7 leaders to make good their commitmqnt to reach<br />
a balanced agreement before the end of the year. </p>
<p>8<br />
Stalling the round indefinitely would be a failure of<br />
political leadership on a grand scale. It would<br />
represent a shameful capitulation to the self ish<br />
forces of economic protection.<br />
But while successful GATT outcome is important it<br />
won't begin to exhaust the trade growth possibilities<br />
in the region.<br />
According to a study by the Centre for International<br />
Economics, the Asia Pacific region would gain the<br />
equivalent of $ 300 billion if the countries of the<br />
region were to agree to liberalise with a fifty per<br />
cant reduction in tariff and non tariff barriers.<br />
APEC holds great promise in this next phase of trade<br />
reform. Institutionalisation of APEC will signal a<br />
new area in regional economic co-operation. APEC<br />
members have committed themselves to reducing barriers<br />
to trade amongst themselves in a GATT-friendly way.<br />
Already APEC working groups are hard at work in<br />
different sectoral projects. In the next 12 months we<br />
are likely to see substantial outcomes from various<br />
projects which will yield significant practical<br />
benefits for business. These include customs reforms,<br />
changes to administrative barriers to market access,<br />
development of tariff databases, and others.<br />
in some areas it will be possible to move forward in<br />
smaller groups of economies say like-minded groups<br />
in the Western Pacific and then extend agreements<br />
later to take in all APEC members, or even economies<br />
not yet in APEC.. The Trade Minister, John Kerin, and<br />
I will therefore be asking our senior trade officials<br />
to explore some of these options with regional<br />
countries before the end of the year.<br />
One possibility is to look at the potential offered by<br />
the. growihg aviation market in our hemisphere. on<br />
current trends, by 2010 Asia will have consolidated<br />
its place hs the world's pre-eminent international<br />
aviation market. -This process could be enriched<br />
through an expansion of regional aviation rights.<br />
Other possibilities include regional agreements on<br />
investment and on services, including<br />
telecommunications, banking and insurance.<br />
As a steel exporter, and also as a supplier of raw<br />
materials to the steel makers of north Asia, Australia<br />
would also be receptive to discussions on a regional<br />
steel agreement, if the global talks remain stalled. </p>
<p>9<br />
over coming months we will be reexamining trade policy<br />
options in the light of the Uruguay Round outcome and<br />
regional developments. Some of these options are<br />
reviewed in discussion papers commissioned by the<br />
government and prepared by Professor Richard Snape,<br />
which will be released by the Minister for Trade on<br />
Wednesday. The papers will contribute to the debate on our<br />
national trade strategy which will be capped by a<br />
comprehensive Ministerial Statement by Mr Kerin in<br />
October. I have no doubt that regionalism will become<br />
increasingly important to us in coming decades. That<br />
is why I have this evening suggested a few regional<br />
trade initiatives we will pursue. But we should<br />
always bear in mind that the region has founded its<br />
development on trade and, more than any other, enjoys<br />
the benefits of the principles of interdependence and<br />
openness. Over the next two decades we must continue<br />
to demonstrate that the best outcome for all economic<br />
regions is attained when we have strong global rules<br />
while maximising regional trade opportunities. </p>
