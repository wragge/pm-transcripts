    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />* EMBARGOED UNTIL 3: 00PM<br />STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />THE HON P J KEATING, NP<br />VISIT TO JAPAN, SINGAPORE AND CAMBODIA</p>
<p><br />Mr Speaker<br />I take this opportunity to inform the House of the<br />outcome of the visit I made to Japan, Singapore and<br />Cambodia between 20 and 26 September.<br />This overseas visit was my third since becoming Prime<br />Minister.-All three visits have been to Asia-Pacific countries.<br />All three visits have helped put a sharper focus on<br />Australia's relations with the region.<br />A primary objective of each visit has been to talk with<br />other regional leaders about how we can work together to<br />respond to the fluid outlook in the region.<br />But just as importantly, I have also wanted to underline<br />to both Australian and foreign audiences how much the<br />Australian economy has shifted towards an international<br />orientation, especially an Asia-Pacific orientation; how<br />much Australia has already achieved in the region; and<br />how much our future depends on successfully carrying<br />forward this engagement.<br />More than is sometimes appreciated, the Asia-Pacific<br />region is in the midst of a period of profound<br />transition. The strategic consequences of the end of the Cold War are<br />still working themselves out.<br />The regional security outlook is generally favourable,<br />but less prodictabla than before.<br />The peace process in Cambodia, which involves an<br />ambitious role for the United Nations, confronts a<br />serious test of Its sustainability.</p>
<p>Fluidity in the international trading environment is<br />increased by uncertainty about the outcome of the Uruguay<br />Round. Whatever the outcome of the Round, we shall probably see<br />an increasing trend towards regional, subregional, and<br />bilateral trade arrangements.<br />Regional governments are now required to develop policy<br />responses to what could well be a rapidly evolving<br />pattern of trade alignments.<br />Asia-Pacific countries also need to consider how<br />international and regional institutions can better<br />reflect the growing weight of the region in world<br />affairs, and the increasing importance of intra-regional<br />linkages.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My visit to Japan was very worthwhile in consolidating<br />with the Japanese Government the strong community of<br />interest we have with them in responding to these<br />important questions.<br />The Australian public understands very well Japan's<br />significance in our external relations.<br />Japan is the world's second largest national economy,<br />accounting for about 14 per cent of global output.<br />It has been our largest trading partner since 1970.<br />Perhaps more than is generally appreciated in this<br />country, Australia is also an important regional partner<br />of Japan.<br />We are Japan's third largest source of imports and sixth<br />largest trading partner.<br />The bilateral trade relationship, now worth around 24<br />billion Australian dollars, is one of the principal<br />sinews of economic interdependence in the Western<br />Pacific. The close dialogue between the two governments on<br />regional and international issues reflects the habit of<br />friendship and cooperation that has grown up between the<br />two countries in recent years.<br />Certainly, the warmth of my reception by the Japanese<br />Government and the quality of my discussions withPrime<br />Minister Miyazawa and his Ministers attest to the<br />maturity of the relationship that we now enjoy with<br />Japan. The comments of Mr Miyazawa and his ministers reflected,<br />I think, a realistic view of the international scene.</p>
<p>There was cautious optimism that the Japanese economy<br />would return to a stronger growth path from the end of<br />this year.<br />There was a determination, which I supported, that Japan<br />should play a more active role in international affairs.<br />I affirmed Australian support for Japan's permanent<br />membership of the United Nations Security Council so that<br />the world body can better reflect changed world<br />circumstances. I welcomed Japan's decision to participate in United<br />Nations peacekeeping operations, and the opportunity this<br />provides for our military and civilian personnel to work<br />together in support of the Cambodia peace process.<br />Mr Speaker<br />I discussed international and bilateral trade issues with<br />both Prime Minister Miyazawa and International Trade and<br />industry Minister Watanabe.<br />They acknowledged an uneasiness in Japanese political and<br />business circles about the increasing trend to<br />preferential trade arrangements.<br />Prime Minister Miyazawa expressed the personal view that<br />an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading<br />system could be maintained despite these developments.<br />He made clear his government's deep commitment to a<br />cooperative relationship with the United States, and its<br />support for an early and successful outcome of the<br />Uruguay Round.<br />In underlining the importance of the bilateral trade<br />relationship with MITI Minister Watanabe, I said that<br />Australia would not be party to any trade arrangement<br />which was directed against Japan.<br />This commitment was reciprocated by his assurance that<br />Japan would conduct its trade on a commercial basis<br />without discrimination against Australia's interests in<br />any arrangements with third countries.<br />He reiterated this undertaking in the particular case of<br />Australia's exports of automobile-parts to Japan.<br />in discussing the outlook for the Uruguay Round, I urged<br />Japan not to hold back on the rice tariffication issue,<br />because otherwise it ran the risk of being portrayed by<br />others as a final obstacle to a settlement on<br />agriculture. The Japanese Government acknowledged the responsibility<br />it faced.</p>
<p>My discussions with Japanese Ministers also covered the<br />need for expanded bilateral air services to cater for the<br />expected increasei in-tourist traffic, MITI's support for<br />Australia's trade promotion in Japanese regional centres,<br />and Japanese involvement in the MFP project in Adelaide.<br />In a general discussion of defence relations, I confirmed<br />the Government's satisfaction with the cuirent moderate<br />level of activity which includes high-level visits and<br />dialogue on strategic issues.<br />Mr Speaker<br />The Government attaches considerable importance to the<br />Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC process as an<br />essential mechanism for promotiing open regionalism.<br />I explained to Prime Minister Miyazawa the thinking<br />behind my proposal for establishing over the medium term<br />a process for periodic heads-of-government meetings based<br />on APEC membership.<br />Such meetings would add political weight and status to<br />the APEC process.<br />They would fill a significant gap in institutional<br />arrangements in the region, enabling leaders to consult<br />together in a way which has become familiar in European<br />and trans-Atlantic relations.<br />I was encouraged by a mark~ ed firming of Japanese support<br />for the proposal.<br />Prime Minister Miyazawa welcomed the initiative and<br />agreed that the idea should be pursued further in<br />consultation with other members of the region.<br />Former Prime Minister Takeshita also firmly supported the<br />proposal. A special feature of the visit was my agreement with<br />Prime Minister Miyazawa to issue a joint statement<br />setting out for the public record an account of the<br />regional perspectives which figured prominently in our<br />discussions. The statement demonstrates convincingly the extent of<br />parallel interests* ve share with Japan in regional<br />strategic and economic issues, and the potential we have<br />for working together productively in the region.<br />It also makes clear that the cooperative relationship we<br />aim to pursue with Japan is by no means an exclusive one.<br />Rather, it is directed towards broad-based cooperation<br />with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region,<br />including especially the United States.</p>
<p>I now table the joint statement for reference by<br />Honourable Members.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My program in__ Tokyo included an audience with the Emperor<br />and Empress of Japan.<br />On behalf of the Australian Government, I invited Their<br />Majesties to visit Australia whenever mutually agreeable<br />to the two governments.<br />The invitation was warmly received, but because of prior<br />consideration of other possible overseas visits, it may<br />be some time before the visit takes place.<br />I am sure that an of ficial visit to Australia by the<br />Emperor and Empress will be welcomed by the vast majority<br />of Australians.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My visit to Japan included substantial contact with<br />senior Japanese business and financial leaders, and with<br />the Japanese media.<br />I impressed on these audiences the progress that has been<br />achieved in making the Australian economy more<br />competitive and internationally oriented, and the<br />commitment of the Australian Government, private sector<br />and wider community to strengthening Australia's<br />relations with the Asia-Pacific region.<br />These contacts were very useful in registering with<br />Japanese opinion-leaders the changing nature and focus of<br />Australia. Following my program in Tokyo, I made the first visit by<br />an Australian Prime Minister to Nag~~, Jpnsfut<br />largest city and the centre of a-large industrial and<br />trading region.<br />I took part in public ceremonies to mark the opening of<br />an Australian Consulate in Nagoya.<br />This is one of four new consulates we are opening this<br />year in Japan to strengthen our trade promotion in<br />regional centres.<br />I also visited the headquarters of theToyota Corporation<br />and inspected technologically advanced production<br />processes at their Notomachi plant, which will serve as<br />the parent plant for the new Toyota factory at Altona in<br />Victoria.</p>
<p>In his welcoming address at a lunch given in my honour,<br />the Troyota President said his corporation's investment at<br />Altona was predicated on the Australian Government's car<br />industry policy persisting into the 21st century, and<br />that consistent government policy and harmonious labour<br />relations were always important to the car industry.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My visit to Singapore on 24 and 25 September reinforced<br />the longstanding partnership between our two countries.<br />Singapore is Australia's fourth largest export market,<br />and our largest trading partner among the ASEAN<br />countries. Australia and Singapore maintain close defence relations<br />both bilaterally and under the Five Power Defence<br />Arrangements, which also involve Malaysia, Britain and<br />New Zealand.<br />my reception in Singapore was very warm.<br />I had extensive discussions with Prime Minister Goh Chok<br />Tlong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Deputy Prime Minister<br />and Trade and Industry Minister Brigadier-General Lee<br />Hsien Loong, and Defence Minister Yeo Ning Hong.<br />Prime Minister Goh said our bilateral relationship was<br />in excellent shape and that Australia and Singapore were<br />following similar strategies in the region.<br />He welcomed Australia's efforts to engage more closely<br />with Asia.<br />My discussions with Singapore leaders confirmed a broad<br />range of agreement on regional issues including the need<br />to maintain an open trading system and support for<br />promoting the APEC process.<br />I congratulated the Singapore Government on their<br />successful bid to host the APEC secretariat.<br />A major feature of my program in Singapore was<br />participation in a very successful business seminar on<br />the theme of strategic linkages between Singapore and<br />Australian companies.<br />The -seminar was well attended by sernior business<br />representatives from both sides, including 28 very senior<br />Australian business leaders who visited Singapore<br />especially for the occasion.<br />It provided an excellent opportunity for me and the<br />Australian business people to explain the important ways<br />in which the Australian economy is becoming more open and<br />commercially integrated into the region.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Defence Minister Yeo, I visited HMAS<br />Brisbane, one of eight Australian ships which had Just<br />participated in a large-scale maritime and air defence<br />exercise under the Five Power Defence Arranaeents.<br />The Singapore Government made clear the value it places<br />on defence cooperation with Australia including our<br />active role in the Five-Power Arrangements.<br />Mr Speaker<br />My visit to Cambodia on 26 September was the first by an<br />Australian Prime Minister since 1966, the first by a<br />Western head of government since 1970, and the first by<br />any head of government since the signing of the Paris<br />Peace Accords in October last year.<br />My brief visit served two important purposes.<br />I was able to underline Australia's firm support for the<br />peace process at a time when serious difficulties have<br />been caused by the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to<br />participate in the cantonment and demobilisation phase.<br />I was also able to reaffirm the Government's warm<br />appreciation of the efforts of the Australian military<br />and civilian personnel serving with the United Nationa<br />Transitional Authority in Cambodia, and of the important<br />contribution by Australian aid workers serving with nongovernment<br />organisat ions.<br />Other Members of the House have visited Cambodia since<br />the signing of the peace settlement.<br />I know they will support me in saying that all these<br />dedicated and professional men and women are earning a<br />high reputation for Australia in Cambodia.<br />Australia can be truly proud of their contribution<br />towards peace and a better way of life for the Cambodian<br />people. I had detailed discussions with Prince Sihanouk, the UN<br />Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Akashi,<br />and the UN'TAC Military Commander, Lieutenant-Cene-ral<br />Sanderson. Without underestimating the complexity and difficulty of<br />problems-which lie ahead, I-was heartened by the<br />determination of these key individuals to press ahead<br />with UN-organised elections by around May next year, with<br />or without participation by the Khmer Rouge.<br />I assured tinm that Australia remained firm in our<br />commitment to support a peace process whose outcome is a<br />democratically elected government which can be recognised<br />and supported by the international community.</p>
<p>I said Australia wants to persevere so long as there is a<br />responsible way forward.<br />Mr Speaker<br />I am confident that my visit to Japan, Singapore and<br />Cambodia has put Australia in a better position to deal<br />with the challenges we face in the region.<br />I was pleased that my visit to Japan and Singapore<br />generated considerable public comment about Australia's<br />trade policy options.<br />These are crucial issues for our country.<br />It is important that Parliament and the public have a<br />clear understanding of where our national interest lies.<br />In recognition of Australia's position as a medium-sized<br />trading nation with considerable diversity in the<br />composition and direction of our trade, the Government<br />attaches fundamental importance to maintaining and<br />strengthening the open, non-discriminatory multilateral<br />trading system based on the GATT.<br />As part of this, we accord high priority to an early and<br />successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of<br />multilateral trade negotiations.<br />The benefits of a multilateral agreement, which extends<br />international trade rules to cover agriculture and<br />services and which also strengthens the disciplines and<br />dispute-settling procedures of GATT, are so overwhelming<br />for a country like Australia that there is no need for me<br />to describe them to this House.<br />we are also firmly committed to promote the development<br />of APEC as an organisation which embraces the main<br />economic linkages between the Western Pacific and North<br />America. And we also remain willing to seize trade opportunities<br />and solve trade problems whenever and wherever they<br />arise, whether bilaterally or plurilaterally, whether in<br />a particular class of exports or with a particular<br />country or group of countries.<br />This kind of work is so constant and so detailed, so<br />ordinary And'unspectacular a part of the everyday work of<br />our trade officials and of the Trade Minister that we<br />sometimes forget quite how much goes on.<br />These three tasks the GATT, APVC, and the everyday work<br />of facilitating trade remain at the core of our trade<br />policy.</p>
<p>But as we enter this new era of uncertainty in the<br />direction of the world trading system and in the<br />strategic decisions of the major trading economies, I<br />wish to describe the Government's approach in deciding<br />emerging trade policy issues.<br />Mr Speaker<br />For better or worse, the Uruguay Round is coming to an<br />end. Whatever the outcome, this will free the energies of<br />trade policy makers and make clear the internationally<br />agreed benchmarks upon which bilateral. and regional trade<br />enhancement can be created.<br />If the Round fails, there will remain a vast agenda of<br />reform in agriculture and services trade which should be<br />addressed by some other means.<br />Even if the Round succeeds in one form or another, there<br />will remain plenty of room for further agreements which<br />improve on its outcomes.<br />As I said at the beginning of this statement, the trend<br />towards regional, subregional and bilateral trade<br />arrangements will probably strengthen.<br />The European Community will certainly spread eastwards,<br />even if there is now soma doubt about the pace of<br />deepening integration between the existing members.<br />NAFTA has now been signed by the governments of Canada,<br />the United States and Mexico, and we expect that in one<br />form or another it will be approved by the US Congress<br />next year.<br />We expect further links will be established between the<br />United States and various Latin American countries.<br />In our own region, APEC has been institutionalised with<br />the creation of a secretariat in Singapore, while the<br />ASEAN countries are now moving to establish their own<br />free trade agreement.<br />There is plenty of evidence of increased regionalism in<br />trade institutions.<br />There is also evidence of increased regionalism in trade<br />patterns. Between 1970 and 1991 trade between West European<br />countries grew from 66 to 72 per cent of their total<br />trade, and that between the APEC countries grew from 54<br />to 65 per cent of their total.</p>
<p>So the end of the Uruguay Round is coming at the same<br />time as Australia is changing profoundly, as regionalism<br />becomes more important and also at a time of new<br />uncertainty over the trade strategy of the world's<br />biggest economy, the United States.<br />Mr Speaker<br />In his recent Detroit speech, President Bush raised the<br />possibility of negotiating trade arrangements with<br />individual countries, incl~ uding some in Eastern Europe<br />and some in the Pacific.<br />In the Pacific he instanced Australia, the ASEAN<br />countries and K~ orea.<br />No formal proposal has been put to Australia, but the<br />issue is of such importance to our trading future that we<br />cannot wait its full development before we make our own<br />views known.<br />Our overriding objective is to do all we can to preserve<br />and enhance a trading environment in which our major<br />markets remain as open to us as possible, and these<br />markets remain open to each other.<br />We must never lose sight of the fact that most of our<br />trade, and the fastest growing part of our trade, is now<br />with other countries in the Western Pacific.<br />We must also not lose sight of the fact that many of<br />these countries are highly dependent on the US market.<br />And finally we must not lose sight of the fact that many<br />of our trade partners are also our trade competitors in<br />third-country markets.<br />Those considerations will guide us in what may well be a<br />fluid and fast-changing external environment over the<br />next few years.<br />As to the institutional forms and arrangements into which<br />we may be prepared to enter, we are open mninded.<br />We certainly do not rule out bilateral agreements, or<br />plurilateral agreements.<br />Indeed, we may well initiate them, and we are of course a<br />member* of a* strong bilateral arrangiement with New<br />Zealand. But some bilateral agreements are better than others, and<br />some may deliver few bilateral trade benefits while<br />potentially incurring substantial trade costs.<br />The Government welcomed President Bush's Detroit speech<br />in the sense that it demonstrated an interest in further<br />promoting trade liberalisation in the Pacific area.</p>
<p>The Opposition made an enthusiastic embrace of a<br />preferential bilateral agreement with the United States<br />despite having a week earlier labelled the United States<br />as Australia's number one trade enemy.<br />The Government's approach is more calibrated.<br />We have reservations about the specific mechanism of a<br />network of bil~ ateral preferential trade agreements<br />centred on the United States.<br />Mr Speaker<br />The difficulty for Australia works at several levels.<br />First, the Government would want to consider seriously<br />any offer of a bilateral agreement with the United States<br />which would reduce import constraints on those items of<br />most concern to us particularly beef, dairy products,<br />sugar and steel.<br />But past experience suggests that such concessions would<br />be unlikely because of Congressional attitudes and other<br />domestic pressures in the United Statas.<br />Secondly, the perception in East Asia of any move by<br />Australia and the United States to conclude a bilateral<br />trade agreement would vary greatly depending on whether<br />it was seen as part of a broader, even-handed approach<br />throughout the region, or whether it was seen as part of<br />a strategy to put pressure on the North Asian economies,<br />particularly Japan.<br />In the latter case, Australia would be seen as turning<br />our back on East Asia despite the fact that it accounts<br />for almost six times more of our exports than the United<br />States. Thirdly, while we can understand why some Americans<br />advocate bilateral trade arrangements on a hub-and-spokes<br />model as a way of improving US trade access, the<br />countries at the ends of the spokes may find that this<br />approach does not help trade between them.<br />A report on regional trade agreements prepared for the<br />Government earlier this year by Professor Richard Snape<br />and others argues convincingly that a hub-and-spokes<br />system is a-relatively unattractive option for trade<br />liberalisation. Those considerations were reflected in my statements in<br />Tokyo about trade policy.<br />As mentioned already, I told the Japanese Government that<br />Australia would not be party to a trade arrangement which<br />was directed against Japan.</p>
<p>12<br />This commitment reflects a clear-sighted view of<br />Australia's national interest.<br />Mr Speaker<br />It goes without saying that the Government attaches great<br />weight to our relationship with the United States.<br />Australia and all other trading nations have benefited<br />enormously over the years from the enlightened leadership<br />the United States has demonstrated in helping to maintain<br />an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading<br />ByB tern.<br />The Australia-US defence alliance remains of fundamental<br />importance in the post-Cold War period.<br />Our bilateral economic relations are of grAat value to<br />both sides.<br />As made clear in the joint statement issued with Japan,<br />the Government believes that US strategic and economic<br />engagement is of fundamental importance to the peace and<br />prosperity of the Western Pacific.<br />For this very reason we have promoted the APEC concept<br />which embraces both the Western Pacific and the United<br />States, and have queried other regional concepts which<br />omit the United States.<br />An important objective of Australian policy is to avoid<br />so far as we can situations where we have to choose<br />between relations with the United States and relations<br />with East Asia. I<br />We also want to do whatever we can to encourage<br />cooperative relations between the two.<br />Mr Speaker<br />The Government certainly does not rule out Australian<br />membership of regional trading arrangements.<br />APEC is already evolving into a regional trade<br />arrangement with a useful agenda of trade-liberalising<br />measures. If thinking and practice in the region evolves towards<br />the idea -of a -trade pact, -we would very much prefer that<br />it be APEC wide, and of course that it did not raise<br />barrierg or hinder trade between members and nonmembers.<br />we appreciate that such an outcome will not be achieved<br />easily and that, in the meantime, there may be proposals<br />for plurilateral arrangements between subsets of the APEC<br />membership.</p>
<p>133<br />Australia stands ready to consider on its merits possible<br />membership of any such arrangements that may evolve.<br />As I said in Tokyo, we do not think a Western Pacific<br />trade area is a preferred arrangement, but we would<br />certainly seek to join one if the trade policy decisions<br />of the major players left us no better choice.<br />So we remain open to forms and arrangements, but we do<br />think there are substantial disadvantages for ourselves<br />and for the entire region if the United States is<br />encouraged to go down the path of seeking bilateral<br />preferential arrangements.<br />Finally, an important principle which will guide<br />Australian policy is that we very much want to avoid<br />being party to a process which has the effect of dividing<br />the Pacific into trade allies of the United States and<br />trade allies of Japan.<br />Mr Speaker<br />Working forward from the understandings reached during my<br />recent Asian visit, these are the sorts of considerations<br />that need to be weighed carefully in defining new<br />Australian positions in this important policy area.<br />CANBERRA 13 October 1992</p>
