11eads of Government reaffirmed the value they attch -to<br />
thcse meetings and expressed satisfaction with the constructive<br />
approach and mutual confidence of their deliber:-tions. They<br />
notod with approval the incroasing use being made of Commonwealth<br />
machincry to further the principles of the Coimnonwealth Dciaration<br />
and to promote consultation, co-operation and collaborativa a<br />
action across and within regions. S3uch consultation formed an<br />
important part of the contribution Commonwealth countries mia,~ e<br />
to the development of a new pattern of international relations<br />
which takes account of the significant shifts in political and<br />
economic power. heads of Government urged that the Commonwrealth<br />
initiatives already taken to this end should be intensified so<br />
as to promote peace and security, economic and social justice<br />
and harmony among races. </p>
<p>2.<br />
6. The reduction of continuing unacceptable economic disparities,<br />
the shifting balance of political and economic power, and<br />
colonialism and racialism in Southern Africa, were the main preoccupations<br />
of Heads of Government in their discussions.<br />
7. Heads of Government recalled the statement in the<br />
Declaration of Commonwealth principles: " We believe that the wide<br />
disparities in wealth now existing between different sections of<br />
mankind are too great to be tolerated", and pledged themselves to<br />
do all in their power to promote a new and equitable economic order.<br />
World and Commonwealth Trends<br />
8. Heads of Government reviewed political developments in the<br />
world which had occurred since they last met, in the light of the<br />
varied interests and concerns of member countries. They acknowledged<br />
the contribution of the spirit of detente to a measure of<br />
relaxation in international tensions and called for its universal<br />
application. They noted, however, that there were some crisis<br />
areas in the world where peace and stability were not yet secured<br />
and which were still subject to super power rivalary and interference.<br />
They stressed that the maintenance of peace ans stability<br />
could not be left to arrangements between the super powers but was<br />
the responsibility to the entire international community. Heads of<br />
Government laid particular emphasis on the opportunities for the<br />
Commonwealth to make a constructive contribution to the problems of<br />
Southern Afica and underlined the special responsibility of Commrronwealth<br />
member countries to work together in the search for a<br />
resolution of the situation in Rhodesia.<br />
Disarmament 9. Heads of Government expressed their concern at the continued<br />
testing and proliferation of nuclear weapons and reaffirmed<br />
the need for urgent measures to facilitate a comurehensive ban on<br />
all nuclear weapons tests as one essential step towards general and<br />
complete disarmament under effective international control,<br />
Cyprus Heads of Government, deeply concerned over the continuation<br />
of the Cyprus crisis, expressed their solidarity with the Government<br />
of the Republic of Cyprus and their determination to help in the<br />
achievement of a political settlement based on the independence,<br />
sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic<br />
of Cyprus. They reaffirmed their support for the General Assembly<br />
Resolution 3212 ( XXIX) and Secruity Council's Resolutions 365 ( 1974)<br />
and 367 ( 1975) and in particular they called for the speedy withdrawal<br />
of all foreign armed forces from the Republic of Cyprus,<br />
for the taking of urgent measures for the return of all the refugees<br />
to their homes in safety'and for the continued efforts through the </p>
<p>intercommunal talks to reach freely and mutually acceptable political<br />
settlement. They note the spirit of goodwill with which the<br />
Government of Cyprus approached the resumption of the intercommnunal<br />
talks under the personal auspices and direction of the Secretary-<br />
General of the United Nations and expressed the hope that these<br />
would be fruitful.<br />
11. heads of Government, as a concrete expression of their<br />
interest and concern for a fellow Commonwealth country, agreed to<br />
establish a Committee consisting of representatives of the Governments<br />
of Australia, Britain, Guyana, India, Kenya, Mal~ ta, Nigeria<br />
and Zambia to meet with the Commonwealth Secretary-General as early<br />
as possible, to follow developments concerning Cyprus, make recommendations<br />
and assist in every possible way towards the early<br />
implementation of the above-mentioned United b~ ations resolutions.<br />
Viddle L~ ast<br />
12. Heads of Government expressed concern at the renewed<br />
danger of conflict in the Iliddle East. They re-emphasised the<br />
need for the establishment of a durable peace in the area as a<br />
matter of urgency and urged all parties to renew their efforts to<br />
achieve this objective. To this end heads of Government affirmed<br />
their support for the relevant United hations Resolutions on the<br />
N'iddle. East and their belief that to ensure success it was necessary<br />
that the authentic and legitimate representatives of the<br />
Palestinian people participate in the forthcoming peace negotiations<br />
in Geneva.<br />
Indian Ocean<br />
13. Noting that the Indian Ocean was a region of special<br />
interest to a significant number of Commonwealth countries, heads<br />
of Government re-affirmed the desirability of ensuring that it<br />
remasin an area of peace and stabiity. Serious concern was<br />
expressed abou~ t the increase in naval activity in the Indian Ocean Aron<br />
the part of the great poweis and the establishment and expansion<br />
there of military installations. heads of Government called<br />
upon all nations, and particularly the great powers most directly<br />
concerned, to work towards the implementation of the Resolutions<br />
of the United Nations declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.<br />
South Asia<br />
14. The Heads of Government noted that positive steps had<br />
been taken in the process of norralisation among the countries of<br />
the South Asian sub-continent. However, they expressed their grave<br />
concern at the impediment to normalisation of relations posed by<br />
certain outstanding problems resulting in the aggravation of<br />
economic hardship and the retardation of the process of national<br />
reconstruction in Bangladesh. These problems include the repatriation<br />
of nationals and the sharing of assets. Heads of Government </p>
<p>expressed the hope that the problems will be resolved expeditiously<br />
and satisfactorily through discussions among the countries concerned<br />
in the larger interest of peace and stability in the region<br />
Indo-China Heads of Government welcomed the end of the prolonged war<br />
in Indo-China, urged countries in a position to do so to contribute<br />
to international assistance for the urgent tasks of rehabilitation<br />
and reconstruction and looked forward to the new governments of the<br />
region playing their full part in the community of nations.<br />
The Caribbean<br />
16. Heads of Government strongly reaffirmed the right of<br />
people in each country to choose the form of government which they<br />
considered best able to achieve their social, economic and political<br />
goals. Belize Heads of Government offered their full support for the<br />
aspirations of the people of Belize for early independence. Noting<br />
that talks had recently been resumed with Guatemala, and bearing in<br />
mind the special responsibilities of Britain as the administering<br />
power, Heads of Government urged the parties to take all necessary<br />
action for a speedy solution of the problem, which could be endorsed<br />
by the international community through the United Nations, in<br />
accordance with the principle of the self-determination of peoples<br />
as enshrined in the charter of the United Nations.<br />
Cuba Heads of Government expressed the hope that all countries<br />
would now normalise their relations with Cuba and respect the<br />
sovereignty and territorial integrity of that state and the right<br />
of its people to the government of their choice.<br />
Southern Africa<br />
17. Heads of Government had a thorough and constructive<br />
discussion of the changing situation in Southern Africa and its<br />
implications for the Commonwealth. They considered that the imminent<br />
independence of Mozambique and Angola had radically altered the<br />
blance of forces in the area and tributes were paid to the liberation<br />
movements who had contributed so decisively to this result.<br />
18. Heads of Government re-emphasized that the objective for<br />
Rhodesia was independence on the basis of majority rule. They<br />
welcomed the initiatives taken by the IHeads of Government of<br />
Botawana, Tanzania and Zambia and the President of Frelimo to<br />
achieve this objectibe by peaceful means if possible. The Heads of<br />
Government, meeting informally, heard a statement by Bishop Muzorewa, </p>
<p>President of the African National Council. The meeting noted that<br />
the nationalist movement now united in the African National Council<br />
was seeking with sincerity and determination the basis for an agreed<br />
settlement. 19. Heads of Government reaffirmed their total support for<br />
the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for independence on the basis<br />
of majority rule and pledged to concert their efforts for the speedy<br />
attainment of this objective. They took note of the determination<br />
of the African freedom fighters, supported by African and other<br />
states, to achieve their objective by peaceful means if possible<br />
and recognised the inevitability of intensified armed struggle<br />
should peaceful avenues be blocked by the racist and illegal regime.<br />
The moral responsibilities in those circumstances would lie with<br />
the minority government and those who had chosen to sustain it.<br />
The meeting noted that South Africa continues to support<br />
the rebel government by affording it the military and economic<br />
assistance on which its survival depends and reaffirmed their view<br />
that South Africa should fulfil its international obligations and<br />
strictly apply the United Nations mandatory sanctions and withdraw<br />
its forces from Rhodesia.<br />
21. It was agreed that the prospects for a settlement would<br />
be greatly enhanced by the strict enforcement of sanctions by the<br />
international community as a whole. Heads of Government undertook<br />
to bring this consideration to the attention of governments outside<br />
the Commonwealth in renew. ed representations where a breach of<br />
sanctions was known to have occurred. They also agreed to take<br />
action at the international level for the reinforcement and extension<br />
of sanctions.<br />
22. In considering the recormmendations of the Commonwealth<br />
Sanctions Committee, and authorising the Committee to continue its<br />
work, Heads of Government emphasised the importance of taking<br />
immediate practical steps to assist and independent Mozambique in<br />
applying sanctions since the great bulk of Rhodesia's exports and<br />
imports is dependent on IMozambioue's transit facilities. They were<br />
unanimously in favour of providing immediate financial assistance<br />
to the new government of 1ozambioue. They also endorsed the<br />
recommendation that an initiative should be taken by Commonwealth<br />
Governments at the United Nations to establish a program of assistance<br />
for I:' ozambioue in terms of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter.<br />
23.. Heads of Government were deeply concerned that South Africa<br />
continues to occupy Namibia illegally in total disregard to the<br />
resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and the<br />
advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of June 1971,<br />
and in defiance of world opinion. Reaffirming that the fragmentation<br />
of Namibia was unacceptable, they recalled the obligation of<br />
the international community to maintain the territorial integrity<br />
of the territory and the right of its people to self-determination<br />
and indepedence. </p>
<p>24 The meeting looked forward to the time when the Government<br />
and people of Namibia might be welcomed into the Commonwealth, if<br />
that were their wish,<br />
Heads of Government reaffirmed their total and unequivocal<br />
condemnation of apartheid and all forms of racialism. They welcomed<br />
the British Government's decision to comply strictly with the United<br />
Nations embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa and to terminate<br />
the Simonstown Agreement. They condemned the violation of the<br />
embargo by those countries which continue to supply arms to South<br />
Africa or enable them to be manufactured in that country. Noting<br />
the alarming increase in South Africa's defence expenditure, I-eads<br />
of Government express their concern that this military build-up was<br />
bound to increase tension in an area already plagued by dangerous<br />
conflict. Heads of Government also agreed to maintain and intensify<br />
effective pressure on South Africa in the struggle for the elimination<br />
of apartheid.<br />
26. Heads of Government reiterated their support for humanitarian<br />
assistance to the indigenous people of Southern Africa in their<br />
efforts to achieve self-determination and independence. Several<br />
Heads of Government described their contributions to various bilateral<br />
and multilateral programs and indicated their intention to increase<br />
such assistance. The meeting also noted with approval the development<br />
of the special Commonwealth program for assisting the education<br />
of Rhodesian Africans and indicated their desire to expand this<br />
program to meet new and urgent needs. In particular, Heads of<br />
Government recognised the importance of extending the variety of<br />
education and training opportunities available to the people of<br />
Zimbabwe, with special emphasis on technical and industrial training,<br />
" in service" experience and administrative training It was<br />
also agreed that Commonwealth multilateral assistance should be made<br />
available to help in the developmental and training needs of the<br />
people of Namibia,.<br />
. CONOIC MATTEI S<br />
27. Commonwealth Heads of Government recognised the need to<br />
take immediate steps towards the creation of a rational and equitable<br />
new international economic order. They reaffirmed the statement<br />
included in the Commonwealth Declaration adopted in Singapore<br />
in 1971 that " the wide discarities of wealth now existing between<br />
different sections of mankind are too great to be tolerated.... our<br />
aim is their progressive removal", and acknowledged the complexity,<br />
range and inter-related nature of the issues involved. They agreed<br />
that a small group of experts should be invited to draw up for<br />
consideration by Commonwealth Governments, in the context of the<br />
current international dialogue, a comprehensive and. inter-related<br />
program of practic. l measures directed at closing the gap between<br />
the rich and the poor countries. These measures would be designed<br />
to promote development and to increase the transfer of real resources<br />
to developing countries inter alia in the areas of production, </p>
<p>distribution and exchange of primary and secondary products as<br />
well as services. Heads of Government recognised the importance<br />
in this context of co-operating to achieve an expanding world<br />
economy and world trade.<br />
28. The group of experts should be selected from the Commonwealth<br />
on the basis of their personal capacities and their expert<br />
knowledge of contemporary problems of international economic<br />
development, and should be assembled in a way which would enable the<br />
perspectives of different regions of the Commonwealth and different<br />
national development strategies to be brought to bear on the<br />
problems concerned.<br />
29. The group of experts should address itself to the issues<br />
and proposals elaborated in:<br />
I. The Declaration and the program of action on the establishment<br />
of a new international economic order as adopted by the United<br />
Nations General Assembly: and<br />
II. The relevant principles of the Commonwealth Declaration<br />
adopted in Singapore in 1971, and:<br />
IIT. The concepts and proposals advanced during the discussions<br />
of the international economic situation at the Kingston Ileeting<br />
heads of Government including the presentations by the Governments<br />
of Guyana on behalf of the Caribbean and the Government of Britain.<br />
In drawing up a program of practical measures the group<br />
should pay particular attention to:<br />
I, IMeasures to transfer real resources from developed to<br />
developing countries through international co-operation in the<br />
field of international trade in primary commodities with particular<br />
reference to the integrated commodities program recommended by the<br />
Secretary-General of UNCTAD, current proposals of buffer stocks,<br />
S for indexation, and other relevant proposals, including the proposal<br />
for a general agreement on commodities.<br />
II. Measures which the international community can introduce<br />
for assisting developing countries<br />
To increa. se food production:<br />
To promote rural development:<br />
To promote economic co-operation among themselves at the<br />
sub-regional, intra-regional and inter-regional levels:<br />
and A review of existing organisations for industrial co-operation<br />
and development.<br />
To obtain greater control over, and benefits from, such<br />
activities as shipping, insurance, banking and other<br />
parts of the infrastructure for international trade and<br />
development. </p>
<p>III. Programs for industrial development involving new and<br />
expanded forms of industrial co-operation, the enlargement of<br />
employment opportunities in developing countries, and more favourable<br />
access to the markets of developed countries:<br />
IV. A review of existing organisations for industrial cooperation<br />
and development:<br />
V. Mechanisms for increasing the flow of long-term development<br />
funds, the transfer of technology and the transfer of real<br />
resources to developing countries: and<br />
VI Reform and where necessary the restructuring of the<br />
international institutions concerned with the management of<br />
interrn-tional trade and finance, and whether means could be found<br />
to increase the effective share of the developing countries in the<br />
decision-making process of the major international financial<br />
institutions. In all of the above matters due regard would be paid to<br />
the special needs of the least developed, land-locked, the most<br />
seriously affected, and islaid developing states with limited<br />
natural resources<br />
31, In drawing up its recommendations the group of experts<br />
should consider the feasibility of utilising relevant concepts and<br />
mechanisms embodied in recent economic co-operation agreements<br />
between certain developed and developing countries.<br />
52. The group of experts should consist of not more than ten<br />
persons. 355 The members of the group should be appointed by the<br />
Secretary-General after consultation with member governments.<br />
54, The group should aim at submitting to governments an<br />
interim report on the results of its work indicating measures which<br />
are amenable to early and effective implementation in time to permit<br />
discussion of this report at the next meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Iiinisters and to enable governments to take this report into account<br />
before the Seventh Special Session of the General Assembly.<br />
It is expected that the group will endeavour to hold its<br />
first meeting by the end of IMay or early in June.<br />
36, It would be desirable that the Secretary-General elect<br />
should be associated at as early a stage as possible with the work<br />
of the group.<br />
37. Heads of Government appointed Mr Alister Mclntyre,<br />
Secretary-General of the Caribbean community, Chairman of the<br />
Expert Group. </p>
<p>Lome Convention<br />
38. Heads of Government welcomed the conclusion of the Lome<br />
Convention drawn up by the European Economic Community and fortysix<br />
countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They<br />
welcomed the increased co-operation within the Convention between<br />
Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries in these areas. They<br />
expressed the hope that the principles underlying the Lome Convention<br />
could usefully contribute to the further development of relations<br />
between the EEC and other industrialised countries, on the one hand,<br />
and developing countries, including the Asian and other Commonwealth<br />
countries, on the other.<br />
39. Heads of Government welcomed the valuable support which<br />
the Secretariat is giving to Commonwealth countries in the multilateral<br />
trade negotiations.<br />
Food Production and Rural Development<br />
Heads of Government discussed the Report of the Commonwealth<br />
Ninisterial Meeting on Food Production and Rural Development,<br />
held in London in March 1975. They welcomed the opportunity it<br />
had provided to consider in a Commonwealth setting the proble: ms<br />
of the three auarters of the population of Commonwealth developing<br />
countries who live in rural areas. Heads of Government endorsed<br />
the view that the problems of rural development and food production<br />
should be attacked in an integrated manner and should receive<br />
high priority from individual governments and aid agencies. They<br />
stressed the need for aid-providing agencies to adapt their practices<br />
and programs to meet the special needs of food production and rural<br />
cdevelopment, and endorsed the proposal to establish a food production<br />
and rural development division within the Secretariat. The new<br />
division would enhance the effectiveness of the Secretariat's<br />
already significant contribution to this sector and should be<br />
essentially action-oriented.<br />
41. Heads of Government emphasised the setback to agricultural<br />
production which has resulted from scarcity and high prices of<br />
fertilizer, and welcomed efforts, in the Commonwealth and elsewhere,<br />
to secure adequate supplied of fertilizer at reduced costs. They<br />
also called for similar efforts with respect to farm machinery, feed<br />
stuffs and other agricultural imputs.<br />
Drou ht and Other NIatural Disaster<br />
42. Heads of Government recognised the value of the Commno.-ealth<br />
as a forum in which to consult and concert broad strategies for<br />
action in the Sahelian Zone of Africa and in other natural disaster<br />
are-as and endorsed the recommendation of the r; inisterial Meeting<br />
on Food Production and lural Development that Commonwealth action<br />
should supplement action taken by world bodies. </p>
<p>Industrial Development Co-operation<br />
43. In underlining the importance of increasing agricultural<br />
production, Heads of Government stressed the parallel and related<br />
need to accelerate the development of industry and endorsed the<br />
expansion of industrial co-operation, particularly between Commonwealth<br />
countries, In this context, they stressed the need for<br />
measures to promote the processing of primary commodities in their<br />
places of origin and the removal of barriers to trade in processed<br />
primary commodities and other manufactured goods.<br />
44. Heads of Government stressed their ccnern to ensure that<br />
the activiti'es of multinational cororations conform with the<br />
policies of host governments and their goals for an equitable<br />
redistribution of wealth. They noted the work done on multinational<br />
corporations by the Commonwealth Secretariat and by bodies in the<br />
UN system. They agreed on the need for countries to build up their<br />
capabilities to deal with multinational corporations.<br />
Development Assistance<br />
Heads of Government affirmed the need for all countries<br />
with the capacity to do so, to maint. ain and, wherever possible,<br />
increase the flow of development assistance to developing countries,<br />
especially to the developing countries most seriously affected by<br />
recent econolmic developments. They should also promote the rapid<br />
industrialization of developing countries.<br />
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation<br />
46.. Heads of Government reaffirmed their conviction that<br />
mutual help and shared responsibility were essential elements in<br />
Cormmonwealth co-operation. They expressed satisfaction at the<br />
expansion of the Commonwealth Fund for technical co-operation in<br />
the four years since its establishment, noted with approval its<br />
flexibility and its capacity to respond quickly to the reguests of<br />
member countries and commented favourably on its successful management.,<br />
47. Recognising the need for the Fund's resources to keep pace<br />
with the expanding requirements of Commonwealth governments, Heads<br />
of Government noted with appreciation the steady growth in support<br />
for the Fund and welcomed the substantially increased pledges made<br />
by developed and developing member countries. They noted the<br />
intention expressed by a number of governments to increase their<br />
contribution and hoped that further increases would be forthcoming.<br />
Commonweealth Investment Bank<br />
48. Heads of Goverunent noted the studies organised by the<br />
Secretary-General at the request of the 1974 MIeeting of Commonwealth<br />
Finance Ministers, on the financial feasibility and the need for the<br />
services of a Commonwealth investment bank along the lines proposed </p>
<p>by a Commonwealth expert group. They concluded that a nuriber of<br />
issues still reouired discussion bef-ore the proposal could be put<br />
to governments ' or a final decis-) ion. They requested the Secretary-<br />
Genera~ l to convene a comm-Ittee of Corr,,. onvealth officials to prepare<br />
a detailed. and specific proposal., addressing itself to the unresolved<br />
is., sues w-. hich must be faced. if such an institution is to be set up,<br />
