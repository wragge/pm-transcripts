PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY VINCENT SMITH AND COLIN PARKS,<br />
RADIO STATION 2UE<br />
Tape begins as follows:<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
the IBM-Facom affair; the sacking of Senator Withers;<br />
persisent unemployment; reverses of some aspects of the<br />
Budget; difficulty in fulfilling the promise of a 2 percent<br />
fall in interest rates; your personal popularity in the<br />
polls hasn't been high and the polls have for a time indicated<br />
a Labor win in an election were it held now. Do you accept<br />
these as early and mid-time liabilities that will be forgotten<br />
or will disappear as the term progresses.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think your record of events through the course of this<br />
year also overlooked a number of other things: a very<br />
remarked success in reducing inflation; interest rates<br />
are coming down and it's worth noting, I think, that the<br />
precise works I used in relation to interest rates were<br />
that important interest rates " could", and that was the<br />
word, " could", come down by as much as 2 percent. Now,<br />
some interest rates have come down by nearly as much<br />
as 2 percent. Not quite, by nearly as much.<br />
Housing rates by the end of this week I expect will have<br />
come down pretty generally by about 1 percent and that's,<br />
one can say, not as much as one would have liked. But at<br />
the same time, of very substantial benefit to home owners;<br />
about $ 17 a month off the re-payments of an average loan<br />
and $ 5,000 off the total period of the loan for an<br />
average loan.<br />
Continued success in getting inflation down: Australian<br />
industry is starting to get on its feet get out and<br />
compete in export markets. So, in politics I suppose there<br />
are often rough patches and difficult circumstances. It would<br />
seem to me that you've just put all the ' roughies' together<br />
and had not paid attention to one or two other things.<br />
Question I di d that because I wanted to ask you whether you looked<br />
forward to a better 1979.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'm quite certain the Government's policies, economic policies,<br />
are working and also quite certain that Australian industry<br />
is becoming more competitive, that it will get a larger share<br />
of our own markets and I look forward to the future 1979, the<br />
1980' s and the decade of the 80' s with an enormous degree<br />
of optimism. I believe that is shared by a number of the States<br />
and the State Premiers and that's judging from the unanimous<br />
view of all us at the last Loan Council a Meeting when major<br />
developmental works were supported in a new way by the<br />
Commonwealth and the States acting together. A gain, I think,<br />
all pointing to an optimistic and prosperous period in the 1980' s.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Colin Parks<br />
Could I look to January/ February of next year. Tony Street<br />
says that unemployment will reach a new peak then. Will that<br />
be the highest peak that unemployment will go in this term of<br />
your Government's office. In other words, will unemployment<br />
drop from January/ February next year, or could it in fact<br />
rise the following year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know whether that will be the highest peak or not.<br />
A great deal depends upon what happens in wage claims and<br />
we've got significant decisions before us at the moment.<br />
But what I can say is that a number of industries are now<br />
starting to employ more people. That's not uniform. There<br />
are other areas where that is not the case. In the motor<br />
industry, for example, one major manufacturer, by next March<br />
or April as I understand it, will have put on about 2,000<br />
people over the twelve months leading up to that. These are<br />
the sorts of signs of optimism. It is my understanding also<br />
that the BHP order book over the last six months is quite<br />
significantly better than for a long while. Now that is for<br />
domestic market domestic steel and that spreads out into<br />
a lot of industries. We just have to face the facts of life.<br />
There is only one way in which we can get this country really<br />
where we would all want it and that's by having Australian<br />
industry competitive; being able to sell in our own markets<br />
profitably, and having people being able to sell overseas.<br />
Colin Parks<br />
Is one of these facts of life unemployment reaching half a<br />
million early next year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'm not going to put a figure on it. It depends upon a number<br />
of factors: the fall in the ABS figures for the last month<br />
was better than I think many people had thought a<br />
fall of 17,000. The ABS series haven't been going for all that<br />
long and therefore I don't read more into it that just state<br />
the fact it fell 17,000 in one month. I noticed in a report<br />
I think this morning, very substantial fall in unemployment<br />
in Britian, 37,000, but in relation to the size of our economy<br />
a fall of 17,000 in one month in Australia would be bigger than<br />
the British fall. There are again seasonal factors that would<br />
have to be taken into account to get a completely valid comparison.<br />
Employment is obviously a matter that is one of continuing<br />
concern to us, as it is to countries right around the world.<br />
Much more could be done about it if there was a wider recognition<br />
of the factors that led to unemployment. But it basically gets<br />
back to the competitive basis of Australian industry,; the<br />
capacity of people to provide jobs of a real kind that add to<br />
the productive strength of this nation.<br />
Question Ian Viner announced on your behalf this morning, Prime Minister,<br />
that the Government would legislate to allow public servants<br />
to opt out at 55 with reduced benefits. What practical effect<br />
do you see that having on unemployment? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
This is one of the measures that we have introduced at<br />
this time because, clearly to the extent that people do that,<br />
it will open up additional employment opportunities for<br />
juniors, for young people, who might want to enter the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service. That's quite specifically why we<br />
chose this time to introduce this measure.<br />
Colin Parks<br />
How would you expect the unions to react, given that you are<br />
going to also allow forced retirement where people can't be<br />
put into new jobs?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, management initiated; this is something that has been<br />
in negotiation with the union movement for a very long while<br />
and my understanding is that there is general agreement with<br />
the package that if there is going to be the question of<br />
voluntary retirement at the age of 55, you also need the<br />
question of management initiated retirement under appropriate<br />
circumstances. The purpose of that, of course, is the enable<br />
the Public Service to operate as efficiently and as well as<br />
possible.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
You mentioned earlier that inflation has been coming down,<br />
and I don't think anybody would deny the Government the credit<br />
for bringing it down to the level it is at at the moment.<br />
It hasn't moved, as measured by the CPI, for the last two<br />
quarters and December isn't likely to show much of an improvement<br />
either. At the same time you've got rising unemployment,<br />
the capital inflow isn't coming as fast as you would like it<br />
to come. How long can we wait poised in this very delicate<br />
way, on the brink of recovery or disaster before you may decide<br />
to change course?<br />
Prime minister<br />
We are not going to decide to change course because no other<br />
course is possible. Capital inflow in the last few months,<br />
compared to the same period last year, has demonstrated a very<br />
marked turn around a very significant turn around indeed<br />
and while you might say capital inflow is not as much as one<br />
would like it is certainly very much greater than in the same<br />
period last year, again reflecting the improvement in our<br />
inflation rate compared with that in a number of overseas<br />
countries. One of the things that's the hardest thing to<br />
sometimes get across is that there is no easy solution to the<br />
problem of unemployment. It is very easy for politicians<br />
to say they are going to do things which some people will believe<br />
will help unemployment. It's very easy for politicians to<br />
promise to spend more money, to undertake more works and to<br />
do it in an utterly irresponsible way while they themselves know<br />
the relief, to the extent that there is any, will be very shortlived<br />
and merely herald in a new and increased period of<br />
inflation. 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
I think that is a very callous view approach to<br />
political life to offer a short-term palliative that<br />
you know isn't going to succeed, that you know is going to<br />
make the Australian economic circumstances worse; will lead<br />
to more industries being in difficulty because of increased<br />
inflation. I believe that my Government shows much much<br />
more concern for the unemployed by being prepared to stay<br />
with policies which we know over time will work.<br />
-, Vincent Smith<br />
Would you agree that perhaps you have in fact slightly changed<br />
course by offering mild stimulation to the economy--the<br />
simulation that is inherent in the big loan raisings authorised<br />
to the States in that you are now chasing up that mild<br />
stimulation psychologically by talking up the economy?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's not a question of talking up. It's a question about talking<br />
about the facts of life and the capital inflow that has been<br />
occuring over recent months; reduced rate of inflation, reduced<br />
housing interest, rates and other interest rates coming down.<br />
These are facts of life. Also, I think it is worth noting<br />
that the infrastructure proposals that came to the point of<br />
decision two or three weeks ago with all the Premiers in<br />
unanimous agreement with the Commonwealth has resulted in two<br />
years very close and detailed discussion between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States. Nobody should have been surprised at that<br />
decision. It's something which we agreed in Loan Councils about<br />
two years ago to examine. Last June at the Loan Council we<br />
agreed on the guidelines for the borrowings by the States<br />
overseas and we immediately set officials to work to examine<br />
the proposals being put forward by the States. I don't think<br />
therefore you can point to that as being a change of tac., or<br />
a change of policy. It's something that's been foreshadowed<br />
over a long period and the knowledge that that was coming up<br />
in the lift was certainly known and understood at the time<br />
we prepared the last Budget.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
But it must have a stimulatory effect?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that's, again, the wrong way to look at it. It will<br />
enable the States to borrow overseas, to strengthen the<br />
infrastructure, the export capacity of Australia. In N. S. W<br />
coal-loading facilities, new power projects, similar provisions<br />
in Queensland and right around the Commonwealth major<br />
infrastructure which will support industry support our<br />
export capacity is going to be funded by this mechanism.<br />
When people look to Government expenditure as a stimulus, they<br />
generally are talking about something coming off the Budget,<br />
being financed out of the Budget, and this isn't. It's<br />
self-financing loans that the States raise and for which they<br />
are responsible and they haven't asked us to be responsible<br />
or to-guarantee it. They are prepared to do that on their<br />
own account. The real stimulus that will come into this </p>
<p>Primei Minister ( continued)<br />
economy, and any other that has been experiencing the<br />
same problems, comes from lower inflation, lower interest<br />
rates and people regaining confidence. You can't buy that<br />
with a Government spending more money which is going to<br />
increase a deficit. Ray Groom pointed out that a 1 percent<br />
reduction in housing interest rates will save home buyers<br />
$ 103 million a year. That's $ 130 million that they can spend<br />
on other things. Now that's real benefit real worth and<br />
that I agree is a stimulus. But that is the kind of stimulus<br />
that we need because it is based in real results and not on<br />
the Government printing more money or spending money<br />
inadvisably.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Are you concerned that inflation, as measured by the CPI,<br />
hasn't move downwards in the last quarter?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, the overall rate has come down. I would have liked the<br />
September Quarter to be down further but taking all our present<br />
knowledge into account, the Treasury advised me that there is<br />
no reason to withdraw from the Budget forecast of a inflation<br />
rate running at an annualised rate of 5 percent by the middle<br />
of next year the middle of 1979. There is no need to<br />
withdraw from that forecast at all. Now that's their forecast<br />
based on their models, their projections I've gctno reason<br />
to doubt it's validity. Let me also say that there is much<br />
dependent upon what is happening in the wage area and it's<br />
worth noting I think that there was a recent survey of trade<br />
unionists that showed quite plainly that in relation to wages<br />
and hours of work and many other matters affecting employment,<br />
the majority of trade unionists just do not agree with the<br />
attitudes being expressed, quite irresponsibly, by the union<br />
leaders.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
And yet Mr. Hawke and the ACTU Executive yesterday decided<br />
that they would pursue almost a policy of abandoning<br />
indexation as a result of the Government's decision to water<br />
down the powers of the PJT.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well we haven't watered down the powers of the PJT and<br />
Mr. Hawke knows that full well. We've altered the nature of<br />
the PJT to enable it to conduct a surveillence role far more<br />
effectively. And we've, since our decision, announced an<br />
examination in the food processing industry price structure<br />
and that's something of intimate concern to all housewives<br />
to all families. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
That's hitting at the wage sweetheart deals done in that<br />
industry.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it's hitting at the price structure, not only-at the<br />
wage sweetheart deals, but making sure that the pricing<br />
arrangements have been adequate and we'll get a good deal<br />
of information out of that which I hope would be useful.<br />
Mr. Hawke knows very well that if the kind of wage claims<br />
that could be inherent possible as a result of<br />
that ACTU decision; he knows quite well that that will lead<br />
to more unemployment than would otherwise be the case.<br />
I think it is the grossest hypocricy of any person to claim<br />
to be concerned for unemployment and at the same time<br />
pursue policies which they know must lead to more<br />
unemployment. It really is time Australia's trade union<br />
leaders began to show a concern for those who are out of<br />
jobs, not merely trying to get higher wages for those who<br />
are in jobs. It's not only a Liberal Prime Minister's<br />
statement, saying that. British Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan,<br />
British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dennis Healy, have said<br />
in the strongest possible terms much stronger language than<br />
I or John Howard use that if wage claims in Britian go up<br />
too much that will damage the whole economy. It will lead<br />
to more unemployment and they will either have to tax more<br />
or cut their own expenditures as a very direct result of<br />
just that. Frank Crean, when he was Labor Treasurer here,<br />
said one man's wage increase is another man's job. Over the<br />
last several years it is the total lack of responsibility<br />
by a number of trade union leaders that have not doubt hampered,<br />
slowed, delayed, the return to full competitiveness of<br />
Australian industry. I think that's a tragedy because we are<br />
all Australians and we ought to be able to act together in<br />
these particular matters and not try to make political<br />
capital out of what is a very serious human and social problem.<br />
TALK-BACK<br />
Question Mr. Fraser? How do you justify the ( inaudible) you made to<br />
the American columnist, Mr. Buckley, that your Government<br />
has brought inflation down while not taking it out on<br />
working people. Look how you've butchered Medibank and how<br />
you've raised all the taxes that just tell lies about<br />
the taxes. How do you justify that statement that you made<br />
to the Americans?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well I can make it very easily because in the 12 months to<br />
June, for example, average earnings increased more than<br />
the Consumer Price Index and that might be the simplest way<br />
of showing that our policies haven'n taken it out on the<br />
working people of Australia. In addition to that, I believe<br />
Medibank, as we now have it, offers a universal health care<br />
with special regard to lower income groups in the Australian<br />
community of a simpler kind and the reaction that I have had<br />
is it much better received and better accepted than any of<br />
the earlier versions of Medibank. But Medibank is / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
universal cover for all Australians. That has been<br />
maintained. We are seeking to provide that cover in the<br />
best way we can and make sure that the cost of health<br />
care, which has grown greatly in Australia and in many<br />
other countries remain within our capacity to afford.<br />
I think it is worth noting that even the Labor Opposition<br />
now support the basic structure of Medibank as it is.<br />
I think that does away with the claim that Medibank has<br />
been dismantled. On the question of taxes. on indirect<br />
taxes on whisky and cigarettes the taxes have been about<br />
restored to the level which Mr. Hayden introduced in one<br />
of his budgets and in addition to that and in spite of the<br />
temporary tax surcharge, the person on average earnings with<br />
a dependent wife and two children when family allowances<br />
are taken into account, is paying about $ 13 a week less<br />
than he would have been paying if Mr. Hayden's tax scales<br />
were still operating. Now that $ 13 1 think is a very<br />
significant benefit to the working people of Australia.<br />
Question<br />
What about the you promised people in their pay packets<br />
in February. You bring out a budget and take a<br />
what about all that?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. We haven't taken it away and I just made the point that<br />
despite the temporary tax surcharge, which runs out at the<br />
end of June, taxes are significantly lower, $ 13 a week for<br />
somebody on average earnings with a wife and two children,<br />
than they would have been under Mr. Hayden's tax scales.<br />
Nobody can get away from that particular point and it's just<br />
a plain statement of fact. When I first came into Government<br />
the number of elderly people, the number of low-income who<br />
were writing to me complaining about the injustice of<br />
Mr. Hayden's tax scales was very great indeed and our reforms<br />
removed the best part of 250,000 low-income people from<br />
the need to pay any tax at all. Our family allowance reforms<br />
gave very significant help to 300,000 low-income families<br />
and nearly 1 million young people who got no help out of<br />
the older system of family rebates, simply because their<br />
families didn't have enough income to take advantage of<br />
that rebate. Our reforms have shown a very real concern for<br />
the less well-off people in the Australian community and<br />
they will continue to do so.<br />
Question I am and always have been a very moderate, middle-of-the<br />
road Australianand in company with most people in this country<br />
I voted for the Government. I perhaps expected too much<br />
from a Liberal Government. I felt that<br />
a lot quicker than it has been. But with the economy well<br />
it still is in a rather disastrous state . bringing down<br />
inflation is obviously the only way to really restore the<br />
economy to any hope of a good life for all us and progress<br />
for the country. But with the economy being the way it is<br />
and the Exchequer being pretty well drained and we ' ye got to<br />
borrow money overseas~ vvould it not be possible to say this ./ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Question ( continued)<br />
generation of youngsters coming up who are going on the dole<br />
through mostly no fault of their own, who are not going to<br />
know the joy of work they are going to get a reasonable<br />
amount of money to live; they are not qoing to know the joy<br />
of work and by the time they do get an opportunity to go into<br />
work they will be too old to take trade courses or professional<br />
courses because not all of them have got the facilities or<br />
the background to get in would'it not be possible to<br />
possibly put the Commonwealth more in debt by instituting<br />
a compulsory training programme, through the C. E. S. to give<br />
the kids ground training for employment, the responsibilities<br />
of employment, etc. I know it is going to cost money, but<br />
do you possibly worth-the decisive forthright thing which<br />
could save a lot of kids from being no-hopers?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I understand and appreciate your reason for that question.<br />
Let me try and answer it this way. But first you made an<br />
earlier comment that you hoped the economy would be put right<br />
quicker but obviously inflation getting down is the only<br />
way to get it right. I think a lot of us, including the<br />
Government, hoped that it would be possible to make greater<br />
progress more quickly. I believe that one of the things<br />
that has held us back is the rate of increase in wages that<br />
has gone on. But secondly, the other thing, was something<br />
where many people in Australia and overseas in a sense, hoped<br />
for too much, was in the revival of world trade. Now, world<br />
trade has grown much less than we had hoped and that's partly<br />
because inflation has been increasing in the United States<br />
and increasing in a number of countries in Europe instead<br />
of falling, as it has been falling in Australia. Therefore,<br />
we have to look more to our own resources and less to any<br />
lift through general world trade and getting a larger share<br />
of growing world markets. The problem of young people is a<br />
very real one. We've done a number of things to try and<br />
help and we will continually review our programmes. But it<br />
is not a question of a whole generation not knowing or' getting<br />
the satisfaction from work because overwhelmingly in each age<br />
group the greater number of people within a few months of<br />
leaving school, do get a job. What we are left with, and what<br />
our programmes are designed to help with, are those who don't<br />
have a great deal of motivation the people whose education<br />
might be less good and the, say 10-20% of each age group who<br />
do have difficulty in getting a job. Now, to try and help<br />
with this, we've got special training programmes designed,<br />
orientated, to assist young people and in those training<br />
programmes about 110,000 people are in training at any one<br />
time. If these programmes can be improved, expanded, further<br />
developed, if new initiatives can be undertaken within the<br />
programmes they certainly will be. Indeed, within two or<br />
three weeks time Tony Street will have a complete review of<br />
the various training programmes before Cabinet and this has<br />
happened before and there have been modifications as a result.<br />
I can't predict what will come out of it. It's possible there<br />
should-be modifications. Let's leave it like that. I don't<br />
want to pre-empt it. The programmes do need review because<br />
we spent, I think the best part of $ 200 million in all the<br />
programmes this year and quite plainly we want to make sure </p>
<p>9-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
that the help is getting to the maximum number of people,<br />
young people, as possible.<br />
Colin Parks<br />
When would you expect the review to be announced?<br />
Prime minister<br />
Again, I said we are reviewing it in two to three weeks.<br />
Let's not try and pre-empt what comes out of that.<br />
So, we have shown concern and we want to demonstrate that.<br />
There are youth job centres in the capital cities and I have<br />
been in those centres and seen young kids coming in and<br />
looking around to see what work is available and many of<br />
them getting assistance through the centres. I don't really<br />
believe that a compulsory programme would be something that<br />
would work with great effect. Compulsion for national<br />
defence is one thing but compulsion for civil work, civil<br />
labour, is something that I believe many unions would have<br />
very strong objections to and I'm not sure that it wouldn't<br />
be in defiance of international labor organisations conventions<br />
to which Australia has committed itself. If we can find<br />
ways of getting to more people who need help, then certainly<br />
we will follow that path.<br />
Question One question. Have you yet read the report from the<br />
Commission of Human Relations?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have studied some parts of it. Not all of it..<br />
Question I could recommend Ann Deveson's book " Australians at Risk".<br />
That would help you.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Question Health costs. We say in Australia that health costs are<br />
increasing at a great rate. Perhaps an example of this would<br />
be, your comment would be quite acceptable recently I<br />
took my daughter in for an operation into a hospital. There<br />
were people involved filling out forms and 34 forms were<br />
filled out prior to the little girl being put into the<br />
operating theatre. Wouldn't this be a great expense on<br />
the health costs? </p>
<p>10<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well if that's happening to everyone who goes in for an<br />
operation, it's certainly a great expense. If you would<br />
like to give me the details of that and my office could<br />
contact you, ring you back, I certainly would be<br />
very happy to look at that particular case and find out<br />
what happened because one of the things that we've doing<br />
for the last 18 months is you know we share half the<br />
costs of running State hospitals with State Governmentsand<br />
we have been in negotiation with the states to try<br />
and reduce costs, maintain health care, but make quite sure<br />
that we get rid of unnecessary costs. Now, sometimes we<br />
find circumstances in which States are very reluctant to<br />
institute any changes which we think could indeed reduce<br />
costs and we've got no doubt that, we need the agreement<br />
of the States, but we've go no doubt that there is room for<br />
further cost savings. In some areas of Australia, for example,<br />
the occupancy of hospital beds is only about 60%. Well that<br />
means we are keeping 40% of the beds, staffed and ready for<br />
use but not being used. Now that sort of thing obviously<br />
adds greatly to costs. If you could give the station your<br />
phone number and name, I am not asking for it to come over<br />
the air, I would be very happy to follow your particular<br />
suggestion in relation to your own kid.<br />
Question I am a seventy year-old pensioner, above means test pensioner<br />
who receives no benefit because I have an income of over<br />
a week. I have paid tax all my life and I am still paying<br />
tax, including provisional tax. I pay full rates on my<br />
unit, I pay full medical insurance. If you lower the insurance<br />
rates, lower the rates that we are getting on our invested<br />
money, how are we going to live?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Is this money that you have invested with...<br />
Question This is money I have invested, yes, in bonds. And how are<br />
we going to live?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The changes that were made to the pensions for people over<br />
seventy were designed to make sure that the funds go to a<br />
maximum extent, to those most in need and that's why the<br />
means test was introduced for additional pension over seventy.<br />
There is still a fairly significant base amount that of course<br />
goes to every person. But, getting inflation down is very<br />
important.<br />
-, Question<br />
It's all very well for you who is classified as above millionaire.<br />
/ 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'm not thinking of myself in these particular matters.<br />
You've got many young couples who don't have a home; who<br />
want to borrow money to buy a home. If they have to<br />
pay 10% rate of interest to get that home it often puts<br />
the home beyond their reach and it is very important that<br />
the rate of interest get reduced. Now in this particular<br />
regard I think that there is complete unanimity between<br />
Neville Wran and myself because we have often spoken about<br />
interest rates and their impact on Australian society.<br />
Question I'm afraid there is going to be heck of a lot of invalid<br />
votes, informal votes, because we just won't vote for<br />
either Party.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Getting inflation down is going to be a very real help to<br />
you and to every Australian because one of the things<br />
that was happening before is that you might have your money<br />
invested at say 8% or 9% but if inflation was running away<br />
at 16% or 17% or 18%, the value of that money was falling,<br />
the value of your income from that money was also falling<br />
very greatly. Now with inflation about half that, or less<br />
than half that, obviously the value of your money is being<br />
maintained and the value of your income you get is also<br />
being maintained.<br />
Question Would you come and live with us in you live in such a<br />
beautiful world. . you get the very best of the world..<br />
but you will both get a lot of informal votes because people<br />
of the over-seventies are just fed up with the reaction of<br />
both these unthinkable<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The other thing I think ought to be said is that about<br />
250,000 low-income people, and many of them would have been<br />
elderly people, are removed from the need to pay taxes because<br />
of the tax changes that we introduced. If you are still paying<br />
tax all that means is that there are many many people who are<br />
worse off than yourself, who have been relieved of the need<br />
to pay taxes as a result of the changes that we introduced.<br />
Question Do you agree that the crime, violence and murder rate are<br />
up high in hard-hearted societies where unemployment is<br />
accepted and secondly, you get all your ideas from<br />
Ayn Rand. / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't get all my ideas from Ayn Rand. I know sometimes<br />
my political enemies try to suggest that I do. I think<br />
Ayn Rand takes her views much too far. There is one thing<br />
that is attractive, and one that attracted me to her<br />
books, apart from the way it was written, and that is that<br />
she places great importance on individual people and<br />
individual people being able to develop their talents.<br />
Now that I think is important in our society to place<br />
pre-eminent importance on people. At the same time, for those<br />
who are disadvantaged amongst us, we need to show concern<br />
and compassion and have policies that will act on that<br />
concern and compassion. So, I hope that the fact that I have<br />
read Ayn Rand doesn't brand me as embracing all of her<br />
philosophy any more than the fact that I have read Karl Marx<br />
can be construed as suggesting I embrace Karl Marx's particular<br />
philosophy because I certainly don't.<br />
I don't think unemployment is accepted and I think it is a<br />
very real problem and I don't believe Australia is a hard-hearted<br />
society. I think there is one factor in our society in relation<br />
to crime which I do regard with the utmost seriousness and<br />
I don't think' it's got much to do with unemployment and that<br />
is the problem of drugs and drug addiction. And you will<br />
have know from the success of the Narcotics people over recent<br />
years of the enormous hauls involving many tens of millions<br />
of dollars sometimes, of the extent to which drug peddlers<br />
and salesmen trying to operate in the Australian market.<br />
I regard that as the cruellest and harshest crime of all<br />
because people who try to make profit out of drugs are doing<br />
so it's not a crime of passion cold-bloodedly, calculatingly<br />
and designably and in the process they can destroy the lives<br />
of tens of thousands of people, young and old alike. I think<br />
that the penalities that our society puts upon such people<br />
should be very heavy, very great and I don't believe they<br />
deserve much mercy at all. They do enormous damage to society.<br />
They are the enemies of society and they certainly bring with<br />
them increased crime.<br />
Question Did you ever look at the societies of Japan and Sweden. They<br />
are soft decent societies who don't accept unemployment like<br />
we do and so on have a low crime rate.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You'vye got many different facets in different countries but<br />
I haven't understood that the Swedish crime rate was particularly<br />
low. In a number of Scandanavian countries my understanding is,<br />
I am not saying that divorce is a crime, but the break-up of<br />
families and divorce I think has been very very great. We can<br />
often write down Australia society. I believe this is one of<br />
the best countries of the world and I think it is one of the<br />
best countries of the world in which to bring up a family.<br />
I have been to a number of countries. I haven't been to<br />
Sweden, but I have been to Japan. We often, I think, knowing<br />
our own faults, as we obviously have I think we often<br />
depreciate Australia and knock Australia when we should<br />
proclaim Australia's virtues and the very great benefits that<br />
Australia does and can provide to its citizens. / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Question I would like to know why there is not a parent or<br />
single-parent pension scheme for men as there is for<br />
women.... . widower and against widow deserting husbands<br />
and/ or wives with the children.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We brought in at the end of last year a sole parent<br />
pension which was meant to put men on exactly the same<br />
position as women.<br />
Question That didn't do the trick did it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it is meant to. If there is a deficiency in the<br />
legislation I would like to know about it.<br />
Question I want to clarify this for you. Being a man, having care<br />
and control of the children, we get a benefit. We get the<br />
same money as the women but we don't get a medical health<br />
charge for one thing. Medical health charge, which you<br />
must agree, is very important to us because we have to go<br />
and plead-poor mouse to the doctors and we are getting the<br />
same money as the women are getting.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let me look into that for you.<br />
Question<br />
We've tried with Minister for Health, and for Social Security...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We did make a very significant advance when we did give sole<br />
male parents the same benefits as women. Now if there are<br />
some areas where women still get an additional benefit let<br />
me look at it because I certainly believe in no discrimination<br />
between men and women of any kind.<br />
Question Good afternoon. It is Mel Hercam from the Sydney City<br />
Mission. We have completed a twelve-month programme for<br />
the training of unemployed young people in the Liverpool<br />
Green Valley area. We've had a most successful programme.<br />
We have had 93% or 90% of those young people now employed.<br />
You and your Government have rejected the repetition of this<br />
programme on the grounds of budgetary constraint. But what<br />
concerns me more than anything on the fact that your Government<br />
has decided to only fund Government-operated programmes and<br />
/ 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
Question ( continued)<br />
I would just like to have your comments on why you feel<br />
that programmes operated by non-Government organisations,<br />
particularly in low-income areas, does not receive this<br />
approval. Prime Minister<br />
Again, I would have to look into this because I know that<br />
a number of the community youth support programmes was<br />
it under that programme that you were operating?<br />
Question<br />
Yes, it was. We were originally funded under NEAT and..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do know of other programmes that are not run by Governments<br />
that are funded under NEAT. I know of one run by some<br />
people in some way attached to the Brotherhood of St. Lawrence<br />
and that is not run by the Government. So I think that part<br />
of it is not right, but let me look into it. The only<br />
programme that I am aware of that has been continuing I'm<br />
not saying there aren't others that I think wasn't funded<br />
this year was one because the training costs were much much<br />
higher than other programmes and other people who giving<br />
a benefit to more young kids for the same value of money.<br />
I don't know that that was your programme or another one.<br />
Question<br />
No. I think it's ours. But I think the costs that were worked<br />
out by your Department were not correct.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well if there is a mistake in the costs we can certainly<br />
look into that. Did you programme cost about $ 350,000<br />
last year?<br />
Question No, no.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
What did it cost, do you know?<br />
Question $ 90,000<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let me look into it and get a report on it for you because<br />
the total sum that we are spending on the training programmes<br />
this year is up very very substantially from last year. The<br />
money hasn't been restricted. There are more people at any<br />
one time in training than there were last year. It is now<br />
running at about 110,000 at any one time. Right at this moment. </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
That's up very considerably. The sum being provided,<br />
I think, look I don't want to held to ransom over the<br />
figures, but I think they've gone from something like<br />
a bit over $ 100 million, maybe 120 or 30, to approaching<br />
$ 200 million.<br />
Question I have to say this: that Mr. Street and Senator Carrick<br />
and members of the State and Commonwealth Education Department,<br />
have said our programme, which is the only one of its<br />
kind operating in the whole of this country, is the most<br />
successful programme that is operating. And yet I have a<br />
letter from you, I have a letter from Mr. Street and from<br />
Senator Carrick which says that it cannot be funded because<br />
you are not funding private operated funds.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let me look into it for you, will you?<br />
Question Maybe I can contact you again directly?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, certainly.<br />
Question I wondered if you could tell me if there has been any<br />
examination as to what extent the tariffs on imported inputs<br />
could be lowered or eliminated. I realise there has to be<br />
some sort of to the effect that revenue foregone and<br />
increases in domestic manufacturing. The second thing I<br />
wanted to ask you will the Government, plus business and<br />
employer/ employee groups put or start an ongoing programme<br />
for a manpower policy. Not something just in with the<br />
end of the Government but an ongoing sort of body. The<br />
third thing I would like to ask you is what would you like<br />
to be seen as your major contribution to Australia after<br />
you finish in political life?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The tariffs can be lowered, but we do have tariffs to assis t<br />
Australian industry and Australian employment. They are not<br />
really there as a revenue measure and that is not in our<br />
minds when tariffs are adjusted. There are independent<br />
examinations of different tariffs from time to time and the<br />
Government makes decisions on the basis of independent<br />
reports coming from a body called the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission. They sometimes recommend that tariffs should go<br />
up for an industry. They quite often recommend that<br />
tariffs should go down. Wie don't have to accept the recommendations.<br />
We do act upon them. I believe that we do have a manpower policy<br />
but there is no one thing that is a manpower policy. It's<br />
a combination of a whole number of factors; of a number of<br />
policies that operate to affect the demands for labor; and / 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
the circumstances and conditions in which people are employed.<br />
The training programmes which have been mentioned on this programme<br />
today are a part of that manpower policy. The consultations<br />
which Tony Street conducts with employers and the peak union<br />
councils in the National Labour Consultative Council that<br />
involves many aspects of industrial relations and other<br />
factors that affect both labour, trade union movements and<br />
industry. Again, through the Department of Productivity there<br />
are many tripartite groups management, labour and governmentall<br />
working together to assist industry to make industry<br />
competitive and therefore able to employ. There are many factors<br />
that are involved in a manpower policy, and I would hope that<br />
many of these things will be continuing ones, because I believe<br />
they are good, and I don't believe they are involved in politics.<br />
when I leave politics, what would I like to be remembered for?<br />
I became Prime Minister I suppose at one of the most difficult<br />
times in Australia's history, with very real economic difficulties<br />
that were damaging the lives and livelihood of tens of<br />
thousands of Australians. To get those major matters right,<br />
to take Australia forward into the 1980' s with confidence,<br />
confidence in ourselves asa people, united with common purposes,<br />
and knowing quite well that Australia is a good country in which<br />
to bring up a family. Also I would hope that my Government<br />
is known for its concern for the disadvantaged, and for lower<br />
income people -a government that does show concern.<br />
In this last Budget which in many ways was a difficult budget<br />
and a tough budget, there were very substantial increases in<br />
funds to assist disadvantaged people. The programmes have been<br />
enormously expanded over the last two or three years.<br />
Very great sums have been provided for building homes for aged<br />
people, and for elderly citizens clubs. Much much more remains<br />
to be done, but I believe that Australia is a country in which<br />
there is a real concern for the less well off in-our community<br />
and I hope my Government is, and can in the future, contribute<br />
to alleviating hardship where it is found in our midst.<br />
Question I would like to speak about easing the means test on the<br />
that you are allowed to have on a pension before you are<br />
penalised, unless you are allowed to have $ 25 a week, then after<br />
that you lose all your benefits. I think superannuation should<br />
be exempt from that.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
I think you pretty well covered that didn't you Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I thought I had, whether you can ease those things depends upon<br />
the total funds you have got for pensions and welfare and we have </p>
<p>tried to see that the extra funds that are available go to<br />
those most in need, and that is often those without any<br />
additional income at all. A married couple still get some<br />
pension if their combined income plus pension goes up, I . think,<br />
to $ 200 a week, or maybe a bit over that. The pension i's paid<br />
at levels of income that aren't particularly low, and can be<br />
much above the income that say a young couple might have, with<br />
family obligations, just started out on life.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Perhaps I could round out the programme by just asking a quick<br />
question of the Prime Minister. Parliament ends tomorrow,<br />
doesn't resume until February would you rule out a Ministry<br />
reshuffle, or a rearrangement in the intervening period?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
These matters aren't in contemplation.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Not at all.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not in contemplation.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Mr Fraser do you worry that the type of questions that you have<br />
received in the last hour or so reflect a general level of<br />
dissatisfaction? Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't think so. There are a number of people obviously<br />
who want more done in a number of areas, and there are a number<br />
of questions concerning the pensions area. You go on different<br />
programmes, and you seem to get different listening audiences,<br />
I think, and different sorts of questions come through.<br />
The purpose of talk-back programme is to enable people to express<br />
their concerns, and I am quite certain that people who are<br />
concerned are more likely to ring up than someone who is satisfied<br />
in all respects.<br />
