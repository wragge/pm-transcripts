<p>To Mr Chairman, to Mr Jack Lockett; to your excellency the Ambassador</p>
<p>   of France; to my colleague, Tim Fischer the Deputy Prime Minister;</p>
<p>   to Bruce Reid the Member of Bendigo; to the Mayor of Bendigo, ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I have had many honours and privileges to come my way as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister but none exceeds the very special privilege of responding</p>
<p>   on behalf of Australia's oldest returned serviceman. This wonderful</p>
<p>   man, this priceless national treasure, this man who embodies so</p>
<p>   much of what we think good and fine and noble about our country:</p>
<p>   he has received from the Ambassador, France's highest decoration.</p>
<p>   It is a fitting acknowledgment of the incredible contribution made</p>
<p>   by our country to the defence of France in the Great War.</p>
<p>With a male population of only a little over 2.5 million, 416,000-odd</p>
<p>   Australians volunteered in WWI. More Australian blood has been spilt</p>
<p>   defending the soil of France than in any other part of the world.</p>
<p>   And the contribution made by Australians to the defence of France</p>
<p>   and to the defence of freedom was absolutely incalculable.</p>
<p>Today we honour a man who represents so much of what is the true</p>
<p>   Australian spirit. He represents courage. He represents adventure.</p>
<p>   He represents a willingness to share adversity, to put his life</p>
<p>   on the line, to risk the ultimate sacrifice. He is a wonderful and</p>
<p>   priceless link with a very important part of our history.</p>
<p>And it's a wonderful opportunity to honour those brave Australians</p>
<p>   of long ago who risked so much to go to the other side of the world</p>
<p>   to defend our way of life. And also through him to honour those</p>
<p>   other hundreds of thousands of Australians in WWII and in Korea</p>
<p>   and Malaysia and in Vietnam who did exactly the same thing. Their</p>
<p>   willingness to put their lives on the line, their willingness to</p>
<p>   sacrifice all in the defence of our way of life is something that</p>
<p>   always has me standing in awe.</p>
<p>Because we do have a way of life in this country that is precious</p>
<p>   and very special. It is the envy of the world, but if it hadn't</p>
<p>   been for the likes of Jack we wouldn't be able to enjoy it.</p>
<p>   And everyday we should count the blessings that people like Jack</p>
<p>   represent.</p>
<p>So to you on behalf of a very grateful, a very humble and a very</p>
<p>   proud and a very affectionate nation, can I say how much we hold</p>
<p>   you in our esteem, how deep is the emotion that so many of us feel</p>
<p>   for what you represent about the Australian way of life and what</p>
<p>   you have done to make this a country which everyone in this room</p>
<p>   loves, whatever may be our views on other issues. You are a priceless</p>
<p>   national asset and treasure. Long may you have happiness and health</p>
<p>   in the bosom of your family and your friends. And on behalf of a</p>
<p>   deeply grateful nation I say thank you and God bless you.</p>
