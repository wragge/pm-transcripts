PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 550<br />
27 August 1975<br />
TIMOR EVACUEES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced tonight<br />
that the Australian Government would take immediate action<br />
to help evacuees from Timor.<br />
He said he had approved a series of charter flights<br />
to bring evacuees from Timor landed in Darwin from the<br />
" Lloyd Bakke" and the " Macdili" to proper facilities in<br />
southern Australia. Darwin does not have facilities to accommodate<br />
those evacuees who do not wish to return immediately to<br />
Portugal. Temporary residence will be granted to those refugees<br />
electing to remain in Australia and those wishing to apply for<br />
permanent residence will have their applications processed in<br />
the normal way.<br />
The Department of Labor and Immigration will be<br />
responsible for chartering civil and R. A. A. F. aircraft to move<br />
the evacuees south and for accommodating them in migrant hostels.<br />
Flights are expected to begin within a few days.<br />
There were 862 evacuees still in Darwin today. The<br />
' Macdili", which is expected to arrive in Darwin on Friday, is<br />
carrying about 800 evacuees. Most of the evacuees are<br />
Portuguese citizens and the Portuguese Government will pay their<br />
transport costs to southern Australia.<br />
