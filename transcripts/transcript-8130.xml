PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS TO MELBOURNE OLYMPIC CANDIDATURE MEMBERS, NEW TAKANAWA<br />
PRINCE HOTEL, TOKYO 17 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
John Ralph told a story about 99 per cent accurately about the<br />
12 to 18 months ago. What he didn't say is that I said with a<br />
proper sense of decorum and modesty, I said, subject to the<br />
election John. He had more confidence than I did.<br />
Now I don't want to speak for long but I hope that what I can<br />
say will be relevant to these next 24 hours. I introduce it by<br />
saying that in the seven and a half years that I have been Prime<br />
Minister there have been very few occasions which have really<br />
given me such a sense of pride as I have felt around this bid<br />
and now leading up to this last 24 hours.<br />
Because Australians have shown a remarkable sense of national<br />
togetherness, pride and commitment. That has been true across<br />
the political spectrum and I pay tribute to the Opposition<br />
parties in Victoria and the Opposition parties federally. This<br />
is an issue where there is no political division and I thank<br />
everyone for that. There has been a total commitment, as there<br />
has importantly been a geographical commitment. There was a<br />
fight on the part of Melbourne to get the nomination, but once<br />
Melbourne got the nomination the rest of Australia has fallen in<br />
behind, and I thank all Australians for that.<br />
It's also been a matter of pride, that I found when I got here<br />
in many comments last night, that Australia has indeed been<br />
constructive in its approach. It hasn't been aggressive, it has<br />
been forward in putting the virtues of our case. But there has<br />
been, as far as I can see, a universal approbation of the way in<br />
which you've gone about the task.<br />
Now what are the best things that we have got to say in this<br />
next 24 hours? I think there are these things that ought to be<br />
emphasised. Firstly there are the intrinsics, as I put it, of<br />
the bid. We are entitled to say, and to believe, that no<br />
candidate has an intrinsically better case than Melbourne.<br />
Whether you look at the facilities, which are outstanding and so<br />
much in place already, the centrality and propinquity of the<br />
facilities, there is no candidate which can match those. I<br />
believe there is no candidate which can match the degree of the<br />
universality of support for the bid. Australians are sports<br />
fanatics and the most fanatic of all are the people of<br />
Melbourne. So we can ensure the success of the Games in terms<br />
of the facilities and the commitment of our people. </p>
<p>2.<br />
In terms of being prepared by 1996 we have the total commitment,<br />
and here I thank you John Halfpenny, for the total commitment of<br />
the trade union movement. You've signed the agreements and<br />
those facilities will be ready and they will be ready on time as<br />
will the delivery of all the services during the period of the<br />
Games. Weather-wise it's a perfect time of the year in Melbourne in<br />
late September early October. So, as I say, all the intrinsics<br />
are there.<br />
We also have the great advantage of being a country, more than<br />
any in the world, which can properly speak with pride of our<br />
fundamental political stability and security. The concept of<br />
terror is alien to Australia and it is not part of our history<br />
or our record and we can guarantee as can no other country, I<br />
believe, we can assert the security of Australia.<br />
So those are all the obvious intrinsics of our claim. But may I<br />
suggest that we have one obvious claim that we can make that no<br />
other country can and in a sense Melbourne typifies it as much<br />
as any other part of Australia, and it's this. I believe that<br />
Australia is the permanent embodiment of the Olympic ideal.<br />
I mean by that that we are a nation which in the post-war period<br />
has welcomed to our shores people from 140 different nations.<br />
We have opened up Australia without now discrimination on the<br />
basis of colour or creed or nationality. We have opened up<br />
Australia as a home, a permanent home, to the people of every<br />
nation of the globe. That is the sense in which I mean we are<br />
the permanent embodiment of the Olympic ideal of people living<br />
and cooperating peacefully together. I think there is no other<br />
bidding city or country which is able so proudly and<br />
realistically to make that boast. Just as in this post-war<br />
period and particularly in the last 20 years or so that we have<br />
made Australia a home for all people and have welcomed them<br />
without discrimination permanently.<br />
So we are able to say, I think, to those who are going to be<br />
casting their vote tomorrow that we therefore speak with the<br />
authority of our record and the very fabric of our country, we<br />
speak with that authority when we say that we will truly be a<br />
host to the nations of the world in the true Olympic spirit. I<br />
think we are able to say that, as I say, in a way that no-one<br />
else can do. So may I conclude by saying John, to you<br />
personally, you've been a magnificent Chairman of the bid, I<br />
thank you. I thank you all my friends, you've done Australia<br />
proud and if justice is done we will all be celebrating tomorrow<br />
night. ends<br />
