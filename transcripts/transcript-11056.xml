<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, with the capping of Telstra is there any real need</p>
<p> to sell off the rest of Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, because it will still be a much better and stronger company</p>
<p> if it is fully privatised. That's our policy, subject to being</p>
<p> satisfied about the community services and everything but we'll</p>
<p> be putting that up to Parliament and we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, were you concerned that your APS security guards were</p>
<p> asleep on the job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't talk about those matters.</p>
