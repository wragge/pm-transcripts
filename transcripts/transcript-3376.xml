PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 317<br />
September 1974<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION INTO ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING SOME<br />
AUSTRALIAN MARITIME UNIONS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that<br />
the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, in Executive Council, has<br />
appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into allegations of<br />
demands and payments affecting certain Australian Maritime unions.<br />
Mr Whitlam said the Honourable John Bernard Sweeney,<br />
Judge of the Australian Industrial Court, had been appointed the<br />
Royal Commissioner and would be assisted by counsel.<br />
The Prime Minister said the decision by the Australian<br />
Government to request the appointment of a Royal Commission was<br />
taken early this week after consultations between myself and<br />
the ministers responsible, Mr C. K. Jones and Mr C. R. Cameron.<br />
These consultations began as soon as information that such<br />
demands were being made became available to me.<br />
After consideration by the ministers, the information<br />
was investigated by the relevant departments the Department of<br />
Transport and the Department of Labor and Immigration, in<br />
consultation with the Attorney-General's Department. It was<br />
decided that the circumstances fully warranted the appointment<br />
of a member of the Australian judiciary as a Royal commission to<br />
investigate the matters.<br />
The Australian Government agrees with the declared<br />
policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in condemning the<br />
demands and payments allegedly made. The Government is gravely<br />
concerned by the public declaration by an official of one of the<br />
unions alleged to be involved that the A. C. T. U. decision would be<br />
defied. The Royal Commission will have wide powers to summon<br />
witnesses and documents.<br />
The terms of reference for the Royal Commission are:<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
i. To enquire into and report on:<br />
whether any payments ( other than those of a normal<br />
commercial nature or made pursuant to any law or<br />
industrial award or agreement) have in recent times<br />
been or are being made or demanded in respect of the<br />
use of ships in voyages to or from Australia, or<br />
within the Australian coasting trade under permit or<br />
licence under the Navigation Act 1912.<br />
the circumstances under which and the persons<br />
( including corporate bodies) by whom and to whom<br />
any such payments or demands have been made.<br />
the reasons for and the purpose of. any such payments<br />
or demands.<br />
the subsequent or proposed use of or disposal of any<br />
such payments.<br />
the legality of any such payments and demands and<br />
their propriety having regard in particular to<br />
Australian trade union principles and ethics.<br />
2. To recommend in the light of the Commission's findings:<br />
what action, if any, should be taken in respect of<br />
such payments.<br />
what legislative or administrative changes are<br />
necessary or desirable in relation to these matters.<br />
It is expected that the first hearings of the<br />
Commission will be held at an early date.<br />
