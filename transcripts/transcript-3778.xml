<p>I THE HISTORY OF THIS PARTY IS THE RECORD OF THE EFFORTS<br />
OF OUR OPPONENTS TO DIVIDE US, OUR SUCCESSES ARE<br />
MEASURED BY OUR SUCCESS IN RESISTING THOSE EFFORTS,<br />
OUR FAILURES AND DISASTERS ARE THE STORY OF HOW<br />
WE HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THOSE ATTEMPTS. THOSE EFFORTS<br />
TO DIVIDE . THIS PARTY HAVE ONLY SUCCEEDED WHEN<br />
THE PARTY ITSELF CHOSE TO DIVIDE WHEN ONE GROUP OR<br />
SECTION OR FACTION WITHIN THE PARTY BELIEVED THAT<br />
IT COULD PROMOTE ITS IMMEDIATE, ITS SHORT TERM INTEREST,<br />
THROUGH A DIVIDED, A. WEAKENED PARTY.<br />
SINCE WE WERE ELECTED TO OFFICE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO,<br />
SSINCE WE WERE RE-ELECTED TO OFFICE JUST OVER ONE<br />
YEAR AGO,. THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS HELD<br />
STEADFASTLY TO ONE OBJECTIVE,<br />
WHAT IS THAT OBJECTIVE? THE OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO<br />
FULFIL THE POLICY OF THIS PARTY, THE POLICY GIVEN<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE AND ACCEPTED BY THEM IN 1972,<br />
THE POLICY GIVEN TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE AND<br />
REAFFIRMED BY THEM IN 1974,<br />
-I r-I I I T l-lj C<br />
I </p>
<p>-2-<br />
WHEN THE PEOPLE ELECTED US IN 1972, WHEN THE<br />
PEOPLE REAFFIRMED US IN OFFICE IN 1974, THEY VOTED<br />
FOR OUR PROGRAM, THE PROGRAM AS THEY KNEW IT TO BE,<br />
AS IT WAS PRESENTEDIN 1972 AND AGAIN IN 1974.<br />
THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM.<br />
. MOUNTED AGAINST THIS PROGRAM IS A CAMPAIGN OF HOSTILITY<br />
UNPARALLELED IN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY. THE HOSTILITY<br />
SIS UNPARALLELED BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
HISTORY HAVE SO MANY VESTED INTERESTS BEEN TAKEN ON<br />
AT ONE TIME, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE ENTRENCHED,<br />
. THE POWERFUL, THE HIGHLY PRIVILEGED HAVE FOUND THAT<br />
THEIR DEMANDS ARE NOT ACCORDED THE NUMBER ONE<br />
PRIORITY WHICH THEY BELIEVE IS THEIR INHERENT RIGHT.<br />
.4. f<br />
L.<br />
' 77-</p>
<p>I CAN ACCEPT ALL THE GROUCHES AND THE GRIPES<br />
AND'THE COMPLAINTS'OF ALL THOSE OLD ESTABLISHED<br />
INTERESTS WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT DOING<br />
PARTICULARLY WELL OUT OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT. IN<br />
CANBERRAI* IIT ' S ADIFFERENT MATTER WIHEN IT COMES TO<br />
RESISTANCE TO THE PROGRAM WITHIN THE LABOR<br />
4 MOVEMENT, -THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE LABOR<br />
MOVEMENT HAS TO THINK VERY CLEARLY ABOUT<br />
THE DIRECTION IT IS GOING TO TAKE,<br />
IT IS A MISTAKE FOR ANY UNION TO BELIEVE THAT<br />
-ITS OWN MUSCLE POWER IS AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE .4<br />
FOR CONCERTED GOVERNMENT ACTION TO PROMOTE<br />
REAL EQUALITY AND RAISE REAL STANDARDS&amp;<br />
; IT IS A MISTAKE'FOR ANY'STATE MEMBER TO BELIEVE<br />
THAT THE WAY . TO POPULARITY OR POWER IS TO<br />
JOIN IN THE CHORUS AGAINST THE LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
IN CABERR S. .4<br />
IT IS OUR BOAST THAT WE ARE THE ONLY TRUE<br />
NATIONAL PARTY IN AUSTRALIA. -WE CANNOT BLAME THE<br />
PEOPLE IF THEY TAKE US AT OUR WORD AND AT OUR OWN<br />
VALUATION. .4 .4%<br />
4.4 .4 .4.4 4 4.4. .4~ rl-.4.4 4 </p>
<p>-THE STRENGTH OF THE NATIONAL PARTY IS THE<br />
. STRENGTH OF EACH SECTION OF THE ENTIRE PARTY.<br />
THERE IS A MYTH THAT STATE PARTIES COULD PROSPER<br />
IF THENATIONAL GOVERNMENT WERE DEFEATED,<br />
THERE IS-A MYTH THAT IF YOU KNOCK THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT IN CANBERRA YOU WILL GET KUDOS<br />
SFOR LABOR IN BRISBANE, OR SYDNEY OR MELBOURNE.<br />
YOU WILL NOT,<br />
. OUR OPPONENTS WILL ALWAYS DO THAT SORT OF THING<br />
-SO MUCH BETTER. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT MYTHS<br />
THAT A STATE LABOR POLITICIAN, WHOEVER HE BE,<br />
WILL GET GOOD MARKS BY KNOCKING A FEDERAL LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT, IF LABOR IS NOT NATIONALLY CREDIBLE, IS IT<br />
TO BE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT IT CAN BE.<br />
S CREDIBLE ON A STATE BASIS?<br />
THERE IS NO POINT,<br />
LIBERAL GAME THE NO DIVIDEND, IN PLAYING THE<br />
OLD GAME OF DIVIDE AND RULE... r </p>
<p>S*<br />
i -4-<br />
LET ME SAY VERY CLEARLY WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT, IT IS ABOUT THE FULFILLMENT<br />
OF THE POLICY OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY<br />
. AS PROMISED TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
i WE HEAR A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT IN CANBERRA. THE REAL OBJECTION<br />
IS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS ALL TOO PREDICTABLE,<br />
-EVERYTHING. THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO, OR ARE DOING,<br />
WAS IN THOSE POLICY SPEECHES.<br />
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT IN 1972 SOME SUPPORTED US<br />
ON THE GROUNDS THAT WE WERE NOT SERIOUS OR SINCERE<br />
SOR INTENT UPON APPLYING OUR POLICIES, IT MAY BE<br />
THAT SOME MISTOOK THE PROGRAM FOR MERE WINDOW-DRESSING,<br />
IT MAY BE THAT SOME THOUGHT THAT ONCE WE GOT INTO<br />
GOVERNMENT WE WOULD TAKE UP THE NORMAL POSITION<br />
OF PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT OF CYNICISM, OF BETRAYAL.<br />
WHAT HAS HORRIFIED SO MANY OF THE WELL-ESTABLISHED,<br />
SO MANY OF THE POWERFUL, SO MANY OF THE PRIVILEGED<br />
IN AUSTRALIA IS THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY SET ABOUT DOING<br />
THOSE THINGS WHICH WE SAID WE WOULD DO AND WHICH<br />
WE PROMISED TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA THAT WE<br />
WOULD DO, </p>
<p>* L ^ l<br />
I) n<br />
I<br />
I r r<br />
ADHER IUTOT HSE PLEDGES, AGAIN I KEPEA<br />
IT IS NOT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THIS GOVERNMENT<br />
AND OF THIS PARTY-TO WHICH OUR OPPONENTS OBJECT,<br />
BUT OUR PREDICTABILITY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TRIED<br />
TO ABIDE BY OUR UNDERTAKINGS. IT IS OUR<br />
SERIOUSNESS, OUR SINCERITY TO WHICH THEY OBJECT. TA.<br />
WE INHERITEi-A GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS A JOKE;<br />
TESE GREAT AND POWERFUL PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT ALL<br />
GOVERNMENT WAS A JOKE; SO THEY TOOK OUR POLICY<br />
FCR JUST ANOTHER SORT OF JOKE.<br />
THEY FORGOT THAT THERE WERE MEN AND WOMEN IN:<br />
' AUSTRALIA, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY) WHO MIGHT BE SERIOUS SERIOUS<br />
Ifl THEIR TASK, SER-IOUS IN THEIR PROMISES AND<br />
PLEDGES TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA AT AN ELECTION.<br />
So WHAT WE HAVE DONE-FROM DECEMBER 1972<br />
UNTIL THIS DAY IS TO TRY TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
AND LET IT BE VERY CLEAR THAT THE PRINCIPLE<br />
SOBJECTIVE REMAINS AS I STATED IT IN NOVEMBER 1972<br />
TO PROMOTE EQUALITY. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING<br />
I<br />
t' DEMOCRATIC WORLD, SOUGHT TO PROMOTE EQUALITY, t..<br />
t:<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DONE, YOU WILL SEE THAT THAT<br />
HAS BEEN ITS ABIDING AIM TO PROMOTE EQUALITY,<br />
I EMPHASISE " TO PROMOTE EQUALITY" NOT TO<br />
IMPOSE EQUALITY,:' WE HAVE IN A QUITE UNIQUE WAY'<br />
IN THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA AND PERHAPS IN THE<br />

<p>-7-A<br />
IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS, EQUALITY, BOTH EQUALITY OF<br />
OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY-OF RESULTS IS NOT GOING TO<br />
BE DETERMINED SOLELY OR EVEN MAINLY BY EQUALITY OF<br />
INCOME. THE FIRST AIM MUST BE GREATER EQUALITY OF<br />
BASIC SERVICES,. THE SERVICES WHICH THE COMMUNITY ALONE<br />
CAN PROVIDE IN A MODERN SOCIETY AND THROUGH GREATER<br />
EQUALITY BETWEEN REGIONS. THE GREAT INEQUALITIES<br />
IN AUSTRALIA ARE NOW NOT AS BETWEEN STATES, BUT AS<br />
BETWEEN REGIONS WITHIN STATES. INCREASINGLY, A<br />
FAMILY'S STANDARD OF LIVING, THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
DECENT HEALTH, DECENT SCHOOLS, DECENT TRANSPORT,<br />
DECENT ENVIRONMENT, ARE DETERMINED NOT SO MUCH BY THEIR<br />
INCOME, BUT BY WHERE THEY LIVE,<br />
EXT WEEK, AT THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, WE WILL HEAR<br />
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT A BETTER DEAL FOR THE STATES,<br />
WE ARE PERFECTLY PREPARED TO PROVIDE A FAIR DEAL<br />
NOT ON THE BASIS OF DIVIDING AUSTRALIA INTO SIX<br />
COMPETING, CONFLICTING COMPARTMENTS OR SEVEN COMPETING<br />
CONFLICTING GOVERNMENTS, BUT ON THE BASIS THAT ALL<br />
THE GOVERNMENTS SHARE THE SAME PROBLEMS AND SHARE THE<br />
SAME RESPONSIBILITY. 1<br />

THOSE PROBLEMS CANNOT BE SOLVED JUST BY HANDING OUT<br />
A FEW MORE MILLIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYERS'<br />
MONEY, WE HAVE TO FIND PERMANENT SOLUTIONS WHICH<br />
MAKE FOR BETTER SERVICES AND A MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION<br />
OF THE NATION'S RESOURCES, THE APPROACH IE HAVE<br />
ADOPTED EVER SINCE WE CAME INTO GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN<br />
TO TRY TO RELIEVE THE STATES OF SOME OF THE CHRONIC<br />
BURDENS ON THEIR BUDGETS AND FREE THEM TO USE<br />
THEIR RESOURCES MORE CONSTRUCTIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY.<br />
IN THOSE AREAS WHERE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE PROPERLY<br />
PARAMOUNT,<br />
THE LIBERAL APPROACH OFFERS NO LASTING SOLUTION,<br />
THAT APPROACH IS TO LEAVE THE BASIC STRUCTURES<br />
UNCHANGED,/ TO KEEP THE ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT FUNCTIONS<br />
AS THEY ARE AND TO HOPE THAT THE EXISTING SYSTEM<br />
CAN CONTINUE TO CREAK ALONG BY THE APPLICATION OF<br />
A BIT MORE OF THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY, IN EFFECT<br />
* THE LIBERALS ASK THE TAXPAYERS TO SUBSIDISE THE<br />
INEFFICIENCIES AND INEQUALITIES OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS<br />
AND TO MAKE GOOD THE LOSSES WHICH THOSE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
MAKE INEVITABLE, THAT IS THE APPROACH OF THE LIBERAL<br />
PREMIERS. IT ISN'T OUR APPROACH AND IT SHOULD NOT<br />
BE THE APPROACH OF ANY SECTION OF THE PARTY. ii I<br />
I I<br />

TWO GREAT DRAINS ON THE STATE BUDGETS ARE RAILWAYS<br />
SAND HOSPITALS.,<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES WE HAVE THE SITUATION IN BOTH<br />
THOSE AREAS OF MOUNTING LOSSES AND DECLINING SERVICES.<br />
' YET OUR EFFORTS TO HELP THE STATE GOVERNMENT<br />
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO HELP THE AUSTRALIANS<br />
WHO LIVE IN NEW SOUTH WALES GET BETTER SERVICES,<br />
:' MORE FAIRLY FINANCED, HAVE BEEN REJECTED OR<br />
. OBSTRUCTED.<br />
TOMORROW I SHALL BE ADDRESSSING THE SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONVENTION OF THE PARTY.<br />
I SHALL BE ABLE TO DRAW A GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN<br />
"-' THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO LABOR GOVERNMENTS<br />
IN CANBERRA AND ADELAIDE AS AGAINST THE<br />
OBSTRUCTIONISM OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT, I<br />

<p>N.. -9-<br />
S/ -t IN TERMS OF SHEER POLITICS, DON'T FORGET THAT THE<br />
NIEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT IS SHOWN BY THE POLLS TO<br />
BE THE MOST UNPOPULAR OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS,<br />
S" AND THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT IS FAR AND<br />
AWAY THE MOST POPULAR..<br />
' KNOCKING CANBERRA HAS NOT PAID OFF FOR MR LEWIS.<br />
IF IT WON'T WORK FOR AN ANTI-LABOR GOVERNMENT, IT'S<br />
NOT GOING TO WORK FOR ANY SECTION OF OUR OWN PARTY,<br />
THE OBSTRUCTION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES RANGES FROM PETTY<br />
CUSSEDNESS ON LITTLE MATTERS, TO GROSS IRRESPONSIBILITY<br />
. ON GREAT MATTERS, THERE ARE THINGS LIKE THE REFUSAL<br />
TO LET A NEW SOUTH WALES OFFICIAL TRAVEL ON A CULTURAL<br />
MISSION TO CHINA, OR THE REFUSAL TO LET AN OFFICIAL<br />
: ATTEND A MEETING OF A SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE INTERIM<br />
COMMITTEE FOR THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION.<br />
BUT THE TWO GREAT MATTERS, IN TERMS OF THEIR EFFECT<br />
ON THE PEOPLE AND THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECT ON THE STATE'S<br />
FINANCIAL POSITION ARE HOSPITALS AND RAILWAYS. THERE<br />
AGAIN, MARK THE CONTRAST WITH SOUTH AUSTRALIA, _. 1<br />
i 1<br />
I </p>
<p>-; 7 LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE OF THE STORY OF OUR PROPOSAL<br />
TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
RAILWAYS. IT WAS AN OFFER MADE IN THE POLICY SPEECH<br />
OF 1972, IN FEBRUARY 1973 I WROTE TO SIR ROBERT<br />
ASKIN CONFIRMING THAT PROMISE, IN MARCH HE<br />
AGREED TO OFFICIAL DISCUSSIONS, WITHOUT PRIOR<br />
COMMITMENT, TO CLARIFY THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN SUCH<br />
A TRANSFER. ' WHEN MR LEWIS BECAME PREMIER, HE<br />
BROKE OFF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THEY HAD BEEN<br />
FRUITFUL AND CONGENIAL BUT HE BROKE THEM OFF.<br />
IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, WE REACHED AGREEMENT FOR THE<br />
TRANSFER LAST YEAR. THE CONTRASTING RESULT<br />
IS THAT SOUTH AUSTRALIA SAVES $ 10 MILLION<br />
A YEAR AND NEW SOUTH WALES CONTINUES TO HAVE TO<br />
BEAR AN $ 80 . MILLION ANNUAL LOSS ON ITS RAILWAYS, o. </p>
<p>JUST BEAR THAT IN MIND NEXT WEEK WHEN MR LEWIS<br />
SQUAWKS ABOUT SO-CALLED CENTRALISM IN CANBERRA<br />
AND CANBERRA'S ALLEGED NEGLECT OF THE STATES.<br />
THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULARLY " CENTRALIST" ABOUT<br />
NATIONALLY-OPERATED RAILWAYS IT'S HARDLY<br />
A MATTER OF PHILOSOPHY ITS JUST COMMONSENSE.<br />
IN EVERY OTHER FEDERAL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD,<br />
RAILWAYS ARE RUN NATIONALLY,<br />
OUR RATIONAL APPROACH IS SHARED BY OUR PARTNERS<br />
IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, THE SAME OPPORTUNITY<br />
FOR BETTER SERVICES, FOR FAIRER AND SOUNDER<br />
FINANCES, IS THERE FOR NEW SOUTH WALES. THE<br />
PARTY HERE SHOULD SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVES, IT OFFERS A POSITIVE<br />
APPROACH TO THE QUESTION OF FEDERAL-STATE<br />
FINANCIAL RELATIONS, A WAY THROUGH THE CARPING<br />
AND CONFRONTATION WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF<br />
OUR OPPONENT'S APPROACH.<br />
L u i. t </p>
<p>-11-<br />
THE NEW SOUTH W'ALES GOVERNMENT'S RECORD ON HOSPITALS<br />
SIS EQUALLY OBSTRUCTIVE, A LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH<br />
BEFORE MEDIBANK WAS SCHEDULED TO COME INTO OPERATION<br />
!. ON THE 1ST JULY, AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS,<br />
MR LEWIS CAME UP WITH A NEW SET OF PROPOSALS THAT<br />
WOULD STRIKE AT THE FOUNDATION OF OUR HOSPITAL PROGRAM.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT IS TRYING<br />
TO SABOTAGE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE. THAT ANY PERSON IN<br />
NEED OF HOSPITAL TREATMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE<br />
BEST AVAILABLE TREATMENT FREE OF COST AND FREE OF<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO A MEDICAL FUND, THE NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS RESORTED TO A VERY EXTENSIVE PROPAGANDA<br />
CAMPAIGN TO JUSTIFY THIS SABOTAGE.<br />
" THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ASPECT OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND<br />
MOST OF THE CAMPAIGNS WAGED BY OPPONENTS OF OUR<br />
PROGRAM IS THAT THEY ALL RELY ON THE IDEA THAT THE<br />
SAUSTRALIAN PUBLIC KNOWS NOTHING AND REMEMBERS NOTHING.<br />
NEW TERRORS ARE DRUMMED UP TO CONDEMN PROPOSALS WHfCH<br />
ARE IN FACT VERY FAMILIAR TO THE PEOPLE. i<br />
a ' T </p>
<p>-12-<br />
FOR INSTANCE, WHY SHOULD A PUBLIC LONG ACCUSTOMED<br />
TO STATE GOVERNMENT INSURANCE OFFICES BE TERRIFIED AT<br />
THE PROSPECT OF AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INSURANCE<br />
CORPORATION? FOR ALL THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF<br />
DOLLARS SPENT ON THAT CAMPAIGN, IDON'T BELIEVE THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WERE A BIT IMPRESSED.<br />
THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T GET OFF THE GR OUND,<br />
NCW THERE 13 THIS LAST MINUTE ATTEMPT TO SABOTAGE<br />
fIEDIBANK, THE PLAIN FACT IS THAT AS FAR AS<br />
HOSPITAL BEDS A"-RE CONCERNED, OUR PROGRAM WILL SIMPLY<br />
RE-ESTABLISH WHAT EXISTED AND WORKED VERY SATISFACTORILY<br />
UNDER THE CHIFLEY GOVERNMENT -THE PROVISION OF FREE<br />
HOSPITAL TREATMENT IN PUBLIC WARDS,, FUNDED ON A<br />
50-50 BASIS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS. </p>
<p>I 7-77-<br />
I SAID BEFORE THAT THE GREAT THRUST OF OUR PROGRAM IS<br />
TO PROMOTE EQUALITY IN MATTERS LIKE SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS<br />
AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT, WE ARE STRIVING FOR SOCIAL<br />
EQUALITY. EQUALLY FUNDAMENTAL IS THE STRUGGLE FOR POLITICAL EQUALITY.<br />
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY HOW WE STILL ACCEPT THE DENIAL OF<br />
THIS BASIC RIGHT, A RIGHT WHICH HAS BEEN PART OF THE<br />
DEMOCRATIC RHETORIC FOR A CENTURY OR MORE YET<br />
-NEVER TRANSLATED INTO REALITY IN AUSTRALIA. IT IS<br />
EXTRAORDINARY HOW EVEN PEOPLE IN OUR OWN PARTY FAIL<br />
TO BE INCENSED BY THIS DENIAL, I<br />
TWO WEEKS AGO THE SENATE AGAIN REJECTED THE NEW<br />
REDISTRIBUTION A REDISTRIBUTION WHICH ON ANY GROUND<br />
IS THE FAIREST EVERY PRESENTED TO ANY AUSTRALIAN<br />
PARLIAMENT.<br />
WE HAD TWO DEBATES ON THE REDISTRIBUTIONn FIRST WE<br />
SUBMITTED THE ELECTORAL COMMISSIONERS' PROPOSALS TO<br />
THE PARLIAMENT. WHEN THEY WERE REJECTED WE SUBMITTED<br />
THEM IN THE FORM OF BILLS. BOTH THE PROPOSALS AND THE<br />
BILLS ARE DESIGNED TO EFFECTUATE THE LAW OF THE LAND<br />
A LAW ESTABLISHED AT THE JOINT SITTING OF BOTH HOUSES<br />
OF THE PARLIAMENT LAST AUGUST. THE LAW-SAYS THE NUMBERS<br />
OF VOTERS IN EACH ELECTORATE WITHIN A STATE SHALL NOT<br />
VARY BY MORE THAN 10% ABOVE OR BELOW THE QUOTA IN THAT<br />
STATE,'<br />
~ rt r </p>
<p>S14-<br />
IN BOTH THE DEBATES, NO SENIOR LIBERAL INTERVENED.<br />
THE LEAqERS LEFT IT UP TO THE MEMBER FOR BENNELONG<br />
NO A HOUSEHOLD WORD TO ARGUE THEIR CASE, SUCH<br />
S-AS .: IT WAS, AND NO WONDER. HOW COULD MR FRASER<br />
JUSTIFY TO HIS OWN SUPPORTERS THAT THEIR VOTE IN<br />
MITCHELL IS TO BE WORTH HALF THAT OF A PERSON VOTING<br />
SIN DARLING? . THAT ILLUSTRATES THE REAL POINT ABOUT<br />
ANY ELECTION HELD ON THE EXISTING BOUNDARIES.<br />
. THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR LABOR VOTERS AS AGAINST LIBERAL<br />
VOTERS; . THE PENALTY IS SPREAD INDISCRIMINATELY. ON<br />
SLABOR AND LIBERAL VOTERS ALIKE IF THEY HAVE. THE-.<br />
SMISFORTUNE TO LIVE IN THE PLACES WHERE MOST AUSTRALIANS,<br />
LIBERAL OR LABOR, LIVE.<br />
THROUGHOUT THE DEBATES THERE WAS NEVER ANY SUGGESTION<br />
THAT THE ELECTORAL COMMISSIONERS HAD NOT DONE A<br />
SCRUPULCUSLY FAIR JOB, IN EACH STATE THE COMMISSIONERS<br />
BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO BE FAIR, THE OBJECTION TO THEIR<br />
WORK WAS THAT THEY ADHERED TO THE LAW OF THE LAND, AS<br />
THEY WERE DUTY BOUND TO DO, THE OBJECTION TO THE<br />
REDISTRIBUTION WAS NOT ON ANY GROUNDS OF FAIRNESS . IT<br />
WAS AN OBJECTION TO ANY REDISTRIBUTION AT ALL. i I </p>
<p>THE FATE OF THE REDISTRIBUTION PROPOSALS IS THE CLASSIC<br />
EXAMPLE OF HOW A VERY SMALL BUT VERY VOCAL PRESSURE GROUP<br />
CAN SET ASIDE THE CLEAR WILL AND INTERESTS OF THE MAJORITY,<br />
IN THIS CASE ALREADY'EMBODIED IN THE LAW OF THE LAND.<br />
THE COUNTRY PARTY MADE ALL THE RUNNING AND WAS. ABLE TO<br />
GET ITS WAY EVEN THOUGH THE LIBERAL PARTY IS EVERY BIT<br />
AS MUCH A VICTIM OF THE PRESENT MALAPPORTIONMENT AS THE<br />
LABOR PARTY.<br />
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT A GREAT DEAL OF OUR<br />
PROGRAM IS THREATENED IN THE SAME WAY THE OPPONENTS ARE<br />
POWERFUL, WELL-ORGANISED ENTRENCHED; THE BENEFICIARIES<br />
ARE IN GENERAL NOT SO WELL ORGANISED, SO ARTICULATE,<br />
THEREFORE WE HAVE TO BE THE SPOKESMEN, NOT JUST IN<br />
OUR OWN CAUSE, BUT IN THEIR CAUSE,<br />
TAKE THE CASE OF THE HIGH COURT CHALLENGE SPONSORED BY<br />
THE NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIAN GOVERNMENTS AGAINST<br />
THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE<br />
PLAN AND THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEME.<br />
SOME 60 SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ARE IMPERILLED BY THE CHALLENGE.<br />
WHAT EACH HAS IN COMMON IS THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO<br />
BENEFIT THE WEAK AND UNDERPRIVILEGED IN THE COMMUNITY<br />
THE OLD, THE HANDICAPPED, ABORIGINES, MIGRANTS. </p>
<p>-16-<br />
STATE PERMIERS HAVE A READY MADE FORUM IN THE CAPITAL<br />
CITY-BASED NEWSPAPERS. THE PEOPLE ON WHOSE BEHALF<br />
WE ACT, DO NOT HAVE ANY SUCH VOICE. IF WE DON'T SPEAK<br />
UP FOR THEM, NO ONE ELSE WILL, IF WE DON'T SUPPORT<br />
AND DEFEND OUR OWN PROGRAM, NO-ONE ELSE WILL.<br />
THE INSURANCE OFFICES ARE WELL-ORGANISED, POLICY HOLDERS<br />
ARE NOT. THE AMA, IS ARTICULATE. THE MILLION<br />
AUSTRALIANS WHO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE ARE NOT,<br />
WE HAVE IN OUR'RANKS MANY OF THE MOST ARTICULATE PEOPLE<br />
IN AUSTRALIA. IT IS OUR DUTY TO MOBILISE OUR<br />
OWN RESOURCES AND TALENTS IN DEFENCE OF THE PROGRAM. I </p>
