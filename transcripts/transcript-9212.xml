TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAMI 7: 30 REPORT, 4 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: We'll go now to the Prime Minister who has just joined me here in the<br />
studio. Mr Keating, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Thanks Paul.<br />
PL: Chifley had a vision. Where's Paul Keating's vision in all this?<br />
PM Well, the vision here is of a cohesive society where we don't take the<br />
callous view that half a million people, lo~ ng. 4erfrLuner( npoyq1, pqople<br />
can be the people who carry the burden of economic change and you<br />
keep a society, you keep a country together by letting everybody<br />
believe they are part of it. And this is particularly so with young people<br />
so that they don't grow up believing they are alienated and that no one*<br />
is interested in them.<br />
PL: But, you've produced more Budgets and statements and packages<br />
than most of us have had hot dinners over the years. Doesn't this<br />
suggest it's taking a hell of a long time to get this right?<br />
PM: Paul look, the Australian economy today is not to be compared with<br />
what it was 10 years go. I mean, it's exporting its head off.-It has got a<br />
2 per cent inflation rate, it is growing at 4 per cent. We've had two<br />
million job growth in the ten years, we had a work force of 6 million in<br />
1953, we've got a work force now of over 8 million. Employment is<br />
going to pick up again strongly, but it is not right and it--is-ndt dieent<br />
and it is not efficient to leave a large body of people untrained,<br />
unc-ared for, unthought of. Now, this program; we are going to be<br />
personally case managing 504,000 people next year.<br />
PL: This is really one-on-one stuff is it? </p>
<p>PM: One on one 504,000, I mean, if that's not a vision of getting people<br />
back into the mainstream of Australian society I don't know what is. I<br />
mean, I don't want to see Australian cities like New York or Los<br />
Angeles.<br />
PL: I'm sure no Australian does.<br />
PMV: No, and the way not to do it is to reach out to the unemployed and to<br />
give them this work experien0ce and to train them and to give them self<br />
esteem and confidence and competence and see them taken up<br />
because, I think, in this recovery another point that needs to be made<br />
Paul is this, that the complement toA~ jI1~ formation, when we are going<br />
to need skills in this recovery is not going to come from migration, it is<br />
going to come from within Australia. In part, it is going to come from<br />
that pool of long-term unemployed people.<br />
PL: And If we start running into skills shortages then we are going to end<br />
up with a bit of a bottle neck?<br />
PM: If we run into skills shortages, you'll have wage cost pressures and<br />
you'll have higher inflation. So, the way to deal with it is to get this<br />
pool of under employed resources and unemployed people trained and<br />
back into the mainstream labour market.<br />
PL: All right, while we're on the big picture, the long bond rates hit an 18<br />
month high, they went into panic mode this afternoon after your<br />
statement.<br />
PM: No they didn't.<br />
PL: Well.<br />
PM: Look, they have been rising for a couple of weeks on notions of what<br />
the American Federal Reserve Bank is doing and frankly, here we are<br />
when the low inflation rate came out last week at 2 per cent, it made<br />
monkeys of them. I mean, the long term bond market has got no<br />
credibility..<br />
PL: This document, Prime Minister, the cost of the White Paper measures<br />
are covered by the growth dividend, this leaked draft of the Budget. Is<br />
that right?<br />
PM. That document, God knows how old it is. It is as old as Methuselah I<br />
think given what's in it. It bears no relationship to the Budget, but I<br />
made the point very clear in the statement today, Paul. When one<br />
makes the judgenment of saying is the economic efficiency and equity<br />
point of picking up the young people of Australia between 15 and<br />
and the long term unemployed and giving them a place in our society<br />
and growth in our economy and a complement to the labour market </p>
<p>better than the short term financing effects of another $ 1.7 billion off<br />
the Budget. There is no judgement to be made, none what so ever.<br />
PL: But we have got six days now until the Budget. Are you going to be<br />
able to assure the markets that interest rates don't have to go up again<br />
because we could jeopardise growth, the real growth and prosperity<br />
we need to get real jobs in there.<br />
PM: Paul, just ' on the markets. The market has got the long bond rate now<br />
at well over 8.5 per cent. We have got a 2 per cent inflation rate, we<br />
have got a real rate of interest of 7.5 per cent. The average real rate<br />
of interest in the last 30 years was about 4 to 4.5 per cent. It is the<br />
bond market that has basically got to wake up to the fact this is not the<br />
United States, that what the US Federal Reserve does has nothing to<br />
do with Australia's inflation rate and that the Government will bring in<br />
the Budget, as I say in this White Paper, and meet its target of a<br />
Budget deficit of around 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97.<br />
PL: And will the cost of the White Paper measures today be covered by<br />
the growth dividend, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: It will be covered by the things which any sensible society, the<br />
resources, any sensible, efficient, compassionate society would spend<br />
on its people who are carrying the brunt of unemployment. All these<br />
people who incode say, I mean, Professor Sloane, she Is confused<br />
about whether it is young people or It is all about saying, " look,<br />
forget them", she talked about substitutions forget them. You forget<br />
them and you end up with a Los Angeles on your hands.<br />
PL: Yes, but there is going to be churning Isn't there?<br />
PM; That's what happens to you, you end up with someone breaking your<br />
window in.<br />
PL: But, there is going to be a lot of displacement. People will displace<br />
others in this.<br />
PM: But, we'll have in a strong economy with low inflation a lot of aggregate<br />
employment growth and that is the key point. But, are these people<br />
entitled to be part of the stream? Well, the answer is of course they<br />
are.<br />
PL: To what extent though will all these training schemes and so on mask<br />
the real level of unemployment? Your critics say it is another Keating<br />
' ace up the sleeve trick'.<br />
PM. There wouldn't be an OECD government, a western government,<br />
undertaking a package of this size and this comprehension. It is only<br />
in this country that you can get a nit-picking debate on this sort of<br />
thing. </p>
<p>PL: Well, Margaret Thatcher is pretty good at massaging the figures, some<br />
say you are learning tricks from her.<br />
PM: Well, after that load of old codswallop you started with at this program<br />
. I mean, that Is the most absolutely irrelevant statistic I have ever<br />
seen in my life, but anyway..<br />
PL: What. the manufacturing trade deficit has no relevance Or did you<br />
see the figures today?<br />
PM; You are trying to outdo Elle McFeast. You better make your mind up<br />
whether you are in entertainment or news, Paul.<br />
PL: OK, well how entertaining were the trade figures today the<br />
merchandise trade figures?<br />
PM: I'll just give you a couple of simple numbers. Manufacturing production<br />
has doubled since 1983. Manufacturing exports have tripled since<br />
1983 80 per cant of our economic growth comes out of services not<br />
manufacturing. That chart is completely Irrelevant.<br />
PL: And what did the figures show us today. We had merchandise exports<br />
up 5 per cent and Imports up 13 per cent. r-1-<br />
PMV: I don't mind you trying to make a sensible point, but why make a daft<br />
point? We are all short of time. We are all busy, why make a dumb<br />
point?<br />
PL: Because the point is our economic future..<br />
PM. Because you don't know what the real point is.<br />
PL: Our economic future is determined by our export performance. You<br />
keep telling us we have got a record deficit in manufacturing trade.<br />
PM: Paul, 10 years ago we exported 14 per cent of all we produce. What is<br />
it today? 21 per cent.<br />
PL: Record deficit.<br />
F M: Today. What's today mean in the long you mean, one month's<br />
balance of payments numbers?<br />
PL: No, we have a record deficit 1992-93. It has been getting worse as<br />
you see there.<br />
PM.-That is the manufacturing sector, but what about the mining sector, the<br />
agriculture and services. As Professor Sloan said why point to that? </p>
<p>PL: it is one part of<br />
PM: Paul, look, I don't want to have a silly argument about a silly point. Let<br />
me just make this clear that the Australian Chamber of Manufactures<br />
said today the job compact will ensure that a persons need to find a<br />
job will merge sweetly with an employers need to fill one. The Metals<br />
Trades Industry Association said they regard the Government's White<br />
Paper, ' Working Nation', as a constructive contribution to public policy<br />
which will provide new directions for industry et cetera. This is fulfilling<br />
the commitment the Government made during the election and on<br />
election night to keep faith with the unemployed, to have a more fair<br />
and equal society and a more efficient one. That is the point of today's<br />
message.<br />
PL: Thank you, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
