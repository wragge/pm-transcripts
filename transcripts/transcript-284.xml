PRIME INISTER' S AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
On<br />
Australian conference Sunday, March 19, the Prime Minister, Mr.<br />
Press in conference at the Savoy Hotel.<br />
follows Menzies, received the<br />
A transcript of the<br />
MR. MvENZIES:" I notice that there is a good deal of speculation, and<br />
perhaps something more, about the final stages of this<br />
conference, so perhaps I might as well add my own little<br />
bit to it. For some time it looked as if we could<br />
evolve a form of communique which would confirm South<br />
Africa's membership, while at the same time containing<br />
a fair summarised statement of the criticisms of South<br />
Africa's racial policy and of Dr. Verwoerdts reply.<br />
In point of fact as I have followed this and I took a<br />
very active part in it, in drafting various things Dr.<br />
Verwoerd was at first very reluctant to adopt the form<br />
of communique that was suggested because he felt that it<br />
was too much like a concerted judgment on South African<br />
policy, the language ho thought being put in a rather too<br />
positive way. Ultimately, after considering his<br />
position, he agreed TUhat the communique should go out in<br />
that fashion. And quite frankly, I thought at that<br />
time that the problem looked as if it were over. But<br />
when he announced, or Mr. Macmillan announced, that he<br />
was agreeable to a communique of this kind, he was<br />
promptly told by several of the Prime Ministers that it<br />
was not good enough. One or two of them indicated quite<br />
plainly that they did not accept his continued membership;<br />
that if it became necessary to move for the expulsion of<br />
South Africa they would do so. At least half the Prime<br />
Ministers there made it clear that they would pursue this<br />
matter evory time there was a meeting, and between<br />
meetings, on any convenient opportunity.<br />
" In other words, looking at the substance of the matter at<br />
least half the Prime Ministers there indicated that they<br />
did not want South Africa in. Dr. Verwoerd I thought,<br />
with very great dignity, accepted the logic of that<br />
position and indicated that he would withdraw his<br />
application. Personally I don't think he had any choice.<br />
I would have withdrawn the application had I been in his<br />
place. " One reason I know he had in his mind, I thought did him<br />
very great credit; that was, that if he had remained and<br />
in some way or other his application for contined<br />
memborship had been agreed to I don't undertake to say<br />
how it could have been under these circumstances but<br />
suppose in some way or other it had, then he would have<br />
remained in and would have divided his colleagues into<br />
those who would continue to want to be rid of him, and these<br />
who would continue to want to have South Africa as a<br />
member of the Commonwealth. Rather than expose the </p>
<p>-2<br />
rest of' us to that risk, he decided to remove his<br />
application and avoid that possibility.<br />
" I1 think, of course, that this is the most unhappy<br />
affair. I make no secret of my own view. I<br />
wanted to koep South Africa in. Last year at the<br />
Conference we all agreed that South Africa's racial<br />
policy was a matter of domestic jurisdiction. We<br />
all agreed and that was why we did not discuss it in<br />
full conference. Quite true there has been a good<br />
deal of international argument about it since, but it<br />
will be remembered that the former Prime Ministers'<br />
conference was after the incidents at Sharpeville and<br />
after there had been world-wide reaction,, and we all<br />
agreed, upon that occasion, that this was a matter of'<br />
domestic jurisdiction. This year Dr. Verwoerd<br />
indicated that he would waive that point because he<br />
thought that we ought to clear our minds a'.~ out the<br />
question of policy. He did not abandon the<br />
proposition that it was domestic, but he said ( in<br />
effect), ' Very well, I am prepared to sit in here<br />
and now and have an argument about it'. And he<br />
expressed his own case very powerfully and at<br />
considerable length. But even though there has been<br />
a great deal of international agitation this is still<br />
a matter of domestic policy in South Africa. South<br />
Africa doesn't seek to apply thai policy to any other<br />
country. It is as much a matter of domestic poli~ cy<br />
for South Africa as Australia's migration policy<br />
is a domestic matter for us. And to have a<br />
member of the Commonwealth virtually excluded from the<br />
Commonwealth on a matter of domestic policy, presents in<br />
my opinion, a rather disagreeable vista of possibilities<br />
f or the future. We may object very strongly to racial<br />
discrimination practiced in one country. We might<br />
equally object very strongly to the absence of any form<br />
of democracy in another; we might take exception to the<br />
absence of parliamentary machinery, or the presence of<br />
imprisonment without trial; or any of these things that<br />
lend themselves to exam-ination if we adopt the attitude<br />
that one of our tasks is to examine each other's<br />
policies. A. nd that is why I think this is a very<br />
unhappy development.<br />
" It is quite true that every Prime Minister except the<br />
Prime 1Minister of South Africa was critical of all or<br />
some aspects of South Africa's policy. I don't need<br />
to go into that with any elaboration, but I have up to<br />
now acted on the principle which I believe is sound<br />
that I do not make public comments on the policies of<br />
another member of the Commonwealth; a very good oldfashioned<br />
rule that, and it did a lot of good when it<br />
used to be practiced. But since the thing is all<br />
out now and this has been thrashed out and most people<br />
have made statements about it, I just want to say this:<br />
My objection to the poliz3y of apartheid is, in simple<br />
terms, that in my opinion it won't work. It is a<br />
policy of separate development. It is a policy that<br />
accepts that the white man occupies the superior<br />
po~ itirn. In other word'it is the same policy that<br />
existed in all colonial establishments until a few years<br />
ago. The South African Prime Minister says, and with<br />
great sincerity he is a man of singular integrity, a<br />
most impressive man He says: ' We are spending far more<br />
money on education and health for the Bantu population<br />
than any other African community.' That is quite right;<br />
he h-ad figures to support it. He indicates that every<br />
step is being taken to raise the living and the<br />
educational standards of the Bantu. That is very good.<br />
Excellent. But I don't lelieve that when that object </p>
<p>-3<br />
has been achieved, the Bantu is going to be satisfied<br />
and adopt the second rate position in the general social<br />
structure or in the political structure of South Africa.<br />
In other words the more this policy succeeds, in a sense<br />
the more certain is it to fail in the long run. Now<br />
that's a purely practical abjection. I have not,. like<br />
some, moralised about this matter. That, in brief, is<br />
my view as to why their policy is wrong. Of course it<br />
has some, to me, some inexplicable detailed consequences.<br />
" I told Dr. Verwoerd that I just did not begin to<br />
understand why he adopted the view that there should not<br />
be an exchange of diplomatic missions with other African<br />
and Asian members of the Commonwealth. I said we did<br />
that kind of thing very successfully in Canberra and<br />
nobody see-med to be very concerned about it. We ate in<br />
each othei's houses and so on. But he had his own reasons<br />
, and he said that it could not be done. I thought that,<br />
psychologically, this had a bad effect. You know, that<br />
seemned to be carrying it a bit too far."<br />
" How do you see the future, relationship of South Africa with<br />
other Commonwealth countries?<br />
" Well, I'm very troubled about it because a lot of people<br />
don't understand anything about the Commonwealth. They<br />
seem to think the British Commonwealth is a court of morals<br />
or law. You sit down and sit in judgment on each other.<br />
It never was so. You meet to discover what you agree<br />
about, not to discover what you disagree about. I spoke<br />
about this last year in the Smuts lecture. We are not<br />
sitting in judgment on one another. That is not the point.<br />
We can talk very intimately and frankly with each other.<br />
We learn a lot from each other. Occasionally you go away<br />
and find that your mind has been influenced more than you<br />
thought by something that was said. But there it is.<br />
Apparently, the character of our deliberations is. to be<br />
changed. I think it a great pity. But in parti cular,<br />
this is the last time we will ever have a discussion on<br />
racial policy in the Commonwealth itself; in a meeting of<br />
Primne Ministers. South Africa is out. Somebody may<br />
want to discuss the racial policy of some othei: member of<br />
the Ccmmonwealth,' but so far as South AJfrica is concerned,<br />
we will never have a discussion of this kind again.<br />
Now the discussion is going on. The passions of other<br />
people were roused on this matter and they won't be<br />
silenced. But instead of having the discussion in a<br />
meeting of a limited number of heads of Governments, who<br />
are men of experience and restraint, this thing will now<br />
be put into the United Nations; it will be debated hotly<br />
in the General Alssembly; it will be transferred in other<br />
words to areas where there will be much less restraint and<br />
much more passion, I think that is a pity a gieat pity.<br />
" There is one other point I would like to make about my<br />
approach to this refusal of membership or expulsion. You<br />
don't -admit a Government to the Commonwealth, you admit a<br />
nation. The other day we didn't admit Archbishop<br />
Makarios, we admitted Cyprus; and one of the foundation<br />
members of the Commonwealth is South A-frica South Africa<br />
the nation. We did not admit only those people who had a<br />
vote, to wit the Europeans, we admitted the whole who<br />
included nine million Bantu. True, they don't have the<br />
vote. But there are one or two other Commonwealth<br />
countries in which the voters are by no means in the<br />
majority let us put it as delicately as possible. You<br />
don't, in due course, put out the Verwoerd Government, you<br />
put out South A" frica all of its people. How do we<br />
know whether the Bantu, as they come along, are not very<br />
very hopeful of such protection as they can get by the<br />
QUESTION: </p>
<p>-4<br />
Commonwealth association? I don't know, but I can guess<br />
that they might be. How do we know what the attitude<br />
is of people who are for the time being in the minority<br />
among the voters people who support the Opposition in<br />
South AIfrica? Governments come and go; that is a very<br />
healthy reflection. But, in effect, South AIfrica has<br />
gone, includling all those who are ' pro' this policy and<br />
those who are against it, and those who are pro the<br />
Government, anr3thcse who are against the Government. I<br />
think that misconceives the nature of the Commonwealth;<br />
the Commonwelth as I have known it for many years at any<br />
rate."<br />

" Teanswer was a lemon. That didn't cut any ice".<br />
" Do ycu thidkthat she's out fcr good now?"<br />
' Well, frankly, I do. If I were being very tactful now I<br />
would say ' Well, of course, in a year or two you will be<br />
back with us'. But the world doesn't work that way.<br />
Nor do I think that this decision is likely to have a<br />
tempering effect upon South Afi-ican racial policy. it<br />
may very well stiffen thcir attitude. I don't know.<br />
I hope not. But it's possible.<br />
" Dr. Verwoerd has referred to venomous attacks from the<br />
Africans, the A1sians, and he also included Caad"<br />
" No I won't namXe any names, butv certainly the most extreme<br />
speeches were made at the very closing stages, at this time<br />
when I thought we were probably going to get by with a<br />
statement of the criticisms and the answers, and with<br />
continuance of membership. ' Venomous' is not my word,<br />
but there were very pungent attacks made then, as I said."<br />
" Sir, on this precedent, do you fear any attacks possibly<br />
on Australia's migration policy?"<br />
" Well, once the precedent -Ls established it's obviously a<br />
possibility". " Was there any hint of that?"<br />
" Oh, no. From nobody. They all-concentrated this time<br />
on the one thing. I made a glancing reference to it<br />
myself".<br />
' What would our attitude be if<br />
" That is like, ' If<br />
I can't answer that<br />
they know what mine<br />
mightn't be there".<br />

with cur new foreign government -I take it that the ( South<br />

sttu" " Yes, We've never contemplated any of these things like<br />
boycotts or things of that kind. Somebody did suggest<br />
very powerfully that we ought to boycott South 1frica, so<br />
I sent around word to find out what things we bought from<br />
South Africa. What were the main items? When I got the<br />
answer back it turned out that ninety per cent. of the people<br />
engaged in the production of those things were black people.<br />
I said I didn't think there was much sernse in penalising<br />
these fellows under the guise of helping them. I don't<br />
think economic measures are going to be taken in Australia; </p>
<p>certainly not by us".<br />

ESTION ANSWER: QUESTION: " Is there any indication how other members of the<br />
Commonwealth might feel about the continuation of<br />
Commonwealth preferences. They apply mainly of course<br />
to Britain, we know that. They do give South Africa<br />
the same privileges in the British market as we enjoy,<br />
and Now Zealand."<br />
" I would be guessing if I tried to speculate about that.<br />
No doubt there will be a lot of consequential matters<br />
that have to be looked into. I don't think most of<br />
us have had time to think about those yet".<br />
" Mr. Menzies, two or three of the Sunday papers today<br />
refer to the possibility of a visit by the Queen to<br />
Australia fairly soon. I wonder if you have any<br />
comment on that?"<br />
" When was a Sunday paper without that atty You know<br />
my rule on this matter. I am having a discussion with<br />
the Queen about Royal visits in general; you know, trying<br />
to look ahead, but that is as far as it has gone. But<br />
any announcement of those things is to be made, as always,<br />
by the Palace, not by me. Nor do I want to infer that<br />
we are likely to have any early visit by a member of the<br />
Royal family. I have a list of requests that I brought<br />
with me that I am going to discuss with the Queen next<br />
week". " Can you give any indication, Sir, as to when the name of<br />
the new Governor-General will be announced?"<br />
" No. I wish I knew the name of the new Governor-General.<br />
Until I know that, I can't put a timetable on it".<br />
" It still hasn't been settled then?"<br />
" No" l<br />
" Will you be seeing the Queen again before you leave?"<br />
" Yes".<br />
" Do you know what date?"<br />
ANSWER: QUESTION: ANSWER: " On Friday".<br />
" Coming back to the Conference, Mr. Menzies. There is a<br />
reference from Melbourne saying that there is a debate<br />
boiling up now on you taking the lead in arguing the<br />
constitutional objection to interference in South Africals<br />
internal affairs; it is suggested that you may have taken<br />
on yourself a role which will be difficult to explain to<br />
our Asian neighbours. Do you foresee any difficulty in<br />
that?" " Not at all. That sounds almost like one of the Sydney<br />
papers which has a bee in its bonnet on that problem. I<br />
must say I find no difficulty whatever in explaining<br />
myself to our AfSrican and Asian neighbours in conference<br />
none. We are on the best of terms. Anyhow, my<br />
principal duty and role is to express the mind of my own<br />
Government, not the mind of other Governments. When I<br />
am no longer able to do that, I will go out." </p>
<p>4 -6<br />
" Mr. Menzies, can you tell us anything of your<br />
discussions with Dr. Luns of the Dutch Government on the<br />
future of Dutoh Now Guinea?" 1<br />
" Will you mrake any comment, Sir, an the latest position<br />
of West New Gune?<br />
" As~ far<br />
been no<br />
time. as I know, the position is as it was. There has<br />
change. Our policy has been stated time after<br />
There is no change in that."<br />
QUESTION: ANSWER: VOICES:<br />
0 " It seems to be a little hotter than it was".<br />
" Well, you know, we keep on getting stois about that.<br />
Anyhow, I have nothing to say about that. Right?"<br />
" Thank you, Sir". ( Conference closed).<br />
