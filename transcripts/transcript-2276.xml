TENTH F. A. O. REGIONAL CONFERENCE<br />
FOR ASIA AND THE FAR EAST<br />
Canberra, ACT 27 AUGUST 1970<br />
Speech b the Prime Ministers Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr. Wells, Mr. Anthony, Ministerial Colleagues, Federal and State,<br />
Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It is not my function today to open this Conference, because that is the<br />
role of my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry. But it is my function to<br />
welcome you all here. It is my function and my pleasure to do so in the name of<br />
the Australian Government and the Australian nation.<br />
I think we are privileged to have you here in our national capital for<br />
this Tenth Regional Conference which is the first such Regional Corfere-. ce to be<br />
held in Australia but not I hope, and I am sure the last. And from nherever<br />
you have travelled to be here today, you and we have one objective in common, one<br />
thing in mind which we hope we may advance towards as a result of thic Conference,<br />
and that is the eventual elimination of hunger amongst mankind, and therefore the<br />
improvement of the health and the wellbeing of mankind throughout the world.<br />
My own country is proud to be associated with the work of the Food and<br />
Agriculture Organisation and it gives me today an opportunity to pay tribute to the<br />
contribution made by the FAO over the past quarter of a century. I know you<br />
already have a planned programme covering the next fifteen years and we wish<br />
you well in this vital and humane task.<br />
It is a matter of some pride with us, if you will forgive a little national<br />
sentiment on an international occasion, that one of our earlier Prime Ministers,<br />
the late Lord Bruce, in other capacities, was closely associated with the foundation<br />
days of FAO. Way back in the " Hungry Thirties", at the old League of Nations in<br />
Geneva, in 1935, Lord Bruce made the plea: " Let the nations of the world<br />
collaborate to provide sufficient food to avoid hunger". That was the challenge<br />
which, at a later date, and in another forum, was taken up, and so FAG was born<br />
with Lord Bruce as the first Chairman of its Advisory Committee the World<br />
Food Council. That same continuing challenge brings us all here today and my nation<br />
today has that same approach as Lord Bruce had when he was our Prime Minister<br />
so long ago. I believe that communication, partnership and participation amongst<br />
nations are the key factors in trying to meet this very great challenge. We have<br />
got to communicate across the distances that separate us. There is no room for<br />
isolationism of thinking in this field in the world today or, indeed, in any field. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
And so we must share our knowledge and learn from each other's experiences, and<br />
learn from each other's adv nces and learn from each other's mistakes. And<br />
how better can we do it than by constant contact between officials of our Governments<br />
and by meetings such as this today.<br />
For our part, partnership is a first principle in many fields bilaterally,<br />
within regional and special bodies like ECAFE and FAO, and globally through the<br />
United Nations community Pi. d many trading, commodity and other arrangements<br />
of one kind or another.<br />
And in the Asian region which is still predominantly agricultural,<br />
we in Australia see ourselves as joined with you in a partnership which will be<br />
directly involved with the rest of the world in the forthcoming Second Development<br />
Deca: e promoted by the United Nations. What we have already tried to do in this<br />
region, what we are now trying to do despite the difficulties which hamper us and<br />
you and they are considerable may, I hope, offer lessons for other regions<br />
and for the world at large, for co-operation as the decade unfolds, to attack the<br />
great problems which face mankind.<br />
But we have to remember that in this region we have the most diverse<br />
assembly of peoples, cultures, resources and standards of living in the world,<br />
the most diverse. And the world itself is caught up with a population explosion<br />
cf gigantic proportions. There is much to be done. There is a daunting task<br />
facing this conference and those of us who are interested. The gap between the<br />
hungry and the satisfied is still very wide and that, Mr. President, brings me<br />
to participation. This, of course, is what gives meaning to a partnership. Ln simple<br />
terms, it means to use an Australian colloquialism " let's be in it", and the<br />
fact that we are all here today is evidence enough, I think, that we are all'In it".<br />
Perhaps, I might mention indeed most of you would know that just<br />
before this conference we had here in Canberra the Third Far East Regional<br />
Conference of the Freedom From Hunger Campaign. This campaign gets<br />
eno mous support in Australia because everybody can be in it. Australians as<br />
individuals give generously in this extra effort to tackle the world's food<br />
problems. And I like to feel that we here have some direct understanding of the<br />
problems of the developing countries in our region because of our own responsibilities<br />
not only in tl he. gion, not specifically to developing countries in the region who are<br />
away from us, but particularly because of our close partnership with the<br />
Territories of Papua and New Guinea. / 3 </p>
<p>I like to feel that here, too, in that area we are communicating with<br />
the people, under difficulties there are always difficulties when peoples seek<br />
to communicate but we are communicating, we are trying to be in partnership<br />
and participating in the development of their nationhood and of their capacity to<br />
help in this great task of providing food for the hungry millions of the world.<br />
Now, Sir, I feel that the time has come for me to finish, but in doing<br />
so, I would just like to add this. There is taking place in Asia now what we all<br />
know as a " green revolution". The earth is yielding more for its people in<br />
response to planned programmes and applied skills but success has also brought<br />
its problems. The world prices of basic foods are falling. Export markets<br />
are shrinking. There are new exportable surpluses in some countries and there<br />
is ar unsatisfied demand for fertilisers and for other assistance to growing food<br />
and this while millions still go hungry. And so we have surpluses of rice stored<br />
in Japan enough for perhaps two years' consumption for its people; surpluses<br />
of wheat being raised in Australia, surpluses in other countries, while so many<br />
still go hungry. So the task is to secure a proper balance for our agricultural<br />
economies in the region. I think we should perhaps place more emphasi" on<br />
industrial crops, on the development of forest products, for example, and to<br />
encourage industries linked to agriculture to provide work for the people and<br />
new products to export. This, I think, would go hand in hand, perhaps, with<br />
the correction of the imbalance between export surpluses of food and the lack of<br />
capacity of so many people to have food.<br />
Aid side by side with this, there must be that participation, that<br />
partnership, that sharing of knowledge of which I have already spoken.<br />
If this can come about and I believe it can not without e-ffort, not<br />
without thought, not without time, not without difficulty, but if it can come about,<br />
then the world will be a happier and a richer place for us all. And those who give<br />
their time and effort to this task and to discussions with their colleagues -such<br />
as take place here today, will have played a real part in making the world a<br />
happier and richer place for us all.<br />
So I repeat my welcome A very warm welcome to you all, and I<br />
wish you in which I include us every success in our deliberations. </p>
