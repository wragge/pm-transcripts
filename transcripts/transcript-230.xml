COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA. PZ/<br />
STATEMENT BY<br />
The PRIME MINISTER, the Rt. Hon.<br />
R. G. MENZIES, M. P.,<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 20th October, 1960.]<br />
Mr. MIENZIFS .( Kooyong-Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for External Affairs)<br />
-by leave-Sir, I arrived at the United<br />
Nations General Assembly on the afternoon<br />
of Friday, 30th September. The general<br />
debate was on. President Soekarrio spoke<br />
for two hours. He circulated a copy of<br />
his speech. The speech consisted of 66<br />
pages of foolscap. There was an added slip<br />
circulated. It was marked ." Vital and<br />
was to be inserted at page 65. This sheet<br />
contained the terms of the proposed fivepower<br />
resolution, of which I became aware<br />
' for the ' first time, the five powers being<br />
Ghana, India, the United Arab Republic,<br />
8764/ 60. Yugoslavia and Indonesia. The terms of<br />
the proposed resolution were these-<br />
The General Assembly<br />
Deeply concerned with the recent deterioration<br />
in international relations which threatens the<br />
world with grave consequences<br />
Aware of the great expectancy of the world<br />
that this Assembly will assist in helping to prepare<br />
the way for the easing of world tension<br />
Conscious of the grave and urgent responsibility<br />
that rests on the United Nations to initiate<br />
helpful efforts<br />
Requests, as a first urgent step, the President<br />
of the United States of America and the Chairman<br />
of the Council of Ministers of the Union of<br />
Soviet Socialist Republics to renew their contacts<br />
interrupted recently so that their declared willingness<br />
to find solutions of the outstanding problems<br />
by negotiation may be progressively implemented. </p>
<p>For some reason my distinguished friend,<br />
the Prime Minister of India, rose at the end<br />
of President Soekarno's speech and formally<br />
moved the resolution. I was, I confess,<br />
greatly concerned about the terms of the<br />
resolution, not because of its opening paragraphs,<br />
with which everybody would agree,<br />
but because Jof the operative clause, that<br />
opertive clause being the request that the<br />
President of the United States of America<br />
-named as such-and the Chairman of the<br />
Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet<br />
Socialist Republics should renew their<br />
contacts. That was a very, very important proposal.<br />
First of all, it had defects and it had<br />
dangers. " To renew their contacts, interrupted<br />
recently" was a clear reference, if<br />
to anything, back to the Paris conference<br />
when there was to be a summit conference,<br />
when the four people were to meet. That<br />
was the only period of interruption, and the<br />
contacts which were interrupted were interrupted<br />
at Paris when those four great men<br />
were to meet. Yet, Sir, the resolution moved<br />
by Mr. Nehru did not call for a summit<br />
meeting of the four; it called for something<br />
quite different. It did not call on the four<br />
great men, the four responsible men, the<br />
four men who led atomic. powers, to meet<br />
again; it called on two people out of the<br />
four. That seemed to me to lend colour<br />
to what I believe to be the false but not<br />
uncommon propaganda that the real world<br />
issue is between the Soviet Union and the<br />
United States of America.<br />
The first real step was to get the four<br />
atomic powers, the four powers which have,<br />
beyond all understanding, the great powers<br />
of peace and war in their hands, to meet.<br />
I would have thought that that was the first<br />
thing-to get those four people to come<br />
together, not because of some oddities about<br />
Great Britain or the United States or France<br />
-not at all-but because they happened to<br />
be the people who had atomic weapons and<br />
who, therefore, had enormous powers of<br />
life and death for all the rest of us in the<br />
world. Something could come, from my<br />
point of view, of a meeting between the<br />
four; nothing could come of a resolution<br />
which'said: that two out of the four ought<br />
to meet'together.<br />
That reolution was moved, and then the<br />
distinguished Prime" Minister of Great Britain, the Right Honorable Fld.<br />
Macmillan, and I-he very naturally, and I<br />
by some chance-were invited to come to<br />
Washington to see the President of the<br />
United States early on Sunday morning,<br />
2nd October. Very naturally we agreed.<br />
We said we would go.<br />
On Saturday, 1st October, I had lunch<br />
with Mr. Macmillan and with Lord Home.<br />
We had a little talk and we then flew to<br />
Washington. I dined with them at the<br />
Australian Embassy, with our Ambassador,<br />
Mr. Harold Beale. We dined, and we talked<br />
about these matters. Like me, they were<br />
troubled about the resolution-and they<br />
were troubled about it for very obvious<br />
reasons. Straight-out support of the resolution<br />
would be travelling, we all thought,<br />
in the wrong direction. Here was a resolution<br />
which said, " Let two people get<br />
together and then everything may be<br />
arranged But, on the other hand, straightout<br />
opposition-if we all voted " No"-<br />
would be misinterpreted. People would<br />
look at the first three or four recitals in the<br />
resolution, all in favour of peace, and then,<br />
if we voted " No we would be told that<br />
we did not want peace. Therefore, straightout<br />
opposition would be misinterpreted.<br />
That was a very difficult problem, Sir. I<br />
suggested on the Saturday night that an<br />
amendment in positive terms might be put,<br />
and my distinguished friends, Mr. Macmillan<br />
and Lord Home, having heard what<br />
1 had to say about this matter, said that they<br />
would like to think it over. On the next<br />
morning at 9.30-a rather intolerable hour<br />
on Sunday morning-we went to the White<br />
House. My former colleague, our distinguished<br />
Ambassador, Mr. Beale, was<br />
there, and we had a close discussion-<br />
President Eisenhower; Mr. Herter, the<br />
Secretary of State; Mr. Macmillan the distinguished<br />
Prime Minister of Great Britain;<br />
Lord Home, the Foreign Secretary, and<br />
myself. I think, Sir, that I might be allowed to<br />
say that that morning, and under those<br />
circumstances, the Americans were worried<br />
about the position that had been created by<br />
the five-power motion. The President himself<br />
had received letteirs from the five<br />
powers-India, Indonesia, Ghana, Yougoslavia<br />
and the United Arab ' Republicenclosing<br />
the resolution. The President had </p>
<p>bteen working on a draft reply setting out<br />
reasons why a personal and special meeting<br />
wvith Khrushchev was not, in the then atmosphere,<br />
acceptable. I would not wish honorable<br />
members to believe that this was A<br />
rather dour attitude on the part of the<br />
United States of America. All who have<br />
witnessed these things know th at<br />
Khrushchev had made it just about as<br />
difficult as anybody could make it for a<br />
meeting to occur.<br />
In the course of the talks on the Sunday<br />
morning, I said-and let me say at once<br />
that I take full responsibility for this-that<br />
I thought it quite useless to be coming down<br />
in favour of a resolution which, on the face<br />
of it, did some wrong things, as I understood<br />
them, or to be coming down flatfooted<br />
against the resolution, in which case<br />
a lot of people would misinterpret tfie vote<br />
and misinterpret the views. Therefore, for<br />
better or for worse, and I still think for better,<br />
I said, " This kind of resolution is not<br />
one that you can flat-footedly oppose or<br />
flat-footedly support. Why do we not have<br />
an amendment of this resolution which will<br />
bringa the whole of the United Nations back<br />
to the realities of the position?"<br />
I say this, because I understand there are<br />
some people who think that I was a sort<br />
of fall guy think that is the term.<br />
On the contrary. I have great pride in<br />
being the Prime Minister of this country<br />
and in having views of my own on behalf<br />
of my country. Therefore, I said, Well,<br />
why not ' have an amendment? Why meet<br />
this thing full face? Let us have<br />
an amendment which in positive terms<br />
will say what we believe to be the<br />
truth? We had a discussion about<br />
that. I do not want anybody to believe<br />
that they all agreed at once with what I<br />
had to say, but at least I said it.<br />
I want honorable members to understand<br />
that the United States of America was<br />
itself deeply concerned about this matter.<br />
It knew that to have a resolution passed<br />
which put the whole onus on the President<br />
of the United States was wrong. The<br />
Americans knew that this was putting the<br />
whole situation out of balance. They<br />
knew, as I believe, that this idea that the<br />
whole conflict in the world is between<br />
the United States and the Soviet Union is<br />
a false idea, a wicked idea; something that<br />
has been devised and promulgated by<br />
8764/ 60-2 people for no good purpose. Therefore,<br />
they were deeply concerned. So, Sir, after<br />
an hour and a half of discussion that morning,<br />
I said that I thought we ought to have<br />
an amendment. I did not care very much<br />
who moved it, but we ought to have an<br />
amendment. There we were-the President<br />
of the United States of America; Mr.<br />
Herter, the Secretary of State; Mr.<br />
Macmillan, the Prime Minister of the<br />
United Kingdom; Lord Home, the United<br />
Kingdom Foreign Minister; and myself.<br />
We were all discussing this matter to and<br />
fro. In the meantime, President Eisenhower<br />
had received a letter from the five powers,<br />
signed by Dr. Nkrumah of Ghana, and containing<br />
the resolution, about which I will<br />
say something later. The President himself<br />
had been, for the previous 24 hours,<br />
discussing with his advisers the problem of<br />
how this letter ought to be answered. For<br />
better or for worse, for richer or for poorer,<br />
I came in with my idea that you could not<br />
deal with a problem of this kind by saying<br />
Yes" 1 or No that you might deal with<br />
it by saying, Here is a positive proposal<br />
And the positive proposal that I had to<br />
make was that there ought to be a renewed<br />
effort to get a Summit meeting of the Four<br />
-not some theoretical meeting of the Two,<br />
but a positive Summit meeting of the Four.<br />
We debated that and they said, Well, do<br />
you have an amendment in mind? I said,<br />
Yes ". They said. " What is it?" I<br />
indicated it in a rather vague way, and said,<br />
" All right. I will go away and draft it."<br />
This is very interesting. We finished at<br />
11 o'clock on Sunday morning. I went off,<br />
, having promised to draft an amendment and<br />
to send it to the Secretary of State, Mr.<br />
Herter, at lunch-time, and to Mr. Macmillan<br />
and Lord Home. They got it by lunch-time.<br />
There it was. With some small amendment,<br />
that was the amendment that I moved in<br />
the United Nations General Assembly.<br />
They received it at lunch-time, and after<br />
lunch we met at the British Embassy-the<br />
British Prime Minister, Lord Home, Mr.<br />
Herter and I. They had the terms of this<br />
proposed amendment. By the time we had<br />
talked it out on the Sunday, I understood<br />
-1 have no reason to believe now that I<br />
. had been wrong-that they approved of it.<br />
I think it is proper, Sir, to tell this House<br />
in my own country what the proposal was. </p>
<p>In the early part of the five-power resolu-<br />
. tion there had been three paragraphs with<br />
which nobody could quarrel. My amendment<br />
was designed, not to omit the earlier<br />
paragraphs, which were quite good, but to<br />
omit the last paragraph. The amendment<br />
was in these terms-<br />
Omit the last paragraph of the draft resolution<br />
submitted by Ghana, India, Indonesia, the<br />
United Arab Republic and Yugoslavia ( A/ 4522),<br />
and substitute therefor the following:<br />
I must ask honorable members to forgive<br />
me for this strange form of words used in<br />
the United Nations-<br />
RECALLING that a Conference between the<br />
President of the United States of America, the<br />
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the<br />
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the President<br />
of the French Republic and the Prime Minister of<br />
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern<br />
Ireland was arranged to take place in Paris on<br />
17 May 1960, in order that these four leaders<br />
should examine matters of particular and major<br />
concern for their four nations,<br />
I think that is something that every honorable<br />
member would agree with: Recalling<br />
the fact that the four great leaders had met,<br />
not to discuss all the problems of the world,<br />
but to discuss matters on which they, as<br />
-the leaders of the four great atomic powers,<br />
might have something to say. The amendment<br />
continued-<br />
RECALLING FURTHER that the Conference<br />
did not actually begin its work,<br />
NOTING that the President of the United States<br />
of America, the President of the French Republic<br />
and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of<br />
Great Britain and Northern Ireland thereupon<br />
made a public statement in the terms following:<br />
I quote the words of three out of the four-<br />
They regret that these discussions, so important<br />
for world peace, could not take place. For their<br />
part, they remain unshaken in their conviction<br />
that all outstanding international questions should<br />
be settled not by the use or threat of force, but<br />
by peaceful means through negotiation. They<br />
themselves remain ready to take part in such<br />
negotiations at any suitable'time in the future."<br />
I think it is not a bad idea to recall the<br />
minds of honorable members to the fact that<br />
three out of the four leaders of the powers<br />
at Paris used those words, and meant them.<br />
I went on from that to say in my amendment-<br />
Believing that much benefit for the world could<br />
arise from a co-operative meeting of the Heads of<br />
Government of these four nations in relation to<br />
Sthose problems which particularly concern<br />
them,-Obviously, those problems were, for the<br />
atomic powers, Berlin and all those things<br />
which are flash-points of international<br />
affairs-BELIEVING FURTHER that progress towards<br />
the solution of those problems would be a material<br />
contribution to the general work for peace of the<br />
United Nations,<br />
URGES that such a meeting should be. held at<br />
the earliest practicable date.<br />
I would have expected, Sir, speaking in my<br />
own Parliament and among my own people,<br />
that nothing would be said against that<br />
view. Here it was. Here was a call to the<br />
four great powers to sit down together and<br />
try to make the world more safe for ordinary<br />
people.<br />
I put in my amendment. That was on a<br />
Monday. At that moment, it was well<br />
known that Khrushchev was not going to<br />
meet Eisenhower-unless, of course,<br />
Eisenhower went through the remarkable<br />
performance of apologizing about the U2<br />
incident and withdrawing all his claims<br />
about the RB47 dincident-and that the<br />
President himself had said that he was not<br />
going to meet Khrushchev on those terms.<br />
Therefore, the position was that the current<br />
President of the United States and the current-<br />
if that is the right word-head of the<br />
Soviet Union were not willing to meet personally<br />
without conditions which mutually<br />
were completely unacceptable. On top of<br />
all that-and let us be sensible about this<br />
matter-at the very time at which we were<br />
having this debate, a new President of the<br />
United States was about to be elected, and<br />
what he would do or say, who would know?<br />
I want to pause here, Sir, to make a few<br />
observations, because I have been told by<br />
my friends-nobody is so frank as a friend<br />
-that some complaints have been voiced in<br />
Australia. I have tried to understand them,<br />
because I am really a tolerably broadminded<br />
fellow. I understand that the first<br />
complaint is that I was being used by the<br />
United States and the United Kingdom,<br />
which happen to be the two greatest powers<br />
in the free world and our most powerful<br />
and devoted friends. I hope I have answered<br />
that complaint. For better or for worse,<br />
the proposal for an amendment was mine,<br />
not theirs. I thought, in my new-found<br />
innocence, that Australia was entitled to a<br />
mind of its own. Indeed, I have been told<br />
by some of my friends opposite in the past </p>
<p>tl, their great complaint is that we do not<br />
have a: mind of our own. As I have said,<br />
I thought we were entitled to a mind of<br />
our own. Believing that a certain course<br />
was right, I advocated it. I need not add<br />
any words to that.<br />
In the second place, I gather from the<br />
critics that, in the interests of Australia, I<br />
should have preferred pleasing the five<br />
nations which I have named by supporting<br />
something with which I strongly disagreed<br />
-and with which I utterly disagree at this<br />
moment-to acting in concert with our most<br />
powerful and most unambiguous friends.<br />
If that is the price of admiralty, then I<br />
resign from admiralty. I have learnt, perhaps,<br />
very little in my life, but I have learnt<br />
to know who are our friends.<br />
Contrary to my expectation, it was ruled<br />
that the five-power resolution and my<br />
amendment should be discussed separately<br />
from the general debate, on Wednesday<br />
morning, 5th October. My major speechwhich<br />
appears to have missed fire here, for<br />
some reason or other-had been listed for<br />
the afternoon. Therefore, unlike anybody<br />
else at the United Nations, I had to make<br />
two separate speeches instead of one. Therefore,<br />
on Wednesday morning-knowing that<br />
on Wednesday afternoon I had to make my<br />
most considerable speech--I moved my<br />
amendment. At question time this morning, when I<br />
was treated so kindly, my distinguished<br />
friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Mr. Whitlam) said to me, " I would like<br />
to know what you said on your amendment<br />
I want to say at once that I have<br />
arranged that the full text of what I said<br />
will be made available to members, because,<br />
unhappily, it does not appear to have been<br />
rather widely reported. I will permit myself<br />
the luxury of quoting a few of the things<br />
that I said that morning to the cold and<br />
unresponsive audience of the United<br />
Nations General Assembly. I think I should<br />
do so. A motion had been put down in the<br />
name of five powers, and I was moving an<br />
amendment. Among other things, I said-<br />
Let me say at once, that nobody can more<br />
warmly appreciate the high motives of the sponsors<br />
of the resolution than I do. They feel, no doubt,<br />
that it would be a bad thing if all the Heads of<br />
State and Heads of Government departed from<br />
this Assembly without leaving behind some visible<br />
evidence in the shape of a decision. They believed, no doubt, that the people of the world would be<br />
disappointed and perhaps disillusioned if we all<br />
departed and nothifig at all emerged. They therefore<br />
introduced this resolution and part of its<br />
purpose, as it has. been explained to me, was to<br />
try to take advantage of the presence in North<br />
America at the same time of President Eisenhower<br />
and Mr. Khrushchev. But if I believe, as I do,<br />
that the effect 6f the resolution, if carried, would<br />
be undesirable, then I am bound to say so.<br />
I hope that honorable members will realize<br />
that that was an authentic Australian voice<br />
upon thi matter. I went on to talk about<br />
the conference in Paris-the conference<br />
which did not occur, the conference which<br />
broke down because of Khrushchev's<br />
attitude. I said-<br />
Many of us had thought that the discussions<br />
about nuclear tests could have been brought<br />
within reach of finality.<br />
I still believe that. I continued-<br />
After all, the great nuclear powers were not so<br />
widely separated on this issue that some effective<br />
lead could not have been given. But the Paris<br />
conference failed even to begin, because the leader<br />
of the Soviet Union would not participate. I have<br />
my own view about his stated reasons, but at<br />
this moment I would not desire to debate them.<br />
This was said in the morning.<br />
The material and relevant fact was that the<br />
leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom<br />
and France, promptly made a statement in which<br />
they said:-<br />
I trust that this will be remembered for<br />
years, but not, I hope, with tears.--<br />
" They regret that these discussion, so important<br />
for world peace, could not takeplace. For their<br />
part, they remain unshaken in their conviction<br />
that all outstanding international questions should<br />
be settled not by the use or threat of force, but<br />
by peaceful means through negotiation. They<br />
themselves remain ready to take part in such<br />
negotiations at any suitable time in the future."<br />
My speech continued-<br />
This, it will be agreed, was a fair enough<br />
proposition, good-tempered and. tenacious in the<br />
cause of peace. Should it be rejected now? If<br />
we have now reached a point in our discussions<br />
when we feel that talks of this kind should<br />
proceed, why should we not say so? Why should<br />
we, by carrying the five-nation resolution, dismiss<br />
the United Kingdom and France from the first<br />
act? Then I went on to say this, and it is worth<br />
remembering-Mr. Nehru himself has frankly stated that there<br />
are serious limits to the usefulness of bilateral<br />
talks; but what I would wish to know is whether<br />
any valid reason can be advanced for supposing<br />
that in some way the President of the United<br />
States was the stumbling block, and that therefore </p>
<p>in any renewed discussions he should be the one<br />
leader of what we call the Wes: ern World to be<br />
brought under persuasion or pressure.<br />
My own view is that we should encourage the<br />
resumption of these summit talks. No doubt, a<br />
meeting at the Summit cannot be arranged quickly<br />
or without preparation. We shall have to feel<br />
our way forward, and a way may be found.<br />
But it will not be found in the next few days,<br />
and I doubt whether it can be found by trying<br />
to rush at it. The Australian amendment reflects<br />
what I believe is the view of the majority here,<br />
that we should try to recapture the hope that was<br />
offered to us in the early part of this year when<br />
we were moving towards a Summit meeting.<br />
I concluded this excerpt by saying-<br />
There may indeed be other amendments. I<br />
should like to say for myself that I am much less<br />
concerned about the details of draftsmanship than<br />
I am to avoid the perpetuation of the notion<br />
that the world confict is between the United<br />
States and the Soviet Union.<br />
Well, Sir, before the morning session<br />
ended, in the course of which I regret to<br />
say that my distinguished friend, Mr.<br />
Nehru, made a somewhat remarkable commentary<br />
upon my amendment and my<br />
speech, the President indicated that two<br />
further amendments were being circulated<br />
and that the matter would be concluded<br />
at the night session. This was on the Wednesday.<br />
I will by-pass, for the moment,<br />
the afternoon session. At the night session<br />
Cambodia, which after all is an Asian<br />
country, indicated that it would have supported<br />
my amendment as a separate resolution.<br />
This was a merely technical objection<br />
to its form. For some reason or other,<br />
and I still do not understand it, because. in<br />
these United Nations affairs I am a new<br />
boy, the foreshadowed further amendments<br />
that had been referred to by the President<br />
in the morning were not submitted.<br />
So, the first thing which happened after<br />
Cambodia had said this was that we voted<br />
on the Australian amendment. Of course,<br />
the result has given immense pleasure to a<br />
few people. I do not know why they should<br />
be so pleased that an Australian amendment<br />
should be defeated. Still, one lives<br />
and learns. So the Assembly voted on my<br />
amendment. It was supported, on the vote,<br />
by France, by the United Kingdom, by the<br />
United States of America, by Canada and<br />
by ourselves-not a bad voting group, I<br />
think. There were 45 people who voted<br />
" No" and 43 who abstained. Very interestingly,<br />
among the people who abstained<br />
and so said neither " Yes" nor " No" were the Soviet Union, the entire Sc. t<br />
bloc, Japan, Laos, the Philippines, Thailand,<br />
and Cambodia-for the reason I have referred<br />
to. It was then proposed that<br />
separate votes should be taken-this is a<br />
highly technical but fascinating problem for<br />
us who are parliamentarians--on the inclusion<br />
in the five-power resolution of the<br />
words " the President of". See what I<br />
mean? The President of the United States<br />
of America-and then " the Chairman of<br />
the Council of Ministers of This, of<br />
ccurse, is something which we min our<br />
innocence in this Parliament know nothing<br />
about. Anyhow, it was proposed that<br />
' separate votes should be taken, and my<br />
distinguished friend, the Prime Minister of<br />
India, Mr. Nehru, objected, I thought, with<br />
great force, that if these words were omitted<br />
the five-power resolution would be meaningless<br />
because, of course, diplomatic relaticns<br />
had not been cut off between the<br />
United States of America and the Soviet<br />
Union. They had never been interrupted.<br />
I might say I thought he had a great<br />
deal of force in that but, as I did not like<br />
the five-power resolution, I remained relatively<br />
unmoved, except intellectually, by<br />
this argument. Sir, what happened?<br />
Separate votes were put to the vote of the<br />
Assembly. I want to mention this to<br />
honorable members because some people<br />
rather foolishly have tried to make it appear<br />
that I, representing you in this Parliament,<br />
had done something foolish and had been<br />
left out on a limb. But when the separate<br />
votes were put to the vote those in favour<br />
of separate vo: es-in other words those<br />
who must be regarded as being not in<br />
favour of the five-power resolution as a<br />
whole-were 37, and against them were<br />
36, with 22 abstentions. It is lovely, you<br />
know. Some of you have been there, but<br />
I had not been there before. Somebody<br />
says " abstention" in English and somebody,<br />
being brought up in the French language,<br />
says " abstention" in French, but<br />
it amounts to the same thing. There we<br />
were, 37 in favour of separate votes, 36<br />
against and 22 abstentions. Those in favour<br />
of separate votes,-and I mention this because<br />
some silly fellow who tried to pretend<br />
that I am becoming bad friends with<br />
the Asian countries suggested the contrary<br />
-included Pakistan, China, Japan, the<br />
Philippines and Thailand. </p>
<p>if I may permit myself to say so,<br />
1 do not mind finding myself standing, as<br />
to three of these countries, alongside our<br />
colleagues in the South-East Asian Treaty.<br />
When the separate votes were taken,<br />
because it had been decided there ought to<br />
be separate votes, those in favour of retaining<br />
what I will call the separate phrases"<br />
the President of the United States of<br />
America, the Chairman o the Council of<br />
Ministers of the Soviet Union-numbered<br />
41 with 37 against and 17 abstentions.<br />
The President ruled that there should be<br />
a two-thirds majority. There was not a<br />
two-thirds majority, and the President's<br />
ruling was upheld. All this was going on in<br />
the one day when oddities of all kinds-<br />
Heaven help me!-were being published in<br />
my own country. Those who voted against<br />
the retention of these personal phrases, in<br />
other words those who voted against the<br />
idea that we should be telling President<br />
Eisenhower and Chairman Khrushchev to<br />
get together, included all of the South-East<br />
Asian countries. That, I think, is something<br />
worth noting.<br />
After all this argy-bargy-I think that is<br />
the expression-Mr. Nehru, the very distinguished<br />
leader of India, stood up and<br />
said that, having regard to the voting, the<br />
Sfive-power resolution would be withdrawn.<br />
So at one o'clock in the morning of the<br />
same sitting day the five-power resolution<br />
had gone. You may ask what had happened<br />
to my amendment submitted on behalf of<br />
Australia. Many people have been eager<br />
beavers to say that my amendment was just<br />
ridiculous and that I had made a fool of<br />
C my country. When I make a fool of this<br />
Scountry I hope that you will expel me.<br />
The fact was that by one o'clock in the<br />
morning the resolution to which my amendment<br />
had been an unsuccessful alternative<br />
had been withdrawn-withdrawn because<br />
. other amendments had been moved or other<br />
procedures had been adopted which persuaded<br />
its sponsors to withdraw it.<br />
I want to stress to honorable members<br />
that this is not a party political matter.<br />
All of us are Australians and we want to<br />
feel that our country counts. The fact is<br />
that by the end of that day two remarkable<br />
things had occurred. First, the proposal<br />
sponsored primarily by Yugoslavia, the<br />
United Arab Republic, Indonesia and others had gone. It had been withdrawn. In the<br />
meantime, in the course of the voting, four<br />
atomic powers-the only four atomic<br />
powers-had been called to the ballot. You<br />
may think that I am rather foolish, but at<br />
any rate I called them to the ballot. Four<br />
6f them, Great Britain, France and the<br />
United States, had voted unhesitatingly for<br />
a convening of the Summit conference as<br />
contained in my amendment, and the Soviet<br />
Union had not voted but had<br />
abstained from voting.<br />
Four days later, under circumstances<br />
which vex the honorable member for East<br />
Sydney ( Mr. Ward), I had a talk with the<br />
head of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev,<br />
in which he made it abundantly clear that<br />
he wanted a Summit conference. That was<br />
why he had not voted against my amendment.<br />
He wanted a Summit conference<br />
and by one o'clock-after midnight that<br />
day-I went back feeling in my simple<br />
vanity that at any rate we had now got to<br />
a state of affairs in which there would be,<br />
after the American presidential election, a<br />
Summit conference. It is very difficult, even<br />
for such an old hand as myself, to understand<br />
why this achievement-because it was<br />
something of an achievement-should be<br />
regarded as in some way discreditable to<br />
our country, to which most of us were born.<br />
To sum up, Sir, my amendment was lost,<br />
but the resolution was withdrawn. Three<br />
atomic powers had voted for a Summit<br />
meeting and the Soviet Union had abstained.<br />
Not one of the four atomic powers was<br />
opposed to a Summit meeting.<br />
I pass on from that. I made a speech<br />
that afternoon. In my simplicity I thought<br />
that that was the major speech, and my<br />
distinguished colleague, the Treasurer, who<br />
was present probably-God bless himthought<br />
likewise, because the speech in the<br />
morning was on this technical problem. As<br />
I have said, I made a speech in the afternoon.<br />
It lasted for about 40 minutes. It is<br />
very interesting for an Australian to go<br />
abroad and make a speech on the great<br />
United Nations platform. This was the<br />
only occasion in my life when the American<br />
press swept a speech of mine into its<br />
columns. But that did not happen here in<br />
Australia. A pity! It is a pity that we<br />
should have this inferiority complex because<br />
after all, Mr. Speaker, in my speech in the </p>
<p>afternoon I had made up my mind that if<br />
Mr., Khrushchev were to come and bully<br />
people-taunt people, and beat things on. the<br />
table, including his shoes-it was really high<br />
time that somebody speaking for 10,000,000<br />
people-that is all-should make it quite<br />
clear to him that we are not frightened'.<br />
Therefore I let myself go, as you might say.<br />
But of course, what happened in the United<br />
Nations Assembly, apart from all the beating<br />
on the table and the wearinge out of boot<br />
leather which was all very funny from our<br />
point of view? I think that Mr. Khrushchev<br />
wanted to persuade or terrify new nations<br />
into coming into his camp. We know<br />
n6thing about that. We are not easily<br />
per suaded, and we certainly are not easily<br />
terrified into somebody else's camp. But<br />
that seemned to be his idea. He had his<br />
heelers with him. There were with him<br />
about half a dozen representatives from his<br />
satellite nations who would not dare to<br />
applaud without first looking round to see<br />
whether he gave the high sign. Wonderful!<br />
I wish. that I could organize that sort of<br />
thing some day! Mr. Khrushchev talked<br />
about co lonial ism. He tried to read into the<br />
minds of some of the delegates a bitterness<br />
about their old status. He was talking for<br />
the most part to people who represented<br />
countries in Africa which, by wise providence<br />
on the part of the United Kingdom,<br />
had ceased to be colonies and had become<br />
independent nations. I thought that was a<br />
monstrosity. Anyhow he did it. Therefore,<br />
I thought on your behalf-if you do not<br />
agree with what I did you will say so--that<br />
I ought to use a few words mildly about this<br />
situation. Let me quote one or two, of the<br />
words that I used, because apparently there<br />
has been some difficulty in reporting them in<br />
Australia. I said-<br />
I beg of all these distinguished representatives-<br />
I was referring to the representatives of<br />
the new countries, primarily -in Africato<br />
put bitterness out of their minds. So far as<br />
they are concerned, the past has gone. The dead<br />
past should bury its dead. It is the present and<br />
future that matter. Most of them know that political<br />
independence can be won more swiftly than<br />
economic independence.<br />
I pause here to repeat the last sentence<br />
because some rather silly fellow has said<br />
that I was not on the same wave-length as the new countries. I leave it to the 1. A~ e<br />
to decide. I said-<br />
Most of them know that political independence<br />
can be won more swiftly than economic independence.<br />
And yet both are essential to true<br />
nationhood. Under these circumstances, nations<br />
which are older in self-government should not be<br />
looking at new nations as people whose support<br />
should be canvassed, but as people who need<br />
objective assistance with no strings if the material<br />
prosperity of their people is to be improved.<br />
It is one of the significant things in contemporary<br />
history that the advanced industrial nations<br />
are, because of their scientific and technological<br />
adv antages, improving their standards at a<br />
phenomenal rate; while less advanced countries,<br />
lacking the same techniques on the same scale,<br />
are advancing at a slower rate.<br />
This is not one of the facts of life which one<br />
may observe and, having observed, forget. Itsignificance<br />
is that the gap between the advanced<br />
and the relatively unadvanced tends, unless we do<br />
something about it, to grow wider every year.<br />
It is not a state of affairs which civilized and<br />
humane thinking can indefinitely tolerate.<br />
I said this on Australia's behalf, and I am<br />
sure that no honorable member will disagree<br />
with it.<br />
if in this Assembly and in the nations here<br />
represented we will constantly remember that our<br />
trust is for humanity and that, indeed, the United<br />
Nations itself has no other reason for existence,<br />
we will more and more concentrate our efforts<br />
on providing economic and techn-ical help for<br />
new nations to tho very limit of our capacity; not<br />
because we want, to put it crudely, to buy them<br />
into our own ideas of things, not only because<br />
we really and passionately believe in independence<br />
and freedom, but also because we believe that<br />
our fellow human beings everywhere are entitled<br />
to decent conditions of life, and have enough<br />
sense to know that independence and freedom are<br />
mcre words unless the ordinary people of free<br />
countries have a chance of a better life to-morrow.<br />
This point of view seemed to me to underlie<br />
the temperate and persuasive speech of Mr.<br />
Macmillan and other speeches made by democratic<br />
leaders.<br />
But there are others who have so far misunderstood<br />
the spirit of the United Nations as to<br />
resort to open or veiled threats, blatant and in<br />
some instances lying propaganda, a clearly expressed<br />
desire to divide and conquer. They<br />
should [ earn that threatened men live long<br />
and that free nations, however small, are not<br />
susceptible to bullying.<br />
I am still quoting myself, which is an ill<br />
business. I continued-<br />
I will permit myself the luxury of developing<br />
this theme, though quite briefly, in the particular<br />
and in the general.<br />
I hope honorable members will not think<br />
me boring but this was a phase of my </p>
<p>speech which, I believe, had an immense<br />
impact on the Assembly. I said-<br />
In his opening speech, Mr. Khrushchev made<br />
his usual great play about " colonialism As Mr.<br />
Macmillan reminded us, the answer to much of<br />
his story is to be found in the presence in this<br />
Assembly of many new nations, once colonies and<br />
now independent.<br />
Mr. Khrushchev said among other things;<br />
" Nations who oppress other nations cannot<br />
themselves be free. Every free nation should help<br />
the peoples still oppressed to win freedom and<br />
independence." This was, in one sense, a most<br />
encouraging observation. It made me wonder<br />
whether we were perhaps about to see a beginning<br />
of an era in which the nations of Europe,<br />
which were once independent and are now under<br />
Soviet Communist control, are going to receive<br />
the blessings of freedom and independence. What<br />
a glorious vista of freedom would be opened up<br />
by such a policy! How much it would do to<br />
relieve the causes of tension, and promote<br />
peacel I venture to say that it is an act of complete<br />
hypocrisy for a Communist leader to denounce<br />
colonialism as if it were an evil characteristic of<br />
the Western Powers, when the facts are that the<br />
greatest colonial power now existing is the Soviet<br />
Union itself.<br />
This brings me now to the point. I said-<br />
Further, in the course of this Assembly, Mr.<br />
Khrushchev was good enough to make some<br />
references to my own country and its position in<br />
relation to the territories of Papua and New<br />
Guinea. He calls upon Australia to give imme.<br />
diate full independence and self-government to<br />
New Guinea and Papua. As a piece of rhetoric<br />
this no doubt has its points. But it exhibits a<br />
disturbing want of knowledge of these territories<br />
and of the present stage of their development.<br />
Nobody who knows anything about these territories<br />
and their indigenous people could doubt<br />
for a moment that for us in Australia to abandon<br />
our responsibilities would be an almost criminal<br />
act. I am quoting this part of my speech<br />
because, subject to correction, I feel that<br />
these words impressed themselves upon our<br />
friend. I said-<br />
Here is a country which not so long ago was<br />
to a real extent in a state of savagery. It passed<br />
through the most gruesome experiences during the<br />
last war. It came out of it without organized<br />
administration and, in a sense, without hope.<br />
It is not a nation in the accepted term. Its<br />
people have no real structure of association except<br />
through our administration.. Its groups are<br />
isolated among mountains, forests, rivers and<br />
swamps. It is estimated that there are more than<br />
200 different languages.<br />
Probably my distinguished colleague, the<br />
Minister for Territories CMr. Hasluck)<br />
would tell me that I underestimated the<br />
number. I continued-<br />
The work to be done to create and foster a<br />
sense and organism of community is therefore<br />
enormous. But, with a high sense of responsibility, Australia<br />
has attacked its human task in this almost<br />
unique area.<br />
Since the war some form of civilized order has<br />
been established over many thousands of ' square<br />
miles which were previously unexplored.<br />
We have built up an extensive administration<br />
service Really, I do not need to trouble<br />
honorable members about this. I told<br />
them the simple, dramatic and moving<br />
story of what has been done in Papua and<br />
New Guinea, and I ended by saying-<br />
I could go on like this almost indefinitely.<br />
The achievement has not been without cost.<br />
We have put many more millions into Papua and<br />
New Guinea than have ever come out.<br />
We have established many local government<br />
councils, democratically elected on an" adult<br />
franchise, and we have set up a Legislative<br />
Council on which there is a growing number of<br />
indigenous members.<br />
Mr. Khrushchev includes us in his diatribe<br />
against " foreign administrators who despise and<br />
loot the local population". I have shown how<br />
exactly opposite to the truth this is in our case.<br />
His further extravaganza about " the overseer's<br />
lash and the executioner's axe must relate to<br />
areas with which he is more familiar than he is<br />
with New Guinea and Papua.<br />
We do not need to be lectured on such matters<br />
by a man who has no record whatever of having<br />
brought colonial people into freedom and selfgovernment.<br />
We indeed are proud to be in. the<br />
British tradition of the 20th century-a tradition<br />
which has by sensible degrees and enlightened<br />
administration brought the blessings of self government<br />
and a seat in the councils of the world to<br />
many former colonies.<br />
I also spoke about neutralism, and I . inflict<br />
this on honorable members-<br />
Neutralism is, of course, one of those rather<br />
rotund words which does not readily, admit of<br />
definition. If, when we say that a nation is neutral,<br />
we mean that it will not under any circumstances<br />
take arms in any conflizt which does not concern<br />
the protection of its own immediate boundaries,<br />
it seems to be a notion hard to reconcile with the<br />
Charter of the United Nations which contemplates<br />
under certain circumstances the use of combined<br />
force in terms of the Charter itself.<br />
Mr. Nehru, the distinguished leader of India,<br />
has not, I think, used the word ". neutral" in this<br />
sense. He and his government maintain large<br />
defences in their own country, and are active supporters<br />
of the Charter. What he has consistently<br />
made clear is that he stands for non-alignment, in<br />
the sense that he will not engage in. any special<br />
military or quasi-military alliance.<br />
My own country does not subscribe to this view,<br />
since we are party, for example, to the South-East<br />
Asian Treaty with the military associations which<br />
are either expressed or implied in it. But we do<br />
not quarrel with each other about these matters. I<br />
would think it impossible to believe that some of </p>
<p>the greatest leaders of so-called " neutral" countries<br />
would regard themselves as being neutral in the<br />
great conflict of ideas.<br />
Sir, having said all that at, I am afraid, too<br />
great length, I now. turn, quite briefly I hope,<br />
to some general observations about this<br />
rather historic General Assembly meeting.<br />
First of all, a determined attack was made<br />
by the Communist powers upon new nations<br />
to. encourage what I have already described<br />
as retrospective bitterness I do not<br />
think that on this matter the table-thumping<br />
succeeded. In the second place, attempts were made<br />
to defeat or to undermine the Secretary-<br />
General. In particular, a very remarkable<br />
proposal was put forward that there should<br />
be three secretaries-general instead of one;<br />
and for some very odd reason, one ought to<br />
be from what we would call the Communist<br />
group but what Mr. Khrushchev-I<br />
apologize to my friends opposite-calls the<br />
socialist group, a second from the neutralist<br />
group and a third from the capitalist group<br />
of which, no doubt, I was one of the representatives.<br />
There ought to be three<br />
secretaries-general, and everybody would<br />
have a veto on everybody else, and therefore,<br />
of course, nothing would happen, and therefore<br />
the United Nations would come to an<br />
end. He did not get very much success<br />
with that remarkable proposal.<br />
But there are some aspects of his general<br />
campaign about which I think I should<br />
report to this Parliament. First of all, I<br />
believe that what he has been saying and<br />
what he has been doing are designed to<br />
divide the United Nations into the disunited<br />
nations. After all. if there is one thing<br />
about the United Nations that matters, it is<br />
that it possesses a sort of universality. As<br />
I said in my own speech, he wants to produce<br />
a result like ancient Gaul-according<br />
to our late respected friend, Julius Caesar,<br />
all Gaul was divided into three parts. This<br />
man wants to divide the United Nations<br />
into three parts and therefore into the disunited<br />
nations.<br />
One of the groups that he wants to produce<br />
in this disunited body is what he keeps<br />
on describing as the neutralist group. What<br />
is a neutralist group? Sir, one of the things<br />
that I beg all honorable members on both<br />
sides of the House to avoid is this fallacy of<br />
easy classification. So-and-so is an African,<br />
therefore he must think like all other<br />
Africans! If one African is neutralist, therefore he must be neutralist! This is an iuult<br />
to people. Does anybody suppose that<br />
because people were born west of the Soviet<br />
boundary in Europe, whether they are<br />
Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen or<br />
Italians, they are the same kind of men with<br />
the same kind of ideas? This, of course, is<br />
utter nonsense. You may go over the whole<br />
zone of Africa and tell me that so-and-so,<br />
so-and-so, and so-and-so must think the<br />
same way because they are all Africans and<br />
they are all African leaders. Sir, I tell you<br />
that the greatest speech made at this General J<br />
Assembly was made by the Prime Minister<br />
of Nigeria. He is a most remarkable man,<br />
and his speech made an unforgettable impact<br />
on the minds of all of us. It would insul'<br />
this great man-the head of the Government<br />
of the greatest single nation in the<br />
whole African continent, a nation of<br />
40,000,000 people-to be told that his<br />
country must be classified, along with other<br />
countries, in a group or a bloc. No one<br />
could have been more explicit than he was<br />
about the need for every nation to live its<br />
own life, to face its own future, to accept<br />
its own responsibilities. The people who<br />
want to denigrate the whole of modern independence,<br />
and to treat new nations as if<br />
they were merely groups to be bought like<br />
bunches of bananas, make a very great<br />
blunder. That was perhaps the greatest<br />
blunder that Khrushchev made.<br />
Let us consider the ways in which Mr.<br />
Khrushchev failed. He failed to undermine<br />
the Secretary-General. He failed to destroy<br />
the work that has been done with regard to<br />
the Congo. He failed on occasion after<br />
occasion, and I will not take up the time of<br />
the House in recounting them all, because<br />
I have already taken up too much of its<br />
time. He had some success, no doubt. He<br />
may have frightened somebody and he may<br />
have weakened a little the position of the<br />
Secretary-General; I do not know. You and<br />
I in this House are fortunate to have grown<br />
up in such an atmosphere that we can laugh<br />
at nonsense and not be frightened by it, so<br />
how am I to know to what extent Mr.<br />
Khrushchev succeeded in frightening<br />
people? He tried to disunite the United<br />
Nations. He tried to introduce some strange<br />
dogma about neutralist groups.<br />
He had some point, I suppose. He said<br />
that when the United Nations was established<br />
it had 50 member nations, that now it </p>
<p>haL nearly 100, and that therefore there<br />
ought to be some reconstruction of the<br />
structure of the organization. I do not<br />
object to that suggestion, so long as it is<br />
understood that one of the dangers that'<br />
have grown up in the modern world is that<br />
the General Assembly, which has relatively<br />
little power, has become tremendously important<br />
because the heads of governments<br />
attend it, wvhereas the chief executive body<br />
-1 am not using the word executive " in<br />
( a technical sense-the Security Council, has<br />
been put rather on one side. The Security<br />
Council, Sir, must continue to include in its<br />
membership people who represent the great<br />
powers, which themselves are the backbone<br />
6of the United Nations and which themselves<br />
{ carry the major responsibility for peace.<br />
KBut, subject to that proviso, I do not object<br />
to the suggestion that a reconstructign of<br />
the United Nations should be considered.<br />
I want to say only one or two things<br />
more. I had the very valuable opportunity<br />
of seeing, on your behalf, a number of<br />
world leaders. I would not wish any member<br />
of this Parliament, on either side, to<br />
believe that I was being exclusive,' talking<br />
to this side and not to that side. In the<br />
course of rather less than three weeks I<br />
had the closest discussions with President<br />
Eisenhower, with the American Secretary<br />
of State, Mr. Herter, with Mr. Macmillan<br />
and Lord Home and with Mr. Nehru. I<br />
had a long interview with Mr. Khrushchev.<br />
I sought the interview, and I tell you quite<br />
frankly that the main reason why I sought<br />
it was that I thought that if I came back<br />
Shere and my friends, or friendly opponents<br />
who sit opposite, asked me whether I saw<br />
k~ Khrushchev and I replied that I had not,<br />
they might think it rather odd. So I sought<br />
an interview with Mr. Khrushchev.<br />
I had already expressed myself, as honorable<br />
members will have gathered from what I have already said, with a certain degree<br />
of clarity. Nevertheless, I had 70 minutes<br />
with Mr. Khrushchev. I want to say to the<br />
House that I came away from the interview<br />
quite satisfied that he would like a Summit<br />
conference. Being more interested, as I am,<br />
in substance than in form, and as what I<br />
was trying for from the day I arrived at<br />
the United Nations was the substance of<br />
a Summit conference, I am very pleased to<br />
say that three of the atomic powers voted<br />
for a Summit conference on my amendment,<br />
and that the fourth, through Mr.<br />
Khruschev, has indicated to -me in the<br />
clearest possible terms that a Summit conference<br />
is considered a good idea.<br />
I saw, of course, the Prime Minister of<br />
Ethiopia, who is an old friend of mine. I<br />
had a talk with President Tito. I spoke to<br />
Mr. Luns, the Foreign Minister of the<br />
Netherlands. Dr. Subandrio, of Indonesia,<br />
was a guest of mine, and I had a long talk<br />
with him. Indeed, one would be surprised<br />
at the number of people who concern us in<br />
this world with whom, in the course of<br />
a fortnight or three weeks, one can have<br />
useful talks.<br />
I ' have occupied the time of the House<br />
long enough. Having said that I believe that<br />
Mr. Khrushchev wants Summit talks, and<br />
that I think something might come of them,<br />
I would like to conclude by saying that 1<br />
have by no means been disposed to defend<br />
myself on the matters about which I have<br />
spoken. I believe in my heart and my<br />
mind that I pursued the right course at New<br />
York, and that I spoke and acted in the<br />
best interests of my country.<br />
I lay on the table the following paper:-<br />
United Nations-General Assembly-Ministerial<br />
Statement.<br />
and move-<br />
That the paper be printed:<br />
