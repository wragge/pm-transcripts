PRIME MINISTER ~ 9<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MVP<br />
THE DOWNER SHADOW MINISTRY<br />
The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, has failed his first test in the job by<br />
announcing a frontbench larger than the Government's.<br />
All his talk about having a commitment to smaller government is exposed as<br />
humbug. The best he could do was to trim Dr Hewson's Gargantuan shadow<br />
ministry down to 32 members still two more than the Government.<br />
And so much for a " fresh start." His " new look" shadow ministry now includes<br />
no fewer than three failed Leaders of the Opposition, and presumably the<br />
tonew blood" is typified by the return to the frontbench of the former Fraser<br />
Government minister John Moore.<br />
The list of Shadow Ministers and Shadow Parliamentary Secretaries issued<br />
by Mr Downer today includes a grand total of 45 people. That is, virtually<br />
everyone who voted for Mr Downer last Monday, plus two presumably Dr<br />
Hewson and Dr Wooldridge.<br />
The ethnic community will also note with concern that Mr Downer has not<br />
included Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in his Shadow Cabinet, relegating it<br />
to the outer shadow ministry.<br />
The appointment of Dr Hewson to the Industry portfolio will underwhelm many<br />
in the business community, who withdrew their support for Dr Hewson so<br />
pointedly last week. The car industry, for one, will not relish dealing with the<br />
man who wanted to impose Fightback's zero tariff policy, thereby rendering<br />
our motor vehicle Industry uneconomic and driving it offshore.<br />
Mr Downer needs to try harder.<br />
