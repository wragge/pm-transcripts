    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will Native Title be the main focus of your message to voters in</p>
<p>   Northern Queensland?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will be a whole range of things particularly the attempts</p>
<p>   of the Government to reform the Australian waterfront. What is at</p>
<p>   stake here is the need after 70 years of inefficiency and rorts</p>
<p>   to reform the Australian waterfront. We want a more efficient waterfront</p>
<p>   because that will generate more jobs, generate more exports and</p>
<p>   attract more business investment. That is what is at stake, the</p>
<p>   outcome of a more efficient waterfront. We've had 70 years</p>
<p>   of trying to do it with the inefficiency and I think the public</p>
<p>   is fed up with that and they want a new reformed deal on the Australian</p>
<p>   waterfront that will generate jobs, generate investment and generate</p>
<p>   exports, and that's the message I'll be taking, not only</p>
<p>   to the people of North Queensland, but to people all over Australia</p>
<p>   because what is at stake is Australia's export and jobs future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you disturbed by those images of women and children on the</p>
<p>   front line of the picket in Sydney on the docks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I was. A picket line is no place for children and I think</p>
<p>   the people responsible for the use of those children will be condemned</p>
<p>   by Australians all over the country irrespective of their views</p>
<p>   on this dispute.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Would it be justified for the New South Wales Government to wind</p>
<p>   back police presence on the docks because it's opposed to what</p>
<p>   you are trying to do there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it wouldn't. But police in any part of lawful</p>
<p>No it wouldn't. But police in any part of lawful society are</p>
<p>   there to protect lawful activity. And it is the role of the police,</p>
<p>   irrespective of the political views of the Government in power,</p>
<p>   be it at a Federal or State level, to uphold the law. They are the</p>
<p>   civilian authority that upholds the law and any attempt by any State</p>
<p>   Government to interfere with that very solemn responsibility of</p>
<p>   the police will be condemned by Australians. Thank you.</p>
