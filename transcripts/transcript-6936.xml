CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTRE<br />
FRIDAY 30 MAY 1986<br />
MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES, EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
THIS CEREMONY TODAY MARKS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S PREPARATIONS FOR THE BICENTENARY AND REAFFIRMS<br />
THE STRENGTH AND CLOSENESS OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENARY IN 1988 WILL MARK THE 200TH<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT IN AUSTRALIA. . IN<br />
CONSIDERING WAYS TO COM'MEMORATE THIS EVENT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
BICENTENNIAL AUTHORITY HAS SOUGHT PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS THAT<br />
WOULD CONSTITUTE A LEGACY OF LASTING VALUE.<br />
WITH TKAT IN MIND THE AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED A TASK FORCE TO<br />
INVESTI~ GATE A PROPOSAL THAT A NATIONAL SCIENCE CENTRE BE<br />
ESTABLISH-ED TO ENCOURAGE, THROUGH PARTICIPATION, LEARNING<br />
ABOUT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.<br />
SUBSEQUENTLY, TO GIVE EFFECT TO THIS PROPOSAL THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
BICENTENNIAL AUTHORITY HAS DECIDED TO CONTRIBUTE $ 5.14M FOR<br />
THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL SCIENCE AND<br />
TECHNOLOGY CENTRE.<br />
THIS CENTRE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT AND LASTING REMINDER OF<br />
THE BICENTENARY.<br />
THE LOCATION OF THE CENTRE ON THIS PRESTIGIOUS SITE IN THE<br />
PARLIAMENTARY TRIANGLE BETWEEN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY AND THE<br />
HIGH COURT AND CLOSE BY THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
SYMBOLISES THE GOVERNMENT'S WISH THAT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY<br />
LIKE THE ARTS, LETTERS AND THE LAW BE RECOGNISED AS<br />
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ENRICHMENT OF OUR CULTURE, AND,<br />
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANTLY, TO OUR NATION'S DEVELOPMENT.<br />
THIS PROJECT'S RELEVANCE IS NOT HOWEVER, CONFINED TO ONE<br />
SITE IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL. THE CENTRE WILL HAVE A MOBILE<br />
COMPONENT THAT WILL TRAVEL ALL OVER AUSTRALIA. PLANNING IS<br />
WELL ADVANCED AND, DURING THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, AN<br />
EXPERIMENTAL VERSION HAS VISITED SEVERAL CENTRES IN THE<br />
EASTERN STATES. PUBLIC REACTION DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY THE<br />
BENEFITS OF SUCH AN APPROACH. </p>
<p>THE SCIENCE CENTRE PROPOSAL WAS PROMPTED BY EXPERIENCE<br />
GAINED FROM THE SUCCESSFUL " HANDS-ONN SCIENCE CENTRES IN<br />
NORTH AMERICA AND CLOSER TO HOME AT THE QUESTACON SCIENCE<br />
CENTRE, ESTABLISHED BY THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY<br />
HERE IN CANBERRA UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR MICHAEL GORE.<br />
THE QUESTACON SPECIALIZES IN INTERACTIVE " HANDS-ON" EXHIBITS<br />
DESIGNED TO BE USED BY ITS VISITORS. THROUGH THE QUESTACON<br />
STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO<br />
ENHANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE<br />
MORE COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN PRESENT DAY<br />
TECHNOLOGY. THE QUESTACON AND ITS TRAVELLING COMPONENT HAVE BEEN<br />
ASSISTED BY MAJOR COMPANIES, LIKE SHELL AUSTRALIA,<br />
COMMONWEALTH INDUSTRIAL GASES, KODAK, ESSO AND FORD. SOME<br />
GAVE FINANCIAL HELP WHILE OTHERS DONATED HANDS-ON EXHIBITS.<br />
WE LOOK FORWARD NOW TO A CONTINUING ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY<br />
CENTRE. AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT DEPENDS MORE THAN EVER BEFORE ON<br />
SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS. RAPID ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY IN A WIDE RANGE OF SCIENCE-BASED FIELDS INCLUDING<br />
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, BIOTECHNOLOGY AND MEDICAL<br />
SCIENCE, AND IN TECHNIQUES FOR MINERAL AND AGRICULTURALDEVELOPMENT.<br />
IF WE ARE TO MAINTAIN OUR PLACE IN THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ENCOURAGE<br />
FURTHER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT.<br />
THE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL STIMULATE INDUSTRIAL AND<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND UNDERPIN IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS<br />
AND PRODUCTIVITY IN INDUSTRY. IT WILL ASSIST IN MAINTAINING<br />
THE LIVING STANDARDS OF ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
THERE IS NO MORE IMPORTANT A STARTING POINT FOR THIS PROCESS<br />
THAN THE STIMULATION OF CURIOSITY AND INQUIRY ON THE PART OF<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS CENTRE WILL HELP TO<br />
ENCOURAGE YOUNG AUSTRALIANS TO COME TO TERMS WITH SCIENCE<br />
AND TECHNOLOGY IN WAYS M4ATCHING THEIR INTERESTS. IT WILL<br />
INSPIRE SOME TO PURSUE CAREERS IN THESE FIELDS AND THUS<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROSPERITY AND WELL BEING OF OUR GREAT<br />
COUNTRY. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT, FOR THE YOUTH OF AUSTRALIA, THIS<br />
CENTRE WILL STAND OUT AS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF 1988.<br />
TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN I WAS IN JAPAN I WAS DELIGHTED TO LEARN<br />
THAT JAPAN WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY<br />
CENTRE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF ITS PARTICIPATION IN<br />
OUR BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATIONS. A FUND HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED<br />
TO ENABLE THE JAPANESE PRIVATE SECTOR TO CONTRIBUTE<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY TO THIS PROJECT. I </p>
<p>3.<br />
I MET MEMBERS OF THE JAPAN-AUSTRALIA BICENTENARY<br />
COMMEMORATION COUNCIL WHILE I WAS IN TOKYO AND CONVEYED TO<br />
THEM AUSTRALIA'S APPRECIATION OF THEIR EFFORTS IN DECIDING<br />
TO ESTABLISH THE FUND. IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH PRIME<br />
MINISTER NAKASONE I EXPRESSED MY APPRECIATION, AND THAT OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE, FOR JAPAN'S POSITIVE<br />
APPROACH TOWARDS OUR BICENTENARY.<br />
FOR THESE REASONS IN PARTICULAR, AMBASSADOR NAKAJIMA, WE ARE<br />
PLEASED THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BE PRESENT AT THIS CEREMONY<br />
TODAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
IT GIVES ME MUCH~ PLEASURE TO INAUGURATE THE CONSTRUCTION OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTRE. </p>
