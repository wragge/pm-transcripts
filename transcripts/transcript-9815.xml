    <content><![CDATA[<p><br />The Opposition Leader today made the dishonest claim that I had somehow destroyed bi-partisanship in the nuclear debate.</p>
<p><br />That honour rests with the Opposition and Mr Downer who yesterday launched a desperately empty, misguided and completely partisan Matter of Public Importance criticising the Government's policies to secure a nuclear<br />weapons free world.</p>
<p><br />Yesterday Mr Downer was partisan. Today Mr Howard affected a passion for bi-partisanship.</p>
<p><br />A display of humbug on the subject today cannot unwind the partisan response of yesterday which has received broad publicity.</p>
<p><br />Whatever the body-language, you either support an initiative of this kind or you don't. </p>
<p><br />Mr Howard made it clear yesterday with the Opposition's MPI that he didn't<br />support the Government's position.</p>
<p><br />In his concocted indignation today Mr Howard failed to take up any issue of<br />substance on nuclear or strategic policy.</p>
<p><br />CANBERRA<br />26 October 1995</p>
