TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH DUNCAN KERR MP,<br />
WREST POINT HOTEL, HOBART 24 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
KERR: Just three months ago the Prime minister and I sat<br />
in this very room to announce the establishment of<br />
TasPact, the joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian<br />
Government's Task Force on Tasmanian issBue.<br />
At the time the TasPact arrangements were announced, the<br />
Prime Minister indicated that it would be an actionorientated<br />
program designed to bring about substantial<br />
results in the shortest possible time.<br />
I just want to put on record some of my thanks to those<br />
who have worked on this project so strenuously over the<br />
last three months, particularly our Task Force consultant<br />
Peter Datton and the members of the taskforce who include<br />
two Federal ministers Peter Duncan, the minister for<br />
Employment, Senator Michael Tate, our Tasmanian Minister,<br />
State Ministers Pat Moore... and Kerry O'Brien from the<br />
Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council and Paul Salmon<br />
representing industry.<br />
Today's announcement will mark the fourth round of major<br />
announcements flowing from Taspact. When the Prime<br />
Minister announced the establishment there was an<br />
announcement of certain OLMA, office of Labour Market<br />
Adjustment Initiatives. Since then there have been<br />
announcements in relation to a $ 10 million package in<br />
relation to the Salamanca Accord, and arrangement to make<br />
sure that that process could proceed smoothly and a third<br />
announcement in relation to the Soviet fishing fleet and<br />
access to the port of Hobart.<br />
So today marks the fourth round of major announcements<br />
trwt have developed out of the TasPact process. I'm very<br />
proud to have been associated with it and thank you very<br />
much Mr Prime minister, Bob Hawke for being so<br />
enthusiastic. PM: Thanks very much Duncan. Before I go to some detail<br />
about this Tasmanian package let me just if you like<br />
establish my credentials as to commitment to Tasmania.<br />
Tasmania I suppose more than any other State was at the<br />
centre of the campaign in which I was elected Prime<br />
Minister of this country. Because you'll recall in that<br />
campaign I had to f ight the conservatives who wanted to </p>
<p>dam the Franklin. So the issues of Tasmania transcended<br />
the State, went into the whole of the mainland campaign.<br />
So Tasmania was central. And it was a bit of a paradox<br />
because I think the strength of the stand that I took<br />
with my colleagues on saving the Franklin won me votes in<br />
mainland Australia, probably cost me votes and seats in<br />
Tasmania. You'll recall that the night I was elected Prime Minister<br />
I said we'd be a government for all Australians and I<br />
particularly went out of my way to say to Tasmania,<br />
alright you've cast your vote against me, but I assure<br />
you that this will be a government which will take<br />
particular concern for Tasmania.<br />
Because as President of the ACTLJ I had got to know<br />
Tasmania's particular problems and concerns, been here<br />
frequently, and I made a commitment then on the night of<br />
the 5th of March ' 83, which I think every observer and<br />
commentator has acknowledged that I had more than kept my<br />
promise that in respect of the loss of the dam that we<br />
would, through negotiations, enter into an agreement<br />
which would ensure that Tasmania in employment was not<br />
disadvantaged. I more than kept that promise.<br />
I continually came back to Tasmania to ensure that<br />
through consultation with a State Government which was, I<br />
may say, not terribly cooperative and with the trade<br />
unions and with the business community that you had a<br />
government in Canberra which was continually taking<br />
account of the interests of Tasmania. I have done that<br />
consistently In the area of Commonwealth-State relations, at each<br />
Premiers' confterence l've gone beyond what the formulas<br />
would've required to take account in a special way of the<br />
needs of Tasmania.<br />
I'm here now just before an election but I remind you<br />
that just after the election in 1987, the last election,<br />
I came over here in August of ' 87 and there acknowledged<br />
the importance of the tourism industry and gave a $ 30,000<br />
grant on a dollar for dollar basis with the Tasmanian<br />
Government to undertake special studies in regard to<br />
tourism. Those were to be done in the united Kingdom,<br />
Europe, Japan and North America with a view to trying to<br />
do what we could to maximise for Tasmania its share of<br />
growing inbound tourist traffic to Australia.<br />
So I simply give that background to say that from 1983<br />
until the present I as Prime Minister have had a<br />
particular concern to try to take account of the<br />
particular situation and difficulties of Tasmania. And<br />
therefore what I am announcing now is to be seen as a<br />
consistent part of the continuing concern for this State.<br />
So what I'm announcing today is t~ Pat the Government has<br />
accepted a series of recommendations from Duncan Kerr's </p>
<p>Commonwealth-State Task Force on Tasmania, this Task<br />
Force which 1 established in November of last year.<br />
These proposals which I am announcing today are designed<br />
to enhance Tasmania's economic and social development.<br />
I'm particularly glad to be doing this not only in the<br />
presence of you Duncan but in the presence of our other<br />
candidates over here -Gordon Lyons, Eugene you all know,<br />
and Nick Sherry.<br />
Now these developments which I am announcing, part of the<br />
package, are these. A $ 5 million package to improve the<br />
education and training opportunities available to young<br />
Tasmanians. 1* 1l say more about that in a moment. A<br />
grant of $ 3 million for the upgrading and the<br />
transferring of CSIRO's forestry division to the<br />
University of Tasmania; the establishment in Hobart of an<br />
Antarctic Foundation to promote Hobart as the centre of<br />
Australia's Antarctic activities and we'll be doing<br />
that at a cost of $ 1 million; restructuring assistance of<br />
$ 550,000 administrated by the office of Labour Market<br />
Adjustment for skills development in Tasmania; and a<br />
$ 75,000 feasibility study into a national hospitality<br />
training school located in Tasmania if it arises out of<br />
that feasibility study; and an offer to provide CSIRO and<br />
Commonwealth Government Department assistance and<br />
expertise to assist the Tasmanian Government in cleaning<br />
up the Derwent River.<br />
Further, the Commonwealth has nominated Hobart as an<br />
access port for Soviet fishing vessels. I want to say<br />
that during the recent visit to Australia of the Soviet<br />
Prime Minister Mr Ryzhkov I went out of my way<br />
deliberately to press representations on behalf of Hobart<br />
for it to be one or the cities to be chosen by the Soviet<br />
Union. I'm expecting decisions from the Soviet union in<br />
the near future on this matter.<br />
That's broadly the package. And of course the<br />
centrepiece of today's package, ladies and gentlemen, is<br />
the $ 5 million program for increasing the education and<br />
training opportunities for young Tasmanians. Because<br />
here we go right to the core, the very core of the<br />
problems, the peculiar problems confronting Tasmania.<br />
There's many things of which I'm proud of my seven years<br />
in-Government, but I think there is none of which I am<br />
more proud than that we have massively lifted the<br />
retention rate of our kids in the education system.<br />
Remember the facts. In the seven years before I came to<br />
office, a miserable two per cent lift in the retention<br />
rate from 34% to 35%. That was the grand total of the<br />
conservative commitment and achievement to lifting the<br />
retention rate of kids in Australian schools. Two<br />
points, from 34 to 36. We have lifted it in our seven<br />
years from 36 to 62. In other words from one in three of<br />
our kids staying on in school to two in three. But<br />
unfortunately, here in Tasmania, it hasn't shared in that </p>
<p>tremendous lift in the retention rate. Arnd indeed the<br />
retention rate in Tasmania is just under 40%. Now there<br />
you have the core of the problem. Because if your kids<br />
aren't staying on in school developing their talents then<br />
they are not going to be equipped to be able to do jobs<br />
that are going to be opening up and it then becomes, in a<br />
sense, a vicious circle of lost opportunity for the<br />
individuals and lost employment for the state.<br />
So we've decided that that should be the centrepiece of<br />
how we approach these issues of concern here in Tasmania.<br />
So with the collaboration of the state Government we will<br />
be launching a massive drive to encourage and to make it<br />
possible for children in the most disadvantaged schools<br />
in Tasmania to complete high school, to give them that<br />
flying start in life that participation in and retaining<br />
a place in the education system gives to young kids and<br />
which is increasingly the feature of the rest of<br />
Australia. We must see that Tasmania starts to reflect what is<br />
happening in the rest of Australia. And may I say that<br />
when young Tasmanians do complete high school, much<br />
better tertiary education and training opportunities will<br />
be available to them. Some 1300 more university places<br />
are being provided; the Tasmanian Science Equipment<br />
Centre is being upgraded and relocated; and the Youth<br />
Education Studies Centre is being established.<br />
I go next to the question of what I intend to do in this<br />
package to uplift forestry research capability in this<br />
State. CSIRO forestry research capability in this State<br />
is going to be expanded considerably by the $ 3 million<br />
that we'll be making available for relocation and<br />
improvement of the CSIRO's division of forestry. Due to<br />
the cooperation that we've had from the university of<br />
Tasmania, construction of a new facility and its<br />
association with the University of Tasmania will<br />
establish CSIRO's forestry research in Tasmania as a<br />
national centre for temporate forestry research.<br />
That of course, again, goes to an area where you have<br />
obvious potential advantages. We in the Commonwealth<br />
Government and in association particularly with the new<br />
Tasmanian Government, have been concerned with the<br />
environmental aspects of your forests. But we also in<br />
doing that want to make sure that consistent with our<br />
environmental concern we have as much research done as is<br />
going to make it possible to develop, particularly in the<br />
plantation area, the supplementation of cutting from what<br />
had previously been an exclusively, to a large extent,<br />
native forest. This new centre will enable that to be<br />
done. I go to the Antarctic Foundation. I believe that the<br />
establishment of an Antarctic Foundation in Hobart will<br />
help to confim Hobart, as it should be, as the centre of<br />
Australia's Antarctic activities. i'm very pleased to </p>
<p>say that I will be visiting the Antarctic Division this<br />
afternoon with my good friend Jacques Cousteau.<br />
Now my friends these various measures which I have<br />
referred to without going into full detail into all them<br />
were, as you know, developed by the Joint Commonwealth<br />
and Tasmanian Government Task Force on Tasmanian<br />
employment issues. That was chaired by my friend and<br />
colleague Duncan Kerr. I want to thank you Duncan. I<br />
certainly want to thank the two Federal Ministers, Peter<br />
Duncan and Michael Tate together with their Tasmanian<br />
counterparts. I also want to thank Tasmanian industry<br />
and the trade unions for their cooperation. This has<br />
been what good government and concern for regional areas<br />
is all about. You don't sit up in Canberra and try and<br />
pluck some idea out of the air. You get involved the<br />
people who are committed and responsible, concerned and<br />
knowledgeable, get them talking to the community<br />
interests and that's how this has arisen. I want to<br />
thank you Duncan and all who have been involved for it.<br />
When I set this taskforce up in November it was not to be<br />
a talkfest. I wanted it to be action-oriented, to come<br />
up and say these are the things that are relevant to<br />
addressing the needs of Tasmania. I thank you for coming<br />
up with sensible proposals. Your work hasn't finished.<br />
I want you to keep going and anything that you come up<br />
with will be seriously considered within the obvious<br />
constraints of fiscal responsibility. Because as<br />
distinct from our opponents, what we do we will fund.<br />
So I hope finally, ladies and gentlemen, it will be seen<br />
that here is -a package which is a consistent part of my<br />
ongoing commitment to Tasmania. Not something new but an<br />
another part of a continuing concern and commitment.<br />
What I want to see emerge from all this is a position<br />
where particularly the kids of Tasmania are going to be<br />
put in the position where they can have the same<br />
possibility of fulfilling their legitimate aspirations<br />
for education, training and employment in their own State<br />
as can Australians throughout the rest of the country.<br />
Thank you. Is there anything more you want to add to it<br />
Duncan? KERR: I don't think so Bob. That was a very<br />
comprehensive outline. But I'd certainly be happy to<br />
respond to any detailed guestions perhaps at the<br />
conciusion of this conference.<br />
PM: Let's deal with Tasmania. Any questions about this<br />
or Tasmania now and then we'll go to wider matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given the unique alliance between Labor and<br />
greenie dependence in Tasmania at the moment, will Labor<br />
direct preferences to them in the Senate and the House of<br />
Representatives instead of the Democrats?<br />
PM: Well I am not involved in what's happening in terms<br />
of allocation of preferences. That's a question if you </p>
<p>want to you can direct to those who may know better than<br />
myself. I Just don't know the answer. I don't get<br />
inlvolved in every State in the details of preference<br />
allocation. But if you want to ask a question of those<br />
who may be in a position to answer well quite happy to<br />
do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's been very difficult to get an answer.<br />
PM: Well then that may well be because in politics<br />
there's a lot of negotiation that goes on in politics.<br />
And in politics it's very rarely a one way street.<br />
Preference allocation involves what others do as well as<br />
what you do. I wouldn't be surprised if what's going on<br />
here is a fair bit of negotiation. That would be very<br />
sensible if it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: establishment of the Antarctic<br />
Foundation mean that Tasmania will eventually get<br />
Commonwealth funding for the Antactic Centre which was<br />
rejected in the last<br />
PM: That is possible. What's got to be done with this<br />
centre is we want to really increase public understanding<br />
of the importance of Antarctic issues. You know that<br />
I've never at all but as far as Australia is<br />
concerned, Hobart should be the centre of our Antarctic<br />
activities. We have argued that if the Antarctic Treaty<br />
partners are going to set up a Treaty Secretariat it<br />
should be Hobart. Made it quite clear. Nowhere else.<br />
Hobart is where it ought to be. Obviously Australia's<br />
involvement in matters concerning the Antarctic are<br />
increasing enormously. I have had the opportunity this<br />
morning of having a long breakfast session with my friend<br />
Jacques Cousteau who I met last year and with whom I've<br />
very quickly developed a very close personal and I think<br />
effective working relationship. It's a matter of very<br />
considerable pleasure to me to be able to share the<br />
information that we both have. There is absolutely no<br />
doubt that the Australian-French initiative to ban mining<br />
in the Antarctic and to have it created as a nature<br />
reserve with full environmental protection is gathering<br />
momentum around the world. Now to the extent that this<br />
happens and with the Australian initiative it's much more<br />
likely I think that you're going to see an increase in<br />
action-oriented activity which will make possible the<br />
emergence of and Antarctic Centre. But now I've not been<br />
adopting in the past a pie in the sky approach about<br />
this. As you'll see we've been concrete. We're now<br />
putting $ 1 million which is going to start developing the<br />
consciousness and obviously it will increase the<br />
understanding of the significance of Hobart as<br />
Australia's centre in the Antarctic. To the extent that<br />
Australia increases its involvement in the Antarctic, as<br />
it manifestly is, then it is more likely that what you<br />
refer to will take place. Let me say if we make that<br />
decision it will be a result or relevant staged processes<br />
and if it is done it will be fully funded. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What exactly<br />
PM: The concept is that it will in fact, as I say, have<br />
the charter of increasing the consciousness of<br />
Australians about the importance of Antarctic. In the<br />
past we've tended to have a sort of romantic idea about<br />
the Antarctic. It's down there, we had early explorers.<br />
We haven't really I think come to understand fully the<br />
nature of the significance or the Antarctic now. It's<br />
been seen more and more by scientists around the world as<br />
a unique continent. It's one which is pristine, it's<br />
untouched by human and industrial activity. SO it is a<br />
magnificent station on the continent for observing the<br />
impact of environmental changes uncomplicated by local<br />
industrial or human activity. what we want to do, and<br />
this Foundation is calculated to do it, is to increase<br />
the understanding in Australia in general, Tasmania in<br />
particular, but internationally, of the importance of<br />
these issues. It will have a distinguished independent<br />
chairman and basically that will be a to increase<br />
understanding of the importance of the Antarctic.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, news reports this morning that<br />
Britain is in fact using or having a far more positive<br />
response to Australia's initiative on the Antarctic than<br />
had been expected. What's your understanding of their<br />
position now and how will that possibly influence<br />
PM: I think really the emphasis has probably been the<br />
other way. I've heard some sort of indication that there<br />
may be some change within the United Kingdom. But it's<br />
certainly been within the United States where we are<br />
getting grounds for considerable enthusiasm as to the<br />
outcome. I would say that it is very unlikely that the<br />
United States will ratify the convention, the wellington<br />
Convention. Very unlikely they'll ratify it.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Why do I say that? I say it because there is first<br />
of all in the United States, as there is elsewhere in the<br />
world now, a very positive and growing response to the<br />
Australian-French initiative. Public opinion, as I<br />
predicted at the time when people, the sceptics were<br />
saying, oh what can you do. You wait and see. what is<br />
happening is that country after country is responding to<br />
public opinion. They are increasingly seeing a public<br />
view which said that it would be an obscenity to allow<br />
mining in the Antarctic. Now most specifically recently<br />
on the 7th of February in the United States there was a<br />
televised debate between who is the administration<br />
person in the United states who's invested many years of<br />
his life in the development of the Wellington convention,<br />
the Minerals convention. And in the televised debate<br />
between Senator Gore and Senator Gore recommited<br />
himself to support for the Australian position. Now..<br />
been legislative processes in the United states Congress </p>
<p>are moving in a way where all our intelligence suggests<br />
that it is unlikely that the United States will ratify.<br />
Now I think that's had its influence within the United<br />
Kingdom. That's where there's really been a more public<br />
development of an anti-convention position. And of<br />
course I've just had the Prime Minister of the Soviet<br />
Union here and he more than confirmed the recent<br />
statement of President Gorbachev. So if you look at<br />
what's happening, you've got, starting of f, Australia and<br />
France. We started it. Then we got some of the the<br />
Italians and the Dutch, some of the Scandinavians, the<br />
Germans making much more responsive noises, now the<br />
Soviet Union. I believe the Soviet Union and the Eastern<br />
bloc will be supportive. We've got the position now of<br />
the United States I think moving more to position nonratification.<br />
There are some signs in South America that<br />
Chile will be supportive and perhaps others. So I think<br />
we're entitled to have a much much more optimistic view.<br />
I think by the time we have the special meeting later<br />
this year, which has been agreed in Paris last year to be<br />
held to consider the Australian-French position, I think<br />
we're going to that with a very very sound position.<br />
This is another example of the way in which the<br />
Australian Government has taken an international lead on<br />
matters on environmental concern. Is there any other<br />
Tasmanian, just quickly and then we'll<br />
JOURNALIST: good raport with the Americans. Do you<br />
think there's a case for them to be asked to move their<br />
scientific base activities from Christchurch New Zealand<br />
to Hobart?<br />
PM: Well, I mean I don't want to declare war on New<br />
Zealand.<br />
JOURNALIST: I hope not.<br />
PM: It would create a quaint situation for you wouldn't<br />
it. We wouldn't to that. No, I think that would be<br />
a pretty gross act of unfriendliness if I were to do<br />
that. Let me say that I think you probably know that at<br />
the time when the difficulties between the United States<br />
and New Zealand were at their height on the question of<br />
the visit of United states ships there were some<br />
pressures within the United States and elsewhere to say<br />
oh well to New Zealand and we'll shift to Australia. It<br />
_ didn't seem to us that that was a very sensible thing to<br />
do. Nor do I think Tasmanians would've wanted that to be<br />
done. So I wouldn't think the United States would be<br />
doirW that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, at his news conference this<br />
morning can I go onto that?'<br />
PM: I'll just ask the locals first.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why are you focusing on Hobart during </p>
<p>PM: That's right. I'm going to be not just in the seat<br />
that we hold, Denison, but I will be going into Lyons for<br />
instance where we have Bob here. That, if I'm right the<br />
seat of Lyons Bob covers how much? What proportion of<br />
Tass is?<br />
BOB: Two thirds of Tasmania.<br />
PM* Two thirds of Tasmania. That's the seat that Bob<br />
Gordon's our candidate for. So I'm going into part of<br />
that. I will be returning. This is not my only visit.<br />
I would like to make a more extensive tour but as in all<br />
the other States I will not be going into every part of<br />
every State. But I will be coming back here again before<br />
the election.<br />
KERR: Just to wrap up the Tasmanian material, if I could<br />
close this section by just putting on record formally my<br />
thanks to the Prime Minister. He and his office have<br />
been an enthusiastic background to all the work we did on<br />
TasPact, initiating the program, seeing it through and<br />
steering it through. There are many detailed elements<br />
that are included in your detailed papers, including for<br />
example establishing an Asia-Pacific regional centre for<br />
sea transportation, elements which are going to be of<br />
vital importance to this State into the future. They're<br />
soundly based, they're costed, they've been established<br />
through a very sound consultative process and Bob I'm<br />
just absolutely delighted that we do have the this<br />
opportunity to place on record our thanks to you.<br />
PM: Thank-you. Hay I say, just finally on this, on the<br />
coatings. I hear with as we will be during this<br />
campaign and what you won't see from the other mob, the<br />
March 1.990 ERC scoresheet Labor's Fiscal Discipline.<br />
What you have set out here is on the top line the savings<br />
identified by the Treasurer in Wednesday's economic<br />
statement. They are set out not just for the first year<br />
but for the three years. There they are, the savings,<br />
$ 347.7 million, $ 547.8 million in the second year, $ 602.9<br />
million in the third year. Then the outlays announced in<br />
his statement, the Treasurer set out what the cost would<br />
be of our labour market ref rom program. Now today you<br />
have the second line, the Tasmanian package, set out,<br />
funded for each year. Which gives you then remainder of<br />
savings and that leaves outlays to be announced and the<br />
bottom line for the three years. In other words my<br />
friends you will be getting through this campaign, from<br />
this side of the campaign, the clear indications of cost<br />
of promises and how they are funded. You will not be<br />
seeing that from the other side. They are going to be<br />
burdened right through this campaign with a $ 6 billion<br />
credibility gap, where's the money coming from.<br />
JOURNALIST: At his news conference in Melbourne this<br />
morning Prime Minister, Andrew Peacock implied as<br />
strongly as he could that the Government was deliberately </p>
<p>thwarting his ability to get a good look at the documents<br />
relevant to the Elliott case.<br />
PH: I'll answer that question now and then as far as I'm<br />
concerned it's the end of the matter. Mr Peacock is<br />
deliberately attempting to misrepresent this situation.<br />
He is expecting that I and the Attorney-General would<br />
give him a greater access to NCA documents and material<br />
than the Attorney-General himself has. That is on its<br />
face an absurdity. What was promised is what will be<br />
delivered, and that is, in the face of the slur that was<br />
made by Mr Peacock and Mr Elliott on the integrity of my<br />
Attorney-General, Mr Peacock can see what the Attorney-<br />
General saw which was the basis upon which the request,<br />
from the MCA, that there should be a reference. Now Mr<br />
Peacock can see what the Attorney-General may have seen.<br />
It would be manifestly absurd. No-one would suggest that<br />
he should see more than the Attorney-General. That, as<br />
far as I'm concerned is clear and it is all that I'm<br />
going to say on it. Because I have only gone to this<br />
issue because they questioned the integrity of my<br />
Attorney-General. It is not appropriate, it would be<br />
against all practice for us to be getting into<br />
discussions about the operations of the NCA. I am not<br />
going to get into it any more.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mr Elliott effectively muzzled both you<br />
and Mr Keating with his defamation action and<br />
difficult to target him for the rest of the campaign?<br />
PM: Well let me say this Bob. I wasn't going to be<br />
about targeting Hr Elliott as such. I mean, as I've said<br />
before, Mr Elliott has said himself, and I can give you<br />
the transcript reference it you like. Hr Elliott has<br />
said that he has had an input into the formulation of the<br />
Liberal's economic policies. That's no surprise that he<br />
has. Now, all I have said before is that in reference to<br />
Mr Elliott in this campaign, not be as far as I'm<br />
concerned a personal attack on him. But he, if you like,<br />
represents, typifies the thrust of privilege, the thrust<br />
to privilege of the Opposition's economic policies.<br />
Because the simple fact is that under my Government we<br />
have put into the public coffers hundreds of millions of<br />
dollars which over the years will come to billions of<br />
dollars through a capital gains tax. Those billions of<br />
dollars will be used, as the proceeds already are being<br />
used-for the education of our kids for instance. what<br />
the Liberal's economic policy is about is to transfer<br />
those billions of dollars from our kids' education into<br />
the pockets of people like Mr Elliott. Now that's the<br />
sense in which Mr Elliott comes into it. But as far as<br />
he's concerned personally, I have no interest in him.<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawke, are you concerned that the Elliott<br />
question appears to have dominated this first week of<br />
your campaign? </p>
<p>PH: I don't think it's dominated this first week at all.<br />
It certainly, as I move around and hearing what people<br />
are saying, it hasn't dominated. Let's get the picture<br />
of what I think is the issue which in real terms has<br />
emerged with dominance from this week. what have you had<br />
from Mr Peacock? You've had from Mr Peacock a parroting,<br />
but not a consistent parroting, but you've had a<br />
parroting from Mr Peacock that they'll bring down<br />
interest rates. interest rates will come down under a<br />
coalition government. Now of course he hasn't been<br />
consistent, as I say. Early on it was going to be, from<br />
day one and massive, then it was going to be 15t, then<br />
the next day I didn't say that. I mean very<br />
inconsistent. But they would bring interest rates down.<br />
Now, what has also come through this week consistently is<br />
that they refused to give an outcome figure for wages and<br />
inflation. He said, to get interest rates down you've<br />
got to bring inflation down. But he will not give the<br />
Australian people an outcome figure for wages. If you<br />
cannot give an outcome figure for wages and then<br />
inflation you cannot make this promise about bringing<br />
interest rates down. It's like saying the cheque's in<br />
the mail. That's how good it is. The simple fact is<br />
they have no policies. They have no policies about<br />
bringing down inflation because they have no wages<br />
policy. Therefore what has emerged at the end of this<br />
week is that it is a nonsense. And as the campaign goes<br />
on it will be seen as a nonsense. You cannot say I'll<br />
bring down interest rates if you're not prepared to say<br />
to the Australian people this is what I expect the wages<br />
outcome to be. You'll remember, this is nothing new for<br />
Mr Peacock. -When he was confronted by all you<br />
journalists at the Gallery, the Press Gallery and asked<br />
the critical question it's critical not just about<br />
wages, it's critical about inflation, it's critical about<br />
whether you can bring down interest rates that is, what<br />
will the wages outcome be? He stood up, shrugged his<br />
shoulders and said ' who's to know'. Now if you don't<br />
know what the wages outcome is going to be you cannot,<br />
with credibility, say to the Australian people I'll bring<br />
down interest rates. The truth is that he can't give a<br />
wages outcome because, because he knows there will be a<br />
wages explosion under his policies, as there was before<br />
at the beginning of the ' 80a when they had the same<br />
policies. And if there's a wages explosion then interest<br />
rates don't come down. They go up and the economy<br />
collapses. That's what's come out of week one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, some of the commentators have<br />
given the coalition, not withstanding all that, the<br />
points for the first week. Is that your assessment<br />
PM: It certainly is not. Now, look. I just get back to<br />
the point of what are you really, what judgement are you<br />
making about the intelligence of the Australian<br />
electorate? I see that it comes up again and again<br />
during this week, as they talk about the week, the<br />
microphone incident in Sydney, where I had a lot of fun, </p>
<p>I thought, with the audience. They were certainly<br />
laughing with me. But the microphone incident in Sydney<br />
in the eyes of the profound political analysists, is the<br />
big thing of week one. Great deal. Now I was there. I<br />
laughed with and at the audience and with the media. But<br />
this in the eyes or the analysts is the profound thing<br />
about week one. Now I just happen to think, as I have<br />
always and you know from my discussions with you of<br />
people in the media I think the Australian people are<br />
more serious than all this. Do you really think that Bob<br />
Havke's observations about a sea of microphones is more<br />
important than what I've just talked about? That you<br />
have Andrew Peacock wandering around Australia uttering<br />
platitudes, saying I'll bring down interest rates. Not<br />
saying it consistently, contradicting himself one day<br />
from the other as to what he's really said, but<br />
nevertheless saying he's going to bring down interest<br />
rates, but refusing, refusing consistently during this<br />
week, and his economic spokesman as well, refusing to<br />
give a wages outcome. The people of Australia know that<br />
if a party seeking to become government cannot give a<br />
wages outcome, and can't give it because they know<br />
there's going to be a wages explosion under their policy,<br />
they know that interest rates must go up, that the<br />
economy explodes. Now I just happen to believe in my<br />
analysis of the Australian people that they regard those<br />
things as more important than the fact that Bob Hawke<br />
might have said something about a sea of microphones in<br />
the Opera House on Monday of this week.<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawke, much about perceptions as you<br />
go in the second week into the debate where people are<br />
going to form perceptions of your performance in that<br />
debate PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: How are you going to knock of f the<br />
perception that you've had a bad first week and get the<br />
campaign on the rails?<br />
PM: I don't think it's off the rails. I don't accept<br />
it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the outcome of the debate going to be<br />
PM; I don't know. We haven't had the debate yet. But I<br />
feel fairly confident about it. I think the debate will<br />
enhance existing perceptions. As I've said a couple of<br />
times before when I was asked about this, there's an<br />
interesting symmetry about the careers of Peacock and<br />
Hawke. In time that is, not in many other respects. But<br />
we've both been in public life for 30 years and I think<br />
people, y'know, have made their judgements about Hawke<br />
and Peacock in terms of seeing then around for 30 years.<br />
While, as I say, Itm confident about tomorrow night, I </p>
<p>think that that will essentially enhance the perceptions<br />
I have out of 30 years.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks are you concerned though that the<br />
television pictures that are coming out every night have<br />
Mr Peacock with mystery blondes, beautiful daughters,<br />
happy pictures<br />
PM: I'd be more concerned if they had me with mystery<br />
blondes. So would Hazel. Look at her over there.<br />
JOURNALIST: whereas the pictures of you are showing<br />
constantly the protests from the pilots.<br />
PM: Oh, constantly the protests from the pilots. Now<br />
I'm glad you bring that up. Look, let's get this quite<br />
clear. The pilots are saying very specifically that they<br />
want a vote for Andrew Peacock. The pilots out there<br />
constantly abusing me I accept, as I've said, as part<br />
of the democratic process. You haven't heard me complain<br />
once and you won't hear me complaining once. The only<br />
thing we have done I might say in regard to it is the<br />
police, and they informed me about it, they have got in<br />
touch with the Pilots Federation and said look, it's not<br />
a very sensible idea to have your kids there, your little<br />
kids there because that could, I mean I just think that's<br />
very silly. I hope that they do to because it would be<br />
terrible if something happened to the kids in these sorts<br />
of situations. 1 hope they won't have them there. But<br />
if they want to protest, well and good. But what the<br />
Australian people are seeing is a very simple thing.<br />
They are seering the pilots, understanding that Mr Peacock<br />
and the conservatives are their friends. why? Because<br />
last year the pilots declared war on the existing system.<br />
They said we want not a system where there is centralised<br />
control so that you can have predictable outcomes. We<br />
want it just to be straight-out bargaining in which we<br />
can go against our employers and get 30%. I've said no<br />
that's not on, please stay in the system. Mr Peacock and<br />
the opposition gave me carte blanche. Mr Peacock<br />
actually said what Australians need is for governments to<br />
get out of these disputes and out of pay fixing as such.<br />
So the pilots naturally want Mr Peacock to win because<br />
the Peacock policy is the pilot policy. That is, let the<br />
strong exercise their strength in a straightout conflict<br />
with their employer. They know that that's what happened<br />
in-the early ' 80s when the same policy was followed. Now<br />
I wasn't prepared to allow that to happen because I know,<br />
not in theoretical terms, but I know what it did to<br />
Australia at the beginning of this last decade. It<br />
brought the worst recession in 50 years because we had a<br />
wages explosion. Now the pilots wanted to do that again.<br />
They recognised that Mr Peacock would've allowed them to<br />
do it. Why shouldn't they be out there making as much<br />
noise as they can in favour of Mir Peacock? Now that's<br />
what it's about. It's part of the choice. I mean this<br />
election is about choices and I'm glad that in this<br />
democratic way that. fft happening I don't find it </p>
<p>pleasant, I must say I don't find it pleasant at all..<br />
I'm happy that they are dramatising a fundamental<br />
difference and a fundamental choice that the Australian<br />
people have to make. It's this. Do you want what the<br />
pilots and Peacock want? That is, open slather where the<br />
strong can use their strength to extract massive wage<br />
increases which will inevitably destroy the economy or do<br />
you want the Hawke position under which instead of having<br />
that conflict situation we've had a centrally-controlled<br />
wage system negotiated and which has given a rate of<br />
employment growth five times faster than under our<br />
predecessors. These are the choices that people have to<br />
make in this election for the future. Do you want the<br />
Peacock pilots wages policy or don't you? So to the<br />
extent that they are highlighting that then in a sense<br />
that's helpful. Although as I say personally I don't<br />
find it very pleasant.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, could I ask you a local question<br />
please? PH: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: When the Liberal launch their this<br />
week, they said that the Federal Government spends more<br />
on PM: They said what? Sorry, could you speak up.<br />
JOURNALIST: They said that you've spent more money on<br />
New Caledonia and Vanuatu than you did in Tasmania<br />
PM: Well that of course is not true. if you look at the<br />
package of money that we've spent in Tasmania over the<br />
period since I've been office, that's a nonsense. But we<br />
don't expect the truth from the Liberals. That's just<br />
another example of their untruths.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can we expect your child care<br />
initiatives this week?<br />
PM: You'll get some initiatives in regard to child care<br />
not before long in the campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you think the debate is a<br />
turning point for either side one side or the other<br />
9044<br />
PHI No. No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, now that you've had a chance to<br />
become aware of the debts of the Victorian State Bank, do<br />
you think it's right that Hr Jolly has refused to accept<br />
any responsibility for those debts?<br />
PH: well the position is, as Mr Jolly has put it, that<br />
there is no ministerial involvement in the commercial<br />
decision-making processes of the Bank. That's the </p>
