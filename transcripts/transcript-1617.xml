FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GJRANTS FOR 1967-68<br />
Statemnt by-the Primo iniatcr, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
For purposes of calculating the financial assistance<br />
grants for 1967-68 ( and for future yers) the Commonwealth<br />
has offered, and the States have accepted, the inclusion<br />
in the 1966-67 formula grants the amount of .5.0 million<br />
paid to the States in 1966-67 as a special addition to<br />
the formula grants for that year.<br />
The reduction in the time lag before movements in<br />
average wages are reflected in the grants has made it<br />
much more difficult than previously to estimate next year's<br />
formula grants at this point of time. However, after<br />
taking account of the addition of 4,5 million in the base<br />
for determining the 1967-68 grants, it is tontatively<br />
estimated that the formula grants payable to the States<br />
in 1967-68 will be about 900 million. This would be an<br />
increase of about W73 million, or about 6.9 per cent. on<br />
the total grants actually paid in 1966-67.<br />
The final figure of the formula grants will depend<br />
on the movement in average wages for the twvelve months<br />
ended IMarch, 1968 and on the increase in each State's<br />
population between December, 1966 . nd December, 1967.<br />
These will not be hnown until towards the end of the 1967-68<br />
financial year.<br />
The attached table shows the approximate estimated<br />
distribution of the % 9CO million as between the States.<br />
