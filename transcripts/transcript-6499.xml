INTERVIEW WITH MARK DAY 3AW, 4.20PM, THURSDAY 11 OCTOBER 19: 34<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
MD Before you came on the line I was saying that I thought<br />
you probably pinched yourself wih disbelief at this morning's<br />
headlines; the Hawke Government on the latest Poll results could<br />
be returned with a 78 seat majority and on the same Poll results<br />
even a chance of grabbing power fn the Senate. Do you place<br />
much store by those Polls?<br />
PM Oh one takes a lot of acqount of the polls Mark, but riot<br />
in a complacent way. There is ar identity of polling at the<br />
moment between the Bulletin poll ' and the poll in the Age which<br />
has it at 55% and obviously one would prefer to be there than<br />
lower. As I say there is no complacency, we have got a campaign<br />
to go into now and I will be taking the Australian electorate into<br />
my confidence, talking to them about our record of achievement and<br />
comparing what we have done with the alternative and seeking to<br />
translate the confidence that quite clearly does exist now into<br />
the final poll that matters, the ! ballot box.<br />
MD Would you expect some natural evening up of things as the<br />
campaign progresses. If you look at political history, that<br />
tends to happen.<br />
PM No what you tend to get in the actual campaign, I think<br />
is often a strengthening of government position but I believe.....<br />
MD How much more can you strengthen?<br />
MORE*@*** 3 1 </p>
<p>CONT.... PM Oh, well in politics if ou're dinkum in your approach<br />
to the people you go flat out to do the best you can. That's what<br />
the electorate expects of you. You would be insulting the electorate<br />
Mark if you win in a half-hearted way, and I know the people<br />
don't expect that of me. We believe that the Australian electorate<br />
has already made a judgement about the Opposition. They have<br />
repudiated, I think massively repudiated the tactic of smear and<br />
innuendo and baseless allegations which seem to have become an<br />
intrinsic part of the approach of this Opposition and its leader.<br />
I think that the people don't like that and are not going to like<br />
it in the future.<br />
MD I said in my opening preamble before you came on that I<br />
think there are a couple of stor clouds, not enough to put you<br />
out of government or business, but I detect and leaving aside the<br />
rights and wrongs of the assets tlest debate, I detect that there<br />
is a ection of the community and possibly a large section of the<br />
aged community which does fear or feel fearful that the government<br />
is putting their pensions at threat. Now I don't say that that's<br />
correct, but would you agree that the fear does exist?<br />
PM In a small section there has been the fear created by the<br />
totally untruthful fearmongerini of the Opposition who have tried<br />
to suggest that there are going to be inspectors coming into the<br />
homes of pensioners. They know that that's not true. In fact, 98%<br />
of pensioners will not be affected by the assets test. As the<br />
month of November goes on and the forms go out, the information goes<br />
out the, overwhelmingly, that 98% of pensioners will come to<br />
understand that they are not adversely affected. What will also<br />
be clear as the campaign goes on is that the Opposition basically<br />
Ss upports an assets test. Mr Howard quite clearly supports an assiets<br />

test. All he has said, he doesn't support the particular proposals<br />
that have been put forward. But he clearly supports and assets<br />
test. As does Mr Elliot the leading figure and another contendent<br />
for the leadership of the Opposition, a leading figure in the<br />
Liberal Party. They know that as the society develops we have<br />
a larger proportion of aged people we've got to make sure, any<br />
government has to make sure that' the resources it has for payments<br />
in the social welfare area are kept as far as possible for those<br />
who most need the support of the community and that we shouldn't<br />
waste and dissipate those resources on a very, very wealthy asset<br />
rich minority.<br />
MD You do you fear any back ash from the passionate stand that<br />
the ant-nuclear people have takep on the government's policy on<br />
Uranium and the export of uranium.<br />
PM No, there are two things to be said about that. Firstly<br />
that I think increasingly, and all the polls show this on the<br />
issue, a clear majority of voters support our position on uranium.<br />
A very clear majority, but secondly, I would say that more and more<br />
people are coming to understand that you must distinguish between<br />
the peaceful uses of uranium for the purposes of generating power<br />
which is one of the underlying cbnditions of the non-oliferation<br />
treaty to which Australia is a signatory and the question of<br />
nuclear-disarmament. There is no government in the history of<br />
this country who has done more to put issues of disarmament at<br />
the forefront of their priorities in the conduct of International<br />
Affairs. We have done that and people are increasingly understanding<br />
this distinction. Then the 3rd point of course is that while some<br />
may give their first prefeences. to the Nuclear-disarmuamfent Party<br />
more </p>
<p>or the Democrats on this issue, tjhey know that as between this<br />
Labor Government and the Conservative coalition that the Conservative<br />
Coalition position is infinitely more unacceptable than ours.<br />
MD That's the ultimate irony isn't it? Even though they<br />
might not like your policy they have got nowhere to go.<br />
PM Well, if they are being objective about it, if they want<br />
to take their feelings to the point of registering a first preference<br />
vote for thc NDP ultimately, bot oon altornative governmantg. T<br />
is the Labor Government which is infinitely more committed to<br />
pursuing the path of Nuclear disarmament negotiations than the<br />
Conservatives.<br />
MD Could it have a negative'affect on you in the Senate voting?<br />
PM Well, no, the they wilt not get enough votes to get a<br />
representation in their own right and the same argument I've put<br />
just applies, I think.<br />
MD Yes. From what you said in Parliament today, about the<br />
complete review of taxes and forms of taxation, it would seem that<br />
you are not fearful of a 1980 style backlash against Labor on a<br />
capital gains tax.<br />
PM No because I have made i4 quite clear that we have no<br />
f<br />
committment to particular forms of taxation change.<br />
MD But there is difference when comparedto your 1983<br />
policy speech where you had a very firm committment to no capital<br />
gains tax.<br />
PM The position is that the e has to be a review of the<br />
whule taxation system and in that review groups in the community<br />
more..... kA. PSW I<br />
V..<br />
cont 4 </p>
<p>the business group, trade unions, welfare organisations, will be<br />
wanting to put there proposals in regard to taxation, What I have<br />
said on behalf of the government; that we have no pre-committments.<br />
You can not pre-judge community consultation and say what is going<br />
to happen that is silly. If I were to say, well we won't look at<br />
that, we won't look at that, then you are making a mockery of the<br />
process of community consultation; I<br />
MD The Labor party has been called a high tax party from<br />
time-to-time.<br />
PM Well, incorrectly, of course because the highest taxing<br />
1 party in government has been the iberal National Party coalition.<br />
It was in their last two years of government that the tax take was<br />
at the highest percentage of all time. Our tax take as a proportion<br />
of GDP when you exclude as you must do the medicare levy, because<br />
the medicare levy is merely substitution of what people were paying<br />
out in private insurance payments' for that exclusion our take<br />
iSs less than the last two years of the Liberal National Party<br />
S Government. MD Ye, I think it really culd be described though as a<br />
matter of perception. Public perbeption that the money has to<br />
come from somewhere now this morning Mr Keating is quoted as<br />
pledging to reduce the deficit now to my way of thinking that<br />
means either a government has to reduce its services or get a<br />
greater income. Now doesnt a greater income mean...<br />
PM With respect Mark, I don't wish to be rude, -btt you don't<br />
understand basic economic analysis. You can achieve the<br />
position of a lower deficit and no increase in the overall level<br />
of taxation provided that your gross in outlays is lower than the </p>
<p>cont 6<br />
economic growth in the period inrquestion, and that is exactly<br />
the committment that I have madv ' wid the Treasurer has made. In<br />
the next budget, we will further reduce the deficit without increasing<br />
the overall level of taxes because the gross in outlays will be less<br />
than economic growth.<br />
MD So in other words, yes e~ onomic growth provides you with<br />
a greater income.<br />
PM Yes of course it does.<br />
MD Well, now that was what was getting to. I was going to<br />
say, how are going to get that g eater income? Which you have<br />
just explained.<br />
PM Well I don't know whether you want to use your program<br />
as a sort of means of having an qconomic disiertation to you, but<br />
I just assure you that the facts' basic economic analysis is<br />
quite simple. If you have got an existing level of deficit, and<br />
outlays and taxes, and you are ir a position of economic growth<br />
which is what we have produced aJ distinct from the stagnation<br />
of the past then you can have a eduction in the deficit and no<br />
increase in the overall level of Itaxation any further real<br />
you can do that by ensuring that tas you go into the next period<br />
the growth in outlays that takes place is at a lower level than<br />
the rate of growth because it if You do that it mean6 that you<br />
can have, as I say, a reduction of the deficit. We have in fact,<br />
in two years, reduced the deficit; from the 9.6 Billion that<br />
was what we were inheriting and we reduced that in our first<br />
year to 8.4 billion, now for this' current year we have reduced it<br />
to 6.7 billion down from 9.6 to; about 6.7, a reduction in the<br />
deficit of 3 billion dollars in 2, years.<br />
more.... a" </p>
<p>cont.... 7<br />
MD As you go into this review of types of taxes what will<br />
be the basis of your decsion makiig?<br />
A<br />
PM Well, it'll be the same b4sis as we have so spectacularly<br />
successfully employed in our peri6d in office. That is that we<br />
will have meaningful consultationj with representative groups<br />
in the community and try and move as far as we can to a consensus<br />
of view about what is the most appropriate set of decisions to take.<br />
Planning<br />
I have already started that process Within the EconomictAdvisory<br />
Council where the business community and the trade unions and<br />
welfare organisations, State governments and Local governments are<br />
represented. So the process of consultation is begun, it will<br />
continue both within the Economic Planning Advisory Council<br />
and in more broadly based forms and we will listen and analyse what<br />
the groups in the community are t lking about and suggesting and<br />
as a Government will then move tn; mTake the decisions which reflect<br />
the wishes of the community according to the 2 criteria which<br />
are relevant in regard to tax. T at is a tax system which is going<br />
to satisfy the requirements of economic efficiency and equity.<br />
MD After the first summit, iimediately after you were elected<br />
you set up EPAC the consultative organisation, do you see any need<br />
possibly for a new summit, perhaps early next year?<br />
PM Well no I don't see it at this stage as being necessary,<br />
but then I don't preclude it, the Economic Planning Advisory Council<br />
is if you like Mark the summit concept in a reduced<br />
MD Mini form<br />
PSM Mini form, yes thats right Mark. Its on a statutory basil<br />
we've established a very efficient secretariat to service the<br />
EPAC, but I don't preclude the idea that as we go on further it may<br />
more.... </p>
<p>cont 8<br />
be a useful idea to have another summit so the Australian community<br />
can review the very significant achievements how we have turned<br />
the economy and the society arouid and on the basis of that to<br />
get view about the next stage. That is a possibility, but we<br />
have made no specific plans at this point for it.<br />
MD How long do you think tho accord can hold up if we<br />
continue at the current rate of growth or recovery. Not being an<br />
economist I don't know quite which word to u. se. But if we keep<br />
going along well, as we have been, and productivity lifts how<br />
long before the unions say hey, we want a share of this action?<br />
PM Well I have every confidence that the accord will hold<br />
because you see we are now into the second year of strong economic<br />
growth, and in the past what has happened in Australia because we<br />
haven't had this consensual approach which I developed, Lhe; i<br />
unions and businesses have broke out and tried to make higher claims,<br />
either by way of significant wage increae claims or in the other<br />
side by pricing decisions which increase shares. But now there<br />
h4L uuu tho rualioation on thc pcart of the busainess c6mmunity and<br />
the trade unions that they are better off and the community is<br />
better off if they excercise restraint in the claims they make upon<br />
thec ommunity's resources. The business community is better of' now<br />
than it has been for a decade, the levels of profitability are<br />
back to what they were at the en4 of the 60' s and 1970' s. The<br />
trade unions have seen a situation where employment has increased<br />
1<br />
h million new jobs, today's employment figures are very, very<br />
Sgratifying, again show significant improvement. The trade unions<br />
are better off, the business cormunity is better off, so I have<br />
no doubt that the accord is going to hold.<br />
MD But I would have thought that if profitability started<br />
booming and getting better than ijust recovering to late<br />
more..... </p>
<p>cont.... 9<br />
levels then somewhere along the line Mr Dolan would say,<br />
now is the time for us to do away with a dgPree of wago restrain L?<br />
PM No, well, you can say that. All the evidence, factual<br />
Sevidence, is to the contrary. The ACTU has firmly expressed its<br />
Scontinuing committment to the accord. Now I don't think you have<br />
any justification for saying th4t hhving adhered to their committment<br />
now, right through this period, they are going to break that<br />
committment. You've got no right to question their integrity.<br />
MD No, I don't question their integrity.<br />
PM What I'm saying is that they have specifically made the<br />
Sd ecision that they remain committd to the accord, I accept their<br />
Sc ommittment.<br />
MD Okay, Mr Hawke, I know thot you are pressed on time,<br />
Because you were late coming on I must get moving.<br />
MD No, we were here,... One question please if I may. Mr<br />
Peacock yesterday put out a list f 120 broken promises, have you<br />
had time to go through the 120 and do you agree you've broken any<br />
of them?<br />
PM NO The media have dealt vith that, they have been<br />
extraordinarily dismissive about Mr Peacock's list because it started<br />
of with one which by any definition could not be a broken promise.<br />
So it is a fact that because of the gross deception that was practised<br />
by Mr Peacock's government of which he was a part when we went into<br />
the last election campaign they eceived us and the Australian<br />
community to the extent of 3.6 billion dollars and we inherited<br />
therefore not a deficit situation bf 6 billion that they were<br />
telling everyone but 9.6 billion apd so that imposed an enormous<br />
amount of constraint upon us. I s id on the last Wednesday of Lhe<br />
election campaign at the National ress Club and it went out to the<br />
more </p>
<p>whole of Australia that if, in fact, we found that we had been<br />
decieved then we would have to review the program that we promised,<br />
and that's what we have responsibly done. The basic promise<br />
that I made, that is to turn the; economy around from stagnation<br />
to growth, has been achieved and! in part has been achieved because<br />
we had to shape our program to tbe situation we inherited and<br />
that basic promise has been magnificently achieved. When we<br />
inherited office with economic stagnation, rocketing unemployment,<br />
I turned that around instead of how being a stagnant economy we<br />
have the fastest growing economy in the world. Instead of a<br />
growth of unemployment of kmilliqn in the year before we came to<br />
office we have increased the number of jobs by a 4 of a million.<br />
Instead of 11.2% inflation that we inherited we have halved inflation.<br />
SW e have brought interest rates dcwn, These are the basic committments<br />
I made to the community overall and underlying all those magnificent<br />
economic achievements has been the basic achievement. I said we<br />
* i would bring Australia together. We would end the confrontation<br />
and the divisiveness of the past. We have achieved that, we<br />
have delivered that promise, and pn the basis of the delivery<br />
of that promise all other, all the other results have flowed,<br />
MD Mr Hawke, I think you just made a campaign speech. On<br />
that note, I would say thank you very much fur coming on the program<br />
and I hope we will be talking more during the campaign.<br />
PM Allways good to talk to you Mark.<br />
