1292 Estimates 1961-62. [ REPRESENTATIVES..' siaes16-2<br />
Director-General of Security, one would<br />
imagine that the Government would take<br />
some further action to see that she did not<br />
remain a resident of Australia but if the<br />
Government attempted to send her out of<br />
Australia, obviously it would be obliged to<br />
reveal in the courts at least some of the<br />
grounds on which a certificate of naturalization<br />
has been refused.<br />
I have only a few minutes left so I shall<br />
refer to only one other case which concerns<br />
a Portuguese gentleman also. He has been<br />
resident in Australia for many years. He<br />
was deported from Portugal as a young<br />
man. He has never been inside a police<br />
court in Australia or in his own country.<br />
According to him-and I have no ' reason<br />
to doubt him, and knowing what we do<br />
about the Government of Portugal it could<br />
be possible-he was seized and put on a<br />
ship because he was the secretary of his<br />
local municipal workers union. He was<br />
sent to Portuguese Timor, and after a<br />
number of years there he managed to come<br />
to Australia. For many years he has been<br />
~ rking on the Sydney waterfront. This<br />
' wan applied for a certificate of naturalization<br />
and, on the basis of a security report.<br />
it was refused.<br />
I think there should be some answer to<br />
e details of these cases that have been<br />
* vealed to mc. There should be some<br />
opportunity for these people to reply to<br />
some of the allegations and charges that<br />
are made against them. If this is the type<br />
of activity in which the security organization<br />
is engaged, how can any member of the<br />
Australian community have confidence in it?<br />
I ask the Prime Minister and the Attorney-<br />
General ( Sir Garfield Barwick), who share<br />
the responsibility for this organization, to<br />
give some answer to this criticism.<br />
e Mr. MENZIES ( Kooyong-Prime Minis-<br />
Wer and Minister for External Affairs)<br />
[ 3.59.-I do not propose to detain the committee,<br />
but I want to say a few words about<br />
what has now become an annual feature of<br />
. thiesoe Enstima. tes -a discussion on educa-<br />
Before I do that, I might perhaps<br />
Orelieve the mind of my friend who spoke<br />
about tourism by saying to him that if he<br />
looks in the estimates of the Department<br />
of Trade he will find that this year our subvention<br />
to the Australian National Travel Association is Å 150,000, having risen to<br />
that amount by stages over a period of<br />
years. I am not going to rehearse what I have<br />
frequently spoken about before-the attitude<br />
of the Government to the education problem<br />
-because that is quite well known, but I<br />
do think perhaps I might, in a very<br />
few words, bring up to date what I have<br />
said before. I first of all clear away one or<br />
two misconceptions. Several speakers have<br />
quoted figures-not always identicalrepresenting<br />
the percentage of gross national<br />
product which Australian expenditure on<br />
education represents, and have compared<br />
that unfavorably with expenditure in other<br />
countries. It is very dangerous to make these<br />
comparisons too hastily because, in fact,<br />
in at least some of the countries which have<br />
been set up by way of comparison, 90 per<br />
cent. of the expenditure on primary and<br />
secondary schools and so on is government<br />
expenditure. In Australia, it -happens that<br />
75 per cent. of expenditure on education<br />
is government expenditure and the other<br />
per cent, is the result of other causes, and<br />
comes from other sources. Therefore, a<br />
precise comparison cannot be made. If, in<br />
Australia, 90 per cent. were dealt with in<br />
what in effect would be government schools<br />
and institutions, then the percentage that<br />
educational expenditure would represent<br />
here would rise quite materially, as must be<br />
quite clear to honorable members.<br />
Another honorable member had something<br />
to say about the pressure that immigration<br />
had put on the capacity of the States<br />
in this matter. indeed, he and several others<br />
have sought to create an impression that we<br />
are in a critical condition, that the whole<br />
State educational structure is in effect in a<br />
state of crisis. There are two answers to<br />
that, and I shall just mention each of them<br />
quite briefly. in the first place, let me say<br />
that the increase in government school enrolments<br />
was about 7 per cent. in 1952.<br />
That percentage has diminished year by<br />
year, and by 1960 was only 31 per cent.<br />
And that fall is expected to continue until<br />
the annual increase represents something of<br />
the order of 2 per cent. These figures do<br />
not demonstrate a crisis. On the contrary,<br />
they demonstrate that the pressure of<br />
demand is rising not at the rapid rate of<br />
which it was rising six or seven years ago,<br />
but at a very much more moderate one.<br />

<p>EEsittmi1a9atet1e( -6sS6 P . T1 E916B91E1-R6. ] 2 . 1293<br />
The second thing I want to say is that<br />
it has become quite the fashion now to say<br />
that the Commonwealth sits idly by. I have<br />
been accused of the most frightful indifference<br />
to the educational demands of the<br />
country, and I find that a rather odd allegation<br />
to be made against me, since I venture<br />
to say that no Prime Minister has been so<br />
active in this field as I have and that with the<br />
complete support of both sides of this Parliament.<br />
The fact that to-day the Commonwealth<br />
is spending fifteen times as much on<br />
universities as it was spending ten years ago<br />
is trifling to some, I suppose, but it is worth<br />
recalling. The fact that we -have done so<br />
much in the university field has rather<br />
created a false impression in the public<br />
mind, an impression which is carefully fostered<br />
by some people, that we are making no<br />
contribution whatever to the State problem<br />
of primary and secondary education.<br />
What are the facts? It is quite true that<br />
we do not make specific grants, but, before<br />
people become too steeped in gloom, let<br />
me say that our Commonwealth general<br />
revenue grants to the States have risen<br />
during my term-over this decade-from<br />
f102,000,000 to an estimated E302,000,000<br />
this year. In other words, it has trebled<br />
in that time. The expenditure by the States<br />
from Consolidated Revenue on education,<br />
this field in which we are supposed<br />
indifferently to have starved them, was, in<br />
round figures, Å 38,000,000 in 1950-51, and<br />
Å 140,000,000 in 1960-61. So that, in spite<br />
of this beggarly treatment of which we are<br />
accused, the States were able to increase<br />
their expenditure on education from<br />
Å 38,000,000 to Å 140,000,000 over a period<br />
of time in which our revenue grants to the<br />
States were trebled. I venture to say that<br />
those are very remarkable figures.<br />
Turning to the capital side, I say once<br />
. wmoreh thaot althloeugh I think that on the<br />
the States have coped splendidly with<br />
their educational problem, they certainly<br />
could not have coped with the building<br />
demand, the capital establishment of their<br />
schools, if it had not been for the treatO<br />
fmiresnt t tipmroev idined thbey hthisitso rGy oovfe rnthme enCto mfomr otnh-e<br />
wealth, because, beginning with 1951-52,<br />
this Government has found from taxation,<br />
from the Budget and from general Commonwealth<br />
resources, an average of about<br />
Å 80,000,000 a year by way of assistance to State works programmes. In other<br />
words, the short fall of loan raisings for<br />
approved programmes has always been<br />
taken up by us and, over that period, that<br />
has in fact averaged no less than<br />
Å 80,000,000 a year. In one year it was up<br />
as high as Å E152,000,000, and in another<br />
year it was down to a relatively small<br />
figure, but, over the whole period, the<br />
amount provided was about Å 800,000,000.<br />
Quite plainly, without that assistance, the<br />
States could never have maintained their<br />
capital expenditure.<br />
So, on the revenue side, and on the<br />
capital side, it must be perfectly clear to<br />
anybody that because of the way in which<br />
we have improved revenue grants to the<br />
States, because of the new formula that<br />
was devised to the unanimous satisfaction<br />
of the States, a formula which took into<br />
account increases in school population and<br />
things of that kind, the States have been<br />
enabled to do something of which they are,<br />
I think, very properly proud.<br />
Somebody wanted to tell us that at the<br />
last conference of Commonwealth and State<br />
Ministers the Premiers unanimously wanted<br />
us to go into this field, that they wanted<br />
emergency grants, that they wanted a fullblooded<br />
inquiry. I will take one of them<br />
by way of type, because that will be<br />
sufficient for my purposes. I shall take Mr.<br />
Bolte. After Mr. Heifron had put forward<br />
his proposal very briefly, in a mild and<br />
disarming way, Mr. Bolte said-<br />
I support their case on the general level, but<br />
I point out that in presenting a ca-se for them<br />
we may be thought to he admitting in some way<br />
that we are not doing a very good job in the<br />
field of education. Such an inference would<br />
not be correct. I think that the position in other<br />
States is much the same as is that in Victoria.<br />
In the current financial year, we are spending<br />
close on Å 60,000,000 on educaetion, and a lot<br />
of the departments other than that concerned<br />
with education are perhaps becoming Cinderellas<br />
for the benefit of education. I firmly believe that<br />
if we can continue to spend at the present rate<br />
we can handle the situation. I am perfectly<br />
frank about the matter. I am not here to admit<br />
in any way that Victoria is behind the door with<br />
respect to making provision for the educational<br />
requirements of the present generation and future<br />
generations. Having said that he went on to say-<br />
But I think that one aspect of education should<br />
have special attention. That is technical<br />
education.<br />

That was his view, and it is an entirely intelligible<br />
one. But I have mentioned these<br />
figures in order to remind the House,<br />
which * hears certain things from year to<br />
year with some regularity, that Commonwealth-<br />
State financial relations have been<br />
conducted, I believe, with such justice and<br />
liberality that the States have been able<br />
to achieve in the educational field the<br />
results that we all know of to-day.<br />
Mr. Reynolds.-But they all want more<br />
money. Mr. MENZIES.-Of course everybody<br />
will ask for money from the Commonwealth.<br />
That is the easiest thing in the<br />
world. You seem to think that we just<br />
say abracadabra " and down comes<br />
100,000,000. We have to be a bit responsible<br />
in handling the finances. We are not<br />
handling them theoretically. I said and<br />
I repeat-ho-iorable members will appreciate<br />
the significance of it-that these<br />
figures demonstrate beyond doubt how<br />
false is the argument that we stand by indifferently.<br />
I have an old-fashioned preju-<br />
* dice in favour of doing one thing at a time.<br />
We tackled this university probleman<br />
enormous problem-and but for what<br />
we did, the universities would have been<br />
complctely bankrupted and the development<br />
of universities would have been<br />
frustrated for a decade. I am very pleased<br />
that we were able to assist the universities<br />
and, I bzelieve, to open up a new future<br />
for them. We then established the Universities<br />
Commission. You cannot provide<br />
for university development a month at a<br />
time. You must do it as the commission<br />
decided, and as we agreed, in three yearly<br />
terms, the triennium, as it is called, and<br />
we have just approved in this Parliament<br />
of the current triennium expenditure. At<br />
the same time as approving of it we told<br />
the Universities Commission, under Sir<br />
Leslie Martin, that we thought it very desirable<br />
to have an examination made of<br />
the whole future structure of tertiary education;<br />
not just taking for granted that what<br />
may bz called the traditional type of<br />
university is the only answer to the problem,<br />
but letting our minds run on to consider<br />
whether we might not need special<br />
technological institutes of some kind or<br />
other. To meet the demands of the modern world there may be a call for various grades<br />
or types of tertiary educational establishments.<br />
For that purpose we have appointed<br />
a special committee, and a very powerful<br />
one, I think. It is widely representative,<br />
containing in it not only high-quality expert<br />
opinion but business experience and<br />
financial experience. We anticipate-not<br />
in a month or two months, because this<br />
will be a long job-getting from that committee,<br />
which will sit under the chairmanship<br />
of Sir Leslie Martin, a report which<br />
we can then take up with the States in order<br />
to see whether, for the future, some other<br />
system of finance must be worked out.<br />
We do not decide whether th. ere is<br />
going to be a new university at, say, Shortland.<br />
It is not a political decision by us.<br />
This is one of the problems, first of all, for<br />
the State Government, because it establishes<br />
universities and the Commonwealth<br />
does not, and, secondly, for the Universities<br />
Commission, which will discuss the requirements<br />
and the appropriateness of what is<br />
proposed to be done and then make<br />
recommendations to us. When all that is<br />
added to by the report of this committee<br />
on tertiary education generally, which will<br />
include technological education, then we<br />
will be to that extent further forward.<br />
I do not beguile myself into believing<br />
that this is not going to cost more money,<br />
because every investigation into a problem<br />
of this kind comes up with recommendations<br />
which cost money to implement. But<br />
having tackled the problem of universities<br />
in the broad we did not pause there. We<br />
turned to that important branch of medical<br />
training, the teaching hospitals and clinical<br />
instruction generally. We set up a committee<br />
to examine that. I have not seen its<br />
report yet, but it came near me one day<br />
and it sounded, even at that distance, pretty<br />
costly. But, anyhow, it is either in or on<br />
the way in, because we realize that the<br />
work done by teaching hospitals in the<br />
training of medical practitioners is a branch<br />
of tertiary education that cannot be<br />
excluded simply because it is not conducted<br />
actually within the four walls of a<br />
university. I mention these matters to show that, so<br />
far from being indifferent, we have had<br />
a lively and imaginative mind on these<br />
problems. We have pursued these matters<br />
( REPRESENTATiVES.] Fstimates 1961-62. </p>
<p>Estim1Sa9E-e6P6sT 2 E.[ M26B ER, 1961.] Esmas1912. 29<br />
as and when we could, and pursued them at<br />
great outlay, while, at the same time, our<br />
financial arrangements with the States have<br />
put the States, to use a homely phrase, in<br />
funds" as they never were before, to carry<br />
out their educational activities, with the<br />
result-I conclude by repeating it-that the<br />
educational expenditure of the States on<br />
their own purposes has gone up from<br />
Å 38,000,000 to Å 140,000,000 over the<br />
period of office of this Government.<br />
Mr. CAIRNS ( Yarra) think it<br />
is very significant that the Prime Minister<br />
( Mr. Menzies) has chosen the subject of<br />
education on which to speak in relation to<br />
the estimates for his own department. This<br />
I think correctly and rightly bears the<br />
assumption that he considers that of all the<br />
subjects he could have spoken about in ' this<br />
debate, education is the most important.<br />
He began by saying that he intended to<br />
clear away a number of misconceptions and<br />
in order to make his speech more effective<br />
he started by stating one hinmself. He stated<br />
t hat the Opposition and other critics had<br />
said that his Government had ' stood idly<br />
by and had been indifferent to the needs of<br />
education. This was not the position taken<br />
by the Opposition or by the other critics.<br />
Our view is that during the last ten years<br />
the Government has provided substantially<br />
for education but that it has not treated the<br />
matter with the urgency that it needs and<br />
that it deserves and demands. In order to<br />
make his answer to our criticisms more<br />
effective the right honorable gentleman<br />
overstated them. He created his own case<br />
so as to be able to demolish it more easily.<br />
He had practically nothing to say about<br />
our case. But in the course of doing this<br />
the Prime Minister attempted to show that<br />
there is not any urgency about the problem<br />
of edu:: ation and that there is not a crisis<br />
Ois nta tteh e tphree sepnrets ' s~ intut atdioefni. c ienOcniees neoefd endoutc aotvioernto<br />
know that that attitude is not consistent<br />
with answering quickly enough the needs<br />
of education.<br />
The Prime Minister began by saying that<br />
O it is dangerous to make comparisons<br />
between the proportions of the gross<br />
national product spent by different countries<br />
upon education. He said that whereas<br />
in Australia about 90 per cent. of expenditure<br />
on education is by governments, in some other countries the position is very<br />
different. All this is true, but it still remains<br />
true also that the 1.9 per cent. of the gross<br />
national product spent on education in<br />
Australia is not any more than half of the<br />
amount that is spent by othcr countries in a<br />
comparable position. When one allows for<br />
the different significance of the types of<br />
expenditure there is still a very great deal in<br />
Australia to be concerned about in this<br />
respect. The Prime Minister contended that the<br />
proportion of new enrolments had reached<br />
the highest point in 1952 and had then commenced<br />
to diminish. This is also not strictly<br />
true. There has been a variation in the level<br />
of enrolments. However, assuming for the<br />
sake of argument that the statement is true,<br />
the position is that the main case for improvements<br />
in education in Australia has not<br />
been based upon an increase in the proportion<br />
of students each year, but on the existing<br />
deficiencies. The various inquiries and<br />
reports made by educationists in Australia<br />
have been concerned primarily with the<br />
large classes, with the insufficient number<br />
of teachers, with the insufficiency of buildings<br />
and with the large capital requirements,<br />
in existing circumstances, without any question<br />
of increasing numbers of students. Ainy<br />
one who knows anything of primary education,'<br />
particularly in this country, knows that<br />
the case put forward by the educationists<br />
about inadequacies on present standards,<br />
leaving aside entirely any increases in numbers<br />
of students, has been proved up to the<br />
hilt. I suggest that it is not satisfac'ory or<br />
pleasing to those concerned with education<br />
in Australia to know that the Prime Minister<br />
comes into the Parliament and attempts to<br />
make a case, claiming that records have<br />
been created and that there is no urgent need<br />
to improve the situation.<br />
The Prime Minister has said that the<br />
Commonwealth is spending fifteen times as<br />
much on universities as it did ten years ago.<br />
It is not, however, spending fifteen times as<br />
much on secondary schools or on primary<br />
schools. Certainly the amount spent on<br />
universities has increased, and if the Commonwealth<br />
record in respect of primary<br />
schools and secondary schools was as good<br />
as it is in regard to universities, we would<br />
have much less cause to criticize.<br />
Mr. Reynolds.-The problem is not<br />
solved as to universities, either.<br />
