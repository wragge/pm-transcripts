TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA<br />
27 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you Ken ( Randall), members of the Press Club, Ladies<br />
and Gentlemen. Well, Ken it is always a pleasure to be back<br />
and when you are back here, you have generally been invited<br />
because yout have got something to say. And on this<br />
occasion, I hope I will not disappoint you.<br />
Last night on behalf of the Government I offered a plan for<br />
Australia, a 4 year plan. A plan for recovery, a plan for<br />
growth, a plan that will create 800,000 jobs over the next 4<br />
years. A plan that will make us stronger, more productive,<br />
a better economy, a plan that will provide a partnership for<br />
government and business, a plan where the unions have a<br />
place in the scheme of national affairs. And this morning,<br />
that plan was met with reactions from various sectors of the<br />
community, some of which I would like to just read to you if<br />
you haven't seen the reactions, and one which I think are<br />
generally approving.<br />
From the Managing Director of BHP, the largest industrial<br />
company, has ' welcomed the initiatives to facilitate a<br />
restoration of growth and employment in the Australian<br />
economy and to regenerate our industrial base. He said, the<br />
improvement that depreciation regime and the introduction of<br />
a development allowance would encourage investment in<br />
productive -capacity and efficiency. We need both the<br />
recovery and sustainable future growth. He said, these are<br />
much needed changes. The efforts to lift capital investment<br />
in Australia will benefit the whole economy, including major<br />
industrial companies, such as BHP. He said, BHP believed an<br />
issues upgrade and modernise Australia's infrastructure, in<br />
particular, rail, road and port networks, will contribute to<br />
the nation's efforts to become more internationally<br />
competitive. We also applaud the encouragement of<br />
participation by the private sector in new infrastructure<br />
investment projects'. And he went on to say some r1ather<br />
general supportive things. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Bank said, ' in an overall sense, this is a<br />
clever document, this is something, there is something in it<br />
for everyone. Yet with the cost of the Budget, that is<br />
within expectations and therefore unlikely to create shockwaves<br />
in financial markets. In the real world, it should<br />
also have a mildly favourable impact on business and<br />
household confidence. From the perspective of a restrained<br />
fiscal shat in the arm, with favourable medium term and<br />
effects irL building the economy's capital base, the<br />
Statement therefore rates well.'<br />
The National Rail Corporation Chairman, welcomed the<br />
Statement and said ' it is an opportunity to upgrade the<br />
national network and to finally complete the standardisation<br />
of the inter-capital city rail links and port connections<br />
will be a great boost, to firstly, the community, rail<br />
clients and rail employees. He said, for the first time in<br />
Australia's history, we are seeing the opportunity for<br />
balanced development in national rail and road networks.'<br />
ACOSS said, ' the one-off boost to family allowance is a well<br />
targeted way of stimulating economic activity whi'le also<br />
relieving significant financial stress. The ongoing<br />
increases in assistance to low income families, will be<br />
welcomed by many struggling families. The removal of most<br />
of the remaining waiting period for rent assistance is also<br />
an important reform.<br />
The Housing Industry Association said, ' the Economic<br />
Statement -targets confidence. A commitment to sustain low<br />
inflation : Ls welcome. Additional spending, thankfully, is<br />
more modest: than earlier speculation suggested, might be the<br />
case, and r-uns off quickly by the time private business<br />
investment, hopefully, will be responding to new incentives<br />
and improved investment. Additional of funding for training<br />
and retraining programs will be valued to the long-term<br />
unemployed. The Motor Traders Association. There are significant<br />
welcome initiatives. The measures for reform depreciation<br />
will be welcome, the capital gains tax exemption, the<br />
firming of company tax for small business by up to 9 weeks<br />
and including the taxation measures'. And of course, part<br />
of that reference would have to be to the change of sales<br />
tax on motcr vehicles.<br />
But all of that, can I say, was not good enough for the<br />
Leader of the Opposition. He said, ' it was one of the most<br />
irresponsible packages that I've seen contemplated in<br />
Australia'. The fact is, when you look at our opponents,<br />
when I listen to their reactions to the Statements., I think,<br />
they haven't changed, they never change. What has to be<br />
understood about the ' One Nation' statement is this, it<br />
addressed thie future as Labor always does, and the<br />
conservatives never do. It's a statement of Government<br />
engagement and not Government withdrawal as his policy is.<br />
It is a statement of inclusion, not exclusion. It's a<br />
statement about making this country strong and self-</p>
<p>respecting. In other words, it is a statement in the<br />
traditions of Labor. It is nation building, governmentally<br />
active, socially inclusive, it's about a greater degree of<br />
social and economic cohesion. It's about giving greater<br />
meaning to the idea of Australia. All these things are the<br />
traditions of Labor. The idiom has changed. It is a modern<br />
economic idiom, but as fits the tradition, it is we as<br />
always who are doing it.<br />
When I look at the others, I am amazed at how familiar the<br />
pattern is. They want to fight an accountancy solution.<br />
They want -to leave the draw bridge up. Don't include the<br />
unions, don't include business, just gallop around the<br />
country every now and then, and collect the tax on the food<br />
they eat and the clothes they wear.<br />
Don't kick--start the place with a payment to families.<br />
Don't build rail highways. Don't do the macro things, or<br />
the micro things. They think we shouldn't do anything about<br />
the recessiLon. The fact is, there is a great philosophical<br />
gap. We can close a lot of the gaps in this country, but<br />
I'm sure we can't close the gap between us and them.<br />
Dr Hewson says, this is one of the most irresponsible<br />
packages he has seen. He said he's disappointed by it. But<br />
the question I have to ask is, where is it irresponsible?<br />
And why is he disappointed? Does Dr H-ewson think we should<br />
not build a national freight highway from Brisbane to Perth?<br />
That we should not rebuild our national road highways? That<br />
we should riot create a national electricity grid, and<br />
introduce competition to that system? That we should not<br />
improve our ports or waste treatment centres or schools?<br />
Does he think we should not transform technical education in<br />
this country? ' That we shouldn't put it on a equal footing<br />
with universities and colleges? Does he think that it's<br />
irresponsible and disappointing to do those things? Does he<br />
think we should not offer a better depreciation schedule to<br />
business? That we should not help business with long-term<br />
investment? Is he disappointed that we have a tax cut on<br />
cars? Does he want that to stop too? Is he disappointed by<br />
the equity funds for small business, by the new bonds to<br />
help private business build electricity grids? This man is<br />
very hard t~ o please, but I might say, easy to disappoint.<br />
Does he think we should not help farmers and families and<br />
particularly, one-off payment to families, to help their<br />
spending? Will he try to stop that in Parliament, when we<br />
introduces the Bills, or the Bills giving help to crop<br />
growers and wool growers? What does unfunded mean? Does it<br />
mean we should hold on to fiscal drag? And if it does mean<br />
that, is it the same fiscal drag which is funding his<br />
proposed tax cuts? Is it unfunded for us but funded for<br />
him, on the same things?<br />
The fact is, Mr Chairman, Dr Hewson has reacted to this as<br />
he has reacted to most things. But basically, the<br />
conservatives are always as they have always been-the<br />
conservatives. They just simply are not about the kind of </p>
<p>changes which Australia needs. They are not about the kind<br />
of vista and program which Labor has provided.<br />
We had John Howard talking this week, and Dr Hewson, who<br />
said, I did not learn respect at school. And John Howard<br />
said, I was disgraceful, and that the ' 50s was a good period<br />
and a ' golden age'. These are remarkable statements coming<br />
from people who fancy themselves as a Government for<br />
Australia in the ' 90s. Nothing could better illustrate the<br />
difference between us and between them. About John Howard's<br />
' golden age'. The ' golden age', for instance, when GDP per<br />
head was half in the ' 50s what it is today. When 85 per<br />
cent of our exports where commodities, instead of 68 per<br />
cent today. When telephones where only available to half<br />
the community. When there were only half the number of cars<br />
available to Australians. When pensions where half of what<br />
they are in real terms today. When only 10 students per<br />
thousand, and not 30 went on to university. This is their<br />
' golden age'. But as we know, it is the age when the<br />
Liberals put the country into neutral. When many<br />
Australians didn't get a look in. When women didn't get a<br />
look in. When migrants were factory fighters with no voice.<br />
When AborigiLnes were excluded from the system. When the<br />
Liberals were zenaphobic and provincial. This was their<br />
' golden age'. The year of the awful cultural cringe, which<br />
stifled our spirit and ate away at our self confidence.<br />
This is the ' golden age'. And I mentioned on AM this<br />
morning about the Old Parliament House becoming a<br />
constitutional museum or a museum of Australian artefacts,<br />
and household utilities, a sort of Smithsonian, and I<br />
suppose we could set up John Howard and John Hewson down<br />
there as the exhibits, with the Astor TV set, and the<br />
radiogram, and the Morphy Richards toaster, and the Qualcast<br />
mower. And the kids could come and look at them and say,<br />
' Gee Mum, is that what it was like then?' And John and John<br />
can say, ' no kids, this is the future, this is the future'.<br />
John Hewson said I didn't have any self respect when the<br />
Queen was here, I didn't have respect for the Queen. But I<br />
said to him the other day, and I will say it again but I<br />
have self respect, and self respect for Australia and self<br />
respect for Australia' s interests which are not about<br />
bringing the draw bridges up, about locking Australians out<br />
of the process, about trying to banish unions of not talking<br />
to business, of not getting the partnership together, of not<br />
keeping Australia one nation. He is about breaking it up,<br />
fracturing it, abolishing Unions, not talking to business,<br />
not helping business. There is no depreciation schedule in.<br />
his program. He's got, in fact, an increase in the company<br />
tax rate to 42 per cent. And what have we got, we've got<br />
what we havet always had from the golden ages a sterile<br />
exercise in accountancy. Taxing completely the low and<br />
middle paid, who spend all of their income, so whether you<br />
tax their income, or expenditure is immaterial. All you do<br />
is make the tax burden heavier on them to make it lighter on<br />
people up the scale. No vision, no vista, no rail highways,<br />
no ring roads, no new national road highways, no electricity </p>
<p>grids, no creativity as there is under Labor, no changing of<br />
the airline system as we propose it, no thought for the<br />
hundreds of thousands of kids who can't get technical<br />
training. No,' no, that's irresponsible. But his proposals<br />
which do nothing more than simply flatten and attack the way<br />
of life of every Australian family, well they have great<br />
vision. Well, we'll let the Australian people judge, and I<br />
will be happy to take questions about it all.<br />
ENDS </p>
<p>Questions and Answers<br />
Q: Bruce Juddery, Prime Minister, freelancing courtesy of<br />
the recession we had to have.<br />
PM: You were freelancing before.<br />
BJ: Don't tell Mr Packer, he was paying me at the time.<br />
Prime Minister the Tuesday of the week before you<br />
ascended to your present eminence you spent two hours<br />
in your office with Senator Terry Aulich. The next<br />
morning he went out and held a doorstop, curiously<br />
coincidential with a speech/ talk be given on radio in<br />
Adelaide by Peter Duncan set the hares running by<br />
saying; that we had to settle this leadership business<br />
quick smart. Then he upped the anti and said it before<br />
Christmas. He set the hares running, now he has been.<br />
dumped to number five on the Senate ticket for Tasmania<br />
and even with Federal Executive intervention, it is<br />
unlikely that the Federal Minister will even get up to<br />
number three. What are you going to do for him, is the<br />
double disillusion a useful solution?<br />
PM: Well, the point of this one does escape me Bruce, and I<br />
wouldn't want to say Kerry was too hard on you, but if<br />
he heard you put that question, you know what a TV<br />
junkie: he is, if he saw you put that question, you<br />
certainly would have gone today if not earlier. Now<br />
could I just say, Terry was a late convert, but better<br />
later than never as far as I was concerned. I don't<br />
like what has happened to sitting Senators in Tasmania<br />
and I've made my position clear about that and it's a<br />
matter then for the Federal augurs of the Party as to<br />
whether they believe that is a satisfactory situation.<br />
That will be resolved in due course.<br />
Q: Tom Connor's from the Canberra Times Prime Minister, I<br />
don't care if Kerry Packer is watching or not.<br />
PM: No he sold your thing didn't he?<br />
TC: Yes that's right. I was wondering if I could ask you<br />
about last night's Statement. Was there a possible<br />
alternative to do nothing on this occasion, I mean so<br />
lot of your Minister's have kept telling us that the<br />
economy was on the road to recovery if you did little<br />
last night or just a little bit of fine tuning, would<br />
we not keep more in touch with what's happening in the<br />
real world rather than possibly head for some uncharted<br />
waters with the current account deficit?<br />
PM: Well I don't think so Tom, I don't think so. We have<br />
got in there for demand 5 per cent through 1992-93 from<br />
minus one this year and I think the place did need a </p>
<p>-2<br />
stimulus, it did need a break in this cycle of gloom<br />
that's been around the place, it did need a spur of<br />
confidence and this is a sensible way to do it, to<br />
provide a stimulus while doing two things helping<br />
families, but principally re-building a lot of this<br />
basic infrastructure. Now it is important to Australia<br />
now where a lot of the big macro-economic challenges<br />
have been defeated, and we have been now, for a number<br />
of yeEars moving into the micro-economy. It just does<br />
matter how quickly you can get a container through a<br />
port. Whether you can develop a block train with<br />
containers to go from city to city, it does matter to<br />
Australia. And that's not going to be changed by<br />
taxing someone's food or clothing, I mean it is just<br />
not going to be changed. It's not going to be invested<br />
in by the private sector. It can only be changed by<br />
government, it can only be improved. We've got the<br />
rail system run down over a quarter of a century and we<br />
have an inadequate highway connections in the country<br />
and we've decided to do these things and other<br />
efficiency things like electricity etc which I think<br />
are both productive, long term and fit the bi. ll in<br />
terms of the stimulus.<br />
So as you know there was a lot of mixed reaction today<br />
to all of these various issues, we had a few quotes<br />
here somewhere, I don't know where they are now, but we<br />
had for instance people saying it was entirely<br />
appropriate, I won't go through them all, others saying<br />
not, but by enlarge there was I think an acceptance<br />
around the commentators and the papers that the<br />
stimulus was worthwhile and sensible and that it will<br />
help the economy into recovery and that's what we need,<br />
but doing i. t in a way which adds to the basic<br />
productive strength of the place. So when we believed<br />
in the end of the first quarter of 1991 that the<br />
recovery would come through under its own steam, under<br />
the power of lower interest rates and the automatic<br />
stabilisers and that's fine. But that's not the case<br />
and was not the case later, certainly not the case now<br />
so I think it was a timely package and the size of the<br />
package and the way in which it's spent is, I think,<br />
good for fiscal policy, good for the economy, good for<br />
confidence, good for activity, and most importantly<br />
good for jobs.<br />
Q: Randal Markey from the West Australian Newspaper,<br />
according to the tax scale released in your package<br />
yesterday, people earning up to $ 350 a week seem to<br />
miss out on any tax cut, yet under Dr Hewson' s tax<br />
packagE! people on $ 350 a week will get a tax cut of<br />
$ 14.30 according to the scales. Why should middle and<br />
high irLcome earners gain at the expense of the lower<br />
paid?<br />
PM: Two answers to that question. The first is as<br />
Treasurer I devoted enormous fiscal wealth to -the low<br />
paid. When I become Treasurer that bottom rate above </p>
<p>-3<br />
the ta. K free threshold was 30 per cent, it is now<br />
per cent. So I did all of the tax changing for the low<br />
paid years ago, years ago. The ACTU style of tax cuts<br />
always were about directing money to the low paid. As<br />
well as that in this Statement we've got a substantial<br />
increase for the family allowance supplement which is<br />
$ 250 million a year ongoing on top of what we have<br />
already done, which is now substantial payments to low<br />
income families. The people who I think deserve the<br />
concentration of the tax cuts now are the people<br />
between $ 20,700 and $ 40,000 and we'll cut their rate to<br />
per cent, which is the rate which is in Dr Hewson's<br />
package but without a 15 per cent consumption tax.<br />
Even the people you speak of below $ 20,000, they'll pay<br />
per cent consumption tax. Now down there are all<br />
sorts of tax payers, income splitters etc in terms of<br />
people on full award wages, full-time award wages,<br />
there would be very few now below about $ 20,000, very<br />
few below about $ 20,000.<br />
So the point is having spent 6 or 7 years directing<br />
money " to that under $ 20,000 area. This time we are<br />
going -to direct it to the $ 20-40,000 and we'll do it<br />
without a 15 per cent string attached, without a<br />
consumption tax.<br />
Q: Peter Reece from the West Australian Mr Keating. This<br />
morning your Treasurer said the Government was<br />
considering a youth wage to encourage employers to take<br />
on more youzng unemployed. Isn't this an<br />
acknowledgement that the Government has been wrong on<br />
this issue? What have you got in mind? Have you<br />
discussed it with the ACTU, and further to that why did<br />
you pass up the opportunity to reverse the Coronation<br />
Hill decision last night?<br />
PM: Well I don't think it's an opportunity at all. It's a<br />
small raine that had a lot of national publicity because<br />
it suited a lot of people on both sides of the argument<br />
to give it to it. But in terms of the mineral<br />
industr-y, in terms of it's volumes it was<br />
insignificant, it's in the catchment area of the East<br />
Alligat~ or Rivers region of the Kakadu National Park,<br />
that was its principle problem, and also the<br />
development was of difference with the opinions of the<br />
Aboriginal people in the area. Now the Government went<br />
through a very long debate about this, decided against<br />
it and as far as I am concerned that's that. There is<br />
no major mining project being held up and this hides<br />
the sort of self flagellation that some people in the<br />
mining industry are giving themselves is not bourne out<br />
by the fact that Marandoo, for instance, is a huge, a<br />
huge deposit. Coronation Hill is a thimble full of<br />
mineral. s compared to Marandoo, is going ahead, is going<br />
ahead. So I am not just going to be part and parcel of<br />
this debate about Coronation Hill. There are bigger<br />
and bet~ ter things to get on to and to get onto them<br />
quickly. </p>
<p>4-<br />
Now the training wage is an issue which has been around<br />
a long time. We've had conversations with the ACTU<br />
about it, I believe we are still having conversations<br />
about. But again we've got in this package a lot of<br />
suppor7t for, if you like, young workers particularly<br />
through the labour market programs, we have got $ 44,000<br />
going in there under Jobstart and under Jobskills<br />
another $ 45 million over the next two years. These<br />
will be important influences, I think, in the labour<br />
market but the training wage question is a longer term<br />
issue and something which we have got to look about, I<br />
think, in a longer term context.<br />
Q: Brad Crouch, Sunday Telegraph. Prime Minister you<br />
outlined some of the warm reactions from your Statement<br />
from some of the large organisations at the start of<br />
your speech, a lot of the benefits from it will take<br />
time t~ o flow through. In light of that do you concede<br />
that there might be a large body of people out there<br />
who maty simply say we've heard these big promises<br />
before! we have heard the rhetoric and you still steered<br />
us into a recession so why should we believe you this<br />
time?<br />
PM: Well the whole world has been steered into a recession.<br />
The United States is in a much deeper recession than<br />
Australia., Britain is in a deeper recession than<br />
Australia, the world went on the most enormous spending<br />
spree in the ' 80s and when the spending stopped, when<br />
the music stopped and the party finished, did everyone<br />
really think that property prices, stock prices,<br />
activity, employment would stay where it is? We did<br />
our best to fine tune that decline. We wanted a slow<br />
down, it turned, unfortunately, into a recession. But<br />
what did the Government do? Was it the Government<br />
priming the economy in the ' 80s. No. We had<br />
surpluses, we were pulling the public sector back. We<br />
actually handed the private sector $ 30 billion a year.<br />
It was not the Government that kicked all the activity<br />
along by running big budget deficits. We're the people<br />
that actually pulled the budget deficits back into<br />
surpluses. The fact is the globalisation of markets<br />
produced an explosive mixture world wide and this was<br />
just as true of Australia as the terms of trade pickedi<br />
up in 1988-89 and we did our best to knock the top off<br />
it, to get' back to where we could afford spending<br />
within our savings and that has unfortunately lead to a<br />
recession.' But again, you say why should we be<br />
believed? Were we entitled to be believed when we said<br />
in 198: 3 we created half a million jobs but in fact<br />
created 1.8 million? Were we entitled to be believed<br />
when on all of those 15 other occasions I've stood up<br />
with these Statements and delivered everyone of them t~ o<br />
the letter, in Bills for Acts of Parliament, or<br />
Appropriations, this is not a sham? These are a set of<br />
proposals which will be acted upon, payments will be<br />
made for projects to the States and you'll have these </p>
<p>kind of consequences from it. It will pull Australia,<br />
I beliLeve, out of this recession and into a recovery.<br />
That's the important thing, getting on with it. But<br />
the fact of the matter is, just remember this, that in<br />
1983 ' the total size of our economy was $ 170 billion,<br />
it's now $ 400 billion, it's doubled in nominal terms<br />
and in real terms has risen by about 25 to 30 per cent.<br />
Now that's what Labor gave Australia in the ' 80s and<br />
five times as much employment growth even to this date,<br />
even t: 0 this day including the recession and the<br />
unemp: loyment, five times as much employment as there<br />
was in the 7 years of John Howard and his adviser John<br />
Hewson, including their recession 1982-83. Looking at<br />
their 7 years and our 7 or 8 years, five times as much<br />
employment. So why shouldn't we be believed? We tried<br />
to produce a slow down not a recession, that wasn't<br />
possible so what do you say, forget the previous 8<br />
years, well come off it!<br />
Q: Tim Dodd, Financial Review, Prime Minister. Last night<br />
you outlined a four year plan to return the Budget to a<br />
surplus but it crucially depends on you achieving<br />
strong growth over these years and the magical<br />
combination of low inflation and a stable current<br />
account. Last time, in 1988, you told us that you<br />
brought home the bacon and your forecasts were blown<br />
out of the water by a swing in the terms of trade, how<br />
sure can you be that another shock of that nature is<br />
not going to upset your forecasts and if the shock<br />
occurs where will it leave your plan to bring the<br />
Budget: into surplus?<br />
PM: Well the terms of trade are always unpredictable, let's<br />
make that clear and after the presentation of the 1988<br />
Budget: when I stood here, the Financial Review of that<br />
day said Governments factored in a 9 per cent rise in<br />
the terms of trade, this is terribly optimistic and is<br />
unlikely to happen. It turned out it was 16 per cent<br />
rise Zand gave the economy a huge boon. So the leader<br />
writers and the journalists of the Financial Review in.<br />
those days were not more perspicacious about the terms<br />
of trade than of course anyone else was. But be that<br />
as it may, the point is still worth making that the<br />
terms of trade are unpredictable, but what we've got in<br />
here is 4 3/ 4 for GDP for 1992-93, 4 1/ 2 for 1993-94,<br />
4 1/ 4 for 1994-95 and 3 3/ 4 for 1995-96. Now frankly,<br />
if you. can't do 4 per cent in this country, if our<br />
thinking is oh that is a high rate of growth, if we<br />
can't do 4 per cent, we ought to pack it in the lot of<br />
us. We ought to pack it in. What sort of country do<br />
we want to live in? You'd need about 3 per cent growth<br />
a year, just to take the school leavers up. So let's<br />
say we say oh look 4 per cent is too ambitious, we'll<br />
go back to 2 3/ 4, that means that we won't even take<br />
the new entrants to the workforce so we'd have a<br />
continuing rise in unemployment. I mean that is not a<br />
possibility for Australia. All the countries near us </p>
<p>-6<br />
are gr7owing at 6 and 8 per cent, 6 to 8, and their<br />
economiy is not spilling into imports. In other words 6<br />
to 8 per cent they can afford and we've got in here 4s<br />
basically and we've got the sort of debate oh that's<br />
too fast. I mean frankly if we can't do 4 we ought to<br />
give i~ t up, the lot of us, the commentators, the<br />
politicians, the public service, the lot and say let's<br />
get a whole new bunch to try and run the place at a<br />
decent: speed. So I don't regard 4 per cent as being<br />
outrageous.<br />
Q: Alan Thornhill, A P Dow Jones News Services Prime<br />
Minister, Australia has never had the great<br />
polytechnics such as Britain and the continental<br />
European countries have had, do you see Australia's<br />
TAFE colleges taking that application and at last in<br />
Australia registering inventions being applied in this<br />
country?<br />
PM: I shouild hope that the development of TAFE with the<br />
funding of the National Government can develop a system<br />
as sophisticated and as strong as we have in higher<br />
education. That must be our objective. Now in higher<br />
education since the middle ' 80s we have created the<br />
equivalent of 12 universities, about 120,000 extra<br />
places: in higher education to take the kids coming out<br />
of tha~ t very high participation, retention rate now in<br />
secondary school. But, of course, the great gap is in<br />
vocational education, technical education and training,<br />
and it. is that offer which we have made to the States<br />
to turn TAFE into a properly funded sophisticated<br />
systemi of vocational education and it may well be,<br />
Alan, that the polytechnic type development is<br />
something which the Australian TAFE system in the<br />
future emulates. But again can I make the point it's<br />
Labor making another vital change in our society,<br />
giving our children a change to train themselves for<br />
practical work and useful jobs. And I contrasted again<br />
with the sterility of the Coalition, where you will see<br />
Dr Hewson and his economics spokesman saying they ought<br />
to have private places, let their parents pay for them.<br />
If they want to go to university let them pay full fees<br />
and what are full fees for a course of substance?<br />
$ 12,00? $ 15,000? What does a private university wish<br />
to charge?, And what have you got to earn pre-tax to<br />
pay $ 12 or $ 15,000 for your child in university<br />
$ 30,000 a year, $ 25,000 a year? So how does a two<br />
income family earning $ 40-$ 50,000, $ 40,000-$ 45,000 go<br />
when $ 30,000 of their gross income goes to keep one<br />
child in university? That's the incentive and freedom<br />
to achieve Hewson style. That's the nasty, vicious<br />
sting of the Hewson rhetoric and ideology. Where were<br />
saying we'll fund these places in tertiary education,<br />
when you get a job pay us back part of the fees, part<br />
of the fees, but what we're saying with no strings<br />
attached we'll fund TAFE into a decent system. Dr<br />
Hewson says it's irresponsible. Well I'll leave you to<br />
judge about the irresponsibility of it. </p>
<p>7<br />
Q: Martin Hirst, SBS Television, Prime Minister. You'eve<br />
invited a comparison between your One Nation package<br />
and the Fightback package released by Dr Hewson late<br />
last year, one area where a comparison, I think, needs<br />
to be made in talking about infrastructure is with<br />
immigration because there is a debate at the moment<br />
about, for example, Sydney and Melbourne the<br />
infrastructure cannot cope with any more migrants into<br />
those communities. Dr Hewson's package claims to have<br />
what he describes as a sensible immigration policy,<br />
they're talking about a cut of between 50 and 70,000.<br />
You have not really made any comment about this in your<br />
package, can you just today make some comments about<br />
that?<br />
PM: It was not something I thought a recovery package was<br />
about. I made it clear that in the normal annual<br />
reviews of this program, which occur each year after<br />
the consultation process with the various States, the<br />
institutions, business etc, that we will debate the<br />
matter and produce a program, composition again, this<br />
year as usual in April and that's, I think, the<br />
appropriate way to do it and the appropriate -time to do<br />
it. The real issue is that migration has made<br />
Australia bigger and stronger than it would have evexr<br />
otherwise been, but the program has varied from over<br />
time. Both Governments have varied the intake from<br />
time to time. It peaked when we needed skills and<br />
demand at about 140,000, about two years ago. That's<br />
now down to 111,000, and it will probably go lower.<br />
But if you take Dr Hewson s 50,000 number it would<br />
simply mean that there would either be no family<br />
reunion or no skills in demand or no business<br />
migration, it will be one or the other. And what he<br />
has never faced up to is the compositional consequences<br />
of those kinds of utterances. So you might have heard<br />
a ball park figure from him and you didn't hear it in<br />
his policy statement, you heard it about a week ago,<br />
rattled of f on a radio station, vague, vague and no<br />
compositional details. Well that's not what we are<br />
about, we are about a proper review and we'll do it in<br />
time, but it has been the case that the program has<br />
come back and will probably come back further.<br />
Q: Don Woolford from Australian Associated Press, Mr<br />
Keating. You have said a lot about the need to make<br />
our transport system more efficient. When will the<br />
Government be doing something about cabotage,<br />
particularly on the trans-Tasman group which is causing<br />
difficulties with our New Zealand friends?<br />
PM: Look, we are the ones who have had to crack all of the.<br />
difficult ones in the micro economy. By about<br />
Christmas this year there will be a 50 per cent<br />
reductiLon in water front employment within about two<br />
years, the last eighteen months to two years we've seen<br />
a 50 per cent reduction in waterfront employment. </p>
<p>8-<br />
Australian ships now have below OECD level crew manning<br />
about them, crew sizes. So a lot of that is behind us,<br />
in adopting that shipping package we have free entry<br />
onto the coast for new trades and even for other tied<br />
trades onto the coast, foreign ships have been brought<br />
onto the coast and are now going around the coast in<br />
various trades. So there has been a substantial change<br />
and single voyage permits have been issued frequently<br />
now for various trades. Again, can I say waterfront,<br />
shipping, aviation, road, rail, electricity, I mean<br />
who's in there breaking the barriers down? And who for<br />
years was confident with this creaky structure? The<br />
boys from the golden age of the ' 50s. It was always as<br />
it was in Ming's day, no company hiring on the water<br />
front, big pools of labour, very high manning levels,<br />
companies and unions getting together to rip off<br />
shippers, very high crew manning levels on ships, no<br />
conversation from the Coalition Government, you never<br />
heard John Howard talking about it. Don't remember<br />
John Hewson advising him to do something about it,<br />
don't remember even talking about the rail system,<br />
about the fact that we couldn't even shift a container<br />
between cities without changing gauges and bogies at<br />
various places along the way, don't remember any<br />
conversation about that before I sent the Industry<br />
Commission a reference on electricity generation and it<br />
came down with its recommendations. I didn't hear<br />
anything from the Coalition about electricity grids. I<br />
mean tiale fact of the matter is these people have no<br />
imagination, no imagination and when it's all said<br />
what's the best they can come up with well they'll<br />
tax the food you put in your mouth and the clothes you<br />
put on your back. That is about the long and short of<br />
them and that's what they call real reform as Dr Hewson<br />
Australia, real reform for Australia, real reform for<br />
Australia. Well I don't call it real reform for<br />
Austra. lia I call it simply praying on people who can't<br />
protect themselves from the ravages of a sort of<br />
Thatcherite ideology of survival of the fittest. if<br />
you're not a millionaire you're a loafer, if you're not<br />
a millionaire you're a loafer, and freedom to achieve<br />
means freedom to send your kids to a university<br />
providiLng you can pay the bill, freedom to achieve, to<br />
look afEter yourself means you can have private health<br />
cover and if you're low paid or you've got a large<br />
family or you're sick too bad for you. I mean this is<br />
what this is about, it's the same stuff the other day<br />
we should have been polishing the British boot straps<br />
up, tugging the forelock, I mean this is them, they<br />
have always been the same, Menzies put the country to<br />
sleep for 15 years. For 15 years we had this cultural<br />
cringe that we never had an identity, I mean all this<br />
talk of Australia returns to Britain as an infant,<br />
growing up and now wants to be included in the<br />
fellowship of European countries, I mean the craven<br />
cultural cringes of it all and we have still got it<br />
with these relics, these ideological relics like Dr<br />
Hewson and Mr Howard. </p>
<p>9-<br />
Q: Laura Tingle from The Australian Mr Keating, you've<br />
clearl. y drawn a distinction last night between yourself<br />
and the Coalition in terms of the role of government in<br />
Australia in the next few years, but I'd just like to<br />
ask if you could define that a bit more clearly for us<br />
in ter7ms Of government policy. First of all what is<br />
the limit on fiscal expansion as far as Labor is<br />
concerned? What are the factors which limit how far<br />
you can go? Will you rule out any further expansion in<br />
fiscal. policy for either economic reasons or to make<br />
reforms to other parts of the tax system or for the<br />
socia. welfare system in the Budget or in the lead up<br />
to thet election? And third could you just clarify for<br />
us your anti-inflation strategy because the Coalition<br />
is nowr making this a major election issue and your<br />
basing yours on a somewhat still undefined new<br />
relationship with the trade union movement?<br />
PM: Laura come off it. Ours undefined? At 1.5 per cent,<br />
an inflation rate second lowest in the world undefined?<br />
Undefined with an Accord process which has taken<br />
Australia's inflation down from the 10 per cent they<br />
left us with after the last recession and all through<br />
the ' 7' Os, through the early ' 80s and after a big<br />
depreciation of the exchange rate in the middle<br />
we've got it down from 10 per cent to 1.5 with a<br />
combintation of tax cuts through the Accord and monetary<br />
policy and they are by their own admission about to<br />
double it with a consumption tax and we're the ones<br />
with an ill-defined inflation policy. I mean their's<br />
is very highly defined, they are going to double it.<br />
They'll take inflation from an underlying rate of at<br />
least 3 per cent to at least well over 6 or 7 per cent<br />
and as Dr Murphy the econometrician that Dr Hewson<br />
bragged about on the day he launched his Fightback<br />
proposal had to say the other day, if any of it goes<br />
into wages, that is if the price effect of the GST, the<br />
per cent on bread and milk and food and clothing and<br />
dry cleaning and everything else goes into wages, then<br />
inflation rates are likely to go back to 10 per cent.<br />
And what can they do about it? Other than draconian<br />
interest rates which will simply slow the place down<br />
and produce a continuing recession. I mean they don't<br />
have any discussion with the unions, I met 40 people<br />
from the Wages Committee of the ACTU last week, they<br />
gave a commitment to the Government that their target<br />
will be with the Government's, keeping an inflation<br />
rate around the average of our trading partners and<br />
making their claims accordingly and their activity in<br />
the labour market accordingly. What commitment could<br />
Dr Hewson secure from the unions? He wants to destroy<br />
the unions,. He said he wants to wipe them out, he said<br />
there will not even be a national wage case, I mean<br />
they have no anti-inflation policy other than to get<br />
the Governor of the Reserve Bank to jack interest rates<br />
back up to very high levels to try to squash activity<br />
to cut inflation. That's their sole policy. But fancy </p>
<p>10<br />
breakiLng the back of Australian inflation after two<br />
decades and getting it at a statistical rate of 1.5 per<br />
cent and then let someone let it out of the bag again,<br />
let it out again by willfully adding substantially to<br />
prices and to inflation, that's what Fightback is<br />
about. It's a vast macro-economic risk, but it's more<br />
than a risk it will be a disaster because they have got<br />
no possibility of keeping it out of wages, none. Why<br />
would a wage and salary earner who's been dudded under<br />
their tax cuts say oh yes I'll give you a wage<br />
discount. Why? Of course they won't. They're not<br />
going to cop a bar of it, if there was a GST it would.<br />
go straight into wages, bang, in a decentralised<br />
bargaining system, bang, straight into wages. And what<br />
would Dr Hewson do about it? Put a press statement out<br />
in the press boxes, attack the ACTU on the steps of<br />
Parliament House, have Peter Reith do a doorstop? I<br />
mean compare that to the proven success of Labor in<br />
getting inflation down and by using the mechanism of<br />
bringing business, unions and government together as I<br />
say acrain, ' One Nation', to get over a major impediment<br />
inflation, which we have done and which they could<br />
never hope to do.<br />
Q: Glenn Milne from the Australian Mr Keating, if I could<br />
continue on the inflation and wages theme, you've<br />
secured agreement from the unions to keep inflation in<br />
line with our major trading partners, could you give us<br />
an indication on what the upper limit of that rate<br />
would be and what would be the sort of broad across the<br />
board wage increase that would underpin that number?<br />
And taking the wages and taxation question a . little<br />
further, does this mean the statement last night, that<br />
you've got no room left to move on personal tax reform<br />
in the August Budget or is there still some scope for<br />
that?<br />
PM: The Government is governing, is going to have a Budget<br />
in August. It always has policy prerogatives available<br />
to it, I mean we have never seen Australia's change in<br />
the post war years and the possibilities of reform has<br />
been all tied up in one statement and while this<br />
statement ' One Nation' is about taking Australia back<br />
into recovery with reform it will not be the end of<br />
reform under this Government, we will do other things<br />
and we will do them as needs be and as opportunities<br />
arise. Now you are asking about wages this year,<br />
average weekly earnings are running about 3.5 per cent<br />
and depending on what productivity is and can be, and I<br />
think we have got a great opportunity for high<br />
productivity growth in the 1990s. It's entirely<br />
possible that you will see sectors of the workforce<br />
getting wage increases with quite low inflation rates,<br />
with quite low cost consequences because of that<br />
productivity, so the yard stick will be not aggregate<br />
wages but trading partner inflation rates, and as you<br />
know that will be the competitive inflation rates of<br />
the developed low inflation OECD countries. </p>
