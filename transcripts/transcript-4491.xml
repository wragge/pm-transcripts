MR CARMODY<br />
F77/ 200( Q<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 13 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION HAYLEN<br />
Mr. Speaker, I move: " That this House expresses its regret at the<br />
death on 12 September 1977 of Leslie Clement Haylen, a Member of<br />
this House for the Division of Parkes from 1943 unt il 1963, places<br />
on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service and<br />
tenders its deep sympathy to his family in their bereavement."<br />
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Leslie Haylen was a Member of this House from<br />
1943 to 1963. He represented the Sydney suburban electorate of<br />
Parkes for twenty years in a most memorable manner. During the<br />
first world war, he served overseas with the Australian Infantry<br />
Forces until Ife was dischiarged in 1919.<br />
From the time he was elected to the Parliament in 1943 he served on<br />
numerous-Parliamentary Committees ranging from Social Security to<br />
the broadcasting of Parliamentary procedures. He also represented<br />
Australia overseas as a member of the Australian delegation to the<br />
27th Session of the International Labour Organisation in Paris in<br />
1946, as Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Committee<br />
which visited Europe in 1945, and as Leader of the Parliamentary<br />
Delegation to Japan in 1948.<br />
Les Haylen was an author as well as a Member of this House. He had<br />
published numerous works ranging from plays and short stories to<br />
novels and historical works.<br />
His term in Parliament first on the Government benches and later<br />
on the Opposition front benches was characterised by his sincerity<br />
and vigour, and he will be remembered by his former colleagues for<br />
his conscientious and devoted service to the ideals and interests<br />
of his party and of his country.<br />
I am sure I speak for all of us when I say to his widow and his<br />
two sons that we offer them our sympathy in their loss. </p>
