FOR MEDIA 4 DECEMBER 1989<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHIEF<br />
MINISTER OF THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY<br />
We announce today our signing of an agreement<br />
guaranteeing Commonwealth funding for the Australian<br />
Capital Territory's public hospital system for the next<br />
four years.<br />
Signature of the Agreement brings the ACT into line with<br />
the States and the Northern Territory in regard to public<br />
hospital funding arrangements and reflects its<br />
independent status after self-government.<br />
The Commonwealth grant will be indexed not only to take<br />
account of general cost increases but also to reflect<br />
ageing and growth of the ACT's population.<br />
Older people are major users of hospital services and the<br />
funding arrangements will ensure the grant keeps pace<br />
with the general ageing of the population.<br />
This formula will give public hospitals $ 8 million in<br />
extra Federal funds over the four year period. The<br />
Commonwealth grant constitutes a significant proportion<br />
of the annual budget.<br />
Under the new Medicare hospital agreement the ACT will<br />
receive almost $ 43 million in 1989-90, an increase of 23%<br />
on former funding arrangements.<br />
The Chief Minister has indicated that the incentive money<br />
will enable the ACT to develop and expand innovative<br />
approaches to reduce the need for overnight admission to<br />
hospital or to facilitate early discharge by providing*<br />
enhanced services in the fields of post-acute and<br />
palliative care and day surgery.<br />
The new agreement provides further proof of Labor's<br />
continuing commitment to the principles of Medicare, and<br />
specifically reinforces the right of public patients to<br />
free access to hospital services according to medical<br />
need. Both of our Governments are committed to ensuring that<br />
Medicare patients continue to receive comprehensive, high<br />
quality care. In addition to the funding provided by the<br />
ACT Government, the Commonwealth grant will enable the<br />
ACT to maintain the fine record of its public hospitals. </p>
