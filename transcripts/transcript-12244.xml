    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit Japan from 2 to 3 August 2001 to engage senior Japanese leaders on key economic, regional and global issues of importance to Australia and Japan.</p>
<p>The focus of my visit to Tokyo will be meetings with Japan's Prime Minister Mr Junichiro Koizumi and key ministers of his administration. I also plan to meet a range of Japanese parliamentarians as well as industry leaders and other prominent Japanese figures associated with Australia.</p>
<p>Japan is Australia's largest trading partner. Its economic importance to Australia is immense. Total trade was worth over $42 billion last year. Japanese companies are major investors in Australia and employ directly 50,000 Australians.</p>
<p>The relationship between Australian and Japan is close and long-standing. The Australia-Japan Conference, which I addressed in April, examined ways of taking the substantial relationship between our two countries into the 21st century. I look forward to discussing with Mr Koizumi these ideas for building closer ties between our two countries.</p>
<p>I shall also discuss with Mr Koizumi global and regional developments on which Japan and Australia work closely, including the climate change negotiations and regional economic developments. Both countries have a close interest in developments in Indonesia, and I will encourage Mr Koizumi to continue to support Indonesia's transition to a modern, democratic state.</p>
<p>I shall discuss with Mr Koizumi the active measures being taken by Japan and Australia to secure the launch this year of a new round of global trade negotiations.</p>
