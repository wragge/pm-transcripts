CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER FOR PREMIER LI PENG<br />
CANBERRA 17 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
Mr Premier, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to<br />
Australia in this, our Bicentennial year.<br />
We are delighted that, with your first visit overseas as<br />
Premier, you bring to a fitting culmination China's generous<br />
participation in our Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
The People's Republic of China was involved in these<br />
celebrations from the very beginning, with tremendous<br />
fireworks displays in all of the capital cities of Australia<br />
on New Year's Day and with a televised message from<br />
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.<br />
The Chinese Pavilion at Expo, your Government's handsome<br />
gifts to our new Parliament House, visits by a succession of<br />
impressive Chinese cultural groups not to mention the<br />
brief period of residence in Melbourne and Sydney of those<br />
quintessential and enormously popular symbols of China,<br />
Fei-Fei and Xiao-Xiao have not only reminded Australians<br />
of China's great natural and cultural heritage but have<br />
reflected and strengthened the warm friendship between our<br />
two countries and people.<br />
The Chinese community in Australia has likewise left a<br />
positive mark on our Bicentennial celebrations. Indeed<br />
Chinese-Australians have loomed large in Australian history,<br />
as one of the-longest-established ethnic communities in<br />
Australia's multicultural society.<br />
Their contributions to Australia's economic and cultural<br />
development stretch back well into the nineteenth century<br />
though it needs to be added that there have been times when<br />
these contributions have not been recognised and when the<br />
Chinese community in Australia suffered the blight of<br />
racism.<br />
My Government is committed to ensuring that there is no<br />
return to those days, either through racial discrimination<br />
in Australia or by the reintroduction of racial<br />
discrimination in the migration program.<br />
35b26 </p>
<p>The example of the industry and participation of Chinese<br />
Australians in every aspect of life has played a vital role<br />
in promoting in the broader community the values of<br />
tolerance, understanding and acceptance of cultural<br />
diversity. Tonight we will see the Chinese Youth League of Australia<br />
perform a dance drama entitled ' The Dragon Down Under',<br />
which tells the story of the Chinese community in Australia.<br />
Mr Premier, in this Year of the Dragon, a year of good luck,<br />
virtue, wealth and harmony, these young people represent the<br />
future. They are an important part of the human link<br />
between our two countries and cultures a link which fully<br />
complements the outstanding Government-to-Government<br />
cooperation built up since relations between Australia and<br />
China were normalised sixteen years ago at the time of Gough<br />
Whitlam's Labor Government.<br />
Mr Premier,<br />
The future of Australia and of China are inextricably<br />
linked. AS your former Vice-President Ulanhu so rightly put<br />
it earlier this year, we are building a relationship not for<br />
or 20 years, but for generations for our children and<br />
for our children's children.<br />
In building that relationship, both Australia and the<br />
People's Republic of China are, in their different ways,<br />
undergoing profound processes of change.<br />
The far reaching economic reforms introduced in your own<br />
country since 1978 have constituted an enormously powerful<br />
force to reshape conditions within China. They have<br />
produced spectacular growth in the Chinese economy and<br />
rising living Standards.<br />
More than that, however, these reforms constitute a<br />
significant reshaping of the very framework of relationships<br />
throughout the region.<br />
While there may be some modifications, the direction of<br />
reform is irreversible.<br />
Australia has, from the outset, welcomed these policies of<br />
modernisation and opening up to the outside world. We have<br />
done so, not only because of the mutually advantageous<br />
opportunities these policies give us for trade and economic<br />
cooperation but, above all, because they will contribute to<br />
the peaceful and prosperous development of China as well as<br />
of the Asian-Pacific region and beyond.<br />
I have observed personally through my visits to China the<br />
improvements over the last decade in the material well-being<br />
of the Chinese people. The extent to which the policies and<br />
benefits of reform have enhanced China's international<br />
standing and influence are equally dramatic. 3, i27 </p>
<p>3.<br />
These are all matters in which Australia and China share<br />
particular interests in common and on which we are able to<br />
talk to one another with complete candour. In fact, as I<br />
have experienced during my many hours of conversation with<br />
the Chinese leadership, our relationship has moved to that<br />
high ground of maturity on which there is no subject that<br />
cannot be usefully discussed between us. I am pleased to<br />
add, Mr Premier, that our talks today confirmed and<br />
strengthened that mature and very positive relationship<br />
between our two countries.<br />
Mr Premier,<br />
In international and regional affairs we are witnessing<br />
important changes.<br />
One important development that Australia very much welcomes<br />
is the recent improvement in Sino-Soviet relations. The<br />
Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev has launched a<br />
wide-ranging political and economic reform agenda, the<br />
outcomes of which have still to be tested, but which<br />
nevertheless is cause for some optimism. The success of<br />
these reforms is a matter of the closest interest to China,<br />
Australia and other countries of the Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
-Indeed, I believe we can be reassured by the fact that in<br />
the world at large, and in our own Asia/ Pacific region, we<br />
have begun to see the emergence of an international<br />
framework that could hold for us the promise of a less<br />
turbulent, less violent and less daunting future than has<br />
characterised so much of this century.<br />
I have in mind current trends, for example, in relations<br />
between the super-powers, in the role and standing of the<br />
United Nations, in the sphere of disarmament and arms<br />
control, and in relation to Indochina.<br />
There is, too, a growing awareness of the fundamental<br />
futility of protectionism, as a threat to the orderly and<br />
rational expansion of international trade. Countries such<br />
as Australia and China share an interest in working to<br />
persuade those who pursue protectionist policies that if we<br />
do not take direct action'the international community as a<br />
whole will bear the cost of distortions in world commodity<br />
prices. Mr Premier,<br />
The pattern of regional specialisation is shifting in ways<br />
which are bringing about greater economic and political<br />
interdependence between countries. This will, clearly,<br />
influence the nature of our own bilateral relationship. In<br />
particular, the greater emphasis being given by the more<br />
developed regional economies to knowledge intensive<br />
industries is allowing other countries in the region to move<br />
into the export of more labour intensive products.<br />

The economic relationship between Australia and China now<br />
encompasses two way trade amounting annually to more than<br />
two billion Australian dollars, and increasingly substantial<br />
two way investment. There are now more than thirty<br />
Australian ventures working in a dozen provinces in ' China.<br />
China's investments in Australia include the aluminium<br />
smelter at Portland in Victoria and the iron mine at Mount<br />
Channar in western Australia. I was particularly pleased<br />
that you were able to visit Channar on Tuesday as Chinese<br />
involvement in that project originated in a feasibility<br />
study undertaken following my own visit to China in 1984.<br />
Australia is well known for the efficiency and scale of its<br />
farming and the richness of its natural resources.<br />
Many of our best technical innovations and hence many of<br />
our potential exports enhance the abundance of our land or<br />
reduce the difficulties . of life in this vast and sometimes<br />
harsh continent: remote ' area telecommunications, long<br />
distance road and rail transport, computer software, medical<br />
technology, energy and space equipment. I know, Mr Premier,<br />
that you have seen much of this during your stay in<br />
Australia. So while the staples of the trading relationship on the<br />
Australian side are commodities such as wool, iron ore and<br />
wheat, and while those commodities will continue to be very<br />
substantial elements in our trade for years to come,<br />
Australians are keen to diversify our exports.<br />
Trade in services, in particular education, is becoming an<br />
increasingly important element in our relationship, not just<br />
as an economically beneficial development but as a means of<br />
building deeper mutual understanding. It is very gratifying<br />
to see that since I discussed this matter with your<br />
predecessor Zhao Ziyang in may 1986, the number of visas<br />
issued to students from China to study in Australia has<br />
risen dramatically from some 600 in 1985/ 86 to nearly<br />
8,000 in the financial year'just concluded.<br />
For China's part, there is room for exports not only of<br />
textiles, clothing and footwear but also a potential for<br />
machinery and transport equipment.<br />
Mr Premier, the prospects for Chinese-Australian<br />
co-operation to launch the Aussat II satellites on your<br />
" Long March" rockets constitute an important new step in our<br />
relationship. Australia wishes this project to go ahead,<br />
not just for its own sake but as a forerunner of the type of<br />
venture our two countries need to undertake as we enter the<br />
twenty-first century.<br />
many of these elements come together, Mr Premier, in the<br />
Australian Government's decision to assist a new joint<br />
venture that arises, after two and a half years' work, from<br />
the 1986 Australia-China joint working group on iron and<br />
steel. 3529 </p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that Australia has allocated<br />
over the next six years to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Training<br />
Centre a project aimed at assisting China to improve the<br />
productivity of its iron and steel industry by strengthening<br />
its training strategy.<br />
This project will contribute to the growing relationship<br />
between our iron and steel enterprises, will further extend<br />
our close commercial links, and will strengthen the<br />
individual links between our two countries.<br />
Another new initiative, with which the Australian Government<br />
is proudly associated through the Australia-China Council,<br />
is the establishment at Sydney's Macquarie University of a<br />
Centre for Chinese Political Economy. we look forward to<br />
this Centre developing into a centre of excellence in the<br />
study of Chinese trade, finance and economics in the years<br />
ahead. Mr Premier, it is important that the business communities<br />
in both our countries continue to work at developing a high<br />
level of trust and confidence in each other as competent and<br />
reliable partners. At the governmental level Australia and<br />
China seek to promote trust and confidence through the<br />
creation of high level consultative groups such as the Joint<br />
Ministerial Economic Commission and Joint Working Groups<br />
covering a wide range of industries. These links are<br />
complemented in the business area by such bodies as the<br />
China Enterprise Management Association, the Australia/ China<br />
Business Co-operation Committee and the Australia/ China<br />
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<br />
Mr Premier, my Government has an enduring commitment to<br />
Australia's relationship with China. The maintenance and<br />
further development of'that relationship is one of the<br />
central elements in my Government's foreign policy. we see<br />
the relationship as aimed at enriching the lives of our<br />
peoples. That is our long term goal. We seek to achieve it<br />
in close partnership with your Government.<br />
Mr Premier, you are a most welcome and honoured guest. It<br />
is our privilege to have you with us this evening. Your<br />
visit has provided Hazel and me with an opportunity to repay<br />
something of the generous hospitality we have received in<br />
China. Your visit continues the pattern of high level<br />
exchanges and dialogue established in recent years. I hope<br />
that this contact will continue to characterise the friendly<br />
and mutually beneficial relationship which has been<br />
developed between Australia and China.<br />
