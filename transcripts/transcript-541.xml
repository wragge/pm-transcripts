J'QO, fJ iR l -) SS_ ul AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL<br />
Statement by the Chairman ( Rt. Hon. Harold Holt IM. P.)<br />
The Australian Loan Council decided at its meeting<br />
today that the borrowing programme for States' works and<br />
housing for 1962-63 should be œ 250,000,000.<br />
A borrowing programme of œ 106,750,000 was approved for<br />
Commonwealth and State semi-government and local authorities which<br />
borrow more than œ 100,000 during the year.<br />
In addition, the Loan Council decided that no<br />
overall limit should be placed on borrowings by authorities<br />
for which the State Governments approve programmes of not more<br />
than œ 100,000 in 1962-63.<br />
In making these decisions, the Loan Council took into<br />
consideration the Commonwealth offer of a special non-repayable<br />
interest-free grant of œ 12-million to be expended by the States<br />
at their discretion for employment-giving activities.<br />
The allocation of these amounts is as follows:<br />
