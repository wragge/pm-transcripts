    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Today I also introduce the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. This Bill deals with consequential and transitional matters relating to the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and other matters set out in the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013.</p>
<p>This Bill will ensure a smooth transition from the institutions, functions and powers created by the Fair Work Building Industry Act 2012 to the new arrangements established by the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. This Bill also deals with residual operation of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 where necessary.​​</p>
<p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
