* U( A PRESS STATEMENT NO. 589<br />
7 November 1975<br />
THE BUDGET -STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
It's now more than three weeks since the Opposition<br />
in the Senate embarked on its reckless course of blocking the<br />
Budget. It must be quite clear to them by now that their<br />
attempt to subvert the elected Government has failed completely.<br />
Yet wilfully, want~ only, in the face of this knowledge,<br />
with total disregard for the nation's welfare, they persist<br />
in a course which must gravely damage the economy and damage<br />
the national interest a course which will set back by weeks,<br />
by months, the difficult process of economic recovery which<br />
was getting underway.<br />
It is a tragic fact -tragic but true that damage<br />
to the economy has alreadly been done and is already being<br />
felt. Business confidence is already suffering. A grave<br />
blow has alread' been struck to Investment, to stability,<br />
to co~ nsumer spending, and above all to employment. The<br />
Oppos ition's answer to this hardship and confusion is more<br />
political crisis, another election, a campaign which, by<br />
their own invitation, could last six or seven months, with<br />
all the paralysis entailed to normal administration.<br />
I repeat: it is just not on. It is simply no answer.<br />
The-Budget must pass.<br />
I want to make it clear that the Government,<br />
mindful of its duty, is doing everything possible to minimise<br />
hardship and suffering among innocent victims of this crisis.<br />
Public servants, as I have already announced, will be paid in<br />
the normal way on the 13 and 27 November. Thereafter-the<br />
banks the private banks as well as the Commonwealth Bank<br />
and the State Government banks are concerned to ensure that<br />
their custormer, whose incomes are threatened, obtain credit<br />
during this difficult time. The Government welcomes the<br />
statement by the banks that they will do all they can to<br />
provide credit. We shall cooperate with them. That is the<br />
very least we could do for the loyal public servants who are<br />
sticking by their posts. And it is a duty which Mr Fraser<br />
himself acknowledged publicly on Sunday week. He was asked<br />
if the opposition would consider giving public servants<br />
assistance with credit, and he said I quote his words<br />
" We certainly would. I have already said that we would not<br />
want to see any individual, Government employee, hurt or<br />
* damaged as a result of whatis happening." That was his<br />
attitude to the emergency measures perfectly legal and<br />
constitutional measures that we are now taking. personal<br />

<p>* 2 But I have to say this: individuals are<br />
being hurt. The economy is being hurt. Nothing can<br />
flow from further delay to the Budget but disruption<br />
and economic decline. Mr Fraser must end this farce now.<br />
The nation must return to its normal steady course.<br />
The elected Government must be allowed to govern.<br />
