enable them to sow crops.<br />
These loans to farmers in necessitous circumstances as a result<br />
of the drought have been included as a special measure ofassistance<br />
for the duration of the current drought. They<br />
are secured primarily by a preferential crop lien and are<br />
repayable from the proceeds of the crop assisted.<br />
