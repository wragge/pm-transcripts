VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN,<br />
MR RYUTARO HASHIMOTO<br />
I have very great pleasure in announcing that the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr<br />
Ryutaro Hashimoto, will visit Australia on 28-29 April. I look forward to<br />
reciprocating the hospitality Mr Hashimoto extended to me during my visit to<br />
Japan in September last year.<br />
Mr Hashimoto's acceptance of my invitation reflects the importance we both attach<br />
to maintaining the closest possible cooperation between us and our two countries.<br />
Japan is a close friend of Australia's and a highly valued partner in regional and<br />
international affairs. Japan is Australia's most important export market.<br />
It is fitting that Mr Hashimoto should visit Australia in the year that we celebrate<br />
the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Australia-Japan Commerce<br />
Agreement. This agreement opened the way for the development of a remarkable<br />
economic relationship and laid the foundation for the present diverse and warm<br />
relationship between our countries and peoples.<br />
Mr Hashimoto's visit provides a welcome opportunity to discuss how we can best<br />
promote our economic and political partnership and our cooperation in regional<br />
affairs.<br />
Mr Hashimoto will visit Canberra and Sydney. </p>
