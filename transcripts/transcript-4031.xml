F76/ 7 ee, e<br />
PRIME MINISTER January 1976<br />
FOR PRESS ECONOMIC. CONSULTATIVE GROUP<br />
An Economic Consultative Group has been formed to promote<br />
a greater degree of consultation and an improved flow of<br />
information between Government and the private sector.<br />
The Government wishes to operate closely with the private sector<br />
and all Ministers have been asked to review the operations of<br />
existing advising bodies, so as to ensure that the Government<br />
has adequate and appropriate advice available to it.<br />
Within that context it is important that a dialogue be instituted<br />
with leaders from industry and the trade union movement. The<br />
Economic Consultative Group will provide appropriate<br />
machinery for the purpose of economic discussion and would be a<br />
useful supplement to the future tripartit1-e consultative body<br />
to consider industrial relations matters.<br />
Under the Chairmanship of the Treasurer the Economic Consultative<br />
Group will comprise 17 leading business and trade union figures,<br />
selected for their personal capacities as distinct from any<br />
representational roles, and serving without remuneration. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The deputy chairman will be the Minister for Industry and<br />
Commerce, who will be representing the Treasurer in the Senate,<br />
and working closely with him.<br />
The first meeting of the Group will be early in February and<br />
it will meet regularly thereafter.<br />
Senior officials of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank and of<br />
the Department of Industry and Commerce w; ill attend the meetings<br />
and the Group will be serviced, in a secretarial capacity, by<br />
the Treasury.<br />
The formation of the Economic Consultative Group will ensure<br />
that the Government is kept informed about the state of affairs<br />
in the private sector.<br />
A process of economic monitoring of this kind will supplement<br />
the range of official statistical indicators and other economic<br />
data and provide a valuable first-hand source of economic<br />
intelligence and early warning about problems arising from time<br />
to time.<br />
At the same time, the formation of the Group will allow the<br />
Government to present its assessment of economic condition to the<br />
members of the Group and receive their views upon it. / 3 </p>
