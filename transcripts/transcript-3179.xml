AUSTRAILIA AND ASI A : THE CHALLENGE OF EDUCATION<br />
The following is the text of a speech by the<br />
Prime Minister, The Hon. E. G. Whitlam, MV. P., to the<br />
Asian Seminar during the Centenary Celebrations of the<br />
University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Tuesday 5 March, 1974:<br />
" There is something profoundly satisfying, and<br />
essentially contemporary in spirit, in the decision to hold an<br />
Asian Seminar in conjunction with the centenary of this great<br />
University. I can think of no more fitting demonstration of the<br />
reality of your involvement, and Australia's involvement, in the<br />
welfare of the countries of our region.<br />
The origins of this University, like those of this<br />
State, are of course rooted deeply in European culture and, more<br />
particularly, in the customs and traditions of the great English<br />
foundations of scholarship and learning. For that reason, yo-a'<br />
emphasis on Asian education and culture, and Australia's links<br />
with Asia, is striking proof of a modern and progressive interest<br />
in our neighbours. For myself it is especially gratifying that<br />
your seminar reflects two deep personal commitments of my own:<br />
my commitment to education and my commitment to the progress and<br />
development of our region.<br />
During my recent visit to South-East Asia my aim was<br />
to advance Australia's national interests in a region of<br />
continuing and increasing importance to this country. I believe<br />
I succeeded. I believe the confluence of history and geographyour<br />
mainly European origins and our location on the edge of<br />
South-East Asia affords us a unique opportunity to demonstrate<br />
that countries with quite different ethnic, cultural and<br />
religious backgrounds can evolve intimate and lasting relationships.<br />
We have moved closer to Asia; we are involved in Asia </p>
<p>2.<br />
as never before. And we are particularly involved in the<br />
education of Asian people. We provide funds for the expansion<br />
of the teaching of Asian languages and cultures in Australia.<br />
We provide travel grants to enable Australian teachers to visit<br />
Asia. A month ago my colleague the Minister for Education went<br />
to Bangkok to accept, on behalf of Australia, an invitation to<br />
join SEAMEC, the South-East Asian Ministers of Education<br />
Conference. Naturally our interest in the region extends beyond<br />
cultural and educational matters, important as these are. We<br />
give substantial economic aid to Asian development. I have<br />
therefore chosen this occasion to announce that the Australian<br />
Government will contribute $ 18,150,000 to the Asian Development<br />
Fund. As many of you know, the Fund has been established within<br />
the Asian Development Bank, and my colleague the Treasurer, in<br />
his capacity as Governor of the Bank, was among those who<br />
supported the creation of the Development Fund. Historians will<br />
note, I trust, that Australia is one of the first countries to<br />
announce its contribution. The beneficiaries of the Fund will<br />
be the poorer developing member countries of the Asian and Pacific<br />
region. There are many who suggest that the chief emphasis of<br />
Government has been to promote a " new nationalism" in Australia.<br />
It would, I think, be better and more accurate to describe our<br />
policy as a new internationalism.<br />
My principal purpose this morning is to tell you<br />
something of Australia's contribution to Asian education,<br />
particularly through the Colombo Plan.' In this room today there<br />
is living, brilliant evidence of the success of that Plan and 4<br />
of the contribution this university has made to its ideals and<br />
objectives. I note,' among t he other participa nts of your<br />
seminar, the Honourable Datuk Taib, Minister of Primary Industries<br />
in Malaysia, a distinguished member of the South Australian bar<br />
and a graduate of this university. I welcome Mr W. R. Crocker,<br />
Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia, a former Australian<br />
diplomat of great eminence and, again, a graduate of Adelaide<br />
University. I pay tribute to Sir Percy Spender, former<br />
President of the International Court of Justice, who, as a<br />
Minister of the Australian Government, did much to develop and<br />
-encourage the Colombo Plan in its early years. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Indeed,-looking at your list of speakers and chairman<br />
both Asians and Australians I cannot recall a more distinguished<br />
and representative assembly of men whose whole lives and careers<br />
have been devoted to the cultural and educational advancement of<br />
the Asian people. I welcome you all, and wish your seminar the<br />
utmost success. The Australian Government attaches great importance to<br />
its overseas aid activities. We regard the technical assistance and<br />
training elements of that aid as most significant. We are now<br />
establishing a new organisation, the Development Assistance Agency,<br />
to administer all our aid programs, whether bilateral or<br />
multilateral. We want to ensure that an innovative and imaginative<br />
approach is adopted to foreign aid and to see that our aid programs<br />
are quickly and effectively put into action. Our objective is not<br />
only to increase the volume of Australian aid, but to improve the<br />
quality of the assistance we are able to provide; to ensure that<br />
it has a more direct bearing upon improving the quality of life in<br />
developing countries.<br />
Put simply, our aid is oriented to the needs of fellow<br />
human beings. The training and education elements of aid programs<br />
are the most direct means by which we can attain this orientation.<br />
By building upon human skills and knowledge, we help to develop th-a<br />
one essential, self-regenerating resource upon which social and<br />
economic progress ultimately depends. Training and education<br />
programs have properly been in the forefront since our official<br />
overseas aid programs began in' 195l with the commencement of the<br />
Colombo Plan. Australian assistance to education under the Colombo Plan<br />
has been directed over the years into a range of activities designed<br />
to meet various needs of the recipient countries. At present our<br />
assistance covers training in Australian universities, Government<br />
departments, educational institutions and industry; the sending of<br />
experts and advisers to the developing countries to assist in<br />
research, training and development; and the provision of equipment<br />
for educational institutions in the developing countries themselves.<br />
The number of awards financed each year under Australian<br />
Government aid schemes for training and education in Australia has </p>
<p>4.<br />
grown impressively; from 450 in 1955 to 3,345 in 1973. In money<br />
terms, annual expeinditure on education and training under the<br />
Colombo Plan has increased in the last five years from $ 3.7 million<br />
to $ 6.4 million. To this should be added substantial sums for<br />
assisting educational institutions abroad. These figures can be<br />
expected to grow, in keeping with the general growth of our aid<br />
programs.. You will recall that the Government last year accepted<br />
the United Nations target to raise its official development<br />
assistance to 0.7 per cent of GNP by the end of the decade.<br />
Perhaps I should point out that the Colombo Plan techniques<br />
of providing training and technical assistance now extend beyond the<br />
Colombo Plan area being covered by various programs of assistance to<br />
countries in Africa and the South Pacific, including Papau New<br />
Guinea. My-commaents today can be generally taken to include these<br />
other programs.<br />
EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN AUSTRALIA<br />
Overseas students have made up a significant percentage of<br />
full-time enrolments in Australian universities. In 1972 3492<br />
overseas students from Asian, African and Pacific countries were<br />
enrolled at universities. This represented 4.2 per cent of a total<br />
full-time enrolment of 83,600. Australian Government-sponsored<br />
overseas students enrolled at universities totalled 1,383 or 1.7<br />
per cent of the full-time university enrolment.<br />
Each year recipient Governments are invited to nominate<br />
students for training in Australia. Levels and fields of study<br />
are determined by the governments of the recipient country depending<br />
. upon their own varying national needs. The only limitations imposed<br />
by the Australian Government are concerned with the relevance of<br />
the proposed training to the economic development of the nominating<br />
country, the availability of the proposed training in the nominating<br />
country, the adequacy of the qualifications of the nominee to<br />
undertake the proposed training and the capacity of Australian<br />
institutions to provide it. Members of the Colombo Plan have<br />
agreed among themselves that training at technician level and below<br />
should be provided only for highly specialised instruction for which<br />
adequate facilities are unavailable within their own or neighbouring<br />
countries. </p>
<p>.4<br />
Malaysia has been the largest recipient of Australian<br />
Colombo Plan scholarships and fellowships, with some 2,300 awards<br />
up to the end of last year. Then follows Indonesia, also with over<br />
2,000 awards; India 1,300 and Thailand 1,200. Numbers however do<br />
not tell the whole story, and the impact of Australian studies may<br />
be relatively greater in some of the smaller recipient countries<br />
than in the larger ones. The 56 Australian-trained students in the<br />
Maldive Islands, or the 30 Bhutanese, contribute significantly<br />
to the pooi of skills available in those countries, whereas our<br />
much greater contribution to a country like India must remain<br />
largely unseen. In all, over 13,000 Colombo Plan students and<br />
trainees have trained in Australia since the commencement of the<br />
Colombo Plan. Scholarships and fellowships have been provided for<br />
secondary and undergraduate courses, post-graduate studies and<br />
for academic work in research institutions. In the early days of<br />
the Colombo Plan a high percentage of awards was taken up for these<br />
formal courses. One interesting development, reflecting the<br />
changing needs and priorities of the developing countries, is the<br />
current trend towards short intensive courses outside the formal<br />
educational institutions.<br />
In 1972/ 73, the universities and technical colleges<br />
accounted for only 31 per cent of the new intake of sponsored<br />
students with 69 per cent undertaking non-formal types of training.<br />
This was almost the exact opposite of the respective percentages<br />
applying only five years earlier. I expect that this trend will<br />
continue as the educational institutions within the developing<br />
countries become more and more able to cope with their own needs,<br />
particularly at the undergraduate and secondary schools level.<br />
The practical courses of training to which I have just<br />
referred are designed to meet the needs of individual students<br />
and groups of students, and consequently follow varied patterns.<br />
Training may consist of practical attachments in Government<br />
departments and industry; international training courses in a<br />
wide range of fields, mainly concerned with agriculture and food<br />
production, administration and management, and professional and<br />
scientific subjects; courses in the English language; and awards </p>
<p>6.<br />
to train people to manage and control projects being set up in their<br />
homelands by Australia. Another means of help has been assistance<br />
to Australian universities to establish courses especially designed<br />
. to meet the needs of the developing countries, such as the<br />
Agricultural Development Economics course at the Australian<br />
National University.<br />
Australian academics and universities have themselves made<br />
a direct and valuable contribution to Australia's role in international<br />
education, not only through their contributions to the<br />
formulation of Aid policies, but also by direct participation in<br />
the business of aid. The Australian-Asian Universities Co-operation<br />
Scheme, administered through the Australian Vice-Chancellors'<br />
Committee, provides for a direct association between Australian<br />
universities and universities in Indonesia, Malaysia arnd Singapore.<br />
To avoid the dissipation of resources the area of activities has<br />
initially been confined to disciplines related to agriculture and<br />
food production, with the future intention of extending into<br />
population studies. The Scheme is financed from our aid funds.<br />
I should now like to mention Australian assistance to<br />
educational institutions in developing countries themselves, a<br />
somewhat less well known feature of Australian aid than the training<br />
provided in Australia.<br />
Under the Colombo Plan we have already provided experts and<br />
equipment to a number of countries. For instance, in Indonesia,<br />
Australia is providing adv ice to the Ministry of Education and<br />
Culture on the planning of vocational training programs and the<br />
training of technical teachers and administrators. Experts have<br />
been sent to the Jogjakarta Vocational Training Institute to advise<br />
on curriculum and teacher training.<br />
In Singapore, we are providing equipment and advice for<br />
instruction and curriculum planning at the Jurong Vocational<br />
Institute, and lecturers and examiners for medical degree<br />
examinations at the University of Singapore. In Malaysia,<br />
Australia has recently equipped a number of woodwork schools.<br />
. In Thailand, we have provided lecturers for the Language<br />
Institute, the North Bangkok Engineering School, and equipment for<br />
the Mahidol University and the Bangkok Technical Institute. </p>
<p>is*~ 7.<br />
In Korea, we have been assisting with instructors and<br />
equipment at a major Technical School for a number of years, at a<br />
cost of over half a million dollars. In laos, we have provided<br />
supplies for primary schools and are building a Forestry School,<br />
as well as providing instructors for the Vientiane Teachers'<br />
Training College. I consider initiatives such as these serve a good purpose<br />
and, as I shall mention later, this is an area to which we should<br />
divert increasing attention.<br />
Another area for development is that of " third country"<br />
awards, whereby Australia provides fellowships for students from a<br />
developing country to study in another country in the Colombo Plan<br />
region. Until recently, the number of awards of this type was very<br />
small, but such training offers distinct advantages. We should<br />
encourage it wherever appropriate. I have in mind educational<br />
institutions such as the Regional English Language Centre in<br />
Singapore, the Civil Aviation Training Centre, the Asian Institute<br />
of Technology in Bangkok and the International Rice Research<br />
Institute in Manila.<br />
I know the overriding question in many minds is whether<br />
our aid programs are working. Various studies of the results of our<br />
educational programs have been made. These have not been<br />
co-ordinated, nor are they by any means comprehensive; but they<br />
have contributed to our knowledge and appreciation of the problems<br />
involved. I have in mind the studies made by various research<br />
scholars on the utilisation of Australian skills within the countries<br />
of South and South-East Asia; the effects of their Australian<br />
experience upon students' attitudes to their homelands, their<br />
employment on their return and the problems of communication<br />
experienced by the foreign student abroad.<br />
Within the Government the Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
has conducted for many years a follow-up evaluation covering<br />
returned students. On the initiative of Australia, the Colombo<br />
Plan Council for Technical Co-operation has now adopted a standard<br />
form of evaluation questionnaire directed to the recipient<br />
governments, to obtain their assessment of the results of training.<br />
abroad. The Departments of Foreign Affairs, Immigration and </p>
<p>Education have also been collaborating for the last two years with<br />
* the Australian-National University in a study undertaken as a part<br />
of a worldwide examination by the United Nations Institute for<br />
Training and Research ( UNITAR) of the effects of study abroad upon<br />
the attitudes of foreign students, in relation to the problem of<br />
the so-called " brain drain".<br />
These studies are a necessary part of the process of review<br />
and assessment. Inevitably, the 23 years of Colombo Plan activity<br />
are not an unrelieved history of success. Aspects of the programs<br />
have come in for criticism and it would be surprising if this were<br />
not so.* Looking at our total educational assistance, both through<br />
the Colombo Plan and. to private students, I have been concerned to<br />
see an ethnic and economic imbalance. Our educational aid has gone<br />
overwhelmingly to people of the Chinese race. Much as I respect and<br />
admire such people, we have tended to help those whose economic<br />
circumstances in many cases would have allowed them to help<br />
themselves. A poor student is unlikely to be able to take advantage<br />
of cdur educational opportunities no matter how brilliant<br />
scholastically unless he succeeds in gaining his own Government's<br />
Inomination for a Colombo Plan Scholarship. At the same time we have<br />
been reluctant to apply a means test to the citizens of other<br />
countries seeking to enter Australia for education, nor to apply<br />
other discriminatory measures.<br />
In considering how best to ensure that benefits are more<br />
equally open to other ethnic groups and to those in greatest need,<br />
I believe we should be providing greater assistance than at present<br />
for the development of educational institutions in the developing<br />
countries themselves. I recognise that there are difficulties.<br />
The supply of teachers and lecturers able to undertake assignments*<br />
abroad is not unlimited, The demands for staff arising from the<br />
Government's educational policies within Australia cannot yet be<br />
fully assessed. There are problems in the adaptation of Australian<br />
teachers and lecturers to the curricula and methods of other<br />
educational systems, to an alien cultural background, and often to<br />
a foreign language. However these are problems which I believe<br />
can be overcome with effective planning. I would see such expanded<br />
progress abroad as complementing continuing programs in Australia. </p>
<p>I also see value in extending the present system of Third<br />
Country fellowships for regional education and training institutions.<br />
We can provide training teams to conduct short courses within the<br />
developing countries in fields of study where this type of assistance<br />
can be effectively introduced. We will expand joint training courses<br />
already offered in collaboration with the Government of New Zealand<br />
and will investigate the possibilities of joint arrangements for<br />
training abroad with international organisations such as the<br />
World Bank. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Aid drew<br />
attention to the need to direct our assistance away from the heavy<br />
preponderance of private students pursuing undergraduate studies<br />
in Australia. As I have explained earlier, this readjustment has<br />
already occurred in the Colombo Plan. Within an officially<br />
sponsored aid program, worked out between Governments, the level<br />
of studies can be readily adjusted to the specific needs of each<br />
country, at its particular stage of development.<br />
It is far more difficult, however, to influence the<br />
aspirations of private citizens in other countries whose sights are<br />
set upon an academic career. As I found during my visit to Thailand,<br />
the tradition of study abroad is well established. The Thai<br />
Government and individual citizens attach great importance to the<br />
opportunities we have offered to their young students and we must<br />
take due account of their views.<br />
-I turn now to the question of the return of students to<br />
their homeland after their studies. The objectives of our sponsored<br />
programs -the transfer of knowledge and training to the developing<br />
countries -would be defeated if the skills acquired abroad were not<br />
taken home by the student. This has been a matter to which Australia<br />
and its Colombo Plan partners have always attached considerable<br />
importance. Indeed it was on the Australian initiative that it was<br />
made the subject of special study by the Colombo Plan Consultative<br />
Committee in 1972. To limit a " brain drain", the Colombo Plan<br />
Council for Technical Co-operation, which represents all donor and<br />
all recipient governments, requires that every trainee under the<br />
Colombo Plan shall return home on the completion of his training.<br />
In addition, most home governments impose a money bond or a bond<br />
of service on their trainees to encourage their return or compensate </p>
<p>for the loss of their skills. This is a contract between the<br />
recipient government and its own citizens in which the donor<br />
government is not directly involved.<br />
The same general arrangements apply in Australia to trainees<br />
under other schemes for sponsored training, which extend the<br />
Colombo Plan principle to other areas of the world.<br />
Given these arr-angements the return of sponsored stude-nts<br />
has not proved to be a problem. Less than 2 per cent of the total1<br />
number of sponsored students remain in Australia, in most instances<br />
because of the thoroughly laudable reason that they have married<br />
Australians. Private students are in a different position. There are<br />
at the moment approximately 10,000 private overseas students in<br />
Australia and there have been about 40,000 in the period since 1950,<br />
They are quite distinct from sponsored students, They have no<br />
official backing from their own governments; they are enrolled by<br />
direct personal application to Australian institutions; they<br />
provide their own financ-ia. resources to travel to Australia and t,-o<br />
maintain and educate themselves. Nevertheless, government subsidies<br />
-to educational. institutions in respect of places occupied by private<br />
ovecse: s students amoun-ted to about $ 9.5 million in 1972. My<br />
Government's abolition of tertiary fees will considerably increase<br />
indirect assistance to private students of this kind.<br />
Private students have been coming to Australia since the<br />
beginning of the century. The first arrangements for student entry<br />
were made in 1904. Over the years many thousands of private Asian<br />
students have studied in Australia and returned home to help in<br />
the development of their countries.<br />
Until 1973 the private overseas students program was<br />
considered an adjunct to aid to developing countries. My<br />
Government's objectives in reviewing the admission of private students<br />
has been to place emphasis on good relations and cultural exchange.<br />
Under our new policy private students continue to enter Australia on<br />
a temporary basis; but if successful private students wish to remain<br />
in Australia and can meet the normal migration criteria, the<br />
Australian Government will no longer compel them to depart. As in<br />
the past, I expect that most private students will continue to see </p>
<p>their future in their own homelands. We have been inclined to<br />
exaggerate -the attractions of Australia to the young people of other<br />
countries. The ties of family and friends, their obligations to<br />
their fellow countrymen and their own natural attachment to the land<br />
of their birth will draw most of the students home when their studies<br />
are completed. Some will wish to remain, including some whose skills<br />
are also needed in their own countries.<br />
In my recent Asian tour some coiuntries, notably Singapore,<br />
expressed concern at the contributory effect this policy would have<br />
on the " brain drain" and the loss of skilled personnel. I consider<br />
the onus most properly lie on the home country to impose the<br />
limitations and barriers or conditions that it considers necessary.<br />
It must also bear the odium or responsibility of requiring its<br />
students to return. I have agreed with the Prime Minister of<br />
Singapore that in future all Singapore private students should be<br />
officially sponsored by the Government of Singapore to ensure their<br />
return to Singapore at the conclusion of their studies. There could<br />
be cases where humanitarian considerations might require a depar-ture<br />
from this principle. Mr Lee agreed that this could be so.<br />
In looking at the results achieved by the Colombo Plan<br />
in thp educational area, we have to remember that we are not<br />
dealing only with statistics but with human beings. Not that the<br />
statistics are unimpressi-ve. More than 13,000 sponsored students<br />
have passed through the scheme up to the end of 1973. Sponsored<br />
overseas students' results at the annual examinations of Australian<br />
universities have been very satisfactory, with a pass rate of over<br />
per cent in 1972 ( the last year for which figures are available).<br />
That is a tribute to the care with which they were selected, their<br />
personal efforts, and the assistance they received from their tutors<br />
and mentors here. But impressive and important as these figures<br />
are, they are less significant than the contributions that these<br />
students have made to the economic and social development of their<br />
countries and the effects that they have had upon our relationships<br />
Viith their own governments and peoples.<br />
We have trained under the Colombo Plan 1,800 engineers,<br />
2,500 educationists, 900 agriculturalists, 900 medical and health </p>
<p>workers, 550 nurses, and over 1, C00 public administrators. I can<br />
list for you Members of Parliament, Governors of Provinces, Heads<br />
of Departments, senior scientists, professors, and a host of senior<br />
and middle administrators in Asian countries who have received their<br />
education and training with us in Australia. These are facts. They<br />
are a record of important achievement. But they are not the full<br />
story. An equally important, less easily defined, achievement is<br />
the growth of bonds between Australia and the developing countries,<br />
a heightened level of understanding between us, and perhaps most<br />
gratifying of all, a withering away of xenophobia, isolationism and<br />
racism in Australia. I have no doubt that your seminar will make<br />
its own important contribution to these great objectives of<br />
enlightenment, tolerance and understanding."<br />
