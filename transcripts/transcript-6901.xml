TRANSCRIPT OF THE PM ON SUNDAY--4 MAY 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
OAKES: What are you going to do about Lionel Murphy?,<br />
PM: Well the first thing is that I'm going to make no comment<br />
about Lionel Murphy, Laurie.<br />
OAKES: But how can you get away with making no comment on an<br />
issue that is so important the integrity of the High Court.<br />
PM: My responsibility is not to make a comment on this program<br />
and I mean no disrespect to you in saying that and I know you<br />
appreciate that. My responsibility and the responsibility of the<br />
Government is to study whatever may, or in a sense may not be<br />
relevant to this question, well do that.<br />
RAMSAY: Despite what you've said, he plans to return to the<br />
High Court, to sit on the High Court bench next Tuesday. Now<br />
you're quite satisfied that the integrity and status of the High<br />
Court is not going to be damaged by him going back in the midst<br />
of a continuing controversy, both in the public and the political<br />
arena about Mr Justice Murphy.<br />
PM: Let me just eay. two things. Firstly, to repeat I'm not<br />
going to make sWz.'-osmnt about Mr Justice Lionel Murphy and in<br />
regard to the High Court, I and my government will have clearly<br />
in our considerations the position and integrity of the High<br />
Court of Australia.<br />
OAKES: Well your refusal to comment will be seen as refusing to<br />
endorse his return. Isn't that in effect the comment?<br />
PM: It's for others to interpret. It's for me to act properly.<br />
I will do that.<br />
RAMSAY: Can we ask you why your Deputy Prime Minister, the<br />
Attorney General, Mr Bowen, saw the Chief Justice of the High<br />
Court yesterday?<br />
PM: Yes you can ask me but you won't get an answer.<br />
RAMISAY: Did he do so on your behalf?<br />
PM: Not on my behalf, but with my knowledge. </p>
<p>OAKES: Prime Minister has you read the secret volume of the<br />
Stewart Royal Commission Report?<br />
PM: I haven't read it fully yet.<br />
OAKES: Are there references to Mr Justice Murphy in it.<br />
PM: Laurie you don't expect me to answer that and I'm not going<br />
to. OAKES: But isn't that crucial to the whole question of whether<br />
he should return?<br />
PM: It may or may not be Laurie, but let me repeat the answer<br />
I've given before and I don't want to be disrespectful to you but<br />
let me say it firmly so you'll have it clearly in your mind. My<br />
responsibility is to study this matter, as I will to discuss it<br />
with my colleagues and in the confidence of Cabinet and not on<br />
the publicity of this program and I'm not going to do it.<br />
RAMSAY: Mr Hawke I'm just going to ask you another question<br />
about this. Can you be satisfied that the integrity of the High<br />
Court can be preserved while Justice Murphy continues to sit on<br />
the High Court while this controversy goes on?<br />
PM: It is clear from the previous answers given Alan that I'm<br />
not going to answer that question.<br />
OAKES: Well moving on to a related matter but not specifically<br />
on Justice Murphy. The New South Wales Premier, Mr Wran, has<br />
attacked Mr Clarrie Briese who was the main witness against the<br />
judge in the recent court case. Does Mr Briese, who deals with<br />
federal issues as well as state law, have your confidence?<br />
PM: I've heard that question before and my answer is that that's<br />
a matter within New South Wales. I'm not going to make any<br />
comment on that.<br />
OAKES: But when you heard it before<br />
PM: I'm not going to make any comment on it Laurie. You can<br />
rephrase the question 17 different ways. my answer will remain<br />
the same, I have no comment.<br />
RAMSAY: Your Attorney General answer a question of that sort in<br />
the Parliament.<br />
PM: Yes I was sitting in the Parliament when he answered, yes.<br />
RAMSAY: Well why shouldn't you be asked that sort of question<br />
and why shouldn't you answer it?<br />
PM: You're perfectly entitled to ask it. I have no objection to<br />
you asking the question. I'm not going to add to the answer I've<br />
already given to you.<br />
OAKES: Well Mr Justice Stewart made some recommendations about<br />
widening state police powers to tap telephones. What's your </p>
<p>attitude to those?<br />
PM: Well I'm going to study the recommendations in full over<br />
this weekend and see to what extent it may be necessary, if we<br />
agree to those recommendations, to go beyond the legislation<br />
which the Attorney General has already prepared. And we'll be<br />
considering this matter in the near future.<br />
RAMSAY: Are you confident, Mr Hawke, that you could overcome<br />
hostility within the Caucus to this question of the wider<br />
extension of phone taps given the whole area of civil liberties?<br />
PM: Well I'm confident that if the Cabinet makes a decision<br />
which we believe is the appropriate one, having considered the<br />
recommendations of Mr Justice Stewart, that the Caucus would<br />
accept, with proper exposition, what the Cabinet puts to them.<br />
We have a good record of cooperation and understanding with the<br />
Caucus. I see no reason to see that's going to come to an end.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister, do you think it would have been better<br />
when this Murphy affair first blew up, the Age tapes, to have had<br />
a Royal Commission then, into the whole matter?<br />
PM: No. I believe that the course of action that was taken, the<br />
decision of the Government was correct. Now we will be, as I<br />
say, considering this issue now. I'm not concerned with the<br />
past. I'm concerned with the present and the future.<br />
RAMSAY: You don't find any embarrassment for your government<br />
given that two senior members of your government, early in the<br />
piece, branded these tapes, or these transcripts of the tapes as<br />
phoneys and fakes?<br />
PM: If you wanted me to I could quote here at length from the<br />
first volume of Mr Justice Stewart to give precisely the very<br />
careful interpretation he's given as to the tapes and the<br />
transcripts. Now let me say it is not a black and white case, as<br />
you know f rom -having read what Mr Justice Stewart had to say in<br />
volume one.<br />
OAKES: Has any member of the Government spoken to Mr Justice<br />
Murphy about his future?<br />
PM: Not that I'm aware of.<br />
OAKES: You haven't asked anyone to do that?<br />
PM: No.<br />
OAKES: Will you do that?<br />
PM: I will adhere to the answer I gave to this question at the<br />
beginning. I'm not saying anything more. I have no comment<br />
about this issue. </p>
<p>OAKES: In the light of that Prime Minister, we will ask you<br />
about Indonesia?<br />
PM: Good.<br />
OAKES: How serious is the rift with Jakarta?<br />
PM: I don't think we can honestly understate it, Laurie. I<br />
think it has been serious. And I think perhaps there has been a<br />
tendency in the past in some quarters to overstate the importance<br />
of the relationship, to believe that there is more than can be<br />
obtained from the relationship than intrinsically can in fact<br />
occur. As you know, I think both Bill Hayden and I have worked<br />
assiduously from day one to try and create a viable, constructive<br />
relationship with Indonesia. I don't regret that and we will<br />
continue to try and have a constructive relationship. But no<br />
Government led by me is going to have a grovelling relationship,<br />
one in which, if there is capricious action on the part of<br />
Indonesia, that we accept that without comment. And as I had<br />
cause to say while I was overseas, and repeated on the floor of<br />
the Parliament, and have pleasure of saying again on your<br />
program, what Indonesia must understand is that this is a full<br />
democracy. And a distinguishing characteristic of this and of<br />
other full democracies is the freedom of the press. That is not<br />
something that is on the bargaining table as far as I am<br />
concerned and never will be as far as I am concerned.<br />
OAKES: You mentioned the work you have done to improve relations<br />
you went to Indonesia very early in your Prime Ministership,<br />
you fought the left wing of the Labor Party to change policy in<br />
the light of that, to what extent do what extent do you regard<br />
what has happened as a personal slap in the face.<br />
PM: I don't think it is a personal slap in the face. I would<br />
have hoped that those in authority would have been aware of the<br />
hard and continuous work that I, and more particularly Bill<br />
because it is his portfolio area, have been doing to try and<br />
create that relationaship. And I guess they must be aware that<br />
this has been some sort of a setback. But what I am concerned<br />
about is the interests of Australia and this nation, not about<br />
personal setbacks. And we are just going to have to conduct this<br />
relationship in a way which seeks as best we can to protect and<br />
advance the interests of Australia. That is what we will do.<br />
RAM4SAY: Mr Hawke, what do you think the cost to Australia would<br />
be if this rift proved to be long term?<br />
PM: Alan, I think you would appreciate, it is hard to quantify<br />
that. Indonesia is a nation of 160 million people, next to Papua<br />
New Guinea, in a sense our nearest neighbour, we are not going to<br />
say or look, if we say something which someone may not like that<br />
may hurt us. I believe that Australians want the dignity of<br />
Australia to be maintained, it is going to be under this<br />
Government. OAKES: Prime Minister, what are the defence implications of<br />
this row with Indonesia? </p>
<p>PM: Well, first of all, in simple money terms, we have<br />
million-odd defence cooperation program. I notice that General<br />
Moerdani has given some indications that he doesn't think it is<br />
worth much. If they make the decision that they don't want that<br />
cooperation, then that will be their decision. I think it would<br />
be an unfortunate decision because I think it has mutual<br />
advantages. But don't let us get to the point, Laurie, of<br />
believing that because we are going through this unfortunate<br />
experience at the moment that there is any threat situation<br />
emerging. I don't believe that is the case.<br />
OAKES: The Indonesian Armed Forces newspaper has attacked<br />
Australia several times in the last few weeks.<br />
PM: I have noticed that and I guess the paradox doesn't escape<br />
you, Laurie, that the originating factor recently in this<br />
situation has been an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, over<br />
which we as a Government, not only have no control but no<br />
knowledge. They take that as a slight upon them. Yet in their<br />
official army newspaper, which is directly under the control of<br />
the army and senior members of the administration, they attack<br />
us. There is a paradox there.<br />
OAKES: But it is sabre rattling isn't it?<br />
PM: I don't want to call it sabre rattling. I think it is very<br />
unfortunate. And of course, the important thing is that the<br />
basis of the articles in the army newspapers is totally specious.<br />
L-Y~ I IIIII ~-C~-Y--LIU </p>
<p>OAKES: Prime Minister, what's the Hawke Government's main<br />
priority maintaining the levels of social benefits, or<br />
maintaining the Trilogy?<br />
PM: well I think the main purpose of this government is to<br />
maintain the thrust of economic policy, which has given us high<br />
levels of growth, high levels of employment growth, with<br />
containable levels of inflation. In 1986, and I will not give , a<br />
long economic exposition, but I simply make the point that we<br />
have the constraints during this year of the current account and<br />
so we've had to conduct policy in a way which is bringing back<br />
somewhat the levels of growth. We can't afford to be sucking in<br />
the level of imports that we've had. So growth will be<br />
constrained somewhat, but not in a way that is going to stop<br />
employment growth.<br />
RAMSAY: But can you maintain present level, or increase the<br />
present level of welfare benefits and still keep your trilogy<br />
promises? PM: I believe that the basic Trilogy promise, which refers to<br />
the life of the Parliament, will be maintained. I think we have<br />
to exercise a constraint upon ourselves, Alan, if we're going to<br />
make sure that the growth that we want is there without<br />
dissipating inflation. And it is going to be hard in 1986. I've<br />
said that, but I believe that we're going to get there.<br />
OAKES: To what extent will maintaining the Trilogy involve<br />
cutting back on welfare programs?<br />
PM: I don't think it's a question of cutting back on welfare.<br />
Within the Trilogy you're still able to have real growth, as you<br />
appreciate. It's going to be question of trying to rearrange<br />
priorities. We're going through a very tough period in the<br />
Expenditure Review Committee, in leading up to the Budget. It's<br />
not easy, tough task. But we'll get there, we've delivered the<br />
goods in a way that I think no other government in the post war<br />
period is done with such responsibility. We've got the runs on<br />
the board and I think we'll get them there again.<br />
RAMSAY: You mention the Expenditure Review Committee. Have you<br />
yet been able to cut the $ 1.4 billion that Paul Keating<br />
PM: No we're still got a way to go Alan.<br />
RAMISAY: How far have you got?<br />
PM: Come on, I can't give you those figures.<br />
OAKES: Prime minister, how ironclad is your promise to cut<br />
taxes? PM: The tax cuts will be delivered.<br />
OAKES: Well Senator Walsh said in the Senate yesterday that<br />
could depend on whether your fringe tax legislation got through<br />
the Senate. Is it conditional only? </p>
<p>PM: Well obviously the capacity to deliver relates to the<br />
revenue you get. Now no government has been more explicit in its<br />
exposition of its fiscal policy than we have. And we set out<br />
what the measured revenue would be from the tax changes. Now<br />
obviously that constitutes our capacity. Now I believe that the<br />
Opposition, if such you can call it, and the Democrats have got a<br />
very heavy responsibility if they're going to deny to government,<br />
substantially deny to government, the revenue capacity, then they<br />
must recognise that that has implications for the Government in<br />
terms of capacity to deliver tax cuts.<br />
RAMSAY: So you're saying if they do muck about with the<br />
legislation in the Senate some part or portion of these very<br />
specific tax cuts, in the next two years, may be reduced.<br />
PM: I'm, if I may say so, much more sophisticated than saying if<br />
they much about, Alan. I said, if you had a substantial<br />
interference with your revenue capacity measures, then by<br />
definition, that must affect. Now I hope, and I believe<br />
certainly in regard to the Democrats because you can't as an<br />
intelligent person expect anything reasonable from this<br />
Opposition, but as far as the Democrats are concerned I think we<br />
have an undertaking and an understanding with them that they will<br />
substantially pass, or facilitate the passing of our measures.<br />
OAKES: So in that event the tax cuts will go through as promised<br />
and come into effect in September.<br />
PM: Well I've given you the answers about the tax cuts, which is<br />
the appropriate one. I can't add anything more to it. </p>

OAKES: Prime Minister, there are now many more people on the<br />
dole than are looking a for full time employment. And last week<br />
on this program Senator Chipp said that something had to be done<br />
about dole bludgers. Is that a problem that concerns you<br />
seriously? And if so, what can you do about it, what will you do<br />
about it?<br />
* PM: we are looking at the question, Laurie, of the exercise by<br />
the Department of the work test. There is work being done on<br />
that. And we expect to get further reports on it. I don't want<br />
to leave the impression, however, that Australia is bedevilled<br />
with dole bludgers. I think that that syndrome has substantially<br />
disappeared. I accept the fact that there are obviously some who<br />
are getting the benefit who shouldn't be. That is why we are<br />
looking at the question of the way in the work test is applied.<br />
I think there can be improvements. And if we can see ways in<br />
which that can be done it will be.<br />
RAMSAY: Prime Minister, your biographer, Blanche d'Alpuget,<br />
suggested in a recent article that you had become rather bored<br />
and rather tired and in fact the whole thrust of her article<br />
suggested that you were a more boring man than you used to be.<br />
How do you react to that?<br />
PM: It is for others'-to judge whether I am boring or not, Alan.<br />
I am not bored. I can honestly say I have never felt more<br />
vibrant in the job, happier, than I am now. I had a period<br />
before the last election when I was down and dispirited. And I<br />
don't go into that. The reasons for that are gone. And I feel<br />
well. Hazel has got me well and truly into a Pritikin diet which<br />
is doing marvels for me both physically and I think mentally as<br />
well. The challenges are there, I am enjoying them. And the<br />
team I have got working with me I like. No man, I believe Alan,<br />
could be given a greater responsibility, opportunity than I am.<br />
And I am enjoying the challenge.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
PM: Thank you Laurie and Alan.<br />
