BROADCAST BY T~ IE PRIME MINISTER THE, RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT iv NZIES, AT ' r-ORT MERLSY, NEW<br />
GUINEA, AT 7.15 P. m. ON 6TH SEPTEMBER, 1963<br />
Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I want to say something about the attitude of the<br />
Australian Government to these territories.<br />
We regard ourselves as trustees for Papua-New Guinea.<br />
We are not colonialists in the old and now rejected<br />
sense. We are certainly not exploiters we put into these<br />
territories far more than we get out or perhiaps are ever likely<br />
to get out. This year Australia will provide, by way of direct<br />
grant, over Å“-25M towards the cost of developing Papua-New Guinea<br />
per cent, more than last year.<br />
We are not oppressors. On the contrary, our dominant<br />
aim is to raise the material, intellectual, social and political<br />
standards and self-reliance of the indigenous peoples . to a point<br />
at which they may freely and competently choose their own future,<br />
There are some modern fashi., ns of thought that I have<br />
encountered that political independence should precede economic<br />
viability;<br />
that democratic self-government is something that can<br />
be created, artificially, from the top, and that it will<br />
then find its way down to the grass roots; and<br />
that speed is mauch more important than certainty or<br />
security.<br />
Now I think that you will agree that it is important that I should<br />
say something about each of these propositions.<br />
1 say freedom is an inborn right, and not a concession<br />
by povuer. This means equality before the law, a free choice of<br />
occupotion, freedom of association and so on.<br />
But people who are, taken as individuals, free, are<br />
not necessarily taken as members of a commijP, 1.. x ripe for political<br />
independence. In a community sense, genuinely free institutions<br />
of government are essential for the preservation of Indiidual<br />
freedom, Recent years have produced instances we all know<br />
them in which the grant of self-government has led to a form of<br />
dictatorship or oligarchy, government by a few, in which the freedom<br />
of the individual has been suppressed or gravely limited,<br />
" Individual freedom" and " political independence" are<br />
therefore not synonymous. They can, by the careful cultivation of<br />
the various local and national means of organised self-government,<br />
be made to co-exist -individual freedom and political independence<br />
made to co-exist. This is our policy in Papua and New Guinea,<br />
But, when considering political factors, we cannot<br />
sensibly ignore the economic ones. To give a former colony or<br />
territory political independence, while leaving it economically<br />
dependent upon the actions of others, is to expose it to grave risks<br />
soo/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
of " loaded" assistance, undue political pressure from outside<br />
nations or interests, a temptation to barter its freedom of<br />
political action for cash or goods in hand.<br />
That is why we regard the economic development of<br />
Papua and New Guinea along lines which they can successfully<br />
follow when political independence has been granted, as of vital<br />
importance. Wat k nd of economicdevel ~ int do we eznyjq~ age_, and<br />
what are its Drbems? I~ rtwe must carry on, with all thae speed which<br />
humnan and material resources will permit, the basic work of educating<br />
the people, not only for political citizenship, but also for<br />
increased economic capacity; better knowledge of agricultural and<br />
pastoral production, better technical skill, administrative<br />
capacity at all levels.<br />
Second, we must take all steps to make improved<br />
techniques available to what I may call, in the well-known phrase,<br />
the " man on the land". Not trying to convert every small sustjenance<br />
tiller of the soil in some remote valley into a " cs crop"<br />
aproducer; but at the same time increasing the number and capacity<br />
Wof those producing cash crops, not only for improved living at home,<br />
but for exports to earn some of the money needed for imports and<br />
investment. Thrd On the economic side, we have to consider what<br />
WI will call the three Tts Transport, Trade and Tariff.<br />
The marketing capacity of the Territories! producers,<br />
be they agricultural, pastoral, mineral, or processing, will be<br />
profoundly affected by the means of transport. And in this<br />
country, that means roads, air services coastal shipping facilities.<br />
Much has been done; much more must be Aone in the future,<br />
Export trade must be developed. with new markets,<br />
particularly in the countries of the South-West Pacific and South<br />
East Asia. This is tremendously important. The Commonwealth<br />
S Department of Trade is constantly active in this field, but I agree<br />
Wmuch remains to be done.<br />
Trade with Australia, as distinct from these other<br />
countries I've been mentioning, involves Tariff considerations which<br />
are never slimple. Yet they must be solved as must be the problem<br />
of non-Australian markets, if there is to Le industrial development<br />
in Papua and New Guinea. Much thought is to be given to the-pattern<br />
of such development if we are to see a proper economic growth in<br />
these Territories on terms and conditions I want you to mark this<br />
on terms and conditions which will be sustainable by an independent<br />
and self-governing community in due course.<br />
Fourth, we must encourage those settlers who have, over<br />
the years, done so much to help the growth of the New Guinea economy<br />
in production and commerce, Australia herself the mainland<br />
needs and obtains much useful capital investment from overseas.<br />
How much more do these Territories need it. Yet I know that we here<br />
encounter a reluctance which proceeds from a feeling of uncertainty.<br />
Can the man who invests the capital be reasonably sure of a proper<br />
opportunity to secure the fruits of his enterprise? For myself,<br />
I understand these doubts, though I cannot say that I share them in<br />
any substantial sense. Now, why do I say this? You may say it is<br />
easy enough to say it.<br />
Well, I will refer to the defence of the territory<br />
later on, I want to indicate that we, Australia, are not going to<br />
be hurried out. We have a long job ahead of us and you have and<br />
we intend to complete it. One of our great objectives is that when<br />
Independence Day arrives, it will come in a spirit of friendship and<br />
good will, in which the indigenous inhabitants will appreciate the<br />
a* to 9/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
investment and work of what I believe are called the expatriate<br />
settlers, will realise how these have contributed to their social and<br />
economic growth, and will wish to preserve them, Whether concr'ete<br />
guar'antees or supports can be given to investors is, I need hardly<br />
tell. you, a most complex matter. My colleague, Mr. Hasluck, whose<br />
devotion to his difficult office wye all admire so much, has given this<br />
problem a lot of attention. A group of leading businessmen from<br />
Australia recently visited you. It has furnished a valuable report<br />
which, as I saw it just a few hours before coming up here, I have not<br />
yet had time to consider, but I know that it is valuable and suggestive,<br />
The W orld Bank's Mission I hope to see in Canberra not long<br />
after my return. I can tell you that in addressing ourselves to<br />
this problem, we will have in our minds a clear belief that without<br />
morp investment for development and production, these Territories will<br />
just not have an economic strength to sustain political independence;<br />
that it is our duty as a governiment to seek out and apply whatever<br />
practical and reasonable measures can be devised orthodox or novel<br />
to encourage and sustain confidence and growth through willing and<br />
co-operative investment and effort.<br />
In short, we want to work with you. We certainly will not<br />
run away from you,<br />
In spite of superficial critics, who know little or nothing<br />
* of the vast complexities of a country with -a fringe of modern economic<br />
acti~ vity and a deep hinterland of primitive civilisation and activity,<br />
our tasks cannot be performed in a year or two. However great our<br />
activity, it will be a long haul. There are hundreds of tribes and<br />
languages, each with its own pattern of life. The job is not ' to<br />
* destroy those patterns, but to adapt and modify them against the<br />
background of better health and medical services, better education,<br />
better means of transport, better knowledge of production.<br />
Not one of these elements can be dealt with in isolation,<br />
nor can they be forced upon distant and perhaps unreceptive people.<br />
We have, all of us that means you as well as myself a lot to<br />
study and a lot to learn about the ways and means of raising the<br />
standards of primitive people while not blindly or stupidly assuming<br />
that they will ultimately resemble, in social and economic structure,<br />
Australia herself, Democrati. c self-government I now turn to the second<br />
fashion that I referred to the pecular contribution of the Englishspeaking<br />
people to social and political history, took centuries to<br />
develop. With all the benefits of history and experience, such<br />
Sprocesses can of course, nowadays, occur much more rapidly. But it<br />
V is still true that you cannot create effective self-government merely<br />
by setting up, by statute or otherwise, a form of parliament.<br />
Democracy, my friends, is neither artificial nor easy. We have, I<br />
think, been approaching this matter in the right way in the development<br />
of local government and an increasingly representative Legislative<br />
Council. At all stages we maintain contact with informed local<br />
opinion, We are determined ~ o pursue these sensible processes,<br />
" without fear, favour, or affection." We will at all times be ready<br />
to receive advice and assistance in these tasks. But, as. the<br />
paramount consideration, one which it is our absolute duty not to<br />
forget, is the welfare of the people of these Territories, we will<br />
be unwilling to accept orders to take some hasty step which would<br />
cut across that duty. We will, in due course, take the decis4. on of<br />
the people whose trustees we are.<br />
Nothing of course, is more damaging to the growth of<br />
independent institutions than armed attack or invasion. These<br />
Territories have had bitter and devastating experience of that,<br />
Well, on this aspect of the matter I repeat what I said recently<br />
in Canberra, that: " We will defend these Territories as if they<br />
were part of our mainland; there must be no mistaken ideas about<br />
that." In that attitude, my friends, we have, as you know and as<br />
you have recently been reminded, the staunch backing of our ANZUS<br />
partner, the United States of America. 00* 004/ 4. </p>
<p>Now, it follows from what I have said that, in moving<br />
tdwards self-government, speed is not more important than certainty<br />
or security, This does not mean that we are to have a " go-slow"<br />
policy. I once said that, if and when we reached a point at which<br />
we felt that the people were approaching, getting very very close<br />
to readiness for self-determination, but we were not sure, still<br />
had a lingering hesitation, it would be better to ac-u then too soon<br />
than too late, But we are as yet a long way from that stage, as<br />
the leaders of the indigenous peoples have frequently agreed and as<br />
indeed they have stated to me in the highlands in the last thirtysix<br />
hours, We want a sound feeling about the wishes of the people of<br />
these Territories. We want security for those who are now there, and<br />
for those who are to come.<br />
Meanwhile, nobody but a pure theorist could say that the<br />
pace of progress is too slow, In the field of education, which is<br />
by common consent very important, I will just give some facts you<br />
know them but other people may not.<br />
By 1958 the number of registered and recognised mission<br />
schools was 274, By 1962 this is only four years later this<br />
number had increased almost five-fold. Administration schools have<br />
increased from 44 in 1951 to 431 in 1962, and of course much is being<br />
done in secondary and technical schools. We are also having an<br />
investigation at present about university possibilities. Meanwhile,<br />
there are 88 post-primary and secondary schools, of which 20 are<br />
technical. Here are the proofs of great headway under the helpful<br />
administration of a nation ( our own) which, in the case of Papua and<br />
New Guinea, rates its duty much higher than its rights.<br />
And, I rapeat, it is rujsolutely determined to do its<br />
duty by the whole of the people of the twin territories, indigenous<br />
or otherwise. Now let me end up by saying this to you. In speaking<br />
to you, one of the things I like to remember is that, while I speak<br />
as the head of a Liberal and Country Party Administration with, as<br />
you all know, a narrow majority, the Parliamentary approach to the<br />
future of these Territories is not marked by deep differences. Some<br />
of those who are listening to me tonight may, exercising a proper<br />
privile ge, say " A plague on both your Housesi" l Well, please don't<br />
think tha this sentiment makes you unique. I understand it, and<br />
( if I may make a confidential remark, not to be repeated) have<br />
occasionally thought so myself. But we are all, in a real sense,<br />
and whatever our differences of race or politics, members of the<br />
family. The neighbours cannot and should. not settle our domestic<br />
problems for us. But, with sense and fortitude and understanding<br />
and some imagination we can. I want -all of you to see this<br />
to see our common in~ crests clearly and to serve them faithfully.<br />
For in this way, my friends, we shall come to a happy and prosperous<br />
future, Good night and good luck to you all. </p>
