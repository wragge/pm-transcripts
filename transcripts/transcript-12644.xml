<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentleman I just thought I'd make a couple of observations about the Victorian election campaign and Mr Doyle, who I know you've spoken to at lunchtime, will make some observations as well and then we'd be happy to answer any questions.  </p>
<p>From my perspective, this election campaign is being fought against a background of a very strong national economy where because of that strong national economy, the Victorian economy is quite strong and that is self-evident.  And the strength of the Victorian economy is undoubtedly and overwhelmingly a product of the strength of the national economy.  People may therefore conclude, Victorians may conclude that really nothing can go wrong with the Victorian economy because the Australian economy is performing very strongly.  And whilst I would acknowledge that the strength of any state economy is predominantly driven by national economic management, it remains the case that if danger signs at a state level are ignored, if complacency at a state level sets in; if the view is taken at a state level that you can, over a period of time, implement policies at a local level that do damage at a local level, but that won't affect the overall strength of the economy, then that's a mistake.</p>
<p>The concern I would have about Victoria is that a number of the danger signs under this Government could well be ignored, that there is a sense of great complacency that nothing can go wrong in Victoria because the national economy is being run well.  Can I say that';s a mistake - that the industrial relations policy of the Victorian Government are worse than those of other Governments around Australia, that it can over time drive further jobs and more investment out of this State.  That the sort of impositions on small business of the employment legislation, the impact of the manslaughter provisions, and the [inaudible] of employment legislation, the ceding of ground to unions as evidenced by the decision on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  Those things, whilst at the moment they may not be having a great effect, over time they will begin to have an effect.  The message I would respectfully deliver is that yes, the Victorian economy is sound because of national economic management.  It's part of Australia and it's benefited from that, but that can be compromised and squandered over time if complacency sets in and the sort of things that I've referred to are to reaffirmed particularly if the Labor Party were to receive a large majority on Saturday.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think that the ground is lost here and that Robert Doyle can't win now?  Is that why you're here and why you're saying these things?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I';m here because I support the Liberal campaign in the election.  I support Robert Doyle.  I respect what he's done and I believe that he's been a fine leader and if given the opportunity, would be a good Premier of this State, that's why I';m here.  It's a tough election.  If the polls we've seen were to be repeated on Saturday, then the Labor Party will win in a landslide and that would not be good for Victoria, that would be bad for Victoria, certainly for the Victorian economy because it would induce a sense of complacency of which I've spoken about.  But I've been in politics long enough to know that a lot can happen over the last four days.  I was recounting to Robert Doyle the extraordinary contraction that occurred in the 1984 Federal election campaign when polls a week out indicated the Labor Party federally might win a majority close to 60 or 70 seats, and that dramatically tightened. A campaign's not over until the last vote is cast.  But it's very important that people don't assume that there's a heavy emphasis on international news and terrorism and of course people think the national economy is being run well - it is - that nothing can go wrong.  They all just assume that no matter what is done by the State Government, everything will be hunky-dory - that is not the case and over time that advantage could be very seriously eroded.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How do you explain though that the Liberals around the States seem to be performing so badly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am not a political commentator, I am a prime minister and a party leader.  I'll leave all of that to the Brian Costas and Shaun Carneys, Michael Gordons and all the other people who write these very erudite, learned columns - Ewin Hannan too, I'll leave that to them.  That's not for me, I am a mere participant, I';m an advocate, I';m a journeyman who's trying to make a contribution.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But would you concede that the Liberal Party needs to rebuild at state levels?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What's the next question?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When did you decide to come down to do this press conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I had indicated several weeks ago that I would be in Victoria today.  My principal reason for being in Victoria today was to open that magnificent X-ray facility, which is going to make it much harder for people to get drugs and guns into Australia.  And I indicated to Brian Loughnane and to Robert that I'd be happy to do a press conference or whatever.  So there's nothing last minute about this.  I was always going to be in Victoria.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>From your distant view do you think the State party has been running a good campaign?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the State party has run a very tight campaign.  I congratulate Robert Doyle and I congratulate the party organisation.  I've just talked briefly to Brian Loughnane about the on-the-ground part of the campaign and I think they';ve done an excellent job.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the latest fury over the political advertising…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my understanding, I mean I'll leave it to the experts, that's Robert and Brian, but my understanding is that all the assertions were based on material on the public record.  I mean, there's nothing to justify the description of furore but Robert may want to say something about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Hewlett Packard who was named in one of the ads has come out and said today they're not leaving Victoria…?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Well remember that all of these are based, as the Prime Minister said, on material that is already in the public domain. You know, all we are doing is saying - here is where it was in the public domain, we're very happy to show you for each and every one of those companies where it occurred and where it was published and that is the simple fact of the matter.  Now, I understand the difficulties for companies involved. These are very difficult matters for them, but the fact remains each and every one is on the public record.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So those companies shouldn't have complained?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>No.  I mean, they have a perfect right to put their view.  But the question was asked as to whether it was factual - the answer is yes and we will stick by those advertisements. There is no doubt in our minds that they are 100% accurate and we will stand behind them 100%.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it correct that they're not running them tonight?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>No, it is not correct.  We will continue to run those advertisements.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are they complaining because they are intimidated do you think?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Well, I think that's something you'd have to ask them.  I know that there are some concerns that the Labor Party have rung them up and put the heavy roller over them couple of times and they';ve been referred here, there and everywhere within the machinery of the Bracks machine but that's a matter for them to answer not for me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you or Brian tell us who in the Labor Party has put the heavy roller over them…?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Well, as I've said, that is a question for them.  I stand entirely by what Brian Loughnane said in the newspapers this morning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] can the companies have their names removed?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>No, this is a matter of the public record. I mean this was on the public record, it was reported in all of your media and all we are doing is saying this was what was on the public record, it is a matter of fact.  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But aren't they being used for your political advantage?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>It's not a political advantage, this is the truth of the matter.  I mean, the Prime Minister before spoke about the consequences of complacency.  I would say that the Bracks Government in its last month went further than complacency, they got cocky and they still are.  They believe that they are going to win come next Saturday.  As the Prime Minister said, that if those polls are repeated it will be a landslide for Labor and that is not good for Victoria.  It is my job to say to people consider very carefully the consequences of your vote on Saturday because the consequences of that vote will mean job losses in Victoria. It will mean an industrial relations climate which drives investment away, if you do that you lose jobs.  That's just not me saying it, that was Daniel Grollo at the Property Council.  And, as I say, each of these companies already on the public record have shed jobs.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you just provide us with a list? </p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>I';m happy to do so. Yes we are happy to do so.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just talking about newspaper articles…</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Just newspaper articles? Well that';s a remarkable thing to say from a journalist. Are you suggesting the newspaper articles were wrong?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Exactly right. So I can certainly provide you with a  list of those. I can you provide you with a list of those fine sources.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>These companies are saying job cuts have nothing to do with unions at all…?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Well we are happy to point out a number of articles where the point is made very clearly, and I could point you to for instance Robert Gottliebsen';s article in August which talked about 16 manufacturers in Victoria meeting with the Premier of New South Wales because of concerns with the industrial relations climate following a State election which Labor might win. Now that';s not us reporting that – these are your colleagues and your reporters. So we are happy to stand behind those advertisements 100 per cent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Siemens says they asked for their name to be removed and it's been removed?</p>
<p>DOYLE:</p>
<p>Well that is not my understanding. We have a very clear indication and again we have the media reports of that. We stand behind those advertisements 100 per cent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, a slight detour…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A slight detour?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just a slight detour, there's a horse being banned - the owners have named it 'Johnny Say Sorry' - it had to be renamed…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How do you know that? Was it in the form guide? Like… somebody out of Johnny? I mean what was it? I heard a reference to it. I mean I have a great affection for the place that horse racing occupies in the hearts of many Australians but as you know, I don';t follow… I mean if you';d asked me about Pigeon';s catch, then I may have been able to give you chapter and verse. But I did hear reference to it. I think I heard a reference to it on the ABC this morning when I was driving out to the airport. I think Sally Loane mentioned it. I think it was replaced by something… what was the new name?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I don';t know the new name.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The old name Johnny Say Sorry was apparently a reference to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Was it? Who was the owner of the horse?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I don';t know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just on the ABC – is Peter Reith on the short list for the Board?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is no short list. There is no vacancy. That vacancy will be considered when it occurs.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>… board member?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';m not going to speculate about that. Look, we haven';t got a vacancy. It will be dealt with then. I';ve got far more important things on my mind at the moment than a casual vacancy on the ABC Board.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One of those things is security.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This morning, at the weekend you expressed a hope that x-raying could extend from all domestic flights as well as internationally. How confident are you…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it will be something that we';re going to address. We';ve got a Cabinet meeting next week and the issue will be discussed at that Cabinet meeting. It';s not something you can bring in overnight. We already have, by world standards, quite tight inspections. I';m told that on flights to the United States the inspection level is up to 100 per cent. We';re going to introduce it progressively at a domestic level. I know that will involve some additional delay and inconvenience for people but I believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians will be willing to put up with that delay and inconvenience because of the broader national interest involved. I';ll have something more to say about it next week after Cabinet has had a discussion. I would see it being rolled out in phases. It will probably start in some of the major ports – Sydney, Melbourne – and then be progressively extended around the country. And it will take time – you can';t do it overnight. But we will bring it in as speedily as we possibly can.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think this new x-ray facility is going to help border control?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It certainly will make an enormous difference. I mean the flexibility and the dexterity of that equipment is quite remarkable. It will identify drugs, guns, potentially explosives. Although it was primarily designed to detect guns and drugs, it will also because of that have a coincidental benefit and dividend in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the ACTU wants the IRC to extend unpaid maternity leave to two years in Federal awards. Will the Federal Government support that case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we will make a submission. We';ll have a look at that. My view is that whenever a firm can provide maternity leave to one of its workers, then that should be encouraged. That';s a good thing. And many companies have quite generous maternity leave provisions. But I don';t believe in forcing paid or unpaid maternity leave on small firms that can';t afford the provision. That in the end actually limits the employment opportunities of a lot of women and it becomes quite counterproductive. So the concept, yes, but if it involves forcing small firms in particular to do something that they can';t afford to do, then it';s not a good thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the Federal Government interested in pursuing legally Pixie Skase if she returns to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is something that ultimately the official, I think you still call him the official receiver in bankruptcy, would have to take a decision on because there are legal ramifications of any such decision, it';s not immediately in my writ, within my province to take such a decision but generally speaking I';m in favour of those Australians who suffered at the hands of her late husband being recompensed to the maximum extend possible consistent with not sending good money after bad. That';s my position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Philip Nitschke, have you had any concerns about the latest (inaudible) involves the death of a healthy person?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do I have any concerns about what?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Philip Nitschke, the…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I know who he is, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The latest case apparently involves the death of a healthy person.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have a very strong view that we should not be encouraging healthy people to take their lives, not matter what age they are.  I';m appalled to think that we may have reached a situation in this country where any aid or assistance or encouragement is given to a healthy person, as quite apart from who';s ill and I have quite strong views about euthanasia generally, I voted against euthanasia when it came before the Federal Parliament. I speak as an individual because this is not a matter of Liberal Party policy, it';s a matter of personal conscience, I think we should encourage the preservation of life and the respect for life and certainly the preservation and respect for life that is being lives in health, very much so and I condemn and depreciate in the strongest possible terms anything that allows or encourages people or encourages anybody to take their life, especially if they';re healthy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can you give any guidance on a timeframe for any T3?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>T3?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well firstly we';ve got to be satisfied that conditions in the bush are up to scratch, we';ve started to have a look at the Estens'; report and when we';ve finished that we';ll indicate what our judgement is.  Secondly we';ve got to get parliamentary authority and thirdly we';ve got to sell it at a price that maximises the return to the taxpayer.  I mean I wouldn';t sell right at the moment, even if I had parliamentary authority, because the share price is too low and it';s not in the interests of all you, you';re all taxpayers I assume, I hope.  And it wouldn';t be in your interests if I did that.  But there';s those three things, but in the end once you get conditions up to scratch in the bush, in the end, and it may take a while depending on the share price and soforth, in the end it is absurd for a company like that to remain half-pregnant, to be half owned by the Government and half-owned by the public, I mean it just (inaudible) it and in the end it';s just stupid.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This will do it I think.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just on the state election campaign, why do you think there hasn';t been much movement towards the Liberal Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you don';t, I mean you know that old saying about, I think a former Leader of the Liberal Party once said there';s only one poll that counts and he was right.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you give Mr Doyle [inaudible] chance on becoming Premier?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look you never make up your mind before the votes have been cast, a lot can happen over the last four days.  Look I repeat what I said earlier, if the polls published today are to be believed the Labor Party will win in a landslide, that will be a very bad outcome for this state, nobody wants a complacent, smug government with their pockets metaphorically speaking full of seats and a huge majority, it doesn';t help anybody, I';ve seen that, it induces complacency.  The best government at any level is a government that is pursued by its rivals, doesn';t feel it can take the electorate for granted.  And if the people of Victoria were to give Labor a landslide they can assume confidentially that they will be taken for granted, there will be complacency and the danger signs which I spoke earlier will proof to be quite prophetic.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
