I J,, AUSTRALIAL<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED 9.30 P. M.<br />
SPEECH1 BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MTIA DINNER 24 OCTOBER<br />
It was with great pleasure that I accepted your<br />
invitaton to join-you tonight.<br />
Your Association has for many years been a vigorous<br />
and influential voice on the issues of principal relevance<br />
to the economic management of this country.<br />
For a long time, and I notice Mr Dixon reiterated<br />
this this morning, you have stressed the need for a strong,<br />
viable and competitive manufacturing sector as being<br />
essential to the restoration of balanced and sustained<br />
economic growth. I agree.<br />
I also noticed that Mr Dixon identified a range of<br />
issues that are currently the subject of consultation<br />
between the MTIA and federal and state governments.<br />
These issues involved government purchasing,<br />
defence offsets, tariff phase-downs, imports from developing<br />
countries, the prevalence of dumping, anomalies in the CER<br />
Agreement with New Zealand, the question of non-tariff<br />
barriers and the influence of the exchange rate.<br />
MTIA' s views on these important issues have been<br />
appreciated and have been or are being taken into account in<br />
the Government's deliberations on these matters.<br />
Throughout, these consultations have been inspired<br />
by a common belief in the need for Government and industry<br />
to work together to ensure that the conditions necessary to<br />
the maintenance and development of Australian manufacturing<br />
industry are firmly established.<br />
In its fundamentals this means we all share an<br />
interest in securing the right conditions for durable<br />
economic recovery.<br />
My Govenment's economic and industry policies are<br />
directed to this end. </p>
<p>The Australian economy took a severe battering over<br />
1982 and into the early part of 1983.<br />
Inflation eroded our international competitiveness.<br />
Drought depressed rural incomes and the incomes of<br />
industries servicing the rural sector.<br />
World recession cut back export markets and saw<br />
reduced resource-based and related investment.*<br />
Cost increases were coupled with declining demand<br />
and business profitability-fell.<br />
High interest rates increased the cost of serviq; ing<br />
debt and discouraged investment.<br />
The manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit<br />
by these developments. Investment in the manufacturing sector fell 31 per<br />
cent during 1982-83 and is expected to continue to fall.<br />
Employment in manufacturing fell seven and a half<br />
per cent oVer the same period.<br />
Further, in 1982, manufacturing output declined * to<br />
historically low levels.<br />
The position since the end of 1982 has been rather<br />
mixed, though there are hopeful signs for the future.<br />
Output in manufacturing remains at a low level, but<br />
there is evidence that it may have begun to rise again over<br />
a significant proportion of the sector.<br />
Employment levels have fluctuated, but again there<br />
are definite signs of an upward trend in the economy as a<br />
whole. Inflation has moderated and average wages have<br />
changed little. Consumer spending has been weak though again most<br />
recent indicators suggest some improvement is underway.<br />
Business investment remains depressed, but housing<br />
starts have risen substantially, lending for housing has<br />
increased strongly and interest rates have dropped.<br />
You would all appreciate that it is notoriously<br />
difficult to predict turning points in an economic cycle. </p>
<p>It is now generally accepted nonetheless that<br />
economic activity, while patchy, has begun to pick up and is<br />
expected to recover strongly over the course of 1983-84.<br />
Strong pressure for growth over this period is<br />
coming from:<br />
The ending of the drought:<br />
indeed, prospects are for a record wheat harvest,<br />
which will contribute significantly to recovery in<br />
rural production, incomes and spending;<br />
? The faster pace of world economic activity, patticularly<br />
in the United States and the associated lift in demand<br />
for our exports and in the prices which we recei ve for<br />
them; The fact that business simply cannot indefinitely<br />
deplete inventories at the rates experienced recently;<br />
The steady increase in investor and consumer confidence<br />
since my Government assumed office.<br />
Tlie Economic Summit provided the broad-based<br />
community involvement necessary to ensure problems were<br />
properly identified and policy responses developed were<br />
appropriate to the needs of our society.<br />
Since then, in the May Economic Statement and in<br />
the 1983/ 84 Budget, my Government has provided controlled,<br />
responsible fiscal stimulus backed by anti-inflationary<br />
monetary and prices and incomes policies.<br />
We have placed a floor under domestic activity<br />
while private demand is weak.<br />
Our policies see Australia well placed to<br />
capitalise on the recovery now underway both internationally<br />
and domestically. On the forecasts presently available to the<br />
Government, economic growth is expected to strengthen<br />
progressively through the course of 1983-84 and to yield a<br />
rise in real non-farm~ production through the period in the<br />
order of 5 per cent.<br />
Employment is likely to respond more slowly,<br />
however. Initially most of the increased production is<br />
likely to be achieved by making fuller use of the time of<br />
existing workers and improved labour productivity, but<br />
employment growth is expected to accelerate as the year<br />
progresses to give a rise of one and a half per cent over<br />
the period as a whole. </p>
<p>The September employment figures bear out this<br />
expectation. Growth is occurring in the context of lower<br />
inflation than has been experienced over recent times.<br />
Indeed, reflecting the beneficial impact on the CPI<br />
of the introduction of medicare, wages may grow through the<br />
course of 1984 at rates not much different to those of our<br />
major trading partners.<br />
Such an. outcome is a good start to restoring<br />
However, it would not of itself be sufficient tq<br />
ensure a durable recovery.<br />
Australia's openness to the world's financial and<br />
trading markets enables us to participate in the benefits<br />
which flow from access to world-wide markets and the<br />
attendant gains from greater specialisation in production<br />
and exchange. We enjoy, as a consequence, higher real living<br />
standards 1 han would otherwise be within our reach.<br />
However, it also leaves us open, to some extent, to<br />
the world's economic cycle.<br />
The United States is in a strong recovery phase at<br />
present, having posted very rapid growth in its domestic<br />
production in each quarter of this year to date.<br />
other major economies including the United Kingdom,<br />
Germany and Japan have also picked up, albeit more slowly.<br />
Sentiment is firming that this is the beginning of<br />
a durable recovery in world activity levels, the major<br />
reservation being some concern about the potential level of<br />
world interest rates.<br />
Were the expected world recovery to falter, our own<br />
growth performance would necessarly be affected.<br />
The task which my Government has set itself is to<br />
maximise Australia's potential to participate in the world's<br />
economic recovery and to ensure that growth is sustained<br />
from within our economy and, most especially, from within<br />
the private sector of our economy as well as from external<br />
sources. While relevant to the immediate needs of the<br />
nation, therefore, our policies are also firmly set within a<br />
medium term context. </p>
<p>We eschew the discredited and simplistic ' fight<br />
inflation first' strategy of our predecessors.<br />
Yet we nonetheless realise that control of<br />
inflation is one of the factors vital to our long term<br />
recovery. Inflation abatement will help to preserve our<br />
international competitiveness, wind back inflationary<br />
expectations and moderate expenditure, thus discouraging<br />
pressures on interest rates.<br />
h ' errd-our etthrir'' ah .-e~ cydateq ji-. r~ td,* 7ltie<br />
are being administered fle-xibly, bearing-in muind the need-to<br />
support private sector activity while not accommodating<br />
avoidable inflationary pressures.<br />
Our overall stance is one directed at improving<br />
Australia's competitiveness over the medium and longer term.<br />
Short-term changes in international conditions may<br />
force fluctations in our competitiveness.<br />
Producers should take some comfort, however, from<br />
our commitment to continue fighting inflation and<br />
unemployment at the same time.<br />
This means we will avoid holding the exchange rate<br />
at artificially high levels.<br />
We aim to see monetary growth at a level consistent<br />
with ensuring that it is neither financing avoidable<br />
inflation, nor restraining feasible non-inflationary growth.<br />
These policies support, and in turn are supported<br />
by our prices and incomes policy.<br />
That policy, which has received wide support,<br />
underlines the need both for incomes restraint and for it to<br />
be exercised universally.<br />
The recent National Wage Case decision struck the<br />
necessary balance between short and longer term economic and<br />
industrial relations considerations.<br />
The Commission's firm stance is what is needed at<br />
this stage and the Government will continue to lend its<br />
weight to the task of ensuring compliance with its<br />
principles. The Government will not stand idly by in the face<br />
of some recent threats to this system. </p>
<p>The Government strongly believes that the new<br />
system of centralised wage fixation provides a firmer basis<br />
for a more rapid economic recovery without accelerating<br />
inflation than would b~ e possible under any alternative<br />
system. Your industry perhaps more than any other would<br />
well understand the potential economic vandalism inherent in<br />
the alternative philosophy, touted in some quarters, of<br />
allowing wages to be determined by the free play of market<br />
fo rc es.. The adv. antages of two years of-real wage stability<br />
and industrial peace -within the new system are so great that<br />
there is a real national interest involved in seeing the,<br />
system work. It is also our announced intention to curtail the<br />
current level of direct Government stimulus to the economy<br />
as private sector activity picks up.<br />
Not to do so would risk unnecessary competition for<br />
resources, especially on financial markets.<br />
OfC course, reducing that stimulus will not be easy.<br />
In our first Budget we nonetheless managed to cut<br />
more than half a billion dollars from the prospective<br />
deficit which we inherited.<br />
We did this while making some progress in<br />
reordering budgetary priorities, including measures to<br />
improve the welfare of the genuinely needy.<br />
In future Budgets we will continue to sustain, and,<br />
to the extent appropriate, extend that reordering.<br />
However, we will do so within the context of firm<br />
overall control over expenditure.<br />
An overriding major concern in this endeavour will<br />
be to achieve greater fairness and equity in our tax and<br />
welfare systems. We want to ensure that the benefits of economic<br />
growth and recovery are passed on equitably through the<br />
Austral ian community.<br />
A start was made in our last Budget and in the May<br />
Statement, including in respect of asset testing of<br />
pensions, revisions to housing assistance arrangements and<br />
lump sum superannuation payments. </p>
<p>For the most part the essentkial fairness of the<br />
proposed changes has been widely recognised, especially as<br />
the Government has indicated its willingness to consult with<br />
those affected and to, make such changes as might be<br />
necessary to remedy unintended side-effects.<br />
The basic fact facing social welfare policy-makers<br />
today is that if the Government is to raise significantly<br />
the general level of benefits to all who need them, then the<br />
special and unnecessary privileges of some must be reduced.<br />
Demographic trends underline this inescapable<br />
reality.-The number of Australian's dependent on a pension<br />
as a proportion of those in the work force is growing and<br />
going to continue growing fifty years from now the number<br />
of working age Australians for each person over 65 will drop<br />
to about three : approximately half the present number.<br />
Further the long-term and desirable trend is<br />
towards a more mobile labour force.<br />
These realities must be accommodated.<br />
They find a particular application in the present<br />
debate about lump-sum superannuation.<br />
My Government shares and would want to encourage<br />
the view that individuals should make provision for their<br />
retirement income.<br />
But the Government also strongly believes that<br />
remuneration in the form of a superannuation lump sum should<br />
be taxed on a * basis which is consistent with other forms of<br />
remuneration. There is no inconsistency in this.<br />
Unless this is done, others will have to bear<br />
greater burdens in order to ensure that essential revenue is<br />
maintained. There is nothing draconian about the measures we<br />
have taken. For the most part, tax is not paid when money goes<br />
into a superannuation fund nor is the investment income<br />
earned by the fund on such money taxed.<br />
Rather tax is deferred until the benefits are paid<br />
out of the fund. </p>
<p>This leaves larger amounts accurnulatinq in the fund<br />
and brings in larger amounts of fund earni ngs which<br />
ultimately emerge as larger benefits than can be obtained<br />
through other forms of1 saving.<br />
More specific recommendations by the Commonwealth<br />
task force on occupational superannuation are also receiving<br />
careful consideration. We have already acted to implement app'roved deposit<br />
funds as a means of facilitating preservation of<br />
superannuation entitlements and are looking at recommended<br />
improvements in-the'vestinig, preservation and portability of<br />
supe-rannuation benefits.<br />
We appreciate that further changes in this area<br />
could have a major impact on existing superannuation funds.<br />
It is important therefore that industry<br />
representatives as well as the ACTU play a major role as the<br />
Government explores possible options in this area.<br />
Mr Wills,<br />
Crucial to Australia's long-term economic outlook*<br />
must be the maintenance of an efficient, highly competitive<br />
manufacturing sector.<br />
My Government is'dedicated to establishing<br />
conditions that would see enhanced efficiency in Australian<br />
industry. Unless investment in industry is stepped up and<br />
productivity increased Australia's future economic prospects<br />
must be bleak.. The restoration of non-inflationary growth in the<br />
economy should materially improve the outlook for the<br />
manufacturing sector.<br />
This is particularly the case for the metals<br />
products group with its heavy dependence on investment and<br />
consumer durables demand.<br />
But although a revival in the general level of<br />
economic activity is obviously crucial to improved<br />
manufacturing performance, it will not by itself solve the<br />
sector's deep-seated problems.<br />
The achievement of increased competitiveness in the<br />
longer-term, and the associated enhancement of profitability<br />
and employment, will necessitate high levels of investment,<br />
the application of new technology to production processes,<br />
and an increasing export orientation, over large areas of<br />
manufacturing industry. </p>
<p>The effectiveness with which we apply new<br />
technology will deter-mine not only the efficiency of our<br />
industry, its competitive performance and its capacity to<br />
grow, but also whether we can reverse the deterioration in<br />
our living standards.<br />
While cyclical factors explain part of the<br />
manufacturing sector's current difficulties, a large<br />
component is structural and reflects the entrenchment of low<br />
productivity and inappropriate production patterns in many<br />
industries.. For thjs: reason, t'he -d-evelopm-ent -and -appl. ication oEf<br />
new technology must-be embraced as one of our driving<br />
forces. 1 There is, whether we like it or not, no escaping<br />
the fact that innovation is essential to our nation's future<br />
well-being, not only in industries producing new products,<br />
* but also throughout established industries, such as the<br />
metals products group.<br />
Other countries, particularly in our own region,<br />
are actively seizing new technology opportunities.<br />
If we are to benefit fully from our location in<br />
this dynamic growth region, it is incumbent upon us to<br />
develop and adopt new technologies new products and<br />
processes. I<br />
There will undoubtedly be problems adjusting to the<br />
changes involved. Consultation with those affected will be necessary.<br />
Particular attention will have to be paid to their<br />
needs. But the long-term interests of all Australians<br />
dictates that we venture upon an adaptive course.<br />
We must pursue positive, forward-looking policies,<br />
rather than the negative, re-active ones that have so often<br />
characterised our response to the challenge of change in the<br />
past. My Gove rnment has announced specific measures to<br />
assist the development of new industries, including to<br />
remedy deficiencies in the availability of venture capital.<br />
The steel industry assistance package stands as a<br />
model for the manner in which it balances employment<br />
considerations with recognition of the need for workers and<br />
business in that industry to enhance its competitive<br />
position through investment and through applying advanced<br />
technologies. </p>
<p>f We have similarly announced the establishment of<br />
the car industry council which will look at ways of<br />
increasing the industry's efficiency and productivity with<br />
the aim of improving our competitiveness on both domestic<br />
and export markets.<br />
In summary, therefore, my Government's policies<br />
provide a coherent and comprehensive framework within which<br />
the Australian economy can go forward with confidence.<br />
There are very enc ouraging signs-of recovery in<br />
domestic economic activity, which these policies are<br />
des-igned to nurture,. strengthen-and broaden.-<br />
It will be for each of us, however, to accept ovir<br />
share of the responsibility to take Australia forward and to<br />
make the most, collectively, of the opportunities which are<br />
open to us. </p>
