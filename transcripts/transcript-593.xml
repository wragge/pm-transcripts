    <content><![CDATA[<p>I extend my sincere congratulations to the President, Councillors and citizens of the Romsey Shire.</p>
<p>The celebration of the 100th anniversary of your thriving district is a time for remembering the pioneers from whom we have gained so much but it is also a time for looking to a future which I am sure will be one of continued growth and prosperity.</p>
