PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF<br />
PRESIDENT ROH TAE WOO OF KOREA<br />
CANBERRA 8 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
Mr President,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It is with very great pleasure, Mr President, that we<br />
welcome you, your wife, and your distinguished party to<br />
Australia. This is only the second occasion on which Australia has<br />
received a visit from the President of the Republic of<br />
Korea. I note with pride, Mr President, that with the<br />
exception of your visit to New York to address the United<br />
Nations General Assembly last month, this is your first<br />
overseas visit as President.<br />
Coming as it does in our Bicentennial year a year of<br />
special celebration for all Australians this visit is an<br />
important symbol of the increasingly constructive and<br />
friendly relationship between Australia and Korea.<br />
And of course more specifically we see your visit as an<br />
opportunity to congratulate you in person, and through you<br />
all the people of the Republic of Korea, for the magnificent<br />
way in which you staged the Games of the 24th Olympiad.<br />
The success of the Games was due to the excellent facilities<br />
and organisational arrangements provided by Seoul and the<br />
other cities that staged Olympic events, and to the friendly<br />
welcome extended by Koreans to athletes and visitors from<br />
virtually every part of the globe.<br />
The Games brought the Republic of Korea and its people into<br />
the homes of millions of Australians.<br />
Korean athletes performed outstandingly well, winning a<br />
total of 33 medals. We congratulate you for that success.<br />
332-</p>
<p>one of the highlights of the Games, at least for<br />
Australians, was undoubtedly the extraordinarily keen<br />
competition between the Australian and Korean women's hockey<br />
players. I know, Mr President, that you were a spectator at<br />
the final, so you will appreciate the pride we feel at<br />
having won the gold medal.<br />
we are delighted to have in our company today many of the<br />
members of that women's hockey team, along with some of our<br />
other Olympic medallists : Grant Davies, Grahame Cheney,<br />
Brett Dutton, Wayne McCarney, Scott McGrory, Julie McDonald,<br />
Peter Foster and Kelvin Graham.<br />
Also here as our guests are four very special athletes<br />
Russell Short, Deahnne McIntyre, Mathew Pobjie and Judy<br />
Young, all from the Canberra district, who took part in the<br />
very successful Paralympics Games in Seoul. Our disabled<br />
Australian athletes showed a high level of courage, skill<br />
and perseverance of which we are proud.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Your successful hosting of the Olympic Games was the<br />
dramatic culmination of two important long term trends that<br />
have characterised the history of the Republic of Korea.<br />
Your successful economic reconstruction following the<br />
devastation of the Korean war laid the foundations for a<br />
rapid growth of national prosperity. And your more recent<br />
political reforms hold the promise of a steady growth<br />
towards democracy.<br />
Australia is deeply interested in and supportive of both<br />
these developments.<br />
Australia was at the forefront of efforts, through the<br />
United Nations, to defend the security and independence of.<br />
the people of the Republic of Korea, when they came under,-<br />
direct attack during the Korean war. AS you would have seen<br />
this morning at the Australian War Memorial, Mr President,<br />
we still honour the 339 Australians who gave their lives<br />
during that tragic war.<br />
That sacrifice reflects the extent of the stake we in<br />
Australia have in the encouragement of democratic<br />
development in your country.<br />
So we have followed with great interest, Mr President, the<br />
events that have taken place since your commitment of June<br />
1987 to revise your Constitution and to hold direct,<br />
presidential elections. We were encouraged by the amnesty<br />
you declared in February and the elections for the National<br />
Assembly held in April.<br />
We also welcome your three-faceted foreign policy which<br />
encourages peaceful reunification with North Korea, the<br />
establishment of relations with socialist countries and the<br />
consolidation of relations with your traditional democratic<br />
allies, including Australia. ~ 330-3 </p>
<p>All this suggests that a new page is opening in the<br />
political history of the Republic. In you, Mr President, we<br />
recognise a leader of courage and vision who has embarked on<br />
a difficult, but fundamentally important, task, We wish you<br />
well and we offer you our support and encouragement.<br />
Mr President,<br />
The recent growth in democracy and human rights in your<br />
country follows several decades of rapidly improving living<br />
standards within a growing economy.<br />
There is great cause for optimism that the processes which<br />
have led to the economic transformation of the Republic of<br />
Korea to an industrialised nation with a favourable balance<br />
of payments will continue. We hope, in particular, that<br />
economic links between our two countries will continue to<br />
grow and diversify to our mutual benefit.<br />
Australia and the Republic of Korea lie at the northern and<br />
the southern edges of the Pacific Rim the most<br />
economically dynamic region of the world.<br />
Total trade between us is worth nearly $ 3 billion and<br />
Australia and Korea are among each other's top ten trading<br />
partners. In different ways both of us are pursuing structural<br />
adjustment for the long term benefit of our respective<br />
economies and, in particular, through the creation of<br />
increased trade and economic opportunities. In this regard<br />
we would urge you to take up the challenge of agricultural<br />
reform and work towards a program of full agricultural<br />
market liberalisation.<br />
You will know, Mr President, that we have a special interest<br />
in the beef market, and in this regard the July announcement<br />
of a limited re-opening of your market was a step in the<br />
right direction. I hope you will be able to build on that<br />
progress. our interest in the relationship, and our confidence in its<br />
future, has prompted us to see what initiatives we can take<br />
to sustain and diversify it further.<br />
we have recently announced a trade and commercial<br />
dev; elopment program, aimed at diversifying Australian trade<br />
into Korea and maximising the opportunities for Australian<br />
firms to participate in trade, investment and industrial,<br />
scientific and technological co-operation. we also wish to<br />
encourage a greater Korean commercial interest in Australia.<br />
To stimulate business and tourist traffic further we have<br />
agreed to negotiate a Government-to-Government Air Services<br />
Agreement which will permit direct air links between Korea<br />
and Australia.<br />
3304~ </p>
<p>The growth and the prosperity of both our countries depend<br />
crucially on the maintenance and enhancement of -the<br />
multilateral trading system. It was pleasing to note Korean<br />
participation in a meeting of senior trade officials in<br />
Wellington in September as part of a regional consultative<br />
process I initiated in 1983.<br />
It is to be hoped the December mid-term Review of the<br />
Uruguay Round can lay the groundwork for a successful<br />
completion of the Round as well as achieving substantive<br />
progress and reform in areas such as agriculture.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Until recently, economic matters have tended to dominate our<br />
relationship. It is important to remember, however, that we<br />
also have much to offer each other in cultural, social and<br />
educational areas.<br />
For our part we would welcome further Parliamentary<br />
exchanges and visits by Korean academics and cultural<br />
groups. In our talks on Monday we agreed to a Forum symposium on<br />
Australia-Korea relations, with the objective of stimulating<br />
some creative thinking on how the relationship might be<br />
developed. An important further step to broaden and<br />
strengthen the relationship was taken when our Foreign<br />
Ministers Senator Evans and Mr Choi signed a memorandum of<br />
Understanding on Science and Technology which will provide a<br />
significant boost to our co-operation in these fields.<br />
We still have more to do to add content to the cultural<br />
agreement between Australia and Korea. In this regard, we<br />
warmly welcome your suggestion to convene a Joint Cultural<br />
Commission to discuss a forward plan of cultural activities,<br />
and expand the scope of existing cultural and academic<br />
exchanges. Mr President,<br />
The relationship between Australia and Korea is newly<br />
developed, and it still requires many dimensions before it<br />
reaches maturity. But we have come a long way in a short<br />
period of time, and my own visit to your country in 1984 and<br />
your visit here at this time have done much, and will do<br />
much, to increase mutual understanding and identify the<br />
whole agenda of common interests that we share.<br />
Let me wish you a successful and fruitful time for the<br />
remainder of your current tour, and further progressive<br />
achievements during your Presidency. </p>
