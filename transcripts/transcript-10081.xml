    <content><![CDATA[<p>.<br />
22 August 1996 </p>
<p>JRNLST:<br />
Prime Minister Kim Beazley tonight is describing the Budget as the first chapter in a new story of an unfair Australia. What's your response to that? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A litany of negatives is no substitute for an alternative economic plan. There was not one<br />
positive word, not one positive thought, not one alternative idea. I say to Mr Beazley<br />
don't imagine you can rely on negatives. The Australian public is fed up with that.<br />
You've got to present an alternative and you didn't tonight.<br />
JRNLST:<br />
He has confirmed however that the Opposition at least will in the Senate be blocking,<br />
moving to block things like the increased HIECS charges and the nursing home fees. Is<br />
that of concern to the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It ought to be of concern to the Opposition because the Labor Party introduced I-EGS and<br />
our nursing home changes are exactly the same as the hostel changes introduced by the<br />
Labor Government in 1988. So it's an exercise in hypocrisy for the Labor Party to oppose<br />
either of those measures. </p>
<p>JRNLST:<br />
How much damage can the Senate do to the Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's not a question of damaging the budget. It's damaging the future of Australia. The<br />
best outcome for Australia is the quick passage of the whole of the budget. That is more<br />
likely than any other result to deliver lower interest rates and every time you hack away at<br />
a budget, you're hacking away at the lower interest rate future that Australia could have.<br />
JRNLST: How quickly could Australians be enjoying the possibility of lower interest rates as a result<br />
of the budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The possibility of them as soon as the budget is passed. When that possibility becomes a<br />
reality depends on a number of things over which we don't have control. There's no<br />
doubt in the world that if this budget goes through unimpaired, quickly, that more than<br />
any other outcome is likely to produce lower interest rates. Thank you.<br />
