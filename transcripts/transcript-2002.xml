FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 21/ 1969<br />
ACQUISITION OF WILLIAM WESTALL DRAWINGS<br />
FOR NATIONAL LIBRARY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government has purchased from<br />
the Royal Commonwealth Society in London an important collection<br />
of 139 drawings and water colours by William Westall, the young<br />
landscape artist who accompanied Matthew Flinders on his<br />
circumnavigation of Australia in 1801-3. These pictures, depicting<br />
parts of the Australian coastline as it appeared before European<br />
settlement, will be housed in the National Library in Canberra.<br />
The Westall drawings and water colours have long<br />
been well and favourably known to scholars. They became even<br />
more widely known as a result of their reproduction in a large<br />
volume published by the Society in 1962.<br />
As well as being on view in the National Library,<br />
they may also be exhibited elsewhere in Australia during the<br />
Captain Cook Bi-centenary Celebrations next year.<br />
