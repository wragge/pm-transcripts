MEDIA FRIDAY, 19 MARCH 1982<br />
DAVID BARNETT, O. B. E.<br />
It is with regret that I announce the resignation<br />
of my Press Secretary, David Barnett, as from the<br />
end of this month.<br />
David was my first permanent staff member, joining<br />
me a few days after I became Leader of the Parliamentary<br />
Liberal Party in 1975.<br />
He has given me and the Government loyal and unstinting<br />
service. The position of Press Secretary has been<br />
extremely demanding and I am grateful for what he<br />
has done. I have greatly valued David's skills<br />
and dedication.<br />
I wish to record my sincere appreciation for his<br />
seven years of loyal service,' and I wish him every<br />
success for the future. o00----</p>
