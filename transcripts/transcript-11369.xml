<p>Prime Minister and Mr Burton Shipley; Helen Clark, the Leader of the</p>
<p> Opposition; to the members of the New Zealand Cabinet, other distinguished</p>
<p> guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Can I first of all, for myself and also my wife, Janette, thank you</p>
<p> Jenny and Burton for your very kind hospitality. We hadn't been</p>
<p> to Queenstown before. It's a lovely part of the world. I'm</p>
<p> not surprised that we ran into, it seemed to be hundreds of Australian</p>
<p> and English tourists. I felt on occasions as though I was engaging</p>
<p> in a bit of an election campaign. I was running into all these people,</p>
<p> particularly from Queensland. I really have enjoyed myself.</p>
<p>And can I also say that it's been an opportunity to do something</p>
<p> that I regard as very important and that is to take good care of this</p>
<p> very important and precious relationship. The great Dr Johnson counselled</p>
<p> us all to keep our friendships in good repair. And regular meetings</p>
<p> between the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand where we</p>
<p> talk in a friendly but open fashion are part of that process.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have a very rich and endearing history.</p>
<p> We have shared a lot of difficult and a lot of triumphant experiences</p>
<p> in the past. But it is not a relationship that should be seen in terms</p>
<p> of the past only, important and precious though that is. It's</p>
<p> also a relationship that has a contemporary relevance and also has</p>
<p> a great future. The contemporary relevance is particularly found in</p>
<p> many of our shared economic experiences. New Zealand, in many ways,</p>
<p> led a lot of countries, not only Australia, in her economic reforms</p>
<p> during the 1980s and the 1990s. You've had a broadly based goods</p>
<p> and services tax for more than 12 years. You have a level of labour</p>
<p> market deregulation which has greatly aided the economic development</p>
<p> of your country. And you've also been very courageous in the</p>
<p> dismantling of many of your protective barriers over the years.</p>
<p>Some of these things Australia has done also, others we have not done,</p>
<p> others we've done in a different way. But the important thing</p>
<p> is that we have a lot of shared economic experience and intelligence</p>
<p> in front of us and we can all learn by each other's experience.</p>
<p> I'm happy to say that the Australian economy at present is in</p>
<p> a very robust state and long may it continue. But like all careful</p>
<p> Prime Ministers I don't take that for granted and it needs some</p>
<p> tender work, further reform and continued good government, but that</p>
<p> belongs to another forum.</p>
<p>Can I say how much I share Mrs Shipley's commitment to broadening</p>
<p> the horizons of CER. CER has been a great success but that means that</p>
<p> we can look to broadening the horizons. And I also share very much</p>
<p> New Zealand's commitment to a new broadly based World Trade Organisation</p>
<p> round coming out of the APEC meeting.</p>
<p>I'm a great supporter of APEC because I believe in the end the</p>
<p> living standards of the people of the APEC countries will be more</p>
<p> likely enhanced if we can have freer trade within the grouping that</p>
<p> comprises APEC. And it is the only grouping that brings together the</p>
<p> countries of Asia, the countries of Australasia, the countries of</p>
<p> North America and some countries from South America. It's a unique</p>
<p> group. And its membership was enlarged at the last meeting and it</p>
<p> adds to its special quality. And Australia will certainly do everything</p>
<p> it can to ensure that the group receives renewed commitment out of</p>
<p> the meeting in New Zealand later this year. It is a particularly important</p>
<p> meeting.</p>
<p>Prime Minister you drew attention to the good-natured rivalries between</p>
<p> our two countries. I, of course, mentioned last night at the reception</p>
<p> at the High Commissioner's home the inspiration that I've</p>
<p> received from the third Bledisloe Cup game at the Sydney Football</p>
<p> Stadium last year when having seen that magnificent outcome I was</p>
<p> so inspired that I got on a plane the next morning, journeyed to Canberra</p>
<p> and advised the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament and call a</p>
<p> general election. But those humourous, good-natured rivalries are</p>
<p> part of a relationship that is deep. It's a relationship that</p>
<p> is mature. It's a relationship that is close but it's a</p>
<p> relationship that none of us should ever take for granted. And it's</p>
<p> made better by the fact that although we have a lot in common we have</p>
<p> our own distinctive identity and our own distinctive characteristics.</p>
<p> And it's very important to respect those on both sides of the</p>
<p> Tasman.</p>
<p>We have a number of debates about our future in Australia over the</p>
<p> next few months and a variety of views are being taken. And can I</p>
<p> simply say that whatever the outcome of the vote on the referendum</p>
<p> in November, the essential values and fabric of the Australian community</p>
<p> will remain unimpaired and untouched. The friendship between our two</p>
<p> countries will remain as close as it is now.</p>
<p>I'm reminded by how important the future is for us, the immediate</p>
<p> future, by the fact that over the next couple of years New Zealand</p>
<p> will host the APEC meeting. You will host the America's Cup.</p>
<p> We will have the Centenary of Federation. We'll have the Olympic</p>
<p> Games. We'll have the Darvos gathering in Melbourne in the year</p>
<p> 2000 and we'll have the CHOGM meeting in Canberra in the year</p>
<p> 2001. And all of that's going to take place in the space of two</p>
<p> or three years. And it's going to mean that there is a world</p>
<p> focus on both our countries. And it's an opportunity for us to</p>
<p> tell the world in our own particular styles what values we have in</p>
<p> common and what makes our two societies so attractive. The unpretentious</p>
<p> character of both New Zealand and Australian society, the relative</p>
<p> physical security, the peaceful and predictable political character</p>
<p> of our societies despite the heat that is properly generated in democratic</p>
<p> exchange. And the fact that both of us are trying in our different</p>
<p> ways to achieve, in a constructive and purposeful and well-intentioned</p>
<p> fashion, a better understanding between our indigenous people and</p>
<p> those who've come to our respective countries to make either</p>
<p> New Zealand or Australia their home.</p>
<p>I thank you most warmly, Jenny, for the personal courtesy and friendship</p>
<p> you've extended to me and to Janette, and to your husband Burton,</p>
<p> to the great hospitality of the New Zealand Government and the New</p>
<p> Zealand people. And long may that friendship which we so warmly toasted</p>
<p> a few moments ago, endure.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
