ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This week, Australians heard more good news about progress in<br />
our fight against inflation. The June quarter Consumer Price<br />
Index increase of 2.4% was the lowest June quarter increase<br />
for five years. The figure put Australia's inflation rate<br />
over the last financial year as measured by the CPI at 10.2%.<br />
This figure, of course, excludes the Medibank levy cost as health<br />
insurance has always been a family cost.<br />
our achievement in the inflation fight is considerable. It is<br />
certainly a far cry from the 16% and 17% levels of only 18<br />
months ago.<br />
I want to make one point clear. Inflation is not coming down<br />
because of magic wands of luck. It is coming down because of<br />
sound and well-based economic policies and responsible economic<br />
management. The gains were won because of our absolute determnination<br />
to win despite strong and persistent pressure to return to<br />
the disastrous ploy of more Government spending to aid one group<br />
or another.<br />
The Federal Government will not take our gains so far for granted.<br />
We will not rest on laurels. Our determination to reduce<br />
Australia's inflation rate below that of our overseas trading<br />
partners is as strong as ever. We will continue with policies<br />
that will keep grinding down inflation.<br />
It is worth making the particular point that our success so far<br />
in this fight has been due in large part to our last budget.<br />
It is absolutely clear that my Government's first budget was<br />
the right budget. The strategy was right. Government expenditures<br />
were largely held within budget estimates for the first<br />
time in some years. The deficit was substantially reduced. The<br />
growth in the money supply was held on target. Investment<br />
increased and mostC importantly, the economy began to grow again.<br />
It is too easy to forget that only two years ago the Australian<br />
economy actually shrank. I<br />
In just over a couple of weeks, the Treasurer will present the<br />
Government's second budget. The Government is aware that it<br />
comes in a critical point of our planned economic recovery.<br />
We are aware of the responsibility we carry. / In the </p>
<p>-2<br />
In the last week, Cabinet has completed what I believe<br />
has probably been the most exhaustive examination of<br />
Government expenditure ever undertaken in framing a<br />
Federal budget in Australia. We have put the microscope<br />
over every area of Government expenditure. We have left<br />
no dollar-of taxpayers funds unturned. I am pleased with<br />
the results. I believe the Cabinet is on the way to framing<br />
a realistic budget that will keep Australia continuing on<br />
the path to full economic recovery. It will keep our antiinflation<br />
attack on course.<br />
Let no one be under any misapprehension that we are fighting<br />
inflation simply to boast about trends and figures. We are<br />
fighting-a real disease a disease that destroys the very<br />
fabric of family life and builds divisions in the community<br />
that take years to heal. Inflation is not about facts and<br />
figures -it is about families.<br />
While the Government can do a great deal in this fight, there<br />
is one area where--our influence is indirect wages. It is<br />
clear that our inflation fight is being hampered by overpriced<br />
labour costs.<br />
one set of figures graphically illustrates the point. Based<br />
on ruling exchange rates at the time, average weekly earnings<br />
in Australia in 1971 were 17% lower than in the United States.<br />
Now, they are 13% higher -in Australia than in the United<br />
States.<br />
. A recent survey has shown that two-thirds of companies<br />
. wholly-or partially absorbed the last two wage rises without<br />
increasing prices, but that half-of these companies did so<br />
by reducing their number of employees. one man's wage<br />
increase is -without doubt -Another man's job. </p>
