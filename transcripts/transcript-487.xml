ATOMIC E!, TfRGY ESTABLISI-EiLNT, LUCAS HEIGHo<br />
QRD MARH, 1 962<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Professor Baxter, and colleagues, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
Those of you who have suffered under me before in the<br />
opening of something will knor that I have now developed the<br />
almost perfect technique: I open the building, or the buildings,<br />
first, and then talk afterwards, on the sound principle that if I<br />
talk first I may well forget to open the building at the fihish.<br />
Today I am opening two buildings. This building, the<br />
Reactor Physics Building and the Radiation, Biology, Healthy<br />
Physics Building a complex of names which, of course, are selfexplanatory<br />
to laymen like me and perhaps to some of you.<br />
Behind me is a low power reactor called " Moata". All I<br />
know about this name is that it is an aboriginal name, stolen<br />
from the indigenous inhabitants of' the country, which originally<br />
meant " fire sticks". I am bound to say that if any of our<br />
forefathers of the aboriginal races had been told fire sticks of<br />
this kind would some day be put on the ancient hunting ground<br />
there would have been tremendous incredulity and, perhaps, some<br />
form of trouble. But here we are.<br />
As we drove in here today I remembered, because I had<br />
been told, that in 1955 this vas just scrub and sandstone<br />
outcrops. What has been done in the course of something under 7<br />
years is, I think, remarkable; and my colleagues of the Treasury<br />
think that it is even more remarkable because its capital cost has<br />
been Å“ llm. Its operating expenses I hesitate to refer to because<br />
we haven't yet reached the Budget and the preparation of the<br />
estimates. But I have gathered that it is fairly substantial.<br />
And really what I am doing this afternoon is not only to occupy<br />
your time for a few minutes, but to put in a bit of a plug with<br />
the Treasury you will understand, ther. ifore, if I appear to be<br />
a little expansive on the subject of Lucas Heights.<br />
This place, taking it as a whole, one element of which,<br />
the principal Hifar Reactor, I opened Ithink in 1958 and another,<br />
the Engineering Building in 1960, and this one in 192, this<br />
remarkable enterprise is, I believe, essentially a gathering<br />
together not only of bricks and mortar, but of very high class<br />
scientific manpower. And when I say manpower, of course, I rely<br />
on the Acts Interpretation Act tuhich says that man includes woman,<br />
the ridiculous proposition which only the Parliamentary draftsmen<br />
could seriously believe.<br />
Now, Sir, a great research establishrant like this has<br />
very many aspects. First of all, research is being conducted here<br />
into a variety of aspects of reactor systems avoiding duplication<br />
I emphasise that and thus, by avoiding duplication, but by<br />
doing first-class rork, adding to the sum total of scientific<br />
knowledge in the wvorld. I said I emphasised avoiding<br />
duplication because I know tat there are many people I hope a<br />
diminishing number who look at an enterprise of this kind and<br />
who say, " Well, what arc they doing here that can't be better done<br />
elsewhere? Is this just a matter of prestige?" And the answer to<br />
that is that it is not, in any rctal sense, a mere matter of<br />
prestige. Iork is being done here which is not being done in<br />
other places; and the people who are engaged here in this . Tork<br />
involving such skill and knowledge that it is beyond the<br />
comprehension of most of us, including mo, are adding to the total<br />
sun of scientific knoeledge in this field in the world. Now I've<br />
said that, and I've repeated it_, and I emphasise it, because,<br />
after all, the people of Australia are the people who provide the<br />
means for doing these things, and tne people of Australia are<br />
ontitled to know that -, hat is being done Is of genuine and<br />
cumulative significance. </p>
<p>In the second place what is being done here involves the<br />
training of Australian scientists and of course we haven't an<br />
unlimited supply of scientists in Australia. I don't suppose any<br />
country has an unlimited supply of scientists. But as the world<br />
goes on pell mell, particularly in the last decade, or the last<br />
years, it becomes increasingly important that we in Australia,<br />
possessing great native talent in these fields should produce the<br />
highest possible quality of scientific manpower, and do it to the<br />
highest possible level, and do it to as great a numerical extent<br />
as we can. This is one of the great tests of national progress,<br />
and of the advance of world knowledge.<br />
Now by training scientists here we do two things. I say<br />
this to the lay people, if any, who are here today. First of all<br />
it assists our own capacity to contribute to world knowledge. I<br />
have mentioned that. I repeat it. It assists our capacity to<br />
make a contribution which is significant and which will be, in<br />
many ways, original. And in the second place, not being entirely<br />
unselfish on this matter, it assists our capacity to take full<br />
advantage of work done elsewhere in the world. Because what is<br />
going on in other countries may mean very little to the<br />
uninstructed; but it will mean a very great deal to people of<br />
high scientific attainments in this field right here in<br />
Australia. Therefore we have this both ways. We contribute and we<br />
gain. And in order to contribute, and in order to gain, we must<br />
set our marks high and achieve the highest possible standard of<br />
efficiency, of understanding, of research, of application.<br />
Then, Sir, of course, there is another aspect of this<br />
matter. We want to attain in Australia standards of scientific<br />
skill which will do two other things. First, to facilitate<br />
exchanges with similar bodies overseas. This is an old problem<br />
as to whether people should go from Australia to other countries,<br />
as to whether people from other countries should come here.<br />
There are people, I'm sure, still living who believe that<br />
whatever we do we ought to huddle our garments about us, and keep<br />
it to ourselves and show how clever we are. But of course there<br />
can be no major advances in this field unless our people, trained<br />
and working here are able to go to other countries with<br />
intelligent and educated minds in this field, able to find the<br />
best that is going on; and unless we can at the same time attract<br />
to this place men of great consequence in these fields from other<br />
countries. It is the fluidity of scientific knowledge in the<br />
world which is at the very heart of developing the sum total of<br />
scientific knowledge in the world.<br />
Then, of course, I must say to those among you, if there<br />
are such, who have what people are pleased to call hard,<br />
practical minds, that every now and then there is what I would<br />
call in an entirely unscientific way, a by-product of the work<br />
that is being done here. Research, yes, above all; but, in the<br />
course of this research I was just discussing it at lunch time<br />
discoveries are made of immense utility, such as the discovery of<br />
new techniques for welding stainless steel. I won't go into that<br />
story but it is fascinating to me to discover that in the very<br />
course of experimental work here problems crop up by the way in<br />
the use of materials which require a solution. The solution<br />
being found turns out to be of general application in many other<br />
fields of industry.<br />
I hesitate to commit ryself to the proposition that a<br />
radio-active isotope is a by-product I don't suppose it is.<br />
But I do know, as you know, increasingly, that the production of<br />
radio-active isotopes here has opened up a new field in Australia<br />
for agricultural research, for medical research. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Indeed it isn't long ago, before the election I assure you, that<br />
I went to Newcastle and at that time I was received with every<br />
outward sign of friendliness for all I know it still continues,<br />
though a little muted, perhaps, by events and I was told there<br />
and then by people actively concerned with the development of<br />
Newcastle that the use of radio isotopes from here in the<br />
investigation of the movements of silt in the lower reaches<br />
particularly, of the Hunter River had turned out to be of enormous<br />
practical advantage.<br />
On top of that, let me once more say to those who think<br />
we may be duplicating work, that I am credibly informed by the<br />
technical members of the Commission and to them I make my bow<br />
that there are types of radioactive isotopes which don't carry,<br />
which have an early period of radioactive decay and therefore<br />
can't usefully be imported. But if they are produced here then<br />
they have a longer period of life, they have an immediate<br />
application to the job in hand.<br />
One matter that has been mentioned to me is that Cobalt<br />
as I will, in my ignorance, call it, is being used at a great<br />
city hospital in Sydney in the treatment of cancer. Now all these<br />
things are not the main end result, but they are fascinating<br />
incidental results in a great piece of research of this kind.<br />
The only other thing that perhaps I ought to say to you<br />
is this. There are many people, indeed there must be many<br />
hundreds of millions of people in the world who, if you say<br />
nuclear power think at once of nuclear weapons, of the great,<br />
pressing, anguishing problems of nuclear military power in the<br />
world and are therefore a little bit inclined to say about the<br />
nuclear physicists " A curse on you. You have brought nothing to<br />
the world except the threat of imminent disaster". That is<br />
because, of course, what is best advertised tends to be more<br />
popularly understood. Here today we have a magnificent<br />
opportunity of being reminded that the work being done in this<br />
field is not primarily work designed to destroy people, but is<br />
work designed to uncover a new source of advantage for the human<br />
race. We are all familiar with the phrase that was, I think,<br />
used by President Eisenhower about " atoms for peace". But you<br />
look at our own country. It is quite true that there are many<br />
parts of Australia where vast supplies of coal make the problem of<br />
power production technically simple, though it nay be,<br />
occasionally, financially difficult; there are great enterprises<br />
of hydro-electric power both on the mainland and in Tasmania.<br />
But there will come a time as the population of this country<br />
increases, as new resources are uncovered in remote parts of this<br />
country, when nuclear power will become as much the servant of<br />
peaceful enterprise as thermal power or hydro-electric power.<br />
Indeed I am told by those who understand these matters that it may<br />
well be that in parts of Australia remote from coal, or water, in<br />
an appropriate position, nuclear power may become quite<br />
competitive by the early years of the next decade, by the early<br />
1970' s. It doesn't end there. The other day I was reading a book<br />
which the President of the United States was good enough to send<br />
to me containing a series of stateLionts made by him during the<br />
first 12 months of his office. I was veiy interested to find that<br />
one of them related to what had to be done, and no d-; ubt very<br />
largely by the use of nuclear power, in experimental work on<br />
taking the salt out of water. Think of what this could mean to<br />
Australia; think of what this could mean to a continent whose<br />
greatest problem is water, having regarc to its area and to the<br />
distribution of its population. </p>
<p>The other day my friend Dr. Raggatt, under the guise of<br />
proposing a vote of thanks to somebody, made the principal speech<br />
of the evening. I am familiar with this technique it happens to<br />
me regularly at almost every political meeting I have. But he<br />
did draw public attention to a matter with which some of you have<br />
been familiar, or at least interested, for a long time, or for<br />
some years now, the great problem of creating water storages, not<br />
by the painful and expensive processes of earth m-ving as we've<br />
known them in the past, but by the definitive use of nuclear<br />
explosions in order to create a suitable crater and a suitable<br />
holding means. Well, no doubt this is in its early days and<br />
there will be many blind walls of ignorance to get through before<br />
it is ultimately achieved. But I mention it to you merely to<br />
indicate that we are only at the beginning of the peaceful<br />
developmental application of a means which today is too commonly<br />
regarded as merely an instrument of destruction.<br />
The day will come when we will have nuclear powered<br />
ships sailing into our harbours; the day may come, though<br />
Heaven forfend, when we will need to be infinitely better<br />
informed than we are now about protecting people against fall-out.<br />
And one of the buildings that I am opening today has, as its<br />
special function, or one of its special functions, to study this<br />
matter. Then, of course, on top of all that, in an international<br />
sense we will receive, or continue to receive, into this<br />
enterprise students from South-East Asia, people who cone here<br />
either under the Colombo Plan, or, as I believe increasingly,<br />
under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency.<br />
This is something tremendously exciting, I feel it myself; I<br />
hope that everybody will feel it. This is not just like opening<br />
a factory. This is not just like opening something which will<br />
apply known means to achieve a prodeterminod result. This is one<br />
of the great exploratory exer:' cises in the history of our country<br />
into powers as yet a little known which will some day be<br />
imr. oasurably better known. And the better known they are I<br />
believe the better it will be for ordinary mankind.<br />
So, Sir, these two buildings today, coming on top of<br />
what has been done here before add up to a new adventure, an<br />
exciting adventure, and, as I believe I may say, a highly<br />
practical adventure. They will, I believe Sir, serve to correct<br />
the widely held impression that nuclear power is an instrume. nt of<br />
destruction. They will, as they go on, persuade more and more<br />
people to realise that what we are dealing with today is an<br />
instrument of human development ultimately to operate for great<br />
huan happiness. Sir, I have a very great pleasure indeed in declaring<br />
these two buildings open. ( Applause) </p>
