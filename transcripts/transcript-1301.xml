PRIE } I INIS' 7 Ii'S TOUR Of SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Final<br />
Press Ccnferencegiven by the Prime Minister,...<br />
Mr. Harold Holt in Bangkok, Thailand 26TH APRIL, 1966<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this gathering had actually been<br />
arranged when it was thought I would not be having any<br />
discussions with you at the airport on my arrival, but we did<br />
have, as you will recall, a short interview there, and perhaps<br />
what I should do today is just give you a brief account of what<br />
has been covered today and then give you an opportunity to ask<br />
me anything you like about these activities.<br />
We shall not have a great deal of time together as you<br />
will have already gathered, as my Australian colleagues with the<br />
press have discovered, there has not been very many time slots<br />
left on the programme for me by those who have made the<br />
arrangements. , Je find that toaay has been another , ery crowded one.<br />
This morning I was able to return the visit to the<br />
Prime Minister and to meet him and his colleagues in the Cabinet.<br />
You may remember that when he was in Australia he and<br />
two of his senior ministerial colloagues had discussions with us<br />
in the Cabinet Room at Canberra and I regard it as a very fortunate<br />
development that so soon after our talks there, after an<br />
interval in which very important developments have occurred in<br />
this region of the world, and following so closely on my own visit<br />
to South Vietnam and other visits by Ministers here to other<br />
countries in the region, we have been able to have a very<br />
inforiatie and, I think I can claim, mutually valuable exchange<br />
of views. Following those talks our Ambassador here, ir. Loomes<br />
had a working lunch at which I was able to meet several of the<br />
senior diplomatic representatives from the United Kingdom, the<br />
United States and New Zealand together with many of our ovm<br />
senior officials and that providud a useful opportunity for<br />
further talks. After lunch we made the journey by heli-copter to His<br />
Majesty's -palace wihere we had the aavantage of a very interesting<br />
talk with the king.<br />
He asked me to convey his greetings and good wishes to<br />
the people of Australia and expressed his appreciation for the<br />
co-operation which we have developed between our two countries.<br />
Tonight I am to be entertained to dinner by the Prime<br />
Minister and this will round. off for me what has been a very<br />
pleasant and I think quite valuable visit to Thailand.<br />
Tomorrow morning we leave for Kuala Lumpur to begin<br />
another phase of my tour of those areas of South-East Asia in<br />
which Australian troops arc stationed.<br />
QUESTION: vhat impression have you formed regarding Thailand's<br />
security position in relation to the Coniunist insurgency in </p>
<p>the north-cast?<br />
MR. HOLT: ffell we did discuss thuse matters but I don't think that<br />
as a guest in the country it is for me to offer my assessments<br />
publicly of the local situation.<br />
I w., ould say that the Government is very sensitive to the<br />
danger and pressures which come froma Commnunist infiltration.<br />
They are aware of developments in various parts of the<br />
country and I gathered that the Government was capable of dealing<br />
effectively with them.<br />
Q. In the course of your discussions with the Thai<br />
Government was theD possibility raised of further strengthening<br />
under th(; aegis of SEATO a bigger Australian force in Thailand.<br />
12. HOLT: I don't know who has bccn conveying an impression that<br />
at any stage I referred to an enlarged Australian force, I think<br />
that if you will study the language of any comment I have made it<br />
does not give rise to that interpretation.<br />
I havc indicated the extent to which we have announced<br />
the contribution which we have announced in the various places.<br />
I haven't sought to enlarge on that or to enlarge our<br />
contribution.<br />
Q. It was reported in one of the papers this afternoon<br />
that you may send more troops to Thailand?<br />
MAR. HOLT: I don't know whure the report emanated but there is<br />
no foundation from any communt which I have made. </p>
