    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was sorry to learn of the death of the Hon Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, the former Federal Minister, diplomat and businessman.</p>
<p>Sir Robert took a hands-on approach to life and was a strong advocate of the role government can play in developing stronger communities.</p>
<p>His attitude to public policy reflected his experiences during the Depression and World War II.</p>
<p>After training as a RAAF pilot during World War II, Sir Robert and his family built successful regional business interests and established the pastoral property Carrington Park.</p>
<p> He was a foundation member of the Liberal Party and in the first chapter of his political life he ran against the then prime minister Ben Chifley. He later held a range of senior positions in the Liberal Party, including federal vice-president.</p>
<p>Bob Cotton and I had a close personal association during our long years as fellow members of the Liberal Party. He was president of the NSW Division of the Party when I joined in the 1950s. His calm authority and immense personal charm provided strong leadership to the Party organisation.</p>
<p>I greatly valued his advice and counsel during various stages of my own parliamentary career.</p>
<p> He typified those who enter public life with the view to bettering the nation.</p>
<p>Sir Robert entered the Senate in 1966. He was appointed Minister for Civil Aviation in the Gorton and McMahon Governments, and in the Fraser Government served as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>On retirement from representative political life in 1978 he was made a Knight Commander of St Michael and St George for his services to government. That year he was appointed consul-general to New York, with his business background and enthusiasm helping to boost Australia's profile among financial and investment houses in the US.</p>
<p> Sir Robert served as director on the Reserve Bank Board before being appointed Australia's Ambassador to the United States in 1982. It is noteworthy that although he was appointed by the Fraser Government, he was kept on as Ambassador by the incoming Hawke Government in 1983.</p>
<p> He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1993.</p>
<p> Bob Cotton had a long and fulfilling life, supported always by a close and loving family.</p>
<p>On behalf of Janette and myself, the Australian Government and all members of the Liberal Party of Australia, I extend my deepest sympathies to Sir Robert's family on their sad loss.</p>
