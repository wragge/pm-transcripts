STATEMENT BY THE RT. HON. J. McEWEN, DEPUTY PRIME INISTER<br />
AND MINISTER FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY, ON HIS RETURN<br />
FROM OVERSEAS ON 26TH MAY, 1967.<br />
1. KENNEDY ROUND GENERAL<br />
The Kennedy Round started as a proposal that practically<br />
all world tariffs of the GATT countries should be cut in half.<br />
Very early, less developed countries were excluded from this<br />
proposal. There is quite a wide range of trade in which countries<br />
deliberately ensure that they do not increase their cost of raw<br />
materials and food, by imposing import duties. Australia is a<br />
predominant exporter of these items. Therefore, under the original<br />
Kennedy Round proposal, Australia was invited to cut her protective<br />
tariffs in half but with no balancing tariff reductions on what<br />
she exported. You can't cut a nil tariff in two.<br />
In 1963 I visited the United Kingdom and told the British<br />
Government that Australia would prefer to continue its reciprocal<br />
Trade Agreement with Britain, to whom we have exported so much,<br />
rather than go into the Kennedy Round with all its doubt and risks.<br />
The British Government intimated they had firmly decided<br />
to go into the Kennedy Round, and would offer a general 50% cut<br />
in practically all their tariffs.<br />
For the things we export to Britain, the Australia-United<br />
Kingdom Trade Treaty mostly gives us duty free entry, with an<br />
obligation on Britain to impose a tariff on our foreign competitors.<br />
For-this benefit we, in return, impose higher duties on Britain's<br />
competitors in our market. In 1965-66 90% of Britain's total<br />
exports of SA759 million to Australia benefited from these<br />
preferential tariff arrangements in our market.<br />
The British Government's position amounted to leaving<br />
Australia's right of free entry unaltered but to halve the tariff<br />
obstacle raised against our foreign competitors. </p>
<p>Upon this British declaration, Australia said she would<br />
enter the Kennedy Round discussions constructively, and examine at<br />
the end of the day, . wh ether there were sufficient benefits left<br />
for Australia in the British market, to justify a new trade treaty<br />
with Britain. That was the situation when we entered the Kennedy<br />
Round of negotiations. The next step in 1963 was for me to argue before the full<br />
assembly of the Kennedy Round countries, about 80, that it was<br />
unreasonable, and impossible, to ask a country circumstanced as<br />
Australia was, to cut all her protective tariffs by half, for the<br />
very doubtful prospect of being given advantages in the export of<br />
her primary products and raw materials.<br />
It was a very important part of the Australian case that<br />
because of the great variety of barriers other than tariffs to<br />
improved trade in agricultural products, and because of the ling<br />
history of unsuccessful negotiations to reduce or limit those<br />
barriers, agricultur2al exporting countries should only be expected<br />
to pay in tariff cuts, for overall advantages accorded their<br />
agri cultural trade.<br />
I intimated that if at the end of the day we had been<br />
given important new advantages for our commodity exports, we would<br />
give balancing advantages by appropriate tariff reductions to those<br />
who exported manufactured goods to us, This was accepted, and<br />
it is on that basis that since 1963 we have participated as a big<br />
importer and exporter in the Kennedy Round discussions.<br />
It wNas always made clear that Australia would not destroy<br />
its existing manufacturing industries by cutting their protective<br />
tariff in half. However because of the fact that Britain had<br />
offered to foreigners to cut our preferences in half, we would be<br />
entitled to pay in part for whatever advantages we gained, by some<br />
balancing diminution in the preferential advantages accorded to<br />
British exports in our market. </p>
<p>We also have a very wide range of imports of items<br />
which we do not manufacture but on which customs duties already<br />
exist. Many of these Customs duties are there for some<br />
historical reason of the past. On two occasions I have asked the<br />
Tariff Board to advise, whether, in respect of a very great range<br />
of items we could reduce duties without detriment to Australian<br />
industry. This advice of the Tariff Board has been available in<br />
the selection of items for which we have offered tariff reduotions.<br />
This sets out the general history and nature of Australia'w<br />
position in respect of the Kennedy Round from before negotiations<br />
commenced, our consultations at that pmint with Britain and right<br />
through to the near-final situation of today. </p>
<p>2. KENNEDY ROUND WHTEAT AND WHEAT AID<br />
Mr. MoEwen said: " The major achievement for Australian<br />
agriculture was the negotiation of the basic elements for a new<br />
international agreement of wheat."<br />
It is intended that the new Agreement reached in Geneva<br />
between the world's major grain exporters and importers should<br />
in due course, take the place of the existing International Wheat<br />
Agreement which has been " carried on" with a number of temporary<br />
extensions while the GATT negotiations have been going on in<br />
Geneva. The major objective of this new GATT agreement on grains<br />
is to put a floor under world wheat prices. This was a concept<br />
within the old International Wheat Agreement.<br />
However, the new Agreement will not only establish the<br />
floor at a higher level than under the but will establish<br />
a floor that is really firm, a floor below which prices do not fall.<br />
The old International Wheat Agreement has neve~ r been<br />
really effective on this major objective. That Agreement set the<br />
minimum price only for Manitoba No. 1 the highest quality wheat<br />
commercially traded. The great number of lower quality grades of<br />
wheat below Manitoba Nn. 1, were left without specific minimum prices,<br />
and without " agreed differentials" of price a very lmose, unfirm<br />
situation. The minimum or floor price that had been finally agreed<br />
in Geneva for a middle grade of American wheat known as Hard Red<br />
Winter No. 2 ( ordinary) wqs $ IJS1.73 per bushel the price being<br />
fixed on the basis of shipping from ports in the Gulf of Mexico.<br />
This is an increase of some 19 U. S. cents per bushel over the<br />
equivalent I. W. A. minimum for this grade of wheat.<br />
Around this central minimum -price for the " base" wheat,<br />
as it is known minimum prices for other wheats have been<br />
determined by establishing firm " differentials for quality" for<br />
wheats higher in quality and lower in quality than U. S. Hard </p>
<p>Winter Ordinary. In this way minimum prices have been arrived at for a<br />
number of the important wheats that are traded internationally<br />
and a schedule of minimum prices is set out in the agreement.<br />
This innovation of establishing a schedule of minimum prices for<br />
a number of wheats will help greatly in making the new floor<br />
price for wheat firm and effective.<br />
In Australia's case the minimum price for f. a. q. wheat<br />
has been set at 5 U. S. cents below the minimum price of the base<br />
wheat. This is accepted as a satisfactory margin.<br />
All the minimum prices are expressed in the Agreement<br />
f. o. b. Gulf of Mexico to put them on a comparable basis. It<br />
should be noted that they are not the c. i. f. prices which customer<br />
countries pay for their wheat delivered, nor are they selling,<br />
or offering prices at which wheat must be sold. They represent<br />
the prices below which wheat cannot be sold or bought.<br />
Mr. McEwen went on to say: " The new floor prices represent<br />
a substantial improvement on existing floor prices. The<br />
new floor price for f-a-q. wheat will not be high enough to<br />
cover the present Australian " cost of poutn" under the Wheat<br />
Stabilisation Plan while prices are at the minimum but actual<br />
selling prices of wheat will vary from time to time depending on<br />
supply and demand.<br />
" These prices may fluctuate above, but cannot fall below<br />
the new agreed minimum price of $ US 1 .73 at Gulf for U. S. Hard<br />
Winter Ordinary Wheat.<br />
" In the opinion of the experts from wheat exporting and<br />
wheat importing countries gathered at Geneva, the establishment of<br />
a new minimum at substantially higher levels than the old minimum<br />
would substantially lift " market" prices.<br />
" The opinions of these experts on the extent of the<br />
likely increase in market prices ranged from about 8 US. cents tn<br />
16 U. S. cents a bushel. On the basis of 300 million bushels of </p>
<p>6.<br />
exports from Australia, which we should be able to count on for<br />
our exports in the future, each additional cent increase in price,<br />
increases our export earnings by $ US 3 million a year. An 8 cent<br />
increase on 300 million bushels exported would increase our<br />
earnings by $ US 24 million and 16 cents by $ UJS 48 million.<br />
If one assumed that the increase would be between these<br />
two extremes, at 12 cents, Australia could look forward to increased<br />
export earnings of ZUS 36 million a year on such crops. This will<br />
be a net increase in the Wheat Board's sales.<br />
Another new and important feature of the Agreement<br />
negotiated in Geneva, is a commitment on member Governments, both<br />
exporters and importers, to provide developing countries with food<br />
aid equivalent to 4T1 million metric tons of grain a year. Australia's<br />
contribution to this new programme is 225,000 metric tons which<br />
compares with aid given by Australia in the form of wheat over the<br />
last 3 years at an average rate of approximately 150,000 a year.<br />
Mr. McEwen said: " The new food aid provisions in the<br />
Agreement are important in a number of ways. They are a recognition<br />
by the affluent countries of the great need to provide more food<br />
for the hungry people of the world. This is of enormous importance<br />
in a world in which millions of people are on the -erge of<br />
starfation, with consequent political instability.<br />
Moreover, the food aid provisions are a great step<br />
forward in winning acceptance of the principle that affluent<br />
countries as a whole, should share equitably the responsibility, and<br />
the cost of supplying food aid, and not leave food aid to those<br />
countries which produce wheat in surplus to their own iequirements.<br />
" I am sure that Australians everywhere will be pleased<br />
to see Australia doing its bit in this new programme for. feeding<br />
the hungry. I am personally very pleased also that the principle<br />
of joint responsibility for food aid, a principle which I have<br />
advocated for at least 10 years, is at last gaining recognition." </p>
<p>3. KENNEDY ROUND MEAT<br />
Australia had been negotiating on a number of other<br />
important primary products. Originally it was hoped that negotiations<br />
similar to those for grains, could be undertaken on both meat<br />
and dairy products. Negotiating groups similar to the Cereals<br />
negotiating group were set up for these other two commodities.<br />
It proved impossible to negotiate world arrangements<br />
for meat. However, Australia has meat arrangements with its two<br />
major markets, Britain and the United States.<br />
At Geneva we have been in intensive bi-laterial<br />
negotiations with both the European Common Market countries and<br />
Japan in an effort to improve trading opportunities in those tw')<br />
markets. A reasonably successful result for beef and veal with<br />
these two countries is expected.<br />
An arrangement is being discussed with the Common Market<br />
countries on beef that could allow Australian exports of frozen<br />
beef to have access to the E. E. C. markets with a modest customs<br />
duty, and without payment of import levies for a 5 month period<br />
from mid-April to mid-September. During the remaining 7 months<br />
of the year it is proposed that import levies lower than at present<br />
will be applied. Such an arrangement would be a-signi~ ficant<br />
break-through into the very large and affluent European market.<br />
Discussions have taken place also with Japan in the hope<br />
of securing improved access to that market. The results of thqdiscussions<br />
have been encouraging.<br />
If within the Kennedy Round we succeed in getting access<br />
improvements, permitting a steady expansion of Australian exports of<br />
frozen meat to these markets, this will provide the added safety of<br />
greater diversification of our meat markets. </p>
<p>4. KENNEDY ROUND WOOL, DAIRYING OUR GAINS AND OUR LOSSES<br />
Referring to negotiations on wool, Mr. McEwen said that<br />
he had entered the Kennedy Round confident that Australia would<br />
be able to negotiate a reduction in the duty which the United<br />
States maintains on imports of raw wool. The United States is<br />
the only country to have a substantial duty on raw wool and had<br />
indicated willingness to cut the duty in the course of the<br />
Kennedy Round. It was a matter of immense disappointment that at this<br />
stage Australia has not secured from the United States improved<br />
access to the American market for wool or for that matter, within<br />
these negotiations, improved access to America for any product<br />
of important trade interest to Australia.<br />
On dairy products, the Kennedy Round negotiations were not<br />
successful. This had been a great disappointment not only to<br />
Australia but also to New Zealand which is the largest exporter<br />
of dairy products.<br />
Mr. McEwen said: " The Agreement on cereals and the prospect<br />
of improved arrangements for beef prompt me to say that it is<br />
the wheat and beef industries that will gain most directly.<br />
" It is not just the farmers who will benefit from this..<br />
The benefits will flow to the whole community as a result of the<br />
higher earnings of foreign exchange, and greater spending power<br />
in the hands of the wheatgrowers and beef producers. To the<br />
extent that wheat prices rise, there is a reduction in the costs<br />
to the Commonwealth Treasury arising from the obligations under<br />
the Wheat Stabilisation Act, which guarantees that Australian<br />
wheatgrowers shall not receive a lower figure than the<br />
guaranteed price for 150 million bushels of wheat exported."<br />
" Australia will suffer losses as a result of the British<br />
decision to make a 50% cut in tariff items which had been designed<br />
to establish Australia's preferential position, under the U. K.-<br />
Australia Trade Treaty. </p>
<p>The list of products on which Britain originally proposed<br />
to make a 50% cut in the duty paid by foreign countries and<br />
hence at the same time reduce Australia's preferences in the<br />
United Kingdom, covered a great many items of Australia's export<br />
trade. Some of these offers have now been withdrawn. Amongst<br />
those which now stand to lose 50% of their preferences in Britain<br />
include raisins, sultanas and currants, canned peaches, canned<br />
apricots ( but not canned pears) and canned pineapples, unmilled<br />
rice and leather.<br />
The effect of the cut in preference is of great<br />
importance to the industries concerned.<br />
Looking at the negotiations overall, 4ustralia's gains<br />
will much more than offset her losses.<br />
When the Government is considering adverse effects on<br />
particular industries, from the cut in their Commonwealth<br />
preference arising from the Kennedy Round, the overall National<br />
gain will be weighed in relation to particular industry losses." </p>
<p>BRITISH APPLICATION TO JOIN COMJMON MARKET<br />
UNITED KINGDOM AUSTRALIA TRADE TREATY<br />
Mr. MoEwen said that his visit to Europe provided an<br />
opportunity to discuss matters of common interest with British<br />
Ministers. There was discussion related to the Kennedy Round<br />
which was approaching the criticial negotiating -period at that time.<br />
At the time of Mr.. McEwen's visit, British Ministers<br />
were considering whether to apply to join the European Common<br />
Market, and this topic was discussed.<br />
Australia's attitude to British entry of the European<br />
Common Market is the same as it has always been. The decision<br />
to apply for membership is one for Britain alone. The British<br />
Prime Minister has said that safeguarding essential Commonwealth<br />
interests is an essential prerequisite to British entry and has<br />
promised also to consult fully with Commonwealth countries during<br />
the negotiations for British entry.<br />
Australia's trade relationship with Britain is based<br />
on a contract, the United Kingdom-Australia Trade Agreement. As a<br />
result of that contract each country has built up a substantial<br />
trade interest in the other country.<br />
Britain's exports to Australia amounted to $ ZA759 mil. in<br />
1965-66 and about 90% of those imports receive preferential<br />
treatment in the Australian tariff. That is to say, about<br />
of British exports to Australia entered Auetralia at lower rates<br />
of duty than were charged on the same products from other countri., s.<br />
The Department of Trade and Industry has made a<br />
calculation of the value of the present Preferences the<br />
United Kingdom has in Australia, by comparing the United Kingdom<br />
share of the Australian import market, with the share the<br />
United Kingdom has of non-preferential markets such as the U. S. A.<br />
This comparison has been made on a farily detailed productby-<br />
product basis. The calculation suggests that if the United </p>
<p>11.<br />
Kingdom lost all its preference in Australia on entering the<br />
European Common Market then it could, in the long term, lose<br />
about $ A400 million of its trade with Australia.<br />
This kind of figuring makes it pretty plain that Britain<br />
has a very big stake in the Australian market.<br />
Australia also has a very big stake in the British<br />
market. The view is widely held in Europe that because Australia<br />
has diversified its trade so much in recent years, the effects of<br />
British entry will be very much less than they would have been in<br />
1961. It is quite true th-at Australia has diversified its trade<br />
but in spite of this the value of our trade " at risk" if Britain<br />
enters the E. E. C. has actually increased in total since 1961.<br />
Since 1961 Australia's exports of wool to Britain have declined<br />
markedly. Wool is one commodity which would almost certainly be<br />
unaffected by British entry, but it is now relatively less important<br />
in our trade with Britain.<br />
The value of our trade " at risk" has increased from<br />
$ A 310 million in 1959-60 to about 3$ A 375 million now. Nor is it<br />
much comfort to the dairy industry faced with the loss of<br />
important preferences in the United Kingdom, to know that Australia's<br />
sales of iron ore to Japan have increased.<br />
The threat to Australia's trade, if Britain enters the<br />
European Common Market does not come only from the loss of<br />
preferences on our important export commodities. It comes also<br />
from the " reverse preferences" that will be created against<br />
Australia when Britain enters the E. E. C. A product such as<br />
dried fruit, not only faces the loss of important preference in<br />
the British market, it also sees the creation of a new Preference in<br />
favour of Greece and Turkey by reason of their associate membership<br />
of the E. E. C. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Possibly an even greater threat than the loss of<br />
preference comes from the overall agricultural policies of the<br />
Common Market. Under many of the agricultural policies of the<br />
E. E. C. the European farmer is insulated from outside competition<br />
by a water-tight system of variable import levies on agricultural<br />
imports. The Common Agricultural Policy, of the E. E. C. provides<br />
very high internal supports, and with the water-tight import<br />
protection E. E. C. agricultural production has increased enormously.<br />
From being a net importer of wheat a few years ago the<br />
E. E. C. has now become a net exporter. Large surpluses of butter<br />
exist in Europe. Meat production has increased rapidly. We<br />
know that agricultural production in the E. E. C. has further<br />
potential to increase, and that if Britain joined, the agricultural<br />
policies of the applied to British agriculture, could<br />
expand production considerably to fill a large part of their<br />
existing import market.<br />
Mr. McEwen said: " These were the kind of issues that I<br />
discussed with British Ministers in the course of a very frank<br />
exchange of views."<br />
Mr. McEwen also said that now that the shape of the<br />
final Kennedy Round package was becoming clear, Britain and<br />
Australia would shortly be holding talks to discuss the<br />
future of the United Kingdom/ Australia Trade Agreement. Mr.<br />
MoEwen recalled that review of the Agreement had been deferred<br />
pending the completion of the Kennedy Round negotiations. </p>
<p>13.<br />
6. TRADE TREATY SIGNED WITH ROUMANIA<br />
Mr. McEwen said that from Geneva he went to Bucharest<br />
to conclude a trade agreement with Roumania.<br />
Czechoslovakia alone of the countries of Eastern<br />
Europe is a member of the GATT. Many Western countries have in<br />
recent years negotiated Trade AgreemenTs with the countries of<br />
Eastern Europe in order to provide a formal basis for trading<br />
with those countries.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that over the last two years Australia<br />
had written Trade Agreements with the Poland and<br />
Bulgaria in addition to Roumania. In all of these agreements the<br />
central provisions were a mutual undertaking by each country to<br />
extend to the other " most-favoured-nation" tariff treatment.<br />
In fact, Australia has extended " most-favourednation"<br />
tariff treatment to Roumania for many years. The<br />
Trade Agreement formalises and guarantees conditions of trading<br />
that already exist.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the new trading links that had<br />
been established between Australia and Roumania were designed<br />
to be mutually beneficial. Trade between the two countries had<br />
increased markedly over the last twelve months. Australian<br />
exports to Roumania totalled :' A433,000 in the first seven months<br />
of this financial year, mainly cattle hides, rutile concentrates<br />
and wool tops. Imports totalled A119,000 mainly specialty<br />
cheeses and wood and cork manufactures.<br />
The potential for increased trade clearly exists,<br />
given the assurance of established access conditions as provided<br />
in the new Agreement. </p>
