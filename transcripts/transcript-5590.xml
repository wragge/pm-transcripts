PRIME MINISTER'<br />
FOR MEDIAWEDNESDAY, 20 MAY, 1981<br />
DROUGHT AID TO THE STATES<br />
I have written today to-all Premiers and to the Chief Minister<br />
of the Northern Territory about ways of improving the<br />
provision of assistance to-primary producers affected by<br />
prolonged drought.<br />
At the Premiers' Conference on 4 May I drew attention<br />
to the serious continuing drought situation and suggested<br />
there was a need for officers to meet and to discuss problems<br />
of drought assistance in a frank and open way leaving<br />
political considerations aside to be dealt with by Premiers<br />
and me.<br />
Premiers agreed to this approach.<br />
However, the outcome of a subsequent meeting of officers held<br />
in the context of an overall review of the natural disaster<br />
financial assistance arrangements, suggests that officers were<br />
constrained in their consideration of drought relief.<br />
I have therefore written to the Premiers, the Chief Minister<br />
and the relevant Commonwealth Ministers stressing the need for<br />
of ficers to develop proposals from first principles.<br />
I am particularly concerned about the burden of debt on many<br />
producers and the problem they will face in restocking when<br />
the drought finally breaks.<br />
We will be looking to officers to put definite proposals to<br />
the Conference to be held on 19 June.<br />
