FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 27/ 1969<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF FOR QUEENSLAND<br />
Statem ent by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
In view of the recurrence of drought conditions<br />
over a large area of Queensland, the Commonwealth is prepared<br />
to participate with the State, on a for basis, in the provision<br />
of finance for drought relief measures.<br />
These measures will include:-<br />
* Rail and road subsidies on the transport of fodder<br />
and the movement of livestock to agistment:<br />
* Carry-on finance for drought affected farmers<br />
who are unable to obtain credit from normal<br />
commercial sources:<br />
* Grants to local authorities in rural areas to relieve<br />
unemployment caused by drought.<br />
Details of the arrangements will be determined in<br />
the course of Commonwealth-State discussions to be held later<br />
this week.<br />
Background: The Commonwealth has already provided approximately<br />
$ 15-1 million to Queensland since 1965-66 as re-imbursement to<br />
that State for drought relief expenditure... and has also given<br />
additional amounts totalling approximately $ 5 million for special<br />
revenue assistance to offset the effects of drought on the State's<br />
Revenue. CA NBERRA<br />
