PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE lION P J<br />
KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AND DOORSTOP INT'ERVIlEW AT THE<br />
BUSHIRE OPERATIONS CENTRE, ROSEHILL, SYDNEY<br />
8 JANUARY, 1994<br />
PM: I think it is worth recording the fact that the fires have been fought<br />
notwithstanding thc loss of life we've had, and property, quite successfully over<br />
the last week, and particularly in the last 24 hours. Yesterday there was a<br />
reasonable expectation of many hundreds, maybe thousands of homes being lost,<br />
that not having happened, and now the weather conditions being the all important<br />
variable, and this day in particular being significant as some meteorological advice<br />
gives us the hope, as the premier said, that wc could have a shift in conditions by<br />
about six this evening. Now if that's the case, with damper air, thc containment<br />
task should be something which this force now deployed is capable of. Could 1<br />
just say from the Commonwealth's view we have as many Defence Force assets<br />
deployed here as needs be. We have got more standing in rcscrve. We've got<br />
anothcr five hundred people ready to be deployed if needs be, and that also goes<br />
for equipment. I think we havc got now about 25 helicopters committed. Wc arc<br />
reaching a point where Commissioner Koperbcrg's view is that if more aircraft are<br />
dcploycd there is a risk to the aircraft and to firefighters, and that we are fighting<br />
these fires conventionally, and conventionally has provcn to be the best way to<br />
fight them, augmented by aviation scrvlccs as. needs be.<br />
So I have indicated to the Premier this morning that for the firefighting task, which<br />
is outside the National Disaster Relicf Arrangcments, the NDRA arrangements,<br />
that is the actual task and cost of fighting such fires on such a large scale, the<br />
Commonwealth will mcct NSW dollar for dollar on thosc arrangements.<br />
I -L </p>

Also wc are this morning, the Commonwealth, the acting Minister for Social<br />
Security, John Faulkner, will be declaring undcr the Social Security Act the<br />
provision of emergency payments to families which are affected by the fires, with a<br />
one-off payment which was set sometime ago and we arc reviewing thc quantum<br />
of that paymcnt... at the moment it is $ 600. We will probably increase that, but It<br />
will have to be increased by a change retrospectively to an act of parliament. So<br />
that will be there to support those people who have been affected in the Immediate<br />
sense. Of course, the National Disaster Relief Arrangemcnts are there for the<br />
longer run re-instatement of infrastructure and other assets.<br />
So cAould I perhaps round up my remarks by congratulating the firefighting effort<br />
and task in NSW starting with the Government, the Premier, Minister Griffithl,<br />
Commissioner Kopcrberg his deputy, the fire Chiefs, and the normal services who<br />
have behaved in a way which is of course way above normal. And that was the fire<br />
brigade, the ambulance, the police and the defence force, but most particularly all<br />
those volunteers who have come and given their Christmas break to their fellow<br />
Australians to make this burden easier on them. To those, and to the thousands of<br />
people who were just simply helping, I think we all owe a great debt of gratitude.<br />
J: Are you going to inspect the damage?<br />
FM: Wc are &amp; oins to look at the fifes which are the ones probably the most<br />
threatcning at the moment. I have made clear though that neither I nor the Premier,<br />
nor any of the other Ministers here or officials involved would want to be taking<br />
aircraft which arc needed in the effort. But we have now aircraft which are surplus<br />
to the effort, and thcrcforc I think it is probably worth our while to have a look.<br />
J: With the cnd of the Cold War, do you think the defence forces should he more<br />
aimed towards civil emerencics?<br />
PM: The nature of the equipment of any conventional armed force will always<br />
havc some civil applications in circumstances such as thcsc, and it is the<br />
adaptability but more than that the willingness of the defence force to actually<br />
apply them effectively which matters. And I think that's what matters rather than<br />
the equipment selection or the rest, and that is that there will always be people<br />
there. And in this case, certainly from the Government's point of view, and that of<br />
my colleague the acting Defence Minister John Faulkner, we take the view that<br />
wherever the defence force effectively help, then It ought to. And I know that Is<br />
certainly the view of the chief of the Australian Defence Force, chief of general<br />
staff, and the general willingness of the dcfcnce force personnel to actually be<br />
involved, and to do it well and to do it quickly. </p>

J: Mr Keating, you're a Sydney resident, art you shocked by the way the fies have<br />
ripped through NSW?<br />
PM: I am, and we all arc, but these arc unusual weather conditions. And I mean<br />
Sydney has assets which very few cities in the world have, and they arc very large<br />
areas of reserve around it, which the people of this city enjoy variously from time<br />
to time, but it always carried with it somne risks, and I think it Is a matter of<br />
managing those risks. It is thc Paitre of NSW, and the fact that there arc many<br />
national parks which does make the place such a beautiful place. But large forest<br />
areas will always attract some of these risks. It is a case of managing them. But out<br />
in the very large areas, as the Premier said, it is a moot question about whether you<br />
can ever effectively manage such a risk, with clearing et cetera. But in the Inner<br />
city areas, or areas near to the city proper, it is imponant I think that we do manage<br />
these areas well, particularly in the future, But preserving what we've had luckily,<br />
which other governments In the past have given us, that Is, thc foresight to declarc<br />
reserves around the city which has rmade Sydney one of the nicest cities in the<br />
world. TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP W ITH POOL TV CREW, OPERATIONS<br />
ROOM J: What's thc extent of the fires now?<br />
PM: Weill the first element of the briefing was that the containment of fire<br />
overnight, and the minimisation of loss of life and housing was probably the best<br />
news of the day, because as John ( Fahey) said earlier, we expected yesterday that<br />
mnore homes would be lost in the evening. Now it depends very much I think on<br />
the prevailing weather conditions today. If there is a successful containment over<br />
the course of the day there is somne prospect on mecteorological information of the<br />
wind shifting by about lunchtime tomorrow.<br />
J: How have you been able to help the fire fighters?<br />
PM. Well, we've got maximum deployment I think. We talked about aircraft, and<br />
we now think if we put any more aircraft in the air there is a dangcr to aircraft and<br />
to firefighters. So there is a maximum levcl or commitment of resources one can<br />
make, and I thinik in the case of the services we have more aircraft on standby and<br />
more pcrsonriet, but I think the message John and I rececived today was what we<br />
have deployed at the moment is the optimum that needs to bc deployed for the<br />
problcrms at hand. .1fal d 1 1 V INL1 V I. </p>

J: What do you think the costs will be to the governments?<br />
PM: Well let me just say this before I give you that answer, I think the spirit here<br />
has been remarkablc. That is, the co-operative spirit that has seen thc work not just<br />
of thc professional fire services, the police, ambulance, and thc defence forces, but<br />
the volunteers, and of course the thousands of ordinary people who<br />
have thrown their lot in with this. I think we are seeing Australia at its best in this<br />
environment. On costs, I've indicated to John this morning that wc, the<br />
Commonwealth, with NSW will pick up half the cost or the fire ighting effort.<br />
On the larger issues or replacing and putting back some of the lost infrastructure<br />
facilities and homes we have a set of forrmulae in place for that, but we are also<br />
having a talk about that as well.,<br />
DOORSTOP AFTER PM's AERIAL INSP'ECTION OF FIRE SITES TO<br />
THE NORTH OF SYDNEY<br />
PM: I think the impression we have is that the wind conditions at the moment, I<br />
mean the fires are burning on very broad fronts, and some of them arc still quite<br />
Intense, you can see very large flames. Others are burning through grasslands<br />
below the trees, but they axe burning on a broad front and you can see the<br />
extensive damage, and where certain localiti.. have been saved you can see where<br />
the fires have come right up to the odges of the homes. I think we'd say that the<br />
wind conditions at the moment are, if you like, retarding the progress of the fires<br />
somewhat. And with the wind change wc hope that doesn't accelerate them off into<br />
another direction, They will help In one respect, but not In others.<br />
J; Mr Keating, were you shocked by what you saw?<br />
PM: Well, it is the extent of it. But the fires which have taken homes they are<br />
smnall local fires which have come up a gully, they arc not part of thc big fires. The<br />
big fire,; have largely been contained in terms of communities and homes. But of<br />
course they have devastated a very large area of, if you like, the State's estate.<br />
J: So you are hopeful, are you? </p>
<p>I LL<br />
PM: Well I think the conditions today are better than we thought they might be,<br />
and by the end of the day if we get a wind change that suits the fires I think we<br />
could bc in better shape than we thought 24 hours ago. Bushflircs arc nasty things,<br />
especially seeing them work on such a big front and with very high flames. But<br />
some arc the high flame variety, others are the low grass burning variety which arc<br />
moving up through the hills, and they arc moving inexorably, now that the<br />
bushfires themselves arc not being fought, so they are just going on. If the wind<br />
goes thc wrong way on us, they'll jump some of the crccks, and that's some of the<br />
conccrn. Some of the small communities, you can see where the towns have actually been<br />
saved, the fire has burnt right down to them. So while there has been loss of life,<br />
which is tragic, and loss of housing, it is nothing on the scale that it could have<br />
been without a quite magnificent fire fighting effort.<br />
