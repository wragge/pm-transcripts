SPEECH 3Y THE PRIME VINI3STER, MRi. iiROLD HOLT<br />
AT DIIFER PARTY IN SEOUL 8TH APRIL, 19 7<br />
Prime Minister Chung, Mrs. Chung, Your Excellencies, Ladies and<br />
Jentlemen: I am delighted to have this opportunity on oehalf of the<br />
Australian Jovernment Iand the Australian Embassy, my colleagues<br />
from Australia of the official party and of the press who are here<br />
with me toni ht to be able to repay in the least fractional<br />
measure the kindness and hospitality, Mr. Prime Minister, that we<br />
have received from your Jovernment and your people. I am afraid<br />
this is only fractional in more senses than one. I am not able to<br />
offer you for example the delightful after-dinner entertainment<br />
with which you regaled us last ni; ht. Even if you were to come to<br />
Australia I question whether we could entertain you as delightfully<br />
as w: e were last evening. It will be a memory we will carry with<br />
us and treasure for many years to come.<br />
He are now near the end not only of our visit to your own<br />
country but of the journey on which we set out some twelve days<br />
ago to visit four o the countries of this area, neighbouring<br />
countries, friendly countries and it has beun for all of us,<br />
I am sure a most enthralling experience. I spoke Last niiht<br />
on what already had occurred to inform and interest us in the<br />
course of our visit to you, and this has been built on today by<br />
our visit to the South of your country.<br />
The weather in a sense was not timed, but I come from a<br />
very arid continent, and I have learned to welcome rain whenever<br />
it comes because rain means good fortune for somebody. At least<br />
I think you are assured of good crops as a result of the rain<br />
which we have encountered here today. I am only sad, and I pass<br />
my s mpathy and that of my colleagues to you that perhaps it<br />
was he result of the difficult conditions which we ourselves<br />
experienced in our own flying that you have suffered this tragic<br />
disaster from the air, which has caused the loss of. so many lives.<br />
Please accept, Prime Minister, our sympathy in this tragic event.<br />
Our first visit to the United Nations Cemetery at Pusan<br />
was a poignant reminder to us of our friendship. I h-id said<br />
yesterday that I understood there was a cemetery here, where one<br />
in every ten of the graves was an Australian grave, and I went<br />
there today. The Officer in charge of the Cemetery for the United<br />
Nations said it was one in six of the graves which .; ts Australian,<br />
and that is a reminder to us of our comradeship in more difficult<br />
times but a comradeship which laid the firm foundations of a<br />
friendship on which we have been aole to ouild ever since that time.<br />
Then, coming from a country which itself has enjoyed great<br />
industrial development over recent years, it was a stimulating<br />
thing to go to Ulsan and see there the tremendous industriil growth<br />
which, thanks to the imaginative vision and drive of your great<br />
President and of your own leadership and -overnment you have<br />
created in a matter of a few years. You now have tre oeginnings of an<br />
industrial complex which will fortify the economic strength of your<br />
country. Already you have, as I understand it perhaps the largest<br />
urea fertiliser plant in the world, a great refinery, and other<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
industries with more to follow. As we drove there, despite the rain,<br />
we found friendly people wherever we went. We found the beautiful<br />
countryside which is a part of your great heritage in this<br />
wonderful country.<br />
So all this adds together to ouild a memorable experience<br />
for us. As we come to the end of this journey in Korea my<br />
over-riding impression is first of the friendliness of your people,<br />
the warmth of which his greeted us wherever we have moved. My<br />
other impression is of the strength of your people their<br />
determination to preserve their Korean identity, tAeir determination<br />
to preserve the way of life they treasure. They have shown that<br />
they can and will resist those who would submerge that way of life<br />
in an oppressive communist dictatorship, and they have a determination<br />
not merely to maintain this country as a secure country and a free<br />
country, out to develop it and make it a better country for its<br />
citizens to live as a growing and strong member of the unity of<br />
free nations. May I just add by way of a concluding comment it may be<br />
of some interest to you because I think it is a happy augury for<br />
our future in this region of the world that my journeys have<br />
taken me to four different countries as well as officia encounters<br />
in Hong Kong and Singapore, and at no point have we found a hostile<br />
banner, a hostile voice, a hostile look.<br />
I, as a representative of a country which has European<br />
tradition and origin but -shich is happy to find itself part of the<br />
geographical unity which is Asia have seen warmth and friendliness<br />
wherever I have gone. Nowhere, Prime Minister, have we been<br />
received with more warmtn and more friendline. s than in this country<br />
of Korea, hitherto unexplored by an Australian Prime Minister. I<br />
thank you and your people Mr. Prime Minister for the hospitality which<br />
you have extended to us. I express the confident hope that these<br />
sound foundations of friendship will be built upon in the years<br />
ahead, and make for our two countries a continuing bond which will<br />
be built with strength for the area as a whole.<br />
In that spirit I invite you all to join with me in honouring<br />
a toast to the President of your friendly country of Korea and<br />
Mrs. Chung, their colleagues in the Jovernment, and the people of<br />
Korea whom we honour and with whom , we live in peace. I give you that<br />
toast. </p>
