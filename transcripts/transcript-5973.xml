EMBARGO 4.00PM TUESDAY<br />
7 DECEMBER, AEST.<br />
VISIT OF THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister,<br />
the Rt. Hon. J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
On 6 October, the Prime Minister announced that The Prince<br />
and Princess of Wales would visit Australia in March and April<br />
next year. I am now happy to state that agreement has been reached with<br />
Buckingham Palace on the dates for the visit, which will begin on<br />
Monday 21 March and end on Sunday 17 April.<br />
It is with great pleasure also that I can confirm that the<br />
Royal couple will bring their son, Prince William, to Australia.<br />
At Their Royal Highnesses' request, the family is being<br />
provided with a home base in the country for the duration of the<br />
visit. The base will be in New South Wales. The purpose of the<br />
base is to provide the Royal couple with an opportunity for rest,<br />
without official engagements and in complete privacy, between<br />
their visits to each State and Territory. Prince William will<br />
remain at the-base for the duration of the visit to Australia.<br />
From their base, the Royal couple will undertake visits to<br />
the Northern Territory ( 21-22 March), the Australian Capital<br />
Territory ( 24-26 March), New South Wales ( 28-29 March), Tasmania<br />
( 30-31 March), South Australia ( 5-6 April), Western Australia<br />
( 7-8 April), Queensland ( 11-12 April) and Victoria ( 14-15<br />
April). Their itinerary will include country centres as well as<br />
the capital cities.<br />
