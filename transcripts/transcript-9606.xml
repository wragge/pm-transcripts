PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF THE " TECHNOLOGY AUSTRALIA ' 95 EXPO",<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 30 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
Well thank you very much John ( Plunkett). Could I begin by especially<br />
welcoming our very distinguished guest, Professor Habibie and members of<br />
the Indonesian delegation.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be launching this at a time when the Indonesian<br />
Minister most closely associated with research and development is in our<br />
country. Could I also acknowledge my colleague Senator Cook, the Special<br />
Trade Representative John Button and, of course, our former long standing<br />
Minister for Industry, and members of the Industry Research and<br />
Development Board, representatives of companies exhibiting here today and<br />
ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well this is a very nice honour indeed to be opening this the first of these<br />
Technology Australia exhibitions which can showcase the innovations in<br />
Australian industry which have occurred, in part, in association under the<br />
IR&amp; D Board arrangements.<br />
It is true that one of the great comparative advantages that Australia has,<br />
probably its greatest comparative advantage, is its education system and by a<br />
revolution in our education system by, huge participation rates in secondary<br />
school, the creation of 60 per cent of extra places in higher education, the<br />
development of a vocational education system of standing. This is the<br />
foundation which our industrial development and research and development is<br />
built upon.<br />
The other change in the recent past is to recognise that Australia has always<br />
had a fairly deep pure research base and to get to know how to apply that.<br />
But we could never apply it adequately in the past when we were massively<br />
uncompetitive because the size of our domestic market was not of sufficient<br />
size to be able to carry the products we were able to produce.<br />
So much of what we do now is focussed on exports and we know that in the<br />
product innovation business, which is the business we have to be in, we can't<br />
be in the export trade unless we are competitive and the changes in<br />
Australian economic policy and industry policy, over the last decade, have<br />
meant that Australia today is 40 per cent more competitive than it was in </p>
<p>1983. Not only that and important as that is in making opportunities for<br />
exports and therefore developing products we have also had now a<br />
substantial premium on private research and development, which is itself now<br />
making a very great difference to the nature of the products we are producing.<br />
Our excellent scientific institutions, long standing ones like the CSIRO and the<br />
universities and the medical research institutes, have always been producers<br />
of innovative, high quality technologies. But we have encouraged, and sought<br />
to encourage, private research and development because we did lag behind<br />
many OECD countries in the private R&amp; D effort as distinct from the public<br />
R&amp; D effort. And back there in the 1980s, when we were wrestling with this<br />
when John Button was Minister for Industry and Technology, we looked at<br />
R&amp; D through grants and the IR&amp; D Board has been an important component<br />
and, if you like, sifting through, finding those things that deserve support and<br />
doing things in partnership.<br />
In a tax system which is fairly free of tax breaks, where the benefits have been<br />
passed along to a lower corporate rate, the one tax break we have left in the<br />
system is the write-off of 150 per cent for research and development<br />
expenditures. We have done that particularly to encourage and to be seen to<br />
encourage research and development so that private companies will take it up<br />
and we know that it has been a success and it is now one of the consistent<br />
underpinnings of our private R&amp; D effort.<br />
I think the other thing that the Government is particularly proud of are the<br />
Co-operative Research Centres. I think we now have just on 70 of these,<br />
maybe less 60 odd, and the range of things that we are doing is most<br />
particularly pleasing. But I think as much so, is the fact that we have the<br />
institutions like the universities and the CSIRO in there with industrial<br />
companies, working on technologies and being able to apply them virtually<br />
automatically and instantaneously.<br />
So, in other words, instead of just an institution or some other private<br />
company developing something and having limited capacity to apply it or,<br />
even more perhaps importantly, limited capacity to maintain the research<br />
effort, by funding Co-operative Research Centres by getting that private and<br />
that public quality to this research effort. We have, I think, made a bit of a<br />
breakthrough in the way research and development is done in this country.<br />
Could I just say a couple of things about the IR&amp; D Board. It has made<br />
1,000 grants totally over $ 250 million. We have got 4,000 companies<br />
registered now for the 150 per cent tax concession involving total deductions<br />
of $ 1.5 billion and registered syndicates involving research of approximately<br />
billion. Add that, of course, to what we are doing in the Co-operative<br />
Research Centres and there is a lot of induced research and development<br />
going on and that is reflecting in the nature of the products we can see about<br />
US. Now I am especially pleased that in the Great Hall we have some space to<br />
showcase some of these things. I know just going around the country<br />
recently, I was at Sola, a small Adelaide based company, it has grown into<br />
one of the world's largest producer of plastic spectacle lenses, manufacturing<br />
now in 11 countries. Or, Cochlear which is here, which is the leader in </p>
<p>implants for the profoundly deaf, which exports 85 per cent of its product.<br />
Hawker de Havilland is here with its new superlight fuselage for helicopters,<br />
which again will have domestic and international application. I think our new<br />
air traffic control system is on display.<br />
All of these innovations, I think, do focus on best practice and one of the<br />
things I am particularly pleased about with Peter Cook's involvement in the<br />
trade portfolio and now in industry, is the way the Best Practice program has<br />
grown and the way in which Australian companies have taken on<br />
Best Practice, world Best Practice as being something very important.<br />
Now we like to think that we can do things. We are developing not just<br />
something in Australia, but something in South East Asia, a base, an<br />
industrial base, some really deep industrial infrastructure and that is why I am<br />
particularly pleased that Doctor Habibie is with us today. Because this great<br />
nation to our north, Indonesia, nearly 200 million people, growing now<br />
consistently between 6 and 8 per cent a year, offers great opportunities for<br />
economic and industrial co-operation and there can be co-operation which<br />
goes not only simply to the commercial applications of technologies, but doing<br />
things together in the fields of defence. We already have a substantial<br />
defence co-operation between us and there is no doubt in terms of equipment<br />
procurement it may be possible in the future that we can do things together.<br />
At any rate, I think, it is in South East Asia's interest to be able to develop, in<br />
its own region, competent industries, apart from their commercial and trade<br />
orientation, competent defence industries too that add to the security of the<br />
region and give it a home grown capacity to be able to develop an industrial<br />
base. So, again, I would like to most especially see these growing linkages with<br />
Indonesia and particularly in this field of high technology and I am particularly<br />
pleased and honoured that Professor Habibie could be with us today and has<br />
taken the interest he has over the course of his visit in some of the higher<br />
technology industries of Australia to see what applications they might have in<br />
some joint co-operation.<br />
At any rate, Professor Habibie I would like to, again, welcome you here to<br />
Parliament House and to this exhibition and to the members of your party and<br />
I am sure you can join with me and Peter Cook in offering our exhibitors our<br />
congratulations at being able to demonstrate this today and to, again,<br />
commend the Industry Research and Development Board for their initiative,<br />
for their guidance, for their innovation in those things that will make Australia<br />
stronger and better.<br />
It is with very great pleasure that I declare open officially now this exhibition. </p>
