OPEvii4G OF NATIONAL EXPORT WEEK el OTl96<br />
11 OCTOBER 1968<br />
Seech by the Prime Mviinister, Mr John Gorton<br />
This is a week of the year which . means something to<br />
every Australian. It is one week'% in the year when, I think',, all of us here,<br />
Federal and State representatives, primary producers, manufacturers,<br />
miners, businessmen agree on one thing. Vie need to " export to prosper"<br />
and we need to develop if we are to achieve what is within our grasr. in<br />
national development. For that reason, I am glad to be honoured to be asked to<br />
be present today and to have the opportunity of supporting you and all those<br />
who have so energetically and enthusiastically organised this National<br />
Export Week. W. hat Sir Charles has said has been to the point. L-Ie has<br />
been perh'aps, I think, a little chilling, a little difficUlt in his assessment<br />
of the future, but that is all to thle good. Let = i accept what he has said as<br />
a warning of what could happen, not necessarily as a warning of what will<br />
happen, but what could happen if we become backsliders in the export drive.<br />
I agree entirely that Australia needs to do more in exports<br />
and that the greatest danger we face is, as has been pointed out, complacency.<br />
If complacency is an offspring of the success so far achieved, then let us<br />
strangle her offspring at birth.<br />
The whole purpose of National Export Weelk is to make the<br />
nation more export-minded, to convince producers and mnanufacturers that<br />
there are great benefits, direct and indirect, to be won from increased export<br />
activity. I believe in this nation we have the will and the capacity to dQ more.<br />
I think we have the will and thle capacity to succeed.<br />
I want to say a little about the Federal Government's role in<br />
this task. There is a lot we can do and indeed have done, but there are also<br />
limits to tile Government's role because we live in, and believe in, a free<br />
enterprise society. Governments can lead by example, by facilitation,. by<br />
co-operation and by giving incentives of one kind and another. But with<br />
industry itself primary or secondary lies the final response.<br />
At national level, the Federal Government has a duty to<br />
create, by the sensible use of the powers it has, the right climate for<br />
stability and growth, a climate which will allow development at home and an<br />
opportunity for access to world markets on reasonably competitive te tr-s.<br />
It has to do this in full co-operation with State Governments.<br />
Today the Australian economay is fundamentally sound, and the<br />
base onl which we can build anl increased export effort is there and is expanding.<br />
The problems which arise are, I think, only shiort term problems, providing<br />
we accept the challenge that is inherent in this National Export Vleelc. .. s/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There are always incipient dangers in any expanding econprny.<br />
W/ e can't control the weather not yet anyway and this can have a gie at<br />
effect on export incomes and on production. We have no, or little I think<br />
perhaps the proper word is " no" Government control over wage structureaand<br />
wage levels. We have to compete in overseas markets where the n4. tional<br />
self -interest of countries which provide those markets inevitably takes<br />
precedence over the fortunes of the foreign trader which in this case wouldd be<br />
us. We need more people and we need more capital.<br />
None of this is a new phenomenon, nor have we been slow<br />
in recognising our problems. The very existence of the Export Development<br />
Council is evidence of a recognition by the Government and by industry; of<br />
these problems. which I have set out. And may I say that I think the Cotancil<br />
has done a splendid job for a good many years now as an adviser to the,<br />
Commonwealth Government on exports.<br />
The picture I see is this. If our export effort just paddles<br />
along, then we are creating problems for ourselves and doing that with our<br />
eyes open, and not achieving all that may lie within our grasp. When the<br />
terms of trade ( as you have pointed out) broadly are against us, we cannot<br />
afford to be casual about those balances of payments or to depend too heavily<br />
on capital inflow to offset what we are losing on current account. I do hope<br />
nobody will assume that that sentence means that I don't want as much<br />
capital inflow as I can possibly get.<br />
We have to earn more foreign exchange, and the best, the<br />
safest, the most secure way in the long term is to build up an expanding<br />
export programme. In that we can be sure of paying our import bills.<br />
In that way we can develop our home industries by giving them new outlets<br />
for their products. I look forward in our national planning to what Australia<br />
will be in the year 2, 000, and I believe the 70' s here in Australia will usher<br />
in for us a thirty-year period of quite remarkable change and of extraordinary<br />
opportunity for growth, but we have to get moving now to be " with it".<br />
By the end of this century, if all goes well, we could be<br />
a nation of around 28 million people. To achieve that, though, we need to<br />
sustain our birthrate and to develop our migration intake on the lines of<br />
pre * sent planning. -If we do, this figure of 28 million is a reasonable figure<br />
for which to aim. But this will mean a continuous pressure on our resources.<br />
We will continue to need overseas capital, but insofar as you are successful,<br />
we will be less dependent upon it. Our economy is vulnerable if we become<br />
too dependent on it, and our solvency could be at risk because of factors<br />
entirely beyond our own control. The best insurance policy, the only valid,<br />
long term safeguard is that sustained export effort which I believe this<br />
Ccuncil is dedicated to achieve,<br />
The 70' s will bring us not only the population of which I have<br />
spoken and indeed, these things, many of them will come before the seventies.<br />
The 70' s will bring us the jumbo jets and supersonic airliners; it will turn<br />
friends into next-door neighbours in terms of time. Perhaps man will land<br />
on the moon, and what may result from that, even in terms of industry, can<br />
only be guessed at. Perhaps nothing, perhaps a great deal. These are all part </p>
<p>-3<br />
of the drama of our age. They are going to affect us in ways we can't measure<br />
now, but one thing is certain. They will draw us deeper than ever into the'<br />
international community, where the current for freer trade between nations<br />
has been flowing quite strongly for some time past.<br />
The Australian exporter will acquire a new status and a'new<br />
significance. He must be ready to respond, not only to the rising demapdij<br />
of the large, recognised markets of the world, but to the emerging marlef@<br />
which will be there as the developing nations of Asia establish viable<br />
economies and, like us, become hungry for imports Some forty per cent<br />
of our exports now go. to Asia, but as. you said, Japan takes the greatesv<br />
share. But there will be opportunities among the others as their resoucs<br />
increase, as their security is estalished, and I hope and believe that the'<br />
members of this Council will recognise those opportunities as they ari~ e and<br />
will work to take advantage of them for their industries' benefit and fov the<br />
benefit of the nation. Whatever excitements the seventies bring, they won't $ submerge<br />
the hard facts of economic life the business of meeting and paying<br />
international bills. We are, in this field, deeply committed to a costly<br />
Defence expansion programme and much of the defence " hardware" Jiich<br />
is the term, for some reason or other, usually applied to anything to do'<br />
with defence defence " hardware" has to be purchased abroad because it<br />
can't yet be made here. This has been taking, and it will continue to take, for<br />
some time yet, large bites from our foreign exchange resources.<br />
It is essential spending, absolutely essential, but it is not<br />
income -producing in business terms. It is not developing, in terms of<br />
adding industrial rather than military muscles. It gives a dividend, of<br />
course, in the form of security to the nation and ability to discharge treaty<br />
obligations, and I suppose that without that, business could not prcaper and<br />
exporters could not export, but those requirements being laid upon us are<br />
added reasons for increasing our earnings by exports from this country.<br />
Sir Charles has given you figures which show we are making<br />
progress but that other nations, admittedly much bigger than ours bigger<br />
in terms of population and bigger in terms of size of industries in many<br />
cases has given you figures that other nations bigger than ours are doing<br />
better. I believe that we can do better and that is why my Governm-ent supports<br />
tis National Export Week up to the hilt.<br />
Our policy, in basic terms, is constant. We stand for<br />
economic growth, we stand for national security and we stand for full<br />
employment. We aim to maintain what we already have, and that is one of<br />
the highest living standards in the world. That is to say we aim to maintain<br />
that, provided the workers, the manufacturers of this country take advantage<br />
of the climate which has helped this situation to come about.<br />
I think we are the thirteenth largest trading nation in the<br />
world today. I don't know that it matters a great deal how we rank, but I<br />
think we are. What matters more than how we rank is the contribution our<br />
trading makes to our balance of payments.<br />
We have proved ourselves to be one of the world's most<br />
efficient producers of temperate farm products, and by a tariff poikcy of<br />
protection for economic and efficient industry, we have developed a<br />
sophisticated and diversified economy. I -" think it is hardly necessary to ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
mention mifleralq oil and gas because we read about them every day at<br />
breakfast. Now all this provides exports and export potential. We<br />
have already penetrated, in some form or other, most of the recognised<br />
mnarkets of the world, but there are still new ones to be found and there are<br />
still opportunities for stepping up sales in the markets we have. There is<br />
plenty of scope for Australian ingenuity and originality. Although we have<br />
displayed quite a lot already, the more we can display, the greater will be<br />
the success of the efforts you are making.<br />
I know that some of you know, but did you all know that we<br />
export stainless steel cutlery, for example, to Sheffield, that we export<br />
tulip bulbs to Holland? Di d you know we export spaghetti to Italy, ball<br />
bearings to the Ruhr and windscreen wiper bla~ ies to Iceland? Did you<br />
knww xotchqebost Angok Our responsibility fiishes though<br />
with providing the cheque books! We export waffle-making machinery to<br />
America, safari suits to Zambia and Irish stew to Scotland? I could go on,<br />
but I think these examples are enough of the ingenuity and the taking advantage<br />
of opportunity of which I have spoken.<br />
The pattern of our trade has already changed significantly<br />
and it will continue to change. Vie have to adjust to that change and it is<br />
the individual exporters, the . meni in the field, who have ultimately to do the<br />
job. So I appeal to you today under five headings<br />
1. Be adventurous<br />
2. Aim for higher productivity<br />
3. Improve your products in such cases where it is<br />
possible for a product to be improved<br />
4. Research your industries and the Government is<br />
prepared to help research in industries.<br />
Double your efforts.<br />
I daresay you could well appeal to me under exactly the same headings, but<br />
well fair enough, let us both try.<br />
You, Sir Charles, ackmo w ledged the part the Gover nment<br />
is ptaying in encouraging exports. This will go on, through the commercial<br />
services of the Department of Trade and Industry, through insurance<br />
facilities, export incentives of one kind and another and by research and<br />
development grants. These are constantly under review to meet changes<br />
as they occur, and I think, Sir, that you bring suggested changes to our<br />
notice without noticeable inhibition.<br />
I would add that mñ-y Government has always looked<br />
syrnpathetically at proposals from industry designed to give Australian<br />
exporters a stronger competitive position overseas. It has also given<br />
leadership in negotiating commodity agreements and access to world markets<br />
under international trade arrangements. But I stress again at this point that<br />
this is where we hand over to you. </p>
<p>There is only one more thing I want to say and it concerns<br />
an export less tangible than the ones we have been talking about, It is*: the<br />
status of the Australian nation.<br />
W-e have, I think, a reputation among the nations of tIp<br />
world for stability and responsible administration; we pay our bills a-Ad<br />
we honour our obligations. This is an export commodity we must nourish carefully,<br />
just as carefully as we must watch the standard of the goods we prod~ ce<br />
to sell in the tough, competitive markets of the world. This again helps<br />
us to attract capital and market oppo rtunities.<br />
I believe we have the resdurces and the skills, and our<br />
people you people have the character and the integrity to be a really<br />
great nation. This is a period of bbilding Which in itself carries its own<br />
excitement. We are one peop le, living in an area of change and<br />
opportunity. I am confident we can make our future secure and also make<br />
a significant contribution to the peace and stability of thc Asian and<br />
Pacific environment in which we live.<br />
This we can do, not only by our industry at home and the<br />
development of our own country, but as a trading nation sharing the export<br />
markets of the world on a fair, permanent and enlarging basis. This is<br />
your objective, this is the objective of those who are attending this Week,<br />
this is the Government's objective. M-,-ay I express the hope that t~ og--ether<br />
we achieve those objectives for the good of us all. </p>
