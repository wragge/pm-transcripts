TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON<br />
P. J. KEATING, M. P.<br />
COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS MEETING HOBART<br />
FRIDAY 25 FEBRUARY, 1994<br />
PM: The Commonwealth, myself and my colleagues the Treasurer and Deputy<br />
Prime Minister, met with Premiers and Ministers over lunch and while there<br />
were varying opinions we did manage, in a cooperative way to get an<br />
agreement on adopting the general principles of the Hilmer Report on<br />
competition policy; on authorising work to be undertaken jointly between us<br />
on legislation, between now and the next COAG meeting which will include in<br />
the broad the f1ilmer Report on competition policy applying to all sectors of<br />
the economy and all levels of government.<br />
So, I'm just about to give to Premiers the collated result of that session and that<br />
will be incorporated in the communique. So, it was a productive lunch, -one<br />
which will advance the whole process of competition policy reform over the<br />
next months to August, but, more particularly, one which will advance<br />
competition policy making the whole economy more competitive including, and<br />
particularly, government business enterprises.<br />
J: What about their demands about industrial relations reform?<br />
PM: Well, this was not.., whatever discussion there is to be on that it was not part<br />
and parcel of this result and this was one of the core matters of this COAG<br />
meeting in fact the core matter of this COAG meeting and I'm pleased to<br />
say we've had a very cooperative discussion.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you prepared to change the industrial relations legislation in<br />
any way?<br />
PM: Well, we're about to go in and discuss now the other elements on the agenda<br />
water, electricity reform and all these other things. Industrial relations is just<br />
one of those agenda items. The key message here is that the Hiliner discussion<br />
has been encapsulated around itself only and not party to other...<br />
J: So, IR legislation is on the table? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: No, look, ask me about the IR legislation at the end of the day.<br />
J: What about the audit that the states wanted?<br />
PM: Well, that is the states understanding, themselves, what these competitive<br />
changes mean in terms of costs for their own government business enterprises.<br />
Well, that's fine, all governments should know that.<br />
Ends. </p>
