PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 APRIL 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
It's easy enough for Canberra politicians to'make pronouncements<br />
about great national and international issueS. It's easy<br />
enough to make speeches about " confidence returning" and<br />
" recovery proceeding". The myriad sets of official figures<br />
and surveys provide a sound enough basis for: these statements.<br />
But that's only part of the picture.<br />
Surely, the only real measure of a nation's pulse is its people<br />
what we are trying to achieve, what we feel and how we look<br />
ahead to next week, next year, the years beyond that.<br />
This cannot be found in any list of figureslor reports or<br />
surveys. Only be spending time with people, in their own<br />
backyard, can leaders in the community and leadersi of Government<br />
guage the real hopes and fears of Australian.<br />
As Prime Minister, I have a responsibility not to lock myself<br />
away in Canberra. I have to ask myself constantly are our<br />
policies roeting the real needs of our people spread over a<br />
vast continent?<br />
Over the last few days, Tamie and I have been talking with<br />
school kids, parents, businessmen, farmers, pensioners, blokes<br />
in bars--people from all walks of life in the south-west<br />
corner of Australia and in Bundaberg on the Queensland coast.<br />
These areas are thousands of miles apart. The people we spoke<br />
with had very different problems they had very different<br />
needs. Yet the over-riding impression was one of enormous<br />
confidence of great faith in our country.<br />
Men and women were looking ahead with the kind of spirit and<br />
optimism that I haven't seen in Australia for a long time.<br />
" We all kr: ow there are still problems, but we are going to make<br />
the most of what Australia has to offer", was the kind of<br />
comment made over and over.<br />
Of course, people are concerned about different things. The young<br />
people I spoke with at schools and on a television program showed<br />
a concern a natural concern about uranium policies and<br />
about our international obligations to refugees. They looked<br />
at these issues with intelligence, sensitivity and a moral<br />
force that says something most telling about Australia's future.<br />

<p>They'were looking for explanations to questions that they had<br />
thought about deeply to questions that govrernments think<br />
dieply-about.<br />
Many-of . th~ e older and harder heads of the men in the Workers<br />
Club atNcrseman were worried about wages and wage justice.<br />
I was disppointed to hear they had been told that the<br />
Arbitration Commission would never listen to them'unless they<br />
reinforced their case by going on strike. Of course, that is<br />
nonsense. The Commission looks at the merit of-a. case and<br />
a strike simply isn't part of the merit.<br />
* Many of the blokes who were striking realised that the<br />
Arbitration Commission is the umpire and that they would<br />
get a fair go from the umpire. They know they are only<br />
losing money and harming their home life by using-the<br />
strike weapon as a first step.<br />
Of course, Australians generally speak their mind with direct<br />
language and frankness. We will always argue about issues<br />
we will alwdays have a go at government. But today, we understand<br />
that governments have many complex and difficult problems to<br />
face up to and overcome. There are always problems to solve.<br />
People look at the worth of government by how it goes about<br />
tackling those problems.<br />
As a Government, we are committed to responsible management<br />
of the nation's affairs. We will not shirk the tough decisions.<br />
We will not1 govern through the popularity polls.. From what<br />
I've heard in the last few days talking to average Australians,<br />
we would fail as a Government if we took any other course. </p>
