PRIM AUTAIAISTE<br />
FOR PRESS: PAM. No 79/ 1972<br />
TASMANIAN APPLE AND PEAR INDUSTRY<br />
Statement by the Prime minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William Mctiahon,<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. McMahon, said in Canberra today<br />
that he was very concerned at the Position of the Tasmanian<br />
apple and pear industry. He said market access problems and<br />
rising costs of production were mainly to blame for the situation.<br />
" The Commonwealth Government was taking several steps to<br />
help ease the problems facing the industries," Mr. McMahon said.<br />
" Since the United Kingdom devalued sterling in 1967 the<br />
government has provided substantial sums of money to the industry<br />
to offset the effects of the devaluation. In the three years<br />
1968-69-70, payments of devaluation compensation to the industry<br />
were $ 2.4 million, $ 2.1 tillion and milliontmaking a total<br />
of $ 7.1 million. " Besides this initiative the Commonwealth has implemented<br />
the apple and pear stabilisation scheme which commenced wit the<br />
1971 season. In this season $ 2.6 million was Paid by the government<br />
to the Australian apple and Pear industry, which Tasmania dominates.<br />
In this week's Budget a further $ 3.15 million has been prcvided<br />
for the 19072/ 73 season. The amount in this week's Budget includes<br />
a special allowance totalling $ 0.4 million as a special provision<br />
for the 1972/ 73 season.<br />
Following a move instituted by the Commonwealth Government<br />
earlier this year, the Australian Agricultural Council set up a<br />
special committee to examine and report on the transport and<br />
marketing problems of the apple and pear industry. This committee<br />
which has been actively pursuing its enquiries into these problems<br />
will be meeting again in the very near future. Besides all these<br />
steps the Commonwealth Government has offered, and the states have<br />
accepted, a proposal that the Commonwealth finance a fruit growing<br />
reconstruction scheme which will initially cover fresh-apples<br />
andpears as well as the canning Peaches and pears industry. The<br />
assistance provided under this proposal will be additional to the<br />
large sums already made available under the rural reconstruction<br />
scheme. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Of the $ 4.6 million which the ConmonwealtC. h is providing for the<br />
fruit growing reconstruction schemrC, $ 2.3 million is to be allocated<br />
to the fresh annle ana near industries and the<br />
balance to the canning peaches and pears industry. Most of the<br />
$ 2.3 million for the fresh apple and near industry will be<br />
received by Tasmanian producers.<br />
This scheme will apply in two types of circumstances.<br />
Firstly to those producers who are in severe financial diffipulties<br />
and wish to clear fell their properties and leave the industry,<br />
and secondly it will apply to those producers who do not have<br />
adequate financial resources to remove surplus trees without<br />
assistance, but whose enterprise could contin'e to be viable if<br />
redundant trees were removed and the land put to other uses.<br />
in each state the scheme will be administered by the state<br />
directed rural reconstruction authority.<br />
A draft application form for assistance under the schemre<br />
has been prepared by Tasmanian officials and applications will be<br />
considered postdated to 14 July 1972.<br />
In the determination of the rate of assistance, the<br />
reconstruction authority will -take into account the age, the<br />
variety and yield of the trees. The avorage assistance paid will<br />
be about $ 200 per acre but maximum rates could be higher.<br />
Earlier I made reference to the study by the special<br />
committee of the Australian Agricultural Council into the problems<br />
of the industry. The complexity of these problems means that it<br />
could be some time before specific proposals coulAd be available for<br />
consideration by governments. Because of thlis, the Commonwealth<br />
Government has decided that some special measure of assistance<br />
should be provided to the apple and pear industries pending the<br />
completion of the studies. I-* am hopeful that the result of the<br />
studies will lead to some permanent solution to the industry's<br />
problems. However, while this study is being completed the<br />
Commonwealth Government has decided, as as announced in the Budget<br />
spneech, that leqislation will be brought down immediately to lift<br />
the maximum tonnage of apples and pears eligible for payment under<br />
the stabilisation scheme from 4.4 million bushels as at present<br />
provided under the legislation to 4.9 million in respect of the<br />
1972 crop. This will. add an amount of $ 400,000 to the maximum<br />
Commonwealth commitment under the stabilisation scheme for the<br />
current season. This move, together with all the other policies of<br />
assistance the Co-mmonwealth Government has adopted with respect<br />
to the Tasmanian apple and pear industry, will give the industry<br />
greater security and stability.<br />
CANBERRA, 18 August, 1972. </p>
