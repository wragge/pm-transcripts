GROWTH CENTRES IN QUEENSLAND<br />
It is unfortunate f or the people of Queensland,<br />
and particularly for those of Townsville who would be the<br />
first to benefit, that the Queensland Premier is more<br />
interested in making political points than in receiving<br />
financial assistance from the Australian Government.<br />
His ill-informed comments on growth centres contrast<br />
starkly with the attitude of Liberal Premiers in New<br />
South Wales and Victoria who have welcomed the Australian<br />
Government's initiatives and cooperated with them.<br />
The principles involved have been approved by the<br />
Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia<br />
and are in the process of being implemented in Albury/ Wodonga,<br />
Bathurst/ Orange, the South-West sector of Sydney and Monarto.<br />
The basic principle agreed is that people should be<br />
able to build their homes on their own land and hold this land<br />
in freehold tenure for all time. The only condition that has<br />
been placed on residential freehold is that land owners should<br />
not be able to make private profit out of public decisions<br />
such as a change in land use zoning.<br />
At no time has the Australian Government considered<br />
any proposal that all homes built in growth centres should be<br />
for rental. In all growth centres supported by the Australian<br />
Government people will have full opportunity to buy houses of<br />
their own choice. The Australian Government and all State Governments with<br />
whom agreements have been negotiated want to see viable growth<br />
centres that do not have to rely for their establishment and<br />
continued growth on subsidies. The objective of the Australian<br />
Government has been to provide special financial support in the<br />
early stages of growth and provide, where necessary, facilities<br />
in advance of the normal time by which they would be needed. For<br />
all revenue producing investment a basic principle of repayable.<br />
loans has been established. For the growth centres agreed with<br />
State Governments, long term loans are being provided at the<br />
long term loan rate with initial grace periods. But agreements<br />
have been reached with State Governments on the provision of nonrepayable<br />
grants for certain purposes. For example, in the case<br />
of sewerage backlog the assistance provided by the Australian<br />
Government has been one-third grant and the remainder long-term<br />
loans. Grants on a two for one matchihg basis are being made<br />
available for the purchase of non-urban land. Assistance will<br />
also be provided for projects to a standard higher than they<br />
would have been provided for an equivalent population in other<br />
areas in a State. The aim is to develop attractive well-planned<br />
growth centres. / 2 </p>
<p>A detailed evaluation of proposals for international<br />
airport facilities at Townsville is being undertaken currently<br />
by the Bureau of Transport Economics. A report is expected<br />
to be available at the end of next month. It is important,<br />
of course, that any major proposals such as this for Townsville<br />
be effectively integrated with other major projects and programs<br />
to cater for future growth.<br />
Accelerated growth in Townsville could be successfully<br />
achieved if an agreement were reached between the Australian<br />
Government and the State Government on the basic objectives of<br />
a program and the basic principles to underly that program.<br />
The Australian Government wants to see a more rational distribution<br />
of population, improved access of people to the range of<br />
specialised services which can only be made available in large<br />
centres and the access of people to cheap developed land.<br />
The Australian Government has promised to help promote<br />
that growth. Its programs however need the cooperation of<br />
the Queensland Government if they are to be fully realised.<br />
