PRIME MINISTER 118/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
STATE TAX CAT OUT OF THE BAG<br />
Mr Costello's tax cat is out of the bag and Mr Kennett has belied it.<br />
Mr Costello's answer to repairing the Vertical Fiscal Imbalance which he says<br />
exists between the Commonwealth and the States a State income tax has<br />
been endorsed by his Victorian colleague, Premier Jeff Kennett.<br />
This comes as little surprise because Mr Costello told Business Review<br />
Weekly that he had consulted conservative State Governments, which of<br />
course includes Victoria.<br />
Mr Kennett's comments articulate the plan.<br />
He says that basically the Commonwealth should have Defence,<br />
Telecommunications and a few other responsibilities and it should only be<br />
able to collect 20 per cent of the income tax. The balance the other 80 per<br />
cent would be collected by the states to fund social policies and services.<br />
Apart from the inherent problems in this proposal, the conservative States are<br />
already walking away from all the responsibilities he says they should have.<br />
Health and education come readily to mind, and no one brings them to mind<br />
quicker than Mr Kennett himself.<br />
The Victorian Premier has been closing hospitals down at an alarming rate,<br />
shutting down hundreds of schools and has now embarked on a privatisation<br />
binge which includes Victoria's ambulance services.<br />
There is no better example of the Liberal mindset than Mr Kennett. Unless it<br />
is Mr Howard, of course.<br />
We are now seeing the real conservative agenda revealed: get the<br />
Commonwealth out of social policy, get the Commonwealth back to some<br />
core functions, give the States the responsibilities and walk away from them;<br />
reduce the Commonwealth of Australia to a mirror image of the Liberal Party<br />
a mere collection of States.<br />
It is all consistent with Mr Howard's long-held view of the world. </p>
<p>2<br />
Let there be no doubt that John Howard and Peter Costello mean to have<br />
State income taxes and State consumption taxes. They want the bulk of the<br />
revenue raised by the States and they want the Commonwealth pinned back<br />
to minimal responsibilities.<br />
What we would then have is two tax bases in the system a Commonwealth<br />
income tax and State income and broad based consumption taxes.<br />
