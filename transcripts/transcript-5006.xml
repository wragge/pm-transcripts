PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 1 APRIL 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
All Australians will welcome the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli<br />
peace treaty. President Carter, Prime Minister Begin and<br />
President Sadat have begun a significant new chapter in the<br />
saga of the Middle East. For the Israeli people that saga<br />
has spanned thousands of years with their exile to Babylon.<br />
For the Egyptian people the signing of the treaty marks<br />
the end of thirty years of hostility with a neighbour,<br />
punctuated by fierce wars in the Sinai Desert. For America,<br />
this treaty is a fitting tribute to the skilled and unrelenting<br />
efforts of President Carter in leading the two nations<br />
together in the quest for peace.<br />
The signing of the treaty in Washington this week came after<br />
months of work by the three leaders. It began in 1977 with<br />
President Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem to address<br />
the Knesset. It was there he renewed his pledge that Israel<br />
and Egypt should no longer attempt to settle their differences<br />
by war. In that one visit, Israel achieved the implicit<br />
recognition of a major Arab nation and new and exhilirating<br />
prospects of real and lasting peace.<br />
Australia welcomed President Sadat's courageous initiative<br />
because it represented the first real breakthrough in<br />
years of continual warfare. It opened a new path which<br />
Israel has always wanted, but which bad until then seemed<br />
inaccessible the path to negotiation.<br />
That historic journey in search of peace was followed by the<br />
Camp David meeting last September, which came from the personal<br />
initiative of President Carter. After Camp David, there were<br />
lengthy, difficult negotiations, and often despair about<br />
the resolution of problems. President Carter's decision to<br />
visit the Middle East early in March however, led to the final<br />
breakthrough. The three leaders are to be congratulated for their dedication.<br />
They displayed statesmanship of the highest order. Today, in<br />
the aftermath of the treaty, the world hopes that work on<br />
a comprehensive Middle East settlement can proceed. / 2 </p>

Much remains to be done. It is Egypt and Israel that<br />
have taken this step to peace. Elsewhere, Arab countries<br />
have protested often vehemently. It is our earnest<br />
hope that these countries can be encouraged to accept the<br />
treaty as a first step on the road to a just and<br />
lasting peace.<br />
Your Government has supported, and will continue to support,<br />
all moves designed to meet this end. We have done this in<br />
the hope that peace can become a reality for all the peoples<br />
of the region. I have no doubt this hope will be embraced<br />
by families who have settled in Australia from countries<br />
throughout the Middle East and who have friends and relatives<br />
still living there.<br />
The treaty is a triumph for the forces of moderation and reason.<br />
It is a victory for those who believe in the capacity of<br />
man to resolve differences by thought and word and not<br />
by fighting.<br />
In world forums, Australia pleads the cause and course<br />
of moderation. As an independent nation joining with other<br />
aligned and non-aligned nations by seeking to find<br />
reasonable answers to world problems we strengthen the<br />
cause of moderation.<br />
Our earnest desire is to break down the barriers between<br />
nations between people. Symbolically, a great barrier<br />
tumbled in Washington this week. We all hope that symbol<br />
gives new impetus around the world for man's highest<br />
mission peace. 000---</p>
