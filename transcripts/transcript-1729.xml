FOR PRESS: PM. No. 128/ 1967<br />
SATELLITE IN ORBIT<br />
The Minister for Supply, Senator Henty, rang direct<br />
from Woomera this afternoon to advise the Prime Minister in Canberra<br />
that Australia's first satellite was in orbit.<br />
Mr Holt asked Senator Henty to pass on his congratulations<br />
to all concerned with the project. The Prime Minister described it as a<br />
notable scientific achievement demonstrating the remarkable advance<br />
by Australia in this field. It was a tribute to our scientists and to<br />
successful co-operation with scientists of other nations.<br />
