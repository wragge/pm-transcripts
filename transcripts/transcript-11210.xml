<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention briefly two issues.</p>
<p> I would like, on behalf of the Australian Government, convey our very</p>
<p> deep sympathy to the people of Jordan on the loss of their King. He</p>
<p> was the monarch of Jordan and the undisputed leader of Jordan for</p>
<p> 43 years. He became King at the age of 17. And there was not much</p>
<p> doubt during most of his reign that he enjoyed not only the support</p>
<p> but also a great deal of affection from his people.</p>
<p>There are many things that could be said about King Hussein. Probably</p>
<p> the finest tribute that can be paid to him is to recall his very courageous</p>
<p> involvement when the Wye River Accord was being negotiated. When clearly</p>
<p> suffering the devastation of cancer he came from his sick bed and</p>
<p> worked very hard to bring about the agreement between the Palestinians</p>
<p> and the Israelis. And as a result he is entitled to join the ranks</p>
<p> of others who've tried so very hard to bring about a peace settlement</p>
<p> in the Middle East.</p>
<p>I have conveyed a message of sympathy to the Prime Minister of Jordan.</p>
<p> I have expressed the willingness and the desire of Australia and the</p>
<p> Australian people to continue the close relations between our two</p>
<p> countries under the new monarch.</p>
<p>His son, King Abdullah, does inherit a very proud legacy. The late</p>
<p> King waged a very courageous battle for a long time against cancer</p>
<p> and I send my respects and our expressions of condolence to his family</p>
<p> and to the people of Jordan.</p>
<p>Can I also take this opportunity to thank Shane Stone for his contribution</p>
<p> as Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Shane Stone was not only</p>
<p> a political colleague of mine but I regarded him as a good political</p>
<p> friend. I thought he gave very good leadership to the Northern Territory.</p>
<p> He continued a long tradition of highly successful CLP leaders in</p>
<p> that Territory. And although he suffered a natural disappointment</p>
<p> when the Statehood referendum was defeated last year, nothing can</p>
<p> take away from the very distinguished contribution that he made to</p>
<p> the politics and to the development and the economic growth of the</p>
<p> Northern Territory.</p>
<p>I wish him well in whatever he may choose to do in the future. I believe</p>
<p> that he served the Northern Territory very well. Naturally my Government</p>
<p> will be very happy to work closely with the new Chief Minister of</p>
<p> the Northern Territory when that person is formally installed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you've spoken of Mr Stone's contribution</p>
<p> to the Northern Territory and to your side of politics, do you think</p>
<p> you might be able to find a way of using those talents in the future?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would like to. I'm not aware of any desire on Mr Stone's</p>
<p> part to pursue a parliamentary career elsewhere but he's a person</p>
<p> of very great ability. He was a person, incidentally, well respected</p>
<p> in Asia and he had a lot of contacts in the Asian region as many northern</p>
<p> territorian politicians had done. But I don't have anything particularly</p>
<p> in mind in relation to the Asian sphere if that is what you're</p>
<p> next leading to.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well no, on the other hand, would you think that he could make a contribution</p>
<p> in the Federal Parliament now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think he would make a contribution wherever he might turn</p>
<p> his attention but I can honestly say to you that I am not aware of</p>
<p> any intention on his part to enter Parliament in some other way. I</p>
<p> mean, you normally enter it by being elected, I mean, enter some other</p>
<p> parliament.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Who will represent Australia at the funeral of King Hussein?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Our Ambassador. Time constraints have meant that the funeral is taking</p>
<p> place, so I'm advised, at 6.30pm tonight, Eastern Australian</p>
<p> Summer Time. And that's 6.30pm Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne time.</p>
<p> It's just not proved possible to send a senior member of the</p>
<p> Government to be there in time. It is a reminder of, given the conjunction</p>
<p> of the religious practices involved for early burials and the distance</p>
<p> of Australia from the Middle East, it's just not proved possible.</p>
<p> And we'll, therefore, be represented by our Ambassador.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on another subject - are you pleased that the Malcolm</p>
<p> Turnbull of the Australian Republican Movement is now having second</p>
<p> thoughts about the question of whether, in the referendum on the republic</p>
<p> issue, there only be one question and that he would be prepared to</p>
<p> support, or his organisation would be prepared to support a question</p>
<p> on a new preamble as well, does that please you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't sort of, you know, get up breathlessly waiting</p>
<p> for Mr Turnbull's latest pronouncements each morning on that</p>
<p> or any other subject. Look, that's something that the Party Room</p>
<p> will take into account when it discusses this issue. People should</p>
<p> understand that we are allowing an open vote and a free vote on the</p>
<p> whole issue of matters relating to the republic. But there are arguments</p>
<p> for and against the preamble issue. I think there are a lot of Australians</p>
<p> who would like the opportunity to express their belief that it would</p>
<p> be nice to honour, in the foundation document of this country, the</p>
<p> prior occupation of the land mass of Australia by the indigenous people</p>
<p> because it's an historical truth which nobody can dispute. Just</p>
<p> how you get there, and can I assure you that I won't be motivated</p>
<p> by any views that I have in relation to the principles question and</p>
<p> that is the republic. Everybody knows my view on that. I've never</p>
<p> disguised it. I've never pretended to the Australian people I'm</p>
<p> anything other than what I am on that subjected, and I've been</p>
<p> elected Prime Minister twice despite them knowing that. So I don't</p>
<p> think people can sort of get into the business of accusing me of having</p>
<p> any machiavellian desires on this count. But there are some logistic</p>
<p> difficulties. What a lot of people overlook is that the preamble is</p>
<p> not part of the Constitution. It is part of the British Enabling Act</p>
<p> which enacted the Constitution Act of Australia. So you do sort of</p>
<p> have some significant logistic [inaudible]. On the other hand I think</p>
<p> there are a lot of people across the republican divide who would like</p>
<p> to join in an expression acknowledging in our basic document the prior</p>
<p> occupation of the land mass of Australia by the indigenous people.</p>
<p> And I use those words carefully because I think once you start introducing</p>
<p> other elements to it you start to lose a lot of Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you motivated then to provide leadership to see some form of preamble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well very interesting, this word leadership is always used now to</p>
<p> sort of bring forth a change of position on somebody's part.</p>
<p> It's the modern political paradigm. You call on somebody to show</p>
<p> leadership when you want them to change their position. It's</p>
<p> very very interesting. Look, the question of whether we have a preamble</p>
<p> or not is something that our Party Room's going to discuss and</p>
<p> that is in the spirit of involving my colleagues in this issue as</p>
<p> carefully as possible. I don't want any of the republicans to</p>
<p> think that this is being introduced in order to harm the chances of</p>
<p> the republic in question getting up. That is certainly not the desire</p>
<p> as I understand it of any of my colleagues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] prospect of Camilla Parker Bowles being the next Queen</p>
<p> of Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you make of the prospect of.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't given that any thought. I thought the current position</p>
<p> was that that was not in prospect.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There were a question on a new preamble in the Constitution. Will</p>
<p> we take it that you would, if that were the case, would you campaign</p>
<p> strongly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let's take one thing at a time Jim.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no. What I'm proposing to do, as I said a long time ago,</p>
<p> and that is to consult my colleagues about this issue.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] idea of your view? You seem to imply really that you're</p>
<p> much more passionate about that kind of an issue than you are about</p>
<p> the republican issue.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think I've ever pretended to be passionate</p>
<p> about a republic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You're opposed to one aren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm opposed to it because....well look I don't want</p>
<p> to get into the debate about it. You all know I'm against it.</p>
<p> There's no news in that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] are you in charge of the preamble? Is that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I would like to explore it further and the reason I would like</p>
<p> to explore it further is that I detect within the Australian community</p>
<p> that I would like to see as part of the observance of the centenary</p>
<p> of federation a recognition in our foundation document of an historical</p>
<p> truth. I think a lot of Australians feel that way whether they vote</p>
<p> Liberal or Labor, or whether they are for or against a republic. Now</p>
<p> that is an honest statement of my position. I recognise that there</p>
<p> are some logistical difficulties involved, the principle one being</p>
<p> what I've just described and that is the existing preamble is</p>
<p> not part of the Constitution. So you've got to think all of that</p>
<p> through and that might turn out to be all together too difficult.</p>
<p> And if it does turn out to be all together too difficult then you</p>
<p> won't be able to deal with it. I'm simply saying to you</p>
<p> is that I detect within the Australian community, whether they are</p>
<p> republican or not, or whether they're Liberal or Labor, a desire</p>
<p> for that formal acknowledgment, because they see it as an historical</p>
<p> truth that can hardly be disputed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Your Minister for Reconciliation also [inaudible] also wants the preamble</p>
<p> considered in the referendum and he wanted to acknowledge the disadvantage</p>
<p> Aboriginal people....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're not going to get into the detail of it except to say that</p>
<p> I think once you go too far you'll start losing people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] free vote if you ran a preamble question.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Michelle, I've already been tried on that and I've</p>
<p> said I'm going to consult my colleagues, and I don't have</p>
<p> anything further to say. Thank you very much.</p>
