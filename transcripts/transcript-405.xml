BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER ( THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES)<br />
ON NATIONAL STATIONS AT 7.15 P. M.<br />
24TH NOVIE4BER9 1961<br />
FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br />
I will not take up your time by rehearsing what we have<br />
done in the field of foreign policy. In my Policy Speech I made<br />
references to the treaties to which we had become parties, such<br />
as ANZUS and SEATO, which mean so much to our own security and to<br />
the defence of South East Asia against Communist aggression.<br />
On this occasion I will briefly say something about<br />
four current world preLlems Disarmament, Berlin and Germany,<br />
Laos and South Vitnam, and Indonesia and West New Guinea.<br />
1. DISARMAMENT Earlier this year, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, in<br />
London, unanimously made a doclaration in favour of disarmament,<br />
beginning with a suspension of nuclear tests. As you know the<br />
Soviet Union ignored this, and quite suddenly resumed such tests<br />
on a singularly great scale.<br />
In srite of this callous and threatening action, which<br />
cannot be ignored by the Wfestern Nuclear Powers, we believe that<br />
negotiations should be resumed as soon as possible indeed<br />
urgently, and that an agreement for suspension, under proper<br />
control and supervision, should once more be sought.<br />
Meanwhile, the Western Powers must be free to look to<br />
their own defences. The proposal, made in some quarters, that nuclear<br />
weapons should be abolished without a general disarmament agreement<br />
is quite unrealistic. If accepted, it would be suicidal,<br />
for the free world's great deterrent against Communist aggression<br />
would disappear.<br />
2. BE'RLIN AND GERMANY<br />
This is one of the great issues in the Cold War which<br />
the Communists have maintained so long.<br />
Khrushchev says he wants peace. His followers in<br />
Australia and their dupes or fellow-travellers, say they want<br />
peace. o do you and I. But if Khrushchev wants peace over<br />
Berlin, his course is quite easy.<br />
He can recognise the position of Berlin as it was<br />
established, between the Allies, at the end of the War, with the<br />
Allies entitled to be present with troops, with free access9 and<br />
with freedom. He can, through his satellite government of East<br />
Germany, permit such access.<br />
He can permit the free movement of freedom loving<br />
people out of East Germany, as the Declaration of Human Rights,<br />
to which the Soviet Union subscribes, requires.<br />
He can join in promoting a free election by all the<br />
German people to decide whether they want to be united or not.<br />
He will do none of these thinas. He prefers threat and crisis,<br />
because in such an atmosphere he thinks that Communism will<br />
make headway. The West wants peace. It makes no threats. But it<br />
will not surrender to bullying. We agree with the West. </p>
<p>3. LASAD__ THY; % AZ<br />
Win common with our partners q 1 SAO tn<br />
Laos which is independent, self-governing on a<br />
neutral, and not a sateLite of either side.<br />
Why should such an obviously just solution take so long<br />
to achieve? L-1. hy do the talks at Geneva go on indecisively?<br />
Again, the answer is that the Communists while pretending to want<br />
peace, are essentially concerned to acquire authority and control<br />
over nations now outside their dominion.<br />
South Vietnam, headed by a gallant fighter against<br />
Communism, is a test case in the great cause of resistance. 4ie<br />
believe that if Communism won in South Vietnam, South East Asia<br />
could be lost to freedomz, and the isolation of Australia would be<br />
ominous. That s why we h-ill stand up to our obligations under<br />
ANZUS and SEATO.<br />
4. INDOICZ-AIA AND WjEST Mij' GUINEA<br />
The issues here need to be once more, explicity stated.<br />
Indonesia is a near neighbour-, with her own political and economic<br />
problems. , Ie want to be on The best of terms with her. We<br />
profoundly sympL. thise with her desire for economic and social<br />
, growth, for an assured independence, for resistance to Communist<br />
control. We receive her students, and in turn do what we can to<br />
assist her own development. There is no enmity between our<br />
people, nor should there be.<br />
The one matter of difference between us concerns West<br />
New Guinea, over which the Netherlands exercises sovereignty.<br />
,4e recognise that sovereignty, just as we expect other people to<br />
recognise our sovereignty in Papua.<br />
But we do not seek to perpetuate any form of colonialism.<br />
We have for years made it clear that we regard ourselves as holding<br />
East New Guinea in trust, aiding the development of its people ( at<br />
no small cost) until the day comes when those people having been<br />
equ4. pped for competent decision, decide their own future for<br />
themselves. This is the principle of self-determination, We<br />
have welcomed the promotion of precisely that policy by the Dutch<br />
government in relation to 4est New Guinea. In the United Nations,<br />
the Netherlands have made quite clear their willingness -to transfer<br />
to the people of West New Guinea full sovereignty just so soon as<br />
they are ready to assume it.<br />
, That is wrong with this? 1o are told that the government<br />
of , Iadonesia dislikes this attitude of ours, though it is one which<br />
we have voluntarily imposed upon ourselves in relation to our own<br />
section of the island.<br />
All I can say is that Australia is a democracy, ard<br />
therefore deeply attached to the principle of self-. government.<br />
So far from being " colonial exploiters", as the phrase goes, we<br />
put into Papua and New Guinea, in hard cash and hard work and<br />
devoted service by many hundreds of Australians, far more than we<br />
ever hope to get out of it. Our one great ambition is that, when<br />
the day comes for these territories to determine their own des-tiny,<br />
th'jir people will look on us as friends who have been faithful and<br />
just to them. If this is how we feel and act, why should we deny the<br />
same policies to the Netherlands?<br />
So far, Indonesia has not accepted the principle of<br />
self-determination for the people of West ' New Guinea. It says<br />
that the area is; or should be, part of Indonesia, and that it<br />
has no more righLt to delf.. determination than, say, Sumatra or the<br />
Celebes. We would like to see the issue of sovereignty taken to<br />
the International Court, by whose judgment all could abide. </p>
<p>3.<br />
We are not partisans in this matter, for we are not parties<br />
principal. But, while legal sovereignty resides in the<br />
Netherlands and is not legally challenged in the appropriate<br />
tribunal, we must adhere to our support of the principle of selfdetermination.<br />
We deprecate talk of war over such a matter. We want<br />
peace and friendship. There is no occasion for hostility.<br />
Living as we do so close to the great island of New Guinea, we<br />
regard the interests of its people and their peaceful progress<br />
as the paramount consideration. We hope that all concerned will<br />
see it in this light. </p>
