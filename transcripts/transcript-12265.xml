Today I have called upon business leaders across Australia to join a re-elected Coalition Government in a partnership aimed at protecting the integrity of this nation';s critical infrastructure.<br />
The Government has in place a range of measures to protect the key infrastructure required for the functioning of our open society.  Earlier this year, we established the E-Security Co-ordination Group and the Government Infrastructure Protection Group to specifically deal with issues relating to the security of information systems, particularly as they apply to key national assets.<br />
We have also introduced strengthened measures since September 11 including increased airport and airline security, heightened intelligence activity, additional training for staff in areas such as postal services and increased protection for major public buildings and diplomatic posts.<br />
Immediately following the election, I propose convening a Business-Government Task Force on Critical Infrastructure which will give business greater input into the assessment of current arrangements to protect key infrastructure sectors.  To make best use of the work of this Task Force, they will be requested to report to me prior to the special Leaders Summit on Transnational Crime and Terrorism, which I announced recently.<br />
While Australia remains a safe country in which to live, my government believes this is a prudent and necessary step to take.  The protection of critical infrastructure, in sectors such as transport, banking and finance, energy, water supply and telecommunications is vital to maintain community and business confidence.  The aim is to assure Australians that both the physical safety of key assets as well as the information technology systems on which so many of them depend are protected.   I look forward to working with Australia';s business leaders to further enhance our national security.  This type of co-operative approach has been a hallmark of my Government since first coming to office.  In tackling significant social problems, we have harnessed the resources, the talents and the commitment of those within government, the business sector and the community.<br />
The concept of a security partnership between the government and business is a logical application of this principle.  All of us have a stake in national security - all have a contribution they can make.</p>
