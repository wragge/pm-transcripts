PRIMINEI STE<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 NOVEMBER lgc<br />
President Bush and Mrs Bush will visit Australia as Guests<br />
of the Australian Government from 31 December 1991 to 3<br />
January 1992. The President will arrive in Canberra on 31<br />
December and spend 1 and 2 January there before travelling<br />
to Sydney on 3 January. He will leave for Singapore on th(<br />
afternoon of 3 January.<br />
In Canberra, he will have talks with myself and other seni(<br />
Ministers, and the Cabinet; receive a call front the Leader<br />
of the Opposition; and meet a number of other grroups<br />
including representatives of Australian farmers.<br />
In Sydney, he will speak at a State lunch hosted by the NS!<br />
Premier, Mr Greiner, and will dedicate the American Gallerof<br />
the Australian National Maritime Museum.<br />
President Bush's visit to Australia is part of his first<br />
major Asia-Pacific tour as President. Besides Australia<br />
will visit Singapore, Japan and Korea.<br />
President Bush's visit to Australia and to the Asia-Pacif: 4<br />
region will provide an important opportunity for the<br />
President to reaffirm and redefine the US role in our<br />
region, in the wake of the dramatic global events in which<br />
he has played such a momentous part.<br />
This visit will also help to reinforce the very strong<br />
bilateral ties between Australia and the United States and<br />
should prove an important landmark in the relationship.<br />
I know that all Australians will join with me in warmly<br />
welcoming the President and Mrs Bush and their party to<br />
Australia.<br />
