CHECK ACAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
3RD INDIRA GANDHI MEMORIAL LECTURE<br />
NEW DELHI 10 FEBRUARY 19a9<br />
-Indira Gandhi was a leader of indomitable tenacity and<br />
* courage. I had the privilege of knowing her, wocking with her<br />
indeed, even enjoyinq some differences of emphasis with her<br />
here in this city at the 1983 Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting.<br />
Tonight I salute her as a Leader who left an indelible<br />
imprint on the political, economic and social life of T ndia,<br />
and ensured that India's voice was heard with force and<br />
clarity in world affairs.<br />
So to deliver a lecture in memory of ndi; ra Gandhi and to<br />
deliver it in the capital of the India which she loved so<br />
dearly is an honour which I greatly appreciate.<br />
Just as today you Mr Prime Minister derive strength from the<br />
achievements of your predecessors,. so Indira Gandhi drew on<br />
e rich heritage of leadership bequeathed by her father<br />
UJawaharlal Nehru and before him, by Mahatma Gandhi.<br />
Part of the greatness of these J1eaders was that their ideas<br />
and their policies and their actions had a resonance and a<br />
relevance that went far beyond the borders of their own<br />
country. Mahatma Gandhi gave us the noble doctrine of non-violent<br />
struggle in the face of oppression, the belief that human<br />
dignity should not be demeaned by violence even. An mobilisin~ g<br />
the masses to overthrow colonial rule.<br />
His visionary campaign against racial discrimination has<br />
become an international crusade. Australia, India and other<br />
nations have come together in particular to bring pressure to<br />
bear on the South African authorities to rid that country of<br />
the tuoliness and inhumanity that is apartheid. </p>
<p>Nehru, the centenary of whose birth we mark this year,<br />
bequeathed a different and equally rich heritage of political<br />
leadership. Nehru forged a nation with his unyielding<br />
adherence to principles of humanism, secularism, democracy<br />
and equity.<br />
The forty years after the Second World War have been among<br />
the most turbulent, certainly the most dynamic, in human<br />
history. Massive social, economic, political, and scientific<br />
upheaval has transformed our world.<br />
In all these turbulent times, there has been one constant<br />
which has dominated the world scene the East/ West<br />
Oconfrontation. The influence of East/ West tension has been felt everywhere.<br />
The extraordinary achievement of decolonisation became<br />
entangled in it. Regional conflicts were fought as<br />
surrogates of the wider confrontation.<br />
The United Nations, founded with high hopes and with a sober<br />
consciousness of the need for nations to work together to<br />
avoid the scourge of war, and to seek some common ideals of<br />
justice and equity, became to some degree another<br />
battleground for what was seen as a bigger dispute. It was<br />
unable to play as full a role in international security as<br />
was envisaged by its founders.<br />
The best efforts of the international community to cope with<br />
poverty, hunger, human rights, economic growth, refugees<br />
were, to a greater or lesser extent, diminished by the<br />
injection of the East/ West rivalry. Even the Non-Aligned<br />
* Movement, founded precisely as a reaction to this crude<br />
divide, has itself not been free of internal disputes over<br />
the relative merits of East and West.<br />
What is remarkable is that so much was achieved in that<br />
period in decolonisation, in the UN system, and elsewhere.<br />
But that so much less was accomplished than should have been<br />
accomplished was due in no small part to the all-pervasive<br />
nature of East/ West hostility.<br />
And, most ominously of all, inherent in the East-West<br />
confrontation was the danger of nuclear war, of global<br />
annihilation. Mrs Gandhi saw these problems, and as a leader of one of the<br />
great nations of the world, she worked to help overcome them.<br />
But even a leader as far-sighted as Mrs Gandhi would have<br />
shared with us a sense of astonishment at how remarkably the<br />
world has changed in the four years since her tragic and<br />
untimely death. </p>
<p>In arms control and disarmament, the superpowers have forged<br />
the INF agreement, the first arms control agreement to cut<br />
the number of nuclear weapons, rather than to mandate a<br />
stipulated level of increase.<br />
Although much remains to be done, much has already been done<br />
towards the conclusion of an agreement to cut by about<br />
the number of strategic nuclear warheads.<br />
Almost as spectacular has been progress in resolving regional<br />
conflicts. During the seventies and early eighties we heard<br />
much of an arc of instability. We see now, if not an arc of<br />
peace, then at least an arc of peace-making, stretching from<br />
Southern Africa, through the Persian Gulf, through<br />
Afghanistan and South Asia and on to Indochina.<br />
The United Nations is being revitalised and is playing an<br />
indispensable part in resolving regional conflicts.<br />
This transformation in the world scene has taken place in<br />
breathtakingly short time. What has brought it about?<br />
The answer in large measure is a change in attitude, a<br />
reassessment of interests, a response to new realities by<br />
East and West.<br />
Speaking as the leader of a Western alliance country<br />
unalterably committed to the system of liberal democracy, I<br />
consider that it is very important to recognise that the gap<br />
between the political values and social and economic systems<br />
of the US and the Soviet Union remains profound.<br />
Nonetheless, I believe it is already clear that the<br />
superpowers no longer see their competition as having only<br />
one possible outcome to be victor or vanquished, winner or<br />
loser.<br />
The relationship is today a far cry from that of two cold<br />
warriors. Rivalry yes, competition yes, differences yes; but<br />
not implacable hostility, to be played out to check mate on<br />
some global political chess board.<br />
To understand why this transformation has occurred, clearly<br />
one half of the equation is what is happening in the policies<br />
of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Soon after General-Secretary Gorbachev took office, he began<br />
a process of root and branch change in the economic, social,<br />
political and cultural life of his nation. In international<br />
affairs, Australia will judge by deeds, not just words. But<br />
I do acknowledge this there have been deeds, including in<br />
arms control, regional conflicts and human rights. I draw<br />
encouragement from this.<br />
of course there have been premature declarations in the past<br />
that the Cold War is over not least at the beginning of the<br />
last decade. But there is good analytical reason, not just<br />
hope, that what we are seeing now will not prove to be<br />
another false dawn.<br />
My view, informed by my own conversations with Mr Gorbachev<br />
and his colleagues, is that what we are seeing in Soviet<br />
developments is far more fundamental than earlier efforts at<br />
Soviet reform.<br />
Mr Gorbachev has said and there is reason in Soviet<br />
behaviour to believe he means it that the Soviet Union's<br />
world view is no longer dictated by conceptions of<br />
international class war and the inevitable defeat of<br />
capitalism. Above all, it is absolutely clear that highly centralised<br />
command economies can no longer compete in the international.<br />
economy. As you fully recognise, Mr Prime Minister, modern economies,<br />
to be viable, must place a premium on adaptability, on free<br />
flows of information, on entreneurship, on dissent and<br />
* debate, on unfettered scientific research and technological<br />
change.<br />
These in turn require the freeing up of political<br />
institutions and economic and social controls.<br />
Without these, the Soviet Union will, as Mr Gorbachev has<br />
himself said repeatedly, inevitably decline.<br />
So it is for these more objective reasons that I am perhaps<br />
more confident than many that the course on which the Soviet<br />
Union has embarked is one which it is likely to stay on for<br />
the foreseeable future.<br />
The indispensible other half of the equation in explaining<br />
the improvement in superpower relations lies with the United<br />
States. </p>
<p>Paradoxically, President Reagan, deeply conservative in so<br />
many of his attitudes, showed himself capable of finding<br />
common ground with his Soviet counterpart, of establishing a<br />
basis of trust with him on important areas of mutual concern,<br />
and of taking a truly radical path on arms control.<br />
From what I know of President Bush and his colleagues, I am<br />
absolutely confident that a continuation of the new approach<br />
from Moscow will find a co-operative spirit of good will in<br />
the United States.<br />
In devoting this amount of time to East-West relations as the<br />
dominant factor in world affairs now and for many years to<br />
come, I do not want to ignore other developments which are<br />
also driving forces for change.<br />
China's modernisation program is entering its second decade.<br />
From Australia's perspective, it has had an enormously<br />
favourable impact on the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
" Perestroika" is much newer. The economic problems facing<br />
China and the Soviet Union are far from identical. But the<br />
fact that both countries are giving priority to the urgent<br />
agenda of economic reform over the pursuit of strategic and<br />
idealogical rivalry goes a long way to explain the current<br />
improvement in their relations. At the same time, the dynamic<br />
economic performance of the newly industrialised economies<br />
has shattered many prejudices about the developing world in<br />
general and about Asia in particular.<br />
The spectacular economic successes of countries such as the<br />
Republic of Korea, and, now, countries like Thailand, are<br />
illustrating as I have seen again only last week that the<br />
Asia-Pacific region has become the most important focal point<br />
of international economic dynamism.<br />
Its impressive growth strategies are being studied and<br />
emulated, and it is being courted by prospective investors,<br />
joint venturers and exporters from all. corners of the globe.<br />
Increasingly, its growth is becoming more self sustaining and<br />
less dependent on access to affluent Western markets.<br />
And with economic success comes greater political self<br />
assurance. Indeed it could be said that where we were, in the Cold War<br />
years, used to assessing the clout of a nation by its<br />
political or strategic significance, nations can now exercise<br />
great influence based solely on their economic strength. We<br />
see in Japan an example of a new phenomenon an economic<br />
superpower. </p>
<p>So all these developments would surely have surprised and<br />
gratified Indira Gandhi.<br />
But as the leader of a great democracy, she would perhaps<br />
have been encouraged by nothing so much as by the wider<br />
spread throughout the world of democratic rule.<br />
This has its roots in a number of different factors.<br />
In Latin America, in South-East Asia, and most recently next<br />
door to you in Pakistan, authoritarian regimes have<br />
discredited themselves and have been replaced by democratic<br />
leaders governing with popular consent.<br />
Elsewhere in the world and particularly in Asian economies<br />
such as the Republic of Korea the rising living standards<br />
that are the fruit of dynamic economic growth are being<br />
accompanied by a liberalisation of political structures.<br />
And perhaps most encouraging of all, we see even in China,<br />
the Soviet Union, and parts of Eastern Europe, the efforts of<br />
a new generation of leaders who understand that for their<br />
efforts to be successful a simple, old-fashioned reliance an.<br />
authoritarian command is no longer sufficient. They realise<br />
that for positive economic change to succeed, political self~<br />
respect is an essential precondition.<br />
That is a fact that Australians and Indians, proudly and<br />
unshakeably democrats, know to be a profound and undeniable<br />
truth.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
To review as I have done all these welcome trends the rapid<br />
transformation of relations between the superpowers; the<br />
economic dynamism of countries that were once only limited<br />
players in the world economy; the spread of democracy<br />
provides sufficient evidence for the conclusion that we are<br />
on the verge of a new era in world affairs.<br />
My judgement is that this will be an era in which the<br />
rhetoric of the Cold War will-be out of date and misleading;<br />
an era in which building prosperity and peace must be our<br />
prime task, not building the arsenals of war; an era in which<br />
we may, at long last, begin to balance what is today a<br />
puzzling asymmetry between the seemingly boundless<br />
technological skills of humanity and our much less developed<br />
social skills of feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless<br />
and protecting the natural environment of the planet we<br />
share. </p>
<p>In speaking in this optimistic way I do not seek to pretend<br />
that all is well in the world today or that we can afford to<br />
be complacent as we enter this new era.<br />
For all that we have reason for'satisfaction with the<br />
progress that has been made across all the areas I have<br />
outlined, our confidence for the future must be conditional<br />
on the performance of four critical tasks.<br />
They are these:<br />
We must achieve greater flexibility in the organisation and<br />
operation both of our domestic economies and of the global<br />
economy. We must achieve further cuts in the levels of nuclear and<br />
conventional arms.<br />
We must strengthen the practice and institutions of<br />
multilateralism. And underpinning all those tasks, we must see the<br />
entrenchment and the futher spread of democracy, tolerance,<br />
individual liberties, and respect for human rights.<br />
It is no accident that I put at the head of my list economic<br />
factors in both their international and domestic dimensions.<br />
Increasingly, the economic process has a global base.<br />
Capital has a worldwide mobility, as increasingly do skills,<br />
entrepreneurship and the adaptation of technology.<br />
O These are major changes, and they are already having a<br />
profound impact on the behaviour and inter-relation of<br />
states. These changes mean that domestic economic policy<br />
making can no longer proceed for any country in isolation<br />
from that global base.<br />
Ultimately, the poverty or prosperity of any one nation<br />
depends on the poverty or prosperity of us all just as,<br />
ultimately, the physical security of each nation is enhanced<br />
by an environment in which all nations feels secure.<br />
Even the superpowers are having to alter their domestic<br />
economic policies in order to maintain their standing in the<br />
world and to keep up with the pace of change. I have already<br />
mentioned Mr Gorbachev's reforms. In the United States,<br />
President Bush faces twin budget and balance of trade<br />
deficits which, if not addressed effectively, could call into<br />
question its past position as the overwhelmingly dominant<br />
economic power and its capacity to sustain long-standing<br />
global political and strategic policies. </p>
<p>Likewise, a major area of activity for us in Australia, and<br />
for you in India, has been the restructuring of our domestic<br />
economies to adapt to the changing global environment.<br />
But at a time when international financial markets and<br />
exchange rates are being freed up, and at a time when<br />
individual nations, be they capitalist or socialist, are<br />
making efforts to improve their efficiency and<br />
competitiveness, one fundamentally important area is being<br />
pushed in the opposite direction.<br />
International trade, which if it too were liberalised on a<br />
multilateral basis would provide a massive boost to<br />
* prosperity everywhere, is increasingly being subjected to<br />
ever more restrictive and inefficient measures.<br />
Here on the one hand is a growing recognition by nations of<br />
the need for economic adjustment and on the other hand<br />
their refusal to apply that insight to an area of central<br />
importance to the wellbeing of us all.<br />
Thus we are witness to the major paradox of our time.<br />
Precisely at the point when the world has greater cause for<br />
optimism arising from the increasingly intelligent political<br />
relations between the superpowers, the realisable vision of a<br />
saner world, using its resources more productively for the<br />
betterment of mankind, is being put at risk by the<br />
intransigence and shortsightedness now characterising the<br />
relations of the most powerful market-based economies on this<br />
issue of international trade.<br />
Economies which have built their prosperity on co-operative<br />
Wfree trade now put that principle in jeopardy, while<br />
superpowers which had become accustomed to the habits of<br />
their dangerous rivalry now adjust to the challenges of<br />
constructive rapprochement.<br />
If history teaches us anything, it teaches us that where<br />
economic deprivation and injustice go, instability and even<br />
hostility tend to follow, whether within countries or between<br />
them. So a fair and open international trading regime is vital not<br />
only to prosperity but to sound and harmonious relations<br />
between nations.<br />
Australia, as a nation whose exporting capacity has<br />
traditionally relied heavily on agricultural commodities, has<br />
sought, and continues to seek, positive and constructive<br />
outcomes in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade<br />
negotiations. </p>
<p>The benefits of success in this endeavour will not of course<br />
be limited solely to agricultural exporters.<br />
They will be shared by the consumers within those heavily<br />
subsidising developed economies, the European Community, the<br />
United States and Japan.<br />
Agricultural trade liberalisation would bring particular<br />
benefits to developing countries.<br />
Freer world trade would provide a means whereby they can<br />
directly benefit from the prosperity of dore fortunate<br />
countries. It would also encourage developing countries to integrate<br />
themselves more with the world economy. They cannot prosper<br />
while their price structures do not reflect those prevailing<br />
internationally.<br />
In this sense the alleviation of world poverty requires<br />
policy flexibility both internationally and in the developing<br />
countries themselves.<br />
It is vital that this alleviation occur, not just for the<br />
humanitarian benefit to those currently living in poverty<br />
although this is certainly sufficient reason but also<br />
because the world will never be stable and secure while we<br />
have intolerably stark contrasts in national living<br />
standards.<br />
And may I add how galling it must be for developing<br />
Sountries, as it is for Australia, to hear the leading<br />
industrial nations preach to others the virtues, indeed the<br />
necessity, of practising policy discipline and budgetary<br />
restraint, which they give little indication of following<br />
themselves.<br />
The second key area in which there must be progress as we<br />
enter this new era is arms control and disarmament.<br />
Certainly there has been unexpected progress, and more may be<br />
in prospect.<br />
But, even if the START talks bear fruit, I do not think it<br />
churlish to say, " Good. We want more. And quickly". Even<br />
with both the INF and START agreements in place, the Soviet<br />
Union and the United States will still possess at least<br />
12,000 strategic warheads, to say nothing of the thousands of<br />
tactical weapons not covered by agreements, and the nuclear<br />
weapons of the United Kingdom, France and China. </p>
<p>To me, then, while these present and prospective agreements<br />
are enormously welcome, they should not lull us into<br />
complacency about the nuclear danger.<br />
Nuclear deterrence, vital though it is while nuclear weapons<br />
exist, is unacceptable as a permanent feature of our world.<br />
The consequence of this is that the goal of arms control must<br />
be nuclear disarmament.<br />
It is true that this path will be a long and difficult one<br />
but it is the path we must deliberately and consciously<br />
tread. I would not accept any view that declares the elimination of<br />
nuclear weapons to be ultimately pointless because of the<br />
impossibility of locking up again the secret of nuclear<br />
weapons manufacture.<br />
Many countries have the technological and industrial base for<br />
developing nuclear weapons, if they so chose.<br />
Many have security interests which they consider to be just<br />
as important as the security interests of the existing<br />
nuclear weapons states. They have rejected the nuclear<br />
option. No matter how pressing immediate political or military<br />
considerations may seem, no matter how understandable may be<br />
frustration at the pace of progress towards nuclear<br />
disarmament, no matter how galling may be the existence of<br />
nuclear weapons exclusivity, it is supremely in the interest<br />
of the survival of our world that no other countries acquire<br />
nuclear weapons. Once the nuclear taboo is broken once the<br />
dike of nuclear proliferation is breached the odds that<br />
someday, somewhere nuclear weapons will be used rise<br />
dramatically. It is for this reason that we consider the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty to be the most important single arms<br />
control agreement in existence. I know, of course, that<br />
India has criticisms of the Treaty. I understand India's<br />
view but I must say that Australia does not agree. Whatever<br />
criticisms may be levelled against the Treaty cannot begin to<br />
warrant putting it in jeopardy.<br />
We cannot let the best, which is the goal of nuclear<br />
disarmament, become the enemy of the good, which is the NPT. </p>
<p>India is the one non-nuclear weapon state which has<br />
demonstrated a nuclear explosive capability. I frankly wish<br />
that capability had not been developed, but given the reality<br />
I urge that you continue firmly to reject the production of<br />
nuclear weapons.<br />
Without any reservation we enco.. rage India to support the<br />
maintenance of the NPT regime.<br />
Against this background, we welcome as a positive step the<br />
recent agreement between India and Pakistan prohibiting<br />
attacks against each other's nuclear installations. We very<br />
much hope that further practical confidence-building measures<br />
exemplified by this agreement will lead to the ultimate<br />
accession to the NPT and-acceptance of the full scope of<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by India and<br />
Pakistan. The nuclear weapons states, who have a vital interest in the<br />
NPT, must play their part in its maintenance by fulfilling<br />
the obligations they have undertaken under Article VI of the<br />
Treaty to move towards nuclear disarmament. Specifically<br />
and you know Australia and India are fully in agreement on<br />
this they must move towards the conclusion of a<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as a matter of urgency.<br />
It will be apparent from all that I have said so far that<br />
many crucial international economic and security issues by<br />
their nature are susceptible to resolution only through the<br />
multilateral process.<br />
As we move into the next decade, we will have to cope with<br />
new problems such as the scourge of narcotics, other<br />
international forms of crime including terrorism, as well as<br />
other non-military threats to. security. These problems<br />
require global solutions, and frankly we have been slow to<br />
mobilise to meet them.<br />
The third point then to which we will need to devote time and<br />
effort over the coming years is the revitalisation of<br />
existing multilateral institutions and, where necessary, the<br />
creation of new ones.<br />
Our commitment to multilateralism is based on our belief in<br />
the importance of establishing and enforcing acceptable norms<br />
of international behaviour. As international law extends.<br />
beyond traditional land boundaries to cover first the sea and<br />
now outer space as well, we are concerned to seek that the<br />
totality of interests of humanity are well protected. </p>
<p>12.<br />
AiiStralia and India, this will be a welcome task, because<br />
we have been among the most prominent multilateralists in the<br />
international community.<br />
The multilateral dialogue between India and Australia in<br />
diverse fields arms control, decolonisation, economic arid<br />
trade issues, apartheid and human rights represents a<br />
substantial component in the sum of contacts between our two<br />
countries. Our differences on some key issues make this<br />
dialogue all the more important, not less.<br />
Among the problems requiring urgent multilateral action<br />
perhaps the most serious is the growing threat to our natural<br />
environment. Greatly increased emission of greenhouse gases<br />
ithreatening to bring about potentially cataclysmic global<br />
climatic change. Tropical forests are being destroyed at a<br />
disastrous rate. The ozone layer is thinning from the<br />
release of large quantities of chlorofluorocarbons into the<br />
atmosphere. With the threat of nuclear holocaust diminishing as arms<br />
control negotiations continue, the equally potent but more<br />
insidious threat of environmental disaster is quite rightly<br />
generating growing community concern around the world..<br />
Likewise, the negotiated reductions of the nuclear arsenals<br />
prove that, with good will and mutual trust, mankind can<br />
consciously enhance the prospects for environmental<br />
protection. At a time when economic growth is so vital to raising living<br />
standards, especially in less developed nations, there is a<br />
genuine and growing belief sometimes bordering on fear and<br />
despair that economic growth is jeopardising our capacity<br />
to bequeath to our children their rightful heritage: the<br />
irreplaceable beauty and value of the forests and jungles,<br />
the rivers and oceans, even the air we breathe.<br />
I reject the doctrine of despair that the twin goals of<br />
economic growth and environmental security are incompatible.<br />
But I recognise resolution of the dilemma will require<br />
co-ordinated action of the most careful, and yet the most<br />
decisive, nature by governments and individuals.<br />
For Australia's part, we have these issues firmly on my<br />
Government's policy agenda. Last year I initiated work by my<br />
Ministers to develop Australia's strategy to contribute to<br />
international environmental action. </p>
<p>13.<br />
I-believe we are seeing a greater responsiveness, a greater<br />
preparedness to act, throughout the world, and that political<br />
commitment to environmental protection will intensify during<br />
the year.<br />
I-am also pleased that the environment will be a major theme<br />
at our next Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
As we prepare to enter the 1990s and to face the three tasks<br />
I have outlined so far, the network of friendly international<br />
relations, such as exists between Australia and India, will<br />
continue to be a great asset.<br />
India and Australia have always been friends.<br />
Now it is time to consolidate our relationship.<br />
It is my belief that, in this changing world of growing<br />
economic interdependence, we are going to need each other<br />
more. Australia and India must do more to exploit the great<br />
potential of our economic relationship. I am delighted that<br />
in our talks over the past two days, Prime Minister Gandhi<br />
and I have agreed on steps to accomplish this.<br />
Closer links between Australia and india will serve not only<br />
the interests of our two countries, important though that is.<br />
They will also make a contribution to the stability and<br />
wellbeing of the region and to our' ability to work together<br />
in helping shape the international environment.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
There is one other important bond between India and Australia<br />
and it should not be overlooked in this attempt of mine to<br />
review the opportunities and challenges faced by the<br />
international community in the decade leading to the 21st<br />
century. I said before that there were four essential tasks for the<br />
future. So far I have only given you three.<br />
The fourth is the keystone to them all: the need to preserve<br />
and expand the practices of democracy. </p>
<p>In the capital city of the world's largest democracy, I can<br />
say with conviction and pride that Australians, like Indians,<br />
place absolute confidence in the abiding qualities of a<br />
democratic society: individual liberty, the just rule oflaw,<br />
tolerance of diversity and free and fair participation<br />
' in the machinery of representative government.<br />
You know as well as I do, Prime Minister, the occasional<br />
frustrations of democratic leadership. But robust debate and<br />
time consuming negotiations are essential elements of<br />
democratic government and provide the best way towards the<br />
formulation and implementation of effective policy.<br />
It was your grandfather who put it this way: " Democracy i s<br />
good. I say this because other systems are worse."<br />
our peoples are fortunate indeed to be entering the 1990s<br />
equipped in the best possible way for the tasks ahead<br />
equipped with the knowledge, based on our deepest experience,<br />
that those societies built an the principles and practices of<br />
democracy will be the most successful and will foster the<br />
greatest good for its people.<br />
I feel profoundly privileged to have been given the<br />
opportunity of leadership of a democratic nation at this time<br />
of immense global change, of breathtaking opportunity, of<br />
profound challenge.<br />
We are here to celebrate Mrs Gandhi her memory and her<br />
achievements. Hers were harsh and dangerous times times<br />
when the nuclear danger seemed to grow almost with a life of<br />
its own, despite the best efforts' and intentions of men and<br />
women of good will times when great concepts of liberty,<br />
justice, and equality, manifested in the struggle for<br />
decolonisation and against racism, became snared in the<br />
entangling web of the East/ West conflict times when the<br />
scientific and technological fruits of man's labours did far<br />
less than they could to overcome the poverty and suffering of<br />
millions.<br />
We who have come after her are privileged to live in a<br />
different time, a new era. We can do no better for her<br />
