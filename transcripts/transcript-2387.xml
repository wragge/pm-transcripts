FOR PRESS: PM No. 33/ 1971<br />
NEW HIGH COMMISSIONER TO NEW ZEALAND<br />
The Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. William McMahon, today<br />
announced the appointment of Senator the Honourable Dame Annabelle<br />
Rankin D. B. E. as the new Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand.<br />
Mr. McMahon said " As Foreign Minister, I had had discussions<br />
with Dame Annabelle about the possibility of her accepting a diplomatic<br />
appointment. She then informed me that she would be interested in a diplomatic<br />
post should a suitable one become vacant.<br />
Dame Annabelle and I have again discussed the appointment and we<br />
have agreed that she should become the Australian High Commissioner in<br />
Wellington. I have already discussed the appointment with the New Zealand<br />
Prime Minister, Sir Keith Holycake who welcomes the appointment of a<br />
member of the Ministry as High Commissioner.<br />
Dame Annabelle will be the first Australian woman to be appointed<br />
as Head of an Australian Diplomatic Mission.<br />
She will succeed Sir Edwin Hicks, formerly Secretary of the Defence<br />
Department whose three year term as High Commissioner expired on 1st March."<br />
Mr. McMahon paid warm tribute to Dame Annabelle's distinguished<br />
Parliamentary career both as a Senator and a Minister. She was the first<br />
Queensland woman to enter the Federal Parliament. She had been a Senator<br />
since 1946 and a Minister since 1966.<br />
Mr. McMahon said " I know she will make a unique contribution to<br />
the very friendly relations that exist between our two countries".<br />
