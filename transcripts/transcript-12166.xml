    <content><![CDATA[<p>In responding to my claim that the rate of the GST could rise under a future Federal Labor government because of rollback, the Victorian Premier,<br />
Mr Bracks, has said that there are ways other than raising the GST rate to fund rollback.</p>
<p>The Australian people should be immediately told about these other ways.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley and Mr Bracks should come clean. They should tell us how rollback is to be paid for.</p>
<p>Mr Bracks claims it won't be through a rate rise in the GST.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley, having already guaranteed the States that they would not be worse off under rollback, has also promised to increase spending and not to lift income tax.</p>
<p>It simply won't add up. Unless the Leader of the Opposition has found some hitherto unknown fiscal "fourth way" he has no capacity to deliver on his rollback commitments.</p>
<p>The Victorian Premier is to be thanked for blowing the cover on Federal Labor's rollback deception.</p>
