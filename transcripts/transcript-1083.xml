OPENING OF NE-. ' JI SCIENCE BLOC~ i: K AT ST. STANISLAUS<br />
CO THRST 27TH Kk-RCHI. 126<br />
Spe ech by the P rixwe j. nistr 1 Aet, L. rf lR9oo bLe $ ze<br />
Reverend Father ? rincipal, My Lord Bishops and Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen and fellow workers<br />
I have been very pleased here today to hear<br />
these kind things spoken about the policies that we have been<br />
trying to pursue, Personally, as one of the authors of this<br />
scheme, I have never understood why anybody should object to<br />
it. ( Applause) And I am perfectly certain that 90 per cent.<br />
of the people of Australia warmly approve of it. ( Applause)<br />
My Lord Bishop and the Principal have both<br />
mentioned a stum of money. 51e11, the last word that was given<br />
to me on this matter yesterday was that the total completed<br />
cost of the science block and equipment had not yet been<br />
ascertained and that when they were, no doubt there would be<br />
a further sum to be handed over. ( Applause)<br />
Now I dontt need to discuss with you the<br />
reasons, ladies and gentlemen, for these measures to encourage<br />
scientific study; Ild rather prefer today to say something<br />
to the boys. You grown-up people and parents, you can listen<br />
in but most of you are really beyond being helped on these<br />
matters. ( Laughter) I'd like to talk to the boys, if they<br />
don't mind. I want to tell them that when I was a schoolboy<br />
I used to regard all well-known politicians who came to the<br />
speech nights as the most intolerable bores ( Laughter) and<br />
threItore they are at complete liberty to count me out. I<br />
assure them that I am an expert at receiving such compliments.<br />
( Laughter) I just want to say two things to you. The<br />
first is that this story, this piece of history about Father<br />
Slattery and the work he did here, deserves to be known by<br />
everybody in this country. It is part of a marvellous tradition<br />
in your school and a great school is not merely created by<br />
bricks and mortar or by having a lot of money or even by getting<br />
a lot of boys to attend.<br />
The greatness of a school depends on its quality<br />
and its quality depends, to a very large degree, on the men<br />
who have fashioned it. Some of them today are boys, but<br />
tomorrow they will be adults and taking their place in the<br />
iw. orld and helping to fashion the world and perhaps helping<br />
once more to fashion the school.<br />
It is a wonderful thing to have a-tradition.<br />
But we must never be bound by tradition. WIe must never become<br />
so traditional that we are unavailable to fresh ideas, Not<br />
at all, But a tradition that serves to inspire you for the<br />
future by reminding you of the efforts and achievements of the<br />
past, this is of the very essence of a great school and you<br />
have it here, and particularly on the science side In this new<br />
building with its new equipment there will be every reason to<br />
remember that one of the great scientists? scientific workers<br />
or his time was here in this school and did this memorable<br />
work. Therefore be proud of it and make up your minds that<br />
you, yourselves, will contribute to it in due course, $ 69/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
The second thing I want to say to you is this.<br />
Several times already today, I have had occasion to mention<br />
the fact that the explorers came over the lip of the mountains<br />
and discovered these -plains and that from this very place, there<br />
went out at least five of the greatest explorers we have known<br />
in Australia. These are very stimulating memories. Much to be<br />
learned from them, Much to be retained by thinking of them.<br />
But they were concerned at that time, and properly concerned,<br />
with extending the bounds of settlement. They were extending<br />
physical boundaries in a sense, they were opening up country<br />
that was a mere dream before and enabling people to live in it<br />
and to grow in it and to have families in it and to enjoy the<br />
fruits of the earth and to add to them. This was a great piece<br />
of pioneering in that sense, extending the frontiers of the<br />
eye, extending the frontiers of settlement,<br />
But in this new wing those of you who are students<br />
of science will be put on your way to extend the frontiers of<br />
knowledge, the frontiers of scientific knowledge, and therefore<br />
I don't want you to become pompous like an old politician but<br />
please remember that in that sense every one of you who tackles<br />
it seriously and does his best will be just as much a pioneer<br />
in his own fashion as these old men with beards who came over<br />
here so long ago and began to extend the frontiers of ci ,-lised<br />
settlement. To extend the frontiers of knowledge is not only<br />
our privilege, but it is our duty. None of us must ever be<br />
content merely by learning what somebody else has discovered.<br />
14e must do our best to think about it, to discover something<br />
ourselves. You won't all be able to think of some new and<br />
brilliant conception in the scientific world but you may very<br />
well be able to think of some way of applying a piece of<br />
scientific knowledge in a new way for the service of mankind<br />
and in that way you wiil have e. xtended the frontiers of knowledge.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, turning to you I must<br />
say that I hope we will all encourage these ideas. ' le have, in<br />
Australia, with al~ l our privileges because we are a privileged<br />
people, a prosperous people a great obligation not just to<br />
ourselves but to other people not so privileged, not so prosperous<br />
around the world and if we are to honour that obligation, v* re<br />
can't just be satisfied to think we will do it by providing some<br />
money, We will do it to the best extent by providing them with<br />
the results of our work and our knowledge of our achievement.<br />
There is hardly a problem you can think of today, looking around<br />
the world, problems of population, problems of hungry millions,<br />
problems of all kinds, that does not involve the more and more<br />
scientific use of resources to bring to them such skill such<br />
scientific knowledge as we have in the fields of arriculture and<br />
in dealing with cattle, in dealing with the whole problem of<br />
food, in dealing with production for their own needs, It is in<br />
these fields that we, the happy and the privileged, have a great<br />
opportunity of making a powerful contribution, and the contribution<br />
will start here. Itwill be encouraged, it will grow more<br />
and more rapidly if all of us who are older and who profess to<br />
have scientific knowledge constantly encourage these ideas and<br />
determine to make some sacrifices ourselves to bring them into<br />
fruition* to . S/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Now I hope, boys, that hasn't been too heavy.<br />
After all, if you can stand a man lecturing to you on<br />
logarithms, you can put up with me with the greatest ease<br />
in the world. ( Laughter) At least I think so, looking back<br />
over my own life.<br />
Now, Sir, I dontt want to say any more than that.<br />
It is a very great privilege to be here. I regret deeply that<br />
my wife couldn't be with me but I am happy to report she is<br />
doing very well, making a good recovery, ( Applause)<br />
I therefore give myself the pleasure, and the<br />
honour, of declaring this block open. Now I think I remember<br />
that I have to unveil a plaque. Is that right? , Tell I will<br />
do it.<br />
