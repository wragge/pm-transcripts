PRIME MINIISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 24 MARCH 1979<br />
EXTRACT FROM SPEECH AT<br />
NSW YOUNG LIBERALS AND NSW SENATORS' COCKTAIL PARTY<br />
The Young Liberal Movement has a vital role to play in providing<br />
the training ground and support for the future leaders of this<br />
State and Australia as a whole. In addition, it's contribution<br />
to policy formulation is well known and highly valued, especially<br />
where there are issues of special concern to young people.<br />
The Young Liberals played a big part in the Government's decision<br />
to establish the Office of Youth Affairs, and has taken a keen<br />
interest in its operation ever since. It also made important<br />
representations to the Government, just prior to the recent<br />
formation of the new Department of Employment and Youth Affairs<br />
under Ian Viner.<br />
I know the Young Liberals' interest will continue to be of<br />
invaluable assistance to the Government in this and other<br />
areas. In ways such as these, the Young Liberal Movement is<br />
playing an important part in Federal and State political affairs.<br />
The benefits the Government receives from New South Wales<br />
doesn't stop there. In the Federal Parliament we are fortunate<br />
to have Senators of the calibre of Senator Carrick, Senator Baume,<br />
Senator Lajovic, and Senator Puplick. Their efforts, both within<br />
the Ministry and in the Senate itself, have in no small way<br />
enabled the Government to achieve the progress it has.<br />
And we have achieved progress, despite the attempts of Bill Hayden,<br />
that prophet of doom and gloom, to talk down our successes.<br />
Inflation has been reduced; business confidence has returned;<br />
investment has increased dramatically; large developments are<br />
in the offing, and Australian businesses are once again competitive.<br />
The employment situation is of continuing concern to us, but it<br />
is only by pursuing our firm commitment to beating inflation will<br />
there be jobs for all those that want them. Already there are<br />
heartening signs of improvement in the labour market. Civilian<br />
employment, seasonally adjusted, has been rising. overtime is<br />
now over three hours a week per employee, seasonally adjusted,<br />
the first time this has happened since 1974. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
These are early signs, but they are encouraging. We alihave a<br />
responsibility to see that our policies and our achievements are<br />
placed before the people of Australia and understood by them so<br />
that Australians will never again let their affairs be managed<br />
by those political and economic bankrupts who were in Government<br />
between 1972 and 1975. And we must not forget that Australia's<br />
State Socialist governments are still putting forward the same<br />
irresponsible policies.<br />
The Wran government has decided that thousands of power workers<br />
in this State will have a 37 hour week. The State industrial<br />
Commission denied the Commonwealth the opportunity to put, forward<br />
the national consequences of granting these new conditions.<br />
The Wran government seeks to achieve the 37 2 hour week by<br />
legislating arbitrarily and capriciously, without awaiting<br />
Q the Industrial Commission's decision. This is totally against<br />
the national interest. With a large majority in the State<br />
Parliament, Labor's true Socialist colours are now showing<br />
through. The extreme left in New South Wales is demonstrating<br />
its power. Inevitably, the decision will create demands for<br />
flow-ons, will add to labour costs, and lead to inflationary<br />
pressures, and can only put Australians out of work.<br />
If there are productivity gains in the industry, they should be<br />
used in the battle against inflation. They should be passed on<br />
in lower prices to the home owners and industries of this State.<br />
The Commonwealth condemns the Wran government's irresponsible<br />
action. The States now receive Commonwealth funds under<br />
guarantee provisions that give them protection against wage<br />
increases. We will not continue to support by way of guarantee<br />
a system of State funding which is used to underwrite such wage<br />
increases by providing automatic adjustments for changes in the<br />
average level of Australian wage increases.<br />
Mr Wran's government can increase its wage bill but not have to<br />
meet the whole cost itself, because it automatically gets more<br />
funds from the Commonwealth. We shall be taking this up at. the<br />
next Premieres Conference. We cannot and we will not ig~ nore<br />
this irresponsible action by the Wran government. </p>
