PRIME MINISTER 131/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
MARKS ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
The Marks Royal Commission was unable to rise above its poisoned origins.<br />
It was conceived In political malice. It was constituted with extravagance and<br />
partiality. Consequently, it will be remembered, If at all, for the disrepute Into<br />
which it has brought Royal Commissions as a proper and relevant institution<br />
In Australian public life. And its findings will be rejected by all fair minded<br />
people. Because the Royal Commission was conceived as an act of political<br />
malevolence by the Court Government, aided and abetted by John Howard<br />
and the Federal Coalition, basic principles of natural justice were ignored at<br />
the very outset.<br />
The terms of reference were deliberately narrow. They were drawn up to put<br />
Dr Lawrence and the Labor Party on trial, while excluding from scrutiny the<br />
actions of Premier Court and his colleagues, who were the first to make a<br />
public issue of the private affairs of Penny Easton and her husband. This set<br />
the tone for what followed.<br />
In Perth, the Court Government was prepared to spend millions of dollars of<br />
Western Australian taxpayers' money and to array the full force of the<br />
executive power of the state against one decent woman.<br />
In Canberra, John Howard and the Federal Opposition, having connived in<br />
the establishment of the Royal Commission, launched a vicious political<br />
onslaught against Carmen Lawrence. Long before it was over, they<br />
clamoured for her resignation and dismissal.<br />
They defamed her in Parliament in the most disgraceful manner. With the sly<br />
encouragement of John Howard, Messrs Wooldridge and Tuckey and Mrs<br />
Bishop accused her of causing Penny Easton's death.<br />
In one ten day period in August, 31 of 37 Opposition questions without notice<br />
to the Government In the House of Representatives concerned the Easton<br />
affair. </p>
<p>In this period, John Howard asked 13 questions about it and did not ask a<br />
single question about anything else, When I and the government defended<br />
Dr Lawrence, the Opposition tried to silence us with bogus appeals to the sub<br />
judice principle.<br />
When the government was obliged to safeguard the fundamental principles<br />
Involved and to enable Dr Lawrence to defend herself before the Royal<br />
Commission, the Opposition sought, and is still seeking, to prevent this<br />
elementary expression of natural justice.<br />
Their behaviour throughout has been contemptible.<br />
Premier Court continues to claim that the Commission was set up " to<br />
establish the truth in relation to these serious matters". But the narrow terms<br />
of reference meant this was not possible.<br />
The fatal flaws and irrelevance of this Royal Commission are confirmed out of<br />
the Royal Commissioner's own mouth. He pointed to the restrictive nature of<br />
its terms of reference. He said that the sooner it came to an end the better.<br />
He said that its results would probably be open to doubt.<br />
In this he is absolutely right.<br />
Mr Marks even said that the experience had demonstrated that the<br />
usefulness of Royal Commissions was fast receding.<br />
While the Government agrees with the Royal Commissioners implicit<br />
judgment of the value of his own Royal Commission, we continue to believe<br />
that there is a proper role for Royal Commissions, where they deal with<br />
appropriate matters of public importance, are constituted properly and have<br />
relevant terms of reference.<br />
In this regard, the establishment of this Royal Commission was unique and<br />
uniquely disreputable. It will stand as an example of the lack of principle,<br />
propriety and decency of the Court Government and John Howard's Liberal<br />
Party. I continue to have complete confidence in Carmen Lawrence and look<br />
forward to her continued role as a senior and valued member of the<br />
Government. CANBERRA 14 November 1995 </p>
