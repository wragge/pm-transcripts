    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>The major story of the morning is clearly the fate of the two CARE</p>
<p> Australia workers in Yugoslavia who now, I understand, have been formally</p>
<p> charged with spying  a most serious fate for them. Have you</p>
<p> spoken to Mr Fraser this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, Mr Downer, the Foreign Minister, has been, I understand, in regular</p>
<p> contact with Mr Fraser. I wish him well and he's naturally concerned</p>
<p> as the Chairman of CARE about the fate of these two men. The charges</p>
<p> against them are quite preposterous. The Foreign Minister's made</p>
<p> it very clear there's no substance in them. They are both humanitarian</p>
<p> workers. They come from a non-combatant country. They aren't</p>
<p> combatants themselves. So according to the normal rules of civilised</p>
<p> conduct between nations they ought to be let go. At the very least</p>
<p> they should have proper consular access and advice, proper legal advice.</p>
<p> I can understand how despairing and in a state of anguish their families</p>
<p> must be. And I want the members of their families to know that the</p>
<p> Australian Government is doing all it humanly can to secure their</p>
<p> release at the very least to see that they get proper treatment inside</p>
<p> Yugoslavia. I mean, they are innocent victims. They were there to</p>
<p> help the people of Yugoslavia without discrimination and it's</p>
<p> always particularly tragic and upsetting when people who are doing</p>
<p> the right thing by humanity are caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>It's a bit difficult for the Australian Government, on a government</p>
<p> to government basis, to do much here, isn't it? I mean, is Mr</p>
<p> Fraser our best hope?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he certainly carries with him the weight of being the Chairman</p>
<p> of CARE and, as a former Prime Minister, he also carries that weight</p>
<p> and that authority. He's trying and he's getting every assistance</p>
<p> from us. He, of course, is at pains to make it clear that CARE is</p>
<p> taking a completely apolitical stance. And it's important that</p>
<p> he not be pressed to comment upon the rights or wrongs of the political</p>
<p> dispute involved because his overriding objective is to secure the</p>
<p> safety and hopefully the release of these two men.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>You'd have to be less than optimistic at the current rate of</p>
<p> progress, wouldn't you? I see Mr Fraser this morning was expressing</p>
<p> severe doubts that he would, in fact, even get a visa to go to Belgrade.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a very difficult situation but you have to remain optimistic</p>
<p> and you must keep trying and you must use every avenue available.</p>
<p> And some times, surprisingly, a breakthrough in something like this</p>
<p> can occur. But it is very difficult. We can but try every stratagem</p>
<p> available to us. We can but keep appealing to the Belgrade authorities</p>
<p> on behalf of these men and keep repeating the fact that they are not</p>
<p> there to do ill by the people of Yugoslavia, they are there to help</p>
<p> the people of Yugoslavia whether they're Kosovars or Serbians</p>
<p> or whatever. I mean, CARE is colour blind and politically blind when</p>
<p> it comes to helping suffering humanity and they're precisely</p>
<p> the sort of people who should not get caught up in this particular</p>
<p> conflict.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Just looking at the conflict  we are far away from it and I</p>
<p> know the Government has formally supported the NATO position on it.</p>
<p> We're not involved in it in that sense other than as a care and</p>
<p> relief basis. But reflecting that, do you personally feel entirely</p>
<p> comfortable with the course of events as they've unfolded and</p>
<p> the likely course of events as they seem to be unfolding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The NATO countries had no alternative. The world was, in effect, saying,</p>
<p> particularly the European world, was saying we cannot sit idly by</p>
<p> and see racial persecution go on in Kosovo. Just think where we would</p>
<p> now be with fairly regular stories of atrocities in Kosovo, where</p>
<p> we would now be if NATO had not done anything. People would be saying:</p>
<p> why don't they do something, how can you sit by and allow this</p>
<p> to go on. That's the dilemma that democratic nations with a strong</p>
<p> military arsenal always face in a situation like this. If they don't</p>
<p> do anything they are accused of 1930s style inaction. If they do do</p>
<p> something then people say, well, what is your full game plan, what's</p>
<p> your exit strategy, where it's going to end? It's a difficult</p>
<p> dilemma. If you are a country that doesn't care about human rights</p>
<p> and you never express any critical comments about the discrimination</p>
<p> practised against people on the grounds of their ethnicity or their</p>
<p> race then you're spared the obligation of deciding whether you're</p>
<p> ever going to intervene. But the NATO countries, particularly the</p>
<p> United States and the United Kingdom and a number of other countries,</p>
<p> have always taken a properly high profile on human rights issues.</p>
<p> And when something like this comes up they face an awful choice. If</p>
<p> they don't do anything they are criticised for moral cowardice</p>
<p> and inaction. If they do do something then they are properly cross-examined</p>
<p> as to what the end result is and it's always a difficult choice.</p>
<p> And I certainly support the decision they've taken.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Air power's a comfortable measure, in a sense, because you don't</p>
<p> have ground troops there getting shot. But there's a substantial</p>
<p> public opinion, body of public opinion in Europe, particularly, which</p>
<p> says that maybe there should be ground troops there. Do you have a</p>
<p> view on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that ultimately has got to be a military assessment. I don't</p>
<p> think I can, from all this distance, without having available to me</p>
<p> all of the military intelligence briefings - obviously some but certainly</p>
<p> not all of them because we're not a combatant country and we're</p>
<p> not going to be a combatant country  but that is ultimately</p>
<p> a military assessment that will have to be made by the NATO leaders</p>
<p> according to the information they have. Certainly it's a difficult</p>
<p> ask but the bombardment must be having some effect on Belgrade's</p>
<p> military capacity, it must be having a very big effect.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Yep, all right, look let's turn to some other issues. The issue</p>
<p> of Australia's coastal surveillance  I know you've</p>
<p> set up a committee, a review committee headed by Max Moore-Wilton</p>
<p> in the Prime Minister's Department, to look at the state of Australia's</p>
<p> coastal surveillance. I note that the Northern Territory, perhaps</p>
<p> inevitably, are keen for you to improve the manning of military bases</p>
<p> in the north but putting to one side as perhaps being motivated by</p>
<p> self interest, really what can you do looking at your state of Australia's</p>
<p> coastline anyway?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's no way that any Prime Minister can guarantee that</p>
<p> a boat carrying illegal immigrants will never ever get through. Now,</p>
<p> you can't do that. What you can do is to examine whether the</p>
<p> current level is adequate enough, whether it can be improved within</p>
<p> the resources that can reasonably be made available. I know it's</p>
<p> very hard to persuade the public of this because we've had a</p>
<p> couple of very well publicised landings. We actually do have quite</p>
<p> a success rate in intercepting illegal immigration. Illegal immigration</p>
<p> like this is not alone an experience of Australia. There was quite</p>
<p> a spectacular example of this in New York harbour. I understand some</p>
<p> time last year that received a great deal of publicity.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>It's probably, in essence, a problem to be solved at source isn't</p>
<p> it? If the Chinese Government wants to encourage this we'll get</p>
<p> a whole lot more boats floating in.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is evidence that this is tied up with criminal activity and</p>
<p> that, of course, puts the responsibility on the source country and</p>
<p> the source country's government. Now, there are different ways</p>
<p> that we can try and tighten the situation and what I want this group</p>
<p> to do is to tell me whether there are some obvious gaps in the surveillance.</p>
<p> We'll know what happened in these two particular instances. We'll</p>
<p> have all the facts in relation to those and then we'll feed that</p>
<p> into this other investigation and they can tell me within a couple</p>
<p> of months whether there are things that can reasonably be done to</p>
<p> make it even tighter. But I'd say two things to the public. The</p>
<p> first is that we have had a pretty good success rate. Now, that's</p>
<p> cold comfort when you get a couple through but the other point I make</p>
<p> is that we have a huge coastline, a massive coastline. Few nations</p>
<p> on earth have the coastline Australia's got and, in fact, practically</p>
<p> no country on earth faces quite the challenge we do in relation to</p>
<p> that. And you have to strike a balance between the level of surveillance</p>
<p> and the resources needed to provide incrementally more surveillance</p>
<p> but still impossibly to cover 100 per cent of the coastline all the</p>
<p> time.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>You could spend almost any amount of money I am sure.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>The New South Wales State election, you were involved in it, campaigned</p>
<p> for Kerry Chikarovski. She rang you up before she challenged Peter</p>
<p> Collins and you reportedly encouraged her to pursue her ambitions,</p>
<p> what went wrong for her?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as far as the challenge was concerned the decision for her to</p>
<p> challenge and for her to replace Peter Collins was taken by the State</p>
<p> parliamentary party.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>But you were encouraging Mrs Chikarovski weren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, look, I mean, there is no point in going over ancient history</p>
<p> but I do want to make the point that the decision to change leaders</p>
<p> was a decision entirely of the leadership of the State parliamentary</p>
<p> party. I don't deny that Kerry and I have known each other for</p>
<p> quite a while and I have quite a regard for her and I was certainly</p>
<p> happy to throw my lot in with her and to support her during the campaign.</p>
<p> And certainly when she spoke to me at the time of the leadership change,</p>
<p> as did Mr Collins, my position was well if the State parliamentary</p>
<p> party wants to change leaders that's it. And they decided it,</p>
<p> I didn't decide it and the party organisation didn't decide</p>
<p> it. Now, that is now behind us. I was disappointed in the result.</p>
<p> I don't think the State parliamentary party did enough policy</p>
<p> work over the four year period that they were in opposition. You can't</p>
<p> win elections unless you present an identifiable alternative.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>They had a big alternative though didn't they in terms of the</p>
<p> power privatisation sell-off it was a centrepiece policy, it was going</p>
<p> to do big things. It was going to eliminate the State's debt</p>
<p> and provide a massive fund by way of foregone interest payments and</p>
<p> so on to provide a whole lot of the sort of infrastructure which State</p>
<p> governments can provide  hospitals, schools and all of that.</p>
<p> It was a very big policy and it was out there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It came rather late in the piece and they seemed to stop talking about</p>
<p> it which was an error.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>I mean, they probably stopped talking about it because of the lack</p>
<p> of public support for it, wasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's a chicken and egg, if you stop talking about something</p>
<p> you'll never get public support for it. I have talked about a</p>
<p> lot of things in my political career that didn't have much public</p>
<p> support when I first started talking about...there wasn't</p>
<p> a lot of public support.....</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>But to use one of your phrases, they didn't have enough ticker'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I used that in relation to another election and another political</p>
<p> leader and I think it uniquely fits those circumstances. But they</p>
<p> didn't establish a clear alternative policy profile over the</p>
<p> four year period. You do, despite all the talk there is about public</p>
<p> relations and all the talk there is abut campaign techniques and all</p>
<p> of those things are important, in the end however the public will</p>
<p> vote for a change of government if they believe there is a satisfactory</p>
<p> alternative. They took the judgement in New South Wales, and it's</p>
<p> a harsh thing for me to say but we have got to be realistic, that</p>
<p> there wasn't a sufficiently identifiable clear alternative. Now,</p>
<p> the New South Wales parliamentary party recognises that. It's</p>
<p> now got four years of hard work ahead of it. Now, there's no</p>
<p> alternative to that. I have been through opposition federally I know</p>
<p> how hard it is and I also know the price you pay if you don't</p>
<p> develop policy alternatives. People are less rusted on to their...to</p>
<p> political parties these days. There are far more swing voters, there</p>
<p> are far fewer people now who say, I am voting Labor because dad voted</p>
<p> Labor or I have always voted Liberal. I mean, there is still a lot</p>
<p> of those on both sides but there is a lot of people in the middle</p>
<p> now who will have a look and say, well, I don't like the job</p>
<p> Carr's done but I am not satisfied with the Libs or a good alternative</p>
<p> or, you know, hopefully over a period of time they'll say, well,</p>
<p> the Liberal Party in New South Wales is really working hard now and</p>
<p> it's got some identifiable policies, I'll give them a go</p>
<p> even though I might have a different view federally. The other thing</p>
<p> you have got to remember is that people do vote differently in federal</p>
<p> and state elections and that has particularly been the history of</p>
<p> New South Wales. You look over the last 20 years you have had quite</p>
<p> a clear pattern of people often voting strongly federally for the</p>
<p> Liberal Party but not so strongly at a state level.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>One of the lessons that might have been learnt from the State campaign,</p>
<p> at least the Nationals appear to have learnt this, they have dropped</p>
<p> privatisation of the State's power industry as a policy formally.</p>
<p> They've said it is not part of their policy any more, they don't</p>
<p> support it. It wasn't...it didn't enjoy if you believe</p>
<p> any poll that was ever published, it didn't enjoy any public</p>
<p> support either. Some may say that one of the lessons is that privatisation</p>
<p> is on the nose that the Federal Government should learn....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't agree with that.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>....the Federal Government should learn that lesson with its plans</p>
<p> to sell Telstra. You don't accept that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. I don't agree with that. Well, we have won</p>
<p> two elections with firstly to part privatisation and then the full</p>
<p> privatisation of Telstra as a key policy. Not the most important policy</p>
<p> by any means but as a policy. I don't believe that privatisation</p>
<p> was a reason why the Liberal Party lost the last State election, I</p>
<p> don't believe that for a moment. If that were the case then somebody</p>
<p> like Peter Blackmore who lost the seat of Maitland fairly narrowly</p>
<p> in the end would have lost it a lot more heavily and there perhaps</p>
<p> might have been a different result in some of the seats on the Central</p>
<p> Coast of New South Wales. I don't think you can find any particular</p>
<p> pattern. Look, the result was predominantly due, in my opinion, to</p>
<p> just an overall assessment....</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Bad campaigning, should Remo Nogarotto go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no I don't believe in chopping organisational heads off.</p>
<p> People can criticise the campaign and that will be done by the party</p>
<p> organisation. I am not going to engage in some kind of public post-mortem</p>
<p> on the campaign. When you lose it's legitimate to have a look</p>
<p> at everything and it's also obligatory on all the participants</p>
<p> when you lose to share the blame and not, sort of, cast around for</p>
<p> scapegoats and say it's his fault more than my fault or anything</p>
<p> like that. You have just got to be realistic. And the public expects</p>
<p> the Coalition in New South Wales to get their heads down and to work</p>
<p> very hard to establish themselves as a strong alternative and I believe</p>
<p> that Kerry Chikarovski and George Souris will do that. And it's</p>
<p> in their interests and the interests of the government of this State</p>
<p> that that happen.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>The GST, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The States are all signed up.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Time's running out isn't it? In June, the Democrats will</p>
<p> control the Senate after that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're coming to the moment of decision.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, we are. It's crunch time. It's the pointy end</p>
<p> of the pineapple time. Is there going to be any increase to the compensation</p>
<p> package, and are there any second thoughts about including food in</p>
<p> the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are certainly no second thoughts about including food,</p>
<p> and all of the evidence, including most recently from Neil Warren</p>
<p> and Ann Harding who have been quoted against us on this subject by</p>
<p> the Labor Party is that food should stay in. Could I make the point</p>
<p> that you now have every Premier and every Chief Minister of Australia,</p>
<p> Labor and Liberal alike signed up to the GST.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Yeah but the person you really need to sign up is Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know, but the fact that the Senate is meant to be in theory, all</p>
<p> though in practice it's not, the States' House, and you've</p>
<p> got all of the Premiers saying the GST is good for us and good for</p>
<p> the people who we represent, ought to weigh on the minds not only</p>
<p> of Senator Harradine but also of the Labor Senators. There's</p>
<p> a tendency to let the Labor Party off the hook, and the Democrats</p>
<p> off the hook merely by focusing in Brian Harradine. But surely the</p>
<p> Labor Party Senators from New South Wales should take notice of what</p>
<p> Bob Carr has said. I mean Bob Carr is the most successful Labor leader</p>
<p> in Australia at present by far. And he's saying the GST is good</p>
<p> for the people of New South Wales and....</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>I don't think Senator Faulkner's suddenly going to turn.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Senator Faulkner and others ought to think of the consequences</p>
<p> of knocking this back for the people of New South Wales.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Are you going to offer Senator Harradine any more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine will make his decision, and one thing I know about</p>
<p> Senator Harradine is that engaging in public dialogue about his attitudes</p>
<p> is never helpful. He's a person who likes to be given time to</p>
<p> make up his own mind. He doesn't appreciate gratuitous public</p>
<p> advice and I've never engaged in giving it to him. If he's</p>
<p> got some views to put to me then he will undoubtedly do so. I hope</p>
<p> in the end he will respect the mandate that we received from the Australian</p>
<p> people last October.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>Is there any money in the back pocket for him though? I don't</p>
<p> mean a [inaudible] way but by way of assistance to Tasmania.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All of that invites me to do the very thing that I said 30 seconds</p>
<p> ago, I'm not going to do. We have a very simple position. The</p>
<p> public voted for this. We exposed it to the public. No government</p>
<p> in Australian history has been more frank and up front and explicit</p>
<p> about a serious economic policy change and we were about that tax.</p>
<p>CLARK:</p>
<p>When's it coming into the Parliament for a vote?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's in the Senate now and the debate in the Senate will</p>
<p> commenc</p>
