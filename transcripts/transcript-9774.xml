    <content><![CDATA[<p>TEL ELO: c2t 95<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />ADDRESS TO THE NSW ALP CONFERENCE, SYDNEY TOWN HALL<br />SEPTEMBER 1995<br />E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />Well, thanks very much for a very enthusiastic welcome I appreciate It. I<br />think it's our about 106th Conference, and we do keep keeping on here we<br />do keep keeping on. But Terry, Chris, Della, Anthony, my Parliamentary<br />colleagues and friends one and all. I am very pleased to be back here I<br />started my political life here all those years ago at a Conference in the early<br />1960s. And 30 years later we are still running Australia we have a national<br />Government, and a Labor Government in NSW. And this Parliament, these 3<br />years, arguably, have been our most valuable. When we won In 1993, and<br />we stuck itto the Tories in the sweetest victory of all, we opened up an<br />opportunity for ourselves and for Australia that consolidated the work and the<br />gains and the imagination of the 1980s. We have consolidated the recovery<br />to now the longest growth phase in Australia's post-War history. The next<br />national accounts will be the 17th consecutive quarter of growth a national<br />record. We have returned the economy to strong job growth we have had,<br />since the election, 680,000 jobs. And I said recently it took us from 1788 to<br />1983 to get to 6 million, and we have added 10% to that in 2 1/ 2 years. It's<br />way beyond our commitment of half a million we reached that, in fact, after 2<br />1/ 4 years. And in this process of consolidated growth, and strong job growth,<br />we have consolidated low inflation we have an inflation rate around 2 3%,<br />after the Tories, of course, couldn't' get it under double digits. So we have<br />fulfilled, I think, the most solemn pledge we made at that election, which was<br />all about growth and employment. And that pledge was to get the economy<br />back to growth, to pull dlown unemployment to not leave the unemployed<br />behind. They were the solemn commitments the hardest to meet, and they<br />are the ones we have met the most. As I say, we have done it all by breaking<br />the back of that pernicious disease Australian inflation and done it in a<br />way, also, which now has the current account deficit trending down.<br />Three months ago, of course, it was turning at $ 3 billion, and we had all the<br />hand-wringing, and the Liberals with their debt truck and the rest yesterday<br />it came in at $ 1.5 billion, half of what it was 2 months ago, and below the<br />: 20 No. 001 P. 01/ 16</p>
<p>TEL 2<br />figure of just over $ 2 billion the previous month. So, we have got it trending<br />down. Not in 12 years have we faced a better scenario 4% GDP growth, 4%<br />employment growth, 2-3% inflation, the Current Account trending down, and<br />exports booming. And we have been given the time for the transition to a<br />new labour market. In these 3 years, Laurie Brereton Introduced the new IR<br />legislation, and we have made that change from the most centralised of wage<br />fixing systems, to, now, an organic one where the only place out there in the<br />market place the only place where our unions will survive, the only place<br />where they will have the opportunity to go and do the things they need to do<br />to represent their members, and not be held hostage to some Conservative<br />Government of the future at whatever time it wants to put a knife through the<br />heart of the centralised wage fixing system. We have built a labour market<br />that keeps our competitiveness, keeps the jobs coming, keeps inflation low.<br />And while we have been doing all of that, we have moved the Budget back to<br />surplus, we dramatically expanded superannuation so that all of us will have<br />a better standard of living in retirement. By the year 2002 which is just 7<br />years away every Australian person will have 15% minimum savings in<br />superannuation, which will dramatically increase their benefits In retirement,<br />and while doing it, produce a huge pool of national savings which will<br />underpin a much higher level of investment in Australia, and lower our<br />reliance upon overseas savings and overseas debt.<br />And to underline these achievements to cap them off, to finish them off, to<br />polish them off we have strengthened our identity in our culture. We have<br />righted the wrong of terra nulus with our indigenes, we have given them<br />back that part of the remaining land that was always theirs, we built a<br />relationship of quality and trust with the countries of the region, and a<br />relationship which is without precedent In Australia, between Australia and<br />these places. We have threaded together the most ambitious free-trade<br />undertaking in the world, which is APEC, and we have laid down the blueprint<br />for an Australian republic. And we have done all of these things in 3 years<br />in less than 3 years. We have made Australia a country we can be proud of<br />we have made Australia the fairest Anglo-Saxon country in the world. And<br />this is what Labor Governments are all about: fairness, equity, imagination,<br />belief, faith. Faith in our fellow Australians, compassion for their lot in life,<br />belief in Australia. But now, at the brink of the century, there is one message<br />to come from that great achievement, and it is this: we can't go back.<br />Now we have got such momentum, we can't go back. Now we have made<br />Australia competitive and stronger, we can't go back. Now we have built a<br />social democracy and a social wage with equity, we can't go back. Now we<br />have got a Native Title Act, we can't go back. Now we have built a future in<br />Asia, we can't go back. Now we have mapped the path to the republic, we<br />can't go back. We can't go back to the Iniquity, or our past<br />uncompetitiveness, we can't go back the conflict, we can't go back to the<br />continental insularity, to the mono-culture, to the denial of truth about our<br />indigenes, to the monarchy. In short, we can't go back to the old Australia.<br />We can't go back to John Howard's Australia conservative Australia, the<br />Liberal's Australia. 2 Oct 95TEL: g. 2o No. U .~ t0 01 R .02/ 16</p>
<p>TEL: 2 ct 3: 201 N JO. CC1 F . u3<br />3<br />Now, this week was an interesting week in Australian public life. This week,<br />the real John Howard stood up. He didn't stand up voluntarily, and he didn't<br />stand up very straight. But he stood up just enough for Australians to see<br />him for the first time since he became leader again. And what did they see?<br />They saw the old John Howard the one we all know. The man who has<br />opposed every wage rise, bar one since 1978. The man who opposes<br />progressive legislation instinctively. Who opposed the Racial Discrimination<br />Act, who opposed sanctions on South Africa, who opposed the South Pacific<br />Nuclear Free Zone, who said in 1987 " Medicare is one of the great disasters<br />of this Government we will be proposing changes to Medicare that amounts<br />to its de facto dismantling". The man, who in the same year, wanted to reintroduce<br />racial discrimination into Australia's immigration policy. Privately,<br />Honest John says he wants a labour market with downward flexibility.<br />Publicly, Honest John says he just wants a flexible labour market. Yet, at the<br />same time he champions his other article of faith the family. " I'm pro-family",<br />he says as if the rest of us, of course, were anti-family. But he's pro-family,<br />and anti-overtime rates. Pro-family, and anti-penalty rates. Pro-family, and<br />anti-award. Pro-family, and anti-breadwinner. Pro-family, and pro-take-the--<br />contract-or-take-the-sack. Pro-family, and pro-knocking tens of billions out of<br />Government programs which go to support Australian families. John Howard<br />is pro-family, and anti-family support. He is pro-family, and anti-fairness.<br />John Howard has a curious concept of choice we noticed it this week with<br />industrial relations. The downward flexibility he favours, he wants us to<br />construe as choice. And in fact, the choice he talks about will prove to be a<br />denial of choice, as it is already happening under legislation in Victoria, and<br />in legislation in Western Australia. There was the case this week of a<br />librarian in Melbourne, under the old Victorian state award. After years of<br />commuting, she saw a job advertised closer to home. She phoned the<br />employer, and found that the work is identical to her current position. Then<br />she discovered the difference in the salary her current salary was $ 35,000.<br />The salary for the new position because the old state award had been<br />abolished by Jeff Kennett was $ 19,000. So, she was forced to stay where<br />she was. That's the choice that John Howard talks about. And in that choice,<br />of course, it makes very clear that person is going to be stuck there is not<br />going to be mobility or flexibility, but stuck and not able to make the move<br />away. Now, he has never done the right thing, and he has never done the hard<br />things. In the 80s he let himself be buffered around by the heavies of the<br />New Right. He picked up their rhetoric, after formerly trying to make himself<br />up as some sort of cuddly person in the moderate parts of the Liberal Party.<br />But he ended up with the heavies of the New Right, and trying to buy votes<br />with a discriminatory immigration policy. He has always been weak he can<br />sound forcible, but he is never strong, and he is never principled. Now, let<br />me just give you a couple of quotes this week about Mascot airport, because<br />it is not so much the issue of the airport it's what it means In terms of where<br />he would lead Australia. He says all the time the greatest priority that faces<br />the Government at the present time in the national economy in the national<br />interests is to " re-ignite the process of micro-economic reform". He says,</p>
<p>EL: . Oct , Z 1' 1 U'Ouii P .0j4/ i<br />4<br />" the Coalition Government will revitalise the micro-economic process. It<br />might be boring to many, but any Government Interested in this country's<br />economic future and jobs for its people must get on with the task of improving<br />its efficiency. The better we are, the better off we will be", he says. As one of<br />its first tasks, he says he will have a Productivity Commission, which will carry<br />out a stock-take on the progress of micro-economic reform. There will be<br />particular areas of emphasis which will impact on Australia's international<br />competitiveness, as well as a timetable for decision-making and<br />implementation. In other words, he is the one he says will crack all the tough<br />nuts that Labor, he says, won't touch. Such as the waterfront, such as the<br />labour market, such as shipping and transport, such as these things.<br />But when it comes to the biggest micro-economic change in air transport in<br />Australia that is the third runway at Mascot airport, he is now slipping back<br />saying he wants to cut its capacity by 35%, and he wants to make in<br />inherently unsafe. But this is after he said these things about it he said this<br />in a press release, which I have from 1989: " in the interests of safety, airport<br />facilities should be upgraded immediately, including the construction of a<br />third runway. The Government is playing carelessly with a situation that<br />could too easily result in a major tragedy this risk must be averted." This is<br />on his press release. And it goes on in that vein. He said this In a number of<br />other places he has made it clear across the way. And when asked on radio<br />in the same year, he said this talking about noise: " Many people get less<br />because you will have the north-south pattern. I think the case for it, on<br />general interest grounds, is absolutely overwhelming. Our policy is to build it,<br />that's been our policy for the past 6 1/ 2 years". In other words, he says it will<br />be better, it will be safer for the airport to be configured this way it will lift its<br />capacity, and it is a major micro-economic change. But now, the same microreformer<br />that has urged Labor to do another hard thing as we have done on<br />the waterfront, in shipping, in telecommunications, in deregulating the airline<br />system, in infrastructure such as the third runway he now says for a few<br />miserable votes in Bennelong, he will move backwards. He will move<br />backwards. He will move backwards away from the task that he knows has to<br />continue. Whether it's in ports and wharves, or electricity, or gas, or water, or<br />any of the things that will determine our competitiveness, he is moving back.<br />But listen to this for humbug, and he said this in the Parliament in 1981, " what<br />makes what this Government has done so criminally irresponsible", and he Is<br />talking here about the runway, about Mascot, " as criminally irresponsible in a<br />political sense, is that all along it has known the right thing to do. It's one<br />thing to be invincibly ignorant about the correct economic prescription, It's an<br />infinitely more culpable thing to know what the right thing is, and to<br />conscientiously pursue that course of action in the name of political<br />expediency and political opportunism". In other words, he is doing the very<br />thing now that he was upbraiding other people alleging that other people<br />did then. Yet this is the person who is going to run the new Australian<br />agenda. The person who is going to be the hard man, who breaks the microeconomic<br />log-jam. First bit of pressure, and he goes to water. And where's<br />the pressure? In a seat he has held for 20 years. He has got a margin of<br />3.5% 1 he is running for Prime Minister, but he thinks he mightn't hold his seat.<br />Oh; he's got a big ticker a big ticker. And he said oh no, look, it's all about</p>
<p>[ ELL O. Ct 5 3: 2U No . Cj01 F. 05,-16<br />Lowe. But, of course, the noise in Lowe comes across the back end of the<br />electorate he knows it's all about Bennelong. And here he is, he's out there<br />saying I can lead you to a better Australia, I can break the log-jams, I can<br />bring the new age in, but I had better shore up my own seat. I had better get<br />around. But, of course, the other thing, can I say he is completely at odds with the<br />interests of the people from rural NSW. And just let me give you a couple of<br />instincts about this. If we force Mascot back by 35%, there's no way all of the<br />commuter aircraft can come to Sydney. They will have to hub somewhere,<br />and then come they will have to hub into bigger planes. We won't have 8-<br />seaters, and 12-seaters and 20-seaters they will have to hub into big<br />planes. So, if I give you an example: from Dubbo, it now takes 55 minutes<br />on Hazelton Airlines. If they have to hub through Orange, it will take 1 hour<br />minutes. It costs $ 3.36 now, it will cost $ 436. From Parkes, it takes<br />minutes. If they have to hub through Orange, it will take 1 hour and<br />minutes. And let me give the example of Port Macquarie Port Macquarie<br />direct now is 55 minutes, hubbing through Newcastle on Eastern Airlines, It<br />will take 1 hour and 50 minutes. It now costs $ 348, it will cost $ 470. Albury<br />on Kendall Airlines takes 1 hour 10 minutes now. Hubbing through Canberra<br />it will take 2 hours and 15 minutes it's now $ 432, it will be $ 528. And<br />Narrandera which comes via Hazelton is 1 hour 20 minutes. Hubbing<br />through Wagga will take 2 hours and 5 minutes. It's now $ 396, it will be<br />$ 490. 1 mean, that's what he is doing to country NSW he is going to punish<br />it, he is going to remove their access to our capital city, he is going to do It all<br />in the name of a bit of sly politics for a change which he has always himself<br />supported all those years ago, for all those many years.<br />Now, this is the John Howard who believes that he can dupe the public, that<br />he can explain to people see, he is from the John Carrick school of politics.<br />That is, say a thing often enough, say it with meaning, look serious, keep<br />repeating the lie, and you have got a good chance of getting away with it.<br />Let me say a few things more about his industrial relations policies. He says<br />that people will be able to stay on their awards. But this belies an<br />understanding about the labour market, that 1.7 million take new jobs or<br />change jobs every year. That in a 3 year life of an Australian Parliament 3<br />years 43% of jobs change. Every time they change, those people lose the<br />award protections. All the young people coming out of universities into the<br />labour market for the first time, lose the award protections. The women<br />joining the workforce won't have the award protection. Migrants joining the<br />workforce won't have the award protections. So much so, all of those things<br />will change. And then he says that he will have some sort of disadvantage<br />test, but not the no-disadvantage test. Not the one that says you can trade in<br />or cash-out overtime, penalty rates or holiday leave loading, but you must get<br />something for it. You can trade them away to make the enterprise more<br />flexible, to make the work hours more flexible, but the total package must not<br />be a disadvantage for the employee, and there is a test which is applied<br />through our federalised institutions. He won't do that. Nor will he say that<br />there is some community standards like sick leave and maternity leave etc</p>
<p>TEL: 2 UCt u Iio 001 F'. U6 It!<br />6<br />which won't be traded away, and shouldn't be traded away. He wants, of<br />course, flexibility downwards, and there will be no disadvantage tests. Now<br />what this means to the people in the workforce like, for instance nurses who<br />would lose about 22% a year by losing overtime and penalty rates, about<br />$ 5000 a year, truck-drivers who would probably lose the better part of about<br />$ 6000 a year on the same basis you can find all categories of people In this<br />labour market of ours who, basically, will be much worse off, without the<br />systems we have in place. And this Is the nearest we have ever got to a<br />permanent wages system. And the enterprise bargaining system where<br />people can go out, with the productivity of the business, split it between<br />profits and wages, and make themself better off, and make the company<br />stronger, and make the business stronger and for those who haven't got that<br />strength, or that negotiation power, or that negotiating position, we have got<br />to say to you we have got a safety net, with safety net adjustments which<br />maintain their purchasing power, and give them increases in income. That's<br />the system we have in place it's the system he wants to junk.<br />But this is the man who will basically do anything to see this view of his this<br />religious view he has had about pushing wages down. The same fellow, of<br />course, who doesn't want an Australian as the Head of State. The same guy<br />as I said earlier who is opposed to the Native Title Bill. The same person<br />who, months ago, wouldn't see the political leader of Vietnam. Who hates<br />the Accord, but wants to keep the monarchy. Who wants to strip away those<br />award protections from the lowest paid, and create an army of working poor<br />to give us the American model for Australia. The failed Treasurer, the failed<br />Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Party's third choice In this parliament.<br />The man who wants to be Prime Minister of Australia. The thing is we can't<br />go back.<br />This week, we saw the real John Howard the vaccillator, the opportunist,<br />that man without principles, the man without policies. The man who has<br />Honest John etched on the shingle out the front, and under it, " we trade<br />anything". Anything for a few votes. The national interest on aviation, and<br />micro-economic reform sold for a few votes in Bennelong. The national<br />interests in a relationship with Vietnam sold for a few votes in Marrickville.<br />And by the way, this week when he was sustaining his losses on Kingsford-<br />Smith airport, he went up around the press gallery he is now beavering<br />away in the press gallery and he told them that his Private Member's Bill of<br />Kingsford-Smith Airport was just a clever stunt a means of getting industrial<br />relations off the front page. Well, I thought an interesting example of tactics<br />devised after the battle yes, I have lost a leg, but you know, I meant to. It<br />was part of the strategy. But the more interesting point is why would he<br />want to move industrial relations off the front page? If he Is running around<br />telling journalists that he has moved his stunt Private Members Bill on<br />Kingsford-Smith, why would he want to remove industrial relations off the<br />front page? And the answer is easy and that is, because everyone knows<br />that on industrial relations, John Howard has never changed that it will still<br />define him, that he is determined to got his way and to cut wages back.</p>
<p>TEL: 2. Oct. 95 3: 20j No. 001 PF. 07.16<br />7<br />So, we have seen him trading votes, and trading policies all week. The<br />principle and integrity of the institution of the Royal Commission which has<br />meant so much to Australia in years past, which we can see working here<br />now with the Police Royal Commission in NSW was sold for the votes that<br />Carmen Lawrence might win, and the Liberals might lose as they fail apart in<br />Western Australia. All of these things have always been his way. He has<br />never done the hard things, or the good things, he has only done things to<br />buy votes.<br />On the other hand, Labor sees our ( tape break)... replete with opportunities.<br />We have come a long way in the past decade, and a very long way in 3<br />years. But none of us believe that we have gone as far as we might, that the<br />job is over, or that the dream is fulfilled, but we are still doing things. And let<br />me just give you a few examples. On the environment this week on the<br />environment, we have got the largest process we have ever had under the<br />National Forest Policy Statement, the agreement between the Commonwealth<br />and the States we are now looking at deferred forest areas which will be put<br />away for 2 3 years for development of Regional Forest Agreements. Those<br />Regional Forest Agreements will have representative stands of trees<br />representative reserve systems, so we won't be arguing coupe by coupe,<br />compartment by compartment, logging company by logging company for each<br />group of trees that are taken from the forests. So, in other words, we will<br />have a mature system. And what is our standard? 15% of the native forests<br />which existed before European settlement that is about twice as much as<br />any comparable developed country has. Twice as much as the United<br />States, much more than Europe higher than any comparable country. And<br />we are now getting the cooperation of the State Departments of Forestry we<br />are bringing the States in partly because we told them last Christmas that if<br />they didn't, we would cut woodchips back by 20% a year to nothing. And so<br />they have come to the party Tasmania has signed up. You know our<br />Government in NSW didn't need signing up they are going to put a good<br />policy into place with the Commonwealth. And we are about to now, embark<br />upon a process where for 3 weeks we have left a draft in the market place for<br />the green groups, the environment movement and for the forest and paper<br />industries to look over, and to come back to the Cabinet, and where the<br />Cabinet will then settle on deferred forest areas. We will put them away, and<br />in the next 2 or 3 years we will have Regional Forest Agreements, and then<br />we can go on with a decent plantation and pulpwood industry taking regrowth<br />and some things from the native forests, but knowing that those great<br />forests of Australia will be protected, and the representative stands and<br />species will be there forever. Now, that's what we're doing. No Government<br />has ever attempted it that's what we are doing now.<br />But I noticed in today's Australian, someone had some wise words to say<br />about this process I'll just read you a couple if these things. It says in<br />demanding Federal and State Governments protect ever-Increasing areas of<br />old-growth forests, the environment movement may sacrifice its credibility,<br />and reinforce the image that it is insatiable. Without even glimpslng at the<br />draft proposals for the deferred forest areas yesterday, the environmental<br />alliance prepared a statement that condemned the outcome as diabolical. It</p>
<p>TEL: 2 Oct .95 3 : 20 NO 01 F 08/ 16<br />claimed forests such as East Gippsland in Victoria were going to be<br />destroyed that the situation in Victoria was catastrophic, only 2 catchment<br />areas would be protected. None of this is true. Years of campaigning has<br />won the movement far more than it is prepared to admit. In Victoria, where<br />some of the most detailed assessments have been carried out, the size of<br />national parks and reserves means additions of protected forests are likely to<br />be small". It goes on to say, " reserves in the Wombat State Forest will be<br />enlarged by 50%. Of box ironbark forests, spread throughout Victoria, an<br />extra 90,000 hectares is required to meet the Federal Government's<br />benchmarks. There will be 150,000 hectares available. in East Gippsland.<br />the State's 3 year plan allows 18,000 hectares to be logged, leaving 640,000<br />still untouched and available for inclusion in a reserve system that will have<br />been long-finalised by then. Interim protection has also been given to 2 icon<br />areas the Betka River, and Ellery Creek catchment area. This is not<br />catastrophic, nor the destruction of East Gippsland". And it finished with this<br />punch line " if the environment movement wants to be taken seriously, it will<br />need to drop the exaggeration, and use the next 3 weeks to make the most of<br />Canberra's offer of genuine consultation of what is still, after all, a draft".<br />Now, let me endorse those comments.<br />Only Labor has ever protected the environment. We are the only ones who<br />care about it. And if you take the last 15 months, we have put away In<br />Queensland, Shoalwater Bay that beautiful area that has been within the<br />Defence Department for all these years. we have put it away forever. We<br />have saved Jervis Bay. We have dlone things in various locations along<br />Eastern Australia particularly. And not only that, we have just reinstated<br />another plan on the Barrier Reef Laurie Brereton has, again, been<br />protecting the Reef through the carriage of vessels through it, and<br />particularly, dle-ballasting. We have done all of these things and, at the same<br />time, we have told the forest industries you are going to be cut by 20% a year<br />to nothing, unless you get into Regional Forest Agreements. You either add<br />value, and get into Regional Forest Agreements, or you're in for the chop.<br />Except the chop is not the tree the chop is you. In all of this, we have now<br />established a process where not like last year, where we were arguing<br />about 100 or so coupes but we are now looking at the forests of the country<br />as I say, for the largest representative system in the developed world,<br />minimum of that which existed before European settlement. And, of course,<br />we are doing more than that. On the land, we have got the Landcare<br />movement working. Only Labor cares about the land, and the way it has<br />been abused and lost. And we have got the Land Management Task Force<br />about to report, and it is going to report about how we have got whole of farm<br />planning how we rationalise farms in regions. How we give structural<br />assistance to move farms into rational and economic units. How we got off<br />marginal land. How we deal with salinity. How we see water resources<br />brought to the right places, at the right prices, in ways that will not encourage<br />salinity. How we improve our principal river system, the Murray Darling. All<br />of these things are things which are only on the agenda of one political party<br />the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>TEL: 2.0ct. 95 3 : 20 No .001 F. 09/ 1E<br />9<br />And can I say, while I am at that, in these things that we are doing these<br />ideas we have we are also underwriting now the future of Australian<br />agriculture. We are trying to drought-proof Australia. We are putting a<br />premium on the family farm. And isn't it a great irony, as always I suppose,<br />that it has got to be a Labor Government that goes out and defends the<br />backbone of rural Australia the family farm, It's a Labor Government which<br />has now removed, in the drought, of course the asset test for income social<br />security income. Over 11,000 farm families are now getting income support<br />we have paid $ 88 million in exceptional drought relief in NSW, and we have<br />paid $ 600 million overall $ 600 million. And that has kept rural Australia<br />together given them hope, given them heart until the rains make clear, or<br />enough rain comes, to see that the drought is broken.<br />For regional Australia that the Liberals have never cared about, that the<br />National Party has never cared about we are saying regions are important<br />to Australia. Regions is where the fastest growth is it's not in the capital<br />cities any more, its in some of the regions. We want to make the regions<br />work better. We want to see them become part of the national economy. We<br />want to see them have a role and a future for themselves, and make their<br />contribution. And we are developing Regional Economic Development<br />Organisations, we're funding the capacity of people to think about thelr<br />regions. We are saying that the regions which are led at a community level<br />by business, by unions, by local government, by community groups they are<br />the regions that kick along. They are the regions that are part of the Labor<br />view of Australia the ones that will be part and central to where we go as a<br />future. They are some of the things that we are thinking about. And I tell you those<br />things to make this point that the coming election is going to be a<br />referendum of ideas, a referendum on policy. A choice between those with<br />ideas, with imagination and with policy, and those without them. The big<br />ideas growth, jobs, cooperation, fairness, the environment, the region,<br />APEC, the republic. I mean, these are the big ideas of Australia. The big<br />ideas of Labor. The big things we stand for. And there is going to be no<br />running and hiding in the referendum of ideas. John Howard might run, but<br />he can't hide. And I can assure you I will trace him down every policy black<br />hole, through every shonky press statement, through every glib phrase,<br />through every broken promise, through every paltry manoeuvre he will be<br />accountable. Because they have no policy ideas the dogs are barking it in<br />their staff and around Parliament House. There is no inventory of ideas and<br />policies about to come out for the election, for the Liberal Party. They don't<br />have any. They want to make the election campaign about us. I say good<br />we are the leaders of Australia. We are the enlargers we are not the<br />punishers and the straiteners. We are the people who dream the big dreams<br />and do the big things.<br />Imagine if they had our agenda imagine if now John Hewsori had won the<br />election, and he was sitting with our work 4% growth, 4% employment<br />growth, 2-3% inflation, the Current Account trending down, exports booming,<br />a cooperative labour market, and Accord where the unions endorsed the</p>
<p>TEL: 2 .0c t -6 : 2u No Uul F. 1uw' it,<br />Reserve Banks inflation target, a fair social wage, Medicare, the<br />environment, the forests, the sea, the water, the land, the region, the country,<br />APEC, the Pacific Rim, the republic. Imagine if they had that agenda. But<br />what have they got? Miserable, out-dated rubbish from the 1950s and the<br />1960s. The politics of envy. The mono-culture. They reject it all. About a<br />year or so ago in Canberra I saw John Olsen getting a prize. He said, " look<br />there's only 2 sorts of Australians the lovers and others, and we know what<br />to think of the others, don't Now, we are part of the lovers. We are<br />part of the believers. We are the enlargers. And Australia has always gone<br />for enlargement it has always gone for the big ideas for equity, fairness,<br />justice and a future. Now, that's what we have got. We are going to fight this<br />election as hard as we fought any election ever. The thing we have got<br />against us, is that we have been in office for 12 years. But the public knows<br />that against that longevity of office, there is this huge pile of achievements.<br />That we have genuinely given Australia a future, that we have ideas about it.<br />We feel for the place we know about its role in the region, we have regard<br />for one another they know these things. In my view, they are not going to<br />turn that out, and take the third choice of the Liberal Party. A person who has<br />never put any of the big policy changes into place, and someone who just<br />this week has proven again how hollow he is. It's going to be a great fight.<br />And you have often heard from this lectern in other circumstances the phrase<br />things worth fighting for. But these things are worth fighting for. We have got<br />a Labor Government in NSW we have got a great Labor leader In Bob Carr.<br />We have got a Labor Government in Queensland, and we control the great<br />bulk of the resources in Eastern Australia the landscape, the territory we<br />can do things together. And I can even drag a few of the recalcitrant<br />Premiers to the party on occasions. So the future is ours. What we have got<br />to do now is go out there and hang on to it grab it, seize it, and run with it.<br />And when we do, we will have the reward we have had on 5 occasions. What<br />we now want it now is for our 6th, and I am telling you this we will get it.<br />Thank you.<br />ends.</p>
