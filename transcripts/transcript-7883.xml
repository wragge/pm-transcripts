TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, AUCKLAND GOLF CLUB, 3 FEBRUARY<br />
1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: H-ow was the golf game this morning, how did<br />
it go?<br />
PALMER: It was a very nice day, lovely weather, honour was<br />
totally satisfied trans-Tasman. The Prime Minister of<br />
Australia and the Prime Minister of New Zealand are all square<br />
after 18.<br />
HAWKE: So the series remains two/ one.<br />
PALMER: Yes. It will have to be resumed at a later date.<br />
H-AWKE: I had to par my last two to catch him though.<br />
JOURNALIST: You started off well though.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, started off well I was three up on him going<br />
into the start of the second, then he had a real recovery,<br />
got two up on me and I had to win the last two.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did you find the course this morning, Mr<br />
Hawke? H-AWKE: Very pretty course. Yes, very pretty course. The<br />
temporary greens, the two temporary greens but is<br />
is a very, very attractive course. I enjoyed the game very<br />
much indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you say what you each went round in?<br />
HAWKE: Very respectable.<br />
PALMER: Yes, very respectable.<br />
HAWKE: When you are playing match play you don't have to<br />
count every one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, were you aware that Australian<br />
pilots apparently followed you across the Tasman?<br />
HAWKE: What a joke. </p>
<p>-2<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you see their greeting this morning?<br />
HAWKE: I mean, they are a joke. I mean, who takes them<br />
seriously?<br />
JOURNALIST: The events in South Africa cause for<br />
encouragement? H-AWKE: Yes indeed. Geoffrey and I have had the opportunity<br />
of having a talk about it and let me say unequivocally that<br />
I welcome the measures that have been announced by President<br />
de Kierk and I believe they substantially meet the conditions<br />
of the Harare Declaration which means now that the stage<br />
can be set for negotiations between the Government of South<br />
Africa and the representatives of the non-white population.<br />
And I trust that this will mean now that serious negotiations<br />
will commence with a view to the abolition of apartheid and<br />
the creation of a democratic multi-racial society in South<br />
Africa. That means that the Commonwealth will have to look<br />
now very closely at what follows in South Africa. There<br />
is no doubt that the actions of the Commonwealth, supplemented<br />
as they have been by other nations in imposing pressure,<br />
and a considerable pressure upon South Africa, has been<br />
responsible for this move. There is no doubt about that<br />
at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is now the time to ease that pressure?<br />
HAWKE: Now is the time, I believe, to signal our preparedness<br />
to ease if the next steps are taken. It would be churlish<br />
in the extreme if we weren't to acknowledge the significance<br />
of what's been done. I certainly acknowledge that<br />
significance and I believe the leaders of the Commonwealth<br />
will now be ready to start considering the easing of pressure<br />
if the next steps are taken and the indications are, I<br />
believe, that they will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sonny Ramphal was urging caution and not getting<br />
too over-optimistic about it. Is that a view you share?<br />
H-AWKE: I think, I think cautious optimism is the way I'd<br />
put it. I mean, one's got to recognise that the pillars<br />
of apartheid haven't been touched and that the state of<br />
emergency hasn't been removed. So we welcome what has been<br />
done. It is significant, but there is much still to be done.<br />
I acknowledge that President de Klerk probably has to consider<br />
his own flanks to some extent and there is, I believe now,<br />
a stage set for negotiations. Up until now that hasn't been<br />
possible and that's an important development.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you talk about easing of pressures, do<br />
you mean sporting links as well as air links? </p>
<p>-3<br />
HAWKE: I mean that the time will come now soon when the<br />
Commonwealth should be in a position to look at all its<br />
measures, but not to say simply because of what has happened<br />
that those measures can be lifted. But certainly we should<br />
be honest enough to say that significant change has taken<br />
place and that has been acknowledged by, for instance, Alan<br />
Boesak and Archbishop Tutu and other spokespersons. So the<br />
logical, intelligent thing is to acknowledge that as a<br />
Commonwealth, say now we are in a position to be prepared<br />
to look at the easing and to signal to South Africa that<br />
we are prepared to now look at that if they are moving<br />
further. They've set the stage and if the negotiations now<br />
take place on that stage that has been set, then it would<br />
be appropriate to start easing pressure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Laurie Oakes ran with a story last<br />
night on Nine news that the election would be on April 7.<br />
Can you confirm that?<br />
HAWKE: I must thank Laurie for that. He hasn't been in<br />
touch with me to tell me. Thanks, thanks very much, Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that the truth?<br />
HAWKE: Do you think that's the way I'd announce it?<br />
JOURNALIST: How are you feeling, a campaign looming? Ready<br />
for it?<br />
PM: Yes, I feel very fit and healthy and well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think Andrew might have gone, run his<br />
race too early? You know, he was out on the hustings earlier<br />
and had a few gaffes?<br />
HAWKE: Well, you'd hardly say that the last two or three<br />
weeks have covered the Liberal Party with glory, so it doesn't<br />
seem to have been terribly effective, but you know, that's<br />
their business.<br />
JOURNALIST: What lessons could the Melbourne organisers<br />
of the hope for Olympic Games there learn from the way the<br />
New Zealanders have organised this Commonwealth Games?<br />
HAWKE: I don't know the specifics, Denis, that they would<br />
want to pick up. I'm sure they'll talk with them, but one<br />
of the things that's impressed me, as no doubt you, is the<br />
if I can put it this way the lack of fussiness. I mean,<br />
they just seem to have gone about it in a very straightforward<br />
sort of way. I think it was probably typified by the opening<br />
ceremony. It didn't have the massive expenditure, for<br />
instance, that was obviously involved, for example, in </p>
<p>-4<br />
Los Angeles and Seoul. But there was a character about it<br />
which I think impressed everybody ari&amp; those are the sorts<br />
of things that I think we can learn from New Zealand.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your thoughts on Australia's performance?<br />
HAWKE: Tremendous. I'm very proud of them and I had the<br />
opportunity yesterday, as you know, of meeting with them,<br />
a lot of them in the Village and I just want to say this<br />
to my fellow Australians there was a lot of talk there<br />
before the Games started about behaviour. Let me say to<br />
you, as Prime Minister of this country, if you'd had the<br />
opportunity, as I had, of being with them there, seeing these<br />
kids particularly the young ones they are tremendous.<br />
They are magnificent ambassadors for Australia on and off<br />
the field. They've done our country proud and I want to<br />
say, Geoffrey, how much I've appreciated the reception that<br />
the New Zealanders have given the Australians. It's been<br />
great and I think in a number of contests the Aussies and<br />
New Zealanders seem to have, sort of, cosied up together<br />
against some of our competitors.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
HAWKE: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: On the topic of behaviour, Senator Amanda<br />
Vanstone had a bit of a go at you concerning your description<br />
of Andrew Lloyd yesterday as a no bullshit fellow<br />
unparliamentary language<br />
HAWKE: I wasn't in parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you must be pleased that the tramways<br />
dispute seems to have been sorted out in Victoria?<br />
HAWKE: Yes, you're right. It hasn't been good for the people<br />
of Melbourne, hasn't been good for the Government of Victoria<br />
and, I suppose, in a sense, you know, it hasn't been good<br />
for us. So I'm certainly glad it's over, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you see as Thomastown by-election<br />
for your Government. Is there any implications at all for<br />
the Federal Government?<br />
HAWKE: No, no There'll be some swing, but there's no<br />
significance for us.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about for Andrew, if he doesn't make, it<br />
you don't see any significance for him?<br />
HAWKE: No, I think he's got his own problems actually in<br />
the Federal sphere. I don't think the by-election there<br />
is important for him or for me. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: It's been described as his Flinders.<br />
HAWKE: I think that's a bit tough, I think that's a bit<br />
tough. I mean, I think the things that are concerning the<br />
Federal Party and their worries about the Federal Liberal<br />
leadership are self contained, as it were. They are federal<br />
in the implications. I don't think what happens in Thomastown<br />
will really add to or subtract from their worries.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, your views about South Africa, the<br />
developments there?<br />
PALMER: Well, it's clear that this is a positive development,<br />
but it's not the end of apartheid. It's only the beginning<br />
of the end of apartheid. The pressure's got to be kept up<br />
to ensure that apartheid is dismantled. But you've got to<br />
welcome this development, it's a very positive development.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, what did you think of the plane flying<br />
over? Were you embarrassed about that?<br />
PALMER: I thought it was an exercise in bad taste.<br />
HAWKE: And futility.<br />
ends </p>
