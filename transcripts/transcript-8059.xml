CHECK AGAINSTl EMBARGOED UNTIL DLVR<br />
TOWARDS A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB 19 JULY 1990<br />
It is now one hundred years since the beginning of the<br />
process which led to the creation of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia in Barton's phrase, a nation for a continent, a<br />
continent for a nation.<br />
The Federal compact hammered out through the 1890s resolved<br />
the competing claims of six distinct political communities,<br />
their capitals and centres of population separated by<br />
immense distances. It's easy to forget that our political<br />
union was never a foregone conclusion. It involved give and<br />
take, a capacity for compromise; and in the end, it was a<br />
triumph of hard work, common purpose and political<br />
leadership. Today we face together challenges impossible to envisage a<br />
century ago. But the same qualities the work, the will,<br />
the leadership which were needed to create the Federation<br />
in the last decade of the nineteenth century are needed<br />
again, in the last decade of the twentieth century, to make<br />
the Federation work better.<br />
The time has come to form a closer partnership between our<br />
three levels of government Commonwealth, State and local.<br />
Our first task is to move by sensible, practicable steps to<br />
get better co-operation within the framework of the Federal<br />
Constitution as it stands. That is where I propose we focus<br />
our main effort.<br />
Our second task is to apply the spirit of national<br />
co-operation in a new approach to reform of the Constitution<br />
itself. Today, I propose proces ses through which these tasks can be<br />
achieved sustained and substantial processes to explore<br />
and map the areas where co-operation for common objectives<br />
is not only desirable but realistically achievable.<br />
The goals are to improve our national efficiency and<br />
international competitiveness, and to improve the delivery<br />
and quality of the services governments provide. </p>
<p>2.<br />
We need to remove the impediments and the anomalies which<br />
stand in the way of those goals.<br />
My friends, alone of the peoples of the world, we have a<br />
continent to ourselves. With all the marvellous diversity<br />
of our land, with all the rich diversity of our people, we<br />
share a commitment to a single national identity. Wherever<br />
we live in this wide country, we adhere to the same<br />
fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy, freedom<br />
of the individual and the rule of law. And the Federal<br />
system itself underwrites this diversity with unity.<br />
Yet within this splendid unity, we have imposed on ourselves<br />
a burden of different rules and regulations and requirements<br />
which needlessly weighs against the tremendous advantages we<br />
can have as a nation-continent.<br />
We are proud that as a modern and prosperous society we can<br />
provide quality services to people whether they live in the<br />
city or the bush but too often, essential services are<br />
getting tangled up in bureaucratic overlap.<br />
The battling family in the city fringe; the Aboriginal<br />
community in the remote outback; the frail aged at home or<br />
in hospital they don't want to argue the toss about which<br />
bureaucracy provides the help to which they are entitled.<br />
And their least concern is some academic argument of<br />
Commonwealth versus State rights. And the instinct of the<br />
people is correct.<br />
The real emphasis our real concern should be the rights<br />
and needs of citizens, not as, say, Queenslanders or<br />
Tasmanians, but as Australians.<br />
Now that might sound just a clich6. But what happens in<br />
practice? Schools in different States have different minimum starting<br />
ages, and different patterns of schooling at primary and<br />
secondary levels, and different curricula, and different<br />
ways of assessing Year 12 students differences that give<br />
totally unnecessary headaches not only to students who may<br />
move interstate but also to employers and tertiary<br />
institutions who look to the schools system to provide<br />
meaningful standards for recruitment.<br />
Lawyers and doctors and other professionals may have<br />
quaifiatinsfrom the :-best universities.. in Australia or<br />
the world; skilled tradesmen may have the finest on-the-job<br />
experience but to work outside their home State they need<br />
a licence from a State licensing board.<br />
How sensible is it to shrink what is already a relatively<br />
small Australian market into separate State markets? </p>
<p>Yet that is what we do:<br />
when we force manufacturers to put different labels and<br />
different packages on the same products;<br />
when we give three different definitions to bread;<br />
when one State demands that margarine be sold only in a<br />
package shaped like a cube;<br />
when each State has its own separate design<br />
requirements for water meters; its own quality<br />
standards for chemicals used in agriculture.<br />
Two States forbid a certain kind of heavy semi-trailer that<br />
is legal everywhere else; there is no uniformity between<br />
States on the time a truckie can spend behind the wheel;<br />
each State issues its own driver's licences. Only last<br />
month we at last managed to achieve in principle agreement<br />
to prevent unscrupulous truck drivers from getting multiple<br />
licences so they could flout the demerit points systems<br />
wherever they liked. It took years of work so I suppose<br />
we can say with Galileo, ' Nevertheless, it moves'.<br />
We cannot pretend to be serious about the gl~ aa greenhouse<br />
effect if we think in terms of separate State and national.<br />
strategies. Now, my purpose today is not to prescribe the changes to be<br />
made to cure these absurdities and anomalies.<br />
I am not specifying outcomes.<br />
But I am describing the areas where I seek change through<br />
co-operation; and I am proposing a process through which<br />
change can be achieved a process which will produce<br />
results. I acknowledge, at once, the progress already being made<br />
thanks to the hard work of the various Ministerial Councils<br />
which bring together State and Federal Ministers and<br />
officials across a range of policy areas.<br />
But the challenge is broader and more urgent for us all.<br />
My friends, we all need to do some fundamental re-thinkingand<br />
not just governments but the major political parties,<br />
the -business community, . the, . unions, opinion-tfarmers.<br />
The question we all will have to answer is this: ' Are we<br />
ready for the 21st century?'. And if the changes we need to<br />
make are to be effective, we must all be prepared to take a<br />
fresh look at ourselves our way of doing things, at the<br />
habits, the assumptions, the prejudices of the past. </p>
<p>And in particular I point today to the challenge facing us<br />
in these areas:<br />
micro-economic reform;<br />
financial relations;<br />
delivery of services;<br />
the national agenda for social justice;<br />
industrial relations;<br />
the protection of the environment;<br />
and Constitutional reform.<br />
I mention micro-economic reform first, because it is common<br />
ground that it is absolutely essential, if we are to have a<br />
more competitive economy. It means we must improve the<br />
performance of the structures which underpin the national<br />
economy it means better ports, a more modern transport<br />
system, faster communications, cheaper power.<br />
My Government has acted to reform the financial system,<br />
tariffs, aviation, telecommunications, taxation, and its own<br />
business enterprises areas of virtually exclusive<br />
Commonwealth control. We still have unfinished business on<br />
our agenda.<br />
In advancing to the next stage, the co-operation of the<br />
States is essential.<br />
The division of responsibility enshrined in our Federal<br />
system need not and must not be an insuperable barrier<br />
against co-operation.<br />
Look at the progress two sovereign nations Australia and<br />
New Zealand have made in integrating our economies under<br />
the Closer Economic Relations agreement. Look indeed at the<br />
progress the twelve sovereign nations of the European<br />
Community are making: there will be less impediment against<br />
trade of goods and services between them in 1992 than there<br />
is now between the States of Australia.<br />
Here, key areas of our economy remain balkanised.<br />
The limited arrangements which do exist to share electricity<br />
between States are hamstrung by inefficient pricing<br />
restrictions, hidden cross-subsidies between different<br />
consumers and planning decisions which seem to accept State<br />
borders as market barriers. Our aviation system remains<br />
hobbled by regulatory fragmentation. And our railways<br />
* remain burdened with the-legacy of-differences between our<br />
colonial engineers. </p>
<p>A cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and<br />
Perth may be subjected to:<br />
3 non-integrated rail systems;<br />
4 changes of locomotives;<br />
5 different safe working systems;<br />
6 different sizes of loading gauge;<br />
10 different engineering standards of the basic<br />
standard gauge rail track;<br />
12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew<br />
changes, refuelling, inspections.<br />
How, under such circumstances, can rail avoid being a drain<br />
on the taxpayer? And what of the impact of this situation<br />
on Australia's international competitiveness?<br />
And how, with this set-up, can rail compete with road? One<br />
offers door-to-door overnight service, tailored to suit<br />
modern just-in-time inventories. The other must contend<br />
with up to three rail authorities controlling the progress<br />
of its freight, leading inevitably to confusion about who<br />
has responsibility for delivery.<br />
We need to tackle these issues. In rail, for example, the<br />
Commonwealth and the States are giving serious consideration<br />
to a National Rail Freight Initiative, involving new<br />
investment in track and terminal facilities; guarantees<br />
perhaps contractual commitments to high priority<br />
schedules; and new industrial relations standards.<br />
It is no exaggeration to say that the Initiative, to be<br />
successful, will require Commonwealth-State co-operation on<br />
a scale we've seldom seen hitherto in this country.<br />
But we must strive to achieve that co-operation and not<br />
just in rail transport, but over the whole range of<br />
micro-economic reform. It is not so much an option, as an<br />
imperative.<br />
My friends, in this national endeavour, we must, of course,<br />
work within a basic macro-economic framework. Australia<br />
must have one central level of effective economic<br />
management. The level and incidence of taxation and public<br />
sector borrowing should be primarily determined at a<br />
national level.<br />
But let me say this, in the spirit of my genuine desire for<br />
a -closerpartnership.. wi-th.. the States: the imperative of<br />
national economic management need not preclude worthwhile<br />
change in Commonwealth-State financial arrangements.<br />
We are prepared, for example, to look at changes to the<br />
Premiers' Conference arrangements.<br />
Further, I announce today that the Commonwealth will respond<br />
positively to the Premiers' requests in regard to financial<br />
institutions taxes. We will relinquish the bank accounts<br />
debits tax to the States. </p>
<p>A third point: the Premiers want more of their Commonwealth<br />
funds in untied rather than tied form. And it is certainly<br />
legitimate to ask whether tied arrangements limit program<br />
efficiency. We may find a need to move away from tied<br />
grants in a number of areas; and in other areas, a need to<br />
change our arrangements so that we get better value for<br />
money. It is timely and proper to consider this aspect of<br />
our funding arrangements. We are ready to do so.<br />
Friends, in the post-War period, the functions performed by<br />
our Governments Federal, State and local have changed<br />
radically. Behind this change, forcing its pace, there has been I<br />
believe the irresistible and irreversible thrust of an<br />
historic process the working out in Australia of the idea<br />
of progress and equality and the just expectations of a free<br />
people. But too often in practice the result especially in health<br />
and welfare services has been duplication of effort<br />
duplication, for example, of accounting and monitoring,<br />
duplication of consultation and complaints mechanisms.<br />
Too often the financing and administration of a service is<br />
shared between, or rather divided between, different tiers<br />
of governments. Too often different governments are<br />
providing closely related services, without proper<br />
co-ordination.<br />
Such arrangements can actually distort the very design of<br />
programs in the interests of shifting costs from one level<br />
of government to the other literally, passing the buck<br />
instead of serving the interests of the clients.<br />
Surely, when we think of all the money, skills and good<br />
intentions put into these efforts, there must be a better<br />
way of serving the needs of the people.<br />
We must find, as a nation, a better way of integrating the<br />
legitimate policy interests of the Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments and achieving more integrated and more effective<br />
delivery of programs and services to our citizens.<br />
It is my belief that we should be ready to review aUl the<br />
services which the Commonwealth and the States deliver.<br />
But I suggest the health and welfare fields would be the<br />
most useful starting point for review.<br />
What I propose today is a process of program rationalisation<br />
through joint examination with the States a process which<br />
yields practical results. I do not want a voluminous<br />
comprehensive report at the end of some long unspecified<br />
period of study. I want proposals to come forward case by<br />
case; to be dealt with on their merits, case by case; and<br />
specific decisions to be made, case by case. </p>
<p>Let us enter this process with these watchwords: precision<br />
and decision.<br />
in all this, the Australian Government can never avoid or<br />
evade its genuine national responsibilities.<br />
In the first place, there are groups for whom the national<br />
government has special responsibility veterans,<br />
Aborigines, newly arrived migrants and refugees, for<br />
example. Moreover, only the national government can effectively<br />
identify certain problems, which can vary widely in their<br />
regional or local incidence, yet which may require a<br />
national policy, financed nationally, for their solutions.<br />
But the experience of the years tells us that there are<br />
important services which would be improved if the Federal<br />
Government were not directly involved in their delivery.<br />
I emphasise that the joint review I propose is aimed at<br />
achieving better services, better delivered. Any cost<br />
savings and of course there should be savings would be a<br />
bonus. And I give the assurance that, to the extent State<br />
Governments take over any administrative responsibilities<br />
for programs previously run by the Commonwealth, they will<br />
be compensated, and compensated fairly.<br />
There are two objectives:<br />
first, to put into better order the existing<br />
service delivery system,<br />
and then, to make sure that as we take up new<br />
challenges, and governments undertake new<br />
commitments, we don't create a new set of<br />
problems, through overlapping and duplication of<br />
responsibilities.<br />
This is especially relevant and important for the success of<br />
the national strategy for social justice my government<br />
pledged to pursue in seeking the people's mandate for a<br />
fourth term.<br />
It-is:. a: national.. strategy; -but the. co-operation of the<br />
States and local government is essential.<br />
The Australians living in the rapidly expanding urban<br />
fringes are experiencing a special set of social problems<br />
not enough affordable housing; poor access to employment,<br />
public transport, schools, hospitals and recreation. </p>
<p>Their problems real problems, human problems, things that<br />
people have to cope with every day of their lives are<br />
compounded by our failure to co-ordinate the delivery of<br />
services across the levels of government.<br />
The co-operation of States and local government will be<br />
needed not only to implement the strategy, but to supply the<br />
information needed to identify and tackle the problems.<br />
And I believe that if we can move forward together with the<br />
States on a new social justice agenda, the common effort<br />
itself can give rise to a new spirit of co-operation which<br />
can spread out to other fields.<br />
One such area is industrial relations.<br />
We have a profusion and confusion of industrial relations<br />
systems. As a result, there are wide variations between<br />
awards and work practices, determined by seven major<br />
tribunals and a host of smaller ones. It encourages<br />
leapfrogging in wages and conditions and fosters uncertainty<br />
for unions and employers alike as to whether their industry<br />
is covered by Federal or State rules, or both.<br />
It's not just an inconvenience it's an impediment to<br />
stable wage fixing and sound economic policy.<br />
The Commonwealth and the States are already working to<br />
improve the legislative framework. But the potential exists<br />
for much more co-operation and co-ordination. My own<br />
inclination is that it is a field in which the Commonwealth<br />
should have ultimate responsibility, and I note with special<br />
interest that the Premier of New South Wales for one has not<br />
discounted such a development.<br />
My friends,<br />
Anyone familiar with the history of my Government would know<br />
we have not shirked our national responsibility for the<br />
environment. And we are not about to abandon that<br />
responsibility. But my Government has always preferred co-operative<br />
solutions. Indeed, the environment must increasingly become<br />
an area in which common ground and common purpose come to<br />
replace controversy and confrontation.<br />
. The.-Commonwealth and States. are.-already co-operating on<br />
national air and water quality standards; the Landcare<br />
program; management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;<br />
and the Tasmanian World Heritage Area.<br />
My Government is determined to make sure that Australia<br />
moves firmly along the path of ecologically sustainable<br />
development. </p>
<p>We are working with business, unions and conservation groups<br />
and we seek the involvement of the States. That<br />
involvement includes their joining the sectoral working<br />
groups which will make policy recommendations to the<br />
Government. These groups are to start their work shortly.<br />
There is clear merit in working together on these issues.<br />
Commonly agreed environmental processes and guidelines,<br />
where possible, will better achieve the objectives of the<br />
Commonwealth, States, industry, workers and the community.<br />
The same co-operation essential to the review of<br />
Commonwealth-State program delivery which I have already<br />
outlined will need to be applied to the sustainable<br />
development process, if we are to achieve the best results<br />
for Australia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I must emphasise that there is an essential ingredient if we<br />
are to produce substantial results from the exercise I<br />
propose. It requires a commitment of leadership. Success will<br />
depend, in the end, on both myself and the Premiers being<br />
closely involved at strategic times, particularly in<br />
decision-making. We must not allow the overall thrust to be<br />
lost in a mire of bickering and intransigence in particular<br />
subject areas. Of course the detail is important but it<br />
needs to be worked through rather than allowed to become an<br />
excuse for saying that it is all too difficult.<br />
Accordingly I anticipate a number of special Premiers'<br />
Conferences on these issues.<br />
I have today written to the Premiers proposing a Special<br />
Premiers' Conference take place on 31 October and 1 November<br />
in Brisbane. As far as I am concerned, everything I have<br />
discussed today is on the table from micro-economic reform<br />
and program delivery to industrial relations and the<br />
environment.* And I welcome further suggestions from the<br />
Premiers as to what they want discussed.<br />
The first meeting should choose what should be dealt with<br />
first and set in motion the immediate processes to make<br />
decisions.<br />
. Further, before the Conference, I plan to establish a<br />
Commonwealth-State Steering Committee chaired by the<br />
Secretary of my Department with equivalent State Government<br />
representation. Its main role will be to arrange for the<br />
preparation of papers for this first Conference and then in<br />
broad terms to co-ordinate and advance future work.<br />
Moreover, I propose to set up forthwith a special group in<br />
my Department headed at a very senior level to provide<br />
continuing support. </p>
<p>Of course, detailed involvement will be needed from<br />
Commonwealth, State and other areas of specialist knowledge.<br />
There must be consultation with interested groups.<br />
Such involvement and consultation will ensure decisions are<br />
well informed. I repeat, however they will not represent<br />
a barrier to timely decision-making at the highest levels.<br />
Clearly, many of the issues for consideration directly<br />
involve local government.<br />
I have therefore proposed to the Premiers that the Local<br />
Government Association be invited to participate at the<br />
Conference, on issues relevant to them.<br />
In my letter to the Premiers, I have emphasised that my<br />
Government is prepared to commit itself to new processes<br />
pursued in a new spirit to improve our Federal system, and<br />
urging that they and their Governments make the same<br />
commitment. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I now come to the area of reform which we must acknowledge<br />
has proved most difficult to achieve the Constitution<br />
itself. It is true that there have been very significant changes in<br />
the way we govern ourselves, within the existing<br />
Constitution. The most significant of these has been the uniform taxation<br />
system a war-time measure which has profoundly changed the<br />
relations between Federal and State Governments in<br />
peace-time.<br />
High Court decisions have done more to alter the<br />
Constitution than all the referendums.<br />
And there has been, without change to the text of the<br />
Constitution, quiet and constructive adjustment in the roles<br />
of the Federal and State Governments in such areas as family<br />
law. Thus, without actual change in the written Constitution,<br />
there has been considerable change in the role and<br />
responsibilities of the three levels of government.<br />
That is why, in these remarks, I have focussed my thinking<br />
in terms of a broad process of change, through consultation<br />
and co-operation a process we can get moving on now.<br />
But, I also believe we have to seek new paths towards a more<br />
contemporary Constitution. </p>
<p>11.<br />
One of the reasons why so many valuable proposals have been<br />
defeated at referendums over the last ninety years has been<br />
that, almost invariably, they have become entangled in party<br />
political controversy.<br />
Now, I do not condemn that out of hand. In itself, it<br />
reflects the strength of our democracy and the main source<br />
of that strength is the vigour of our great political<br />
parties. Nevertheless, it is a plain fact of our history that it is<br />
almost impossible to amend our Constitution in an atmosphere<br />
of partisan controversy.<br />
Therefore, I believe we need to take a new approach<br />
creating a continuing process to identify the areas of<br />
aarpmAnt, to achieve Constitutional change.<br />
Next March and April will mark an important Australian<br />
anniversary the centenary of the First Australasian<br />
Constitutional Convention.<br />
As I pointed out at the beginning, the work of creating the<br />
Australian Commonwealth took ten years. There is gathering<br />
interest about what we do over the next ten years, the years<br />
remaining before the Centenary of Federation in 2001.<br />
I want to give momentum to that interest.<br />
A Steering Committee is being established to develop<br />
arrangements and an agenda for a Constitutional Conference<br />
next year to mark the centenary.<br />
I am delighted to be able to say today that the former<br />
Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen has indicated his<br />
willingness to chair this Steering Committee.<br />
This is not to be a government-run conference but the<br />
Commonwealth government intends to support it financially<br />
and in other ways and participate in it. And I hope State<br />
governments will do likewise.<br />
My hope is to break away from the situation where the<br />
Commonwealth Government considers and puts to referendum<br />
proposals for amendment of the Constitution only to find<br />
that we do not have the requisite support from the States or<br />
other parties, or support that evaporates in the heat of<br />
partisan controversy. We -owe it to the future of the<br />
country to test a different approach, one in which proposals<br />
emerge from collective discussion and deliberation.<br />
Some proposals may emerge which can be taken forward in the<br />
next couple of years. Equally, in some areas the process<br />
might not bear fruit until closer to the Centenary year of<br />
2001. How long, for example, must we all go on accepting<br />
the merit of the four year term without achieving it? </p>
<p>12.<br />
I may say that I take encouragement from recent comments by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition Dr Hewson, indicating his and<br />
his Party's wish to bring a bi-partisan attitude to<br />
questions like the 4-year term. If that support is<br />
sustained, I would propose a referendum on a four year term<br />
at the next Federal election.<br />
But whether we are looking at early proposals or ones to be<br />
put later in the decade, we should start now.<br />
For the Commonwealth's part, we shall be there in April, we<br />
shall listen with close attention and we shall participate<br />
constructively. I will be personally involved, and I sincerely hope the<br />
Premiers and the Opposition leaders will join with me in<br />
this very important exercise. Continuing involvement at<br />
this level will ensure the success of proposals for change<br />
which will certainly emerge.<br />
Friends, In all that I have said today, the operative word is<br />
' achievable'.<br />
We cannot re-write the Constitution. We cannot replace the<br />
Federal system.<br />
But we can make the Constitution and the Federal system<br />
under which we live work better.<br />
I have outlined an achievable, yet wide-ranging agenda for<br />
change and reform in the way we govern ourselves.<br />
I have proposed a process or rather, a range of processes<br />
by which we can move together towards reform in a measured<br />
manner. It is a process which, I am convinced, can give us<br />
a workable machinery to create a closer partnership, a<br />
genuine partnership, for the better governance of this great<br />
nation. </p>
