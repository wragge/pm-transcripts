UTR ALA<br />
PRIME MINISTER F<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 AUGUST 1988<br />
The Government has given very careful consideration to the b<br />
issues involved in the future of the Lemonthyme and Southern<br />
Forests of Tasmania. M<br />
It has decided that it will secure protection of those areas w<br />
defined in the proposal put forward by the Minister for the d<br />
Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories,<br />
Senator Richardson. This will be built on the industry<br />
package developed by the minister for Resources, t<br />
Senator Cook.<br />
Accordingly the Government will be putting a proposal to the<br />
Tasmanian Government involving a significant extension of<br />
financial assistance to Tasmania for forestry development<br />
over and above that proposed by Senator Cook.<br />
A large part of that assistance will be for the development<br />
of plantations.<br />
I will be seeking a meeting with Premier Gray on Thursday<br />
11 August to discuss the matter.<br />
