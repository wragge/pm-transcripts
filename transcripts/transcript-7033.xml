PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PACRIM 1986<br />
PERTH 16 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
Premier Burke, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I am delighted to be able to welcome you all here to Perth<br />
for PacRim 1986. For those of you who have travelled from<br />
overseas, I hope you'll enjoy your stay in Australia and I<br />
trust that when you leave our shores you take with you fond<br />
memories and warm friendships from your time here.<br />
The timing of the conference will allow you to enjoy the<br />
excitement of the America's Cup in the free time you have<br />
available to you. I would like, therefore, to extend a<br />
special w: elcome to our friends from the United States and<br />
New Zealand. No doubt your yachting compatriots and<br />
enthusiasts will receive an equally warm welcome when they<br />
return to Australia in four years' time for the next<br />
America's Cup challenge series.<br />
By any standard this is a major international conference,<br />
bringing together more than 400 delegates from around the<br />
world. The theme of your symposium is indeed well chosen:<br />
Finance, Trade and Investment in the Pacific Rim area. It<br />
is a theme which encapsulates some of the major forces which<br />
have shaped the world economy over the past decade or so<br />
and which will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.<br />
As I looked through the list of participants, I was struck<br />
by the number and calibre of people from throughout the<br />
Pacific Rim who have recognised the value of this meeting<br />
and have backed up their judgement by travelling long<br />
distances to participate. There is a further message about<br />
the importance of this conference in the fact that several<br />
delegates have travelled from beyond the Pacific region to<br />
be with us.<br />
It is fitting to recall at the outset a very significant<br />
Australian whose work was crucial in developing the notion<br />
of Pacific cooperation. I refer of course to the late<br />
Sir John Crawford, who died in October 1984. For Australia<br />
and the whole Asia/ Pacific area, Sir John Crawford was a<br />
pioneer in thinking about the immense potential for the<br />
growth of economic relationships in the Western Pacific. </p>
<p>It is particularly appropriate that we remember Sir Johnes<br />
work because as we meet here, the Fifth Pacific Economic<br />
Cooperation Conference is taking place in Vancouver.<br />
Sir John was one of the architects of that conference and he<br />
would have been delighted to know of the success both of<br />
PECC and of this Pac Rim conference. I note in passing that<br />
China will join the PECC conference as a full participant at<br />
Vancouver. These conferences are a clear reflection both of the extent<br />
to which the Pacific Rim has become the hub of global<br />
economic activity and of the promise the area holds for the<br />
rest of this decade and beyond.<br />
if there is one single fact which summarises the reasons for<br />
our being here it is this: two years ago, for the first<br />
time, the value of trans-Pacific trade surpassed that of<br />
trans-Atlantic trade.<br />
That fact symbolises the enormous economic growth in the<br />
region which you are here to discuss over the next few days.<br />
The Pacific rim particularly its western half is truly<br />
one of the great new engines of the world economy and is<br />
playing an increasingly vital role in international affairs.<br />
However that single fact and the rapidly growing trade<br />
among the nations on the western rim also illustrates our<br />
great and increasing inter-dependence. it is a reminder to<br />
us that we must develop complementary skills and<br />
specialisations, and that we must facilitate investment and<br />
trade among the members of this vast region. We literally<br />
cannot afford to fail.<br />
And yet we are so varied in our economic structures and<br />
levels of development! The Pacific Rim includes the world's<br />
two major economic powers the United States and Japan. It<br />
includes one of the world's most rapidly growing and<br />
populous countries China. It includes an array of<br />
developing countries of diverse size and resource<br />
endowments. I do not intend to dwell in detail tonight on the<br />
developments within the many nations and groupings of the<br />
region. Yet I would be remiss if I opened our conference<br />
without at least sketching some of the principal advances<br />
and transformations.<br />
In China, where history has always been played out on a<br />
grand scale, the process of dramatic change is continuing<br />
today. Since 1978, Australia, like other countries, has watched<br />
with intense interest the bold program of modernisation on<br />
which China has embarked.<br />
it is necessarily a long-term vision, seen by Deng Xiaoping<br />
and his colleagues as requiring a sustained effort through<br />
the years ahead. The program has already been subject to<br />
major revisions and may well be the subject of more. </p>
<p>Nevertheless we and others firmly believe that this latest<br />
chapter in Chinese history can have profound implications<br />
for China, Iror Australia, for the Asia-Pacific region and,<br />
indeed, fox the world. We recognise its potential to rank<br />
with the great beneficial landmark developments of our<br />
times. In the ASEAN~ nations, we see one of the most successful<br />
political and economic groupings in the world.<br />
I am aware of course of dissatisfaction within ASEAN about<br />
the limitattons on economic cooperation and trade within the<br />
group.<br />
But, if we compare today with 1967, when the Association was<br />
formed, it i~ s impossible to gainsay the advances which have<br />
been made b~ y its members. The rate of economic growth of<br />
each ASEAN country in the past decade has easily outstripped<br />
that of most industrialised countries, including<br />
Australia'z. ASEAN's economic managers and entrepreneurs<br />
have made a major contribution to the dynamism of the<br />
Asia-Paci -ic region.<br />
In South Korea, too, our region has seen a striking economic<br />
success story. Its emergence from the devastation of the<br />
Korean war @ is a rapidly industrialising growth economy has<br />
had a signL. Zicant regional and global impact.<br />
Nor should u-e overlook the economic success of Taiwan.<br />
Indeed taken as a whole, East Asia's share of world GNP has<br />
almost tr~ ipled over the last quarter century; its share of<br />
world trade has doubled and it now accounts for almost<br />
one-fifth oq? all international trade.<br />
Finally, in Japan and the United States, the two most mature<br />
economies og the Pacific Rim, we see fundamental changes<br />
taking place.<br />
Japan's annuaal trading surplus is now so large that it has<br />
become the miajor net lender nation each year, and the United<br />
States tho largest net borrower.<br />
major struclural imbalances on this scale are worrying<br />
enough. 3ut the fact that they involve two of the world's<br />
largest economies and the world's reserve currency has added<br />
to the urgency with which this issue mus be addressed.<br />
The corrective realignment of the Japanese and American<br />
currenciesi which has occurred over the past year or so is<br />
creating new opportunities for trade and investment in the<br />
Pacific Rimn area. </p>
<p>with the large appreciation of the yen, Japan is on the<br />
threshold of a natural economic restructuring process. in<br />
particular there is the potential for larger imports of<br />
agricultural products, simply transformed manufactures, and<br />
a range of services including overseas tourism. But, by the<br />
same token, it is likely to lead to slower growth of imports<br />
of raw materials, which will require exporters like<br />
Australia to seek out new markets, including within the<br />
region.<br />
Australians have, over the last decades, been gradually<br />
coming to a recognition of the importance to them of their<br />
immediate region. Perhaps this recognition has been too<br />
slow in coming. But without doubt the dynamism of the<br />
region's economic growth, the productivity of its<br />
workforces, the crucial and complex issues which dominate<br />
the region's security, its growing technological<br />
capabilities such issues have decisively forced<br />
Australians to acknowledge that their welfare is irrevocably<br />
enmeshed with that of the Pacific Rim.<br />
This is a sobering thought, since it will force on us the<br />
necessity of more productive work, serious competition, and<br />
genuine inventiveness and resourcefulness to exploit the<br />
opportunities presented by the newly affluent markets to our<br />
north. For my part, my Government has sought to respond positively<br />
to this new awareness. We cannot alone determine the pace<br />
or pattern of our developing relationships with the region.<br />
But we are aiming to fashion a range of policies calculated<br />
to build a flexible and fruitful relationship*. We are<br />
seeking to coordinate all our regional policies political,<br />
security and trade so that we can speak with one voice to<br />
the region and so we can build a durable and mutually<br />
beneficial relationship with it.<br />
But it is not enough simply to recognise our<br />
inter-relationship. We must also be ready to respond to the<br />
changes in the region.<br />
And the future is not without its difficulties. Lying<br />
before this region are structural changes which are at least<br />
as profound as any which have taken place over the past<br />
couple of decades.<br />
most immediately, for the countries in the region that are<br />
major commodity exporters including Australia the slump<br />
in world prices has placed added strain on their economies<br />
and brought into sharper focus the long-term decline in the<br />
terms of trade of commodity exporters.<br />
The volatility of commodity prices is a major source of<br />
disruption to many economies. Long-term solutions can be<br />
found only if all nations have equal access to the world's<br />
markets, including for manufactured goods and if trading<br />
decisions are made fairly on the basis of relative prices. </p>
<p>Therefore we must overcome the major obstacle formed by the<br />
onset of protectionism, especially agricultural<br />
protectioniom. Trade has been the engine of growth in this region. I noted<br />
earlier the sharp growth in trans-Pacific trade. There has<br />
also been enormous growth in trade among the Western Pacific<br />
nations. This intra-regional trade has grown at just under<br />
percent a year over the 13 years to 1984.<br />
Yet sadly we now find ourselves in the midst of a global<br />
conflict in international trade that is reducing our<br />
collective opportunities to raise living standards through<br />
international specialisation.<br />
The international rules on fair trade are being manipulated<br />
and broken to the detriment of all nations including,<br />
ironically, those which have been active in stifling trade.<br />
The dawning realisation of the futility of trade conflicts<br />
has spurred the recent launch of the Uruguay Round of<br />
multilateral Trade Negotiations. While those negotiations<br />
no doubt will be protracted, they at least offer the<br />
prospect oZ a reversal of protectionism of the<br />
liberalisation once again of world trade.<br />
Nations in the Pacific Rim area, I am pleased to say, have<br />
been active in that process of liberalisation. The United<br />
States took a leading role in the successful launch of a new<br />
round of multilateral Trade Negotiations; the Cairns group<br />
of 14 fair traders that successfully pushed for the<br />
inclusion of agriculture on the MTN agenda was heavily<br />
represented by PacRim countries; Japan has undertaken to<br />
play its part in the freeing up of world trade; the<br />
countries involved in the Regional Initiative on Trade that<br />
I launched in Bangkok in November 1983 actively supported a<br />
new MTN round; and China has indicated its interest in<br />
joining the GATT.<br />
The task now is to convert into action the principles and<br />
undertakings articulated in the text of the Ministerial<br />
statement launching the new MTN round. None of us can<br />
afford to let pass this opportunity for permanent reform.<br />
with this ferment of change and restructuring, we cannot be<br />
sure of the magnitude of the new trading opportunities that<br />
will aris~ e. But we can be sure that the countries benefiting<br />
most froma these opportunities will be those that are<br />
flexible and adaptable that have economic, political and<br />
social structures capable of responding readily to changing<br />
circumstances.<br />
The major economies of the region have certainly<br />
demonstrated that capacity in the past. But as trade has<br />
grown and International financial flows have become more<br />
integrated it is also becoming clear just how costly is the<br />
regulation, which in the past, frequently underpinned<br />
structural change in this region. </p>
<p>Greater emphasis needs to be given in several areas to<br />
deregulation, to more liberal investment regimes and to<br />
reform of the financial system.<br />
That has certainly been a major emphasis of economic policy<br />
here in Australia.<br />
My Government has taken a series of major policy initiatives<br />
to place Australia in a position where it is capable of both<br />
creating and quickly seizing upon new trading opportunities.<br />
Protection has been cut, starting with the most protected of<br />
our manufacturing industries. We have developed policies to<br />
make our manufacturing industries more outward looking. We<br />
have substantially upgraded incentives for research and<br />
development and for the provision of venture capital. We<br />
have reformed the taxation system to encourage incentive and<br />
remove distortions. We have floated the Australian dollar.<br />
And most fundamentally, we are converting a substantial<br />
nominal depreciation of our currency into a real<br />
depreciation by sustained wage moderation and a genuine<br />
effort to improve productivity by reforming working<br />
practices. That real depreciation has produced a level of<br />
competitiveness of Australian industry not experienced for<br />
the best part of two decades.<br />
Lest there be any doubt, let me also make it plain to this<br />
audience that we in Australia recognise the value of foreign<br />
capital in promoting national economic development.<br />
Australia insists that there be a fair sharing of the fruits<br />
of investment as between the host and lending country, but<br />
we have systematically removed any unnecessary impediments<br />
to the free flow of investment capital and we certainly<br />
welcome worthwhile direct investment in this country.<br />
The opportunities are there for those willing to work with<br />
Australian industry, and the private sector response is<br />
beginning to emerge.<br />
Australian manufacturers are reporting greater success<br />
against imports and are signing new contracts with overseas<br />
purchasers. rndeed, I have recently visited a number of<br />
companies which have been successful in securing export<br />
contracts against intense international competition in such<br />
non-traditional Australian products as heart pacemakers,<br />
bionic ears and pharmaceutical products. There is truly an<br />
enormous range of opportunities now open to Australian<br />
industry.<br />
Clearly Australia is playing its part in promoting a more<br />
open, more growth-oriented world and regional economy and<br />
we are prepared to do more.<br />
We appreciate that the world's major economies recognise the<br />
need for global trading reform. But if there is any message<br />
to come out of this symposium over the next few days it<br />
surely must be this that the small-to-medium sized<br />
countries of this region are looking to our largest trading<br />
partners to give full effect to those commitments. </p>
<p>In that context, the large losses being sustained by the<br />
Japanese steel mills make it imperative that Japan makes its<br />
purchasing decisions on coking coal on fully commercial<br />
grounds. As I said earlier equality of access and free<br />
competition based on price are essential for the long-term<br />
viability of commodity traders.<br />
I have so gar dwelt on the exciting economic aspects of the<br />
Pacific relationships and that will be your principal<br />
theme throughout this conference. But I want to conclude by<br />
mentioning 3ome of the security aspects of the Pacific<br />
region.<br />
For as a region we can only fulfil our vanguard role in the<br />
world economy and continue to improve the living standards<br />
of our people if we can maintain regional peace.<br />
Stability in the Asia-Pacific region has improved<br />
immeasurably since the devastation of the Pacific war, the<br />
violence of the Korean War and the protracted suffering in<br />
Indo-Chinai.<br />
But we cannot afford to become complacent about<br />
developments. Dangers persist on the Korean peninsula.<br />
Southeast Asia cannot be free of tension while Vietnam<br />
remains i~ ol. ated and dependent on the Soviet Union as a<br />
result of its military occupation of Cambodia.<br />
And may I tzke this opportunity to say that nothing could do<br />
more to seat back the long-term prospects for stability in<br />
our region than any attempt to overthrow the Government of<br />
President Aquino, whose coming to power at the beginning of<br />
this year lifted a dark cloud from our midst and offered the<br />
promise of oestoring the Philippines to the mainstream of<br />
regional poliAtics and constructive cooperation.<br />
Governments of the Pacific Rim must never accept that peace<br />
is an issue of legitimate interest only to the nuclear<br />
powers. South Pacifc countries have taken an important initiative<br />
in the craation of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone,<br />
which is a aignificant contribution to arms control and<br />
disarmament, as well as a major step towards regional<br />
security.<br />
This initiative, and others such as ASEAN's concept of South<br />
East Asia as a Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality, will<br />
help to enhance the Asia-Pacific region's prospects as an<br />
area of progress and prosperity. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Mr Premier, let me congratulate you, the Western Australian<br />
Government and the People of Perth for having the foresight<br />
and skill to bring about this important conference. It is a<br />
privilege for me to declare the PacRim ' 86 conference open.<br />
I wish you well in your deliberations. And I trust those<br />
visiting from overseas will not make this their last visit<br />
to Western Australia.<br />
I now have pleasure in introducing the United States<br />
Ambassador to Australia, Ambassador Bill Lane. </p>
