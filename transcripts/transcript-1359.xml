FOR PRESS POLYVINYL CHLORIDE PRODUCTS<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister,<br />
and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr. J. MoEwen)<br />
The Acting Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
Trade and Industry, Mr. J. McEwen, announced today that<br />
temporary duties would operate as from Monday morning<br />
on certain polyvinyl chloride products, viz:-sheet,.<br />
film, textile coated or supported fabrics, curtains ' and<br />
tablecloths. The temporary duties would be in addition to<br />
t~ he normal duties, but would not apply to goods in dirg*<br />
transit to Australia on 2nd June, 1966 and entered fov<br />
home consumption wi+ hin twenty-one days after importation.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the temporary duties were<br />
as recommended by the Special Advisory Authority, Sir'Frank<br />
Meere, who had been requested to conduct an inquiry<br />
into claims by the Australian industry that urgent action<br />
was necessary to protect the industry from import<br />
competition, in the-main from Japan.<br />
The Tariff Board has been asked to inquire and<br />
report on the protective needs of the industry, and ' the<br />
temporary protection now imposed is holding action pending<br />
the Governiment' s decision on receipt of the Tariff Board<br />
report. Mr. McEwen went on to say that, in his report,<br />
Sir Frank Meere had referred to the fact that a suggestion<br />
had been put forward on behalf of the Japan Vinyl Goods<br />
Manufacturers' Association for some restriction of exports </p>
<p>from Japan to Australia. However, this offer to control<br />
exports to Australia had been made at a late stage of the<br />
inquiry and there had not been sufficient time for Sir<br />
Frank Meere to obtain the views of other interested<br />
parties or to give it adequate consideration.<br />
Since the'I report has been received there has<br />
been further representations about voluntary restraint<br />
of exports from Japan but so far there has not been a<br />
specific proposal put forward for the Government to<br />
consider, Mr. McEwen said.<br />
The Government would, however, be prepared t~ o<br />
give serious consideration to a proposal which would<br />
provide satisfactory holding action until the Government~<br />
has made its decision following the Tariff Board report.<br />
Accordingly, provision is being made now which would allow<br />
the previous duties to operate without the additional<br />
temporary duties if such a proposal is actoepted,<br />
Copies of the Special Advisory Authority's<br />
report, which will be tabled in the Parliament, are<br />
available from the Department of Trade and Industry,<br />
Canberra and Collectors of Customs in all States.<br />
