PRrLvIE MINISTER'S VISIT TO U. S ITD U. K.<br />
Exchange of' remarks between President Johnson of the<br />
U. S. and Prime Minister Harold Holt of' Australia at<br />
arrival ceremonies for the Prime Minister on the<br />
South Lawn of the * White House. 29th June. 1966.<br />
ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT JOHSNSON:<br />
Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Holt:<br />
. ie greet you this morning as friend and partner.<br />
It is a very genuine pleasure to welcoirie you and M. rs. Hclt,<br />
and the distinguished members of your party, to our country.<br />
j\: jy personal ties to your country are as deep as a man' s<br />
can be. During the war I found among you openhearted<br />
friendship when I was far from,, home. Now, once again, our two<br />
nations are fighting side by side in the defence of freedom.<br />
The first thing that I read every morning are the<br />
battle reports from Viet Nam. I want you to know that I follow<br />
the exploits of 4~, 500 Australians fighting there with the<br />
same interest and concern as those of our ow. n men. Mr. Prime<br />
Minister, I take great pride in their courage and their<br />
dedication. I derive great strength from the sacrifices they<br />
are making. You in Australia know that in Viet Nam we are meeting<br />
a challea. ge which just must be met. It imst be met because<br />
it is always dangerous to let aggression succeed. It must be<br />
met becauge our SEATO commitments require us to defend the<br />
people of South Viet Nam from external attack.<br />
It must be met because the security of Australia and the<br />
United Status of 1America is directly at stake in preserving<br />
the independence and the freedom of the nations of South East<br />
Asia. Jie also know that behind the struggle against<br />
aggression in Viet Nam a vital, free Asia is rapidly emerging.<br />
Shielded by the courage of the Vietnamese and their allies,<br />
many Asian countries are driving forward with real success in<br />
their economic and social development.<br />
Vte all know of the remnarkable growth of Australia and<br />
Japan in recent years. But last year the growth rate in South<br />
Korea was 8 per cent., in Taiwan it was 7 per cent., in<br />
Malaysia it was 512 per cent., in Thiland it was 6 per cent.<br />
Growth in Iran has been averaging better than 6 per cent a year. </p>
<p>Pakistan is rapidly recovering from the setback<br />
caused by the conflict last year.<br />
Last week I received word from India which moved<br />
me greatly. The monsoons have begun. It looks as though<br />
the rainfall this year will be ample and the harvt will be<br />
good. With adequate rainfall, the courageous measures of the<br />
Indian government, and the support of the world cormunity, I<br />
hope and I expect that India will surge forward in the year<br />
ahead. Indonesia is turning the corner into the most<br />
promising phase of its postwar history.<br />
M1eanwhile, there is rising in Asia a new spirit of<br />
regional association and regional self-confidencu. It was<br />
that spirit to which I responded and which I tried to encourage<br />
in the talk I gave in Baltimore in April, 1965.<br />
Now the dream of an Asian development bank is a reality,<br />
binding up the peoples from Teheran to Seoul in a great common<br />
enterprise. . ork goes forward to develop the M4ekong Valley,<br />
despite the conflict close by.<br />
I know that Australia has, for many years, assuned a<br />
majcr responsibility for the security and the development of<br />
its region, through the Colombo Plan, the ,1ekong Committee,<br />
SEATO, and bilateral contributions to developing regions of<br />
the area. Our ovn security is heightened because we are<br />
joined with you in hNZUS.<br />
vie feel a new sense of fellowship and conmon destiny<br />
emerging in Asia. followed with great interest the recent<br />
meeting in Seoul of the Asian and Pacific Council, in which<br />
your government participated.<br />
Nations that were long isolated from each other are<br />
now beginning to know each other and to find new cormon ground.<br />
Old antagonisms are giving way to a new awareness that there<br />
are great possibilities in working togethcr, great challenges<br />
to be met and great jobs to be done.<br />
Above all, Asia is proving once agai-that stability<br />
and power are not to be found in tyranny and aggressive wars<br />
against a neighbour.<br />
Stability and power come frca free men and free nations<br />
working together on behalf of the people. de both know that<br />
should we fail in Viet Nan these new possibilities in free Asia<br />
would be endangered or destroyed. </p>
<p>M1r. Prime Minister, as you co,. e this morning to this<br />
house on your long-awaited visit, I wish to tell you and,<br />
through you, to tell your wonderful people, that we shall not<br />
fail. W~ e shall persist. 14e shall succeed.<br />
The good, brave people of South Viet Namn shall be given<br />
their chance to forge their own destiny in peace.<br />
The free peoples of Asia shall be given their chance<br />
to shape the destiny of their own region.<br />
These are your goals in Asia, M'r. Prime Minister, and<br />
they are ' also the goals of the United States of America.<br />
delcome.<br />
llro President and Mlrs. Johnson..<br />
Thank you for your warm welcomne, Mr. President. You<br />
have said warin and generous things about Australia andits<br />
people. Wk-hat a memorable morning for the Australian people and<br />
f or an Australian Prime Minister. I thank you for the honour<br />
which, by this ceremonial, you have accorded to my country and<br />
you have accorded to me. vhat has been done will be appreciated<br />
deeply by my people as it is by myself as head of my government.<br />
4e meet, Mr. President, as heads of government while<br />
our two nations are again-comrades in arms. This is at least<br />
the fourth time in this century that Americans and Australians<br />
have combined together vvith other friendly forces to resist<br />
aggression. We fought alongside each other in two world wars, and<br />
then Australia was the first country, I believe, to announce<br />
itself beside you when America iiade the historic decision to<br />
bring its strength to the aid of South Korea.<br />
I say historic decision advisedly, because I believe<br />
that to have been, Mr. President, one of the turning points<br />
in human history. I believe at that critical point of time<br />
was decided the issue of whether we handed Asia over to<br />
penetrating, aggressive communism, or whether we kept intact<br />
a large part of Asia as member countries of the coimÃ± pany of<br />
free people throughout the world.<br />
Australia was with you when you decided on the<br />
decision, critical also to you and to us, in South Viet Nam,<br />
another battleground against communist aggression.<br />
You have spoken of the task force of Australians which<br />
is now assembled in Saigon. You will be aware, M~ r. President,<br />
that in other parts of South Last Asia Australia is making<br />
a military contribution, small by the standards of your own<br />
great country, but useful in the company in w.-hich we find<br />
ourselves there. </p>
<p>I know that this task force in South Viet Nam will<br />
acquit itself with disti-ction. The men that are serving<br />
there are men of quality. They are well trained. The<br />
first battalion was accorded the highest commendation by your<br />
own leaders and by the leaders of South Viet Nam. The task<br />
force which follows them will acquit them selves With no<br />
less courage and distinction.<br />
The outcome of this struggle is critical for the<br />
hopes that you and we share for a better and more secure way<br />
of life for the free people of Asia.<br />
You have spoken of the vital free Asia that is<br />
emerging. I can speak of this from some personal experience,<br />
because not merely do we have a view from dom under which is<br />
pelhaps a different perspective from that of others in<br />
different parts of the world, but it has been my own good<br />
fortune in recent times to have travelled over several of these<br />
coLntries of South East Asia.<br />
W, hat has occurred over recent years is a transformation.<br />
To go through Thailand, 1,1alaysia, and even South Viet Nam,<br />
itself, and see the massive support being rendered there, see<br />
the security, the progress which has beon found possible by<br />
these other countries where com,: unism has successfully been<br />
held in check to see these things is to give heartening<br />
encouragement to go on with the job of resisting aggression<br />
where we find it.<br />
But it does not take a war to bring Americans and<br />
Australians close together. vq'e like each other. Friendships<br />
form quickly between us. le have many mutually beneficial<br />
links., our trade with each other., the investment that you<br />
make with us with your capital. ge co-operate in many<br />
constructive international interests and oauses.<br />
You mentioned, 1ir. President, your time in Australia<br />
years ago. A new Australia has arisen since then. When<br />
can we ste you there again? And this time we hope with Mrs.<br />
Johnson, and perhaps the whole family.<br />
You will be encouraged to see the National growth in<br />
which many American skills and resources have assisted.<br />
lIr. President, we recognize all too clearly in my ovn<br />
country that on yoa, personally, falls the heavy and at times<br />
lonely responsibility of free world leadership on your country<br />
these burdens have been assumed in comparatively recent times<br />
in terms of modern history. But America has shouldered those<br />
burdens firmly, and you have inspired and encouraged us all by<br />
the strength of your own resolution. </p>
<p>You know that in Australia you have an understanding<br />
friend. I am here, Sir, not asking for anything an<br />
erperience which I am sure you value at times when it is not<br />
sofrequent as it might be.<br />
You have in us not merely an understanding friend, but<br />
one staunch in the belief of the need for our presence with<br />
you in Viet Nam. vie are not there because it is right to be<br />
there, and, like you, vie shalh stay there as long as seems<br />
necessary in order to achieve the purposes of the South<br />
Vietnamese government and the purposes that we join in<br />
formulating and progressing together.<br />
And so, sir, in the lonelier and perhaps even more<br />
disheartening moments which comre to any national leader, I hope<br />
there will be a corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer<br />
froii the fact that you have an adiiring friend, a staunch<br />
friend, that will be all the way with LBJ. </p>
