TRANSCRIPT OF' THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, DARWIN, FEBRUARY 19 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, what did you discuss in your meeting<br />
with Mar-shall Perron?<br />
PM: We discussed a number of things including the railway<br />
and I toild him of the railway that if there is a<br />
project developer of substance, if the economics of the<br />
line change with low inflation and higher potential of<br />
freight usage from the last study we did in the middle<br />
of the 1980s, then the Commonwealth would look at it.<br />
But it has to be more than good intentions by the<br />
Northern~ Territory Government to put in a modest amount<br />
of money, good intentions by the Commonwealth and good<br />
intenticons by a railway builder. There has to be a<br />
project financier developer, and at this stage we can't<br />
quite see one. So in other words if the Northern<br />
Territory community can't carry the cost of the<br />
railway, which of course it couldn't, if there is no<br />
serious project developer the Commonwealth would simply<br />
be picking uip the cost of it, which of course the<br />
Commonwealth isn't prepared to do. But it is prepared<br />
to look at a commercial project. So if the economics<br />
of the project has changed materially, if there is a<br />
company of substance or a consortium of substance,<br />
other than someone simply wanting to build a railway<br />
line, that is other than railway builders, then we will<br />
look at it.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Considering the history of 50 years ago, obviously very<br />
well. Japan is now Australia's major trading partner.<br />
We are now seeing a lot of Japanese people coming to<br />
this country. Australia is much more part of Asia than<br />
it was then and therefore the transformation has been<br />
quite remarkable. But I think Japan has also got to<br />
acknowledge, candidly, its past and in that sense come<br />
to terms: with its neighbours as well as it has<br />
commercially and industrially.<br />
J: Northern Territory in the February Statement?<br />
PM: Well you'll-have to wait until the February statement<br />
for that. I<br />
ends </p>
