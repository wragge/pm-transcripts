    <content><![CDATA[<p>
The Australian Government condemns in the strongest terms the murders earlier today of four people  -  a Rabbi, two of his children, and a student  -  at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France.  Another student was seriously wounded. </p>
<p>Under French law, this is an act of terrorism, and under the law of humanity, this is an act of irredeemable evil. </p>
<p>Our sympathies go out to the families of those who were murdered; to the Jewish community of France, which has unfortunately suffered previous acts of terrorism in France; and to the French people, who are all searching for answers in the face of such a tragedy.</p>
<p>We share their resolve that those responsible for this crime, and other hate crimes that have occurred recently in France, will be brought to swift and certain justice. </p>
