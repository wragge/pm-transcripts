EXTRACTS FROM A SPEECH AT THE TASMANIAN A. L. P.<br />
CONFERENCE, DEVONPORT, TASMANIA.<br />
4 MARCH 1973, BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
M. P.<br />
LEADER OF THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARY LABOR PARTY<br />
1. Exactly six years ago 16 March 1967<br />
I made my first address to an A. L. P. Conference as the<br />
Party's leader, here at Devonport.<br />
2. It was a critical time in thehistory and<br />
fortunes of our Party. We had just emerged from our<br />
worst defeat. There were people inside and outside the<br />
Party who genuinely questioned whether the A. L. P. could<br />
long endure.<br />
3. I said then<br />
It There are literally millions of<br />
ordinary Australians who wish profoundly to see<br />
a Labor Government in Canberra; there are<br />
thousands who are willing to work actively to<br />
secure that Government; there are hundreds<br />
upon hundreds who want to give their time,<br />
ideas, energy and money towards it. No<br />
party is so rich in its potential resources.<br />
It is our duty to encourage, develop and use<br />
those human resources of energy and goodwill.<br />
4. That was what I set out to do. My gratitude<br />
is deep and my debt immense to all those who joined in<br />
that great crusade for it was nothing less than that.<br />
The role of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Branch<br />
and my colleagues from Tasmania has been decisive.<br />
a) First there is my personal and political<br />
debt to Lance Barnard<br />
b. The Tasmanian Branch was the first to<br />
support my efforts to secure re-organisation<br />
of the party structure, and Tasmania gave<br />
unwavering support at every stage,<br />
culminating in the great re-construction<br />
in the two great mainland States. This was<br />
the key to victory.<br />
c) Eric Reece's smashing victory last April<br />
set the pace of Labor's Aational march for<br />
the rest of the year. From that time on,<br />
we never looked back.<br />
d) The magnificent Tasmanian performance in the<br />
House of Representatives elections a clean<br />
sweep clinched the victory. ./ 2 </p>
<p>I may say in passing that there is cold<br />
comfort indeed for our opponents in their claim that<br />
the swing to Labor was not so great after all. This<br />
is true only in relation to the great gains we made<br />
in 1969 17 seats with a massive swing of The<br />
1972 election was in essence the last round in a<br />
six-year battle, and our share of the 1972 vote after<br />
preferences was in fact greater 52% as against 51%<br />
than the Liberal-Country Party achieved under Menzies<br />
in 1949.<br />
6. We now look to a great future, for our<br />
country, and for our Party. Hard as the past years may have<br />
been, they have had one great advantage. We were able to<br />
use those years preparing relevant and modern policies.<br />
No Australian Government has come to office so well<br />
equipped with men and measures for the great tasks ahead.<br />
That is why we have been able to move so swiftly in the<br />
first few weeks. We did not wake up to find ourselves in<br />
office and then wondering " Well, what do we do now<br />
We knew exactly what we wanted to do and exactly what the<br />
people wanted us to do.<br />
The Parliament which has just opened will be<br />
the great Reform Parliament in Australian history. It has<br />
a double task to clear away the backlog of the past<br />
23 years and to build new machinery adequate for the needs<br />
and hopes of Australians for the rest of this century and<br />
beyond. </p>
