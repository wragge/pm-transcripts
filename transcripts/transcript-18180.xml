Today I am announcing the membership of a high-level advisory panel for the White Paper on Australia in the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The shift of economic and strategic weight to Asia has never been more profound for Australia's interests than it is now.</p>
<p>The White Paper will provide a national blueprint for Australia at a time of transformative economic growth and change in Asia. It will help Australia navigate the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The advisory panel brings together an exceptional array of experience from business, academia and government in meeting the opportunities and challenges the Asian Century poses for Australia.</p>
<p>The advisory panel will provide guidance to the whole-of-government task force, led by Dr Ken Henry AC, which will develop analysis and proposals for consideration by the Government.</p>
<p>I am particularly pleased to welcome three prominent Australians from outside government to the panel.</p>
<p>Professor Peter Drysdale AM has spent a lifetime working on Asia. He is widely regarded as the leading intellectual architect of APEC and has written extensively on international trade and economic policy in East Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Ms Catherine Livingstone AO is a leading Australian business figure. She is currently Chair of Telstra Corporation and a director of a number of top Australian companies. Through her past leadership of the Australian Business Foundation, she has encouraged research and policy development to boost Australia's capabilities and global competitiveness.</p>
<p>Mr John Denton is a partner and the Chief Executive Officer of Corrs Chambers Westgarth. He has extensive working experience in Asia. He is a board member of the Asia Society AustralAsia Centre and one of three Prime Ministerial representatives on the APEC Business Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Dr Henry, Professor Drysdale, Ms Livingstone and Mr Denton will also sit on a Committee of Cabinet which will be established to oversee preparation of the White Paper.</p>
<p>Three senior government officials will serve with the non-Government representatives on Dr Henry's advisory panel: Dr Gordon de Brouwer from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr David Gruen from the Treasury and Dr Heather Smith from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
<p>The development of the White Paper will include an intensive period of consultation with the Australian community, business, academia and international partners.</p>
<p>Dr Henry's taskforce is due to report to Cabinet in the first half of 2012, with the White Paper to be released in mid 2012.</p>
<p>The White Paper will make a major contribution to public debate and establish major new directions for public policy.</p>
<p>I congratulate the advisory panel members on their appointment. They will be playing an important role in helping to shape Australia's future prosperity over the coming century. </p>
