FOR PRESS 1 JULY 1977<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE/ LOAN COUNCIL MEETING 1 JULY 1977<br />
Today's Premiers' Conference had before it a long agenda,<br />
including some complex matters relating to the details of the<br />
new tax sharing arrangements.<br />
Under tax sharing, the states and local government authorities<br />
already have access to, and a guaranteed share of, income tax<br />
revenues. In the next stage the states will be able to increase<br />
or decrease their shares of those revenues by increasing or<br />
decreasing the rates of income tax payable by their residents.<br />
It is important for the proper operation of responsible government<br />
that the spending government should carry the responsibility also<br />
for raising the money it spends. The tax sharing arrangements<br />
are directed to ensuring that this is the situation at all levels<br />
of government in Australia.<br />
This Premiers' Conference has not been a haggle over the level<br />
of general revenue funds to the states.<br />
The results of discussion on various aspects of tax sharing<br />
are as follows:<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAX SHARING<br />
Local government authorities receive each year 1.52% of nett<br />
personal income tax collections in the preceding year. In<br />
1976-77 they have received $ 140 million in this way which<br />
represented a 75% increase over similar funds in 1975-76.<br />
A further substantial increase is expected in 1977-78.<br />
The funds are paid to the states for on-passing to local<br />
authorities and the distribution between the states is<br />
determined on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants<br />
Commission. All state Premiers today agreed to accept the recommendations<br />
of the Report of the Grants Commission in respect of new local<br />
government relativities. These new relativities are to apply<br />
from 1977-78. / Amending </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Amending legislation will be given priority in the Budget<br />
sittings and it is not expected to cause any delays in<br />
payments to local government authorities this year.<br />
The total amount of local government's entitlements will be<br />
known shortly when the final figure for nett personal income<br />
tax collections ( excluding the Medibank levy) for 1976-77 are<br />
available. Set out below is a table showing the relativities<br />
agreed by the Premiers. New Previous<br />

STATES' STAGE 1 TAX SHARING ENTITLEMENTS<br />
There have been problems this year caused by the fluctuations in<br />
the estimates of the tax sharing entitlements. This is largely<br />
because states opted to have their tax sharing entitlements<br />
calculated as a percentage of the current year's personal income<br />
tax collections, which are not finally known until after 30 June.<br />
The Prime Minister suggested that stages might reconsider the<br />
earlier Commonwealth proposal that the previous year's collections<br />
be used as the base.<br />
He offered payment of tax sharing entitlements for 1977-78 to the<br />
states of $ 4,336.1 million if they were to decide on adoption of<br />
that proposal. ( This would be subject to adjustments on account<br />
of over payments in 1976-77 of their entitlements for that year<br />
but would represent an increase in excess of $ 600 million over<br />
the 1976-77 entitlement).<br />
The Premiers agreed that Commonwealth and State officers should<br />
examine and report on arrangements for changing the total tax<br />
sharing entitlements from 33.6% of the current years collections<br />
to an appropriate percentage of the previous year's collections.<br />
This would reduce the uncertainty and the administrative<br />
difficulties. Local government tax sharing entitlements<br />
presently are based on collections in the preceding year.<br />
Officers will also look at consequential matters arising from<br />
such a change in arrangements and at the manner in which changes<br />
in population estimates are taken into account in determining<br />
state relativities from 1977-78. / PRE-BUDGET INFORMATION </p>
<p>-3<br />
PRE-BUDGET INFORMATION<br />
The Prime Minister indicated that the Commonwealth was unable<br />
to provide pre-Budget information to the states other than<br />
that presently available, namely:<br />
A preliminary estimate of each state's Stage 1<br />
entitlement for year ahead on basis of then<br />
current Commonwealth tax legislation;<br />
An estimate of the yield of a 1% surcharge/ cost<br />
of a 1% rebate in that state on basis of then<br />
current Commonwealth tax legislation;<br />
Estimate of entitlement under former financial<br />
assistance grants arrangements ( the guaranteed<br />
entitlement); Relevant wage assumptions underlying the<br />
above estimates; and<br />
Certain other information to the extent this<br />
is practicable and consistent with Budget<br />
security.<br />
The conflict between the requirements of Budget security and<br />
the states' need for information would not arise if the states<br />
were to agree to their tax sharing entitlements being based on<br />
the previous year's collections.<br />
REVIEW OF STATE RELATIVITIES<br />
Some Premiers indicated they were not entirely happy with the<br />
terms of reference for the review as provided in the states<br />
( Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill now before the Senate.<br />
The Prime Minister agreed that officers would consult on the<br />
guidelines and would also give consideration to suggested<br />
amendments proposed by some of the Premiers.<br />
In view of previous lack of unanimity about the composition of<br />
the review body the Prime Minister suggested that the states<br />
might like to accept the compromise proposal, a special<br />
division of the Grants Commission supplemented by nominees<br />
from the states.<br />
It was agreed that the body to review the relativities should be<br />
composed of the Chairman of the Grants Commission, two members<br />
of the Commission, plus three additional members, one of whom<br />
would be nominated by N. S. W. and Victoria and two by the four<br />
other states. / INCOME TAX </p>
<p>-4-<br />
INCOME TAX ( ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE STATES) BILL<br />
This Commonwealth legislation, which would permit the stages<br />
if they so chose to impose a surcharge or grant a rebate on<br />
Commonwealth personal income tax in respect of taxpayers in<br />
their states, was discussed briefly.<br />
The Prime Minister welcomed any suggestions or comments on<br />
the draft legislation from the states, and proposed that<br />
such comments be examined by Commonwealth and state officers. </p>
