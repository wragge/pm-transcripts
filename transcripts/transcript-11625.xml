    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.........................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Campbell to you and my Ministerial colleagues, Nick</p>
<p> Minchin in particular, the co-organisers and co-hosts of this very remarkable</p>
<p> gathering of very dedicated, diverse and distinguished Australians. To</p>
<p> the Chief Scientist of Israel, Dr Orna Berry, to the Chief Scientist of</p>
<p> Australia, Dr Rob Batterham, to my other ministerial colleagues and ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen.</p>
<p>As I am sure you know my professional odyssey before I became a politician,</p>
<p> I am normally described as being a suburban solicitor although the reality</p>
<p> is that I practiced in the central business district of Sydney all of</p>
<p> my professional career. And therefore I guess the peripheral cynic would</p>
<p> say that my understanding of and association with science and innovation</p>
<p> was not very great when I entered Federal Parliament. And I have to say</p>
<p> to you that in the almost four years now that I have been Prime Minister,</p>
<p> one of the most rewarding personal experiences that I have had is to be</p>
<p> exposed as Chairman of the Prime Minister's Science Council, as I</p>
<p> still generically call it, during that period of time. And that exposure</p>
<p> has been something of a personal journey and experience for me I frankly</p>
<p> admit to coming to that position, committed to the ideals of a partnership</p>
<p> between Government, the business community, the scientists, the innovators,</p>
<p> the inventors and the researchers of Australia, and having a very clear</p>
<p> view that that was tremendously important to the development, particularly</p>
<p> because of the Australian culture of a can-do economy, and a can-do society.</p>
<p> But that experience over the last four years has left a very significant</p>
<p> impression on me.</p>
<p>I don't mind acknowledging that the genesis of my own very strong</p>
<p> personal support for quite a number of the Government's significant</p>
<p> decisions over that period of time which has resonated so importantly</p>
<p> in the areas for which you have responsibility. The genesis of that has</p>
<p> come out of the working of that council. I think particularly of the focus</p>
<p> that it brought to me in relation to the importance of investment in health</p>
<p> and medical research in our country, which of course has lead to the Government's</p>
<p> doubling of our commitment in that area over the next four years. So tremendously</p>
<p> important to not only the domestic but also the international reputation</p>
<p> and research capacity in those areas of Australia her scientists and her</p>
<p> doctors. And, of course, the focus that was brought to bear in the council</p>
<p> on the importance of the interaction of the investment incentives that</p>
<p> operate within our taxation system towards the contribution that people</p>
<p> make to encouraging investment in innovation, in new ventures and the</p>
<p> desirability of having a taxation regime that encourages the risk-taking</p>
<p> and the patience that is required to bring those things about. And that</p>
<p> of course played a very significant role, not only in shaping my own attitude,</p>
<p> but the attitude of many of my colleagues towards some of the decisions</p>
<p> that found their way in to the Government's business taxation reforms</p>
<p> that have now been agreed to and will be presented to the Parliament for</p>
<p> ratification within the next few weeks or months.</p>
<p>I mentioned those things in particular ladies and gentlemen to underline</p>
<p> a very strong personal commitment on my part to what this gathering is</p>
<p> about - an acknowledgment of the enormous importance to Australia's</p>
<p> future of her scientists, her engineers, medical researchers and all of</p>
<p> those that are broadly involved in the innovation process. As is often</p>
<p> the case in a political life, and particularly in the life of a Prime</p>
<p> Minister, there are conversations you have with people which leave you</p>
<p> with a very lasting impression, and cast a very long shadow, so to speak,</p>
<p> of your own understanding of how the world operates and the forces that</p>
<p> are likely to bear on that operation in the years ahead.</p>
<p>And one such of those conversations I had in July of 1997 with the then</p>
<p> and now recently reappointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve system of</p>
<p> the United States, Dr Alan Greenspan. And I asked him a fairly simplistic,</p>
<p> I suppose he'd been asked it a hundred times before, inquiring question</p>
<p> and I said can you please explain to me how it is that the United States</p>
<p> economy is performing with such spectacular strength at the present time.</p>
<p> And he said that he'd reached the age of 71 and he thought he understood</p>
<p> everything about economics and a lot about human nature, and he said frankly</p>
<p> he didn't really know. But he then went on to say if you really pressed</p>
<p> me to venture an opinion, he said I think it's got to do with the</p>
<p> enormous investment that our country has made in technology and the enormous</p>
<p> commitment of the business community and of the whole culture of the United</p>
<p> States in technology.</p>
<p>Now that piece of advice stayed with me and I was reminded of it a few</p>
<p> weeks ago when I read a speech he'd delivered in the United States</p>
<p> and he ventured the perhaps cheeky for an American, but nonetheless given</p>
<p> his position and entirely appropriate observation that one of the reasons</p>
<p> why he thought the economic growth of Europe and Japan had lagged somewhat</p>
<p> behind that of the United States was the fact that the investment of those</p>
<p> countries in technology and the commitment to innovation had not been</p>
<p> as great as had been in the United States.</p>
<p>And I accept as Prime Minister of Australia that there is a lesson in</p>
<p> that for us. And if we are to achieve with the assets that we have, and</p>
<p> we've got a lot of assets that other countries don't have. If</p>
<p> we are to achieve the ideal of the can-do country in the twenty-first</p>
<p> century, we do have to understand the message that was implicit in the</p>
<p> Chairman's observation to me a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>And there are gathered in this room, people who will play a role in achieving</p>
<p> the ideal of a can-do country. It is a partnership. And I do acknowledge</p>
<p> the importance of the Summit having been organised as a joint effort of</p>
<p> the Business Council of Australia and of the Government. The Government</p>
<p> does have a role, there is a role for public investment in research and</p>
<p> development, and I hope that we have demonstrated that and demonstrated</p>
<p> it in a very significant way.</p>
<p>I understand the debate about the level of taxation incentives, and of</p>
<p> course that will be one of the things that will come out of this Summit</p>
<p> as a recommendation. I understand that. I also understand the importance</p>
<p> of innovation and technology in responding to one of the major contemporary</p>
<p> social and political challenges of Australia, today and that is the impact</p>
<p> of economic change on the regions and the rural areas of Australia.</p>
<p>It probably hasn't escaped your attention that over the past few</p>
<p> days, I spent a week travelling around rural Australia. And I visited</p>
<p> a combination of what you would loosely call towns representative of what</p>
<p> we call the bush and areas that are more akin to the prosperous regional,</p>
<p> particularly coastal towns and cities of Australia.</p>
<p>And there were many things that I took away from that week. I was of</p>
<p> course left with a very deep impression of the debilitating impact of</p>
<p> longterm declines in commodity prices and the adversity compounding that</p>
<p> of weather in many parts of Australia. And I was also left of course with</p>
<p> some tremendous good news stories of the tremendous success of the cotton</p>
<p> industry in western New South Wales - encouraged by very sophisticated</p>
<p> irrigation technology and the extraordinarily sophisticated technology</p>
<p> and innovation surrounding the tuna industry in Port Lincoln. A world</p>
<p> class and world competitive industry.</p>
<p>And the relevance of that experience to me and for me when I think about</p>
<p> this Innovation Summit was that it was a very strong reminder of how part</p>
<p> of the answer to the challenge of the bush and the challenge of regional</p>
<p> Australia is to make absolutely certain that we marshal technological</p>
<p> skill, we marshal innovation to the advantage of our fellow Australians</p>
<p> who live outside the major capital cities. And one of their great entreaties</p>
<p> to me, and I am sure to all who care to listen is that they share to the</p>
<p> full in the development of the information technology era, which is having</p>
<p> such a profound impact on all of our lives.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of a gathering such as this, because it brings</p>
<p> together not only ministers and leaders of the business community, but</p>
<p> also people of eminence in the academic community, practitioners in science</p>
<p> and medicine and engineering and also people who are playing a trailblazing</p>
<p> role so far as information technology is concerned in this country is</p>
<p> that it does drive home the importance of the linkages between the Government</p>
<p> and all those other sections of the community.</p>
<p>I've often spoken in another context of how as I look back of the</p>
<p> last twenty or thirty years of politics, not only here in Australia, but</p>
<p> also around the rest of the democratic world, that we've really gone</p>
<p> through in a sense three phases in the interaction of government and the</p>
<p> private sector and the rest of the community. I think we did go through</p>
<p> a phase in the 1960's when we imagined that the solution to most</p>
<p> problems in this country lay in ever-increasing investment of resources</p>
<p> by government, particularly at a federal level, as being the answer to</p>
<p> all of our problems. And then as time went by there was something of a</p>
<p> reaction against that. And it was thought that the ideal situation was</p>
<p> for government to retreat to a fairly minimalist role in our society.</p>
<p> But I think as we've turned the page into the new century we've</p>
<p> shunned both of those extremes and we now see many problems as problems</p>
<p> that can be very effectively solved by an effective partnership or coalition,</p>
<p> a word I've used in another context, between the government and different</p>
<p> elements of our community. And I see this Summit today and this gathering</p>
<p> here tonight as being very much an expression of that.</p>
<p>I bring a very simple commitment to you, that the Government is totally</p>
<p> involved in harnessing the capacity of our scientists, our inventors,</p>
<p> our researchers, and our innovators to the economic and social future</p>
<p> of our nation. That's the broad commitment and that's the sense</p>
<p> of personal enthusiasm that I bring to it. You are entitled of course</p>
<p> to reserve judgement until you see the quality and nature of further Government</p>
<p> decisions. I hope that some of the decisions that we've taken to</p>
<p> date and I touched upon a few of them earlier in my remarks, are an earnest,</p>
<p> or a downpayment of what might be achieved in the future.</p>
<p>There are many challenges that will require the harnessing of your understanding</p>
<p> and your commitment. I thought again back to my experience of travelling</p>
<p> around the regions of Australia last week and one of course can't</p>
<p> escape for very long the challenge of water resources and the interaction</p>
<p> of the political and scientific and environmental issues that bear upon</p>
<p> that and the enormous threat posed by salinity to the economic base and</p>
<p> social future of many communities in Australia. And that is a challenge</p>
<p> for the Government, it will require the commitment it has already enjoyed</p>
<p> the commitment of large financial resources from the Government. And it</p>
<p> will require the cooperative effort of the Commonwealth Government as</p>
<p> well as the governments of the various Australian states.</p>
<p>So, tonight is an important opportunity for me to simply state a personal</p>
<p> and Government commitment to the cause that this Summit seeks to serve.</p>
<p> And it is an opportunity to thank all of you who made a contribution and</p>
<p> most particularly to thank my ministerial colleague, Nick Minchin, for</p>
<p> the tremendous contribution that he's made.</p>
<p>On one other personal note, could I conclude, and that is that I'm</p>
<p> sure many of you will be touched with a sense of sadness that we don't</p>
<p> have with us tonight Dr Malcolm McIntosh. Malcolm McIntosh who led the</p>
<p> CSIRO with such tremendous distinction was a member of the Science Council,</p>
<p> was a major contributor to government, not only here, but also in the</p>
<p> United Kingdom. I've had the experience of sitting around a Cabinet</p>
<p> table and listening both to ministerial colleagues and other advisers</p>
<p> and people from the business community and from academia and elsewhere</p>
<p> over the last four years. And rarely have I heard anybody who could present</p>
<p> an argument with such force and clarity, yet balanced than I did from</p>
<p> Malcolm McIntosh. And I would not want this occasion to go by without</p>
<p> recording my personal sadness at his death, acknowledging the contribution</p>
<p> that he made to the Australian people and the Australian Government. And</p>
<p> most particularly the contribution he made to CSIRO and an understanding</p>
<p> of so many of the things that are so enormously important to all of us.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your contribution of time and talent</p>
<p> and energy to innovation, to the sort of things that are very significantly</p>
<p> going to shape our society for years into the future. We will study very</p>
<p> carefully your recommendations. You will remember my statement of commitment</p>
<p> and support and quite properly you will make your judgements as the months</p>
<p> and the years unfold. I think this has been a great exercise and I thank</p>
<p> all of you for being an important part of it.</p>
