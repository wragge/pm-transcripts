J, A Lb<br />
' PRIME MINISTER<br />
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AFTER SPEECH AT NSW ECONOMIC SOCIETY<br />
FINANCIAL FORECASTING DINNER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, you mentioned very early in your<br />
speech that the Accord was not something that was open to the<br />
Opposition should they become Government. Could you expand on<br />
that, is that really because a Liberal Government would not deal<br />
with the ACTU or because the ACTU would not co-operate with the<br />
Liberal Government.<br />
F14: No, it is because the Opposition have repudiated the concept<br />
that underlies the Accord. They are entitled to do that but one<br />
would have thought that they would have had the good sense to<br />
learn from history. They apparently are labouring, or at least a<br />
section of them, as they are not united vn this as they are not on<br />
any'issue. But on this particular issue the general position is,<br />
and one certainly put out in policy, that the concept of a<br />
centralised system which is essential to the Accord would not be<br />
the most appropriate wages system for Australia. They believe that<br />
it would be appropriate to return to the disastrous sort of<br />
scenario like the events of 1980 when the centralised system was<br />
abondoned. Fortunately we are in the situation where we don't have<br />
to be theoretical to test their policy. We just have to look back<br />
at what happened in 1980 when the centralised system was abandoned<br />
and we had the wages explosion. of course, it is the fact that if<br />
you didn't have a system that operates under the Accord now you<br />
would have wages booms going considerably beyond what has<br />
happened/ will happen under the Accord. It just defies belief to<br />
imagine that after two years of high growth and another one in<br />
prospect, if you went for the system of allowing unions to<br />
negotiate with employers, that you wouldn't get higher wages<br />
outcomes. So they, the Opposition, and I don't think I am being<br />
critical as they are entitled to be wrong. In a sense I suppose I<br />
welcome it because the Australian people will clearly come to<br />
understand the stupidity of their position. But they have,<br />
according to their philosophy, adopted the view that it is much<br />
better in this critically important area not to have a centralised<br />
system where you have the opportunity of government negotiating<br />
with unions and with employers and operating within the<br />
commissioned systems to apply principles calculated to maximise<br />
growth. They say it is better to allow the free market to operate.<br />
Now in the present situation, you would have no chance whatsoever,<br />
under their system, of dealing with the problem created by the<br />
II </p>
<p>depreciation. As I said in my address, the central responsibility<br />
of the community now is to try and ensur, th~ it the advantages for<br />
our international competitive position proviC'ed by the significant<br />
depreciation should not be dissipated by ( inaudible) into<br />
cost price spiral and if you were just leaving the market, of<br />
course industrial power would be used, but employers would agree<br />
to significant wage increases. You wouldn't have any chance of<br />
meeting the central policy of getting there. We will under the<br />
policy. So the answer to your question. It is not because of any<br />
other reason than that the Opposition has repudiated the concept<br />
and they haven't been secretive about it. They have had nothing<br />
but contempt for the policy despite the outstanding successes that<br />
have been associated with it. May they contin~ ue to be so<br />
misguided. QUESTION: Mr Prime minister, could I ask a question about the<br />
PSBR, you were kind enough to suggest, as the Treasurer did, that<br />
the PSBR would be reduced by 1% in 1985-86. That figure of 1% is<br />
most interesting of course, but the question that one might ask is<br />
that as that figure in the context of the 1970' s and the early<br />
1980' s is still historically high, what is the relevance therefore<br />
for merely a 1% reduction if we are going to have a 5% increase in<br />
the GDP? Could it be inferred that the reduction should be a lot<br />
higher, a lot greater, than 1%.<br />
PM: Well obviously and in the economic context you could hope<br />
that the particular relevant factors could move more in a<br />
particular-direction which you will perceive is their result. The<br />
important thing, surely, is that we have been able, by our own<br />
actions, to reduce our demands in this area. And importantly and<br />
in a sense a more difficult task is being accomplished in getting<br />
the States to agree to limiting their demands. Now it simply means<br />
that as a result of that reduction in demand by ourselves and the<br />
States, that in an expanding situation there will be less<br />
competition in the private sector in capital markets. Now sure you<br />
can eliminate that demand altogether or you can very very<br />
substantially eliminate it. But in the process, of course, you<br />
would be reducing the level of activity by the States and the<br />
Commonwealth and you simply have to make a judgment of balance as<br />
to how far in the situation, whereas a result of your opponents'<br />
stimulatory policies, you have produced spectacularly successful<br />
economic growth and you see the private sector now beginning to<br />
expand. flow far do you withdraw that-degree of stimulus? I think<br />
we are entitled as we go into our third year to be judged as<br />
fairly good estimators of what the appropriate balance is. After<br />
all we have got the runs -on the board. We have made the right<br />
judgments as to what the right mix should. be. We have got better<br />
results than just about anyone in the world. We believe that the<br />
sort of mixture that we have got now will provide the appropriate<br />
mix, if you like, of activity within the public sector and still<br />
allow in this growth situation, the third year of substantial<br />
growth, will allow the private sector to be accommodated in its<br />
demands as it takes up more of the thrust of growth. We think we<br />
have got it right. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, how do you plan to stop the flow<br />
through of tax increases included in tne cost of living into<br />
wages PM: Tax increases?<br />
QUESTION: Oil price increases, increases in transport costs due<br />
to state government charges and so on.<br />
PM: Well I think you have got to talk about the present situation<br />
in two categories. I have ma~ e it quite clear that those increases<br />
in the CPI which have been associated with the depreciation will<br />
be taken into account. I have made it quite clear that we have put<br />
to the ACTU that these matters have to be taken into account. We<br />
have put all the options on the table, and I have given the<br />
undertaking and the Treasurer has given the undertaking, that we<br />
will see that in one way or another, or with a combination of<br />
measures, the Australian community will not lose the advantages of<br />
our very competitive position flowing from the depreciation. Now<br />
if your talking about other elements of the price index which flow<br />
from charges, and the increases in charges made by state<br />
governments, on their own independently of the depreciation<br />
effects which I have dealt. Well the answer is that you attempt in<br />
your overall economic policies to ensure that the increases t!-.-nt<br />
are made by state governments will be as minimal as possible asa<br />
res-ult of the decisions you take in conjunction with the States in<br />
terms of revenue sharing. We believe that in 83-84-85 we have had<br />
a singularly successful relationship with the States an6 that we<br />
have been Properly generous in the sharing of funds in a way which<br />
haven't imposed undue pressures upon them to raise their charges.<br />
So that is a way in which Commonwealth Government, Federal<br />
Government, can act. You can't stop some charges from going up. To<br />
the extent then that they were reflected in the price index is<br />
appropriate but that shouldn't wages. We have a particular<br />
issue, a particular problem now as a result of depreciation and we<br />
will deal with that.<br />
QUESTION: There is a lot of discussion today on the question of<br />
targeting put the view that targeting implies discipline on<br />
government.-I take the quite contrary view, I think that in many<br />
ways it is a cop out for the government to select a target that<br />
doesn't necessarily achieve the ends-that we as economists would<br />
like to set as targets. I think the absence of a target goes from<br />
the government to communi. cate much more regularly and much more<br />
carefully with the market extension and make much freer<br />
information on what it's doing to our economic........ I would just<br />
like to hear your views on the issue of monetary targeting.<br />
PM: I addressed myself to it to some extent in my address as you<br />
will appreciate. And I simply want to say this that as to<br />
why we believed it was appropriate to abandon the singular targets<br />
as we did. The changes that have been introduced by us into the<br />
markets following deregulation have produced results, distortions </p>
<p>which have made it, we believe, futile to adhera to that single<br />
target. And in my address I analyse all the features of this. I<br />
take your point that it is appropriate for the Gov'ernment to try<br />
and make as much information available as possible. It is seeking<br />
to do this. At this stage we are certainly not disposed to assume<br />
the use of the M3-and set targets-for them for that purpose<br />
because all the evidence has indicated that it would be quite<br />
inappropriate to do so. It would produce, we believe, quite<br />
inappropriate economic outcomes. We are open to persuasion, if you<br />
like, as to what is the best way of hearing our knowledge with the<br />
market, but we do not dispose to reverse our decision. We will not<br />
be reversing that decision. We will try as far as we can to direct<br />
ourselves through the Reserve Bank, make as mucn information<br />
available to the market as possibly can be done. We will not be<br />
perverting economic policy by adherence to some aggregate which is<br />
no longer appropriate to that task. If in fact........ there can be<br />
specific suggestions put to us, myself and the Treasurer, as to<br />
how we can achieve the objective that you talk about. We are open<br />
to suggestion.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, as you are aware, as far as the outside<br />
world is concerned, the Australian economy is basically a two<br />
product economy, that is rural and mining. As you are aware the<br />
worldwide rural and mining industries are in decline. The outlook<br />
for the longer term for both sectors isn't particularly brilliant.<br />
In the short term we have a reprieve through the devaluation whi. ch<br />
you have outlined and in the short term things are going to be<br />
maintained but surely the long term answer is not going to be the<br />
continuing devaluation of the Aussie dollar to offset the decline<br />
in our exports. I was just wondering sir, if you might be able to<br />
share with us tonight, any thoughts you might have about future<br />
policy initiatives which might help the Australian economy<br />
diversify away from its highly dependent status on rural and<br />
mining and what sort of economic policy initiatives may be<br />
considered in the future.<br />
PM: I had addressed myself to that issue to some extent in the<br />
address. i pointed out that we have addressed ourselves to the<br />
question of industry policy. We are not depending on rhetoric. We<br />
made the point as to what we have done, for instance in the steel<br />
industry. It was very interesting to see, I think it was in<br />
today's Melb'ourne Age Terry Brand's article where just what has<br />
happened within the steel industry in terms of its international<br />
competitiveness as a result of the combination of depreciation and<br />
not just depreciation but the significant increase in productivity<br />
that has been associated with the steel industry plan that we<br />
brought in. So not only there but in the automobile industry we<br />
have reached the stage now where one major producer is talking<br />
about exports of Australian vehicles to the United States. That is<br />
a significant improvement in that area of industry. And in the<br />
whole approach to industry policy our assumption has been that<br />
Australian industry hasn't been prepared to restructure itself. We<br />
are seeking to assist industry and trade unions and governments to<br />
work together to achieve those objectives. And we are not merely </p>
<p>going to particular sectors of industry in the way that I have<br />
just talked about, but I have established a committee of Ministers<br />
which is concerned with Australia's long term economic growth<br />
opportunities under the Chairmanship of Senator Button, the<br />
Minister for-Industry, Technolo ' gy and Commerce, and they will be<br />
reporting to~ the Cabinet on the range of policies which are<br />
necessary to achieve those objectives. All that we are doing in<br />
the area of industry training and retraining is calculated to try<br />
and produce a range of skills in the labour force to include<br />
training and education and retraining and re-education which will<br />
ensure that we do not suffer from absence of skills. We need to<br />
have not merely the training and mobility in the labour force to<br />
ensure that it will be able to service those industries which were<br />
able to develop and which will be able to, as I have said before I<br />
enmesh the Australian economy with this region. I think in terms<br />
of what we are prepared to do, in direct terms of industry policy<br />
of what we are prepared to do in the area of tax to develop<br />
research. And you know the initiative we have taken there. And in<br />
terms of training of our work force and retraining of our work<br />
force, we have made it clear that we are dedicated to enabling a<br />
restructuring of Australian industry to give the maximum<br />
opportunity of taking advantage of the fact that we are a part of<br />
the most dynamic region of the world. Our trade policies are<br />
calculated to achieve this. I believe that I am able to say now,<br />
just over two and a half years in office, that our relations with<br />
the region in qCneral and with China in particular are better than<br />
they have ever been before. So the combination of our general<br />
mac'ro-economic policies, our trade policies, our training<br />
policies, our education policies are all calculated to try and<br />
develop in Australia an industrial structure which will take to<br />
some extent account of the realities to which you refer. We can't<br />
think of an area of relevant economic policy in which we haven't<br />
directed attention and already produced policies or intending to<br />
produce policies calculated to achieve those results.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, I was very interested to hear your<br />
statement in your address that you plan to make an announcement<br />
regarding youth unemployment. I have two teenage children who<br />
often ask me the same sort of questions that the three teenagers<br />
asked you last week on " Pressure Point" program. I find again and<br />
again that I have the same problem as you had on that program and<br />
that is the'distinct lack of knowledge of the facts on the part of<br />
our teenagers and that a lot of thei-r statements are based on an<br />
underlying attitude that we don't seem to care. I think it came<br />
* through. You had to correct them a number of times on that program<br />
, and I find myself in the same position again and again. Can we<br />
expect on your announcement some real initiatives that show our<br />
unemployed youths that we ' the employed' do care?<br />
PM: Yes, I can give you an unqualified purpose to that. I<br />
obviously don't want to, nor am I in a position to, disclose all<br />
the details. But let me very briefly go to the elements which I<br />
believe are important. In think firstly it is important to get<br />
across to them that we, not merely as a Government but as a </p>
<p>4 6.<br />
community, do care. There is no doubt that there is a feeling out<br />
there among a lot of our young peo? le th~ at w-e don't. And just to<br />
produce statistics to show that it's somewhat better now than it<br />
was two years ago is rnot enough because the problem is of very<br />
considerable dimensions. So the. sorts of things that we are<br />
wanting to do are these. You will appreciate that the Kirby Report<br />
shook a whole range of labour market programs, gave technical<br />
colleges the concept of traineeships. Now as I have announced<br />
before we will be picking it up in very substantial numbers. I<br />
won't go into detail now but let me make the point that the<br />
purpose of the traineeship concept is to recognise that in the<br />
past students coming out of school had the opportunity of going<br />
through the apprenticeship stream and that provided positions for<br />
33,000 and we pick up in 82-83 with numbers of up to about 45,000.<br />
So it's that sort of numbers who would have the apprenticeship<br />
route available to them. Then you have the tertiary education at<br />
the universities or in the TAFE institutions. But a hell of a lot<br />
of our kids have been where they haven't got a job at all, where<br />
they have gone into the market and really gone into dead end type<br />
of jobs where they have no sort of training at all which will open<br />
up the possibility of devel~ oping a talent which undoubtedly so<br />
many of them have. Now the concept of the traineeship is to<br />
provide a situation where it will go into jobs which won't be dead<br />
end. They will get training on-the-job and then there will be that<br />
pull at the end that they will get a broader training of the Job<br />
in development institutions. The TAFE will be one but not only<br />
TAFE. So that they will have the opportunity to dev'ilop their<br />
exp'erience on and off the job in a way which will open up to them<br />
more meaningful and satisfying jobs in the future. Now that will<br />
be an important part of what we are doing. Secondly, of course, we<br />
want to keep up the momentum which is developing in the last<br />
couple of years to an increased retention rate of our young people<br />
in the education system. one of the great tragedies that we<br />
inherited was a very low retention rate in the latter years of<br />
secondary school. By international standards this was dismally low<br />
down at the beginning of the 80' s to about 35%. Now that has moved<br />
up to abo'. It 46% and we are wanting to continue the policies which<br />
we are introducing which will keep that increase in the retention<br />
rate going. Now the next point, it is no good just keeping our<br />
young people in the education system. We have got to make the<br />
education system as relevant as we can for their needs as<br />
individuals'and for the needs of the economy. That is why we have<br />
appointed the Karmel Committee, the quality of education review<br />
committee. And we have asked of and received an excellent report<br />
from Karmel as to how the very substantial funds that are going<br />
into primary and secondary education should be developed in a way<br />
which is going to make the quality of education relevant for young<br />
people themselves and for Australian industry. So in co-operation<br />
with the States, we are working in that area to give the young<br />
people of Australia a greater chance and opportunity to stay in<br />
the education system and to be in an education system which is<br />
relevant. Now another strand of what we will be doing is to try<br />
and get a greater degree of rationality into our youth income<br />
support arrangements. A greater degree of rationality between the </p>
<p>7.<br />
secondary education allowances, the TEAS allowances and the<br />
unemployment benefits. So while looking after' the necessary human.<br />
requirements of those who are still unemployed but you a.-e going<br />
to have to get greater incentive for kids to remain in education<br />
through appropriate relationships between the range of youth<br />
income support. Now that is not' an exhaustive statement of the<br />
things that we are about, but I do believe that it will mean the<br />
most important thing that has been done in addressing this problem<br />
since the time when the disappearance of full employment started<br />
to create this disaster for young people and I believe that with<br />
the appropriate length of co-operation from the young people<br />
themselves, from the education institutions, the employers, the<br />
trade union movement we can at last start to do something about<br />
eradicating this blight upon our society.<br />
QUESTION: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I will just answer this question very very briefly. Firstly<br />
as an ex-member of the Board of the Reserve Bank We are<br />
examining a range of options on what useful information about the<br />
standard policy can be communicated to the markets. We are looking<br />
at that. I pointed out in answer to a question yourself the<br />
difficulties of why we won't revert to the previous<br />
practice. I take note of what you have said. I will discuss it<br />
with the Treasurer and in our discussion that we are currently<br />
engaged upon as to the range of options that are available...... </p>
