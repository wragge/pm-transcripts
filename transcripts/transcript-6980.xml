    <content><![CDATA[<p>28 JulyÂ 1986</p>
<p>I have informed the Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, that I have decided, with regret, not to attend the South Pacific Forum meeting in Suva from 8-11 August.</p>
<p>The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen, will represent Australia at the meeting.</p>
<p>I have taken the decision to shorten my forthcoming visit, originally scheduled to include London for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Review Meeting on South Africa as well as Suva in order to oversee the final stages of preparation of the 1966/ 87 Budget.</p>
<p>The Budget preparations have been made more complex by economic developments in recent days, in particular the proposal to extend the US Export Enhancement Program to China and the USSR, both major customers of Australia, and movements in the exchange rate.</p>
