PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
WEDNESDAY 12 JUNE 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to keep you<br />
waiting but I have been out at Government House with the rest-of<br />
the ministers for the swearing-in of the new minister and the<br />
swearing in of ministers who have new portfolios or changed<br />
portfolios. The significance of the ministerial changes is<br />
briefly that two departments have been abolished and one department<br />
has been quite transformed, immensely exalted. I don't know<br />
whether you noticed that a great amount of the work which has<br />
hitherto been done by the Department of Supply, which has now been<br />
abolished, will be done by the proposed Australian Government<br />
Purchasing Commission which Sir Walter Scott's committee recommended.<br />
Yesterday we asked the Parliamentary Draftsman to prepare the<br />
general framework for that bill to establish the Australian<br />
Government Purchasing Commission and also the Australian Postal<br />
Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission, both<br />
of which were recommended by Sir James Vernon's* Royal Commission;<br />
and then a new statistics bill which has been recommended by<br />
Professor Crisp's committee.<br />
Es the Western Australian representative here?<br />
I thought I might give a message to you. Yesterday, on page 3,<br />
there was an article " Delay seen on Eyre sealing" and it<br />
comprised a report of remarks by the Premier of Western Australia,<br />
Sir Charles Court, concerning the Eyre highway....<br />
Interjection: We published your reply this morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe it was published on page 5. You are doing<br />
pretty good tor me in the West Australian; the troublt is not at<br />
this end. But there are two particular comments which I might make<br />
to this wider audience. One concerns this statement:<br />
" The attitude of the Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam,<br />
to the Eyre Highway could further delay the sealing of the road"<br />
also: " Sir Charles said: ' It was obvious Mr Whitlam<br />
believed that Australia finished at Adelaide'."<br />
In fact, my Government is the only one which has<br />
produce a plan to see that the Eyre Highway is trafficable end-to-end.<br />
Up till now it has been a very clear case of wasted government funds.<br />
The old Commonwealth Aid Grants have been spent by Western Australia<br />
in sealing the Western Australian part of the Eyre Highway but there<br />
has not been any comparable expenditure on the South Australian part.<br />
I don't criticise the South Australian Government for that because<br />
the Eyre Highway, is clearly very much less important to South<br />
Australia than it is to Western Australia. It is, however, a road<br />
which the Australian Government can build and maintain under the<br />
Constitution. The very first paragraph, of Section 51 of the<br />
Constitution, which lists the Australian Parliament's responsibiliti~ s<br />
says: "... trade and commerce with other countries and among the<br />
States". It's in that context that my Government proposed to the<br />
Premiers last Friday and also it was in accordance with what I put<br />
in the Government's policy speech a month ago that we would build<br />
and maintain the principal roads between the capitals. We are *~ 2 </p>
<p>entitled to do so; they are inter-state roads, they are part of<br />
trade and commerce among the States. And accordingly, the definite<br />
propQsal was made for this and other national roads in South Australia<br />
ahd ptoposals were made to all the Premiers for national roads the<br />
other national roads being those to-and from ports and airports<br />
and between the Territories and the surrounding States.<br />
I notice that Sir Charles Cutler, the Acting<br />
Premier of New South Wales both the Sir Charles's seem to have<br />
been a bit excited after Friday commented on the Hume Highway:<br />
" This is' another example of the futility of continuing the<br />
arrangements which have hitherto prevailed for our principal roads."<br />
The Humne Highway is seventy miles too long, and it is too circuitous,<br />
too steep, too narrow in many parts? there again, we have promised<br />
in particular between Goulburn and Holbrook to see that the road<br />
is adequate. There is no prospect, as things used to apply, of<br />
having a decent road between Sydney and Melbourne. I believe the<br />
whole of Sir Charles Cutler's remarks were not published, but I<br />
will be interested to receive a reply to a letter I sent on this<br />
subject before the end of April to the Premier of New South Walesthat<br />
was before he went away actually, 28 April. We have suggested<br />
that there should be co-operation in locating the new road.<br />
Any questions?<br />
QUESTION: I quote from the first paper you are believed to read<br />
each morning, " The Age". Sir, on 15 May you are reported to as having<br />
said: " There will be no increase in either direct or indirect taxes<br />
in this year's Federal budget". Sir, with all the economic<br />
problems facing the Government, will you be-able to honour that<br />
election promise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will make no comments on budgetary matters. I am<br />
quite happy to discuss matters which flow from the Premiers Conference,<br />
of course, but I will not answer questions, as you know, about<br />
budgetary matters.<br />
QUESTION: You were prepared to during the campaign, sir. What's<br />
changed? PRIME MINISTER: The budget is imminent.<br />
QUESTION: Do you regret that there are not more new members in the<br />
ministry? PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to answer that question. The general<br />
situation is that the Caucus has endorsed the attitude which the people<br />
expressed, that the ministry should be given a fair go. And<br />
accordingly, every minister was returned who was still in the Parliament.<br />
I don't know what the odds would beaqainst that. I don't think any<br />
of you who were pontificating on this matter would have ventured to<br />
believe that every minister would be returned.<br />
QUESTION: May I remind you that several times in Parliament last year<br />
the Treasurer, Mr Crean, urged investors not to sell their shares,<br />
saying that the economy was sound and they would not lose out by<br />
keeping their shares? Over the last week or so, share prices have<br />
dropped to their lowest level for 7 years, although there has been<br />
some recovery. In one day nearly $ 800 million was lopped off the<br />
market value. How concerned are you about the falling share market<br />
and what steps will your re-elected Government take to restore<br />
confidence in the market?. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Australian economy is basically very sound,<br />
and any company which is engaged in useful occupation should have<br />
complete confidence as to its future.<br />
, QUES4ION: In view of your remarks to the Premiers about risk-taking,<br />
restoring risk-taking to entrepreneurial activities, do you see a<br />
moral distinction between putting people into unemployment for<br />
reasons of economic management and putting people out of business<br />
for reasons of economic management?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My reference was to land speculation. My reference<br />
was not as wide as entrepreneurial activities overall. There are<br />
very many entrepreneurial activities which are very valuable to<br />
the community and they should prosper. There has been an unhealthy<br />
degree of land speculation. The States have permitted it and it<br />
appears that some of the speculators will burn their fingers.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, is there any further development on the project, which<br />
was delayed or rejected by the Federal Government before, for an oil<br />
refinery by the Alwest group and bauxite mining? Can you give us<br />
an up-to-date statement of what your Government's position is on that<br />
project? And have you heard from Sir Charles the Second about<br />
that project?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Sir Charles has sent nothing in Writing to me about<br />
it. I had a very general discussion with Sir Charles Court last<br />
Thursday afternoon in Canberra on the eve of the Premiers Conference<br />
about the general attitude of the Australian Government to the two<br />
issues which arose in the Alwest connection namely overseas ownership<br />
or control and the environment. So there was a general discussion on<br />
those two matters. In the Premiers' Conference there was also discussion<br />
on an agenda item which the Australian government had listed<br />
concerning the environment. The proposal was that there should be<br />
joint environmental impact statements by the Australian Government<br />
would have to make a decision itself, such as projects which involved,<br />
the expenditure of loan f unds ( where the Australian Government's<br />
responsibility flows from its membership of the Loan Council) and<br />
export projects in the private sector ( where the Australian Government's<br />
responsibility arises from its constitutional jurisdiction over exports).<br />
There was also reference in the Premiers Conference under another<br />
agenda item to the Australian Government's responsibility as r~. gards<br />
aboriginal lands. Some of those, of course, could be affected by<br />
exports such as minerals in the Northern Territory or in th neighbouring<br />
two States. But there's only been a general discussion between--1<br />
Sir Charles Court and me on this subject. There's been nothing specific<br />
about Alwest and there will, I expect, be further correspondence fromthe<br />
people involved in the project, -nne has come yet.-<br />
QUESTION: Those environmental standards that were-set when the<br />
project camne up last time do they still apply from-the Commonwealth's<br />
point of view, the need for the study to be made at the expense of<br />
the participating company?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, that's our general approach. -We have been<br />
given no reasons to vary that approach. The West Australian Government<br />
hasn't examined, or hadn't examin-ed, some of the environmental factors<br />
which we believe relevant, and-ti-Australian G'overnment didn't have<br />
sufficient time to determine all the environmental factors on Alwest<br />
to its satisfaction. Its preliminary view was that there were.. some<br />
unsatisfactory features environmentally in Alwest. But I know'of<br />
no further correspondence. </p>

QUESTION: Sir, if the New South Wales Government won't co-operate<br />
on the Hume Highway, will the Commonwealth go ahead and build it<br />
itself? PRIMt MINISTER: I won't assume that the New South Wales Government<br />
won't co-operation. All I am saying is that it has been very dilatory.<br />
But the highway will be built, I trust with the New South Wales<br />
Government's co-operation, because it would have a very great deal<br />
of the information concerning topography and geology; and also<br />
there was a joint Commonwealth/ State inquiry on some of the route<br />
in the last seven years or so in studying what should be the nature<br />
of the access that Tumut in New South Wales has to its biggest<br />
market, Canberra.<br />
QUESTION: How do you regard China's attempts to prevent the<br />
screening of the Antonioni film in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm surprised that there should have been any<br />
attempts to prevent the screening of any film. I haven't seen the<br />
film, but at all events it is being screened, I'm told. The only<br />
thing that comes within Australian Government juristiction by any<br />
stretch of the imagination would be the A. B. C. Well the A. B. C.<br />
under this government is free to do what it likes.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, do you accept Dr Cairns' suggestion that the Caucus<br />
should have more say in economic matters, and how far would you be<br />
prepared to go in this direction?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, this is not a view of Dr Cairns alone; it<br />
is a view which we all hold.<br />
QUESTION: Have you given Dr Cairns any indication that sometime in<br />
the future he might have responsibility for the IAC? If so, is this<br />
a firm undertaking or not, and when will it happen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You don't expect me to publish conversations that<br />
I have with any other individual, even so close an associate as.<br />
Dr Cairns. As regards the IAC, it has been my responsibility from<br />
its inception it will remain so for quite some time; I would expect<br />
until Mr Rattigan's successor is appointed. I want to be sure that<br />
the IAC is well established in the very greatly expanded role that<br />
it now has. It's a much more important body than the Tariff Board.<br />
I want to see that it's given every encouragement to the wider range<br />
of activities it has compared with the Tariff Board.<br />
QUESTION: In your statement last night explaining the ministerial<br />
changes, you referred to the need to absorb migrants in suitable<br />
jobs, but you didn't refer to the principle of migration according<br />
to family reunions. Does the absorption of Immigration into Labour<br />
mean any change of emphasis?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no, what you're referring to concerns assisted<br />
migration. I noticed my statement was paraphrased by some of the<br />
newspapers. They referred to migrants coming in. That's how it was<br />
represented. What I did say was that migrants are brought in where<br />
there are jobs. To get it fully: " Mr Cameron . will hold the new<br />
portfolio of Labor and Immigration. To his existing functio ' ns as<br />
* Minister for Labour will be added control of assisted migration.,<br />
In this way, it will be possible to ensure that migrants are broiught<br />
to Australia only when suitable jobs are available and in a way that<br />
will ensure welcome and understanding from unions and management%.<br />
IOther Immigration functions will also be undertaken for the time </p>
<p>being by Mr Cameron but will later be transferred to such<br />
Departments as Foreign Affairs, Education and Social Security."<br />
There are already some migrant functions which are with other<br />
departments, such as Commonwealth Hostels an excellent board<br />
6f d~ ectors and the Department of Housing and Construction.<br />
Foreign Affairs will deal with admission visas. Education, of<br />
course and Social Security will make provision for particular<br />
aspects of migrants as well as other parts of our population who<br />
seek additional attention to those generally available. But the<br />
principle remains, as it has throughout our term of office, that<br />
we believe the best migrants, the migrants who are happiest and<br />
most successful in Australia, are those who are encouraged to<br />
come here, not by Government but by their friends and families.<br />
Family reunion is the biggest component in the Australian<br />
Government's migration policy.<br />
QUESTION: In your statement this morning on foreign investment,<br />
you mentioned the creation of a new inter-departmental committee<br />
to look at foreign investment. Will this mean there are now two<br />
screening committees on foreign investment? And will the new one<br />
look at asset acquisition by foreign interests and land acquisition?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They are separate committees. One is the takeovers<br />
committee which has been operating since Mr McMahon was Prime Ministerthat<br />
seems a long way back and the other, this new one which<br />
will deal with investment. The existing committee, the takeovers<br />
committee doesn't of course deal with new investment; it only deals<br />
with investment in existing companies. It also has some deficiencies,<br />
as I pointed out during the election campaign, in that it doesni't<br />
deal, for instance, with the takeover of assets as distinct from<br />
the taking over of shares; and it doesn'* t -deal with the taking<br />
over of minority Australian shareholdings even if they are quite<br />
important to the country.<br />
QUESTION: In a radio interview in Melbourne during the election<br />
campaign, you seemed to express some doubts about the continuance<br />
of Qantas flights into South Africa. Could you expand upon<br />
that please?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I forget what I was asked and I forget what my<br />
response was to any question on it. I'm not sure I remember a<br />
reference to this. I didn't volunteer any remarks about it but I<br />
suppose the general attitude that we would have in mind is that<br />
Johannesburg is not the only, nor, maybe, the most appropriate<br />
point for Australia's national airline in Africa.<br />
QUESTION: What are your personal feelings about losing Mr Barnard<br />
as your deputy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You all know, you would expect, that I voted for<br />
Mr Barnard. You would not have expected anything else in view of<br />
our long association. Mr Barnard took the result as you all would<br />
expect him to take it very well, promptly, well, nobly.<br />
QUESTION: Will you protest again to the French Government over the<br />
resumption of nuclear tests in the Pacific area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Senator Willesee will be making any comments. He<br />
already has.<br />
QUESTION: Any comment sir on the Indian one?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Senator Willesee has made a comment on thatf also. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
QUESTION: Do you feel precluded by your statements during the<br />
ele tion campaign from considering introducing option preferential<br />
voting? PRIME MINISTER: No. I think optional preferential voting is all<br />
the more necessary. What I have said in the past, and it's still<br />
my view, is that first-past-the-post is not an appropriate voting<br />
system for Australia because we've become used to the preferential<br />
system for a couple of qenerations. Its quite clear, however, that<br />
the system has to be simplified and it would be appropriate, it<br />
would seem, to permit people to vote for one candidate only if that<br />
is their wish. At the moment you've got to vote for all candidates<br />
on the ballot paper even if it's 73, as it was in the New South Wales<br />
Senate ballot paper, or twelve, as it was in my own electorate of<br />
Werriwa for the House of Representatives. If you don't number every<br />
square in a proper sequence then your vote is invalid. It's wasted.<br />
The Department's education campaign was very successful indeed.<br />
The number of informals in New South Wales for the Senate was only<br />
12%. That's a remarkable tribute to the application and interest<br />
of the Australian voters. But it's quite absurd that one has to<br />
number every square in those circumstances. It's the most complicated<br />
voting system in the world. And I believe our whole parliamentary<br />
system has been held up to ridicule by the fact that we will be<br />
without a Parliament in a parliamentary democracy, as we like to<br />
regard it, for three months or even longer. So my colleague,<br />
Mr Daly, the Minister for Services and Property, has in mind, I believe,<br />
to bring in legislation to simplify the electoral system to give<br />
people more choice than they have now. If you still want to number<br />
every square you would be free to do so.' And your preference would<br />
be given full regard. It would be taken into account. But you<br />
wouldn't have to number everybody on the ballot paper if you were<br />
satisfied with indicating your support for one candidate only.<br />
It's your own lookout then if that candidate comes, say, third and<br />
you ' ye missed the opportunity of having a second choice between<br />
those that are ahead of him or her. That is, it will simplify it<br />
and it will give people a choice. At the moment the Australian<br />
voters don't have a choice. You've got to number everyone even if,<br />
as would apply to all of us, we wouldn't know a fraction of them.<br />
QUESTION: The Government intends to legislate on that in this session<br />
of Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe this is Mr Daly's intention. It's not<br />
come before Cabinet yet, but give us time. We're a pretty active<br />
ministry but we haven't been able to decide that one yet.<br />
QUESTION: On the migration question, as far as unassisted migration<br />
is concerned, who will actually control the components of unassisted<br />
migration? There are family reunions and sponsorship and government<br />
recruitment? Now who is going to control unassisted migration?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Cameron will have the same responsibilities for<br />
the time being as Mr Grassby had. The degree of relationship which<br />
gives you a priority for submission is the same:<br />
QUESTION: So the categories will remain as such?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no change in any of those matters.<br />
Quite obviously a closer relative will come here earlier than a<br />
distant one. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
QUESTION: How long before the transfer of the various sections<br />
Iof immigration to the other departments?<br />
PRI4J MINISTER: I don't know. There may have to be legislation.<br />
I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: . In your opening address to the Premiers' Conference,<br />
Mr Whitlam, you stressed that the examples that you presented that<br />
day were only an example of the Government's attitude for the Budget.<br />
You said they would serve to demonstrate the stringency of the<br />
approach that the Government would be taking at that time. Does<br />
that stringency of approach apply to the government's collections<br />
as well as to its spending?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not going to give any more instances. I was<br />
able to give those instances in advance of the Budget because they<br />
had some relation to what the States are expected to do too. I<br />
Swanted to demonstrate to the States that we were not asking them<br />
to do anything in respect to their business enterprises that we<br />
were not intending to do ourselves. There are some Government<br />
expenditures which are more important than others. There are some<br />
which are more readily deferred than others. There are business<br />
enterprises which should be paid for by the user instead of by the<br />
taxpayers. The proposition was put to us, in effect, that we<br />
should pick up the losses on the New South Wales Railways $ 120 million.<br />
We are prepared to accept the railways if they will hand them over<br />
to us. I can imagine that with proper planning the Australian<br />
Railways could be a modestly successful enterprise. Certainly in<br />
the south-eastern part of this continent, the railways, with proper<br />
co-ordination say, the whole area betw6eii Adelaide and Brisbane<br />
and to the south-east of that line would be a very successful<br />
transport system. There is no other continental land mass of<br />
comparable area where you have so many different and less co-ordinated<br />
systems. I believe that we just have to be quite blunt about it. It<br />
is not the Australian Government's proper responsibility to the<br />
taxpayer to say that we have to pay for the losses any State<br />
railway system runs up. We aren't accountable for running the systems<br />
as things stand at the moment, but it is put to us that we should pick<br />
up the tab for the losses. Similarly, Sir Charles Cutler mentioned<br />
his hospitals, the charges there. Well, I reminded him that just as<br />
we were prepared to accept the railways we are also prepared to go<br />
halves in the cost of running the hospitals if the patients in<br />
standard wards are exempted from fees. That used to be the case<br />
when there was last a Labor Government in the Australian Parliament.<br />
It was a sensible arrangement; it ought to be restored.<br />
QUESTION: At the Premiers' Conference you seemed to me to talk with<br />
a quite new seriousness about countering inflation and you talked<br />
about an economic freeze which would both break expectations,<br />
inflationary expectations, and drastically reduce the pressure on<br />
resources. Do you think the Australian community has to accept a<br />
higher rate of registered unemployed as a cost of getting inflation<br />
under control?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it certainly does not. And I didn't say that<br />
either. For instance, any diminution of commercial construction<br />
will certainly be picked up by an expansion of welfare housing. It's<br />
an absurd position that in the financial year ending this month a<br />
muc h greater amount has been made available to the States for welfare<br />
housing, housing commission, housing trust construction. than ever<br />
before in our history, and yet fewer houses were built than for, I </p>
<p>-8-<br />
think, fifteen years past. And my speech pointed out that there<br />
will be more money available for welfare housing this year and if<br />
mor&amp; is required it will be found. I didn't say there would be more<br />
uinemjlloyment. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to repeat<br />
what should have been plain to anybody who was there or who read<br />
the text: that there was no suggestion for increased unemployment.<br />
QUESTION: In your speech to the Canberra branch of the Labor Party<br />
on Saturday you spoke about the Premiers' Conference, that it was<br />
no longer dignified or effective and no mileage for Prime ministers<br />
or Treasurers in dealing in one or two days with the Premtiers to<br />
cut up the national cake. Can you give us some idea how next year<br />
you would imagine the Premiers Conference will be conducted. on<br />
Saturday you spoke of the discussions taking place over weeks or<br />
even possibly months?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are three components * of our financial<br />
arrangements with the States. One is the capital works, the loan<br />
funds. We agreed to an increase of just over 10 per cent in the<br />
loan funds for State Governments, for the larger serni-government<br />
authorities and no limit at all was placed on the borrowings by the<br />
smaller authorities, those that want to borrow up to half a million<br />
dollars. So that was the loan funds. There was an increase of<br />
per cent in effect. Some of the States said they needed more,<br />
and one State, for instance, quoted the case that to build an<br />
identical school today with. a school for which a tender was let<br />
seven months before the price had gone up 40 per cent. We saw<br />
no excuse for accepting a tender 40 per cent higher than one seven<br />
months before. There ought to be better management than that. The<br />
next component with our financial relations'with the States concerns<br />
the revenue assistance, and that's under a formula. The Act states<br />
what the increase should be there. The increase in the ' coming<br />
financial year under the formula will be about 18 per cent a very<br />
considerable increase. Inflation has produced a still larger<br />
percentage increase in the amount of that revenue assistance. I<br />
made it plain this year I thought I made it plain 12 months<br />
before that the formula would be applied, that I would not be a<br />
party to haggling with no preparation about increases in the formula.<br />
If the formula is deficient, then it ought to be amended; and the<br />
present formula is the subject of legislation expiring at the end<br />
of next year. If any variations are sought in the formula they can<br />
be considered and may be made before the end of next June. But the<br />
formula was applied and it involved an increase of 18 percent.<br />
There have been of fsets for tertiary education for which the Australian<br />
Government finds the whole of the cost now. The remaining component<br />
is the special purpose grants the tied grants as-the States like<br />
to refer to them. There have never been such large sums made<br />
available in special purpose grants as have been made available by<br />
my Government, and the prospective increase in those this year will<br />
receive 28 percent more than in the year just ending 28 per cent<br />
more. We find it is much more satisfactory to have specific purpose<br />
grants because only in that way will one overcome the mis-government<br />
which we inherited from our predecessors, which they were prepared to<br />
condone and which we are not.<br />
I've given you the examples of the interstate roads.<br />
Now here we are entitled under the Constitution to build and maintain<br />
those roads ourselves. It's a complete waste to have the Eyre<br />
Highway half surfaced and half unsurfaced. One State does it; the<br />
other State doesn't. Neither can compel the other to do-it or to<br />
leave it undone. The Australian Government could have done the lot. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
It now will. Similarly the Hume Highway. We all know the way<br />
they were messing about ever since the war. There was no chance<br />
of gotting it before the end of this century. The Australian<br />
Gbver~ inent can do it, and it will embark upon it in this coming<br />
Parliament. There are very many instances like this. If my<br />
Government hadn't made specific purpose grants or offered them there<br />
would have been no prospect of having reasonable public transport<br />
systems in the State capitals. There would have been no prospect<br />
of getting the State capitals completely sewered. There would<br />
have been no possibility of getting adequate services in the post--wal<br />
suburbs or reviving the suburbs which were developed 100 years ago.<br />
Now in all these things improvements could only be done if there are<br />
specific purpose grants. The States have always been able, for<br />
instance, to go ahead with a bridge across the Brisbane River to<br />
link South Brisbane and Roma Street. Nobody did a thing about it<br />
until we made the offer, and since the election they've decided<br />
to accept the offer. And in Melbourne nobody ever did anything about<br />
having the same number of tracks all the way between Melbourne and<br />
Footscray they used to vary; there's no purpose in having more<br />
than the minimum number or to put the third track in from Caulfield<br />
to Mordialloc. It's now being done, and quadrupling the railway<br />
the whole way from Penrith to Sydney. We are making specific purpoLgrants<br />
and as we have told the Premiers there would probably be<br />
28 per cent more funds this year than last year. But because of<br />
our interest in the spending of it, it will be better spent.<br />
QUESTION: Is it your intention, or have you offered, a job to<br />
Mr Grassby?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have not been in touch-with Mr Grassby in any way<br />
on this subject.<br />
QUESTION: At the Premiers' Conference you listed on the agenda<br />
the question of control over prices. We understand in your private<br />
talks the Premiers raised the question of control over incomes, it<br />
seemed to get to nowhere. Can the public now accept that the question<br />
of control over prices by the Federal Government is dead?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Until New South Wales and Victoria act in this matter,<br />
I think it must be accepted as dead. About incomes, the fact is, o,:<br />
course, I think the Premiers realise this, that they can't refler<br />
any matter to the Federal Parliament which they themisclv-ca-' n.)<br />
exercise at the moment. And no State Parliament can exc~ rcist,:<br />
over incomes which come within the purview of the AuFtralian<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. They can only ref-r 1<br />
question of incomes outside Commonwealth awards. Now of ti-r<br />
were prepared to do that, but I think they accept that i** c,. inon~ wc L . A<br />
awards can override, within the constitutional limits of th-t<br />
Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commuissioni, any Statk3L<br />
So it could only be a partial reference which they could make.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I represent New York and Isra~ eli YLd-i:; 11<br />
magazines which represent an opposing philosophy in Jewish lii&gt;<br />
the philosophy of Zionism.... ( unclear) long histor-y Jews have alwa'<br />
lived between non-Jews although they have suffered persecution, thny<br />
have continued the development of the nation.... ( unclear) to build<br />
a new human society based on justice and equality. Could I say that<br />
you achieved with that attitude? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I think it's rather too wide a subject for me<br />
to Vnkture an opinion at this notice or within the scope of this;<br />
conference. What I would like to say is that my Government is<br />
delighted that the prospects for the survival of the State of Israel<br />
and for peaceful relations between all the nations of the Middle<br />
East and, one would hope, the future of refugees in the Middle<br />
East are now much brighter than the last time we had a conference<br />
such as this. Dr Kissinger worked wonders between Egypt and<br />
Israel and now seems to have done so between Syria and Israel,<br />
and I would like to point out that the Australian Government has had<br />
some effect, obviously only marginal, in bringing about this improved<br />
relationship. We have been blackguarded amply for having kept our<br />
heads and tried to contribute, but things are very much more hopeful<br />
than we had ventured to believe they could be last time we had one<br />
of these conferences. </p>
