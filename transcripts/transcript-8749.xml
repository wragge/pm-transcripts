TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATINGMNP,<br />
DOORSTOP, AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, 3 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, does Mr Kennett have the right to * sack any more public servants<br />
down there in Victoria as a result of your increasing the power of the IRC?<br />
PM: I heard John Howard today talk about the Kennett mandate. I think the important<br />
thing to remember here is this Federal Labor Government went to an election with<br />
_ Accord Mark VI constructed in the actual weeks of the election program, which<br />
talked about minimum rates for Australians, and all the other commitments we'd<br />
made in the past, the supplementary payments for low paid workers, with all of<br />
that economic and social focus on those issues. By contrast, Mr Kennett had no<br />
such declarations in his campaign, in fact he lead people up the garden path, not<br />
only not seeking a mandate but trying to assuage their fears about what he might<br />
introduce. There's only one mandate in industrial relations that's clear to the community, it's<br />
the mandate enjoyed by this Government. And that's the mandate which will have<br />
its way in Australia while ever I'm Prime Minister. So the States can do what they<br />
like, those who want to break those sort of things. And of course not all do, you<br />
won't see it in the Labor States. If Mr Kennett wants to go his wilful way with the<br />
Liberal's ideological agenda, well let him, and no doubt he will still cause<br />
industrial disruption in his own areas of administration by virtue of his own<br />
attitude. But we are giving Victorian employees an opportunity now to register themselves<br />
under the federal jurisdiction, thereby letting the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
protect their conditions. Also for those people who might want to avail<br />
themselves of coverage under federal jurisdiction, we're doing that under external<br />
affairs power. </p>
<p>So it is the reasonable extension of the commitments we gave at an election, with<br />
Accord Mark VI and all the tenets thereof, and we are think the only government<br />
in Australia which has specifically gone to an election with very clear<br />
commitments about industrial relations. Certainly the Kennett Government didn't<br />
and they can't rely upon that now.<br />
J: Do you take his threat seriously that he is going to renege on the financial deal<br />
with the Commonwealth?<br />
PM: Renege in what way?<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: It's one thing for Mr Kennett to be talking about putting the industrial relations of<br />
his State in jeopardy, it's another of him talking of exacerbating his financial<br />
worries. He has got to make his own decisions about financial policy. We've<br />
required him to do nothing other than to agree to a debt reconstruction plan. He<br />
did agree to that and he agreed to that for us agreeing to the borrowings which<br />
were disagreed with the former Government. As far as I'm concerned, that matter<br />
is closed.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how much extra funding will be given to _ SBS Radio to enable<br />
them to set up this new network?<br />
PM: That which is sufficient to do it. can't give the dollars and cents, but it's a very<br />
important decision, I think, for multicultural Australia a second radio network<br />
for the ethnic communities of this country so that they will have access to<br />
programs in their own languages, which to a large extent is now, if not being<br />
denied them, very much truncated by the growth in ethnic languages on the<br />
existing network.<br />
J: What are the practical factors that preclude a referendum at the next election?<br />
PM: There are a number and I don't think now is the time to go into it.<br />
J: You are being accused of vote-catching with this move for this second frequency,<br />
aren't you?<br />
PM: If we want to be accused of vote-catching we could have unveiled it during the<br />
Wills bi-election. No, this is the right time to do it. As the number of ethnic<br />
languages on the SBS Radio Network has expanded, there was a need for another<br />
network, and think this meets the need.<br />
