<p>Mr Ian Causley, Mr Mayor, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It's great to be here in Lismore. It's great to be here as</p>
<p> part of a week long visit to rural and regional areas of Australia. A</p>
<p> visit that is designed to reinforce many of the understandings I have</p>
<p> of the different challenges in regional Australia but also an opportunity</p>
<p> for me to explain face-to-face without the intervention of others and</p>
<p> to answer directly the concerns of people who live in the regions of Australia.</p>
<p>Right at the moment this country at a general national level is experiencing</p>
<p> strong economic growth. We may have had from the Reserve Bank an interest</p>
<p> rate increase yesterday but let me point out even after that increase</p>
<p> that the average housing loan in this country will be $266 a month lower</p>
<p> than what it was in March of 1996 when the Government I lead came to office.</p>
<p>We do have nationally much lower unemployment than we had four years</p>
<p> ago. We have generated about 580,000 more jobs in Australia over the last</p>
<p> four years. We have seen our budget deficit disappear. We have seen a</p>
<p> very strong growth in investment even in the areas of greatest unemployment</p>
<p> difficulty and I acknowledge that the north coast of New South Wales has</p>
<p> some of the nation's highest areas of unemployment. I acknowledge</p>
<p> that. And that, of course, as you all know has been the case for a long</p>
<p> time. It's not a state of affairs, we'll come to questions in</p>
<p> a minute and I'll be very happy to devote far more time to questions</p>
<p> than I will to my speech, but it's important that I have an opportunity</p>
<p> of putting the Government's position and then I'll be happy</p>
<p> to try and answer your questions.</p>
<p>So I acknowledge that there are areas of unemployment which are higher</p>
<p> than the rest and that has been the case for a long time. Higher unemployment</p>
<p> in the north coast of New South Wales didn't arrive in March of 1996.</p>
<p> In fact the absolute level of unemployment here now is lower than what</p>
<p> is was then but it's much too high and we would like to see it lower.</p>
<p> And over the past few days I have received a lot of messages from people</p>
<p> in rural Australia. Some of those messages are of great hope and optimism</p>
<p> and show a determination on the part of many communities to try and turn</p>
<p> things around of their own volition.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the messages are of despair and concern particularly</p>
<p> in relation to the maintenance of basic government services. And it's</p>
<p> my responsibility as Prime Minister to see that the legitimate demands</p>
<p> of rural communities regarding Commonwealth Government services are met.</p>
<p> And for that reason I have taken on board the concerns that have been</p>
<p> expressed to me here in Lismore and in other areas. And I do want to echo</p>
<p> what Ian Causley said in relation to job placement services.</p>
<p>It is true that Employment National didn't do as well out of the</p>
<p> second job tender contract as it did out of the first one. But it is not</p>
<p> true as has been implied by the local newspaper here and by some of the</p>
<p> Sydney newspapers that that means that there are fewer employment services</p>
<p> in the bush or in Lismore than there were before. My advice is that under</p>
<p> the old dispensation you had one CES. You have four job providers at present</p>
<p> under the first tender and under the new system you are going to have</p>
<p> seven permanent ones and two outreach ones. By any measure that is an</p>
<p> increase in the services available, not a decrease. That means there are</p>
<p> more opportunities and more choice for the unemployed in this part of</p>
<p> Australia to get help to find a job.</p>
<p>Now, I don't pretend that that's going to solve the unemployment</p>
<p> but I do believe that it's important if we are to have an intelligent</p>
<p> debate and if we are to share our concern about such a thing as unemployment</p>
<p> we should get our facts correct. I know the importance of services and</p>
<p> I know that for many smaller communities the maintenance of those services</p>
<p> is very important.</p>
<p>There's a lot of debate at the present time regarding the new taxation</p>
<p> system. I want you to know that we remain absolute in our resolve to implement</p>
<p> the new taxation system from the 1st of July. And we are in</p>
<p> favour of the new taxation system for one reason alone and that is when</p>
<p> it is introduced in full it will be good for Australia. That is why, it</p>
<p> will be good for Australia. It will. It will be good for Australia. It's</p>
<p> very easy, of course, as I said last night and I have said at every gathering</p>
<p> as I have gone around Australia it is very easy to mount an individual</p>
<p> criticism of one or other individual item in the tax system. You can mount</p>
<p> an argument in relation to individual items very easily but you have to</p>
<p> look at the whole policy. You have to look at the fact that it will deliver</p>
<p> reductions of $12 billion in personal income tax. [Interjection] I'll</p>
<p> tell you what it will do, sir, it will result in 80 per cent to the Australian</p>
<p> taxpayer community, and that is the people who earn less than $50,000</p>
<p> a year, being on a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 cents in the</p>
<p> dollar against 47 cents now. That's what it will do.</p>
<p>And I don't think anybody in their wildest imagination could suggest</p>
<p> that people earning less than $50,000 a year are rich and the fact that</p>
<p> 80 per cent  80 per cent  of the Australian community are</p>
<p> going to be on that top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar is an</p>
<p> enormous improvement on the 43 cents odd and indeed 47 for some that exists</p>
<p> now.</p>
<p>But it goes further than that. For the regions a particular benefit will</p>
<p> be the fact that it will produce a reduction via the cut in diesel excise</p>
<p> a major reduction in the price of fuel throughout Australia. It's</p>
<p> going to cut about $3 to $4 billion off the cost of fuel all around Australia</p>
<p> - $3 to $4 billion. And because the GST is not going to apply to exports,</p>
<p> it's not going to apply to exports, that will be of enormous benefit</p>
<p> to rural communities because it will make our exports cheaper.</p>
<p>Overall, it's going to lead to a reduction in business operating</p>
<p> costs. I mean, take petrol alone. Because you will be able to get a rebate</p>
<p> of GST paid on petrol bought for business purposes it's going to</p>
<p> mean that petrol used in a business, wherever it might be used, will be</p>
<p> on average about seven cents a litre cheaper than it is now because you</p>
<p> can't get a rebate if you use petrol for business purposes on the</p>
<p> excise component of your tax.</p>
<p>So that is an illustration. When you analyse the totality, ladies and</p>
<p> gentlemen, you analyse the totality of the reform you will see that it</p>
<p> will in overall terms be of enormous benefit to this country. And that</p>
<p> is why the Government is persevering. That is why we took the tax reform</p>
<p> package to the Australian people at the last election. That is why it</p>
<p> has now become the law of the Commonwealth and that is why we are going</p>
<p> to introduce it on the 1st of July. We recognise that there</p>
<p> will be implementation detail. We recognise that there will be implementation</p>
<p> challenges. We know that people will need advice and information and assistance</p>
<p> with the new system and a large amount of Commonwealth Government resources</p>
<p> is being made available to ensure that people are fully advised, fully</p>
<p> informed and fully assisted regarding the implementation details of the</p>
<p> new taxation system.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say in my introductory remarks and then I'll</p>
<p> be very happy to take your questions is this : that I recognise that although</p>
<p> the country as a whole is strong and is doing well and is outperforming</p>
<p> most other countries and was strong enough economically to avoid being</p>
<p> badly hurt by the Asian economic downturn I recognise that despite that</p>
<p> there are some parts of Australia that are missing out on that. I acknowledge</p>
<p> that. And to the best of our capacity it is our desire to see that those</p>
<p> sections of the Australian community who are missing out get a fairer</p>
<p> deal.</p>
<p>I can't and I won't attempt to guarantee that every part of</p>
<p> the country can equally share in national economic prosperity. That is</p>
<p> from a practical point of view unachievable. And it is unachievable from</p>
<p> a...it is achievable for people who have an equality of opportunity</p>
<p> but in the nature of things there will be variations. But people are entitled</p>
<p> to have a better share of the national economic benefit than in some communities</p>
<p> they are getting.</p>
<p>And part of what I have been doing over the last week and part of what</p>
<p> the Government continues to do is to listen to and respond to the concerns</p>
<p> of rural and regional communities. But in the process of doing that it's</p>
<p> also important to point out that it's not all doom and gloom in rural</p>
<p> Australia. There are many parts of the regions that are doing well. There</p>
<p> are many communities that have turned things around. There are many businesses</p>
<p> that have taken new opportunities and won new markets. I can name many,</p>
<p> I can name the cotton industry in Bourke, I can name small businesses</p>
<p> in many parts of the coastal areas of Australia, I can name the tea industry,</p>
<p> Madura that I visited in the Tweed. I can talk about the strength of many</p>
<p> small businesses along the coast of New South Wales. It's important</p>
<p> not only to acknowledge the adversity and the difficulty but also to recognise</p>
<p> that there are many good news stories as well in rural areas of Australia</p>
<p> and it gives a completely distorted picture to represent all of it as</p>
<p> doom and gloom.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Ian Causley for the invitation to</p>
<p> be in Lismore. I welcome very much the opportunity of a public gathering</p>
<p> like this to hear the views and to add to the questions of the people</p>
<p> of Lismore and I'll be delighted to take your questions, one at a</p>
<p> time if I may.</p>
