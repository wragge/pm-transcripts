Cairns residents will have better access to after-hours GP services following a grant of $100,000 under the General Practice After Hours Program from the Rudd Government to the Omega Medical Centre in Manoora, the Prime Minister, Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon and Member for Leichhardt, Jim Turnour announced today.</p>
<p>"I am delighted that Cairns is one of 100 Australian communities to be offered Government funding for after-hours GP services," Mr Turnour said.</p>
<p>"The Government's General Practice After Hours Program is helping to build and strengthen after-hours care by general practitioners across Australia," he said.</p>
<p>General Practice After Hours grants of up to $100,000 over two years are available on a competitive basis to support after-hours services.</p>
<p>"The grants recognise both the long and demanding hours frequently worked by the nation's doctors and the difficulties patients have in getting access to after-hours GP care," Mr Turnour said.</p>
<p>"The Government's investment will ensure that as many people as possible in Cairns will have access to high-quality GP services when they need them."</p>
<p>"The General Practice After Hours Program will make it easier for the community to find a doctor after hours."</p>
<p>"Good primary care in local communities means people stay healthier, manage chronic disease and illness more effectively, and stay out of hospital."</p>
<p>"The program has the support of local GPs. The grants can be used to help with costs such as on-call allowances, training and running costs," Mr Turnour said.</p>
