TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT<br />
31 OCTOBER 1990<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, welcome again to the program.<br />
PM: Thanks Paul.<br />
LYNEHAM: When we get through the jargon, which you<br />
yourself admitted was here in some abundance, what is<br />
there here new for average Australian families?<br />
PM: The certainty that as a result of this conference we<br />
are going to have these things that will benefit them.<br />
Firstly, a more efficient economic infrastructure in the<br />
area of rail and road which will lead to a more efficient<br />
and competitive economy which must have benefits for<br />
them. Secondly, a commitment on the part of the<br />
Commonwealth and the State and Local Governments to<br />
eradicate as far as possible existing duplication in<br />
regulatory rElform. regulation systems which must, as<br />
it exists nowr, mean a higher cost of goods and services<br />
than need be. So to the extent that we reduce that<br />
regulatory overlap between the States and the States and<br />
the Commonwealth, an improvement for them. It also means<br />
in regard to the delivery of services that now they are<br />
being delivered more expensively than they should be<br />
because theret are significant areas of overlap between<br />
the Commonwealth and the States. We're committed to<br />
eliminating that. So they'll get better services more<br />
cheaply. Those are the immediate things. In the area of<br />
electricity for residents in the eastern states, a<br />
commitment to see whether there can be a greater<br />
integration o~ f electricity generation and transmission.<br />
That must mean over time cheaper electricity than<br />
otherwise would have been the case for individuals and<br />
for businesses.<br />
LYNEHAMv: On one hand you're going to set up this<br />
national rail freight system, on the other hand you're<br />
going to be slugging the truckies quite heavily now,<br />
aren ' t you, for<br />
PM: Just let's see it's not the one or the other. To<br />
say you're going to be slugging the truckies heavily is<br />
really, with respect to you, a very inadequate statement<br />
of both the problem we're addressing and the solution<br />
that's going to emerge. The indisputable fact is, as has<br />
been established by inquiry after inquiry, most recently </p>
<p>by the Interstate Commission, that heavy road users are<br />
undercharged in terms of the impact of their operations<br />
upon the road systems. Now, the interests of all<br />
Australians demand that there be a greater degree of<br />
correlation in terms of charge for road usage and damage<br />
caused because that's important not only in regard to the<br />
road freight system but you mentioned rail. What<br />
governments are now going to do is to put money into<br />
creating a more efficient, by world standards, rail<br />
freight system in this country. Now it's a waste of time<br />
trying to create a position where rail can be competitive<br />
if you're gcing to have a totally subsidised, not<br />
totally but very significantly subsidised road freight<br />
system. So we've got to get both right.<br />
LYNEHAM: I can feel a few truckie blockades in the wind<br />
though can't ' you?<br />
PM: Yes, and I suppose talk like that will encourage<br />
them. But the fact is that if governments, and we are at<br />
one on this, and across political boundaries,<br />
conservative governments, labor governments, we are at<br />
one in saying that we have got to face this issue and<br />
have a system which is efficient. Now if when you know<br />
things have to be done you simply said oh well<br />
opposition, and you didn't do it, what sort of government<br />
would you be!?<br />
LYNEHAM: OrL the question of looking at how or whether<br />
the States should be able to raise more of the money they<br />
spend, is it possible that that will lead at some time in<br />
the future t~ o State taxes, State income taxes for<br />
example? PM: I wouldn't think it will lead to State income taxes.<br />
But as I've said, Paul, in the press conference earlier<br />
today, and this, if you'll remember, reflected the<br />
attitudes of the States as well. We are not trying to<br />
pre-judge issues. What I'm saying is if the States want<br />
to put any issue on the table in regard to either<br />
existing taxes or new taxes, well then they should. But<br />
I would think that the fact that they've had the<br />
opportunity to impose income taxes now right up until<br />
last year when we finally changed the provisions because<br />
none of them wanted to exercise them, would lead you to<br />
the prima facie conclusion they wouldn't be arguing with<br />
that. LYNEHAM: Do you think people care who decides on the<br />
spending, as long as it's spent wisely, whether the<br />
Commonwealth directs the States to spend in a certain way<br />
or not?<br />
PM: I think the right question is are people concerned<br />
as to whether you have effective overall macro-economic<br />
management which does involve responsibility for levels<br />
of revenue and spending. And they are very much<br />
concerned about that. But I would say that provided they </p>
<p>are confident: that the national government which has the<br />
responsibilit: y for macro-economic policy retains the<br />
capacity to conduct that policy then they don't give a<br />
damn, in my judgement, about those sorts of issues<br />
provided that: capacity is there. That really is the<br />
attitude of t: he Commonwealth and of the States.<br />
LYNEHAM: Nick Greiner told the Liberals in Brisbane last<br />
week that he thinks we're moving to a -sort of postideological<br />
phase of politics. People just want results.<br />
They're not interested in all the political-type<br />
arguments. PM: I think to a considerable extent he's right. But<br />
that's not only looking at Australian politics. I mean<br />
if you look at politics the world round we are now seeing<br />
the dissipation of sharp ideology as a vehicle to getting<br />
power and exe-rcising it. That's true in Europe. I think<br />
it's true generally around the world. Issues of concern<br />
to people don't now neatly fit into some left or right<br />
label outstanding example of that is the question of<br />
the environme-nt.<br />
LYNEHAM: Talking of the environment, one of the dangers<br />
that some of the environmentalists fear is that by having<br />
a system of national standards set in consultation with<br />
the States, you end up with the lowest common<br />
denominator, that the Commonwealth is not showing real<br />
leadership.<br />
PM: That's a false fear and it's not fair to the States.<br />
I mean what i~ s recognised in the approaches we've adopted<br />
in the environment here is to recognise that<br />
constitutionally, whether we like it or not, there are<br />
certain areas; of responsibility for the States, and<br />
certain areas; where we've got responsibility. Now, what<br />
follows from that is there is the possibility and in past<br />
the fact of unnecessary duplication and conflict which<br />
makes it difficult for those whose concern is for the<br />
environment t~ o see a path to the right solution creates<br />
problems for those who are wanting to have economic<br />
development where environmental issues are involved. I'm<br />
not quite sure where they are in terms of the<br />
relationship between the environmental requirements of<br />
the State or the Commonwealth. Now what we've agreed is<br />
that we're go~ ing to address those issues in terms of<br />
trying to get; the greatest degree of complementarity or<br />
acceptance of responsibility in one area or the other<br />
that we can. There's been too much division in the past<br />
on that and J. must myself they've been<br />
extraordinarily co-operative on that.<br />
LYNEHAM: In this protest of division though Commonwealth<br />
leadership has saved the Franklin, saved Fraser Island,<br />
the Daintree, you've made decisions like Wesley Vale.<br />
Would those sorts of decisions still be made under the<br />
sort of regime you're anticipating? </p>
<p>PM: I think it's more likely that you're going to get<br />
correct decisions of that type under this new regime.<br />
Because those! decisions occurred within the context of<br />
confrontation. I mean we had States who were saying<br />
anything that: the Commonwealth did was by definition ugly<br />
and evil and was to be repudiated. The attitude now, the<br />
ambience is much different, much more constructive.<br />
LYNEHAM: On the question of regulations going back to<br />
Nick Greiner again he made the point here last week<br />
that the sausage in Queensland can't necessarily be<br />
classed as a sausage in NSW. You ought to get rid of<br />
that sort stupidity presumably?<br />
PM: Yes, that's one of the things. I mean you go back<br />
to I'm not you know a novice in thinking or talking<br />
about these things. You go back to when I lectured about<br />
these things in 1979. I used so many examples there. I<br />
mean you had ridiculous situations like in the area of<br />
road transport because of this regulation from one State<br />
to another. Trucking operators are finding it more<br />
economic to travel longer distances to avoid any cost in<br />
one State to another. I mean it's just quite absurd.<br />
Now that's what we're about, recognising that we are one<br />
nation and trying to get harmonisation of regulation.<br />
But in the ar. ea of regulatory reform we'vye made an<br />
enormous advance What we've done is to adopt the<br />
concept of mutuality, mutual recognition. That is, we're<br />
saying well r-ather than in the past we had a whole lot of<br />
different standards and someone had to satisfy that<br />
standard or that standard or that standard again. if<br />
there's a standard in one State then that will be<br />
accepted in another. Although there are some areas in<br />
which, particularly in the question of national food<br />
standards there should be uniformity and we've agreed to<br />
do that.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Treasurer said earlier today never stand<br />
between a State Premier and a bucket of money.<br />
PM: I said -to him when we were coming down in the lift,<br />
I said I've boeen hearing that for seven years. It always<br />
gets a good Laugh and he got a good one today.<br />
LYNEHAM: The good will and sincerity we've seen over the<br />
last day or : so here, will the shine go off the ball a bit<br />
though when -you get back to the old procedures of trying<br />
to carve up -that bucket of money and get back to the<br />
PM: No, I thiink the attitude will change, as reflected<br />
here. There's an element of permanency about them. But<br />
also this fact that has been taken into account, at the<br />
last conference we gave a three year real terms guarantee<br />
in regard to the level of financial grants which<br />
introduces an element of predictability that wasn't there<br />
before. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Did you ever consider inviting Dr Hewson to<br />
this get together?<br />
PM: No. No, of course not. And I don't know whether he<br />
had any serious contemplation I mean, it was an<br />
insanity. LYNEHAM: But you invited a representative of local<br />
government. PM: Yes because they are government. They are<br />
government. I made the simple point the other day to Dr<br />
Hewson courtesy of the media. There's one requirement<br />
for attending a heads of government meeting and that's to<br />
be a head of government.<br />
LYNEHAM: But he will be, will he, at the April get<br />
together to -talk about constitutional change?<br />
PM: I certainly hope so. it's something quite<br />
different. Trhat's not how existing governments cooperate.<br />
That is about looking at the constitution to<br />
see for the future whether there are possible changes to<br />
the constitution which will make for better governance in<br />
this country. And not only is it appropriate, and in my<br />
judgement it is necessary, for all political parties to<br />
be represented at that.<br />
LYNEHAM: You've talked about a series of referenda<br />
through this decade. Now I know one idea you have is a<br />
four year term for the House of Reps, perhaps with a<br />
fixed three year component in there so you can't keep<br />
going very very early.<br />
PM: I expressed a personal view on that. I mean it<br />
seems to me as a matter of logic that what you're about<br />
is to say you must address the degree of uncertainty that<br />
is associated with short three year terms. And so you<br />
are going to move to four year terms. Well then you've<br />
got to give some substance to that. So expressing my<br />
view, I mean I don't really have much hang-up about it<br />
being actually fixed and you know except for ' 84 when I<br />
had an early election to get the two Houses into sync,<br />
I've taken the Parliament full term.<br />
LYNEHAM: On other matters Prime Minister, a few other<br />
matters Prime Minister. Dr Hewson is now ahead of you as<br />
preferred Prime Minister for the first time.<br />
PM: Yes, well seven and a half years it's taken someone<br />
to do that. My answer to that has been I don't like<br />
the polls being down. No politician does. I wouldn't<br />
like to have an election now. I've just won an election<br />
and I'm confident that when we have to go to the election<br />
people will then make a judgement as to who is better to<br />
govern them at that time in the light of performance and<br />
alternatives and I'm confident about that outcome. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: It's not a fundamental shift in Bob Hawke's<br />
great love afEfair with the Australian people?<br />
PM: No, not at all. Not at all.<br />
LYNEHAM: You've not been jilted?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I think some of them are<br />
saying hey Bob, we're hurting and we're telling you.<br />
That's fair enough. That's life. But I think in the<br />
longer term more of them would say Bob we'd give you away<br />
if we perceived that you're not prepared to take the<br />
tough decisions. I mean when you're taking tough<br />
decisions and people are hurting they're going to mark<br />
you down. ] 3ut in the end I think more of them mark you<br />
down if they think you're not going to do what you<br />
think's right for the country.<br />
LYNEHAM: Is Federal Labor mounting a smear campaign<br />
against Dr Hewson?<br />
PM: No, certainly not. I think that it's valid to<br />
examine Hewson as the individual and as the leader in<br />
terms of what he's saying. Now one of the more<br />
preposterous things that's been said in federal politics<br />
for a very long time is John Hewson's statement that he<br />
is for the workers and that the Liberal Party is for the<br />
workers. LYNEHAM: He said you've forgotten the aspirations of<br />
workers. PM: Well, ok, but words out of a politician's mouth are<br />
easy. You've got to ask what they mean. He says he's<br />
for the workers and we've forgotten about the workers.<br />
Well what is most important to the workers and what's the<br />
position of H-awke and Hewson in regard to that? The most<br />
important thing is that they be workers, that they have a<br />
job. Otherwise they're not workers. Now he was there<br />
advising the previous government. The Hewson thinking,<br />
the Hewson commitment was there and you had the most<br />
massive growth of unemployment in the post-war period.<br />
You had Hawke come in and have had a rate of worker<br />
creation, job creation, five times faster than under the<br />
Hewson philosophy and the Hewson involvement. What else<br />
has been important to workers is what they get paid.<br />
Hewson as adviser, and Hewson as Leader of the Liberal<br />
Party has opposed every national wage increase, every<br />
time. LYNEHAM: So you reckon you're ahead where it counts?<br />
PM: And I will be. I mean it's easy getting up and<br />
saying I'm for the workers, Hawkey's for the workers.<br />
The things that determine whether you've got a job and<br />
what you get paid for it, what's your remuneration, on<br />
every one of those issues Hewson has been found wanting, </p>
<p>he's been found diametrically opposed to the interests of<br />
workers. LYNEHAM: Finally Prime minister, the Uruguay Round, the<br />
trade talks. We're getting some very gloomy, indeed<br />
alarming predictions from some people about what will<br />
happen if they fail, and increasing suggestions that they<br />
might very well fail.<br />
PM: Yes, there are concerns and there are grounds for<br />
concern. The Europeans are grossly failing to face up to<br />
the responsibilities, the very serious responsibilities<br />
they have in this area. It is known that for a large<br />
number of countries, unless there is agreement in regard<br />
to freeing up international trade in agricultural<br />
products then there won't be agreement on anything.<br />
LYNEHAM: And where do we go if there's a big world trade<br />
war between the United States and the Europeans?<br />
PM: Well, we've got to look to our position. I've<br />
always, as you know, been totally commi~ tted to it and I<br />
remain totally committed to the concept of freeing up<br />
international trade. My whole philosophy and my actions<br />
as Prime Minister have been committed to that and will<br />
continue to be. If you take the worse case scenario that<br />
as a result of the intransigence and particularly of the<br />
Europeans that you are going to get a dissent in<br />
then Australia in that circumstance will have to look to<br />
what it needs to do to protect itself in that situation.<br />
And we will if necessary.<br />
LYNEHAM: Try and join our Asian neighbours.<br />
PM: You'll remember when I first was talking about APEC<br />
I said this is a free trade grouping. committed to<br />
it in respect of itself.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Asia Pacific countries.<br />
PM: Yes, committed to free trading in the area and in<br />
the world. And I make some parenthetical<br />
observation earlier in a worst case scenario if the<br />
world went mad and the Uruguay Round didn't work. You<br />
may have to look at whether within this framework you<br />
have the capacity to adjust yourself to that imposed<br />
reality. Now but don't let there be misinterpretation<br />
of what I'm saying. We will continue to fight harder<br />
than anyone else to get a positive outcome in the Uruguay<br />
Round for the freeing up of international trade. It's<br />
only in what: I hope is not the outcome, I guess it could<br />
be, but it's only in that situation, if it breaks down<br />
and you see a dissent in the trading blocs, that we will<br />
have to therL make the decisions which are necessary to<br />
protect the interests of Australia as far as you can in<br />
that situation. And that's.. </p>
<p>8<br />
LYNEHAM: You're going off to Sydney for Hazel at the<br />
Opera House tonight I gather.<br />
PM: Hazel at the Opera House. Yes.<br />
LYNEHAM: Any nerves?<br />
PM: I've probably got more than she has. I spoke to her<br />
this morning. She sounded pretty confident. I'm very<br />
proud of her.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thanks very much.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
ends </p>
