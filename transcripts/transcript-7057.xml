FOR MEDIA 8 DECEMBER 1986<br />
It is with great pleasure that I sign today the instrument<br />
of ratification by which Australia will become a party to<br />
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone ( SPNFZ) Treaty the<br />
Treaty of Rarotonga.<br />
The countries of the South Pacific Forum have built upon<br />
existing international treaties to make a new treaty that<br />
will help preserve the South Pacific as it is today free<br />
from nuclear weapons stationed in the countries and<br />
territories of the region; free from nuclear waste dumping;<br />
and, with the tragic and we hope temporary, exception of<br />
French Polynesia, free from nuclear testing. All the<br />
countries of the region want to preserve these freedoms and<br />
that is the central purpose of the Treaty.<br />
Australia's ratification follows the passage of the South<br />
Pacific Nuclear Free zone Bill 1986 by Parliament last week.<br />
With the passage of this bill, Australia has become one of<br />
the first independent sovereign countries in the world to<br />
make a commitment by national legislation against the<br />
nuclear weapons option. The Bill commits this and future<br />
Governments to prohibit the manufacture, acquisition and<br />
possession of nuclear explosive devices and the stationing<br />
and testing of such devices within Australia's territory.<br />
We take great pride in this stand.<br />
Our ratification brings the number of ratifications to<br />
eight, which is the number required to bring the Treaty into<br />
force. once our instrument of ratification is lodged with<br />
the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation in Suva,<br />
the Treaty's provisions will come into effect.<br />
The Government is particularly proud of the part Australia<br />
has played along with its South Pacific partners in<br />
promoting this initiative and bringing it to conclusion. We<br />
regard the Treaty as a positive contribution to regional<br />
security and stability, in addition to giving formal<br />
expression to deeply felt regional concerns about nuclear<br />
proliferation, testing and dumping in the South Pacific.<br />
On 1 December the Protocols to the Treaty were opened for<br />
signature by the five nuclear weapon states to signify their<br />
binding acceptance not to use or threaten the use of nuclear<br />
weapons against parties to the Treaty nor to'conduct nuclear<br />
testing in the South Pacific. It is the Government's strong </p>
<p>hope that all the nuclear weapons states, which have major<br />
responsibility for international peace and security, will<br />
adhere to the Protocols.<br />
The entry into force of the Treaty flowing from the<br />
Australian ratification constitutes a clear and unequivocal<br />
message to the world of the earnest desire of South Pacific<br />
Forum countries for the preservation of the South Pacific as<br />
the peaceful region which its name implies.<br />
NOTE<br />
The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty will be ratified in<br />
the Prime Minister's Office at 11.00 am on Monday, 8 December.<br />
