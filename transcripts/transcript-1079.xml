OPE~ NING OF SPACE-TRACKING STATION AT<br />
j. 9TH iKARCH, 3 196~<br />
Speech by the Prime Ministeruth te rk~ o. RobertMenzies.<br />
Sir, Your Excellencies and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
You may imagine that my presence here calls for<br />
some explanation and I concede that point, I am here for two<br />
reasons. One is that as I am cA'llen Fairhall's Prime Minister,<br />
he wasntt game not to ask me. ( Laughter) Now that is one very<br />
good reason, The other very good reason is that he knew that I<br />
would bring to this task a completely fresh and untrammelled<br />
mind untrammelled by the faintest scientific kcnowledge. I<br />
live in the Dark Ages in this sense. I drive in here this<br />
morning and I see this great dish-looking object stickin out<br />
and in some vague way I know it has something to do with<br />
collecting information from outside, but how it is done I haven't<br />
the faintest idea, This is unpardonable ignorance, I know.<br />
I can see Sir Frederick . hite gazing at me with great contempt.<br />
But it does give me an objective, and clearer, mind. I come<br />
to this problem without any prejudices whatever, and therefore,<br />
coming to it without prejudice, I just want to say I think this<br />
is a very remarkable example of two things.<br />
The first is the rapid progress that is made in<br />
this scientific and technological age. I know that every now<br />
and then something will crop up in Cabinet and my colleague<br />
( Mr. Fairhall) here will be putting up a proposal of some kind<br />
and in our ignorance we may question it and want to know what<br />
the end result is and whether the end result is really wprth<br />
all ttxt money and he constantly tells us and it is so rue<br />
that it is not really the end result so much as the information<br />
you gather as you go the improvement in techniques, th<br />
stretching out of the borders of our own technological knowledge<br />
that is so important, This is profoundly true,<br />
Je, perhaps, direct too much attention to some<br />
distant end result and too little to the fact that in this<br />
century increasingly in this century the country that is<br />
backward in these fields will be backwrard in a hundred ways<br />
that may not appear to be closely connected with what is going<br />
on. Therefore this is a great step forward, a notable event<br />
in this technological period of our lives.<br />
In the second place, it is one more example of the<br />
kind of co-operation that is extended by the United States to<br />
its friends; not always perhaps to its friends, but in double<br />
measure to its friends.<br />
I looked through the papers that were sent to me<br />
to find out something about the budgetary aspects of these tracking<br />
stations and I am bound to tell you, Mr. ILydman, though you<br />
musn't use this against me in future, that I thought it was a<br />
bit one-sided. You seem to be carrying the enormous bulk of<br />
the expenditure. Well, this is, if I may say so, characteristic<br />
of your great country. 4~ e, ourselves, have been capable of~<br />
building up great resources in what may be called scientific<br />
manpower and this station is manned, as I gather, by Australians. 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
This is a great advantage to us because it increases our stock<br />
of knowledge in these fields in Australia, It is also of<br />
advantage to the United States because in suitable apeas, it<br />
is able to get highly skilled and authentic information in the<br />
course of tracking the satellites or other objects moving around<br />
in space. There is a certain mutuality about this,<br />
But beaind it all there is a tremendous friendship.<br />
Any time, I am told, that some reports go in from one of the<br />
tracking stations in Australia, there will be a friendly and<br />
generous compliment passed from the United States end on the<br />
skill with which the operation has been conducted.<br />
Sometimes people think that a little country like<br />
Australia, little in terms of numbers, maintains a very close<br />
friendship with the United States purely for purposes of selfinterest,<br />
Now, of course, I am not going to deny for one moment<br />
welm've a tremendous lively interest in Australi'a in friendship,<br />
in goodwill, with the United States. But in a way, there is<br />
a mutuality about this because all great powers and history<br />
has demonstrated this inspiro I on the whole, rather more<br />
enmities than friendships jealousies, resistances. Arid they<br />
need friends, Even though Australia is a relatively small<br />
country, I know from my contacts in the United States that<br />
the attitude of Australia on these matters is one of immense<br />
satisfaction to the American administration and the American<br />
people. Big friends, little friends, they are friends, and<br />
friends on this occasion co-operating in one of the new miracles<br />
of the twentieth century.<br />
Sir, that is all I want to say. I notice that you<br />
have discreetly placed around the audience little cartons or<br />
tins or something of fly repellent. They sprayed me with it<br />
on the way out and I am bound to say that so far I haven't<br />
been struck by a fly and I don't think you have either, and<br />
therefore the event is happier still, and adding all these<br />
things together, I have the greatest pleasure in the world in<br />
declaring this Deop Space Tracking Station open. </p>
