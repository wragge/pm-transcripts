ELECTORATE TALK<br />
What Australians want is prosperity, stability and security.<br />
A year ago the Government took over the economic management<br />
of a country in which a generation of progress had been<br />
destroyed, and from which the prosperity, stability and<br />
security which Australians had come to take for granted,<br />
had disappeared. We began the fight against inflation<br />
immediately. The Government's goal was economic restoration with the<br />
fight against inflation as first priority. That fight has<br />
gone well better than expected.<br />
Nevertheless, the high cost structure developed between 1972<br />
and 1975 continued to have its effect. Australian manufactured<br />
goods were no longer competitive in world markets. The returns<br />
to Australian farmers became more and more out of line with<br />
wages and salaries for the rest of the community.<br />
For instance, before devaluation, the forecast for average<br />
nett farm incomes was expected to fall to around $ 126 a week.<br />
This is only about two-thirds of average adult male earnings,<br />
which currently are around $ 185 a week.<br />
The social structure was becoming more and more distorted with<br />
the Arbitration Commission protecting trade union members<br />
against some of the effects of inflation, while the burden<br />
on others became heavier and the economy and the nation as<br />
a whole suffered.<br />
In September, regrettable and incautious remarks by the<br />
Federal Opposition exaggerated a run against the Australian<br />
dollar. 800 million dollars drained out of our national<br />
reserves. Devaluation halted this run on the dollar. It<br />
has opened the way for a recovery in foreign investment and<br />
of exports by rural industry, by miners and by manufacturers.<br />
1-</p>
<p>The fight against inflation goes on. Those sectors hardest<br />
hit by rapid wage increases and declining overseas markets<br />
now have their chance for revival. Those overseas firms which<br />
have held back from investments in Australia by approval for<br />
specific projects given by the F. I. R. B. have been encouraged<br />
to press ahead. Those Australian firms, with plant capacity<br />
under-utilised because of pressure from imports, now have the<br />
potential to expand production. There will be greater return<br />
in Australian dollars for primary producers. Over the past<br />
year, these sectors of the economy, along with Australia's<br />
unemployed, have made sacrifices in the cause of fighting<br />
inflation. The burden on them has been eased, or will be<br />
eased, as a result of the restored competitiveness of Australian<br />
industry.<br />
As a result of the decision to devalue, farmers can now look<br />
forward to an increase in their nett incomes of about thirteen<br />
percent to a forecast $ 143 a week. This is still $ 40 less than<br />
the adult male wage, but it is an improvement. Nevertheless,<br />
farmers, together with all other sections of the community,<br />
must face the fact that the fight against inflation will go on.<br />
Devaluation is part of an overall approach. The business<br />
community has been warned to make preparations now for the<br />
seasonal tightness in liquidity in the June quarter next year.<br />
A new, slightly higher, interest rate structure has been<br />
established as another of the control measures. An examination<br />
has been launched of the structure of customs by-laws to see<br />
whether tariff reductions can be made in areas where imports<br />
do not compete with domestic industry and do not endanger<br />
Australian jobs.<br />
Devaluation means an increase in economic activity, and a<br />
decrease in unemployment. It does not mean any diminution<br />
in the fight against inflation. Our resolve to fight and beat<br />
inflation is stronger than ever. 2 </p>
