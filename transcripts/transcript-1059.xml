OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE N. R. M. A. METHj ADOFICE<br />
BUI Go DNEY, N. S. J. 12TH FEBRJAIRYJE6<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, Sir Robert enie<br />
Sir Norman, Parliamentary colleagues and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I am very happy to be here, because Norman Nock<br />
is happy to have me here, and I tell you that this took<br />
doing. He first of all started on me back in about September,<br />
I think, or somewhere around there, or earlier. I found<br />
every excuse in the world for saying no. He then had another<br />
go at me and I found an equally valid excuse for saying no.<br />
But he's like the character in " Alice in Wonderland" what<br />
he says three times is right. And when he said it the third<br />
time it was right I surrendered. And so I am here to perform<br />
a very, very pleasant duty.<br />
I am very glad to say that my pleasure is added<br />
to by the fact that when I was sitting down there just now, I<br />
turned around to the right and I saw, in one blow of the eye,<br />
Dan Minogue, 14, P., and the Post Office clock. And this is<br />
w.-orth mentioning, because this is a perfect further proof of'<br />
the virtue of persistence; because the first gI times that<br />
Dan Minogue got up and made a powerful speech even if a<br />
trifle Hibernian about the Post Office clock I was heard<br />
to say by my colleagues: " Lot of nonsense! L~ t of nonsense!<br />
Thing looks better without the tower." But he won, in the<br />
long run. Now the virtue of persistence is of course, a<br />
great one . one of the great virtues. Enthusiasm and<br />
persistence have done great things in this country and<br />
Itd like to take this opportunity of telling you thai I regard<br />
the N. R. M. A. as an outstanding example of what can be done by<br />
this combination. It is very hard to believe in fact I I-ould<br />
not have believed it unless I had seen it in print in the<br />
annual report that you began really at the end ol 1923,<br />
early 1924+ at about the time I was buying my first motor<br />
vehicle. Now it is not a lon time ago, and to thin!, that within<br />
that period of time you're Deginning to tal~ k soberly and<br />
seriously of having a million members within another eight or<br />
nine years is, I think, an almost phenomenal story, summarised<br />
as it is in those figures.<br />
Norman Nock said that he hoped that I or some<br />
miserable successor at Canberra would be able to attend the<br />
opening of a building there, having regard to the growth of<br />
Canberra. ' dell, the growth of CanberraI just like the growth<br />
of the N. R. M is a tremendous proof of what goes on in<br />
Australia somethi~ ng that we ought to be more proud of,<br />
perhaps, than we are.<br />
When i first went to Canberra and became as<br />
I was, I assure you an eminently respectable Attorney-General,<br />
the population of Canberra was 6 000; you could stroll around<br />
it in an afternoon. Now it is g07000; before you can say<br />
" knife" l, it will be a hundred thousand. They tell me it will<br />
be a quarter of a million not long after my time about<br />
the turn of the century. So there's plenty of scope, Mr.<br />
Chairman, plenty of scope for your work. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now I like, for the reasons that I have mentioned,<br />
I like the symbolism of this great Association. Because it<br />
does symbolise an Australian spirit and Australian growth.<br />
We are a little bit inclined, aren't we, in Australia I seem<br />
to have observed it myself a few times to " knock" our own<br />
country or to " knock" our own Government ( well that I think,<br />
is legitimate and sometimes justified). But we mustn't think<br />
that our country is always wrong, or that some other countries<br />
have some magnificent splendour about them that has been denied<br />
to ours, because I affirm that this is the most exciting<br />
country in the world. No country that wasn't exciting could<br />
have in your own fashion, produced the results that you see<br />
about you when you contemplate the record and achievements<br />
of your own Association.<br />
There is another thing about it. We have some<br />
tendency, haven't we, to think that the Government is the<br />
universal provider. I have even had deputations from<br />
distinguished bodies including motorists' bodies who had<br />
somethi~ ng to say to me on that point, and I won't revive these<br />
arguments because I'm sure that before I'm much older, somebody<br />
else will revive them for me. That's right. But there is<br />
a disposition, isn't there, to say, 114all, we pay our taxes,<br />
the Government should whatever the Government may be<br />
Federal or State or TKunicipal it ought to attend toth<br />
business." That is only true up to a point.<br />
Governments and Government Departments are not, in<br />
their nature, creators, They are regulators. They can come<br />
in aid of what private citizens do, they can hinder what private<br />
citizens do, but they are not in their own nature equipped for<br />
the creative arts or the creative activities in a community,<br />
These proceed from individuals. It is man and woman who are<br />
the creative force in a community, It is the imagination of<br />
the individual which, warming the imagination of a community,<br />
or of a state, or of a nation, 9 can do such things for the<br />
nation. And therefore) while Governments and Government<br />
Departments have their -proper place, we must always be on guard<br />
against thinking that they are the be-all and the end-all, the<br />
port of first call and the port of last call, in all our<br />
difficulties. Now the founders of N. R. M. A. understood this perfectly,<br />
because if I were asked to define an organisation which<br />
exemplifies the benefits of private responsibility, of a<br />
sense of community of a sense of independence and of selfhelp,<br />
I would say this is an outstanding example of it. Now<br />
this is something to be proud of.<br />
I have just been through this lovely building. It is<br />
a good deal better than Parliament House at Canberra, and,<br />
as my wife has pointed out the Board Room here is very much<br />
better and more civilised than the Cabinet Room at Canberra,<br />
But I have been through this lovely building and I share your<br />
pride in it. But to go through it is to discover through the eye,<br />
actually, what one has otherwise read on pieces of paper the<br />
enormous variety of services that you provide. I even<br />
revisited the glimpses of the moon by visiting your solicitor<br />
in his office and there were briefs on the table, tied up<br />
wtith red tape! Retrospectively my mouth watered. Oh, for<br />
the dear dead days. But when they were on my table, they had<br />
all come in, but on his table they were all ready to go out,<br />
ready to gladden the hearts of some Junior Counsel. I felt for<br />
them. It was lovely. </p>
<p>-3<br />
But to have all these people engaged in providing a<br />
service to members in what may seem a rather dull occupation<br />
but what, in my experience as a Junior, presented the most<br />
infinite variety of activities And all being provided<br />
for members by this great Association, and with great shx'eudness<br />
if I may still stick to my lost like a good cobbler or with<br />
great skill because I noticed in the report that, of the many<br />
thousands of' occasions when appearances were made in court it<br />
was only on a certain number that defences were entered. And<br />
in those cases in which defences were entoz'od, 77% of the<br />
defences succeeded* Now this is either a proof of the immense<br />
skill and judgment exercised in this building, or of the<br />
immense skill and judgmient of the Counsel who have been appearing<br />
in these cases, or a new and genteel outlook on the part of<br />
magistrates. Because I confess that in my time, which is now,<br />
as you all know, many years ago, when I was appearing a little<br />
in the Courts of Petty Sessions in Victoria, to appear for a<br />
motorist charged with an offence was a mere formality. You got<br />
your fee and he got his fine!<br />
d~ ell, things have changed. Here's one excample, to<br />
say nothing of the tremendous services that you give in the<br />
field. This Association is an almost constant presence all<br />
over the State, This is something to be thankful for. And<br />
it is not done because an Act of Parliament said it had to be<br />
done, It is not done because some Department was established<br />
to do it. It is done because thousands of wise men and women<br />
got together on this miatter and said, " We must have something<br />
of this kind and we are prepared to establish it, and we are<br />
prepared to maintain it." And the result is this tremendous<br />
achievement that you are all thinking about today.<br />
Now it would be a very poor show indeed if I spoilt the<br />
opening of this building by rambling on, and I don't prop~ ose<br />
to ramble on. All : I want to say is that Norman Nock spoke quite<br />
truly when he said that he and I have been good friends for very<br />
many years. I even listened to Norman make speeches when hie was<br />
Lord Mayor, and that is the highest test of friendship, But it<br />
is because of that, as well as all these other reasons of<br />
substance that I have been referring to, that it has given me<br />
very great pleasure to come here,<br />
I would just like to say as she may not have an<br />
opportunity of saying it for herself how deeply my wife<br />
appreciates this rare compliment that you have paid her this<br />
afternoon. I don't imagine there are many life members of this<br />
Association of either sex. She is the first and she of course<br />
is delighted, And delighted for an extra reason, an3that is t? 3t<br />
al~ l our married life, or all our motoring life, I have been<br />
heard occasionally to say, " Humph. 1 4oman driveril" ( This is,<br />
mind you, a private admission-, it is not to go any further,<br />
you know.) And she has in recent years, particularly, said,<br />
" lNonsense. The women Lrivers are the best. Don't talk such<br />
rubbish." You see? And Liow it turns out that stie's right.<br />
Now thatts a wonderful thing. Here she is, demonstrated clearly<br />
in the report on the graph, overwhelmingly, to be right. The<br />
only comfort ihat I can take out of the same graph is that I<br />
notice that the accident rate among the lads from 17 to 20 is<br />
the d-ghest on the chart and I daresay some of my grandsons<br />
will be entering that bracket disastrously in due course and<br />
the fellows of 70 have the best record of the lot. 000000/ 4 </p>
<p>Sir, I thank you very much for the opportunity<br />
of coming here in a brief way to declare this building<br />
open. I assure you that it is a very great privilege and<br />
deeply appreciated by me.<br />
I wish the Association all success. I hope and<br />
believe that in another thirty years which will be, I<br />
shrewdly suspect, after my time but not after the time of<br />
some of you now present you'll have two million, and you'll<br />
have three times the size of this building occupied in Sydney.<br />
And as long as you do this will be living proof to the<br />
people of what a greai country we live in and what magnificent<br />
people we have in it.<br />
Sir, I have great pleasure in declaring the<br />
building open. </p>
