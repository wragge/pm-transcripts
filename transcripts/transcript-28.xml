Thze VICE FPENTD. Memubae at<br />
the Senate, it J2 UWy grat privilege to present to you the prime Minister of<br />
Australia. ( Applause. Senators rising.]<br />
, Prime Minister BCqM Mir, It to a<br />
very remarkables experience for we to be<br />
allowed to speak in this viac= for the<br />
second time. As I said somewhaere<br />
about, a silar matter, It is rather flattaering,<br />
because the nrt-t time the Invitatiors<br />
might have been atcldenWa, but the<br />
second time It must be deliberate.<br />
I also. air, remember that on a formoer<br />
occasion When It spoke hera. in 1950, r<br />
felt that I had had a busy day, because.<br />
in my Invocence. I thought I would maske<br />
one speech; but then I discovered, 4tMl<br />
in my innocence, that I wouild hae" to<br />
make two. And then I wa&amp; taken off<br />
by Senator Connally to a lunicteon of the<br />
Foreign Mfairn andi/ or Foreign Relations<br />
Comittee, and I found I had to make<br />
three Speeches.<br />
But. sli'. I welcome this opportunity.<br />
not because I want to Inflict a speech<br />
upon Senators. but beecase I think it<br />
sagords a splendid occasicin to say to the<br />
Berrate of the United Stsites somesthing<br />
from Australia-<br />
I do not suppose that amy parliamentary<br />
amibly In the world hus had Such<br />
responiblldtez to carry In the part<br />
years as has this one-You bae" bad<br />
the privilege and the responullltS of<br />
accepting toward other portions of the<br />
tree world the most remarkable obligations;<br />
anid to accept those, you have bad<br />
to exhibit a willinguess to placep burdens-<br />
heavy burdens.-on your own people.<br />
I an politiclan enough, after * I)<br />
MY yeas of politics, to kow that Is not<br />
the asiest thing Ina the world. but you<br />
have done it.<br />
One of the stonishing ttftgs. one of<br />
the cynical thinga, perhaps. in the world<br />
i that every now and then theft are encountered<br />
people who have reeived benefits<br />
who rather resent It. who rater<br />
resent having some feeling of oblgaton<br />
to someoone ese. That must. as it ctones<br />
back to you occaclonally. make you fead<br />
somewhat Irritated. But 1 Should like<br />
to say, on behalf of AustrmiaB. that we<br />
have no1thidg but admiremdon, nothing<br />
but gratitude. for the magnificent<br />
magnanimity gad leadeiaalv which you<br />
have given to thre world. [ Applause.]<br />
Sir, thwe is oam othor thing I should<br />
lik to eay-we are free people. We etgags<br />
in political Conmlits. Promn a close<br />
Perusal ot the newspapers in the pea<br />
few dams I bae gathered that they are<br />
iot ukno0wn, even here. ELahgter. l<br />
But we ina Australls carry them on with<br />
what Winstofi Churchill oncet dexcribed<br />
as a Lane 1ath century far; and your<br />
polltlclaw, too. can strike blows anad receive<br />
blows with gusto. But the point<br />
about It all is that we do all these things<br />
within the framework of freedom; and<br />
because we attach importance to that<br />
freedom, It is of the cance that we look<br />
Zrallad the world so that we may have<br />
great, friends or email friends in thte<br />
defense of freedom in the defense of the<br />
right to disaree without elIution.<br />
[ Applause.] ln the ease of Australia. We have great<br />
friends. We are, in tertis of population.<br />

of our own life as a free nation we had<br />
an expression, a sentiment was uttered<br />
