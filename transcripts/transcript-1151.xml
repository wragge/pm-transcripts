FOR PRESS P. M. No. 67/ 196<br />
HOSTILITIES BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN<br />
Statement by the Prime Ministers Sir Robert Meazies<br />
The Australian Government is deeply distressed<br />
by the armed hostilities between India and Pakistan7<br />
hostilities which appear to be widening and growing in<br />
intensity. All Australians deplore the loss of life and<br />
destruction of property of two great nations for whom we in<br />
Australia have an affectionate feeling and profound goodwill.<br />
It would be a great tragedy if great damage should be done to<br />
what has been achieved in recent years in their economic<br />
development and. social progress.<br />
We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General<br />
of the United Nations, U Thant, aci. ng with the backing of<br />
the Security , Jouncil, to do all that he can to try to end<br />
this state of affairs. He has the full support of the<br />
Australian Government in his important task.<br />
I have sent individual messages to the Prime<br />
Minister of India and the President of Pakistan setting out<br />
our views along these lines and urging that they do everything<br />
within their power to make the efforts of the Secretary-<br />
General fruitful.<br />
CANERRA, 8th September, 1965. </p>
