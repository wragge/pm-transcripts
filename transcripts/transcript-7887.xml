HATH: Priame Xinister, thanks for your time.<br />
Pm: Pleasure Michael.<br />
EATH: You've come to Perth at more than an interesting<br />
political time. From your point of view and from sitting<br />
in Canberra, how urgent it is that the current crisis in the<br />
State be resolved?<br />
PX: Well once the crisis has moved, once it's clear that<br />
the question of leadership is on the table then it's in<br />
everyone's interests, the State Party, the federal Party and<br />
I believe the community of Western Australia that it be<br />
solved quickly and I respect the rapidity with which it is<br />
going to be solved I understand that Peter Dowding has<br />
called a meeting for next Monday, the decision will be made<br />
then. That's good.<br />
HEATH: Speculation's been going on for a couple of days now<br />
though. If you had one message for your colleagues, what<br />
would it be here?<br />
PM: The only message is the one I've given, to resolve it<br />
on Monday.<br />
HEATH: Do you know Carmen Lawrence at all?<br />
PM: Yes, I know her reasonably well. I've had the<br />
opportunity of speaking for her in her campaigns and she<br />
impresses me as a capable, no-nonsense sort of person. I<br />
don't want to go into any more details because I'm not here<br />
intervening in this issue. It is a matter, as I've said,<br />
for the State Parliamentary Labor Party.<br />
HEATH: But in the past though you've given ringing<br />
endorsements to both Brian Burke and Peter DoMwding. Would<br />
Caruf Lawrence make a good leader?<br />
PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>PM: I believe she would.<br />
HEATH: Better than Peter Dowd~ ing?<br />
PN: I can't -it's not appropriate while there's, still an<br />
issue between them to go to that.<br />
HUATH: What about in terms of your election timing? Given<br />
what's happened, are you inclined to if there were a<br />
change at the top to let things settle down in the State<br />
to perhaps help you along federally?<br />
PX: Not I don't think that would make any difference. That<br />
wouldn't cause me to prolong or shorten the decision and<br />
the decision hasn't been taken yet. I'm still thinkinq<br />
about it.<br />
HUATH: But still the disillusion in the State is still<br />
quite strong. it wouldn't be a factor at all?<br />
PX: Well let se make this point of it. You talkt about<br />
disillusion. I have a such greater faith in the<br />
intelligence of the West Australian electorate. I don't<br />
think West Australians are masochists. It would be an~ act<br />
of masochism to impose upon themselves the abolition of<br />
Miedicare, a frightful health seas, a worse education system,<br />
a waes explosion. All those things necessarily would<br />
follow fro, a Peacock Government. Now what you are really<br />
implying in your question is that the Vest Australians are<br />
so silly, so unintelligent, so masochistic, that they're<br />
going to inflict a hurt upon themselves to kick a West<br />
Australian State Government in the tail. Now I'm a West<br />
Australian,, my background, this is where I grew up. I just<br />
don't think West Australians are that silly.<br />
HUATH: Youtve got nine seats here. Are you going to keep<br />
then All?<br />
PX: Yes, I've said this morning I think so but I have to<br />
make point that theres been a redistribution and that<br />
redistribution of course makes the seat of Allen Blanchard's<br />
the more a very difficult one. So that's in a different<br />
category. I hope because he's a very good member that<br />
we can hold it. But nominally you have to put that into a<br />
category. But in regard to rest, I believe we will hold<br />
them and I hope we can Moore too.<br />
METN.* You've got senior Ministers in trouble.<br />
PM: Well that's your Judgement because you are saying that<br />
in respect of aome polling that has been done some time<br />
before where there wasn't the question really in the minds<br />
of the electorate about who do you want now to govern </p>
<p>h. Australia. You are saying that on that polling some time<br />
ago they are in trouble. Veil I'm not being complacent or<br />
cocky about it. I simply say that I have faith in the goood<br />
sense of the West Australian electorate<br />
REATH: In't it also true that your own research is telling<br />
you at th~ e moment that you're still on a knife edge even<br />
if you go nov your victory is a few seats only.<br />
PM: Well, if you thought I was going to reveal what our<br />
research shows, you're an optimist. Let me say this, that<br />
our people are in the field now. 1,' l1 be getting the<br />
research in the near future. It is some time since we've<br />
done our own polling some time. The only recent, very,<br />
very recent research that has been given to as is in~ regard<br />
to a Queensland seat and may I say it looks pretty good.<br />
HEATU: So you can't say how confident you're going to be,<br />
by how much you're going to win?<br />
PU: No, I would say that I would hope to at least hold the<br />
majority that veove got.<br />
HEATH: Do you think it might be decided in the West?<br />
PK: Well, if you say that it mean. the results elsewhere<br />
are irrelevant. I mean the results in every state will be<br />
important-I think that we will win seats in Queenslan4. I<br />
think we'll win seats in Tasmania and I feel reasonably<br />
confident about Victoria, and certainly about New South<br />
Wales and by the time the election's9 held I feel confident<br />
about Western Australia. I meon every state will be<br />
significant.<br />
HEATH: What are you going to tell the voters about interest<br />
rates during the campaign?<br />
PK: I will simply say theme things, Michael. We haven't<br />
had then high because I'm a sadist or a masochist. They've<br />
been tight in the context of tight fiscal policy and tight<br />
wages policy. And they've been tight because as a country<br />
we have been consuming more than we're producing and<br />
theref ore we've been importing more than we can pay for and<br />
that Uas been running up an unsustainable external current<br />
account. And therefore interest rates have been high, that<br />
policy has worked, they are coming of f. That's what I's<br />
saying. HIM'S: And your Treasurer at that same time has been saying<br />
while they'll come off, they'll remain high, comparatively<br />
high, for some time. What are you going to tell me about<br />
that? </p>
<p>PM: Well, he is not wrong when he says that. They will<br />
remain comparatively high to some countries because we<br />
still, an a country, have to get capital from overseas,<br />
there is some differential there, but the rates are coming<br />
down. Now, in the end you've got to ask yourself the<br />
question. Are You dealing with a mug electorate or a<br />
sophisticated electorate?<br />
HULTH: Whatever Senator Button'-1s comments about the<br />
leadership, do you acknrowledge that you're going to have a<br />
problen persuading people that Xr Keating is prepared to<br />
wait a full term before he gets in.<br />
PH: No, because Senator Button doesn't kinow what he's<br />
talking about simple as that. I said in a pros<br />
confereztc earlier today that Senator Button'sa comments were<br />
just gratuitous and incorrect.<br />
HEMS: But won't you still have to persuade electors that's<br />
the case?<br />
PM1: Nog no because<br />
MLTH: You don't consider you're vulnerable on it?<br />
PH: Nog of course I don't. I simply believe that the<br />
electorate will believe me rather than some assuzption that<br />
a talkative Senator has expressed.<br />
ends<br />
A! I </p>
