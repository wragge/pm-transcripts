PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT " THE LIGHT ON THE HILL" INAUGURAL DINNER<br />
BATHURST 21 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Here, in the city of his birth one hundred years ago<br />
tomorrow, we come together to honour the memory of<br />
Joseph Benedict Chifley.<br />
The great themes of Ben Chifley's career, the loves and<br />
loyalties of his life, were clear and simple. First and<br />
last, there was his love for and faith in Australia and<br />
its people. Inseparable from this, was his love for and<br />
faith in the Australian Labor movement, as the servant<br />
of the Australian people so much so that he<br />
specifically identified the Australian Labor Party as<br />
his " real religion".<br />
But throughout his life, and never more than when he was<br />
leader of this nation, he always drew strength from his<br />
roots here in Bathurst; and when he proudly identified<br />
himself as " a child of the pavements, a boy from the<br />
bush" he meant Bathurst.<br />
He would never have boasted that he was a citizen of the<br />
world, although his abiding faith in the,* essential<br />
goodness of humanity and his service to the cause of<br />
humanity would certainly have entitled him to that<br />
description. Even as Prime Minister, he would have<br />
eschewed the title of first citizen of Australia. But<br />
he did allow himself one boast the boast that he was a<br />
citizen of Bathurst, which to him was simply the best<br />
place in Australia.<br />
And who, in this room tonight, is going to challenge his<br />
op i nion?<br />
During his life and since his death, Ben Chifley was<br />
often compared with Abraham Lincoln. </p>
<p>The comparisons have seized on the more obvious<br />
similarities humble origins, the lack of formal<br />
education, the love of humanity and the love of country,<br />
the homespun humour, the laconic wit, the common touch,<br />
the simplicity of style, the simple faith in the simple<br />
virtues. But there was also a more profound similarity, which has<br />
not been so often noticed.<br />
For all their genuine simplicity, both Lincoln and<br />
Chifley possessed, in the best sense, great<br />
sophistication, subtlety and complexity of intellect.<br />
Chifley of course, made no pretensions to being an<br />
intellectual. But he brought to bear, on every task<br />
during his great career, perhaps the most powerful<br />
intellect of any Australian politician of his age and<br />
generation.<br />
He always expressed his regret at his lack of formal<br />
education. That was the reason why he made such strong<br />
efforts for his own self-education, particularly on<br />
financial and economic subjects. It was also partly the<br />
reason why he recruited around him, as Treasurer and<br />
Prime Minister, some of the best qualified young men in<br />
Australia of whom, in terms of the service they were<br />
to give to Australia and to successive Australian<br />
Governments, H. C. ( Nugget) Coombs may stand as an<br />
example. And it is one of the reasons why he did so<br />
much to broaden the opportunities for tertiary education<br />
in Australia through such measures as the Commonwealth<br />
scholarship scheme, the Commonwealth Reconstruction<br />
Training Scheme and the establishment of the Australian<br />
National University to ensure that new generations of<br />
Australians would have the opportunities that he and<br />
most of his generation never had.<br />
Yet none of his peers, none of his contemporaries, none<br />
of his opponents, were ever left in any doubt that, with<br />
Chifley, they were dealing not only with ' a strong<br />
personality but with a commanding intellect as well.<br />
I mention this aspect only to redress the balance of<br />
history as it is often received and perceived.<br />
Full justice will not be done to Chifley if we fail to<br />
recognise that, behind all his great qualities of heart,<br />
soul and character, lay an extraordinary mind and an<br />
extraordinarily powerful intellect.<br />
I have said that I have dwelt upon this point to redress<br />
the perceptions of history. </p>
<p>But I also do it to illuminate the text on which I am<br />
called to address you tonight the text which will be<br />
the theme of the series of lectures which my address<br />
tonight inaugurates.<br />
The theme is " The Light on the Hill".<br />
And that is to be the title by which all the subsequent<br />
lectures, endowed by the New South Wales Branch of the<br />
Australian Labor Party, will be known.<br />
It is a text taken, of course, from one of Chifley's<br />
most famous speeches his address to the annual<br />
conference of the New South Wales Branch of the Party at<br />
the Sydney Town Hall in June 1949 six months before<br />
our defeat by Menzies on 10 December 1949.<br />
Few who heard him believed that his Government was on<br />
the verge of defeat, and none could have conceived that<br />
another twenty-three years would elapse before the<br />
election of another Labor Government of Australia.<br />
And perhaps of all the 1500 conference delegates in that<br />
historic chamber thirty-six years ago, Chifley alone<br />
sensed the full extent of the dangers and difficulties<br />
ahead for the Party he loved so much and the waste and<br />
the loss that was to follow, through disloyalty,<br />
disunity, betrayal and, most of all, stupidity, in the<br />
long barren years to come.<br />
A very important point I wish to make tonight and<br />
inaugurating these lectures I think it is absolutely<br />
essential that I should establish this point at<br />
their outset is this: when Chifley spoke of the light<br />
on the hill, he was neither coining nor mouthing a<br />
slogan.<br />
Far from being a mere slogan, it was the very<br />
distillation of the essence of the beliefs, experiences,<br />
ideals and goals of a lifetime.<br />
Nor is " the light on the hill" a statement of narrow<br />
ideology. It is, in its full context, a most practical<br />
and precise statement of what the Australian Labor Party<br />
and the Australian Labor movement is all about five<br />
splendid words which sum up not only the meaning of<br />
Chifley's lifetime of service to Australia, but sum up<br />
the nature, meaning and purpose of this great political<br />
and industrial movement the Australian Labor Party.<br />
So let me put the words in their full context. </p>
<p>And, as you hear them, I ask you to put the words of Ben<br />
Chifley thirty-six years ago in the context of<br />
Australia's present and Australia's future.<br />
It is a long quotation but I know the men and women of<br />
Bathurst will, of all Australians, be most willing to<br />
hear again and to understand the words and meaning of<br />
their greatest fellow citizen.<br />
And what Ben Chifley said to the annual conference of<br />
the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party<br />
on 12 June 1949, was this:<br />
" I have had the privilege of leading the Labor Party for<br />
nearly four years. It is a man-killing job and would be<br />
impossible if it were not for the help of my colleagues<br />
and members of the movement. No Labor Minister or<br />
leader ever has an easy job. The urgency that rests<br />
behind the Labor movement, pushing it on to do things,<br />
to create new conditions, to reorganise the economy of<br />
the country, always means that the people who work<br />
within the Labor movement, people who lead, can never<br />
have an easy job. The job of the evangelist is never<br />
easy. But the strength of the movement cannot come from<br />
US. We make plans and pass legislation to help and<br />
direct the economy of the country. But the job of<br />
getting the things the people of the country want comes<br />
from the roots of the labor movement the people who<br />
support it because they believe in a movement that has<br />
been built up to bring better conditions to the people.<br />
I try to think of the Labor movement, not as putting an<br />
extra sixpence in somebody's pocket, or making somebody<br />
Prime Minister or Premier, but as a movement bringing<br />
something better to the people, better standards of<br />
living, greater happiness to the mass of the people. We<br />
have a great objective the light on the hill which<br />
we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind<br />
not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand.<br />
It it were not for that, the Labor movement would not be<br />
worth fighting for. If the movement can make someone<br />
more comfortable, give to some father or. mother a<br />
greater feeling of security for their children, a<br />
feeling that if a depression comes there will be work,<br />
that the Government is striving its hardest to do its<br />
best, then the Labor movement will be completely<br />
justified."<br />
Those, my friends, are the principles which Ben Chifley<br />
applied throughout his career of service to the Labor<br />
movement and to Australia.<br />
I suggest they are principles as relevant to our Party<br />
and the conduct of the affairs of our nation, now, as<br />
they were thirty-six years ago. </p>
<p>Implicit in everything that Chifley said not just in<br />
the " light on the hill" speech but whenever he spoke<br />
about his vision for Australia was the one fundamental<br />
objective of building an Australia dedicated to<br />
fairness, justice and genuine equality of opportunity<br />
for all; where each Australian had an inalienable<br />
entitlement to dignity and security and where all would<br />
share fairly and fully in the abundance and<br />
opportunities that Australia could offer.<br />
And that remains the objective we strive for today.<br />
I said before that the objective set by the light on the<br />
hill was not an ideology, but a practical program; and<br />
that will have become very clear to you as you listened<br />
to the full quotation.<br />
Its practical application, throughout his years as<br />
Curtin's second-in-command during the war and as Prime<br />
Minister from 1945 to 1949, transformed Australian<br />
society. In the years between 1942 and 1949 Australian society<br />
and the Australian economy were fundamentally re-shaped.<br />
The Governments of Curtin and Chifley accepted the<br />
Federal Government's overriding responsibility for the<br />
management of the Australian economy, set the goal of<br />
full employment, established the uniform tax system,<br />
vastly expanded the manufacturing and heavy industry<br />
base, transformed the social security system,<br />
established the post-war immigration scheme, reformed<br />
the banking system, accepted, for the first time, a<br />
share of Commonwealth responsibility for education,<br />
health, housing, power and transport in short,<br />
established the framework of modern Australia.<br />
It is a measure of the strength of those achievements<br />
that they were not reversed or altered in any<br />
fundamental way during nearly a quarter of a century of<br />
conservative rule which followed.<br />
The prosperity Australia enjoyed during most of those<br />
years was built on the foundations which the Chifley<br />
Government had laid.<br />
Australia's tragedy is that successive conservative<br />
governments from Menzies to McMahon wasted the Chifley<br />
legacy.<br />
They failed to make the further changes necessary to<br />
enable Australian industry to meet more adequately the<br />
challenges of a highly competitive world. N. </p>
<p>During those years, conservative governments assumed,<br />
and encouraged the public to assume, that with our<br />
abundance of resources, growth would come naturally,<br />
without real effort, and that the world would readily<br />
buy our surplus production. And the result was that<br />
opportunities were squandered to place our national<br />
growth and the maintenance of our standards on an even<br />
firmer footing than Chifley had established in the postwar<br />
reconstruction years.<br />
Chifley committed his Government firmly to economic<br />
growth. He saw that the vigorous development of<br />
Australian resources and industries was, as his<br />
biographer, the late Professor Crisp wrote " the crucial<br />
source for any substantial advance in material or<br />
cultural wellbeing".<br />
And as Crisp puts it:<br />
" the power of his leadership lay not least<br />
in the degree to which his own intense<br />
convictions about national development prevailed<br />
upon all his colleagues to subordinate much<br />
current political advantage to measures which<br />
could bear fruit only years ahead."<br />
At the same time that he sought to establish the<br />
conditions for economic growth he maintained<br />
simultaneously the fight against inflation.<br />
That was a daunting task in the post-war world a task<br />
made doubly difficult in Australia by constitutional<br />
limitations. But he was determined to follow policies to achieve<br />
economic growth while holding inflation down.<br />
He told the Parliament during the Budget debate in<br />
September 1945:<br />
" I have always stressed the disastrous<br />
results which can overtake the people of any<br />
country, particularly the workers, if the<br />
government is unable to control inflationary<br />
movements. If those movements gather impetus,<br />
they affect the worker in receipt of the basic<br />
wage and margins above it, and are absolutely<br />
cruel to that section of the community which is<br />
receiving a fixed income."<br />
And that message remains very relevant for us, the Labor<br />
movement and the Labor Government, today. That is why<br />
our Government is so firmly committed to sustain growth<br />
without renewed high inflation. </p>
<p>Chifley saw clearly, as we do today, that sustained<br />
growth without inflation was the very basis and<br />
condition for achieving the legitimate aspirations the<br />
Australian people have for themselves and their families<br />
for improved living standards, for secure employment,<br />
for decent housing and for greater security and greater<br />
dignity, in retirement and sickness or incapacity for<br />
whatever reason. He saw, as we do today, that it is<br />
growth which would enable us, as a nation, to improve<br />
the lot of those who depended upon social security<br />
payments for their entitlement to share in the<br />
prosperity of their country.<br />
Throughout my own Prime Ministership I have emphasised<br />
my conviction that, fundamental as our commitment to<br />
growth is, a society which dedicated itself, narrowly<br />
and exclusively, to a single goal of economic growth,<br />
would sow the seeds of its ultimate disintegration; and<br />
that while growth should be pursued for the benefits it<br />
produces for the direct participants in the process by<br />
which that productive growth is achieved, it must<br />
justify itself and be inspired by the recognition that<br />
growth is the basis for ensuring that those of our<br />
fellow Australians who are not its direct beneficiaries<br />
receive from a compassionate society the opportunity to<br />
share equitably in the fruits of growth.<br />
And in making these three parallel commitments the<br />
commitment to growth, the commitment to fighting<br />
inflation, the commitment to social justice and equity<br />
I believe we place ourselves firmly and faithfully in<br />
the Chifley tradition.<br />
I said before that the major achievements of the Chifley<br />
Government had transformed the Australian society and<br />
the Australian economy; and that the foundations then<br />
laid were so strong that they substantially resisted<br />
reversal under twenty-three years of conservative rule.<br />
The conservatives were obliged to maintain the major<br />
programs and indeed expand some of the most important of<br />
them. They completed the Snowy Mountains project which<br />
they had so bitterly derided in Opposition. They<br />
accepted and expanded the role of the Commonwealth in<br />
education, especially tertiary education. They<br />
continued and expanded the immigration program. They<br />
realised they could not vacate the fields of housing and<br />
transport. </p>
<p>But even more fundamental, they accepted the permanence<br />
of the five great pillars of economic management which<br />
Chifley had built<br />
the recognition of the primary role and<br />
responsibility of the national government<br />
for economic policy;<br />
the central banking system;<br />
the strong arbitration system with central<br />
wage fixation;<br />
a strong public sector ( including the<br />
efficient public enterprises)<br />
and the recognition of the interdependence of the<br />
private and public sectors for the achievement<br />
of growth, and the creation of jobs.<br />
However incompetent and crass they may have been from<br />
time to time in the application of these principles,<br />
successive conservative<br />
governments always recognised that these principles were<br />
the imperatives of economic management in modern mixed<br />
economies and in advanced industrial societies like<br />
Australia. Apart from aberrations like the brief flirtation with<br />
the so-called New Federalism, happily never consummated,<br />
and the abandonment of effective central wage fixation<br />
with the horrendous results still fresh in our memories<br />
even the Fraser Government basically supported and<br />
applied those five principles.<br />
Yet now, for the first time for four decades, in a way<br />
and on a scale none of their predecessors would ever<br />
have contemplated, much less proclaimed, the diminished<br />
figures who now claim to wear the mantle of Menzies<br />
propose to take the axe to the very foundations of the<br />
five pillars of our economy.<br />
They propose to do this in the name of economic<br />
rationalism.<br />
That is as great a misnomer, as great an abuse of the<br />
word " rational", as their misappropriation of the noble<br />
word " liberal" to their cause of conservative reaction.<br />
What is rational about destroying the Prices and Incomes<br />
Accord, which has underpinned the recovery and will<br />
continue to be the instrument for sustained noninflationary<br />
growth for years to come? </p>
<p>What is rational about weakening the industrial system<br />
and abandoning central wage fixation?<br />
What in the name of reason, is the justification for<br />
breaking up and selling off the great and efficient<br />
national assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom,<br />
TAA, Qantas?<br />
The fact is that this recipe for disaster represents the<br />
height of irrationality.<br />
And it is irrationality of the most dangerous kind,<br />
because it is based on a blind and mindless commitment<br />
to a narrow, dogmatic and discredited ideology a<br />
reactionary example of the very kind of ideological<br />
self-imprisonment which Chifley never ceased to warn the 1<br />
Labor Party against.<br />
As far as the welfare of the people of Australia is<br />
concerned, there is only one saving grace about this<br />
lurch to the reactionary right by the so-called new<br />
leadership of the opposition.<br />
And not for the first time I quote some words of Ben<br />
Chifley which are as true and relevant today as when he<br />
used them. As he said:<br />
" the opposition parties today wear a veneer<br />
of unity, but it's always hard to know whom<br />
to answer, because there is such a diversity<br />
of opinion amongst their numbers"<br />
But as the people of Australia come to realise the<br />
extent of the economic and social vandalism proposed by<br />
our opponents and indeed as part of the process of<br />
promoting that awareness it will be necessary for us-<br />
Ben Chifley's heirs and successors to keep fresh and<br />
green the memory, the example and the experience of this<br />
great Australian.<br />
My friends,<br />
I have the honour to announce tonight an important<br />
decision by the New South Wales Branch of the Australian<br />
Labor Party which will help significantly in ensuring<br />
that Ben Chifley's life and work is remembered and is<br />
honoured in this State and through~ out this nation.<br />
The Branch proposes to establish the Chifley Foundation.<br />
The Foundation will have a range of mutually consistent<br />
objectives to benefit the Australian Labor Party itself,<br />
the broader Labor movement, and above all, the<br />
Australian community as a whole. </p>
<p>Its objectives will range from the creation of a Labor<br />
Centre through to educational, historical and cultural<br />
initiatives.<br />
The Foundation will also be used as the vehicle for the<br />
Party to acquire its own building in Sydney and to<br />
establish the Labor Centre.<br />
To finance the Foundation's establishment and growth,<br />
donations will be sought not only from the Labor<br />
movement, but from the wider Australian community.<br />
I have been delighted and honoured to accept the<br />
invitation from the New South W~ ales Branch to act as one<br />
of the two patrons of the Foundation. The other patron<br />
will be the Premier of New South Wales and National<br />
President of the Party, Neville Wran.<br />
Further, the New South Wales Branch has decided to offer<br />
annual prizes set at $ 1,500, $ 1,000 and $ 500 for<br />
excellence in scholarship by undergraduate students<br />
writing on the history of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
These prizes are to be named " The Chifley Prizes".<br />
My friends,<br />
I congratulate the New South Wales Branch on these<br />
initiatives. Nothing could be more appropriate than<br />
that this Branch should act in this way to honour the<br />
memory of Ben Chifley.<br />
Ben Chifley did more than anybody-else to save this<br />
Branch from self-destruction in the desperate years of<br />
the 1930s.<br />
Sometimes it almost seemed he was fighting singlehandedly<br />
to preserve New South Wales Labor as a force in<br />
Federal politics.<br />
But his courage, perseverence and patience was<br />
ultimately rewarded by a Party, reunited and<br />
reinvigorated in 1940, and the election in 1941 of the<br />
McKell Labor Government which formed the great war-time<br />
partnership with the Curtin and Chifley Governments.<br />
My friends,<br />
Ben Chifley's great achievement was based on two<br />
impregnable rocks his faith and confidence in the<br />
Australian Labor Party, and his faith and confidence in<br />
the people of Australia. </p>
<p>And may I conclude with another brief quotation not,<br />
this time, from Ben Chifley, but from the 1984 policy<br />
speech I had the honour to deliver on behalf of the<br />
Australian Labor Party, because I believe it expresses<br />
faithfully, for a new age and a new generation, his<br />
philosophy and his creed for Australia.<br />
I said then:<br />
" It is on the basis of confidence in ourselves that we<br />
now have an unparalleled opportunity to build an even<br />
better, fairer Australia.<br />
" Never then was it so important that we should unite to<br />
resist and reject those i-n our midst, whatever their<br />
motives, whatever side or interest they purport to<br />
represent, who would seek to undermine the very fabric<br />
and foundation of our new national self-confidence and<br />
national self-respect.<br />
" And at the heart of national self-respect lies respect<br />
for each other and for the rights of all.<br />
" And that has been the principle behind the great truth<br />
that the Australian community has come increasingly to<br />
realise since March 1983 the truth that the legitimate<br />
aspirations of each group can best be achieved, not by<br />
fighting each other, not by contrived conflict, not by<br />
setting group against group, Australians against<br />
Australians, but by working together, recognising and<br />
respecting each other's rights, reasonable expectations<br />
and fair aspirations.<br />
" That is the fundamental principle on which we can now<br />
work together to build an Australia dedicated to<br />
fairness, justice and genuine equality of opportunity<br />
for all: so that we can truly say as we approach the<br />
third century of this modern nation, that we are<br />
building together a nation in which there are no secondclass<br />
Australians.<br />
" A nation where each of us, irrespective of background,<br />
origin, faith, age or sex, will have undiminished title<br />
to the proud name of Australian;<br />
" An inalienable entitlement for all to fairness,<br />
justice, tolerance, dignity and security;<br />
" A nation in which all can share fairly in the abundance<br />
and all the opportunities offered by this great country<br />
of ours, in the great years now within our grasp." </p>
<p>12<br />
My friends,<br />
In 1985, that is our light on the hill. It burns as<br />
brightly as when our beloved Ben Chifley pointed,<br />
nearly forty years ago, to his light on the hill.<br />
May it always burn for us, and beckon us forward to an<br />
even brighter future for all Australians. </p>
