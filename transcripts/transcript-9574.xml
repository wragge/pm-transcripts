TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW NiTH FRAN KELLY, ABC RADIO, TMURSDAYs 11 MAY 1995<br />
&amp; OIE PROOF COPY<br />
FK Paul Ker~ ihi, D) emocrat Leader, Cheryl Kemnot, is calling for a Senate<br />
Inquiry' Mto the figuring of the Buddetand-th-0 iritegrity of the figuring<br />
what's your response to that?<br />
PM: Well, it's just a waste a waste of time and a waste of money. I mean,<br />
the Senate is running around having inquiries they're a dime a dozen,<br />
a dime a dozen. There are very few countries around the world that<br />
produce Budget documents of this level of transparency. But there Is<br />
some sort of Implied notion that the Budget documents are not the<br />
Government's, you know, somehow they belong to the bureaucracy<br />
and that the Government Is sort of shop-soiling them. They've got the<br />
Treasurers name on them, every line In there belongs to the<br />
Government.<br />
FK: But given the whole thrust of the OpRqsiion's attack on your Budget as<br />
being the credibility of the figures and whether they are believable or<br />
not, wouldn't an Inquiry like this clear that up?<br />
PM: But that's what they said last year, that the Investment numbers were<br />
too high and the growth numbers were too high, and we doubled the<br />
Investment numbers and the growth numbers were exceeded by a<br />
quarter of a percentage point of GDP. I mean, these claims come<br />
every year but the notion that the Senate should go. you know, with a<br />
further, sort of, abuse of Its functions and wasting Its time and its<br />
money Into the Budget's preparation is only something to get, I'm<br />
afraid on this occasion, Senator Kemot a quick line in a newspaper.<br />
FK Well, Senator Kernot said that she will support your Budget ultimately,<br />
the bottom line of your Budget. If her job Is as they see It, and many of<br />
the people see it, Is to keep the bastards honest, why not give an<br />
Inquiry and that will show * that you're there to be kept honest, and<br />
you're willing to be kept honest? </p>
<p>TEL: 11. M1ay. 95 0: 07 No. 004 P. 02/<br />

PM: But this Is the Executive Government of Australia, we won the election,<br />
not the Democrats. For my part, I've presented eight Budgets and<br />
seven May Statements and the Treasurers presented now two, and<br />
you already had a note from the Secretary to the Treasury saying that<br />
the forecasts were the Treasurys exclusively the rest of the<br />
documents are the Government's, so it's not a matter, so what's she<br />
trying to establish? Are these the Government's documents or are<br />
they not? Well, they are, I can tell her.<br />
FK Prime Minister, just before you go, we've just seen the latest<br />
4nempLoyment figure, it's down .4 to 8.3 what's your response to<br />
tIatTPM: Well, at the time of the election It was 10.5 per cent it's the largest fall<br />
In unemployment we've seen since we've been keeping the records. It<br />
means that the Government has kept faith with the unemployed and it's<br />
kept its fidelity to its principal commitment In the election campaign -to<br />
restart growth and to get unemployment down. And, this gives the lie<br />
to the John Howard line that there was only five minutes of sunshine.<br />
We've now had three years of growth, the Treasury Is saying we've got<br />
three sustainable years coming up and you can see in today's<br />
numbers how could there be simply five minutes of sunshine with<br />
tremendous employment growth like this? It leaves Mr Howard without<br />
a feather tofy'th<br />
FK Should you be preparing to revise your Budget forecast already which<br />
13 only 8 per cent for the year?<br />
PM: No, we're saying 8 per cent for the year, It's a conservative estimate,<br />
but again if we can drop unemployment from 10.5 per cent to 8 per<br />
cent over the course of this three year period, it will be the biggest fall<br />
we've ever recorded. Now, the participation rate jumps around but I<br />
think in these numbers, about 90,000 job growth for the month, as I<br />
said, the Australian people should be very happy with this. But I make<br />
the political point, it leaves John Howard without a feather to fly with.<br />
FK Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
