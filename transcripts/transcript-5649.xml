PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT SUNDAY, 13 SEPTEMBER 1981<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MICHELLE GRATTAN, PAUL KELLY CHOGM<br />
Question The indications so far have been that CHOGM will be fairly<br />
disruptive for Melbourne. What action are you taking to<br />
minimise this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have had a number of discussions with LIndsay TThompson. A<br />
couple of days ago we both had a discussion with Chief Commissioner<br />
Miller and he'll be having a press conference. We are going to<br />
take out advertisements in the papers to explain what is<br />
happening and why the roads have to be shut off. The security<br />
requirements are important-. We all had a warning and a fright<br />
with what happened at the Hilton. Innocent bystanders on that<br />
occasion were killed or seriously injured and it is not just a<br />
question of protection for the Heads of Government, it is also a<br />
question of crotection of other people who could be caught up in<br />
a by product of an incident. It is unfortunate that security advisers<br />
say that at certain times roads do need to be shut off and one of<br />
the reasons for this of course, is because the route is<br />
predictable nd the time is predictable when people will be.<br />
travelling :) yer it, from the hotels to the conference centre,<br />
from the hctels to the opening of the Melbourne Town Ha] 1L. -It is<br />
i.. hen there is a predictable movement that you have a heightened<br />
seotriby dagrer. If somebody was trying to plan or do something<br />
they would he able to know within a fairly narrow time frame<br />
where somebody would be in certain circumstances. The car<br />
parking is going to be either prohibited or very severely limited<br />
Ln certain areas and along certain streets and again for<br />
security reasons. It is ' the easiest thing in the world to<br />
have a bomb with a remote control detonator in a car or<br />
somebody standing a couple of hunde): ds yards away with a detonator<br />
in their pocket and pressing it as some particular person goes<br />
past. You just can't take those kinds of risks. But what<br />
the Chief Commissioner will be seeking to do, what we will<br />
want to make sure is that where there is obstruction to<br />
traffic the roads are shut off so that people will know any and so<br />
they can make arrangements accordingly. Lindsay Thompson<br />
and myself have emphasised that we both want the minimum<br />
disruption to the people in Me]. bourne. If they know what is<br />
happening and why it is happening, then I believe it 
understood. A trial came I think without warning the other<br />
day and the intention is to publish maps of routes that wil<br />
shut off, showing the times and all the rest.<br />
Question This will be just newspapers, there will be no TV or radio? / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
I have suggested there should be something on television and<br />
radio also and I am hoping to report in the next day or two<br />
what in fact is planned.<br />
Question Suggested to the Victorian Government?<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
No, I have suggested it to our own people. This is an expense<br />
which is part of the CHOGM expenses unfortunately.<br />
Question What about the overall cost. There have been some criticisms<br />
that is it is unnecessarily lavish. What is the all-up cost?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, the costs are prettly much as have been indicated, but there<br />
is about $ 4 million worth of cost which is furniture, equipment,<br />
carpets, which will be used by the Commonwealth and....<br />
Question By the Federal Government.<br />
Prime Miniser<br />
By the Federal Government in the normal course of events, if you<br />
like, it is ordering a bit earlier than we otherwise would,<br />
but is is nzt lost to us. The desks are the desks that would go<br />
into Commonwealth store and we would use when there is a<br />
Commonweal-h requirement and there is a continued requirement<br />
for these sort of things.<br />
Question What do you reckon the total cost is?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You see the security equipment is going to be of great value and<br />
of continuing value. A large part of the cost is overtime<br />
for the Victorian police and that goes into millions of dollars.<br />
The total coqt I think, depending on how you treat the re-usable<br />
items, is around about $ 12 million. The cost is high, but<br />
that, and a major part of that, is security and I don't believe: that<br />
security can or shoifdl be compromised and cetainly a very<br />
great effort is is being taken to do everthing that can be donO.<br />
that area. But I really think that this in a sense is the<br />
wrong way of getting at this particular conference. I wanted<br />
to make the points about, or saying what it is about. I wanted<br />
to make the points about inconvenience to Melbourne because<br />
I want the citizens of Melbourne to understand. Then, theimportant<br />
thing is what Aoes this conference mean to Australia<br />
and why is the conference in Australia? We believe the<br />
Commonwealth Association is an important one and we also believe / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I think there are two, maybe three major reasons why the<br />
conference is important to us. We live in a very dangerous and<br />
unsettled world and while we cannot have any undue feelings abou~ t<br />
what Australia, or even the Commonwealth acting together, can<br />
achieve we all have an obligation to do what we can to<br />
make the world a safer place, a more secure place and if anyone<br />
doubts the need for that just look as I have said on many<br />
occasions at the War Memorials in this city or capitals, or<br />
any Australain country town and there you wi'll find thousands<br />
of names on honour rolls, testimony to the fact that the world<br />
was not a safe enough place on some earlier occasions. Even<br />
if what we as one country can add. in some small measure,<br />
to making the world safer, then we ought to, we have an<br />
obligation to and certainly an obligation to our children.<br />
The second major reason we try and make progtess in the<br />
north-south economic issues can be described in moral and<br />
humanitarian terms, but the practical pragmatic terms of politics.<br />
We are all going to be better off if poverty in the world can be<br />
diminshed and when 800 million people live on less than $ A200<br />
a year, that emphasises I think, in stark terms the extent<br />
of world poverty and the fact that hundreds of millions of<br />
people live without any of the servicws which every Austrlaian would<br />
take for granted, whether it is basic education -or whether<br />
it is basic he-alth services, access to hospitals, the kind<br />
of community support which people in this country accept and<br />
take totally for granted. It is not a question I believe of<br />
cutting up productive wealth of the world differently. I<br />
believe it is a auestion of making a more productive world so<br />
that more peo-DLe can establish themselves in a reasonable life<br />
and a reasorirll_-) e future and the Commonwealth can certainly<br />
contribute.-D that. The Australian interest in this comes<br />
this is ob-hciusl-related also to making it more secure world and<br />
a iire-.-peac-ui one, but it is also related to making it a<br />
world where -;-ere will be more trade, we will be buying more from<br />
other peopl--and they will be buying more from us and so<br />
there is a v. ery real self-interest in assisting in the economic<br />
take-off or' a larger part of the world's population. I ' think<br />
the reason wl-y the Cormmonwealth meeting is important is: -to<br />
, provide a forum for a large number of the very small states,<br />
* island states, so that their views,-their aspirations can be heard<br />
in a world fLorum. A large number of them cannot even afford<br />
adequate international representation, cannot afford to be<br />
represented at the Untied Nations, so how are they to make<br />
their influence felt? This is particularly important with<br />
a Commonwealth Conference taking place in Australia at the<br />
edge of the Pacific where there are probably more of<br />
these very small staes than anywhere else.<br />
Question I wonder if we could look at some of these particular points<br />
now. Prime Minister<br />
Could I come baci-k to the other question I-wanted to-make, you<br />
know why in Australia? I will say why I -think it is important<br />
to Australi. a, but why is the Conference itself in Australia.<br />
In a very real sense it was quite simply Australia's turn.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
It was mentioned, not in the sense of deserving to have it,<br />
so much as in the sense of having an obligation to provide<br />
the forum. The Conference has been in Singapore, in Africa<br />
last time, the in the Caribbean Kingston Candad, Britain,<br />
they are the most recent conference. And therefore where was it.<br />
next to go? It would not be going to Africa again, it could<br />
have been India perhaps, it could hav,. e ' been Australia, well<br />
SAustralia was chosen. There are a limited number of Commonwealt~ h<br />
countries with the capacity to mount the Conference. Obviously<br />
quite a significant number can, but a number of the very small<br />
countries cannot. The very fact -that it costs a great deal puts:<br />
it beyond the capacity of a number of countries and therefore<br />
if Australia believes seriously in the Commonwealth connection,<br />
and if we believe seriously in the issues that I have spoken about<br />
we need to try and make it a more secure world, then in a sense<br />
we have an obligation to provide a forum and to do it as well<br />
as we can.<br />
Question Let's look at some of the part icular items. As far as Namibia cjoes,<br />
is there s-cpe for Commonwealth diplomatic initiative here?<br />
Prime Minist.<br />
Not the kirnd of initiative that was taken over Zimbabwe which was<br />
very much a Commonwealth problem, a Britain/ Rhodesian issue.<br />
That was not in the United Nations forum in the way Namibia is<br />
very much the United Nations forum. I have got no doubt that<br />
the Heads Government will be wanting a report from the<br />
contact n1, Britain and Canada, are part of the contact<br />
group, and whtprogress is being made, and what progress is in<br />
prospect. I was in the United States, Canada, and Britain<br />
recently, I :-L-essed the need for progress. I think it is<br />
agreed by all people that there must be and I think it-is<br />
also agreed that South Africa must not be allowed to continue<br />
ito frustrate progress towalrds a settlmen-t. Now what specific<br />
action the Commonwealth might want to take, what we might<br />
want to say on it, will obviously depend very much on the position<br />
at the time, whether it is possible to demonstrate progress and<br />
to show that there is some significant movement. But if not,<br />
if it apears to be a stalemate at the Conference, then I would<br />
believe that there would be a number of people who would want<br />
to express fairly firm and rugged views about it and I think<br />
the Commonwealth should.<br />
Question It is possible that:, there could be Commonwealth representations<br />
to South Africa?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I suppose in a sense anything is possible, but I would not<br />
, vant to -try and pre-empt: w. hat the Comtonwalth might decide,<br />
but then you have got toi remember also that I have got a role as<br />
Chairman anid a number of Commonwealth countries are ' much </p>
<p>5<br />
closer to the Namibian issue than Australia is, and a number of<br />
them might have have some very firm views about what ourght to<br />
be done, but Ithink that will all be governed and determined<br />
by what reports would be given of progress made up to this point..<br />
As I see it, the progress is fairly minimal.<br />
Question Are you disappointed in the United States,' attiude on the<br />
South AFrican invasion of Angola?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the United States looks on it as a counter to other<br />
things, but it is the wrong way to settle the issues in Southern<br />
Africa. At the moment I bleive the United STates, or up to<br />
the moment, i believe the United STates has feld that privately<br />
it can exert pressure on South AFrica so that progress can be<br />
made. Now, if that is not successful, pressure miqht have<br />
to become public and more evident. This progress must be made;<br />
this is part of the philosophy of -what has happened in Zimbabwe.<br />
If there is no progress you get a threat to peace and if there is<br />
no progress in Namibia people who what independence will go<br />
wherever they can to get support for independence and that leads<br />
to the danger and the possibility of other countries being<br />
drawn in or. one side or another. And that is part of why it is<br />
so important to make progress in Zimbabwe.<br />
Quesiton Are you rca-c any representations to the United States at the<br />
moment? Prime Mini S.<br />
No, at the moment I think, well not beyond what I have already<br />
said when I was in Washington.<br />
Question Angola came after that.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, but the Commonwealth, well I was speaking then about<br />
Namibia, specifically. The Commonwealth Conference is taking place<br />
in a couple of weeks time and there is no doubt that this will be<br />
one of the issues of importance. There is one thing that I<br />
would like to say and have it plainly understood. I saw<br />
somewhere somebody said there could be embarrassment to<br />
Australia because the Commmonwealth might want to take a view<br />
different from that of the United States on these issues in<br />
relation to Namibia. Well, I am totally relaxed, I do not<br />
feel any eMbarrassemnt about that. The fact that a close<br />
working relationship has been established with the American<br />
administration and President Reagan does not mean that there<br />
is embarrassment to us if on a particular issue we take a different<br />
view. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Question Even if it means criticism of the Untied STates?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know that anyone is going to want to criticise anyone in<br />
particular over this particular issue, but I make the point in<br />
strong terms, we will take the view that we believe to be<br />
right. That was done over the issues in Zimbabwe, and there were<br />
some risks and dangers in relation to that, but it<br />
was done because we felt that there was no oher course<br />
that Australia could honourably or properly take and there<br />
was certainly no other course if there was going to be a<br />
resolution of the issue, or a peceful resolution of the issue.<br />
If the Commonwealth in a consensus way, wants to utter some<br />
rugged words, Canada and Britain ar6 both under contact with<br />
the United STates so there is a joint responsibility there<br />
for making progress, it is not just the United States' responsibility.<br />
Question Do you bZlieve the United STates will re-appraise its approach<br />
to South A.. ica as a result of Angola?<br />
Prime MInister<br />
SO many things in foreign policy are in a constant state of<br />
re-appraisal because it is an unfolding event, you are not in<br />
a static situation and if something like the incursions into<br />
Angola take: -lace, then clearly you have got to see how this<br />
affects other elements of policy. Now how the United STates<br />
sees it they will have to answer it for themselves. But if<br />
there is no evidence of progress, I would not be at all,<br />
surprised if the Commonwealth wants to take a pretty rugged<br />
, approach ot it. I would be expecting them to and would be<br />
surprised if they did not."<br />
Question On the question of Zimbabwe, you played a prominent part on<br />
the sett2eent there, are you now concerned at the introduction<br />
of communist advisers from Norther Korea and is there<br />
anything that Australia might be able to do about this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I understand this is. for a limited period. It is well worth<br />
noting, I think, that these advisers are not from Eastern Europe-..<br />
or countries under the influence of the Soviet Union. There<br />
are still British advisers. There are a number of Australians<br />
there as teachers and technicians and whatever. I was speaking to<br />
somebody the other day who has got family connections in Zimbabwe<br />
and his view was that th6re is a very high regard for wh-Ft Robert<br />
Mugabe is seeking to do and a high regard for what he has so far<br />
achieved in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>7<br />
Question Is there any possibility that Australian assiistancein the form of<br />
people on the ground to Zimbabwe will be stepped up?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There-is no proposal for that.<br />
Question ( inaudible) military assistance, that is?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Stepped up? there is no military assistance.<br />
Question Well introduced?<br />
Prime Min-ister<br />
At the moment there are British advisers and I saw the press reports<br />
about this. T just really have not got any comment to make<br />
about it. There has been no request, there is no proposal.<br />
Question Is this matter under active consideration by yourself?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not particuIarly, no.<br />
Question Do you the Cczrmonwealth Conference to re-write or extend into<br />
other areas the Gleneagles agrement? Strengthen, I -mean by<br />
re-writing.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I doubt it. It is reaffirmed, I would expect a number would<br />
want it reaffirmed. But even if it is. notreaffirmed it still<br />
stands as a document of continuing validity. There is one thing<br />
here that I would like to say about the attitude of heads of<br />
Government. We often get suggestions that the Commonwealth will<br />
be diverted from the things that people will regard as important<br />
by the in a sense side issues, however important those side<br />
issues might be. But Ithink that misunderstands the nature of the<br />
Commonwealth' involvment and the attitude of Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government who are at the meeting. They are all there<br />
giving up a week or., maybe two weeks of their time, some have<br />
long distances to travel, because they believe in the Commonwealth,<br />
because they believe in a consensus approach, because they want*<br />
to mtkae progress on certain issues. The issues will be the<br />
economic ones, Southern Afriacan issues. The economic ones<br />
breaking themselves up into a number of different sections. I<br />
mentioned also the question of small states and island states. </p>
<p>8<br />
But the Heads of Government are not, as I believe, going to<br />
allow or to want the conference to be taken over by issues<br />
however important they are, which might divert them from the<br />
major matters on which they want to make progress. I think<br />
that is sometimes misunderstood when people are commenting on<br />
what is or could happen at the Conference.<br />
Question But Prime Minister don't African consider sporting ties with<br />
South AFrica to be an important issue and in the light of<br />
the Springbok tour of New Zealand, won't they be seeking to<br />
raise this subject?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would not have necessarily thought so.<br />
Question What about private session?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A large nuLrbar of matters will be raised, but the agenda has been<br />
agreed and nobody has suggested that particular subject should<br />
be annotate-as a subject. There are subjects under which it<br />
cold be raise I. The South-African issues if you like, or<br />
human righ-: s issues which is under Commonwealth co-operation,<br />
but nobody, I'll have to check with the officials, but I don't<br />
think anyo:-=. has wanted that particular issue to be listed as<br />
an issue in -1-s own right, by itself. That again, just<br />
emphasises at i anm saying about the things that they want<br />
to make prc-ress on and believ e it is important to. That<br />
is not to say they don't feel strongly about sporting-.<br />
contacts with South Africa, of course they do and I think<br />
everyone should understan&amp; that. I have got friends, or know<br />
people, professional people, who are just out of university,<br />
who are working in South Africa and what is said about the<br />
stories, the attitudes, the rules in relation to apartheid.<br />
Whenyou hear about it first hand I think they would horrify<br />
overwhemingly the great majority of Australians. And these<br />
rules, discrimination continues as a matter of law in many<br />
cases and so the whole policy of apartheid is utterly<br />
repugnant. The Gleneagles AGreement is there. Everyone<br />
knows it was a consensus and the basis of consensus if<br />
you believe Zn it is that nobody can get the full-measure of<br />
what they might have wanted. They do recognise that there<br />
has to be some degree of compromise, as there was in the<br />
drafting of the Gleieagles Agreement itself. Whether there are<br />
attempts or not to redraft parts of that document, I don't know.<br />
I have not met any great wish to see that happen and when I<br />
was in London I met a number of Commonwealth Heads of Government,<br />
again the wish seemed to be to want to concentrate on the issue2s<br />
they are regarding as of major importance. There seems to be<br />
a view that Fraser want. the Conference to concentrate " on<br />
north-south economic issues. His wish is going to be diverted<br />
by this or by that. It is not Fraser's wish that the Conference<br />
is going to concentrate on these things, it is the Commonwealth's<br />
wish because there has been, as you know a great deal of / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
discussion with the Commonwealth leaders about are what are the<br />
important things, about what do you want on the agenda, how do<br />
you want it all handled. The emissaries that went around and<br />
spoke to people, they all put in their reports. So, when<br />
I say it is the north-south economic issues, these are matters<br />
which they feel passionately about and maybe again in this<br />
country we cannot understand why they feel so passionately<br />
about them, simply because we take so lany of the material<br />
things of life for granted, things which you know, are totally<br />
absent. Question I wonder if I could just tie up this area with a couple more<br />
questions. The Brisbane games, do you think these are<br />
likely to be discussed and do you think there could be<br />
some sort of boycott, even partial?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Are you talking about the games, or the mini games?<br />
Question The Commonwealth Games.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are scme trial games as you know happening in two or three<br />
weeks time. but they are not Commonwealth Games, there are<br />
people fro:' non-Comgionwealth countries going to those and<br />
that is something that has happened in the past?<br />
Question Is that going. to be boycotted?<br />
Prime MInister<br />
It is not a question of Commonwealth Games because there are<br />
quite a number of non-Commonwealth people going to it.<br />
Question But whatever they are, are they going to be boycotted?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
WEll, I have not got the list of who was asked and who has accepted,<br />
you can easily get that if you want to Michelle. The Brisbane<br />
games are in the hari6s of the Commonwealth Games FEderation.<br />
They have got meetings scheduled to discuss matters which you<br />
know have been concerning them and how they handle them, or<br />
how they want to handle it, I don't know. I think that meeting<br />
will take place after the CHOGM meeting. It may well be that<br />
some of them would want to talk to me about the Brisbane games<br />
and if they do, I would Ie very happy to do so. At the moment<br />
it is in the hands of the Federation. They have got a meeting<br />
scheduled which I think will be taking place shortly after the<br />
Heads of Government Meeting. </p>
<p>Question Do think inaudible)<br />
Prime MInister<br />
I don't want to make any comment about that/ that is in the<br />
hands of the FEderation itself.<br />
Question A related point, Charles Perkins, a deputy SEcretary of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs has said that black protesters in this country will<br />
stop the Brisbane GAmes. Are you concerned about this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't want to make any comment on what Charles Perkins has said.<br />
I think he has also said in recent times whether at the same time,<br />
that he has got quite a high regard for Commonwealth policies<br />
in the aboriginal area. I have noted that he is seeing the<br />
Head of the Department about his remarks. Of course, I will<br />
be seeing him on other matters later on this week ( Break in<br />
transmission) ANd when I have been going around the Northern<br />
Territory he has come with me and he has always been helpful,<br />
instructive, and I have adopted the practice, from time to time,<br />
of talking tc them quite directly about aspects of aboriginal<br />
policy so fa as the Commonwealth is concerned. He has been on<br />
the list to have that. discussion with me again and I would have<br />
done it now. if I had not been away over the last three weeks.<br />
You asked a -uestion, I am just making the point. I will be<br />
seeing about those issues and not about these particular<br />
comments. Ques tion<br />
Do you believe he should be censured for his remarks which<br />
' ppear to be a breach of public service regulations, or do<br />
you think there should be special rules for Charles Perkins?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, there are no special rules for anyone but he is senior head<br />
of the Department and I am not going to comment on it.<br />
Question Are you worriEd in general about the massive aboriginal<br />
demonstrations which are planned for the timeof CHOGM, and do<br />
think this matter will be raised by leaders with you informally,<br />
perhaps if not formally?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Tf anyone wants to raise it with me, I would be delighted if<br />
they do.<br />
Question Fathter Lini, I think, has said he will raise it with<br />
/ 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, I know Walter Lini quite well and he is a very sincere and<br />
well meaning person and rather than anyone have any doubts about<br />
policy, I would much sooner if they.. do have concerns I would<br />
sooner them raise the issues with me because while some people<br />
have tried to draw analogies between what happens in Australia<br />
Sand some other places, I think those analogies are quite so<br />
far fetched as to be ludicrous. And in Australia, if somebeody<br />
raises it, I will say, well for too long Australia did neglect<br />
aboriginal population, for too long we did not have policies<br />
that were adequately designed to assist, promote and encourage<br />
the well-being of aboriginal people. I have said this publicly<br />
before, over the last 20 years a great deal has been done,<br />
in particular over the last ten years an enormous amount has<br />
been done. Aboriginal people are not only eligible for all<br />
the programmes of educational health and welfare which are<br />
available to all other Australians, there are a whole range of<br />
special programmes in addition designed to respond to the<br />
very particular needs of aboriginal people. Like all significant<br />
human problems it is going to take some time to overcome.<br />
All the money in the world, and all the goodwill in the world<br />
could not solve this problem next month, week, next year, it is<br />
a problem that has to be worked at. There have been some very<br />
significant advances and I believe without any doubt, that<br />
overwhelmi ngly, if there are Heads of Government that want to<br />
ask me about this, that they will understand that. Many of<br />
them have puroo blems in their own countries which know are<br />
impractical, and difficult and not capable of solution in a<br />
short perio'd. What they would want to be concerned about, or<br />
if they raise it, we recognise that there is a problem,<br />
that we ar a " working at it and that we are devoting very<br />
considerable resources to it.<br />
Questions Prime Minister, on this particular point, one of the arguments<br />
of the critics is that that problems tend to be in states<br />
like Western Australia and Queensland where the attitudes of<br />
Sir Charles Court and Mr Bjelke-Petersen are very much opposed<br />
to aboriginal land rights, can you see the Commonwealth making<br />
any progress with these two states?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well again, I have heard people who are critics of some aspects<br />
of policy inithose areas say, for example of Queensland, that<br />
Queensland was amongst the first to claim aborignal health<br />
workers and that they have been very useful initiatives. People<br />
might be critical of" other aspects of policy, so you get a<br />
mixed situation, but at the same time people would understand<br />
the opportunities and the problems of working within a Federaion.<br />
A number of Commonwealth countries are themselves federations.<br />
Nigeria is a federation. Sometimes state Governments will take<br />
views that a Federal Government might prefer otherwise and<br />
Coimonwealth people woulc understand this and the Commonwealth<br />
paople would understand this. Again, many of them would experience<br />
the same kind of problems. Pierre Trudeau has some problems with </p>
<p>12<br />
a federation which are well known. It is not just a question,<br />
therefore, when power is divided of being able to wave a wand<br />
and pretend that power rested only in one place. I think the<br />
great objective I think we have is to advance the cause of<br />
the aboriginal people. It also needs to be understood that<br />
that is not going to be achieved by going to war with another<br />
administration because, however much people might like the<br />
Commonwealth to exert total constitutional power if that were<br />
to result in two administrations to be totally at war with<br />
each other over a particular issue, the aboriginal people would<br />
suffer as a consequence of that. I think that is not adequately<br />
understood sometimes out in the wider community.<br />
Question Does that mean you reject completely the Bill which Senator<br />
Ryan will put forward soon in the Senate?<br />
Prime MInister<br />
I have been away for three weeks and I have not even looked<br />
at Senator Rvan's Bill. No doubt the Minister would probably<br />
have some discussion in Cabinet on it, I will have to catch up<br />
on that. But it is a very important point. I think it is<br />
generally unierstood by aboriginal communities. With what<br />
Queensland is doing at the moment, it is not yet fully worked<br />
out. I think' people need to wait and see what really is in<br />
Queensland-s ind before jumping to conclusions about some of<br />
these thinc-s.<br />
Question<br />
On north-sc. th issues and Australia's record, is Cabinet likely<br />
to consider ? he car industry submissions before CHOGM and take<br />
any decisions?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
WEll, you would have to ask Sir Phillip what his timetable is.<br />
The car industry decision could not really be of enormous<br />
relevance to north-south issues. That is a question as to<br />
whether we are going to allow more European and Japanese<br />
imports into this country. The issues of more importance<br />
were the textiles matters that we decided a year ago where<br />
a larger part of the market is becoming open to imports<br />
as each year passes where we have introduced developing country<br />
preferences for the first time and I think we are the first<br />
country in tfie world to do so. On this particular issue,<br />
however much those who would like us to lower protection more<br />
and to lower protection on the developing countries more,<br />
I would ask those people to look at Australia's record and<br />
compare it with that of other industrialised countries, becausein<br />
per capital terms we buy more than most other developed<br />
countries, if not more than all of them of the sensitive goods,<br />
textiles, apparel and footwear. In general terms our purchase-s<br />
from developing countries are high and ASEAN, for example,<br />
are increasing their exports by nearly 40% a year for about<br />
ten years. .13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Question Do you thing you have played down somewhat the positive aspects<br />
of the textile decision in the way you announced it last year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the industry understood. If somebody wants to say to us<br />
a market should be more open, that is a legitimate thing for<br />
somebody with that point of view to say, but I don't think it<br />
is right for them to go on to say they should be more open<br />
because we have been so mean and miserable in the past about<br />
access to our markets because I do believe Australia is making<br />
progress. By comparison with other industrialised countries<br />
we have made great progress and in many areas our markets are<br />
far, far more open than are markets, as I would believe, in<br />
North America, or Europe or Japan.<br />
Question Except that view was disputed for example, by Mr ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, it was not at all. He has got a certain view, but I don't<br />
want to coirent on a public servant's view, but you cannot<br />
dispute the facts about dollars spent per capita.<br />
Question He suggested Australia had not matched its rhetoric.<br />
PRime Mini._<br />
But that is a 2fifferent question. I was saying that in terms<br />
Of access to -arkets developing countries do better in the<br />
Australian market than aLmost any other developed country.<br />
And the ficgures will show that, per capita purchases and<br />
percentage of market that is open to imports.<br />
Question But Mr Stone was arguing that our performance did not match our<br />
rhetoric when it comes to protection I am wondering whether you<br />
feel that such criticism from such a senior figure does<br />
undermine the thrust of your stand on this issue?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. Question The Governmenthas recently considered across the board cuts<br />
in protection and you have sent a reference to the IAC on this<br />
and quite a few of your ministers, such as Mr Anthony, have<br />
made comments recently about tariffs, do you believe that the<br />
Government will be in a position, and do you think there is<br />
scope for general reductions in protection levels?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
WEll if I could answer those questions I suppose we would not<br />
have sent a reference to the IAC. We sent a reference to get the!<br />
answer. / 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
Question Do you think there is much scope for change Prime Minsiter?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that is a matter for the IAC to do a report for us and<br />
then we will make a judgement on that, but I have always<br />
emphasised in this area two things, where it is possible protection<br />
should be lowered, but secondly, it should be gradual. There<br />
should not be undue disruption for Australian industry and that<br />
there should be time for adaption. We are not in the business,<br />
and this was clearly eveidenced in the textiles decision. of<br />
caulsing undue disruption to Australian and to Australians<br />
well-being. At the same time, we want to meet other<br />
obligations and make this a more efficient nation and to<br />
bnable us to concentrate on those thinas we can do best.<br />
Question Are you planning any way of handling the problem of the Irish<br />
hunger striker?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think if vo: have not read it, you should read the statement of<br />
the Catholi? Bishops. I would hope...<br />
Question I have rea' but he does not seem to have responded to it.<br />
Prime M inIs-<br />
NO he has not responded to it and if he is not prepared. to that,<br />
I don't supcose he would respond to anything that I have said,<br />
' or could sav'Ã¸ The probleMs of Northern Ireland are problems<br />
which tragic as they are, are ones for the British Government.<br />
They are not ones that we can get involved in. They are not ones<br />
that we have any intention of getting involved in. I think it<br />
is against the background of that remark we need to understand<br />
the thrust of the statement of the Catholic bishops.<br />
Question Have you been in t~ lephone contact over the last three weeks<br />
with any othqr Commonwealth leaders inaudible)?<br />
Prime MIniSter<br />
No. There has been a lot of conversation going on over the<br />
last six months and the discussions I had during* the period<br />
of the royal wedding were enormously helpful and the reports o: L<br />
the emissaries have been very helpful in helping to assess the<br />
frame of mind, the concerns of other Heads of Government.<br />
Question Are you confident that Pakistan will return to the Commonwealthl<br />
and if it does, does this mean that the Commonwealth is in a<br />
position to play more of a diplomatic role in that part of the<br />
world and in relation to Afghanastan? </p>
<p>15<br />
Prime Minist-cr<br />
I don't really think I could answer the last part of the question.<br />
I can't at the moment see how it will enable the commonwealth to<br />
be more active. The first part, I would have to say that would<br />
have to depend on discussions that take, place probably informally,<br />
or in a closed session during the Heads of Gpvernment meeting<br />
itself, you know the question of Pakistan's re-entry.<br />
Question Do we understand that India is quite happy to see Pakistan rejoin?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I can only say that India, as I understand it, is happy for the<br />
matter to be discussed, and nothing should be implied from that<br />
one way or the other about India.<br />
Question What is Australia's attitude to the proposal from Gambia for<br />
a committee to investigate breaches of human rights?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That will be discussed under the item Commonwealth co-operation?<br />
Question What is Ausralia's attitude to<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think we need to look at the proposal in detail, but ( inaudible)<br />
it is one of those issues where you are influenced by wh. at other<br />
Heads of Government say. On all of these things you don't go<br />
into the meetings with a fixed view, this is our view.<br />
Question There was some confusion about this while you were away.<br />
PRime Minister<br />
But thie practice of consensus means that you have to be able to<br />
take into account the views of other countries as they are expressed<br />
in the Conferpnce. You don't go in with just a fixed position<br />
unable to move. That is not a consensus operation. On that<br />
particular item I would be very happy to listen and to hear<br />
the views of other countries.<br />
Question Are we concerned at all that Mr Muldoon might push the iss-ue<br />
of human rights in other Commonwealth countries as he indicated<br />
a couple of months ago? ./ 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well I think we will just see what happens. Again, that is where<br />
the comment I made about the attitude of Commonwealth leaders<br />
to the Conference and what they have to achieve from it. Not<br />
just this Conference, any Commonwealth Conference, it is very<br />
important. There is no other Conference in the world where<br />
Heads of Government give up a week or two weeks of their time<br />
Coming from wealthy countries, from the least developed countries<br />
from nearly every continent, nearly every race, nearly every<br />
kind of background that you can imagine and they do so because<br />
they value the relationship. That is the reason I believe, they<br />
would not want to allow themselves to be diverted from the<br />
main things that they regard as important.<br />
Question<br />
We have just got a couple of questions to finish on. We would<br />
just like to ask you, you won't be surprised about this,<br />
whether you feel you have recovered over the last three weeks?<br />
Prime Minis-ter<br />
Totally, I think I probably recovered a week ago and therefore I<br />
much more e.&gt; oyed the last week.<br />
Question This is the third time you have been sick in recent years, is it.<br />
going to mea-that you will slow down a little bit?<br />
Prime Minis: r<br />
I read your civ-ce on that. Parts of it you maybe misunderstand<br />
because a ve'_-y large part of Cbinet discussions take place<br />
without me being present. Cabinet committees make finaldecisions<br />
no-always, but overwhelmingly and I am not part of<br />
those discussions.<br />
Question They don't do much while you are away.<br />
Prime Mi-nister<br />
Well, they are meant to. ( Inaudible) I don't think that is<br />
right. Question Will change your style at all?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
What is my style?<br />
Question To work very hard. / 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it is in my nature to work hard and I will probably go<br />
on doing it. Over the years there has been a quite steady<br />
process of evolution from the Prime Minister. You look at the<br />
Prime Minister's office five or six years ago. All the outriders<br />
have basically been moved out to other departments. I did<br />
quite deliberately. Other Prime Ministers ihsisted on keeping<br />
the National Gallery, maybe the Office of Womens Affairs<br />
attached the Prime Minister's Department and this did not<br />
make sense.<br />
Question But that is trivia, you have become more involved in the<br />
central ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have always been involved in the central ( inaudible), but if<br />
they are major matters I think the Prime Minister -must be<br />
involved. NOt necessarily involved in the fine details, but<br />
certainly involved in the broadthrusted policy of the Government. / 18 </p>
<p>Question: So, essentially, you won't be modifying the way you conduct yourself<br />
in the job?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I am not sure that your interpretation of the way things<br />
inaudible., past is necessarily right.<br />
Question: Well that is funny because my interpretation..<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If you are saying am I going to work hard * at the job,<br />
of course I am going to work hard at the job. It is an important<br />
one and the Prime Minister has got to be able to there does<br />
need to be a better understanding, as Mr Anthony said, and as<br />
I think Senator Baume might have said also, of the work'load<br />
on Ministers, and of the demands on Ministers, obviously<br />
the demands on a Prime Minister. It is a large country and<br />
with modern aircraft, people expect you to be all over the<br />
country and carry on with the business of administration at<br />
the same time. Probably over the years, the pressures on<br />
government ' nave grown with time. I would like to be able<br />
to reduce time Ministers either sit in Cabinet or in<br />
Cabinet mee: ings, for example, but a large part of that<br />
workload i~ s nerated by Ministers, who, if not the major<br />
part, to t. major part, by Ministers whno write submissions.<br />
Question: Do you t: r that -will be possible to reduce the time<br />
Ministers Zz:: end in Cabinet?<br />
Prime Minisz: er:<br />
I have as' e_ . ivy Department to Cabinet and Cabinet committees,<br />
sure I h'-ave asked my Department, the Cabinet office, to do a<br />
survey an.: Ai see what ways tmight be involved with achieving this.<br />
Question: When did you ask them to do that, PM?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
A few dlays ago.<br />
Question: How are they going to do that? Are they going to talk Ministers<br />
. inaudible?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think they will just analyse the nature of the work that cormes<br />
forward and see what suggestions or alternatives. But this has been<br />
done on more than one occasion, because of the pressure-of work,<br />
but by far the major patt of it is generated by the Departmnent~ s<br />
and by Ilinisters as well.<br />
Question: V1Then do you expect the result of this? </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Not before CHOGM.<br />
Question: Do you think it would be better if Ministers were spending<br />
less time in Cabinet and Cabinet committees, and more time<br />
outside, perhaps dealing with people and dealing with the<br />
electorate? Prime Minister:<br />
Well, there is not only that, but also being present in the<br />
Parliament. If a Minister goes out of Cabinet before a Cabinet<br />
committee, he has probably got people stacked up in his office,<br />
who he needs to see, who he has made appointments with to see,<br />
and it is important for people to be able to get around.<br />
It is important I believe for them to pay more attention<br />
to what happens in the Parliament.<br />
Question: And the electorate as well?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The wider con. rnity.<br />
Questicn: What m.: de you do this? Was it your illness?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No. Question: Coincidental? Prime Minister:<br />
In this particular year, we made the decision it was virtually<br />
the RCF exercise, and so the senior Ministers involved in that<br />
most of whom, w, e re also involved in the Budget Committee have had<br />
an enormously heavy burden. I think that and I haven't been on<br />
either of those committees, the Budget Committee or the RCF, but<br />
those Ministers have had an enormously heavy workload of<br />
Cabinet work and the RCF has the continued responsibility<br />
to oversight the impleme. ntation of those decisions. Now,<br />
we are not going to be doing another RCF exercise, so that won't<br />
there, but the workload has been very, very heavy indeed. I think<br />
that it will do good things if we can reduce the Cabinet time.<br />
I have spoken to other Ministers about that, the time that is<br />
being spent in Cabinet. One or two have even spoken to me about it.<br />
Question' 1<br />
When did they speak to you about, PM?<br />
-19 </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
I think I probably made one at inaudible... I have just been<br />
conscious of it, mostly through the RCF and the Budget exercise.<br />
Question: You are also planning to get Parliament fairly early this year,<br />
aren't you? Why is that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, there is not agreat deal of legislation drafted and one<br />
of the things that we want to make sure of is that we don't have<br />
the rush of legislation at the end of the session It is obviously<br />
particularly important with the Senate's composition, and it is<br />
obviously important to have legislation at the beginning of the<br />
session so that there can be matters for debate in one House or<br />
the other. That means setting firm timetables for the shutoff<br />
date of introduction of legislation and all the rest, and unless<br />
there are exceptional circumstances, the shutoff date for<br />
legislation into the Parliament is October 1.<br />
Question: When did you take that decision?<br />
Prime Minister;<br />
Some weeks aco.<br />
Question. So when you going to get up?<br />
Prime Mi. ister:<br />
I don't really. We will see what happens.<br />
Question: But you *. ill try and get up fairly early?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We will just see when, you know, inaudible free, but the<br />
requirements really are to make sure that the Parliament<br />
has an orderly programrme of business and that..<br />
Question: As opposed to last session?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Last session we lost a month because of by-olections, . r: d w<br />
also lost time because we had a number of very importait m: n. i: rs<br />
that had to be dealt with and had to be got right. You that,<br />
and you know what they were Transport, Health, and tlihc-' were otheand<br />
the RCF exercise itself. So, having the nature of that.<br />
programme as probably inevitable that we were going to lost:, time.<br />
But we are not going to have orderly programmes for the operation </p>
<p>-21<br />
Prime Minister:( cnt.)<br />
of Parliament unless we have cutoff dates for the introduction<br />
of legislation. Now, if you have got an emergency like the<br />
meat business, then obviously you have to do something about that<br />
and you can't stick to a rigid formula for that. You have got to<br />
have your exceptions, but for most legislation, that doesn't<br />
apply. Question: Can I just ask when you expect to take the Sinai decision?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Tony Street is going to the United Nations shortly. I doubt<br />
one of the reasons this was delayed as we have gone down the<br />
track there have been more threads that we have wanted to<br />
follow through. When I saw President Sadat, that left one or<br />
two things I wanted to follow through. We put one or two<br />
questions to the United States, not in any sense would we<br />
want to put any pressure on them in relation to it, but<br />
we are waiting at the moment for a response from them.<br />
If we haven't got it by the time Tony Street goes to<br />
Washington, he will be speaking to Secretary Haig there<br />
he has gct an apcointment arranged.<br />
Question: Do these related. things such as chain of command for the<br />
force and..<br />
Prime Mi: ister:<br />
No, they e a r e of matters and I don't want to go into<br />
the detal of it.<br />
Question: When did we put those questions to the United States?<br />
Prime Mini s: er:<br />
It has been a continuing process, you see.<br />
Question: When is Street going to be there?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
In a week's time or something. It is the annual United Nations....<br />
Question: So it is almost after CHOGM?<br />
Prime Ministeor:<br />
It could be. It would be wrong to write that it is imminent. S./ 22 </p>
<p>22-<br />
Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
We have offered the security thing and the Melbourne thing<br />
earlier, didn't we?<br />
Question: Yes. Prime Minister:<br />
There is ona other thing that I would like to say about our<br />
attitudes to this and it is something that I can't achieve<br />
by ourselves and it is something the Government can't achieve<br />
by itself. We not only have 40 heads of government coming to this<br />
country, we have some hundreds of people in the delegations,<br />
some of the delegations or one of them, I think, is up to about<br />
people..<br />
Question: the opposition.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, not in that '. ace, it is all officials and other Ministers.<br />
You ha-v also gcot, somebody said this morning, up to 800... end of tape </p>
