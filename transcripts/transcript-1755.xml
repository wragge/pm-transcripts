the free world and I look forward to close communication and<br />

and warmest good wishes as you assume the office of Prime<br />

is a very special one not only in our own area but abroad, and<br />
especially at the present time when we stand together in defence<br />
of freedom and democracy in Malaysia and South Viet Nam. We<br />
face common problems in respect of the South-East Asian area<br />
and the preservation of Commonwealth defence arrangements.<br />

development of the peoples of the South-West Pacific. The Free<br />
Trade Area Agreement has given the Trans -Tasman relationship<br />
a new dimension and we have every reason for ensuring that it<br />
proves beneficial to our two countries. We have both come to<br />
accept the necessity for the closest possible consultation and<br />
co-operation between us, particularly at the political level, but<br />
in many other contexts as well. I am sure that we shall find<br />
many occasions for acting together. I personally look forward<br />
to working as closely with you as I did with Robert Menzies and<br />
