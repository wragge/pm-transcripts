    <content><![CDATA[<p>New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police are currently responding to a reported hostage-taking incident in Martin Place in Sydney.</p>
<p>I have spoken with NSW Premier Mike Baird and offered him all possible Commonwealth support and assistance.</p>
<p>The National Security Committee of Cabinet has also convened for briefings on the situation.</p>
<p>This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner.</p>
<p>We will provide regular updates as further information becomes available.</p>
