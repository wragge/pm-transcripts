    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce an initial $10 million commitment to fund community based programs in HIV/AIDS, communicable diseases, water supply and sanitation and food security in Africa.  Funded programs will go ahead in Mozambique, South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Major activities of the Australian Partnership with African Communities Program include:</p>
<p> ï· food security, health and water supply programs in Kenya';s Rift Valley  ï· HIV/AIDS and food security program in Malawi</p>
<p>ï· food security, water supply and HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention program in Mozambique</p>
<p>  The program will boost the impact of community-based programs in reducing poverty and generating positive development outcomes in targeted countries in southern and eastern Africa.</p>
<p>Africa is facing enormous challenges in achieving stability, growth and poverty reduction.  The 2002-03 drought and continuing governance issues have exacerbated the situation - an estimated 15 million people are now considered to be at risk of starvation.  In addition, the HIV/AIDS epidemic now affects about 29 million people in Africa.  Australia remains committed to assisting Africa, providing approximately  $61.4 million in 2003-04.</p>
