E14BARGO: NOT TO B FUBLISHED, BROADCAST OR TELECAST BEFORE<br />

BROADCAST NO, 2 SENATE ELECTION<br />
BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROIERT MENZIES, OVER ABC NAIIONAL STATIONS<br />
IN ALL STATES AT 7.15 P. M. ON THURSDAY,<br />
26TH NOVEMBER, 1964<br />
The Labour Party has challenged the Government<br />
on Defence Policy. It has made it the issue in the Senate<br />
Election. So I ask: " What is the policy of the Labour Party<br />
on foreign policy and defence?"<br />
No Party can have a foreign policy or a defence<br />
policy unless it has certain basic ideas. Once these basic<br />
ideas are established, details of application will fall into<br />
pla ce. To be opposed to any form of compulsory service is<br />
not a Defence Policy, because it is negative. The Labour Party<br />
must go further. Briefly, let me lok at two crucial matters.<br />
The first is our relationship to our alliesi in<br />
ANZUS and SEATO. Under certain circumstances, we have treaty<br />
rights to secure their help. Rights, of course, involve<br />
obligations. We are bound to help if we want to be helped.<br />
We have forces in Thailand, in Malaysia, in South Vietnam,<br />
Why? Because eleven million Australians in the line of advance<br />
of aggressive Communist China cannot defend our country alone.<br />
We must have partners, and be active partners ourselves.<br />
What is Labour's basic policy on this great matter?<br />
Nobody knows. Their Left-Wingers growing in influence say<br />
that we ought not to have forces overseas, which means, if you<br />
think of it, that we ought to renounce our treaties.<br />
I know that moderate Labour men do not want so<br />
suicidal a policy. But will they prevail?<br />
After all, they ar, committed to the strange idea<br />
that nuclear weapons ought not to be brought into or used from<br />
the Southern Hemisphere an idea that would mean that America<br />
could not use nuclear weapons in our defence in a nuclear war<br />
while leaving the new nuclear power, Rod China, free to operate<br />
from North of the Equator.<br />
The other crucial matter is in reality involved in<br />
the first. Does the Labour Party have a garrison conception<br />
of Australian defence2 abandoning our idea of " defence in<br />
depth?" We believe in keeping the enemy as far away as<br />
possible, by strengthening those South-East Asian nations which<br />
are opposed to Communi,Ã± mo o / 2<br />

Only a few weeks ago, Dr. Cairns, who is the<br />
Opposition's most consistent spokesman on these matters,<br />
propounded, without dissent from his leaders, an astonishing<br />
proposition, He said " I think the general policy of containment<br />
is a sound policy, but the question is: dhere?<br />
I think here is where serious mistakes have been<br />
made. I do not think[, Droper consideration has beern<br />
given to where is the best strategic point to make<br />
this containment. I think as far as the Pacific is<br />
concerned it is clear that t; is somewhere along the<br />
52,500 mile line from Kamchatka north of Japan to<br />
say Darwin in the south and then to the east and the<br />
west. This is, I believe, the first line of defence<br />
in this policy of containment,,"<br />
If you look at the mapp you will see that this<br />
abandons the whole of South-East Aisia. It is the abandonment<br />
of defence in depth of our treaty obligations. It is pure<br />
isolationism. So I r-epeat: What is the policy of Labour?<br />
WLatever it is or may turn out to be, you are being asked by<br />
our opponents to vote for it on Decemiber </p>
