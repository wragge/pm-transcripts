PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
THE CRETAN ASSOCIATION OF SYDNEY AND NSW: BATTLE OF CRETE<br />
COMMEMORATION<br />
Fifty-two years ago, Greek and Commonwealth forces,<br />
including 6,500 Australians, fought to defend Crete from<br />
German invasion. Today, we remember the sacrifices made<br />
by Australians and Cretans in that bitterly fought<br />
campaign. Without heavy equipment or air support, exhausted from<br />
the campaign in Greece, the Allied troops in Crete<br />
nevertheless inflicted heavy casualities on the German<br />
forces. When resistance finally ceased, the people of<br />
Crete risked savage retaliation to help Allied soldiers<br />
evade capture. In the weeks following the battle, more<br />
than 300 Australians, aided by Cretans, succeeded in<br />
escaping. Hundreds of other Australians and New<br />
Zealanders were hidden by Cretans.<br />
Australians have not forgotten the courage of these<br />
Cretans. The ties forged in war have endured and grown. After IL<br />
World War Two, more than 250,000 Greeks, including many<br />
Cretans, migrated to Australia. They brought with them<br />
an ancient culture and a spirit of enterprise which has<br />
enriched Australian society immensely.<br />
Thus, when we remember today the sacrifices of 1941, we<br />
reaffirm the enduring ties between Australia and Crete,<br />
ties built on a common democratic heritage tested in war<br />
and peace.<br />
