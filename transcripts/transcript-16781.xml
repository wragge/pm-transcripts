    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced that 2010 will be designated ‘Year of the Girl Guide'.</p>
<p>For 100 years the Guiding movement has supported Australian girls to grow into confident and inspiring young women.</p>
<p>The Government acknowledges the invaluable contribution of Girl Guides Australia and will support the centenary through a range of initiatives.  </p>
<p>The Royal Australian Mint will produce a circulating one dollar coin to commemorate the Guides and their centenary year. The Reserve Bank of Australia will determine when the coin enters circulation.</p>
<p>Australia Post will issue three stamps, one domestic and two international, in September 2010.</p>
<p>The Government will provide $600,000 to help Girl Guides Australia celebrate the centenary year. This funding will support:</p>
<p>     * Girl Guides Centenary Launch, Brisbane, 4-6 September 2009.</p>
<p>     * Helping girls and young women from disadvantaged backgrounds participate in the launch.</p>
<p>     * Go Girl, a series of workshops about obesity. </p>
<p>     * World Environment Day activities that will help Guides work out their “Carbon Footprint” along with how to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>     * Australian Service Challenge, a disability focused service-wide project to help Guides understand what it means to have a disability. </p>
<p>The Government's announcements will not only benefit the Guiding movement but Australia as a whole.</p>
<p>The Guiding movement reaches out to thousands of Australian girls and young women each year and encourages them to actively involve themselves in matters of national and global concern. </p>
<p>From humble beginnings 100 years ago, the Girl Guides have grown into the largest worldwide voluntary organisation for girls and young women with an estimated 10 million members worldwide.</p>
<p>Over one million Australian women have been or are still Guides.</p>
<p>The motto for the centenary year is "Let's celebrate our past, live the present and power into the future”. </p>
<p>The program of activities planned by Girl Guides Australia will put this motto into practice and the Government is proud to be able to help.</p>
<p>The Centenary of Guiding will be celebrated around the world and celebrations in Australia will begin with the official launch from 4 to 6 September 2009 at Kindilan, Redland Bay, Queensland.</p>
