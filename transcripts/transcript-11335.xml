<p>Well, thank you very much Senator Minchin, to my other ministerial</p>
<p> and parliamentary colleagues. To Professor Stocker, to Martin Green</p>
<p> and Stuart Wenham the joint winners of the Australia Prize for 1999.</p>
<p> To Tim Besley who chaired the selection committee, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I do regard this as one of the occasions of the year and it's</p>
<p> an opportunity here in the National Capital in the Federal Parliament</p>
<p> to pay homage and pay our respects to and, very importantly, honour</p>
<p> people who have made a particular contribution to science. The connection</p>
<p> between Australian achievement and science is a very long and honourable</p>
<p> one. Names such as Eccles and Oliphant and Macfarlane Burnet and many</p>
<p> others come off the tongue. And the 1997 Australian of the Year, Dr</p>
<p> Peter Doherty, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology</p>
<p> called it, I think, very appropriately the enterprise in the adventure</p>
<p> of those people who dared to discover. And in a speech that he made</p>
<p> recently he described the special excitement of being involved in</p>
<p> discovering something in going somewhere where nobody had been before.</p>
<p> And I think that encapsulates the experience and the feelings of so</p>
<p> many people who have been involved in the discipline of science.</p>
<p>It is true that as a person trained in the law who has turned to politics,</p>
<p> I come ill-prepared in the sense of intellectual discipline for science.</p>
<p> But I have to say to you that one of the more stimulating and exciting</p>
<p> experiences I have had as Prime Minister is to chair several times</p>
<p> a year what is now called the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering</p>
<p> and Innovation Council. This is a body that brings together the best</p>
<p> and the brightest that Australia has in this field. And we sit around</p>
<p> the Cabinet table for a few hours, normally on a Friday morning, and</p>
<p> to me it's a great revelation, it's a reminder of the enormous</p>
<p> resources of intellectual power that Australia possesses in this area.</p>
<p> And it's also a reminder to me of how important science is for</p>
<p> the future of Australia.</p>
<p>And can I interpolate on a personal note how much I have valued the</p>
<p> work of the Chief Scientist of the Commonwealth, Dr Stocker, over</p>
<p> the last two-and-a-half years. He has been the Chief Executive Officer</p>
<p> of the Prime Minister's Council, he has interpreted much of what</p>
<p> has gone before that Council for me and he has helped me enjoy very,</p>
<p> very much the experience that has added to the stimulation that I</p>
<p> derive from the exposure to the magnificent work of the people who</p>
<p> make up that Council.</p>
<p>And I want to join Senator Minchin in paying tribute to his work as</p>
<p> the Chief Scientist, thanking him and wishing him well in his future</p>
<p> scientific and business career. He reminded me that this gathering</p>
<p> takes place at a very significant moment when a scientist has been</p>
<p> appointed only yesterday as the Chief Executive of Australia's</p>
<p> largest corporation Telstra. And, of course, as Peter Doherty again</p>
<p> reminded us recently Australia is probably the only nation on earth</p>
<p> that was discovered in the course of a scientific expedition.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, the two gentlemen that we are honouring</p>
<p> tonight for their work in photovoltaeics, Martin Green and Stuart</p>
<p> Wenham, have won world renowned in a field that all of us will acknowledge</p>
<p> is tremendously significant to our future. There is, I am assured,</p>
<p> no truth in the rumour that they were two members of that raiding</p>
<p> party at Kirribilli House some time 18 months ago but was endeavouring</p>
<p> to press upon me certain views about solar energy. But what they have</p>
<p> succeeded in doing is to win world renowned and world respect in a</p>
<p> field of endeavour where the research had lain stagnant for a period</p>
<p> of some 10 or 15 years. And as you saw in that excellent video their</p>
<p> contribution is world class, their achievements have earned great</p>
<p> respect for them personally, they reflect very favourably on the University</p>
<p> of New South Wales and the support and cooperation of that University.</p>
<p> And I notice I think in the audience tonight the current and at least</p>
<p> one former Vice Chancellor of that University. And the contribution</p>
<p> of their research teams should also be honoured and I know when they</p>
<p> speak they will have something to say about it.</p>
<p>But it is to me as Prime Minister of Australia a source of immense</p>
<p> pride and I know for all Australians that we find within our 18 plus</p>
<p> million people, people of such continuing excellence in areas of science.</p>
<p> There is, of course, enormous potential for the field of research</p>
<p> in which Martin and Stuart have been involved. The potential for Australia</p>
<p> is immense, the potential revenue to be earned, the important commercial</p>
<p> as well as scientific contribution that both of them have made is</p>
<p> something that we honour here tonight. And it is important as we honour</p>
<p> their contribution that we recognise the important linkages between</p>
<p> the pure research and also the commercial utilisation of that research.</p>
<p> And one of the things that we have been able to do with some success</p>
<p> in Australia is to bring those two together.</p>
<p>But it is important that the Government ensure that all of the policies</p>
<p> that bear on the successful protection as well as the development</p>
<p> of Australia's intellectual capital that all of those policies</p>
<p> that come to bear on that intellectual capital be kept constantly</p>
<p> under review. And one of the valuable things that have come out of</p>
<p> the meetings of the Prime Minister's Science Council is a reminder</p>
<p> to me and to my ministerial colleagues of how precious is Australia's</p>
<p> intellectual capital, of how the care and the nurture and the protection</p>
<p> all over the world of the intellectual property of Australia is a</p>
<p> special challenge. And it will be an even greater challenge as we</p>
<p> move into the 21st Century. It has become clich, of course,</p>
<p> to talk about knowledge-based industries, it has become a clich  to</p>
<p> talk about how important is knowledge-based employment. But as we</p>
<p> move into the 21st Century it will become even more important</p>
<p> and it will become even more incumbent upon governments to ensure</p>
<p> that the intellectual property of the Australian nation is fully protected.</p>
<p>In awarding jointly the Australia Prize tonight to Professor Green</p>
<p> and to Professor Wenham I am inviting them to join a very significant,</p>
<p> a very distinguished list of great Australians who have made a particular,</p>
<p> indeed an outstanding contribution to the field of science. They have</p>
<p> brought great dignity, they have brought great prestige and great</p>
<p> esteem to their own chosen discipline, they have been champions in</p>
<p> that discipline and most importantly of all they have made all of</p>
<p> this field even prouder still to be Australians. They have been great</p>
<p> and outstanding Australians. I congratulate both of them, I compliment</p>
<p> their research teams and I invite both of them to come forward to</p>
<p> accept their presentations. Thank you.</p>
