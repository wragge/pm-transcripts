SPEECH FOR THE NATIONAL SUPERANNUATION EDUCATION<br />
CAMPAIGN LAUNCH, BERLEI FACTORY, RYDALMERE, SYDNEY<br />
8 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you indeed Paul ( Elliott), Lord Mayor, Jennie George, Richard Glass,<br />
the Managing Director of Berlei, and Berlei executives, and members of the<br />
work force, workers here at the Berlei factory, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It's a great pleasure to be here today, to be party to the launching of this<br />
campaign to provide information to Australians about superannuation. Award<br />
superannuation is one of the great undertakings of th6 isfdecade, and it is<br />
now starting to blossom as a result of the Budget measures we announced<br />
just a few months ago. It will be such that by 2002 which is not far away<br />
every Australian working person will have 15% of their income going on their<br />
account into a superannuation fund into a superannuation account for them.<br />
What this will mean is when they retire, someone joining the work force will<br />
retire on what is now twice the age pension, someone who is in the work<br />
force already in their 30s perhaps will retire on about three-quarters of the<br />
age pension, plus the age pension. So, it's going to mean a dramatic lift in<br />
the standard of living of Australians in retirement, and, of course, put together<br />
a huge pool of national savings, which can make a country stronger, which<br />
means we will rely less ' dhV6Yverseas savings and overseas debt, and which<br />
means we can power along investment and employmnent and exports. So,<br />
this is a scheme that came from firstly, a lot of iriiagination, and belief in the<br />
fact that Australian working people would put some of their income away as<br />
savings for their long run retirement. And because they would be prepared to<br />
do that, the Government would also be prepared to put income away, by way<br />
of the tax concessions and direct payment, paying the tax cuts into<br />
superannuation accounts. So as a consequence, we are going to see as<br />
they say a very large pool of savings develop on behalf of each and every<br />
person. To give an example, someone on average weekly earnings now that's<br />
someone on about $ 32-33,000 when they retire, they will retire on a lump </p>
<p>sum just under half a million dollars. And someone on one and a half times<br />
weekly earnings, will retire on a lump sum of over $ 600,000. And this will<br />
produce an income stream in retirement which will guarantee them a much<br />
higher standard of living than they have today.<br />
You don't need to be a demographer to know that the Australian community is<br />
aging. When my generation moves through to retirement, there will twice as<br />
many retired aged people as there are today. And we will be relying upon the<br />
people-the-n in ihelvork force to provide the standard of living in retirement<br />
most of us have come to expect but there will be twice as many of us. So,<br />
this Government, back in the 1980s with the ACTU saw the opportunity to<br />
start to move towards some sort of national contributory scheme for all<br />
workers, not just people in the public se~ f&amp; o0-r somfe p-rivate cdTpanies, but<br />
for all workers where something was put away by employers on their behalf in<br />
lieu of wages. Some of the Accords we did in the 1 980s with the ACTU were<br />
built on claiming less in cash at the time to allow something to go away in<br />
savings for the future. And that's now up to around it will be 9% in 3 or 4<br />
years from now, and then to that we add the Budqet contributions of this year,<br />
3% tax cuts paid as super, and 3% from employees themselves, so the 9%<br />
becomes 15% 9 plus 3 plus 3. And what it will mean is that we will see a<br />
huge lift in national savings. A decade ago we had about $ 40 billion in super<br />
funds. This year we have got $ 180 billion, and in the year 2020 when this<br />
scheme is fully mature and up and running, we think we will have $ 2 trillion<br />
that is 2 thousand billion dollars in superannuation fund assets. And people<br />
talk about our national debt, and ttiat is an issue. But our national debt is<br />
$ 160 billion we have already got $ 180 billion in super fund ass-ets thit year.<br />
And we are going to have something like 2 thousand billion dollars, as I say,<br />
in about 2020, or one thousand billion by the year 2000 not so many years<br />
away. So, this is a mighty change. This is something most countries would like to<br />
see their Governments do with their work forces. And this has been done by<br />
a Labor Government with the work force, through the Accord. And it's not<br />
been done bytax concessions to high income tax payers it's been done by<br />
the fair and equitable way of this being allowed to go, these tax concessions<br />
being widely available to all working Australians.<br />
One of the things that I am most particularly pleased about, and that is the<br />
support which super has given to women. Jennie already made reference to<br />
that, and she has been herself a great stickler and supporter of this<br />
advantage coming through to Australian women. You know that the pattern<br />
of Australian female employment has been in respect of super that wherever<br />
a person was actually lucky enough to have a superannuation fund, a woman<br />
would have that tallying up for her. But if she left work to have a family, it<br />
would then be either paid out as a lump sum and finished and terminated,<br />
and mostly what she would get would be her contributions back and that<br />
was the end of it. And if she happened to come into the work force later, she<br />
could try and pick something up afresh from a cold start, but there was no<br />
continuity. Now, there's preservation to age 55. Now, every one every<br />
working woman will have a benefit in superannuation. And in the case, say, </p>
<p>of somebody going off to have a family, those earnings will continue to accrue<br />
and will be there if and when that woman comes back into the work force.<br />
And that will then grow and compound to age 55 under the tax concessions.<br />
So, what we call preservation investing will be there for Australian women to<br />
give them that support in their own name in their own right at a later stage<br />
in their life. And this is, I think, an important social milestone, and a good<br />
thing we have been able to do together.<br />
So, there is a lot in this for the country, there's a lot in this for our future. We<br />
need investment to get employment. But this is a big continent. The projects<br />
that are growing all the time in this country as such that it is more than our<br />
current national savings can afford, so therefore we put the call on overseas<br />
savings or overseas debt. And this is where the current account and the debt<br />
comes from. To deal with it, we need to do some things, like adding to our<br />
national savings, like superannuation. We also need to do some things like<br />
putting the Budget into surplus, which the Government has done. So you<br />
have got public saving on the one hand, and you have got private saving with<br />
superannuation on the other. These are the ways in the long term how we<br />
will deal with our debt. Not some imagined productivity commission, or some<br />
bit of economic fairy floss that wouldn't travel a yard under real scrutiny, but a<br />
real national scheme, where the huge force the economic force of that<br />
wealth going in 15% for everybody, every week, into the future. It will mean<br />
a much greater pool of savings, higher levels on investment, therefore higher<br />
levels of growth and employment, higher* levels of exports giving Australia<br />
that sort of savings advantage it's never really had in the past. And, as we<br />
say, that standard of living in retirement.<br />
One of the issues in the United States at the moment as they say, one of the<br />
concerns of Middle America is that many Americans believe that they won't<br />
be provided for in old age. They won't be provided for because they know<br />
there will be many more retired aged people when the baby boom generation<br />
retires than is the case today, and they don't think the tax system, or the<br />
public system, will keep income support up to them. Well, in this country, a<br />
Labor Government thought about all that a decade ago, so that when we get<br />
to that position, you will have people basically on twice the aged pension. So<br />
someone on average weekly earn2injgs just before they retire will actually<br />
retire on an income the same as'average weekly earnings. They will go out<br />
on average weekly earnings, and their pension plus super will add up to<br />
about the same amount. And then that will improve to a point, and then it<br />
drops away, because it is there to support the great bulk of the work force.<br />
So, it's a great change this is a great national scheme. It certainty is, in<br />
financial terms, the greatest private savings arrangement that Australia has<br />
ever had, and by launching this pr6gram today, we are trying to tell people<br />
about it to involve them with it, to give them some confidence that the system<br />
is going to be managed well for them, and that it is going to do good things.<br />
I was particularly pleased to be at Berlei here today, and glad of the<br />
information which Richard and his colleagues were able to give me about the<br />
clothing and textile industry. Because when we started on the big reforms in<br />
clothing and textile 10 years ago, people were talking doom and gloom " that </p>
<p>will be the end of TCF, it will be finished, there is no way we will be able to<br />
compete with people abroad, we won't be able to make high quality<br />
sophisticated things, we will simply be deluged with imports". Now, by again<br />
taking the initiative and having that imagination and belief in Australians and<br />
this industry that it could do better, we are seeing today a modern clothing<br />
industry in Australia, which is not only providing products for this market, but<br />
it is also providing for exports as well.<br />
But the other thing that I thought was interesting about Berlei, was that the<br />
building and the land was owned by the State Superan -nuation Board, and it<br />
makes the point that here is this wonderful fe-iiniic1 -capacity her-t6 produce<br />
a high quality garment, coming out of one of Australia's most committed firms<br />
in this industry, in facilities which are owned by a superannuation fund. And<br />
we are going to see more and more of this all around the country as your<br />
savings will be placed in Australian industry and we will continue to see a<br />
growth in the nature of the stock market, and a maturation where we start<br />
seeing the stock and the investment industry actually supporting the<br />
innovative companies, and we will be seeing a pool of savings needed to be<br />
placed, to actually help all that along. I think this is a very encouraging and<br />
exciting prospect.<br />
So, I would like to, today, thank many people for their commitment to this<br />
great national initiative to our colleague partners in the ACTU, represented<br />
by Jennie George, to all those people in the work force who believed in<br />
something better, in putting something away for tomorrow, to the industry we<br />
have now got to build, to the investment industry who have to now meet the<br />
challenge of what the Government has created, and to all those Australians<br />
who know there can be something better out there in the future. We hope<br />
that this campaign will answer some of those questions what is super? what<br />
are my entitlements? how can I take my money? what is the Government<br />
going to contribute? is the money going to be safe etc? what am I likely to<br />
retire on? These are the questions that we know Australians want answers<br />
to, this campaign is about opening up some of those opportunities to provide<br />
them with those answers. I thank Paul Elliott for being involved with<br />
the having the stewardship of this campaign, iifor those involved with it, I<br />
am very happy today to be here today to officially launch it. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
