<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Multicultural Affairs Senator Kate Lundy have congratulated Sir James Gobbo for being awarded the Australian Migration and Settlement Lifetime Achievement Award at the inaugural Australian Migration and Settlement Awards.</p>
<p>The awards, which are presented by the Migration Council of Australia, recognize finalists from around the country who are exemplary in their commitment to providing world-class services to migrants.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government congratulates the Migration Council Australia for showcasing the dedication of community organisations and individuals, who work tirelessly to assist new migrants to settle, feel included in communities and participate in the workplace.</p>
<p>The awards show that Australians are making real differences to settlement experiences, and this support is vitally important to assist new migrants to navigate the path in establishing a new life in their adopted country.</p>
<p>The major award, presented to Sir James, former chairman of both the Australian Multicultural Foundation and Council of Multicultural Affairs, is in recognition of Sir James' ongoing commitment to Italian community affairs in areas of welfare, language teaching, oral history and care of the aged. </p>
<p>Other winners at the awards include:</p>

 * 	Journalism Excellence Category  -  Back to Where You Came From Series 2 (Nick Murray)<br />
 * 	Diversity and the Law Category  -  Legal Services Commission of South Australia for the Migrant Information Legal Education (MILE)</p>
<p>These awards are taking place during Harmony Week, which culminates this Thursday on Harmony Day.</p>
<p>This year's theme for Harmony Day is Many Stories  -  One Australia, which recognises that by sharing our stories we can foster a sense of belonging, acceptance and understanding of other cultures.</p>
<p>The Migration Council Australia was launched on 1 August 2012, and is a nationally recognised policy and advocacy not-for-profit organisation, seeking to bring together corporate Australia and the settlement sector to enhance the productive benefits of Australia's migration and humanitarian programs.</p>
