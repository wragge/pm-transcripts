    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>13 October 1989</strong><br /><br />All general practitioners in Australia will receive a pamphlet on domestic violence in the next week to assist them to help victims of violence.</p>
<p>The pamphlet, produced as part of the National Domestic violence Education Program, has been issued jointly by the office of the Status of women and the Australian Medical Association.</p>
<p>The Government, which has a strong and continuing commitment  to community education on domestic violence, and the AMA are pleased to be cooperating to make domestic violence a high priority for doctors and look forward to further cooperation in the area.</p>
<p>The widespread and deep-rooted problem of domestic violence in the Australian community is a matter for national concern. Many of the women who suffer domestic violence keep silent even to their doctor about the cause of their injuries.</p>
<p>This pamphlet contains the basic facts and crisis information on domestic violence. It will assist doctors to help victims of violence.</p>
<p><br />Bob Hawke<br />Dr Bryce Phillips<br /> </p>
