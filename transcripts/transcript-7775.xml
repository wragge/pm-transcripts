    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>13 OctoberÂ 1989</strong><br /><br />All general practitioners in Australia will receive aÂ pamphlet on domestic violence in the next week to assistÂ them to help victims of violence.</p>
<p>The pamphlet, produced as part of the National DomesticÂ violence Education Program, has been issued jointly by theÂ office of the Status of women and the Australian MedicalÂ Association.</p>
<p>The Government, which has a strong and continuing commitment Â to community education on domestic violence, and the AMA areÂ pleased to be cooperating to make domestic violence a highÂ priority for doctors and look forward to further cooperationÂ in the area.</p>
<p>The widespread and deep-rooted problem of domestic violenceÂ in the Australian community is a matter for nationalÂ concern. Many of the women who suffer domestic violenceÂ keep silent even to their doctor about the cause of theirÂ injuries.</p>
<p>This pamphlet contains the basic facts and crisisÂ information on domestic violence. It will assist doctors toÂ help victims of violence.</p>
<p><br />Bob Hawke<br />Dr Bryce Phillips<br />Â </p>
