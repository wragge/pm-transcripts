SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
EXPANDING HORIZONS AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA<br />
INTO THE 21 ST CENTURY, JAKARTA, 29 JUNE 1994<br />
Let me say how pleased I am to be here at the opening of this historic event,<br />
and I welcome you all.<br />
Three months ago I launched the Australia Today Indonesia 94 program in<br />
Sydney.<br />
Today we launch the centrepiece of the program this trade. and Investment<br />
forum which in time may well be seen as a turning point in the relationship<br />
between our two countries.<br />
I am particularly pleased to be joined today by Indonesi a' s Co-ordinating<br />
Minister for Industry and Trade, Hartarto. Minister Hartarto has been a great<br />
~ iipporter of expanding economic ties between Indonesia and Australia. The<br />
success of the Australia Today program in Indonesia owes much to his efforts<br />
and I thank him most warmly for that.<br />
We have with us today Ministers and representatives from a number of<br />
Australian State Governments. I welcome them here.<br />
I know how they have worked to develop economic and cultural links between<br />
Australia and Indonesia particularly links with various provincial<br />
governments in Indonesia.<br />
The Australian States have a crucial role to play and there is no doubt that<br />
they are playing ft.<br />
Most of all, I am pleased to see so many Australian and Indonesian business<br />
people here.<br />
The trade mission which my colleague Senator Bob McMullan is leading<br />
includes representatives of over 200 companies.<br />
This Is the largest trade mission ever to leave4ustralia. It Is an outstanding<br />
response -and a measure of interest and jo; pnt among our business<br />

communities which underlines the force and meaning behind the title-<br />
" Expanding Horizons".<br />
It is useful to bear in mind the reasons for this sudden explosion of interest in<br />
the relationship between Australia and Indonesia.<br />
It is not merely because we are neighbours. We have alay been<br />
neighbours. And far-sighted individuals in each country have been urging the<br />
value of closer links for decades.<br />
The heightened interest flows from a mixture of new circumstances and new<br />
resolve. It derives partly from changes at work in the wider world, and partly from<br />
changes in our two countries.<br />
The end of the Cold War has fundamentally altered the way the international<br />
community operates. Old structures have broken up or loosened. New<br />
options have opened up and new linkages are being formed. Regional ties<br />
are getting stronger. Uncertainties have grown.<br />
At the same time, developments in the global economy technological<br />
change, quicker and easier cammunicati6n, the free and rapid flow of<br />
Investment funds are bringing changes to the patterns of International<br />
commerce and to the role which governments must play.<br />
Developing countries are becoming more important In the global economy.<br />
For example, In the past decade exports from developing countries in Asia<br />
have grown at twice the rate of world exports. And over the same period<br />
these countries have grown two and a half times as fast as the world.<br />
economy. Like any substantial change, this has caused a degree of unease.<br />
Many have found the adjustment difficult; for many It threatens difficulty. Irvr<br />
meetings with some of Europe's leaders-earlier this month I argued that the<br />
developed world should not fearthe products of the developing nations, and.<br />
should not try to stem the tIde of their growth.<br />
Developing countries have the right to expect that their products will be able<br />
to flow to world markets without meeting new protectionist barriers, either<br />
direct or disguised.<br />
And why should they not expect open markets, when the fact is that they can<br />
benefit'all of us at home and abroad? </p>
<p>These changes in the structure of the world and the world economy have run<br />
parallel to internal changes in Australia and Indonesia. To keep up with the<br />
world, we have opened up to the world.-_<br />
It is a difficult, even painful, step. But it is the only sensible one to take.<br />
The clear evidence is that the comforts of protectionism are illusory, that<br />
without the stimulus of competition economies stagnate and structures decay.<br />
In Australia we are now seeing why the hard decisions of the eighties had to<br />
be made. We are seeing some of the rewards.<br />
The Australian economy is growing at five per cent, faster than any other<br />
developed country. Our inflation rate, now around I per cent, is expected to<br />
remain low.<br />
With the floating of the Australian dollar and the abolition of exchange<br />
controls, with the total abolition of quotas and the reduction of the general<br />
rate of tariffs with few exceptions to five per cent or less by 1996, the<br />
Australian economy is now one of the most open in the world.<br />
Australian exporters particularly our manufacturers have embraced the<br />
challenge of competing in world markets.<br />
Our exports grew by more than seven and a half per cent in 1993, faster than<br />
either domestic or world economic growth . And elaborately transformed<br />
manufactures now represent over 20 per cent of our exports, compared with<br />
11 percent In 1983.<br />
The results of Indonesia's liberallsation are similarly clear. GDP growth last<br />
year was more than six per cent.<br />
This, too, is a product of resolve.<br />
Over recent years indeed in recent dM~ the Indonesian Government has<br />
undertaken significant deregulation and reform, removing non-tariff barriers<br />
and reducing tariffs, taking steps to deregulate industry and to create a moreliberal<br />
investment environment<br />
This commitment to reform Is bound to boost the confidence of investors.<br />
That Indonesia continues to reduce Its tariff levels is of course a matter of!<br />
direct interest to Australian exporters. But as Indonesia industrialises, furtherliberallsation<br />
of the Indonesian market will mean more productivity and more<br />
competitive Indonesian exports as well-<br />
Changes In recent global trade arrangements wvill also help our economies.<br />

At the beginning of the next century the Uruguay Round alone will be adding.<br />
well over $ 400 billion annually to the wqrdd economy. Of that amount, about<br />
$ 120 billion is likely to benefit developing countries such as Indonesia.<br />
Indeed, once all the effects of the Uruguay Round have flowed through,<br />
Indonesia could receive a stimulus to Its real GDP of 7 per cent or more.<br />
Australian research suggests that global tariff barriers on industrial products<br />
exported by Indonesia will fall* by 42 per cent under the Round. Most of<br />
Indonesia's exports will have secure access through bound tariffs in its major<br />
markets. Real exports could Increase by 30 per cent.<br />
Through APEC we can add to that momentum by setting ourselves goals for<br />
free trade; and by harrmonising standards in key areas. The benefits to<br />
Indonesia from further lberalising In concert with other APEC members will be<br />
even greater than those flowing from the Uruguay Round.<br />
It Is one of those cases where you have to be In it to win and all who are In it<br />
will gain.<br />
These are the realities which underpin our new horizons. These are the<br />
reasons we are here. We have all seen the opportunities.<br />
Already, two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia has grown at a trendrate<br />
of 22 per cent in the past five years to reach $ 3 billion in 1993.<br />
Over 180 Australian companies are now operating in Indonesia, and of<br />
course I hope that will rise over the next few days.<br />
Australia is one of the top ten Investors in Indonesia.<br />
And the composition of our trade Is changing. For both of us, manufacturesz,<br />
are an increasing percentage of the total. In 1984 only 7' per cent, of'<br />
Indonesian exports to Australia were elaborately transformed manufactures-.<br />
In 1992, the figure was 25 per cent. For Australia, the figure has risen from-.<br />
19 per cent to 24 per cent In the same period.*<br />
I expect services trade to be an Increasingly strong area of growth in futurez-<br />
Australia is-already the fourth most Important source of tourists to indonesia<br />
And more than 7,500 young Indonesians are already studying in Australia.<br />
All these very welcome developments are no accident And we should not baFshy<br />
about-saying so for they mean the pain of economic reform had: apurpose.<br />
It Is a reminder that common sense and the courage to exercise it have--<br />
rewards. It means that cooperation has rewards.... l1 005 </p>

The rewards, of course, come in the form of jobs, higher standards of living,<br />
greater economic strength and resilience, access to knowledge and<br />
technology, and the satisfaction that comes from nation building for future<br />
generations of our people.<br />
They come in the form of successful enterprises successful companies.<br />
The companies represented at this forum illustrate what is happening to the<br />
relationship. With so many present it is almost invidious to single out a few.<br />
But I want to note the contribution of New Hope Corporation of Australia. and<br />
its local associate the Swabara Group of Indonesia as co-presenters of the<br />
forum. New Hope Corporation's bulk commodity port project in Kalimantan is an<br />
excellent example of Australian design skills, engineering excellence and<br />
financial expertise combining to meet Indonesia's infrastructure needs.<br />
It shows how technologies specifically developed in Australia can be<br />
transferred to Indonesia.<br />
When the first stage of the port is completed in early 1996 at a cost of $ 150<br />
million it will be the only deep water port outside Australia built specially for<br />
buik commodities.<br />
There is a great diversity among the Australian companies now in Indonesia.<br />
The ANZ Banking group is Involved In a joint venture with the Pan Indonesian<br />
BanWo7ffiering financial products to the commercial market. -The AMP Society<br />
and the Panin Group are launching a joint venture which represents the<br />
largest eVer Australian involvement In the Indonesian financial services<br />
sector. Davids' Asia have signed a Technical Assistance Agreement with PT Hero for<br />
the development of a modem warehousing and distribution operation in<br />
Indonesia. BTR Nylex is involved in a joint venture with KCI producing glass packagingfor<br />
a wide range of markets.<br />
ABB Australia is involved in power generation and distribution; Boral Is.<br />
engaged in producing materials for the construction industry.<br />
AWA has provided air navigation and road traffic control systems with its-<br />
Indonesian joint venture partners and Is looking to expand its operations.<br />
Goodman Fielder, with Its partner the Sinar Mas4Goup, is involved In the food.<br />
manufasturing sector. BHP and CRA have major investments in the minerals-' </p>

sector; Transfield in engineering projects; Lend Lease Corporation in a range<br />
of service industries.<br />
And let me here pay a small tribute to some of the pioneers in this area.<br />
Southcorp Holdings through Rheem Indonesia, established in 1968 what may<br />
well be the oldest Australian investment in Indonesia. Commonwealth<br />
Industrial Gases set up a joint venture with Industrial Gases Indonesia in<br />
1972. The John Holland Group began operations in Indonesia in 1974.<br />
The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has operated in Indonesia for<br />
almost 25 years and its expertise will be in growing demand as Indonesia's<br />
resources are developed.<br />
I could go on, and perhaps I should because it is a roll of honour. But there<br />
are too many to name here.<br />
Governments can significantly help by creating structures for closer ties.<br />
That is why President Soeharto and I agreed during my first visit to Indonesia<br />
to establisif -Fodrrum through which our Ministers could explore the<br />
possibilities for co-operation.<br />
The Ministerial Forum will meet in Canberra for the second time later this<br />
year. Its agenda continues to lengthen.<br />
In the past three years there have been twenty seven visits to Indonesia by<br />
Australian Ministers, three times the number over the preceding three years.<br />
And the Australia Today promotion has brought a further eight Australian,<br />
Ministers here.<br />
These bilateral developments are strengthened by developing regional<br />
structures. One of the most important issues President Soeharto and I discussed.<br />
yesterday was the APEC Leaders' Meeting which he will chair orr<br />
November in Bogor. I believe the Bogor meeting will be as pathbreaking as<br />
the meeting at Bandung was forty years ago.<br />
Both of us see the meeting as critical to consolidating APEC and developing<br />
an open Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Both of us want a region which will be actively involved in liberalising trade;<br />
facilitating commerce, and strengthening economic linkages between a group<br />
of economies which represent half the world's population and more than half<br />
its production. A. a </p>

As President Soeharto has said our aim is to improve ' the stability, security<br />
and welfare of the people of the Asia-Pacific region under a spirit of united<br />
community'. Australia will be working very closely with Indonesia towards fulfilling that aim.<br />
I also discussed with President Soeharto the proposal we are studying to<br />
promote closer links between the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the Australia<br />
New Zealand agreement on Closer Economic Relations.<br />
With all these things happening, I firmly believe that the conditions global,<br />
regional and bilateral which have caused this new burst of activity in our<br />
relationship will continue to impel us in the same direction.<br />
Because this relationship is not some temporary, take-it-or-leave-it affair.<br />
It is-no transitory fascination; no purely academic interest. It is a deep,<br />
complex and, I might say, exciting relationship which has to work if both<br />
countries are to live up to their potential.<br />
As I said In March, no country is more important to Australia than Indonesia.<br />
I also said then that the job of developing the relationship will not be easy.<br />
We are very different countries with very different societies, we stem from<br />
different cultures, we -are at different stages of development. Indonesia's<br />
population Is ten times ours.<br />
We are an industrialised country; Indonesia is a rapidly developing. one.<br />
So can we sustain a relationship of depth and worth across this divide?<br />
Of course we can.<br />
Of course we must.<br />
But the doing of it requires clear sight and sensitivity. Courage, hard work.<br />
boldness openness.-<br />
I want Australia to be much better known in Indonesia for what it is,. X<br />
sophisticated, technologically-advanced. society with a, diverse, operr and<br />
tolerant people.<br />
It was painful, for example, to learn as part of the research for the Australia<br />
Today promotion that most Indonesians still think Australia has a raciallybased.<br />
Immigration policy. </p>
<p>80339Efl GEN OFFICE ** PH PRESS OFFICE 0 9-<br />
In turn, I want Indonesia to be known by Australians for what ft is, in all its<br />
cultural richness and ethnic diversity, with all its challenges, its achievements<br />
and Its aspirations.<br />
That is why the Australia Today promotion goes beyond business and trade,<br />
and offers an insight into Australia's diverse contemporary society.<br />
Next year Indonesia celebrates fifty years since its declaration of<br />
independence from Holland. Just a few years later Australia will celebrate the<br />
centenary of our Federation.<br />
As I said back in March, the relationship between Australia and Indonesia can<br />
be a model for ca-operation between developed and developing countries,<br />
between countries based on Western structures and values and those based<br />
on Asian models.<br />
So my message to all of you in this room, and to the increasing numbers of<br />
people in both our countries who see the great potential in our bilateral<br />
relationship, is that your commitment will be worth it.<br />
I said at the beginning of this address that it was worth bearing in mind where<br />
the new interest in our relationship came from.. I said it came from a mixture<br />
of circumstances and resolve.<br />
It is worth bearing in mind because there is a lesson in the story. The fact is<br />
that people can live side by side forever and never really be neighbours they<br />
only'truly became neighbours w hen they begin to talk to one another, and<br />
cooperate and share an interest In each other's lives, however different those<br />
lives might be.<br />
These relationships do not develop by accident, there is nothing inevitable<br />
about them. They have to be initiated, common ground has to be<br />
established, along with mutual respect for different history, culture and<br />
aspirations. So long as we share the neighbourhood and we always will these efforts<br />
will be necessary and very worthwhile.<br />
So long as we share the neighbourhood, we should share its responsibilities<br />
and its potential.<br />
That is the reason for all this bilateral activity. That is the reason for our<br />
support for APEC. It is why I am here, and why you are here because we<br />
have recognised the widening horizons of our relationship and are determined<br />
to explore them.<br />
I most sincerely thank you for coming and wish you well in your endeavours<br />
of thepcext few days. </p>
