4,,, AUS RALIA~<br />
PRIME M3NISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 21 SEPTEM4BER 1978<br />
STATEMENT ON MIDDLE EAST SITUATION<br />
I seek leave to make a statement to the House about the<br />
agreements reached at Camp David between Prime Minister<br />
Begin of Israel and President Sadat of Egypt.<br />
As Honourable Members will know, the thirteen day long Camp<br />
David talks which concluded on September 17 resulted from<br />
the personal initiative of President Carter.<br />
The Government very much welcomed this initiative and it<br />
welcomes the promising results that have been achieved.<br />
I can mention to the House that President Carter was in<br />
touch with me immediately before the talks at Camp David,<br />
and that he again wrote to me following the conclusion of<br />
the talks.<br />
In my reply to the. President's latest letter, I conveyed to<br />
him my warmest congratulations on his personal achievement<br />
in bringing the two parties to agreement on a Framework for<br />
Peace in the middle East and the Australian Government's<br />
commitment to support his untiring efforts to bridge the<br />
distance between Israeli and Egyptian standpoints.<br />
I am sure all members of this House would wish to join with<br />
me in congratulating the President on his initiative, and I<br />
note that the Honourable Member for Holt on Tuesday gave<br />
notice of a motion to this effect in which he was supported<br />
by members on both sides of the House.<br />
I also pay tribute to the statesmanship of President Sadat<br />
and Prime Minister Begin.<br />
All Honourable Members will be fully awvare of the importance<br />
of the Middle East Region for world peace, and its vital<br />
significance to Western interests.<br />
In the last thirty years, the Region has been in continual<br />
turmoil There have been four wars between the Arabs and the<br />
Israelis. This has brought appalling suffering to the<br />
peoples of the Region. </p>
<p>The instability created by this situation has been a constant<br />
threat to world peace, and a constant invitation to unwarranted<br />
external interference.<br />
The search for peace has been a continuing preoccupation of<br />
the United Nations and Western States throughout this period.<br />
Under successive American Presidents, the United States has<br />
made strenuous efforts to promote a settlement. These efforts,<br />
however, foundered largely on the inability of the parties<br />
concerned to overcome their deep-seated mutual fear and<br />
distrust. It was not until the bold and imaginative initiative of<br />
President Sadat in going to Jerusalem in November 1977<br />
that the hope of a breakthrough towards some sort of<br />
settlement in the Middle East seemed capable of realisation.<br />
Unfortunately, the negotiations which fol. lowed President Sadat's<br />
visit to Israel, and Mr Begin's return visit to Egypt, did<br />
not gather the necessary momentum to enable a proper framework<br />
for a settlement to be established.<br />
It became apparent after the Leeds Castle meetings in July<br />
that if there was to be any prospect of further progress,<br />
some new stimulus would be needed.<br />
President Carter took the courageous step of inviting the<br />
Egyptian and Israeli leaders to meet him at Camp David for<br />
personal discussions. President Carter wrote to me on<br />
August about his reasons for initiating the Camp David<br />
talks, and what he hoped to accomplish from them.<br />
In my reply to him I emphasised the Australian Government's<br />
support for the talks and the importance we attached to them.<br />
The outcome of the talks is known to Honourable Members. in<br />
summnary, two agreements were signed by President Sadat and<br />
Prime Minister Begin, and witnessed by President Carter.<br />
The first agreement is entitled " A Framework for Peace in<br />
The Middle East" and covers the West Bank and Gaza. It envisages<br />
a five-year transitional period during which Israeli military<br />
forces will be withdrawn to garrisons in specified locations,<br />
and the election of a self-governing authority with full<br />
autonomy. Negotiations will be held among Egypt, Israel and i-f-it agrees<br />
to participate Jordan, as well as elected representatives<br />
of the Palestinians to determine the final status of the<br />
West Bank and Gaza and it is hoped to produce a peace<br />
treaty between Israel and Jordan.<br />
During the negotiations there will be a freeze on the<br />
establishment of new Israeli settlements in the West Bank<br />
and Gaza. Security arrangements may include United Nations<br />
forces, special security zones, demilitarized zones and early<br />
warning stations. / 3 </p>
<p>There is to be an exchange of letters on the Status of<br />
East Jerusalem.<br />
The second agreement, entitled " A Framework for the Conclusion<br />
of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel", covers the Sinai<br />
and future bilateral relations.<br />
it envisages a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel to be<br />
signed within three months: full Israeli withdrawal from<br />
the Sinai phased over no more than three years from the<br />
signing of the treaty; the handing over of Israeli airfields<br />
in the Sinai to Egyptian civilian control beginning from<br />
three to nine months after that signing; the establishment<br />
of security zones; and the establishment of normal relations<br />
between Egypt and Israel on completion of the first major<br />
Israeli withdrawal.<br />
The Australian Government believes that the two agreements<br />
provide a constructive framework for the resolution of the<br />
Middle East conflict.<br />
President Carter's timely initiative was clearly a vital<br />
factor in bringing the two parties to these agreements, which<br />
will surely be regarded as an historic turning point in the<br />
search for a settlement in the Middle East.<br />
We particularly welcome the agreement by the leaders of Egypt<br />
and Israel that the provisions and principles of U. N. Security<br />
Council Resolution 242 will govern the negotiations for an<br />
agreed basis for a peaceful settlement between Israel and its<br />
neighbours. This is a position which the Australian Government<br />
has consistently taken.<br />
We also welcome the recognition in the Camp David agreements<br />
of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including<br />
their right to participate in the determination of their own<br />
future. This also accords with the stated policy of the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
A difficult road lies ahead. Other Arab States, whose support<br />
will be essential to any lasting settlement, have yet to be<br />
convinced that the Camp David framework can be an acceptable<br />
basis for future negotiations.<br />
We hope that the Middle Eastern governments, in the spirit of<br />
Camp David, will be encouraged to support this framework and<br />
to participate in future negotiations in the search for peace.<br />
It is most important that the momentum generated by the Camp<br />
David agreements be maintained. Continued diplomatic activity<br />
will be critical to the objectives of ensuring further progress<br />
in the negotiations in the months ahead.<br />
In this context, the present round of talks being undertaken<br />
by Mr Vance with key Arab leaders will be of fundamental<br />
importance. 14 </p>
<p>4<br />
The Australian Government stands ready to give its support<br />
to the terms of any settlement agreed upon between the<br />
parties in the Middle East.<br />
I have written to President Carter today to inform him that<br />
the Australian Government regards the agreements reached at<br />
Camp David as a major contribution towards a peace settlement,<br />
and that he has our full support for his efforts to bring<br />
an end to the threat of war in the Middle East.<br />
