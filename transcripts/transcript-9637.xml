PARLIAMENTARY MOTION ON FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
I move that this House:<br />
condemns the decision of the Government of France to resume<br />
nuclear testing in the South Pacific;<br />
calls on the French Government to reverse its decision and not to<br />
resume testing;<br />
shares the resentment of South Pacific countries at nuclear testing in<br />
the South Pacific and endorses the statement condemning the<br />
decision issued by the South Pacific Forum;<br />
dopforoo r-ran= olo do iion tQ b, cu%, l= i i, I D Z I I ltu I I 1 Wn'icr' nauI<br />
improved relations between France and countries in the region;<br />
expresses its outrage that France's decision undermines the outcome<br />
of the recent Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons<br />
Review and Extension Conference, particularly the commitment made<br />
at the Conference that, pending entry into force of the Comprehensive<br />
Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT), the nuclear weapon states should exercise<br />
utmost restraint;<br />
notes that Australia will do all in its power and urge all other countries<br />
to hold France to President Chirac's statement that France would sign<br />
a CTBT without reservation in autumn 1996; and<br />
calls on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific<br />
Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.<br />
This resolution-is Intended to convey as clearly as possible to the<br />
Government of France the firm condemnation by the people of Australia,<br />
acting through their representatives in this House, of the decision announced </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
by the Government of France to resume the testing of nuclear weapons at<br />
Mururca Atoll. It also expresses our hope that the decision might yet be<br />
reversed.<br />
The President of France, President Chirac, announced the decision to<br />
resume underground nuclear testing on 1~ 3 June. He said that a program of<br />
eight tests would be conducted between September 1995 and May 1996.<br />
President Chirac said that the testing was essential in order to ensure the<br />
security, safety and reliability of France's nuclear weapons. He said that after<br />
completing this series of tests, France would intend to sign the<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and to rely thereafter on simulation<br />
techniques to maintain its nuclear capabilities.<br />
The decision reversed the moratorium on nuclear testing announced by<br />
President Mitterrand in 1992, a moratorium which had been widely welcomed<br />
and which together with the earlier Matignon Accords which set up a basis<br />
for reconciliation in New Caledonia formed the foundation on which a new,<br />
cooperative partnership between France and the countries of the South<br />
Pacific was emerging.<br />
President Chirac's announcement on 13 June followed widespread<br />
speculation in France about the future of the testing program during the<br />
Presidential election campaign and afterwards.<br />
In response to this speculation, Australia, along with many other countries,<br />
had made known to the French Government our hopes that the moratorium<br />
would be maintained. I wrote to President Chirac about this matter following<br />
earlier representations made by the Foreign Minister, Senator Evans. The<br />
French moratorium matched separate commitments by the United States,<br />
Russian and British Governments to refrain from testing.<br />
In the end, however, the French Government ignored the views of the vast<br />
majority of members of the international community and decided to proceed<br />
with its program. That is an Indefensible decision and the Australian people<br />
and the Australian Government condemn it.<br />
Australia's opposition to the resumed testing of nuclear weapons by France<br />
stems from a number of concerns, of which the most fundamental is the<br />
security implications of the decision for Australia, for the South Pacific region<br />
and for the international community.<br />
The end of the Cold War, having removed the spectre of global nuclear<br />
conflict which had thrown such a dark shadow on the second half of the<br />
twentieth century, gave new hope to the world that we might at last see a<br />
world free of nuclear weapons.<br />
An important sign post towards a safer world was the decision by the<br />
international community on 11 May 1 995 in New York~ to extend indefinitely<br />
the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Critical to achieving<br />
TEL Jul 22 : 51J No .007 F .02/ CJ7 </p>
<p>TEL: 1 i. Jun .95 .22 : 59 No 007 F. 03CJ0T,<br />
3<br />
the indefinite extension of the NPT was the simultaneous negotiation and<br />
adoption by all parties to the NPT, including the nuclear weapon states of a<br />
" Declaration of Principles and Objectives on Non Proliferation and<br />
Disarmament". This Declaration included, centrally, a commitment to the goal of nuclear<br />
disarmament, with the ultimate objective of the total elimination of nuclear<br />
weapons. It gave encouragement to the further development of nuclear<br />
weapon free zones.<br />
And it said that one important measure towards the elimination of nuclear<br />
weapons was the early conclusion, no later than 1996, of a Comprehensive<br />
Test Ban Treaty. Pending the entry into force of a Test Ban Treaty, the<br />
nuclear weapon states were committed to exercise " utmost restraint".<br />
The French decision clearly contradicts this undertaking. ' Utmost restraint'<br />
on nuclear testing cannot possibly comprehend a program of eight tests. The<br />
decision is certain to raise in the minds of non nuclear weapon states<br />
questions about the good faith of all the nuclear weapons states. It will add<br />
to the negotiating difficulties over the Comprehensive rest Ban Treaty.<br />
France's action might well provide a convenient excuse for others who might<br />
want to join the nuclear club, and who will now argue that the commitment of<br />
the nuclear weapons states to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons is<br />
a sham.<br />
This is a critical time for the world. The cold war has ended but what will<br />
shape our future security and prosperity is still uncertain. We are moulding<br />
the building blocks now.<br />
It is particularly important that all governents work together to ensure that<br />
the international system we have in the twenty first century is one which suits<br />
all of us better than the one we have had.<br />
The French decision is a narrow decision, made according to a narrow<br />
definition 9f narrowly French interests. It defies world opinion, but that is the<br />
only bold thing about it. In every other sense it betrays timidity. It is an act of<br />
retreat, not engagement.<br />
As I said on 15 June, why should a country of such substance undertake this<br />
program? What is there to fear in cooperative engagement with the rest of<br />
the world? What will best protect the French people is not a 1990s version of<br />
the Maginot line, but participation in the global dialogue.<br />
The French Government claims that this nuclear capacity this force de<br />
frappe is a deterrent. But in the post Cold War world, a deterrent to what?<br />
It Is certainly no deterrent against the greatest nuclear threats to Europe and<br />
the world now, including the emergence of new nuclear weapons states. </p>
<p>' FEL 4<br />
France, by its inflammatory action with regard to Its testing program, now runs<br />
the greater risk of losing international support, both moral and material, for<br />
cleaning up the rotting carcasses of the old Soviet reactors, whose presence<br />
still hangs over Europe and France like a pall. This is one of France's and<br />
Europe's great challenges. These dangers, like the stockpiles of degrading<br />
nuclear weapons and weapons systems, and contaminated nuclear sites,<br />
cannot be deterred through the further development of an offensive nuclear<br />
weapon capability.<br />
These considerations are international in scope. They also shape Australia's<br />
opposition to nuclear testing by China.<br />
But Australia and the other members of the South Pacific Forum have a<br />
particular concern with French testing because it is not being conducted in<br />
France's metropolitan territory, but in the South Pacific.<br />
Most countries in this region are small island states. For many years they<br />
have made clear their opposition to nuclear weapons. They have shown this<br />
year after year in the resolutions of the South Pacific Forum and, most<br />
clearly, in the creation of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. The<br />
Government of France is defying not only their wishes but their moral rights.<br />
This action will call into question for many in the South Pacific the legitimacy<br />
of the French presence there.<br />
The French Government has defended the environmental safety of the tests<br />
at Mururoa and it has alluded to the possibility that international scientists<br />
might observe the tests.<br />
But the fact is that accidents happen. And no one can foresee the longer<br />
term dangers associated with possible leakage from the underground coral<br />
structures housing the tests.<br />
The fact remains that if these tests are perfectly safe, they could be made<br />
perfectly w ell in France.<br />
Condemnation of the French decision has not been confined to the fifteen<br />
members of the South Pacific Forum.<br />
Critical statements have been issued by Belgium, Chile, Denmark, Indonesia,<br />
Ireland, Japan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, Peru, the Philippines,<br />
Korea, Russia, South Africa, and Switzerland. On 15 June the European<br />
Parliament in Strasbourg adopted a resolution expressing shock at the<br />
decision and urging France to reconsider. Canada and the United States<br />
have regretted the decision.<br />
Australia's response has been strong and unequivocal. The Government has<br />
deplored the decision. We have frozen defence relations with France and we<br />

<p>I LL 1 Jun-z : j 1 u<br />
will not engage in any defence activity which would in any way assist the<br />
testing program.<br />
We have protested against the French decision in the International Atomic<br />
Energy Agency Board of Governors meeting in Vienna, and other<br />
international bodies, including the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva<br />
and the United Nations in New York.<br />
Australia has a particular responsibility in this matter this year because we<br />
are Chair of the South Pacific Forum. I have been in close touch with my<br />
Forum colleagues about it.<br />
On their behalf, I issued a statement condemning the decision and<br />
expressing our unequivocal opposition to it. I said that Forum leaders hoped<br />
that France will hear and take note of what the world is saying.<br />
To make sure that France does hear, we proposed to send a delegation of<br />
members of the South Pacific Forum to Paris to put the views of Forum<br />
countries directly and unambiguously to the French Government.<br />
Because of the limited time available, and in accordance with Forum practice,<br />
the delegation comprises the past, present and next forum chairs. So<br />
Senator Evans is leading the delegation.<br />
He is accompanied by President Bernard Dowiyogo of Nauru and Mr<br />
Tsiamilili, a special envoy from the Government of Papua New Guinea, which<br />
takes over the Forum Chair in September. The New Zealand Minister for<br />
Justice, Mr Graham, and the Western Samoan Minister of Education, Ms<br />
Fiami, are also represented on the delegation, as is the Secretary General of<br />
the Forum, the Hon leremiah Tabai.<br />
The delegation will meet the French Government later tonight, Paris time.<br />
The passing of this resolution by the House will assist it to convey to the<br />
French Government the depth of Forum countries concerns.<br />
When the delegation reports back on the results of its discussions early<br />
tomorrow morning, I plan to be in touch again quickly with my Forum<br />
colleagues about what next steps we will take.<br />
The concerns of the Australian people about the French decision have been<br />
demonstrated clearly over recent days. I hope they will continue to be<br />
expressed and in ways which help bring home to the French Government<br />
how widespread is the opposition to these policies.<br />
But, Mr Speaker, some Important things need to be remembered in this<br />
debate and some have been lost sight of. UU </p>
<p>FEL 6<br />
The Government's position in this matter and I believe the position of most<br />
Australians is not shaped by hostility towards France or the French people,<br />
or to France's role in the Pacific. It is shaped solely by our opposition to this<br />
specific policy of the Government of France to resume testing nuclear<br />
weapons in the South Pacific.<br />
France, and Australians who have come from France, have made a valuable<br />
contribution to Australia.<br />
I have spoken before of the opportunities which exist for French business in<br />
Australia and for Australian businesses in France. I have also said that we<br />
welcome constructive French participation in the South Pacific.<br />
It is very important that the expressions of Australian concern about this<br />
French policy do not flow over into racist attacks on France or French people.<br />
It is this particular French Government policy which we object to.<br />
It Is important for Australians to remember that many French people object to<br />
this decision as well. A number of members of the French delegation to the<br />
European Parliament voted in favour of the resolution I referred to earlier.<br />
All Members of this House will, I am sure, share the view that terrorist acts,<br />
like the arson reported to be the cause of the fire at the office of the Honorary<br />
French Consul in Perth on 17 June must be utterly rejected and condemned.<br />
It would be a very sorry consequence if our opposition to an act which<br />
contravenes our every sense of fairness and decency, should erode these<br />
values in our own society. Such acts as that which occurred in Perth, the<br />
Government utterly condemns as both illegal and un-Australian. Such acts<br />
are not only objectionable but counter-productive to our cause.<br />
Those with influential positions in the community, in politics and the media,<br />
must be aware of their responsibilities and when they voice their Concerns be<br />
careful not to encourage acts of violence or acts which undermine the<br />
legitimacy and moral authority of Australia's protest.<br />
It does not'diminish our resentment of the French decision to understand<br />
exactly what it entails.<br />
It should be a concern of all members that Australians have an accurate<br />
knowledge about the French proposals not least because our protests will<br />
have more effect if they do not contain exaggerations and inaccuracies.<br />
Our arguments will be more persuasive if they are based in reality and not<br />
irrational fear.<br />
I doubt if there is any Australian who does not feel anger about the French<br />
decision. What we must take to the French Government is a collective<br />

concerted response. The response of all the Australian people channelled<br />
through the best means available to us.<br />
This decision to resume testing is a bad decision by the Government of<br />
France. It is bad because it endangers progress towards a world free of<br />
nuclear weapons. It Is bad because it ignores the views of the people of the<br />
region in which the tests are being conducted. It is bad because it sets back<br />
so far the cause of constructive French participation in the South Pacific<br />
region. It is bad because it is a decision which is essentially serf-absorbed<br />
rather than showing a wider vision.<br />
It is important that this Parliament, representing the people of Australia,<br />
conveys clearly to Government of France the extent of our concern at this<br />
wilful and unnecessary declsion by the Government of France.<br />
I commend the motion to the House.<br />
