FOR PRESS: P. M. No 117/ 1970<br />
DEATH OF LORD SLIM<br />
Tribute from the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Lord Slim won the admiration of the Australian<br />
people in war and peace.<br />
He proved himself an outstanding General in<br />
the Second World War, and in the post-war years was a highly<br />
respected and popular Governor-General of Australia.<br />
A down-to-earth, courageous, professional soldier,<br />
who had risen through the ranks, Lord Slim had a particularly<br />
warm place in the hearts of Australians.<br />
We are saddened to learn of his death, and I<br />
extend to his family the sincere sympathy of the Australian<br />
Government and people.<br />
CANBERRA December 1970 </p>
