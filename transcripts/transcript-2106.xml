" FOUR CORNERS"<br />
INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON, FOR ABC TELEVISION NETWORK<br />
Recorded on 28 August for viewing on 30 August 1969<br />
Interviewer: Michael Willesee<br />
The Prime Minister used Question Time in the House<br />
this week to take a verbal big stick to Mr. Whitlam's health proposals<br />
and by the opinion of most who were there at the time, Mr. Gorton<br />
gave Mr. Whitlam a beating. Mr. Gorton's performance probably<br />
wasn't much of a vote-winner because Parliamentary clashes are<br />
rather an "" thing but it was a flying start psychologically for Mr.<br />
Gorton and his team. It could well be that Mr. Gorton needs this<br />
start because he is very much the man in the hot seat. He inherited<br />
a record majority from the late Mr. Holt and there is pressure on<br />
him to hold it. Mr. Gorton could come home a comfortable winner<br />
by say twenty seats and still face criticism for the seats he lost, and<br />
he faces a hostile Democratic Labor Party. None of his predecessors<br />
had to do that. If the DLP carries out its threat of switching its<br />
preferences from the Government in selected seats, then Mr. Gorton<br />
would almost certainly lose some seats. With the election eight<br />
weeks to go, we invited Mr. Gorton to talk with us in Canberra.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, firstly, have you bowed to any pressure<br />
from the DLP this week or in the last few weeks?<br />
PM. Neither this week nor in the last few weeks nor at any<br />
time in the past nor at any time in the future.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, can I ask you specifically, did you impose<br />
on Mr. Freeth last Monday to alter a statement he was making in<br />
response to an attack from Senator Gair?<br />
PM. Which statement was this? Oh, this was a statement<br />
where Mr. Freeth was defending himself against the personal attacks<br />
that had been made on him by Senator Gair. I had a talk with Mr.<br />
Freeth. After all, it is not unusual for Ministers and Prime Ministers<br />
to talk, and indicated that I thought the proper attitude for a government<br />
and ministers to adopt was not to attack the DLP, which after all are<br />
a party of principle. We don't need to attack them or to denigrate<br />
them, merely to say that they have a right to do what they like with<br />
their preferences but they have got to consider the different policies<br />
which they must choose between. Mr. Freeth has got a right and so<br />
has anybody else to come back against personal attacks or<br />
misrepresentation of his words. / 2 </p>
<p>Q. In talking with Mr. Freeth, did you suggest that he add<br />
the allegation that in certain quarters of the ALP there was some<br />
sympathy for communist policies?<br />
PM. No, he had that in himself. He had in his speech<br />
himself the words that he had thought that although the ALP itself was<br />
not communist, and would agree with him on that I mean, you take<br />
ALP Members of Parliament or their supporters, of course they are<br />
not communist but he had indicated before that he felt there was<br />
communist influence in sections of the ALP through communistdominated<br />
trade unions and matters of that kind, and he reiterated<br />
that.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, could we go back to Mr. Yreeth's<br />
statement of August 14 which started all this, and I think there is a<br />
lot of misunderstanding around it. In this statement, Mr. Freeth<br />
welcomed the opportunity of practical and constructive dealings with<br />
the Soviets and said it was natural that they should promote their<br />
presence in our area. Now, firstly, did you approve of that statement?<br />
PM. Yes, I did. I approved of the statement and I approve<br />
of your quotation of it which is better than the quotation when you<br />
first spoke to Mr. Freeth. Do you remember when you were<br />
interviewing Mr. Freeth and you said: " Why, Mr. Freeth, did you<br />
welcome the Russians?". Well, Mr. Freeth didn't, but he welcomed<br />
the opportunity of constructive discussions and you have put it<br />
completely in its proper context.<br />
Q. Thank you.' Prime Minister, did Cabinet approve of<br />
Mr. Freeth's statement'?<br />
PM. No. I don't know of any occasion since I've been in<br />
Parliament or in Cabinet when a foreign affairs statement has been<br />
taken to Cabinet or gone through Cabinet.<br />
Q. Did Mr. Fairhall, your Minister for Defence, see<br />
the statement?<br />
PM. As far as I know he didn't see the statement but equally<br />
as far as I know he completely agrees with it and agreed with it and<br />
would have agreed with it.<br />
Q. Wouldn't you think that was a little bit unusual that a<br />
Minister for Defence shouldn't see a defence statement?<br />
PM. Well, it's rnot really a defence statement. It's hard to<br />
draw the line, I suppose, between defence and foreign affairs. / 3<br />
2 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Q. It certainly went into Mr. Fairhall's area.<br />
PM. I don't know of any occasions, for instance, when Sir<br />
Garfield Barwick was there or Paul Hasluck was there where statements<br />
on foreign policy ever went through Cabinet or to other Ministers<br />
other than the Prime Minister. I don't know of any.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, the biggest point of debate over Mr.<br />
Freeth's statement: Was it a significant policy change?<br />
PM. I don't think it was a significant policy change. It has<br />
been so interpreted but I don't think it was. Look, what Gordon Freeth<br />
said was this. He said we must remember that the Russians have<br />
invaded Czechoslovakia. We must remember that they have I think<br />
I quote correctly " a pernicious doctrine of only limited sovereignty"...<br />
Q. Yes, but whatever these qualifications they don't really<br />
alter the fact do they that he did make statements that were unusual<br />
coming from an Australia Government?<br />
PM. Well, if they were unusual they were as a result of<br />
unusual and completely changed circumstances. Now, where does the<br />
unusuality lie? He said, and I agree, we in Australia have requirements<br />
that we would like to see carried out in the area to our North. We<br />
would like to see the countries economically developed. We would like<br />
to see trade routes opened. We would like to see the standard of living<br />
rising, and we would like to see them retain their own identity and<br />
their own sovereignty. Now, we have for some time ourselves been<br />
trying to get non-aggression pacts and things of that kind in the area<br />
between individual countries and this is in our national interest. The<br />
Russians have said something which they haven't spelt out which was<br />
that they were interested in much the same sort of thing. Now we don't<br />
know what they are interested in. What Gordon Freeth said was that if<br />
they make propositions which seem to be in line with our own national<br />
aspirations, then we would be prepared to look at them and not just<br />
reject them because they came from Russia.<br />
Q. Would you agree then there could be a significant policy<br />
change in the light of the changed circumstances of that area?<br />
PM. Well, if Russia went to the length of maijrzg some<br />
proposals, which sheihasn't yet done and if those proposals were, in<br />
our judgment, in line with our own and didn't pose dangers because of<br />
Russia's general attitude and actions didn't pose those dangers then<br />
it could be, particularly if the Americans maintain the same sort of<br />
diplomatic and economic influence that they have spoken of, it could<br />
be of assistance to our national aspirations. </p>
<p>4<br />
Q. Prime Minister, moving on to the defence cut in the<br />
Budget. Mr. Fairhall said, " We are more interested in programmes<br />
to meet our needs, not in any arithmetic of expenditure"'. Do you go<br />
along with this?<br />
PM. Well, yes, I go along with it if I give it this meaning<br />
which I think Mr. Fairhall would give it. That there is no point in<br />
spending large sums of money merely to be able to point to the<br />
arithmetic and say, " Look at the large sums of money we are spending".<br />
That is fairly pointless. It is more important to get the kind of<br />
material and the kind of equipment that you want. But I wouldn't say,<br />
and I don't think he said or could have been interpreted to have said<br />
that you would cut down your arithmetical sum. Merely, that you<br />
wouldn't make he said merely that you wouldn't make the size<br />
of your arithmetical sum the real test. The test would be what were<br />
you getting and what did you need?<br />
Q. Gould I draw your attention then to a statement you made<br />
after last year's Budget when you said the vote or the expenditure then<br />
indicated the importance you attached to defence. Doesn't this seem<br />
a little bit contradictory?<br />
PM. Except that after last year's Budget we were building up<br />
not only arithmetical sums of money but also the hardware that those<br />
arithmetical sums of money represented and in last year the payments<br />
fell due whereas in this year there is still coming in the hardware but<br />
payments for them, I understand, are being carried over into the next<br />
financial year.<br />
Q. Now, despite your defence cut in the Budget and the<br />
resignation of your Defeiice Minister, Mr. Fairhall, do you still wish<br />
to make defence the key issue in the next election?<br />
PM. I think that defence will be a key issue in the election.<br />
I think it must be because there are such clearly-delineated differences<br />
between the Labor Party and ourselves in this field.<br />
Q. A couple of quick points on defence not quite related.<br />
The F-Ill decision. Can you tell us when that will be taken?<br />
PM. No, indeed I have never promised that an F-ill decision<br />
would be taken before an election though I have been so reported. What<br />
I have done is said I would do my very best to get a decision made and<br />
announced before the election and this I wanted to do and this I believe<br />
I will be able to do. I believe we will be able to make it before the<br />
election. Well before the election. </p>
<p>Q. Could you indicate a date? You do have the report<br />
before you now?<br />
PM. Well, I haven't yet seen it but I understand that it has<br />
been completed. I understand it has just been completed.<br />
Q. So perhaps a couple of weeks?<br />
PM. Perhaps: Who knows?<br />
Q. On the point of a phased withdrawal from Vietnam the<br />
Americans are doing this and you have indicated we shouldn't do this.<br />
Why not?<br />
PM. I have indicated that I thought that if and when our troops<br />
were withdrawn from Vietnam they should not be withdrawn in driblets.<br />
The ground troops which are the ones I am speaking of being three<br />
battalions and ancillary services and tanks and so on being a viable<br />
force should be regarded as a force and either left or withdrawn; but<br />
you don't take out some companies or one battalion or something which<br />
is what the Labor Party, I understand, is talking of doing.<br />
Q. But if you did take some out wouldn't you then go back<br />
to the arrangement you had before, before you built up<br />
PM. Yes, you would. The arrangement which was found to<br />
be unsatisfactory, to be inefficient, to probably present greater<br />
dangers to the two battalions who are left than the three who are there<br />
now. You go back to a situation which was unsatisfactory and which<br />
we corrected.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, before we leave this area, what is your<br />
reaction to DLP threats?<br />
PM. I think the DLP is a party which has a perfect right to<br />
make up its own mind as to which policies it should follow and nobody<br />
can have any objections to that. And if they feel that some other policy<br />
is better than our own, then they have a right to direct their preferences<br />
or seek to direct their preferences as they may wish.<br />
Q. That is not a reaction, though, is it, when they threaten<br />
you? / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM. Oh, what is my own reaction... 0. Well, is this a<br />
reaction then? That I feel that since they are a party which was formed,<br />
believing in the importance of defence and thinking the Labor Party<br />
would not provide it, since they are a party formed believing that there<br />
was, through communist-dominated unions influence oll1 the Labor<br />
Party and not on ourselves, I do not see how they can in principle<br />
support at this election a Labor Party whose defence policies are so<br />
different from ours, so much further away from theirs than ours. Is<br />
that a reaction?<br />
Q. Perhaps! How many seats do you think you owe the DLP?<br />
How many seats have they delivered to you?<br />
PM. How many seats have they delivered to us as a result<br />
Of.<br />
Q. Their preferences.<br />
PM. Well, it depends on whether you count all the seats in<br />
which perhaps we needed five or eight or ten per cent of their<br />
preferences. I would not count such seats as seats which were won as<br />
a result of DLP preferences, even though we might have needed ten<br />
per cent or fifteen per cent, because I believe they would have been<br />
likely to have come anyway. I would say there might be four or five,<br />
possibly six, where we wiould need fifty per cent or in some cases<br />
seventy per cent of DLP preferences. So in that sense, without being<br />
able to answer you exactly, that would be about of the order. Of<br />
course, the DLP owe, I would say, at least two and maybe more seats<br />
to us for our preferences.<br />
Q. Is that a counter-threat?<br />
PM. No, no. just pointing out one of the facts of life.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I would like to look more closely at<br />
you and firstly your impression, your personal impression on<br />
government. You have been accused of political patronage in<br />
government guilty or not guilty?<br />
PM. What does political patronage mean?<br />
Q. I would think bringing a friend in, all things being equal<br />
perhaps? ./ 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
PM. I would think, on the whole, not guilty. The last two<br />
appointments that I made to the Ministry, I think, were one of the<br />
causes of this. Now, Mr. Freeth could scarcely though I like him<br />
very much have been described as a great friend of mine. For<br />
example, when we were contesting the Prime Ministership he was<br />
quite openly and quite decently and quite honestly doing his best to<br />
defeat me, so there could scarcely be a charge of patronage there.<br />
On the other hand, Mr. Dudley Erwin was supporting me. There<br />
again, he was the Whip, which is not always but usually not always<br />
the stepping-stone to an appointment further up.<br />
Q. Whether guilty or not guilty, do you think it is<br />
necessarily a bad thing to have this sort of political patronage?<br />
Pm. Yes, I do if the person is not competent to do the job.<br />
I don't think it's a bad thing if the person is you know, other things<br />
being equal is as good as anyone else.<br />
Q. In various ways, commentators talk about your<br />
independence. Firstly, is it true, and if it is, is that a natural thing<br />
or some sort of deliberate policy?<br />
PM. Independence? Of what?<br />
Q. Oh, independence of the Party, of Cabinet, of the<br />
bureaucracy.<br />
PM. Well, I think one ought to be not independent of, but<br />
certainly not swayed by the bureaucracy. One should listen to their<br />
advice but one * should then form one's own judgment after having had<br />
the benefit of that.<br />
Q. Could we make it comparative? Do you think perhaps<br />
you are more independent than perhaps Prime Minister Holt?<br />
PM. Well, I think comparisons are fairly odious. I would<br />
just say that I don't believe one ought to be swayed by the bureaucracy.<br />
I think one should pay attention, considerable attention to what people<br />
in one's Party say, not be bound by it, and this has always been the<br />
way in which Liberal Prime Ministers have operated. This is not<br />
something from me, myself. As to the Cabinet, then there again,<br />
when you have a strong majority feeling one way, I think one should<br />
do what the Cabinet wants unless one believes that something is so<br />
highly significant and highly important that one couldn't go along with<br />
it oneself.<br />
Q. And that has happened fairly often with you in two years,<br />
hasn't it? ,/ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
PM. Not terribly often maybe once or twice.<br />
Q. But haven't there been six, perhaps ten occasions when<br />
you have stepped in and taken over a matter that would normally be<br />
under the responsibility of a Minister shipping, MLC<br />
PM. MLC, yes. MLC is a complete point in support of the<br />
case that you are making. Shipping is quite the reverse. I think<br />
there were six Cabinet meetings on shipping initiated by the Minister<br />
for Trade, and at one stage culminating in the Minister for Trade<br />
being sent by Cabinet to the United Kingdom to make a negotiation the<br />
terms of which were in a Cabinet decision and which were very very<br />
close to the ultimate terms decided on.<br />
Q. How about the recent Budget where it appeared that your<br />
imprint was fairly strongly on that because it wasn't quite the advice<br />
the Treasury had given you?<br />
PM. Yes, I think well, I wouldn't say it wasn't quite<br />
the advice the Treasury had given me. I am not going to venture into<br />
that matter. But such things as assistance to social services and the<br />
tapered means test are certainly things which I felt very strongly<br />
on and fought for. Not alone other Ministers were with me too.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, in talking about you in this area of your<br />
impression on government, the name Cyrus Hewitt often comes up.<br />
You appointed him to head your Prime Minister's Department. He is<br />
sometimes said to have unusual power. Firstly your comnment on this<br />
and also could I ask you perhaps whether you regard him more as the<br />
sort of adviser that an American P resident might take to off ice with<br />
him?<br />
PM. I don't thik he has got unusual power at all. People<br />
have been writing this for some time now. You know, journalists tend<br />
to each other up a little. Somebody writes it and somebody else repeats<br />
it, somebody else repeats and after a while it becomes part of folklore.<br />
But I don'~ t think he has got any unusual power whatever. He certainly<br />
hasn't with me and I don't think he has with other Ministers and I doubt<br />
if he has with the Departmental Heads. He would be onte of the advisers<br />
I would look to but as I say, one looks to the Heads of the Bureaucracy<br />
for advice and then makes up Oize' s own mind.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, in this question, I am not inferring any<br />
unusual amount inside criticism, but presuming there must always be<br />
some, do you concern yourself about criticism from the inside or do<br />
you feel.. </p>
<p>9-<br />
PM. You mean from the Party members<br />
Q. Yes, perhaps more particularly Cabinet, but also within<br />
the Party.<br />
PM. I don't concern myself with criticism from within the<br />
Cabinet because I think there is very very little. I may be quite wrong<br />
but I don't know of any anyway but it is quite possible it could be but if<br />
so I don't know of it. Within the Party, one seeks to do one's best to<br />
give Party members the opportunity to express their views, to realise<br />
that the things that they really believe in and really put forward are<br />
thoroughly examined and are not accepted for what can be argued to<br />
be good reasons. Having done that, then I think one just has to put up<br />
with the criticism, because whatever one does with a large group of<br />
people, one is never going to please everybody, so there is always<br />
going to be some criticism.<br />
Q. How do you see your policy-making role in relation to<br />
the Liberal Party?<br />
PM. Well, I think that the time has come, and I think it is<br />
evident in this country that it has come when the Liberal Party has<br />
got to re-examine the dogmas of the quiet past in the light of the<br />
changing present. We have got to re-examine our defence and foreign<br />
affairs commitments because of the changes of Britain going, of the<br />
United States perhaps not being so interested in providing troops<br />
assistance to our North. We have got to examine the requirement for<br />
as much Australian participation in development as is possible,<br />
instead of just accepting without question, without asking for Australian<br />
participation.<br />
Q. In these respects do you see yourself as a man of change?<br />
PM. Yes, I think so. I think too in seeking to re-evaluate<br />
social welfare and to move from a situation of merely raising 50 cents<br />
or one dollar across the board to try to find areas of need and doing<br />
what you can in them and at the same time trying to reward thrift and<br />
seeing that is not held back. These are changes and these are things<br />
we are doing.<br />
Q. When you talk about the need for the Party to change,<br />
are you suggesting some section of the Party at least might be lagging<br />
behind? </p>
<p>PM. No, I think they are going along I think the<br />
Party is very happy with these sorts of changes. We want to try<br />
and provide opportunities for the individual to express himself<br />
not just to have a job though it is essential that there should be<br />
full employment, but to have the chance to do the sort of job<br />
which appeals to him and which he can feel happy in doing rather<br />
than one which he just has to do unhappily in order to earn a<br />
living. Now these are things you can do through education,<br />
through technological education, through the opportunity for<br />
adult education and re-education and you can do it too through<br />
expanding the opportunities in the arts and this again is<br />
something I think<br />
Q. Prime Minister, to wind up, how long would<br />
you like to remain Prime Minister?<br />
PM. Well it depends on how I am feeling. If I am<br />
feeling good and healthy I think well, you know, when I am<br />
feeling good and healthy I think it would be lovely to be there<br />
for a long time. If you get a little tired you think, oh, it's a<br />
bit wearing and it's my fault there is a drought in Queensland<br />
and I can't sleep and it's my fault that something has gone wrong<br />
somewhere else or it's my fault there is an argument in a union.<br />
This sort of thing.<br />
Q. Does any consensus come out of this?<br />
Pm. Oh well on those occasions you think to yourself,<br />
well, really I don't want to be Prime Minister for more thanl<br />
another twenty years.'<br />
Q. Prime Minister, thanks for talking to " Four<br />
Corners" </p>
