    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am saddened to learn of the passing of a great Australian public servant, Sir John Overall.</p>
<p>Sir John's contribution to this country spans a number of areas.</p>
<p>He was a distinguished soldier in the AIF in World War II, being decorated with the Military Cross and subsequently a Bar.</p>
<p>In 1952 he became the Chief Government Architect in the then Commonwealth Department of Works. He held this position until 1957 and in the following year was appointed by Prime Minister Menzies as Commissioner of the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC), the body then responsible for the planning and development of Canberra as the national capital.</p>
<p>Sir John Overall headed the NCDC until 1972 before returning to private practice. He was appointed a Member of the Parliament House Construction Authority from 1979 - 1985.</p>
<p>These years saw enormous development in Canberra with the move of many public service departments from Melbourne. Sir John's drive together with his expertise as a planner and manager, combined with his remarkable eye for how Canberra would grow, were fundamental to creating the vision that is modern Canberra.</p>
<p>Sir John Overall's contribution has already been recognised through several awards including the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1982, and notably by the naming of the ACT Planning and Land Management Offices as the John Overall Offices.</p>
<p>Apart from his many professional achievements, Sir John was a compassionate man and was closely involved with a number of charities, including serving for four years as President of the ACT Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p>
<p>He was an unwavering Christian and in July this year he drove the bulldozer which turned the sod marking the commencement of the Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture.</p>
<p>On behalf of the government, I extend my sincere condolences to Sir John's family.</p>
