VICTORIAN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT STUDY<br />
116 Victorian contracts have been analysed in a thesis in the Law Faculty at<br />
the ANU by Jocelyn Bell.<br />
She found strong evidence that workers on these contracts have experienced<br />
lost conditions and/ or lower pay. She found:<br />
0 only 1/ 5 stated that there was a wage increase<br />
the majority had penalty rates/ shift loadings reduced or removed<br />
0 1/ 3 had abolished overtime rates, and the majority reduced them<br />
0 half omitted reference to an employee representative in negotiations.<br />
She said Victorian workers on contracts gave more concessions and<br />
appeared to make fewer gains than those protected by the industrial umpire.<br />
She estimated that a retail sales worker who worked Thursday night and<br />
Saturday mornings would have lost around $ 50 a week or 15 per cent of pay<br />
from being on a contract. New entrants were particularly vulnerable.<br />
