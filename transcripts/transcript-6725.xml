    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>18 September 1985</strong></p>
<p>In the light of media reports emanating from Paris, I have sought and obtained an assurance that no member of the Australian intelligence and secur-ity community had any foreknowledge of, or involvement in, the sinking of the ' Rainbow Warrior'</p>
<p>I reiterate the Australian Government's condemnation of that cold-blooded, premeditated act of international terrorism and our support for the New Zealand Government's efforts to have the perpetrators identified and brought to justice.</p>
