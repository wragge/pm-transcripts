    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister John Howard and Premier Mike Rann today announced $12.1 million in Commonwealth and State funding to improve the economic and environmental future of the Murray River in South Australia.</p>
<p>These funds will be used to reduce salinity, improve water quality, and protect biodiversity in the Murray Darling region under the National Action Plan and National Heritage Trust.</p>
<p>  A significant part of the package will combat salination of soil and water resources.  The Bookpurnong salt interception scheme for example will result in a reduction of 133 tonnes of salt per day entering the River Murray.  Other activities to be funded include establishing a seedbank with 50 kilograms of local native seed for revegetation projects in the region and the protection of the Coorong and Lower Lakes Ramsar-listed wetlands by fencing of habitats, revegetation and monitoring.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the commitment, from the $1.4 billion joint Commonwealth and States National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, and the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust, was another indication of all governments' commitment to ensuring South Australia received its share of good quality water from the Murray River.</p>
<p>Premier Rann welcomed the funding announcement. He said funding would be channelled through the community based Murray Darling Basin  Integrated Natural Resource Management Group, the regional body developed to plan and implement Trust and National Action Plan funding along the river in South Australia.</p>
<p>Mr Howard said restoring the health of the Murray Darling Basin was one of the most important natural resource management challenges facing Australia, and success was crucial for the economic and environmental well-being of South Australia.</p>
<p>"The very strong reliance of South Australia on the Murray is well understood.  There is no issue that unites South Australians more than the need for good quality and sufficient quantity of water supply to satisfy South Australia's domestic and economic needs, and to restore the general health of the Murray River," he said.</p>
<p>"With Australian government leadership, major efforts are now underway to restore the Murray through The Living Murray process, and the National Water Initiative."</p>
<p>Under The Living Murray process Australian governments, particularly the governments of the Basin states (NSW, Victoria, SA) are committed to providing 500 gigalitres of environmental water to the Murray as a first step towards restoring it to the status of a healthy working river. Under the National Water Initiative, the Australian and State governments of the Basin have committed $500 million to address water over-allocation in the system.</p>
<p>Premier Rann said these were important early developments towards addressing the degradation of the Murray, and the threats that degradation posed to South Australia.</p>
<p>He said an important element of the projects was that they were based on decisions taken by South Australians, through structures set up by the State aimed at benefits for South Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister congratulated the South Australian Murray-Darling Integrated Resource Management Group and the regional community for developing a visionary Plan for healthier landscapes and waterways in the region.</p>
