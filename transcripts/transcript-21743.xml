    <content><![CDATA[<p>COX:</p>
<p>And on his way to unveil a forestry package, we understand in the Styx forest, is the Prime Minister, John Howard.  Mr Howard, good morning, nice to talk to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Tim, welcome back, you've had a long break they tell me.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>I have indeed, thank you very much.  And welcome back. Is this your first time here since that triumphant visit last year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it is.  I'm looking forward to going just on the edge of the Styx, I'm looking forward to the announcement this morning, it's a very balanced package, it meets our commitment to put a million hectares into reserve, and also preserve jobs.  It does involve an investment of about $250 million by the two Governments and it's been developed in a very cooperative way with the Tasmanian Government and that's very important.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>Are you expecting then a similar reception from timber workers after your last visit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm meeting most of the timber workers and their families tomorrow in Launceston, there's a national convention of timber communities from all around Australia and clearly they support the Government's policy because the Government's policy has preserved jobs.  What we've also been able to do is make a lot of steps forward on the environment as well as a result of this plan 87 per cent of the Tarkine will be protected and about 53 per cent of the Styx, including the very tall trees.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>Is it correct to assume then that part of this package is an earlier deadline, a new deadline, for the cessation of clear felling in the forests?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, there is provision for that, yes, that's something that's supported by both Governments and I think that will be supported by the community.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>I'm sure that will be supported by ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very supportive.</p>
<p>  COX:</p>
<p>Am I right in thinking that the deadline will be a two year one, is that correct?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>Was that done with the full agreement of the Labor Government in Tasmania?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Labor Government is very supportive of that, very, very supportive.  And we have found a great amount of cooperation between the two Governments, our officials have worked very conscientiously through the whole process and I welcome that.  And there's also a provision for the land clearing to be phased out in five years on public land and 10 years on private land.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>You were very positive in asserting last year that your package would not cost forest jobs...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can assert that again and in fact both Governments believe the package could lead to the creation of more jobs.  But we certainly hold by our belief, our strong belief, that that package does not involve the loss of jobs.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>How is that going to work though if there is such widespread protection of areas in the Styx and the Tarkine which of course were going to be big employers in forests?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we very carefully designed it so that the areas protected do not involve the job losses.  And when you see the maps, it's very difficult to explain over the phone, as you can appreciate, when you actually see the maps you will understand and people will understand how we have achieved our goals.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>And is there a provision in the package as well for plantations, the (inaudible) plantations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there is provision for it, it's all been done within the embrace of the Regional Forest Agreement, it's consistent with the Regional Forest Agreement principles, it involves obviously a variation of the Regional Forest Agreement and it also involves the fast-tracking alternatives to 1080 and also another water quality auditing as well.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>Okay, so the end of the 1080 (inaudible) will come earlier than forecast as well, will it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're commencing the process of phasing it out, I think that's the best way I can explain it.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>Are you confident that can be done satisfactorily?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We expect it can be and we're starting it on and I don't want to absolutely commit myself to it in every particular but we believe we can achieve it.</p>
<p>COX:</p>
<p>Alright, well how does the pulp mill which is currently in an exploratory phase in the north of the state fare under the agreement...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This will enhance the prospects for the pulp mill to go ahead.</p>
<p>  COX:</p>
<p>Alright, I must ask about the timing of this, it was meant to be announced before the end of last year but it has taken an extra four and a half months, what is the reason for that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it just took a bit longer to finetune it Tim, and there's nothing lost by that, because no jobs were under threat. It took quite a while to finetune the details of the areas to be reserved so we could be absolutely sure that we got the balance right. I saw no point in rushing to meet that timeline because nothing was lost by it taking another four months.</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>If this is [inaudible] to the forest debate here, which I am sure you would appreciate Prime Minister is a very divisive one in our community, could you in fact be delivering re-election to Paul Lennon?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am not looking at it other than from a national point of view. The Tasmanian forests are important to all Australians. The preservation of jobs in the timber communities is important to all Australians as well and I made promises during the Federal  election campaign and this agreement delivers on those promises. The question of the election in Tasmania is a matter for the two parties in Tasmania on other issues that I have the obligation to make good national policy and this is good national policy - it preserves jobs, it preserves timber communities but it also adds to environmental protection in a beautiful part of Australia.</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>It would be irony wouldn't it, if your policy had a lot of traction with voters here who perhaps might turn against Paul Lennon?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am not going to become Tasmanian political pundit Tim, I won't do that because I think the obligation I have as Prime Minister is to do the right thing by the workers of Australia and I have always put protecting the workers of Australia at the very top of my agenda whether it comes to employment, family tax benefits, family tax cuts, or anything else. Workers always come first as far as I am concerned and I certainly can say to the workers in the timber industry of Tasmania, I have delivered 100 per cent on the promise I made in Launceston on the 6th October last year.</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>Alright Prime Minister, I look forward to seeing more of the detail later today, if I could just ask you about last night.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I just have to run in a minute mate, I have got a very tight deadline.</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>I will make it as quick as I can.  Would you be prepared to call the Senate back early to get the tax cuts through as early as possible?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tim, we are hopeful that the Labor Party will see the sense of letting the tax cuts go through and we will be putting the legislation up to the Senate and asking the Labor Party to vote for the tax cuts that the Government put up and we think that is the sensible thing and we are still hopeful that the Labor Party will see the sense of letting the tax cuts go through.</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>We heard as well this morning that Australia's Consul- General to the Philippines has passed on your apologies to Vivian Solon, would you be looking to personally apologise to her?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When we get all of the details, I will have something, the Minister will have something further to say, in the meantime I have already said that I am extremely sorry for appears to have happened, it's a very sad case. It appears to be a matter of very great regret. When we have further information, no doubt the Minister will say something more. Okay?</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>Is it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I really have to go mate, I am not trying to avoid you but I am running late for the commitment in the Valley.</p>
<p> COX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister thanks for your time.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank-you, bye bye.</p>
