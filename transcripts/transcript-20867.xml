    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I was saddened to learn of Ian Henderson';s death last night after a recurrence of the illness we had all hoped he might have recovered from some months ago.</p>
<p>He will be remembered as a thoughtful and professional journalist who always sought to achieve balance and objectivity.</p>
<p>In earlier years he served the Australian Labor Party with commitment and dedication.  To his parents and Fiona Hamilton I extend my particular sympathy on their sad loss.</p>
