    <content><![CDATA[<p>This Remembrance Day marks 96 years since the guns fell silent at the end of the Great War.</p>
<p>The Great War was the crucible in which our nationâs identity was forged.</p>
<p>From a population of under five million; 417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home.</p>
<p>It was sacrifice on a stupendous scale.</p>
<p>After the Armistice, we vowed never to forget and today, we renew that vow.</p>
<p>At 11:00am, wherever we are, Australians will fall silent.</p>
<p>We pause to remember the suffering and loss that has occurred in all wars, for we are a country of memory, as well as memorials.</p>
<p>Today, we will remember the courage, achievements, pain and loss of all who have served in our name.</p>
<p>And we draw strength from their memory.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
<p>11 November 2014</p>
