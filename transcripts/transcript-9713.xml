PRIME MINISTER<br />
DOORSTOP, HERITAGLHOTEL, BRISBANE, 16 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Could I say that I was pleased that we were able to host a meeting of*<br />
the Pacific Forum Environment Ministers here in Australia, in Brisbane.<br />
This is the place where we held the last meeting of the Forum. What<br />
the Forum is considering is some material that Australia has put<br />
together, scientific material, which will allow Forum countries to better<br />
assess the environmental impacts of the testing program of the French<br />
at Mururoa.<br />
I'd like to just repeat a couple of the things that I said formally earlier<br />
and that is this is a very bad decision by France. I should have<br />
thought that international interest and the non proliferation interests<br />
would have been paramount rather than the further development of<br />
their own weapon inventory and just underline, again, that the<br />
sentiment towards this does not bear any antipathy towards the French<br />
or French culture. It is simply opposition to a bad individual decision<br />
which we would like to see changed. No doubt the Forum Leaders will<br />
consider this further at the Madang meeting and they will have<br />
something to react to in the report by the environment ministers here<br />
today. I am happy to take questions.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how strong is the scientific evidence that will be<br />
presented today?<br />
PM: I think you may get a look at that later and you can make your own<br />
judgement about it. But, at least we have pulled together the various<br />
disciplines meteorology, geology-, seismic, marine et cetera too try<br />
to make some assessment of the impact on the region and, of course,<br />
on the reef structures themselves.<br />
J: But no matter how strong that evidence is, do you think it will have any<br />
impact on the French Government?<br />
PM: I think the Government of France has misjudged international reaction<br />
to this. I'm quite sure President Chirac was probably advised that this<br />
46 ; i m i </p>
<p>would blow over quickly. The thing that probably disserves him most<br />
is public opinion in Germany and securing a high level of intensity in<br />
European opinion is the way to prosecute this argument.<br />
J: about the public, Prime Minister ( inaudible)<br />
PM: You can see it in the quite strong registration of opinion in European<br />
polls and also, I think, in the European Parliament and in France itself.<br />
J: Will the Forum pursue that?<br />
PM: We are still takingthe opportunities to proselytise on the issue. I am<br />
and I think other pBpte are too.<br />
J: Mr Keating, in relation to the matter of the Japanese apology, a lot of<br />
the other allied countries are saying that its not good enough and<br />
saying that we have been too quick to accept his apology and that in<br />
fact we are out of step, do you agree with that?<br />
PM: No, this is obviously a start of a period of reflection in Japan and<br />
securing such a comprehensive statement from the Prime Minister of<br />
Japan is a very good place to begin what is probably for the Japanese<br />
now a longer run assessment. You might notice that Prime Minister<br />
Murayama talked about telling the children of the undeniable truth and<br />
that is what it is about. I have said this before, I don't think the<br />
apology matters as much as the inculcation of the ideas, the history<br />
and the values in their community.<br />
J: So, if it is good enough for us is it good enough for England and<br />
PM: They can make their own minds up about this, but we are not in<br />
dispute, an international dispute, _ with the nation of Japan. We are<br />
debating events half a century ago.<br />
J: You say it is the beginning of a process, what more could you be<br />
satisfied with, the Australian people be satisfied with the process<br />
PM: Well, it is not the apology that matters so much. I have just said that.<br />
It is the inculcation of these values. It is like saying when will all<br />
Australian children be educated on a certain point? Well, no one can<br />
ever know, but at least it is important to start teaching the truth about<br />
this and to let this young generation of Japanese people know what<br />
really happened. That is what matters.<br />
J: Should there be an apology from the Japanese Government, but as a<br />
whole?<br />
PM: There has been over time, apologies. I don't think they matter as<br />
much again as the dissemination of the history and the inculcation ofthe<br />
values; I think that is what matters most. W. </p>
<p>J: Are the expectations and demands of the allies then too great?<br />
PM: The allies, I mean, you think that they are back there and still got the<br />
hats on, still got the helmets on?<br />
J: Prime Minister, will Nick Greiner be campaigning on behalf of Labor at<br />
the next election?<br />
PM: I think Mr Greiner has hit on a very important thing in Australian public<br />
life and that is the Australian people have got a right to know what the<br />
big picture policy options are. The Australian people have got a right<br />
to know how poians will govern Australia. They have a right to<br />
know about the directions and where Australia can be taken and how.<br />
Honour and integrity in the public debate can only come with policy<br />
and hiding from policy is not the way that Australia should be going,<br />
not the way our politics should be going at this point in our history.<br />
We need clear directions and we need them in all the things, our<br />
relationship with Asia, the development of our economy, our society,<br />
our social values. You might notice Mr Greiner talked about tax reform<br />
and the labour market. When you hear any member of the Liberal<br />
Party talk about tax reform, he is talking about the unutterable phrase<br />
a consumption tax, a GST. You see, the Liberal Party still wants a<br />
GST. Mr Greiner is hinting at it again. Mr Howard has spent all his life<br />
committed to a GST, but now he won't say it. But, of course, do the<br />
public know, that in office, they wouldn't get a GST? Well, of course,<br />
John Howard is going to run to ground on policy and Mr Greiner<br />
saying yesterday that he is risk averse, that he won't say where he<br />
stands is only a statement of the obvious, but he is condemning it as<br />
the way forward for Australia as I do because the Government has<br />
always stood and said where the policy direction should be.<br />
Remember all those Budgets and May Statements that I personally<br />
delivered 17 of them four Prime Ministerial Statements, 21 major<br />
national statements every dot point, every dotted and crossed.<br />
That is what the public should expect and that is a right they should be<br />
given. I notice that Malcolm Fraser and Tim Fischer jumped on it immediately.<br />
Tim Fischer knows exactly who Mr Greiner was talking about. He was<br />
talking about Mr Howard and Tim Fischer and Malcolm Fraser know<br />
how damaging it is for someone of Mr Greiner's standing to say that it<br />
is wrong for Mr Howard not to show the public his policy card.<br />
J: Mr Greiner now says that labour markets ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Mr Greiner knew exactly who he as speaking of Mr Howard he said<br />
he was risk averse. He wasn't referring to me. They can say many<br />
things about me, but risk averse isn't one of them and therefore this<br />
mutter this morning on radio from Mr Fraser and Mr Fischer, they knew<br />
exactly who Mr Greiner was talking . about too. What Mr Greiner is<br />
1. 4 o P" tj<br />
z, r i l . laL-li. </p>
<p>doing now is being a loyal member of the Liberal Party this morning,<br />
running the brush over the tracks, but yesterday he was making some<br />
points which we all know are correct.<br />
J: Given that the election campaign in Queensland, the Coalition ran<br />
exactly the same tactics as hiding away their policy until the campaign<br />
itself got underway, that was a virtual success, they went within a<br />
whisker of winning government. It must be of large concern to you<br />
facing a federal election with them running the same tactic?<br />
PM: It would be of greater concern to the public. Let's say they had won,<br />
what would their policy mandate be? What could they do? Anything<br />
they like. That i sy-point, honesty and integrity in politics starts with<br />
policies and I don't accept the view that it is good politics, if not good<br />
policy, I think dishonesty in this respect is both bad politics and bad<br />
policy.<br />
J: Does that mean the Queensland government may have made a<br />
mistake in its campaign?<br />
PM: Are you a local? Well, I'll leave you to make your judgements about it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is confusing the electorate by your response to John<br />
Howard in that at some stage you should say that he is a policy free<br />
zone, at another stage you should say he is to change his policy<br />
and now we are back to policy free zone...<br />
PM: Who said that?<br />
J: I am paraphrasing.<br />
PM: I think I understand the sense of your. question. Let me approach it<br />
this way. John Howard has had consistent policy prejudices. One of<br />
them is to cut the wages of working Australians. Another is to stick in<br />
a GST. Another is to get rid of Medicare. They are his policy<br />
prejudices. Another is massive cuts in government spending. So,<br />
when he says we have got to take the burden of government off the<br />
back of people, that is simply code for cutting government spending.<br />
When he talks about family friendly industrial relations policies he<br />
really means cutting the wages of working Australians. So, he is trying<br />
to keep the policy detail low, but he has got all the policy prejudices<br />
right out there in the market place. That is the position. Greiner,<br />
sharing a view, I think with me, says you can be completely honest and<br />
credible in public life by putting your policies in the market place and<br />
the Australian people have a right to know. Perhaps I'm old fashioned<br />
in the view of saying that the public have a right to know where the<br />
political parties stand, root and branch, crossed and dotted and<br />
slippery politics will take the nation nowhere. Thank you.<br />
