PRIME MINISTER ' 3 91<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
JOHN KERIN<br />
John Kerin has advised me by telephone this afternoon that he intends to resign as the<br />
Member for Werriwa early in 1994.<br />
The Federal Parliament will be poorer for the absence of John Kerin, but he has<br />
explained to me the reasons for his retirement from politics, and of course I wish him<br />
well. John Kerin, by any measure, has had a distinguished parliamentary and ministerial<br />
career. Among his many distinctions, I believe he was among the most committed and<br />
successful Primary Industries Ministers Australia has seen.<br />
As he has noted in a media statement this afternoon, John Kerin's parliamentary service<br />
to Australia and the Labor Party goes back to the days of the Whitlam Government.<br />
He was one of the " originals", and he will be missed.<br />
I note his total support for my Government, and for Labor, and his intention to<br />
continue to work closely with the rural sector to promote Australia's agricultural and<br />
trade interests. I wish him success in whatever he chooses to do.<br />
CANBERRA 3 December, 1993 </p>
