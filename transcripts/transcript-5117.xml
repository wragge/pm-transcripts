MEDIA RELEASE ' Z<br />
IMPLICATIONS OF THE TASMANIAN ELECTION<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt lion.<br />
J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
If the Tasmanian election result reflects a general<br />
feeling that the policies of spending restraint being followed<br />
by the Federal Government should be relaxed, then the<br />
implications for the nation as a whole are very serious<br />
indeed. The people of Australia elected the present Government,<br />
led by Malcolm Fraser, to provide firm, strong, even : ough<br />
leadership in the battle against inflation anJ the ev. . LSflowing<br />
from inflation.<br />
In fact there is a wide body of opinion whi( ch says<br />
that the Federal Government, far from being too tough in its<br />
approach to expenditure, has not been tough enough.<br />
Although the inflation rate of 1974-75 has been<br />
halved, with very important consequences for Australia's<br />
international competitiveness, we are clearly facing renewed<br />
inflationary pressures.<br />
We would be foolish in the extreme to abandon, or<br />
even weaken, our determination to keep inflation at the lowest<br />
possible level. If it is true that the Tasmanian result refl. ects<br />
dissatisfaction with the Commonwealth-State financial<br />
arrangements, then perhaps there is a need to remind the<br />
community that a major factor in the present very difficult<br />
budgetary situation for the Commonwealth has been its<br />
generosity in recent years to the States which, with their<br />
authorities, will this year have available to them a thousand<br />
million dollars more than last year. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Premiers who compl. ain about the financial arrangements<br />
need to be remninded that the total funds available to the<br />
States have increased more than threefold since 1972-3.<br />
On other fronts the Commonwealth has been forced,<br />
as part of the fight against inflation, to clamp down on<br />
spending. The fight against inflation is not one for the<br />
Commonwealth alone.<br />
Everyone must be involved including State<br />
Premiers and their Governments.<br />
If the Premiers cannot be convinced of the<br />
fundamental importance of expenditure res-traint, then the<br />
chances of the community as a whole being persuaded would<br />
seem to be slim indeed.<br />
Failure to achieve this understanding can only<br />
have the most serious implications for Australia's future---<br />
especially for her unemployed.<br />
