    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I was saddened to learn of the death on Saturday of Maurie Rudd, Secretary</p>
<p> of the Newcastle and Northern Regions Branch of the Australian Workers'</p>
<p> Union.</p>
<p>His death followed a long and courageous battle against cancer during</p>
<p> which he continued his work as a trade union leader with both cheerfulness</p>
<p> and skill.</p>
<p>He was a devoted family man who placed the welfare of his children</p>
<p> above everything else.</p>
<p>The union movement in the Hunter Valley has lost a fine leader. I</p>
<p> got to know Maurie well after he led a delegation of shop floor steel</p>
<p> delegates to see me last year following the announcement of the BHP</p>
<p> steelworks closure in Newcastle.</p>
<p>I well remember his good humour and strength of spirit when I visited</p>
<p> him in the John Hunter Hospital last July.</p>
<p>To his children, Sharon and Nathan, and to his brothers and sisters,</p>
<p> I extend my sympathy and that of my government.</p>
