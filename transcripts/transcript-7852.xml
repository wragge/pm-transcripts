PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH JIM WALEY, A<br />
CURRENT AFFAIR, 8 DECEMBER 1989<br />
9 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WALEY: Prime Minister, thanks for your time and<br />
congratulations on your 60th tomorrow.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Jim.<br />
WALEY: You're not getting Boft in your old age, are you?<br />
PM: No, I've never felt better, Jim.<br />
WALEY: Well everyone's remarking today about your<br />
turnaround on the pilots. Why the change?<br />
PM: It's not a turnaround Jim. There has to be the<br />
distinction made between the issue on which I was<br />
fighting and that was the protection of our wages system<br />
where I could not accept or tolerate this 30 percent<br />
claim outside the system where the AFAP had declared war<br />
on, on the system, on the, their employers, on the<br />
Arbitration Commission, on the Government, on the trade<br />
union movement<br />
WALEY: Also a recognition that you noticed that you'd<br />
overstepped the mark, perhaps, on your rhetoric and that<br />
perhaps PM: Well, I think, you know, looking back, not only in<br />
this issue, I mean, I'm now 60 years old. I look back<br />
and a lot of things in my life that, I guess if you could<br />
have a second go at your phraseology, you may have done<br />
it differently and I accept that some people may have<br />
better understood my position if I'd, if I'd explained in<br />
more detail and perhaps, somewhat differently that what<br />
my concern was the issue. But the point I'm making, the<br />
distinction has to be made between that issue where I was<br />
about protecting the interests of Australia, of all<br />
Australians, and my attitude towards the union. Given my<br />
background, Jim, I could never be party to any attempt to<br />
smash a union.<br />
WALEY: But there is an election just round the corner.<br />
Was there also a recognition that perhaps now was the<br />
time to lift your game? </p>
<p>PM: No, no.<br />
WALEY: That you weren't performing quite as<br />
PM: No.<br />
WALEY: well as you may have.<br />
PM: No, on this point, Jim, the issue has very nearly<br />
been resolved. We are at the latter stages of it. In<br />
other words, the airlines, as is now understood commonly,<br />
had substantially rebuilt the airline capacity and in<br />
that situation you now move to another stage. I had<br />
supported the airlines in taking their case because there<br />
had to be, Jim, in my judgement an independent judicial<br />
establishment of the facts. That is what was the issue?<br />
Who was responsible? And the judge has done that very,<br />
very specifically and unequivocally<br />
WALEY: But the bottom line is that with your union<br />
background, you much prefer to be a conciliator rather<br />
than a hardliner.<br />
PM% Absolutely and as I said yesterday, Jim, to the<br />
Press Club, nothing really has grieved me more in my<br />
Prime Ministership than that because of the attitude of<br />
the AFAP to this point, that role was not available to<br />
me. In other words, they were saying we're outside the<br />
system. We're not within the system within which the<br />
conciliation process can take place. Now I have been sad<br />
about that. Now what I am saying is that the judge of<br />
the Supreme Court, having estab lished that it was the<br />
pilots, to use his language, who were spoiling for the<br />
fight and that there was no conspiracy between the<br />
Government and airlines. That, importantly, has been<br />
established by an independent judicial authority. I am<br />
not about the business of damages against the trade union<br />
and that's why I said, unequivocally, that I am saying to<br />
the airlines, both the. private airline, Ansett, and the<br />
Government owned airline, Australian, that they should<br />
not press now that the point has been established, they<br />
should not press for damages because what all Australians<br />
need now, the fight, as it were, having been fought, the<br />
principle having been established and what we wvant is the<br />
complete re-establishment of the great Australian airline<br />
industry. A much more efficient one now it will be.<br />
What we need is decent relations, harmony. That sort of<br />
position is not going to be established by the extraction<br />
of damages from a. union. I don't agree with the<br />
principle, in general, and in these circumstances in<br />
particular WALEY: Have the airlines indicated that they're willing<br />
to drop their damages claim? </p>
<p>Pm: I believe that that will be the case. They have to<br />
appear before His Honour in January and I guess it will<br />
be for them a matter of Judgement as to how or when they<br />
indicate their position. That may be complicated by the<br />
responsibilities they have of appearing before His<br />
Hlonour, but I would believe, Jim, that they would respond<br />
positively to what I've said.<br />
WALEY: Well, let's hope so. Leaving aside the rights<br />
and wrongs, very briefly, what sort of damage has been<br />
done by this pilots dispute to Australia?<br />
PM: Well, it's a balance that you have to take into<br />
account. There's no doubt that some damage has been done<br />
in this period, but what you have to understand is that<br />
we will go into 1990 with a much more streamlined and<br />
efficient and more productive airline industry as far as<br />
the pilot employment is concerned. There will be a<br />
significantly lesser number of productivity of the<br />
industry will be very much higher. So in the longer term<br />
we will come out of it, tragically through this sort of<br />
process which I would have much rather seen avoided, but<br />
we will come out with a significantly enhanced, more<br />
efficient, more productive airline industry.<br />
WALEY: But on the other side of the equation, the<br />
tourist industry is on its knees. Now how long will it<br />
take to revive tourism?<br />
PM: Tourism will be able, as we go into 1990, to go back<br />
to its full growth path.<br />
WALEY: It might take a bit longer to gain the confidence<br />
overseas though.<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. if you look at the evidence<br />
of the number of the people that have come to Australia<br />
In this period, it is basically in line with the<br />
projections that were made before the dispute commenced.<br />
WALEY: So back to normal by mid 1990, the end of 1990?<br />
PM: No, certainly by mid 1990. There is no reason at<br />
all, in terms of internal airline capacity, why that<br />
can't be happening in the beginning of 1990.<br />
WALEY: The big message from your speech yesterday to the<br />
National Press Club was, of course, about the economy.<br />
That we have to endure the pain, it was worthwhile during<br />
this period of restructuring yet you still held out the<br />
promise of lower interest rates. When will that happen<br />
and how long will they stay down?<br />
PM: Could I go to the first part of your question, then<br />
to interest rates, Jim? The essence of my message, and<br />
I'll try and make it as brief as I can<br />
WALEY: Please, yes. </p>
<p>PM: it is rather complex, but I'm saying there is no<br />
single measure of how we, as an Australian commrunity<br />
together, are progressing along the path of<br />
reconstructing the Australian economy. You can't simply<br />
use the measure of lower real wages because, as part of<br />
the lower real wages, what has happened are two things.<br />
As you'Ive got lower real wages, there'Is been a move to<br />
profits, from profits, increased profits, into the<br />
highest investment we've ever had in our country. That<br />
investment is doing two things. It's sustaining record<br />
employment growth, but it is also, importantly, reequipping<br />
and restructuring the Australian economy so<br />
that it will be more efficient in the future. Access<br />
Economics, has that' s the body used by the Oppositionhas<br />
said there are some $ 90 billion of projects either<br />
under construction, committed or under serious<br />
consideration and when they all come on stream that will<br />
generate an additional $ 10 billion of foreign earnings<br />
for us.<br />
WALEY: That's long term. What about the short term?<br />
PM: Well some, no, no, some that, Jim, of that that's<br />
under construction, that will be coming on stream<br />
earnings in 1990. Some of it. So it's immediate, medium<br />
end longer term. So that's one thing that's happening as<br />
a result of the lowering of real wages. We are, as a<br />
community, now setting in place those benefits for the<br />
future. The second thing, of course, is that as our part<br />
of the bargain of the trade unions accepting lower real<br />
wages, we've massively increased the social wage.<br />
Without boring you, or your viewers, Jim, with all the<br />
details of those things, just by way of example and I<br />
think it's terribly important as far as Australian<br />
families are concerned we have poured massively<br />
increased resources into education, both into the system<br />
and also to families, we've more than doubled the<br />
secondary education allowance to lower and middle income<br />
families. The result? When the Liberals walked out of<br />
office only 36 percent of our kids staying on in the<br />
education system, it only increased that retention rate<br />
by two percentage points from 34 to 36 in their seven<br />
years WALEY: Prime Minister<br />
PM: We've lifted that to 61 percent. Now that's part of<br />
the social wage<br />
WALEY: That is accepted, but I mean the immediate hurt<br />
is on interest rates, now<br />
PM: Well, I'm coming to interest rates. I mean, I had<br />
to answer your question in two parts.<br />
WALEY: OK. </p>
<p>PM: I was giving the message that if you make the<br />
judgement about hurt and part of the hurt has been the<br />
reduction in real wages, then you've got to see what has<br />
happened in terms of benefits. Interest rates. That is<br />
the result of the fact that our economy is growing so<br />
rapidly. I mean, we are having such a high level of<br />
economic activity, that we are sucking in a level of<br />
imports, such a high level of imports, that our exports<br />
won'It pay for. So we have to somewhat dampen down the<br />
level of activity and to do that in addition to tight<br />
fiscal policy and tight wages policy we have to have<br />
tight monetary policy. And what I am saying is that the<br />
signs are now emerging quite clearly that those interest<br />
rates are having the effect. There is a gradual slowing<br />
down. That's why I say to you, and to your viewers, Jim,<br />
that together all of us who've exercised that restraint,<br />
Government has cut its expenditures, the restraint has<br />
been exercised by the community, interest rates have<br />
played their part. I believe that as we go into the<br />
1990s that evidence will become stronger and the<br />
conditions will be there for a lowering of Interest<br />
rates. WALEY: Before the end of the financial year?<br />
PM: I believe so.<br />
WALEY: And will they stay down?<br />
PM: I believe so in terms of the Australian conditions.<br />
In other words, an Australian economy is influenced by<br />
two things. It's influenced by what we do ourselves, not<br />
just Government, but the community. My judgement is in<br />
terms of what the Government is doing and how the<br />
community is responding, yes, that we can do that. Now<br />
if you had a situation externally where you had a total<br />
collapse of our terms of trade, for instance, I don't<br />
believe that's going to happen, but to be honest with<br />
you, fully honest with you in answer to your question,<br />
will they stay down. Provided the international economy<br />
continues to operate on steady levels of output growth<br />
as the predictions are internationally that it will and,<br />
therefore, we will not have a collapse in our terms of<br />
trade then I don't believe there are external reasons<br />
why that move down our interest rate structure can not be<br />
sustained. WALEY: Maybe that was one of the provisos that Andrew<br />
Peacock was thinking about this morning when he predicted<br />
that yes, indeed, interest rates will come down early<br />
next year but they will not be sustainable. </p>
<p>PM: yes, well, of course, I don't want to say this in a<br />
harsh, personal sense, but it is the universal judgemnent,<br />
the universal judgement of his colleagues, of the<br />
commientators here in Canberra and of all analysts and<br />
business people who've met with Peacock, that he simply<br />
doesn't know, he simply doesn't know anything about<br />
economics. WALEY: Could there be an element of truth though in what<br />
he said?<br />
PM: No. Not on this issue. I mean, when you have a man<br />
who says in regard to the central issue of what happens<br />
to the Australian economy, that is, wages outcome, that<br />
is the central issue which will determine the whole of<br />
the economic outcome. When asked specifically at his<br />
Press conference, what will be those outcomes? He throws<br />
up his hands in hopelessness and says whole to know.<br />
WALEY: OK. Let's move on to the economy. You mentioned<br />
a moment ago that<br />
PM: I thought we'd been on it, mate.<br />
WALEY: Well yes but the slowing of the economy.<br />
PM: Yes sure, sure.<br />
WALEY: Obviously there's a lag in official rates when<br />
they are Issued. One of the dangers of tight monetary<br />
policy if in fact it is biting is the fact that it<br />
will take effect quite suddenly and dramatically. Are<br />
you taking steps to ease the brake, so to speak, at the<br />
right time so that the country doesn't dip into<br />
recession? PM: Absolutely.<br />
WALEY: In what way?<br />
PM: Well that's the centrally important It is the<br />
important question. I congratulate you for asking it. I<br />
mean the fine art of economic management now, Jim, is to<br />
watch all the indicators as to what's happening in the<br />
economy. They really fall into two categories. There<br />
are the official statistics. For instance, the recently<br />
issued national accounts figures together with official<br />
statistics on housing and so on in investment. But<br />
secondly and very, importantly, there is the anecdotal<br />
evidence. What we are constantly doing, Jim, is getting<br />
feed in for instance, from BHP, what's happening to steel<br />
sales, what's happening to steel imports, those imports<br />
which they bring in for their own purposes. And for<br />
instance, they indicate to us that the signs there are of<br />
a slow down. We are also in constant contact with the<br />
retailing industry. So you combine </p>
<p>WXLEY: Are they telling you though, that there is a slow<br />
down? pM: Both of them are telling us that the evidence of a<br />
slow down is there.<br />
WALEY: Dramatically 6o?<br />
PM: Sufficiently so. Now what you have to do, Jim, that<br />
is Government and the Reserve Bank, what we have to do is<br />
to watch those indicators and be extremely responsible<br />
about it. The worst thing I could do, Jim, to your<br />
viewers would be in terms of trying to get some immediate<br />
electoral acclaim, is to say whack interest rates down<br />
now. We've got to be certain that the impact is there,<br />
that the economy is slowing down sufficiently for us to<br />
ease rates off.<br />
WALEY: I guess what I'm asking you is there going to be<br />
a recession?<br />
PM: No. I know that's the point of the question. No<br />
and the fine art of economic management to have the<br />
easing off at the point where you can be confident that<br />
the slowing down of the economic activity has occurred<br />
enough so that the easing off will mean that in the<br />
jargon of the economists, to get the soft landing, that<br />
is you ease it off at the point where if the economy is<br />
not dipping down like that. It's come from here, gone<br />
down a little bit, and getting to a plateau level which<br />
will still be economic growth to sustain employment<br />
growth. WALEY: Prime Minister, can we take a break at this<br />
stage? PM: Sure.<br />
WALEY: Do you think at a time when many within Cabinet<br />
are calling for perhaps softer measures, that the<br />
Treasurer will hold out and be too fanatical, too hard<br />
line? PM: Jim, the premise of your question is not soundly<br />
based. The Cabinet supports the responsible approach.<br />
It's not correct to describe it as a hard approach, it is<br />
the responsible approach.<br />
WALEY: With the incidence of high interests rates fairly<br />
hard? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, but it's responsible, I mean, as I've said and I<br />
don't want to keep repeating this phrase, but it's<br />
important. I am neither sadist nor am I masochist. In<br />
other words the last thing I want them to do, I haven't<br />
been in Australian public life for thirty years to want<br />
to hurt Australians, the opposite is true. Now I am not a<br />
masochist, I don't went to hurt myself. But what we have<br />
to do Is to get that position where the great advance<br />
that we, as Australians, have made together towards<br />
restructuring the Australian economy, which is<br />
acknowledged it is happening. We mustn't prejudice that<br />
by just allowing a splurge of activity now which would<br />
destroy everything, because if you allowed activity just<br />
to splurge at this rate we couldn't sustain that level of<br />
imports and then the exchange rate would collapse,<br />
interest rates would go through the roof and we're into<br />
recession. So you can describe it as hard but it is<br />
necessarily hard if you want to use that, because in<br />
terms of benefits, enduring benefits for Australians, we<br />
mustn't allow the economy to collapse in that way. As a<br />
result of this policy we will be able to have the easing<br />
easing off of rates next year and in that situation<br />
weo will have retained all the benefits of growth and of<br />
restructuring. WALEY: So no disagreement between you or Paul Keating on<br />
policy? FM: Or within the Cabinet, Jim.<br />
WALEY: How are you getting on with the Treasurer these<br />
days? PM: I would think it's true to say that our relations<br />
have never been better.<br />
WALEY: Categorically?<br />
PM: Ye8.<br />
WALEY: OK. You turn 60 tomorrow, seven years almost of<br />
Labor Power. Do you agree that there's a perception out<br />
there, perhaps, that after so long, you turning 60, that<br />
Labor's looking a little bit tired, a little bit jaded? </p>
<p>PM: No, on the contrary. I mean, if you look at the<br />
level of activity and the importance of decisions that<br />
have been taken, I would think it's probably true to say,<br />
Jim, there hasn't been a period in our office when we<br />
have been making more important decisions more regularly.<br />
I mean, without being exhaustive just let me refer to<br />
some of them internally and externally. Externally first,<br />
we just had here in November an historic meeting as the<br />
result of the initiative I took at the beginning of this<br />
year. For the first time the countries of the Asian<br />
Pacific Region have met here in Canberra as a result of<br />
my initiative in January in Seoul and they have met and<br />
acknowledged and paid tribute to my Government for the<br />
initiative, and as a basis of that we now have the<br />
momentum towards this Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation<br />
which is going to be enormously important for the region<br />
and tremendously important for Australia.<br />
WALEY: So you feel that there's a confident young image<br />
about the present Government, do you?<br />
PM: Well, it certainly should be an image of confidence<br />
because it goes back to the questions you have been<br />
putting. I mean, it would have been, if we weren't<br />
confident, if we were weak we would have wobbled around<br />
and said no we'll cut interest rates back immediately.<br />
WALEY: Let me put it another way. The National Executive<br />
has been meeting today, and as I understand it changing<br />
the rules for some of the candidates. Does this mean that<br />
there's a recognition there, you need brighter, younger<br />
blood? PM: No, no. This goes back to an issue which has been<br />
before the Federal Executive going back for two or three<br />
years. It's a question of preselection rules in New<br />
South Wales. There's a general recognition that there<br />
could be room for improvement in the preselection<br />
processes. But that goes back some time and let me say<br />
this, that the existing preselection processes not only<br />
in New South Wales, but in other States produced a<br />
situation that when I became Prime Minister in 1983 there<br />
was an enormous range of talent that was there, so much<br />
so that the Shadow Treasurer, Dr llewson, said just a<br />
couple of years ago, that the Hawks Cabinet is the most<br />
talented Cabinet since the war. He was right then and it<br />
remains true today.<br />
WALEY: OK. You say you'll retire If you lose the<br />
election. PM: Now let me say that was entirely hypothetical, Jim,<br />
and I said I don't believe that will happen, and I don't<br />
say that in a cocky way. I realise that we've got to work<br />
hard to be re-elected. We will work hard to retain the<br />
confidence of the Australian people. The question, then<br />
what Mr Hawks despite that you would lose. I said, well<br />
I think in those circumstances I would retire. </p>
<p>a WALEY: But you'd stay on for another three years, at<br />
least, if you won?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
WALEY: you feel you only have a contribution to make if<br />
you win?<br />
PM: No. But I would think, that's why I said I think I<br />
would retire, I mean, obviously I'd be guided by my<br />
Party, Jim. I mean, if they said to me, in those<br />
circumstances, and pressed enormously, we want you to<br />
stay, well, I would have to give that consideration. But<br />
I just make the point that this year, at the end of this<br />
year, where we are now, I have been in public life for<br />
thirty years, ten years as the Research Officer and<br />
Advocate for the ACTU, ten years as President of the<br />
ACT), ten years in the Parliament, and seven of those<br />
years as Prime Minister. Now that's a long time in<br />
public life and I am eternally grateful to the Australian<br />
people for having given me the proud honour and privilege<br />
of being the Prime Minister of the greatest country on<br />
earth. I've been there a long time, I had no definition<br />
of 8 life before Parliament, there is a life after<br />
Parliament. If the view of my Party, and, in a sense, the<br />
people, was that they wanted to stay there in Opposition<br />
I would have to give that serious consideration because<br />
without, I hope, sounding mawkish the thing that<br />
dominates me is my love of this country.<br />
WALEY: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I guess, I mean, I would be a remarkable individual<br />
if I hadn't and I would be a singularly unintelligent<br />
person if I hadn't. I mean, as Prime Minister you have a<br />
unique opportunity to learn even more about your country<br />
and also, Jim, to learn about the international context<br />
within which we operate.<br />
WALEY: Still retain a sense of humility?<br />
PM: I am a mixture of pretty supreme confidence in my<br />
capacities. I say that directly. I do have a supreme<br />
confidence in my capacities. A mixture of that and also,<br />
I don't know whether I would describe it as humility, but<br />
it has been said and I think it is correct that I am one<br />
of the best listeners in public life. I do listen, I<br />
mean, I have this. love of people, I mix with people, I<br />
listen to them as well as talking to them and call that<br />
humility or what, I don't know, but I believe that you<br />
can always learn in life, and certainly as Prime Minister<br />
you can always learn, Jim, from listening, absorbing<br />
things. So it's a mixture of, as I say, supreme<br />
confidence in my capacities, but also a knowledge that I<br />
can perform better the more I listen. </p>
<p>11.<br />
WALEY: What does a 60 year old Prime Minister Bob Hawke<br />
do on his birthday, go to the races?<br />
PM: No, he won't be going to the races. He'll be swamped<br />
in the morning, joyfully, by his grandchildren which, of<br />
course, is one of the great joys of my life. I mean I<br />
can't describe the pleasure I get from my family.<br />
WALEY: Big family reunion?<br />
PM: Yes. They'll all, except my two little grandsons, who<br />
are up in the North West of Western Australia, but my son<br />
will be there, my two daughters and four of my<br />
grandchildren, they'll be all over me in the morning and<br />
then later on in the morning I'll try to pick a few<br />
winners and place a few bets.<br />
WALEY: So it's a family day?<br />
PM: Oh very much so. I'll watch a bit of cricket I<br />
suppose tomorrow afternoon and then tomorrow night we're<br />
having a party.<br />
WALEY: What about Clem, your father?<br />
PM: Remarkable, he's now nearly 93. 1 see him as often<br />
an I can. I've seen him two or three times in the last<br />
few weeks.<br />
WALEY: You're very close to him aren't you?<br />
PM: I love him.<br />
WALEY: What will you say to him tomorrow.<br />
PM: Be well and thanks for everything you have done for<br />
me. WALEY: What's he done for you?<br />
PM: Well, he's passed on to me the fundamental beliefs I<br />
have and that Is that we are in this world, not just to<br />
advance our own interests, but we owe an obligation to<br />
our fellow human beings and I think you have heard me<br />
quote before the thing that he said to me that has always<br />
stuck in my mind, he said, Bob, he said, if there is a<br />
belief in the fatherhood of God, then that, inevitably,<br />
has the corollary of a belief in the brotherhood of man.<br />
That's, I suppose, if I had to say what I owe most to my<br />
father it is the implanting in me of that belief.<br />
WALEY: It's been another Red Letter Day this week and<br />
that was your son Stephen receiving a Human Rights Award<br />
from no less than Mrs Hlawke. He's a very independent man<br />
isn't he? </p>
<p>r ends 12.<br />
PM: He's a remarkable young man. He has a brilliant mind,<br />
a brilliant intellect. When he was doing his HSC in<br />
Melbourne he left the school he was at, Melbourne<br />
Grammar, he didn't like that, left there in that HSC<br />
year, went uprooted himself went to another school,<br />
was hit with glandular fever, was knocked out a couple of<br />
months or so before the exam and got brilliant results,<br />
you know 100 in mathematics and these sorts of things. I<br />
mean, it's just not the pride of a parent, he's got 8<br />
brilliant mind, could have been anything, could have done<br />
anything, but he's devoted his life to the most<br />
underprivileged group in the country, the Aboriginal<br />
people, devoted his whole life to that. He could have<br />
been anything if he had been concerned with Just his own<br />
advancement, could have been anything, and yes, I am very<br />
proud of him.<br />
WALEY: Prime Minister, I guess when we all turn 60 we are<br />
entitled to shed a few tears. Congratulations and thanks<br />
for your time.<br />
PM: Particularly when you talk about my Dad. -He's been<br />
a truly remarkable man. I don't think I've ever met<br />
anyone of whom I could say that I don't know that they've<br />
ever done anything crook in their life. He's been, to<br />
me, something very special.<br />
WALEY: Indeed. Thank you, Sir.<br />
PM: Thanks. </p>
