j1 UTAI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 February 1984<br />
All State Governments and companies at today's meeting on<br />
prospects for co-operation between the Australian and<br />
Chinese iron and steel industries expressed strong interest<br />
in and support for the initiative.<br />
The point of contact on the initiative between Australia<br />
and China will be a joint working party of the Australia<br />
China Joint Trade Committee..<br />
The Austral * ian contribution to the joint study will be<br />
based on exchanges of viewpoints and information with<br />
State Governments, the trade unions and Australian<br />
companies. Senior federal representatives will return. to China<br />
in early April to outline Australian views on the<br />
range of the jpint study. They will also explain the<br />
organisational support that will be provided to pursue<br />
the iron and steel co-operation initiative.<br />
The meeting today involved State Governments and major<br />
commercial parties who could foreseeably be involved<br />
in the initiative between the iron and steel industries<br />
of Australia and China.<br />
I have already had contact with the President and Secretary<br />
of the ACTU about this matter and there will be further<br />
meetings with representatives of the trade union movement.<br />
During today's meeting I detailed what had taken place in<br />
discussions with the Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and other<br />
Ministers in Beijing. Discussions included agreement to<br />
promote closer co-operation between the Chinese and<br />
Australian steel industries in the areas of:<br />
prospects for increased Australian iron ore<br />
exports to China<br />
propsects for increased Australian iron and steel<br />
exports to China<br />
possible Australian investment in joint ventures in<br />
the Chinese steel industry<br />
prospects for technical co-operation in upgrading<br />
Chinese coastal steel mills<br />
possible Chinese investment in iron ore mining in<br />
Australia. </p>
