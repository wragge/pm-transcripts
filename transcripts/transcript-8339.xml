Students of -the School<br />
In a country as young as ours there are not many<br />
institutions as old as Christian Brothers High School,<br />
Lewisham. 100 years young and still going strong that bears great<br />
witness to the dedication and commitment of the Christian<br />
Brothers to ' the service of the young on the western side of<br />
Sydney, beginning at a time when it was not very fashionable<br />
to move west.<br />
Why, in those days Lewisham was like Penrith!<br />
Christian Brothers, Lewisham has seen some 14,000 students<br />
through its classrooms in those 100 years.<br />
They have distinguished themselves in every walk of life in<br />
this great c: Lty and throughout our great country. There<br />
have been a remarkable number, perhaps some would say a<br />
disproportionate number, of politicians.<br />
But tonight, I want to single out one as an example and I am<br />
sure that not: one of the 14,000 would begrudge me doing so.<br />
I refer to ViLctor Chang, who was a student here from 1953 to<br />
1955. Dr Chang was a great Australian not only because he had<br />
special skills which literally gave life to so many of his<br />
fellow Australians and to others beyond our shores, but<br />
because he was a fully participating citizen of this country<br />
of ours. I am sure he learned much of that here at this<br />
school. </p>
<p>2<br />
In a few minutes I will be honoured to present the first<br />
Victor Chang memorial award for chemistry. This award will<br />
keep alive the memory of a remarkable Australian in future<br />
generations of students in a way he would have thought<br />
appropriate, and I congratulate the school for commemorating<br />
his tragically too short life in this way.<br />
1891 the year of the founding of your school also saw the<br />
first constitutional convention in Sydney. This was the<br />
beginning of a tortuous process of writing the Australian<br />
constitution. It took another ten years to make Federation<br />
a reality.<br />
Australia has a decade to go before it achieves its<br />
centenary. But the events of the past few years have shown<br />
us that the ideas and impulse of country and nation often<br />
run older and deeper than the arbitrary timing of political<br />
leaders.<br />
The idea of one nation in one island continent always had<br />
the appeal of commonsense. Never forgetting the fact that<br />
the Aborigines had created their own remarkable culture here<br />
over the preceding 40 or 50,000 years, each of the colonies<br />
had been founded and settled by people from Great Britain<br />
though I don't suppose the Irish parents of the early pupils<br />
at Christian Brothers, Lewisham were too keen on the<br />
description. But commonsense very nearly did not prevail in the<br />
referendums that eventually brought about the one<br />
Commonwealth of Australia. It took two rounds to convince a<br />
sufficient number of the people in the colony of New South<br />
Wales to join, and the colony of West Australia did not come<br />
aboard until the very last minute.<br />
It was not pre-ordained that we should become one nation; it<br />
is one of our great strokes of good fortune that we became<br />
one. But, of course, it wasn't just good luck. It happened<br />
because we had men of vision and purpose like Parkes,<br />
Griffith, Deakin, Barton, Reid, Watson, Higgins and<br />
Kingston. And, in the final analysis, it happened because<br />
of the determination of the men and women of Australia<br />
themselves. Between the idea and the reality the idea of 1891, the<br />
reality of 1991, was to lie generations of hard work,<br />
dedication and sacrifice. And five generations of Christian<br />
Brothers pupils have been part of it all.<br />
As we look forward to 2001, and the centenary of the<br />
Australian Federation, it is worth taking a quick look back<br />
at what else was happening in 1891.<br />
In 1891 were laid the foundations of this school, the<br />
Australian Labor Party, and Australia itself. Not a bad<br />
trifecta. </p>
<p>3<br />
Ahead of Australians then were two depressions, one just<br />
around the corner in the 1890s, and the Great Depression of<br />
the 1930s; two world wars, the rise and fall of f ascism and<br />
communism, unprecedented technological change which has<br />
served as an instrument of both good and evil, and here in<br />
Australia the building of an independent, tolerant, educated<br />
and democratic society.<br />
Let me take -each of those words independent, tolerant,<br />
educated, demiocratic to measure the change we have<br />
experienced over these 100 years.<br />
1zndep~ ndent: from six colonies relying on distance and the<br />
strength of the royal navy for its security, we have become<br />
a truly independent nation, self-reliant in defence, a<br />
nation whose voice is heard and respected in the world.<br />
The protection we asked and expected from Britain 100 years<br />
ago was based upon our fear of living isolated in the Asia-<br />
Pacific region. Now we proudly identify ourselves as an<br />
integral part of this most dynamic region, co-operating with<br />
our neighbours and enmeshing our destiny with theirs.<br />
Tolerant: that deep seated fear of our neighbours itself<br />
produced a singularly restrictive immigration policy.<br />
We cannot disgui -se the fact that this policy carried deep<br />
undertones of racial superiority directed not just against<br />
Asians, but, in fact, the majority of the European peoples.<br />
Now we have become one of the most diverse peoples on Earth,<br />
and we are all the richer and the better for it. We need<br />
not run away from the facts of the past. Rather, we can<br />
take pride in the victory of tolerance and intelligence,<br />
over mindless prejudice.<br />
However, we should not ignore the fact that we still,<br />
unfortunately, hear in our society some voices echoing that<br />
mindless racial intolerance of the past. The very name of<br />
Victor Chang an immortal Australian should still those<br />
voices forever.<br />
And I will deal with an aspect of our progress towards an<br />
Pdntpd, Australia in the context of intolerance.<br />
Because, when this school was founded in 1891, Catholic<br />
schools were denied all rights to community assistance<br />
' state aid' as it used to be called.<br />
It is one of the great transformations of the Australian<br />
society in my lifetime that the rampant sectarianism which<br />
divided and disfigured our community for well over a century<br />
has been consigned to where it has always belonged to the<br />
dustbin of discredited history.<br />
The real victims of that sectarianism were the children, the<br />
children of government schools as much as Catholic schools,<br />
because as long as it dominated the education debate, the </p>
<p>4<br />
quality of all education and the standards of All schools<br />
suffered. When I became Prime Minister in 1983, we still<br />
suffered from the overhang of the State Aid debate. I<br />
committed myself to eradicating it as an issue once and for<br />
all. We have achieved that.<br />
And here I pay tribute to the Christian Brothers, whose<br />
dedication, in the old days of denial, kept great schools<br />
like this going so splendidly.<br />
And finally, I described the Australia of today as a great<br />
damnrany. We are all now living through some of the most momentous<br />
times in modern history.<br />
And the powerhouse of this great revolution in human affairs<br />
is the yearning of men and women all over the world to be<br />
free, to have the democratic institutions which Australia<br />
has, all too easily, all too often, seemed to take for<br />
granted. I am sure that none of your generation, if you think<br />
seriously about the tremendous events you see literally<br />
unfolding before you on television, will ever take for<br />
granted your inheritance of an independent, tolerant,<br />
educated and above all, democratic Australia.<br />
I salute this great institution Christian Brothers High<br />
School, Lewisham for the signal role it has played in<br />
fashioning that inheritance for which we are, all, the<br />
richer. </p>
