FOR PRESS: PM No 82/ 1972<br />
LABOR'S HEALTH NATIONALISATION PLANS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. William McMahon,<br />
C. H. M. P.<br />
The statement of Mr. W. G. Hayden, that Labor<br />
would not attempt to introduce a system of salaried medical<br />
services and that such an action would be constitutionally<br />
impossible requires the closest analysis.<br />
It is in direct conflict with the Labor Party platform<br />
and the statements of his leader Mr. Whitlam and his colleagues.<br />
The simple truth is that there is no constitutional<br />
disbarment at all. The Labor Party could and would nationalise<br />
the medical and hospital professions by the process of " squeeze".<br />
Its policies are aimed to do just that.<br />
A penetrating insight into the Labor Party's mass<br />
Socialist intentions was given by Mr. Whitlam in his 1972<br />
Fabian Lecture in Melbourne on 25 July.<br />
The main theme of that address was his rejection of<br />
the argument that the constitution offers any obstacle to full<br />
socialisation. He said: " It would be intolerable if a Labor Government<br />
were to use the alibi of the constitution to excuse failure to<br />
achieve its Socialist objectives doubly intolerable because<br />
it is just not true that it need do so".<br />
He added: " My basic proposition is this: If Section 92<br />
is held up as the bulwark of private enterprise, then Section 96<br />
is the charter of public enterprisc Section 51 the key to<br />
National responsibility and national regeneration".<br />
Section 96 permits the Commonwealth to make grants to<br />
the States for special purposes. By this device by the<br />
offering or withholding of funds a Socialist central government<br />
could reduce the States to mere puppets. ./ 2 </p>

But fir. Whitlam has been even more specific with<br />
regard to Labor's health policies. In the same lecture he said:<br />
" The major act of nationalisa-io in the traditional sense, to<br />
be undertaken by a Labor government in the next term, will be<br />
through the establishment of a single health fund, administered<br />
by a Health Insurance Commission w-ith contributions' made accorded<br />
to each tax payers means and treatment accorded to each patient s_<br />
needs'.' Those are plain enough words. Everyone should know<br />
what " nationalisation in the traditional sense" means. The<br />
warning is clear.<br />
The A. C. T. U. President, Mr. Hawke, at the opening of<br />
the Federal campaign in the Shortland seat confirmed on<br />
3 September that the A. L. P. was a Socialist party and that he had<br />
no respect for any person who denied this.<br />
The Labor Party h1as made it clear that all medical<br />
specialists at public hospitals under its policy would be fully<br />
salaried and not on a fee-for-scrvice or sessional payment.<br />
This is the essential instrument of nationalisation of<br />
medical specialists call of whom must have full access to<br />
hospitals in order to pursue their profession.<br />
Two other squeezes will operate on the specialists.<br />
T~ rhe Labor Party's single nationalised health insurance commission<br />
will provide benefits for public wards only, unlike the existing<br />
voluntary schemes which provide full cover for intermediate and<br />
private wards. Labor's policy, which must reduce drastically the<br />
number of intermediate and private wards in public hospitals and<br />
force almost everyone into public wards, would seriously restrict<br />
the many specialists now in private oractice who function today<br />
mainly in non-public wards, except in the discharge of their<br />
honorary duties. / 3I </p>
