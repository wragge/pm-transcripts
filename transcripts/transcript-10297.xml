2 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERV[ EW WITH FRAN KELLY AM PROGRAMME<br />
E O E<br />
KELLY:<br />
Prime Minister, you said that this wasn't a fence mending trip to China, but are the<br />
fences mended now anyway?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have a very good relationship. It's much better as a result of this visit. It's based<br />
on the twin pillars of mutual benefit and mutual respect. It's a relationship that has a<br />
very heavy economic focus. We have made some positive gains on that front over the<br />
last few days with the hope of more to come. Given the size of China it's very<br />
important that Australia have a good working relationship but a relationship that<br />
reflects the fact that we are different societies. We have our values which we defend<br />
and won't compromise. Equally, China has her way of doing things which we<br />
understand and respect.<br />
KELLY: Well, in concrete terms what's come from this trip?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, in concrete terms we have the ANZ Bank license. We have the prospect of<br />
progress in a number of the commodity areas. We have the arrival in, I think, July of<br />
this year of a team from China that will conduct a feasibility study about a directly<br />
reduced iron process that could open up I stress could an export market of half a<br />
billion dollars a year and create 2 000 jobs in Western Australia and involve the use of<br />
large volumes of LNG. There is also the hard to quantify but nonetheless tangible<br />
benefit of the increased person-to-person business links. I took with me the most<br />
powerful delegation of businessmen and women that have ever accompanied an </p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister abroad. They established very good contacts. The<br />
Australian Stock Exchange had a seminar which explained the benefits of listing and<br />
brought many Chinese people in business into contact with the services in the financial<br />
sector that are available. So they're very significant benefits.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Prime Minister in terms of human rights, you've proposed a dialogue on human rights.<br />
The Chinese Government's pointed out today that there was a dialogue that existed<br />
before Tianamin Square. Paul Keating proposed a dialogue again when he visited in<br />
1993 and you're still asking for it. What is new about the approach that you've<br />
suggested? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we have a new government and we're going to pursue it. I didn't take the<br />
proposition lightly when I put it and we intend to pursue it and it will be pursued.<br />
KELLY: Today the Chinese Foreign Ministry welcomed the notion of a dialogue but they made<br />
it clear that it was conditional on Australia not sponsoring any UN resolutions<br />
condemning China on human rights as we have done since Tianamin Square. Will the<br />
Australian Government meet that condition?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we will make a decision on that UN resolution if and when the time comes for<br />
such a decision. It's not at all clear to me as to whether that resolution is going to<br />
come up again and if it does well we'll then make a decision. I'm not going to<br />
telegraph what that decision will be, we haven't taken it yet. But we will obviously<br />
take it based upon a proper assessment of all of the things that you ought to take into<br />
account on something like that. I'm not acknowledging for a moment any formal link<br />
between those two things.<br />
KELLY: Are you happy with China putting that condition, or appearing to put that condition,<br />
on a dialogue taking place?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well what I'm saying is I'm not sort of accepting any conditionality.<br />
KELLY:<br />
China is essentially saying though, isn't it, that it will enter a dialogue on human rights<br />
but only if Australia changes its stance that, in other words, the link is conditional? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that wasn't said yesterday in my discussion with the Chinese Premier, nor was it<br />
said by him over dinner last night when we discussed it. The Foreign Ministry might<br />
put out some kind of formal blurb but there wasn't an element of conditionality<br />
yesterday. Look, we will make a decision on the UN resolution according to our own<br />
assessment of that if the circumstances arise. We've put a proposition in relation to a<br />
dialogue. The two are not formally linked as far as we are concerned.<br />
KELLY: And how was that proposition received then both in the talks and over dinner by the<br />
Premier, Li Peng?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I thought quite well. But these things take time. We had to get the right balance.<br />
We had to pursue our national interests. We also had to make it plain to our hosts that<br />
things like human rights issues could never be regarded as out of bounds in a<br />
relationship between Australia and China and that is why I handled it in the way that I<br />
did and I think it was the right balance.<br />
ends. </p>
