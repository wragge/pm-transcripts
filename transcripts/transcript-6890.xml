* PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, WASHINGTON<br />
18 ' APRIL 1986<br />
E 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
REAGAN: I am pleased to meet with Prime Minister Bob Hawke<br />
today, although I was somewhat disappointed that he didn't bring<br />
the America's Cup with him. Prime minister Hawke is a personal<br />
friend and a valued counsellor. And I can't overstate the value<br />
America attaches to its relationship with Australia, especially<br />
as that nation now approaches a very special year.<br />
We look forward to participating in the festivities of<br />
Australia's 1988 Bicentennial. our countries share many<br />
historical experiences: our love of democracy, our frontier<br />
heritage, and our common defence of freedom from the first and<br />
second World Wars, through Korea and Vietnam all this has<br />
nurtured the bonds of friendship between our two peoples. Today<br />
the United States and Australia as much as ever rely on each<br />
other. Australia is a responsible ANZUS ally, an important<br />
trading partner and a trusted friend.<br />
Our discussions in the White House today covered a variety of<br />
issues. In the area of trade, the United States will be<br />
responsive to the extent we can to Australian interests. In<br />
international agriculture, we have a common goal, we will<br />
continue to work together to keep open international trade and<br />
export markets. International agricultural trade problems should<br />
be given attention in upcoming international economic meetings,<br />
including the next round of multilateral trade negotiations. We<br />
seek truly free international agricultural markets. Necessary<br />
interim measures to counter unfair subsidisation, like our own<br />
export enhancement program, should take account of the interests<br />
of friends like Australia. Prime minister Hawke has been assured<br />
of this, and we will, or course, continue our dialogue on this<br />
important subject.<br />
On other matters, we reaffirmed the importance of security<br />
co-operation among Pacific states. The stabilising role that<br />
ANZUS plays has been essential to the phenomenal growth that the<br />
Pacific region has enjoyed during the last decade. It's hoped<br />
that New Zealand will soon return to its traditional role as a<br />
responsible ANZUS member. We would greatly regret it if this<br />
valued partner declined to take the actions that would permit<br />
restoration of our normal collaboration and preservation of our<br />
special relationship as allies. whatever New Zealand's decision,<br />
however, I have told Prime minister Hawke that our commitment to<br />
Australia under ANZUS is firm. </p>
<p>Our discussions today also focused on regional issues and arms<br />
control. Australians share with the American people a deep<br />
concern about world peace and a desire to reduce the number of<br />
nuclear weapons threatening mankind.<br />
This is my third meeting with Prime minister Hawke. our personal<br />
relations and the relations of our countries remain on a very<br />
high level.<br />
Bob, smooth sailing on the rest of your trip and on the journey<br />
home. PM: Thank you Mr President, the warmth of your welcome and the<br />
sentiments that you have expressed in your statement are very<br />
much appreciated by me. I reflect not only the personal<br />
friendship to which you refer and to which I greatly value, I<br />
reflect also the close longstanding association between the<br />
governments and the people of our two countries.<br />
Mr President, as you are aware, the main purpose of my visit has<br />
been and remains to talk with you, your colleagues and members of<br />
Congress about agricultural matters.<br />
Nevertheless, let me say this at the outset, we are one in our<br />
determination to see an end to the scurge of international<br />
terrorism, and therefore condemn unequivocally Libya's role in<br />
directing, exporting and supporting such activities. The<br />
Australian Government does not accept that violence, in<br />
particular terrorism, is a solution to the complex problems of<br />
the world we share. We have referred in the United Nations<br />
Security Council to a number of possible causes open to the<br />
international community to bring about peaceful solution to the<br />
situation in the Mediterranean region.<br />
Mr President, we meet at a time when the rural sectors of both of<br />
our countries face serious difficulties. For us, the corruption<br />
of international markets is a matter of very grave concern.<br />
Australia is an efficient, non-subsidising agricultural exporter.<br />
It exports 80 per cent of its rural production. The severe<br />
difficulties that face Australian and US farming communities is a<br />
result of depressed agricultural prices and our frustrations with<br />
a market loss that has been brought about by huge European<br />
Community agricultural export subsidies, are of critical concern<br />
to both our countries.<br />
I have conveyed Australia's appreciation of the co-operation<br />
we've received so far from the United States on those aspects of<br />
the Farm Act impacting on Australia's interests. Australia<br />
particularly welcomed, Mr President, the recent amendments to the<br />
Farm Act which halved mandated spending under the export<br />
enhancement program and reduced the funds allocated under the<br />
targeted export assistance program. Bearing in mind the<br />
importance to Australia of its wheat markets, I was encouraged to<br />
have your reassurance, Mr President that EEP will continue on a<br />
targeted basis and essentially at markets of subsidising<br />
exporters and that you will continue to encourage EEP recipients<br />
to maintain their normal level of imports from traditional,<br />
non-subsidising suppliers. </p>
<p>We also welcomed your assurances that the implementation of the<br />
Farm Act with regard to the export of beef and dairy products<br />
would be handled in a way which seeks to minimise disruption in<br />
markets served by Australia. We also expect continued access for<br />
our beef to the United States market, at least at the levels<br />
consistent with the operation of the existing import law. In<br />
relation to sugar imports, in the United States, we are assured<br />
that Australia's traditional market share is being maintained.<br />
I appreciate that you have noted our concerns on the operation of<br />
the current cotton and rice programs. Australia has appreciated<br />
the opportunities we have had to consult on the administration of<br />
the Farm Act and of the EEP. We welcome your agreement and these<br />
opportunities to discuss with you will be extended to include<br />
Australia's concerns and the implementation of the United States<br />
export subsidy and surplus stock disposal programs. Periodic<br />
meetings between our respective trade and agricultural ministers<br />
will be central to that continuing process.<br />
Mr President, we both share the commitment to an effective<br />
September launch of the new MTN. We agree on the need to have<br />
agriculture accepted as a key issue for the new MTN round. We<br />
also agree to the negotiation of more effective GATT rules for<br />
agricultural subsidies should be a specific objective of the MTN<br />
round. The forthcoming Tokyo summit will be important in<br />
carrying these matters forward.<br />
Mr President, the closeness of the relations which Australia and<br />
the United States enjoys is based on common values and shared<br />
perspectives. our history of co-operation in peace and in war,<br />
our shared commitment to democratic values, and the fundamental<br />
importance of our security relationships under the ANZUS alliance<br />
have all served to strengthen and broaden our bilateral<br />
relationship. The close friendship between our countries does<br />
not require identical views on every international issue. A<br />
mature relationship involves mutual respect for each others right<br />
to determine independent policies towards various problems,<br />
having regard to each others concerns. our alliance under the<br />
ANZUS Treaty is fundamental to Australia's foreign and defence<br />
policies. It also has important implications for the security<br />
and the stability of our region. I'm pleased that in our<br />
discussions today, we reaffirmed the importance of our<br />
arrangements under ANZUS. We accept that like other alliances,<br />
the ANZUS Treaty entails obligations and responsibilities as well<br />
as mutual benefits. My Government is convinced that<br />
international security is enhanced not only by appropriate<br />
security arrangements which contribute to stable deterrence, but<br />
also our commitment to pursue balanced and verifiable arms<br />
control agreements. we value, very much indeed Mr President, the<br />
consultations and exchanges of views that take place at the<br />
highest levels of our governments, on a range of international<br />
issues including arms control and disarmament. my discussions<br />
today with you, Mr President, covered the prospects for progress<br />
towards effective arms control and specific initiatives that have<br />
been undertaken in Australia's own region including the South<br />
j Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. </p>
<p>4<br />
Our discussions today also covered the tragic situation in South<br />
Africa. The efforts of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group to<br />
encourage dialogue between the Government and the various racial<br />
groups with a view to the peaceful establishment of a non-racial,<br />
democratic and representative government in South Africa are<br />
currently an important contribution to the search for a solution<br />
As our bicentenary in 1988 approaches, we are planning a range of<br />
celebrations which we hope will involve active participation by<br />
many countries including, or course, the United States. A visit<br />
to Australia around that time by you would be most appropriate<br />
and most welcome, and I sincerely hope that you will be able to<br />
take up that invitation which I have extended to you.<br />
Mr President, I greatly appreciate the hospitality that you have<br />
extended to me today. I look forward to further valuable<br />
exchanges with you on the many important issues we have<br />
addressed. </p>
