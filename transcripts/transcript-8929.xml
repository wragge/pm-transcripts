E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
HIft Fxcellency, the Pres~ ident of Naum1 the honowablo Speaker of ie Nawijan<br />
Puarnment, miembers of the Nauruan Cabinet other distinguished gisests, and tadies and<br />
gcntlomwn. I understand my in~ it is the Frt to Nauru by an Austruliin Primc Minister.<br />
I thiink it is therefore ' very fitting that Presidoni Dowfyogo and I should take a mornant<br />
from the Forum schedule to take part in today' coremony here at the Cenotaph.<br />
The Cerntaph honours the courage and sacrifice of Naunuan and Ausralians who<br />
sufferid dwrinjS the Japan ese occupatio n of Nauu<br />
It 6~ important that we ncvcr forget the great ftragdy experieniced by the Nauruan<br />
peoplc at that tie<br />
The ccrmnunity was dMdcd by mnass exilo. Vnspeakable hardship and brutality mncant<br />
thats mny Nauruans died. Indeed a Largo part of the population died.<br />
Exceptional qualities are needed for a comniiy to surve adversity r-uch as ths.<br />
A generation of Nauruan leadership was forged in thAt bidter stnvle,<br />
Their loyalty to their community remains an timpiration for aft Nauxuans today.<br />
As an Auatralian I am also proud to honour the bravery and dedication of Colonel<br />
Chalmers and hiis four colleagues who died htr in the occupation. Their namecs are<br />
fixed at th.; Ccnotaph commemoration of the fact that they stayed after the evacuation<br />
with the Nauun people anid died as a conscquence.<br />
/ TO'd iO* QN 8T: 2. T 16'~ 6n':-3 </p>
<p>Our two countries have a long association, and it is associations of this kind where we<br />
sharo an experience in war. Where we die at the hands of an enemy, but die together.<br />
We know these things form part now of not just a long association but a long<br />
fricndship. We know each other now as friends and partners.<br />
In recalling together today our shared history, we should draw faith from the courage<br />
and dedication of past generations of Naunans and Australians. People who faced<br />
hardship and struggle, and in the Second World War, of course, brutality on a scale<br />
none of us today are asked to bear.<br />
We should of the consequene of all this commit ourselves to long-standing friendship<br />
and cooperation in the fu;,.<br />
I am very happy that earlier today, President Dowiyogo and I agreed on a compact of<br />
settlement which will define a new phase in the Australia. Nauru relationship.<br />
lhi is a relationship which I think is now underwritten by a treaty of principles,<br />
statement of principles, which I might say exists between Australia and no other country<br />
as it now does between Australia and Nauru.<br />
Never bcfWore have we written downi the basis of an ongoing friendship together as we<br />
have today.<br />
So from here on we know well that we can build a future on a shared past, we know<br />
ours is a unique relationship, one which I am sure will endure.<br />
I am very hlionourd to have had the opportunity to visit Nauru, and particularly<br />
honoured to take place in today's ceremony, where as Prime Minister of Australia this is<br />
the 1rt opportunity for me in the position of Prime Minister to honour the Australians<br />
who died here and to honour the Nauruans who died also. And to bring to our<br />
memory the great losses and shared sacrifices of the Second World War.<br />
Our long history together is worthy of remembrance and now we can celebrate a future<br />
together, one based on mutual trust and mutual respect and one where we know well<br />
together where our future will lead us.<br />
Thank you very much for having me here today as part of this very moving ceremony.<br />
ENDS<br />
