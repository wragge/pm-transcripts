PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 8 DECEMBER 1978<br />
Interview with Warren Beeby, Malcolm Colless and<br />
Russell Schneider of the Australian.<br />
Question This is your Third Anniversary... . will be your Third<br />
Anniversary, what do you think have been the major<br />
achievements over the last few years?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think I'd put the major achievements in two areas:<br />
one economic, because without the economy coming right<br />
all other ambitions and hopes for Australia will fail.<br />
You've got to have a strong economy to pay for<br />
education, welfare and help for the disadvantaged. A<br />
very major part of the Government's attention<br />
therefore have been directed just to that. We've had<br />
a situation, as you know, in which inflation has come<br />
down very substantially. Interest rates have started to<br />
come down significantly. The one percent reduction that<br />
has been achieved through this year on home loans is<br />
something of the order of $ 150 million a year on<br />
repayments from home borrowers throughout Australia, or<br />
$ 17 a month, whichever way you like to look at it, for<br />
somebody on an average loan. That's substantial.<br />
Industry is starting to become more competitive. A<br />
number of industries are getting into export markets.<br />
They are getting a better share of our own markets.<br />
I think in September the statistics of items exported<br />
rose for the first time since 1972. Some major manufacturers<br />
are starting to put on very significant numbers of employees;<br />
rebuilding export organisations. Quite plainly, other<br />
industries the manufacturing sector is not even but<br />
some parts of it are starting to do much better and over<br />
the last month, six weeks, the last two months I suppose,<br />
I have had a number of people saying to me that order<br />
books are much better, production is up at the moment and<br />
the prospects for next year are signicantly improved.<br />
The BHP production over the six months to September<br />
over the later six monthly period compared to the six<br />
monthly period last year their production for domestic<br />
purposes was up very very substantially indeed. It's the<br />
first time that's happened. It's the first time they've<br />
ever said that to me. In other words, they believe they've<br />
( inaudible)<br />
and that there is a real trend forward. All of this is<br />
starting to point to a more optimistic economic future for<br />
Australia. The decisions taken at the Loan Council complement this<br />
general improvement, and again indicate that all Governments<br />
are starting to plan for the 1980' s with a real degree of<br />
confidence and enthusiasm. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Employment remains an areas of difficulty. The people<br />
don't always understand that 300,000 people have been<br />
or are being helped by the various training programmes.<br />
There is not a problem of a lost generation, but it<br />
is a problem of those who have less motivation, less<br />
( inaudible), who have done less well at school, at the<br />
end of each age group. our training programmes are<br />
directed specifically to trying to help the kids in<br />
this area.<br />
You know the ministerial changes. A minister will be<br />
full time on problems-of employment and youth affairs,<br />
not indicating a change in economic strategy but making<br />
quite sure that we are doing everything we can to<br />
alleviate hardship that there is. I hope we will also<br />
be again trying to get more of industry to register<br />
its vacancies with the employment service: making sure<br />
that people are aware of what jobs are available.<br />
I said there were two areas which were significant<br />
achievements. One is something which has been going on<br />
quietly and has not really been given much attention<br />
perhaps, maybe because it is not controversial, but in the<br />
welfare area we have been able to concentrae funds in<br />
areas of particular need, of particular disadvantage.<br />
The program of building homes for * old people has been<br />
going forward well. The additional and expanded programmes<br />
to help the handicapped have done more in that area than<br />
in any other period in Australia's history. In other words,<br />
during a period of real economic stringency and difficulty,<br />
we have not forgotten our concern and obligations to the<br />
disadvantaged people in the Australian community.<br />
( Inaudible) and have made additional funds available.<br />
It is an aspect of the Government's record that is not<br />
as well understood as it should be.<br />
Question ( Colless)<br />
During the last election campaign you said that the<br />
election was necessary and justified because Australia<br />
needed a period of politicaV and economic stability<br />
if it was to recover from the economic depression.<br />
Do you feel that that goal has been achieved?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there is a much greater degree of political<br />
stability and economic stability and I think that is<br />
accepted in the marketplace.<br />
Question Do the changes which have been made in the Budget<br />
strategy not in the strategy-but in the Budget, since<br />
it was introduced in August, do they detract at all, do<br />
you feel from that econoihic stability? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
-Prime* Minister<br />
Not from economic staLbility, no, because the changes<br />
in themselves do more for economic policy or strategy. But<br />
I think what needs to be understood that in getting<br />
to the total strategy many decisions had to be taken<br />
were ery difficult and very hard.<br />
Now I suppose four or five of those decisions became<br />
matters of public comment and we did alter our view<br />
in relation to a couple of them. Against the background<br />
of the very real difficulty in framing a responsible<br />
Budget this year, I think maybe not altogether surprising.<br />
In Parliamentary terms I believe all Government<br />
members supported the thrust and the strategy of the<br />
Budget in a most commendable way. I also believe that<br />
out in the marketplace the thrust and the strategy of<br />
the Budget has been well accepted. I don't pretend<br />
that individuals like all the individual items in the<br />
Budget, they obviously don't, but a very large number of<br />
people have said to me ' the strategy is right, the Budget<br />
is responsible'. It is a result of that Budget that<br />
people will have their view of the economy which has<br />
begun to emerge. The earlier part of this calendar year<br />
confirmed that the movements in interest rates are being<br />
sustained in a steady and responsible way.<br />
It would have been a tragedy to make progress with the<br />
economy and to reverse that by an irresponsible Budget,<br />
a Budget which might have been much easier to frame in<br />
political terms, in the short-term, but which would have<br />
reversed the progress we have made in relation to inflation.<br />
Let me make the point that I reject utterly any concept of<br />
a trade-off between inflation and unemployment and I don't<br />
believe that we are giving unemployment a low priority<br />
because we have given a high priority to inflation.<br />
I think we have in fact shown more concern for unemployment<br />
by being prepared to stick to policies which we know over<br />
a time will work than by being, or allowing ourselves,<br />
to be seduced into policies which might appear to be popular<br />
in the short-term but which we know over the long-term<br />
will not work.<br />
one of the problems with a number of countries overseas,<br />
is that after they have made some progress in the fight<br />
against inflation, they felt that they then relax their<br />
monetary and fiscal policies when inflation is still too<br />
high and interest rates too high.<br />
What's really happened is not a great improvement in<br />
employment but a resurgence of inflation. That then is likely<br />
to establish a higher continuing level of unemployment<br />
than if the battle against inflation had been continued.<br />
I don't think I have met him, but one of the officers<br />
from the Office of Youth Affairs, put it very well in a<br />
reported comment in Hobart the other day, that you have got<br />
a commodity to sell and if you can't sell that commodity<br />
you generally try to lower the price so you can sell it.<br />
But when you can't sell all of a commodity, / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
if you continue to try and raise the price, then you<br />
will sell less of the commodity. That's what is<br />
accepted out in the marketplace but in the question of<br />
employment, the tragedy is what is being sold is not<br />
some unthinking, uncaring, inanimate object. Is the<br />
labour of some tens of thousands of people all around<br />
Australia. With that example, ju ; t put in plain and<br />
graphic terms, if wages go up too much ' it is much harder<br />
to get people into jobs and that is recognized by<br />
Labor Prime Ministers like Jim Callaghan, and Labor<br />
Treasurers like Dennis Healey. It was even recognized<br />
by Frank Crean when he was Treasurer. One of the<br />
great tragedies in Australia in 1977/ 78 is that it is<br />
not recognized by the responsible elements in the<br />
trade union movement, although I am quite certain it is<br />
recommended by the great majority of their rank and file.<br />
Question Do you think it is recognized by the Arbitration Commission?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would certainly hope so. I might be able to make a better<br />
judgement than that after I know the results of their<br />
wage case. The Arbitration Commission tries to balance<br />
economic reality with its industrial relations responsiblities.<br />
But after one particular wage decision where very near full<br />
indexation was granted, a very senior trade unions official<br />
told me that he and his colleagues were laughing all the<br />
way to the bank because they know that the union movement<br />
would have accepted a lower determination. I think he<br />
knew in his heart that it would have been better for<br />
employment. They regard their job as arguing for the<br />
maximum increase in wages. It is time people really started<br />
to show a responsibility to those who aren't employed, who<br />
ought to be represented by the leaders of the trade ulzion<br />
movement. But they are not, they have been rejected by<br />
them. Question You were saying that high levels of unemployment will continue<br />
until the price of labour is either reduced or greater<br />
increases in...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The whole thrust of our arguments before the Arbitration<br />
Commission is to try and see that there is a greater profit<br />
share and that the very high and rapid escalation of<br />
wages, or the damage that has done, is to an extent reversed.<br />
It is worth noting that in the 12 months it might have<br />
been marginally changed in the 12 months to September when<br />
the figures were out but in the 12 months to June, average<br />
weekly earnings still rose a little more than the Consumer<br />
Price Index. I think that just makes the point that our<br />
policies haven't been being achieved at the expense of<br />
the working men and women of Australia. Against those figures<br />
they can't complain that our policies have damaged their<br />
own interest. </p>
<p>5<br />
Question Do you feel that the difficult decisions in the Budget<br />
that you referred to this year some had to be<br />
modified do you think you've made it harder for<br />
yourself next year by this commitment to give up a totalof<br />
about $ 600 million in revenue through bringing off<br />
the tax surcharge in...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They were commitments. The very fact that we introduced<br />
tax indexation makes it harder for governments. Inflation<br />
is down but there is some inflation, and still too much,<br />
we want to reduce that.<br />
But while there is any inflation, some people get pushed<br />
into higher tax brackets without tax indexation. They<br />
get pushed into higher tax brackets through the process<br />
of inflation and Governments therefore get more revenue.<br />
Tax indexation was designed to prevent that. The fact<br />
that we've got tax indexation of course makes it more<br />
difficult for us but it also makes Governments more<br />
honest. If you have to raise more revenue you've got to come<br />
out and do it publicly and be seen to do it. You've got<br />
to argue and you have got to justify it.<br />
I don't think people have recognised or understood the<br />
extent of the influence of tax indexation on the policies<br />
of the Government; Wihile tax indexation remains, the<br />
extent of its influence on the policies of any future<br />
government. It would prevent for all time when in 1972<br />
Mr. Whitlam was asked how areyou going to pay for your<br />
and his answer was " by the inflationary increase in taxation',<br />
in tax indexation. No Prime Minister can ever give that<br />
answer. People didn't understand it then. They thought<br />
it was a harmless process. only when it went on voraciously<br />
they realised the great harm that it did do.<br />
Question You've had to say that you are putting on this 1.5 percent<br />
tax surcharge and this sense you are legislating for the<br />
tax increase that you want. You have promised to give that<br />
up on the 1st of July, with other revenue, and this has<br />
put you in a tight situation where you haven't got as much<br />
flexibility as you had in previous years whef~ e your revenues are.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That depends on a number of things. I think you need to have<br />
in mind that the rural sector is doing much better than<br />
was envisaged even six months ago. The last forecast from<br />
the BAE revised upwards farm incomes by $ 300 or $ 400 million.<br />
So revenue from that should be up. Contribution of balance<br />
of trade in rural exports I would have thoughtwould also be<br />
up as a consequence. The secondary effects by the rural<br />
sector in parts of the economy, I often tend to think is<br />
underestimated in official forecasts. At the Orange Field<br />
Day the exhibitors there were telling me that they had all<br />
taken more and better orders than they had for many years. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
That's not surprising because I think this year is the<br />
first time in maybe 15 years that we have got sheep and<br />
wool, beef and wheat, all coming together with reasonable<br />
prices with good seasons around Australia. That's bound<br />
to have an impact on what farmers do. What farmers do<br />
clearly has an impact on country tow. vns and industries that<br />
service rural areas. Clearly, just as tax indexation<br />
makes it more difficult to frame Budgets, we knew we had<br />
to raise some extra revenue this year but we wanted<br />
put that legislation on for one year. That's what<br />
we did.<br />
Question The Leader of the Opposition has predicted that you are<br />
going to make up for this loss of revenue through the<br />
tax surcharge coming off, by implementing a retail tax.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it would be boring to go into all the predictions<br />
of ' the Leader of the Opposition. But if you read John<br />
Howard's statement he made it plain that what we wanted<br />
to do was to have the best advice so that we could look<br />
at the proper balance of taxation.<br />
It is the balance of that taxation as much as its<br />
incidence in any one area or just as much as the particular<br />
level of aparticular kind of tax, determines whether an<br />
internal tax system is equitable or not. It's to enable<br />
us to make the best decisions in that area that the<br />
Treasurer launched the current inquiry. Some of the<br />
advertising in this area, by some of the retailers, has<br />
been, to put it mildly, ] rather distorted. There were<br />
one or two pamphlets were saying something like<br />
" 1campaign against the Government's decision to impose" well<br />
there has been now decision to impose, it's an investigation<br />
to enable us to make better-informed judgements about the<br />
general weight and thrust of taxation.<br />
Question I understand that abo~ ut 100, 000 petitions on this matter<br />
have gone to members of Parliament, including your backbenchers<br />
and a great number of them have come out against a retail<br />
tax? Prime Minister<br />
The petitions?<br />
Question The petitions from retailers to backbenchers. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime'Minister The petitions from retailers, yes. But one particular<br />
store had 12 people employed, going around to all their<br />
customers saying please sign here. A lot of people go<br />
into retail stores and if they are prepared to put on<br />
quite a number of employees to get signatures. ( Inaudible)..<br />
to know why it's done: " look, you want to sign this<br />
petition against an additional tax don't you", of course,<br />
well who wouldn't get people to sign petitions under those<br />
circumstances.<br />
-Question<br />
You don't rule out the possibility of a retail tax?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't add to or detract anything from what the<br />
Treasurer said on this subject. The examination was designed<br />
to allow us to make better judgements about the<br />
w~ ight of taxation, the w~ ight of direct and indirect<br />
taxation. When we get that examination we will make<br />
a judgement about what we ought to do.<br />
Question When do you expect it in?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think it is too far off.<br />
Question Before the Budget?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We will have it before the next Budget.<br />
-, Que stion<br />
Before you ( inaudible)<br />
Prime* Minister<br />
( Inaudible)<br />
Question Last week you said you were hopeful that you would receive<br />
the Crawford Review by the end of the year?<br />
Question I think the Crawford and Williams Reports both look like<br />
being early in the next year. They spoke, or wrote, to<br />
me about this and especially the Williams reporter, said<br />
I would much sooner it was done thoroughly and well ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
because we want it to be a report on which we can base<br />
actions and decisions and it does take an extra month<br />
or two I would sooner we took that extra' month than to<br />
put in a report that we might not be thoroughly satisfied<br />
with. Question Tackling the problem of industry adjustment can be done<br />
presumably, or it will be done by the Government ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I wouldn't expect any moves. We've done some things, as<br />
you know. What's on record in the textile, apparel and<br />
footware industry, export incentives and whatever.<br />
An enormous amount of re-adjustment has been going on in<br />
both primary and secondary industry all the time. It's<br />
very evident.<br />
Question Can we expect a signicant move from Government after the<br />
Prime Mini! ter<br />
I would find it quite impossible to make a judgemeht about<br />
that until I know what is going to be recommended and see<br />
the basis of the Report. The Williams Report in particular<br />
I hope will be one which dobs provide a basis for action<br />
by governments. But I would be very surprised if its the<br />
sort of report that only involves the Federal Government.<br />
Question On the question of interest rates again. Some of your<br />
backbenchers are saying, privately perhaps, if interest<br />
rates continue to be forced down.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are not forced down, the market is taking them down.<br />
Question or encouraged by government action to go down, there could<br />
be a large outflow of capital next year, after which<br />
interest rates ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
People also look at the rates of inflation. In countries<br />
where interest rates are going up they become very<br />
concerned about inflation.<br />
Question Do you believe interest rates will continue to drop? / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Prime minister<br />
Over a time. Plainly, interest rates rising in Britain<br />
and the United States don't help. But you have got to<br />
look at the underlying rates of inflation and that's<br />
also a factor in general confidence in the policies<br />
of Government. If their rates continue to rise, it makesour<br />
task harder, quite plainly. I think that<br />
up to about this time last year, or very early this<br />
calendar year, we had a right to expect that in overseas<br />
countries inflation was qoing to c6ntinue to fall,<br />
and policy settings would be maintained that would<br />
achieve that.<br />
It's been a disappointment to see that policy settings<br />
haven't been maintained which would encourage inflation<br />
to fall in other countries. If there is a reversal<br />
in the downward thrust of inflation, I think it is going<br />
to be one of the major factors that will inhibit the<br />
growth of world markets and the expansion of world trade<br />
and therefore one of the major factors that will make<br />
it harder to get rid of the unemployment problem and<br />
I'm not talking' just of Auistralia, I'm talking of advanced<br />
Western countries. My views on that aren't radical, they<br />
are supported by the OECD and supported, in vehement<br />
terms, by the Secretariat of the General Agreement on<br />
Tariffs and Trade.<br />
Question Are you still confident of a 5 percent inflation rate<br />
by the middle of next year, in view of the way food<br />
prices have acted over the last few months manufacturing<br />
prices? Prime Minister<br />
I think food prices were in a sense predictable because<br />
they had been operating at historically low levels.<br />
Some have meat prices have as you know. I have been<br />
given no evidence by Treasury to cause them to withdraw<br />
from what is a Treasury official prediction of an<br />
annualised rate, about the middle of next year, of around<br />
percent. Let me make it quite plain that this is not<br />
any change from what I've said beforeI am just filling<br />
it out to make sure there is no migunderstanding when<br />
that time comes. That wasn't 5 percent over the 12 months<br />
up to June, running at a rate of around 5 percent<br />
at that time if you annualise the rate then prevailing.<br />
That was what Treasury said in their prediction, and that<br />
was in the Budget papers. And that's what I've stated<br />
in speeches. Now, on the later advice, post-Budget, that<br />
I've had from Treasury, there's been no withdrawal by<br />
them fromr ' Chat prediction, from that forecast.<br />
Question If that was right, if that was achieved, would that be<br />
seen as the basis for a more stimulating Budget next year? </p>
<p>10<br />
Primne Minister<br />
Let's put it this way. We've taken the decisions in<br />
the Loan Council and they will start to flow through.<br />
I don't know how quickly the Premiers will get out of<br />
their seats and get moving. I know one or two of<br />
them are trying to move as rapidly as they can on<br />
the projects that have been approved. But if you look<br />
at the funds involved there, they start to build up<br />
in the second or third year to 300 or 350 million dollars.<br />
That's clearly got implications for activity in a way<br />
that's not on our Budget. Before we get to our own<br />
Budget we are going to have the Loan Council decisions,<br />
the Premier' s Conference decisions, and clearly as we<br />
approach them we will be taking the total situation into<br />
account to see what we ought to do. It is not only our<br />
Budget. There are other factors that are highly relevant and it all<br />
needs to be integrated so that the variou õ elements<br />
all thrust and push in the same direction, the right<br />
direction. The other point I would like to make is that if you've<br />
got inflation at that sort of level, that in'itself is<br />
going to help pr6vide its own stimulus. That means that<br />
our cost basis ' improves. That means our manufacturers<br />
are going to get a better share of markets. Maybe for<br />
the first time, importers are complaining about the costs<br />
of imports. As far as the Australian factories are concerned<br />
I think it's bad luck for the importer. As far as the<br />
Australian factories are concerned that is good news for<br />
the Australian producer, for the Australian company and it<br />
also means that Australian goods will have a better chance<br />
of being e~ ported. In the sort of situation that we've<br />
place in, the word stimulus has been used very often in<br />
a wrong way. People have said stimulus more Government<br />
spefiding and it's a hangover from from the Keynesian<br />
philosophy which was more appropriate to quite'different<br />
times when you had old-fashioned kind of depression where<br />
there was no inflation, interest rates were low, unemployment<br />
was high and economies do respond to Government expenditure<br />
in those circumstances. But we are not in those<br />
circumstances and overcoming inflation, the process of<br />
getting interest rates down, in the circumstances we've<br />
been facing, provides its own stimulus and the Goverments<br />
will need to judge how that operates. Having said that,<br />
we I take the Loan Council decisions into account.<br />
Question If you got inflation to 5 percent would that be seen<br />
would you then consider that you had largely won the<br />
fight against inflation and that you would then now then<br />
be holding, be engaging, in a holding action and switching<br />
some of your attention to othbr areas?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh good heavens no. Well, inflation is you get a figure<br />
of what inflation is and so often people say your energies<br />
are directed to inflation. I have already made the point<br />
about inflation and employment. When you say that your / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
energies are directed to the problem of inflation<br />
that is not an end in itself: y/ ou wnat to get inflation<br />
down so that your factories can compete; so that they<br />
can employ; go that they can expand; so that they will<br />
employ more; so that local people will be encouraged<br />
to invest; so that overseas concerns will be more concerned<br />
in invest in Australia than in any other country because<br />
they recognize the strength and the sense of our economic<br />
policies. So when you are talking about getting inflation down that<br />
in a sense is a shorthand way-of saying you are wanting<br />
to achieve all these other things.<br />
You do achieve all these other things by getting inflation<br />
down. You get a real push to the economy by the activities<br />
and decisions by business and entrepreneurs in Australia<br />
and overseas. It needs to be in that wider perspective.<br />
You are not just looking at that one figure,. inflation,<br />
and ignoring the dther'factors that are going to occur.<br />
Question Y ou're basically relying on the improvement in the economy<br />
that will flow from getting inflation down, creating this<br />
stability to generate job prospects. Do you see any<br />
scope whatever for Government-sponsored capital work9<br />
to aim at creating jobs?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, one answer to that again, is the Loan Council decision<br />
because those are projects sponsored by Governments. Sure,<br />
the money might be borrowed overseas, but it's much<br />
better doing things that way than doing it off our Bu ' dget<br />
which could have all sorts of unhappy consequences if<br />
the deficit is too high, if you have to borrow too much<br />
money. It's going to force up interest rates instead<br />
of getting them down.<br />
Quite plainly,-there a number of things in the capital works<br />
area which the Government would like to be able to do<br />
if the financial circumstances made it possible. There are<br />
some areas where you would like to have the additional<br />
resources for a greater ( inaudible). There are other areas<br />
where you would like to be able to contribute more to<br />
building up the infrastructure of Australia. But we have<br />
got to be able to judge the circumstances at the time, as to<br />
whether it is respon , ible for us to do so. I can't make<br />
a judqement now what may or may not be in the next Budget<br />
or in the Budget after that.<br />
And you shouldn't take the fact that I have said that there<br />
are areas where we would like to be able to do more in<br />
the capital works area as indicating that that is going to<br />
happen. ( Inaudible). Hitherto, the overall financial<br />
management has we just haven't had the resources to do it.<br />
/ 12 </p>
<p>-12<br />
Question Do you feel that there is scope for a heightened Federal<br />
Government overseas borrowing program to perhaps generate<br />
this sort of work you're talking about?<br />
9<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think we went as far as we should in this area,<br />
in giving approval to the States. There was a general<br />
agreement at the Loan Council that there wouldn't be,<br />
or rather a Commonwealth view, that we wouldn't particularly<br />
be wanting to approve additional projects under three<br />
years. Now if the States want to bring something up for<br />
examination which is a long lead item not involving<br />
expenditure for a period, we would obviously look at it.<br />
But it's a new policy, a departure from a practice<br />
of 50 years and it would be better to let it be launched<br />
on the decisions and approvals so far made and then just<br />
sit back a little and see how that works.<br />
Question In 1975, and again in 1977, you expressed the importance<br />
of the Government getting out of the private sector and<br />
transferring resources to the private sector. A lot of<br />
businessmen do still complain that this government is not much<br />
better than the Labor government in terms of bureaucratic<br />
interference with business.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think they really mean it.<br />
Question They complain about it.<br />
The Prices Justification Tribunal does still exist -the<br />
Trade Practices Act still intrudes upon business. Do you'~ have<br />
any plans to reduce Government control-of business?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You know the changes that have been made in the PJT area and<br />
I think now it is a much more sensible organisation than it<br />
was before. I think that an organisation such as the PJT<br />
in the current circumstances is desirable for a number of reasons.<br />
In yourwage negotiations it is important to be able<br />
to demonstrate that you are concerned about the way prices are<br />
set. On one argument you could say ( inaudible)<br />
at the market place, but that is not always evident ( inaudible).<br />
It is not unimportant in general wage negotiations, but<br />
there is a substantial industrial relations wage reason for<br />
a continuation of the PJT in some form. It is quite unreal to<br />
believe that you could have no restrictive trade practice<br />
legislation in 1978. It is a nruestion of examination to see<br />
whether or not the Act intrudes unduly in the affairs of<br />
business, and there is an examination of the provisions of the<br />
Act going on at the moment. There were changes made barely<br />
some improvements. </p>
<p>-13-<br />
Que stion strength?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think what Governments have to fight against in this area is<br />
the tendency of these regulatory bodies growing, extending, expanding<br />
their powers. Because if that is allowed business can be stifledthat<br />
is not our intention, and I don't really believe it is<br />
happening at the moment. We don't rule out possible changes<br />
to restrictive trade practices legislation there is an<br />
examination going on at the moment.<br />
Question In the preliminary consideration for next year's Budget is there<br />
any thought being given at this stage to another look at resources<br />
taxes, capital gains taxes, and that sort of<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have made our decisions about those.<br />
Question They're finished?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
,( Inaudible)<br />
Question Going from business to mining guidelines. Are you completely<br />
satisfied with the mining guidelines?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The guidelines have been issued for consultation. They are<br />
operating in the coal area in parti6ular at the moment.<br />
But after consultation the Government will be havinq a look at where<br />
we finally come out. That was understood when the guidelines were<br />
first issued.<br />
Question Have you received any response from the companies? There was an<br />
approach made from the companies shortly after the guidelines<br />
were announced.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A lot of companies have been making their views known, and I haven't<br />
got a catelogue of those for and those against. ./ 14 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
Question But there has been no consensus as far as the Government is<br />
concerned yet, you haven't been able to draw a consensus view<br />
of their reaction?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there are differing views 6n this sort of subject<br />
I think there are always differing views.<br />
Question<br />
Nothing, at this stage, to make you feel that the decisions that<br />
were announced may need substantial amendment?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Nothing that causes me to qualify what was said at the time.<br />
The guidelines were issued for consultation and discussion with<br />
the companies, with the States, and after that we will examine<br />
it. That was said * at the time.<br />
Question<br />
Can I just ask one last one. The first question was your<br />
achievements in the past. What do you hope to achieve, what do<br />
you most hope to achieve between now and the next election?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I believe continuation of obviously broad economic policies, but at<br />
the same time, I would hope the atmospherics that have been<br />
coming to me, and the statement by individuals of prospects for<br />
their own companies activities, are obviously bedoming more<br />
evident and recorded in the official statistics over a fairly broad<br />
area. That's in the economic area. We are continuing in other<br />
areas of government the examination of welfare programmes in<br />
areas of concern. The Williams Inquiry might involve'some<br />
substantial decisions of government in relation to education in<br />
train but we can't prejudge that at the moment.<br />
One other area of achievement which I haven't mentioned is in<br />
the area of civil rights. I think this Government has done more<br />
than any otheir to protect individuals against the possibly<br />
intrusions, by what is sometimes regarded as a loud and powerful,<br />
unthinking, uncaring bureaucracy. The Ombudsman, the Administrative<br />
Appeals Tribunal and the various the fabric of law reform<br />
is a very notable achievement. There have been discussions<br />
in recent times about the Human Rights Commission. There have been<br />
very significant discussions with the States in relation to it.<br />
That can be encompassed in agreement with the States and take<br />
that process of law reform an important area a further step<br />
forward. They're non-controversial athievements, but the ones<br />
that are nonetheless very important when the apparatus in<br />
bureaucracy of a State sometimes appears to be large to an individual<br />
outside hard to find his or her way through. There are now<br />
means of redress, means to 6nsure that grievances can be examined,<br />
decisions reviewed. I think that is very important. </p>
<p>Question Can I just ask one question. After the Heads of Government<br />
Regional Meeting earlier this year, and the bombing of the Hilton<br />
you announced a substantial upgrading of security in Australia,<br />
and there was a large provision for security made in the Budget.<br />
Soon you are going away again, you will be going by commercial<br />
airlines which raises that problem of security yet again.<br />
How close is the Government to providing these VIP jets and<br />
also could we expect a significant move in the area of security<br />
in the New Year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There has been a good deal going on behind the scenes. There is<br />
the Hope examination, as you know, for arrangements between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States; there is the Mark Report and the<br />
Commonwealth Police, and that is being processed; and I hope<br />
the Hope Report will be a very significant vehicle for improved<br />
cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in that sort<br />
of area. I can't really say at this point how much progress<br />
is being made in relation to aircraft. The reasons the only<br />
reasons for the purchase of aircraft or the decision to<br />
to see if a particular aircraft could be purchased is. a security<br />
one. As a Cabinet we see and uhderstand the importance<br />
of that and also understand the inconvience to ot-her passengers<br />
that often occurs when a member of the Government is on<br />
a commercial aircraft. The overseas requirement by itself<br />
is not a major one. There is a very real problem in getting<br />
an aircraft that can suit the various purposes and it is'not<br />
going to just be something this there for a very occasional<br />
use. I am not overly enthusiastic about an aircraft that<br />
might just be standing by and not doing V. ery much for most<br />
of the year unless maybe the Deputy Prime Minister is<br />
leading a trade mission to China or on the odd occasions when<br />
I have to do something overseas. That is one of the problems.<br />
The sort of the aircraft that would meet our specifications<br />
just plainly isn't built.<br />
Question Has that idea been shelved?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. It has not been shelved it's just indicating the<br />
difficulty. If any decision is made it is going to represent<br />
a very real compromise in terms of aircraft use.<br />
Question Does that mean it looks as going to be muibh longer than was<br />
originally anticipated before we you can get two new planes?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Not necessarily, but it does mean that whatever you do represents<br />
a very real compromise and it just means what I said a real<br />
compromise in the use of aircraft. I don't know what the final<br />
decision will be. / 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
Question<br />
Are you going to take a holiday this year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Next Thursday I hope to get down on the farm and have<br />
a few days off before going to Jamaica on Christmas Day.<br />
Question It's a funny day to start your overseas tour.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I will have a press conference about 11: 00 o'clock on<br />
Christmas Day. That's just to set the scene for Jamaica.<br />
Question The Ministry are you totally satisfied ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is a very good ministerial team.<br />
Question<br />
And you are satisfied?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, of course I am.<br />
Question No further changes are contemplated?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. I must have been very predictable. 000---</p>
