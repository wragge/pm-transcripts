PRIME MINISTE -6E17<br />
FOR PRESS 4 FEBRUARY 1979<br />
CHANGES IN CABINET ARRANGEMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister announced today changes in the<br />
structure and membership of the Standing Committees of Cabinet.<br />
These changes flow from a review of Cabinet<br />
arrangements asked for by the Prime Minister late last year.<br />
The new structure of Standing Committees matches<br />
more closely the present flow of Cabinet business. Some<br />
Committees have been reduced in size to facilitate their<br />
operations. However other Ministers are co-opted to Standing<br />
Committees for particular policy items as required. Ministers<br />
proposing policy items are automatically co-opted.<br />
Major issues, particularly in relation to the economy<br />
and employment, will continue to be taken in full Cabinet.<br />
Standing Committees will meet throughout the year as the<br />
workload requires. They will continue to be supported by<br />
committees of officials.<br />
The review of Cabinet arrangements confirmed a<br />
significant and continuing increase in the volume of business<br />
coming forward for decision, a continuing feature of federal<br />
administration under the present and previous Governments.<br />
Streamlining measures have been taken in the past to reduce<br />
the workload on Cabinet. The Prime Minister has informed<br />
Ministers of further changes designed to reduce the Cabinet<br />
workload, including a request that Ministers handle more<br />
matters on their own discretion. Cabinet has also authorised<br />
the Minister for Finance to approve minor new expenditures<br />
bilaterally with Ministers without Cabinet consideration.<br />
The growing volume of Cabinet business comes from a<br />
variety of reasons, particularly the complexity of government<br />
and the increasing need at the federal and state level for<br />
co-ordination of policies. The Cabinet Office has been asked<br />
to continue its task of orderly programming of meetings and<br />
improving the presentation of proposals for decision.<br />
The practice will continue of establ ishing other<br />
Cabinet Committees on an ad hoc basis for specific purposes.<br />
The Ministerial Public Information Committee, chaired by the<br />
Minister for Industry and Commerce, will also continue to<br />
operate. The new Standing Committees of Cabinet and their<br />
membership are shown in the attachment. 000---/ attachment. 9 pages </p>
