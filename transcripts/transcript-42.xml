STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER ( MR. MENZIES)<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
Thursday, 28th November9 1957<br />
" THE AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES"<br />
It gives me both official and personal pleasure to present<br />
to the House the valuable report on the Australian Universities made<br />
by what I will refer to as the Murray Committee.<br />
Last year, when in England, I approached Sir Keith Murray<br />
and asked him whether he would preside over an investigation of the<br />
problems of our universities. He agreed to do this, subject to the<br />
approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, an<br />
approval which was willingly given.<br />
The Committee appointed was very well balanced.<br />
Sir Keith Murray himself is the Chairman of the University<br />
Grants Committee in Great Britain and is highly skilled in assessing<br />
the financial needs of universities, the wisdom and practicability<br />
of university development programmes, and the part that Governments<br />
can play. Sir Ian Clunies Ross, the Chairman of C. S. I. R. O. is, of<br />
course, familiar with our national need for scientists in a wide<br />
variety of fields and has an intimate knowledge of the problems of<br />
our universities. Sir Charles Morris, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of<br />
Leeds, is a practising University administrator, familiar with the<br />
Universities' day-to-day problems.<br />
Mr. A. J. Reid, the Chancellor of the University of Western<br />
Australia, is a former head of the State Treasury and a Member of the<br />
Commonwealth Grants Commission. He, therefore, has a special knowledge<br />
of both University matters and Commonwealth-State financial relations.<br />
Mr. J. C. Richards is Assistant General Manager of the B. H. P.<br />
and a former Rhodes scholar. He was able to bring to the enquiry a<br />
considerable knowledge of industrial interest in and requirements of<br />
the Universities. To this strong Committee, we gave a wide charter which<br />
included the role of the University in the Australian community;<br />
the extension and co-ordination of University facilities; technological<br />
education at University level; the financial needs of Universities and<br />
appropriate means of providing for them, </p>
<p>-2<br />
In less than the three months July to September 1957<br />
the Committee visited every University institution in Australia,<br />
received the views of large numbers of people and bodies, including<br />
Government Departments, and has prepared this extensive report.<br />
We are grateful to the Committee for its remarkable speed,<br />
thoroughness and grasp of the matters involved in their task.<br />
The Government has also had the report of the Australian<br />
Academy of Science on Scientific and Technological Manpower Supply<br />
and Demand in Australia. It is a very valuable analysis of one<br />
aspect of the problems investigated by the Murray Committee and indeed<br />
reinforces much that is contained in the Committee's report.<br />
This is not the appropriate time to comment in detail on<br />
the Academy's findings, but I do take this opportunity of commending<br />
them for their contribution to an understanding of one important<br />
aspect of the total problem.<br />
. To-night I have the privilege of presenting to the House a<br />
statement of the decisions which the Commonwealth Govern ment has so<br />
far taken. Some matters have yet to be finally dealt with; but we<br />
considered that there should be no delay in dealing with the main<br />
recommendations, having regard to what the Committee has described as<br />
" the need for immediate action in 1958,1959 and 1960 if the position"<br />
( of the Universities) " is not to be catastrophic".<br />
But before I announce the particular decisions, I should<br />
make some remarks to explain the setting in which the problem is being<br />
looked at and the reasons for what miay be regarded by some as a<br />
departure from normal Commonwealth practice.<br />
V Iti sof course true that, under the Australian Constitutional<br />
division of powers between Commonwealth and State, education is in the<br />
State field. It has been dealt with in a progressive manner by State<br />
1Governments and Parliaments at a rapidly growing cost; this cost being<br />
very naturally a material factor in the steep increase in tax reimbursements<br />
and special grants to States in recent years. We are not<br />
pronloting any idea that the legislative power over education Should,<br />
by * a Constitutional amendment,. be transferred to the Commonwealth.<br />
KThe idea of uniformity can be carried too far.<br />
In both primary and secondary education each State, with highly<br />
varying conditions of climate and occupational opportunities, is in the<br />
best position to judge for itself its own most suitable educational<br />
curriculum and organisation. Such matters are not best or most </p>
<p>-3<br />
flexibly dealt with from one national centre. Experience has shown<br />
the advantages of local policy and administration in the educational<br />
field. Why then has the Commonwealth Government come into this matter<br />
at the tertiary or university level? That it should do so in the<br />
Capital Territory is, of course, inevitable. The Australian National<br />
University and the Canberra University College are clearly its responsibility<br />
and not that of any other Government. But we have pursued an active<br />
policy in relation to the Universities generally for reasons which have<br />
seemed to us to be of inevitable and special importance and urgency.<br />
Our view of their urgency has been much sharpened by the report of the<br />
Murray Committee. Since this report and the decisions of the Commonwealth<br />
Government mark, as I hope and believe, the beginning of a new and<br />
brighter chapter in the history of the Australian Universities; and as<br />
our acceptance of much greater financial responsibilities should, if<br />
it is not to lend itself to loose generalisation, be clearly related<br />
to its own special circumstances, I will take a little time to summarise<br />
the particular elements which justify and seem to us to require special<br />
Commonwealth action.<br />
The whole feature of University education is that, upon the<br />
basis of a general mental training achieved by the primary and secondary<br />
systems, it provides, for those willing and able to undergo it, special<br />
and higher training. Such training leads to the acquisition of<br />
recognised degrees, the attainment of high professional qualifications,<br />
the entrance to higher research, particularly but not exclusively in<br />
science and technology, and the securing of those immeasurable and<br />
civilised benefits which flow or should flow from the study of, or<br />
association with the students of, humane letters.<br />
The University is not a professional " shop", though in my<br />
day we used to identify our own by that mercantile name. As the word<br />
implies, the University must not be narrow or unduly specialist in its<br />
outlook. It must teach and encourage the free search for the truth.<br />
That search must increasingly extend to, but is not to be confined to,<br />
the physical resources of the world or of space. The scientist is<br />
of great and growing importance, and what we propose to do will, I<br />
believe, enable many more scientists to be trained in proper<br />
circumstances and with improved tuition, buildings and equipment.<br />
But I hope that we will not, under current pressures or<br />
emotions, be tempted to ignore the basic fact that civilisation in<br />
the true sense requires a close and growing attention, not only to </p>
<p>-4<br />
science in all its branches, but also to those studies of the mind<br />
and spirit of man, of history and literature and language and mental<br />
and moral philosophy, of human relations in society and industry, of<br />
international understanding, the relative neglect of which has left<br />
a gruesome mark on this century.<br />
Let us have more scientists, and more humanists. Let the<br />
scientists be touched and informed by the humanities. Let the humanists<br />
be touched and informed by science, so that they may not be lost in<br />
abstractions derived from out-dated knowledge or circumstances.<br />
That proposition underlies the whole University idea. It warrants and<br />
requires a great variety of faculties and the constant intermingling of<br />
those who engage in their disciplines.<br />
To perform these vital tasks our Universities must be equipped<br />
in a very practical way to meet the challenge which, both in quality and<br />
quantity, becomes more urgent and insistent every day.<br />
I have indulged in these general reflections, not because the<br />
Government has any reservations about the urgent and growing need for<br />
more scientific training, a need which has been more and more clear<br />
in recent times, but because it would be unfortunate for the Universities<br />
themselves if the balanced conception of higher education came to be<br />
regarded as out of date.<br />
I will not take up time by making extensive quotations from the<br />
report. I will content myself by pointing out that the Committee has<br />
detected and clearly stated some of the most important elements in the<br />
problem of the present and future of our Universities.<br />
They make it clear that we are suffering from a grave shortage<br />
of University graduates. They refer with great force to the fact that<br />
even 25 years ago there was a theory that most nations were over-producing<br />
graduates and that the pattern of the future might well be " that industrial<br />
commnunities would be run by machines and unskilled labour, the whole<br />
direction and control being in the hands of a few very brilliant and<br />
well-trained experts"-. This illusion has disappeared. As they say:<br />
" The post-war community calls for more and more highly educated people<br />
all along the line, and in particular for more and more graduates of<br />
an increasing variety of kinds. Industry and commerce call for more.<br />
graduates, government and public administration call for more graduates,<br />
and all the services of the welfare state call for more graduates.<br />
The proportion of the population which is called upon to give professional<br />
or technical services of one kind or another is increasing every day;<br />
and the proportion of such people who have to be graduates is increasing<br />
also." </p>
<p>They sum that matter up in a few words:<br />
" High intellectual ability is in short supply, and no<br />
country can afford to waste it; every boy or girl with the necessary<br />
brain power must, in the national interest, be encouraged<br />
to come forward for a University education, and there must be<br />
a suitable place in a good University for everyone who does<br />
come forward."<br />
They emphasise that education is only one of the two central<br />
aims of the University, the other being research. They make an<br />
interesting and important comment upon the nature of our population<br />
growth, a growth which is accompanied by the characteristic concentration<br />
of population in the cities.<br />
" Not only has the rate of increase outpaced the capacity<br />
of the schools and universities, but it is also weighting the<br />
younger age groups to an extent that is not experienced in<br />
countries whose population is not growing so rapidly; * this is<br />
a factor which entails a relatively greater deployment of<br />
resources into the building of schools and universities than<br />
would be necessary if the population were more evenly distributed<br />
among the age groups."<br />
Again there is the most practical consideration that the enormous<br />
development of, and capital investment in industry, both primary and<br />
secondary, has been accompanied by relatively high production costs. if<br />
our capital resources are to be used to full advantage, there must be<br />
more expertise and a growing demand on the Universities.<br />
It is, therefore, clear that the demand for all Universities'<br />
graduates is bound to rise. There are, the Committee finds, shortages of<br />
graduates in Arts, of economists, lawyers, doctors, dentists, agriculturalists<br />
and veterinary scientists, no less than of scientists and industrial<br />
technologists. In addition to these, the secondary schools, providing an<br />
education to matriculation standards, are making a heavy demand on<br />
Universities for graduates in Arts, Mathematics, and Science. That<br />
demand is unsatisfied, with the result that we find ourselves in<br />
something of a vicious circle, the University students being numerically<br />
limite * d by the supply of teachers in the schools, and the supply of teachers<br />
in the schools being limited by the insufficient number of University<br />
graduates. For 1960-61, Government and non-Government schools will<br />
require an annual intake of 450 mathematics and science teachers. But </p>
<p>-6<br />
the output of science graduates from all Universities in 1957 for all<br />
purposes is likely to be little more than 500.<br />
Another striking fact of the very many set out in a report<br />
which I hope will be widely read is this: There are today 36,000<br />
University students in Australia. The numbers are growing. The<br />
size of first-year classes already presents overwhelming difficulties,<br />
resulting in many cases in the adoption of quotas. Yet the Committee<br />
has reached the conclusion that the total number will, if provided for,<br />
grow to 70,000 in 1965 and possibly to 80,000 by 1967, which is only<br />
ten years hence:<br />
The position would be slightly less disturbing if we were<br />
getting, if I may use the expression, " full value" out of those who<br />
are or become undergraduates. But we are~ not. The failure rate is<br />
alarming. Thus, of the 1951 first-year entrants,' only 6lper cent passed<br />
first ' year in 1951; only 35 per cent graduated in the minimum time; and<br />
only 58 per cent are expected to graduate at all. This failure rate is,*<br />
in the words of the Committee, " a national extravagance". It reduces<br />
the efficiency of the Universities, and it grievously lessens the<br />
national resources of trained graduates.<br />
What are the reasons for this waste?<br />
The Committee did not find any reason to suppose that the matriculation<br />
standards are lower than they used to be. It seems to me that they<br />
regarded as the effective reasons several large and significant matters.<br />
Classes are much too big. The personal contact with the<br />
lecturer is greatly reduced at the very time when the disciplined<br />
school-boy becomes a self-reliant adult and needs to have guidance as<br />
well as freedom. There is clearly far too low a proportion of staff to students;<br />
much lower than in Great Britain where, incidentally, the failure rate,<br />
for a variety of reasons, including a more selective admission of<br />
students, is much lower.<br />
The pressure of work, particularly in the science faculties,<br />
has been greatly increased by complex modern discoveries and the opening<br />
of an immense variety of new avenues of knowledge.<br />
Building and equipment are alike inadequate. Lack of<br />
accommodation extends to class-rooms, laboratories, libraries,<br />
common-rooms, and those student amenities, including sporting facilities,<br />
which are an essential element in a full undergraduate life. There is<br />
gross over-crowding and many make-shift buildings. The shortage of </p>
<p>-7<br />
equipment and materials becomes more acute every year. In the<br />
physical sciences, out-of-date equipment represents a grave handicap.<br />
This no doubt has something to do with the finding that there is a<br />
serious general weakness of honours and post-graduate research schools.<br />
This is not due to any lack of general aptitude, for Australia has<br />
produced more than its due proportion of distinguished research workers.<br />
It is primarily due to lack of encouragement and of facilities.<br />
Staff salaries are too low to attract and retain the<br />
necessary number of first-class lecturers and instructors.<br />
Scientific and technological education and research are<br />
naturally but increasingly most expensive as comparedwith other<br />
faculties. Thus, in the Melbourne University, the Faculty of Law<br />
with 702 students costs at present œ 27,381; the Faculty of<br />
Engineering, with 482 students, costs œ 187,301.<br />
All of these considerations seem to us to m--rk out the<br />
University problem as one which possesses special difficulty and<br />
urgency, which call for unorthodox Commonwealth action.<br />
On the machinery side, the Committee is of opinion that there<br />
is inadequate liaison between the academic body and the policy-making<br />
and controlling Senate or Council. The Vice-Chancellor, in their<br />
view, should become the academic leader as well as the Executive<br />
Officer for overall policy.<br />
The Committee recommends that there should be an Australian<br />
University Grants Committee, to develop a national policy, to<br />
co-ordinate the work of the Universities, to co-ordinate the work in<br />
this field of the Commonwealth and State Governments, to examine<br />
proposals for the creation of new institutions, and to plan University<br />
development generally.<br />
Finally, on the financial side, the Committee has been inevitably<br />
struck by the ever-increasing budgetary difficulties of the Universities,<br />
difficulties which beset and hamper the mere carrying on of their present<br />
activities. They have also reached the conclusion that the capital<br />
provision for the Universities must be dramatically increased if the<br />
future is to be looked at with anything less than despair. They<br />
recommend that the Commonwealth should enter the field of capital<br />
provision. They sum their view up in one sentence. " State funds are no<br />
longer adequate to meet the existing situation. If the States' financial<br />
resources have'not enabled them * to meet the Universities' needs up to<br />
the present, they will certainly be inadequate to put things right<br />
and get ready in time for the inevitable expansion which lies ahead.<br />
The efforts of the States require to be supplemented and speeded up." </p>
<p>8-<br />
The Commonwealth Government has, in fact, been finding<br />
increasing sums of money for the State Universities. The annual<br />
grants for recurrent purposes have risen from œ 1,103,000 in 1951 ( when<br />
the scheme began) to œ E2,300,000 in 1957; in addition to which we<br />
pay, through the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, the fees of no less<br />
than one-third of all the full-time students in the Universities.<br />
The State Governments have also devoted increasing attention to this<br />
problem. The Murray Committee states the position concisely in<br />
paragraph 67 of its report:<br />
" The States have endeavoured to afford special treatment<br />
to their Universities in the allocation of their funds.<br />
Between 1950-51 and 1955-56, the States' revenue from income<br />
tax reimbursement grants, State taxation and special grants<br />
rose by 77 per cent, but their grants to the Universities<br />
rose by 123 per cent."<br />
Nothing could more vividly show how the Universities' problem<br />
has grown and is growing and how inescapable it is that the Commonwealth<br />
should accept an adequate share of a financial burden which probably<br />
no State could support by itself. It is, of course, ( and I think I<br />
should say this clearly) urfortunate that the Universities in Australia<br />
should be overwhelmingly dependent upon the financial goodwill of<br />
Governments. But private benefactions have been isolated; endowments<br />
in total provide only a small fraction of the total income. The<br />
reason for this is pointed out by the Committee. In paragraph<br />
they state, and quite truly, that there are large sections of public<br />
opinion which are not yet aware of the facts and do not yet appreciate<br />
their implications. " Certainly they are not as much alive to the needs of the<br />
future in this country as they are in the United Kingdom and the United<br />
States. Indeed, they are not as sensitive in this matter as might<br />
have been expected. Australia has already benefited in quite<br />
spectacular fashion from the application of science in the primary<br />
industries; there is common agreement that, with a very high standard<br />
of living, secondary industry can only maintain its present promise of<br />
great achievement by technological and managerial skill and enterprise<br />
of the highest quality; and behind all this is the basic n eed to<br />
drive ahead with the development of a whole continent, vast areas<br />
of which, but for the benefit of science, must remain unproductive<br />
bush and barren desertAll this is becoming more fully recognised.<br />
What is not recognised is that this requires not a small num~ ber<br />
of very clever people, but a very large number indeed of very highly<br />
educated men and women, and that nothing short of this will do." </p>
<p>9-<br />
With this sketchy, but, I think, necessary preamble, I<br />
now turn to the decisions which the Government has already taken.<br />
Some of those decisions, as will be seen, relate to recommendations<br />
for joint action between the Commonwealth and the States. We are at<br />
once putting in hand discussions with the States on these matters, for<br />
it is only by close and true co-operation that the desired results<br />
can be secured. But we think it proper that we should at once<br />
indicate quite clearly our own willingness to co-operate along<br />
the lines which I will indicate.<br />
Our decisions are as follow<br />
1. We accept, in principle, the recommendation for the setting<br />
up of a permanent Australian Universities Committee. We are not<br />
satisfied that it should be called a " Grants" Committee, since that<br />
word may be thought, on Australian precedent, to indicate its functions<br />
too narrowly. We reserve for future but early consideration the<br />
composition of the Committee and its terms of reference. So that it<br />
may function to the greatest effect, and give the best guidance in<br />
co-operation between Governments and Universities, we would wish to<br />
have some discussion with the States before determining both composition<br />
and charter.<br />
2. We agree that this new body cannot be expected to function<br />
with sufficient knowledge and experience to make recommendations for an<br />
earlier year than 1961. We, therefore, accept the view that the<br />
special needs of the Universities for 1958, 1959 and 1960 should be<br />
dealt with by decisions now taken; these years being regarded as an<br />
interim and, in a real sense, emergency period.<br />
3. On the side of recurrent expenditure, which covers day to day<br />
running, the present Commonwealth grant to the States for their<br />
Universities is, as I have said, million. Broadly, the basis<br />
is Commonwealth for each œ 3 of State grants, plus fees. We accept<br />
the recommendation that the Commonwealth grants ( on the same terms)<br />
be raised 10 per cent. each year for 1L958, 1959 and 1960. This<br />
will raise the Commonwealth grants to<br />
1958 2,568,500<br />
1959 œ. 2,825,400<br />
1960 œ. 3,107,900<br />
This makes a total of œ-8,501,800 for these three years compared with<br />
Commonwealth Grants totalling œ. 6,040,930 in the three years 1955,<br />
1956 and 1957. </p>
<p>4. The ordinary Commonwealth Grants to Canberra University<br />
College will also increase by 10 per cent. each year. This will<br />
raise the grants from œ 341,735 in total for the last three years to<br />
œ-582,000 in total for the next three years.<br />
As to the Australian National University as with the<br />
Canberra University College, we will, of course, continue to face<br />
up to our own responsibilities. The Committee has recommended that<br />
grants to the Australian National University be increased and,<br />
bearing in mind the Committee's words that some modification may be<br />
required, we accept their figures which total œ 4,396,000 for the<br />
three years 1958, 1959 and .1960, compared with a total of œ 2,804,500<br />
for the years 1955, 1956 and 1957.<br />
6. As an additional unmatched emergency grant, not conditional<br />
as in the case of normal recurrent expenditure, we will grant to the<br />
States for their Universities, as recommended<br />
Elm in 1958<br />
11.5m in 1959<br />
12m in 1960<br />
or a three years' total of 14.5m.<br />
7. Similarly, an emergency grant will be made, as recommended,<br />
to the Canberra University College of œ 67,000, spread over the three<br />
years. 8. We accept the view that University staff salaries should be<br />
increased. We think that there is merit in the Committee's<br />
recommendation that there should be an increase of œ 500 per annum<br />
in professorial salaries, with appropriate rates of increase in the<br />
salaries of other academic staff. The estimated total cost of this,<br />
on existing staff establishments, would be œ 750,000 per annum. Our<br />
share, under the existing formula, would be œ E187,500 per annum. We<br />
are willing to find this.<br />
9. Apart from this, we will provide for similar additional<br />
allowances for salary increases in the Australian National University<br />
and the Canberra University College. The estimated cost of this is<br />
roughly œ 150,000 for the three years.<br />
The total cost to the Commonwealth of decisions 8 and 9<br />
will be of the order of œ 712,000 over the three years. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
11. We do not at present contribute to the cost of State<br />
University buildings and major equipment. The Committee has recommended<br />
a building programme for each University over the next three years, and<br />
has suggested that in each State, except Western Australia and Tasmania,<br />
the cost be divided œ 91 for œ 1 between Commonwealth and State.<br />
In the case of Western Australia and Tasmania they recommend<br />
Commonwealth for œ 1 State. We accept these principles.<br />
12. Before setting out the financial implications of this<br />
acceptance, I want to make it clear that capital provision by the<br />
Commonwealth assumes, and is indeed conditional upon, the carrying<br />
out by the States of their normal contemplated programmes. The<br />
Commonwealth capital grants are to be, in nett terms, additional and<br />
not by way of replacement of State expenditure. Only in this way<br />
can the fullest benefit be conferred.<br />
13, If Honourable Members will look at Table 11 in paragraph<br />
408 of the Report, they will see the figures. We expect the<br />
" Possible State Contributions" there set out to be realised. Exc * ept<br />
in one case,. they represent a continuance of the present level of State<br />
capital expenditure. If the State contributions set out in Table 11<br />
are in fact made, we accept the recommendation that, in 1958, 1959 and<br />
1960, the Commonwealth should contribute to capital expenditure<br />
( a thing we have not hitherto done) a total of œ E6,270,000.<br />
These figures, of course, relate to the State Universities.<br />
The Committee also recommended that there should be a<br />
contribution by the Commonwealth Government for the equipping of new<br />
buildings calculated at 16 per cent, of its share of the cost of the new<br />
buildings ( U6,270,000), or œ 1I, 003,000, leaving the universities to find<br />
the balance from additional State grants, from gifts from industry and<br />
other non-State sources. We accept this recommendation.<br />
14. Recommendations about capital expenditure on the * Australian<br />
National University have been made, and we note them to be not very<br />
different from the present rate of capital expenditure. The general<br />
order of the recommendations, which is for œ 1,070,000 over the next<br />
three years, appears acceptable but, in any case, as I have said we will<br />
continue to meet our responsibilities in relation to the Commonwealth<br />
Universities, The recommendations relating to the Canberra University College<br />
are deferred pending a decision on the special question as to the<br />
future development and association of these two bodies. The answer<br />
to this question has not been fully worked out by the Committee.<br />
We propose to examine it promptly. </p>
<p>12<br />
We have considered the residential University Colleges, to<br />
which the Committee and the Government attach value and significance.<br />
We accept the recommendation ( in paragraph 196) that the Comm~ onwealth<br />
should offer, for the next three years, capital grants for the building<br />
and equipping of, or extensions to, such Colleges, on the basis of<br />
œ 21 for every œ 21 provided by State Governments or other sources, with the<br />
recommended limitations that total Commonwealth grants so given should<br />
not exceed œ 2200,000 in the first year, œ 400,000 in the first two<br />
years, or œ 9600,000 in the whole three year period.<br />
16. We have noted that the Committee was of opinion that various<br />
aspects of the Commionwealth Scholarship Scheme should be the subject<br />
of further investigation. We will take the necessary steps to put<br />
the investigation in hand.<br />
17. It may assist a clear understanding of the magnitude of these<br />
propositions if I say that over the next 3 years the decisions I have<br />
already announced will, if acted upon by the States as well as by.<br />
ourselves, raise the Commonwealth expenditure in relation to the State<br />
universities from about œ 6,000,000 in 1955, 1956 and 1957 to about<br />
2~ 0,0 n15, 99ad16. In addition to this increase for<br />
the State universities, we shall be increasing our provision for the<br />
Australian National University and the Canberra University College<br />
on the lines I have indicated.<br />
I would like to make one final general observation.<br />
In my own undergraduate days, students were either scholarship holders,<br />
at a time when scholarships were few and difficult to ' win, or students<br />
maintained by relatively poor parents prepared to make great sacrifices<br />
for their children, or ( in probably a minority of cases) students whose<br />
parents could readily afford to sustain them through their courses<br />
of training. I can well remember a wry smile on hearing a Member of Parliament<br />
describe the Melbourne University of my day as a " bear garden of the<br />
idle rich." Old conceptions die hard. It is not yet adequately<br />
understood that a university education is not the perquisite of a<br />
privileged few.-It is not to be thought of merely in terms of the<br />
individual student. It has become demonstrably clear that a complex<br />
arnd highly industrialised7modern society has claims upon the universities<br />
which must-bo met, and has great responsibilities for seeing that those<br />
claims can be met.<br />
The social, scientific, economic and industrial complexities of<br />
Australia today are largely beyond the imagination of 40ryears ago. </p>

Great skill achieved after high training is no longer to be regarded<br />
as something to be admired in a few. We must, on a broad basis,<br />
become a more and more educated democracy if we are to raise our<br />
spirituhi, intellectual, and material living standards. Viewed in<br />
this way our universities are to be regarded not as a home of<br />
privilege for a few but as something essential to the lives of millions<br />
of people who may never enter their doors.<br />
This new charter for the universities should serve to<br />
open many doors and to give opportunity and advantage to many students.<br />
They will, I am sure, not forget that under all the circumstances I<br />
have described, the community is accepting heavy burdens in order that,<br />
through the training of university graduates, the community may be served.<br />
This represents a challenge to the whole future student body to take<br />
the fullest advantage of the chances which come to them; to see that<br />
future failure rates are not their fault; to realise more than ever that<br />
the contribution that they have to make to this great social effort<br />
is to be willingly and effectively made. A university may look to<br />
governments, and perhaps primarily to governments, for land and<br />
buildings and equipment. But its ultimate achievement will depend,<br />
as ever, upon the zeal and quality of its staff and of those who train under<br />
them. It is, I think, a happy thing that we should have had the<br />
opportunity of reviving our conception of the universities and their<br />
work by the presentation and discussion of this brilliant and<br />
provocative report. </p>
