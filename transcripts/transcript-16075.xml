    <content><![CDATA[<p>From 18-21 August, I will visit New Zealand, and then travel to Niue to attend the annual leaders' meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
<p>This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Closer Economic Relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The pact is widely regarded as one of the most successful and forward-looking economic and trade agreements in the world, and remains fundamental to close cross-Tasman ties.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing economic links with New Zealand Prime Minister, Miss Helen Clark, who I last met in Canberra in February this year.</p>
<p>Miss Clark and I will also speak at a major climate change conference in Auckland, on 19 August.</p>
<p>In Niue, I look forward to meeting with other Pacific leaders to discuss common action to tackle the region's political and economic challenges, including achieving the Millennium Development Goals, addressing the threat of climate change, and restoring democracy in Fiji.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with leaders Australia's new engagement with the region, as outlined in my Port Moresby Declaration, released in March.  </p>
