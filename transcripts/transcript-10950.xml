<p>Well thank you very much Kerry Bartlett, to Kevin Rizolli, the Mayor,</p>
<p> other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a delight for me to be back in the Hawkesbury. It is a delight</p>
<p> for me to be back in the electorate of Macquarie and to commend to</p>
<p> all of you in the strongest possible way what a tremendous job that</p>
<p> Kerry Bartlett has done as your representative in the National Parliament</p>
<p> since March of 1996.</p>
<p>The first responsibility of a local representative is to pursue the</p>
<p> interests of his or her constituents. And Kerry has certainly done</p>
<p> that, be it constantly pressing the case of the maintenance of the</p>
<p> RAAF base at Richmond as an operational base of the Defence Forces.</p>
<p> And I can say to you this morning that there is no intention on the</p>
<p> part of the Defence Department to close the Richmond base and, in</p>
<p> fact, the Defence Minister has been informing those who bothered to</p>
<p> enquire. And I repeat the assurance he has given that the Defence</p>
<p> position is that it will be operational Â‘til at least through</p>
<p> to the year 2010. And given the nature of these things that is a very,</p>
<p> very significant commitment by the RAAF.</p>
<p>Kerry has also been extremely active in pursuing the interests of</p>
<p> self-funded retirees, many of which reside in the electorate of Macquarie.</p>
<p> And it's been in no small measure due to his representations</p>
<p> that we were able in the last budget to announce a very significant</p>
<p> extension of the seniors' card to large sections of the self-funded</p>
<p> retiree population. And when I come in a moment to talk about our</p>
<p> tax plan I'll also have something to say about the provision</p>
<p> in that plan for self-funded retirees. He has also been very active</p>
<p> in pursuing environmental causes and as a result of his representations</p>
<p> there have been significant provisions of funds with more to come</p>
<p> for projects in the Macquarie electorate out of the Natural Heritage</p>
<p> Trust. He's also, as a person with a deep understanding of economic</p>
<p> issues, he's also played a very active role in promoting what</p>
<p> the Government has done to restore the health of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>I don't need to remind any audience in Australia that at the</p>
<p> present time there is a good deal of turmoil on world financial markets,</p>
<p> there is a good deal of international pressure on the Australian economy.</p>
<p> And it is a remarkable thing that the Australian economy has performed</p>
<p> so well and has withstood that pressure so effectively. And of all</p>
<p> the things that I would like, the last two-and-a-half years that the</p>
<p> Coalition Government being in office, to be regarded well it is the</p>
<p> way in which we have handled the Australian economy. We did inherit</p>
<p> an Australian economy that was substantially in the red and in just</p>
<p> over two years we have turned a deficit of $10.5 billion into a surplus.</p>
<p> And we actually did it a year ahead of time.</p>
<p>When we came into power the Federal Government owed $95 billion. By</p>
<p> the turn of the century, that will have been cut by more than half</p>
<p> and, in fact, on present projections by the turn of the century, or</p>
<p> the early years of the next century, we will have the lowest national</p>
<p> debt to GDP ratio that this country has ever had. We have delivered</p>
<p> the lowest interest rates in 30 years. The average homebuyer in Australia</p>
<p> has a mortgage of $100,000 and on that average mortgage that homebuyer</p>
<p> is $300 a month better off than two-and-a-half years ago. And that's</p>
<p> the equivalent of a payrise from the boss of $100 a week. And that</p>
<p> is a very important thing to the average Australian. That's rolled</p>
<p> gold quality benefit to the average Australian because there is nothing</p>
<p> more important still to the average Australian family man or woman</p>
<p> than the acquisition of a family home. And the acquisition of a family</p>
<p> home, and providing through the ownership of that family home a stable</p>
<p> environment in which to raise children is still the aspiration of</p>
<p> the overwhelming majority of Australians. And all walks of life, whatever</p>
<p> their politics are, whatever their background may be, and providing</p>
<p> a more secure economic base for the foundation of a stable family</p>
<p> environment is a very, very important thing that any government can</p>
<p> do.</p>
<p>And those reductions in interest rates have extended into the small</p>
<p> business area as well and small business is now enjoying lower interest</p>
<p> rates than it has had for decades. And we have also seen a very high</p>
<p> level of business investment and we have seen significant improvements</p>
<p> in the industrial relations laws of this country. Some sections of</p>
<p> the union movement haven't liked them but the rank and file of</p>
<p> the Australian people have liked them because they have encouraged</p>
<p> workers and their employers to get together at an enterprise level</p>
<p> and to reach agreement that are valuable for the individual enterprise.</p>
<p> And we place very great store on the quality of our economic management</p>
<p> and at a time of international turmoil you don't change the team</p>
<p> in charge when that team has handled the affairs of state so very</p>
<p> effectively and so very competently. And that is the very strong message</p>
<p> that I would give to the Australian people. It is because of the international</p>
<p> economic turmoil that you need a group of people who have got the</p>
<p> runs on board in charge. It's because of that international economic</p>
<p> pressure that you can't experiment with failed policies of deficit</p>
<p> and debt. And it's because of those challenges that you need</p>
<p> to continue to press forward with necessary change and reform.</p>
<p>Now, to some people change and reform can be threatening. To others</p>
<p> it can be very welcome. And the art of good leadership of good statecraft</p>
<p> is to change those things that need changing but to tenaciously defend</p>
<p> and to hold on to those things that oughtn't to be changed. I</p>
<p> believe in changing some things. I believe in hanging onto and preserving</p>
<p> other things. I want to change the things that are holding Australia</p>
<p> back. I want to hang onto those things that are still an expression</p>
<p> of Australian unity and Australian cohesion. And one of those things</p>
<p> that we should hang onto as an expression of Australian cohesion and</p>
<p> Australian unity is the tolerance that Australians have always displayed</p>
<p> towards people from all around the world. And one of the great things</p>
<p> about Australia is that we have accepted people from everywhere in</p>
<p> the world and we have amalgamated and cohered into a united Australian</p>
<p> nation. And I would never like to see Australia lose its instinct</p>
<p> for tolerance and decency towards people from other parts of the world.</p>
<p> Racial tolerance and racial understanding and the equality of treatment</p>
<p> of people, irrespective of their racial background, is one of those</p>
<p> Australian values that we should all fight to defend and preserve.</p>
<p> It's a great Australian value and it's a great Australian</p>
<p> tradition.</p>
<p>Something else that I would like to preserve and defend is this flag</p>
<p> that hangs behind me as an expression ...[audience applauds]....as</p>
<p> an expression of the unity and the history of the Australian nation.</p>
<p> Our Federal system of Government has worked well and we are going</p>
<p> to give it a shot in the arm at our tax reform plan. The centrality</p>
<p> of the family unit has the most cohesive social influence within our</p>
<p> society. That should not only be preserved but it should be strengthened</p>
<p> and encouraged and not denigrated by those forces in the Australian</p>
<p> community. There's nothing old-fashioned about stable families.</p>
<p> There's nothing that's more positive within a community</p>
<p> than strong family and apart from the emotional support they provide</p>
<p> to people they also happen to be the most efficient social welfare</p>
<p> system that mankind has ever devised.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things that in our society that are good and</p>
<p> are worth preserving and we should unite to defend them. Our tolerance,</p>
<p> the importance of family life, our great national symbols such as</p>
<p> the flag, and our Federal system of Government. Now, they are the</p>
<p> things we ought to keep and those people who come along and say we</p>
<p> want to get rid of them, they ought to be opposed. But on the other</p>
<p> hand there are things that are holding Australia back and just because</p>
<p> getting rid of them involves further change we shouldn't shy</p>
<p> away from that change. And one of those things, of course, and it's</p>
<p> something on everybody's mind at the moment is our present taxation</p>
<p> system. Our present taxation system is creaking and groaning and lurching</p>
<p> towards its last days. And unless we have the honesty and the candour</p>
<p> as a nation to face the need and the reality of the need for fundamental</p>
<p> reform, we are going to lose the economic battle in the years ahead.</p>
<p> Because if you have an inefficient taxation system, you have an inefficient</p>
<p> Australian economy. And, of course, we face challenges from overseas,</p>
<p> but we must press ahead with taxation reform.</p>
<p>Those people who say that because of the Asian turmoil we should stop</p>
<p> reform, are completely wrong. It is because of the Asian challenge</p>
<p> that we must press ahead with taxation reform. We have a taxation</p>
<p> system now that was built on an economy that was overwhelmingly based</p>
<p> on manufacturing industry in the 1930s. We have an indirect tax system</p>
<p> that has no application to service industries at all, yet 65 per cent</p>
<p> of the Australian economy is now services. And if we don't do</p>
<p> something about repairing or modernising our indirect taxation system,</p>
<p> we will not have the resources in the future to provide the welfare</p>
<p> support, the hospitals, the roads, the schools, the police services</p>
<p> that our community needs.</p>
<p>I want to take on the argument advanced by some people in the welfare</p>
<p> sector Â– and I stress some Â– because there are very divided</p>
<p> views in the welfare sector on this, that in some way the introduction</p>
<p> of a goods and services tax is a threat to welfare services. Can I</p>
<p> say that it offers a life raft to welfare services because what the</p>
<p> introduction of a goods and services tax will do is to provide a more</p>
<p> stable revenue base in the years into the future. The problem with</p>
<p> the present taxation system is that it is leaking. It doesn't</p>
<p> apply to everybody. A lot of people evade it. A lot of people dodge</p>
<p> their responsibilities, and if we can replace the existing wholesale</p>
<p> sales tax system with a comprehensive goods and services tax at a</p>
<p> lower rate, that will provide great assurance into the future that</p>
<p> the money will be there to provide the roads and the schools and the</p>
<p> hospitals and the welfare services. Apart from anything else, out</p>
<p> of our plan, we are going to give a greater guarantee of revenue to</p>
<p> the States and they will get more as the years go by under our plan</p>
<p> and they have the direct responsibility for police, for hospitals,</p>
<p> in the main for roads and for a lot of other social securities, and</p>
<p> of course security, and the primary responsibility for education.</p>
<p>We are arguing taxation reform because it is in the long term interests</p>
<p> of Australia. The debate about taxation is not just about how it affects</p>
<p> you and me but it is how it affects our whole nation and more than</p>
<p> anything else I would like our plan to be supported because it will</p>
<p> strengthen Australia and strengthen the Australian economy. It will</p>
<p> give us a secure revenue base. It will stop the leakage and cheating</p>
<p> and rorting that now occurs. It will reduce the cost of doing business</p>
<p> in this country because under our plan every item, every input item</p>
<p> to the production of a good or service, the tax on that will be fully</p>
<p> rebatable. You can claim it back in full, unlike the present system,</p>
<p> where because of the operation of the cascading effect of the wholesale</p>
<p> tax system, there are many taxes embedded in the costs of producing</p>
<p> goods and services in Australia. It has been estimated that it will</p>
<p> reduce the cost of business by about $10, 000 million a year, and</p>
<p> it will reduce the cost of exports by $4500 million a year. Now, in</p>
<p> a hostile world trading environment, with the Asian economies in a</p>
<p> very fragile situation and every country fighting like crazy to get</p>
<p> its market share, what could be more important than to reduce the</p>
<p> cost of Australian exports, because we've got to export to survive.</p>
<p> We are a trading nation. We have only 18 million people. We can't</p>
<p> seal ourselves off from the rest of the world and hope that we can</p>
<p> just rest contented within our vast continent. What we have to do</p>
<p> is go out and sell and succeed and compete on world markets. Our men</p>
<p> and women who export can do well providing they get the best help</p>
<p> the Government can provide and the best help the Government can provide</p>
<p> is to take the taxes off the back of exporters. And by introducing</p>
<p> a goods and services tax, exports will be GST free and the input costs</p>
<p> will be completely free of taxation. So therefore we'll be giving</p>
<p> a huge kick along to our exporters.</p>
<p>Now I know this change is, in the eyes of some people, big. It is</p>
<p> big. And some people may not think it is easy. But we really have</p>
<p> reached that stage in our history where we can't have the easy</p>
<p> bits without the fundamental reform. You can't hope, as I said</p>
<p> the other night, to play in the grand final without going to training.</p>
<p> You can't hope to present yourself at the HSC without having</p>
<p> studied hard and expect to succeed. And the same thing applies with</p>
<p> fixing our tax system. The easy lazy option is to say: well you can</p>
<p> all have a tax cut and I'll be happy and go we'll away have</p>
<p> a party and that's marvellous. But you can't do that. We</p>
<p> are providing an alcove for a significant personal income tax cuts.</p>
<p> But we are also doing the harder bits. We're also facing the</p>
<p> need to reform the system and that's the issue. Because if you</p>
<p> just give tax cuts and you don't fix the system they'll</p>
<p> disappear like melting snow in the hot sun. They won't last.</p>
<p> It's like building a fancy house on insecure foundations. You've</p>
<p> got to fix the foundations otherwise the house will get rolled over</p>
<p> at the first sign of a storm. They may be old analogies but they remain</p>
<p> true today in relation to taxation as they were in other circumstances.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a stage in our nation's</p>
<p> economic history where compared with most other countries we're</p>
<p> doing very well. We have got low inflation, low interest rates. We've</p>
<p> got our debt down, we've got our Budget back in the balance.</p>
<p> We've generated 300,000 new jobs over the last two-and-a-half</p>
<p> years. We've improved our industrial relations system. But we</p>
<p> still face enormous challenges from overseas and the only way you</p>
<p> can beat them off is to be competitive and strong and you can't</p>
<p> be competitive and strong in the 1990s if you have a 1930s taxation</p>
<p> system. And it's for the sake of Australia's economic strength</p>
<p> more than for the sake of any individual section of the Australian</p>
<p> economy that we put forward this taxation plan. We are not doing it</p>
<p> for this group or that group. We are doing it for the future of the</p>
<p> Australian economy and the future economic strength of the Australian</p>
<p> nation. And I want our tax plan to be judged on what it does for the</p>
<p> entire country. I want it to be judged on the gift that it bequeaths</p>
<p> to future generations of Australians into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Now I do feel very strongly committed to it because I believe it is</p>
<p> in the long term interests of our country. I believe that it will</p>
<p> strengthen our economy. I believe that it will strengthen our families.</p>
<p> The reduction in fuel excise will reduce the costs of transporting</p>
<p> goods around this vast country of ours. Geoffrey Blainey coined that</p>
<p> evocative phrase years ago of the tyranny of distance. And he talked</p>
<p> then of the distance of Australia from Europe but you can equally</p>
<p> talk of the distance between one part of Australia and another. And</p>
<p> if you reduce the cost of carrying goods and services over those vast</p>
<p> distances then I believe you are striking a blow against the tyranny</p>
<p> of distance.</p>
<p>Now ladies and gentleman, Kerry Bartlett has played a very significant</p>
<p> role in shaping the votes and the arguments and the advocacy of the</p>
<p> Government particularly, but not only, in the areas affecting the</p>
<p> Australian economy. I've spoke earlier of his commitment to the</p>
<p> interests of self-funded retirees and one of the things that we've</p>
<p> taken very great care to do in putting together our tax plan is to</p>
<p> ensure that there is adequate support and adequate protection for</p>
<p> the retired section of the Australian community. We've introduced</p>
<p> a 30% tax deduction for the cost of private health insurance to take</p>
<p> effect from January next year. We're introducing a thing called</p>
<p> refundable imputation credits. Sounds complicated but it's not.</p>
<p> If you're a shareholder and your tax rate is less than 36% and</p>
<p> you've got a franked dividend from the company you know exactly</p>
<p> what a refundable imputation credit is. It means that if you pay 20</p>
<p> cents at the margin and 36 is being paid on the share you get 16 refunded</p>
<p> from the taxation office and that's something that you've</p>
<p> never been able to get under the present arrangement. We're going</p>
<p> to abolish something called provision of taxation which has been the</p>
<p> bane of existence of a lot of self-funded retirees and a lot of men</p>
<p> and women in businesses and on the land. And we're also providing</p>
<p> of course for special payments for people 60 years and over of $1000</p>
<p> in relation to their investment income and a further $2000 for self-funded</p>
<p> retirees of pensionable age. And on top of that of course, for all</p>
<p> pensioners there will be an increase in the pension of 4% up front</p>
<p> on the first of July in the year 2000.</p>
<p>And don't believe the scare campaign that that is inadequate</p>
<p> because it is not. It is 1.5% or more ahead of the projected increase</p>
<p> in the cost of living which across the economy we calculate to be</p>
<p> 1.9% as a result of the introduction of the goods and services tax.</p>
<p> Some people say that that's too low. I noticed in the papers</p>
<p> this morning that a respected economic intelligence union called Â‘Econotech'</p>
<p> released a report through KPMG, the Italian firm, that calculated</p>
<p> at the price effect of a GST was nothing more than 0.9% which is less</p>
<p> than half the calculation made by the Federal Treasury. We think the</p>
<p> Treasury calculation is right. It's not a political calculation,</p>
<p> it's an economic calculation.</p>
<p>So my friends, can I finish by saying that it is a great pleasure</p>
<p> to be back in the Hawkesbury electorate. As somebody who grew up in</p>
<p> Sydney and who spent a good deal of time over the years because of</p>
<p> family connections in areas around the Castle Hills and Pennant Hills</p>
<p> and Baulkham Hills. It's an area that is not unfamiliar to me</p>
<p> and I've visited on many occasions. And Kerry holds an electorate</p>
<p> that straddles different parts of New South Wales and different parts</p>
<p> of the Blue Mountains and of course the Hawkesbury. He represents</p>
<p> it very well, he represents it very effectively and he is a person</p>
<p> of this electorate for this electorate and I very, very warmly commend</p>
<p> you to him and I ask you to give him every encouragement and every</p>
<p> support as your federal member.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
