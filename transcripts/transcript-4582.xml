We promised to end L~ abor's taN ripoff. Everyonie's taxes havebec-<br />

These tax cuts are fair, People on average earnings of $ 10,000<br />
a year will pay a marginal rate of tax of only 32 centa in thle<br />

L~ abor proiniaes the moon. What are La-borls Promises w.-ortha nothing.<br />
In his 1972' policy speech, Pir. V-hitlam prorniseda nd I qoolte his<br />
exact words: " Labor* lrs first priority wAll be to restore genuir.<br />
full ezloyment without hedginq, without qvalification."<br />
in his 1974 policy speech m4r. vwhitiam said: ' IN-promised to reatore<br />
cull tlovrent we have restored it inAtal aoi,~ oy<br />
and inflation do not march side by side."<br />
Wilat a bar-e faced effrontery. Thi3 from a government that increaemed<br />
unemployment by almost 200,000 in One Year alOne, that pushed<br />
infLlation up to 19% in the second half of 1974. The Aostralian<br />
people won'!, ever he fooled again by A4r. Whitlaza. With his policy<br />
Speech lying in ruins, undermined by his cmi, menageria of econcmic<br />
spoesienand panicked by the w-eekend oplnioi polls, 14r. VhItlatm<br />
is q0Ing ! Or bro0ke.<br />
iHis political tactics have alwaysa been crash through or cra-sh. U<br />

deceptions. Yesterday, Mr. 14hitlam claimed that Labor would redoee . ue~ loyront<br />
by at least'-100,000 people. But only a few days ' earlier Ar. Hiayden<br />
h-acd cl.--imed that Labor would reduce unemployiztnt by onel half of one<br />
rp r cent, that is 30t000 ' people.<br />
rir, Wihit 1am has mnagically created 70,000 jobs, with juxst a stroke<br />

Tecuce inflation by 5% in the next twelve nionths. But in his policy<br />
rpeech he claimd Labor woiuld reduce it by Hlis speech writers had<br />
been at it again.<br />
You know that speech writer wrote a biography of M4r. ' Whitlam called<br />
Certain Grandeur*. I think that mA Certain Deluosion of Grandeur<br />
io% 21d hav-e been a more iapproptdate title.<br />
vir. 1Whitlam wants a inassive increase in personal irca. o4a tax, a retu-rn<br />
to the old inigh marainal tax ratea. A ' rash"' s-. ending progra--e<br />
woul~ d run at a rate of $ 1600 million a yearover -tw-tbirds Of ouX<br />

infii~ yoiEPrOm5s, 1 rt-L b i Iion:-, olar tha t beha. O .1 </p>
<p>se-as no an-Ci-infat..~ on strategy his big spendirta, high tax, high<br />
-, aD a _ Pproach would increase interest rotes again. Labor Is<br />
i~' Lraaqance Ioud blow the emtbars of inflatio-t into the b gge3<br />
ccornomic bushf ire Australia has ever seen. H~ is economic bu~ hfi-3<br />
cudconsune the jobs and the savings of 7iustralia. It t~ ould<br />
erntire1\' burn out the foundations oi growth and prospe. rIty we have<br />
h,-ail1t. Given another chance, Mr-vi~ hitlarn would -make the years<br />
192-95 oo i~ apcnc.~ r. Vhitlam would actually. incr ise<br />
taxes, Labor would recall Parliament to repeal our February taA,<br />
ctt reforms. To pay for the abolition of payroll tax, Labour wouild<br />
have to increase personal ta. es by $ 850 million this year $ 1) 00<br />
million next. Labor's payroll tax scheme would not create employment.<br />
Iwith-in days of Mr. Whitlam's policy speecti, a survey of major<br />
en-i-ployers fournd that not one company forecast any Ancrease-in staff<br />
nmibers if payroll tax were lifted. Yet Labor should not be<br />
surprised. . The Premier of South Australia, U4r. Dunstan, made it<br />
clear in Seeptem-ber that he had tried a payroll remission sceme,<br />
and that it had failed. Only the present members of the Labor ParTty<br />
would seriously put forward a plan to rip huge sums in taxes from<br />
ordinary Australians and use them to pay big companies. I ask the<br />
working men and women of Australia do you want -to give $ 6 a week I<br />
to your company because that's where it would go annoob<br />
be created. hecmaishave said so.<br />
! jet's look at what some of the big companies would get:<br />
UTAH 2 M4ILLION<br />
CRA $ 10 MILLION<br />
B) P$ 33 miLLION<br />
film S 4.5 MILLION<br />

GE14rIPAL PMO1TORS $ 10 MILLION<br />
La~ bor's policies are a sore-fire recipe for economic disaster, more<br />
unemploynent, higher inflation, higher wages with lower investmentF<br />
and business confidence. Whitlan hasn't changemd, the Labor<br />
Party hasn't changed. No wonder a survey of 244 Victorian -mnufacturex<br />
last P~ riday showed that manufacturers overwhelmingly felt the return<br />
or a Labor administration would have adverse effecta on their<br />
busin~ ess. Small firms, with less than 100 cemrployes had the least<br />
conf idence . in a Labox coveirLent. Comparcd with a si-Millar stu. rvev<br />
6uvinq the 1975 election.. -there is iEvpn less confidence in La.-, or now<br />
thnthere wa5 then. Labor's confusion arid socialist ideology weould<br />

ardSenator Wreidt say Labor is conmitted to an in= i-diate r,-<br />
structu*-ing qf industry. We all know what that means they want to<br />
rtructure tens oF thousands of Australians on to the dole.<br />
Axirztralia enjoyed 20 yeas of full ewployment under auccessive<br />
Liberal Goverrnmeit3. in just three years, the Whitlam Goven~ nt<br />
Iii-ade unemploymnent a major problein, with their ext-ravagance, their<br />
hi. gh wages policy, aynd their indiscriminate tariff cuta.<br />
t~ hey re ca lling for the disantling of protection. They refusei<br />
iD. uarit blank to bacA the support we . have given to the alzivaral, tL<br />
LId -footwear industries Which arp major employers throughou. t utl<br />
They refused because they said they were a free trade party.<br />
Th7. e consequences of thia callous betrayal of working Australians areD<br />
k-,"; fense. As the Executive Director of the Australian Cone-eration<br />
oi Apparel. Manufacturers said: " No Andustry could be Ceyftain Of<br />
SUX-VIVal 44f a bLbor Party came into power.*<br />
-with a Liberal Government, each industry and the inen and wom~ en<br />
ei-, ployed in each industry can rest assured they ' will receive the<br />
protection they ne-ed. We have increased protection for industries<br />
with a total employment of -over a quarter of a imillion Australians.<br />
Our long-term policy i3 to concentrate our efforts or, tilt things<br />

in dustry now when unemployment ia high and the economy A3 not : u". ing<br />
lfutl capa; i ty asa rrant nonsense. It is aeademic heory which<br />
nvolves bighly practical unemployment. That's what Mr. W* iitlam<br />
wants to do for the unemployed.<br />
our policies have the support of many Labor men. M4r. Dh~ stan . backs<br />
our stand on pxotection. In Singapore last-mionth he said, " it's a<br />
prFectly' proper thing for us to say... we can't allow our ipoet<br />
t be lessened by inarort, -which wtill niinply throw people into<br />
Ti-L w~ eek Rr. H-awke said he wanted Labor to pro-rise to maint. ain aiwplov:-<br />

Ov Whitlam. 1-13. ffay-den and Rir. Young. AbOut half the f, ctor~ ms<br />

<p>Labor refuses to give any firm assurances to these industries<br />
industries employing 120,000 people. So much for Labor'~ s professed<br />
concern f or unemployment. Which other industries~ has Labor m~ arkied<br />
for the guillotine? Is it the wood, wood products and furniture<br />
industries, with employment of 73,000? Paper andA paper products<br />
and printing, employing 97,000? Basic chemicals and related<br />
products, 56,000? Appliances and electrical equipment, 81,000?<br />
industrial machinery and scientific eqiiipommtp 80,000?<br />
The only job fir. WThitlam is anxious to protect is him own as Leader.<br />
It's no worider M4r. Hawke is going around the pubs saying Mir. Wbitlaa's<br />
stature has diminished. Mr.. Hawke says the Labor Party used to be<br />
Cough Whitlam. but it isn't any longer. No doubt he had in mind<br />
Mr. Whitlam's single most powerful election prosise to resign within<br />
two years. 14r. IWhitlan has PrOalsed it. Mir. Hlayden has promised it.<br />
Ir. Hawke has promised it. It's about the only proaeiae they curently<br />
agree on. But people should be6 beware. This promaise is likely to<br />
be as reliable as all his other promises. Labor ) hasn't changed<br />
its still. the p-arty of confusion, contradiction an~ d conflict.<br />
After weeks of hopeless confusion on tax indexation, payroll. tax.,<br />
uraniumi and wages pol. icy, Labor's half dozen economiic spokesmen had<br />
a .90-minute five-way telephone hook-up. r Whitlam was left<br />
out of this happy hook-up. -He has gota major hang-up over that.<br />
At the end of thils ' 90-minute marathon Mr. Hawke annoujneed " absolute<br />
consensus" had been reached and promptly gave three conflicting<br />
versions on wages policy in the space of a one pa~ e stat~ ment. if<br />
that's Labor'Is idea of concensus, imagine what a disagreement would<br />
be like.<br />
N ? r* Whitlamls complaining about pe ople who ring him up on talk-back<br />
shows. He says that people who ring him up are all Liberal supporters<br />
I think he is right there are millions of Liberals all over Australia<br />
and the number is growing each day. Poor Mr Whitlam. He cannot talk<br />
to his colleagues, he won't talk to the press, and tie complains when h<br />
talks to the people. oon there will be no one left in the whole of<br />
Australia for Kr Whitlam to talk to.<br />
As for poor Mr Burford, he would lQve it if people stopped talking to<br />
him. When a journalist recently' asked him in Cairns what Labor's<br />
policy was on '' tax indexation, he said he couldn't say because he had<br />
only read the " Cairns Post'. ' But he-added he would be having a press<br />
conference a few days later, and he said he would make sure he had<br />
read some of the major city papers before then. But having read . the<br />
papers, he wisely-cancelled his press conference.<br />
What has become crystal clear over the last fortnight is that Labor<br />
does not understand'the economiy, has no coherent, agreed economic<br />
policies and, above all, has no effective Btrategy to reduce unemploymei<br />
Trhey are still the party of disunity, disagreement anid discord. In<br />
short, their policies would only serve to increase unemployment.<br />
one of the greatest causes of unemployment is unjustified industrial,<br />
diLsputes. ' in the Victorian power disrhute 450,000 people were laid off<br />
for weeks. 36,000 permnanently lost their jobs.<br />
one of our major achievements is that we have established the framework<br />
f or commonsense, justice and order in industrial relations. Labor for<br />
once are quite agreed on what they would do in this area repeal all<br />
our reforms protecting individual unionists and the general public;<br />
and place unions above the law. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Labor would repeal secret postal ballots for the election of union<br />
officials. Labor would repeal our laws which let unionists know<br />
how their union's funds are being spent. Labor would exempt unions<br />
from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Labor would repeal<br />
all penalties for strikes against Arbitration Commission decisions.<br />
Labor would repeal our laws dealing with demarcation disputes. ; ow<br />
could anyone object to laws as obviously fair and essential as these?<br />
Tih e reason is not. hard. to find. The left-wing unions are all affiliat<br />
with the Labor Party. They all pay money to the Labor Party. And<br />
they have a large voice in determining official ALP policy. Mr Whitlam<br />
is unable to resist them. That's why: he has completely abdicated<br />
responsibility for the damage which their disruption can cause.<br />
Unlike the Labor Party, we have taken the view that no one can be<br />
above the law, that individual unionists have a right to be heard,<br />
and to be protected from intimidation; that it is the responsibility<br />
of the Government to protect the interests of the whole community.<br />
Our firm and responsible policy has the support of responsible unionists<br />
In my policy speech a fortnight ago I outlined a comprehensive<br />
programme which realistically tacked the problems we face, and which<br />
included creative and dynamic policies to meet Australia's needs..'<br />
Our new initiatives were carefully costed. They are a responsible and<br />
workable strategy for restoring Australia to prosperity. Our clear,<br />
consistent economic policy has been shown to work. By getting inflati.<br />
down, the deficit-dOwn-, interest rates down, taxation down, we are<br />
giving the economy the stimulus it needs to grow. By getting investmet<br />
up, growth and development up, production and productivity up,. we are<br />
creating more jobs for more people not temporary, artificial jobs<br />
which peter out when some government-subsidy runs out, but real jobs,<br />
permanent jobs, jobs that Australians can keep.<br />
