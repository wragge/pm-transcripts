    <content><![CDATA[<p>My friends, it is my honour to welcome you back to Canberra as the Prime Minister-elect of Australia.</p>
<p>Governments change but rarely in this country.</p>
<p>Inevitably, all changes of government are historic and all of you can be proud of the part that you have played in this historic change.</p>
<p>Our task is but briefly to savour this moment. Our task is to give a great country and a great people the better government that the people of Australia deserve â€“ that is our task.</p>
<p>We will now move purposefully, calmly and methodically to deliver on our election commitments to build a stronger economy for a stronger Australia.</p>
<p>That is what we must now do. That is what I am confident we have the team to do.</p>
<p>This is probably as well-prepared an opposition as has ever gone in to government, but the task is now ahead of us.</p>
<p>The challenges are considerable: we must stop the boats, we must scrap the carbon tax, we must build the roads and we must get the budget back into the black.</p>
<p>We will do these things because that is what the Australian people have elected us to do. That is what the Australian people have a right to expect.</p>
<p>My friends, we have won the trust of the Australian people. Our challenge now is to earn it and to keep it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
