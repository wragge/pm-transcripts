HOST: Prime Minister, it seems you have a big job convincing voters that you can follow through on your promises there.PM: I have really enjoyed being in western Sydney today and of course I will be available here during the course of this week.</p>
<p>I have travelled to western Sydney before, I have always enjoyed it.</p>
<p>This is a series of communities, but joined together by a sense of aspiration and achievement.</p>
<p>And today, I have announced that we want to help the communities is in Greater Western Sydney by easing some of the pressure of the commute to work.</p>
<p>I am waiting for Premier O'Farrell to put a plan like that on the table and then we will certainly make a funding offer.</p>
<p>HOST: Despite the promises though Prime Minister, are you feeling anger in the western suburbs, because that is the feedback we're getting from people.</p>
<p>PM: What I am feeling is a sense that people here are going about their everyday business, they work very hard, they have got a real sense of community.</p>
<p>They want government to be working with them as they live their busy lives and the picture is one of achievement.</p>
<p>But they want the government working with them and I am pleased to be working with them.</p>
<p>HOST: So would you say western Sydney will be the big winner from this election with you and Tony Abbott making big promises for the region?</p>
<p>PM: I think the next election will come down to a choice between who has got a plan for the nation's future and to support working families, modern families, as they get about day-to-day living with real, modern pressures.</p>
<p>That decision will be made in September.</p>
<p>For now, I am very pleased to be here, having the opportunity to talk to people, explaining what the Government is doing but also hearing community feedback and what is on people's minds.</p>
<p>HOST: Alright Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time this evening.</p>
<p>PM: Thanks Chris.</p>
