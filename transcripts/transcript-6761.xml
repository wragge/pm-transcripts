TRANSCRIPT INTERVIEW WITH MAX WALSH FOR THE NATIONAL 11 OCT 1985<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, the news of the day is President Reagan's<br />
hijacking of the hijackers. what comment does the Prime Minister<br />
of Australia have to offer about this amazing episode?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not acquainted with the detail and all the<br />
background. I make the preliminary point that we condemn the<br />
international terrorism which occurred in the case of the<br />
hijacking of the ship and we regret all that flowed from it.<br />
Max, I would prefer to have a detailed briefing of what has been<br />
involved in the action of the United States before making any<br />
further comments.<br />
WALSH: I can understand that. Now, if I can just turn to local<br />
events and what has dominated Parliament in the last few days and<br />
few weeks. It may seem trivial compared with international<br />
events, but the Bicentennial.<br />
PM: Yes, Max.<br />
WALSH: It was suggested last evening by Senator Richardson, one<br />
of your senior colleagues, that in your Department heads should<br />
roll because of what had happened there, because of the<br />
incompetence displayed by your advisers within the Department.<br />
Will heads roll?<br />
PM: What has happened, Max, is that I, immediately after the<br />
evidence of this very considerable incompetence, told the<br />
Acting Head of the Department, Mr Visbord, that I wanted a<br />
re-arrangement within the Department to ensure that the-handling<br />
of this very important matter of the Bicentennial celebrations<br />
should be put in an order and a competence which not only I as<br />
Prime Minister, but the community could have competence. That<br />
has been put to me this morning. I have approved it. And so, we<br />
will now have a division headed up by an officer in whom I have<br />
very considerable confidence. And I make the point, Max, as I.<br />
did in the Parliament today, that one of the problems in this<br />
whole affair, in a sense is confirmed by the statement of Prime<br />
Minister Fraser on 2 October, is the nature of the relationship<br />
between the Government and an independent public company. Now,<br />
what I have tried to do in the circumstances, having seen the<br />
difficulties, is to create the apparatus within my Department<br />
which will meet the concerns which have become evident to everyone,<br />
and certainly including myself. I wonder Max, if you would<br />
excuse me if I did make this observation, that while of course<br />
there has been gross incompetence which the Department has readily / 2 </p>
<p>acknowledged on this matter, it would be less than fair if I<br />
did not make this point, that since I have been Prime Minister<br />
from March of ' 83, the Department of the Prime Minister has,<br />
generally speaking, provided me with excellent and dedicated<br />
service. I think it would be unfair if the impression were left<br />
that as a result of what, certainly in this instance was<br />
considerable incompetence, that that is a general reflection of<br />
the state of the Prime Minister's Department. It is not.<br />
WALSH: But you did use the expression " gross incompetence" and<br />
I wonder, does this restructuring also involve disciplining?<br />
PM: Well, I want to look further, and at a somewhat more<br />
leisurely pace, max, at whether any further implications need to<br />
be involved, but my concern in the immediate sense is to ensure<br />
that the appropriate apparatus is set in place within the<br />
Department to ensure that the Government, through my Department<br />
can properly co-operate with, have a degree of knowledge, and<br />
ensure accountability of the Australian Bicentennial Authority.<br />
Because I want all Australians to know that very much good work<br />
has been done. we are going to have a great year of celebrations<br />
and remembrance in 1988.<br />
WALSH: Now had this occurred, this particular episode occurred<br />
with a junior minister in your Ministry where he was paraded<br />
in the public arena for having OK'ed and approved a payment of<br />
half a million dollars for an inconvenient public servant in the<br />
circumstance which applied to you. I am sure the press would<br />
be howling for ministerial responsibility. Now in your case nobody<br />
imposed ministerial responsibility. Do you think that you would<br />
have applied a particularly harsh standard to a junior minister<br />
who had been exposed to these circumstances?<br />
PM: Well, let me make it quite clear that the basis of your Cieh'oA<br />
is incorrect Max, in the sense that you referred to my approval<br />
of this payment. What is quite clear is that I did not approve<br />
and, in fact, wrote specifically on the advice of my Department<br />
and of the Attorney-General's Department advice given to me'<br />
following the receipt of a letter from Mr Reid on the 28th of<br />
August. I wrote on the 30th of August making it quite clear that<br />
under the law I could not approve, though I must insist Max that<br />
not only could I not approve, I therefore did not approve.<br />
WALSH: Well, what are the aspects of this which has angered you<br />
the most and caused the most public concern was the tax<br />
minimisation arrangement entered into in this large payment. And<br />
the thing that struck me about this as flowing as it does at a<br />
time when you are engaged in eradicating these tax lurk and perks<br />
is this particular lurk which I notice is untouched in Mr Keating's<br />
package. Have you considered that it should be incorporated in it?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know whether it is a question of incorporating<br />
it but I just simply want to say this. That because the Australian<br />
Bicentennial Authority is taking as it must take its own independent<br />
legal advice on this matter. I don't think it's fair to<br />
Dr Armstrong in these circumstances that I should, in a sense,<br />
publicly canvass the issue now as to what may or may not happen.<br />
WALSH: No, I am not suggesting that. </p>
<p>PM: No, I haven't finished my answer. It limits the extent to<br />
which I want to go to the issue but I would think Max, that our<br />
mutually good friend Paul Keating and his Department may be looking<br />
at this issue in the light of what has happened.<br />
WALSH: Good. That brings me onto tax, of course, and the current<br />
public debate about Mr Keating's proposed package. Well interest<br />
groups are having their say and saying it quite vociferously<br />
in some cases I wonder has anything your attention at this stage<br />
where you say maybe they have got a good case, maybe we should<br />
look a second time at that?<br />
PM: Not to this point Max, I am talking about the broad areas.<br />
I mean I would think within each particular category as we<br />
go to legislation there might be some refinement of a particular<br />
point within the categories of action. But I suppose it is true<br />
Max, that the most vociferous reaction, certainly the one that<br />
seems to be the most covered in the media, is the impact upon<br />
the restaurant industry. Now I must say that speaking for Paul<br />
and myself that we are not persuaded there. It is quite clear,<br />
and neither Paul nor I have sought to avoid the point, that<br />
there may be some sections of the restaurant industry which could<br />
be adversely affected. And people are saying well this is going<br />
to have an adverse employment effect. But what you have got to<br />
do as you know is to look at this in overall terms and there is<br />
no way that the overall employment impact of the total tax package<br />
can be disadvantageous. And the simple fact is that you are looking<br />
at the restaurant, that the time had to come to an end when the<br />
great mass of your viewers, the great mass of ordinary Australians<br />
were subsidising the tax lunches or tax dinners of a privileged<br />
few. That had to come to an end. Now we are now in a week where<br />
the evidence is clear that as a result of our general policies<br />
we are very close to achieving that half a million increase in<br />
jobs since we have come to office. Well ahead of target. Now I<br />
and Paul Keating and this Government are not going to be bringing<br />
in policies which are going to have adverse employment impacts<br />
in the aggregate.<br />
WALSH: No, they mightn't have adverse employment impact in, th" e<br />
aggregate but I just wonder how do you read the political response<br />
to the package?<br />
PM: Well, that is a slightly different question and I am glad<br />
you asked it. I think by any objective analysis you would have to<br />
say that the response has been very favourable and I guess one<br />
way of testing this Max, is to look at the pathetic performance<br />
of the Opposition. I mean we went for a day on the first day back<br />
in Parliament when they didn't ask a question about it. Then they<br />
were obviously in very deep and troubled waters and going much<br />
further because Mr Howard has been repudiated by significant<br />
sections of his Party. The Messner mess, if I can put it that<br />
way, has involved<br />
WALSH: Well what do you refer to there?<br />
PM: Well, his statement of what may have to be done. I mean,<br />
the proposals which are talking about a services tax. His harsh<br />
and punitive move into capital gains far beyond what is in our<br />
package. These things clearly show both repudiation of the Howard<br />
position but it is now not a repudiation because Mr Howard, of<br />
course, is back tracking all over the place from his previously<br />
stated position. And we had the remarkable situation in the </p>
<p>Parliament today Max, where objection was taken to the question<br />
addressed to Mr Keating from our side of the House about the<br />
implications of his package. Mr Sinclair got up and said you can't<br />
really have a question about this. So they are putting a bar<br />
upon themselves asking questions in the House. And it is not<br />
surprising because I think really the situation is this. They<br />
understand that we have brought down a good package. They have<br />
got no real idea of how they can, with any reasonablenesscome<br />
up with an alternative.<br />
WALSH: Right, now if I could turn to what you will be doing in<br />
the next few days. You are going to the commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting and you are ' taking with you a proposal which<br />
involves an Australian initiat' 3Ve in somehow putting together an<br />
internation4 program to bring to the fore our opposition to<br />
South Africa's apartheid policies. What would you hope to come<br />
away from CHOGM with precisely?<br />
PM: Well, Max, I think you will appreciate, I don't want to go<br />
into all the details, but I am more than happy to give you the<br />
outline of our thinking. Essentially what we want to see happen<br />
is this, the South African Government itself coming to an<br />
understanding that the abhorrent apartheid apparatus and policy<br />
must be brought to an end. And that they must move to being<br />
a country of universal suffrage, a free and liberal society.<br />
Now the best way for that to happen Max, is that they should<br />
themselves come to that conclusion and start to make the decisions<br />
necessary to reach that goal. So while, yes we will be talking<br />
about the concept of some effective economic action that maybe<br />
able to be adopted within the international community. In a sense,<br />
more importantly to me is that part of my approach which will<br />
be looking to see if we can get a group of respected international<br />
personalities, respected as far as possible across the<br />
international spectrum, who would address themselves to the issue<br />
of the processe I recognise as I think all reasonable people<br />
do WALSH: Just the processes, you mean the processes<br />
PM: In South Africa of change. I mean it would be quite improper<br />
and quite stupid to suggest that just like that overnight that<br />
South Africa could change. It must address itself to the processes<br />
of change, have a clear stated objective of moving to universal<br />
suffrage and a free and liberal society and then what are the<br />
steps, what are the processes that should be initiated to * achieve<br />
that within a reasonable time. Now I want to see the avoidan'ce<br />
of bloodshed in South Africa. I want to see the various groups%<br />
including the white South African Government trying to co-operate<br />
to bring about this desired objective. And so my total approach<br />
will be concentrating, in a senses much more on that than on the<br />
concept of sanctions.<br />
7' r-</p>
<p>WALSH: It has been suggested that the United Kingdom<br />
Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, is less than enthusiastic about<br />
your proposal.<br />
PM: Well, on the evidence, the British Government does take<br />
a more accommodating view. That is true. The evidence suggests<br />
that. But I am not going to the CHOGM iieeting to have a fight<br />
with Margaret Thatcher. I found at my first meeting in 1983,<br />
that I was able to sanely and rationally discuss and debate<br />
issues with her. There were many issues at which we were at one.<br />
There were others where we had differences of opinion, but that<br />
didn't mean clashes and fights. I will put, on behalf of theA<br />
government and people of Aust ralia, the sort of approach which I<br />
have just suggested, and I hope that through the processes of<br />
rational-discussion and debate and argument, we may be able to<br />
get a common solution.<br />
WALSH: You talk about a common position. That is the way it has<br />
to end up, isn't it? You can't end up with a vote and win just<br />
purely on numbers at CHOGM.<br />
PM: Well, that is not the way it is operated, no.<br />
WALSH: And you wouldn't expect it to on this occasion?<br />
PM: No, I would hope that you would get a situation that it would<br />
be clear that the overwhelming majority of people had the sort of<br />
views that I think we are expressing in a way that do give the<br />
opportunity of support from the overwhelming majority. And that<br />
in those circumstances the British Government would see that we are<br />
not about trying to approach this with economic force and saying,<br />
here let's get a big economic stick with which we can beat the<br />
bejesus out of the South African Regime. I mean, it is going to<br />
be necessary, I believe, given the arowina reactionwithin the<br />
UNited States and Europe of the recognition of the need to think<br />
about economic sanctions, to address our minds to that. But once<br />
Mrs Thatcher and others understand that the much preferred position<br />
is to persuade the South African Government about appropriate<br />
processes, within which let me say this that I would be<br />
emphasising the need to ensure that in such an emergent new South<br />
Africa there should be a strong and real and protected place for the<br />
accumulated experience and capital of white South Africans. I mean,<br />
I think people understand that we are totally constructive in our<br />
approach, because I believe very deeply, Max, that the worst thing<br />
that could happen, as developments go on, for the people of South<br />
Africa, for the black South Africans, would be a situation where<br />
there was a total withdrawal of white capital, of white expertise<br />
and experience, because that would mean a serious decline in<br />
economic standards and capacities and potential for all the people<br />
of South Africa. So part of the sorts of things that have got<br />
to be talked about is how, as you get the political democracy and<br />
enfranchisement, you can at the same time ensure that you don't<br />
have a slide into economic chaos. </p>
<p>WALSH: * This CHOGM initiative, would it be self-contained<br />
within CHOGM or would it be a first step before taking it to<br />
the United Nations?<br />
PM: Well, we have thought about it in terms of a stage, that<br />
the Commonwealth, if it can get a common position, then to be<br />
able to go on within the United Nations framework. The Commonwealth<br />
is a remarkable organisation. It represents an enormous number of<br />
people. It represents a range of countries from the most developed<br />
to the least developed, from the largest to the tiniest Pacific<br />
islands. So it can take to the United Nations a degree of<br />
experience and authority which is unique.<br />
WALSH: Just ' before saying good n'ight, Prime Minister, if I could<br />
just come back to the local scene, to the very local scene,<br />
Nunawading, and the sort of dirty tricks exposed at Nunawading,<br />
especially on the part of your party. Does this leave a bad taste<br />
in your mouth?<br />
PM: I have said unequivocally, when I saw the statement of the<br />
State Secretary that I believe it was a very unwise decision that<br />
was taken by those who were involved. I don't think I can be more<br />
straightforward than that. I think it is a fair enough postscript<br />
to add that people should not be taken by the hypocri'sy of the<br />
Liberals in this. I just ask them to cast their mind back to<br />
December 1982 when Senator Don Chipp had cause to launch the most<br />
stringent attack upon the Liberal Party in Victoria for what ' le<br />
described his words " the filthy trick' of the Liberal Party<br />
in Victoria in attempting to delude the voters of Flinders in the<br />
by-election in December 1982 that the Democrats were supporting<br />
the Liberals. He camne out and attacked them for their filthy<br />
trick in putting out material seeking to mislead. Now that does<br />
not excuse or justify the unwise decision that I believe was taken<br />
within the Labor Party in Victoria in the Nunawading by-election,<br />
but I think it is fair enough to say the Liberals cannot be heard<br />
in this debate, this discussion. They don't come to it with clean<br />
hands. WALSH: Prime Minister, thanks very much. Good evening.<br />
PM: Thanks very much, Max. </p>
