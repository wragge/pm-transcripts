EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH BUILDING<br />
CSIRO DIVISION OF ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH<br />
ASPENDALE, VICTORIA 19 MARCH 1990<br />
I am delighted to be here at the CSIRO Division of<br />
Atmospheric Research to inspect your research work on the<br />
changes taking place in the regional and global atmosphere.<br />
Bob Chynoweth has told me directly of the fine work being<br />
done here. It is vitally important work, for there is no<br />
greater global environmental concern than the greenhouse<br />
effect and the depletion of the ozone layer.<br />
The changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere<br />
now occurring are likely to bring about significant<br />
modifications to climate as a result of the greenhouse<br />
effect. Similarly, the CFCs released into the atmosphere by human<br />
activity are depleting the ozone layer.<br />
Your research into both of these phenomena, and your related<br />
work on atmospheric pollution and the impact of climate<br />
change on water resources, deserve the support and<br />
encouragement of all Australians.<br />
You will be aware that my Government is funding a greenhouse<br />
research program, with most of the money going to CSIRO and<br />
the Bureau of Meteorology. Indeed, I am advised that of the<br />
140 staff here at Aspendale, 20 were hired in the last year<br />
through the Commonwealth's greenhouse research program.<br />
So I am pleased today to be able to inform you that we will<br />
Sbeproviding at least $ 5.7 million a year over the next<br />
three years for greenhouse research.<br />
This will enable CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology to<br />
continue their research, and will facilitate the<br />
establishment of a dedicated research grants scheme<br />
administered by the National Greenhouse Advisory Committeeas<br />
foreshadowed in my Environment Statement last year.<br />
So your jobs, and your work, are secure under us, as they<br />
ought to be. </p>
<p>I have established a Special Working Group on Reducing<br />
Greenhouse Gas Emissions within Australia. At the end of<br />
last year the preliminary report of the working group was<br />
released for public comment.<br />
Early measures can be taken, through such simple changes as<br />
using new energy efficient light bulbs and improving<br />
ventilation and air conditioning systems and through the<br />
accelerated phasing out of CFCs my Government is overseeing.<br />
We will commit ourselves to achievable target reductions in<br />
greenhouse gas emissions, based on scientific assessment and<br />
set in consultation with government, industry and<br />
environmental groups.<br />
We will do this following receipt of the report of the<br />
International Panel on Climate Change later this year. And<br />
we will be working for the inclusion of targets in an<br />
international convention on climate change to bind all the<br />
nations of the world to a program of reducing greenhouse gas<br />
emissions. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
When I issued my Environment Statement ' Our Country, Our<br />
Future' last July, I said that its announcements, while<br />
comprehensive and vitally important, would not of themselves<br />
see the job done. And earlier this year I undertook to<br />
provide a progress report on the Environment Statement<br />
which I am releasing today.<br />
My Government has, in the eight months since the release of<br />
' Our Country, Our Future', built on the commitments in that<br />
Statement by making a number of important new decisions and<br />
taking further steps to protect the environment. These<br />
include: The transfer of 98 per cent of the Conservation Zone<br />
into Kakadu National Park and the referral of<br />
Coronation Hill and other potential mineral<br />
developments in the remaining 2 per cent area to the<br />
Resource Assessment Commission;<br />
A decision not to move the Sydney naval fleet to Jervis<br />
Bay; Intensification of our campaign to prevent mining ever<br />
taking place in Antarctica, successfully eliciting the<br />
support of more and more countries to our cause, the<br />
most recent being New Zealand<br />
and establishment of an Antarctic Foundation in<br />
Tasmania; </p>
<p>Banning the barbaric practice of driftnet fishing in<br />
Australian waters and taking a leading and successful<br />
role in gathering international support for a ban in<br />
the South Pacific region to be followed by a global<br />
ban; Providing financial support for the Salamanca Agreement<br />
on the Tasmanian forests, and for the agreements<br />
recently negotiated for the South East forests of NSW<br />
and the East Gippsland forests of Victoria;<br />
The preparation of the most stringent guidelines in the<br />
world for new kraft eucalypt pulp mills and the<br />
provision of funding, jointly with industry, for<br />
further research on lowering the chlorine content in<br />
bleaching processes;<br />
An agreement with the Goss Labor Government to conduct<br />
a comprehensive joint land use study of Cape York;<br />
Conclusion of a management agreement with the Goss<br />
Government for the Queensland Wet Tropics World<br />
Heritage area and provision of $ 10 million over three<br />
years for management of the area;<br />
A ban on the importation of non-antique ivory into<br />
Australia, and the successful pursuit of prohibition at<br />
the meeting of the Convention on the Importation of<br />
Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES) in Lausanne last<br />
October; The banning of the use of CFCs in ordinary aerosol cans<br />
and a rate of phasing out of other CFCs which makes<br />
Australia's program the toughest in the world;<br />
A decision for Australia to host the next annual<br />
meeting of the International Union for the Conservation<br />
of Nature ( the IUCN), in Perth in November; and<br />
Announcement of the World Heritage nomination of Shark<br />
Bay in Western Australia.<br />
By any standard this is an outstanding list of environmental<br />
achievements for such a short period, and it is not an<br />
exhaustive one. As the Progress Report on the Environment<br />
Statement shows, very substantial advances have been made<br />
-drready in implementing the numerous commitments I made in<br />
the Environment Statement last July.<br />
In building on that progress in implementing ' Our Country,<br />
Our Future', I am able to advise you today, and through you,<br />
all Australians, of a series of measures which continue our<br />
commitment to the protection of the environment. </p>
<p>World Heriage Listings<br />
Australia now has eight sites on the World Heritage List,<br />
and Shark Bay would be the ninth. Australia is already<br />
acknowledged by the IUCN as having done more than any other<br />
country to advance World Heritage values.<br />
Today I can announce that the sub-Antarctic Heard and<br />
Macdonald Islands will be nominated this year for World<br />
Heritage Listing.<br />
This reaffirms my Government's determination to preserve<br />
that entire fragile region of the world.<br />
Protection of World Heritage Arean<br />
The cane toad is beginning to pose a threat to Kakadu<br />
National Park. Recent research into eradication of the cane<br />
toad, funded by Commonwealth, State and Territory<br />
Governments, has now been evaluated.<br />
Further research on impacts of the cane toad, and short and<br />
long term measures for controlling it, is now required.<br />
The Government will provide an additional $ 1.25 million,<br />
over three years, to CSIRO, for this purpose. We are<br />
seeking a commensurate funding commitment from relevant<br />
States and the Northern Territory.<br />
Mimosa pigra is a fast-growing prickly shrub from Central<br />
and South America which is invading Northern Australian<br />
wetlands at an alarming rate. It, too, is a threat to<br />
Kakadu National Park and Aboriginal lands.<br />
To combat the spread of mimosa through effective biological<br />
control agents, an extra $ 1.25 million will be provided to<br />
CSIRO over the next three years. Funding at this level will<br />
ensure the effective continuity of work already underway.<br />
Preservation of Wilderness<br />
The National Wilderness Inventory, initiated by my<br />
Government in 1986 and accelerated through additional<br />
funding announced in the Environment Statement, will provide<br />
-aW important management tool for assessing the impact of<br />
development proposals on wilderness areas.<br />
To ensure that the Wilderness Inventory is completed within<br />
three years, a further $ 400,000 will be provided over the<br />
period to mid-1993. </p>
<p>Au~ qtralia_' g For~ ntn and Forest industries<br />
There can be little doubt that Australians are becoming<br />
increasingly aware of the need to preserve substantial areas<br />
of our native forests and that they prize highly those areas<br />
which have remained relatively unmodified by human activity.<br />
My Government is committed to this end, but we are also<br />
determined to develop a thriving, secure timber industry,<br />
based on adding maximum value to the product.<br />
We are developing a national forest strategy. A key element<br />
in our strategy will be expansion of the available resource<br />
through the rapid increase in the establishment of eucalypt<br />
plantations to supply expanding amounts of pulpwood. We<br />
will examine all measures to facilitate the establishment of<br />
this resource.<br />
We will require woodchip exporters to commit themselves to<br />
the establishment of plantations. And, in keeping with the<br />
Government's policy of wanting to add value to all our<br />
produce, we will ask all of the major woodchip export<br />
companies in Australia to present to us their plans for<br />
adding value to this product before the end of the decade.<br />
On the issue of paper we are aware that a market acceptance<br />
of somewhat duller papers could dispense with the need for<br />
chlorine bleaches in pulp mills. As our contribution to<br />
opening up this option, we will review the sales tax on<br />
non-chlorine bleached products.<br />
While this, of itself, would not affect overseas demand for<br />
high brightness paper from kraft export pulp mills, we are<br />
prepared to play our part domestically in raising community<br />
awareness of the benefits of non-chlorine bleached paper.<br />
The ACF and the National Farmers' Federation have been<br />
working closely with my Government in the formulation and<br />
implementation of measures, costing $ 320 million, to combat<br />
soil degradation in the Year and the Decade of Landcare.<br />
In the Environment Statement I announced, alongside those<br />
measures, a review of the taxation arrangements relating to<br />
the prevention and treatment of land degradation, including<br />
-r~ tegetation and fencing. That review will be finalised in<br />
time for the 1990-91 Budget.<br />
The Landcare Australia Foundation has the responsibility of<br />
raising sponsorship for landcare education and community<br />
activities. We have decided to provide tax deductibility for donations<br />
to the Landcare Australia Foundation, from 1 April 1990. </p>
<p>The establishment of landcare groups has been proceeding at<br />
a most encouraging rate; indeed there has been a flood of<br />
applications. We will supplement existing funding with an extra<br />
$ 1.3 million over three years to accelerate the<br />
establishment of landcare groups.<br />
Hingnitp Rehabilitation and Of fshnye Platform Remnval<br />
' rhe Government is concerned that appropriate steps be taken<br />
by the mining industry to ensure that environmental<br />
rejuvenation takes place through minesite rehabilitation.<br />
Industry shares this concern.<br />
We will review the taxation arrangements as they apply to<br />
minesite rehabilitation and the removal of offshore<br />
petroleum platforms and announce the outcome in the 1990-91<br />
Budget.<br />
N~ atay and Air Pollutin<br />
My Government is the first Australian Government to propose<br />
the adoption of national water quality standards. The<br />
fouling of Australia's rivers, lakes and beaches has become<br />
a national problem, although constitutionally the<br />
responsibility for water quality lies with the States.<br />
Sydney's beach pollution must be dealt with first and<br />
foremost by the NSW Government. But it is now a national<br />
scandal and my Government can help in ways which, though<br />
modest, may help provide the long-term solution.<br />
Sydney's beach pollution is unlikely to be solved by working<br />
out different ways of pouring more and more sewage into the<br />
ocean. The long-term answer must lie in alternative technologies,<br />
such as the Memtec filtration system and microwave<br />
sterilisation. Dryland sewage disposal methods would avoid<br />
the need to pump sewage into the ocean. Since July of last<br />
year my Government has provided over $ 1 million in support<br />
of these alternative technologies.<br />
W announced recently that up to $ 4 million a year from the<br />
existing Grants for Industry Research and Development Scheme<br />
will be made available for the development of new<br />
technologies in waste and environmental management. Within<br />
that allocation, priority will be given to trialling and<br />
development of new technologies for sewage and effluent<br />
treatment. This will be of relevance not only to Sydney's<br />
beach pollution problem but to the problems of rivers and<br />
waterways in other States. </p>
<p>Unlike the Coalition, which has recoiled from assuming a<br />
strong role for the Commonwealth in acting in the national<br />
interest to protect the environment, we will strive for<br />
national standards of air and water quality and national<br />
strategies to implement them.<br />
We accept the value of an Environment Protection Agency to<br />
co-ordinate this work and will move to establish such a body<br />
in our next term of Government.<br />
Tnfor-mation RAses.-<br />
We cannot move to a truly sustainable society in which the<br />
proper balance between environment and economic development<br />
is struck, and maintained, until we have sound and<br />
comprehensive biological information.<br />
The Government therefore has decided to provide $ 2.4 million<br />
over three years to accelerate the Australian Biological<br />
Resources Study.<br />
This will complement the National Wilderness Inventory and<br />
other work on environmental data bases currently underway.<br />
Biological Diversi-ty<br />
My Government is committed to the survival of a full suite<br />
of flora and fauna species. I pledged in the Environment<br />
Statement that Australia would play a leading role in the<br />
development of an international convention for the<br />
protection of biological diversity. We are calling on the<br />
world to come together to begin formulating such a<br />
Biodiversity Convention.<br />
Australia will offer to host a negotiating session for a<br />
Biodiversity Convention, leading up to the UN Conference on<br />
Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992 which, it is<br />
anticipated, will adopt the Convention.<br />
The Convention will be aimed at arresting the frightening<br />
rate of species loss and developing a strategy to ensure<br />
their future survival.<br />
In playing our part at home, we have established a ten year<br />
-eiidangered species program and we will consider the<br />
enactment of Commonwealth endangered species legislation.<br />
A further element of our strategy to maintain biological<br />
diversity in Australia is a program to ' save the bush' which<br />
I announced in the Environment Statement, and which has<br />
ongoing funding of $ 1.5 million a year.<br />
We will expand the Save the Bush program by providing an<br />
extra $ 2 million over the next three years. </p>
<p>Raccñ ng<br />
If we are to use our natural resources more efficiently,<br />
save energy and reduce pollution, then we must minimise<br />
waste and increase the rate of recycling.<br />
My Government has already adopted a number of measures for<br />
encouraging paper recycling, including trialling recycled<br />
paper in selected Government Departments and removing the<br />
sales tax on a range of recycled paper products.<br />
Today I can announce further measures to help lift our<br />
national performance in the areas of environmentally sound<br />
packaging and recycling.<br />
With the co-operation of the States, Territories and<br />
industry, we will introduce a scheme of " green labelling" of<br />
products on the basis of their environmental friendliness.<br />
In the first instance the scheme will concentrate on<br />
packaging. Under a system of green labels, manufacturers<br />
will have a greater incentive to package products in an<br />
environmentally sound manner.<br />
Once we have tackled this problem we will extend the green<br />
labelling scheme beyond packaging itself and to the products<br />
themselves. In addition, we will develop a national waste minimisation<br />
and recycling strategy once again through a co-operative<br />
approach with the States and industry. We will be seeking<br />
the establishment of minimum goals for rates of recycling.<br />
And through the Australian and New Zealand Environment<br />
Council we will be seeking the co-operation of the States<br />
and Territories to audit the nation's major sources of<br />
waste. A similar survey will be proposed for the nation's<br />
waste and recycling facilities.<br />
We will also review the indirect taxation arrangements as<br />
they apply to equipment used in recycling processes.<br />
Rudall River<br />
Western Australia's new Premier, Carmen Lawrence, has<br />
-riibently announced that there will be no uranium mining in<br />
Western Australia under her Government. My Government<br />
supports that position and as a result the Rudall River<br />
uranium mining proposal will not go ahead.<br />
North Head of Sydney Harbour<br />
Following the relocation of the School of Artillery to<br />
Townsville, the Commonwealth will be able to release<br />
hectares of Army land at North Head for inclusion in the<br />
Sydney Harbour Foreshores National Park. </p>
<p>The facilities which remain, including heritage buildings,<br />
will be used for the headquarters of the Army's Training<br />
Command. This move will, in turn, result in a further<br />
significant area at Georges Heights also being released for<br />
inclusion in the national park.<br />
Fyaner IA1and<br />
We will be assisting the Goss Government to conduct a study<br />
of the heritage values of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy<br />
Region. My Minister for the Environment will be providing a<br />
comprehensive submission to that inquiry on the natural<br />
values the area contains.<br />
When that study is completed, we will determine which areas<br />
mnay be worthy of World Heritage nomination.<br />
My friends,<br />
While each and every one of these new measures will have a<br />
favourable impact on our natural environment, they also fit<br />
into an overall framework of sensible decision-making which<br />
moves us along the path of ecologically sustainable<br />
development. Late last year I initiated a set of processes, involving<br />
government, industry, union and conservation groups, to give<br />
practical effect to the concept of ecologically sustainable<br />
development in the agricultural, forestry, fisheries,<br />
mining, energy, manufacturing and tourism industries.<br />
A conceptual paper on ecological sustainability is being<br />
prepared. Working groups for each industry category will be<br />
formed to recommend to Government the ways of applying that<br />
concept to decision-making for each industry.<br />
For my Government, environmental considerations are not at<br />
the periphery, being brought into the Cabinet room only when<br />
a decision is to be made about a national park or a<br />
rainforest. We are integrating environmental considerations<br />
with our economic decisions, to ensure ecological<br />
sustainability. The Environment Minister is a member of the<br />
Government's powerful Structural Adjustment Committee and<br />
environmental impacts are formally addressed in Cabinet<br />
4Si~ bmissions.<br />
And on the key question of constitutional powers, my<br />
Government has demonstrated its preference for negotiation<br />
with State Governments but also its preparedness to<br />
override particular States where the processes of<br />
consultation and co-operation do not yield a result which we<br />
Judge to be in the national interest.<br />
I reaffirm all of the undertakings I have given in relation<br />
to the use of the Commonwealth's constitutional powers. </p>
<p>So in conclusion, I thank you for inviting me here to see<br />
first hand the most valuable work being done by CSIRO on<br />
climate change. The CSIRO enjoys a fine reputation for<br />
outstanding research and development work. Your research<br />
program here is a credit to all of you.<br />
And I can assure you that you will continue to receive the<br />
support from my Government that you deserve just as we are<br />
committed as custodians of the environment to pass on to<br />
our children, and theirs, an environment protected, an<br />
environment enriched, a better country, a brighter future. </p>
