<p>PRIME MINISTER MISSING -Â <strong>Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John McEwen </strong></p>
<p>The Australian people are aware that the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Harold Holt is missing off Portsea Beach. My information is that he was swimming this morning with a companion, Mr. Stewart, Director of the Fort Quarantine Station. Shortly after noon the two were separated in strong currents. At about 12.40 Mr Stewart reached the shore and raised the alarm.</p>
<p>A full-scale search and rescue operation was immediately mounted. The operation is continuing. It includes RAAF and civil aircraft and helicopters, police and naval units.</p>
<p>We will all pray that despite the grim situation, the Prime Minister may still be found safe.</p>
<p>This evening we all share with Mrs Holt and the family their terrible anxieties.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />17th December, 1967</p>
