PRIME MINISTER 10/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE SIXTH FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST<br />
The French Government is to be strongly condemned for this latest test at<br />
Fangataufa and for conducting it during negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban<br />
Treaty, which are entering the final critical stages in Geneva.<br />
Such an Irresponsible action sends the worst possible signal to nations that aspire to<br />
possess nuclear weapons, and damages efforts to advance nuclear disarmament<br />
and non-proliferation.<br />
Australia will continue to press France to end its testing program immediately and<br />
respond to the legitimate demands of South Pacific nations as expressed in the<br />
declaration of the meeting of South Pacific Environment Ministers, which Australia<br />
Initiated and hosted, on 17 August 1995.<br />
This declaration called for an immediate end to testing of nuclear weapons in the<br />
South Pacific and the closing of associated facilities, except thope required for future<br />
environmental monitoring; for France to accept full and exclusive responsibility for<br />
any adverse impacts from French testing on the South Pacific environment and<br />
people; and to provide access by the international community to all French scientific<br />
data and to the testing sites themselves to enable an independent and<br />
comprehensive assessment of the effects of testing. If, as the French Government<br />
claims, It seeks to retain a role in the South Pacific then it must respond positively to<br />
the demands of the nations which it would call neighbours and friends.<br />
I call on the French Government to announce immediately the cessation of its testing<br />
program, In line with statements by President Chirac; to sign without delay the<br />
protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty:, and to put all of its energy<br />
towards the successful conclusion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year.<br />
