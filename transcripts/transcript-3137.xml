PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 178<br />
23 January' 1974<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE<br />
FOR NEW4 SOUTH WALES FLOODS<br />
The Prime minister today released details of further<br />
Australian Government proposals for assistance to New South Wales<br />
for the purpose of assisting victims of the widespread floods<br />
in that State. Mr. Whitlam announced on 11 January that he had informed<br />
the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland that the Australian<br />
Government was prepared to join in the normal way with their<br />
Governments in providing financial assistance * on a dollar for<br />
dollar basis for financing the relief of personal hardship and<br />
distress in the affected areas. He had also referred to the<br />
co-operation of the Australian defence services with the State<br />
Civil Defence and Emergency Services in providing assistance in<br />
flooded areas, and said that this co-operation would continue.<br />
He had informed the two Premiers that his Government was prepared<br />
to consider quickly and sympathetically State proposals for other<br />
assistance. Mr. Whitlam said that, following discussions between<br />
officials of the Australian and New South Wales Governments, the<br />
Australian Government had agreed to assist the State with a<br />
comprehensive range of measures to provide relief and to assist in<br />
the restoration of essential public services and facilities.<br />
He had written ' o the Premier of New South Wales to inform him of<br />
this. The assistance which the State Government had agreed to<br />
provide would include:-<br />
Special assistance through the Rural Bank of New South<br />
Wales to primary producers affected by the floods, covering<br />
advances at concessional rates of interest and favourable<br />
repayment terms to meet carry-on requirements such as the<br />
purchase of household stores and other essentials; for<br />
the replacement of stock and plant lost; and for the<br />
replacement of essential improvements destroyed, excluding<br />
dwellings. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Rail freight rebates on donated food, fodder, clothing,<br />
etc., for distribution to flood victims.<br />
rail freight concessions on the carriage of fodder<br />
purchased for starving stock and the transport of stock<br />
from flood-affected properties for agistment in respect<br />
of approved districts.<br />
Qtants to Councils to enable them to undertake emergency<br />
repair works of a temporary nature in order to restore<br />
essential services such as water supply and sewerage.<br />
Grants for the restoration of Council roads, bridges,<br />
etc., and for the restoration of Council electricity<br />
and water supply undertakings where the authorities are<br />
unable to finance these from their own resources. In<br />
these cases, Councils will be expected to make a<br />
contribution to the cost of the necessary works commensurate<br />
with their own resources.<br />
Grants for costs of repairing flood-damaged railway<br />
lines and facilities, and for repairs to roads and bridges<br />
under the control of the Department of main Roads.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the New South Wales Government would<br />
be expected to meet expenditure on the foregoing measures up to a<br />
specified maximum annual amount of $ 5 million. Any expenditure<br />
beyond that amount would be accepted in full by the Australian<br />
Government, thus ensuring that the contribution by New South Wales<br />
was limited and known in advance.<br />
Mr. Whitlam. pointed out that the funds provided by the<br />
Australian Government would take the form of grants where the New Souti<br />
Wales Government provided grants, and interest-free loans where the<br />
funds were provided by the State by way of loans. The Australian<br />
Government had given a similar assurance in broad terms to the<br />
Queensland Government whose specified maximum commitment is $ 2<br />
million but had not yet received any information on measures<br />
contemplated by that Government, apart from the immediate relief<br />
of personal hardship and distress.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Commissioner of Taxation<br />
had advised that in cases where, because of adverse financial<br />
circumstances caused by the floods, a taxpayer is experiencing<br />
difficulty in paying his tax, sympathetic consideration would be<br />
given to extending the time for payment. Any taxpayer so affected<br />
should make an individual application to the Deputy Commissioner<br />
in his or her State for additional time to pay.<br />
The Commissioner had also confirmed that income tax<br />
deductions are allowable for gifts of $ 2 or more if made to any<br />
public fund established and maintained for the relief of persons<br />
in Australia who are in necessitous circumstances as a result of<br />
the floods.<br />
