I am delighted that Mark Waugh will captain the Prime Minister';s XI for the match against England on Tuesday 10 December at Manuka Oval in Canberra.<br />
Throughout the history of the Prime Minister';s XI matches, visits by the English cricket team have always been a much anticipated event for the national capital.<br />
The 2002 match is no exception and I look forward to welcoming Nasser Hussain and his team to Canberra next week.<br />
England will be meeting a Prime Minister';s XI team that consists of some of the most talented young players in Australia.  The Prime Minister';s XI announced by the Australian Cricket Board today is as follows: </p>
<p>Mark Waugh (captain)</p>
<p>NSW</p>
<p>  Matthew Bradley</p>
<p>NSW</p>
<p>  Lee Carseldine</p>
<p>QLD</p>
<p>  David Dawson</p>
<p>ACT</p>
<p>  Brad Haddin</p>
<p>NSW</p>
<p>  Shane Harwood</p>
<p>VIC</p>
<p>  Mark Higgs</p>
<p>SA</p>
<p>  Simon Katich</p>
<p>NSW</p>
<p>  Ashley Noffke</p>
<p>QLD</p>
<p>  Paul Rofe</p>
<p>SA</p>
<p>Cameron White</p>
<p>VIC<br />
The match will be umpired by Bruce Oxenford from Queensland and Graham Clifton from the ACT.<br />
The Prime Minister';s XI fixture would not be possible without the longstanding commitment of the Australian Cricket Board, for which I am very grateful.<br />
Also, I wish to thank the ACT Cricket Association for the tremendous job they do every year in hosting this game.<br />
The great cricketing tradition associated with an English touring team in Australia ensures that it will be a terrific day for everyone who attends.</p>
