FOR PRESS PM. NO. 7L97l<br />
CHINESE REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED NATIONS<br />
Statemen t by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
I welcome the statement by Mr. Roers, the US Secretary<br />
of State, that the United States will support action1 or seating the PLRC<br />
in the United Nations and will oppose any action to expel the ROC or<br />
otherwise deprive it of representation. Likewise, I vwelcome the United<br />
States acceptance that the question of China's seat in the Security Council<br />
is one to be resolved by the members of the United Nations.<br />
The announcement by Mr Rogers clearly reflects the<br />
close accord of the United States and Australian Governments on the China<br />
representation issue. Our position, as formulated over several months,<br />
has been that we would not oppose the representation of the PRC in the United<br />
Nations. Indeed, I have said that it was both inevitable and right that<br />
China should be a member of the UN General Assembly and should hold the<br />
permanent seat in the Security Council. At the same time, I have continued<br />
to emphasise that the Republic of China Taiwan should be given the<br />
chance to maintain its membership of the United Nations if it so wished.<br />
Only the United Nations can decide the question of Chinese representation.<br />
As one member of the United Nations, we will play our part in efforts to<br />
reach a decision that will be honourable and just.<br />
The Australian Government has been in consultation with<br />
the United States and other friendly governments for several months on<br />
the question of Chinese representation in the United Nations. We were<br />
consulted in advance on the substance of the Secretary of State's<br />
announcement. Of course, in a developing situation, many points of<br />
detail on the implementation of policy still need to be determined. We<br />
will remain in close consultation with the United States and other<br />
friendly governments in coming months about these details.<br />
I hope that the forthcoming session of the General Assembly,<br />
and the scheduled visit of President Nixon to Peking, will help to usher in<br />
a new era of better relations between the People's Republic of China and<br />
the countries of the Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
