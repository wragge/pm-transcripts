PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RON EDWARDS, RADIO 6PR<br />
24 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
EDWARDS: One of the good things in life is talking to a<br />
friend of mine and that's the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, Bob Hawke. Bob, welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you very much my dear friend.<br />
EDWARDS: Good to hear you over here in Perth. We had a<br />
busy week in Canberra.<br />
PM: Yes, it's been a busy week in Canberra and<br />
unfortunately a busy week in the world in some respects.<br />
EDWARDS: Yes, that was one of the questions I wanted to<br />
ask you. There must be a great sense of burden on your<br />
shoulders with this Iraq situation. Do you really feel<br />
that burden very much?<br />
PM: Yes, to be honest I do, because we've got a<br />
situation now where so many Australians are there as<br />
hostages, is the only word you can use. I agree with my<br />
friend George Bush who's used the word. It's what they<br />
are. That is an extraordinarily worrying thing. It's<br />
taken up many many many hours of time because I seek to<br />
be updated continuously almost of developments in the<br />
area. So in addition to it being a normally busy time of<br />
the year Ron with the Budget, we've had very many more<br />
hours involved in that. So a bit tiring but we're<br />
smiling.<br />
EDWARDS: Good. Bob could I ask you this question? It<br />
must have been very emotionally demanding seeing the<br />
fami-lies when.. the. warships departed. Did it affect you<br />
very much?<br />
PM: Yes it was very touching, and particularly with the<br />
kids because they were very emotionally upset at seeing<br />
their dads or their brothers going off into what they<br />
knew could be a dangerous situation. But the spirit of<br />
the families was absolutely magnificent. I was very very<br />
proud of them. </p>
<p>2<br />
EDWARDS: Yes, they're scenes that we seem to have had<br />
through our history of Australians going overseas to<br />
fight some war. It brings back a lot of memories for a<br />
lot of people I guess.<br />
PM: It brings back Perth memories for me because during<br />
the Second World War of course I was a student in Perth.<br />
1940 to ' 41 at West Leederville State School and then<br />
from ' 42 to ' 46 at Perth Modern School. The scenes of<br />
the troops going and coming and of course Fremantle was a<br />
staging port as you know. Perth used to be full of not<br />
only Australian soldiers and sailors but Americans. And<br />
of course the classic battles of the war were fought in<br />
many respects in Perth and Fremantle between the United<br />
States and New Zealand.<br />
EDWARDS: Yes, yes. We had our own invasion didn't we.<br />
PM: Yes, and some of the meetings between the United<br />
States' forces and the New Zealand forces were memorable.<br />
EDWARDS: of people in Perth who'd be saying well<br />
look, I've got someone in Kuwait or Iraq, what do I do,<br />
how do I find out what's going on? What's the best<br />
advice we should give them at this stage?<br />
PM: Through our Department of Foreign Affairs. Let me<br />
say this. Our diplomatic representatives in Baghdad,<br />
that's in Iraq, have been constantly at work. We have no<br />
diplomatic representation although our consular<br />
representative went down there during this week, in a<br />
somewhat dangerous situation I might say, and contacted<br />
the overwhelming majority of Australians in Kuwait. So<br />
if there's any question, contact our Department of<br />
Foreign Affairs and they will tell you what they can.<br />
But I've got to be quite direct Ron and say there is not<br />
a great deal of information available but they will know<br />
who they have been able to contact, for instance in<br />
Kuwait. So that's the way to do it.<br />
EDWARDS: Right. Well thank you for telling us that.<br />
Because the uncertainty is what gets to people as much as<br />
the danger itself.<br />
PM: Yes, I took the opportunity yesterday of ringing the<br />
relations of the two Australians that we know have been<br />
specifically hostaged in having been removed to exactly<br />
where . we don.' t. know. But I_.. spoke to them and I must say<br />
the spirit of those people here, knowing the great<br />
potential danger of their relatives, was quite<br />
remarkable. EDWARDS: It makes us all hope that there can be a<br />
peaceful outcome to this rather than any conflict,<br />
doesn't it.<br />
PM: Yes indeed. The hope that you must have is that<br />
there remains some degree of rationality in Suddam </p>
<p>Hussein because for any reasoning person the conclusion<br />
in unavoidable that there is only disaster ahead for the<br />
people of Iraq if he keeps on this course. Because there<br />
will either be armed conflict emerge which they cannot<br />
win and must not win or there is just simply the<br />
continued impact of the sanctions which have been agreed<br />
by the rest of the world which will mean their economy<br />
will be run down to the point of destruction and their<br />
capacity to live will be diminished. So the world is not<br />
trying to punish the Iraqi people. Australia hasn't got<br />
any argument with the people of Iraq. It's only with the<br />
leadership that has embarked upon this sort of insanity.<br />
So as I say, if there's any rationality there it should<br />
lead to the conclusion that all that can happen is the<br />
withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the<br />
release of the foreign nationals.<br />
EDWARDS: It's an interesting point you make about not<br />
having a war with the people of Iraq. Someone said to me<br />
at the airport this morning if they take two Australians<br />
hostage we should take two Iraqi people in Australia<br />
hostage. And I said well the fight is really on with<br />
Hussein rather than with the Iraqi people. The other<br />
thing is I think even if someone in some part of the<br />
world were to take some Iraqis hostage and threaten to<br />
kill them I don't think Hussein would really care. It<br />
seems to me that he's beyond that sort of<br />
PM: Well there's the two points to make and you've got<br />
them. The first is that we and countries like ourselves<br />
are prepared to go to the lengths that we have because we<br />
believe in certain principles. We believe in the<br />
principle that there should be the inviability of the<br />
borders of one nation from another, that armed aggression<br />
cannot be tolerated. We believe in the sanctity of<br />
individuals and their right to their freedom when<br />
travelling in other countries. We don't fight for those<br />
principles by denying them ourselves. The second point,<br />
even if you didn't have that moral view which is what<br />
we're fighting for, the second thing is as a matter of<br />
practice, you're absolutely right that the tragedy is<br />
that the sanctity of human life is not high on the agenda<br />
of the leadership of Iraq. Indeed in recent years we've<br />
seen a preparedness by that leadership to turn poison gas<br />
on his own people.<br />
EDWARDS: It's appalling isn't it.<br />
PM: It is indeed.<br />
EDWARDS: Can I ask you, seven and a half years in the<br />
job with constant pressure, great demands. Are you<br />
getting tired in the job?<br />
PM: No I'm not. There are times when I get tired. I<br />
mean for instance one night this week I only had a couple<br />
of hours sleep because I was up on these matters that<br />
we've been talking about. So obviously through yesterday </p>
<p>Iwas very very very tired. There was not much sleep<br />
last night. Now I'm not complaining about that because<br />
that's part of what makes the job the great job it is.<br />
So there's a difference between at times in a particular<br />
day feeling very very tired, but, and overall, what<br />
your condition is. I can say overall I've never felt<br />
better than I do now.<br />
EDWARDS: I was talking to Ian Brayshaw one day. He said<br />
he once bowled you in one of these media versus the<br />
politicians' cricket matches. He said that you're one of<br />
the most competitive blokes he's ever bowled to.<br />
PM: I've always been like that. I mean, whether it's in<br />
sport or studies or whatever, I've always tried to do my<br />
best, I've tried to win. I think it's a double insult if<br />
you don't. I think it's an insult to yourself not to try<br />
to win and I think it's an insult to those with whom<br />
you're involved, your competitors. I mean if you're not<br />
giving of your best it's an insult to them.<br />
EDWARDS: You must have done pretty well against Margaret<br />
Thatcher to get her to give back the Australian<br />
Constitution. PM: That was a hard fight.<br />
EDWARDS: I reckon it would be. It was a great day<br />
yesterday. PM: It was marvellous because as I said, that's the<br />
birth certificate of the Australian nation. For<br />
Australians who are proud of their country I guess<br />
nothing can be fundamentally more important than that.<br />
But I must give credit to Margaret in the sense that<br />
while, when I first raised it, it was a firm no, an<br />
explanation, that she did respond to persistent<br />
representation, not only from myself but from others who<br />
were working on our behalf, not least of whom was our<br />
good friend Alf Morris, the Labor MP in the House of<br />
Commons who is a great friend of Australia. And the<br />
combined forces of reason prevailed.<br />
EDWARDS: I'm running out of time Bob and I want to ask<br />
you just a couple of sporting questions. But can I say<br />
what would be the most emotionally demanding thing you ' ye<br />
had to deal with since you've been in office? What's<br />
the thing that's.. really drawn you-out and left you<br />
feeling, gee, you know, that was a tough one. Can you<br />
identify I mean obviously the Iraqi thing is<br />
PM: That's most recently, as I've said, the most serious<br />
decision. The single decision on which I've had to<br />
concentrate most thought and satisfy myself just through<br />
hours of thinking, putting all the arguments and weighing<br />
things up, is of course the commitment of Australian<br />
naval forces to the region. Because as one who all his<br />
life has tried to fight for reason and the processes of </p>
<p>conciliation and peaceful resolution of disputes, when<br />
you come to the point where you've got to make a decision<br />
about committing your country's armed forces, you just<br />
must agonise about that in the sense of just thinking and<br />
going through every argument and balancing. The paradox,<br />
as I've said, is while it was the most serious decision<br />
I've had to take as Prime Minister, in the end it was a<br />
simple decision because once you'd gone through the<br />
process of thinking through all the arguments, sifting<br />
all the facts and considerations, it was overwhelmingly<br />
clear what the right decision was.<br />
EDWARDS: Well Bob, 6PR's a racing and sport station<br />
PM: It's appropriate that I'm on it.<br />
EDWARDS: It is. Look, you've given me some great tips<br />
over the years. I remember one year you tipped the<br />
quinella in the Melbourne Cup in Caucus. Not everyone<br />
took it up. There were doubters in the ranks. Have you<br />
got anything that the punters could get their money on<br />
tomorrow? PM: I have to preface my answer by saying that my study<br />
of the form is always on Friday night. On Friday night<br />
or early Saturday morning I get the Sportsman out and I<br />
spend a couple of hours going through it in detailed<br />
form. So having said that and saying that I haven't been<br />
able to study it closely yet, I did, knowing that you<br />
were ringing up, I got the sporting section out of the<br />
Daily Telegraph and my eye lighted on the fact that in<br />
the fifth race in Sydney a horse called Peacock was<br />
running. It's an outsider, but it's scratched. I've<br />
just found out So I would've loved to have Hawke<br />
tipping Peacock. Now I can't do that but I noticed in<br />
the eighth race in Sydney, and this is in Budget week,<br />
there is a horse called Raise a Million. Now it ran a<br />
very very good race last time in. It's got Shane Dye<br />
riding it who is arguably the real in-form jockey in<br />
Australia of recent times and he's a very astute man. I<br />
know young Shane. He's a very very bright young boy and<br />
he's got a magnificent future. Barrier draw quite good,<br />
barrier three. So I would think that the listeners<br />
should get a good run out of Raise a Million.<br />
EDWARDS: Raise a Million, Race 8, in Sydney.<br />
PM: Race-B, horse. 3.<br />
EDWARDS: It will come home as well as Wayne Grady came<br />
home? PM: Mate I talked to him afterwards. I rang him up.<br />
Because I've played golf with him, pressed him very hard<br />
in a couple of holes too I might say, but with the use of<br />
a handicap. He's a lovely guy. I mean he's the sort of<br />
fellow that Australians would just say my God, isn't it </p>
<p>6<br />
beaut to have an Aussie ambassador like that He's a<br />
lovely man.<br />
EDWARDS: Totally unaffected isn't he.<br />
PM: Yes, he's a beauty. He really is.<br />
EDWARDS: What are you playing of f in golf at the moment?<br />
PM: 17.<br />
EDWARDS: 17. All the blokes out there on Sundays would<br />
want to know that.<br />
PM: I get a bit rusty This time of the year you<br />
don't get much time to play. But when I get a chance to<br />
get a few games in I can play pretty close to it.<br />
EDWARDS: Right. We better close with a very serious<br />
question. How do you think the West Coast Eagles are<br />
going to go in Melbourne in the finals?<br />
PM: Let me say first that I've been thrilled to see the<br />
way they've come through. I mean there's been a lot of<br />
cynicism amongst a lot of the Victorians about the<br />
outsiders, if I can say the West Coast Eagles, the<br />
Brisbane Bears and the Sydney Swans. I'm just thrilled<br />
that they're up there. I don't know now whether I now<br />
proceed to lose a great hunk of the West Australian vote.<br />
I don't think that they'll win the flag this year but I<br />
wish them well. But I really share the sense of joy that<br />
most West Australians must feel that they've done as well<br />
as they have.<br />
EDWARDS: And who do you think the flag's out of then<br />
Bob? What, Hawthorn, Essendon or Collingwood?<br />
PM: Anyone who saw Hawthorn last week could only have<br />
gone away in awe. That display against Collingwood, that<br />
was Hawthorn flag-type football. I know a close friend<br />
of mine who actually works with me and who is a<br />
Collingwood fanatic who simply said well Collingwood's<br />
got a chance provided someone knocks Hawthorn off on the<br />
way through to the final. I mean they've got to be very<br />
close. But then Essendon is also playing very well at<br />
times. They had a let-down after the Collingwood game.<br />
I guess the three that I think it lies between are<br />
Essendon,.-Hawthorn.. and Collingwood. Liking a bit of a<br />
price, relatively speaking, I would like to have got onto<br />
Hawthorn just a couple of weeks ago.<br />
EDWARDS: Yes, it would've been the time wouldn't it.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
EDWARDS: Bob, it's been great to talk to you. We're<br />
talking to a very special friend of yours later in fact.<br />
We're talking to Hazel. </p>
<p>7<br />
PM: Is that right. Give her my love will you.<br />
EDWARDS: I will indeed. I will indeed. She looked well<br />
when I saw her yesterday with you. So we'll have a talk<br />
to her later and it's terrific to talk to you. I'm sure<br />
all my listeners have been interested. They'll get their<br />
money on Race 8 in Sydney.<br />
PM: I hope that works. As I say, next time you have to<br />
talk to me on a Saturday morning. I might be then<br />
talking to you with more total confidence. But I think<br />
they'll get a good run for their money on that. Thanks<br />
mate. EDWARDS: Thanks a lot Bob.<br />
