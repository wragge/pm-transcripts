<p>E&amp;OE................</p>
<p>  Well thank you very much Shane for that very warm introduction. To you Jim,</p>
<p>   to Sue Napier, to Tony Rundle, Ray Green, Jocelyn Newman and my other Federal</p>
<p>   colleagues , my State Parliamentary colleagues and former colleagues, ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen. As always it is a great delight to be back in Tasmania. I've</p>
<p>   addressed in my capacities over the years as Federal Leader of the parliamentary</p>
<p>   Liberal Party, mark one phase and then mark two phase, I've addressed many</p>
<p>   State Council gatherings in Tasmania. I think I've addressed the pre-council</p>
<p>   dinner probably on six or seven occasions at least. I think it can fairly</p>
<p>   be said that speaking from a national perspective I don't think I've addressed</p>
<p>   a gathering like this in Tasmania at a time when our Federal and National</p>
<p>   standing has been stronger and better and more successful than it is at</p>
<p>   the present time.</p>
<p>  As I am able to report to you, as I will at the State Council tomorrow,</p>
<p>   the ship of State nationally is going extremely well. The Australian economy</p>
<p>   now is the best it's been for more than three decades. We now have the lowest</p>
<p>   level of employment nationally than for more than ten years. There has been</p>
<p>   5.8 percentage point reduction in the number of young people unemployed</p>
<p>   in the three and a quarter years that we've been in office. In fact there</p>
<p>   are fewer young Australians looking for full time work than at any time</p>
<p>   since statistics on that particular activity began to be measured in the</p>
<p>   1970s. We saw yesterday figures demonstrating that nationally we have the</p>
<p>   lowest level of long-term unemployed in this country since 1991. We have</p>
<p>   created almost 500,000 new jobs in Australia in the last three and a quarter</p>
<p>   years. We've turned a budget deficit of $10.5 billion into a strong surplus.</p>
<p>   We have the lowest interest rates, the lowest rate of inflation and the</p>
<p>   strongest sustained levels of business investment for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>   Our national debt to GDP ratio is healthily lower than what it was in the</p>
<p>   1980s and is one of the best in the OECD area.</p>
<p>  Coming down on the plane from Sydney I read with enormous pride a lengthy</p>
<p>   article in the latest edition of Fortune magazine read by all of those who</p>
<p>   make major economic decisions not only in the United States but around the</p>
<p>   world which talked about the strengths and confidence of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy.</p>
<p>  I've just come back from a visit to the United States which included a visit</p>
<p>   to the financial capital of the world, New York, and in the 20 or more years</p>
<p>   that I've been visiting that city in different capacities I have never encountered</p>
<p>   such a universally positive view about Australia. We are seen with a new</p>
<p>   respect and a new reverence for what we have been able to achieve, especially</p>
<p>   over the last three years. And the fact that we've been able to stare down</p>
<p>   the Asian economic downturn has given to this country a greater sense of</p>
<p>   self-belief and self-confidence and national pride at our capacity to achieve</p>
<p>   things than at any time that I've been in public life.</p>
<p>  So I am very happily able to report to you that nationally we are steering</p>
<p>   a very steady course and we go into the next century at the end of this</p>
<p>   year with the underlying strengths of the Australian economy and a sense</p>
<p>   of national wellbeing that like of which I have not experienced in the 25</p>
<p>   years that I have been in Parliament.</p>
<p>  Now that has not been achieved by accident. It's not been achieved by just</p>
<p>   good luck. You make your own luck in politics as you do in life. It has</p>
<p>   been achieved because when we come into office we set ourselves some goals</p>
<p>   and we stuck to achieving those goals. It's also been achieved because there</p>
<p>   were one or two intelligent reforms undertaken by the former government</p>
<p>   and I've never been reluctant to give the former government credit for one</p>
<p>   or two of the significant reforms and I think particularly of the moves</p>
<p>   towards a freer financial system and the changes that were made in tariff</p>
<p>   policy in the early 1990s which I think contributed very significantly to</p>
<p>   a stronger Australian economy.</p>
<p>  But the major reforms we have undertaken over the last three and a quarter</p>
<p>   years have contributed the lion's share of the strengthening of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy and it's been achieved by all of us working together. And I would</p>
<p>   take this opportunity at this dinner as I always do to express my immense</p>
<p>   gratitude to the rank and file members of the Liberal party for sticking</p>
<p>   with us. You can't win elections without party members and what I have achieved</p>
<p>   in politics and what my parliamentary colleagues have achieved in politics</p>
<p>   has been overwhelming due to your efforts. And you stuck by us when we were</p>
<p>   out of office federally and at a state level. Things are pretty good federally.</p>
<p>   I know you are going through a less happy time at a state level and I'll</p>
<p>   come to the state scene in a moment. But there are times when we were out</p>
<p>   of office just about everywhere. And people were writing the party off and</p>
<p>   they were saying it was finished. And they were really talking about a new</p>
<p>   political order that didn't really have the Liberal Party featuring very</p>
<p>   strongly. But there were many people in this room who stuck by us and you</p>
<p>   all, and we all lived, to fight another day and we all lived ultimately</p>
<p>   to win in March of 1996.</p>
<p>  So this is an occasion for me as the fortunate beneficiary at a Federal</p>
<p>   level of that sustained loyalty and help over so many years to extend my</p>
<p>   grateful thanks to the people of the Tasmanian Liberal Party who've helped</p>
<p>   us so much and have been the life-blood of our support through all of the</p>
<p>   difficult years as well as through some of the better years. But as I survey</p>
<p>   the national scene I recognise that it's uneven.</p>
<p>  I was saying to Margot Gatenby a few moments ago that very recently I attended</p>
<p>   a dinner for two of my Federal colleagues in Sydney. The dinner was held</p>
<p>   at Sylvania Waters - a famous family didn't turn up! We'd have taken their</p>
<p>   donation! It was a very large and enthusiastic dinner. About 600 people</p>
<p>   at it. And in the course of it one of the members, Bruce Baird, said that</p>
<p>   the unemployment rate in the Sutherland shire of Sydney, which covered the</p>
<p>   two seats involved was only 2.3 percent and there are many parts of Australia</p>
<p>   where unemployment has gone to very low levels or virtually disappeared.</p>
<p>   But I also know that there are many areas of Australia where that is not</p>
<p>   the case and I know that Tasmania still continues to have much higher levels</p>
<p>   of unemployment than many other parts of Australia although there has been</p>
<p>   a significant improvement all over the country. But there is still particular</p>
<p>   challenges faced by your island state which are not faced by other parts</p>
<p>   of the country and we at a federal level have always been conscious of that</p>
<p>   and that is why historically we've been associated with such job injecting</p>
<p>   schemes as the freight equalization program and we've presided over what</p>
<p>   I think I could confidently and modestly describe as a sensitive division</p>
<p>   of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra to ensure that Tasmania gets a fair</p>
<p>   share.</p>
<p>  I've got to say that John Olsen and Richard Court don't use the word sensitive.</p>
<p>   And from time to time they take me to account over that but I make absolutely</p>
<p>   no apology at all to anybody, anywhere in Australia for what my government</p>
<p>   has done in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust to help the people of</p>
<p>   Tasmania. No apology at all. I defend the decision to spend every last dollar.</p>
<p>   And I also take the opportunity as all of us must as Liberals, to remind</p>
<p>   the Premier of this State that when he announces programs that have been</p>
<p>   funded by federal money he might at least have the honesty and the decency</p>
<p>   to acknowledge the source of the funds.</p>
<p>  Now that of course brings me to say something else about the question of</p>
<p>   state and federal responsibilities. One of the great things that we've been</p>
<p>   able to do at a federal level is that we've been able to reduce our accumulated</p>
<p>   federal government debt.</p>
<p>  When we came to power the accumulated federal government debt of this country</p>
<p>   was in the order of $85-$90 billion. That is the money that had been racked</p>
<p>   up through successive deficits by the federal government and there had been</p>
<p>   a very big increase in that amount over the last few years that the federal</p>
<p>   Labor government had been in office.</p>
<p>  And I can report to you tonight that if we are able to sell the remaining</p>
<p>   50.1 per cent of the government's ownership, the government's shares in</p>
<p>   Telstra we will by the year 2002-2003 be able to totally eliminate net commonwealth</p>
<p>   government debt in this country.</p>
<p>  And one of the reasons why we have lower interest rates in this country</p>
<p>   is that we no longer have the federal government voraciously competing in</p>
<p>   the financial markets with private companies for the loanable funds within</p>
<p>   our financial system. It is no accident that we have lower interest rates.</p>
<p>   It's partly due to the fact that we have lower inflation and we have rising</p>
<p>   labour productivity which moderates wage claims, but one of the other reasons</p>
<p>   is that the Federal Government is not soaking up as much money as it once</p>
<p>   used to and that is taking pressure off interest rates. And if you go from</p>
<p>   the Federal level and go around the states, you see the same pattern. Victoria</p>
<p>   has dug itself out of a huge economic hole. It has returned prosperity to</p>
<p>   that state and pride to the city of Melbourne in particular under Jeff Kennett's</p>
<p>   leadership because they have tackled the debt problem of that State.</p>
<p>  I was in South Australia recently, and I spent a lot of time talking to</p>
<p>   the business community of Adelaide and to the business community of that</p>
<p>   State and I found there a sense of hope and confidence and optimism I haven't</p>
<p>   found for a long time. And I lost count of the number of business men and</p>
<p>   women who said to me that the reason why people were so much more confident</p>
<p>   was that they thought national economic management was strong and effective,</p>
<p>   and the national economic climate was good, but they also felt that because</p>
<p>   the South Australian Government had finally been able to get the long-term</p>
<p>   leasing of ETSA, the South Australian Electricity Authority, through the</p>
<p>   State Parliament, the State now had a prospect of eliminating its debt and</p>
<p>   joining the other relatively debt free States and the Commonwealth in a</p>
<p>   far more optimistic debt free future.</p>
<p>  Now, all of that, ladies and gentlemen, inevitably leads me, as you might</p>
<p>   expect it does, to say something about the overwhelming need for the State</p>
<p>   of Tasmania to do something about the chronic debt problem of this State.</p>
<p>   Tony Rundle was absolutely right. Tony Rundle was speaking for the future</p>
<p>   of Tasmania with the policy on the hydro that he took to the last election.</p>
<p>   I know it may be unpopular with some Tasmanians for me to say it but I'm</p>
<p>   going to say it nonetheless, that until this State tackles its long-term</p>
<p>   debt problem and does something about it through the long-term leasing or</p>
<p>   sale or whatever arrangements in relation to the hydro it is going to continue</p>
<p>   to languish and it going to continue to be seen by the rest of Australia</p>
<p>   as essentially responsible for its own problems. And the more that other</p>
<p>   States are willing to do the things that are necessary to fix the problem</p>
<p>   in their own States the less sympathy there will be for the plight of Tasmanians.</p>
<p>   Now, I say that as a friend. I say that as somebody who's come to this State</p>
<p>   in different capacities every year of the 25 years that I've been in Parliament.</p>
<p>   And I say it as somebody who frequently says in other parts of Australia</p>
<p>   that there are special needs and special problems in Tasmania which need</p>
<p>   to be understood and need to be addressed. But you cannot forever ignore</p>
<p>   the fact that the debt of this State as a share of gross State product is</p>
<p>   more than four times the average of all of the Australian States. And that</p>
<p>   until that is tackled, and we all know the only way in which it can be tackled,</p>
<p>   until that is tackled, is going to remain an albatross around the neck of</p>
<p>   this State. And I say it with the greatest of goodwill and the greatest</p>
<p>   of sincerity, it does need to be tackled.</p>
<p>  And, in a sense, the developments over the last year where quite a lot of</p>
<p>   additional funds have begun to flow under the various schemes that I mentioned</p>
<p>   into Tasmania, and as I say, all of those decisions are utterly justifiable</p>
<p>   and necessary and appropriate but, in a sense, that is being used as a bit</p>
<p>   of an excuse, as a bit of a smokescreen by the current Tasmanian Government</p>
<p>   to give the impression that the debt problem is no longer with you. It is.</p>
<p>   The debt problem will always be with Tasmania until something is done about</p>
<p>   it. It won't disappear overnight. And just as we had to do something about</p>
<p>   our debt problem, and it wasn't as great in relative terms, bad though it</p>
<p>   was, and we are now enjoying the benefit of having done something about</p>
<p>   it, so it is with the State of Tasmania.</p>
<p>  Can I say but two other things to you. One of those relates to the forest</p>
<p>   industry in this State. You all know as Tasmanians how important both the</p>
<p>   economics and the politics of forestry in this State have been over the</p>
<p>   years. You will be aware of the Regional Forest Agreement that Tony Rundle</p>
<p>   and I negotiated not so long ago. And it brought an unparalleled balance,</p>
<p>   I think, into proper concern for environmental values but also a lot of</p>
<p>   additional investment in the industry in various parts of Tasmania. And</p>
<p>   it's already led to the creation of several hundred new jobs. And it was</p>
<p>   seen by the industry as providing 20 years of long-term security. And for</p>
<p>   the first time every, at a Federal level, I insisted that Federal guarantees</p>
<p>   be given in respect of any capricious breach of contract and removal and</p>
<p>   withdrawal of resource security. And I did that because I thought it was</p>
<p>   a fair request and I also did it in the face of some institutional objections</p>
<p>   to the very notion that the national government should, in fact, guarantee</p>
<p>   that if people made an investment in an industry they could confidently</p>
<p>   expect that the conditions under which the investment were made would be</p>
<p>   honoured in the long-term by the governments of Australia. I thought that</p>
<p>   was a pretty reasonable request by industry. And what the forest industry,</p>
<p>   the timber industry of this State has had to put up with over the years</p>
<p>   with capricious withdrawals of consents and approvals by federal governments</p>
<p>   in particular, has been, I think, quite unreasonable. And that agreement</p>
<p>   was a very good agreement. And it was an agreement that was widely acclaimed</p>
<p>   by the trade union movement not only in Tasmania but around Australia, by</p>
<p>   the timber industry and it was also recognised by all but the most radical</p>
<p>   environmentalists as being also a very good deal for the environment. And</p>
<p>   I have to tell you that a Labor Party amendment to the Regional Forest Legislation</p>
<p>   in the Senate could cast, if it were carried - and I can assure you it won't</p>
<p>   be carried with the support of any Coalition Senators - and, of course,</p>
<p>   it won't be carried in the House of Representatives, but if it were carried</p>
<p>   it would undermine the agreement that Tony and I signed. Because what the</p>
<p>   amendment proposes is that you draw a distinction between Regional Forest</p>
<p>   Agreement signed before and after a particular date. And the design of that,</p>
<p>   of course, is to ensure that the Tasmanian agreement is not affected by</p>
<p>   the amendment. But the problem is there's another part of the amendment</p>
<p>   that says that all Regional Forest Agreements have got to comply with the</p>
<p>   objects of the Act which are to be inserted by the amendments. It's pretty</p>
<p>   ridiculous to put forward the proposition that a Regional Forest Agreement</p>
<p>   signed more than a year ago ought to comply with the objects of an Act that</p>
<p>   are going to be inserted in the Act in a few weeks time. You only have to</p>
<p>   state that to see how ridiculous it is. And on top of that, I've been advised</p>
<p>   by the crime law authorities in Canberra that the amendment, in any event,</p>
<p>   is unconstitutional because it's in breach of section 99 of the Constitution</p>
<p>   which says that you can't, in effect, at a Federal level, discriminate between</p>
<p>   the States or between different parts of the States. One of the cornerstone</p>
<p>   principles of the Federal compact made almost 100 years ago.</p>
<p>  Now, I mention the detail of that to illustrate the nonsense that is going</p>
<p>   on still at a Federal Labor level on the issue of resource security. And</p>
<p>   I think it's something that the trade union movement in this State ought</p>
<p>   to be outraged about and it is something that the State Labor government</p>
<p>   ought to be put on the rack about because it is their mates in Canberra</p>
<p>   who are playing fast and loose if they got their own way with the agreement</p>
<p>   that was signed by Tony and myself. Now, I want to assure you and assure</p>
<p>   all Tasmanians that there is no way that that lunatic amendment can get</p>
<p>   up because we're not going to support it. And even if they got the majority</p>
<p>   in the Senate there's no way it could go through the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>   But it is a matter of concern to me that the Labor Party has still not passed</p>
<p>   the Regional Forest Legislation. And we'll all be pushing very hard to get</p>
<p>   it through in the form in which it is presented.</p>
<p>  I mention that, my friend, because that issue is very important to Tasmania.</p>
<p>   And I'm very proud of the agreement that I negotiated with Tony Rundle.</p>
<p>   It was very balanced and it's provided a lot of long-term security. But</p>
<p>   the Labor Party, at a Federal level, is now run by people who are utterly</p>
<p>   indifferent to a balanced industry outcome. And they don't seem to care</p>
<p>   at all about how hard it is for blue collar workers to get jobs in regional</p>
<p>   areas of Australia. And if you capriciously close down a forest industry</p>
<p>   and you throw men and women out of work as a result it's very difficult</p>
<p>   indeed for those people to find jobs in alternative employment. And it's</p>
<p>   very interesting that the people who are taking up the cudgels more and</p>
<p>   more for the blue collar workers of regional areas of Australia are, in</p>
<p>   fact, Liberals and National Party members. And Wilson Tuckey, my Minister</p>
<p>   for Forests, is doing a great job taking up the cudgels for the timber workers,</p>
<p>   not only here but I might say also in other parts of Australia.</p>
<p>  The final thing I want to say to you is very much about the future of our</p>
<p>   party and the future of our country. We are about to end this century. We're</p>
<p>   about to enter a new millennium. And we enter that new millennium with a</p>
<p>   sense of optimism and national self confidence which is greater than I have</p>
<p>   ever experienced. We are in a special place, not only in the world but we're</p>
<p>   also in a special place and moment as far as our history is concerned. We</p>
<p>   are a country that has very deep roots with Europe. We are a projection</p>
<p>   of western civilisation in many ways in this part of the world. But we've</p>
<p>   had a long political association with the United States and we share many</p>
<p>   values in common with that country. But here we are, though, in the Asian</p>
<p>   Pacific region and we have hundreds of thousands of Australians of Asian</p>
<p>   descent now making a terrific contribution to the building of our community.</p>
<p>   And we occupy a very special intersection of history and geography and culture.</p>
<p>   We're the only country in the world that has got that combination and it</p>
<p>   gives us a capacity to do things and achieve things in our region and around</p>
<p>   the world that we haven't been able to do before.</p>
<p>  You can carry authority in the world if you've got a strong economy. It's</p>
<p>   no good lecturing people if things are a mess at home. And people will listen</p>
<p>   to you with a new respect and a new regard and a new ore if you lead a country</p>
<p>   that has been successful. And we have been successful in a way that few</p>
<p>   societies this century have been. We've got a strong economy. We're a tolerant</p>
<p>   nation. We've been continuously democratic for the entire century. And,</p>
<p>   therefore, as the person who has the immense privilege of being the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of our country as we come towards the end of this century, I have</p>
<p>   to say that we have achieved an enormous amount. And our great responsibility</p>
<p>   is to build on that as we go into the next millennium and to give to our</p>
<p>   children in that next millennium the sort of foundations that I know all</p>
<p>   of us would want to do. It's a great time to be a Liberal in Australia.</p>
<p>   It's a great time to be part of a very significant and very proud chapter</p>
<p>   in the history of our country. Thank you.</p>
