PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
BEN-GURION CENTENARY<br />
MELBOURNE,-8 NOVEMBER 1987<br />
Tonight brings to a close a year's celebration in Australia<br />
of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of David<br />
Ben-Gurion a man through whose vision the state of Israel<br />
was born, through whose efforts the Jewish people throughout<br />
the world were united in a common cause, and through whose<br />
ideals the world was given a society of enduring commitment<br />
to the free and egalitarian principles of democracy.<br />
David Ben-Gurion personified the traditions, the<br />
aspirations, and the achievements of the Jewish people.<br />
Indeed as the founder of the modern state of Israel he can<br />
claim to have brought those traditions and aspirations to<br />
their just and logical fulfillment in the achievement of<br />
nationhood and independence for the Jewish people.<br />
The letter from Shimon Peres that has just been read<br />
provides eloquent testimony of the achievement and legacy of<br />
David Ben-Gurion.<br />
Ben-Gurion was born in the Diaspora in Plonsk in northern<br />
Poland. From an early age he became imbued with the spirit<br />
of Zionism. He went to Palestine as a pioneer in 1906 and<br />
his whole life thereafter was spent in the struggle of the<br />
Zionist cause as it sought to establish a Jewish national<br />
homeland there.<br />
He served for 14 years as secretary of the Confederation of<br />
Labour, the Histadrut. Under his guidance it became not<br />
only a trade union repres~ enting the interests of workers but<br />
also a means of mobilising all pioneers, farmers and workers<br />
in the endeavour to create and foster a Jewish statet<br />
And I know from my personal contacts with the Histadrut,<br />
built up over a number of visits to Israel, what an<br />
impressive and effective organisation it is in the<br />
achievement of those goals.<br />
All Australians can identify with the work Ben-Gurion and<br />
his fellows faced in successfully challenging the deserts to<br />
bloom; and I mention in passing the appropriateness of the<br />
inauguration of gardens his honour, having had the pleasure<br />
of opening one such garden in Perth and, together with 0 () 23,33<br />
mmmmmsvn WMR </p>
<p>President Herzog, another at the National Jewish Memorial<br />
Centre in Canberra.<br />
David Ben-Gurion worked all his life for the Israeli working<br />
class. He was a great socialist, a man of great vision, an<br />
inspiring leader for Labour Parties every where.<br />
After Ben-Gurion proclaimed the independence of the State of<br />
Israel on 14 May, 1948, he became its first Prime Minister,<br />
and his inspired leadership over 15 years guided the new<br />
nation through many of its early trials.<br />
But David Ben-Gurion also knew that more . than physical<br />
labour was needed to recreate the Jewish homeland and more<br />
even than the idealism of Zionism.<br />
What was also needed, regrettably, was the capacity to<br />
defend itself. So he became not only the first Prime<br />
Minister of the new nation but also its first Defence<br />
Minister. And in the forty years since that proclamation, he and his<br />
successors as Prime Minister and Defence Minister have had<br />
to call on Israel's armed forces to defend the very<br />
existence of the nation.<br />
When I made my first visit to Israel in 1971 two years<br />
before Ben-Gurion's death nothing could have been more<br />
apparent than that Israel was then a country surrounded by<br />
nations committed to its destruction. Israel's very<br />
survival was in question.<br />
Now, as a result of the brilliance and courage the Israeli<br />
people exhibited in fighting for their collective survival,<br />
the security of their nation is assured.<br />
Throughout the whole cycle of the establishment and<br />
entrenchment of the Israeli nation, one theme emerges as a<br />
constant. It is a theme with which Ben-Gurion was familiar:<br />
political courage.<br />
I mean courage to take the risks inherent in the huge human<br />
drama of Zionism; courage to fight when necessary a need<br />
made all the more stark by the horror of the Holocaust; and<br />
of complete relevance to today's Israel courage to know<br />
when negotiation, not confrontation, is the right course.<br />
Earlier this year I had the pleasure of making an official<br />
visit to Israel, Jordan and Egypt which alflowed me at first<br />
hand to gain-an up-to-date perspective of the current<br />
position in the Middle East.<br />
The Arab-Israeli dispute has resulted in four wars between<br />
Israel and its neighbours since the Second World War. If it<br />
is left unresolved, the dispute still has potential to<br />
involve the rest of the world should the region become a<br />
stage for conflict between the super powers. 00236S4 </p>
<p>Yet it is my judgement, developed before my visit and'<br />
strongly confirmed by it, that the leaders of Israel and of<br />
two of the main Arab S * tates that are party to the dispute<br />
Jordan and Egypt are committed to the achievement of peace<br />
in the region.<br />
I don't mean just the achievement of a formal peace which<br />
would bring an end to the fighting. I mean, more<br />
importantly, that they are committed to a constructive peace<br />
which would advance the economic and social wellbeing, as<br />
well as the political freedoms, of all the peoples in the<br />
region.<br />
There is no simple panacea or ready formula that can be<br />
applied to resolve a conflict that goes back more than<br />
years. But I believe some necessary elements are within<br />
reach, which suggests strongly that the path to peace could<br />
be opened up by courageous leaders.<br />
I have already referred to the most important of these<br />
elements. First, I believe, that the question facing Israel<br />
is no longer the question of whether it has the capacity to<br />
survive. Its survival is assured thanks in part to the<br />
risks Israel was forced to take in fighting the wars of<br />
1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973.<br />
The question now facing Israel is whether it can take<br />
similar risks in entering negotiations, on the basis of its<br />
assured survival, to achieve lasting peace.<br />
And second, there may never again be a situation in which<br />
Israel has, in King Hussein and President Mubarak, two<br />
leaders who are unequivocally and sincerely committed to an<br />
end of the fighting and tensions and to the creation of a<br />
constructive peace in the region.<br />
Accordingly the convening of an international peace<br />
conference stands as a constructive possibility which must<br />
be addressed if a settlement of the Middle East's problems<br />
is to be found. Such a conference should not impose<br />
solutions on the parties but would provide a framework<br />
within which discussions between the parties could take<br />
place. The actual mechanics of holding the conference whether for<br />
example, the conference is attended by the five permanent<br />
nations of the UN Security Council or held under the joint<br />
auspices of the United States and Soviet Union are less<br />
important than that the conference genuinely seek achieve<br />
the desired result of peace.<br />
The question of the PLO's involvement in a conference would<br />
have to be determined in the process of discussions between<br />
the parties.<br />
The capacity of the PLO to play a role would depend on their<br />
preparedness to accept Israel's right to exist and to<br />
translate their tacit acceptance that Israel is going to </p>
<p>continue permanently to bepart of the map of the Middle<br />
East into a formal statement of that position.<br />
This would require, first, that the PLO shall in fact accept<br />
and recognise UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.<br />
This would lead, second, to recognition of Israel's right to<br />
exist within secure and internationally recognised<br />
boundaries. And, third, they should repudiate the strategy<br />
of terror and accept the process of negotiation.<br />
If these three things were done, there would be in my<br />
judgement an obligation upon Israel to reciprocate<br />
contemporaneously by recognising the fact of the PLO's<br />
representative capacity and its entitlement to participation<br />
in the process of negotiation.<br />
It is no secret that there is division within the Israeli<br />
Government over the future course of events, and, in<br />
particular, over the merit of an international conference.<br />
Australia is not of course a party principal to the Middle<br />
East dispute, but within our capacity, we stand ready to<br />
help if that is the wish of the countries most directly<br />
involved. Let me repeat that it is a sine qua non of Australian<br />
involvement in peace effects in the IMiddle East that our<br />
purpose is to achieve the necessary conditions by which<br />
Israel can be totally secure and that peace is constructive<br />
and hence lasting.<br />
Ben Gurion spoke often of the common interests of Israel and<br />
the Arab world, of the Middle East's potential to become the<br />
world's richest garden, of how by standing together in<br />
friendship and good will the countries of the middle East<br />
could aspire to an independence and economic<br />
self-sufficiency never achieved in all its history. In his<br />
memoirs written in 1970, he said:<br />
" Our desire for peace is constant we are prepared to<br />
envisage important concessions in the name of a true<br />
negotiation with the nations that surround us.<br />
Certainly we stand ready to mobilise all the energy and<br />
skills we have been forced to develop and invest in<br />
defence, for the far more fruitful purpose of materially<br />
aiding our neighbours to attain levels of peaceful<br />
development<br />
Today, the same challenge faces the Stater of Israel. Let us<br />
hope that the vision of Ben Gurion inspires her leaders to<br />
accept that challenge.<br />
I do not underestimate for a minute the difficulty of the<br />
course I am recommending.<br />
But let me put to you the factor which compelled my<br />
conclusion that Israel must take the path of negotiations.. 0 0 4_ 31 6G </p>
<p>It revolves around the simple and inexorable arithmetic of<br />
demography.<br />
The population of Israel, including the occupied<br />
territories, consists roughly of 3 million Jews and 2<br />
million Arabs. Of those 2 million Arabs, some 1.3 million<br />
live in the occupied territories.<br />
The population projections between 1985 and 2015 are for a<br />
population growth among the Arab residents of some 2.7 per<br />
cent and among the Jewish population of about 1.3 per cent.<br />
What we must understand therefore is that by the turn of the<br />
century the Jews could be a minority in their own land.<br />
In such an outcome, Jews would then have to make the choice<br />
between remaining a Jewish State or a democratic state.<br />
That choice is unpalatable indeed it is unacceptable. It<br />
is certainly not the choice that the founders of the State<br />
of Israel including David Ben-Gurion dreamed of, or died<br />
for. But unless the process of negotiation is pursued and<br />
embraced, it is the choice that will face the next<br />
generation of Israeli leaders.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
As many of you will know, I will be making an official visit<br />
to the Soviet Union later this month, accompanied by my<br />
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden and a delegation of Australian<br />
businessmen. It is a very timely visit for many reasons, not least that<br />
it will immediately precede the summit meeting between<br />
Secretary-General Gorbachev and President Reagan, at which<br />
the INF treaty is to be signed.<br />
we can all, I believe, take deep satisfaction at this<br />
manifestation by the superpowers of their intention and<br />
capacity to work together constructively in their mutual<br />
interest to the advancement of the safety and security of us<br />
all. In particular, the signing of the INF treaty is very welcome<br />
since it will be the first time the superpowers have agreed<br />
to reduce, as opposed to slow the rate of growth of, their<br />
nuclear arsenals.<br />
In my talks with the Russian leadership I will be taking<br />
every opportunity to advance the cause of further arms<br />
control negotiations with the United States.<br />
Bill Hayden and I will also be pushing very strongly an<br />
issue of even greater significance to this audience, namely,<br />
the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate. 0023637 </p>
<p>Since we came to office, the Government has made clear to<br />
the Soviet Union its concern about human rights there,<br />
including the question of the rights of Soviet Jews.<br />
Bill Hayden did this directly in Moscow in 1984. Both Bill<br />
Hayden and I have raised the issue with Soviet<br />
representatives in Canberra on a number of occasions.<br />
I spoke with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze about our<br />
concerns on this during his March visit. Mr Shevardnadze<br />
gave me his assurance that he would look into the cases<br />
which we had passed to the Soviets.<br />
And the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Joan Child,<br />
presented a list of refuseniks to the Chairman of the<br />
Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet on 4 July<br />
1986. The latest figures to hand show that 782 Soviet Jews were<br />
granted exit permission in August 1987, bringing the total<br />
for the year to 4681.<br />
Jewish emigration since April has averaged about 800 per<br />
month. This is a welcome advance on the total of 914 for all of<br />
1986, but less than the 2000 per month allowed to leave<br />
during the 1970s.<br />
There has been, happily, movement in regard both to<br />
refuseniks on the Speaker's list and to family reunion.<br />
All in all, we welcome the progress which has been made, and<br />
the more open-minded attitude being shown by the Soviet<br />
authorities, for example in* recently facilitating a visit to<br />
Moscow by Mr Isi Liebler of your community, a gesture which<br />
I believe is significant.<br />
But there is ' clearly a. great deal more to be done in this<br />
area and I am looking forward to my visit to Leningrad and<br />
Moscow to advance this cause.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I am grateful for your generous invitation to me to deliver<br />
this address in honour of David Ben-Gurion.<br />
There is an integrity, clarity and decency about him, which<br />
continues to cast a wholesome reflection on humanity in<br />
general and on Israel in particular.<br />
This makes it all the more regrettable and remarkable that<br />
perversions of the truth persist into our day. we have<br />
recently seen the discreditable ideas of Mr David Irving<br />
receive far more attention here and abroad than they could<br />
conceivably deserve. 0 0 23 68 </p>
<p>7<br />
And we still encounter too frequently the obnoxious equation<br />
of Zionism with racism which was asserted by the United<br />
Nations itself, through its 1975 Resolution 3379.<br />
It is my very great pleasure however that the Australian<br />
Parliament last October passed a motion, unanimously, which<br />
seeks to overturn the perverted logic of that UN Resolution.<br />
I took even greater pleasure and pride in the fact that last<br />
month on the first anniversary of the Australian<br />
Parliament's decision, the US Senate passed a motion in<br />
identical terms to our Australian motion. The motion was<br />
referred to in debate in the US Senate as " the Australian<br />
Resolution." By the terms of the resolutions, Australia and the United<br />
States now stand together committed to lending support to<br />
efforts to overthrow the UN Resolution. 3.<br />
If this effort allows us to look with clearer eyes at the<br />
original notion of Zionism as it was conceived of by the<br />
pioneers of Sen-Gurion's generation, then so much the<br />
better. Israel, as I have said, faces profound choices about its<br />
future. The deliberation on these issues by the current<br />
generation of leaders may well be aided by reference to the<br />
thoughts of their predecessors.<br />
So let me close with two quotations from David Ben-Gurion.<br />
They are not too lengthy and I believe they are of direct<br />
relevance to the issues I have raised this evening.<br />
In these words, from an interview of 1965, Ben-Gurion<br />
described the goals which he wanted to fulfill as Prime<br />
Minister of the State of Israel.<br />
Minise, yg wasfte crton ofc as modeoit<br />
oriysel, m golon before Ireto ofc as Prmeoit<br />
which could become, in the language of the Biblical<br />
prophets, a light unto the nations' I wanted the new V~'<br />
Israel to be a democratic society; to be idealistic;<br />
~ to follow the injunction of helping thy neighbour; to<br />
work hard in pioneering the desert spaces and rebuilding<br />
our long neglected land; for all to work in harmony<br />
with each other without the one being exploit(! d by the<br />
other; to give homogeneity to the diverse immigrant<br />
groups to whom we opened our gates on the very first day<br />
of our State; to raise the educational, social and<br />
economic levels of those who came from primitive lands<br />
to a standard of equality with the veteran settlers; to<br />
harness the boons of modern scientific discovery to the<br />
ancient moral teachings of our forebears. These were my<br />
goals, and the goals of my colleagues."<br />
And to conclude, let me quote again from Ben-Gurion's<br />
memoirs of 1970: </p>
<p>8<br />
" What is Israel? It is two things: an Ark and a<br />
Covenant; in other words a refuge and a dynamic. I<br />
think the dynamic, the Covenant, takes precedence over<br />
the concept of refuge.<br />
the State of Israel will not be tested by its<br />
strength of economy alone but by its spirit. We have<br />
inherited a great heritage, and it is binding. We have<br />
revolted against all regimes, religions, laws which<br />
the powers of the world have attempted to impose on us<br />
( The State of Israel) will be tested by the moral<br />
image it will lend its citizens, by the human values<br />
which will determine its international and external<br />
relations, by its faithfulness, in deed and work, to the<br />
supreme command of Judaism: " Though shalt love thy<br />
neighbour as thyself." S00370 </p>
