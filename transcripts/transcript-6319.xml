TRANSCRIPT -PRIME MINISTER' S PRESS CONFERENCE AT STATE GUEST<br />
HOUSE 9 FEBRUARY 1984<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PJI.: WELL LADIES AND OENTLEMEN I'll VERY PLEASED TO0 BE ABLE TO<br />
ANNOUNCE A SIGNIEFICANT DEVELOPMENT OUT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS T1HIS<br />
MORNING WHICH HAS. VEIRY GREAT P': ITENTIAL FOR AUSTRALIA A* ND ALSO, I<br />
BEL-IEVE, FOR CHINA. I PUT TO PREMIER ZHAO THE POLICIES OF OUR<br />
GOVERNMENT IN THE ECONOMiC FIEL. D NOT ONLY IN : REGARD TO THE IM ' EDIATE<br />
OBJECTIVES THAT WE' D HAD OF TURtliNG OUR !-. CONqOrY' AIRO. U. ND I-U1 OF ALSO<br />
TRYING To ENSURE THAT THE ECONOMIC DEVEL;) Pf'! E. N1 OF AUSTRALIA COULD<br />
BE RELATED AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE To THE RTEGION OF WHICH WE<br />
ARE PART SO TH -AT AS YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE WE COULD Å“ ECoNiE<br />
ENMESHED. ' 1N' . THF_ DEV ELOPmENT OF THE REGION 1N A WAY WHICH WOULD<br />
ENABLE US ' T0 DERIVE BENEFIT FROM THE DYNAMISM' OF THI'. Z REGION AND IN<br />
TURN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO IT.<br />
IN THAT CONTEXT I PUT TO PREMIER ZHAO THAT WE, OF COURSE, WISHED TO<br />
BECOME A STIGNIFICANT SUPPLiER OF RAW MATERIALS T'O CHINA'S<br />
DEVELOPING IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY IRON ORE AND ALSO COAL. 1 PUl<br />
TO TH'E PREMIER THAT IN ADDITION TO BEING SUCH A SUPPLIER OF -RAW<br />
MIATERIALS IT' HAD OCCURRED TO NE THAT WE OUJGHT TO EXAMINE THE<br />
POSSIB~ ILITY OF AUSTRALIA. SUPPLY1NG RAW MATERIALS9 IF YOU LIKE..<br />
AT A MORE DEVELOPED STAGE. THAT IS OF PIG IRON, SLABS AND BILLETS,<br />
% OHCU DB THEN FINALLY PROCESSED INTO THE REOU1RED FINAL<br />
PRODUCT IN CH4INA. I POINTED OUT TO PREMIER ZHAO THE MUTUAL ? ENE_: FI13<br />
INVOLVED IN SUCH AN APPROACH. THE ADVANTAGES FOR AUSTRALIA ARE<br />
OBVIOUS AND DON'T RE?; UIRE ANY ELABORATION Of-, M" PART TO YOU OF THE<br />
VERY SIGNIFICANTf ENEF-1TS FOR AUSTRALIA: A SIGNIFICANT STAGE OF<br />
MANUFACTURE. THE BENEFITS TO CHINA I POINTED OUT WERE THAT IT WOULD<br />
NOT INVOLVE ANY INCREASE IN TOTAL IMPORTS ON THEIR PART, I N OTHER<br />
WORDS THEY ' WOULD NEED rO IMPORT LESS ST~ E'_ WHICH THEY ARE CoN. 1, TElM'pLAT-.<br />
ING HAVING TO. DO. BUT THE INCREASED IMPORT OF THE eBASIC PRO. DUCT<br />
1ROM AUSTRALIA WOULD BE OFFSETr BY LESSER IPORTS OF STEEL ON TH4EIR<br />
P: 1ART. SECONDLY, IT WOULD BE OF BENEFIT IN REDUCING TRANSPO', RT<br />
BOTTLENECK S IN THIS COUNTRY LEAVING TrHE RA-W MATERIAL ARO) UN,. D FRt'N1<br />
THE SOURCE OF THE RAW MATERIAL TO THE ENTERPRISES. THIRDLY, IN%<br />
RESPECT OF TRANSPORT INTO CHINi'A iT WILL MORE EFFI ; IENT TO ? RN<br />
IN THE PRODUCT IN THE FORM, THAT I MENTIONED BECAUSE IT WOULD B E<br />
ABLE TO BE CARRIED IN SHIPS WHICH WOU,; LD BE ABLE TO-HAVE ACCE~ iS VERY<br />
READITLY TO THEIR PLANT, 1S THA~ N THE LARGE BULK -CARRIE RS. AND FINALLY<br />
: i N EC 0ON. MI C TE RMS 1' JL'( F RO) M CH; INA' S POINT O: VIEW THEY UL<br />
GET MORE VALUE PER UNIT OF: INVESTNENT IN-THIS IWAY AND WOULD<br />
:: NVOLVE SAVINGS IN FOPREIGN EXCHANGE.<br />
J'' M VERY PLEASED To SAY THAT P?. E" I1ER ZHA() HAS RESPONDED POSITIVELY<br />
I O THAT PRO-. POSCAL ( AND ' WE HAVE A'GREE! D' TO__ E " Sfr ABLISH A iJINT 1<br />
STUDY TO DEVELOP T iE PROP'MSAL. 1 PUT TO YOU THAT THIS ! S A DEVELOPrINT(<br />
F VERY IMPORTANCE OF GREAT PO) TENTiAL. BE7NEFIT TO CUR<br />
(: oUr! T'Y AN.) AS I SAY ALSO' TO CHINA. AND IT INVOLVES As I PUTYO<br />
HIHNES E REIIERA ROC E,_ B SEEN NiE . LY iN TERiE O<br />
ADDING TO TRADE BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES LI~ ul ALSO VERY IMPO) RTANTLY<br />
To BE SEEN AS AOE) i Tu THE COrIPLE! IEN1 AR11TY OF OUR ECONONIC<br />
IDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. </p>
<p>THAT WAS A mAJUR DEVELOR! IENT TODAY. WE COVERED-ALSO A RANGE 0;:<br />
CTHER MATTERS. AND PERHAPS I COULD SREYXLFSVGFU~ F GH<br />
BJPOILOXDWE OPENED<br />
BY CONTINUING: DISCUSSIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREA. I REFERRED TO<br />
THE FACT THAT BEFORE COMING HERE&amp; AS WELL AS HAVING GONE TO KOREA$<br />
A SUBJECT THAT WE COVERED YESTERDAYi I HAD ALSO BEEN TO HONG K ONG<br />
AND JAPAN.<br />
I. N RESPECT OF HUNG KONG I INDICATED THAT IT WAS. A CLEAR VIEW OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THAT THE NEGOTIATIEONS IN RESPECT OF HONG K( ONG<br />
WERE PURELY A MATTER BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WE<br />
BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE A-SATISFACTORY OUTC: OME OF THOSE<br />
DISCUSSIONS. THIS IS A VIEW THAT I PUT IN JONG KONGi AND THAT I'VyE<br />
CONSISTENTLY HELD. AND I MUST SAY THAT THE EXPOSITION THAT WAS<br />
GIVEN BY PREMIER ZHAO TOTALL\, v CONFIRMED THE ANAL. YSIS THAT I HAVE<br />
MADE. I. REFERRED TO JAFAN HERE I SAID THAT JAPAN WAS AN IMPORrANT. TRADING<br />
PARTNER OF AUSTRALIA. THAT IWELC(:? iED THE INCREASING WARMTH IN<br />
RELATIONS. SETW EEWi C. INA AND JAPANi THAT THE THREE COUNTRIES SHARED<br />
PERCEPTIONS IiN'REGARD TO THE SECURITY ISSUES OF WORTH EAST ASIA<br />
AND " OTENTIAL 1HREATS. I REFERRED. TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY ABOUTr THE<br />
JAPANESE DEFENCE POSITION AND TH-ERE WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN<br />
PREMIER ZHAO AND MYSELF ON THAT ISSUE. WE ALSO SPOKE THEN FINALLY<br />
. IN RESPECT OF INTERNATIONAL MATTERS ABOUT 11400-CHINA AND<br />
KANPUCHEA I HAVE SEEN THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE MEETING THAT YOU HAD<br />
AS A RESULT OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH PREMIER ZHAO. THAT STATEMENT<br />
PUTS CLEARLY THE POSITION AND AS YOU WILL SEE THERE IS A VERY LARGE:<br />
MEASURE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN US ON THAT iSSUE.<br />
THE REST OF THE TIME AFTER-WE DEALT WITH THOSE INTERNATIONAL<br />
MATTERSs OF COURSEi WAS SPENT ON BILATERAL ISSUES. I SPOKEN OF THE:<br />
MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPiIENT IN THAT AREA. WE CONDUCTED THESE<br />
DISCUSSIONS ON THE 3ASIS THAT THERE ALREADY EXISTS A VERY STRONG<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. YOU WILL KNOW THAT I HAVE<br />
SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCONiSIONS IN AUSTRALIA THAT THERE IS NOD RELATICIN-i<br />
SHIP WHICH IS HORE IMPORTANT TO US THAN OUR RELA~ lONSHIP WITP CHINA.<br />
IT IS STRONGLY BASED IN TRADE AND ECONOMIC TERNSi IN POLITICAL<br />
TERMSi IN TERMS OF CULTURAL EXCHANGES, IN TERMS OF ASS16TANCE<br />
PROVIDED IN TECHNICAL AREAS. IN REGARD TO AGRICULTUREi I CONPIRKED<br />
WITH PREMIER Zs-AO TFHAT PRIMARY INDUSTRY MINISTER KERIN WILL VISIT<br />
CHINA IN NAY AN'. D AT THAT TIME lT IS EXPECTED THAT WE WILL SIGN AN<br />
AGRICULTURAL UMB. RELLA AGP. EE 1ENT BY WHICS~ I MEAN THAT ALREADY THERE<br />
ARE A RANGE OF PROGRAMS BSTWEEN' US IN T: nE FIELD OF RESEARCH AND<br />
BIOLOGY AND OTHER AGRIC'JLYURAL PROGRAMS BETWEEN US. AND IT IS AGREED<br />
THAT IT 16 APPROPRIATE THAT THAT RANGE OF CO-OPERATlVE PROGRAnS<br />
THAT DO EXIST SHOULD BE BROUGHT rOGEYHER NOW UNDER AN OVERALIL<br />
UMBRELLA AGREEMENT WHICH WILL ALSO EMBERACE REFERENCE TO OUR INTENTIONix<br />
TO * HAVE CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THE R~ ELEVANT AUTHORITIES IN CHINA<br />
THROUGH OUR AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL.<br />
WE CONFIRMED THE INTENTION TO ADD TO TKE ALREADY EXTENSIVE CULYURAL.<br />
RELATIONS BETWEEN US-AND ALSO 1WTX FIELD OW SPORTiWO CO;. TAC-THERE<br />

ESTABLISH THE CHINA. ACTION! r'LAN iN THE-. FIELD OF TRAD'S ArD OF THAT<br />
OTH R ACTION PLAN. OUR DEPAR TMENT OF TRA-DE 1HAS PREPARED A VERY<br />
EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF POSS1* 2LE AREAS OF EXPANSION WITHIN OUR TOTAL<br />
