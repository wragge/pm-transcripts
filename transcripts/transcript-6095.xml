F-1<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 April 1983<br />
Special benefits paid to bushfire and flood victims in the<br />
two weeks following the recent disasters will be ~ e~ tfo<br />
tax.<br />
This will ensure that these payments will receive thc samne<br />
tax free status that has generally applied to relief pa %, me-nts<br />
provided for disaster victims from public appeal funds.<br />
Following representations from the Victorian and South<br />
Australian Premiers the Government has agreed that the incomoe<br />
tax law should be changed to ensure that those payments aro<br />
tax exempt. The amendments will be back-dated to the time of<br />
the February floods and bushfires and will apply to similar<br />
circumstances in the future.<br />
Special benefits paid beyond the initial two week period will<br />
continue to be treated in the same way as other social !-eCLur'<br />
payments and will be subject to tax if beneficiaries' total<br />
income exceeds the tax threshold.<br />
The legislation will be presented to Parliament as soon as<br />
practicable. </p>
