    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Mr Drew Clarke PSM as Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy.</p>
<p>On 26 November 2012, the Government announced its intention to recommend the appointment of the current Secretary of that Department, Mr Peter Harris, to the position of Chair of the Productivity Commission.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the high quality service provided by Mr Harris in the role of Secretary and, more generally, over his career in the Australian Public Service.</p>
<p>Mr Clarke has been Secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism since 2010.  His earlier roles include Deputy Secretary for Resources, Energy and Tourism; Head of the Energy and Environment Division and Executive General Manager of AusIndustry and leadership of science agencies.  As an experienced Secretary, Mr Clarke is well placed to take on the role of Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy and his knowledge and experience will be an asset to the Commonwealth in his new role.</p>
<p>Having received a report from the Secretary of my Department, as required by the Public Service Act 1999, I have appointed Mr Clarke for a period of five years from 11 March 2013. </p>
<p>I will announce arrangements for the position of Secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism in the near future.</p>
