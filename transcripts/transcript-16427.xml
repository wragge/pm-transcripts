    <content><![CDATA[<p>To support Australian workers during a global recession the Government today announced a $298.5 million additional investment in employment services in Australia.</p>
<p>This targeted investment will ensure any Australian worker made redundant will now receive immediate and personalised assistance to help them get back into the workforce.</p>
<p>Rather than having to wait at least 3 months to receive intensive personalised assistance from today all newly redundant workers will now receive this support immediately.</p>
<p>This intensive assistance will be the equivalent to Stream 2 services such as:</p>
<p>     * career advice;</p>
<p>     * a comprehensive skills assessment;</p>
<p>     * skills development training;</p>
<p>     * IT support and stationery support to help with job applications;</p>
<p>     * targeted referral to appropriate education and training;</p>
<p>     * $550 credit to the Employment Pathway Fund to pay for items such computer courses, heavy vehicle license, safety boots and work uniforms.</p>
<p>Today's targeted investment builds on the Government's $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to invest in nation building, support jobs and Australian workers during a global recession.</p>
<p>The Government is determined to take all action responsibly possible to help those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own during this global recession.</p>
<p>Providers of employment services will also receive increased resources in recognition of the extra workload. In addition, providers will be eligible to receive outcome payments if they directly assist an individual to obtain a sustainable employment outcome.</p>
<p>These changes build on the Rudd Government's investment of more than $4 billion over three years on a new, more effective, employment services system that will provide better targeted support and do more to assist disadvantaged jobseekers from 1 July.</p>
<p>Today's announcement will allow workers made redundant from today access to more intensive services from April 1. The Job Seeker Account is also being made more flexible to allow funds to be used to assist job seekers without the need for unnecessary red tape.</p>
<p>In addition, the Rudd Government has committed $75 million to assist newly retrenched workers access training.</p>
<p>10,000 additional training places will be made available under the successful Productivity Places Program and delivered by Registered Training Organisations.</p>
<p>Productivity Places Program provides participants with new skills and qualifications that can lead to a pathway of further training and employment.</p>
<p>Training will be provided at the Certificate III and Certificate IV levels and will be offered across a wide range of industries.</p>
<p>The $2 billion Productivity Places Program is a major long term commitment that will deliver 711,000 training places over five years. Since April 2008 more than 80,000 Australians have enrolled in a training course through the Productivity Places Program.</p>
<p>A highly skilled workforce provides individuals with greater job opportunities and will benefit the Australian economy in the longer term.</p>
<p>The Government will take further action to assist people who lose their job into the future.</p>
<p>More information on these measures are available at the  Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations website.</p>
