PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, THE NATIONAL GALLERY, 12 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: I think we ought to give Mr Downer the holiday period, don't you think<br />
so?<br />
J: How would you feel, though, about facing two separate Opposition<br />
parties next year?<br />
PM: Well, they have always been two separate Opposition parties this<br />
has always been the great ruse of the Coalition. I mean, no-one has<br />
ever elected them as a majority in their own right, ever. They have<br />
always been a rural political rump, and the other now are, sort of, a<br />
throwback to the past. I mean, basically, what is wrong with the<br />
Coalition is, as I always say, it is not the jockey, but the horse. I mean<br />
the horse the Coalition as a set of parties don't know what they want<br />
for Australia, and that shows, and it doesn't matter who leads them.<br />
J: Prime Minister, we have just seen retail growth at 9.2% is that too<br />
fast?<br />
PM: You must be joking.<br />
ends. </p>
