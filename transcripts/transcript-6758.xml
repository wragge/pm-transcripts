    <content><![CDATA[<p>6 OctoberÂ 1985</p>
<p>It is great to be here today to officially open, asÂ part of Victoria's 150th Anniversary celebrations, theÂ Merri Creek Pathway amid such magnificant surroundings.</p>
<p>This is a most welcome initiative by the CainÂ Government in association with local councils and I amÂ pleased that my Government through the CommunityÂ Employment Program have made a significant financialÂ contribution of some $400,000 to such an importantÂ project, which has provided jobs for 35 unemployedÂ people. I might add that in terms of improving the overallÂ Merri Creek environs, the Australian Government hasÂ contributed over $ 1.0 million under the CEP which hasÂ created 70 jobs for unemployed people.</p>
<p>Such assistance recognises the great need for parks andÂ recreation areas in Melbourne's northern suburbs. ButÂ not only does this Merri Creek development provide aÂ recreational area, it also provides an excellentÂ example of the three levels of government workingÂ together for the benefit of the local community.</p>
<p>While I applaud the enterprise and efforts of theÂ Victorian Government and local councils, it is theÂ involvement and contribution to the project of theÂ local community the Merri Creek CoordinatingÂ Committee which has been a factor of key importance.</p>
<p>I would urge the continued participation of communitiesÂ such as yours in the planning and preservation ofÂ additional recreation areas under the VictorianÂ Government's Waterways Program to make them trulyÂ community projects.</p>
<p>This is an imaginative program opening up recreationalÂ resources which educate and provide welcome space forÂ all of us here today to breathe, walk, ride a bike orÂ just appreciate the natural surroundings.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that imany of Melbourinc's creeks andÂ rivers will be transformed with the creation andÂ beautif ication of parks and 1adepnjof a--xistiny<br />Oi1~ e" f SL) UCU dedS</p>
<p>For those reasons the future development of the programÂ should be warmly welcomed.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the opening up of this area forÂ community use and enjoyment, serves to remind us thatÂ recreational activities are a necessary and importantÂ part of our everyday lives especially andÂ particularly for people who live in large cities andÂ towns. Increasingly, we are becoming aware of the substantialÂ contribution that recreation, whether of an active orÂ passive nature, can make towards a healthier, a happierÂ and a more productive society. This is especially the<br />case as economic and social changes are challenging theÂ traditional views of the relationship between ' work'Â and ' leisure'.</p>
<p>Since our election in 1983 my Government has committedÂ itself to establishing a significant role in recreationÂ development in Australia.</p>
<p>Accordingly we have introduced and funded recreationÂ assistance programns which include support for nationalÂ recreation bodies and upgrading of the level of theirÂ administration.</p>
<p>We have assisted in developing projects such as thisÂ with State and Territory Governments, which encourageÂ increased community participation in recreationÂ activities.</p>
<p>A key element in the program is the provision ofÂ assistance for recreational opportunities for theÂ disabled and those in our community who areÂ disadvantaged in terms of access to recreationÂ opportunities.</p>
<p>We have also funded the publication of reference worksÂ on recreation in Australia to assist those involved inÂ recreation planning and development, and to let theÂ public know what we are doing in this area.</p>
<p>These initiatives are a first step in developing Â aÂ comprehensive Commonwealth recreation policy which asÂ my colleague, John Brown, the Minister for Sport,Â Recreation and Tourism announced only a few days agoÂ aims to improve the quality of life of all AustraliansÂ by encouraging them to participate in healthy andÂ satisfying leisure and recreation activities of theirÂ choosing. our intention is to:</p>
<p>make Australians mnore aware of the wide range ofÂ opportunities offered;</p>
<p>provide facilities for leisure time recreation, Â and encourage maximum use of existing facilities;Â and make available suitably trained personnel andÂ information resources.</p>
<p>We have taken the first steps and with the help andÂ cooperation of State and local governments, localÂ communities, voluntary organisations, and the privateÂ sector, we are confident of fulfilling those objectivesÂ in the years ahead for the benefit of all Australians.</p>
<p>It now gives me much pleasure to officially open theÂ Merri Creek Pathway.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
