AUSTRAIA( A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE COMMONWEALTH STUDY<br />
CONFERENCE, MELBOURNE, 12 May 1986<br />
ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA I WELCOME ALL PARTICIPANTS<br />
IN THE SIXTH DUKE OF ED iNBR'S COMMONWEALTH STUDY CONFERENCE.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS HONOURED TO JOIN WITH INDIA AS HOSTS AND I PARTICULARLY<br />
WELCOME YOU, I. R JHA, AS PRIME RLUISTER GANDHI'S REPRESENTATIVE.<br />
YOU WILL LIVE THROUGH THIS CONFERENCE INCREASINGLY CONSCIOUS OF<br />
THE PARADOX THAT THE IJWT OBVIOUS PERMANENT FEATURE OF OUR<br />
EXISTENCE IS THE FACT OF CHANGE. THE THEMES OF THE CONFERENCES<br />
MAKE THE POINT FOR US OURS IN 1962 WAS ' HUMAN CONSEQUEN; CES OF<br />
THE CHANGING INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMMONWEALTH AND EMPIRE";<br />
YOURS, A CENERATION LATER, IS 0BANAGING CHANGE IN AN INDUSTRIAL<br />
SOCIETY". BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY BEGIN TO TELL IT ALL. WHEN I STRUGGLE<br />
HOW BEST TO CONVEY THE DIMENSION OF CHANGE IN THAT GENERATION<br />
BETWEEN MY CONFERENCE AND YOURS, I AM INEVITABLY DRIVEN BACK TO<br />
THE WORDS OF KENNETH BOULDING, An: AMERICAN SCHOLAR: " I WAS<br />
BORN IN THE MIDDLE Of HUMAN HISTORY. THE WORLD IN WHICH I<br />
LIVE TODAY IS AS DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD IN WHICH I WAS BORN<br />
AS-THAT WORtDWAS* RT3t THE-WORLD* OF JULIUS CAESAR".<br />
IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO SPEAK OF THE GENERATION BETWEEN CANADA<br />
19b2 AND AUSTRALIA 1% 6 IN THOSE TERMS. </p>
<p>2<br />
CONSIDER FIRST THE SPECTACULAR DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTER AND<br />
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAVE CHARACTERISED WHAT HAS<br />
BEEN RIGHTLY IDENTIFIED AS THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION. THE PACE<br />
OF CHANGE IN THIS AREA IN A SINGLE GENERATION HAS BEEN FRENETIC.<br />
THOSE OF US WHO CAN REMEMBER THE OFFICE OF 1%. 02, RECALL LONG-DISTANCE<br />
PHONE CALLS AS AN EXPENSIVE, DIFFICULT, BIG PRODUCTION ITEM; DOCUMENT<br />
COPIES BEING PRODUCED WITH CARBON PAPEFN AND CUMBERSOME ELECTRO-MECHANICp<br />
CALCULATORS. THE COMPUTER WAS A LABORATORY CURIOSITY. OUR INFORMATION<br />
BASES WERE THEREFORE REGIONAL, INCOMPLETE AND ALWAYS OUT OF DATE.<br />
TODAY WE HAVE ACCESS TO WORLD-WIDE COMMUNICATIONS AT THE TOUCH OF<br />
A BUTTON; EXCHANGE-RATES QUOTED IN H~ EW YORK ARE AVAILABLE HERE IN<br />
MELBOURNE WITHIN SECONDS.<br />
POWERFUL COMPUTERS PROVIDE ACCESS TO DATA BASES AND DECISION<br />
SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND ARE ACCESSIBLE FROM THE MANAGER.' S DESK.<br />
PHOTOCOPIERS LINKED TO WORD PROCESSING COMPUTERS AND TO<br />
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, FACILITATE THE WIDEST DISTRIBUTION OF<br />
INFORMATION AND THUS. ENABLE: TOTALLY RELEVANT CONSULTATIONS.<br />
THE SPECTACULAR DEVELOPMENTS OF THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION ARE,<br />
OF COURSE, NOT SPENT OR EVEN WANING. ON THE CONTRARY THE PACE<br />
IS QUICKENING. IN IMMEDIATE PROSPECT IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WHICH<br />
COMMUNICATES WORLDWIDE IN VOICE, TEXT, GRAPHICS, DATA AND IMAGETHE<br />
INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DIGITAL NETWORK. AND JUST BEYOND THAT,<br />
ONE CAN ANTICIPATE SUCCESS FROM WORLDWIDE RESEARCH PROCEEDING NOW<br />
INTO SO-CALLED FIFTH GENERATION COMPUTING LEADING TO A DEGREE OF<br />
INTELLIGENCE IN THESE MACHINES. </p>
<p>MlAY I SAY PARENTHETICALLY THAT IF YOU THINK THIS IS FRIGHTENING<br />
THEN I JUST ASK THE MALE MEMBERS OF THIS AUDIENCE TO CONSIDER THE<br />
HEADLINES IN SATURDAY'S MELBOURNE AGE; " THE DAY WHEN DAD CAN ALSO<br />
BE NIUM P11GHT NOT BE FAR AWAY". THE REPORT WENT ON.: " r-' ANY SCIENTISTS<br />
AGREE ON THE PROBABILITY OF MEN GIVING BIRTH, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST<br />
ISSUE OF MAGAZINE ' NEW SOCIETY'.<br />
' SOME AMERICANS THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN FIVE YEARSIT SAYS".<br />
AND JUST TO GIVE IT A COMPLETELY LOCAL TOUCH, THE REPORT CONTINUES;<br />
" AN AUSTRALIAN EXPERT, ALAN TROUNSON, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE<br />
OF EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AT r: ONASH UNIVERSITY, IS QUOTED AS SAYINGi<br />
THE TECHNICAL AND) ETHICAL DIFFICULTIES WOULD BE ENORMOUS BUT IT COULD<br />
BE DONE..<br />
THAT WAS PRECISELY THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCIENTISTS IN THE DECADE<br />
BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATOMIC BOMB.<br />
THIS REPORT MAY CAUSE A CERTAIN WRY AMUSEMENT IT WILL CERTAINLY<br />
CAUSE MATURE-AGE GENTLEMEN LIKE SIR ERIC NEAL AND MYSELF* TO BE<br />
GLAD THAT WE WERE BORN WHEN WE WERE BUT IT SURELY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
THE FACT THAT NO ASSUMPTION IN RESPECT TO OUR PHYSICAL WORLD IS<br />
INVIOLATE.<br />
THAT I SPEND RELATIVELY LITTLE TIME.-ON THE VAST POLITICAL CHANGES<br />
OF THIS PAST GENERATION IS NOT TO DENY THEIR FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.<br />
THE PROCESSES OF DECOLONISATION HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED.<br />
SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE STILL TO<br />
ACHIEVE SOVEREIGNTY AND CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DESTINY, STANDS OUT<br />
LIKE AN ISLAND OF REACTION IN A SEA OF CHANGE. </p>
<p>TODAY, THE RECENTLY INDEPENDENT NATIONS BRING A TOTALLY NEW<br />
DIMENSION TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS THEIR CONCERNS AND<br />
PRE-OCCUPATIONS FEATURE PROMINENTLY, IF NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY,<br />
ON THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA.<br />
AND MAY I SAY, IN PASSING, THAT WE OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE ENTITLED<br />
TO BE PROUD OF ITS ROLE IN THIS TRANSFORMATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
LANDSCAPE. THIS UNIQUE INSTITUTION REPRESENTS A QUARTER OF THE<br />
WORLD'S POPULATION, AND NOW, A THIRD OF ITS SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT<br />
NATIONS. AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE, WE MEET AS EQUALS BECAUSE, HOWEVER<br />
FALTERItNGLY AT TIMES, WE HAVE TOGETHER LEARNED THE LIMITS OF POWER.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH HAS DEVELOPED A PARTICULAR CAPACITY TO RECOGNISE<br />
IN TIME THE NEED FOR CHANGE; TO DISCUSS CIVILISED DIRECTIONS FOR<br />
CHANGE; AND, AT IMPORTANT TIMES, TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AGENT FOR<br />
CHANGE. IF THIS GENERATION BETWEEN OUR CONFERENCES HAS WITNESSED THESE<br />
CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE, THE ECONOMIC CANVAS IS ALMOST<br />
EQUALLY UNRECOGNISABLE.<br />
A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF THE PERIOD HAS BEEN THE GROWING IMPORTANCE<br />
OF NORTH ASIA OF CHINA AND JAPAN ESPECIALLY AND THE ECONOMIC<br />
DYNAMISM OF THE WESTERN PACIFIC BASIN.<br />
I WOULD VENTURE TWO OBSERVATIONS IN THIS RESPECT. FIRST, THE<br />
REVOLUTION WHICH IS OCCURRING IN CHINA IS THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT<br />
EVENT OF OUR TIME. SECOND, THE PATTERN OF DYNAMIC ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
IN THIS REGION WILL CONTINUE TO CHARACTERISE THE PERIOD TO THE END OF </p>
<p>THIS CENTURY.<br />
BUT VIRTUALLY IN ALL REGIONS THE PACE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
CHANGE HAS ACCELERATED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES.<br />
PERHAPS THE MOST ENCOURAGING DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD ECONOMY<br />
OF TODAY AS COMPARED WITH A GENERATION AGO IS THAT VIRTUALLY<br />
EVERY COUNTRY IS CONSIDERABLY RICHER. THAT OF ITSELF IS<br />
REMARKABLE. BUT PERHAPS MORE REMARKABLE ARE THE NEW PATTERNS OF DEMAND FOR<br />
GOODS AND SERVICES IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR, WHICH<br />
HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WEALTH.<br />
SOCIAL GOODS AND SERVICES HAVE BECOME FAR MORE IMPORTANT IN THE<br />
DEMANDS MADE ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM. THIS IS EVIDENT IN THE<br />
INCREASED DEMAND FOR EDUCATION, HEALTH-CARE, URBAN TRANSPORT AND<br />
TOWN PLANNING.<br />
IN SO MANY COUNTRIES CHANGING SOCIAL VALUES HAVE BEEN REFLECTED<br />
ALSO IN INCREASED PARTICIPATION BY WOMEN IN THE WORK-FORCE WHICH<br />
IN TURN HAS REQUIRED A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENTS<br />
AND THE PROVISION OF A RANGE OF NEW SERVICES INCLUDING CHILD CARE<br />
FACILITIES.<br />
MORE GENERALLY, SPENDING ON SERVICES HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY, FAR<br />
FASTER THAN SPENDING ON GOODS THEMSELVES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO<br />
IN THE OLDER INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES. AND THERE HAS PROBABLY BEEN<br />
NO MORE DRAMATIC A RISE IN THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES THAN IN THOSE<br />
AREAS WHICH NOW FORM THE LEISURE INDUSTRY. </p>
<p>ONCE THE PRESERVE ONLY OF THE RICH, MORE AND MORE INDUSTRIALISED<br />
NATIONS ARE CHOOSING TO SPEND THEIR INCREASED WEALTH ON MORE<br />
LEISURE, BRINGING WITH IT AN ASSOCIATED DEMAND FOR COMPLEMENTARY<br />
GOODS AND SERVICES.<br />
THOSE DEMANDS HAVE REQUIRED A REDIRECTION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN<br />
THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED, ESPECIALLY AS ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION<br />
OF THIS INDUSTRY IS CAPABLE OF BEING TRADED ACROSS NATIONAL<br />
BOUNDARIES. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT INCREASED LEISURE HAS MEANT<br />
INCREASED TOURISM, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY<br />
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.<br />
WHEN REFLECTING ON THESE CHANGES, ONE MUST APPRECIATE HOW FUNDAMENTAL<br />
HAVE BEEN THE STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC ADJUSTMENTS TO BE ACCOMMODATED<br />
BY ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SCENE.<br />
THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN PART REFLECT MASSIVE SHIFTS IN PATTERNS OF<br />
WORLD TRADE AND INVESTMENT. BUT FOR MANY OF THE DEVELOPED<br />
COUNTRIES THEY ALSO PRESENT NEW CHALLENGES.<br />
AS NEW CENTRES HAVE DEVELOPED THE EXPERTISE TO PRODUCE THE<br />
TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS OF THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AT COMPARABLE<br />
OR BETTER QUALITY AND FOR LOWER COST, THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES<br />
HAVE HAD TO EXAMINE CLOSELY THE KINDS OF ACTIVITY IN WHICH THEY<br />
ENGAGE. FOR MANY WORKERS AND MANAGEMENTS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD THAT<br />
HAS MEANT QUITE RADICAL CHANGES IN THEIR WORK PATTERNS. AT<br />
TIMES INDIVIDUAL ECONOMIES HAVE RESISTED THE NECESSARY CHANGESAND<br />
HAVE CHOSEN TO SHELTER FROM THE EMERGING PRESSURES. INDEED<br />
IN SOME AREAS MOST RECENTLY AGRICULTURE THE TENDENCY HAS BEEN </p>
<p>TO RAISE THESE WALLS RATHER THAN REDUCE THEM.<br />
IN A SENSE THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FACTOR IN HUMAN BEHAVIOURTHE<br />
CORN LAWS OF SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND<br />
HAVE HAD MANY PRECURSORS AND DESCENDANTS. BUT INCREASINGLY WE<br />
IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD ARE COMING TO REALISE THE COSTS NOT ONLY<br />
TO THE WORLD ECONOMY BUT ALSO TO OURSELVES OF SEEKING SHARPLY<br />
TO DENY OURSELVES THE BENEFITS OF GOODS PRODUCED MORE CHEAPLY BY<br />
OTHERS. WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THE PACE AT WHICH THAT RECOGNITION<br />
CAN AFFECT OUR ACTIONS IN TRADING RELATIONSHIPS DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON<br />
HOW QUICKLY OUR SOCIETIES ARE WILLING TO ADAPT.<br />
ONE RELATED DEVELOPMENT, IS THE EMERGENCE OF " POST-INDUSTRIALI SATION"<br />
PROBLEMS IN SOME DEVELOPED COUNTRIES SUCH As BRITAIN. IN THESE<br />
CASES THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED SLOWDOWN IN THE RATES OF PRODUCTIVITY<br />
GROWTH AND MAJOR SHIFTS IN EMPLOYMENT PATTERNS.<br />
OLD SECTORS SUCH AS TEXTILES, IRON AND STEEL MAKING AND SHIPBUILDING<br />
HAVE BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED, WHILE NEW SECTORS NOTABLY HIGH<br />
TECHNOLOGY, SOPHISTICATED BANKING AND INSURANCE SERVICES HAVE<br />
GROWN AT FANTASTIC RATES.<br />
IF WE ARE TO BEGIN TO COPE WITH AND MANAGE CHANGE OF THE DIMENSIONS<br />
I HAVE OUTLINED THEN MAY I SUGGEST, HUMBLY, THAT CERTAIN THINGS<br />
ARE ALMOST SELF-EVIDENTLY NECESSARY.<br />
HAVING RECOGNISED THE FACT AND ACCELERATING RATE OF CHANGE,<br />
WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF IT. THAT INFINITELY MARVELLOUS MECHANISM,<br />
THE HUMAN MIND, WHICH CONTINUALLY AMAZES US WITH ITS CAPACITY FOR<br />
TRIUMPHS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ENGINEERING HAS, IF WE WISH TO HARNESS ITP </p>
<p>8<br />
THE SAME CAPACITY FOR GENIUS IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING.<br />
IF WE ARE TO STRIVE FOR THAT SYMMETRY THEN WE MUST RECOGNISE WHAT<br />
ARE THE CONSTANTS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND SO IDENTIFY THE BUILDING<br />
BLOCKS FOR A PROGRAM OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING TO MATCH THE CHALLENGE OF<br />
OUR TIMES. THE RELEVANT CONSTANTS FOR OUR PURPOSES WOULD SEEM TO BE<br />
A) MEN AND WOMEN WILL SEEK TO ACHIEVE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE<br />
STANDARD AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE<br />
DEPENDENT UPON THEM<br />
B) THEY WILL SHAPE THESE ASPIRATIONS ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND<br />
ATTITUDES OF A PAST ENVIRONMENT<br />
c) THEY WILL NOT NORMALLY IDENTIFY THEIR CAPACITY TO SATISFY<br />
THOSE ASPIRATIONS WITH OTHERS BEYOND THEIR OWN ORGANISATIONAL<br />
GROUPING IN THE ECONOMY<br />
I DO NOT PRETEND THAT THIS IS AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST BUT I BELIEVE IT<br />
IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSES.<br />
IT MEANS THAT WE WHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY IN GOVERNMENT, IN THE TRADE<br />
UNIONS, AS EMPLOYERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN ORGANISATIONS, SHOULD<br />
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEGITIMACY OF THIS ASPIRATION FOR<br />
AN IMPROVED STANDARD AND QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR THE FACTS OF OUR<br />
EXPERIENCE, AND AN INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE, CAN NOT<br />
DENY IT.<br />
THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NOT REQUIRE A PAUSE FROM<br />
THE PROCESS OF IMPROVEMENT -INDEED SUCH A PAUSE MAY BE THE VERY<br />
CONDITION FOR ENSURING SUBSEQUENT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN STANDARDS. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, IF AGAINST ALL THE EVIDENCE, WE DENY OR SEEK BLINDLY TO<br />
FRUSTRATE THESE ASPIRATIONS WE WILL, AS SOCIETIES, IN FACT BE<br />
DIMINISHED BY THE FORCES OF CHANGE WHICH MAKE SUCH IMPROVED STANDARDS<br />
POSSIBLE. THE NEXT IMPLICATION FOR US FROM OUR LIST IS THAT WE MUST CONSTANTLY<br />
AND ASSIDUOUSLY ATTEMPT TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY, AND ITS IMPORTANT<br />
CONSTITUENT ORGANISATIONS, INFORMED ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF CHANGE IN<br />
OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. WHAT MAY<br />
HAVE BEEN AN APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTION OR ATTITUDE IN SHAPING YOUR<br />
ASPIRATIONS EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO MAY BE QUITE INAPPROPRIATE TODAY.<br />
IF YOU WERE A MONOPOLY OR A VERY SUBSTANTIAL SUPPLIER OF A<br />
NON-SUBSTITUTABLE COMMODITY IN STRONG INTERNATIONAL DEMANII THEN<br />
THAT FACT WOULD HAVE INFORMED THE THINKING AND THE DEMANDS OF THOSE<br />
ENGAGED IN THAT INDUSTRY. WAE ALL KNOW HOW RAPIDLY THAT TYPE OF<br />
SITUATION CAN AND HAS BEEN CHANGING. IT IS NO GOOD BEMOANING OUTOF-<br />
DATE ATTITUDES IF UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION IS NOT DISSEMINATED.<br />
IN MY OWN COUNTRY, WE WERE ABLE IN THE POST WAR PERIOD TO BUILD<br />
UP A GROWING MANUFACTURING SECTOR, ABSORBING A MASSIVE IMMIGRATION<br />
INTAKE, BEHIND A HIGH PROTECTIVE APPARATUS OF TARIFFS AND QUOTAS.<br />
iA HUNGRY WORLD AND A EUROPE DEVASTATED BY WAR PAID HIGH PRICES<br />
FOR THE PRODUCE OF OUR EFFICIENT PRIMARY INDUSTRY. THIS WAS SOON<br />
SUPPLEMENTED BY THE INITIAL BOOM IN OUR VASTLY EXPANDED EXTRACT IVE<br />
INDUSTRIES.<br />
THAT PICTURE HAS CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION. EUROPE, THE LARGEST<br />
IMPORTER OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HAS NOW BECOME, IN PRODUCT AFTER<br />
PRODUCT, THE LARGEST PRODUCER AND EXPORTER AS A RESULT OF MASSIVE<br />
SUBSIDIES UNDER ITS COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. </p>
<p>IN THE AREA OF MINERALS A COMBINATION OF MASSIVE NEW SUPPLIERS AND<br />
PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE ASSUMPTIONS AND<br />
REALITIES OF THE PAST.<br />
IF WE IN AUSTRALIA ARE EFFECTIVELY TO MANAGE CHANGE, IF WE ARE TO<br />
HARNESS AND DIRECT THE ENORMOUS CAPACITIES WE HAVE TO GROW IN AND<br />
WITH OUR REGIONTHEN OUR PEOPLE, AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS, MUST BE<br />
INFORMED OF AND COME TO UNDERSTAND THESE AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL<br />
CHANGES SHAPING THE NEW ENVIRONMENT WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.<br />
THE PACE OF CHANGE IS SO FRENETIC, IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT IT IS<br />
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCHARGE THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THE<br />
COMMUNITY. IT IS TRUE THAT THE RATE OF CHANGE CREATES ITS OWN<br />
PROBLEMS. IT ALSO PROVIDES ITS OWN INSTRUMENTS. NEVER BEFORE<br />
HAS SOCIETY HAD AVAILABLE TO IT SUCH A RANGE OF INSTRUMENTS FOR ITS<br />
OWN INFORMATION. IT IS FOR ALL OF US I HAVE MENTIONED WITH SUCH<br />
RESPONSIBILITY, TO USE THESE INSTRUMENTS, DEMOCRATICALLY, SO THAT<br />
WE SHALL HAVE, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, A COMMUNITY SHAPING ITS ASPIRATIONS,<br />
FORMING ITS ATTITUDES ON THE MOST RELEVANT AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION<br />
BASE. THE FINAL, AND IN MANY SENSES, THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPLICATION FROM<br />
OUR LIST IS THE NEED TO FOSTER SOME COMMUNITY OF INTEREST AND PURPOSE<br />
IN OUR SOCIETIES. IT SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE THAT THE DESIRES OF WORKERS<br />
FOR IMPROVED STANDARDS AND OF EMPLOYERS FOR IMPROVED PROFIT ARE<br />
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OR ANTAGONISTIC.<br />
RATHER THE INDISPUTABLE TRUTH IS THAT BOTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE<br />
THEIR LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS BY ATTEMPTING TO ARRIVE AT SOME SHARED<br />
PERCEPTIONS AS TO HOW TO OPTIMISE ECONOMIC GROWTH. </p>
<p>11<br />
No UNIFORM PRESCRIPTION CAN BE GIVEN FOR THIS PROCESS. WHAT WE<br />
ARE SEEKING, I BELIEVE WITH QUITE SOME SUCCESS, TO DO IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE IN THE CULTURE AND TRADITIONS OF<br />
ANOTHER. BUT I DO ASSERT THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN FRAMEWORKS, THE APPROPRIATE<br />
MECHANISMS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED TO SEEK WHAT DEGREE OF CO-OPERATION IS<br />
POSSIBLE. THE NEW INVESTMENT, WHATEVER ITS MATERIAL FORM, HAS NO<br />
IDEOLOGY, NO PREJUDICE. ITS OPTIMUM CAPACITY TO HELP PRODUCE<br />
GOODS OR SERVICES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO INVEST IN IT AND THOSE<br />
WHO WORK WITH IT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE MEASURE OF THEIR<br />
INTELLIGENT AND RATIONAL CO-OPERATION. TO DO THAT MAKES SENSE IN ANY<br />
SOCIETY. MAY I MAKE TWO POINTS IN CONCLUSION.<br />
FIRST, I HAVE FROM NECESSITY SPOKEN FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE<br />
AS A CITIZEN OF A DEVELOPED COUNTRY. I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE<br />
AND PRIVILEGE FIRST AS LEADER OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AND NOW<br />
AS PRIME MINISTER TO COME TO KNOW MY COUNTRY WELL, AND IF YOU WILL<br />
PERMIT ME, TO LOVE IT DEEPLY.<br />
I THINK I KNOW ITS STRENGTHS AND ITS WEAKNESSES AS WELL AS ANYBODY.<br />
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT SAY THAT WE ARE A MIRROR IMAGE FOR ANY OTHER<br />
PEOPLE AND I GUESS SOME FROM ABROAD WOULD SAY THEY ARE GRATEFUL<br />
FOR THAT. </p>
<p>BUT I DO BELIEVE, THAT THE CONSTANTS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR TO WHICH<br />
I HAVE REFERRED TRANSCEND NATIONAL BOUNDARIES, CULTURAL TRADITIONS<br />
AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS, AND I DO BELIEVE THAT, PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD<br />
AND BUILT UPON THEY DO OFFER A BASIS FOR OPTIMISM IN ANY COUNTRY<br />
THAT WE CAN AS INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEINGS PROVIDE THAT SYMMETRY OF<br />
SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL GENIUS,<br />
FINALLY, I BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF PEACE, IF THERE IS ONE CHANGE ABOVE ALL<br />
OTHERS THAT DISTINGUISHES THIS AGE FROM ANY OTHER IT IS THE CAPACITY<br />
WE HAVE CREATED TO OBLITERATE LIFE FROM THIS PLANET,<br />
EVERY OTHER EFFORT WE MAKE TO MANAGE CHANGE IN AN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY,<br />
WILL HAVE BEEN POINTLESS AND THE ULTIMATE INSULT TO THE HUMAN<br />
INTELLIGENCE, IF WE DO NOT AS NATIONS BEND OUR BEST EFFORTS TO THE<br />
GRADUAL, MUTUAL, VERIFIABLE REDUCTION AND THEN THE ELIMINATION OF<br />
THE ACCUMULATED NUCLEAR ARSENALS OF THIS WORLD, </p>
