JJ, AUST AL1Ag. PRESS STATEMENT NO. 398<br />
6 December 1974<br />
TEXTILE FLOOR COVERINGS REFERENCE TO THE TEXTILES AUTHORITY<br />
OF THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlan, announced today that<br />
he had sent a reference to the Textiles Authority within the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission covering certain textile<br />
floor coverings. Mr. Whitlam said that this action was being<br />
taken as a result of high and rising levels of imports and an<br />
apparent total availability of such goods on the Australian<br />
market in excess of previous levels.<br />
The reference seeks the advice of the Authority on whether<br />
action should be taken in terms of the GATT Textiles Arrangement,<br />
to which Australia acceded earlier this year, to restrain imports<br />
into Australia. The Authority has also been asked that if it is.<br />
found that restraint measures are necessary and that measures which<br />
may be recommended in accordance with the GATT Textiles Arrangement<br />
are unlikely to overcome the market disruption, what other measures,<br />
if any, should be taken to overcome the disruption. The Authority<br />
has been requested to make its report by 28 February 1975 on the<br />
goods covered by the reference.<br />
The Prime Minister emphasised that the questions of whether<br />
it would be necessary to have negotiations on the goods in question<br />
with exporting countries or take other action would have to await<br />
examination of the recommendations of the Textiles Authority.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that, although it is not clear to the<br />
Government at this stage that action on goods covered by this<br />
latest reference is necessary, he considered it important that<br />
the Government be able to take the initiative in having<br />
investigations undertaken so that action can be taken promptly<br />
if found necessary. </p>
