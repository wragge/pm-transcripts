WUiSY COLLNCINTAR WfILDINO FM~ l<br />
APfLAL DIIIRNEID AT XMBOURNE<br />
ON1 22ND * EUMAUB, 1963<br />
IRMA h hePrz Kinisar. the Ut ba. 1. G. fieae<br />
Bir, and ladies and Gentlemen*<br />
It is very seldom that me. enecunters a Chairman<br />
who, is a Professor in Thoo. g in one of Its branches and who<br />
pos mesgs ayour gay sense of humur, Be turn~ s to so, after<br />
really loading me with undserved praise and then he says<br />
* New, you are he" e as an old boy. I want you to " elax. fs<br />
get up and make a speeah.' ( laughter)<br />
Wll Sir, I don't proeto make a very long on*<br />
becauset In the frat place I a whet you have been<br />
say" Iveythi ou sail about rils'wt right. Most of<br />
tg ousi about me were olrih. It was very<br />
deeent of you to sympathise with people like myself for idering<br />
vilaiomas and violent attacks from time to time. I want<br />
to mkte qiteclear that this represents novirtue on my<br />
part. I like them, ( Laughter) The great secret of politics<br />
is to bae a somewhat low blood prelires CA aTtka It<br />
and the result Is that when ;; me. yd vrsa tac n<br />
boome V&amp; y &amp; Az~ yed my blood pressure, becomes normal, ( Laughter)<br />
I find this a singular Odfantage.<br />
Sirs, the great thin that always oases into m<br />
mind en Gag of the" e oeaions is thisl that back In 47<br />
ist af ter the war, at a tim beore Nenxtes and Hiolt and when<br />
hew income tax was very, very high in Austvalia ( Laughter) I<br />
remember saying to myself, ' w will these ret public ; os<br />
survive?' It seemed to se a fair question toput to oneself...<br />
High taxes inevitably ' Nw will these schools which are, bound<br />
to becme moeand more -Iveaasv no" e and more justice Is<br />
dene to teachers and no" e sads are made upon the ptets of<br />
children how can they survival Will we fMn ourselves losing,<br />
will we find ourselves practising that dreadful civic vie of<br />
mifoiity for which we have suck a passion in Australia?'<br />
1 late maiformity. We must have individuliem in our sabools,<br />
in evrthn in our lives if we are to go on, and how are we<br />
going thocontinue. And the great thing that has struck so<br />
year after year, has been that in spite of all the diffiuties<br />
every school I know of has gone on and an and has got biggeran<br />
stronger-, year after year, with waiting lists with parents<br />
nxious to accept the financial burdens in ; orr to get the<br />
advantages for their children. of what awes on In these schOols.<br />
This, I think, is a moderm revolution and I confess to you that<br />
fifteen years ago I did not expect It for one mment, brat I an<br />
delighted to have been wrong.<br />
I remember when I was at Wesley, as obscure a child<br />
as ever went through it5 we had A total poUlation. of about<br />
250 a few fellw like 0ordon Hattam and LmS elleek, they<br />
can correct no but I think I an right about 250, And I remember<br />
that the then eadmstmr, to whom I " efor respectfuy as Dicky<br />
Adeason, saying in that gwrmbling voice of his, not always 60.8<br />
to mW~ rstand, except whe n it was saing something unpleasant,<br />
( laugIrherm) embr h'm " Itrust the school will<br />
never rise beyond 300. That's enough.' And now, what am I told </p>
<p>ths way and that way 960 And of aours. the pric, that you<br />
tfyA developing a school within a limited area or pround<br />
those enormous proportions is that you mast divido, you<br />
must develop the junior school, you mast develop various astect<br />
of the school you must move out and got nov its you u<br />
ereet now buildings and Sir all this, as no doubt we will be<br />
told toni ght, will repr~ esent a challenge in particular to every<br />
old bay of Wesay. A groat chall1enge.<br />
In fact, when I ease In here tonight and looked<br />
around and my wife said to as OHave you ever had to speak at<br />
as big a Dinner as this . in 144zo; or somewhere?' I said, ' Well,<br />
I would doubt It. Maybe ones, I don't know, but I would doubt it. N<br />
But I do may nov that the remarkable thing about this Dinner Is<br />
that you have, 1,000 people he" e who all eawe along quite willingly,<br />
no pressed men all volunteers -you didn't gam along to hear<br />
so you cam ln to have it taken out of you. ( Laughter)<br />
This I think is agnifiest Wb. ver Is the Chairman of the<br />
Appeal financially, I say, " Look at them willing aid anxious."<br />
I thnk tisVi a peat spectacle I can unestanid It in the<br />
case of the Pres= 1era like Myselfg but as for the rest of<br />
you ( Laughter4 It will remain a big mystery. A deep mstery.<br />
Sir I an not ping to keep you, but I want to<br />
say this* Iniid; Zity I referred to It a little wile ap<br />
is of the essene of orideals of public schools and In<br />
particular for our own school. This business of during to be<br />
viseo this business of setting out to achieveo utter intelleal<br />
Integrity and the development of haman character and the Individual<br />
character, this is not just a form of wrds* This is *=* ething<br />
that ean be achieved bF a preat school and lost Or a bad aw<br />
and we &amp; arev ery proud to say 1 k: bak am the record of our<br />
sebsolo that It Sa ay, I us~ 1y that it has sent out<br />
into the vorld in Matralia and a dj W many men vhs have<br />
really achieved intelleetual Integpity, who have really folled<br />
out the motto of the sehool, not in a priggish iny nothing<br />
could be no" s boring; met In a pompous ways nothing could be<br />
no" detestable, but in a simple straightforwrd, manly fashion,<br />
And that is why Wesley is a great school and that really is<br />
why 1,000 people have Oue be tonight to think about it, to<br />
talk about It,, to be talked to about It and I an delighted to<br />
have had the oppeatunty of being one of them. o<br />
I woaqLar what Harold Stewart thought wa he was<br />
sitting in his Reemaster's study ma the lieholas brothers<br />
walked in. This mat be an experienoe that somes to few<br />
boadma sters. Fanq two mo% simle splni people, owing in<br />
and saying, ' Good morning. FWsmater my wetaeast?<br />
And theni sayin " ejut a little trifling matter . we would<br />
like to do someth a the geaftster pricaks up his ears<br />
even Harold 0Stewrt, that wonderful man Who taught 100 threequarters<br />
of what I know even Harold Stewa)' t must have thOUghkt<br />
to himslf, ' Ah. wells perhaps YOU know We Might be able to<br />
build a wing." 1 And out it games. This was a marvelloas thing.<br />
And every old Wesley ellegiaxi was delighted to hear about it*<br />
Bat if I my say so we have perhaps lived too long<br />
am the menwry of it. They were to men we a" e numeered in our<br />
thosns and if we Ow anything to this great schDol, as we<br />
then perhps the tine has come to disob~ r g ame part of the debts<br />
That's how I feel about it. I haven't = eue my emotions into<br />
pem~, sillings and pemee, hwever,, but not doubt with you aid<br />
I will, ( Laughter) in due course. Bat that's the real question<br />
* What are we going to do about It?" and this is not just a matter<br />
of raising money for future developmet, it is a continuing matter<br />
of what I will Gall o" actical pride" in the school . that we handed<br />
on* And, Sir, in that mood and with those words, I would<br />
like everybody to rise anid drink the toast of the school. </p>
