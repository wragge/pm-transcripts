Interview with Laurie Power of 0/ 10 Network<br />
14 April 1978<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser what is your approach to Mr Fukuda?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't be discussing bilateral Australia-<br />
Japan matters, because these have been covered by Mr Anthony,<br />
and indeed the normal Ministerial talks between Japan and<br />
Australia will be resuming in late June when a team of<br />
Japanese Ministers will be coming here. The Japanese<br />
Prime Minister and myself will be discussing the wider<br />
world economic issues and trade issues, because there are<br />
a number of important international forums taking place this<br />
year, multinational trade negotiations and UNCTAD meetings,<br />
which involve the North-South problems, developing world<br />
problems, and with the State of world trade it's going to<br />
be very important that the right decisions be made. We have<br />
got to get the world moving, towards an expansion of markets,<br />
an expansion of trade, otherwise I think there's going to be<br />
increasing protection, and I think especially from Europe,<br />
as people fight for a larger share of existing markets, and<br />
that could have very serious consequences for a number of<br />
nations. And I believe there needs to be a new momentum and<br />
new commitment on the part of many nations, to explore every<br />
avenue every possibility of getting world trade moving,<br />
expanding world markets, because that's going to ultimately<br />
be the only way that we can provide markets for the products<br />
from our farms and our factories and our mines, and when<br />
I say " our" I don't just mean Australia. It's going to be<br />
the only way in which there can be a full and sustained<br />
reduction of unemployment around the world.<br />
QUESTION: Is that your approach that Austalia's position will<br />
improve relatively if you can get a better world trading situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If there is a better world trading situation,<br />
of course that will help us enormously in our own economic<br />
recovery. We're greatly dependent upon world trade, as I think<br />
every Australian knows. But there are things we can do on our<br />
own account, but at the same time we are greatly affected by<br />
what happens overseas.<br />
QUESTION: You won't be mentioning the prospects of trade<br />
or things of that nature at this time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. When I approached Prime Minister Fukuda<br />
I said that I wanted this matter to be on the major economic<br />
issues that affect all of us, and he later on is going to the<br />
United States, I've been asked to the Manley meeting in<br />
Jamaica at the end of May, which again is motivated out of<br />
the very same concerns that I've just expressed to you, and<br />
the Manley meeting,-as a result of the Jamaican-German initiative<br />
is I think the first time there'll be an informal meeting of<br />
Heads of Government between developed and develop ing countries. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now when you get to the formal discussions, countries tend<br />
to go there with fixed positions, hard negotiating minds, and<br />
the purpose of informal discussions, I believe, is to try and<br />
find a way through. If we get to the situation in the next<br />
three or four or five months where there isn't progress made<br />
at MTN, no progress made at UNCTAD, there will be increasing<br />
bitterness amongst developed nations, between developed and<br />
developing. I think under those circumstances there would be<br />
much greater world protectionism again particularly from<br />
Europe, and under those circumstances the world would end<br />
the year in a pretty unhappy situation.<br />
QUESTION: One final brief point. Would you hope though that<br />
your discussions, or first meeting, with Mr Fukuda as the<br />
Prime Minister, Prime Minister, will ultimately help Australia's<br />
relationship with Japan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I would hope so. I believe we have a<br />
very good relationship, and I was asked yesterday why are<br />
you discussing these matters first of all with the Prime<br />
Minister of Japan? I think the reason is very clear. We both<br />
live in the Pacific, we have a very significant trading<br />
relationship, we're both very significantly affected by what<br />
happens in the wider world scene, and I think that we both<br />
share these concerns, but I'll be exploring that in this<br />
coming week and identifying avenues of common interest to<br />
see if we can't independently or jointly contribute towards<br />
better solutions throughout the course of this year. </p>
