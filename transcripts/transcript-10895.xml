    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much to Rob Borbidge, the Premier</p>
<p>   of Queensland, to Joan Sheldon, the Deputy Premier and Treasurer,</p>
<p>   to John Moore, my federal Ministerial colleague, other Ministers,</p>
<p>   the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, members of the Brisbane</p>
<p>   City Council, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>As you are aware, one of the objectives that my</p>
<p>   Government has had over the last couple of years is to make certain</p>
<p>   that the foundations of the Australian economy are strong, to make</p>
<p>   certain that we are seen throughout the world as being a strong,</p>
<p>   reliable country economically in which inflation is low and in which</p>
<p>   the business investment climate is extremely attractive.</p>
<p>Now that has, of necessity, involved us taking</p>
<p>   over that two year period a number of decision which have sought</p>
<p>   to reduce our public spending and to get our budget deficit which</p>
<p>   we found to be $10.5 billion back into surplus. We have done a very</p>
<p>   good job along that path and I hope that in the next federal budget</p>
<p>   it will be possible for our Treasurer to announce a budget surplus</p>
<p>   with will represent a major turnaround in such a short period of</p>
<p>   time.</p>
<p>But that hasn't been an end in itself. When</p>
<p>   you embark upon a programme of getting the books in order of fiscal</p>
<p>   consolidation as the boffins call it, or simply reducing the deficit</p>
<p>   as we call it, when you embark upon that sort of programme, it's</p>
<p>   not just end in itself. You also get a benefit from it. It is something</p>
<p>   that I call a social bonus. You get something out of sensible economic</p>
<p>   decision making, you give yourself the capacity further down the</p>
<p>   track to do things in a directed, intelligent, measured way that</p>
<p>   you want to do for the long-term benefit of the country.</p>
<p>And one of the social bonuses to come out of our</p>
<p>   expenditure restraint and other decisions that we took, was the</p>
<p>   capacity we had to announce in the last federal budget the establishment</p>
<p>   of a Federation Fund of $1 billion. And that was designed principally</p>
<p>   to fund the development of major infrastructure projects all around</p>
<p>   Australia, to mark the federation of Australia, the Centenary of</p>
<p>   Federation in the year 2001, to generate jobs in the construction</p>
<p>   phase of those projects, and to leave the future generations a lasting,</p>
<p>   practical memorial of one hundred years of the federation of the</p>
<p>   six Australian colonies into the nation of Australia in 1901. And</p>
<p>   as a result of that Fund being created, as part of the social bonus,</p>
<p>   what we have already announced is a commitment of funds to the Darwin</p>
<p>   to Alice Springs railway, a commitment to the National Gallery of</p>
<p>   Victoria, a commitment to building that major infrastructure project</p>
<p>   at Jervoise Bay in Western Australia which will support the oil</p>
<p>   and gas export industries of Western Australia which are so important,</p>
<p>   not only to our country, but also to the state of Western Australia.</p>
<p>And I am pleased to announce today that we will</p>
<p>   be committing out of that Federation Fund a sum of $65 million towards</p>
<p>   the Light Rail Project which was announced by the Premier of Queensland</p>
<p>   in November of last year. I share all of the enthusiasm of both</p>
<p>   the Premier and the Treasurer for the Briztram project. I share</p>
<p>   all of his belief that it will be a visionary transport project</p>
<p>   that will tap the heritage values of Brisbane. Just three quarter</p>
<p>   of an hour ago, I had the opportunity of talking to a number of</p>
<p>   the diplomatic visitors we have at our Liberal Party convention</p>
<p>   here in Brisbane, and I was talking about the different cities of</p>
<p>   Australia, and I made the observation that I have now been in politics</p>
<p>   since 1974 and in that almost 24 years that I have been in politics,</p>
<p>   of all of the great cities of Australia, none has been more dramatically</p>
<p>   transformed in that 24 year period than the city of Brisbane.</p>
<p>I can still recognise the other cities, and I recognise</p>
<p>   some of the old values of Brisbane as well. It still retains some</p>
<p>   great deposits of its earlier years, but it really has been transformed</p>
<p>   into a modern, attractive, dynamic diverse city. And it needs, part</p>
<p>   of that transformation, it needs infrastructure, it needs long term</p>
<p>   planning, it needs an adequate transport network and this project</p>
<p>   will help to give it that. And that is why it is a project that</p>
<p>   admirably fits the bill so far as Federation funding is concerned.</p>
<p>   It is precisely this sort of project that the Federation funding</p>
<p>   was designed to augment. And it will create the jobs, it will provide</p>
<p>   the linkages between communities. And in every respect it does fit</p>
<p>   the bill.</p>
<p>And can I say to you, Mr Premier, and to you, Joan,</p>
<p>   as the Treasurer of the state of Queensland, that I have an enormous</p>
<p>   respect for the commitment you have for the development, not only</p>
<p>   of Brisbane, but also to the development of the state of Queensland.</p>
<p>   You are both great Queenslanders and you are also very loyal partners</p>
<p>   with myself and our other heads of government in the future long</p>
<p>   term development of our country.</p>
<p>But you do understand the particular needs of Brisbane,</p>
<p>   and the particular needs of Queensland. You are fathers for the</p>
<p>   mining industry of this state, you have stood up for the interests</p>
<p>   of Queensland in promoting the need for a sensible outcome to the</p>
<p>   difficult problem of Native Title. You know the value to Queensland</p>
<p>   of the jobs and investment that will be involved in settling the</p>
<p>   difficulties involved in that legislation. You also understand the</p>
<p>   importance of small business in the life of Queensland and you also</p>
<p>   understand that in the 1990s government, in the 1990s the kind of</p>
<p>   society we want could only ever be created through a shared endeavour</p>
<p>   which involves a partnership between the government, the community</p>
<p>   and the individual. The Government can't do everything on its</p>
<p>   own. But it's got to help and it's got to provide leadership</p>
<p>   and it's got to provide facilitation and this project really</p>
<p>   does epitomise that and epitomise it very well.</p>
<p>So I congratulate you, Mr Premier and Deputy Premier</p>
<p>   and I congratulate the Government of Queensland on this visionary</p>
<p>   project. I'm delighted to associate my Government with it in</p>
<p>   a practical way. And that, of course, won't be the end of federation</p>
<p>   funding support for the State of Queensland.</p>
<p>This project was number one on the priority list</p>
<p>   given to me by the Premier of Queensland. There are other projects</p>
<p>   and of that more will be said at an appropriate time. But we are</p>
<p>   working very closely with the Government of Queensland. We share</p>
<p>   a vision about the future of this State and, of course, as part</p>
<p>   of that, a vision about the future of the entire country.</p>
<p>But can I just diverge from the project and just</p>
<p>   say one other thing. And I think it is important that I say it as</p>
<p>   the very proud patron of the great St George Rugby League Club.</p>
<p>   Can I say how delighted I am that the, at times vigorous and spirited</p>
<p>   but I think at all times rather tragic tribal war that racked the</p>
<p>   great game of rugby league, now appears to have come to an end.</p>
<p>   The armistice will be consummated at Lang Park tonight and appropriately</p>
<p>   enough between Manly and the Brisbane Broncos. And given my loyalties</p>
<p>   and given the fact that I am a leader for all of the Australian</p>
<p>   people, I shall not choose, I shall not gain to express a preference</p>
<p>   for the outcome. But the real winner of that clash tonight will</p>
<p>   be the followers and lovers of rugby league and the many Australians,</p>
<p>   whether here in Queensland or in Sydney or elsewhere, were devastated</p>
<p>   by the tribal war that went on for a number of years. I think it</p>
<p>   is a wonderful thing and it's been settled in, I hope, a lasting</p>
<p>   fashion. I wish the game well and I hope it is well supported. </p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, again, my congratulations</p>
<p>   to the Premier of Queensland, to his Government for their vision</p>
<p>   and their foresight and their commitment to the development of Brisbane</p>
<p>   and the development of the State of Queensland. And I'm delighted</p>
<p>   to lend my Government's support to the tune of $65 million</p>
<p>   out of the Federation Fund. We look forward to further cooperative</p>
<p>   endeavour in the months ahead. Thank you.</p>
