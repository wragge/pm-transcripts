JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISrERs THE IION P J KEATING MP<br />
AND THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA, THE HON J G KENNETT MLA<br />
The Prime Minter and the Treasurer met tonight with the Premier and thc Treasurer of'<br />
Victoria to discusg Victoria's budgetary and debt position.<br />
Following a constructive discussion, both Governments agreed upon the need to satisfy<br />
the Loan Council that a sustainable long-term strategy is in place to address Victoria's<br />
budgetary and debt difficulties. With that in mind, the Commonwealth Government is<br />
willing to support, in principle, a Victorian approach to Loan Council seeking $ 1.6 billion<br />
of special addition to this year's Global Limit in order to finance the 1992-93 budget.<br />
Victoria prescntod a medium term financial strategy to the mecting. The Commonwealth<br />
and Victorian Governments will work together to further refine that strategy prior to a<br />
special Loan Council mceting in December.<br />
it is expected that this examination will be succssfully concluded during the course of the<br />
next four weeks. The consultations to date provide cause for confidence that Victoria's<br />
problems can bc satisfactorily rcsolved.<br />
Arising from thc meeting's discussion of the steps already taken and those in prospect, the<br />
Conmmoniwealth Government has agrecd to recommend to Loan Council a special addition<br />
to Victoria's Global Limits of $ 1,267 million to regularise Victoria's relationship with<br />
Loan Council. That special addition would be in respect of the borrowings. undertaken in<br />
May or this year to refinance previous short-term borrowingq used to finance budget<br />
deficits in that year and in the preceding two years. Victoria accepts that these borrowings<br />
undertaken by the previous Victorian Government require Loan Council approval.<br />
Both Governments were of the view that it was important that stability be restored to<br />
financial markets by focussing on the task of restoring Victoria's budgetary position and<br />
avoiding a continuation of the potentially damaging public debate of recent days.<br />
