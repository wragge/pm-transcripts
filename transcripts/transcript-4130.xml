PRIME MINISTER<br />
COMMONWEALTH SENIOR OFFICIALS MEETING<br />
26 MAY 1976<br />
. I am glad to have this opportunity to welcome you to Canberra and<br />
to formally open your Meeting. This is the first " Commonwealth<br />
of Nations" Meeting I have attended as Prime Minister. I would like<br />
. therefore, to take this opportunity of stating Australia's attitude<br />
towards the Commonwealth.<br />
In the early months of office, the Government in Australia has been<br />
very much occupied with events in our own part of the world, and<br />
by our own domestic economic problems. This meeting now provides<br />
a welcome opportunity to emphasise Australia's continued support for<br />
the Commonwealth of Nations. I am a firm believer in the concept<br />
. of today's Commonwealth, and my Government will continue to cooperate<br />
wholeheartedly in Commonwealth activities.<br />
91 am very pleased that Australia is providing the location for this<br />
meeting. This is the first time that the Commonwealth has gathered<br />
at this level, in these numbers, in the Southern Hemisphere, even<br />
though one third of the Commonwealth's members come from this side of<br />
the world. The Commonwealth has now become a substantive international<br />
organisation. It is no longer a mere " ghost of Empire".<br />
It is a voluntary association of independent countries who continue<br />
to belong to the Commonwealth not out of sentimentality but for<br />
sound practical reasons. In a world where there is a growing tendency<br />
for nations to bemore and more involved in the affairs of their own<br />
region, the Commonwealth provides a useful and valuable bridge between<br />
regions. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The growing regional involvement of members if anything, has<br />
increased the value of discussions in Commonwealth forums by<br />
broadening the perspective of members on world issues. In our<br />
own region, Australia is developing a broader set of relations<br />
with the nations of the Pacific and South East Asia.<br />
Other Commonwealth countries are likewise developing closer links<br />
with their regional neighbours. Britain herself has, of course.,<br />
become more closely involved in the affairs of Europe through her<br />
membership of the European economic community. Before Britain joined<br />
the Common Market she claimed her entry would be a great advantage to<br />
the Commonwealth: a Britain revitalised and strengthened by<br />
participating in the Common Market would be able to play a more<br />
influential and constructive role in world affairs.<br />
We were heartened by the British vow to lead the European Economic.<br />
Community to an outward and constructive role in world affairs,<br />
away from a conception of a narrow and selfish trading bloc.<br />
Many of the Commonwealth's member nations are exporters of primary<br />
products. Although Australia must be considered a developed nation,<br />
since our main exports are primary products, our interests in this<br />
matter lie with the under-developed world.<br />
The European Economic Community whose trading strength in industria@<br />
products is second to none, advocates reduction of tariff barriers on<br />
manufactured goods. At the same time it raises barriers so artificial<br />
so immense against primary products in competition with theirs, thaO<br />
few nations can penetrate them. If the E. E. C. applied their attiurs<br />
on barriers to manufactured goods to primary products, the European<br />
nations could greatly increase their standards of living and lower<br />
their costs.<br />
We eargerly await the plain evidence of British influence in the<br />
European Economic Community which was so emphatically promised to us<br />
as a great contribution to a better and freer world.<br />
If this can happen, Britain's view that her membership of<br />
the E. E. C. will enable her to play a more constructive role in<br />
Commonwealth affairs will be validated. If it is not, the Commonwealth<br />
will not have been strengthened In other ways, the<br />
changing pattern of international relations has altered and<br />
strengthened the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
No longer are the nations of the Commonwealth linked just through<br />
Britain. Through the Commonwealth a network of relations have<br />
developed between the independent member countries. The links<br />
which have ' grown up between individual Commonwealth countries have<br />
become at least as important as the longstanding links between<br />
each and Britain. The old Empire of Five is a thing of the past.<br />
Organisations managed by, or closely associated with, the Commonwealth<br />
Secretariat, such as the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation,<br />
the Commonwealth Foundation, and the Commonwealth Youth Program<br />
to name only three, undertake effective and expanding activities.<br />
There are literally hundreds of " Commonwealth-based" organisations<br />
covering a broad range of activities one of these, the Commonwealth<br />
Telecommunications Organisation, is to hold a major Conference in<br />
Sydney in early 1977. Many of these bodies were originally established<br />
with and their subsequent development encouraged by financial<br />
and other assistance from the Commonwealth.<br />
These activities now express the importance of Commonwealth linksboth<br />
Governmental and private. They are an encouraging indicator of<br />
the vitality of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is not, and never<br />
has been, a political power bloc. And it is quite inconceivable<br />
that it could ever become one. But it can help to give the small<br />
and medium sized countries a more effective voice in world affairs.<br />
An association of small and medium sized countries from all parts of<br />
the world, many of which are also members of important regional<br />
organisations, is well placed to help in developing a stable world<br />
order that is not solely dependent on agreements between the super powers<br />
It is not part of our conception of the world that any grouping<br />
of major powers should have predominant influence over middle and<br />
smaller countries.<br />
We must seek relationships where smaller countries are free and<br />
able to pursue their needs, not a world which requires subservience<br />
to the largest powers. </p>
<p>4<br />
In particular, because it makes it easy to have sympathetic<br />
and open discussion among countries of such varying levels<br />
of economic development, the Commonwealth seems to have a<br />
special role in the search for solutions to international<br />
economic problems.<br />
This is a search which, until now, has tended to be conduced<br />
by and primarily in the interests of, the economically advanced<br />
nations. The Commonwealth brings together rich and poor nations, develope4<br />
and developing, producing and consuming, black and white,<br />
aligned and non-aligned. It is eminently suited to support<br />
constructive discussion between nations on these matters. 0<br />
There is a search for a new international economic order.<br />
The means by which this order is sought will have a large<br />
impact on its ultimate form.<br />
The Commonwealth has, in the past, served as a catalyst in<br />
important international developments, most notably the<br />
establishment of the Colombo Plan Scheme in 1950.<br />
This scheme was subsequently widened to cover the bulk of the<br />
flow of official development assistance to the countries of<br />
Asia. More recently the Commonwealth has played an important part<br />
in focussing attention and achieving action on southern<br />
African issues.<br />
It was also sought to contribute to solving the Cyprus dispute<br />
I believe it can also make a valuable contribution towards<br />
achieving a more equitable economic order. </p>
<p>The present meeting of senior officials is the most important<br />
Commonwealth meeting at sub-ministerial level.<br />
These biennial meetings which commenced in 1972 provide<br />
an important regular way of consulting between heads of<br />
government meetings.<br />
This meeting will be considering, among other things, the<br />
past and future programme of the Commonwealth Secretariat<br />
which continues to serve the. Commonwealth well under a<br />
distinguished new Secretary General.<br />
The Secretariat has played a vital part in a decade of<br />
evolution and change for the Commonwealth.<br />
I welcome the consolidation which is now taking place at<br />
the Secretariat under the leadership of the new Secretary-General.<br />
I read with interest his memorandum to the review committee,<br />
and especially endorse the sentiment of his following comments:-<br />
" As the Secretariat is the servant of all Commonwealth<br />
Governments, I must emphasise that its work programme<br />
and priorities are incapable of being developed<br />
autonomously. They must necessarily be flexible and<br />
responsive to the wishes of member Governments..."<br />
This meeting will be giving attention to a number of major<br />
world problems. It will consider how the nations of the<br />
Commonwealth acting separately and together can help to solve<br />
or amerliorate them.<br />
I am delighted to be able to welcome Papua-New Guinea to these<br />
discussions.-This is Papua-New Guinea's first attendance at<br />
a major Commonwealth meeting.<br />
I am sure we all look forward to their continuing contribution<br />
to Commonwealth meetings. </p>
<p>6<br />
This meeting will also be concerned to give some preliminary<br />
attention to arrangements for the next meeting of Commonwealth<br />
heads of Government<br />
These heads of Governments meeting have been . aptly described<br />
as the hub of Commonwealth cooperation.<br />
I am looking forward personally to taking part in the 1977 meeting<br />
in London.<br />
I would be grateful if you would inform the heads of Government<br />
whom you advise and represent that I look forward especially to<br />
establishing a cooperative relationship with them at next<br />
year's meeting.<br />
Throughout its history the Commonwealth has had the capacity<br />
to respond and change to new demands new needs.<br />
It has now attained a new maturity.<br />
The diversity among the members of the Commonwealth is a<br />
source of strength, encouraging a broad understanding and toler4<br />
of each other's problems.<br />
For nations to talk constructively with one another, and to<br />
co-operate in the solution of shared problems, an attitude<br />
of consultation and a reasoned approach to issues is essential.<br />
One of the strengths of the Commonwealth is that it encourages<br />
such an attitude.<br />
The Commonwealth may well become an increasingly worthwhile<br />
instrument for helping to attack the grave problems of poverty,<br />
disease, injustice and racial conflict which no one Government<br />
no one country can hope to solve on its own. </p>
