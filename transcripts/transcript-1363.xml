FOR PRESS<br />
66/ 41 DEVELOPiVIENT OF CHRISTiASISLAND PHOSPHATE DEPOSITS<br />
( Statement by the Minister for Territories,<br />
The Hon. C. E. Barnes, 1VIP.)<br />
A development programme designed to raise the output<br />
of phosphate on Christmas Island from its present level of<br />
780,000 tons a year to 1.6-K tons a year by 1968 had been<br />
approved by the Australian and New Zealand Governments, the<br />
Minister for Territories, Mr C. E. Barnes said today.<br />
A study of the possibility of raising annual<br />
production to more than 2.5M tons would continue, he said.<br />
Mr Barnes said that the Bureau of IMineral Resources,<br />
in collaboration with the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission,<br />
was carrying out a survey at Christmas Island to re-assess its<br />
reserves of phosphate. Although the survey was not complete a<br />
preliminary estimate was that the remaining reserves of all<br />
, grades of phosphate were at least 2001d tons. This was substantially<br />
greater than earlier estimates of reserves.<br />
The development works already approved would involve<br />
extraction of lower grade deposits of phosphate in addition to<br />
the present high grade deposits.<br />
The cost of the approved development would be<br />
approximately i<br />
The lower grade deposits had previously been regarded<br />
as unsuitable for superphosphate manufacture but recent technological<br />
and other experiments had shown -that some of these<br />
deposits of low phosphatic content could betreated to make<br />
them suitable for agricultural use.<br />
An increase in the annual production rate of Christmas<br />
Island phosphate would substantially benefit the Australian<br />
fertiliser industry and would make Australia less dependent on<br />
supplies from such overseas sources as Florida, Senegal and<br />
Togo land. Mkr Barnes said that the deposits at Christmas Island,<br />
which was a Commonwealth territory, were worked by the British<br />
Phosphate Commissioners as agents for the Charistmas Island<br />
Phosphate Commission. This Cormaission had been established<br />
: Ln 1949 by agreement between Australia and New Zealand to<br />
work the deposits for the equal benefit of the two countries.<br />
