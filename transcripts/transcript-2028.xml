FOR PRESS PM. NO. 35, 1969<br />
TOWRA POINT RULED OUT AS AIRPORT SITE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The community noise problem involved in the<br />
operation of jet aircraft in the Towra Point area would be so severe,<br />
that the Minister for Civil Aviation has advised me that he has<br />
decided to direct the Interdepartmental Committee, convened to<br />
consider the future airport needs of Sydney, to exclude this site<br />
from its consideration. While accepting that the advantages which modern<br />
aviation brings to the community as a whole are considerable, I<br />
nevertheless feel that our airport planning must avoid the imposition<br />
of an unacceptable noise burden on any particular section of the<br />
community. This I believe would be the situation if we went ahead<br />
with jet airport development at Towra Point. Accordingly, I have<br />
told the Minister for Civil Aviation that I concur in his decision not<br />
to give further consideration to possible future jet operations at<br />
Towra Point.<br />
