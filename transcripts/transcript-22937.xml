<p>E&amp;OEâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why is it not necessary to discuss petrol at COAG when it is probably the number one issue that voters are concerned about?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well itâs not on the agenda but if they want to raise it in general business at the end, thatâs fine.</p>
<p>But we only meet infrequently as a group and I would like tomorrowâs meeting to achieve something. Now youâre not going to get a resolution - we canât cut the price of crude oil by talking about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>The big challenge for all of us tomorrow is salinity and water quality. The Commonwealth has put $700 million of new money on the table â no ifs, buts, maybes, funny tricks - $700 million of new money and Iâm asking the States to match that.</p>
<p>Now if we can do that we can come out of tomorrow having reached agreement to spend between us $1.4 billion over the next few years to tackle the salinity problem and improve water quality, we will have done something thatâs of lasting benefit to the Australian people.</p>
<p>I think that is far more important than having essentially a political debate about a problem that we canât fix. Thatâs why Iâve got salinity on the agenda and I havenât got fuel pricing on the agenda. Thank you.</p>
