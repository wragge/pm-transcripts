    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Petrol prices; COAG meeting</p>
<p>E&amp;OE……………………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why is it not necessary to discuss petrol at COAG when it is probably the number one issue that voters are concerned about?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it’s not on the agenda but if they want to raise it in general business at the end, that’s fine.</p>
<p>But we only meet infrequently as a group and I would like tomorrow’s meeting to achieve something. Now you’re not going to get a resolution - we can’t cut the price of crude oil by talking about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>The big challenge for all of us tomorrow is salinity and water quality. The Commonwealth has put $700 million of new money on the table – no ifs, buts, maybes, funny tricks - $700 million of new money and I’m asking the States to match that.</p>
<p>Now if we can do that we can come out of tomorrow having reached agreement to spend between us $1.4 billion over the next few years to tackle the salinity problem and improve water quality, we will have done something that’s of lasting benefit to the Australian people.</p>
<p>I think that is far more important than having essentially a political debate about a problem that we can’t fix. That’s why I’ve got salinity on the agenda and I haven’t got fuel pricing on the agenda. Thank you.</p>
