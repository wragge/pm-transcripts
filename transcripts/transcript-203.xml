FI1 3T TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES IN BUDGET DEBATE ON<br />
THURSDAY 25TH AUGUST. 1960<br />
I was very interested in what I heard of the speech<br />
of the honorable member for Wills ( Mr. Bryant), and I was glad<br />
that he made a properly impassioned -ppe : l for instruction in<br />
the country. If I may say so, Sir, he needs a little instruction<br />
himself on the financial affairs of Australia. He took the<br />
opportunity to say something that I did not expect ever to hear<br />
from him, and that was the old bromide that if you can do it for<br />
w. r, why cannot you do it for peace? If you can do it for<br />
destruction, why. cannot you do it for instruction?<br />
The honorable gentleman knows perfectly well that you<br />
can do certain things for war, if you raise taxation to wartime<br />
levels, if you control all investment, if you ration food<br />
and supplies generally, and if you go back to all the. controls<br />
that existed in Australia very properly, in the course of the<br />
war. What he must go away and think about is rwhether he is<br />
telling us, in this year of grace, that it is the policy of the<br />
Australian Labour Party to secure enough power to do all those<br />
things once more in time of peace, It is perfectly simple. It<br />
is so simple that even the honorable member for Yarra ( Mr.<br />
Cairns) ought to understand it. If you reproduce the conditions<br />
and the powers, the circumstances and the authorities of war, of<br />
course you can do it. But is the Leader of the Opposition<br />
prepared at the next election or the one after or the one after<br />
that as long as he is sitting there to go to the people and<br />
ask them to authorize the Commonwealth Parliament to impose<br />
income tax running up to 18s 6d. in the to control investment,<br />
to control capital issues, to ration food and other coimmodities,<br />
and to reinstitute all the controls of war? I am sure that he<br />
knows, because he is an intelligent man, that unless he can<br />
reproduce the conditions, he cannot reproduce the results.<br />
Mr. Cairns:-Why do you not put up an intelligent argument?<br />
MR. MENZIES: I uas under the impression that rwhat I had said<br />
was quite intelligent, but I leave it to others to determine<br />
whether it was. My main purpose in this debate, which i shall<br />
not prolong very much<br />
Mr. Hc. rold Holt: It is hardly a debate!<br />
MIt. hiENZIES: I agree with that cojmment. My purpose is to say<br />
something about what I understood to be the case of the Opposition.<br />
I know that for unavoidable reasons, my friend the<br />
Leader of the Opposition cannot be here tonight, but I think I<br />
would be permitted to say that in the course of his speech,<br />
twhich was as remarkable for its omissions for the matters it<br />
dealt with, he seemed to me to put forward four proposals. It<br />
was nothing like a positive speech from a Leader of the<br />
Opposition. The first of his four proposals ras the admirable<br />
suggestion: " Get rid of the Honzies' Government". All I can<br />
say is that, if all the speeches made by Opposition members are<br />
like his, the people will never get rid of the Menzies<br />
Government, except by death. Mind you, that is not only a<br />
probability but a certainty, in due course. In his second<br />
proposal. he said, with a fidelity to his predecessor that I<br />
could no6 but admirc, " We ought to h.. ve the Chifley Government<br />
back again". I said to myself in the best Australian<br />
vernacular, " Too right." The 6pposition is always living in<br />
the past, never living in the present. That is what is-wrong<br />
with the Australian Labour Party. It is practising a dead<br />
philosophy with a dead collection of ideas.<br />
Mr. Ilaylen: Do not repeat yourself,<br />
Mi. MENZIES: That is all right I have to repeat everything<br />
three times to you, for the most elementary reasons. </p>
<p>0 The third proposal I have heard it at least four<br />
times-is that the right way to deal with the Budget in 1960 is<br />
to alter the Constitution to give more powers of control to the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament. Is that the best contribution that<br />
honorable members opposite can make to a Budget debate?<br />
Mr. Costa: It is the only sensible one!<br />
MR. MENZIES: I am familiar with your views on that. I am also<br />
familiar, as no doubt my friend is, with the long history of<br />
proposals to alter the Constitution. But to come along to<br />
people in 1960 and say, ih. n dealing with the Budget, that at<br />
some time in the future a Ka-thleon Mavournoen promise the<br />
Gonstitution ought to be altered<br />
Mr. Haylen: Do not become sectarian!<br />
MR. M , NZIES: If there was a Scottish proverb about MacTavish, I<br />
would use it. In his fourth proposal, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition said that we must defeat inflation. There I thought<br />
he was on good ground, but he refrained from tolling us how he<br />
would do it. To defeat inflation, to restrain it, to bring it<br />
to a halt is the supreme task of this Parliament.<br />
Mr. Pollard: You have been telling us that for ton long yoars.<br />
MR. MENZIES: Now Roggieo<br />
Mr. Pollard: You are now no further ahead than you woro when you<br />
started.<br />
MR. I. ENZIES: I apologize. Through you, Sir, I want to tell my<br />
old and esteemed friend that I have listened to him with great<br />
paticnce and great mystification fot 20 years.<br />
How does the Opposition propose to defeat inflation?<br />
4o are not told. This is the great task of this Budged, as it<br />
is of all budgets, and it is a very difficult task requiring a<br />
great deal of serious thought and a great deal of close study.<br />
How do defeat inflation while maintaining development? These<br />
are the central problems of our oconomy today. It is a very hard<br />
task and a task that can be solved only with constructive ideas.<br />
In order to deal with that real problem, let us forgot the<br />
unrealities of the Opposition casa if I may so dignify it, and<br />
look at comments of the professional expert critics. , Je<br />
have heard some of them and read some of them, end I want to say<br />
something about them. Having been left la-menting for an<br />
Opposition case, I must cast my net wider and find out what the<br />
critics aresaying elsewhere.'<br />
First, they say that there are no signs of cuts in<br />
Government spending. Those are the very words of one powerful<br />
organ. Hure we have a blissful silence on the Opposition side of<br />
the chamber, because I do not think that any Opposition member<br />
would believe that if his views were put into operation, he<br />
would not increase Governfment spending by millions, or scores of<br />
millions, or indeed, in an exuberant moment, by hundreds of<br />
. millions. The critics say that there are no signs of cuts in<br />
Govrnment spending. I want to remind the House of the facts,<br />
bcause -fa. cts have a lovely intractable quality about them.<br />
-Mr. Cairns: Is that why-you avoid-thcm?<br />
MR'. iENZIES:_-That is why I am about-to-refer to them. Tehonorable<br />
member for Yarra has never had evun a nodding<br />
acquaintance with a fact in his life.<br />
Mr. Curtin: I Don't think you like him'<br />
MR. i. ENZIES: I do not. I think he is deplorable, since you </p>
<p>ask me. I do not think you are very good, but I like you; that<br />
is the difference.<br />
Mr. Curtin: That will lose me votes at the next election.<br />
MR. MENZIES: I hope so,<br />
What are the facts? Expenditure of capital works and<br />
services in this Budget is actually down on what it was last<br />
year. It has fallen from œ 142,000,000 to œ 139,900,000. That<br />
is not very much, you may say, but it is a fall. It is worth<br />
remembering that at a time when the Commonwealth Government, in<br />
order to help the States to carry out their vastly imoortant<br />
duties in the public sector of capital investment, is doing more<br />
for the States than has ever been done for them before, we have<br />
in fact reduced expenditure on our own capital works and<br />
services. As against that, our payments to the States have<br />
risen by œ 29,000,000. Does any critic here or elsewhere say we<br />
should not have done that?<br />
Mr. Pollard; Only by<br />
MR. MENZIES: I have heard you and many other people. I remember<br />
everything you say with loving care, and I have heard you say<br />
many times that the States ought to have more. Very well, the<br />
payments to the States this year, under an agreement which they<br />
all accepted with great satisfaction are up by œ 29,000,000. I<br />
have mentioned those two matters.<br />
Budget expenditure has risen by œ 89,700,000. Some one<br />
says, " That is a tremondous increase. That shows you are not<br />
controlling Commonwealth expenditure." I remind the committee<br />
of the fact that this year allocations by the Australian Loan<br />
Council for works and housing, every shilling of which will go<br />
to the States, has risen by œ 10,000,000. Moreover, as a result<br />
of the increases provided for in the Budget, expenditure on<br />
social ervices and rupatriation benofits will rise by<br />
œ 10100,000 I have already mentioned an increase of œ 29m. in<br />
payments to the States. The increased cost of social services<br />
at existing rates, apart from all changes proposed for this year,<br />
will be œ 23,000,000. Does anybody suggest that provision should<br />
not have been made for those payments? The increased cost of<br />
repatriation benefits, apart from the increases provided for in<br />
the Budget and to which I havu referred, will be œ 8,100,000.<br />
Does anybod-suggest that we should repudiate our debt charges?<br />
They have risen by œ 3500,000. In addition, according to our<br />
estimato, which may turn out to be somewhat conservative,<br />
expenditure on redemptions will rise by œ 2,600,000. All that<br />
means that of this nominal increase of œ 89,000,000 to which I<br />
have referred, the sum of œ 86,500,000 is in respect of items<br />
which no one in the Parliament or outside it would challenge.<br />
In other words, there has been an increase of œ 3,200,000, When<br />
we set off against that the reduction in expenditure on capital<br />
works, honorable members will see that the actual increase in<br />
Commonwealth expenditure is quite nominal.<br />
As responsible members in this Parliament we should ask<br />
ourselves, " Has any body. any proposals to reduce any of these<br />
items?" If he has, the Treasurer and, if I may say so, I will<br />
be interested to hear them. But nobody has any proposal to offer.<br />
There has boon no hint of one. Therefore, the first charge<br />
against the Budget falls to the ground.<br />
Next, it is said I know this is not what the<br />
Opposition said that the Govarnment, by an ultra-cautious<br />
approach, is retarding expansion. All I need say in reply to<br />
that charge is that, on the facts, it is just silly. I have not<br />
the time to quote all the figures; they are familiar to<br />
honorable members from their reading of the documentso o have<br />
had record housing, record employment, record production, record </p>
<p>-w<br />
0 4.<br />
average earnings, record national development and record contributions<br />
by the Commonwealth in the field of education.<br />
Mr. Pollard: And record inflation.<br />
MR. MENZIES: To say that we are retarding expansion is to nake<br />
a statement which anybody who cares to go anywhere in Australia<br />
and look about then will see is contradicted.<br />
The third charge against the Governmnt is that we<br />
have inflation. That is true. It is referred to by the<br />
Opposition annually during the Budget debate. But I ha. ve never<br />
known the Opposition to make a single proposal calculated to<br />
retard it.<br />
Mr. Cairns: You never deal with our case.<br />
MR. MENZIES: How can I deal with a non-existent case? You<br />
have no case. I am flattering you by even pretending to disnuss<br />
it. I adrit, Mr. Chairman, that we have an inflationary movemont.<br />
But we as the Government have a policy which has been stated and<br />
been acted upon with precision. It is unfortunate that I should<br />
have to repeat it. First, we adopted the principle that there<br />
should be some sensible restraint not injustice in wage<br />
costs. The Opposition has bitterly attacked us for that<br />
approach. But the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission has agree with us. Secondly, we sai. d we would remove<br />
import licensing in j~ ubstance. We said that because we wanted<br />
the ordinary man and woman in Australia, rich or poor, to be<br />
able to have more goods and to buy more services so that the<br />
inflationary pressures night be reduced. What does the<br />
Opposition say about it? So far as I h. ve understood honorable<br />
members opposite, they have been opposed to getting rid of<br />
import licensing. I thought for a while that the reason why they<br />
wanted import licensing rete. nod was that they regarded it as a<br />
protective measure for industry.<br />
Mr. Peters: Is that why the Govcrnent implemented it?<br />
MR. MENZIES: I seen to recall that the honorable member has<br />
spoken on that subject. There is nothing like dealing with the<br />
facts of life. When import licensing goes, that is a fact of<br />
life. Therefore, I should have expected the Opposition to say,<br />
" Let us do something that will prevent Australian secondary<br />
industry from being injured by the inflow of imports."<br />
Mr. Peters: Huar, hear!<br />
MR. MENZIES: I an very glad that my honorable friend should<br />
say " Hoar, hear". But when ny colleague the Minister for Trade<br />
( Mr. McEwen) introduced a bill to provide for urgent temporary<br />
import duties so that local industries should not be damaged by<br />
a flood of inports, the entire Opposition in this Parliament<br />
perhaps inadvertently I do not know voted against it.<br />
Mr. Reynolds: You get close to the truth sometimes.<br />
MR. MENZIES: The honorable member ought to think about these<br />
matters. The fact is that the Opposition voted against the<br />
giving of power to impose temporary import duties to protect<br />
Australian industries while the Tariff Board conducted its full<br />
and final inquiry. Honorable members opposite may go away and<br />
laugh that off at their leisure. The fact is that they wanted<br />
import licensing, but when they could not got it they could not<br />
have cared less about what happened to Australian manufacturing<br />
industries. They have made that peifectly clear.<br />
Our third item of policy was that we would support<br />
measures designed to avoid excess bank and credit liquidity. I<br />
do not know -hat is the attitude of the Opposition on this </p>
<p>matter. Everyone who have a rudimentary knowledge of how to<br />
deal with inflationary process knows that the restraint of<br />
credit is one of the great things that a central bank ought to<br />
be engaged in. But we do not know what the Opposition thinks<br />
about this matter.<br />
Mr. Haylen: What about hire purchase?<br />
MR. MENZIES: Honorable members opposite mumble about hire<br />
purchase, but none of their colleagues in any State Labour<br />
Governmont seems to do a thing about it. Fourthly and this<br />
is the hub of the matter we said, " We will avoid deficit<br />
finance in 1960-61." Ie sid that, many months back, and this<br />
Budget is our performance of it. Does any responsible person<br />
challenge the idea that we ought not to have a deficitthis year?<br />
Is there a solitary sc-. l I use the words loosely on the<br />
Opposition side who believes that we ought to be budgeting for<br />
a deficit at a time of inflationary pressure? Is there a<br />
single writer of any responsibility anywhere who says that we<br />
should? Or course not, and, Sir, if nobody can challenge that<br />
proposition, let the Opposition face up to it. How does it<br />
propose to balance the Budget? Let us assume that it believes<br />
that the Budget ought to be balanced and that we ought not to be<br />
in deficit: How does it propose to do it? Not one word have<br />
we heard from the Opposition<br />
Mr. Bryant: Whose budget is it?<br />
MR. MENZIES: It is ours.<br />
Mr. Bryant: Well do something about it, then. ' Jo are barren of<br />
ideas.<br />
MR. MENZIES: The honorable member says that the Opposition is<br />
barren of ideas. That is a perfect description of the<br />
difference between these two parties. Does the Opposition say,<br />
" Yes, we are going to balance the Budget by reducing expenditure"?<br />
Certainly not because, on its own showing, it would<br />
increase the Budget out of hand. On this great problem, the<br />
problem that we have tackled in this Budget, the Labour Party<br />
is futile and silent. Having mentioned these four points I just<br />
say this, before I conclude: I am sure members opposite say<br />
some of them have hinted at it that social services are<br />
neglected Mr. Peters: So they are.<br />
MR. MENZIES: Yes, I knew the honorable member would say that.<br />
He is my over present help in time of trouble. I hope he never<br />
leaves his seat. I could not live without him.<br />
Mr. Clyde Cameron: Uhat about Lord Ward?<br />
MiR. MENZIES: No, there is no risk of that, I hope. But, Sir,<br />
think of it; pensions, medical benefits, hospital benefits,<br />
child endowment all those things social services, about<br />
which honorable members opposite talk ccasionally and<br />
occasionally incessantly where we came in, just as they wont<br />
out totalled œ 92n. and in this Budget totalled œ 330n.<br />
Mro No wonder, with you in charge.<br />
MR. MENZIES: I know I am going to have some clever fellow say,<br />
" Yes, the value of money has fallen". Y; s, if we take either<br />
the series index or the new consumer index figure which<br />
has been evolved we find that there has been, over that period<br />
of tine, an increase in the index figure from roughly 60 to<br />
roughly 120. In other words, there is a change to that extent,<br />
but that is only a faction of th-increase in social services<br />
from œ 92n. to œ 330n. But having mentioned those global figures,<br />
I </p>
<p>0 6.<br />
lot me say this; honorable mombors opposite have boon fairly<br />
silont on the change that is emerging in the nemoas tost for<br />
property and income. I wonder if they thoroughly' realize that<br />
this change in the moans tost will give some benefit, and in<br />
many cases a large benefit to 120,000 people in this country:<br />
and therefore, Sir, broadly the Budget is aptly fashioned and<br />
stands, if not unassailed, at least unbroken by his arguments.<br />
It is aptly fashioned to slow down and to arrest inflation and<br />
to maintain development; those two things being things that<br />
have to live togetho-r presenting the greatest possible<br />
difficulties of adjustment; and, above all things, to provide<br />
social justice for 10,000,000 people in what I believe is one<br />
of the great countries of the world. </p>
