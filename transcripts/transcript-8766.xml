PRIME MINISTER 142/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THEk PRIME MINISThR, THlE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
BA'XTLE OF GONA<br />
All Australians should remember this week thc dcbt of gratitude they owe to the troops<br />
who, exactly 50 years ago, overcame fierce defences to occupy the Japancse stronghold of<br />
Gona, in Paptia.<br />
Thc campaign in Papua did not end with the iccapture of Kokoda. It involved further<br />
months of bitter fighting in malarial swamps, against anl increasingly desperatc enemy.<br />
Thcre were 8,500 Australian and American casualties in the Papuan campaign. Twothirds<br />
of thenm dicd in the battles for the Japanese beachheads around Gona, Buna and<br />
Sanananda. These men died in vicious hand-to-hand fighting around thc Japanese<br />
bunker-,; their Japanese opponents died rather than surrender.<br />
I recall the words of Dudley McC'arthy, thc official historian, who wrote that the fighting<br />
around Gona, Buna and Sanaiaiida was " so appalling that most hardened soldiers would<br />
remember it unwillingly, and as their most exacting experience of the whole war."<br />
Australians should rceember this week men such as Colonel Ralph Honner, who led his<br />
militiamen across the Kokoda Track and into the maelstrom of Gona; men such as<br />
_ Lieutenant Bob Sword, who served throughout the Kokoda campaign but who died<br />
leading his platoon against the coastal machine-gun posts; and men such as Private A. J.<br />
Skilbeck, who repeatedly crossed open ground under heavy fire, carrying mcssages and<br />
wounded comrades.<br />
These men were real Australian heroes.<br />
While we all honour the men who fought on thc Kokoda Track, wc must never forget the<br />
heroes who fought the Papuan campaign to its conclusion through tile vicious battlcs at<br />
Sanananda, Du~ na and Gona.<br />
