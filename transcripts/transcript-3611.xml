PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 447<br />
11 February 1975<br />
THE SENATE<br />
The decision of the N. S. W. Cabinet denies the<br />
people of N. S. W. the representation for which they decisively<br />
voted in May 1974. For the second time in nine months the<br />
Liberal and Country Parties have attempted to set aside the<br />
clear verdict of the electors. In April 1974 Liberal and<br />
Country Party Senators set the dangerous precedent of refusing<br />
the elected government the money it needs to govern.<br />
Their counterparts in N. S. W. now propose to override the<br />
unbroken precedent for filling casual vacancies in the Senate.<br />
The Senate is elected by the system of proportional<br />
representation. The system is specifically designed to ensure<br />
that within each State the parties secure representation<br />
in proportion to the votes cast in their favour. The grouping<br />
of candidates according to party on the ballot paper is a<br />
very specific acknowledgement of the party nature of Senate<br />
elections. The N. S. W. decision completely undermines the<br />
purpose of the proportional system.<br />
In N. S. W. Australian Labor Party candidates for the<br />
Senate polled 200,000 first preference votes more than<br />
their Liberal and Country Party opponents 50 per cent of<br />
the formal votes compared with 41.67 per cent for the Liberal-<br />
Country Party. The effect of the N. S. W. Cabinet decision is<br />
to give 50 per cent of the N. S. W. electors four senators and<br />
41.67 per cent six senators. In Australia as a whole,<br />
Australian Labor Party candidates polled 250,000 votes more<br />
than the Liberal-Country Party candidates 47.29 per cent<br />
against 43.42 per cent. The N. S. W. decision gives the 47 per cent<br />
twenty-eight senators and the 43 per cent thirty senators.<br />
This is a travesty.<br />
The N. S. W. proposal would completely overturn the<br />
intention of the electors of N. S. W. It would completely reverse<br />
N. S. W. representation in the Senate. It would make the Senate<br />
as a whole even less representative of the opinion of the<br />
electors recorded in May. Instead of a Senate elected with<br />
twenty-nine Labor senators, twenty-nine Liberal and Country<br />
Party senators and two Independent senators there will be only<br />
twenty-eight Labor senators. A further distortion of the<br />
verdict of the people arises from today's announcement by<br />
Senator Townley that he will join the Liberal Party. He was<br />
elected as an Independent and very probably because he was<br />
an Independent. Even without this N. S. W. move the opposition in<br />
the Senate is able to defeat every piece of government legislation.<br />
A Senate so composed is completely lacking in legitimacy.<br />
It just does not reflect the will of the people. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It was astonishing for Mr Lewis to put forward so<br />
outrageous a proposition. It is unbelievable that in the<br />
sober light of day this " mad" act as Mr Gorton put it,<br />
should receive the full backing of the N. S. W. Cabinet. It<br />
is further astonishing that this support should be forthcoming<br />
after the proposal has been repudiated by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, Mr Snedden. Very correctly Mr Snedden said,<br />
" The convention has served us very well. You never know when<br />
it might operate in reverse." Mr Snedden might well apply<br />
this insight to an even older and more important convention<br />
that the Senate does not refuse supply.<br />
The fact is that the Liberal and Country Parties,<br />
federal and state, have shown their readiness to tear up<br />
the rules whenever it suits them. The parliamentary system<br />
everywhere is under challenge. Throughout the world more<br />
and more people are losing faith in that system. No system,<br />
certainly not one so complex and delicate and difficult as<br />
the Australian parliamentary system, can long sustain repeated<br />
onslaughts on its basic assumptions and conventions. The<br />
Conservative parties who used to arrogate to themselves the<br />
title of defenders of the parliamentary system are now<br />
subverting it.<br />
This is an act of sabotage against the Senate, an<br />
act of sabotage against the clear will of the people of<br />
an act of sabotage against the Constitution and an<br />
act of sabotage against the whole parliamentary system in<br />
Australia. CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
