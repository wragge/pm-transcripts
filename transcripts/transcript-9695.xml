SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING, ' 1945: WAR PEACE', AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL,<br />
11 AUGUST 1995<br />
I am delighted to be here today to open the ' 1945: War and Peace' exhibition,<br />
and to launch the Australian War Memorial's Public Appeal.<br />
I regularly make the pilgrimage down Anzac Parade and I happily do so<br />
because the War Memorial is one of our great public institutions.<br />
It documents the experiences of Australians at war. It preserves and protects<br />
our national memory.<br />
And it educates our young people in what J S Manifold called " the old heroic<br />
virtues" of Australia.<br />
It inducts them into the Australian faith.<br />
Last year I launched the Memorial's first ever Capital Appeal. The Appeal<br />
aims to raise $ 20 million to renew the Memorial to redevelop the major<br />
galleries and to enliven the stories which they tell.<br />
The Federal Government gave the lead gift of $ 2.5 million to the Capital<br />
Appeal and since then the State and Territory governments have together<br />
pledged $ 2 million.<br />
And corporate Australia has also been part of the effort.<br />
Today we are launching the next stage of the Capital Appeal, the public<br />
phase. Over the coming months, millions of Australians will be asked to<br />
donate to the Memorial and I'm sure they will rally to the cause.<br />
Money alone, of course, can not rebuild a great museum.<br />
I'm convinced that the public appeal will also engage the community in the<br />
affairs of the Memorial and encourage a sense of its community ownership. </p>
<p>Let me say that I think it is entirely appropriate that the first exhibition arising<br />
out of the Capital Appeal looks at the Australia of 1945.<br />
1945 was the last year of the most destructive war in history.<br />
It was the year in which an alliance of free nations finally answered the<br />
challenge to the values which sustain our civilisation.<br />
1945 was the year of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />
But it was also the year in which Australia welcomed home hundreds of<br />
thousands of our uniformed men and women.<br />
' 1945: War and Peace' illustrates to new generations how the lives of<br />
Australians were affected by the war and the dreams that were held for the<br />
peace. It is a profoundly human exhibition and it displays some wonderful relics.<br />
A sweetheart brooch sent by a soldier to his mother.<br />
A handkerchief signed by her dad's comrades which was a seven year old<br />
girl's seventh birthday present.<br />
A baton belonging to Blamey, and the fuselage of a Beaufort bomber.<br />
This exhibition tells us some wonderful stories. It tells us, for example, about<br />
Moira Atkins, who served as a nurse on the island of Labuan. In 1945, she<br />
won a beauty contest and with it a kiss from Mountbatten. I'm delighted to<br />
learn that Moira is here today, and I look forward to meeting her.<br />
It's also a very democratic exhibition. I'm told that those visitors who recall<br />
VP Day can contribute their memories to the display and in doing so<br />
strengthen and deepen the story.<br />
In this way, ' 1945: War and Peace' is a conversation part of the great<br />
national conversation of the Australia Remembers year.<br />
The curator of this exhibition, Peter Stanley, and the rest of the War Memorial<br />
staff, have done a marvellous job of presenting this story. But of course they<br />
cannot claim authorship because that honour belongs to the whole World<br />
War II generation.<br />
It belongs to Australia's fighting men. And it belongs to those Australians who<br />
stayed at home and performed miracles of production so that the war could<br />
be fought and won. </p>
<p>If a single message can be derived from ' 1945: War and Peace' and a single<br />
lesson learnt it is that we are strongest when we work together.<br />
The people that we see and read about in these galleries were united in<br />
pursuit of a common cause and a just cause.<br />
The Australians of 1945 believed in themselves, trusted each other, and<br />
loved Australia.<br />
Today, as much as ever, we need their belief.<br />
We also need their energy, and their sense of purpose. Because while the<br />
achievements of the World War II generation were great, their task remains<br />
unfinished.<br />
That task is to build and protect a strong, fair, prosperous and self-reliant<br />
nation. We owe the same duty as the Australians of World War II: a duty to<br />
the next generation, to the future Australia.<br />
And the best way to honour the lives of the Australians of 1945 is to continue<br />
their work.<br />
It is important that as the war recedes in our history, it does not also recede in<br />
our memory.<br />
This generation of Australians and the generations to come must never forget<br />
that 40,000 names appear on the Memorial's Roll of Honour.<br />
Let me congratulate all those people who are working so hard to reinvigorate<br />
the Australian War Memorial the people's museum. In particular, the Chair<br />
of the National Appeal, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, former Director Brendan<br />
Kelson and Deputy Director Michael McKernan, and the Head of<br />
Development Ros Casey.<br />
Together, these people are leaving a marvellous legacy to the Memorial and<br />
no less to the nation.<br />
I am very happy to officially open the ' 1945: War Peace' exhibition and<br />
launch the Public Appeal and may I commend both the exhibition and the<br />
Appeal to all Australians.<br />
Thank you. </p>
