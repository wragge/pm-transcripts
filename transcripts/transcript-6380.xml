PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 April 1984<br />
The Governor-General in Council has approved a proclamation<br />
that ' Advance Australia Fair' is now Australia's national<br />
anthem.<br />
The royal anthem, ' God Save the Queen', is to be used only'<br />
in the presence of the Queen or a member of the Royal<br />
Family in Australia on an official visit.<br />
The Vice-Regal salute now consists of the first four bars and<br />
the last four bars of ' Advance Australia Fair'.<br />
The Governor-General's proclamation was issued in a special<br />
gazette earlier today.<br />
The Governor-General has also proclaimed Australia's traditional<br />
sporting colours, green and gold, to be the national colours<br />
f or use on all occasions on which such colours are customarily<br />
used. The specific colours proclaimed are pantone matching system<br />
numbers 116C and 348C as used for printing paper.<br />
These colours are similar to the colours on the medicare cards<br />
now held by all Australian families.<br />
The use of green and gold for Australia's international sporting<br />
teams goes back many years and have been our Olympic teams'<br />
colours since the 1920s.<br />
I am sure that all Australians will be proud that our colours<br />
associated with our many great sporting achievements since last<br />
century are now recognised officially as the nation's colours.<br />
We can all identify with these and with our distinctive national<br />
anthem, proud of our past history and working together on<br />
constructing a great future. </p>
