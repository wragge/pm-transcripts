FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 23/ 1967<br />
NEW ZEALAND CONTRIBUTION TO TASMANIAN<br />
BUSHFIRE FUND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I have received advice that the New Zealand Government<br />
has donated Å“ 10, 000 ( sterling) ($ A25, 000) to aid bushfire victims in<br />
Tasmania. In addition, the New Zealand High Commissioner in<br />
Canberra, Mr. Luke Hazlett, is organising an appeal among his staff<br />
in Australia. These warmhearted contributions reflecting as they<br />
do the close friendship between the two countries will be much<br />
appreciated by all Australians as they are by the Commonwealth and<br />
Tasmanian Governments.<br />
CANBERRA, 1Gth February, 1967 </p>
