SPEXCH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KFATING, HP<br />
ANZAC DAY ELK BEACH, PORT XORESSY,<br />
1O. 30AX, SATURDAY, 25 APRIL 1992<br />
Today marks the 77th anniversary of the most famous battle<br />
in Australia's history.<br />
And in New Zealand's history.<br />
On this day through all those years we have repeated the<br />
words " Lest we forget".<br />
And we have Wt. forgotten.<br />
The message has always been remember their bravery and<br />
sacrifice, their willingness to lay down their lives for<br />
their country, and for their friends.<br />
Gallipoli and the history of the Australian nation are<br />
indissoluble. It Is inscribed In legend.<br />
The legend was cenented in the terrible battles in Europe<br />
and the Middle East between 1915 and 1918.<br />
it was sustained between the wars when the monuments were<br />
built and the rituals of the nation born at Gallipoli were<br />
defined. The spirit of AnZac became the canon of Australian life: the<br />
ideals to which we aspired, the values by which we lived.<br />
The legend was re-visited in 1939 when Australian troops<br />
again left for th* Middle East# again fought heroically,<br />
again with New Zealanders and again# some might say, too<br />
often against the odds.<br />
Sixty thousand young Australians died in the First World<br />
War; 30,000 in the Second.<br />
The great majority of them lie buried On the other side of<br />
the world. In France and Belgiun, Libya, Syria, Turkey,<br />
Greece, Crete.<br />
1, v w r arL </p>
<p>2<br />
They a1. o lie in Singapore and Malaysia, Burma, Borneo and<br />
other countries of this region, including of course, Papua<br />
New Guinea.<br />
Countless others died prematurely as a result of war, or had<br />
their lives and the lives of their families scarred by war.<br />
War has shaped Australia's history in the twentieth century<br />
like nothing else. Shaped and twisted it.<br />
At times it has stifled It.<br />
We will continue to hold the memory of those who served and<br />
died as inextinguishable and sacred.<br />
We will continue to remind ourselves " Lest We Forget".<br />
Legends bind nations together. They define us to ourselve.<br />
But they should not stifle us.-Thy should not constrain<br />
our growth, or restrict us when weehave to change.<br />
Anzac is a commemoration of the most universal human values.<br />
But it does not confer on us a duty to see that the world<br />
stands Still.<br />
The Australians who went to two World Wars, or to Yorea,<br />
Malaya, Vietnam, went to secure a place in the world for<br />
their country and its ideal&amp;.<br />
The world coves on. our country must ZoVe with it.<br />
Today i think we should remember that.<br />
Today we would do wall to remember the t= great dramas<br />
which were played out fifty years ago.<br />
we all should know the story better than we do.<br />
We should remember not only the battles which were fought<br />
here in Papua New Guinea, or in Malaya, or at El Alamein,<br />
Tobruk, or Greece and crete: or those who suffered and died<br />
in prison camps in Singapore, Burma and elsewhere in the<br />
world. We should remember all those, but we should also remember<br />
the battle fought out in Canberra and London and Washington<br />
for in large part it was that battle which sad* success<br />
here in Papua New Guinea possible.<br />
In that battle J~ ohn curtin defied those people Australia had<br />
never before defied.<br />
He insisted to his counterparts in London and Washington<br />
his friendA 2g friends that Australian troops then<br />
serving in the Middle East should return home and defend<br />
Australia&amp;. </p>
<p>Shortly after, he defied them again. And he defied those in<br />
Austra1lia who criticised him for his defiance those who<br />
said it was a great blUnder to defy the British and<br />
Americans. He defied ttem, and insisted that the returning troops not<br />
be diverted to Burma, but cone home and fight the Battle for<br />
Australia. John Curtin wasn right.<br />
Just as he was right when he declared that in the hour of<br />
grisis, after the tall of Singapore, Australia looked to the<br />
United States free, he said " of any pangs as to our<br />
traditional lin-ks of kinship with the United Kingdom."<br />
" We know that Australia can go and Britain still hold on"#<br />
he said. " we are therefore determined that Australia shall<br />
not go.."<br />
in doing this he took the Anzac legend to mean that<br />
Australia came first that whatever the claims of Empire on<br />
the loyalty of those who died in the Great War, the preeminent<br />
claim had been Xuatralials.<br />
The Australians who served here in Pa pua New Guinea fought<br />
Ad died, not in the defence of t~ iT~ old wol-but the new<br />
world. ThefK world.<br />
They died in defence of Australia and the civilisation anid<br />
values which had grown up there.<br />
That is why it might be said that, for Australians, the<br />
battles in Papua New Guinea were the most important ever<br />
fought,<br />
They were fought in the rost terrible circunstances. One<br />
correspon~ dent wrote: " Surely no war was ever fought under<br />
worse conditions than these. Surely no war has ever dem~ anded<br />
more of a man in fortitude."<br />
They were fought by young raen with no experience of jungle<br />
warfare, By the very young men of the militia with no<br />
experience of war at all.<br />
They were fought by airman of outstanding courage, skill and<br />
dedication. They were fought against a seasoned, skilful and fanatical<br />
enemy. At Milne Bay the Australians inflicted on the Japanese their<br />
first defeat on land. </p>
<p>4<br />
Sir William Slim, who was then commanding the 14th Army in<br />
Burma, wrote: " It was Australian soldiers who first broke<br />
the spell of invincibility of the Japanese army: those of us<br />
Who were in Burma have cause to remember. 1"<br />
On the Kokoda Trail it was again the young and inexperienced<br />
militia men this time of the 39th and 53rd battalions<br />
later reinforced with soldiers of the 7th Division, who<br />
fought gallantly and eventually Won.<br />
when it seemed that Papua New Guinea would fall, when it<br />
seemed it would be another Singapore, another Rabaul, these,<br />
troops gallantly held out and finally drove the enemy back<br />
to the sea.<br />
These were the heroic days of Australiats history.<br />
It would Do wrong to let this day pass without paying<br />
tribute to the people of other countries whose bravery and<br />
selflessness helped win the day including the British and<br />
other Commonwealth servicemen and women who fought in the<br />
war against Japan.<br />
While Australians fought the enemy here in Papua New Guinea#<br />
the United State&amp; forces held that out at sea and on<br />
Guadalcanal. What they did then created the enduring bond between<br />
Australia and the United States.<br />
T~ oday we must also pay tribute to the servicemen of Papua<br />
New Gi. inea who fought and died under Australian command.<br />
And, perhaps above all, we should honour and express our<br />
profound admirationi for the papua New Guinean carriers whose<br />
stalwart support was crucial to the final victory.<br />
The support they gave to Australian soldiers, the terrible<br />
conditione and dangers they endured wlt-the soldiers, the<br />
illness, injury and death zany of them suffered, constitutes<br />
one of the great humane gestures of the War perhaps Zft<br />
great humane gesture of our history,<br />
it has never been forgotten, and never will be forgotten. it<br />
in the best possible reminder that these battlea wore<br />
fought, not for the glory of war, but for humanity.<br />
And it, too, created an enduring bond -between Papua N4ew<br />
Guinea and Australia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, these Gays there is a relatively new<br />
memorial to the Anzac legend in Australia,<br />
Sitting on the hill near the new Parliament Mouse, it is a<br />
modest monument inscribed with these words: " Look ground YOU<br />
these are the things they believed In. </p>
<p>T EL:<br />
In the end they believed in Australia in the democracy<br />
they had built, In the life they had nade therej anld the<br />
future they believed their country held.<br />
Not all generations are called on to risk and sacrif ice<br />
their lives for their beliefs but all generations need to<br />
believe. On this Anzac Day it seems appropriate to remind ourselves<br />
of our responsibility to renew that faith and loyalty.<br />
There can be no better way, surely, to honour those who so<br />
gallantly fought and died here. </p>
