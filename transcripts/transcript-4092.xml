PRIME MINISTER APRIL 6, 1976<br />
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT ROYAL VISIT<br />
I wish to inform the House that the dates for The Queen's<br />
visit to Australia and New Zealand next year will be released<br />
-from Buckingham Palace today.<br />
Her Majesty plans to visit a number of Commonwealth countries<br />
in 1977 as part of celebrations to mark the twenty-fifth<br />
anniversary of her reign.<br />
I was pleased to confirm to the Palace in December last, after<br />
the Government had been elected to office, the invitation which<br />
had been extended at an earlier date by the former Prime Minister.<br />
The visit to Australia will be planned to begin with an arrival<br />
in Canberra on Monday 7 March and overall it is likely to last<br />
between two and three weeks. During that time Her Majesty who will<br />
be accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh, hopes to visit each<br />
State -Capital.<br />
The sequence has yet to be decided and precise dates have yet to<br />
be settled.<br />
This news will be received with a great deal of pleasure. Everyone<br />
of The Queen's subjects in Australia will be delighted to know<br />
that Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are able to come again<br />
and, spend time with us. They will receive a very warm welcome.<br />
The primary purpose of the visit will be to celebrate the silver<br />
jubilee of Her Majesty's acces~ sion to the Throne and the Australian<br />
people will be pleased to know that The Queen and The Duke of<br />
Edinburgh will be able to visit each State even though their<br />
time in each will be limited.<br />
In March 1974, Her Majesty was to have visited South Australia and<br />
Western Australia and was greatly disappointed when her<br />
constitutional duties in Britain brought about their cancellation.<br />
For next year's visit The Queen has asked that her itinerary<br />
include added time in both South Australia and Western Australia<br />
as they have not been visited by her since 1963. ./ 2 </p>

The Royal Yacht BRITANNIA is expected to be in Australian waters<br />
at the time of The Queen's visit and will be used as Her Majesty's<br />
home wherever possible. It will also be a means of transport<br />
and of rest between engagements, as well as being available<br />
for hospitality purposes. </p>
