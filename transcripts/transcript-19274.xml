<p>[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>It's a great pleasure to be here today for the opening of this magnificent new centre.  </p>
<p>Today we celebrate the hard work that has transformed a bold idea into reality. </p>
<p>And we mark another important moment in Australia's evolving appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.</p>
<p>A significant new chapter in a story we can trace back to the man whose name graces this university.</p>
<p>It is 177 years since Charles Darwin visited Australia.</p>
<p>We were just one stop on his five year voyage on the Beagle.</p>
<p>A journey that inspired and informed his theory which changed the way we look at the world forever.</p>
<p>The Origin of Species proved that Darwin saw further and thought deeper than this peers.</p>
<p>But Darwin's description of Australia, published in The Voyage of the Beagle, reveals that he was also a creature of his time. </p>
<p>So the view of Australia which we see in Darwin's writing  -  and in particular of the First Australians  -  is a narrow one.  </p>
<p>When he encountered the world's oldest living culture, Darwin could not rise above a benign Victorian curiosity  -  or express himself in other than faint praise:</p>
<p>‘In their own arts', he wrote, ‘they are admirable'.</p>
<p>For Darwin, and for so many of his peers, their assessments were limited by the common prejudices of their time.</p>
<p>For too long, the outsiders who documented Indigenous Australia did so with closed minds.</p>
<p>Where they should have listened, they judged.</p>
<p>Where they could have learned, they sought to instruct. </p>
<p>When they should have shown interest, they were apathetic.</p>
<p>This ignorance  -  what Stanner so aptly termed this ‘Great Australian Silence'  -  long diminished us all. </p>
<p>Today is one of those days on which we are reminded of that sad past  -  and reminded of how far we have come.</p>
<p>Australians everywhere now understand the central place that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture occupies in our national story.</p>
<p>We are embracing it with pride.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, we are beginning to realise how much there is to learn from the ways of Indigenous Australia.</p>
<p>New perspectives on the management of our natural resources, new understandings in language, art and music. </p>
<p>This is the real significance of places like the Centre for Australian Indigenous Knowledges and Education.</p>
<p>This is why today is so exciting.</p>
<p>Such places help us to see Indigenous society as a living guide to the continent and community we all share.</p>
<p>Alongside its cultural function, this Centre will be a home to the next generation of Indigenous leaders.</p>
<p>The specially designed Bachelor's Degrees will give students the opportunity to develop their abilities in governance, advocacy, community leadership and teaching.</p>
<p>The Preparation for Tertiary Success course will give those returning to the education system the skills and confidence to achieve the best possible results at university.</p>
<p>Every course works in partnership with the Learnline program so students in remote communities have access to class materials and discussions.</p>
<p>This Centre is a place filled with natural light and designed for group-learning and discussion, open-air conversations and classes. An ideal demonstration of the idea that the best design is a meeting of function and form.</p>
<p>This is a moment worth celebrating  -  you have created something which is an example for universities across Australia and around the world</p>
<p>I congratulate you all for your vision and courage in realising it.</p>
<p>This Centre is a symbol of all that Indigenous leadership can offer.</p>
<p>It is proof of how far Australia has come, and a marker for the road ahead.</p>
<p>With great pride  -  and in a spirit of Reconciliation and friendship  -  I declare the Australian Centre for Indigenous Knowledges and Education officially open and wish it every success.</p>
