PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST PEI: IVEF-Y EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT BY GOUGH WHITLAI<br />
AT THE PRESS CLUB CANBERRA<br />
MONDAY 11 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
GOUGH WHITLAM, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GUESTS,<br />
THIS IS IN EVERY WAY AN HISTORIC DAY AND AN HISTORIC<br />
OCCASION. AND IT SAYS A GREAT DEAL, NOT ONLY ABOUT GOUGH<br />
WHITLAM THE MAN, BUT ALSO ABOUT OUR PARTY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY WHICH HE LED FOR SO LONG, THAT WE ARE ABLE TO<br />
COME TOGETHER ON THIS DAY OF ALL DAYS NOT TO COMMISERATE,<br />
BUT TO CELEBRATE.<br />
WE ARE CELEBRATING OF COURSE THE PUBLICATION OF THIS BOOK.<br />
AND BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS BOOK IS THE RECORD OF THE WHITLAM<br />
GOVERNMENT OF 1972 1975 WE ARE ALSO CELEBRATING THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS IMPORTANT PLACE IN<br />
THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
MOST OF ALL, WE ARE CELEBRATING GOUGH WHITLAM FORMER LABOR<br />
PRIME MINISTER AND A GREAT AUSTRALIAN, WHO LED LABOR TO<br />
GOVERNMENT IN 1972 AFTER 23 LONG YEARS IN OPPOSITION AND,<br />
WHO IN DOING SO, SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE POLITICAL AGENDA<br />
OF AUSTRALIA SOME ( INCLUDING FREUDY) EVEN SAY, CHANGED THE<br />
WAY WE SPEAK. </p>
<p>AND BECAUSE or THOSE TEINGS, WF ARE ::: TLED TO CELEBRATE<br />
TODAY THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PAFTY ITSEIF DEVASTED TEN YEARS<br />
AGO, TODAY ASCENDANT THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.<br />
AND WE CAN NOW SEE THAT THE RESILIENCE WHICH MADE THAT<br />
RESURGENCE POSSIBLE, IS AS MUCH PART OF THE WHITLAM LEGACY<br />
AS ANYTHING ELSE, BECAUSE THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE PARTY'S<br />
CAPACITY TO SERVE LAY VERY MUCH IN GOUGH'S WORK OF<br />
REFORMATION, RE-EDUCATION, AND RECONSTRUCTION, DURING HIS<br />
LEADERSHIP. I THINK THERE IS A SIMPLE MEASURE OF GOUGH WHITLAM'S PLACE<br />
IN MODERN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY. IN THE DECADE UP TO 1966, ONE<br />
FIGURE ABSOLUTELY DOMINATED AUSTRALIAN POLITICS. THAT WAS,<br />
OF COURSE, SIR ROBERT MENZIES.<br />
THE NEXT DECADE WAS DOMINATED BY GOUGH WHITLAFI<br />
MENZIES, SECOND TIME AROUND, WAS PRIME MINISTER FOR SIXTEEN<br />
YEAR; GOUGH FOR JUST UNDER THREE.<br />
YET WHO TODAY, IN TERMS OF POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT, IN TERMS OF<br />
CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE, IN TERMS OF CHANGES AND REFORMS<br />
AFFECTING THE WAY WE LIVE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WE CAN NOW<br />
ENJOY, COULD PUT MENZIES IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS WHITLAM? </p>
<p>AND I THINK IT IS SIGNIF HS FEGIAFL, THAT WHILE<br />
MANY BOOKS HAVE ALREADY -TEI: ABOUT rVEP. Y ASFECT CF<br />
THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITLAM YEARS AND TODAY<br />
SEES THE PUBLICATION OF GOUCGH'S VERY DEF: I;: T: VE ACCOUNT WE<br />
STILL AWAIT, NOT ONLY THE OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY, BUT ANY<br />
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT AT ALL OF THE MENZIES ERA, NEARLY TWENTY<br />
YEARS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE.<br />
THIS BOOK IS UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS. GOUGH IS NOT BY ANY MEANS<br />
THE FIRST FORMER AUSTRALIAN PIRME MINISTER TO HAVE WRITTEN<br />
BOOKS: DEAKIN, HUGHES, PAGE, FADDEN AND MENZIES HIMSELF<br />
COME TO MIND. BILLY, I UNDERSTAND, IS UP TO HIS THREE<br />
MILLIONTH WORD.<br />
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A FORMER AUSTRALIAN PRIME<br />
MINISTER HAS SERIOUSLY ATTEMPTED TO GIVE A FULL AND SERIOUS<br />
ACCOUNT OF HIS STEWARDSHIP.<br />
AND THAT IS WHY, AS GOUGH EXPLAINS IN HIS INTRODUCTION, THIS<br />
BOOK CONCENTRATES ON POLICY, ITS DEVELOPMENT AND<br />
IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS NOT THE OCCAS: ON OR THE PLACE TO DISCUSS THESE<br />
POLICIES, OR THEIR DEVELOPMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION. HOWEVER,<br />
I WOULD LIKE, BRIEFLY, TO DRAW PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO SOME<br />
OF YOUR GOVERNMENT'S REFORMS, REFORMS WHICH HAVE ENDURED,<br />
AND REFORMS WHICH ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS LABOR GOVERNMENT'S<br />
POLICIES. </p>
<p>YOUF. FIONEEF;! I C T. E RELATI. AS3HIP WITH CHINA IN 1971 WAS<br />
ONE OF THE : CST INEFIPED AND INSPIRING EAMPLES OF POLITICAL<br />
VISION IN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY.<br />
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT CONTINUED YOUR PATHBREAKING WORK IN<br />
CHINA AND WE HAVE VERY CONSIDERABLY AND ENDURINGLY BUILT<br />
UPON THAT SOLID FOUNDATION.<br />
THE EFFORTS WHICH YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE TO ENHANCE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE GIVEN OUR<br />
GOVERNMENT A BASIS FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ASEAN<br />
COUNTRIES, AND SEEKING TO FACILITATE A SETTLEMENT TO THE<br />
TRAGIC CAMBODIAN CONFLICT.<br />
IT WAS YOUR GOVERNMENT WHICH GAVE AUSTRALIA DECENT AND<br />
ACCEPTABLE POLICIES TOWARDS SOUTH AFRICA. THE FRASER<br />
GOVERNMENT TOOK YOUR LEAD AND MADE AUSTRALIA'S APPROACH<br />
BI-PARTISAN.<br />
AND YOUR ROLE, FIRST IN COURAGEOUSLY CHANGING AUSTRALIAN<br />
ATTITUDES TOWARDS PAPUA NEW GUINEA INDEPENDENCE FROM<br />
OFFOSITION AND THEN IN SEEING IT TO FRUITION FROM<br />
GOVERNMENT, HAS ALSO BEEN OF ENORMOUS INFLUENCE IN CREATIT: C<br />
A HEALTHIER REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT FROM WHICH SUCCESSOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN AUSTRALIA HAVE BENEFITTED.<br />
AND ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT SO MANY REFORMS WERE INITIATED.<br />
BUT LET ME MENTION ONE MEDIBANK. DESPITE FRASER'S PROMISE<br />
IN THE 1975 ELECTIO': TO RETAIN IT WAS ALL BUT<br />
DISMAN1TL-E WUtr: IE C.' E TO OFFICE.<br />
rrr i I </p>
<p>BUT v: EFrr r. ETEF. rMINEl AN:-COMMITTED TO RESTORE LABOR'S<br />
HEAL71. POLICiLS.. AND F. AVE.<br />
THE FF. INC1PLE EKB; OD] EZ IN MEDIBANK THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN<br />
HAS THE RIGHT TO THE VEFY BEST AVAILABLE HEALTH AND HOSPITAL<br />
CARE ACCORDING TO NEED IS NOW, BY OUR ACTION, EMBODIED IN<br />
MEDICARE. MEDICARE IS ONE OF MY GOVERNMENT'S MOST SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL<br />
REFORMS. MEDICARE'S UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE HAS<br />
BROUGHT TO AN END THE UNACCEPTABLE SITUATION WHERE UNDER THE<br />
CONSERVATIVES OVER TWO MILLION POOR AND DISADVANTAGED<br />
AUSTRALIANS WERE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE.<br />
AS I HAVE SAID, THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT POLICY AND NOT ABOUT<br />
INTRIGUE OR INFIGHTING. ITS APPROACH AND CONTENT REPRESENT<br />
THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH THAT THE CENTRAL WORK OF GOVERNMENT IS<br />
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY.<br />
AND AS GOUGH POINTS OUT, IN THE CASE OF THE WHITLA;':<br />
GOVERNMENT, EVEN WHEN IT WAS BEING DEPICTED AS BEING<br />
PARA. LYSED BY INTERNAL CRISES AND TURMOIL, THE REAL WCF. OF<br />
GOVE?. NMENT WAS BEING CARRIED ON TO THE END.<br />
BUT THE TRAGEDY OF YOUR TIME WAS THAT WHILE THIS WAS BEING<br />
DONE, EVENTS AND INDIVIDUALS WERE CONSPIRING TO BRING YOUR<br />
GOVERNMENT TO A PREMATURE END.<br />
AMD O THIS DAY 10 YEAR-LATLFR I WOULD WISH SIMPLY TO<br />
IkAXI TMEFE rC::. TS ABOU! TPOSE AND THOSE I: NDNC;.' </p>
<p>:: FERVAT: VE r: OU-ES AND FORCES WHOSE ACTIONS CULMINATED<br />
D; SI:: SSAI-ENGAGED IN THE MOST MASSIVE EXERCISE IN<br />
HYPF.:: RISY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. THE TRADITIONAL<br />
ESP'CzERS, DEFENDE!. r OF LAW ANE ORDER, INVOLVED THEMSELVES<br />
IN THE SMASHING OF THE VERY CONVENTIONS UNDER WHICH OUR<br />
SOCIETY HAD OPERATED FOR 75 YEARS.<br />
I CANNOT CONDONE AND DO NOT FORGET THE ROLES PLAYED BY THE<br />
PRINCIPALS, INCLUDING THAT BY MALCOLM FRASER AND THE<br />
LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY.<br />
WE SHOULD REMEMBER THESE THINGS. WE SHOULD COMMIT OURSELVES<br />
TO ENSURING THEY DO NOT OCCUR AGAIN. BUT WE SHOULD NOT<br />
DWELL WITH HATRED UPON THE PAST.<br />
BUT, FOR THE MOMENT, BACK TO THE BOOK.<br />
MUCH OF THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS BOOK COMES FROM THE<br />
UNIQUENESS OF ITS AUTHOR.<br />
IT IS ALL THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.<br />
IT IS IN EVERY SENSE A BIG BOOK.<br />
IT IS LUCID, FRANK AND DIRECT; THERE ARE PLENTY OF<br />
CRITICISMS BUT, I THINK, LITTLE VINDICTIVENESS OR RANCOUR.<br />
THERE IS OF COURSE, NO FALSE MODESTY AND WHY SHOULD THERE<br />
BE?<br />
ymy 1-I I I I </p>
<p>). N1 1 SUPPC" 5E 7E MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THIS BOOK,<br />
, i:: LE : T IS ACCOUNT AND A REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST, IS<br />
THAT : T IS ESSENTIALLY A BOOK ABOUT THE FUTURE ABOUT THE<br />
FAP. Y'S FUrUT.:, ABOUT AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE.<br />
THEREFORE WE CAN ALL BE GRATEFUL TO GOUGH FOR THIS UNIQUE<br />
BOOK, JUST AS WE ARE ALL DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR HIS<br />
MAGNIFICENT AND UNIQUE CAREER.<br />
AND ON THIS DAY, 11 NOVEMBER, AS I HAVE SAID, WE OF THE<br />
LABOR PARTY CAN BE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL THAT THROUGH THE<br />
PUBLICATION OF THIS BOOK AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, ALL THAT<br />
THIS BOOK REPRESENTS AND STANDS FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT IT<br />
RECORDS, THE LESSON IT TEACHES THIS DAY IS A DAY OF<br />
CELEBRATION. WE CAN ALL TODAY CELEBRATE THE PARTY, THE NATION, THE EVENT,<br />
THE MAN.<br />
GOUGH, IN 1942 ROOSEVELT WROTE TO CHURCHILL THAT IT WAS FUN<br />
TO BE IN THE SAME DECADE WITH HIM.<br />
I CAN TRULY SAY THAT FOR ALL OUR UPS A0 AN4D1 ) ZTSE ERE<br />
WERE A FEW IT WAS FUN BEING WITH YOU Ill THF SAME DECADE THAT<br />
WE WERE TOGETHER AS THE LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL WINGS OF OUR MOVEMENT. IT WAS MORE THAN FUN. IT<br />
WAS GREAT.<br />
A! C THE CATACLYSI OF 11 NOVEMBER 1975 DID NOT STOP THE FUN<br />
C'F BrING WITh E N TH, LAST DECADE. </p>
<p>-7 AND THE COMPLETION OF THIS 7-:-; IIOUS WORK BY SOMEONE IN HIS<br />
SEVENTIETH YEAR IS ITSELF I. 7ANE OF A LOT MORE FUN<br />
TOGETHER IN THE DECADE TO C: E </p>
