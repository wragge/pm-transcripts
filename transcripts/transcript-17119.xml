    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Parliamentary Secretary for Water, Dr Mike Kelly, today congratulated Inghams Enterprises on winning the inaugural Prime Minister's Water Wise Award.</p>
<p>Announced by Dr Kelly at the Australian Water Association Awards Dinner in Brisbane, the award was developed to recognise and reward businesses that excel in water use efficiency and management.</p>
<p>Through their innovative water saving initiatives, Inghams Enterprises has saved 545 million litres of water since March 2009 and reduced their reliance on mains water by 70 per cent</p>
<p>"Inghams Advanced Water Treatment Plant project is one of many impressive water saving initiatives that entered the award," Mr Rudd said.</p>
<p>"It is very encouraging to see that large water users are striving to achieve best practice in water efficiency and demonstrating their commitment to continual improvement."</p>
<p>Dr Kelly said the Australian Government recognises the immense challenge we face as a nation in preparing for a future with less water and the role government, industry, and individuals play in response to these challenges.</p>
<p>"I applaud Inghams Enterprises and the finalists for their leadership and excellence in water savings," Dr Kelly said.</p>
<p>Delivering on a 2007 Australian Government election commitment, the Prime Minister's Water Wise Award complements the Australian Government's Water for the Future key priorities which include: taking action on climate change, using water wisely and securing water supplies.</p>
<p>The winner and four finalists were selected on the basis of their significant water savings; innovation; excellence in project delivery; and high capacity for their approaches to be replicated at other facilities.</p>
<p>The four finalists for the Prime Minister's Water Wise Award were Amcor Australasia; Coca-Cola Amatil; Diageo Australia and Rossdale Golf Club.</p>
