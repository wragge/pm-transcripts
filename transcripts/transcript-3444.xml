I'HEi PRIME MINISTER, MR WHITLAM, TODAY<br />
RELEASED THE GUIDELINES AGREED UPON BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT FOR FOREIGN EQUITY PARTICIPATION IN AND<br />
CONTROL OF THE MINING INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
MR WHITLAM SAID THE GUIDELINES, WHICH<br />
HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR TANAKA, DURING HIS VISIT TO CANBERRA, WERE A<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF TIE POLICY OUTLINED BEFORE THE<br />
MINISTERIAL MEETINGS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN<br />

<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />
GUIDELINES FOR FORE~ IGN EQUITY PARTICIPATION TN<br />
AN!) CONTROLO F, TWIIEfr NN-NG ' INDUTR~ Y<br />
i) Development in Austraianir Interests<br />
The Government's basic aim io to ensure that Australia's<br />
mi neral rusourcus are devel~ oped I n such a way as to br Ing niexinuin<br />
be~ nefits to the Australian people, If this objective is to be<br />
achieved, ultimate responsibility for the exploration, development<br />
and processing of minerals must rest with Australians all<br />
enterprises, whether Australian or foreign-owned, engaged in<br />
exploration, development or processing, must conform with the<br />
national interest. The Government will use all of its powers,<br />
including its export and exchange control powers, to achieve<br />
this aim.<br />
( ii) Equity, Control and ownership<br />
The Government desires, as 0 . major objective, to promote<br />
Australian equity in and q9nro. of Its resources and industries,<br />
and maximum Australian ownership compatible with Australia's longterm<br />
capital requirements and its needs for access to markets,<br />
advanced technology and khow-hv ' The Governiment recognises,<br />
however, that many o-f the important existing enterprises engaged<br />
in the development of Australian resources are under foreign<br />
equity control. For this reason, the promotion of Australian<br />
equity in and control of our resources and industries must be<br />
viewed as a longer-term objective.<br />
( iii) Roles for the Public and Private Sectors<br />
The Government ' recognises that private participation in<br />
exploration and development w~ ill continue to be essential. A<br />
maximum level of activity-will be achieved only if there is<br />
participation both by public bodies, such as the PMA and the<br />
AIDC, and private enterprises. The Government recognises also that<br />
participation by companies will be dependent on the prospect of a<br />
return on capi-tal employed which is commensurate with the high<br />
risks sometimes involved.<br />
( iv) Exploration The Government seeks Australian participation in mineral<br />
exploration. It believes, however, that because of the risks<br />
involved and Australia's limited capital resources, it is more<br />
important to secure a high degree of Australian equity participation<br />
at the production stage. The development of any mineral discoveries<br />
will, of course, be subject to approval by the Government in<br />
accordance with these guidelines.<br />
Processing The Government's objective is the maximum level of mineral<br />
processing consistent with the rational use of Australia's resources, I I) </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />
( vi) Consultations with the Australian Government<br />
The Government expects to be informed of all major<br />
mineral development proposals by Australian as well as foreign<br />
enterprises at an early stage. The point of contact will be<br />
the Minister for Minerals and Energy who will refer to other<br />
Australian Government Ministers matters coming within their<br />
areas of responsibility e. g. the Treasurer on foreign ownership<br />
and on financing aspects, the Minister for the Environment and<br />
Conservation on environmental aspects, and the Minister for Urban<br />
and Regional Development on urban and regional aspects. This will<br />
assist the Government in ensuring that maximum benefits accrue<br />
to the Australian people as a whole. </p>
