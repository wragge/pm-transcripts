ELECTORATE TALK<br />
In the last two weeks, the Labor Party has shown plainly that it<br />
lacks the stability which Australia wants, and the policies<br />
which Australia needs. our job is to face squarely the economic<br />
difficulties the world is experiencing and which are now<br />
hitting Australia hard.<br />
The Government's policies are right for Australia's circumstance! s.<br />
The Australian community wants the Government to tackle economic<br />
problems realistically. our policies have helped cus hion the<br />
impact of the world economic downturn on Australia. What<br />
Australia needs above all is a willingness to work together<br />
at all levels, for it is by working together, by making<br />
the most of our advantages, and by encouraging the initiative<br />
of Australians, that we will achieve our economic goals.<br />
The policies which Labor has adopted would take Australia<br />
down the wrong road entirely. At a time of real difficulty for<br />
the mining industry, the Labor Party would inflict a resources<br />
tax. Surely we want to encourage investment in the mining<br />
industry, so that Australia will be in a position to take<br />
advantage of any upturn in the world economy.<br />
Labor's extra resource tax can only discourage mining investment,<br />
especially when miners generally are not making substantial<br />
profits. It is naive to think the new tax resource would<br />
replace state taxes, it would be additional because the<br />
state premiers would not be willing to give up their taxes<br />
to the Commonwealth.<br />
Or take Labcr's uranium policy, they want to shut the industry<br />
down. It is all very well for people in a country like Australia<br />
rich in natural resources, with no foreseeable need for<br />
nuclear power, to talk about leaving uranium in the ground.<br />
But there are countries which need the uranium which we can<br />
supply to meet their energy requirements. Labor's amended<br />
policy nowh7. ere says that existing contracts will be worked<br />
out. Mr Hayden has said that any suggestion that Labor<br />
has abandonEd its opposition to uranium is a " travesty of the<br />
facts". In seeking to close down the uranium industry, Labor<br />
policy ignores our responsibilities to others, and denies<br />
jobs to Australians and export income to Australia. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Take capital gains taxes. Labor wants to strengthen an existing<br />
section of the Income Amendment Act to make it work as an<br />
" seffective tax on realized capital gains and profits." But<br />
we are not told what the changes would be. Senator Evans has said<br />
he said he has a secret draft of " a rewritten Section 26( a)<br />
which will do the job which we want to do", and we are entitled<br />
to believe it will be a capital gains tax by stealth. At a<br />
time when most people think the burden of personal income tax<br />
is too high, Labor is also committed to reducing the incidence<br />
of indirect taxes, which could only mean higher income taxes under<br />
Labor. By favouring increased progressivity of the personal<br />
income tax supply, Labor wants to push the higher tax rates still<br />
higher. That would reduce incentive, it would reduce productivity,<br />
and increase the anti-social tendency towards tax avoidance.<br />
The Labor Party has declared its socialist commitment to<br />
redistributing income in Australia but its factions disagree<br />
profoundly on the means. Probate tax is one means favoured by<br />
by Mr Cain in Victoria. Mr Cain was proclaiming the virtues<br />
of probate for Victoria at the time when Mr Wran was boasting<br />
of abolishing it in NSW. Mr Cain's probate tax at 39 in<br />
the dollar will be a cruel expropriation from hundreds of<br />
people who had worked hard to secure their own, and their<br />
children's future. The limit of $ 200,000 is not high enough to<br />
protect many ordinary people with normal, suburban homes, people<br />
with small businesses, and those with a home and superannuation.<br />
People who want to start a business will leave Victoria. The<br />
value of houses will fall. There will be more and more empty<br />
houses as people who are retiring leave for other states.<br />
There will be less work in the building industry. There will<br />
be fewer jobs. Mr Cain's probate will damage Victoria's economy<br />
by turning away investment, and cause an exodus of Victorians.<br />
The substance of Labor's National Conference was summed up in<br />
the attitudes on wage indexation. The ConferEnce firstly<br />
voted to reject a proposal for full quarterly wage indexation<br />
in its economic platform. By itself, that would seem like a<br />
rejection of a dangerously inflationary wage policy. But then<br />
two days later, in its industrial relations platform. the<br />
Conference made a commitment to work towards automatic full<br />
quarterly indexation. I suppose that when Labor spokesmen<br />
talk to business groups they give them the first version, and<br />
when speaking to trade unions they use the second version.<br />
