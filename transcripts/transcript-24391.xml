    <content><![CDATA[<p>In November last year, Prime Minister Davutoglu addressed Griffith University in Queensland, on the eve of the G20 summit.</p>
<p>He explained that his great-uncle had fought the Australians at Gallipoli 100 years ago.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, to enter the homeland of a former enemy, even two generations on, would be to invite hostility and suspicion; but Prime Minister Davutoglu was welcomed as a friend in Australia.</p>
<p>Likewise, I have not only been welcomed here as a friend but invited to address this Peace Summit, notwithstanding Australiaâs role in the 1915 attack on Turkey.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister Davutoglu said, it is âvery rareâ¦in historyâ that two nations which fought so fiercely should become such friends.</p>
<p>Indeed, our friendship proves that when the battle is over, when the wounds have healed and when the ground has cooled, warriors can see their enemiesâ virtue.</p>
<p>The Gallipoli campaign (or Canakkale Savasi as you call it here in Turkey) was a dreadful baptism of fire for the young Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
<p>Some 60,000 Australians fought here; nearly 9,000 died, over 20,000 were wounded and thousands more carried the unseen scars for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>An Australian historian wrote of the trauma of the Great War: âdreams abandoned, lives without purpose, women without husbands, families without family life, one long national funeral for a generation and more after 1918â.</p>
<p>It would have been like that for Turkey too.</p>
<p>Thatâs why, this week, Australia salutes the magnanimity of Turkey towards us as well as the courage and self-sacrifice of our own countrymen.</p>
<p>To those who despair of reconciliation in the midst of conflict, I say: look to Turkey and Australia â two foes who have become friends.</p>
<p>In a place of honour, next to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, there is a memorial to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk â a worthy and resourceful leader, who embraced his fallen enemies as sons of Turkey.</p>
<p>Ataturkâs famous words of consolation to the grieving mothers of Australia, that their sons were lying in the soil of a friendly country, will echo around the Anzac services held in our country this week â as they stand in stone on the sacred soil of the Gallipoli Peninsula.</p>
<p>One of the Australians impressed by Ataturkâs statesmanship was our 8th Prime Minister, Stanley Bruce, a Gallipoli veteran whoâd been wounded at Suvla Bay.</p>
<p>But in 1936 he chaired an international conference in the Swiss town of Montreux which restored Turkey to full control over the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>The man who, in 1915, had fought to seize control of the Dardanelles for the Allies, in 1936 worked hard to return them to Turkey.</p>
<p>In Bruceâs closing remarks at the Conference, he declared that Turkey had provided a âmagnificent exampleâ to the world in trying to reach a solution to international problems through legal methods.</p>
<p>It was a practical manifestation of Ataturkâs dream of âpeace at home and peace in the worldâ; a dream thatâs shared by Australians.</p>
<p>Ataturk had been generous to us as a people â and grace begat grace.</p>
<p>For the last century, under successive governments, Australiaâs determination has been to advance our interests, protect our citizens and uphold our values.</p>
<p>We have never believed that we can save the world single-handedly; nor have we shrunk from shouldering our responsibilities.</p>
<p>We seek to act towards others as weâd have them act towards us.</p>
<p>After all, keeping commitments, valuing human life, protecting property and extending freedom are universal aspirations, not just Australian ones.</p>
<p>Since 1947, Australia has provided more than 65,000 personnel to more than 50 multilateral peace and security operations.</p>
<p>We are not accustomed to turning back, once weâve put our hand to the plough.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan we worked with Turkey in the NATO-led force.</p>
<p>On our side of the world, when leadership is needed, we step up, as we did in Bougainville, the Solomons and in Timor-Leste.</p>
<p>I acknowledge Turkeyâs contribution of police to UN missions in Timor-Leste, a wonderful gesture of friendship to a new country and mark of good international citizenship.</p>
<p>Today, Turkey and Australia are working to defeat terrorism in all its forms.</p>
<p>Australia condemns the occupation of Turkeyâs consulate in Mosul by Daesh terrorists.</p>
<p>A terrorist movement calling itself âIslamic Stateâ insults religion and mocks the duties of a legitimate state towards its citizens.</p>
<p>In declaring a caliphate, this death cult has declared war on the world.</p>
<p>Regrettably, some Australians have joined this madness.</p>
<p>Weâve changed our laws to ensure that foreign fighters returning home can be arrested, prosecuted and gaoled for a very long time indeed.</p>
<p>And weâre working to prevent more people joining this conflict.</p>
<p>Our planes and soldiers are part of the international coalition to disrupt, degrade and ultimately destroy the Daesh death cult at the request of the Iraqi government.</p>
<p>We are doing so because the threat it poses respects no national boundaries.</p>
<p>Any group proclaiming âsubmit or dieâ is a threat to our lives and values â and to the lives and values of all decent people.</p>
<p>Australia is a free, fair and, above all, a pluralist society.</p>
<p>Itâs our pluralism that shows that freedom and fairness is real.</p>
<p>Some 70,000 Australian citizens have Turkish descent.</p>
<p>This year is the Year of Turkey in Australia.</p>
<p>And it is the Year of Australia in Turkey.</p>
<p>Important cultural exchanges will complement our increasing economic ties.</p>
<p>This morning I invested Dr Haluk Oral with an award in the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>He has been honoured for his service to our shared history and to the commemoration of the Centenary of the Gallipoli Campaign.</p>
<p>A subject of Dr Oralâs research was Dr Charles Snodgrass Ryan, an Australian whoâd served as a military surgeon at the siege of Plevna, where he repeatedly ran to the aid of wounded Turkish soldiers under fire.</p>
<p>He returned to Turkey in 1915 with the Australian Imperial Force.</p>
<p>On 24 May 1915, when a truce was called to bury the dead, Turkish officers thought that Dr Ryanâs medals might have been stolen.</p>
<p>In rusty Turkish, Dr Ryan responded âThey were pinned upon my chest because I fought at the siege of Plevna with Gazi Osman Pashaâ.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Ryan was a brave man; a healer and a saver of lives.</p>
<p>His story belongs to Australia and it belongs to Turkey too.</p>
<p>As we honour our soldiers and remember their sacrifice, we also honour those who lifted their hands in peace and were a bridge between our peoples.</p>
<p>I honour them all today, Australian and Turkish alike; I honour all who work for a just and lasting peace based on the universal decencies of mankind.</p>
