    <content><![CDATA[<p>Disaster assistance has been activated in response to Tropical Cyclone Lam through the jointly-funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>This assistance is being provided in the local government areas of East Arnhem and West Arnhem.</p>
<p>Financial assistance under the NDRRA includes personal hardship and distress assistance for people impacted by a natural disaster and funding to help local councils restore damaged essential public assets.</p>
<p>Individuals and families impacted by the cyclone can now access immediate relief payments of up to $495 per adult and $250 per child, up to a maximum of $1,245 per family.</p>
<p>Financial assistance for essential repairs to homes and the replacement of household and personal items is also available to eligible individuals and families.</p>
<p>Local Shires will also receive financial assistance to help with the costs of repairing essential public infrastructure damaged by the effects of the cyclone.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments will continue to work closely together to ensure support is provided to those communities most in need as the full impacts of the cyclone become known. </p>
<p>Information on disaster assistance can be located on the Australian Government's Disaster Assist website at<a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au/" target="_blank">http://www.disasterassist.gov.au</a> and on the Northern Territory’s NDRRA website at <a href="http://www.treasury.nt.gov.au/ndrra" target="_blank">http://www.treasury.nt.gov.au/ndrra</a>.  </p>
