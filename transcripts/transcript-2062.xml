FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 43/ 1969<br />
ECONOMIC CONSULTATIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Invitations have been extended to representatives of national<br />
organisations to meet with Ministers in Canberra next month.<br />
Ministers will meet three groups of representative<br />
organisations on 9 July primary industry, manufacturing industry and<br />
commerce. Invitations have also been extended for representatives of<br />
the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council and of the Export<br />
Development Council to have separate discussions with Ministers on the<br />
morning of 10 July, and for representatives of the Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions to meet Ministers that afternoon.<br />
The talks will, I am sure, be most useful in providing<br />
Ministers with the first hand views of those directly involved in commerce<br />
and industry before the Budget discussions begin.<br />
Below is the list of the national organisations invited to tak~ e<br />
part in these talks.<br />
