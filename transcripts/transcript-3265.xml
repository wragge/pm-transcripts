4AUSTRLIALÃ±<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I 14 May 1974<br />
MARITIME INDUSTRY COMMISSION OF INQUIRY<br />
The Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam, M. P.,<br />
announced today . that the Government had received the f irst<br />
report of the Maritime Industry Commission of Inquiry which was<br />
presented to the Governor-General on 6 May 1974.<br />
The first report prepared by the Commissioner, Mr M. M. Summers,<br />
covers training requirements for sea-going personnel. It consists<br />
of two parts. Part I covers principles, broad proposals and<br />
conclusions. Part II is an analysis in some detail of the issues<br />
traversed in Part I.<br />
The report highlights the shortcomings of the present<br />
curricula and the inadequate training facilities now available<br />
for sea faring personnel, especially on trading vessels.<br />
To meet the future needs for highly skilled deck, engineering<br />
and radio officers, Mr Summers has proposed the setting up of a<br />
Central Marine College. This would form part of a College of<br />
Advanced Education. Courses would be financed under the<br />
Australian Government's policy of free tertiary education.<br />
In view of the difficulties and complexities encountered on<br />
different types of vessels, the report recommends that different<br />
levels of qualifications should be necessary. To this end, the<br />
report recommends the establishment of two levels of courses for<br />
both deck and engineering officers. The duration of the courses<br />
offered ( two or three years) and their intensity would vary according<br />
to the qualifications sought. Completion of a full secondary<br />
school course would be a prerequisite for entry to the three-year<br />
college course.<br />
Academic courses would be reinforced by periods of training<br />
at sea. One two-year course is recommended for the training of radio<br />
officers. Mr Summers has recommended that existing facilities for<br />
the training of other maritime personnel ( deck and engineering ratings<br />
and catering) should be improved and enlarged. Training for these<br />
ratings should be co-ordinated by the proposed Maritime College.<br />
These facilities should be available to masters of small fishing<br />
craft and small boat and pleasure craft owners. </p>

The Prime Minister said that the Government accepted in<br />
principle the conclusions of the first report and would begin<br />
an immediate examination of the report in order to take<br />
decisions on the recommendations as soon as possible after<br />
18 May. Mr Whitlam said that arrangements had been made for the<br />
report, to be printed and published as soon as possible.<br />
