ECONOMIC SURVEY<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
Strict Embargo; not for broadcasting, Cabling or publication<br />
before midnight on Sunday, 21st February, 1960.<br />
Last week Cabinet made a general survey of the Australian economy.<br />
This is something we do at fairly frequent intervals. The previous occasion<br />
was just before Christmas. We always have before us a great deal of<br />
information on employment, production, consumption and investment expenditure,<br />
costs and prices, external trade and payments, monetary conditions<br />
and so on. After studying all these factors, we consider what, if anything,<br />
the Government should do to influence the situation in one way or another.<br />
We find a good deal in our current position that is favourable<br />
and encouraging. The employment situation is particularly strong.<br />
Industrial production continues to rise. Although there has been drought<br />
in South Australia and some other areas, rural output will, as a whole, be<br />
quite high. We are having a good export year. It looks as though the<br />
total value of exports will be well above œ E900 million. More imports are<br />
coming in and helping to increase the supply of goods and materials.<br />
But there are other tendencies which are perturbing. The most<br />
serious of these is the rise in costs and prices. In some degree this has<br />
been going on for a considerable time, but in recent months it has become<br />
faster and it is now decidedly too fast. Our aim we believe the aim of<br />
everyone and not only of the Government must be to slow it down and<br />
bring it to a halt. We say that unequivocally, because we reject the<br />
view that a rise in prices and costs is harmless so long as it keeps within<br />
" treasonable" limits. We believe that, on all counts, we are better off<br />
with a stable level of prices and costs.<br />
The rise in prices which has occurred has been due principally to<br />
causes within our own economy. For a long time past, import prices have<br />
been virtually stable. Export prices, it is true, have risen during recent<br />
months and this has probably helped to raise the local price of some<br />
articles. But in the main it has been a process of adding, one on top of<br />
the other, a great many particular increases in wages, profit margins,<br />
charges and the like, some large, some small, but all contributing to a<br />
general upward movement that has grown faster as it has gone on.<br />
Some people describe recent developments as costs inflation in<br />
contrast to so-called demand inflation.<br />
But demand has had its influence as well as costs. Up till a<br />
few months ago it was possible to say that overall supply and demand were<br />
more or less balanced. Both were increasing but apparently at about the<br />
same pace. More rece ntly, however, it has become evident that, although<br />
supplies pre still increasing, demand has started to race ahead.<br />
Various factors have contributed to this the rise in export income,<br />
public authority spending, private capital expenditures, capital inflow<br />
and so on. The combined effect of all these is now capped by the wages<br />
and margins decisions. The Basic Wage increase is estimated to add<br />
million to total wages and salaries; the margins decision a further<br />
amount not far short of œ 2100 million. These increases both add to wage<br />
costs in practically all industries and trades. They also add to<br />
demand for goods and services of most kinds.<br />
Along with this rising trend in costs and prices and in demand,<br />
there has also been a growth in the liquidity of banking and monetary<br />
conditions. It is of course a product of some of the factors which have<br />
caused incomes and expenditure to rise, and its effect is to assist and </p>
<p>2.<br />
encourage those tendencies.<br />
Therefore, it has become quite evident to us that some counteracting<br />
measures should be set in train.<br />
FIRST: As I have said, it is vital to build up resistance to<br />
the rise of costs and prices. This cannot be brought suddenly to a<br />
stop; but there must be increasing pressure against it. Especially must<br />
we avoid further large additions to the elements which enter into costs,<br />
and it is with that idea in view that the Commonwealth has decided to<br />
intervene in the current Basic Wage Case before the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. As we have often made clear, it<br />
is not our policy to oppose wage increases as such; but our strong present<br />
belief is that, having had two major wage increases within a period of a<br />
few months, the economy needs time to absorb them and to restore the equilibrium<br />
between supply and demand which has been disturbed. That is<br />
essentially the point of view we will be putting to the Arbitration<br />
Commission. We are doing this not in any spirit of opposition to the<br />
claims of wage earners, but because we believe it to be in the best interests<br />
of the economy as a whole and of all people in the community, including<br />
wage-earners. SECOND: We had before us up-to-date figures on the budgetary<br />
position, and we went very thoroughly into them. We also gave some thought<br />
to prospects for next financial year and discussed broadly what should be<br />
the aim of policy in the light of conditions we see developing. The next<br />
I eBxuadcgte t piicst uofr e coofu rwshea ts omree vemnounetsh s oro ffe xpanedn diittu riess dimfayf icbue lto r too f hatvhee alniyk elvye rycontext<br />
of economic conditions. Just the same, it is very important to<br />
think of these matters well in advance because they are necessarily affected<br />
to a considerable extent by what happens during the intervening months.<br />
In the current year we have budgeted for a deficit. But in the circumstances<br />
I have described, we propose, for the new financial year, to do all<br />
in our power to avoid any deficit finance.<br />
THIRD: Monetary conditions, as I have said, have been<br />
exceptionally liquid and have tended to become more so as the year has gone<br />
on. The Reserve Bank of Australia, which has a special responsibility in<br />
these matters, has been taking action by way of calls to Special Account,<br />
and, since the change-over in arrangements, by increasing the reserve<br />
deposit ratio to ensure at least that the liquidity of the banking system<br />
will not be increased during the year. The Government is very much in<br />
accord with and will support the policy of restraining the growth of<br />
excessive liquidity.<br />
FOURTH: Along with our review of the internal econoliy we have<br />
this week examined our external trade and payments position. It is one<br />
of considerable strength. Whilst imports have risen, exports have risen<br />
still further. We have had some success in borrowing abroad, and there<br />
has evidently been a quite large inflow of private capital. As a result<br />
we now hold considerable reserves of gold and foreign exchange and we<br />
have, in addition, our quota in the International Monetary Fund which was<br />
increased last year to 300 million dollars. This may be regarded as in.<br />
the nature of a second line reserve.<br />
Over the past couple of years we have relaxed import restrictions<br />
by successive steps and this, I am certain, has been all for the<br />
good of the economy. We have now decided to move to a position in<br />
which, as nearly as possible, imports will be unrestricted except by the<br />
Customs Tariff. It will be necessary for a time to retain some licensing<br />
arrangements on certain commodities to meet the special problems arising<br />
out of existing commitments, but that will be all the restriction that<br />
remains. </p>
<p>73. My colleague, the Minister for Trade, Mr. McEwen, will shortly<br />
announce details of what is to be done. May I recall that when, in 1952,<br />
the Government first imposed restrictions on imports, it gave an undertaking<br />
to remove them whenever our external position should permit. We<br />
have been through some fairly difficult times since then but we have<br />
always kept that undertaking steadily in view and we find it very<br />
gratifying now to have been ableto come so close to fulfilling it<br />
completely. We see these several policy decisions as a broad programme<br />
intended to provide strong and increasing resistance to those forces now<br />
operating in our economy which are tending to throw it out of balance.<br />
We feel the situation requires firm and steady pressure of this kind rather<br />
than abrupt action. Much that is going on in industry and trade and<br />
construction is undoubtedly sound and beneficial. We do not want to check<br />
or impede this. What we do want, however, is a restraint on certain<br />
developments, such as the price and cost movement, which have been tending<br />
to get out of hand and which could, unless counteracted, undermine our<br />
stability.<br />
