PRIME MINISTER'S MESSAGE TO LAOS<br />
The following is the text of a message sent today by<br />
the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam,<br />
to the Prime Minister of Laos, Prince Souvanna Phoumas<br />
" On the occasion of the signature of the protocol<br />
annexed to the Agreement on the Re-establishment of Peaoe and the<br />
Realisation of National Concord in Laos, I wish to express my<br />
warmest congratulations and best wishes to you and to the people<br />
of Laos. The Australian Government and people acknowledge with<br />
O admiration your tireless efforts to produce a settlement which<br />
will reflect the common desire of the Lao people to direct their<br />
own affairs. In particular it is our earnest hope that under<br />
your guidance the Provisional Government will pave the way for a<br />
lasting peace in which the independence, territorial integrity<br />
and neutrality of Laos will be respected by all parties and by<br />
all nations. We in Australia look forward to t1 e continuation and<br />
expansion of the warm and friendly relationn which have always<br />
existed between our two countries and I would welcome discussions sss1 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
between our representatives at a time convenient to your Government<br />
about ways in which Australia might assist the development of a<br />
prosnerous and unified Laos.<br />
Once again permit me to express my pleasure at the<br />
achievement represented by the signature of the protocol annexed<br />
to the Agreement on the Re-establishment of Peace and the<br />
Realisation of National Concord in Laos and to wish you every<br />
success in the tasks that lie ahead."; 0<br />
