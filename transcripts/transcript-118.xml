    <content><![CDATA[<p>TATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER. MR. R. G. MENZIES<br />POSITION OF CHAIRMAN OF PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD<br />The Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, announced today<br />that the chairman of the Public Service Board, Sir William<br />Dunk, had informed the Government that he wished to retire<br />from the position of chairman early in 1961. Mr. Menzies emphasised<br />that Sir William had taken this step in order to assist<br />the Government in arranging the succession to this important<br />public service office.</p>
<p><br />The Government has decided to appoint Mr F. H. Wheeler,<br />who is at present a Director of the International<br />Labour Organisation at Geneva. Before taking this appointment<br />in 1953, Mr. Wheeler was First Assistant Secretary in the<br />Department of the Treasury and one of the key Treasury advisers<br />to the Government through the War and in the Post-War<br />period. His experience with I. L. O. will be valuable in the<br />personnel administration field of the Public Service Board's<br />work. The appointment will date from January 1st, 1961,<br />Sir William Dunk, who will be 62 years of age this<br />year, joined the Public Service in 1914 and has had a distinguished<br />and varied public service career, including highly responsible<br />work in War Administration as Assistant Secretary in<br />the Treasury and Director of Reciprocal Lend Lease. Immediately<br />after the war he was appointed as head of the Department<br />of External Affairs, where he laid the administration foundations<br />for the Post-War work of the Department. Hu accepted<br />his present appointment in 1947 and has given outstanding service<br />in gearing the public service to its greatly expanded<br />Post-War tasks and in adopting a modern approach to the management<br />problems of the service.<br />Mr. Menzies said that Sir William's departure from<br />his present office would be a severe loss but his characteristically<br />public spirited attitude to the future of the sermice<br />was 1eenly appreciated by the Gyoernment. He had offered<br />to make himself available to the Board for assistance and consultation<br />during the early period of the now Chairman's a'point<br />ont, Canberra, llth October, 19 9.</p>
