    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Press Statement No 320</strong></p>
<p>I know I speak for all Australians in expressing my profound sense of sorrow at the death of Lady Kerr.</p>
<p>Australia has lost a woman of great vitality and charm, a strong and vigorous personality of high ideals and high attainment who will be sorely missed by all who knew her. Sir John Kerr has lost a loyal and devoted wife, a woman richly equipped to share with him the burdens of his high and arduous office, an office he assumed with a ready spirit of service and a full consciousness of the responsibility it imposed.</p>
<p>In the circumstances I can think of few bereavements more poignant and untimely. It is a cruel blow that within months of assuming the post of Governor-General an office he has already graced with wisdom and distinction Sir John should lose the support and companionship of Lady Kerr. The full measure of public and private grief will go out to him at this time, sustaining him in his bitter personal loss and in the onerous public duties he has undertaken for Australia and her people. I have every confidence that the memory and example of Lady Kerr will strengthen Sir John in the years ahead.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government I express my deepest sympathy to him and his family.</p>
<p>CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />9 September 1974</p>
