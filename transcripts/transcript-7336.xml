PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY -EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF THEIR MAJESTIES<br />
THE KING AND QUEEN OF SPAIN<br />
PARLIAMENT [ HOUSE 16 JUNE 1988<br />
Your Majesties<br />
Minister Distinguished Guests<br />
The Australian Government and people are honoured to welcome<br />
you to our country in our Bicentennial year.<br />
This year we are celebrating 200 years of European<br />
settlement of this continent. But it is right that today we<br />
recall that the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Harbour<br />
in 1788 was only the final link in a long chain of events,<br />
stretching over centuries, by which Australia came to the<br />
attention of the nations of Europe.<br />
Standing at the first point on that chain are the great<br />
navigators of Spain's Golden Age men such as de Quiros and<br />
Torres who explored our region in the early 1600s and whose<br />
discoveries helped open the way for the Dutch, the French<br />
and the British who followed.<br />
In 1606, it was de Quiros who, after five months at sea,<br />
made landfall in the islands of Vanuatu. He immediately<br />
claimed possession of all the lands as far south as the<br />
Pole, and he named them the Southern Land of the Holy<br />
Spirit. Your Majesties, I am relieved to know that you have not come<br />
to Australia to revive the claim made by your intrepid<br />
countryman 382 years ago!<br />
From the earliest days of the young colony of New South<br />
Wales, Spain and Spaniards exerted a direct and positive<br />
influence. For some years, the colonial currency was<br />
derived from Spanish coins of South-American silver the<br />
famous ' holey dollars'. And of course Australia's wool<br />
industry, which was and is one of our most important export<br />
earners, was derived from the merino flocks of Spain. 7 182 </p>

Perhaps Spain's most important early contribution to<br />
Australia was the inspiring role of the Benedictine Bishop<br />
Rosendo Salvado, who founded the New Norcia mission and<br />
monastery in Western Australia in the middle of the last<br />
century. He was among the first Europeans to live with<br />
Aboriginal people and to study their languages and cultures.<br />
His legacy was not only the magnificent monastery, with its<br />
important library for Australian studies, but the lesson of<br />
his compassionate and far-sighted attitude towards the<br />
Aboriginal people.<br />
Spanish settlers have arrived in Australia throughout our<br />
history, but special mention should be made of the Basques<br />
and Catalans who from the turn of the century were important<br />
participants in the development of the Queensland sugar<br />
industry.<br />
After the agony of the Spanish Civil War, Australia<br />
attracted many thousands of people from Spain seeking<br />
freedom and prosperity in a new home.<br />
Australia welcomed these new settlers, and welcomes them<br />
still, as valued fellow citizens and as integral members of<br />
our multicultural society. Spanish Australians have<br />
contributed to the arts, to agriculture including<br />
wine-making to industry, and indeed across a wide spectrum<br />
of activities. They have enriched our society.<br />
At the broader level, relations between Australia and Spain<br />
are very sound and friendly.<br />
There is much ground for hope that our two countries,<br />
although physically distant from one another, can cooperate<br />
to our mutual benefit in promoting the many values that we<br />
share. Trade is increasing steadily, as befits two economies which<br />
have complementary characteristics. We both realise the<br />
potential to increase it further. In this context I wish to<br />
extend a special welcome to the delegation of Spanish<br />
businessmen, headed by Mr Ligero, who are in Australia in<br />
conjunction with your visit.<br />
Spain has contributed generously to our Bicentennial<br />
celebrations this year. The visit of your tall ship,<br />
Juan Sebastian de Elcano, will long be remembered by<br />
Australians. Spain's participation in Expo 88 including<br />
your own presence this week at the Spanish national day<br />
has brought a new dimension to our mutual understanding.<br />
Your Majesties,<br />
I mentioned at the outset Spain's-first Golden Age, the age<br />
of the great navigators and the Conquistadors. I believe<br />
today Spain is entering a new Golden Age, making a<br />
remarkable transition to stability, harmony and democracy<br />
after 40 years of civil war followed by dictatorship. 71, 8,3~ </p>

and, in particular, in standing firmly on the side of<br />
democracy against those who sought to overthrow it, remains<br />
an inspiration to all of us.<br />
Today, Spain has the fastest growing economy in Europe and<br />
has re-entered the mainstream of the world economy through<br />
the European Community. Spain will attain the Presidency of<br />
the Community next year. It is my hope that, under Spanish<br />
leadership, the Community will renew its efforts to pursue<br />
liberalised trade policies to the benefit, not only of<br />
countries such as Australia, but also ultimately to the<br />
benefit of the EC members themselves.<br />
You have called for, and worked towards, a fairer<br />
international order, based on freedom and dignity for all<br />
mankind, for a new economic rationality which can promote<br />
the harmonious development of all nations, and for an active<br />
solidarity in reducing tensions leading to a true and just<br />
peace. In this you have the full support of Australia.<br />
In 1992 the world will be celebrating one of the major<br />
achievements of your first Golden Age, the 500th Anniversary<br />
of the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus.<br />
1992 will certainly be the year of Spain the hallmark of<br />
the new Golden Age: Barcelona will be hosting the Olympics,<br />
and Seville will host Expo 92.<br />
I am delighted to be able to announce today that Australia<br />
will be participating enthusiastically not only at<br />
Barcelona, but also at Seville.<br />
I hope, Your Majesty, that the next few years will see<br />
continuing and increased contacts between our countries,<br />
contacts based on our very many bonds and shared interests.<br />
Your visit to Australia is a positive, significant, and most<br />
welcome step in this direction. 7 1.8 / J </p>
