COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
AIJSTRAHIAN FILM DEVELOPMENT<br />
CORPORATION BILL 1970<br />
Second Reading<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates,' 5 March 1970.]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 8.00]-1 move:<br />
That the Bil be now read a second time.<br />
This Bill will fulfil the Government's undertaking<br />
to assist the Australian film industry.<br />
It provides for the establishment of an<br />
Australian Film Development Corporation<br />
which will administer a fund with<br />
an initial capital of Sim, The Corporation<br />
will make loans to film<br />
and television producers. It will be able to<br />
guarantee repayment of loans, including<br />
bank overdrafts, made to producers of Australian<br />
films. It will be able to join with<br />
producers of Australian films under<br />
arrangements which will entitle it to receive<br />
a share of the proceeds without being<br />
liable for any debts which may be incurred.<br />
It may also, subject to ministerial approval,<br />
participate in the formation of a company<br />
for the distribution of Australian films. The<br />
Corporation will seek to encourage the production<br />
and distribution of Australian films<br />
of high quality. I should perhaps say, Mr<br />
Speaker, that when I refer to films of high<br />
quality I do not confine my meaning to<br />
films of technical excellence or those with<br />
an artistic content which could win a<br />
12972/ 70 festival award, but be commercially unsuccessful.<br />
The Corporation will seek to encourage<br />
the production of films which are<br />
box office successes and which have those<br />
excellences of production, camera work and<br />
technical presentation which justify the<br />
description ' high quality'.<br />
The fund is intended for investment in<br />
films: It is not intended as a giveaway project.<br />
It indicates our optimism that such<br />
investment will be successful in all ways but<br />
it is not intended as a vehicle for underwriting<br />
the full cost of a film or films. Producers<br />
of films will still be expected to<br />
have a substantial equity in a film and to<br />
show faith in their artistic and commercial<br />
judgment, and I hope that distributors will<br />
also be prepared to invest, at their judgment,<br />
in such enterprises. We believe that<br />
after a period of time properly made investments<br />
will be returning profits to the Corporation<br />
and there will then be no need for<br />
the Government to replenish the fund each<br />
year. That is our objective and the measure<br />
of the scheme's success will be judged<br />
partly on this.<br />
So we expect profits in money terms but<br />
at least as importantly we expect profit in </p>
<p>human values. A flourishing film industry<br />
in Australia will employ talented Australian<br />
writers, artists, directors, actors, musicians<br />
and technicians. Many of them have all too<br />
often had to leave this country to pursue<br />
their chosen careers. Their talents have<br />
added distinction to the productions of<br />
other countries. But I know many of them<br />
wish to return again home. We hope that<br />
they will be able to do so as a result of<br />
the action here suggested. Further, film and<br />
television distributed throughout the world<br />
is perhaps the most effective means by<br />
which the image of a country can be projected<br />
abroad-the most effective means by<br />
which the ideas and way of life of a nation<br />
can become known throughout the world.<br />
We hope this Bill will help Australia in this<br />
way. It is now apparent that Australian interest<br />
and support is beginning to be available<br />
for local productions and it is my Government's<br />
hope that money provided by the<br />
Corporation will act as a catalyst to<br />
encourage private capital to invest in Australian<br />
productions. In other countries considerable<br />
investment in film production is<br />
forthcoming from banking and other<br />
financial institutions. Let us hope and urge<br />
that this support, along with that suppor-t<br />
from distributors and exhibitors which I<br />
have mentioned, will be forthcoming here.<br />
The corporation will consist of a chairman<br />
and four other members-each appointed for periods not exceeding 5 years<br />
but eligible for reappointment. Members<br />
will be appointed from amongst persons of<br />
standing and varied experience but without<br />
pecuniary interests in the business' of making,<br />
distributing or exhibiting films, or in a<br />
corporation carrying on such a business.<br />
The Corporation will be required to report<br />
annually to the Minister with appropriate<br />
financial statements. The Minister will be<br />
required to lay the report and financial<br />
statements, together with the report of the<br />
Auditor-General, before each House of the<br />
Parliament. It gives me great personal pleasure to<br />
introduce this Bill. It expresses the Government's<br />
belief that we should devote ourselves<br />
not only to building great new<br />
factories and smelters, not only to wresting<br />
produce and minerals from the earth of<br />
Australia, not only to material standards,<br />
but also to involvement in and encouragement<br />
and development of the Arts. The<br />
human values we will thereby nurture, the<br />
satisfaction we will offer to individual<br />
development, the improvement of the<br />
quality of life are essential for any nation<br />
if it is to merit the description ' great'.<br />
I believe this Bill will help us to attain<br />
these aims and I commend it to the House.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr Hayden)<br />
adjourned.<br />
