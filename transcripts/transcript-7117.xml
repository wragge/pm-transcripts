TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS AT AUSTRALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF COLLEGE,<br />
MT-E IZ ,-SUNDAY--5-FEBRUA-RY-19 87<br />
E__&amp;_ OEPZO-QF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Sir Joh saidthi. s mrning that atthe.--<br />
S National Party meeting this week the issue of his-leadership<br />
of that Party would come up. Do you think he has got the<br />
numbers to topple Sinclair?<br />
PM: I don't know, I have got no idea. He doesn't ring me<br />
up and tell me what is happening Ian doesn't. I would be<br />
surprised if he had.<br />
JOURNALIST: You referred to Don Grimes in your speech are<br />
you sad to be losing Don Grimes?<br />
PM: Yes, I am. He has played and enormously constructive<br />
and compassionate role but Don has thought in terms of his<br />
health he had a very severe heart attack, a bypass operation<br />
he came to the conclusion that it was probably appropriate for<br />
him to retire. And if that is his judgement about what is<br />
best for him then, of course, I entirely endorse it. But he<br />
has made an enormous contribution and I think he has left<br />
many memorials to his imagination and great administration<br />
that will last forever.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will Mr Scholes still be in the Ministry tomorrow?<br />
PM: I would think so, as I understand it.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you have resolved your differences with him?<br />
PM: It is clear that I had conversations with him but I don't<br />
conduct those conversations in public. That is a matter between<br />
Mr Scholes and myself.<br />
JOURNALIST: plant variety rights legislation. How important<br />
is that legislation for your Government?<br />
PM: It doesn't loom as number one on our priority list.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect the Left to get a place in the<br />
reshuffle tomorrow?<br />
PM: We will see when tomorrow comes. I don't canvass these things<br />
in public. The Party Room and the Cabinet Room are the appropriate<br />
place for that. We know how to handle ourselves as distinct from<br />
other pecple in politics.<br />
" Z </p>
<p>2.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you were John Howard would you get rid of<br />
Joh the same way that Bob Hawke got rid of Bill Hartley?<br />
PM: I don't want to make odious comparisons but the terror<br />
that is right across the Liberal Party and the National Party<br />
as a result of many things is fpr them to deal with. You might<br />
have noticed I have not spent a great deal of time talking about<br />
-it. Temptation has been put in my way to try and gloat and talk<br />
at length about them. I don't. I think it is a matter for them<br />
to resolve. Conservative politics in this country are in a hopeless<br />
mess-and-it-is--not-jst-because -of Joh. You -have got -to-understand--<br />
that it is not just because of Joh. They have no policies.<br />
-They_ haveno Yvision forthefuture. of.-thiscountry..... They....<br />
are status quo people who have never really had to think about<br />
whereisAustralia__ going'. _ They hate one another,. they are fighting<br />
another. In a sense that is a pity. We would be better off in this<br />
country with a reasonable Opposition. I am reconciled with myself<br />
to the fact that we haven't got that but we will go on doing the<br />
job that people want providing solid, cautious, stable government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think Joh and Andrew Peacock would make a<br />
reasonable Opposition?<br />
PM: I have said I would welcome the double P Petersen and Peacock.<br />
JOURNALIST: plans to get involved in the State by-election?<br />
PM: A State Upper House by-election? No. If there was any<br />
suggestion that that would desirable but I can't remember since I<br />
have been Prime Minister that I have been in an Upper House by-election<br />
anywhere. Why would I do that.<br />
