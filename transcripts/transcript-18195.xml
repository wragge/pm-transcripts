    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Innovation Minister Senator Kim Carr today announced that the Illawarra Region Innovation and Investment Fund was now open for business.</p>
<p>From today, businesses with innovative projects in and around Wollongong can apply for financial assistance that will help strengthen the local economy and create new high-skill high-wage job opportunities.</p>
<p>The $30 million fund is jointly funded by the Australian Government ($20 million), the NSW Government ($5 million) and BlueScope Steel ($5 million) over three years to 30 June 2014.</p>
<p>The fund will also be matched by at least $30 million in private sector investment.</p>
<p>Focussing on the manufacturing industry, the Innovation and Investment Fund will favour projects which offer long-term growth potential in order to grow the Illawarra's industry base.</p>
<p>This support will help offset the effect of BlueScope Steel's decision to de-activate one of its blast furnaces at Port Kembla, which will result in the loss of 800 permanent and 200 temporary jobs.</p>
<p>The minimum grant under the Fund is $50,000, matched dollar-for-dollar by the successful applicant. There is no maximum funding limit.</p>
<p>Funds will be available for applications received through up to three rounds. The first round opens on 18 October 2011 and closes on 16 December 2011.</p>
