    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the additional information I have regarding</p>
<p> the situation in Iraq is that since speaking to President Clinton</p>
<p> I also discussed the matter at length with the Canadian Prime Minister,</p>
<p> Mr Chretien and I will be discussing it later today with the Prime</p>
<p> Minister of New Zealand, Mrs Shipley. We are, as Australia, intensifying</p>
<p> our diplomatic activity. We'll be calling in the Iraqi Charge</p>
<p> today, to register, in the strongest possible terms, our wish that</p>
<p> this issue be settled diplomatically and that is by Iraq honouring</p>
<p> the undertakings that were part of the Gulf War settlement and allowing</p>
<p> the inspection of the sites in Iraq which are believed could house</p>
<p> the material which is so destructive and whose proliferation would</p>
<p> be so threatening to world security.</p>
<p>I'll be having some further discussion with the Chief of the</p>
<p> Defence Force this afternoon. He's, of course, been in very regular</p>
<p> discussion with the Defence Minister, Mr McLachlan, and as you all</p>
<p> know, Cabinet will be discussing the matter tomorrow. And as further</p>
<p> developments occur I will keep, not only the media but through them,</p>
<p> the Australian people fully informed of what is occurring.</p>
<p>I still remain of the view that if this matter can be settled by diplomatic</p>
<p> processes, that is clearly the best way. Nobody wants a force used.</p>
<p> Nobody wants any lives put at risk. Nobody wants the destruction of</p>
<p> civilian assets and a loss of civilian life or indeed of the lives</p>
<p> of military personnel. What is at stake is something that is more</p>
<p> than just an argument between the United States and Iraq.</p>
<p>The chemical material which is at the heart of this dispute does have</p>
<p> the potential to devastate millions of people. And no civilised country</p>
<p> can support a situation where a rogue State is able to thumb its nose</p>
<p> at the rest of the world, protect installations that might house this</p>
<p> material and thereby send a signal to the rest of the world that that</p>
<p> kind of defiant behaviour can be realised.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Australia under threat from that material, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Laurie, any country is under threat if a dictator, such as Saddam,</p>
<p> is able to protect that material and retain the potential to deliver</p>
<p> it against a neighbouring country. The idea that Australia can look</p>
<p> with equanimity at a situation where Iraq could use this kind of material</p>
<p> on a neighbouring State, with all that is involved in that, is unsustainable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will he use it against us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the important thing, in the short term, is that he has a capacity</p>
<p> to use it against neighbouring States. And if he has a capacity to</p>
<p> use it against neighbouring States and he is not denied that capacity</p>
<p> it could only be a matter time when either he or somebody else develops</p>
<p> the capacity to use it against, not just neighbouring States, but</p>
<p> other States.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think if there is to be military action against Iraq it is</p>
<p> preferable that it takes place under the aegis of the United Nations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there is, on my advice, plenty of legal United Nations authority</p>
<p> there already. Because what the United States and its allies would</p>
<p> be doing, if force becomes necessary, would be to enforce clear decisions</p>
<p> of the United Nations already.</p>
<p>I see the defence of the authority of the United Nations as a very</p>
<p> important element in this issue. It's one of the reasons, that</p>
<p> I enumerated yesterday, as to why Australia should pay very close</p>
<p> attention to President Clinton's request.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So Australia will be insisting on a further United Nations resolution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that a further United Nations resolution could be in</p>
<p> contemplation. But it is my advice and my understanding that there</p>
<p> is adequate authority anyway.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does Australia risk it's trade with Saudi Arabia and other middle</p>
<p> eastern countries if it joins a coalition that hasn't got wide</p>
<p> support?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe so. In the end, of course, you have to make a</p>
<p> balanced judgement and in the end, although trade interests are critical,</p>
<p> they are very important to us, you have to make other judgements as</p>
<p> well. But I would be optimistic that in any event trade would not</p>
<p> be effected.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, have any Australian naval elements yet been deployed</p>
<p> into the western Indian Ocean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to comment on any possible forms that our contribution,</p>
<p> if we decide on it, may take. But no authority has been given for</p>
<p> any deployment of anything.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why do you think civilised countries in Europe and elsewhere are reluctant</p>
<p> to join a military venture against Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is too early at this stage to make any conclusive judgements about</p>
<p> who will join.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, as you said earlier, if force is necessary, is it</p>
<p> your view that if Saddam Hussein persists, as he has done in the past,</p>
<p> that it will be necessary?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Paul, the intelligent, constructive thing to say is what you believe,</p>
<p> and that is that I hope he will back down and allow the inspection</p>
<p> of the sites.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But if not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope that doesn't become necessary but at the end of</p>
<p> the day it may. I mean, the whole basis of what I have been saying</p>
<p> in the last 48 hours contemplates that that may be necessary and that</p>
<p> is why President Clinton has been in touch with us because it might</p>
<p> be necessary. But he said to me on Saturday afternoon that he hoped</p>
<p> it wasn't and he still entertained some optimism that it may</p>
<p> not be necessary. There are some signs that it may not be necessary</p>
<p> but they are not terribly strong at the present time. I hope it is</p>
<p> not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what do you know of this chemical material, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It has quite diabolical effects on the nervous system. It has very</p>
<p> destructive effects on the human body. I mean, it is the most appalling</p>
<p> material. And you have got to remember that you are dealing with somebody</p>
<p> who has demonstrated in the past that he is not reluctant to use material</p>
<p> that most people regard as absolutely beyond the pall against his</p>
<p> own civilian population.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If you send Australian personnel there, how will they be protected</p>
<p> from that material?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think that is a sort of question, Laurie, that I will answer at</p>
<p> the appropriate time and that is if and when a decision is taken.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what do you say to people like Anthony Albanese who says</p>
<p> we shouldn't get involved in the war and will only hurt Iraqi</p>
<p> civilians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I note the very positive comments that have been made by Mr Beazley</p>
<p> and by Mr Brereton.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the comments of General Norman Schwarzkopf today, who believes</p>
<p> that a bombing mission wouldn't achieve its end and has cautioned</p>
<p> that it could lead America into a Vietnam type situation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have long since learnt, Paul, in these sorts of situations to see</p>
<p> the totality of the comments rather than just those that have been</p>
<p> reported. Reported by other media, that is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will we consider making any representations to the Saudis over their</p>
<p> refusal of air fields to the United States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't have that in contemplation at the present. But</p>
<p> I don't want to draw the line on anything at the moment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do your talks with the Canadians and New Zealanders indicate there</p>
<p> may be a joint operation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've spoken to the Canadian Prime Minister. I haven't</p>
<p> spoken to Mrs Shipley yet. We had a very general discussion about</p>
<p> the whole issue, that is Mr Chretien and myself. And the question</p>
<p> of how our participation and the structure of the operation, how that</p>
<p> would all unfold, is not something that I want to speculate about</p>
<p> at the moment. The situation is that Cabinet will consider it tomorrow</p>
<p> and if and when such a decision is taken then I'll have something</p>
<p> more to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does the probability that the coalition, in this effort, would be</p>
<p> a lot smaller than the one in 1991 increase the likelihood that Australia's</p>
<p> military role will have to be larger and more active than it was in</p>
<p> Â‘91?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is getting into the area of speculating on the assumption that</p>
<p> we've taken a particular decision and I'm not going to do</p>
<p> that at the moment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Canada inclined to help?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's for Canada to say what Canada is going to do. That's</p>
<p> a matter for the Canadian Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Who will see the Iraqi Charge this afternoon, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the head of the Foreign Affairs Department.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sir, can I ask you about a couple of other issues in case you have</p>
<p> to dash off. Has Mr Zammit notified you today that he plans to resign</p>
<p> from the Liberal Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he say why and what's your reaction to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's about airport noise. And I think, with great respect,</p>
<p> he's being unreasonable and he's not serving the interests</p>
<p> of his electorate. Because aircraft noise over the electorate of Lowe</p>
<p> is a lot less now than what it was in March of 1996.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that damaging to the Party and the Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think given the insubstantial basis of the resignation, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be running a candidate for Liberal Party, in Lowe...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will the Liberal Party be running a candidate in Lowe at the next</p>
<p> election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Well, that is a matter for the organisation, but I would expect</p>
<p> that the organisation would elect to do so.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that Mr Zammit has enhanced his chances as running as</p>
<p> an Independent rather than has a Liberal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we have your comment on the death of Maurie Rudd, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I was very sorry to hear of Maurie's death. He's had</p>
<p> a very long and courageous battle against cancer. I met him last year</p>
<p> when he led a taskforce of steel delegates to see me following the</p>
<p> BHP closure in Newcastle. And I was very impressed with him as a union</p>
<p> leader and as a great fighter for the interests of the Hunter. And</p>
<p> I remember very vividly calling on him in his hospital at the John</p>
<p> Hunter Hospital and in the company of his two children. Talking to</p>
<p> him and then despite his obvious discomfort he showed a great deal</p>
<p> of spirit and an enormous amount of strength. And to his son and daughter</p>
<p> I extend my sympathy. It's been a very sad time for them. They</p>
<p> lost their mother not so long ago. And I think he represented the</p>
<p> very finest traditions of union leadership and the spirit of the Hunter</p>
<p> Valley. And the people of Newcastle owe a great deal to him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you another question on Iraq. Will you reconvene</p>
<p> Parliament if you make a decision to send troops to the Gulf, as Bob</p>
<p> Hawke did in 1991?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would expect that there will be, and I can say now, there will be</p>
<p> adequate opportunity for parliamentary debate when the Parliament</p>
<p> resumes. You've got to bear in mind that Parliament is due to</p>
<p> sit in, I think, three weeks from today. And I think it's, when</p>
<p> you look at the various timetables, and I'm not going to get</p>
<p> precise, that will allow a situation where there is adequate parliamentary</p>
<p> debate. I did check the time-line last time. The actual decision to</p>
<p> commit was made before Parliament had its debate and a resolution</p>
<p> was presented by Mr Hawke seeking parliamentary endorsement. And I</p>
<p> can say now, I will certainly allow a full parliamentary debate on</p>
<p> the issue. And I say again that I will ensure that the Opposition</p>
<p> is fully briefed on all aspects of the issue. I spoke to Mr Beazley</p>
<p> on Saturday evening and I'm arranging today for Mr Beazley to</p>
<p> be briefed by a senior officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p> about the background to the issue. I've also indicated to him,</p>
<p> through his Chief of Staff, that he'll be notified of the Cabinet</p>
<p> decision tomorrow before any announcement is made. It's important,</p>
<p> on these issues, that the Opposition be fully involved and treated</p>
<p> with all courtesies and be given the maximum degree of information</p>
<p> as is appropriate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just to clarify, Prime Minister. Are you saying you don't expect</p>
<p> any action for three weeks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not saying that at all. I'm just saying that given</p>
<p> that Parliament is resuming in three weeks, I don't think the</p>
<p> issue, if there were a decision taken for Australian involvement and</p>
<p> if there were action including that involvement, I don't think</p>
<p> that issue would be ancient history by the time Parliament resumes.</p>
<p> In other words, I don't think at the moment there's a case</p>
<p> for bringing forward the resumption of Parliament. But I do assure</p>
<p> people that we will have a full and adequate debate on the issue if</p>
<p> there is an Australian involvement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the ANZ job ads series has been out today and shows</p>
<p> a six per cent fall in January. The ANZ Bank is saying this is probably</p>
<p> the first impact of Asia. Is that consistent with the information</p>
<p> that the Government's getting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not. I think it's just too early to make that sort</p>
<p> of judgement. And the material that we're getting and the surveys</p>
<p> are going in different directions. You had that very bullish survey</p>
<p> from ACCESS, what, 10 days ago. You've had some very strong surveys</p>
<p> by the ACCI. You've had a couple going, not so bullish, going</p>
<p> in the other direction. It's just too early to make a judgement</p>
<p> about what's going to happen. Our best advice is that although</p>
<p> there's obviously going to be some flow through, the domestic</p>
<p> economy is still extremely strong and that employment growth has been</p>
<p> very strong. And there's a great deal of confidence around, domestically,</p>
<p> about the future of the Australian economy.</p>
