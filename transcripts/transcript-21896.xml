    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 16 September this year, Papua New Guinea will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its independence. The Governor-General will represent Australia at the celebrations.</p>
<p>To mark this momentous occasion in Papua New Guinea's history and Australia's role in bringing independence to fruition, I am pleased to announce the following Australian contribution towards the anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will fund the refurbishment of the National Library of Papua New Guinea located in Port Moresby. The library was Australia's original gift to Papua New Guinea on independence in 1975. The refurbishment will include the maintenance of the building's infrastructure to ensure the continuing protection of the library's collection of rich and rare material on the early development of Papua New Guinea. We will also help increase linkages between the National Library and similar institutions in Australia. This will reflect Australia's strong support for Papua New Guinea's growth as a nation as well as the closeness and importance of our bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>Australia will also provide financial assistance for an exhibition rugby league match to be played in Port Moresby on Sunday 18 September.  The match will be between the Papua New Guinea national team (The Kumuls) and an Australian Prime Minister's XIII comprised of players from those National Rugby League (NRL) teams that are not involved in the September NRL finals series.  The Australian team will be coached by rugby league legend Mal Meninga, with another great of the game, Brad Fittler, as his assistant.  In addition to the match, team members will use their visit to spread key messages about the importance of combating HIV/AIDS and violence against women in Papua New Guinea. I have asked the Hon Mal Brough MP, Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, to represent me at the match.</p>
<p> Australia and Papua New Guinea have been close friends for many years. Australia's contribution towards Papua New Guinea's 30th anniversary celebrations reflects that friendship and the confidence that it will continue long into the future.</p>
