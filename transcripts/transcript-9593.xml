PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, HYATT HOTEL, CANBERRA, 17 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
J: Prime Minister have you wimped it on the Republic?<br />
PM: Well, no. Well given that I was the first one in Australian public life to<br />
champion it at a Federal election, I am certainly going to continue this<br />
change. But, again, the Government has been rather occupied with<br />
the Budget and other things so that, you know, merchant bankers and<br />
investors have more time on their hands than Prime Ministers and<br />
Treasurers. So we will get around to it in due course.<br />
J: When will we see the preferred option?<br />
PM: Well not so far away.<br />
J: When, before an election?<br />
PM: Well not so far away, it will certainly be before an election.<br />
