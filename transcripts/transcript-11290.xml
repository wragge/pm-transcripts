   The New South Wales Labor Premier Bob Carr has completely undercut Kim Beazley's<br />
   promise to hold a second referendum for a directly elected president if<br />
   the Yes vote wins next Saturday.</p>
<p>  Mr Carr, the most senior and successful Labor leader in the country, has<br />
   flatly opposed any suggestion of a directly elected presidency.</p>
<p>  In the process he has exposed Mr Beazley's humbug.</p>
<p>  His strong opposition reinforces the point that if the Yes vote wins on<br />
   Saturday there will be no second bite of the republican cherry. The parliamentary<br />
   appointment model will be there for good.</p>
<p>  Mr Beazley's panicky opportunism has been starkly revealed by the NSW Premier's<br />
   stance.</p>
<p>  The promise of "Yes and more" injected into the debate at the<br />
   eleventh hour is a complete illusion. If the Yes vote wins on Saturday there<br />
   will be overwhelming opposition within all political parties to any move<br />
   toward a directly elected president.</p>
<p>  Bob Carr has had the courage to call it as it is.</p>
