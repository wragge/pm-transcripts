FOR PRESS P. M. No. 82/ 1966<br />
U. S. PRESIDENT'S TRIBUTE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Hnlt, today<br />
released the text of a message he has received from<br />
President Johnson. The message reads<br />
" The courage of Australian men and the<br />
skill of Australian arms have once again been<br />
demonstrated on the field of battle.<br />
Yesterday's engagement evokes the<br />
admiration of all who treasure bravery arnd<br />
the gratitude of all who prize the just cause<br />
for which we fight in Vie tNam.<br />
We mourn with you those brave men who<br />
were lost and pray for the quic-k recovery of<br />
those who were wounded.<br />
Please extend my commendation to the<br />
courageous officers and men of the Australian<br />
forces in Viet Nam.<br />
When you were here, I said: ' When a<br />
fight comes looking for you, it is good to have<br />
Australians standing and fighting by your side.'<br />
The Viet Cong know today better than before<br />
what I meant.<br />
' With warm personal iega rds.<br />
LYNDON 3. JOHNSON." 1<br />
