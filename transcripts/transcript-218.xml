    <content><![CDATA[<p>".<br />By this method, it was thought, the evil results of competitive borrowing<br />would be eliminated and the national credit backing would improve the<br />prospects of effective loan raising.</p>
<p>8.<br />This system worked in strict accordance with its terms for a<br />considerable time, I can well remember, for example, that in the years<br />immediately preceding the second World War it was the practice for the<br />Commonwealth Bank, as it was then constituted, to underwrite the loan<br />programme. The Prime Minister and Federal Treasurer would meet the State<br />Treasurers; discussion would occur; there would be argument as to whether<br />the borrowing programme ( believe-it or not!) should be 120m. or œ E22m.;<br />constant reference wa's made to the Commonwealth Bank to see how much it was<br />prepared to underwrite. In the upshot a figure say of œ E21m, would be arrived<br />at; it became the borrowing programme; the success of the programme was<br />assured by the underwriting; the next business, and the important business<br />of the Loan Council, was to divide up, what Sir Thomas Playford nowadays<br />calls " the turkey"; whereupon each State Government representative would<br />go away to work this into his Budget proposals for the forthcoming financial<br />year. Though, after the war, underwriting ceased to be the rule, it<br />still remained true that the prime business of the Loan Council was to<br />discuss how much money could be borrowed on reasonable terms and conditions.<br />There was no question of the Commonwealth underwriting the programme, and<br />therefore programmes were fairly realistically arrived at. But by the<br />time I came back into office myself, at the end of 1949, it was becoming<br />increasingly clear that instead of the depressed circumstances which some<br />people had anticipated the country was on the verge of a great expansionist<br />movement. This involved not only very high demands on<br />for private capital expansion, but equally, and no less<br />growing demand for public works which would provide the<br />for private capital expansion. private capital<br />importantly, a<br />essential foundation<br />While this growing demand for capital works programmes on<br />behalf of governments was manifesting itself, it became at the same time<br />clear that the competing demands of enormous expansion in both the public<br />and the private sector limited the amount which could reasonably be<br />expected to be borrowed by Governments. The Commonwealth Government therefore,<br />without obligation, but in order to meet the realistic economic needs of the<br />country, adopted for the first time the practice of aiding the loanraisings<br />by adding to them, where they fell short of the programme, funds<br />from Commonwealth sources. On one or two occasions this was done by what<br />was a virtual underwriting of the programme by the Commonwealth. In more<br />recent times there has not been a formal underwriting but if and when the<br />State representatives have adopted a public works programme which, in the<br />view of the Commonwealth, is a reasonable one under all the circumstances,<br />the Commonwealth has made payments to the States on account of the programme<br />at equal monthly amounts for the first six months, with an indication<br />that the position will then be reviewed. In point of fact, however, the<br />,4</p>
<p>9.<br />monthly payments have been made throughout the financial year without<br />reduction, so that in substance the States, when the works programme<br />has been approved of as a financial total, have had some assurance<br />that the money will be available to them.<br />That this procedure alters the nature of the Financial Agreement<br />is, of course, quite clear. No longer is the question: ' How much money<br />can be borrowed on reasonable terms and conditions? but ' How much<br />money is reasonably needed for an attainable works programme?' In<br />consequence the Commonwealth has, year by year, accepted additional<br />liabilities out of Commonwealth funds, sometimes on a very great scale.<br />Though this practice has been of great advantage to State governments<br />and was intended to be so, it has, of course, led to a state of affairs<br />in which the States are increasingly dependent upon Commonwealth action<br />for the carrying out of their works programmes.<br />I confess that I regard this as another of the centralizing,<br />or centripetal, developments in our own Federal Constitution. But I equally<br />confess that I can see no way by which it could have been avoided, though<br />it has involved the Commonwealth in paying for its own Works programme<br />out of revenue. There are financial purists who take pleasure in saying that,<br />it is quite unsound to carry capital works on revenue account. That may,<br />in strict theory, be right. But ' needs must when the devil drives'. if<br />the Commonwealth had not been prepared, at some political inconvenience,<br />to carry its own works programmes on revenue account, there would have<br />been two conse~ quences: one, that the States would have received no<br />subvention for their own works programmes out of Commonwealth revenues; and<br />two, that the Commonwealth works programmes would have been considerably<br />reduced. What this could have meant in terms of the non-performance of<br />the Snowy Mountains Scheme and a considerable damping down of expansion in<br />the postal and telegraphic services, I leave to the imagination of those<br />who are familiar with these problems.<br />Another provision of the Commonwealth Constitution under which<br />the original Federal balance has been changed, is that contained in Section<br />96 of the Constitution. That Section provides that:<br />During a period of ten years after the establishment of the<br />Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise<br />provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to<br />any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament<br />thinks fit." It may very well be the case, particularly having regard to<br />what I may call its initial character, that the draftsmen of the</p>
<p>Constitution felt that such grants by the Commonwealth of financial<br />assistance might become necessary having regard to some purely temporary<br />causes during the period of Federal transition. But the Section has<br />continued to operate, and nobody supposes that it will be changed.<br />There was in some minds a feeling that Section 96 provided<br />for the making of a grant but did not enable the Commonwealth to attach<br />to the grant conditions which amounted to the exercise by the Commonwealth<br />of a legislative authority not otherwise accorded to it.<br />In the case of Victoria v. the Commonwealth in 38 C. L. R.,<br />p. 399, I myself, as Counsel, made a valiant but quite futile attempt to<br />persuade the High Court that this was the position. The case concerned<br />the Federal Aid Roads Act of 1926. My argument-in that case, on behalf<br />of the State of Victoria, was that the Federal Aid Roads Act was " invalid<br />because it was a law relating to road-making and not a law for granting<br />financial aid to the States." I therefore argued that it wasn't warranted<br />by either Section 96 or by the legislative powers granted by Section 51<br />of the Constitution. I argued that one must look at the substance of the<br />Act, and that, so regarding it, it was one to provide for the construction<br />of roads, a matter over which the Commonwealth had no general jurisdiction.<br />This somewhat engaging argument was dismissed by the High<br />Court quite unanimously, in the following emphatic words:<br />it The Court is of opinion that the Federal Aid Roads Act<br />is a valid enactment. It is plainly warranted by the provisions of<br />Section 96 of the Constitution, and not affected by those of Section<br />99 or any other provisions of the Constitution, so that exposition is<br />unnecessary. i<br />This made it clear that, provided that a law is one providing<br />for a grant to a State, the terms which may surround that grant are matters<br />entirely within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. This<br />view has subsequently been judicially confirmed.<br />This broad interpretation of the power has, beyond question,<br />been of considerable practical value to the-States. A very recent example<br />is the system of State grants for Universities made by the Commonwealth<br />Parliament. This is a development which probably was not foreseen in<br />1901: it is one which has affected what was then thought to be the<br />Federal distribution of powers between the national Parliament and the<br />Parliaments of the States. But it undoubtedly has had the effect of<br />saving the State Universities from financial disaster. The whole matter<br />is a very good illustration of how something which was not'anticipated in<br />the Constitution when it was first enacted can come into existence by<br />judgicial interpretation and the inexorable demands of new circumstances.</p>
<p>The institution and subsequent maintenance of what is called<br />Uniform Taxation ( though it applies to Income Tax ( individual and company)<br />only) also deserves special though necessarily inadequate mention. That<br />it has profoundly affected Australian federalism is beyond question, though<br />it turns upon no formal constitutional amendment whatever.<br />The scheme, which involved an Income Tax Assessment Act, an<br />Income Tax Act, an Income Tax ( War-time Arrangements) Act, and a State<br />Grants ( Income Tax Reimbursement) Act, was introduced in 1942 as a wartime<br />measure, though in the nature of things it was bound to continue<br />while high war-caused rates of tax continued. Its validity was challenged<br />in the High Court, but was upheld ( 65 C. L. R. 373) under the taxation power,<br />the defence power, and Section 96. That decision has more recently<br />been upheld on the points of substance.<br />The judicial arguments made it clear that the Commonwealth's<br />taxation power, with or without the Grants power under Section 96, is<br />legally capable of being used " so as to make the States almost completely<br />dependent, financially and therefore generally, upon the Commonwealth"<br />( see per Latham C. J. 65 C. L. R. at p. 429). This means that to preserve<br />the true nature of Australian federalism certain questions became vitally<br />important. As the high war-time level of income taxes subsided, would it<br />become practicable to restore to the States the use of their own income<br />taxing powers? Could the growing Commonwealth financial power be kept<br />in check by a public political consciousness of the need for maintaining<br />a high degree of State autonomy for State purposes? At the same time,<br />could we avoid carrying State-consciousness to a point at which the true<br />essence of the necessary national spirit became weakened?<br />The restoration of State taxing powers has been debated several<br />Limes in Premiers' Conferences, and many more times in other political<br />circles. There has been no positive evidence that most of the State<br />Governments really want a return of taxing powers on terms which would be<br />reasonably acceptable to the Commonwealth and still permit it to discharge<br />its admittedly major responsibilities. Yet a return of taxing powers by<br />unilateral Commonwealth action would be pregnant with disaster if a<br />genuine agreement between Commonwealth and States were not arrived at.<br />At a Premiers' Conference on this great matter, which I specially convened<br />in 1953, there was a close discussion, which left it, if I may speak<br />quite frankly, most unlikely that Uniform Tax would end unless there<br />arose a revolutionary change in the opinions of governments.<br />Yet, of the Premiers, two, from Western Australia and Tasmania,<br />declared unequivocally that they did not want their income taxing powers<br />restored; one, New South Wales, requested that the Commonwealth should</p>
<p>12.<br />reduce its taxes by twice the amount of the tax reimbursement an obviously<br />fantastic proposal which was only another way of saying that Uniform Tax<br />should continue; another South Australia, was prepared to accept a<br />reduction of over œ. 60m. more than the Tax Reimbursement!. Queensland<br />pointed out, which was obvious enougjh, that as its taxing capacity was<br />low and its pre-war State income taxc had been very high, it was better<br />off under Uniform Tax, and would, ihould State tax be restored, either<br />need to impose State tax at a much higher rate than New South Wales or<br />Victoria, or would need a special annual grant from the Commonwealth under<br />Section 967-which would cut across the principle of matching power and<br />responsibility. There was another grave question that of Company Tax. At<br />a time when the rapid development of Australian industry is extending the<br />operation of companies and is producing inter-state operations on the<br />pIa rt of more and more of them, there is much to be said for a Uniform<br />Company Tax imposed by one authority. The position would be both<br />chaotic and discouraging if the one company found itself taxed twice on<br />the same earnings once by the State of its residence, and once by the<br />State of the source of revenue.<br />This great controversy does appear to have been put to rest,<br />for six years at any rate, by the conference of Commonwealth and State<br />Ministers of June 1959, where a new Tax Reimbursement formula was worked<br />out, accepted on all sides, and by agreement made to apply for six years.<br />You may well think that the end result of this examination is<br />untidy, inconclusive, and unsatisfyi ng and perhaps self contradictory.<br />Federation in Australia is a good thing, and should be<br />preserved; but<br />The centralising forces acquire strength every year.<br />Constitutional problems attract little public attention except<br />during the actual currency of a campaign; and even then there tends to be<br />rather more heat than light. This is not surprising. Federalism is<br />in its very nature legalistic. A proper understanding of it involves a<br />considerable intellectual exercise in both synthesis and analysis. The<br />very notion of Federal and State Governments elected by and dealing with the<br />same people, but with sovereign powers divided between them according to the<br />terms of a legal instrument as interpreted from time to time by the judiciary,<br />is complex. Many try to understand it, and confess failure. Many,<br />perhaps wisely, do not even try. This is basically, the reason why<br />Constitutional Amendment by popular vote has proved so difficult.</p>
<p>13.<br />The electors have voted fairly consistently against any<br />formal addition to the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, but to an<br />overwhelming extent they accept those changes in financial power which<br />have substantially the same effect.<br />There is a marked and growing tendency to look to the<br />Commonwealth Government to accept financial responsibility for the performance<br />of State powers by the State Governments and even for the<br />functions of local governing bodies created by the States for local purposes.<br />Yet at the same time there are inadequate signs of a united national spirit.<br />I venture to doubt whether Uniform Tax will ever be changed.<br />Except in one State, Victoria, I have seen no evidence of a real desire<br />to re-create two independent direct taxing authorities. Most people,<br />I think, feel that we have learned to live with " Uniform Tax", and that<br />to put the constitutional clock back to a time before the second World<br />War is not feasible. If this is true, as I fear it is, Australian federalism has<br />already sustained a great change which affects the originally designed<br />balance or distribution of powers. Centripetal movements are not likely<br />suddenly to halt themselves. Except in the unlikely event that there<br />is a wide public demand for confining financial demands upon the<br />Commonwealth to those matters which fall within Commonwealth legislative<br />power, and for re-establishing the independent taxing power and responsibility<br />of State Governments, the centripetal movement must be accepted. If this<br />be the position, we are confronted by two tasks of great practical<br />importance. One is to see that the growing financial power of the Commonwealth<br />is exercised in such a way as to permit the States to discharge<br />their own constitutional duties. The other is to abandon, not the<br />principles of federalism, but that excessive emphasis upon purely local<br />rights which is proving such an impediment to the creation of a truly<br />national sentiment and pride.</p>
