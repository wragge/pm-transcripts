FOPXRS SDHEPEA RTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS<br />
FOR THE PRESS CANBERRA<br />
FELEA SED ONLY IN CANBERRA PR 131 gtQ<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for External Affairs.<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Menzies,<br />
made the ftll1mwing statement on international affairs by leave in the<br />
House of Representatives tnday<br />
I do not propose in this statement to endeavour to deal with the<br />
whole field of foreign affairs. Time would not pemit of such an oxercise.<br />
But I think it might be useful to say something about certain of the key<br />
points and to isolate, for purposes of discussion, some of the points of<br />
danger. There is really not very much new to be said about the relations<br />
between the Soviet Union and the Western World though I will take the<br />
opp-ortunity of setting down something about the great problem of disarmamcnt.<br />
I think that it has been the general view of Honourable M embers that some<br />
good and perhaps much good might come of a Summit Meeting. As we know,<br />
this failed to materialise in M4ay, since when there havo been allegations<br />
and counter-allegations for the reascn of the failure. I remain optimistic<br />
about the chances of securing a Summit Meeting. It will be remembered that<br />
when I moved in that direction at the recent General kssembly, I was<br />
supported by threo of the four nuclear powers United States, Great<br />
Britain and France and not opposed the fourth the Soviet Union.<br />
After these events, Mr. Khrushchev told me personally that he<br />
favoured a Summit Meeting and indicated that he thought that first and<br />
foremost disarmament and then other matters such as the Berlin problem,<br />
the position of Germany, and nuclear tests could isefully be discussed. </p>
<p>Page 2.<br />
Not one of us will suppose that a Siunmit Meeting could solve all<br />
the outstanding problems; but we would hope that it could make a<br />
start and in that way begin to melt the ice which clogs up<br />
international relations so much.<br />
Meanwhile, within the Communist world itself, there are<br />
clear signs of strain between tho Soviet Union and Communist China.<br />
It seems clear that they do not entirely agree on broad communist<br />
policy. The Soviet Union has adopted the policy of peaceful coexistence,<br />
meaning by this, to be perfectly plain about it, that it<br />
does not desire to resort to war as the direct instrument for<br />
forwarding the Communist cause, but that it prefers the weapons<br />
of propaganda, tied economic aid, and internal subversion. It appears<br />
that Communist China on the other hand is disposed to reject the<br />
idea of pdaceful co-existence and to pursue the classical Communist<br />
belief that in the struggle against capitalism, violence remains<br />
the vital instrument.<br />
Mr. Uren. Who said that?<br />
Mr. Menzies. I said it just now. When I make a reference<br />
to the Communists there are always one or two honourable members whom<br />
I do not expect to agree with me. Most people will, however.<br />
A Meeting of Communist Parties was recently held in Moscow<br />
at which we assume, and indeed have reason to believe, that an<br />
attempt was made to resolve these disagreements. Tho official<br />
communique of course says nothind of disagrooeements, but such in( icA-ti', n:<br />
as we have suggest that the Sino-Soviet differences may not have bacn<br />
resolved. Having said this, I simply indicate that in thc course cf<br />
my present statement I will say something about developments in Afric.;,<br />
with particular reference to Nigeria, the Congo, and South Africa;<br />
something about the two immediate trouble spots in South-East Asias<br />
Laos and South Vietnam; and something about the position of West<br />
Now Guinea where potentially dangerous incidents appear to be cithtr<br />
threatened or actually occurring. </p>
<p>Page 3.<br />
NEW AFRICAN~ COUNTRIES<br />
There hasp in the course of this year, been a remarkable<br />
development of new independent nations in Africa, most of whom have<br />
already been admitted to the membership of the United Nations. We<br />
genuinely welcome these new nations and look -forwarf. to devc-lop-ing<br />
and maintaining with them happy and helpful relations. With many of<br />
them, of course, we have had only the slightest of contact; hut our<br />
knowledge of them will grow either through the United Nations or<br />
ly<br />
direct/ as the years go on. We have, of course, High Commissioners<br />
in Ghana and Nigeria, the two Commonwealth countries. We have also<br />
* veen represented at Independence Celebiations in such countries as<br />
Qameroun, Togo, Somalia, the Congo Republic, Mauritania and Malagasy.<br />
The newest Commonwealth country, Nigeria, seems to me to<br />
afford a splendid examplo of how self-government should be achieved.<br />
It is a large country, the most populous of the African nations.<br />
It has the advantage of being led by men of uncommon training and<br />
distinction. It is noteworthy that already a Nigerian, the Economic<br />
Minister, has been chosen as Chairman of the United Nations Reconciliation<br />
Commission to go to the Congo. Nigeria has been moving by stages<br />
towards complete self-government over a period of years and has therefore<br />
developed an efficient administrative ma-chine. I believe that it<br />
will serve as a groat stabilising influence in a continent which is<br />
as yet unhappilyv7dxed ' by some internal conflict. I have in mind, of<br />
course, the tragic events which have occurred in the Congo to which I<br />
shall direct some specific attention a little later. But before doing<br />
so I would like to offer one or two, perhaps trite, remarks about<br />
most of the new African nations.<br />
They have gained political independence which is a proud<br />
and dignified state of life. But some of them at least are not yet<br />
economically independent. This presents the world with a problem,, the<br />
solution of which will call for wise and generous statesmanship. </p>
<p>Page 4.<br />
True political independence must be built on sound economic<br />
foundations; otherwise the nation may incur the risk of social discontent<br />
and disorder and perhaps invite unwelcome and undesirable<br />
intervention from outside. Such countries will need substantial<br />
economic and technical help to develop their economies and to<br />
strengthen their administrative system. lid of this kind should<br />
be available " without strings". It would be offensive to these new<br />
nations to treat them as pawns in an international contest or as<br />
destined to pass into one orbit or another. Their independence must<br />
be genuine and the judgments they form on international relations or<br />
on association with other countries must be their own. So far the<br />
Australian Government is making some contribution through the United<br />
Nations Technical Assistance Programmes which are being substantially<br />
increased, through other existing international programmes, and through<br />
the International Dank. In addition, we have already offered a<br />
number of fellowships and scholarships to African countries. A<br />
special course of foreign service training has been in progress during<br />
the past year in which young men from Ghana, Sierra Leone, Malaya<br />
and the West Indies have taken part. Commonwealth Finance Ministers<br />
decided in September to establish a specil Commonwealth schome for<br />
help to Commonwealth countries. Naturally the details of this scheme<br />
are not yct fully worked out.<br />
Time will not pernit me to speculate about future develcpnorts<br />
of nationhood in Africa though it is, of course, well known th'. t<br />
political independence is not far off for Sierra Leone, Tanganyika,<br />
Uganda and Kenya. I have learned today that the oon etitubicnal rcvio, 4<br />
conference of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland has just<br />
opened in London under the chairmanship of Mr. Macmillan. This<br />
conference will have the advantage of tho patient and far-reaching,<br />
examination recently conducted by the Monckton Commission. </p>
<p>G. Page<br />
I now turn to the Congo. The situation in the Congo is still<br />
confused, difficult and dangerous. In his Annual Report to the United Nations,<br />
the Secretary-General said that the United Nations had a duty by " preventive<br />
diplomacy" that is his phrase to localise conflicts and to establish its<br />
presence in areas where there was a " power vacuum" also his phrase and<br />
where attempts by East or West to establish their influence would risk conflict.<br />
By July such a situation arose in the Congo where the Belgian<br />
transfer of power was fillowed by violent disorders. The Congolese Government<br />
asked the United Nations to intervene to assure order, to supervise the<br />
withdrawal of the Belgians and to give material aid.<br />
The Security Council on July 14 called on the Government of<br />
Belgium to withdraw its forces and gave a mandate to the Secretary-General<br />
to provide the Congo with military assistance until the National Security<br />
Forces might be able fully to meet their tasks. Later the Council unanimously<br />
paid tribute to the work of the Secretary-General. On August 9, it confirmed<br />
his authority while re-affirming that the United Nations force in the Congo<br />
would not be a party to any internal conflict, constitutional or otherwise.<br />
In the result, the United Nations has in fact been acting as a<br />
stabilising f&amp; rco. As Honourable Mimbers will recall, this was<br />
not to Ar Khrushchev's liking. By mid-September he habegun bitter<br />
attacks -n United Nations operations in the Congo. In spite of this<br />
a Special Session of the General Assembly by a vote of 70 to nil, with<br />
only the Soviet Bloc abstaining, fully supported the mandate given by<br />
the Security Council. ' In spite of this overwhelming vote, the Soviet<br />
Union has continued to attack the Secretary-General and has refused to<br />
pay its proper share of the cost cf the operations. The real reason for this<br />
Soviet attitude is not that the Secretary-General has acted under Western<br />
influence he has been notably independent but that the United<br />
Nations has shown in the Congo that it can bring together an effective<br />
force. </p>
<p>1' agea 6<br />
By preventing chaos it has been a serious obstacle to Communist<br />
ambitions. The United Nations is, of course., not the only means of<br />
solving domestic disorder which a State itself cannot settle.<br />
There may be occasions when a State may prefer to invoke the help<br />
of its neighbours or look to more distant friends for help in<br />
dealing with internal problems just as it is entitled to request<br />
support in its exercise of its inherent right of self-defence.<br />
But in the Congo, memories of colonial status are recent<br />
and neighbouring countries find themselves called upon to devote<br />
most of their resources to their own urgent development. If therefore<br />
in the case of the Congo we are to avoid a contest between<br />
opposing groups for influence through aid programmes, clearly all<br />
aid should be channelled through the United Nations.<br />
The political and constitutional situation within the<br />
Congo is still most unsettled. I will just mention one or two<br />
striking aspects of it.<br />
First, there is the position of Mr. Lumuinba who was<br />
Prime Minister when the Congo received its independence, but was<br />
subsequently dismissed by President Kasavubu. As Honourable Members<br />
are aware, the position of Mr. Kasavubu has been recognised by the<br />
seating of his delegation in the General Assembly by 53 votes,<br />
including our own, to 24. The persunaj. fate of Mr. Lumumba, who is<br />
now under arrest, appears to be at present a matter of great uncertainty<br />
techrnicallY at rmy ratethough<br />
he is still a Deputy in the Congolese Parliament.<br />
Second, the rmy Chief of Staff, Colonel Mobutu) proclaimed<br />
that is his wcrd<br />
the temporary " neutralisation" pf the Congolese Parliament and its<br />
political leaders and the establishment by him of a College of<br />
Commissioners to administer the country pending the restoration of<br />
more normal government.<br />
Third, there is the position of Mr. Tshombe, Prime Minister<br />
of Kabanga Province, who does not accept -the authority of Leopoldville<br />
but who, we hope, would co-operate in a United Congo, which badly<br />
needs the economic strength and resources of 1ataaga if it is to become<br />
self supporting. There have been similar tendencies in Kasai </p>
<p>Pare 7.<br />
also<br />
province which i' a relatively rich area.<br />
There are hopes that the position may begin to clear.<br />
The General Assembly has appealed to the Congo to seek a speedy<br />
solution. A Reconciliation Commission has been established,<br />
consisting of a majority of the African and Asian members of the<br />
Secretary-General's Advisory Committee. In addition to this,<br />
President Kasavubu himself has said that he envisages a " roundtable<br />
conference" of Congolese political leaders.<br />
The economic and administrative aspects of the problem<br />
are, of course, tremendously important. The United Nations military<br />
forces and technical task force have been hampered by the absence<br />
either of a suitable ministry or of the elements of a proper system<br />
of administration. The General Assembly has appealed for voluntary contributions<br />
to a fund for the Congo for these purposes. Australia has great<br />
sympathy for this troubled country. We have already made a modest<br />
response to calls for specific practical help through medical teams<br />
and otherwise. We shall be prepared to meet our share of the cost<br />
of maintatihneiyn ga rtehe United Nations forces which are in the Congo;<br />
at present/ of the order of 20,000 drawn from 14 different countries.<br />
The costs of this force will be hirh. We have decided to mako 2<br />
contribution of 750,000 dollars to tho United Nations Conilc Fund.<br />
The great canger still is that this territory may become<br />
the centre of international rivalries. The Soviet Union and other<br />
moddlers have in their own hands the means of avoiding such a<br />
disaster. </p>
<p>lage 8.<br />
COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS I turn now to Commonwealth 4ffairs<br />
There have been important developments affecting the<br />
Commonwealth. Nigeria is now a Commonwealth country and we have appointed<br />
a High Commissioner to Lagos.<br />
Cyrpus has become an independent republic and may ask to<br />
become a member of the Commonwealth.<br />
South Africa, at the recent referendum, decided to adopt a<br />
republican constitution. This has given rise to discussion about the<br />
effect of this step on South Africa ' s continuing membership of the<br />
Commonwealth. In the past, the fact that a Commonwealth country has<br />
become a republic has not led to its exclusion from the Commonwealth.<br />
But feelings in many places run high about South Africa and it is<br />
therefore desirable that the relationship between a Republic of<br />
South Africa and the Commonwealth should be considered quietly and<br />
carefully. Our own view is that it should be the subject of joint<br />
deliberation among the Governments of the Commonwealth before<br />
individual government decisions are publicly stated. There will be<br />
a favourable opportunity for such consultation at the next Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference. No doubt the position of Cyprus might be<br />
considered at the same time.<br />
The whole question of the future constitution of the<br />
Commonwealth is clearly important and not without difficulty since<br />
we may expect over a relatively short period of years to have more<br />
British countries, now colonies, achieving independence and seeking<br />
admission to the Commonwealth. The questions involved received<br />
some attention at the last Prime Ministers' Conference when an<br />
official committee was set up to study them. We will no doubt have<br />
further thought given to the matter in March. </p>
<p>tage 9,.<br />
IOS I turn now to Lacs.<br />
The preservation of Laotian independence is important<br />
both for its own -4ake and because the loss of Laos to communism<br />
would expose other South-East Asian countries to serious threat.<br />
With a population of probably not more than 2-million and with<br />
long and -ulnerable frontiers, Laos has struged to maintain its<br />
integrity against constant pressures from Communist China and<br />
Communist North Vietnam and against internal Pathet Lao insurgency.<br />
We believe that any government of Laos which desires to retain<br />
genuine independence has two tasks.<br />
The first is that, while maintaining a determination not<br />
to submit to Commuiism, Laos should avoid givig its powerful<br />
Communist neighbours even the flimsiest excuse for interference.<br />
This is why neutrality as distinct from military alliances has<br />
seemed the only practical course for the country.<br />
The second task is that of settling the internal troubles.<br />
Some fighting between the forces of the government and of General<br />
Phoumi have already taken place. While the Government of Souvanna<br />
Phouma controls the administrative capital, Vientiane, anti-government<br />
but non-communist supporters of General Phoumi control the Royal<br />
capital of Luang Prabang. This is a tragic situation. The<br />
Communists alone, working through the i'athct Lao profit from the<br />
division and fighting between the non-communists.<br />
The imperative need inside Laos is for unity among, non-<br />
Communists so that the real onomies of Laos and Laotian neutrality<br />
the Communists can be isolated and resisted.<br />
We have a deep interest in these matters. The . minton-anc<br />
of Laotian independence will be a symbol of a nation's resistance t;.<br />
Communism in Asia. And aggressive communism in Asia and pressinL<br />
out to the borders of the asian continent reoresents a mcnaco to us.<br />
Nobody would doubt that the result in Laos will be important to the<br />
security of countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, whose<br />
safety is one of the aims of the South-East Asian Treaty. </p>
<p>Page<br />
VIETNAM There are many current criticisms of the policy of the<br />
government of South Vietnam on the ground that it is too authoritarian,<br />
too highly centralised, and that it is not undertaking necessary<br />
reforms. But I point out that reftorms aire not easy to introduce in<br />
the face of heavy Communist pressure.<br />
President Diem is beyond question a man of courage and<br />
resource. His Government is not only subject constantly to hostile<br />
propaganda from Hanoi but is also faced by greatly increased communist<br />
insurgency throughout the countryside.<br />
Recently the President survived an armed revolt from a<br />
small group from within the army. It is, I think, important that<br />
we should have a sympathetic and intelligent interest in the<br />
difficulties which this country has struggled with since 1954. In<br />
order to maintain resistance and development, the Republic has been<br />
obliged to maintain large armed forces. its policy, to an externt which<br />
has been criticised,~ 0li it necessary to curtail the political<br />
liberties enjoyed in more fortunate countries. It has had,-to battle<br />
against rebels who are masters of guerilla warfare. It has had to<br />
do all these things in a difficult terrain with large areas of swamp<br />
and jungle and with long and exposed frontiers.<br />
I am sure that the resolution which the Vietnamese people<br />
have shown in these lost six years, the increasing political experience<br />
of their leaders and continued Western aid and encouragement can carry<br />
the Republic through its present difficulties. </p>
<p>. ge 1<br />
WEST NEW GUINEA The House has previously debated the Australian attitude<br />
towards the future of West New Guinea. The policy of the Government<br />
is well known and needs no re-statement. There are, however, two<br />
recent developments which should be recorded.<br />
The first is that the P~ rime Minister of Malaya; in a series<br />
of conversations in various countries, has been putting forward<br />
proposals with respect to the future of West New Guinea. He was good<br />
enough to convey to me the kind of thing he had in mind and I promptly<br />
conveyed to him the attitude of the Australian Government. Since the<br />
Prime Minister has not, so far as I know, published his proposals I<br />
am not at liberty to disclose them. But I can say, and I should say,<br />
that I have made it clear that we adhere strongly to the principle that<br />
the future of the Territory should be one satisfying its ihhabitants<br />
and determined in accordance with their freely expressed wishes.<br />
This principle is, of course, the basis of our own policy<br />
in lcapua and New Guinea. Clearly it is also the basis of the Nether-lands<br />
Government's declared policy in its territory and of recent constitutional<br />
developments in both countries. In addition, I have made it clear<br />
that whatever discussions might in future occur between the Netherlands<br />
and Indonesia these should not be influenced by threats of force.<br />
It is interesting to note that while abroad, the Prime<br />
Minister of Malaya had discussions at the Hague with Dr. de Q~ uay,<br />
the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. They issued a communique in<br />
" Talks were of an exploratory nature and were held in a very<br />
friendly atmosphere. The Netherlands Government greatly<br />
appreciates the activities and constructive interest in this<br />
matter on the part of Tunku Abdul Rahman. The Prime Minister<br />
of the Federation of Malaya noted with satisfaction that the<br />
Netherlands Government are willing to subject their policies<br />
in Netherlands New Guinea to the scrutiny and judgment of the<br />
United Nations. It w~ as agreed that the Prime Minister of the </p>
<p>Page ' 12.<br />
Federation of Malaya, who has already held similar talks<br />
on this issue with other Governments as well as with the<br />
Secretary-General of the United Nations, would in the<br />
light of the outcome of these various talks consider<br />
whether at a later stage further talks might be useful.<br />
In such an event, he will inform the Netherlands<br />
Government accordingly." These wer, th. terms of the ccimmuniquc,<br />
It is not to be taken from this communique that the<br />
Netherlands Government is offering to submit the question of<br />
sovereignty to the United Nations. It has made it quite clear that<br />
it is not doing so. Honourable Members will recall that the<br />
Indonesian claim to sovereignty of West New Guinea has not been based<br />
primarily upon legal considerations. For this reason Indonesia has<br />
consistently declined to submit its claim to the International Court.<br />
some<br />
The second development is the recent landing of/ Indonesians<br />
in West New Guinea.<br />
On 21st November the Netherlands Ministry of Home Affairs<br />
announced that a small armed group of Indonesians landed on the<br />
South-west coast of Dutch New Guinea in mid November and some were<br />
apprehended. On 29th November the sa. me Ministry announccd that the<br />
Dutch Navy had interccpted and apprehcnded in waters aro. nd Dutch ' nv<br />
Guinea an Indonesian vessel which wis intended be supply an earlier<br />
Cgrcup of infiltrators. There have been several r,_-orts of Indonesian public<br />
statements on these infiltrations, the mcst recent of which was by<br />
few<br />
an official spokesman of the Indonesian Navy who on 2nd Docembur/ said:<br />
" so far as I know the Indonesian armed forces have never ; cnductod<br />
infiltrations into" Netherlands New Guinea. </p>
<p>iage 13.<br />
At the same time there have been several references by<br />
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Subandrio whom many honourable<br />
members will recall as a distinguished visitor to Australia last year<br />
to the possibility of an armed clash with the Netherlands in the. future<br />
over West New Guinea. I have, of course, studied what Dr. Subandria<br />
said. I hope that his remarks do not repudiate previous assurances<br />
given by both i1resident Sukarno and Dr. Subandric regarding the intentions<br />
of the Indonesian Government not to use force to obtain a solution of<br />
the dispute over West New Guinea. Indeed, Sir, I think I am right in<br />
saying that since I wrote those words earlier in the week there has been<br />
word confirming that he repeats that attitude.<br />
On 4th December, in discussing these and related matters with<br />
the Australian Ambassador, Lr. Subandrio said that his comments to the<br />
Ambassador on recent events did not mean any change in the Indonesian<br />
policy of pursuing their claim by peaceful means.<br />
There have been, of course, Sir, various Indonesian suggestions<br />
that the Dutch, by making some small reinforcement of their defences in<br />
West New Guinea, have acted provocatively. One has only to point out<br />
that the forces available to the Netherlands in West New Guinea are a<br />
tiny fraction of those actually under arms in Indonesia to show how<br />
unreal these allegations are.<br />
We certainly have no evidence in fact or any reason to support<br />
the strange notion that the Netherlands propose to launch an attack on<br />
Indonesia. Suggestions so fanciful do not help the understanding of the<br />
real nature of the problem.<br />
Finally, Sir, I turn to the problem of disarmament. Australians<br />
share the almost universal concern at the continued increase in armaments,<br />
including nuclear armaments. There is a sort of psychological control<br />
present when nuclear weapons are, as at present, confined to four nations.<br />
But there will no doubt be a constant pressure so long as the threat of<br />
war exists to have such weapons made available to other nations.<br />
We believe that if the number of countries possessing such<br />
weapons were substantially increased or if they fell into irresponsible<br />
hands, the world would live in a state of great dred.* </p>
<p>iPage 14.<br />
The throat to use them could indeed become a weapon of blackmail<br />
in pursuit of territorial or other gains* As I have frequently sai. d,<br />
myself, armaments are much more the result than the cause of international<br />
tension. I should like to remind Honourable Members that one of the<br />
groat causes of tension in the Western World is the continued<br />
enslavement of the once free powers of Middle Europe by the Soviet<br />
Union. It would, I think, be idle to suppose that the making of<br />
some agreement, leading even to a substantial reduction in armaments,<br />
can bring genuine peace to Europe or reconcile the enslaved nations<br />
to their slavery. Disarmament is therefore a matter to be approached not as an<br />
exercise in rhetoric or as a piece of detached idealism but as a hard<br />
practical matter. We have ourselves emphasised that disarmament in the<br />
nuclear field alone would not and the threat of war but might very well<br />
increase it since the Communist Powers have such predominance in<br />
conventional weapons and forces. Disarmament must occur in all fields<br />
and as it proceeds be accompanied at all stages by full inspection and<br />
control. It is, of course, impossible to discevcr what is the real aim.<br />
of a dictatorship since it is subject to no probing or questions of<br />
public opinion and does not havo to engage in democratic debate.* We ar<br />
therefore without the means of answering confidently any question about<br />
what is in Khruschev's mind. It is pernmissible to believe that his<br />
stated desire for disarmament may be to a point genuine. He is eng. a0CC<br />
in some raising of the standard of living of his own people; in certain<br />
branches of science and technology his country has made great strides.<br />
The more these results are achieved, the more criticism will begin tc<br />
evolve inside the Soviet Union and the more resentment there may be at<br />
the vast size of the burden of armaments and the enormous concentrati , n<br />
of what, after all, must be limited scientific resources on war-like<br />
affairs. </p>
<p>Page<br />
On the other hand, Khruschev can see great advantages<br />
for his own country in its struggle for power if he can divide his<br />
opponents, persuade their people that ' the Soviet Union genuinely<br />
desires disarmament and so create in them an unwillingness to<br />
all very confusing.<br />
sustain the necessary burdens. I't is, sir, to put it quite shortly,!<br />
One reason I have for believing that there is more<br />
propaganda than substanco in the Soviet view is that at the last<br />
Assembly, Khruschev himself, having previously ordered his<br />
representatives out from the Ten-Power Disarmament Committee in<br />
June, came along to the General Assembly to advocate that there<br />
should be a negotiation on disarmament in the General Assembly.<br />
This, I think, threu a murky light on his tactics. Nobody with a<br />
genuine desire for concrete negotiations on disarmament could think<br />
the General Assembly with its 100 delegations ( mann not less thrcn<br />
1000 delegates and alternates) an appropriate meeting ground for<br />
genuine negotiation. This great problem requires deliberation,<br />
reflection, honest exchange., It can be negotiated only in a<br />
body of limited numbers.<br />
That what I will call the Western Powers desire disarmament<br />
quite<br />
is/ clear. The whole Western social, political and economic system<br />
depends for its success on peace. Its free institutions and the<br />
free spirit of its people are not well suited to having a sustained<br />
" Cold war".* Yet we cannot disarm unilaterally, nor can we be directly<br />
or indirectly parties to any disarmament agreement unless we know<br />
that it contains sufficiently strong meansof inspection and control<br />
as to. make us not entirely dependent on Soviet good faith. The<br />
Western Powers will insist that while they are disarming they must<br />
be able to see that others are also doing so. This means not only<br />
being able to see how many weapons are being destroyed but also how<br />
many remain behind. Because of the secrecy surrounding Communist<br />
military capacity and intentions, and because of the Lack of<br />
confidence now existing, the West has always insisted on proper<br />
supervision to be ready to operate when disarmament begins and to<br />

This, Sir, is " disarmament with controls" not, as the Communist profcsrcs<br />
to believe, " controls without disarmament".<br />
Attempts tc negotiate disarmament agreements have now been<br />
in progress for over a decade in the United Nations. Recently they<br />
have been conducted in a 10-Powor Committee whose composition was<br />
agreed upon to meet Russian demands. The Communist delegates, as I<br />
have said, walked out at the very time when they knew Western proposals<br />
of a positive kind were about to be submitted. We think that the<br />
Committee of ten should resume its activities; for what is wanted if<br />
there is to be any measure of disarmament is not speeches at a large<br />
public meeting but honest negotiations at close quarters.<br />
The Western proposals are based on the following fundamental<br />
principles: I state them quite briefly<br />
1. Disarmament should be carried out in stages during which<br />
nuclear and conventional disarmament should be so balanced<br />
that no country or group of countries obtain at any stage a<br />
significant military advantage.<br />
2. Compliance with disarmament obligations will be effectively<br />
verified both as to quantities, destroyed and quantities remaining.<br />
3. ircvisions for such insp. ction, vorification : 2nd control must<br />
form an integral part cf any aOrrecr:: nt on disrmancnt,<br />
4. Transition from stage to stage shall bc dependent Cn assuranco<br />
that the measures in the precoding sta. ge have boon satisfactorily<br />
implemented. The Wast in Juno presented a detailed plan based on the abov,<br />
principles. With the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate tlij2r<br />
informative document in " Hansard"-I have taken this subject last in<br />
chronological order, but it is, of course, of obvious and overwholming<br />
importance to the world. The plan is as follows </p>
<p>I-Age 17.<br />
" The ultimate goal is a secure and peaceful world of<br />
free and open societies in which there shall be general<br />
and complete disarmament under effective international<br />
control and agreed procedures for the settlement of<br />
disputes in accordance with the principles of the United<br />
Nations Charter.<br />
General and complete disarmament in a secure, free<br />
and peaceful world requires<br />
1. The disbanding, through progressive stages, of all<br />
armed forces of all States and the prohibition of<br />
their re-establishment in any form whatsoeveic,<br />
except for thlose contingents of agreed size required<br />
for the purpose of maintaining internal order and<br />
ensuring the personal security of citizens and for<br />
agreed contin-. ents for the international peace force.<br />
2. The cessation of the production of all kinds of<br />
armaments, including all means for delivering<br />
weapons of mass destruction, and their complete<br />
elimination from national arsenals, through<br />
progressive stages, except for those armaments agreed<br />
upon for use by an international peace force and<br />
agreed remaining national contingents.<br />
3. Strict and effective international control, from<br />
beginning to end, of the carrying out of all<br />
disarmament measures, to ensure that there are no<br />
violations. The establishmnent of effective means for enforcement<br />
of international agreements and for the maintenance<br />
of peace.<br />
Controlling principles:<br />
1. Disarmament under effective international control<br />
shall be carried out in such a manner that at no time<br />
shall any State, whether or not a party to a Treaty,<br />
obtain military advantage over other States as a<br />
result of the progress of disarmament.<br />
2. General and complete disarmament shall proceed through<br />
three stages containing balanced, phased and safeguarded<br />
measures with each measure being carried out<br />
in an agreed and strictly defined period of time,<br />
under the supervision of an International<br />
Disarmament Control Organization, within the framework<br />
of the United Nations.<br />
3. Each measure within each stage shall be initiated<br />
simultaneously by all participa ting States upon<br />
completion of the necessary preparatory studies<br />
and upon establishmeint of the arrangements and<br />
procedures necessary for the International Disarmament<br />
Control Organization to verify the measures on<br />
an initial and continuing basis. </p>
<p>Page 18.<br />
0 4. Transition from one stage to the next shall be<br />
initiated when the Security Council of the United<br />
Nations agrees that all measures in the preceding<br />
stage have been fully implemented and effective<br />
verification is continuing, and that any additional<br />
verification arrangements and procedures required for<br />
measures in the next stage have been established and<br />
are ready to operate effectively.<br />
The Treaties shall remain in force indefinitely subject<br />
to the inherent right of a Party to withdraw and<br />
be relieved of obligations thereunder if the<br />
provisions of the Treaty, including those providing<br />
for the timely installation and effective operation of<br />
the control system, are not being fulfilled and<br />
observed.<br />
6. The International Disarmament Control Organization<br />
shall comprise all participating States whose<br />
representatives shall meet as a conference periodically<br />
as required. There shall in addition be a control<br />
commission and a Director General. The specific<br />
responsibility and authority of the conference,<br />
control commission and the Director General, the<br />
staffing arrangements and criteria, the responsibilities<br />
of participating States to the Organization, and<br />
provisions for any necessary preparatory or interim<br />
group to aid in the establishment of the Organization<br />
shall be specified in the Treaty.<br />
7. The specific arrangements, procedures and means<br />
required for effective initial and continuing<br />
verification of satisfactory performance of each<br />
measure by the International Disarmament Control<br />
Organization shall be specified in the Treaties.<br />
These shall provide for all necessary means required<br />
for effective verification of compliance with each<br />
step of each measure. Verification of each agreed<br />
disarmament measure shall be accomplished in such a<br />
manner as to be capable of disclosing, to the<br />
satisfaction of all participating States, any evasion<br />
of the agreement. Specifically, from the initiation<br />
of implementation of each agreed disarmament measure,<br />
there shall be effective verification by the<br />
International Disarmament Control Organization;<br />
verification shall be in no way dependent upon<br />
declarations by States for its effectiveness;<br />
verification shall include the capability to ascertain<br />
that not only do reductions of armed forces and<br />
armaments in agreed amounts take place, but also that<br />
retained armed forces and armaments do not exceed<br />
agreed levels at . ny stage.<br />
TASK OF THE TEN NATION COMMITTEE ON DISARMAMENT<br />
The task of the Ton Nation Committee on Disarmament<br />
is to work out a Treaty for general and complete<br />
disarmament under effective international control governed<br />
by the foregoing controlling principles as follows<br />

in the first instance by the States represented on the<br />
Ten Nation Disarmament Committee, embodying the first<br />
stage of the programme. This stage shall consist of<br />
those initial and controllable measures which can and<br />
shall be undertaken without delay by the States<br />
participating in the Committee to preclude the<br />
expansion of their armed forces; to bring to a halt<br />
the growth of their weapons stockpiles; to reduce<br />
the levels of their armed forces and armaments to the </p>
<p>S 0 </p>
<p>Ta I-.<br />
extant possible wiithouat jeopardy to their security;<br />
and to provide measurs for protection against<br />
surprise attack.<br />
2. In the course of no~ otiatin such a Treaty, arrangfor<br />
and conduct the necessary technical studies to<br />
work out effective control arrangements for 1iasuros<br />
to be carried out in the prograrm. Thcse studies<br />
shall provide an agreed basis for proceeding with<br />
impleme. iontation of the measure studied in the<br />
appropriate Stage. Among the narly studies shall be<br />
a technical examination of the measures necessary to<br />
verify control ov-r, reduction and elimination of<br />
agreed categories of nuclea-r delivery system" is,<br />
including m issil.. z aircraft, surface ships,<br />
