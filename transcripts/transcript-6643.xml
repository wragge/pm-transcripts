FOR MEDIA 7 June 1985<br />
The Government considers it very important that the US<br />
and the USSR continue their present policies of not<br />
undercutting the SALT II agreement, pending the<br />
negotiation of a new agreement providing for significant<br />
reductions in the nuclear forces.<br />
The SALT II agreement signed in 1979 but never<br />
ratified expires on 31 December 1985. Of more<br />
immediate concern is that, in the coming months, the<br />
United States will come up against one of the key sublimits<br />
imposed by the Treaty the ceiling of 1200 on<br />
MIRVed ballistic missiles.<br />
Although SALT II is far from ideal as a measure of<br />
nuclear arms control, its key provisions serve as an<br />
important framework of constraint and impart a<br />
valuable degree of predictability to the future<br />
evolution of the strategic forces.<br />
The Government appreciates US concerns about Soviet<br />
compliance with existing arms control agreements,<br />
including SALT II. Nevertheless, it'remains our view<br />
that the Soviet Union has adhered to the broad terms of<br />
both SALT I and SALT II and, so far as we are. aware, is<br />
not contemplating steps which could seriously<br />
destabilise the strategic balance or result in a<br />
meaningful strategic advantage.<br />
With the current effort by the superpowers to devise a<br />
new framework for the control-and reduction of the<br />
nuclear arsenals at the very difficult formative stage,<br />
the Government sees it as particularly important to<br />
preserve the existing framework.<br />
We consider that the maintenance of the SALT framework<br />
contributes to the security of the United States and its<br />
allies, includin6* Australia.<br />
Moreover, we believe that the goal of nuclear nonproliferation,<br />
to which the Australian Government is<br />
strongly committed, would not be served by public<br />
evidence that the two superpowers were removing defined<br />
and agreed restraints on their nuclear capabilities.<br />
The removal of such restraints would not augur well for<br />
the NPT Review Conference, due to get under way in<br />
August this year. </p>
<p>2.<br />
With these considerations in mind, the Government has in<br />
recent days communicated its strong view to the United<br />
States and Soviet Governments that the existing SALT II<br />
limits should continue to be observed, while the Geneva<br />
arms control negotiations pursue new agreements. </p>
