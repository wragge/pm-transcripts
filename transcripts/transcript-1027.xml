TEL1VISION SPEECH BY THE PRIME WINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. SIR ROBERT MENZIES OVER ALL<br />
ABC NATIONAL TELEVISION STATIONS ( EXCEPT<br />
VICTORIA) ON WEDNESDAY, 25TH NOVEMBER, 1964<br />
In his opening speech, I notice that Mr. Calwell<br />
covered a groat variety of topics. I thought in effect,<br />
that he repeated his policy speech of the last General<br />
Election. Now, of course, this is not a General Election.<br />
This is a Senate Election, and it is not the occasion for<br />
new policies because you voted for us on a three-year<br />
policy only less than twelve months ago. But I think it<br />
is important to discover what is the real bone of contention<br />
on this occasion, and I am indebted to the Opposition for<br />
having made it quite clear what it regards as the bone of<br />
contention. Now, the spokesman, the Member in charge of<br />
the Opposition's case against compulsory service was Mr.<br />
Fraser, Mr. A. D. Fraser, a very senior and experienced<br />
member of the Labour Party. He was put in charge of the<br />
Bill. What he said about the Bill represented the view of<br />
the Opposition, and when the Bill was through and had got<br />
to the Third Reading stage. he took the unusual course of<br />
speaking on the Third Reading and uttering one paragraph,<br />
but he did it with great deliberation so that everybody might<br />
notice it. Could I read it to you?<br />
He said " Ve believe that the time has come for<br />
this issue the issue of compulsion to be<br />
transferred to the jury of the Australian people<br />
from this Parliament. That will enable the<br />
Australian people to do, as I am certain they<br />
will do at the Senate poll. namely, register<br />
their overwhelming opposition to the unlimited<br />
conscription of Australian youth in peace time<br />
for service on foreign battlefields under foreign<br />
commands and in wars to which Australia is not a<br />
party," Now I am bound to believe that that is the Labour<br />
Party speaking through its trusted representative in the House,<br />
and so I would like just to have a look at it because this<br />
really exposes the whole error, the basic error of the Labour<br />
Party's approach to this matter.<br />
In the first place, he said do you remember?<br />
I quote the precise words: " unlimited conscription". ' Jell,<br />
of course, it isn't unlimited conscription. It applies to a<br />
limited and selected number of people out of a great number,<br />
a very large number. That is unavoidable if you want a limited<br />
intake. But I will pass on from that, it doesn't matter.<br />
But this is in peace time, in peace time. Does<br />
the Labour Party really believe that we are living in a nice<br />
comfortable, leisurely time of peace? I pointed out in the<br />
House, when I announced the Defence Programme, that we are now<br />
in a state of rather more peril than we have been accustomed<br />
to in times of so-called peace. Can we really believe that </p>
<p>2<br />
this is ordinary peace time, wrhen at this moment in South<br />
Vietnam troops are engaged in combat, American forces are<br />
engaged in combat American forces, of whom a quite reasonable<br />
percentage are draftees, or as we say, conscripts, fighting<br />
in South Vietnam. Can we really say it is a tiec of peace<br />
when we have our own people there helping? Can we really<br />
say that it is a time of peace when the North Vietnamese<br />
are attacking American forces both on sea and on land? Can<br />
we really say this is a time of peace when almost every few<br />
days Indonesian infiltrators go into Malaya, to say nothing<br />
of Malaysia, because they have been going into the Borneo<br />
Territories for some time, and now they have become boldor,<br />
and they land from time to time in Malaya itself. Can we<br />
say this is a time of peace?<br />
This is a basic fallacy on the part of Labour,<br />
and indeed, Mr. Fraser admitted that these were not times of<br />
peace because in the next breath he said...." for service on<br />
foreign battlefields". " battlefields".... he acknowledges<br />
the existence of battlefields but he says this is a time of<br />
peace And then, of course, above all, he says that<br />
these are wars, these are wars, the ones in which our own<br />
people are to serve " to which australia is not a party".<br />
Now this, of course, denies the whole existence of our<br />
alliances. It denies the existence of the South-East Asian<br />
Treaty, in which we have as partners, Great Britain, the United<br />
States and a variety of Asian countries, and there in what we<br />
now call SEATO we have obligations, and it is because of<br />
SEATO that we have men at this moment in South Vietnam and that<br />
we have men at this moment in Thailand, troops in Thailand,<br />
that we have troops air forces in Malaya. Does the Labour<br />
Party seriously suggest that we are not a party to these matters.<br />
We are bound by treaty, by honourable obligation, and in the<br />
same way, we are bound by honourable obligation, declared by<br />
us in this Parliament and approved by you at th3 last election,<br />
to come to the aid of Malaysia under unwarranted attack from<br />
the forces and the leaders of Indonesia.<br />
You see what I mean? To talk about wars to<br />
which Australia is not a party you see, I come back to the<br />
very words " to which Australia is not a party" is to<br />
deny all reality. If we are not a party to these matters,<br />
what are we doing there? How do we come to be there?<br />
Because we have treaties and honourable obligations and we<br />
don't come of a nation that is accustomed to dishonouring<br />
its treaties or its obligations.<br />
And if you come a little nearer home and look<br />
at our side of New Guinea Papua and New Guinea in which we<br />
have a tremendous trust obligation for millions of relatively<br />
primitive people, you will find that we have declared that<br />
we will defend the frontiers of New Guinea and Papua just as<br />
we would the frontiers of our own country. Suppose an attack<br />
came that way, would the Labour Party say this is a war to<br />
which Australia is not a party? Don't they realise that any<br />
attack on our Territories in the Pacific invokes the operations<br />
of the great ANZUS pact to which the United States is a party?<br />
I wonder what would happen to us, my friends,<br />
if we adopted the Labour view and if we took up the attitude<br />
that what happens in South-East Asia is no business of ours,<br />
even that what happens in New Guinea is no business of ours,<br />
And suppose the United States said, " All right, if that goes<br />
for you, it goes for us. If you're not a party to these </p>
<p>-3-<br />
military obligations, why should we be? If you can renounce<br />
your obligations, why can't we renounce ours?" L. nd not one<br />
of us will take very much persuasion, will we, that if we were,<br />
in fact, deserted in this part of the world by the groat powers<br />
who can command the greatest strength in the world for our<br />
protection, then we would be not only lonely but our future<br />
could well be destroyed. Dontt let us have foolish talk as if we were<br />
living in the halcyon summer of unbroken peace. We are not.<br />
We are living in a dangerous period in the worldts histoiy and<br />
we must, at this time above all tines, have clear thinking and<br />
resolute action in relation to our own security. </p>
