<p>Counselling and support services will be available to participants of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse thanks to $44 million from the Gillard Government.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking applications from eligible organisations to apply for funding to deliver services such as counselling, support and case management to individuals and affected family members before, during and after their engagement with the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>The Government understands the importance of ensuring that survivors of child sexual abuse are supported to participate in the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>Organisations that provide specialist support services such as counselling and case management as well as those that support people from a diverse range of backgrounds, including indigenous Australians, people living with disability and people who speak English as a second language, are encouraged to apply.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission, led by Justice Peter McClellan AM, is inquiring into how institutions with a responsibility for children have managed and responded to allegations and instances of child sexual abuse and related matters.</p>
<p>The Commission is investigating where systems have failed to protect children, and will make recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to child sexual abuse in institutions.</p>
<p>The Government is also establishing a free national legal advisory service for people engaging or wishing to engage with the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>The free legal advisory service will provide people with legal and procedural advice on important issues such as preparing submissions to the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>Specialist support services will complement the legal advisory services as well as any service provided from within the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>This Government believes every child has the right to grow up safe and strong, and recognises the terrible lifelong consequences of child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>This Government will do everything it can to make sure that what happened to children in the past is not allowed to happen again, and is committed to doing everything it can to help survivors of past abuse receive support and justice.</p>
<p>Further information about Royal Commission support services and how organisations can apply for funding is available at <a href="http://www.fahcsia.gov.au">www.fahcsia.gov.au</a>, or by emailing <a href="mailto:rcsupportservices@fahcsia.gov.au">rcsupportservices@fahcsia.gov.au</a></p>
