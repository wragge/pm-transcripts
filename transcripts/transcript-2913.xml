NEW SOUTH WALES-ZIONIST COUNCIL.<br />
CELEBRATIONS OF ISRAEL's 25TH ANNIVERSARY<br />
ADDRESS'BY THE PRIME MINISTER.-MR E. G. WHITLAM<br />
SYDNEY TOWN HALL 6 MAY 1973.<br />
THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY DO<br />
NOT ALWAYS PERMIT THE FULL EXPRESSION OF A NATION'IS DEEPER<br />
FEELINGS ABOUT INTERNAT. IONAL AFFAIRS.". FOR EXAMPLE, THE.<br />
POLICY ON THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTMY<br />
OWN AND ALL THOSE WHO PRECEDED IT IN THE LAST TWO DECADESHAS<br />
BEEN OFFICIALLY EXPRESSED IN THESE TERMS:-<br />
" AUSTRALIA'S POLICY TOWARDS THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE<br />
IS ONE OF NEUTRALITY AND OF SYMPATHETIC INTEREST<br />
IN A SETTLEMENT. AUSTRALIA HAS MAINTAINED FRIENDLY<br />
RELATIONS WITH BOTH SI-DES BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MAJOR<br />
ROLE IN THE AREA AND HAVE AVOIDED ACCORDINGLY<br />
STRIKING A PARTISAN ATTITUDE."<br />
Now, WHILE THESE HAVE BEEN THE BROAD GUIDELINES FOR<br />
SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS AND WOULD BE A FAIR ENOUGH EXPRESSION<br />
OF AVERAGE AUSTRA LIAN OPINION, I CANNOT. IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD<br />
BE REGARDED BY ZIONISTS OR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY GENERALLY AS<br />
THE DEFINITIVE VIEW ON THE MATTER. AND THE FACT IS, OF COURSE,<br />
THAT WHILE SUCCESSIVE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS.-MAINTAIN NEUTRALITY<br />
ON THE DISPUTE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NEUTRAL AND ARE NOT NEUTRAL<br />
ON BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE DISPUTE. WE ARE NOT NEUTRAL ON THE<br />
QUESTION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ISRAEL; THE SOVEREIG NTY OF ISRAEL<br />
IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. THE RIGHTS OF JEWS TO GO TO THE NATIONAL<br />
. HOMELANDA ND TO LIVE THERE IN FREEDOM AND PEACE ARE NOT TO BE<br />
DENIED. THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO DEFEND HER BORDERS AND PRESERVE </p>
<p>INTACT THE GREAT DEMOCRACY WHICH FLOURISHES THERE IS NOT A MATTER<br />
ON WHICH THIS OR ANY AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS EVER BEEN NEUTRAL.<br />
WE NOT ONLY ACCEPT ISRAEL's MORAL RIGHTS IN ALL THESE MATTERS BUT<br />
ACCEPT OUR OWN MORAL RESPONSIBILITY As EUROPEANS AND AS<br />
BELLIGERENTS IN THE WAR AGAINST FASCISM AND PERSECUTION TO<br />
UPHOLD THOSE RIGHTS. AND THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY THE<br />
PARTY OF HERBERT VERE EVATT FREELY ACKNOWLEDGES ITS SPE CIAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES, AND ITS INTIMATEASSOCIATION WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AND +' EOPLE OF ISRAEL. THERE ARE OTHER MATTERS ON<br />
WHICH WE CANNOT BE NEUTRAL. WE CANNOT, FOR INSTANCE, BE<br />
NEUTRAL TOWARDS THE WORLD-WIDE PATTERN OF TERROR AND REPRISAL<br />
THAT HAS DEVELOPED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE AND FROM WHICH<br />
CITIZENS OF ISRAEL, INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE BEEN<br />
AMONGST THE CHIEF VICTIMS.<br />
IT IS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THESE ATTITUDES THAT<br />
IWISH TO PUT AUSTRALIA'S RECENT STAND IN THE SECURITY ' COUNC IL,.<br />
A STAND WHICH HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IN SOME QUARTERS. -ON 21<br />
APRIL AUSTRALIA VOTED IN-THE SECURITY COUNCIL WITH BRITAIN,<br />
INDIA, INDONESIA, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, YUGOSLAVIA, SUDAN, KENYAf<br />
PANAMA AND PERU CONDEMNING THE RAID BY ISRAELI FORCES INTO<br />
LEBANON ON 10 APRIL. NO MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL VOTED AGAINST<br />
THE MOTION BUT THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA AND<br />
GUINEA ABSTAINED. OUR ACTUAL VOTE TELLS ONLY A VERY SMALL<br />
PART OF THE ACTIVITIES ON THIS MATTER TAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN NEW YORK. ON 13 APRILTHREE<br />
DAYS AFTER THE RAID -ISENT THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES TO<br />
OUR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL: </p>
<p>3.<br />
FIRST, THAT ANY AUSTRALIAN STATEMENT SHOULD DEPLORE<br />
VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM BY EITHER SIDE IN THE PRESENT<br />
SITUATION; SECONDLY THAT WE SHOULD IN OUR STATEMENTS<br />
AND ACTIVITIES SEEK TO MAINTAIN THE ESTABLISHED POLICY OF<br />
NEUTRALITY AND EVENHANDEDNESS; THIRDLY THAT WE SHOULD<br />
USE OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVEA RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD WIN<br />
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND THAT WjOULD O-PERATE TO QUIETEN<br />
RATHER THAN-FURTHER INFLAME THE SITUATION; AND FINALLY<br />
THAT IF A RESOLUTION STRONGLY UNFAIR TO EITHER SIDE SHOULD<br />
BE SUBMITTED, THE DELEGATION SHOULD USE ITS. DISCRETION TO<br />
OPPOSE IT OR TO ABSTAIN.<br />
ACCORDINGLY OUR DEELEGATION WORKED FOR A RESOLUTION WHICH, WHILE<br />
CENSURING ISRAEL FOR ITS INTRUSION ON LEBANESE SOVEREIGNTY, TOOK<br />
A BALANCED APPROACH TO THE WHOLE PATTERN OF VIOLENCE AND REPRISAL<br />
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT NONE OF THE DRAFT RESOLUTION'S OF THEIR.<br />
AMENDMENTS INTRODUCED PRIOR TO THE ANGLO-FRENCH DRAFT OF 21<br />
APRIL.-WHICH WAS THE ONE UPON WHICH THE VOTE WAS TAKEN -WERE<br />
ACCEPTABLE To AUSTRALIA.<br />
SO IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THERE WERE TWO IMPORTANT<br />
PRINCIPLES EXPRESSED BY OUR APPROACH THAT NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY<br />
MUST BE UPHELD AND THAT TERRORISM MUST BE OPPOSED. IN THE LONG<br />
TERM, FOR THAT MATTER AT ANY TIME 7ISRAEL'IS OWIN INTERESTS AS<br />
MUCH AS ANY OTHER NATION'S -ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE THAT THOSE<br />
PRINCIPLES ARE UPHELD.<br />
IN HIS STATEMENT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 1.7 APRIL<br />
OUR AMBASSADOR, SIR LAURENCE-MACINTYRE, EMPHASISED THE NEED TO </p>
<p>BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. HE SAID, ON BEHALF OF AUSTRALIA:-<br />
" IN AUSTRALIA'S VIEW THE FIRST AND, WE BELIEVE, THE MOST<br />
POSITIVE AND HELPFUL STEP TOWARDS A JUST, SECURE AND<br />
LASTING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST MIGHT BE TO BREAK THE<br />
CYCLE OF AGGRESSION AND REPRISAL AND THUS TO TURN BACK<br />
THE WAVE OF MURDEROUS VIOLENCE AND TERROR THAT HAS SPREAD<br />
OUTWARDS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST ACROSS THE WORLD. IF WE<br />
ARE RIGHT IN THIS BELIEF, THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE POINT<br />
IN CONSIDERING THE LATEST ISRAELI ACT IN ISOLATION FROM<br />
THE LAST OF'THE HORRIFYING MATRIX OF RECENT INTERNATIONAL<br />
VIOLENCE-AND TERRORISM. WHETHER THE ACTIONS ENGAGED BY<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL ARE TO BE REGARDED AS AN ACT<br />
OF AGGRESSION OR RETALIATION, OR PRECAUTION OR SELF<br />
DEFENCE, IT IS ONLY ONE OF A SUCCESSION OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE<br />
IN RESPECT OF WHICH SOME OF ISRAEL'S NEIGHBOURIN GOVERNMENTS<br />
CAN SCARCELY ESCAPE CHARGES OF COMPLICITY OR AT LEAST<br />
ACQUIESCENCE. IT IS PART OF A VICIOUS CIRCLE AND CANNOT<br />
BE SEPARATED FROM ITS SURROUNDING PATTERN OF VIOLENCE, IF<br />
THIS COUNCIL IS TO GEN ERATE A NEW MOMENTUM IN ITS EFFORTS<br />
TO BRING ABOUT A JUST, SECURE AND LASTING PEACE IN THE<br />
MIDDLE EAST. IF THE UNITED NATIONS FAILS TO PUT AN ENDTO<br />
THE FURTHER ESCALATION AND PROLIFERATION OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IT IS, LIABLE TO HAVE MATTERS<br />
TAKEN OUT OF ITS HANDS."<br />
THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAD BEFORE IT A DRAFT-RESOLUTION<br />
FROM LEBANON CALLING UPON ALL STATES TO REFRAIN FROM PROVIDING<br />
ISRAEL WITH ANY ASSISTANCE WHICH WOULD FACILITATE MILITARY ATTACKS </p>
<p>AND THREATEN FURTHER SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION IF SUCH ATTACKS<br />
WERE REPEATED. WE CONSIDERED THAT THESE ONE-SIDED TERMS WERE<br />
UNACCEPTABLE AND FURTHER MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY BRITAIN<br />
STILL FAILED TO MAKE THE DRAFT SUFFICIENTLY FAIR TO ISRAEL TO<br />
ATTRACT OUR SUPPORT.<br />
FOLLOWING SIR LAURENCV'S STATEMENT A NEW ANGLO-FRENCH<br />
DRAFT WAS INTRODUCED ON 19 APRILI WE BELIEVED THAT THE CHANGES<br />
WENT SOME DISTANCE AT LEAST TOWARDS INJECTING A MEASURE OF<br />
BALANCE INTO THE RESOLUTION AND OUR REPRESENTATIVE BELIEVED THAT<br />
ALTHOUGH THE NEXT TEXT WAS NOT ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY, AN<br />
AFFIRMATIVE VOTE WAS POSSIBLE. IN EXPLANATION OF OUR VOTE<br />
SIR LAURENCE SAID:-<br />
" IN THE VIEW OF my GOVERNMENT A CONDEMNATORY JUDGEMENT<br />
WHICH WOULD HAVE TREATED THE PARTICULAR ACT,<br />
REPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS, IN ISOLATION FROM THE REfST<br />
OF THE PATTERN OF PROVOCATIVE VIOLENCE, TERROR AND<br />
REPRISAL OF WHICH IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY A PART, AND WHICH<br />
IS ENCROACHING ON THE SAFETY OF LIFE EVERYWHERE, WOULD<br />
HAVE AMOUNTED TO A DISTORTION BY THE COUNCIL OF THE<br />
REALITIES OF THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WOULD<br />
SCARCELY BE LIKELY TO HELP TOWARDS A SETTLEMENT OF ITS<br />
STUBBORN PROBLEMS. </p>
<p>6,<br />
THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE GO SOME DISTANCE<br />
AT LEAST TOWARDS INJECTING A MEASURE OF BALANCE INTO<br />
THE RESOLUTION TO A POINT WHERE, EVEN THOUGH WE<br />
STILL DO NOT REGARD IT AS ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY, WE<br />
HAVE FELT ABLE TO SUPPORT IT,.<br />
I THINK YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS PATTERN OF EVENTS<br />
AND THE STATEMENTS OF OUR AMBASSADOR THAT THE VOTE OF<br />
21 APRIL CAN IN NO WAY BE REGARDED AS A BASIC CHANGE OF<br />
ATTITUDE ON MY GOVERNMENT'S PART OR A BASIC DEPARTURE FROM THAT<br />
OF PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WE DID<br />
ABSTAIN FROM VOTING ON A RESOLUTION ADOPTED 86-7 WITH<br />
31 ABSTENTIONS BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON 8 DECEMBER LAST AS<br />
REPRESENTING A FURTHER ONE-SIDED CRITICISM OF ISRAEL IN TERMS SIMILP<br />
TO THOSE USED IN RECENT YEARS, WE ABSTAINED IN 1971 ON A<br />
RESOLUTION IN ALMOST IDENTICAL TERMS, ON THE OCCASION OF THE<br />
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION WE BELIEVE THAT CONSISTENT ADHERENCE<br />
TO THE TWO PRINCIPLES OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND OPPOSITION TO<br />
TERRORISM DID REQUIRE SUPPORT FOR A RESOLUTION, IN ITSELF,<br />
IN MANY WAYS, UNSATISFACTORY,<br />
I AM NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TELLING ISRAEL WHAT<br />
IS FOR HER OWN GOOD, I KNOW THAT SUCH ADVICE FROM'ME WOULD<br />
BE GRATUITOUS AND SUPERFLUOUS, I CAN ONLYSPEAK ABOUT THE,<br />
MOST USEFUL COURSE, FOR AUSTRALIA CANNOT TAKE THE SAME<br />
PESSIMISTIC VIEW OF THE UNITED NATIONS AS I THINK-ISRAEL TENDS<br />
TO DO. IT IS TRUE THAT THE MIDDLE EAST HAS NOW BECOME THE </p>
<p>I7.<br />
CENTRAL STAGE OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT POWERS<br />
OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION, AND IT IS TRUE THAT<br />
IN SUCH CONFRONTATIONS THE UNITED NATIONS HAS IN THE PAST<br />
PROVED INEFFECTUAL, EVEN IMPOTENT. THERE IS NO MORE CERTAIN<br />
WAY TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE UNITED<br />
NATIONS THAN THAT THE SMAL[ ER NATIONS OF PEACE AND FREEDOM<br />
SHOULD DESPAIR ABSOLUTELY OF THAT , QNE WORLD BODY OF WHICH<br />
THEY FORM A MAJORITY. THE GREATEST VICTIMS OF THE BREAKDOWN<br />
THROUGH DESPAIR OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WERE THE JEWISH PEOPLE.<br />
NO NATION WOULD HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN ISRAEL B9Y A BREAKDOWN OF<br />
THE UNITED NATIONS.<br />
WE HAVE AFFIRMED, AND ' WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE, THAT<br />
THE BEST PROSPECT FOR AN ENDURING PEACE IN THE MIIDDLE EAST<br />
WILL FLOW FROM AN AGREEMENT FREELY ARRIVED AT BETWEEN THE<br />
PARTIES. M'Y GOVERNMENT WILL WORK TO SECURE SUPPORTFOR<br />
NEGOTIATIONS TOWARDS SUCH AN AGREEMENT, BOTH IN THE U..<br />
AND IN ALL OUR DIPLOMATIC ENDEAVOURS. </p>
