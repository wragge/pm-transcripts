FOR PRESS: COMMENCEMENT OF PRICES JUSTIFICATION ACT<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, The Hon. L. H.<br />
Barnard, M. P.)<br />
The Prices Justification Act, which comes into<br />
operation tomorrow, Wednesday, 1 August, is a key element<br />
in the Government's drive against inflation.<br />
The Act covers a large number of major companies,<br />
and these will now be required to notify the Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal of any proposals to increase prices,<br />
unless they have'received appropriate exemptions fr'om the<br />
Tribunal. The Tribunal also has power at any time to~ look<br />
into the actual prices charged by such companies.<br />
The Tribunal's findings in those cases where it<br />
decides to hold an enquiry will be reported to the Government<br />
and will be of the greatest importance. The Act-requires<br />
that they be made public by the Government.<br />
Many companies have ,, already registered with the<br />
Tribunal at the invitation of its Chairman, Mr Justice Williams.<br />
Members and senior staff of the Tribunal have been<br />
consulted by a number of companies regarding the procedures<br />
to be followed. A memorandum describing those procedures<br />
has also been distributed widely by the Chairman.<br />
The Tribunal is making a good start, and I confidently<br />
expect that it will be followed by further solid progress.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
