FOR PRESS 29 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
DISASTER RELIEF,. QUEENSLAND<br />
The Commonwealth Government has agreed to a request by the<br />
Queensland Government for assistance under the Natural<br />
Disasters Assistance Arrangements in respect of the granite<br />
belt hailstorins, drought and the northern bush fires, all of,<br />
which have recently been declared natural disasters by the<br />
Queensland Government.<br />
As with the drought relief proposals put forward recently by<br />
the South Australian Government, the Commonwealth has acted<br />
speedily and. syznpathe. tically to assist those affected by the<br />
disasters. All producers affected will be eligible for carry-on loans at<br />
concessional rates of interest.<br />
Those affected by bush fire and drought will also receive<br />
concessional loans for restocking and freight concessions<br />
on the transport of stock and fodder.<br />
The terms of the loans are a matter to be settled by the<br />
Queensland Government. The Commonwealth will meet the full<br />
cost above $ 2 million.<br />
When natural disasters causing damage and destruction occur-in<br />
a State, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist the State<br />
financially under the Natural Disaster Assistance Arrangements.<br />
The present assistance being given to Queensland and to South<br />
Australia are examples of the way in which the Commonwealth<br />
helps the States in such arrangements. </p>
