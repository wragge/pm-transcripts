JAPAN/ AUSTRALIA BUSINESS CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE<br />
FOURTH JOINT MEETING-HELD) AT CANBERrA. A . C. T.<br />
l') th April l) 66<br />
Speech by the Pri~ iie Minister. Mr. Harold Hlolt<br />
Sir Edward Varren, Mr. Adachi, Mr. " Nagano, my<br />
Ministerial colleagues, David Fairbairn, Mr. Anderson,<br />
Ministerial colleagues and Parliamentary colleagues that<br />
I see around the room and members of the Australia/ Japan<br />
Business Co-operation Committee, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
( I think that should just about cover it).<br />
This is one of those happy occasions when, if<br />
the politician speaks with two tongues he is applauded for<br />
it rather than condemned, and with the help of my very able<br />
assistant on my left, I shall try to tell you some of the<br />
thoughts which come to the mind of an Australian Prime<br />
minister on so felicitous an occasion as this. And I<br />
assure you it is a very happy occasion for the Australian<br />
people; and on behalf of the Australian people, speaking<br />
for their Government, I extend to all of you who have come<br />
to participate in the important work of this committee a<br />
very warm and friendly welcome. We hope that you will<br />
enjoy your stay with us and that your discussions will be<br />
fruitful and con,; tructive.<br />
This Committee iv a very happy manifestation of<br />
what I regard as a great peacetime achievement, a positive,<br />
constructive co-operation which has worked, ao Sir Edward<br />
WJarren has so graphically outlined to us this morning, to the<br />
mutual advantage of our two countries and indeed to '% he<br />
advantage of world trade in general.<br />
Sir Edw-. ard Warren has given us the figures which<br />
illustrate the dramatic growth in trade which has occurred<br />
between our two countries. It has been quite phenomenal<br />
by the experience of Australia in its trading with any other<br />
country in the world, and as he forecast, we confidently<br />
anticipate that in the years ahead, Japan will assume the<br />
leadership in the role of the largest customer for the<br />
products of this country, and we, in turn are, on the<br />
evidence of the growth of trade in recent years, an<br />
improving and increasing customer for the products of Japan.<br />
It is the essence of good negotiation that all<br />
parties to it feel that the outcome of the negotiations has<br />
been of advantage. It is a bad negotiation when one party<br />
feels that it has't worked out fairly in its case. But<br />
ever since the treaty was entered into between Australia<br />
and Japan, trade relations have been harmonious and<br />
co-operativie. There have been, of course, occasions of<br />
difficulty, but these have, as a result of friendly discussion<br />
and negotiation, usually produced a satisfactory result for<br />
us and we confidently anticipate that in this spirit we can<br />
advance the interests of our two countries as trade grows<br />
between us. </p>
<p>2.<br />
We are on the threshold of another important<br />
phase in ) ur trade relations, as the vast mineral projects<br />
now getting into production in various parts of Australia<br />
come to supplement the already large volume of trade between<br />
US. I believe that this growth in trade will have a<br />
dramatic impact upon the economic thinking of other countries<br />
observing the development of trade, the strength of<br />
production whichi will f low from this from Japan to other<br />
parts of the world. And so, although our achievements up<br />
to this point of time have been great, he would be indeed<br />
a pessimist who did not see in the future a tremendous<br />
growth and increase in the volume of trade between us.<br />
When Therc is such interdependence as has developed<br />
between our two countries, and interdependence of trade on a<br />
scale which has become important to us both, then inevitably<br />
problems arise and even some dangers to thc economy of each,<br />
because we have developed so strong an interest and<br />
participation in the economic development of the other,-that<br />
whatever happens to one country is of consequence to that<br />
othce" country. And this gives importance to the e:: istence<br />
of your own Committee. The closer our interdependence<br />
becomes, the wider its scope, the more important it is that<br />
we should have at a high level of consultation people from<br />
both countries who can help to iron out the difficulties,<br />
who can inform each other as to economic developments in the<br />
other country and in this way develop a more constructive<br />
and harmonious teamwork which will produce the most favourable<br />
results for each of us. I believe we are fortunate and<br />
I speak for the Government and our people in that there<br />
should have been from the outset such a high level of<br />
representation in this Australia/ Japan Business Co-operation<br />
Committee. Those from Australia, of course, are well known<br />
to you and as you have no doubt already discovered, they<br />
include some of the outstanding figures in the industrial<br />
and commercial life of this country. Of those who come to<br />
us from Japan, most of you I know only by repute or of the<br />
vast organisation which you represent. But I am glad to s<br />
see in your company today, a very old friend from my own days<br />
as Treasurer of the Commonwealthin the person of Mr. Honie.<br />
I give him a warm welcome, and he is, I believe, a<br />
representative of the high calibre of membership of this<br />
Committee which means so much to the prosperity and to the<br />
strength of our two countries.<br />
lie have a mutual interest as two great trading<br />
countries you, I think, ranking seventh in importance in<br />
world trade and Australia ranking twelfth we have an<br />
important interest together in the development of satisfactory<br />
international trading relationships, and so we wish to see<br />
come out of taie KennmV Round of negotiations a further<br />
liberalirsation of the trade of the world.<br />
We have also a mutual interest in seeing the<br />
restoration of peaceful conditions in the countries of Asia<br />
and in particular in war-torn South East Asia. We have<br />
been able to demonstrate in our own trade one with the other </p>
<p>what can be achieved under conditions of peace, and we share<br />
a vision of the growth in trade anid prosperity and wellbeing<br />
which could occur in the countries of Asia if conditions of<br />
peace could be re-established there. There is a growing<br />
willingness around the world, particularly from the United<br />
States where PreLident Johnson has undertaken to outlay<br />
at least one billion dollars in peaceful reconstruction<br />
and economic development in South East A; Aa if peaceful<br />
conditions can be re-established There is this willingness<br />
to help, and we with you in Japan, have a mutual interest in<br />
promoting to the best advantaga that we can causes which will<br />
assist in restoring peace in this troubled area of the world.<br />
We have in A-. ia a population today of some 1,500<br />
million. It is an awesome thought that by the end of this<br />
century that population may have doubled and all the<br />
indications are that this will occur. I believe myself<br />
that not sufficiont thought as yet is being given by the<br />
more advanced industrialised nations of the world to the<br />
problems which will be presented to the world by this quite<br />
dramatic developmient in the population structuie of Asia in<br />
particular and the world as a whole. Japan and Australia<br />
have an important part to play in meeting both the<br />
opportunities and the challenges which will develop from<br />
this remarkable economic phenomenon of our time.<br />
One of the happy recent developments has been the<br />
creation of the As~ ia D -, velopmnent Bank, and the importance of<br />
this is clearly recognisud by your country from the evidence<br />
supplied in the major contribution of $ 200 million which you<br />
have committed yourselves to supply to the resources of the<br />
bank. Australia, too, has recognised the opportunity here<br />
for constructive assistance around the whole of the Asian<br />
area and we have, as you know, subscribed, or committed<br />
ourselves to the extent of $ 85 million to the planned total<br />
of $ 1,000 million ( American) to be the initial capital of<br />
the bank. This ia a hop
we expect to see emerge in this part of the world.<br />
It may interest you to know, gentlemen, that of<br />
the prospective investors who come to Australia front<br />
overseas, an increasing proportion, as they discuss these<br />
matters with me, are looking to Australia these days, not<br />
merely as a market for the products of their manufacture here,<br />
but are seeing in Australia a base or launching place for<br />
their own increasing trade in the countries of Asia. And<br />
so we become, as a result of these processes, an even more<br />
important trading partner with Japan. Vie can only<br />
anticipate favourable omens for the future in the light of<br />
opportunities that we see ahead of us.<br />
No doubt we will have many problems to meet along<br />
the road but our two economies are so clearly supplementary<br />
or complementary to each other that we would be lacking in<br />
any normal spirit of optimism if wie did not foresee a<br />
tremendous~ growth of trade in the years ahead between our<br />
two countrie. s, contributing to a more peaceful and prosperous<br />
Asia and indeed, we would hope, contributing to the trade<br />
of the world. </p>
<p>4.<br />
It is with that background to your discussions that<br />
I now formally declare your meetings open and extend to you<br />
my best wishes for fruitful diucussion and a valuable outcome<br />
from talks together which I assure you, on behalf of the<br />
Australian Government, we regard as being oi great<br />
importance to this country.<br />
My best wishes to you all. </p>
