    <content><![CDATA[<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Joining us in the studio now is the Prime Minister, John Howard. Prime Minister, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Do you think your position with a nation - Australia I'm talking about - a divided nation and a party that, it has to be said, is still somewhat restless. Do you think your position has been strengthened by what the President said yesterday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think our position is the right position. The question of whether it's been strengthened or weakened by an individual speech, even an important one is really one... something I can't make a judgement about at the present time. What was good out of that speech was that he catalogued Iraq's transgressions, he reminded the Security Council of its obligation. And very importantly, he said that the new material would be taken to the Security Council, as it should be, by Colin Powell next week. That's going to be an important meeting and won't be the last meeting of the Security Council. But what is at stake here is whether it is in Australia's interest to join a world effort to stop the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons into the hands of countries like Iraq. It scares me that we might go on living in a world where countries like Iraq with a terrible record of aggression and use of those weapons should be able to retain them and by then retaining them, other countries of similar ilk will also want them. I mean, I pose the question again - how do we expect to control North Korea, which is in our region, if the Security Council does not control Iraq.   Now, I think these are the issues that are particularly relevant to Australians.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right. Now, you've made several points and I want to take you up on them in order. But can I ask you, do you now agree that America's position is clearer than ever before - if Iraq doesn't completely change its position, there'll be war.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, America is making it very plain it wants this issue resolved, but it clearly wants it preferably resolved through the Security Council. But that is our position, it's always been our position. And can I just say again to people who criticise America - this issue would not be back with the Security Council had it not been for American pressure. The inspectors would not be in Iraq had it not been for American pressure...</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But they haven't found any.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look at Blix. I mean, that report of Blix could hardly be more damning, could hardly be more damning. It was much tougher than a lot of people expected.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Do you know what the new evidence Colin Powell's going to present next week? Do you know what it is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know the detail of it... let me say this - you have exchanges with close allies on things like this, but I don't presume to know the detail of it or to know the extent of it. It's American intelligence and it's for America to disclose that and in any event, if you have a close intelligence relationship with a country you respect it.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Talking of knowing, can you tell me this morning what do you know that France, Germany and China don't know? Why are you so convinced that war with Iraq now is the solution, when they aren't convinced?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm convinced that the real solution is compliance by Iraq with the Security Council resolution - that's what I want, that is my overwhelming preference. Steve, I don't want a war, nobody in their right mind wants a war. It's a horrible thing, but we have a situation where for twelve years this country has thumbed its nose at the rest of the world. We have a renewed resolution that France, and China, and Russia, and all the other members joined in unanimously and that resolution talks of material breach, it talks of serious consequences. Now, I want the Security Council of the United Nations to do its job and if it does its job, one way or another under the authority of the Security Council, Iraq will be disarmed.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But if it doesn't do its job, we're in.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a final decision that we have to make against the background of what comes out of the Security Council. At this stage, we don't know the final outworking of the Security Council.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But you've made your mind up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, I've made my mind up very strongly that it's in Australia's interest to see the spread of these weapons stopped. I believe that very strongly. I don't think it is in Australia's interest to have a situation where these weapons spread. I certainly don't want a situation where controlling North Korea, which is in our region, is made more difficult because the world caves into Iraq.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But just... let me quote you three headlines in the papers this morning that suggest it's time you fessed up - </p>
