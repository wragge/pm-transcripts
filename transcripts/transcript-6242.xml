CHC AGAINST DEIVR EMBARGOED UNTIL DLVR<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL OFFICE<br />
1983/ 84 EDUCATION AND ENROLMENT CAMPAIGN<br />
MELBOURNE 14 OCTOBER 1983<br />
Few Australians will have forgotten how<br />
the precipitate closure of the electoral rolls before<br />
the las~ k. election effectively disenfranchised nearly 200,000<br />
of our fellow Australians.<br />
In one fell swoop he deprived many of those who had<br />
suffered most from the policies of his Government of their<br />
right to vote. Th~ e closure of the electoral rolls within an hour<br />
of the last Parliament being dissolved was a cynical act,<br />
totally at odds with the democratic traditions of this<br />
country. It did, however, serve one useful purpose.<br />
It drew attention to the large number of eligible<br />
Australian's who had failed to register to vote.<br />
That number continues to be unacceptably high.<br />
A recent AuIstralian Electoral Office survey<br />
indicated that between 500,000 and 600,000 eligible<br />
Australian residents have failed to register to vote.<br />
We cannot afford to shrug this situation aside.<br />
Full and effective participation by all<br />
Australian's in our political system is necessary to the<br />
health of that system and, ultimately, to the achievement of<br />
strong, effective and truly representative Government.<br />
We should all be concerned that so many fail to<br />
enrol, * to vote, and to exercise their right to participate<br />
in our system of parliamicntary democarcy.<br />
Already we have moved to simplify the procedures<br />
involved. The new plain English enrolment forms are a<br />
distinct improvement on those previously used.<br />
But it is esp,-cially diStUrbing that behind this<br />
failure to exercise basic democratic rights and<br />
responsibilities a failure heavily concentrated among our<br />
young people lies an appalling iljnorarce,. apathy an:-<br />
cynicism. </p>
<p>Quite apart from widespread ignorance of enrolment<br />
procedures, an Australian Electoral Office survey recently<br />
found an almost universal lack of confidence among young,<br />
unenrolled Australians that their vote has any significant<br />
impact on government, the Parliament, the bureaucracy and<br />
their own lives.<br />
As a Government we aim to reverse this situation<br />
to provide information, motivation and reason, where now<br />
there is ignorance, apathy and cynicism.<br />
Every Australain has a role t~ o play in the<br />
Government-of this country.<br />
Every Australian must be able to feel represcnted<br />
in Parliament and must be able to feel that he or she has<br />
confidence in the democratic and parliamentary process-.<br />
We politicians have a particular responsibility in<br />
this reqard. We must, as Kim Beazley put it in the House<br />
recently, earn credibility through performance; through our<br />
policies ar~ d actions we have to show<br />
that a vote is a worthwhile and<br />
meaning ful exercise.<br />
I am especially pleased that Alan Griffiths, the<br />
Member, for Maribyrnong is with us today. As the youngest<br />
Member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on electoral<br />
reform and as one of the youngest Members of the House of<br />
Representatives, he has a particular appreciation of the<br />
issues involved it) this campaign.<br />
I expect him both on the Government's and my own<br />
behalf and within the constraints of his own already heavy<br />
schedule of commitments to be active in carrying this<br />
exercise forward.<br />
The campaign we are launching today is cruIcial.<br />
It also, despite the background of the pre-election<br />
situation, has the support of both sides of politics.<br />
Mr Steel Hall's recent suggestion that the campaigni<br />
be bipartisan a suggestion made in resonse to IMr Bcoazley's<br />
invitation to Members from both sides of the House to jioin<br />
together in explaining the aims and purposes of the campaign<br />
is welcome. We look forward to the Opposition getting behind<br />
this effort. Surprisingly our campaign is unprecedented. </p>
<p>Costing $ 3.35 million, it is a sophisticated,<br />
carefully integrated education and information exercise<br />
directed not just at the unenrolled but to all Australians.<br />
Without exception we owe it to ourselves and to our<br />
society that we all know and exercise our electoral rights<br />
and responsibilities. In this sense this campaign is one which not only<br />
should succeed it must succeed. </p>
