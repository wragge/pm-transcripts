DISARMAMENT AND NUCLEAR TESTS<br />
SPEECH BY THE FPITI MJT. II. R TF RT. , ONO , ENZI<br />
IN TH7 THROIUPSRESOESF ENTAES<br />
1iTH MAY. 1 02<br />
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell i<br />
has read us, very carefully, a long statement and I must say tha'<br />
throughout the first 90 per cent of it I wonered hether e ha<br />
any uoint on which to criticise the statement that had been made<br />
by the Minister for xcternal Affairs ( Sir Garfield Barwick).<br />
However, in the last bit, if I may so describe it, he went throu<.-></.->
the motions of warming up, and this produced suitable applause<br />
from his, until then, bemused followers. But one thing that he<br />
said and I have had the advantage of reading this paper was<br />
this " Yet there is no suggestion or offer of any contribution<br />
comparable to that being spent on nuclear weapons by the<br />
nations involved and their allies so that the causes of<br />
these diseases and physical and social ills can be cured".<br />
That is, of course, what might be described as a distributive<br />
allegation. It is put forward as an allegation as much against<br />
the United States of America and the United Kingdom, the i'estern<br />
Pouwers, as against thc; Soviet Union,<br />
I fear, Sir, that the honourable gentleman has<br />
forgotten that if anybody cared to examine the contributions made<br />
in the field of health, in the field of research, in the<br />
production of the great antibiotics in the positive combatting o:'<br />
disease, he would find that the Jostern world has an unchallengei<br />
position in those fields. He would also find that there are<br />
millions of people who can gaz,-from time to time on the sputni:<br />
and other things that may be put into the sky by the Soviet Unio?'"<br />
who would not be there to see then if it had not been for the<br />
devoted, scientific and medical research of the free world.<br />
Therefore, the honourable gentleman falls into error, if I may be<br />
allowed to say so, in distributing these allegations as if they<br />
applied with equal force to both sides in this groat and unhappy<br />
conflicto I want to try to direct the attention of the House to<br />
the real problems that we have to consider. The honourabld<br />
gentleman has made, I am happy to say, several references to the<br />
communioue of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, issued at the<br />
time of the last conference in March of last yearo I know<br />
something about this, because I was one of those Prime Ministers.<br />
I also know that no communique emerges from a Primo Ministrs'<br />
Conference unless it refers to matters upon which unanimous<br />
agreement has been reached. That is something that honourable<br />
members should note nothing is included in such a communique<br />
unless it has oeon unanimously , greed that it should be included.<br />
Therefore, on the occasion in question all the Prime Ministers<br />
agreed to the statement made with regard to atomic testso These<br />
are the precise words of itz<br />
" Every effort should be made to secure rapid agreement to<br />
the permanent banning of nuclear weapons tests by all<br />
nations, and to arrangements for verifying the observances<br />
of the agroeemnt. Such an agreement is urgent, since<br />
otherwise other countries may soon become nuclear powers,<br />
which would increase the danger of war and further<br />
complicate the problem of disarmament Moreover, an<br />
agreement of nuclear tests, apart from its direct advantages<br />
would provide a powerful psychological impetus to agroement<br />
over the wider field of disarmament." </p>
<p>I think those words are well worth quoting. WJe and I speak as<br />
one of the parties heartily sapported that statement, and we<br />
supported it for the simple sake of humanity. The profound cause<br />
of humanity required, in our mind, that a statement of this kind<br />
should be made. There were talks about disarmament. There were<br />
conferences about it, They were abortive. You can go on talking<br />
about disarmament, in the general, for a long time. But her., in<br />
our view, was a specific matter on which we thought, or at any<br />
rate hoped, that sensible people of all nations could agree. We<br />
hoped that they could all agree to stop further testing of nuclear<br />
weapons, and we said so, the Prime Minister of Great Britain<br />
amongst us. And what happened? It was not more than a few months<br />
thereafter when the Soviet Union, which had itself undertaken to<br />
conduct no further tests pending agreement on their abolition,<br />
and at the very time when the powers were meeting in Geneva to<br />
discuss not only the general principle of abolishing tests, but<br />
also the essential correlative of effecting inspection, so that<br />
we might not be misled, simply broke up the discussions, walked<br />
out and within 48 hours began a series of at least 30 nuclear<br />
tests, preparations for which had obviously been made long before,<br />
That is the kind of problem that the world is dealing<br />
with. We need not live in a world of abstract phrases. wie are<br />
living in a most terribly difficult world, -e are living in a<br />
world of stark realities and unless we admit the existence of<br />
these realities we will walk into danger.<br />
That was the position,. and our distinguished visitor of<br />
the other night I am not going to discuss any other matters in<br />
connection with his visit because honourable members are quite<br />
entitled to their views about everything that he said made this<br />
statement: " Wlhile we were still negotiating, they"<br />
The Soviet Union<br />
" broke the moratorium on testing with a longand obviously<br />
long prepared, series of tests, evertheless, we<br />
The United States of America<br />
" stood on our offer to conclude a test ban treaty, and with<br />
an inspection arrangement that would have involved an<br />
international inspection team looking at less than 1/ 2000th<br />
of the territories of the Soviet Union in any given year.<br />
Honourable members on both sides of the House will recall that one<br />
of the pretences of the Soviet Union was that it could not have<br />
inspection because this would involve espionage inside its<br />
borders. The statement went on<br />
" But, as the Soviets were still unwilling to agree, President<br />
Kennedy felt obliged to resume our own testing for the<br />
security of the free world. As you knovw, he reached that<br />
decision most reluctantly. And we stand prepared to stop<br />
testing at any moment that the Soviets ; gree to a test ban<br />
treaty with essential international verification",<br />
That is a pretty plain statement by the man who, as second to the<br />
President of the United States, occupies one of the most<br />
responsible and powerful positions in the world. </p>
<p>He went on<br />
" But the President of the United States will not acce. pt the<br />
responsibility for allowring people who want their kind of<br />
world order to move ahead of the free uorld in this nuclea.<br />
field".<br />
I wonder who disagrees with that? I wonder if thero is a. nybody :. n<br />
this House I do not really believe there is who believes tha<br />
after all this series of tests by the Soviet Union which will ad,:<br />
enormously to the Soviet Union's knowledge and technology in thi.-<br />
field, the U. S. A. should have said, " Jell, you can have it; we<br />
will d) nothing about it. &gt; e are prepared to stabilize the<br />
knowledge of the free world in this field while you go on year<br />
after year, mnonth after month so that you will have the power to<br />
impose on the world what is to us your rotten system of government'"Ã¸<br />
Really, Mr. Speaker, I would have thought it hardly admitted of<br />
debate. Now, there are practical issues here and I think that<br />
unless they are resolved by unanimity in this House they ought to<br />
be analyzed frankly on both sides of the chamber. The first of<br />
then is involved in what I have just said: Should the wostern<br />
nuclear powers cease testing whatover the Soviet does? When I say<br />
that, let me elaborate a little, I fool that there is a great<br />
assumption in many minds that all thuse tests are tests of<br />
weapons to be deposited on the enemy and to destroy or to blast<br />
his cities. But we have got to a stage when a great deal of<br />
testing in the world is of what are called the anti-missile missles,<br />
These tests are devoted to discovering how to defend a country anc.<br />
how to defend hundreds of thousands of innocent people against an<br />
attack from the air. You cannot have one of these things done ard<br />
forget about the other. You cannot have the Soviet Union<br />
perfecting its means of attack and perhaps developing its means f<br />
resistance by special exporiments in the nuclear field and say to<br />
our own side and do not let us forget that, alive or dead it iour<br />
side " You are not to do it. You stop where you are". All<br />
these experimentations that go on have not only a relevance to<br />
attack but also a relevance to defence. Therefore, I propound my<br />
question and I would like to think that it reached the people of<br />
Australiat Should the Jstern nuclear powers cease testing nuclear<br />
devices w hatever the Soviet Uniujn does? The clear answer to thaL<br />
in the name of humanity is: No.<br />
The second issue is this: Can there be any effective<br />
cessation of testing which could give to the world a feeling that<br />
there was a calm in the storm or a hope for ordinary humanity,<br />
unless we have inspection or verification whatever the word<br />
might be? Are we so naive in the free world we are not really;<br />
we have a long history of practical wisdom and experiment, but I<br />
repeat: Are we so naive as to say to the prospective enemy the<br />
country which is the groat and. only threat to the peace of the<br />
world " We will take your word for it? ' ie do not want anybody to<br />
go near your country to see whether you are conducting tests or<br />
not", Can anybody imagine such a thing? The United States of<br />
America, the great western nuclear power, and the other ; wstern<br />
powers have gone to great lengths, as we ; wcre reminded the other<br />
night, to reduce their d.-. eands for verific. tion to a more minimum,<br />
Are they to abandon those demands? we sleep more<br />
comfortably if they did? '/ ould the ban-the-bomb processionists<br />
sleep more comfortably if they knew that on our side tests had<br />
ceased and development had come to an end, and that we were rel;. ng<br />
upon the punic faith of the authorities in the Kremlin? I do not<br />
believe it. Ue say: No. I do not know ! that other people might<br />
say, but we say: No. </p>
<p>In the third place there is an issue that perhaps<br />
scarcely emerged in what my honourable opponent had to say but it<br />
is clearly implicit in certain things that have happened. It is<br />
this: Should Australia, not a nuclear power herself remember that<br />
in 1ll these mat-' ers permanently contract herself out of<br />
permitting nuclear : reapons to be used in w ar or defence or in the<br />
grave arbitrament of , war on her s: il? . ucause I did hear<br />
suggestions that when the Minister for External Affairs ( Sir<br />
Garfield Barwick) said we were not prepared to give a permanent<br />
undertaking to that effect, he was under criticism. Under<br />
criticism,' Have we reached the very ecstasy of suicide in<br />
Australia? Are we prepared to say that come war, come peace,<br />
come any circumstances nobody shall bring a nuclear -reapon on our<br />
soil or discharge a weapon of that kind there? Are we bent on<br />
self-destruction or are we prepared to sit up and wake up to the<br />
fact that those nuclear powers which are on our side in the<br />
contest of freedom, cannot protect us if we warn them off the<br />
premises in perpetuity.<br />
These are the three questions. All must have<br />
considerable difficulty in understanding how there could be any<br />
more than the one clear answer to any of them. There is certainly<br />
nothing in what the honourable gentloman has said that in form<br />
cuts across what I have boon saying in these matters; but if<br />
there is a feeling in this Parliament anywhere that this attitude<br />
is wrong, let us . for the sake of our own self respect, for the<br />
sake of our standing in the world and for the sake of our<br />
capacity to talk to the other countries of the world, learn it now-,<br />
Let them stand up and be counted. </p>
