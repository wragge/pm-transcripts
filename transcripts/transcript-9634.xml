STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM MISSION TO FRANCE<br />
The delegation representing members of the South Pacific Forum, which I<br />
foreshadowed yesterday, will have discussions in Paris with the French<br />
Foreign Minister, Mr Herve de Charette, on Monday 19 June.<br />
The purpose of the delegation's visit is to make clear directly and<br />
unambiguously to the Government of France the deep resentment felt by<br />
South Pacific countries at the French Government's decision to resume<br />
nuclear testing in the South Pacific region and to seek reconsideration of that<br />
decision. All the countries of the Forum deplore the decision and urge the<br />
Government of France to reconsider.<br />
The Forum has a long history of opposition to nuclear testing, reflected, for<br />
example, in the adoption of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone.<br />
The mission will be led by Senator Evans, representing Australia as the<br />
current Chair of the Forum. Other members will include President Bernard<br />
Dowiyogo of Nauru, the Immediate past Chair of the Forum, and a special<br />
envoy from Papua New Guinea, which will assume the Chair of the Forum at<br />
the next Heads of Government Meeting in September. The Secretary-<br />
General of the South Pacific Forum, the Hon leremia Tabai, will also<br />
participate in the mission, Mr Tabal is the former President of Kribati.<br />
Discussions are underway with other Forum members which have also<br />
expressed an interest in participation.<br />
