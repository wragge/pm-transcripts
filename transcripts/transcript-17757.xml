Prime Minister Julia Gillard today confirmed that Her Majesty The Queen will travel to Australia for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth later this year.</p>
<p>Her Majesty will be accompanied on her visit by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The Queen's last visit to Australia was in 2006, when she opened the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Previously, in 2002, The Queen attended CHOGM in Coolum, Queensland.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the Royal visit is an important and exciting development in the preparations for CHOGM 2011.</p>
<p>CHOGM will be held from 28-30 October and is expected to attract as many as 3000 delegates from more than 50 nations.</p>
<p>CHOGM 2011 will be the biggest international event ever held in Perth and is a unique opportunity to showcase Perth and Western Australia as modern, world class destinations.</p>
<p>Commonwealth leaders meet at CHOGM every two years to discuss global and Commonwealth issues and to agree on collective policies and initiatives.</p>
<p>Around 1,000 representatives from the media are also expected to cover the event.</p>
