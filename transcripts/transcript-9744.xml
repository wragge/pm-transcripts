TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF THE NEW INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL<br />
AT THE BRISBANE AIRPORT, BRISBANE, 5 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well thank you very much, Laurie [ Brereton], Frank Conroy, Premier,<br />
Parliamentary colleagues and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well it is a pleasure to open such a lovely building. This is an obviously<br />
elegant and functional thing and what I like about it is that this is not an<br />
international building. It wasn't borrowed from the plan cupboard of some<br />
firm of American architects, or European architects. It was designed by<br />
Queensland architects I think the name is Bligh Voller. They were involved,<br />
also, in the other terminal and I congratulate them and I congratulate the<br />
builders, Civil Civic, for doing something that reflects the confidence all of<br />
us have in Australia.<br />
This building is a confident building. It says something about Australia and it<br />
says something about Queensland and I think the confidence that Australia<br />
has, Queensland has by the bucket. This-is a very confident place. I think it<br />
has and I have said recently a wind behind it now in Queensland it didn't<br />
have so many years ago. And it may be that the state of political opinion is<br />
divided in Queensland, but the state of confidence certainly isn't.<br />
It is growing. It is growing at the moment about 1 percentage point faster<br />
than the rest of Australia and it is a great tribute to Wayne Goss and his<br />
Government that when the rest of the country is moving along at 3.7 per cent,<br />
Queensland is moving along at 4.6 per cent or 4.7 per cent.<br />
So it is, I think, not just simply an addition to the stock of the aviation assets<br />
in this country, but it is a building which says something about a few<br />
important statements. One, about Australian architecture; two, about our<br />
confidence; three, about the pride we have in the place; and, I think it<br />
beckons to the neighbourhood we live in saying that here is an entrance to<br />
Australia from the rest of the world, or an exit from Australia to the world we<br />
live in around us, because we know we are now part of that community as we<br />
have never been before and that we know we are a welcome part of that<br />
community as well. </p>
<p>2<br />
We were just speaking at the table here talking about the impact of the<br />
Kansei regional developments and Osaka airport, the impact that had here on<br />
Brisbane, that one development. And we know that one of the great<br />
challenges of foreign economic policy in these years will be preparing the<br />
world for the entrance of the Chinese economy to it. That huge country with<br />
its vast, rapidly growing economy and with it, of course, will be wealth,<br />
consumerism, travel. All of this is going to have a major impact upon the rest<br />
of us, upon our lives, upon our outlook and upon our business and travel<br />
opportunities and these are all things, I think, that we are preparing for here.<br />
If you look at Brisbane Airport, the domestic terminal and the international<br />
terminal, you would have to say this a place going somewhere. This is a<br />
place that wants people to come here. So I think that we are in that part of<br />
the world where most of the major decisions in aviation are going to be made<br />
and we made a few big ones ourselves in One Nation.<br />
We took away any of the interface between the domestic and international<br />
carriage of passengers. We folded Australian Airlines into Qantas. We gave<br />
Ansett an international license. We have sought to build and we haven't yet<br />
a trans-Tasman air service, a single Australasian destination, a single<br />
Australasian airline market. But we have succeeded, I think, in strengthening<br />
Qantas, which will now be a capital adequate company. In times of scarce<br />
resources, Governments can't put the capital into businesses such as<br />
Qantas.<br />
We did a trade sale with British Airways which will bring, not only synergies,<br />
but some airline intelligence to the board beyond that which, of course,<br />
resides their naturally. But from, of course, another company with a different<br />
perspective. Qantas will be a strong airline. The challenge now will be to<br />
make Ansett strong and that will mean keeping the capital up to it and seeing<br />
the growth opportunities come and seeing the development of a good solid<br />
aviation market in Australia and in Australasia. These, I think, have all been<br />
milestones. We have sought in that One Nation package not only to kick start the<br />
economy back to growth, which in fact it has succeeded in doing but, at the<br />
same time, drawing all the transport linkages together. Only just a month or<br />
two ago, Laurie Brereton and I and the Premier have had the pleasure of<br />
getting on the One Nation train, which is the first standard gauge linkage<br />
between Brisbane and Perth, via Melbourne.<br />
Now we are talking about bringing Track Australia into being, which will have<br />
one track, a track business, whose job it will be to run a competitive<br />
permanent way on which all manner of railway companies and locomotive<br />
operators can operate, so we can start to see some balance back in our<br />
transport away from road, to rail see these efficiencies rise while, at the<br />
same time, we are seeing hubbing and also these linkages with the aviation<br />
industry. So, there were, I think, some important touch stones there, certainly for<br />
aviation. One of them was to bring the development of this airport forward.<br />
Another through this period, of course, has been to fund the capital </p>
<p>subscriptions we have needed for the FAG and to guarantee its borrowing<br />
program and I'd like to take this opportunity to add to Laurie Brereton's<br />
remarks in congratulating Frank Conroy and his fellow Directors on a job well<br />
done in building quite rapidly the aviation assets, the terminal assets we've<br />
needed in Sydney, Melbourne, Alice Springs, Darwin, Brisbane et cetera. To<br />
get that critical mass for us for the growth in the tourism industry which we<br />
have had. We can now start to sell those assets off, but we have now a<br />
critical mass of assets that actually work for the country.<br />
By bringing those market disciplines to aviation we are going to see a better<br />
industry. We will see, probably, better services over time, tighter services,<br />
better price services. We can see it in aviation when we deregulated the<br />
airline industry, we saw prices fall by around 20 to 25 per cent and a 60 per<br />
cent plus increase in passenger movements and already Sydney airport when<br />
we sat down looking at that second runway, I think, Sydney is now just in a<br />
few years since we began that construction is already well into the turn of<br />
the century traffic levels that have arrived in an unanticipated way from the<br />
deregulation of the airline system.<br />
So, these things have happened and it does mean that we have a very large<br />
tourism market on our hands and one which we can grow and, of course, with<br />
the Olympics coming up at the end of the century it is going to make a terrific<br />
difference to that.<br />
But, I think, the thing that is making the greatest difference is the confidence<br />
we have in ourselves. The confidence we have in Australia. The faith we<br />
have in what we are able to do. Our sense of ourselves and our identity. All<br />
these things are underpinning the growth of our tourism market, it is<br />
underpinning the growth of the economy and here we are bolting along at<br />
around 4 per cent growth with a couple per cent of inflation, just about the<br />
highest employment growth in the western world and at the same time<br />
anticipating now the building of a pacific rim community through bodies like<br />
APEC, making these bilateral linkages around the region with important<br />
countries we trade with and now grow with and live with. These are, I think,<br />
the hallmarks of the sort of view we will always have of the place.<br />
I was very pleased to see our Aboriginal dancers with us because Aboriginal<br />
culture and tradition is now an important part of Australia's culture and<br />
tradition. There was a milestone met when the High Court said that<br />
Aboriginal custom and tradition will be a source of Australian common law<br />
and there is a native title there. The ' Government had the pleasure of<br />
legislating that. But not just that, in the celebration of those traditions and<br />
customs, we are seeing that also reflecting in our tourism industry. We are<br />
pleased about it and we know that when we come to terms with the Aboriginal<br />
community we will come to terms with ourselves and understand better and<br />
appreciate more the fact that this ancient continent has been bequeathed to<br />
us and that they have held it in trust down through the centuries for us to<br />
enjoy with them.<br />
This view of Australia and Asia is important. Those societies around us like<br />
Indonesia 200 million people old societies, say, show us how they treat<br />
their indiginies and we'll see how they treat us. It is an indication of whether </p>
<p>Australia has turned over a leaf or whether it hasn't. Whether it is still the<br />
country that only 20 years ago selected people on the basis of race for<br />
immigration. It is not a long time ago. They are big sins to live down, but we<br />
have made a great start.<br />
These are all the things, I think, that are caught up in the confidence we now<br />
have and we are now well and truly locked into the fastest growing part of the<br />
world. For instance, the thing that changed most our lives has been the 747,<br />
given us mobility that other generations have never had and yet the decision<br />
about whether Boeing puts another lid on the 747 or builds a new aircraft are<br />
going to be made in Asia. They are not going to be made in Europe or North<br />
America, they are going to be made in Asia. They are going to be made<br />
probably in APEC. They are going to be made in airports such as these and<br />
they will have huge implications for us when they are made.<br />
Today we do celebrate the opening of this terminal, in a way we are<br />
celebrating the buoyancy that Brisbane has as well. We are celebrating the<br />
fact that very shortly we are going to see further growth in air traffic<br />
movements here. This will be the second busiest airport in Australia before<br />
very much longer and I think the things the Premier mentioned the Casino,<br />
the Exhibition Centre even more perhaps poignantly and recently the<br />
Australia Remembers 50th commemoration, I think, lends further support to<br />
the notion that Brisbane has caught its wind and it is really off and running<br />
and it has got a critical mass and a depth and a cultural interest that it didn't<br />
have in the past. This should be a matter of great national joy. It is to me. It<br />
is why I am very happy to be here today to see this built in a Queensland<br />
way, a Queensland sort of building with new things, like, there is no interface<br />
( airside) of the building is now the one side with this innovation we see<br />
upstairs and there won't be a wailing wall anymore at the airport. We will be<br />
able to look through. So here we have got space, light, colour, elegance, we<br />
have got all of those things and it is unmistakably Australian. That is why I<br />
am so pleased to declare it officially open. Thank you.<br />
