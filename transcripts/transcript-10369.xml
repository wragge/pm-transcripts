May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE MINERALS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ANNUAL DINNER<br />
GREAT HALL PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Jerry Ellis for those very kind and warm words of welcome; to Nick<br />
Stump the new President, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to the Leader of the<br />
Australian Democrats, my other parliamentary colleagues, in particular my friend and<br />
colleague, Warwick Parer, the Minister for Resources, and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It's a pleasure once again for me to address this annual dinner of a great Australian<br />
industry that contributes about $ 35 billion to our export income, about 7% of our gross<br />
domestic product and very significantly, for those in the Australian community who<br />
occasionally forget, the contribution to the social and welfare infrastructure of our nation<br />
about $ 2.4 billion in taxes every year which goes towards the provision of necessary<br />
facilities for the more needy and less fortunate in the Australian community.<br />
I talk to you at an annual dinner at a time of very intense debate in Australia about a<br />
number of very important economic, social and industry issues. And not surprisingly, I<br />
want to touch on some of them in my remarks tonight.<br />
But I would like to take the occasion of telling the audience, or those who don't know,<br />
that today I'm delighted to say legislation passed through the Senate under the guidance of<br />
Warwick Parer completing the abolition of export controls on all Australian commodities<br />
except uranium. Well, it's good to have some lively interaction. I always enjoy that, as<br />
you may have noticed. But that fulfils a longstanding commitment of the Coalition which<br />
we carried into Government. And I thank my colleagues in the Senate very warmly.<br />
Before touching on some of the industry and other issues that I wanted to mention tonight,<br />
could I take a few moments to traverse some of the things that my Government has<br />
achieved in the 12 months since I spoke to you last year. We have, on the budget front, I<br />
believe achieved an enormous amount. We have turned a deficit of $ 10.5 billion into a<br />
projected surplus of $ 1.6 billion at the completion of our first three years in government.<br />
The latest budget documentation reveals that by the Year 2000 the total national debt of<br />
Australia will be about 10% of gross domestic product, against a figure of 19.5% in the<br />
financial year of 1995/ 96. And this has been achieved without any tax increases, and it has<br />
also been achieved within a framework of implementing a number of very significant<br />
election commitments particularly in the area of family taxation and capital gains tax relief<br />
for the small business sector of Australia. </p>
<p>I'd also like to remind the audience of the quite major changes that have been achieved in<br />
the area of industrial relations. The Wor-kplace Relations Act represents without question<br />
the biggest single legislative change to Australia's industrial relations system since the end<br />
of World War 11. It has entrenched the use of enterprise bargaining. It will spread the use<br />
of Australian workplace agreements and certainly not least in the mining industry. It has<br />
restored the strength of the secondary boycott prohibitions, it has finally ended compulsory<br />
unionism and in every respect I believe it has ushered in an era of industrial relations where<br />
increasingly the emphasis will be on the making of bargains at a workplace level.<br />
The full benefit of this legislation will take time to filter through, but I already welcome the<br />
many signs that companies in the mining industry are taking advantage of the provisions of<br />
that legislation. In many other areas of course the process of reform is proceeding at a<br />
very considerable pace and I think of areas such as gas and electricity reform and I think of<br />
the other initiatives that have come out of the COAG process.<br />
In recent weeks there has been considerable debate about the importance of taxation<br />
reform to Australia's economic future. Let me say ladies and gentlemen that anybody who<br />
has any understanding and is prepared to address in a serious and honest fashion the<br />
challenges to the Australian economy must acknowledge the fact that we have a less than<br />
perfect taxation system.<br />
We have a taxation system that does rely too heavily on the taxation of income. We have a<br />
taxation system that generally speaking penalises exporters. We have a taxation system<br />
that still doesn't give enough incentive to savings and we have a taxation system that in<br />
several other respects works against economic growth and the creation of jobs. We also<br />
have a taxation system that is too easily evaded in a number of areas and it is very<br />
important therefore out of concern for the economic future of Australia that we engage in<br />
a serious and thorough going debate about the need for taxation reform.<br />
Many attempts have been made in the past about taxation reform to achieve it. Those<br />
attempts have occurred on both sides of politics and they have been marked with bitter<br />
debate and some severe internal difference of opinion, but the nation requires as we move<br />
towards the 21lst century that this issue again be embraced, and those who would argue<br />
that our system does not need change I think do fail the national interest. Those who<br />
oppose serious and fair change will I think be rightly regarded as people being chained to<br />
yesterday's taxation system.<br />
I've said that in assessing the need for reform and engaging in the debate the government<br />
will apply three very important considerations. We are not interested in reform for its own<br />
sake. We are not interested in some kind of a econometric model of taxation reform. We<br />
are interested in reform that delivers beneficial outcomes for the Australian community and<br />
the Australian people. We are interested in taxation reform, first and foremost which<br />
promotes job generation. We are interested in taxation reform that will boost and promote<br />
exports and we are interested in taxation reform that will boost living standards and<br />
encourage saving and promote incentive, and they will be the three great benchmarks<br />
against which we will assess the debate in the weeks and months and perhaps several years<br />
into the future. </p>
<p>Now, this is a very important debate. We have come a long way when you think of the<br />
state of the Australian economy 20 or 30 years ago when you think of structural rigidities<br />
although in other areas it was much stronger particularly in the area of employment. And<br />
we have broken down a lot of barriers and as a community we have embraced a number of<br />
very valuable reforms, but the last great outpost of I suppose economic backwardness that<br />
does require to be addressed in the Australian community, does require to be changed,<br />
does require to be reformed, is the Australian taxation system, and future generations and<br />
future leaders of industry and political parties in Australia will judge the current generation<br />
rather poorly and deservedly so if we muff the next opportunity to embrace and bring<br />
about valuable reform.<br />
It won't be easy and I don't pretend for a moment that the political process will be either<br />
costless or easy. But if the purpose of being in Government is the purpose of having<br />
responsibility is to do good things for the future of one's country, then all of us charged<br />
with political responsibility and who are concerned about the economic future of Australia<br />
will very seriously and conscientiously address the question of taxation reform. We will<br />
ask ourselves the fundamental question to we really believe that we can carry this country<br />
forward into the 21st century with the fundamentals of the current taxation system still in<br />
place and if we are completely candid in addressing that question we will have to say no<br />
we can't and therefore we should set about constructing a more effective taxation system<br />
for the new millennium.<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to touch briefly on a number of issues which are<br />
of particular concern to the mining industry but also of broader concern to the Australian<br />
community. Jerry Ellis in his very kind introduction mentioned the very difficult issue of<br />
native title. This is a complicated difficult issue, laden with a great deal of emotion which<br />
presents the Parliament with quite a unique challenge. The present native title Act is very<br />
seriously flawed. It was described by us in the lead up to the election as being unworkable.<br />
Superimposed on a flawed and significantly unworkable act we have what I regard as the<br />
highly impractical decision of the High Court of Australia in the Wik case. I say in<br />
' impractical" very deliberately and very advisedly. Like any other Australian citizen I am<br />
subject to the law of this country as interpreted from time to time by the courts of<br />
Australia. It's very important to remind ourselves of course, as members of Parliament, we<br />
have the right to change the law if we regard it as being unsatisfactory.<br />
The decision of the High Court of Australia to find that there could be co-existence on<br />
pastoral leases between farmers and native title claimants is fundamentally unworkable.<br />
And what I have sought to do and what my Government has sought to do, whilst<br />
respecting the principle of native title as laid down in the Mabo case and whilst<br />
understanding the significant difficulties and therefore rejecting blanket extinguishment of<br />
native title on pastoral leaseholds, what my Government has sought to do in consultation<br />
with all of the effected stakeholders and lengthy consultations with all of the effected<br />
stakeholdlers, what I have sought to do and what my Government has sought to do is to<br />
establish a fair basis for going forward. What has become known as the 10 Point Plan<br />
represents the distillation of that effort. It is a plan that does respect the principles of<br />
native title laid down in the Mabo case.<br />
I said at the beginning of this process that there were two things the Government would<br />
not do. One of those things was that we wouldn't seek to overturn the principles of native </p>
<p>title laid down by the High Court in the Mabo case and the second was that we wouldn't<br />
sit on our hands and do absolutely nothing. We've produced a plan that I believe will give<br />
certainty and security to pastoral lease holders. It will continue to respect the principles of<br />
native title laid down in the Mabo decision. And it will provide a workable mechanism for<br />
certainty and predictability for the mining industry.<br />
Now, it has not been easy to develop that plan. And as you know it has met resistance<br />
from some sections of the pastoral industry and some sections of that side of politics which<br />
I lead arid with which I'm associated. Equally it has been heavily criticised by many<br />
leaders of the indigenous community of Australia.<br />
I haven't lightly decided and my Government hasn't lightly decided that the 10 Point Plan<br />
is the right way to go. But we believe that it does achieve the right and the fair balance.<br />
We are determined to proceed with it. We hope that we can win the support of the Senate.<br />
I've already started discussions and provided detailed briefings to the Australian Labor<br />
Party, to the Australian Democrats and the same facilities are available to the Independent<br />
members of the Senate.<br />
It is in the national interest that this matter be resolved without undue delay. Although I<br />
acknowledge that the legislation, when it comes down, will be complicated and proper<br />
time, reasonable time must be allowed for its consideration. But I think any possibility of<br />
deliberate delay of the legislation with a view to some particular political advantage will<br />
not be warmly welcomed or greeted by any section of the Australian community.<br />
I acknowledge as Prime Minister that it Is a difficult emotional issue. I understand and<br />
sympathise with and respect the passionate emotional commitment of the indigenous<br />
people of Australia to land. I understand the importance of that in their culture. I respect<br />
that and I sympathise with it. I ask them to understand the importance of my Government<br />
delivering security and stability to the mining and pastoral industries. I ask them to accept<br />
that what I have done over past weeks and months has been done in good faith with a<br />
determination to achieve a fair balance.<br />
I am concerned about some characteristics of the debate on native title. And I am, of<br />
course, concerned about the possibility that if a fair and just solution is not accepted that<br />
will only bolster the hand of some of those more extreme and insensitive elements in the<br />
Australian community who would seek to take advantage of an impasse in a delicate and<br />
sensitive area such as this.<br />
I have to say also, ladies and gentlemen, that I am concerned about the insensitivity of a<br />
land claim which has been lodged in the Northern Territory today. As some of you may be<br />
aware, the Northern Land Council has lodged a large number of land claims today under<br />
the Aboriginial Lanid Right. 5 Northerni Territoiy Act, not of course the Nal, e Title Act.<br />
The claims had been lodged just prior to the commencement of the sunset clause which<br />
commences on the 4th of June. I understand that the claims include all national parks, all<br />
land set aside for potential development including the Ord River stage two, all vacant<br />
crown land and certain bays, gulfs, sea beds, islands and reefs. Such claims, I think, can<br />
only be described as very divisive and I think they will greatly harm the Northern Territory<br />
and investment in the Territory. And one has to question the motives of those who have<br />
promoted that claim.,. those claims, particularly against the background of the events of this </p>
<p>week. And I think an overwhelming desire on the part of all sections of the Australian<br />
community, despite the practical difficulties involved, to move forward in a very, very<br />
positive way in the area of reconciliation between all sections of the Australian community.<br />
I think a claim of this character is insensitive to that particular process and I very, very<br />
seriously question the motives of those responsible for making a claim which must cause<br />
enormous concern, as I know it already has, to the Northern Territory Government. I've<br />
already had a lengthy discussion with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory about it.<br />
And I think it is a very, very unfortunate development and does nothing to aid the climate<br />
that I know many of us would like to see improve in this area.<br />
The final matter that I want to touch on, ladies and gentlemen, is in relation to the<br />
environment. The mining industry has frequently been the target of strong criticism from<br />
environmentalists. However, while once the preserve of noisy fringes the environment is<br />
now a mainstream issue. And the mining industry, in a quite magnificent way, has<br />
responded to that.<br />
Restoration of sites and rehabilitation is now a very common part of mining in Australia.<br />
Environmental scientists are now employed alongside engineers and geologists and this<br />
process is showing great dividends. For instance, Alcoa has won international recognition<br />
for environmental excellence, for its work in rehabilitating mine areas in the south-east of<br />
Western Australia. Energy resources of Australia's Ranger uranium mine in the Northern<br />
Territory has won two environmental awards.<br />
As with most things it is important to find a sensible balance and that, of course, includes<br />
the environment. Nowhere in environmental policy is this more evident and more<br />
important than in the area of greenhouse gas negotiations. Australia as you know is<br />
working very hard to contribute to a fair and feasible outcome to the climate change<br />
negotiation. We seek an outcome which differentiates greenhouse gas emission targets according to<br />
each countries particular circumstances and available opportunities to limit omissions.<br />
We're not looking for a special deal, we are just looking for a fair outcome which reflects<br />
the unique character of the Australian economy. We are, in effect, seeking the same<br />
outcome as the Europeans are permitting within the umbrella of the European Union for<br />
the member States of that Union. Australia is one of only nine countries in the world left<br />
to conform with the proposed inequitable uniform omission targets at or below 1990<br />
levels. The European Union has already agreed to internal differentiation and supports it for<br />
economies in transition and developing countries. The Government will continue to<br />
promote Australia's position for differentiation at every conceivable opportunity. I raised<br />
it with the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Hashimoto, and also with the Chancellor of<br />
Germany, Dr Kohl, who contrary to media reports fully understood Australia's difficulty in<br />
the negotiations.<br />
This represents a particular challenge to the Australian national interest. The Australian<br />
national interest on this occasion is sharply different from the respective national interests<br />
of the member states of the European Union and the United States. In some respects the </p>
<p>Australian national interests more closely resembles that of Japan than any other advanced<br />
industrialised nation in this particular issue, a point that I made in some detail to the<br />
Japanese Prime Minister when he was here.<br />
Differentiation will give a much better long term solution to this global problem. It will<br />
provide the best basis for the most economically efficient and least trade distortionary<br />
solution to this very, very significant global problem. It will enhance the environmental<br />
outcomes by allowing a better basis for a truly collective global effort. Were Australia to<br />
go down the path of flat targets it would do very serious damage to the Australian<br />
economy. And I want to take this opportunity tonight of assuring the mining industry that<br />
the Government will continue to prosecute, with all the resources available to it,<br />
Australia's specific unique national Interest in this very sensitive and very important area.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen can I finish on a personal note. Can I thank Jerry Ellis for his kind<br />
remarks. Can I also thank him for his leadership of the Council over the past three years.<br />
Can I welcome his successor, Mr Stump. Can I also say how much my colleagues and I<br />
have enjoyed our association with your industry since our election to government in March<br />
of last year. It is a very important, vital industry to Australia's fuiture. It is a major wealth<br />
producer. It has world class standard. It is a significant employer of people. It is a section<br />
of Australian industry that is very important to the rural and regional areas of our nation<br />
and it is section of Australian industry that comes face to face, at a practical level, with the<br />
implications of cooperation and reconciliation between different sections of the Australian<br />
community. Over the years the Australian economy has benefited in a quite incalculable way from the<br />
mining industry. Our goals for the mining industry are specific in some areas and general<br />
in others. Our goals are to provide the industry with a stable low inflationary environment<br />
and I amn very proud of the fact that Australia continues to boast very low levels of<br />
inflation. We've seen significant reductions in interest rates, although it is fair to remark<br />
that real interest rates in Australia are still quite high by the standards of the industrialised<br />
world. We have delivered significant industrial relations reform, we are embracing the<br />
challenge of taxation reform, we are tackling head on in a painstaking and practical way<br />
the problems posed by an unworkable Native Title Act and an impractical High Court<br />
decision which has impacted on that legislation.<br />
I want to wish the industry well, I want to congratulate it on it enormous contribution to<br />
Australia, the wealth it has generated, the revenue it has provided for the less fortunate<br />
sections of the Australian community, the Australians it employs, the export income it<br />
delivers, and most importantly of all, the very high standards of professional integrity and<br />
skill which is a very important characteristic of the Australian mining industry.<br />
Thank you very very much indeed for having me as your guest. </p>
