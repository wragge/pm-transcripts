    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Andrew; to Richard Court, the Premier of Western</p>
<p> Australia; to Alan Coogan, the Chairman of Anaconda Nickel; to you</p>
<p> Sadie, thank you most warmly for your very gracious welcome extended</p>
<p> on behalf of your people; to my Federal colleague, Barry Haase, the</p>
<p> member for Kalgoorlie; to Graham Kieres and Collin Barnett, Ministers</p>
<p> in the Western Australian Government, other parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Can I say how very pleased I am to be associated with a project that</p>
<p> so evidently has brought together in a spirit of cooperation and a</p>
<p> sense of purpose different elements of the Australian community. When</p>
<p> I listened to what Sadie had to say in her welcome and when I listened</p>
<p> to what the Managing Director had to say about the cooperation between</p>
<p> the company and the Aboriginal people I thought what they were saying</p>
<p> represented something of a role model to the rest of Australia as</p>
<p> to the attitudes that should be taken and the path of action that</p>
<p> should be pursued. It is an attitude that says we must work together.</p>
<p> It's also an attitude to say that everybody in this community has</p>
<p> responsibilities as well as rights. And it's an attitude that says</p>
<p> that the wealth of this country should be shared and that the foundation</p>
<p> of individual achievement and self fulfillment is that people should</p>
<p> have a sense of dignity and self worth and a sense of economic empowerment</p>
<p> and a sense of economic independence. And I think they are a very</p>
<p> sound set of principles and I'm delighted that they have been practiced</p>
<p> in this marvelous project.</p>
<p>I've met a lot of managing directors and I've been to a lot of openings</p>
<p> in the 25 years that I've been in Parliament. I've been to a lot of</p>
<p> mines. I've been to a lot of factories. I've been to a lot of farms.</p>
<p> But I don't think I've met a more self-evidently enthusiastic and</p>
<p> dedicated managing director than I've met in Andrew Forrest. I have</p>
<p> the vague impression that he quite likes this venture and I have the</p>
<p> vague impression that he has a genuine affection for all of those</p>
<p> people who are associated with it. Because what you have gathered</p>
<p> here today are everybody who's played a role. And not least of course</p>
<p> you have the workforce. No enterprise, be it a mining enterprise or</p>
<p> a manufacturing enterprise or any other kind of enterprise is going</p>
<p> to be successful unless there's a spirit of cooperation with the workforce.</p>
<p> And that is clearly the case with this project as evidenced by the</p>
<p> speed with which things that normally take a long period of time have</p>
<p> been achieved, the cooperation and attitude of people and the spirit</p>
<p> of joint endeavor and joint commitment. And that speaks volumes not</p>
<p> only for the leadership of the company but it also speaks volumes</p>
<p> for those who are part of that great enterprise and most particularly</p>
<p> the workforce. And I want to acknowledge the contribution of the employees</p>
<p> of this joint venture for bringing it to where it is today and making</p>
<p> today possible and making the future that lies before all of us possible.</p>
<p>We're all entitled to a short commercial on an occasion like this.</p>
<p> And, of course, this opening is occurring at a time of very great</p>
<p> economic strength for the whole of Australia. Australia at the moment</p>
<p> is enjoying record levels of economic growth. It's enjoying the lowest</p>
<p> unemployment rate for more than 10 years. It's got the lowest inflation</p>
<p> rate, the lowest interest rates and probably the highest level of</p>
<p> international economic respect that this country has had in more than</p>
<p> 30 years.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I visited the United States. I wasn't terribly successful</p>
<p> on lamb but I was a little more successful when I went to New York</p>
<p> where, I've got to say, the knowledge of and understanding of Australia</p>
<p> is a lot deeper and a lot more sensitive than it sometimes is amongst</p>
<p> the politicians of Washington. And I found within the financial community</p>
<p> of New York a very great respect for the strength of the Australian</p>
<p> economy. Indeed in all the visits I've paid to that city over the</p>
<p> last 25 years I found on this occasion a stronger connection with,</p>
<p> knowledge of, and faith in the economic future of Australia than on</p>
<p> any occasion. Now, that's very important because there's.a bit of</p>
<p> money comes out of that city from time to time, not only into Australia</p>
<p> but into other parts of the world. So I think we are witnessing, in</p>
<p> general terms, a very good atmosphere for the Australian economy.</p>
<p>I recognise, of course, that commodity prices are not as good as they</p>
<p> might be. I was in Kalgoorlie recently and people had a few things</p>
<p> to say about the price of gold and I can understand some of the concerns</p>
<p> and I sympathise with them and I am very cognisant of them but I set</p>
<p> against them the general economic health of the country. And I want</p>
<p> to congratulate the Western Australian Government under Richard Court's</p>
<p> leadership for the pro-investment climate it's created so far as the</p>
<p> mining industry is concerned because unless you have governments that</p>
<p> are promoting investment in your industry then you're not going to</p>
<p> have a good atmospheric.</p>
<p>Now, this is a remarkable venture. When it's up and running it will</p>
<p> be the largest producer of cobalt in the world and it will be the</p>
<p> third largest producer of nickel. There's a billion dollars of investment</p>
<p> that have gone in to getting it started. It has an almost unrivalled</p>
<p> safety record. It's going to export something in the order of $500</p>
<p> million of export income when it's up and running. Now, that's not</p>
<p> bad for one individual company for one joint venture. And it's a remarkable</p>
<p> tribute to both of the companies that form the joint venture and it's</p>
<p> a remarkable tribute to all of those people that have made this possible.</p>
<p> And it really fills me with a great sense of satisfaction and pride</p>
<p> as Prime Minister of Australia to be associated with something that</p>
<p> is all positive about the future. We're associated with a project</p>
<p> that is going to generate wealth for our people. It is going to generate</p>
<p> jobs for Australians. It's going to generate export income for the</p>
<p> country. It's going to provide a valuable resource not only for Australia</p>
<p> but for the world community. And it's going to bring together in this</p>
<p> part of Western Australia a remarkable number of talents and a remarkable</p>
<p> number of skills. And in the hour or so that I looked over the plant</p>
<p> it does represent an aggregation of skill and commitment that is the</p>
<p> source of enormous pride to me and ought to be a source of enormous</p>
<p> satisfaction to all of those associated with it.</p>
<p>So to you, Andrew; to you Mr Coogan, Alan, the Chairman of the company,</p>
<p> to everybody else who's associated with it, I want to congratulate</p>
<p> you. I want to thank you for inviting me to come here today. I'm delighted</p>
<p> to be associated with such a tremendously successful, Australian venture.</p>
<p> I used an expression at my party's Federal Council meeting about a</p>
<p> month ago when I said that I wanted Australia to become a 'can do'</p>
<p> country. I wanted it to become a country that could do things better</p>
<p> and differently and more successfully than other countries could do</p>
<p> it. I wanted Australia to have enough belief and self confidence in</p>
<p> itself to know that it could do things sometimes differently and sometimes</p>
<p> against the tide and against the trends and against the predictions</p>
<p> in a way that other people didn't think were possible. I know a lot</p>
<p> of people thought that this project wasn't possible and a lot of people</p>
<p> were skeptical and critical and cynical and now it's been brought</p>
<p> to fruition. It's a marvelous demonstration of what I had in mind</p>
<p> when I used that expression. This is a great illustration of a 'can</p>
<p> do' community supported by a group of 'can do' Australians. I congratulate</p>
<p> you. And when I sit down and I'll then be asked to stand up again</p>
<p> and formally pull away the curtain but I do have great pleasure in</p>
<p> declaring this mine operation open. I congratulate all those associated</p>
<p> and I wish the company every success in the years to come. Thank you.</p>
