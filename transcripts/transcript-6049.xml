Tphe new port-folio of;: Spnocial Minister of State, under<br />
Mr Ylounc,, who w-. ill also beo Vice-President of the Executive<br />
Council and Leader of the liouse, will take over electoral<br />
matters and police and protective services and certain other<br />
policy functions from the Department of Acdiirn~ strative<br />
Services, which will be a more clearly focussed ' commnon<br />
service' 6epartrnent. This change will ailso enable a cjreater<br />
concentration on important lwenfrorcement responsibi lities.<br />
The ne-w Dep~ artmenit of Sport, Recreation and Tourism takes<br />
over responsibility for assistance to sport from Homie<br />
Affairs and Environment which, with the addiHtion of<br />
responsibilities for consumer affairs to its arts and<br />
environmient functions, can concentrate more closely on<br />
thoese i!-mportant areas.<br />

13cc au e of thec processes required by legislation for the<br />
appointment of Heads of Departments, legislation which the<br />
incoming Governmnent. will be reviewing, it is not possible<br />
to make final. appointments of Hasof the new Departments<br />
tomorrow: nor to mak1-e any other consequent changes that the<br />
Government mnight have in mind. Acting Secretaries will thlereor e<br />
be appointed to the fle%.' Departments. The Chairman of the Public<br />
Service Board will be asked to report to me on appoint-rnents in<br />
accordance wiTJth the terms of the l~ egislation and I expect that the<br />
Ccomplete list of appointments of U7eads of Departments will1 be<br />
cleared in Cabinet next week. The Acting Secretaries of the new<br />
