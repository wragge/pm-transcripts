    <content><![CDATA[<p>The whole world will mourn the passing of Mother Teresa. Her legendary work has touched the lives of many thousands of people right across the globe. On behalf of all Australians I salute her life of service to mankind and convey my deepest sympathy to those who worked closely with her, and our support to those who will continue her work in the Congregation which she established.</p>
<p>Her total commitment to helping the poor and the sick was a compelling demonstration of human compassion.</p>
<p>6 September 1997</p>
