SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P..<br />
AT THE M. T. I. A. SEMINAR HELD IN MELBOURNE ON<br />
THURSDAY, 21 JUNE. 1973<br />
In accepting your invitation, I must say I had some<br />
reservations about your promotional brochure.<br />
It says: " If you open this folder, you are in for<br />
a shock." Well, nobody resists that sort of come-on; so I did<br />
open it. And what do I find?<br />
A splendid likeness and the words " Keynote E. G. Whitlam,<br />
Prime Minister of Australia."<br />
And indeed, it is not made quite clear in your promotion<br />
whether the Seminar is to discuss future shock according to<br />
Professor Toffler or under the Whitlam Government.<br />
I know that my colleagues and I have, from time to time,<br />
been reported as saying or doing things which may have surprised<br />
you or even shocked you. I think it was inevitable, after 23<br />
years, that this would be so; and, of course we Labor men crude,<br />
rough, unpolished as we are do not have that finesse and elegance<br />
and suavity that you natural~ ly came to expect from our predecessors,<br />
the men born to rule. So you will have to bear with us if at times<br />
we seem to fall short of those sophisticated standards of former<br />
days. You will pardon me, however, if I say that I find it just<br />
a little frustrating to discover that plain speaking from an<br />
Australian Prime Minister is so often resented. Is there a<br />
country in the world where straightforward statements are so<br />
often regarded as arrogant or indiscreet or even, as I find in<br />
the Age this week, egocentric? I would have thought it just a<br />
matter of stating the truth when asked. Indeed, I think our<br />
problem in Australia is not so much one of future shock, but<br />
recovering from past bromides.<br />
So I do see it as part of my duties to administer from<br />
time to time a little shock treatment; of course I shall be<br />
careful to see it doesn't become aversion therapy.<br />
Today, however, I am going to do the responsible, the<br />
discreet, the Prime Ministerial thing: I am going to give<br />
reassurance; and I give it on three counts.<br />
I see Professor Toffler outlines his thesis in these<br />
words: </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" When diversity converges with transience and<br />
novelty, we rocket the society towards an<br />
historical crisis of adaptation. We create an<br />
environment so ephemeral, unfamiliar and complex<br />
as to threaten millions with adaptive breakdown.<br />
This breakdown is future shock."<br />
I suppose some of you might think that that is a description<br />
of the Australian Government. I concede the " diversity" and the<br />
" novelty". I concede that some people in Australia some of<br />
them not a million miles from the Opposition benches are being<br />
" rocketed into a crisis of adaptation" and I concede the " unfamiliar"<br />
and the " complex" aspects of our Government. You will not be so<br />
very surprised if I do not concede " transience" or " ephemerality".<br />
And quite seriously, it is folly for business or for any section<br />
of our Australian community, or for that matter, anybody abroad,<br />
to regard the decision of the people on 2 December as some sort<br />
of aberration, a temporary departure from the normalcy of stodgy<br />
conservatism. To do so is to ignore some of the very great and<br />
deep forces which have been at work in our society, not just for<br />
the last six months, not just for the six weeks or the six months<br />
before the elections, but for years and years.<br />
The collapse of the Liberal Australian Government was<br />
fundamentally a result of its failure over a very long period,<br />
to respond to, or even to perceive, those changes at work.<br />
The result of 2 December was not merely a change in Government,<br />
but a real change in the direction of will and purpose in the<br />
Australian community. Whatever the electoral fortunes of the<br />
Labor Government may be, there is nothing transient, nothng<br />
ephemeral in the forces which brought it to power. This is<br />
something we all have to live with. A wise businessman, a prudent<br />
investor, a competent manager, will recognise this as a fact of<br />
life for many years to come and will plan accordingly. Paradoxically,<br />
the forces and pressure for change will be the most stable, certain<br />
element in Australian political and economic life in the foreseeable<br />
future. I hope you are stably reassured.<br />
Secondly, I want to reassure you that ours is a highly<br />
predictable Government. I confess it makes me quite impatient<br />
when I hear that business is uneasy or uncertain about our<br />
intentions. I venture to say, in all seriousness, that no<br />
administration in modern democratic history has entered office<br />
with its intentions so precisely and specifically spelt out<br />
and spelt out over so long a period. Let me illustrate: When I<br />
had to conduct campaigns as Leader of the Opposition, in 1967,<br />
Senate, in 1969, House of Representatives, in 1970, Senate,<br />
and in 1972, House of Representativest I gave short shrift to<br />
candidates or campaign officials or even advertising agencies<br />
who complained that they did not know the policy until the night<br />
of the policy speech. It was all there well before. It was in<br />
the platform of the party. The priorities to be given to the<br />
platform and the fleshing out of the bare bones of the platform<br />
were contained in speech after speech my principal colleagues<br />
and I had made in Parliament and around this country for months<br />
and years before any of those elections* In the whole of that<br />
period when I led the Opposition it was well known who were the<br />
men who would hold the chief ministries. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Any competent person could have written the essentials of the<br />
1972 program upon which we were elected anybody who had read<br />
what we had been saying for the last six years; and anybody who<br />
can read that policy speech knows what this Government has been<br />
about, throughout the last six months. If anyone has been<br />
surprised, I can only take it that there is still an element<br />
of surprise in the fact that an elected Government will actually<br />
do what it said it would do.<br />
We shall continue until the next elections, the steady,<br />
progressive implementation of that program; after the next<br />
elections, we shall proceed with the same deliberate speed<br />
to implement the program for which we shall seek a mandate at<br />
those elections. But in the broad and in the detail of those<br />
160 specific undertakings which were deemed to be so excessive<br />
and extravagant at the time if you want to know what the<br />
Government is doing and what it will do read the policy speech.<br />
It is true, we have just begun the process of framing<br />
the Budget and there must necessarily be an area of doubt about<br />
the provisions of this Budget as with any Budget. Has there<br />
ever been a time when this has not been so? Speculation upon<br />
the Budget surely did not begin with the election of a Labor<br />
Government! It is in the nature of the system whereby the annual<br />
Budget is regarded as the Goenmn' key economic and social<br />
document. We are moving to change that. The Treasurer and I have<br />
long put the view that the system of annual budgets worked against<br />
effective long term planning and efficient short term economic<br />
manipulation. The Budget has to bear an impossible burden if it<br />
is made to perform a myriad of functions including the setting<br />
out of national econo'mic and social goals. Accordingly, very<br />
soon after achieving office, we decided to quicken the development<br />
of a fully pledged program of forward estimates of Australian<br />
expenditures. This decision is designed to affect significantly<br />
in the future, the efficient allocation of resoures in the public<br />
sector, The preparation of the forward estimates will mean that<br />
the implications of Government programs can be examined over a<br />
much longer time-span than the traditbnal annual budgetary period<br />
permitted in the past. Further, we haveestablished a committee<br />
of ministers to examine and analyse the information ofl expenditure<br />
trends revealed in the estimates. The work of this committee<br />
will considerably enhance our ability to guide expenditures towards<br />
the areas of highest priority and will assist the Government in<br />
more clearly defining our objectives and national goals. We shall<br />
have a better idea of what we are about; so will everybody.<br />
Nevertheless, we have a Budget to produce in August.<br />
This week we have had some of the traditional pre-Budget talks<br />
with industry. Whatever the Budget contains and it appears<br />
that even the most rudimentary reference or common sense statement<br />
by any of my ministers about the inevitable difficulties in<br />
framing Labor's first Budget for 24 years will be deemed to indicate<br />
a split or a crisis the Budget will be a fundamental financial<br />
expression of the goals we set out in our program last year for<br />
the elections. The Budget is not the be-all and end-all of that<br />
program; it is a crucial element in achieving it. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
It is true that the economy is in a very different phase<br />
from that existing at the time of the elections. The pattern<br />
of the Budget must be determined in the light of the state of<br />
the economy at the time of its preparation and must be based on<br />
reasonable expectations of the way in which the economy will develop.<br />
The remarkable fact about the present economic situation<br />
is the dramatic and healthy change which has taken place in it<br />
over the last six months. In the months before the election even<br />
the previous Government was so concerned about the continued<br />
slackness in the economy that it introduced special expansionist<br />
measures despite the fact that its own budget had only just been<br />
approved by Parliament. As late as December an independent professional<br />
economic institute within the University of Melbourne was<br />
reporting that the economy was still operating substantially below<br />
capacity and seemed likely to continue to do so for months ahead.<br />
There can be no doubt that the major task of economic<br />
management facing the Government and the community generally is<br />
to restrain the rising pressure of expenditure on resources and<br />
to prevent inflationary rises in prices and in costs.<br />
The task which faces the Cabinet is to produce a Budget<br />
which will finance the Government's own essential programs and<br />
also provide for the necessary restraint on rising levels of<br />
private as well as public expenditure. The Government accepts<br />
this responsibility and will come to the task of its preparation<br />
ready to consider any form of fiscal action likely to contribute<br />
to an effective performance of the task. But the great thrust<br />
of the Budget must be to implement our clearly stated program<br />
and goals. So the second reassurance I give you is about the basic<br />
predictability of this Government.<br />
The third reassurance I give you is that we fully<br />
recognise the interdependence of a Labor Government and private<br />
business. I acknowledgedin my policy speech that we could not<br />
expect that our social program could be financed without a<br />
significantly increased growth rate. Australia had been stumbling<br />
along with a paltry growth rate of 3 per cent or so. I said<br />
then that we would need to achieve a growth rate of 6 to 7 per<br />
cent if our program were to be implemented without vastly increased<br />
taxation. We shall probably achieve a rate higher than 7 per cent<br />
this year. We can only achieve such a rate if all sectors of the<br />
community, not least the private sector, is prosperous, efficient<br />
and fully employed. You need a prosperous economy. So does<br />
the Government. I know very well I cannot achieve a moiety of<br />
what I want to achieve for the people of this country decent<br />
schools, decent hospitals, decent cities, decent provision for<br />
the sick, the aged and the handicapped without your prosperity<br />
if you like, without your taxes. </p>
<p>I said in the policy speech and the Governor-General<br />
himself was gracious enough to repeat it in the speech from<br />
the throne that We would establish consultative planning<br />
machinery by which all sectors of industry, employers and<br />
employees, would co-operate with us in the planning of the<br />
economy and the promotion of the great goals of our society.<br />
We shall faithfully abide by that undertaking. I understand<br />
there are complaints in the business community about difficulties<br />
in communication with the new ministers. I acknowledge things<br />
have changed a little since December. No longer the midnight<br />
telephone call from the influential address in Canberra or<br />
even more influential address at Surfers Paradise. ( The Postmaster-<br />
General is distinctly irked at the loss in his revenues.<br />
Frank Crean is delighted at the savings. You see the difficulty<br />
I have in getting unity in my Cabinet.) I know that over the<br />
years, certain convenient and immediate lines of communication<br />
did develop between leaders of industry and leading ministers.<br />
I understand and I don't quibble at it, but you cannot really<br />
be surprised that there has been some slight change. Let. me,<br />
however, put this to you: were you really on such a good thing?<br />
Did this allegedly comfortable relationship ever really help<br />
you in the long term planning of your industry or your company?<br />
Is it not a fact that, towards the end, our predecessors had<br />
such a lack of any coherent or comprehensive policy that aJll<br />
the consultation, all the private dinners and all the telephone<br />
calls, left you none the wiser and certainly none -the richer?<br />
Ido want communication with industry. I want it and<br />
so do my ministers, every bit as much with private industry<br />
as with the trade union movement. We want it on an open, regular,<br />
constructive and in significant areas, institutionalised<br />
basis. It is in this context that I wish to speak to you about<br />
some of the basic structural reforms which we have implemented<br />
or are about to create. Fundamental to the future of the<br />
Australian economy is the question of national industrial policy.<br />
This is not simply a matter of deciding that it is desirable<br />
to have economic growth or economic development. It is worth<br />
emphasising that the two are not necessarily the same. We know<br />
it well in Australia. During the last generation we have<br />
experienced a remarkable phase of economic development, yet it<br />
has not been accompanied by a particularly creditable economic<br />
growth. So when I speak of industrial policy, I am referring<br />
to the problems of the relative rates of growth of all industry<br />
primary, secondary and tertiary industry and to the various<br />
industries within those sectors.<br />
The disparity between our rate of development and our<br />
rate of growth makes it quite clear that very serious distortions<br />
in the productive capacity of Australian industry have arisen and<br />
it is equally clear that the tariff system is centrally relevant<br />
to this distortion. You know that quite early in the life of the<br />
Government we asked Sir John Crawford to report on the establishment<br />
of a Commission to replace the Tariff Board. His report is now<br />
at hand this week. I should now say that he suggests a name<br />
other than that of the " Protection Commission" which was the<br />
term used in the policy speech and the Governor-General's speech. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
The M. T. I. A's own submission for which I thank and compliment<br />
you suggested a similar change. If I refer here to the<br />
Protection Commission, you will understand that it is without<br />
prejudice to any decision of Cabinet on Sir John Crawford's<br />
recommendation. The essential elements of my request to Sir<br />
John were to make recommendations on a Commission which would be<br />
able to conduct examinations independent of the pressures of day<br />
to day politics and, above all, open to public scrutiny.<br />
This kind of approach has, of course, typified the<br />
work of the Tariff Board in recent years. Subject to the<br />
limitations of staff and the restrictions of policy imposed<br />
upon it by the form of some of the references to it, the Tariff<br />
Board has had to deal with many of the problems of an industrial<br />
policy. Unfortunately, it has suffered from two major inadequacies;<br />
and it is these inadequacies that we hope the Protection Commission<br />
will overcome. The first of them has been the limitation of scope.<br />
We believe it is essential that any decision, whether of<br />
commission or omission, should take full notice of its<br />
implications for employment and existing investments, and that<br />
when major adjustment is necessary as a consequence of such<br />
decisions, the employment and other adjustments involved in<br />
other words, the reallocation of labour and capital should<br />
take place in such a way as to avoid the traumas and hardships<br />
which structural adjustments have involved in the past,<br />
The second major limitation of the Tariff Board has been<br />
the blinkers which have been foisted upon it in the past. With<br />
few exceptions, only the problems of manufacturing industry have<br />
been referred to the Board. We intend to change that and have<br />
levels of protection of both agriculture and secondary industry<br />
decided by the same body. Again non-tariff forms of assistance<br />
have been generally decided in widely different ways ways<br />
which often have been unco-ordinated and at variance with one<br />
another. We have set up with a Secretariat in my Department<br />
a standing inter-departmental committee responsible for<br />
advising on all assistance to industries. This will make for<br />
more coherent and consistent decision making.<br />
Again, one might point out that never has the Tariff<br />
Board, or any other independent statutory authority, been asked<br />
to report upon the prospects for a new industry or the question<br />
of which of Australia's existing or embryonic industries offer<br />
prospects of viability without assistance of an open-ended kind<br />
from the taxpayer. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
In this context, it might be worth emphasising that<br />
in pointing out this deficiency I am not proposing that any<br />
body or any Governmental authority in Australia should set<br />
itself up to select which industries should be allowed to exist<br />
and which should be put out of business.<br />
But it is the responsibility of the Government to decide<br />
what is the national advantage in terms of particular industries,<br />
when any kind of official patronage, that is, the taxpayers'<br />
money is involved.<br />
Now there are some implications of this that I am sure<br />
will be music to your ears. I know how dedicated you all are,<br />
how determined you all are, to uphold the principle of free<br />
enterprise and open competition. I know how much you will<br />
welcome every decision which will promote competition. The<br />
Protection Commission should help to this end.<br />
In expanding and building upon the role of the Tariff<br />
Board through the new Commission, whatever the final form of<br />
it may be, the Government intends to lay the basis for an<br />
industrial policy for Australia, in which the emphasis will be<br />
upon change and dynamic adjustment.<br />
It is not a pretty sight in a country like Australia,<br />
so rich in natural resources and with such a potentiality for<br />
growth, to see the instant ossification which sets in in so<br />
many enterprises and indeed whole industries. As soon as an<br />
industry has come into existence, too often it considers that<br />
its very existence entitles it to a certificate of immortality<br />
and changelessness, to be guaranteed a safe and easy life by<br />
way of Government subsidy and protection through tariffs or,<br />
even worse, permanent quantitive controls on imports.<br />
When the Great Depression struck the world, the retreat<br />
behind tariff barriers on a worldwide scale was understandable,<br />
even if not always wise. Jobs and livelihoods for millions of<br />
people were at stake, and the threat of economic warfare by<br />
dumping led to the practice of economic warfare by tariffs.<br />
Nevertheless, it cannot be repeated too often that at<br />
a time of full employment and labour shortages, as will be the<br />
case soon, no serious threat to jobs is involved in prodding<br />
industry into greater resilience and adaptability to change by<br />
exposing it to a more competitive climate. It becomes for<br />
Government much more a social problem than an employment problem.<br />
When in some cases, in the interests of economic growth,<br />
it becomes necessary to encourage job changes, the duty of the<br />
Government is to act on the side of the change, not resist it,<br />
and to facilitate the transfer of employees into expanding<br />
industries and out of uneconomic and contracting industries. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
The Government is studying the problems of adjustment<br />
assistance for structural change, in its industrial, manpower<br />
retraining and social security aspects. We shall never allow<br />
change to be bought at the cost of human hardship. Neither shall<br />
we build unnecessary rigidities into the Australian economy<br />
merely in order to enable people, whether they be employers or<br />
employees, to continue in a particular industry just because<br />
they are used to it and don't want to learn anything new. This<br />
can only lead to stagnation and the sacrifice of economic growth,<br />
not in the name of something rational like preservation of the<br />
environment but in the name of sluggishness and conservatism.<br />
Australia should be able to pride herself upon a vigorous<br />
and independent approach to her role in the international economic<br />
community. She will be able to do so only if we develop an<br />
industrial policy which is directed towards adaptation, and strive<br />
to overcome the inbuilt resistance of vested interests to any<br />
structural changes in the domestic economy.<br />
Like most countries of the world today, Australia has<br />
encountered serious inflationary problems. There can be no doubt<br />
that inflation is a disruptive influence on the economy and<br />
society, and it is in the interests of all that it should be<br />
held in check. If prices continue to rise sharply in the erratic<br />
and unpredictable ways that have characterised recent experience,<br />
no-one in Government, in business, or in private life can plan<br />
confidently for the future. This problem has led to extreme<br />
measures being taken in some countries, in particdlar the United<br />
Kingdom and the United States.<br />
The Australian Government is determined to contain<br />
inflationary pressures. It will not be easy. We are aware<br />
of the need to manage economic affairs prudently to avoid too<br />
great a strain on Australia's resources. We intend to do so<br />
with the co-operation of business and the public at large.<br />
For this reason, we have established a Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal which will have the task of enquiring into and reporting<br />
upon the prices charged and any price rises proposed by large<br />
companies. Its reports will state whether, in the opinion of<br />
the Tribunal, this or that price or price rise is justified.<br />
We confidently expect that the companies concerned will abide<br />
by the Tribunal's judgements in these matters and, as the Tribunal<br />
will provide a forum for discussion of these matters in public<br />
hearings, we believe that its operations will have the force of<br />
public opinion behind them. It is therefore of the utmost<br />
importance that business should recognise its own best interests<br />
and the best interests of Australia in co-operating with the<br />
Tribunal in all respects.<br />
Further, we are determined to step up the long term<br />
growth of productivity in Australia by a variety of measures. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
First, we intend to stimulate both internal and external<br />
competition and at the same time to improve the competitiveness<br />
of Australian industry. Existing Australian legislation in the<br />
restrictive trade practices field is of limited effectiveness.<br />
Even our predecessois recognised that. We propose to deal with<br />
restrictive trade practices by directly prohibiting them instead<br />
of leaving them to be restrained separately after time-consuming<br />
enquiries, as is the case with most practices at present.<br />
The Government has done a great deal of preparatory<br />
work in formulating new and stronger legislation along these<br />
lines. I do not see stronger restrictive trade practices<br />
legislation as something for industry to fear. Obviously,<br />
there will be adjustments to be made. But as the influence<br />
of this legislation spreads we can expect a sharper, more<br />
competitive spirit to emerge in the economy, with industry<br />
quicker to respond to changes in the market and in the available<br />
techniques of production and distribution, and quicker to respond<br />
to new opportunities in general. This must be to the benefit<br />
of everyone. Secondly, we hope to move towards more outward looking<br />
trade and development strategies adopted by such other small<br />
rich industrial economies as Sweden, Denmark and Norway, economies<br />
which have increased the real average living standards of<br />
their population considerably faster than we have, and at the<br />
same time, looked after their sick and poor much better than we<br />
have. There is need to recognise that increasingly our<br />
manufacturing industries should become more oriented to<br />
international markets. However, no wholesale upheaval of the<br />
Australian industrial structure will result from our policies.<br />
Rather any alterations to existing policies, or the introduction<br />
of new ones, will be gradual. The Government is aware that its<br />
policies will involve some changes ofemphasis and of direction.<br />
It recognises the need to ease the transition by providing as<br />
much notice to industry as possible to plan for changes of<br />
direction and where possible to give industry time to adjust<br />
to new circumstances. Thirdly, we aim to increase the adaptability of the<br />
Australian economy to changing technology and to changing<br />
economic conditions both at home and abroad. Action has<br />
already been set in train by the ministers for Secondary Industry,<br />
Labour and Social Security and to develop a comprehensive and<br />
co-ordinated set of policy measures on<br />
Labour training and re-training;<br />
Relocation of industries and workforces;<br />
Adjustment assistance to industries affected;<br />
Effective social security and welfare measures to<br />
protect individuals and their families involved. </p>
<p>Currently a high level governmental mission is overseas<br />
studying relevant experience in other countries. Such a program<br />
will enable the Government, in co-operation with industry and<br />
the trade unions, to accelerate the movement towards a more<br />
viable and profitable industrial structure.<br />
The long term structural changes which need to be made<br />
to achieve a lift in the real income growth of the community<br />
may require Government assistance in many areas to ensure that<br />
the associated human and economic problems of change are at<br />
least minimised and, where possible, avoided.<br />
Finally, it is particularly appropriate that I should<br />
mention at a seminar under the auspices of the the<br />
question of industrial relations. The great breakthrough<br />
towards industrial sanity in Australia came when the M. T. I. A.<br />
recognised that the prosperity of both employers and employees<br />
rested upon industrial co-operation, not industrial confrontation.<br />
Your members know full well the futility of the provocation of<br />
the penal clauses. Your members will know the advantages to<br />
yourselves of union amalgamation. You must find it as ludicrous as<br />
I do that a majority in the Senate should seek to thwart our<br />
mandate on two such matters one of them, at least, " inoperative"<br />
if no-one finds it offensive or interfering for me to use that<br />
word. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to commend the efforts<br />
your Association has made in recent years to bring about a better<br />
industrial climate by replacing the idea of confrontation in<br />
industrial relations with co-operation. In future years, I<br />
believe that the writers on industrial relations will regard the<br />
1971 metal trades negotiations and agreement as a major initiative<br />
in the development of a more satisfactory system of industrial<br />
relations. I congratulate the M. T. I. A. on the initiatives it took<br />
to reach agreement with the metal trades unions for an agreement<br />
covering this important industry, an example of bargaining with<br />
the assistance of the Commission without any industrial stoppages.<br />
I believe that this will be regarded as an outstanding<br />
example of the way industrial relations in Australia can and should<br />
be conducted. In all these matters in economic management, in tariff<br />
policy, in industrial relations, in social engineering we are<br />
seeking new machinery, better structures, mom public processes,<br />
to achieve our program for change. </p>
<p>-11<br />
Returning to the brochure promoting this seminar,<br />
reference is made to the " sickness that comes from too much<br />
change in too short a time". I cannot accept the proposition<br />
that it is the change which causes the sickness. It is the<br />
failure to prepare for change and to plan for change. Change<br />
itself is inevitable. I do not fear it. Where we have failed<br />
so often in the past is in failing to anticipate it, and failing<br />
to develop modern and contemporary institutions to deal with it.<br />
It is the duty of a Government devoted to change in an era of<br />
change to develop those structures and institutions. This is<br />
what we are doing. We know our creations can only be truly<br />
effective if they are based on co-operation and open dealings<br />
with the public. Co-operation, open dealing, contemporary<br />
institutions for planning and achieving clearly stated national<br />
goals those, I believe, are the best antidotes against future<br />
shock. </p>
