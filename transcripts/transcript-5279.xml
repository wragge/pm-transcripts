PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, 28 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING SPEECH TO MELBOURNE<br />
STOCK EXCHANGE INVESTMENT SEMINAR<br />
ME LBOURNE<br />
Ques tion.<br />
Mr. Fraser, what initiatives are you prepared to take to<br />
reach a bi-partisan approach over the Afghanistan situation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, it ought to be very easy, because the Labor Party has<br />
condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, as we have,<br />
and at the same time Mr. Hayden has said on many occasions<br />
that an effective boycott of the Olympic Games would be the best<br />
means, the best means by far, of getting the message through to<br />
the Russian Government and the Russian people. But then he has<br />
gone on and yesterday rather he said that if the Games are<br />
held in Moscow Australians would be there, but if there was<br />
an effective boycott he would support it. Now, there would be<br />
a bi-partisan approach to Afghanistan if he would back his<br />
statements, which I believe, that an effective boycott of the<br />
Games would get the message through to the Soviet Government<br />
and people better than any other mechanism that we have.<br />
If he will work for that, then we will have bi-partisan foreign<br />
policy. There is nothing else that I wanted to say on that.<br />
There has been too much debate about it already in the Parliament<br />
and you will know what I said today. But I do want to make a<br />
comment about another major development project that has been<br />
announced during the course of today.<br />
I think you know that the Rundle partners are now negotiating<br />
with Exon to firm up developments and programmes for the<br />
development of the Rundle shale oil deposits. It is a very major<br />
advance and of course it would be tle first of a series of shale<br />
oil developments in Australia. Rundle is just one of a large<br />
number of deposits. As oil from Rundle ultimately comes on stream<br />
sometime in the future I would believe around about the time<br />
Bass Strait starts to run down we will maintain a degree ofself-<br />
sufficiency which will be of vast importance to Australia<br />
as we aqpproach the year 2000. In addition to that of course,<br />
it needs to be noted that Rundle would not have occurred if<br />
we had just had cheap petrol in Australia. It is the market<br />
price for petrol at world parity that makes this kind of giant<br />
enterprise viable, profitable and possible. It is a very<br />
practical and positive result, therefore, from the Government's<br />
energy policies. 0 00---</p>
