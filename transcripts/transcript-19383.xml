    <content><![CDATA[<p>Geelong</p>
<p>The Gillard and Victorian Governments announced today that the head office of DisabilityCare Australia will be located in Geelong.</p>
<p>This will create around 300 new jobs once DisabilityCare is fully rolled out from 2019-20.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the 120 jobs already announced for the Agency's Geelong regional office, which will open in time for the launch of DisabilityCare Australia in the Barwon region next month.</p>
<p>The DisabilityCare head office will include staff responsible for managing the scheme's operation, such as national operations management, the CEO and executive support and corporate services.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has made this decision on the location of the head office on the basis of the Victorian Government's offer of $25 million toward the costs of relocation and establishment for the head office.</p>
<p>The Victorian Government has also agreed to fund works to significantly improve the accessibility of the Geelong train station.</p>
<p>As part of the agreements reached with the states and territories, the Commonwealth is meeting costs of the administration of DisabilityCare Australia, including establishing a network of regional DisabilityCare offices around Australia.</p>
<p>Basing DisabilityCare Australia's head office in Geelong will help attract investment, create jobs and meet community needs in and around Geelong.</p>
<p>Geelong is ideally suited to support the head office functions of such an important agency. The city has a history of driving innovation in disability, health and community services through the collaboration of its local council, local health services and locally-based disability service agencies.</p>
<p>DisabilityCare Australia will also benefit from being located in the same city as the Victorian Transport Accident Commission, which delivers Victoria's no fault transport accident lifetime care and support scheme.</p>
<p>DisabilityCare Australia will immediately start investigating location options, with a view to placing some staff in Geelong from January 2014.</p>
<p>DisabilityCare is also establishing regional offices in locations around Australia, starting with launch locations. This will enable people with disability, their families and carers can access local support from local staff.</p>
<p>This year, DisabilityCare Australia, the national disability insurance scheme, will become a reality for thousands of Australians with disability, their families and carers.</p>
<p>Once the scheme is fully rolled out, DisabilityCare Australia will provide support for around 460,000 people who have a significant and permanent disability that affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.</p>
