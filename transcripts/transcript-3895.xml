QUESTIONS. FROM TH. E. HOBART PRESS. CLUB LUNCHEON<br />
22 SEPTEMBER 1975<br />
Bowers Mr Fraser's been maindenishly coy about whether or not<br />
he intended to catch you with your trousers down as he<br />
so charmingly put it. Can you say with precision what<br />
you'd do if the Opposition blocks Supply in the<br />
Senate next month?<br />
P. M. Well, there are various options and I wouldn't at this<br />
stage specify which one I at this stage find most<br />
attractive. But all I need to say is it's been<br />
assumed that if an Upper House rejects a Budget or<br />
refuses Supply, the head of the-Government -which of<br />
course has a majority in the Lower House -must then<br />
ask the Governor-General to dissolve the Lower House.<br />
p There is no law which says that; there is no precedent<br />
for it happening, and because nobody ever thought it<br />
could ha~ pen, there has been no discussion about it.<br />
There is no convention about it. Now one of the things<br />
which one bears in mind is that the Senate now is<br />
considerably different from the Senate which was<br />
elected in May last year. I would recall that in May<br />
last year at the Double Dissolution which I advised the<br />
Governor-General at that time to grant because the two<br />
Houses were unworiable there was a threat of refusal<br />
of Supply but in fact there had been no refusal of Supply;<br />
there was the situation where they could be a Double<br />
Dissolution I advised the Governor-General to dissolve<br />
both Houses and he did. And in the election for the House<br />
of Representatives which was supposed to be elected for<br />
three years nobody ever disputed that at the time; the<br />
then Liberal Leader never suggested that the House of<br />
Representatives being elected should not be elected for<br />
three years at that time the candidates of my Party<br />
got a very considerable majority of votes for the House<br />
of Representatives and also of course a comfortable majority<br />
of seats in the House of Representatives and the candidates for the<br />
Senate got more votes than the candidates of all other<br />
Parties contesting the Senate, including one Party which<br />
is no longer there.<br />
Since then there have been two Labor vacancies and<br />
in an utterly unprecedented and, I believe, unprincipled<br />
move, the Premiers of New South Wales and now Queensland<br />
have substituted non-Labor people for the former Labor<br />
Senators. It is possible, it's easier, therefore, for an<br />
Opposition to get half the votes which is all you need;<br />
you don't need a majority to reject these things: the Bill's<br />
not passed unless it gets a majority so it is possible<br />
maybe in these circumstances. But of course it's really for<br />
Dir Fraser to make up his mind on this; he always says<br />
himself that he thinks it's improper to do it; but he<br />
tolerates a degree of speculation which is very unsettling<br />
for business and administration and some people think it's<br />
unsettling for the Government. Well my withers are unwrung ./ 2 </p>
<p>on this business. We've been through it before and on this<br />
matter we wouldn't be caught with our pants down or one leg in<br />
and one leg out.<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, I'm sure that we're very thankful to your<br />
government for the assistance towards the restoration of<br />
the Bridge: at least our grandchildren are, anyway. I<br />
noticed that you said that you were under no obligation to<br />
do anything towards that Bridge. Would you not agree that<br />
if one of your ships has knockea the bridge down you are<br />
morally, if not legally, bound to restore the Bridge.<br />
P. M. Well my views on what happened about the vessel concerned<br />
are well known. But legally you would be liable for whatever<br />
you can prove against the ship. And the law in this respect<br />
is quite vague. But I would concede that the owner of the<br />
ship and that happens to be, the Australian Government:<br />
Tasmania would be in a pretty poor position but for Australian<br />
Government ships that it should make the contribution.<br />
But there's no legal or moral obligation for us to provide<br />
a fifth lane. There is no legal or moral obligation for us<br />
to provide another bridge, four lane, Dowsings Point.<br />
S Whatever may be the legal or moral obligation there could<br />
be no doubt that the Australian Government has been generous<br />
and not just I don't know about your grandchildren I would<br />
have thought you look admirably hale and hearty and you will<br />
see it in very few years. But the transport across the<br />
Derwent will be very much better than it has ever been<br />
before. The City of Hobart will be very much better planned<br />
and very much better equipped and serviced as a result of<br />
my government's response and its initiatives and the tumbling<br />
of the Bridge has had a golden lining and the taxpayers of<br />
all Australia,.-thanks to the initiative of my Government,<br />
are providing the lining.<br />
QUESTION You mentioned the Antarctic research base being shifted to<br />
Hobart. How soon are we likely to see it shifted to Hobart?<br />
LP0O I wouldn't-. lay down a timetable in these matters because<br />
neither Bridges nor scientific establishments are done in the<br />
course of any one financial year. But there is that commitment.<br />
And if you don't mind me making the political point too, it<br />
will be noticed that our opponents' Shadow Minister or<br />
spokesman for Science, objected to it leaving Melbourne.<br />
Now whatever you do even some of the things I have said<br />
about your ports will prod * uce adverse comments elsewhere.<br />
Now my Government has made the decision that the Australian<br />
Antarctic activities will be centred in Hobart. We think<br />
there are very good reasons for doing it, for making that<br />
commitment. I don't know how soon they'll come about;<br />
there are of course buildings to be designed, there's also<br />
certain notice which we aren't compelled to give, but which<br />
we as a matter of factus do give to Government employees<br />
concerning their movements because they have families and<br />
of course they have to make arrangements for education and<br />
accommodation and that sort of thing. But the commitment<br />
has been made. / 3 </p>
<p>QUESTION P. M.<br />
QUE STI ON<br />
P. M.<br />
QUE ST ION During the Bass By-election campaign you mentioned that funds<br />
were specifically being allocated for the Launceston Eastern<br />
by-pass road. There seems a certain amount of uncertainty<br />
amongst the State Labor Government whether these funds have<br />
actually been allocated or whether they will be allocated.<br />
Could you clarify this matter?<br />
I've been asked this in Parliament quite recently, too, and<br />
I said then, as I said during the by-election campaign, that<br />
during the next triennium for which the funds are being<br />
discussed by the Australian and all the State transport<br />
Ministers this was announced, you know, that there would be<br />
these triennial arrangements made when the legislation was<br />
introduced in about September last year, I think. In those<br />
discussions the arrangements will be made. As I said before,<br />
the Australian Government, the Australian Parliament has<br />
always had the responsibility before my Government had<br />
ever exercised it to make roads to promote trade and<br />
commerce with other countries and among the States and in<br />
pursuance to that arrangement we have decided to finance<br />
the road, the national highway, between Hobart to the outskirts<br />
of Launceston over the Burnie and similarly from the<br />
outskirts of Launceston up to Bell Bay. And the by-pass<br />
you mentioned is to connect the national road and the export<br />
roads concerned and that will be discussed I think it has<br />
already been discussed in the context of the next triennium,<br />
that is, the next program of allocations which the Australian<br />
Government will finance directly itself and by grants to the<br />
States.<br />
One very general question on the Harradine affair, if I could.<br />
No you can't.<br />
I'm just wondering if you will answer the question, do you<br />
think the A. L. P. has overreacted, was a bit oversensitive<br />
to Mr Harradine's comments in the past?<br />
No. I/ rn not answering the question.<br />
* STION Ycorui tmiecnitsimo niend otah elri ttpllea cewsh ilfeo r agsoo met haotf tyhoeu tehxipnegcst edy ous o'myee<br />
said today, particularly your reference to the ports.<br />
Reading the speech it appears that we have arrived at a<br />
situation where by the take-, over of the railways in Tasmania<br />
you set Tasmania's port system's future quite considerably<br />
in advance of the report of the Nimmo Commission which you<br />
expect to get. In fact has Mr Nimmo now been wasting his<br />
time because it looks as if you have decided in advance<br />
that there will be one major port and in fact you have lined<br />
it up with the railways? </p>
<p>P. M. Well, of course, Mr Nimrno is not wasting his time. Mr Nimmo<br />
is securing information and seeking information which has<br />
never been collected or sought before. The Australian Government<br />
and the Tasmanian Government will be very much better informed<br />
as a result of Mr Nimmo's report than they could otherwise<br />
have been. If we'd had the Interstate Commission over all these<br />
years that information would have been available to people.<br />
As it is the Tasmanian Government, I think ' it was the previous<br />
one, the Bingham one, got the report from the Pak Poy people<br />
and of course, we have had to get the information from the<br />
ANL. And the advice that both have given is that there needs<br />
to be some port which can take a bulk ship, and there isn't<br />
in Tasmania at the moment. There are probably more ports<br />
per head of population in Tasmania than in any other State<br />
but I hope I don't give any impression that I am preempting Mr<br />
Nimmo's report; I don't know what' he will advise in this<br />
respect and if, of course, he advised something else I would<br />
probably heed what he said rather than what I've ventured to say<br />
at the moment. But there is a suitably sited port at Bell Bay,<br />
there is industry at Bell Bay and there has been by agreement<br />
with Tasmanian Governments successive governments and it<br />
couldn't have been done without their consent there has<br />
been a largely Australian Government-financed railway up to<br />
Bell Bay. That's been completed, it's the best track in the<br />
State. Some people say it's the only really good track in the<br />
State. Now in those circumstances it does seem reasonable<br />
to bring together tije road, , the rail the export road I<br />
was describing the new rail and bulk port facilities at<br />
Bell Bay. But the port facilities are not primarily a federal'<br />
responsibility. It may be that an Australian Government could<br />
build a port or wharves, because obviously a port one way or<br />
anot~ her relates to trade and commerce with other countries<br />
and among the States. But there has been no arrangement to<br />
this stage about that port. But we're obviously committed<br />
to the road, we have been overwhelmingly committed to the railway<br />
and we do need a new ship for the wheat trade for Tasmania.<br />
So we ought, in the next few months be able to make some plans<br />
for that purpose, but I want to discount immediately the<br />
suggestion that comes from the Mercury that chap looked<br />
more like Jupiter than Mercury that Mr Nimmo is wasting<br />
his time. He's doing a job that ought to have been done years ago. </p>
<p>QAKES Prime Minister, a question on the controversial and crucial<br />
issue of metric pronunciation. I noticed in your speech<br />
you referred again to kilometres.<br />
P. M. Of course.<br />
QA. KES Can I ask you are you not inclined to accept the advice of<br />
your minister for Science that the word should be pronounced<br />
kilometres, and in view of this serious disagreement, do you<br />
think a Cabinet and Caucus decision is required?<br />
P. M. Well, as a matter of fact, I was drafting a response to him<br />
this morning during some of the lulls. I've always said<br />
myself kilometre or centimetre or millimetre or those sort<br />
of things and I don't want to pre-empt the letter which<br />
I'm sending to the Minister fo; Science whose qualifications<br />
of course were of my ordaining: I gave him his scientific<br />
qualifications. But since this is, of course, a very serious<br />
enquiry, I would point out that all scientific terms are<br />
Vaccented in that way. You have thermometers and barometers<br />
and altimeters and spectrophotometers and for those people<br />
that can go the distance required, speedometers or for<br />
earth-bound people you have pedometers and the versifiers among<br />
you have always used pentameters and tetrameters. And<br />
you've got a pretty fair diameter and perimeter yourself.<br />
I believe that Mr Cameron has been influenced by his<br />
departmental advisers and they thought they were being<br />
very gallic. Ever since these urban guerillas in Paris<br />
190 years ago brought in the metric system, they thought<br />
it would sound nicer if you said kilometre or kilometre.<br />
But the migrants who come to Australia usually put it<br />
back where we would orginarily put it, that is the Italians<br />
all say kilometre; the Spaniards, the people from Timor,<br />
all say kilometre. It's easier to say kilometre. I mean<br />
the technical ones among you, the people from the Mercury<br />
would know ABC too possibly, the older ones that you<br />
only put the accent on the second last syllable if it's<br />
a long syllable and the words ending in metre all come from<br />
a Greek word where there's a short it's epsilon not<br />
0 eta; it's metron not metron. ABC please follow. </p>
