    <content><![CDATA[<p>As the world marks sixty years since the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of World War II in Europe, we honour and remember those thousands of Australians who fought and died to defend the freedom of the world against the tyranny of Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago not only saw Germany surrender, but also the full extent of Nazism's evil revealed, through the liberation of Hitler's concentration camps.  Six million Jews and other minorities perished in those camps as a result of the most appalling genocide in mankind's history.</p>
<p>In recalling these events we should never forget the vital role played by Australia.</p>
<p>History will always record that with most of Europe in subjugation Britain, crucially aided by Australia and other Commonwealth nations, stood alone for twelve long months against a seemingly unstoppable enemy.  Victory in the Battle for Britain, in which Australian airmen were actively involved, changed the course of the war.</p>
<p>Australians also played an important role in North Africa and in the subsequent air war over Europe.</p>
<p>As we commemorate VE Day 2005, we should join to give thanks for the relative peace of the past sixty years and recommit ourselves to the universal values of freedom and democracy.  </p>
