Workers thinking about changing their career or updating their skills will be able to compare courses, fees, providers and the quality of training on offer through a new My Skills website.</p>
<p>My Skills  -  to be launched later this year  -  will ensure students and businesses can find the training that is right for them.</p>
<p>Right now, there is no consistent or authoritative source of information on training providers. Different providers have different fees, varying level of student satisfaction and varying success in providing a pathway to employment or further training.</p>
<p>This lack of available data means it can be difficult for an employer or an individual to make an informed choice about which training course is most appropriate for them.</p>
<p>Through My Skills, Australians will be able to research the courses on offer in the VET system by the approximately 5000 registered providers. It will bring greater transparency and choice to the sector by allowing for comparisons to be made. </p>
<p>Over time, the service will cover student fees, the outcomes of satisfaction surveys and greater information at the individual campus or training location level. It will also include information about the availability of student services such as childcare arrangements, as well as links to local employment opportunities.</p>
<p>My Skillswill be a key measure to boost transparency in the vocational education and training system.</p>
<p>A new Unique Student Identifier will also be introduced so students will be able to access information about their training record from a single authoritative source.</p>
<p>This will help students keep track of their qualification and training, as they upskill and reskill throughout their career.</p>
<p>It will also give the Government better access to data on where training funds are being spent, boosting accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>Together, these changes will lead to improved efficiency and better outcomes in the training system.  </p>
