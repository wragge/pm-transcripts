PRIME INISTER'S T. V. " FACE THE NATION" 2ND AUGUST, 1959<br />
QUESTION: Mir. Menzies, after your recent visit to The Hague you<br />
re-affirmed Australia's support for Dutch sovereignty in West New<br />
Guinea. The Indonesians seemed to take this as a change of front<br />
on the part of the Australian Government. Is that so?<br />
MR. MENZIESNo, it is not. You may remember that after the<br />
visit, the very happy visit, I thought, by Dr. Subandrio to<br />
Australia, I made a speech in Parliament in which I indicated what<br />
our policy was in the light of our discussions with him. Now it<br />
was quite clear, it was and is quite clear, that we support the<br />
Dutch claim to sovereignty. I put it to Dr. Subandrio myself that<br />
I would like to know what the legal basis was of-the Indonesian<br />
claim to sovereignty. And he explained at once that it was not on<br />
legal grounds but on political grounds, and that was why the matter<br />
had never been taken by Indonesia to the International Court.<br />
Now that represents no change of front at all on our<br />
part. We have frequently repeated that we recognise Dutch<br />
sovereignty. If that sovereignty is to be changed then it must be<br />
changed only by an agreement truly negotiated between themselves and<br />
the Indonesians or by the decision of the Court. That was our<br />
position. That remains our position.<br />
QUESTION: Speaking of Dr. Subandrio, when he was here in February,<br />
I think it was, there was a joint conmunique in the course of which<br />
there was a hope that was expressed that there might be some day a<br />
treaty of friendship between the two nations. Has that matter<br />
been carried any further?<br />
MIvR, NZIES: ' Tell, I do not know ,/ hat has happened during my<br />
absence, but as you may havo heard I have an arrangement to go to<br />
Indonesia myself before the end of the year. I do not know what<br />
date, but I have accepted an invitation to go there before the end<br />
of the year. And in that event, of course, we would pursue it<br />
and very properly, because one thing which was quite clear during<br />
Dr. Subandrio's visit was that we had no points of difference,<br />
speaking in essential terms, other than our difference of view as<br />
to the sovereignty of ' Jest New Guinea. And, therefore, there is<br />
ample scope for friendship and honourable association. </p>
<p>-9 STION Before leaving the subject, Kr. l. enzies, vihat do you<br />
foresee for the ultimate future of Dutch " Tei Guinea.<br />
I INZIES: ell, it is very difficult to look into the future<br />
but if you look far enough then I would ho,; e to see selffrovemment<br />
in New Guinea and I think theru would be areat merit<br />
myself in seeing that as self-goverment of the entire island.<br />
You see, treating it as a hole, because ethnologically there<br />
are very few distinctions to be made between the people of the<br />
West and the people of the East and the people of Papua.<br />
Now our policy as you know has been and is to<br />
-rorote tho ielfare of the native people, many of .; horn of<br />
course are still living in their remote lnd rather savage<br />
conditions, but to promote their welfare so that some day, which<br />
is certainly not goin; to be next year or the year after or<br />
something like that; some day they will be broutt to a state<br />
of life in which they can accept self-govcrnment. Anu so far as<br />
the Dutch are concerned they have told us that tIhey have the<br />
same ultimate ambition for their people, ( nd therefore in the<br />
long run, it won't eorhmcps be in my time as Prime Iinist-r, but in<br />
due course, with all the efforts . e can make in the meantime to<br />
nromote thoir welfare, we may find an in. de'endent nation of native<br />
New Guinea citizens conducting their own affairs and I ho! e<br />
living in terms of close friendship with Australia. </p>
