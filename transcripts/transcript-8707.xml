    <content><![CDATA[<p>TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />DOORSTOP, MELBOURNE, 29 OCTOBER 1992<br />E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />( inaudible)</p>
<p><br />PM: What's knocking off their leave loading going to do for the place? The key to<br />Victoria has got to be more cooperation, more investment, more jobs, more work<br />and more activity. It's not this sort of thing, it's not confrontation, it's not hopping<br />into people. So it's what we expect from the Liberal Party and a foretaste of what<br />they'll see from Dr Hewson.</p>
<p><br />J: ( inaudible)</p>
<p><br />PM: If there's any confrontation in Victoria, it would be because Mr Kennett produced<br />it. And I think he should go backt what has been now a successful formula for a<br />decade of cooperation, discussion, reaching agreement, and for God's sake getting<br />businesses, unions and government together to get on with the place. Lct's get on<br />with growth.<br />leave loading?</p>
<p><br />PM: No, absolutely not. We've got today an inflation rate of .1 per cent. We've got today the lowest inflation rate in the world. Who would believe, who could make a case that the annual leave loading is affecting wages or competitiveness? It's just nonsense, it's just tribal Liberal Party nonsense.</p>
<p>ends.</p>
