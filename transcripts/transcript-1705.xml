CULTURA L ACTIVITIES<br />
I wish to inform the H! ouse of two decisions by the Government<br />
and a n-nmber of other develo;, ments in the field of cult'. lral activities.<br />
The Covernm:: ent, for some time, has been actively considering<br />
ways to increase, at natona level, Commonwealth atronage of the Arts<br />
without creating a monclithic structure which could inhibit the free play<br />
of our cultural interests and enthusiasms at all levels.<br />
For some years now Government encouragement for the<br />
arts in g0e neral has been increasingLL . a nd we feel that financial aid prcperlyj<br />
directed on the best advice is one significant area where the Commonwealth<br />
Government can provide material assistance.<br />
V. e need to ensure that we have a system for giving financial<br />
assistance which takes full account of the important role played, not only<br />
by State Governments, but by municipal governments and a host of professional<br />
and amateur organisations throughout the country.<br />
ith this in mind the Government, in its first decision on<br />
cultural activities, has decided to establish an Australian Council for the<br />
Arts to be its financial agent and adviser on the rerforning arts and other<br />
activities connected with the jirts in general.<br />
The Council v! f1L co-operate closely wivth the Elizabethan<br />
Thea; tre Trust and with e: ict-ng Commonwealth Governm-ent agencies<br />
resrcnsible for music, u. intng and literature.<br />
At this stage the C! ouncil will be concerned primarily with the<br />
perforr1ing arts but it should not be assumed that the concept of an allembracing<br />
Council, whic&gt; I know has some advocates in this country, has<br />
been rejected. The Council we -ropose to set up could conveniently be enlaroged<br />
to rerform such a function if experience showed t7. e need.<br />
This decision means that Government financial assistance for<br />
the arts in general will in future be given through two main channels:<br />
1. The new Ccuncil, which will be concerned with the theatre arts<br />
( drama, oi: era and ballet) and film making for television with<br />
an educational and cultural emphasis.<br />
2. xisting agencies i. e. the A ustralian -roadcasting Commission,<br />
the recently formed Music Board, the Cormironwealth Art<br />
Advisory ? card and the Commonwealth Literary Fund.<br />
The Council w! ill also advise the Governi-ent on special<br />
requests for aid in cultural activities not already covered by Government<br />
agencies and which, in the . East, have been dealt v. with on an ad hoc basis.<br />
I should add here that the inclusion of filmr-making for television<br />
in the activities to be ccvered by the new Council is not a substitute for full </p>
<p>consideration by the C-cverninent of submissions it has received for the<br />
estailishmnent of a Filrm Cor-oration to assist the film industry at lar'e.<br />
The intention to give further aid to fili1-rnaking for television<br />
is ipart of the Government's continuing effort to help in increasing the<br />
Australian content of television programmes in this country. The question<br />
of a Film Corporation, or some similar organisation, is a separate<br />
proposition which needs more study.<br />
The new Council will not, as a norrm. tal rractice finance carital<br />
works for the arts in the Ctates because this is not considered to be within<br />
the siphere of Commonwealth responsibility.<br />
The ElizaLbethan Theatre Trust will remain as a servicing<br />
organisation and entre. reneur and will continue its fund raising activities<br />
in the States. The Council willd'stribute financial aid for the performing arts<br />
pirimrarily, but not exclusively, through the Trust. Both the Council and the<br />
Trust will be supported by advisory committees in all States.<br />
Before deciding to establish this two-channel system of aid<br />
for the arts a close study was made of the foundations and councils for the<br />
arts in thle United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.<br />
The names of the Chairman, members of the Council and the<br />
Director will be announced -n due course. The Council will be associated<br />
with the Frime Minister's D: eartment.<br />
The Comnonvealth Government has also studied the work o6<br />
its existing agnecies and as I have already indicated they will continue to<br />
functica broadly in the samie way as they have in the ;, act, and the level of<br />
any increase in financial assistance will be considered in the Budget context,<br />
as will the grant to be made available to the new Council. There will be,<br />
of course, a close liaison between the new Council and the existing agencies.<br />
I might mention here that the Government already has under<br />
consideration increased azssste'nce to writers in A ustrajia as a result of<br />
recent dfscussions between the Advisory Board of the Commonwealth Literary<br />
7 und and the Fund's Farliaimentary Committee.<br />
The House vwl! also recall that we recently set up a Music<br />
Board . ecifically for the Au! rpose of advising the Commonwealth Government<br />
on assistance to Australin comiosers. This 3oard has been active since<br />
its inception and has just had a1-roval for a new rroject designed to promote<br />
the work of Australian czmrosers, nationally and internationally, and<br />
atterr-; t to remedy the lack of knowledge of our own music. The details<br />
of this roject are the uobject of a statement by me to thile press today.<br />
I turn now to the second important decision the Government<br />
has taken to encourage the arts in Australia.<br />
The House ! ill recall that my predecessor Sir Robert Menziec:<br />
and his administration decided that a national art gallery should be est lished<br />
in Canberra and in 1M L -x. cinted a committee of enquiry to consider vhat<br />
form it Chould take, what its function should be and how it should be controlled.<br />
This Committee, under the distin2uiished Chairmanship of<br />
Sir Deryl Lindsay, com-ileted its work last year and I would like to<br />
acknowledge here how comi-rirehensive the report is and how valuable it !-has<br />
been to the Government. It has contributed significantly to the Governmient's </p>
<p>latest decision on the art gaillery and is tabled in this Farliament for the<br />
information of -lonourable Membners.<br />
The Government has decided that work on the establishment<br />
of this national gallery will begin immediately.<br />
The National Capital Development Commission expects the<br />
planning, design and costing stage to take about two years. I site for<br />
the gallery is being considered.<br />
The Gallery will house the National Collection which at<br />
: resent consists of nearly 2, QCC works of art. -uture acquisitions will<br />
include A ustralian art tast -nd -: resent, art of the I sian and Facific<br />
areas and art on a world-wide basis, beginning with the 2Cth century.<br />
The Government believes the new gallery will add significantly<br />
to the cultural life of Australa and the national capital.<br />
It is hoped that this will be an added incentive to owners of<br />
art collections to consider bequeathing their collections to the Commonweslth.<br />
The Commonwealth has been active in recent years in acquiring<br />
new works for the national collection. It is also develocing an exchange of<br />
art exhibitions with other countries.<br />
The existence of an art gallery in Canberra will add materially<br />
to the dic-splay opportunities for visiting exhibitions and also for exhibitiens<br />
from the galleries in the various ctates.<br />
The Gallery will be named " The ustralian National Gallery"<br />
and will be controlled a Council, with a full-ti: e director. The C-uncil<br />
itself will be associated with the Frime Minister's Derartment. The Council<br />
members and the Director will be appointed in due course.<br />
These decisions will, I am sure give encouragement to t1hoe<br />
who have for so long given thir time and energy to advancing our ovwn<br />
distinctive cultural activities. I also hope that the growing public<br />
recognition of what our actors, our artists, our viriters, our musicians<br />
and others in a varied field af cultural interest are see. ing to do will add<br />
much to what the Government is doing.<br />
In the leaner years of the past, in the face of hardship and<br />
little encouragement yotung . u. ctralians have risen to fame and brought<br />
distinction to their country over a wide range of cultural activity. Given<br />
the suvx-ort of Governments, * ederal and Ctate, and the backing of tilhe<br />
peo) e, I am sure the talent is there for us to rise to new heights and give<br />
our , eo; 1e a growing pleasure and satisfaction. </p>
