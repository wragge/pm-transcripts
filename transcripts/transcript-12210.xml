The Coalition';s defence priorities for a third term of office will provide Australia with a long-term plan for the future security of our nation, our citizens and our interests.<br />
We are determined to ensure Australia';s defence in an uncertain world.  Since 1996 our policies have produced a sharper Australian Defence Force – more combat focussed, better equipped, better supported, more mobile and more operationally ready.<br />
Yet, the real work to build an even stronger ADF, able to face the full range of security concerns from conventional war and peace enforcement to terrorism and border protection, remains to be done.<br />
The Coalition, unlike Labor, will guarantee full implementation of the Defence White Paper and produce a more balanced ADF, ready to deploy at short notice and able to present Government with a wide range of options to defend Australia';s interests.<br />
The events of the past two years alone – East Timor, unauthorised boat arrivals and the September 11 terrorist attacks – show the unpredictable nature of the world we live and the importance of having an ADF able to respond to any external threat, whatever its nature.<br />
Our plan for the future is underpinned by the biggest increase in defence funding for over 20 years - $32.4 billion in real terms over the next decade.<br />
The Coalition';s defence priorities for a third term will be:   Introduction of a modern, flexible remuneration system for ADF personnel, coupled with enhanced family support measures;   Consolidation of the international effectiveness of the ADF through sound relationships with our allies and regional partners;   Changing the role of Reserves from mobilisation to meet remote threats to supporting and sustaining the types of contemporary military operations in which the ADF may be increasingly engaged;   Adoption of a more strategic industry policy based on sustaining key industry capabilities critical to Australia';s national security needs and better demand management of the ADF';s capability requirements;    Further enhancement of the ADF';s patrol boats, maritime surveillance aircraft and intelligence capabilities that are fully engaged in the day to day monitoring and policing of our maritime approaches; and Annual assessments of our strategic environment to ensure our defence outlook is kept current.<br />
The events of September 11 have also signalled the need for a higher-level response to the threat of terrorism.  The Coalition will significantly enhance Defence';s counter-terrorist and incident response capability and, specifically, better equip the ADF to deal with terrorist attacks which are highly planned and coordinated.<br />
The Coalition';s plan places special emphasis on the people in Defence and their families. In particular it recognises the unique requirements of service life and that employment within the ADF is more than just another job.<br />
During Labor';s 13 years in office over 15,000 ADF personnel were cut, combat capability was run down, spending on defence was steadily reduced, administrative inefficiency was rife and there was widespread defence mismanagement and neglect.<br />
Under Labor';s policies, the Army would simply have lacked the operational capability to restore peace and security to East Timor.<br />
Labor';s current policies would decimate the White Paper and strip the ADF of vital resources and equipment for dubious and untried ideas – like a Coastguard – that would place in jeopardy Australia';s security and the integrity of our borders.<br />
Australia';s defence remains a priority of the highest order for the Howard Government.  During a third term in office, the gains made over recent years will be consolidated and major new improvements in the ADF';s fighting capacity made.</p>
