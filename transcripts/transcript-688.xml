FOR PRESS P. m. No. 1&amp; Lt9L<br />
ECONOMIC ENQU~ IRY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
I have already anniounced the Government's decision<br />
to institute an Enquiry into a range of matters that bear directly<br />
on the objoctives of economic policy as the Government sees them.<br />
These objectives, which together constitute the mainspring of our<br />
economic policies, are explicitly set out in the Terms of Reference<br />
of the Committee of Enquiry now to be established. Their<br />
paramount importance is not, I think, to be denied, but a problem<br />
of increasing difficulty is to command a comprehensive view of all<br />
the complex and interlocking factors that must enter into their<br />
a, ch ie-vement. This problem confronts Governmeonts and their advisers<br />
Wat every t-. urn and we have had constantly before our minds the<br />
nature of the questions that the proposed Committee of Ehquiry<br />
might be called upon to answer. We have now decided that the<br />
Terms of Reference of the Committee as previously announced should<br />
be given in somewhat greater detail and that certain particular<br />
Wmatters that seemed of special importance should be specifically<br />
included. In addition, we have decided to make it clear that we<br />
expect the Committee, as far as may be possible, to draw together<br />
the results of its studies in the form, of conclusions as to<br />
the bear-in. g of those results cri the achievement of our overall<br />
economic objectives. The Term-s of Reference for the ] ff-nquiry that we have<br />
now decided upon are therefore the followving<br />
" Having in mind that the objectives of the<br />
Government's economic policy are a high rate of economic<br />
and population growth with full employment, increasing<br />
productivity, rising standards of living, external<br />
viability, and stability of costs and prices, to enquire<br />
into and report its findings on the following matters<br />
The trends in population as a whole, in the work<br />
force, and in the distribution o-f the latter<br />
amongst various sectors.<br />
The economic availability of knownm basic physical<br />
resources,<br />
The growth of domestic savings and investment.<br />
Wd Overseas investment in Australia ( including likely<br />
sources and trends and. an assessment of its<br />
significance to the Australian economy).<br />
The availability of credit.<br />
Trends in costs, prices and wages.<br />
Trends in productivity.<br />
( W The pattern of growth and geographical distribution<br />
of industry primary, secondary and tertiary<br />
( including Lhe governmental sector). 0a 0a 9 a .00/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
The consequences of this for the occupations].<br />
pattern of the work force<br />
Trends in the standard of living<br />
The situation with respect to the external<br />
balance of payments.<br />
Questions involved in the production in Australia<br />
of goods that would otherwise be imported.<br />
Production for export and the securing of<br />
adequate export outlets.<br />
The effect of customs tariffs and other forms,<br />
direct or indirect, of protection on the<br />
disposition of resources and on the broad<br />
economic objectives stated above.<br />
The Committee will report the conclusions<br />
reached by it as to the bearing which all or any of<br />
the matters so ascertained have upon the achievement<br />
of the economic policy objectives above stated."<br />
The Committee, which will commence its work in the<br />
near future, will comprise<br />
Dr. James Vernon, C. BoE. ( Chairman)<br />
Professor Sir John Crawford, C. BoE. ( Vice<br />
Chairman)<br />
Professor PH. Karmel<br />
D. Ge Molesworth, Esq., C oBE.<br />
K. B. Myer, Esq,, D. S. C.<br />
Dr. Vernon is Managing Director of the Colonial<br />
Sugar Refining Co. Ltd., which has extensive interests in<br />
aspects of primary and secondary industry. He is well known<br />
as a man of exceptional ability and judgment, with a fine record<br />
of public service. Cabinet decided that the Chairmanship should<br />
go to one who would properly be regarded as detached from any<br />
present or past formulation or execution of government economic<br />
policies. Sir John Crawfordts capacity to take a prominent<br />
part in this investigation is universally acknowledged by every<br />
section of productive industry and business generally, as well as<br />
in high academic circles. When I told Sir John ( who was, of<br />
course, for years the Permanent Head of the Trade Department)<br />
that we desired to have a completely outside Chairman but that<br />
we greatly desired his own services, he at once, with great<br />
generosity, expressed his complete willingness to serve as Vice-<br />
Chairman. Having regard to the burden of responsible work which<br />
Sir John has recently assumed, we are most grateful to him. I<br />
think that everybody will agree that an economic enquiry without<br />
his influential participation would be seriously handicapped,<br />
Professor Karmol, of Adelaide, is a distinguished<br />
academic economist, of high repute in his own field. </p>
<p>8' 3-<br />
Mr. Molesworth is Chairman of rP4. Walker Ltd., a<br />
large meat packing organisation which controls abattoirs, cold<br />
stores, and has interests in sheep and cattle. The company<br />
at one time or another has been associated with virtually<br />
every Australian primary product. It owns butter facteries<br />
and has grown wheat as well as distributing fruit and<br />
vegetables throughout Australia including Tasmania.<br />
Mr. Molesworth has himself for 5' 0 years been<br />
closely associated with primary industries both in marketing<br />
at home and abroad, and in property management, He has been<br />
a member of the Australian Egg Board since 194+ 8. He has most<br />
valuably represented export interests in the negotiation of<br />
freight rates on Australian exports. As a Chartered Accountant,<br />
he was a member of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation in<br />
1960-61. He will contribute a knowledge of trading and<br />
marketing problems of important sections of primary industry<br />
and a wealth of experience in the problems of distribution,<br />
management and finance.<br />
Mr. Kenneth Myer is, of course, well knmown as<br />
Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of Myer Emporium Ltd.<br />
of Melbourne. The Governmont is grateful to these busy and able<br />
men who have agreed to accept this additional burden, and is<br />
confident that a great purpose will be served by the Enquiry<br />
on whichi they are embarking.<br />
