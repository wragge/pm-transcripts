TIE CA1D1NAL'S DINNER<br />
S E -14 N S I.-3OT JU1Y64<br />
Seech byte Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
My Lord Cardinal, My Lords Bishops, Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
and Ladies and Gentlemen This is really a most embarrassing occasion<br />
for me. There is nothing I enjoy half so much as a hostile<br />
audience. ( Laughter) Tinignt I have been listening to speeches,<br />
eminently true about her, and deplorably exaggerated about me.<br />
( Laughter) I think this is rathebad for me. I doi.' t think<br />
a politician ought to be too much praised in his own lifetime.<br />
Well, I'll put it this way to you, in the worst moments of my<br />
unpopularity with this writer or this paper or that, I have<br />
been perfectly certain that the obituary notice will be pretty<br />
good. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
aSince we are in Shakespearian mood, I am bound<br />
to tell you at once that i am no orator as Muldoon is ( Applause)<br />
but I hope that somebody has recorded what he said ( Laughter)<br />
and I will arrange with my solicitors to have this sent with a<br />
compliments slip on thie day of my demise, and it will read very<br />
rell then and my grandchildren will enjoy it. My children will<br />
read it with a slightly lifted eyebrow ( Laughter) and my wife,<br />
God bless her, will in her charity say, " Ah, if they only knew".<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause) Now, your 1 ninence, it's a little late and I<br />
don't want to take up too much of your tJme, but one thing I<br />
did think about as I contemplated this evening and that was that<br />
it is not so lcng ago oh, in the last year or two tht I<br />
encountered a telegrLaph messenger on a bicycle, You inow, that's<br />
not such an uncommon phenomenon a telegraph messenger on a<br />
bicycle. He'd come to the Lodge, probably to deliver a few<br />
abusive telegrams. hnd i stopped him and with a quiet face<br />
I said to him, " My dear bcy, what are you going to be in the<br />
long run? A Cardinal? A Minister of the Crown? A Director-<br />
General of Postal Services?" And he looked at me with a blank<br />
face and rode off. i don't think he has ever come back to the<br />
Lodge. ( Laughter) I think he went back to the Postmaster and<br />
said, " The old fellowts a nut". ( Laughter) And yet it's<br />
perfectly true. A Cardinal, Sir9 Ministers of the Crown,<br />
Directors-General, they all began life as telegraph messengers.<br />
( Laughter) The one thing that really upsets me as a sound<br />
Presbyterian and Protestant in this deplorable gathering tonight<br />
( Laughter), the one thing that upsets me is that there is no<br />
record of a Moderator-General having been a telegraph messenger.<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause) Anyhow, Sir, there is a great significance.<br />
I say no more about your over-kind remarks. I wish only that<br />
I merited them. But i do want to say something to you about one<br />
or two prooblems. The first thing to say about them is that<br />
there is too much time wasted in this world on side issues.<br />
There is too much time wasted by people who have the end in<br />
common taking time off to fight each other about the methods<br />
of achieving the end, In other words, to put it quite bluntly,<br />
there is far too much intolerance in the world, and in Australia. ø/ 2<br />
( Dame Pattie) </p>
<p>If I come here tonight, as I have, there will be some<br />
alleged Christian who will say I'm cultivating your vote.<br />
You know? ( Laughter) PJell, it's a little bit too late to<br />
do that, at the moment. But there is this nagging idea<br />
in so many minds that although we are all the children of<br />
God and hope to serve His purposes in this world, there is<br />
an unbridgeable difference between those who do it this<br />
way and those who do it that way.<br />
Your Eminence, we are all members one of<br />
another. This is something we must never lose sight cf,<br />
and whether we be Catholic or Protestant or Jewish or<br />
Muslim, the end remains clear: Vie have an overwhelming<br />
duty to serve cur country on the highest level and to the<br />
best of our talents, and so what I want to say to you is,<br />
first of all, a little plea for tolerance.<br />
Tolerance does not mean flabbiness.<br />
Tolerance of each other does not mean that we condone evil<br />
things or that we are not prepared to fight against evil<br />
things. Tolerance is mutual understanding, forbearance, a<br />
desire to assemble ourselves every time there is a common<br />
cause to be served. And we need tolerance not only<br />
religious tolerance political tolerance, social tolerance.<br />
I suppose i' is one of the signs of the fact that we are a<br />
rather young country that there is still too much intolerance<br />
and bitterness. If I were asked at the end of my political<br />
life to say, " d/ Jell, Menzies, do you think you ever did anything<br />
that was any good?" I would pause for a reply, but I<br />
think one thing I would like to say for myself would be that<br />
I had never lent myself to any bitter disputes between people<br />
on the basis of their religion, their political views or their<br />
social position. ( Applause) In other words, Sir, I believe<br />
that there is a chronic need in our cuuntry, and indeed in all<br />
countries, for cool, objective, dispassionate discussion,<br />
thought and utterance, My friend, Sir Charles McDonald, who rather<br />
overplays me, I think, in his speech, is a classical scholar.<br />
3very time I meet him I am reminded cf this because he takes<br />
me promptly out of my depth by some profound classical<br />
allusion ( Laughter) but I would like him to know that there<br />
is a famous passage in Horace which I will do into English<br />
for the benefit of those educated at the Sydney University<br />
( Laughter) and that is, as he will recall " I remember<br />
always to keep a calm mind in difficult matters". This is<br />
a profound truth " I remember always to keep a calm mind in<br />
difficult matters". This is the greatest advice that could<br />
be given to anybody. We would solve our problems more quickly<br />
and soundly if we remembered that observation all the time<br />
something cool, dispassionate, objective.<br />
Now I am mentioning that to you because<br />
one thing that I wanc to say something about tonight is<br />
that there has been a little controversy going on I<br />
believe it is still going on about my famous proposal, now<br />
in operation, that the Commonwealth Government not by<br />
reason of any obligation but as a contribution to education<br />
in Australia would find œ 5M. a year, for science teaching.<br />
I will use a comprehensive expression for science laboratories,<br />
science equipment in secondary schools. Now this,<br />
in my innocence, I thought was a sensible idea. I didn't<br />
know when I pronounced it, that it was so loaded with sinister aspects. / 3 </p>
<p>Five millonpoundsa year yes, it's a great sum of money, and<br />
particularly if it is each year, a useful sum of money, and why<br />
did we do it? iell, we had various things in mind. In the<br />
first place, Australia in this scientific technological age,<br />
needs more people trained in science, better trained in science.<br />
The Australian universities need to have better equipped students<br />
coming up to them in science. Ve need to have, so far as we can,<br />
in the secondary school stages, such an encouragement of talent<br />
by teaching and equipment and every other way as to produce more<br />
people who will teach in these universities, maintain the standards<br />
of the past and increase them, improve them, as they ought to be<br />
improved for the future.<br />
The greatest shortage in the forward look in universities<br />
is the shortage of trained and competent staff. All these<br />
cther things are material things money, bricks, mortar. I am<br />
not saying that there is no limit to these things, but they are,<br />
* viewed in comparison, the smallest aspects of the problem, and<br />
if we are to have more and more people being trained in science,<br />
trained through some aspect of science in medicine, trained in<br />
engineering and if we are to have this done in universities<br />
that are not third-rate universities so that we won't have bad<br />
* money driving out good, then everything that can be done to<br />
improve the standard of the student in the secondary school, many<br />
of whom will go to the university, many of whom will go into<br />
other fields of applied jcience, anything that we can do seems<br />
to me to be all to the good,<br />
Therefore, in my innocence, I thought: " lell, this<br />
is a pretty good. idea, We'll do it." And we've done it and<br />
we will go on doing it, ( Applause) Then, apparently, some<br />
dispute arises. Should you do this for church secondary schools?<br />
That's the first question.<br />
SWell. I had the numbers typed out for me today and<br />
the position is chat in the secondary schools of Australia as at<br />
present, we have 674000 students and of these :-92,000 are in<br />
Government schools, 120,000 ( I am taking it to the nearest<br />
thousand) in Catholic schools and 62,000 inn: n-Cathoic schools.<br />
Well, those are very interesting figures. The first question<br />
that presents itseli is: Should the Commonwealth confine its<br />
aid to science and equipment to the Government secondary schools?<br />
Well, now, I am not going to buy into fields so much<br />
more competently handled by some of my friends here tonight as to<br />
what a State ought to do. Not a bit, because if a State which<br />
has the direct responsibility for primary and secondary education<br />
decides that it will have one system of education that the State<br />
will conduct, that's the State's business. Don't treat me as<br />
intervening in that field.<br />
But when the Commonwealth comes along, with no<br />
obligation, making a grant in aid for a particular purpose, then<br />
the Commonwealth is bound to recognise that in fact there are<br />
two systems, that in fact there are Government secondary schools<br />
and there are non-Government secondary schools, and therefore<br />
the first thing that the opponent finds himself putting up is,<br />
" All right. IWell, now I don't mind the Commonwealth finding œ XM.<br />
a year for science laboratories in State or Government schools,<br />
but you are not to extend this to non-Government schools, whatever<br />
they may be." Well, now, this seems to me to defy not only the facts<br />
of life which are that a very substantial percentage of students<br />
in secondary schools are in non-Government schools, but it also / 4. </p>
<p>would involve me in saying, " I'm not running the State educational<br />
system-I'm producing a grant in aid by the Commonealth. Now<br />
on what principle do I say this may go to the Government of New<br />
South Wales but no portion of it may go to the Sydney Grammar<br />
School, or name any non-Government school you care to mention."<br />
And, quite frankly, whether: it is through stupidity or otherwise,<br />
I just don't understand how any such distinction can be made.<br />
For us to discriminate in making a grant in aid fcr a purpose<br />
ofo high national significance, for us to discriminate between<br />
Government schools and non-Government schools, would open up a<br />
world of discrimination in other fields to my mind equally<br />
unjustifiable. Then, of course, there are those who say, " Well,<br />
whatever you do, if you decide you won't discriminate, you can't<br />
fail to discriminate between Protestant schools and Roman<br />
Catholic schools", And the answer is that if I hiad to do that,<br />
I wouldntt want to be in public life,, ( Applause)<br />
Now, I think that a good deal of this confusion<br />
that has arisen, has aciser because these elementary facto that<br />
I have been referring to haven't been understood and I repeat<br />
them for emphasis. What a State dces about its educational system,<br />
what it decides as to which sy3tem it will support i. s its business<br />
and there is a long history behind these things. Buat the<br />
Commonwealth Government coming in to give some special assistance<br />
for a speciol purpcse has no right to discrimi. nate. The benefit<br />
of its aid must go all round for the purpose that has been<br />
indicated. ( Applause" And, Sir, I am happy to say, rightly or weonqly,<br />
Ive ben acting on this principle for a long time, becalse it<br />
was my own Government which introduced tax rebates on school<br />
fees, and I don't remember at that time any argument gci. ng on<br />
to the effect that a parent could have a deduction from income<br />
tax for school fees paid to a State high school but not for school<br />
fees paid to the Methodist Ladies College. I didn't hear any<br />
argument to that effect and I think if it had been put, it would<br />
have been laughed out of court. Anyhow, it never was put.<br />
And then right back in 1950/ 51, I began my own<br />
exercises which I am happy -o say have been not unfrui'ful in<br />
the universities field because we are not responsible for the<br />
universities except for our own in Canberra. A Committee was<br />
put up to make a very quick investigation and I was told at a<br />
certain stage that the Committee took the view that the residential<br />
colleges at the universities ought not to be in the picture<br />
because presumably a university could exist without them or<br />
alternatively, they were not really part of a university. ft<br />
gave me singular satisfaction at that time to say to the Comnittee:<br />
" Unless there is some recommendation in your list for the<br />
residential colleges at the universities, I will ignore your<br />
report" and so we got a little toe in the door I think that's<br />
the expression. Then when the Murray Committee came along, all<br />
this was established, and from that time on, as you know, we have<br />
found very substantial sums of money for residential colleges,<br />
and the interesting thing is that I don't remember any residential<br />
college refusing ( Laughter). IJe didn't discriminate. Thore<br />
are colleges connected with the churches in the University of<br />
Sydney. I don't remember any one of them saying, " Sorry, we<br />
can't take this." Of course they took it, because they understood<br />
quite clearly that this was something extra being put in by the<br />
Commonwealth, not of obligation, but as a national contribution, </p>
<p>every penny of which is provided by the people of the nation,<br />
whatever their religious denomination may be. ( Applause) And so<br />
that has gone along very successfully, very happily, and as I go<br />
into the universities, I realise, to the very great advantage of<br />
the universities. Look, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing that<br />
all of us here tonight must bear in mind all the time. Everything<br />
I say is about what the Commonwealth does in this rather extra<br />
operation that it performs. But I have always been a tremendous<br />
believer in schools and in colleges at universities which have a<br />
background of religion and the reason for that the overwhelming<br />
reason for that is that I would get no satisfaction in thinking<br />
that we had pledged ourselves to a highly intellectual, if you<br />
like, but highly pagan future. ( Applause) The world is full of<br />
talent. Not quite so full of character.<br />
The world is full of the most tremendous skill,<br />
inventive genius the things that have gone on in my lifetime are<br />
unbelievable. Nobody would ever have believed them in 1900 when<br />
I was a boy of five. Nobody would have. But the whole century<br />
has been marred, time after time, by man's inhumanity to man, by<br />
a failure of the spirit, and a failure of the spirit is a failure<br />
V of the character, and if we are going to have a high spirit and a<br />
high character, an enduring character, then it is all nonsense to<br />
say that I must engage in these almost absurd discriminations that<br />
have been suggested. I am all for character. I am all for the<br />
man whose character is rooted in eternal beliefs because he is the<br />
man, she is the woman who will assure the future of this country.<br />
( Applause) My Lord Cardinal, I am very grateful to the Bishop<br />
for that speech of his. I am sure ha must have spoken it with a<br />
slight mental reservation. ( Laughter) I don t want to engage in<br />
theological arguments but it was all, you know, rather true in<br />
a sense. Flattering in more senses than one. but very heartwarming.<br />
But I wouldn't like him to think he was bound to go on believing<br />
it for the rest of his life. ( Laughter)<br />
0 Your Eminence, I began by a little glancing reference<br />
to your earliest days. I vas very amused when you told me tonight<br />
that at the last meeting in Rome the debate was conducted in Latin<br />
but there were people who spoke Latin with a French pronunciation<br />
and some with a German and some with an Italian pronunciation in<br />
which they say " in c( h) aelo". I never quite understood... but<br />
anyhow...... And others with different pronunciations. Well this<br />
must have been extraordinarily difficult because even with us there<br />
is the old pronunciation on which Charles McDonald was brought up,<br />
no doubt, there is the new pronunciation on which a mere boy like<br />
me was brought up ( Laughter), there is a law courts pronunciation<br />
which is one of highly enlightened illiteracy. ( Laughter)<br />
All I know is that on one occasion, one year, my wife<br />
and I were in Malta. We visited Malta for a day and one of the<br />
things to be done in that hectic day was for me to be given not<br />
for the first time an unearned increment, an honorary degree at<br />
the Royal University of Malta. Just as we set out on our journey,<br />
they put into my hands the Latin that I had to pronounce at a<br />
faldstool in the course of getting this degree. It was about<br />
two or three hundred words. For a fellow a littly rusty in his<br />
Latin, this was a grim prospect. However, I read it through and<br />
thought about it a bit, and when we entered ultimately the<br />
university, the Vice Chancellor who was a lively character met me<br />
a o e / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
and I said," Quickly, quickly before we go up there, what is<br />
it? New pronunciation or old?" He said " It doesn't matter.<br />
None of them will know. You just mumcle. ( Laughter) So to<br />
the great puzzlement of my wife and my staff, there I ws kneeling<br />
and mumbling. ( Laughter) My wife said to me afterwards, " Never<br />
heard you mumble like that before". And I said, " No and you<br />
have never heard me mumble in a better cause." ( Laughter)<br />
Sir, ladies and gentlemen, you have beer more than<br />
kind. We've enjoyed this very muh. I hope to get the written<br />
record at some time. It will come in handy for me, not only<br />
with my fellow politicians important though that may be but<br />
occasionally uFeful with my wife ( Laughter), always useful with<br />
my children and. beyond rubies with my grandchildren. </p>
