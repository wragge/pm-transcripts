    <content><![CDATA[<p>From 2 – 4 June, I will make my first official visit as Prime Minister to Singapore.</p>
<p>I will deliver the keynote address at the opening of the 16th Shangri-La Dialogue, and will hold the second Australia-Singapore annual leaders’ talks with Singaporean Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
<p>The Shangri-La Dialogue is the largest and most important annual gathering of defence ministers, defence force chiefs and senior security officials in the Indo-Pacific. It provides an important opportunity to set out Australia’s vision for a stable, prosperous and rules-based region built on open economies.</p>
<p>My meeting with Prime Minister Lee will be a timely opportunity to exchange views on the changing strategic landscape and the importance of regional institutions, including ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, in ensuring regional stability and economic prosperity.</p>
<p>We will also review the excellent progress made across the four pillars of our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership: trade and economic, defence and security, innovation and science cooperation and cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Australia’s relationship with Singapore is one of the closest and most comprehensive in the region. It is a relationship built on complementary economies and shared strategic interests.</p>
<p>I look forward to further strengthening the links between our two economies, our institutions and our people.</p>
