TRANSCRIPT: " THE MIKE WALSH SHOW", TCN CHANNEL NINE, SYDNEY.<br />
INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. R. J. L. -HAWKE, AC, LP.<br />
DATE: WEDNESDAY, 26TH SEPTEMBER 1984<br />
WALSH: Welcome Mr. Prime Minister, and Bob may I say that I don't<br />
want to dwell on the family thing at all and I don't think we'll<br />
discuss it here today excqpt to say, on behalf of all of the<br />
Ui1-e Walsh Show viewersand myselfA that we're very proud of the way<br />
Hazel handled it the other night and so must you be, and we feel<br />
for your as a family. OK? That's all we wanted to say.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thank you very much.<br />
VALSH: So Okay Bob, let's get back into the ring and it's politics,<br />
right? PRIME MINISTER: Okay.<br />
TIALSH: We had Andrew Peacock on the show yesterday and his main<br />
line of, shall we say, approach. seemed to be the Costigan Report<br />
and he is playing along with that and he says that's the big issue<br />
at the moment organised crime in this country and he quoted<br />
Costigan himself and the quote was: " Inconsistent and disastrous<br />
to your Government's oft-expressed desire to attack sophisticated<br />
crime". So that's what Costigan apparently said to you when he<br />
heard that you were winding up the Costigan Report.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well that's not an accurate way of putting it,<br />
of course, There have been discussions which went on between<br />
Commissioner Costigan and the previous Government.<br />
WALSH: Yes exactly, we pointed that out yesterday.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And with this Government. And it's been common<br />
to both Governments that here was a Royal Commission which is not<br />
a nomal instrument for a continuing fight against organised crime.<br />
Let me make it clear in saying that: that that involves no explicit<br />
or implicit condemnation of Commissioner Costigan. I mean I'm on<br />
the public record, in the Parliament and outside, of saying he has<br />
done a tremendous job for Australia. But what the Fraser Government<br />
and this Government have had in common is that we always intended<br />
that that short term Royal Commission would be subsumed into a<br />
permanent National Crimes Authority. Now It's quite clear that there<br />
are differences of emphasis, not only on the part of Mr. Commissioner<br />
Costigan but of other people, as to what is the appropriate time and<br />
form of transition. So we have been through all that and what we </p>
<p>S1% t1 r A &amp; Aj Ptl J. l Wf &amp; JLAl U. IfV<br />
have done now is to get a position where we think that you have got<br />
an institution which meets the three requirements that Australian<br />
society needs in having a permanent authority to fight crime.<br />
That is, it must be an effective instrument to fight crime,<br />
WALSH: Well that's what he was concerned with yesterday. He said<br />
it's a toothless tiger.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No well let me make these points about that and<br />
I think this is I mean I don't want to get into talking about<br />
Mr. Peacock for fairly obvious reasons but I think the great<br />
disservice that is being done to this community in its fight against<br />
organised crime and I think it goes without saying there is no one<br />
more dedicated to getting the criminals of this country behind bars,<br />
and particularly in regard to the major area of what we know is<br />
involved in organised crime, than I am. I want to get every one<br />
of them behind bars so that we can eliminate. these abominations.<br />
Now you've got to do that in a way which is effective. Now what do<br />
you do to ensure effectiveness? Firstly, you have got to ensure<br />
that all the material, the faluable material, that has been got<br />
together by Mr. Commissioner Costigan is made available handed<br />
over to the National Crimes Athority. And that is being done<br />
all of it not only the material and his 42 lines of investigation<br />
but his staff, his analysts, his accountants, his solicitors all<br />
the investigation techniques are being handed over. Now what I<br />
was saying is that what I find so disturbing: about what is being<br />
done by Mr. Peacock and others is that they are undermining the<br />
integrity and the authority of the National Crimes Authority.<br />
WALSH: Well they are implying that it's toothless, yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well you see that means that you are saying that<br />
Mr. Justice Stewart I mean, than whom there is no more highly<br />
respected crime fighter in Australia that he would accept the<br />
Chairmanship of a National Crimes Authority which is a toothless<br />
tiger; that Mr. Bingham, a Liberal Minister from the State<br />
Government of Tasmania, and Mr. Dwyer from Victoria who, let me<br />
remind you, were unanimously endorsed by all the State Governments<br />
and the Northern Territory. Now are all the State Governments,<br />
Liberal and Labor, going to give their endorsement to an authority<br />
under Mr. Justice Stewart and with a former Liberal Minister,<br />
Mr. Bingham, are they going to give their authority to a toothless<br />
tiger? It is one which carries on all the material from<br />
Mr. Commissioner Costigan. We are not closing down the work of<br />
Mr. Commissioner Costigan. We are doing what the previous<br />
Government and this Government has said that you've got to set<br />
up a permanent authority which will fight crime and importantly,<br />
Mike, will take account of the rights and the civil liberties of<br />
individuals.<br />
WALSH: Well that's what's worrying me about it because there is<br />
a bit of a McCarthyism thing about the thing isn't there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course, look with all the depth of feeling<br />
that I have on this issue I still recognise that the rights and<br />
civil liberties of individuals cannot be swept aside. We are not<br />
going to have in this society, in our unshakeable commitment to<br />
fight organised crime and to get those people behind bars that<br />
should be behind bars, we are not going to eliminate our concern<br />
for the rights of individuals. We are not going to have trial by<br />
~ i~ ii~ </p>
<p>headlines. We are not going to have trial by smear and innuendo.<br />
People are going to have the rights to be tried by their peers<br />
after proper investigation. So we are going to have an effective<br />
crime authority, we are going to protect the rights of individuals,<br />
and importantly, we are going to have the cooperation of the States.<br />
And that is why, Mike, we have got the situation that Special<br />
Prose tor Redlich has said: at page 48 of his report he said<br />
the community has debated this issue, they have taken these three<br />
things into account; that is, having an effective instrument to<br />
fight crime, the protection of the rights of individuals, and the<br />
cooperation of the States. He said now those things have been<br />
properly taken into account with the setting up of this Authority.<br />
He said what's required is now to have the community allow that to<br />
work. I think it's a tragedy that the authority and capacity of<br />
this National Crimes Authority is being questioned.<br />
WALSH: Bob if I just may make a point.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WALSH: I think we have all seen these Commissions come and go and<br />
you hear names bandied about I agree with you, let's not bandy<br />
them about publicly, it's just absolutely irresponsible but there<br />
is obviously a group of people running all these rackets in the<br />
country heroin behing one of them and you hear all this thing<br />
about we're going to get them we're going to get them we're<br />
going to get them another commission another commission<br />
nothing every happens. I mean, could you say to me in 12 months<br />
time we'll have got them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can say this, that we're very much more likely<br />
in 12 months to have them than we would have been before because<br />
we will have all the work every part of the work of Commissioner<br />
Costigan which, without any disrespect to Mr. Costigan, and he<br />
has said this himself, contains evidence which will be admissable<br />
and a lot of evidence which will not be admissable.<br />
WALSH: Hearsay.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now what you have got to do therefore is to have<br />
an authority which will concentrate on obtaining sifting out all<br />
the admissable evidence which will then go to prosectution<br />
because that's what we've got to get under way. Now let me just<br />
make the point about the commitmnnt to this question and the<br />
attitude on the National Crimes Authority: r. Commissioner<br />
Costigan brought down his most damning report in December of 1981<br />
where be said his investigations had led him to organised crime<br />
which he described as the fastest growing industry in Australia.<br />
Now this was December 1981, Mike, and he said that this was the<br />
fastest growing industry in Australia, particularly in the last<br />
five years. That is, from 1976 to 1981. Now you know who was in<br />
power then, and that's when it grew. Now the next Budget that<br />
our opponents had when they were then in Government came in 1982<br />
and they allocated $ 2.9 million for resources of the Costigan<br />
Commission. In my first Budget the next year I more than doubled<br />
the resources -the financial resources. I7e had doubled the resources<br />
available to the Costigan crime commission because of our commitment<br />
and we are going to make sure that all those resources go across to<br />
the National Crimes Authority. And may I make this point:<br />
Mr. Peacock is now talking about what he feels about the National<br />
Crimes Authority it being a toothless tiger I just want to make / 4 </p>
<p>this point to you and to the people of Australia when this Bill<br />
establishing the National Crimes Authority was in the Parliament<br />
in the Second Reading Speech that is when you put your position,<br />
your view. I spoke in that debate in the Parliament. Mr. Peacock<br />
did not speak in the debate that's how much he was interested in<br />
and concerned with the structure of the National Crimes Authority.<br />
He did not speak in the debate. There was not a division on the<br />
Second Reading. They did not seek to divide the House. The Bill<br />
went through in those circumstances without Mr, Peacock speaking<br />
against it. So that's the judgement you can make.<br />
WALSH: Alright. Well we'll leave that just as it is. Now we're<br />
going to do the interview in two parts. In the second part there's<br />
a lot of other points we want to cover but just before I get off<br />
the Costigan report and you explained quite a lot we contacted<br />
Senator Fred Chaney, the Leader of the Liberals in the Senate,<br />
right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WALSH: Because Don Chipp had said that he was going to have<br />
Mr. Costigan brought before the Senate. The comment from him was<br />
that their main concern is that the Costigan Report come into<br />
Parliament rather than Mr. Costigan himself and that there is a<br />
chance for debate on that'report before Mr. Hawke dissolves<br />
Parliament and goes into an election. You haven't announced the<br />
election yet have you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WALSH: We'll get to that after in ten years time. ( laughs)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That'll be after the third Hawke Government.<br />
WALSH: Now Senator Fred Chaney said he had had some discussions<br />
with Senator. Chipp and they are looking at the proposal but have<br />
not yet decided whether this step should be taken. What would<br />
your feelings be would you be worried about Costigan going<br />
before the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not only not worried about it.<br />
WALSH: Would it serve any purpose?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Tell, you talked about Senator Chipp, let me,<br />
I think the way we can get to the point about Senator Chipp's<br />
view on this is just to quote Senator Chipp for whom, as you know,<br />
I have great respect in these matters. I'll just make two quotes<br />
about it. This is from the 24th of September.: e said: " It was<br />
always the intention even of Mr. Fraser's Government to hand over<br />
Mr. Costigan's work to the National Crime Authority" so he says<br />
" So I'm surprised at questions journalists are still asking will<br />
the National Crime Authority be able to do what Mr. Costigan did?<br />
It will presuming it has the ability to do, it's certainly got the<br />
capacity, and I've got enormous faith in the three members of it<br />
headed by Ur. Justice Stewart". And just again, he said this, I<br />
think it's very pertinent because you were talking about him, he<br />
said and this is Senator Chipp " My second information is, and<br />
I had a courtesy call from the three members of the National<br />
Crime Authority Mr. Justice Stewart and his two colleagues, one<br />
of whom I must remind you is a former Liberal leader in Tasmania,<br />
Mr. Max Bingham a man of undoubted integrity,-and they assured<br />
me without any equivocation that they were happy with the takeover,<br />
i~ i </p>
<p>WALSH: -In other words you telegraph the information for guys to<br />
get out of the country or whatever.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes sure. Sc what I'm saying is Mr. Peacock<br />
if he is still then Leader of the Opposition will have the<br />
full report. The Leader of the Opposition will have everything.<br />
We won't try and hide it, they'll have it, and the only nonpublication<br />
of names will be to satisfy the requirements of the<br />
investigating authorities so their capacity won't be diminished<br />
and the rights of individuals.<br />
WALSH: Okay, well we'll take a break there.<br />
COMMERCIAL BREAK<br />
WALSH: I keep bringing up Andrew's name butjl did ask him<br />
yesterday would he like to ask you a question because Parliament<br />
isn't sitting at the moment.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He hasn't asked me one when they are sitting so<br />
he may as well do it when it's not.<br />
WALSH: Alright, well I've got the tape here so Andrew can ask it<br />
himself. GRAB OF TAPE OF YESTERDAY'S INTERVIEW<br />
WALSH: Well now Mr. Hawke will be on the program tomorrow, is<br />
there any question you'd like me to ask him for you?<br />
PEACOCK: Yes, a whole schedule of them Michael.<br />
WALSH: No, you've got one. I'll ask the others.<br />
PEACOCK: I've got one?<br />
V/ ALSH: Yes.<br />
PEACOCK: Why does he want an early election?<br />
BACK TO INTERVIEL1 VITH PRIMAE MINISTER<br />
PRI! 4E MINISTER: Well the answer is very, very simplq; because I<br />
want to save the Australian people from the insanities which were<br />
inflicted upon them by his Goverrment. What happened is that<br />
by calling that early election in Iarch.<br />
W7ALSH: But Malcolm Fraser did.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well Mr. Peacock aas part of the Government. One<br />
assumes he was told occasionally what his Government did. There<br />
the whole question of elections of the Senate and the House of<br />
nepresentatives were put out of kilter.<br />
W7ALSH: Oh right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now it , i: eans under the Constitution of Australia<br />
there must be an election for half the Senate by, as we're told by<br />
the Electoral Commission, by about April of next year. So there .1 /' 7<br />
, asou', ' HEM MIKE WALSH SHOWPage 6 </p>
<p>age ag<br />
with the changeover, they had ho problems, and in fact they were<br />
looking forward with great anticipation to the massive job ahead<br />
of them". So the point I'm making is that here are these three<br />
men of integrity saying and I had them in my office I said<br />
to Mr. Justice Stewart is there any more, anything else, you<br />
want my Government to do for the National Crimes Authority to<br />
equip you to do your task. I said " You are satisfied you can do<br />
the task?". He said " Yes". Now why, therefore, do I have any<br />
concern about Mr. Costigan, or the National Crimes Authority? Let<br />
them all say here is the National Crimes Authority saying it's<br />
equipped to do the; task. Would I set up a body that couldn't do<br />
the job?<br />
WALSH: No. That's really the question, isn't it? What about<br />
this are you going to allow for debate on the Report in<br />
Parliament before it goes into recess?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I have said I have answered this in the<br />
Parliament I have said that if we get it and Mr. Costigan has<br />
asked for another extension which I have given him ' til the end of<br />
October now I have said if the Parliament is not sitting I have<br />
said I will'make the full report available to Mr. Peacock. There<br />
will not be any part of that report not fully made available to<br />
the Opposition and I will seek then to make if the Parliament<br />
is not sitting to make it publicly releasable under the<br />
techniques that are available if the Parliament is not sitting.<br />
It may be that we can get it via the Speaker. But there will be<br />
no attempt on our part to bottle up the Costigan Report.<br />
WALSH: The thing is we're getting back to this. defamation not<br />
defamation innuendo and the slanders that are running around<br />
at the moment. If you release a Report like that in its full a!<br />
lot of people who may not deserve it will get their names dragged<br />
in the mud. I mean I was watching the Petrov thing the other night<br />
on Nationwide where they did the very excellent coverage of it, and<br />
you got that Document J that came out and it was just a load of<br />
rubbish absolute rubbish but it did mention a lot of people's<br />
names and besmirch them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Pretty shabby document. It did.<br />
7ALSH: Well is that likely with the Costigan Report?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. you see what's happened with previous Reports,<br />
and I would think it would be the case with Mr. Commissioner Costigan,<br />
that he would recommend to the Government that names not be<br />
published. Because you see this has happened before.<br />
WALSH: Yes but everyone is filling in the blanks as it is, aren't<br />
they? PRIhE IIINISTER: Well, yes, and that technique I believe is<br />
UcCarthyist. I mean however deep one's feelings are, and no one has<br />
deeper feelings on this matter than I do, you still have to give to<br />
people individuals the rights of fair trial, and that's why<br />
where previous reports have been given to governments actual names<br />
are excluded. This is not only the protection of the individual<br />
but it's the protection of the authority that's going to subsequently<br />
pursue the investigations because their capacity to pursue their<br />
investigations is limited if names are put out in advance. </p>
<p>sAb&amp;. i<br />
has got . to be an election in Australia by April of next year for<br />
half the Senate. Then if we didn't have the Houseof Representatives<br />
with the half Senate you'd have to have an election for the House<br />
of Representatives about the end of next year. So what I'm<br />
going to do is to have an election early for both the House of<br />
Representatives and the half Senate, and at the same time I'll be<br />
putting a referendum to the people of Australia saying now change<br />
the Constitution so that in future the elections must be simultaneous<br />
so we can't have this business of unnecessary elections being<br />
imposed by the Parliament. So that if we have this election now<br />
early for the House of Representatives and the half Senate and<br />
then we won't have to have another unnecessary election and I<br />
believe the people will support the simultaneous election and then<br />
never again will a Prime Minister be able to play around with this<br />
election timetable.<br />
WALSH: Do you want to take the opportunity today to announce the<br />
election date? I'll extend you this unique and rare privilege.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( laughs) Mike I love you dearly, I'd love to<br />
give you a scoop.<br />
WALSH: Yes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WALSH: ( laughs) Still it was a good old Irish try though, wasn't<br />
it? Now there is one thing I'd like you to explain your position<br />
on because it is one that concerns me and that's the assets test.<br />
Now Andrew yesterday I'm sorry that name comes up again but he is<br />
Leader of the Opposition he said that this assets test is going<br />
to cost the Government $ 55 million and in fact, you know, if you'<br />
just gave $ 55 million away to each pensioner they'd get 350 a week.<br />
Now you know, what is the point of the assets test? Is it to save<br />
money? PRIME MINISTER: The point of the assets test is this, and I have<br />
explained it very carefully and I had long discussions with<br />
pensioner groups and I think overwhelmingly they understand it, it<br />
is that<br />
VALSH: Well with all due respect I don't think they do. I think<br />
it's been it's a bit too complicated.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well of course there are people who don't understand<br />
all the fine details but the essential point is this: this<br />
Australian population is aging und any Government is going to have<br />
an increasing burden upon it that means the taxpayers to sustain<br />
the elderly who have made their contribution to the society and<br />
who deserve the support of the people in their latter years. Now<br />
what has been recognised is that it makes sense not to pay a pension<br />
to everyone to the multimillionaire with assets. It is just<br />
stupid. Take a person like myself: by the time I retire I would<br />
be in a pension, and I would be covered by a Parliamentary pension,<br />
but I'm saying someone like myself<br />
VASLH: If you were a businessmen earning that sort of money, ye; 3.<br />
/ 8<br />
c u--r~ i </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: The asset rich and income rich now it's not right<br />
that people like that, and very, very wealthy people, should be<br />
paid out pensions which mean that the great majority who are in<br />
need will have less available to them. Now that's not just my view.<br />
It was a view that was put by this gentleman you talk about,<br />
Mr. Peacock, in September ' 81 when he was on the Backbench in<br />
Opposition. He made a speech and then one at the Press Club in<br />
which he made exactly the same point. He said that social welfare<br />
payments should be means tested. Now he said it. John Howard,<br />
the Shadow Treasurer, completely supports the concept of an assets<br />
test. Senator Chaney, when he was the shadow spokesman in the<br />
Senate. Mr. John Eliot, one of the pretenders to the Peacock throne,<br />
if I could put it that way, outside the Parliament and a leading<br />
figure of the Liberal Party, has made it quite clear that he<br />
supports it. Mr. Alexander Downer who is a speechwriter and an<br />
assistant to Mr. Peacock and an endorsed Liberal candidate<br />
recently came out and congratulated the Government for its decision,<br />
In other words there is an understanding right across the political<br />
spectrum that if we're going to help the great majority who need<br />
help then don't let's waste resources on the very wealthy minority.<br />
Now, what are the statistics? The statistics are these: that out<br />
of the whole pensioner group it's estimated that only about 2%<br />
will be affected.<br />
:. ALSH: Yes, and that doesn't mean totally affected<br />
like tney get nothing there'll be those who would still get<br />
something. PRIME MINISTER: There will be some who get something. Now I just<br />
believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians believe<br />
that that's fair. We ought to look after the people who need it<br />
and that's not just people on high level income. People are going<br />
to be able to have a very high level of assets as you appreciate.<br />
You know the statistics their home and you know 100,000 other<br />
assets. Now this is going to mean that the groat majority of<br />
people aren't going to be adversely affected but any Government<br />
in the future is going to have that much more money available<br />
from what they've saved to give to that 98% who really do need help.<br />
WALSH: I think what's freaking people out more than anything else<br />
is the form that's coming out. Now as I hoar it it is about a<br />
four-page form and an eight-page explanation to go with it<br />
for God's sake that's really Government gobbledy-gook there.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No it's not, there's been a great deal of<br />
misrepresentation. 85% approximately that's the best information<br />
we've got wont. t need to fill in that form bacause it will be<br />
perfectly clear that they are not caught.<br />
? WALSH: What like you get to question 2 and then you realise you<br />
don't have to go any further?<br />
PRIMIE MINISTER: Yes. It's a self-assessment thing. Once it's<br />
quite clear to you that you're not covered by the level of assets<br />
you've got you don't have to fill in that form. The greatly<br />
overwhelming majority of people are not going to have to fill in<br />
that form.<br />
WALSH: Well it's been lovely to have you with us and thanks for<br />
giving us the time. ooo0ooo<br />
