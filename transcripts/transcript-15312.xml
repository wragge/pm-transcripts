<p>Thank you very much Julie, ladies and gentlemen.  I am quite delighted that all of you have joined me for the presentation of the inaugural Prime Minister's Prize for Australian history. </p>
<p>I announced this prize at the National History Summit in August of last year and it's designed to recognise an outstanding piece of work published, produced or broadcast between the 20th September 2004 and 31st December 2006, and which contributes significantly to an understanding of Australian history.  </p>

<p>All our public debates have a history.  All reflect the social, economic and political forces that have brought Australia to this point over a long period of time.</p>
<p>The very essence of active citizenship in a democracy rests on a sense of a common national journey.  Without a shared knowledge of the national story, we risk hollowing out the very foundations of citizenship based on feelings of nationhood.</p>
<p>Ironically enough it was the great philosopher of liberal individualism, John Stuart Mill, who articulated in his own time the power and importance of national history to feelings of nationhood.</p>
<p>Such feelings, he noted, can be generated by various causes - religion, language, race and geography among them.  But, he argued, the strongest of all is </p>
