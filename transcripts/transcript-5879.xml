ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The backdown of the Cain Labor Government on probate in<br />
Victoria is yet another example of the confusion that follows<br />
Labor Governments as their doctrinaire policies come face to<br />
face with outraged comamonsense. The determination of the<br />
Cain Government to re-impose probate on Victorians when the<br />
rest of Australia had seen the great practical. difficulties<br />
of the tax, and the damage it would do, shows very plainly indeed<br />
the influence of doctrinaire ideology on Labor's thinking.<br />
The Cain Government's proposal was always unrealistic. It was<br />
poorly thought out and unsoundly based. It was plain from the<br />
outset that Victoria's economy would be damaged by Mr Cain's<br />
proposal, that investment in Victoria would dry LIP, that businesses<br />
would leave, that house prices would fall. The Cain Government<br />
was so blinded by its ideology that it kept insisting the tax would<br />
only affect some 4% of estates, when the ' obvious reality was<br />
that the tax would affect all Victorians, through its disastrous<br />
impact on small business, on jobs, opportunities and confidence.<br />
The Cain Government, by creating uncertainty anid instability, is<br />
another example of the disaster of Labor Governm~ ent in office.<br />
Victorians are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that the<br />
Cain Government is highly ideological and deeply influenced<br />
by the extreme Left wing unions affiliated with the Labor Party.<br />
It is the Cain Government, which has increasingly attacked our<br />
principal ally, the United States, as it attempts to carry out the<br />
ordinary and proper activities of an ally in visits to<br />
Australian ports. Despite Mr Cain's assurances that he has<br />
no intention to intrude into the Federal Government's<br />
responsibilities for defence and foreign affairs", he has sought<br />
unceasingly to interfere in the diplomacy of Australia's<br />
relations with the United States. Only last Wednesday, Mr Cain<br />
tried to lecture the acting United States Cornsul.-General<br />
on the Labor Party's ideology.<br />
The infection of the Labor Party with an unwillingness to work<br />
closely with our major ally is equally clear in the Federal<br />
Party. Mr Hayden's vacillation on the Party's attitude<br />
to visits by American ships, and his North-West Cape policy,<br />
which would lead to shutting down of this base, has been<br />
amplified this week by Mr Bocwen's proposa" Es for a nuclearfree<br />
southern hemisphere which would prevent our major ally<br />
from operating effectively anywhere near our shores. What / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
confidence can Australians have in a Party which has a large<br />
and influential group of members who actually oppose our<br />
principal defence alliance?<br />
We see the influence of extremists on Labor policy in case after<br />
case. We see it in M4r Cain's sympathy for the BLF in his response<br />
to the Royal Commission's Report, and in his opposition to the<br />
deregistration of the BLF. We see it in Mr Wran's willingness<br />
to circumvent his own Government's Industrial Arbitration Act<br />
by granting shorter working hours to power workers in 1979, and<br />
in the massive wage rises he has allowed in areas affecting<br />
the power industry. These actions were significant steps<br />
towards the bankrupting of NSW by the Wran Labor Government.<br />
The story is the same whenever Labor is in office. They<br />
bankrupted Tasmania and they very nearly bankrupted Austalia<br />
when they held Goverr-ment in Canberra. This is plain from the<br />
policies Labor adopted at its recent conference.<br />
Asaresult of that conference, Labor is committed to policies<br />
which would greatly damage private enterprise and the achievement<br />
of economic progress in Australia. Labor is com-mitted<br />
to a most radical and far-reaching program to increase the<br />
power and privileges of the trade unions of this country,<br />
regardless of the effect on the rest of Australians. Their<br />
proposal for a resource rent tax, especially at a time of real<br />
difficulty for the miners can only damage investment in this<br />
vital industry. They want to shut down the uranium industry,<br />
and their policy nowhere states that existing contracts can<br />
be worked out.<br />
The policies and actions of the divided Labor Party must be<br />
of growing concern to all Australians. It is vital that all<br />
Australians come to recognise the true character of the Labor<br />
Party. </p>
