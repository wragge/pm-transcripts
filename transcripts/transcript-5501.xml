FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 25 JANUARY, 1981<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
This Australia Day, I am going to talk about some of the<br />
changes which will be taking place in Australia within the<br />
nexct few years. Changes we have worked to bring about<br />
changes that we can greet with optimism and that will benefit<br />
all the Australian people.<br />
At a time when many countries are facing a difficult futu re,<br />
we can look forward with a sense of expectation and enthusiasm<br />
to the prospects ahead of us.<br />
Great changes are at work in Australia which will affect every<br />
corner of our national life. New technology is already<br />
transforming our lives. The Australian satellite will shortly<br />
bring to outback Australia the kind of communications that<br />
we now take for granted in the capital cities. Such changes<br />
in communications will bring us closer together as a people.<br />
We must look closely at our education system to make sure that<br />
it does its utmost to prepare young people to work with, to<br />
feel at home with, and to benefit from the great innovations<br />
that are taking place6 Already there is widespread concern<br />
that education must do more for young people than is currently<br />
the case. The recent Schools' Commission Report put the problem<br />
bluntly when it said: "... many students experience a curriculum<br />
unsuited to their needs or interests and from which they gain<br />
little of a positive nature..."' Such critici, sm represents a<br />
challenge to all Governments and schools to gete on with doing<br />
a better job.<br />
There will be other changes also. There will be changes in<br />
the role of Government and a growing acceptance that individuals<br />
are the best judges of how they should order their own-lives.<br />
One of the most valued ideals in Australia throughout our<br />
history, has been that each individual matters. In the years<br />
ahead we must stand for -that ideal as never before.<br />
Some of the most important changes will come from the<br />
development of our great energy and natural resources. In th~ e<br />
nineteenth century, the gjold rush made possible the first<br />
great period of prosperity and growth in Australia. It was an<br />
age in which Australia became recognised as a land of great<br />
opportunities for everybody. / 2<br />

<p>2-<br />
Today we are not in the midst of a gold rush but rather<br />
an energy and resources rush. Mighty energyr and resource<br />
projects are underway. There's the North West Shelf<br />
project to tap natural gas in Western Australia; the<br />
Rundle shale oil project in Queensland; Roxby Downs in<br />
South Australia; and electricity programmes in Queensland,<br />
New South Wales and Victoria which could well exceed the<br />
scope of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.<br />
These developments are taking place in a way which will benefit<br />
not just a few but all Australian families. Towns are being<br />
built; jobs are being created. They will produce increased<br />
wealth which will enable better real wages and salaries; and<br />
improved help to those in need.<br />
I express tonight the firmest possible determination to<br />
see that the prosperity flowing from these great ventures<br />
will lift the living standard of every Australian family,<br />
not just of those immediately involved.<br />
Beyond Australia, what we do with our resources will alsQ<br />
affect the lives of countless people in other countries.*<br />
Autai' energy can be a powerful force for good lifting<br />
the hopes and expectations, improving the lives of people in<br />
other parts of the world who are anxious, even frightened<br />
about the future. Australian energy will be one of the<br />
important forces for helping mankind to a better and more<br />
humane world.<br />
We have been called the lucky country; and we are lucky<br />
that these opportunities are before us, But we have never<br />
as a people relied just on good luck. Australia has grown<br />
as a nation because we have been prepared to work together,<br />
to build a land of which we can be proud not just for our<br />
own sake but for the sake of our children. We will not'buili the<br />
Australia we want on confrontation and division. We will not<br />
build it iftthe selfishness and greed of a few become the<br />
model for many,<br />
A great and significant prospect is in sight because the policies<br />
of freedom that are part of our national heritage encourage<br />
the enterprise and initciative of our people; ' and because<br />
Australians now have the confidence to plan for themselves,<br />
their families for Australia.<br />
Much is within our grasp but we cannot take our future success<br />
for granted. We mu st be prepared to work for our country and<br />
community as well as ourselves. We must recognise that there<br />
are problems, in some areas very substantial ones. For example,<br />
the level of industrial disputes must worry many good trade<br />
unionists as it does other Australians. In areas like this, we<br />
must increasingly resolve to do better, to work together rather<br />
than in opposition. For if we think about it, our interests,<br />
as Australians are not competitive but complementary. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Australia is today like a young person on the threshold<br />
of adulthood, whose limbs are filling out full of hope<br />
and expectation for the future, full of promise and<br />
optimism. I am confident that this promise will. be realised and that<br />
in this new age, the lives of all Australians and of all<br />
Australian families will be improved. It is my determination<br />
to see that this happens. 000---or </p>
