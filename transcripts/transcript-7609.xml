PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FEDERAL CHAMBER OF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES<br />
ANNIVERSARY DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 22 MAY 1989<br />
Ivan Deveson, President,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
At the outset I offer my congratulations to the Federal<br />
Chamber of Automotive Industries as you celebrate your<br />
anniversary. When this Chamber was established in 1939 with the<br />
amalgamation of various independent State Chambers, the<br />
motor vehicle industry was already a significant one for<br />
Australians and for Australia. That importance is much<br />
greater in 1989.<br />
The performance of your industry is a telling indicator of<br />
the health of the whole manufacturing sector.<br />
Your industry is one of Australia's most significant<br />
exporters of manufactured goods, a leading innovator in high<br />
technology and a major employer.<br />
manufacturing and assembly of motor vehicles provides jobs<br />
for some 35,000 people; and the components industry provides<br />
another 25,000 jobs. Then there are the tens of thousands<br />
of jobs in supporting industries such as plastics, steel,<br />
rubber and glass, as well as some 80,000 more in sales,<br />
distribution and servicing.<br />
Such figures alone indicate why ensuring the competitiveness<br />
of the motor vehicle industry in Australia was in 1983 and<br />
remains in 1989 a very high priority of my Government.<br />
In inviting me to speak here tonight, Ivan Deveson reminded<br />
me that I have not met with the Chamber since my first year<br />
as Prime minister in 1983.<br />
At that time, economic policy makers faced two massive<br />
tasks: reversing the recession we inherited, with . its<br />
double digit inflation and unemployment, as well as starting<br />
out on the longer battle of restructuring the fundamentals<br />
of the economy. </p>
<p>The manufacturing sector was in. special need. High<br />
protection and regulation had for decades encouraged<br />
manufacturers to be uncompetitive on the world market and,<br />
accordingly, unresponsive to changing market conditions.<br />
In many ways these general problems were encapsulated, as I<br />
am sure you recall, in the Australian car industry.<br />
For decades before 1983, Australian Governments had tried to<br />
foster a domestic motor vehicle industry in the deep shelter<br />
provided by massive barriers of protection.<br />
In those days, manufacturers would set up a plant in<br />
Australia with little regard for the scale of efficient<br />
operations overseas.<br />
The outcome was as predictable as it was expensive:<br />
Australians found themselves supporting, through tariffs and<br />
prices, a car industry that was fragmented and<br />
uncompetitive. when we came to office we were determined to abandon the<br />
short-sighted interventionist policy-making that had been<br />
the forte of previous Governments.<br />
We wanted to ensure that, through a cooperative effort<br />
involving the Government, employers and unions, the car<br />
industry had the incentive to meet, not ignore, the<br />
challenges of the 1980s and 1990s.<br />
What we sought was a clear commitment from manufacturers and<br />
component suppliers to undertake the investment necessary to<br />
modernise the industry, and a commitment from management and<br />
unions to work constructively together to avoid costly<br />
disputation and to lift productivity.<br />
And in the Car Plan that was developed by my colleague<br />
John Button, we received those commitments.<br />
For our part, the Government overhauled the existing<br />
assistance arrangements and agreed to provide stable levels<br />
of support for a fixed period to allow the industry to find<br />
its feet and to become more self-sufficient and more<br />
competitive. This Car Plan, which in 1984 set the course for your<br />
industry for the eight years through to 1992, was a vital<br />
means to safeguarding a vital industry.<br />
we are now more than half way through the Car Plan, and the<br />
Automotive Industry Authority has just released its report<br />
on the state of the industry at the half way mark.<br />
As you know, it was a report that levels a number of<br />
criticisms at your industry and identified areas for future<br />
challenge. 61) 90) </p>
<p>My view of the Authority's report is that it presents a<br />
constructive and timely assessment of the industry's<br />
progress since 1984.<br />
And I stress the adjective " timely" because the eight year<br />
life span of the Car Plan is long enough to give the car<br />
industry time to adapt to a less protected environment.<br />
In this perspective, I believe there is no problem in the<br />
industry which should be viewed as insurmountable.<br />
So I urge you to take the Authority's criticisms on board.<br />
A great deal of progress has been made, but a good deal<br />
remains to be done to meet the time-table, particularly in<br />
regard to price, productivity and quality.<br />
It was certainly disappointing to read the Authority' s<br />
judgement that the quality of Australian made cars has not<br />
improved significantly over the life of the Plan.<br />
Insufficient quality control can only damage the reputation,<br />
and therefore the sales, of your products, at home and<br />
overseas and that is an outcome that none of us wants to<br />
see. You have a collective responsibility producers, the unions<br />
and component suppliers to secure the industry's future.<br />
Further plant and product rationalisation, and greater<br />
export orientation, should result in increased efficiency<br />
and cost reductions through the operation of economies of<br />
scale and improved capacity utilisation.<br />
I realise I have dwelt so far on the Authority's criticisms.<br />
Let me make it clear the Government fully acknowledges the<br />
considerable achievements that have also been made. Credit<br />
should be given where it is due.<br />
The industry has developed considerably since 1984 when it<br />
was hampered by a policy environment which made it hard for<br />
the industry to chart its future.<br />
Exports have grown by 60 per cent over the first four years<br />
of the Plan and despite recent set-backs the Authority<br />
expects a resumption in growth of exports by 1990.<br />
Investment expenditure in the industry since 1984 has also<br />
been substantial, both by Plan producers and by specialist<br />
component producers. I was pleased to note that the<br />
Authority reports that investment, aimed at upgrading and<br />
enhancing production equipment, is expected to increase<br />
further over the remaining years of the Plan.<br />
The Authority also reports considerable progress in<br />
rationalising the industry through reduced number of<br />
producers and models, and through joint-ventures. This is<br />
expected to ensure production runs of 40,000 vehicles or<br />
more for most models by 1990. The export facilitation<br />
scheme is also helping to increase specialisation in the<br />
component sector. G 99'. </p>
<p>These efforts, if built on rigorously, should contribute to<br />
increased productivity, lower real prices and high quality<br />
cars. This progress has been due, in part, to the improved<br />
industrial relations in the industry, and I pay tribute to<br />
all those responsible for that.<br />
As good as industrial relations have been on the<br />
manuf acturing side of the industry, the same cannot be said<br />
for the components suppliers side.<br />
Let me take this opportunity to comment that in the era of<br />
just-in-time production, the Government can only take a dim<br />
view of the supply unreliability that accompanies such<br />
disputes. it is more galling in view of the components industry's<br />
heavy reliance on local content rules. The Car Plan itself<br />
is progressively bringing pressure to bear on components<br />
suppliers to lift their game. But employers and unionists<br />
are being short-sighted if they see local content rules as a<br />
cushion for their inefficiency or unreliability.<br />
So, where do we go from here?<br />
For our part, the Government remains committed to providing<br />
a stable and predictable environment in which the industry<br />
can make confident decisions about restructuring and<br />
investment. It should not be forgotten however that at the expiry of the<br />
Plan in 1992, relatively high levels of tariff assistance<br />
will still apply 35 per cent, compared with levels of<br />
or 15 per cent for most other areas of manufacturing.<br />
it is important to appreciate that the community at large is<br />
aware of the costs of the high levels of protection afforded<br />
the car industry. You can expect to face continuing public<br />
pressure for competitively priced, quality vehicles. And<br />
there is a growing feeling in the community that the<br />
industry has had time to become internationally competitive.<br />
Clearly towards the end of the Plan the Government will<br />
again need to look at options for post-1992 assistance<br />
arrangements. This is not meant as a threat but as a reminder to the<br />
industry to make the most of the stability offered now by<br />
the Plan, to get on with the task of rationalisation. It<br />
will be easier to do so now than after 1992.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
over the past 20 years a lot of effort, throughout your<br />
industry and in Government, has been directed to the task of<br />
creating a national system of design rules to maintain and<br />
improve the level of safety and emissions of vehicles in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>Despite this effort, uniformity has proved an elusive goal,<br />
and crucial safety and emission questions remain subject to<br />
eight separate sets of State and Territory legislation.<br />
Last year the Interstate Commission concluded that effective<br />
national uniformity could best be achieved by Commonwealth<br />
legislation. This Government as you know has an unparalleled record in<br />
pursuing micro-economic reform, eliminating the bottlenecks<br />
that hamper efficiency and productivity and fostering a more<br />
competitive environment.<br />
This month we are bringing down a number of statements which<br />
take this process further among other elements, a new deal<br />
for scientific and technological research, and a strategy<br />
for reform of the waterfront and coastal shipping.<br />
Federal Cabinet recently tackled the issue of national<br />
automotive design standards, and we have decided to<br />
legislate to introduce national safety and emission<br />
standards applying to all imported and locally manufactured<br />
vehicles. in making this decision, Cabinet was also conscious of the<br />
mounting concern about imports of secondhand motor vehicles<br />
from Japan which do not conform to existing Australian<br />
safety and emission standards. National legislation will<br />
ensure that imported second hand cars are modified to meet<br />
Australian standards and do not jeopardise the safety of<br />
Australian road users.<br />
The advantages of the legislation will be considerable. it:<br />
will: replace eight sets of legislation with one;<br />
encourage production economies in the industry;<br />
enhance export prospects for Australian producers by<br />
facilitating international harmonisation of vehicle<br />
safety requirements; and<br />
ensure a ' level playing field' for Australian producers<br />
and importers of new and second hand cars.<br />
I pay tribute to Bob Brown, the Minister for Land Transport<br />
and Shipping Support, who can take great credit for this<br />
initiative. It is the Government's hope that this<br />
legislation will be introduced and passed in this<br />
parliamentary sittings. I trust the non-Government parties<br />
will co-operate in this important task.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I've addressed a number of issues of specific concern to the<br />
passenger motor vehicle industry tonight but I want to close<br />
on an issue of relevance to all employers and, indeed, ail<br />
Australians. G 1J! </p>
<p>The Australian economy, as we all know, is working at a very<br />
strong level of demand, which is sucking in excessive<br />
imports and requiring a policy of tight money.<br />
Employment growth has been strong and job vacancies are at<br />
high levels.<br />
Capacity utilisation is high and in some industries domestic<br />
demand cannot be met by local production.<br />
These conditions are comparable to the periods of the<br />
1973-74 and 1981-82 wages explosions.<br />
The Government's major short term objective has been to<br />
prevent these pressures leading to another destructive wages<br />
explosion. The wage/ tax/ transfer package in the April Statement has<br />
been successfully designed to avoid a wages blow-out while<br />
providing substantial tax cuts and additional support for<br />
the least well-off members of the Australian community.<br />
Anyone who imagines that the wages outcome we now face in<br />
1989-90 could have been achieved in the absence of the<br />
Accord is, to put it frankly, talking through their hat.<br />
where we have an effective and durable wages policy, a<br />
fiscal policy that has delivered a $ 5.5 billion surplus this<br />
year and will do so again next year, and an appropriately<br />
tight monetary policy, the alternative is nothing but<br />
confusion and instability.<br />
I believe the car industry knows as well as anyone in this<br />
nation that we cannot afford a return to the inefficiency<br />
and uncompetitiveness that characterised earlier years.<br />
So, the Government will continue to take hard economic<br />
decisions. It cannot lose sight of the responsibilities the<br />
Australian people have put upon it. Similarly, industries<br />
such as yours must strive to do their part to help set<br />
Australia on the path of prosperity.<br />
Once again, let me offer my congratulations on your<br />
birthday, and my best wishes for your future.<br />
I J1! </p>
