AT RECEPTION TO DE H-ELD AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />

TO BE CHECKED AGAINSTDELIVERY<br />
NOT TO BE PUBLISHED BEFORE DELIVERY<br />
Mr, Prime Minister, I am delighted to forgive you and your two<br />
Parliamentary colleagues for your charming speeches this<br />
evening. I am also very happy to note that on this occasion<br />
you are all of one mind.<br />
My husband and I are deeply touched by the<br />
warmth and kindness of your welcome. Let me say at once that<br />
we are both delighted to be back in Australia for the<br />
Jubilee celebrations of the Capital City.<br />
As we flew over Canberra this afternoon,<br />
I found it difficult to roalise that all this has grown up in<br />
short years. It is a wonderful achievement and an inspiring<br />
sight to see a great and gracious city taking shape almost<br />
before one's eyes. Even more remarkable and more important is<br />
that the plant of our ancient, free and democratic institutions<br />
has taken root here so firmly and is showing such vigorous<br />
independent growth. The first time I came to Australia everything<br />
w-as new, although not necessarily strange. This time I am<br />
looking forward to an even more interesting visit as I shall<br />
be able to see many familiar places and old friends, I shall<br />
also be able to make comparisons with what I remember of our<br />
last visit and I am quite sure that I shall be greatly impressed<br />
by the many developments and the progress of the last nine<br />
years. In many cases I know what to expect because I follow<br />
events in Australia with much interest and admiration. Most<br />
impressive has been the rapid growth of a distinctive and<br />
independent Australian thought and culture and I am very proud<br />
that this has led Australia to play an increasingly important<br />
part on the world stage.<br />
Perhaps even more significant for Australians<br />
has been the modern pioneering in the far North and North-West.<br />
The partnership of science and engineering with man and nature<br />
is harnessing precious water, coaxing the land into useful<br />
production and building new towns in remote areas. These are<br />
the foundations for what I hope will be thriving and prosperous<br />
communities in the future and I am looking forward to visiting<br />
some of those areas with great interest,<br />
I do not intend that this should be my last<br />
visit to Australia and next time I hope I shall see different<br />
places and many communities that could not be included this<br />
time. Tonight, on my arrival, I want to send greetings to all<br />
Australians and particularly to those we shall not be able to<br />
see on this occasion. Thank you again Mr. Prime Minister, Mr.<br />
McEwen and Mr. Calwell for your kind words this evening.<br />
I pray that Australia will continue to prosper in a happy and<br />
peaceful future, </p>
