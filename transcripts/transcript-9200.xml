PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING, MP<br />
INDUSTRY COMMISSION REPORT INTO WORKERS' COMPENSATION<br />
The Commonwealth Government today released the Report of the Industry<br />
Commission into Workers' Compensation in Australia.<br />
In the report the Industry Commission has highlighted the economic and social<br />
importance of workers' compensation and has identified deficiencies in current<br />
arrangements which warranted careful consideration by Commonwealth, State and<br />
Territory Governments.<br />
Each year around 500 people die and 200,000 are injured in workplace accidents in<br />
Australia. It is claimed that a further 20,000 cases of occupational disease go<br />
,-nrecognised. Workers' compensation premiums account for about 17% of nonwage<br />
labour costs.<br />
There are ten main workers' compensation schemes in Australia, one in each State<br />
and Territory and two under Commonwealth legislation. The Commission found that<br />
significant differences exist among schemes in relation to their administration,<br />
insurance arrangements, benefit levels/ structures, dispute resolution procedures<br />
and rehabilitation and return to work strategies and programs.<br />
The Industry Commission findings show that<br />
the costsrising from work-related injury and illness to individuals, to firms<br />
and to the community are large. The cost to Australia is estimated to be at<br />
least $ 10 billion each year;<br />
costs are shifted ( both ways) between workers' compensation schemes and<br />
government programs often to the detriment of both;<br />
the existing multiplicity of workers' compensation arrangements results in<br />
inequity ( eg different benefit structures and entitlements) and inefficiency ( eg<br />
national employers and their employees must cope with different rules in each<br />
jurisdiction); and<br />
better standards of service by insurers to injured workers and to employers<br />
would help improve attitudes to good health and safety practice and, by </p>
<p>facilitating co-operative employee-employer relationships, help achieve good<br />
return to work rates.<br />
The Commission said, " the very scale of the problems in terms of people affected<br />
and costs involved demands attention and emphasises why they should be<br />
addressed as a matter of urgency".<br />
The impact of actions by governments to influence the location decisions of<br />
businesses by creating low benefit, low cost workers' compensation schemes was<br />
also referred to by the Commission, which concluded that such schemes were<br />
generally being paid for by other firms or taxpayers.<br />
The Commission also concluded that competition at this level was unhealthy as it<br />
eroded both benefits and incentives to reduce the cost of work related injury and<br />
disease, and called for healthy competition which would lead to best practice in<br />
prevention, rehabilitation and claims management.<br />
The Commission's preferred approach involves:<br />
putting in place agreed national benefits and supporting arrangements to limit<br />
the extent of cost-shifting onto injured and ill workers and the community; while<br />
at the same time<br />
encouraging greater competition in the provision of insurance ( and other<br />
services aimed at effective prevention and rehabilitation).<br />
The Commission has recommended wide ranging changes in relation to prevention,<br />
rehabilitation, compensation and licensing and prudential arrangements. In<br />
particular, it has highlighted that an effectively structured compensation benefits<br />
package combined with performance based premium systems, will create incentives<br />
for employers and employees to reduce the incidence and costs of claims and that a<br />
nationally consistent approach to these and associated administrative arrangements<br />
will address equity, efficiency and cost sharing issues.<br />
The government acknowledges there is room for substantial improvement in<br />
Australia's workers' compensation arrangements and generally endorses the<br />
directions for reform contained in the Commission's recommendations. However,<br />
very careful consideration must be given to the design of any new, uniform, benefits<br />
structure to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved between the needs of<br />
injured workers, the incentives for employers to maintain safety as well as the<br />
implications for labour costs and employment. In this context, I note the<br />
Commission's illustrative benefits structure which would create greater incentives to<br />
reduce the costs of workpla ce injury -and illness but also involve at least a short term<br />
increase in premium levels.<br />
Consistent with the usual timetable for handling Industry Commission reports, the<br />
Government will provide a detailed response to this report no later than August, with<br />
a view to co-operatively developing a strategy for reform with the States and<br />
Territories. </p>
<p>3<br />
The next meeting of the, Labour Ministers Council in May would provide an early<br />
opportunity for the States and Territories to provide initial comments on the Industry<br />
Commission report.<br />
