FOR MEDIA15 JANUARY 1987<br />
Having met Eir Warwick Fairfax on several occasions over the<br />
years I have Ceveloped a considerable respect for his commitment<br />
to Australia.<br />
He made a major contribution to the development of the Australian<br />
media, although his interests have been much more wide-ranging<br />
than that,<br />
I pay tribute to his contribution over many years, and extend my<br />
sincere condolences to Lady Mary and his family.<br />
