Although phosphate remains the most significant bilateral<br />
link between Australia and Nauru, further economic bonds<br />
were evolving.<br />
An outstanding example of this was the multi-storey Nauru<br />
House in Melbourne which was expected to be opened early in<br />
1977.<br />
Australia and Nauru have many interests in common, especially<br />
matters which arose out of membership of such major organisations<br />
