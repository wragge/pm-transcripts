    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is Ted Evans' last day as Secretary to the Treasury. I wish to record the Government's deep appreciation of Ted's efforts as Secretary to the Treasury and his important contribution to economic policy formulation over the last three decades.</p>
<p>Ted joined the Treasury in 1968 after having worked his way through the former Post Master General's Department. He undertook tertiary studies in economics while working as a PMG linesman.</p>
<p>Since joining the Treasury, Ted has made contributions across all facets of Treasury work. He supported measures to open up the Australian economy, including the floating of the exchange rate. He was also a strong proponent of tax reform, being involved in the formulation of the former Government's tax reform proposals in the mid 1980s and, more successfully, with the introduction of the new tax system last year.</p>
<p>Ted has also played a significant role in the formulation of macro-economic policy, in particular the major fiscal consolidation undertaken by the Government in 1996 and 1997. He has been a leading contributor to public debate, particularly issues of structural reform, such as the functioning of the labour market. He highlighted the importance of labour market reform in improving economic growth and productivity, with flow on benefits to real wages and living standards.</p>
<p>Ted will be forever associated with that memorable phrase, "in one sense, we can choose the level of unemployment which we are willing to bear" when discussing economic and social constraints on reducing unemployment.</p>
<p>He also represented Australia at the OECD in the 1970s and at the IMF in the early 1990s. His experience in international economic policy was particularly valuable during the Asian economic crisis and the Prime Minister's Task Force on international financial issues, which was set up in response to that crisis.</p>
<p>Ted has always met the highest standards of professionalism and integrity in his dealings with the Government. He has been forthright and unwaveringly apolitical in his advice, earning the respect of Prime Ministers and Treasurers on all sides of politics.</p>
<p>I wish him and his wife Judith the very best in what I hope would be a long and productive retirement.</p>
<p>26 April 2001</p>
