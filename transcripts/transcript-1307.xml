A DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFARS.<br />
CANBERRA.<br />
FOR THE PRESS<br />
( Released only in Canberra) PR4 29th April, 1966.<br />
SURGICAL TEAM NUIRSES IN VIET NAML<br />
The Minister for External Affairs, Mr Hasluck, today issued<br />
the following statement about arrangements being made for the departure<br />
of four nurses from the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne to join the<br />
Australian Suirgical Team at Bien Hoa in Viet Nam.<br />
" On 31st December, 1965, I announced the departure<br />
for Viet Nam of a nine-member surgical team sponsored by<br />
the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne. This is the second<br />
Australian Surgical Team to be established in Viet Ham<br />
under our SEATO Aid Programme. The first team which<br />
was from the Royal Melbourne Hospital was based at Long<br />
Xuyen some 80 miles south-west of Saigon and was succeeded<br />
last October by a team from St. Vincent's Hospital,<br />
Melbourne. Four nurses will be leaving on Sunday, 1st May<br />
( flight BA725) to Join the Bien Hoa team. They are<br />
Miss Miriam Steer, Miss Rosalie Moy, Miss Josephine<br />
Champion, and Miss Carolyn Milne. The nurses are taking<br />
the place of the four nurses who were original members<br />
of the first' Alfred Hospital Surgical Team, Miss Mary Rigg,<br />
Miss Heather Beveridge, Miss Daphne Amos, and Miss Barbara<br />
Phillips, who are returning to Australia, after four months<br />
in Viet Ham, on 11th May ( flight BA712). The other girl<br />
serving with the team, Miss Kathleen Hirst, the<br />
radiographer, has volunteered to stay at Bien Hoa for<br />
a second term.<br />
The Surgical Team at Bien Hoa, which has a population<br />
of 70,000 and attracts patients from the surrounding areas,<br />
many of whom are civilian war casualties, is meeting an<br />
acute need for trained surgical personnel in Viet Nam and<br />
we are glad to be in a position under our SEATO Aid arrangements<br />
to be able to help the people of the Bien Hoa Province in<br />
this way. I wish to thank the authorities and the surgeons,<br />
doctors and nurses of the Alfred Hospital for the willingness<br />
with which they have made their services available to make<br />
this contribution to the well-being of the Vietnamese peoplefif </p>
