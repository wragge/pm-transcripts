<p>High speed internet or broadband is a key business, education and community driver. It opens up new opportunities in households, workplaces, small businesses, libraries, schools and universities.</p>
<p>The Government has already invested close to $4 billion to provide broadband and other critical telecommunications services to regional and outer metropolitan Australia.</p>
<p>This has helped keep the price of high-speed internet access down with Australians benefiting from some of lowest priced ADSL broadband and best (per megabit) value in the world.</p>
<p>The next chapter in the nation's broadband story will be unveiled later today when my Government announces an innovative plan to provide access to fast broadband for 99 per cent of the Australian population.</p>
<p>The plan will deliver a state-of-the-art broadband network, with coverage for rural and regional areas at metropolitan-comparable prices.</p>
<p>One of the important features of our plan is that it caters for future developments, providing scope for faster speeds when new technologies come on line.</p>
<p>It is clear consumers are looking to access broadband at a price they can afford and using a technology that adapts to their individual and changing needs.</p>
<p>My Government's broadband blueprint follows comprehensive negotiations with industry that started last year involving Communications Minister Helen Coonan.  </p>
<p>Unlike Labor's cobbled-together plan, my Government's roll-out will be delivered without recklessly spending the $2 billion regional communications fund or raiding the superannuation of our defence and police personnel.</p>
<p>Importantly, it will help keep our economy strong by investing in infrastructure for the future.</p>
