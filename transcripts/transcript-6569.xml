ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 DECEMBER 1984<br />
As one of its first priorities, the Government has been<br />
considering the final report of the Costigan Royal<br />
Commission along with advice from officials on every<br />
recommendation made in that report.<br />
Report Passed to National Crime Authority and other<br />
Agencies The majority of the report's recommendations called for<br />
further investigations. There had been swift action by the<br />
Government to ensure that copies of the full report were<br />
passed, as soon as they were received, to the relevant<br />
agencies particularly the National Crime Authority and<br />
also the Australian Federal Police and the Director of<br />
Public Prosecutions in order that they could take<br />
appropriate action. The Government has now been advised of<br />
the action which these agencies have taken on these<br />
matters. The Government has previously indicated it is looking to<br />
the National Crime Authority to have the primary<br />
responsibility for decisions on pursuing the outstanding<br />
Costigan inquiries. Consistent with this approach, the<br />
Commonwealth's position is not to accept Mr Costigan's<br />
recommendation that a further Royal Commission should be<br />
set up in relation to matters arising out of Volume 7 of </p>
<p>the report. The Authority has sought and has been granted<br />
a reference by the Commonwealth on these matters, and the<br />
Government is satisfied that the Authority will be able to<br />
pursue effectively the necessary investigations.<br />
Action by National Crime Authority<br />
The National Crime Authority is giving attention using its<br />
general powers to the other matters in the report which Mr<br />
Costigan believes warrant further work. In respect of some<br />
of them, it has sought and been granted by the Inter-<br />
Governmental Committee of the Authority references which<br />
will enable it to exercise coercive powers. As well, the<br />
Chairman of the Authority, Mr Justice Stewart, announced at<br />
the Authority's first public sitting on 13 December, the<br />
general nature of the action which would be taken on the<br />
forty-two codenamed cases from the Costigan Commission.<br />
Legislative and other Policy Changes<br />
The report also made recommendations for legislative and<br />
other policy changes. Although the Government had not been<br />
able to take action during the caretaker pre-election<br />
period, proposals for further action on these<br />
recommendations have now been agreed.<br />
Major recommendations involved proposals for a Taxation<br />
Investigation Tribunal, a Special Tax Investigator and a<br />
Port Security Authority. Ministers have been asked to<br />
bring forward submissions on these recommendations.<br />
Recommendations having implications jointly for the States<br />
and the Commonwealth will be processed in conjunction with<br />
the States, including through the relevant Ministerial<br />
councils. Recommendations dealing with more detailed<br />
matters are being studied by the relevant departments and<br />
law enforcement agencies. Final action has been taken on<br />
some while others will be dealt with by submissions which<br />
will be coming forward for Government consideration. </p>
<p>3.<br />
The Government also reviewed action on those<br />
recommendations from previous reports where consideration<br />
was yet to be finalised. It has called for submissions to<br />
be brought forward in the new year.<br />
Costigan Recommendations on National Crime Authority Act<br />
The Government has examined the recommendations made by<br />
Mr Costigan concerning the National Crime Authority Act.<br />
Mr Costigan's major recommendation for amending the Act was<br />
to remove the need for the Authority to seek references<br />
from the Inter-Governmental Committee. The legislation has<br />
been deliberately structured so that coercive powers can<br />
only be exercised on matters referred to the Authority by<br />
the Inter-Governmental Committee. The Government believes<br />
that this requirement strikes the right balance between the<br />
independence and accountability of the Authority and also<br />
provides for the essential involvement of the States.<br />
The Government's position is that the National Crime<br />
Authority should be given a fair trial under its existing<br />
legislation. This can then be reviewed if, after a<br />
suitable period, it seems that amendments might be<br />
desirable. A mandatory review within five years will be<br />
necessitated by the sunset provision of the legislation.<br />
However, the Government has made clear there will be a<br />
swift and sympathetic response if the National Crime<br />
Authority indicates that the powers it has under its Act<br />
are inadequate for it to perform its important work.<br />
Public Naming of Suspects<br />
The Government has noted the wide range of views and<br />
concerns which have been expressed about the approach taken<br />
by the Costigan Royal Commission in its final report; a<br />
similarly wide range of views was expressed in the National<br />
Crimes Commission conference held in July 1983, and in<br />
subsequent debate about the National Crime Authority<br />
legislation. </p>
<p>The Government remains completely committed to the fight<br />
against organised crime. But it believes this fight can<br />
and must be waged without encroaching on fundamental civil<br />
rights. Tha Government specifically reaffirms that it rejects as a<br />
means of combatting criminal activity the policy favoured<br />
by Mr Costigan of public exposure of persons suspected of<br />
criminal activities. There is no place in our legal system<br />
for guilt by accusation or denunciation.<br />
Action on the recommendations of the Costigan Royal<br />
Commission is accordingly in hand. The Special Minister of<br />
State will issue on behalf of the Government a detailed<br />
response on the recommendations during the forthcoming<br />
Autumn Sittings of the Parliament. </p>
