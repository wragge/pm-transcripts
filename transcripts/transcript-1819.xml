FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 42/ 1968<br />
PRESIDENT JOHNSON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I do not think it proper to comment on the decision<br />
taken by President Johnson not to seek re-election, other<br />
than to say that we in Australia will always remember with<br />
gratitude the warmth and special consideration which he has<br />
shown to us during his Presidency.<br />
He has had to bear immense burdens and make momentous<br />
decisions and carry the responsibility for those decisions<br />
and I believe he has made them on the basis of what he sincerely<br />
believed to be right, and to the ultimate benefit of freedom<br />
inside the United States and outside that country. He is a<br />
great man.<br />
