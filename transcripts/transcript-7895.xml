PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, FEDERATED IRONWORKERS'<br />
ASSOC IATION NEWCASTLE, 12 FEBRUARY1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when will the election be?<br />
PM: I'd like to be able to break the news here, but I don't<br />
G&amp; know yet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, we've heard from Melbourne that the<br />
result of the pilots case is some $ 6 million, I believe.<br />
What's your reaction to the amount?<br />
PM: Well, it was just a matter of decision by the court<br />
as to how many days were involved. They had agreed, between<br />
the two parties, as to what the amount today would be, so<br />
that's Just a judicial decision as to the number of days<br />
that were involved.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed by the amount, given that<br />
you urged the airlines not to proceed with the damages case?<br />
PM: Well, that's a finding of the judge now as to what the<br />
damages should be now. As to what will happen after that<br />
will be a matter for decision by the airlines. I've got<br />
no reason to change what I've said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr McCarthy said that would have to sell<br />
their homes to pay for that. How do you feel about that?<br />
PM: Well, I don't want to see individuals suffer. It's<br />
a pity that Mr McCarthy and those officials hadn't thought<br />
about the suffering that they've inflicted on so many people,<br />
including their own members. But, as I said, on the question<br />
of damages, I've made my position clear about that that<br />
I don't want to see damages against people however stupidly<br />
they have acted, but I've got nothing to add to what I've<br />
said about that before. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is there anything you can do about that Sir?<br />
PM: Well, not publicly at this stage. I've made my position<br />
known and we'll see what happens I mean, I really haven't<br />
got anything useful to add on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, with the release of Mr Mandela,<br />
would you favour a relaxing of sanctions against South Africa?<br />
PM: I've made my position quite clear on that and let me<br />
say it again. Firstly, I welcome the decisions that have<br />
been taken by the Government of South Africa the ones that<br />
preceeded the release of Mr Mandela and his release. Now,<br />
what I've said is that those decisions create the stage for<br />
negotiations. Apartheid is still in place and it is a<br />
vicious, abhorrent, totally unacceptable system and it is<br />
still in place. I have said that we should be prepared to<br />
indicate that we will look at the lifting of sanctions if,<br />
having created that stage they now go on with the stage and<br />
actually enter meaningful negotiations between the Government<br />
of South Africa and the representatives of the black people,<br />
and if it is seen that those negotiations are taking place<br />
and are leading towards the objective, the common objective<br />
of a democratic multi-racial South Africa, free of the<br />
practice, philosophy of apartheid, then of course we should<br />
be prepared to lift sanctions and I trust that that stage<br />
will be reached where they will enter into negotiations.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just a minute, one here.<br />
JOURNALIST: Several times today earlier you were urged to<br />
help a c~ ity which has been cracked down the middle by an<br />
earthquake and has has been severely battered around-in<br />
recent years, to push for the establishment of a Taiwanesebacked<br />
steel works in the midst which could produce thousands<br />
of jobs. You were also urged, if you were returned to power,<br />
to try and influence the Liberal Government in New South<br />
Wales to overcome its apparent disincentive to try and help<br />
business along, how do you feel about that request which<br />
was put to you today?<br />
PM: We've made it quite clear, not just by words but by<br />
action. We've moved to bring in the legislation which would<br />
remove any impediment to that because there was some concern<br />
that because there was not a recognition of Taiwan that that<br />
would create commercial difficulties. Now we've brought<br />
in legislation to remove that concern, so we've put our<br />
actions where the mouths of other people are. </p>
<p>-3<br />
( PM cont): So we are commnitted to helping and I think now<br />
that you've got that legislation indicated by the Government<br />
and you've got the indication of the commitment of the working<br />
people of this region, the trade union movement and our<br />
commitment, in the best possible environment has been created.<br />
I understand there's some developments within Taiwan that<br />
they may not be as close now to making a decision, as has<br />
been contemplated before, but if they are going to move<br />
offshore in any way, Australia in general and Newcastle in<br />
particular, is where they should come.<br />
JOURNALIST: How would you feel about working closely with<br />
a Liberal State Government?<br />
PM: I don't have any problems working with them. I mean,<br />
after all look at the question of the disaster at the end<br />
of last year. I immediately saw Mr Greiner and I suggested<br />
to him that we should just scrub all the red that's usually<br />
associated with these sorts of things in setting up the<br />
national disaster relief arrangements let's scrub that,<br />
let's agree now that we'll share dollar for dollar the costs<br />
and we agreed. So I've shown that I don't have any trouble<br />
working with Liberal Governments. I mean, I'd prefer that<br />
they were Labor Governments that I had to deal with, but<br />
they're the democratically elected Government and when you<br />
have a thing like the earthquake, politics get put aside.<br />
You've got to concern yourself with the needs of people and<br />
act accordingly. One over here?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes. Prime Minister, further on the election<br />
date.. PM: Nothing further on any specific date.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what about the sitting of Parliament. Can<br />
you confirm that that will or will not go ahead?<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add to what I said yesterday on<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you rule out March-<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add to what I said yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: But apparently you did rule it out this morning<br />
though. </p>
<p>4<br />
PM: I haven't been talking to anyone this morning. I looked<br />
at myself in the mirror, cleaned my teeth, had a shower,<br />
but I haven't been talking to any media, so I've neither<br />
ruled it in or out this morning. I mean, I don't talk to<br />
myself about election dates talk to a lot of other people,<br />
but not to myself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the question of<br />
elections and industrial relations, you referred in your<br />
speech here to the creation by unions of single bargaining<br />
How important is that in your strategy?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's obviously, as we see the evolution<br />
of a degree of enterprise bargaining within the framework<br />
of it allows a aggregate national of outcome to be<br />
predicted, that at those levels there should be a combination<br />
of the unions into a unit because it makes it more, not just<br />
easier, but it makes the laying down of a framework for future<br />
industrial relations within the enterprise easier.<br />
ends </p>
