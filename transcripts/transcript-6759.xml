FOR MEDIA 10 OCTOBER 1985<br />
The United States will participate in Expo 88 in Brisbane.<br />
Following my discussions with President Reagan in Washington<br />
in February, I have received advice from Mr Charles Z. Wick,<br />
Director of the US Information Agency, of official acceptance<br />
of Australia's invitation to take part.<br />
Mr Wick, who discussed Expo 88 and the Bicentenary with me in<br />
Canberra in August, has now informed me that the US Congress<br />
has allocated $ US2.6m as an initial contribution to United<br />
States participation in Expo 88.<br />
I very much * welcome this advice. United States participation<br />
in Expo 88 will be a highlight of Australia's bicentennial<br />
celebrations. The extensive participation by ovetseas nations in the<br />
Bicentenary, including their participation in Expo 88, will<br />
help to make 1988 a truly memorable year for Australia.<br />
The theme of Expo 88 is " Leisure in the Age of Technology".<br />
It will be staged under the auspices of the Bureau<br />
Internationale des Expositions in Brisbane from 30 April to<br />
October 1988.<br />
Australia has participated in all three expositions held in<br />
the United States in recent times: Spokante in 1974,<br />
Knoxville in 1982 and New Orleans in 1984. </p>
