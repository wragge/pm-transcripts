PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
RELEASE OF BURGESS REPORT<br />
I welcome the release of the report of the Burgess Review of the<br />
Commonwealth's Enterprise Improvement Programs.<br />
I would like to take the opportunity to thank Mr lan Burgess for preparing a<br />
comprehensive and authoritative analysis of the many complex issues<br />
surrounding these programs.<br />
The Government was fortunate to be able to secure the services of<br />
Mr Burgess, a prominent private sector businessman and chair of the AMP<br />
Society, to lead the Review.<br />
The Review was announced in the White Paper, Working Nation, in May this<br />
year. Its terms of reference focused on the efficiency and effectiveness of<br />
program delivery arrangements for Government enterprises.<br />
I have asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology,<br />
Senator Cook, to prepare a prompt response to the recommendations in<br />
consultation with other relevant Ministers and I expect further announcements<br />
on these matters will be made in the early part of 1995.<br />
CANBERRA 16 December, 1994 </p>
