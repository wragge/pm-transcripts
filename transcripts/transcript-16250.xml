    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today announced HMAS Sydney II and HSK Kormoran will be protected under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.</p>
<p>Today marks the 67th anniversary of the battle that led to the sinking of the two ships. Commemorative services were held around the nation to honour those who lost their lives  -  the 645 crew of HMAS Sydney II and the 78 of HSK Kormoran.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Australians marvelled at the discovery of HMAS Sydney II and the German raider HSK Kormoran off the coast of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Now the final resting places of the crews have been permanently protected.</p>
<p>For more than 66 years the fate of HMAS Sydney II and HSK Kormoran had been the subject of much public speculation and heartache and the finding gave the opportunity for closure for many families and friends of the crew.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government moved quickly to put temporary measures in place to prohibit unauthorized intrusion into these sites and ensure respect of the war dead of both our nations.</p>
<p>We have now made these measures permanent under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 prohibiting the damage, disturbance or removal of the vessels and their relics and requiring a Commonwealth permit to enter the sites.</p>
<p>Through the Australian Heritage Council, the Rudd Government has begun an assessment for the National Heritage Listing of both sites. </p>
