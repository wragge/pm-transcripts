TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. 3OHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO THE 1997 AUSTRALIA PRIZE PRESENTATION<br />
DINNER, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
Sir Arvi and Lady Parbo, to Mr Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Mr Peter McGauran the Minister for Science and Technology, Dr John Stocker, the<br />
Chief Scientist, many other very distinguished people here tonight, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. It really is a great privilege to be invited to say a few words tonight and to<br />
present to the three winners of the 1997 Australia Prize the acknowledgment of the<br />
great achievement that each of them has enjoyed and may I say on a personal note how<br />
appropriate it is that tonight's proceedings should be presided over by Arvi Parbo.<br />
Arvi Parbo has made an immense contribution to Australian industry and an immense<br />
contribution to the understanding of the role of science and technology in Australia.<br />
He really is one of those great post-war Australian treasures. He came to this country<br />
without being able to speak a word of English. He hurled himself into the future of<br />
post-war Australia and I can't think of anybody of that generation that has made a<br />
greater contribution to the reality of modern Australia.<br />
We inevitably, as we come towards the end of this century and of this millennium, we<br />
inevitably look towards the Year 2001 and to the new millennium and I can't imagine a<br />
discipline or a sphere of understanding or an area of experience which is more<br />
appropriate as we look to the future than the area of telecommunications. Such<br />
impeccable timing! I am used to interjections but not.. most of the interjections I<br />
receive are not of the telecommunicating kind., but when you think of the future and<br />
particularly when you think of the future in Australia, you really can't go past the<br />
overwhelming relevance of telecommunications. One of the great things about<br />
Australia, one of the great things about Australians is that we've always had an<br />
incredible appetite for new technology. We are voracious devourers of new<br />
technology and of new devices. It goes right back to things that, heavens above, we<br />
take for granted now like pop up toasters and vacuum cleaners and all the sort of </p>
<p>things that years and years ago were regarded as great sort of household agents but<br />
now of course you regard as very much part of past history. The way in which<br />
Australians took to video recorders, the way in which we took to mobile telephones,<br />
the fact that there I think are about 2.6 million Internet connections in Australia at the<br />
present time, and I am told that we are going to have about 4 million by the end of this<br />
year which is an extraordinary, when you've got a nation of only 18 million people, it<br />
is quite an extraordinary thing. 22 percent of Australians are registered mobile<br />
telephone users.<br />
I remember the American President telling me on three occasions when he was here<br />
how absolutely transfixed he was by the sight of people with, as he put it, mobile<br />
telephones fixed to their ears as he drove down Oxford Street coming in from the<br />
airport in Sydney. So in so many ways Australia is, of all the advanced industrial<br />
nations of the world, has an immense appetite for new technology and for things<br />
technological and I am so delighted that tonight's gathering brings together such an<br />
elite cross section of the scientific community here in Australia.<br />
I won't endeavour to identify all of the people who are here tonight. Suffice it for me<br />
to say that it really is a full parade of so many of the great Australian names in science<br />
and technology over the last ten years and that is how it should be. We are never<br />
reluctant as a community and as a nation to honour the immense contribution of our<br />
great men and women of sport. Last Friday night I had the opportunity of awarding<br />
the Sports Awards of the Year for the Confederation of Australian Sport in Melbourne<br />
and that is perhaps something that over years has attracted more publicity and more<br />
popular interests than prizes and honours of the type that we recognise tonight but as<br />
the years have gone by I think there is a new maturity in the Australian community<br />
about the importance of science and technology as there is a new maturity about the<br />
role of the arts in our society. It is not a new maturity that in any way diminishes the<br />
importance in our national psyche of sport and the extent to which a love of sport<br />
provides a great national cement, that it is a recognition that Australia is a very diverse<br />
community and any community that lauds excellence must have at the top of the list of<br />
the people it honours those that have made a massive contribution to science and<br />
technology. And so tonight we honour three outstanding Australian contributors in the area of<br />
science and technology. We honour Professor Allan Snyder, Professor Rodney Tucker<br />
and Dr Gottfried Ungerboeck, all of whom, as displayed by the video, have made an<br />
enormous contribution in the area of telecommunications. They have helped make<br />
communications absolutely indispensable and invaluable to the future not only of<br />
Australia but of the entire world and in their different ways each have made a unique<br />
contribution, and you do have to be a special kind of person, a special man or woman<br />
to achieve what each of these have achieved tonight. And I am delighted that my<br />
friend, although political adversary, Barry Jones, the person who inaugurated the<br />
Australia Prize is here tonight because respect for r the role of scientists and respect<br />
for the role of science and technology and the importance of it in the light of our<br />
country is something that transcends political division. It is something that all<br />
Australians who care about the future of this country now recognise quite instinctively<br />
and having said that I want to thank Peter McGauran for the work that he's done as<br />
my Minister in my Government responsible for matters relating to science and </p>
<p>technology. He's brought very great energy to it and he has in his very enthusiastic<br />
way and very committed way lifted the profile of the science community and the<br />
importance of science and technology in the eyes of all members of the Government.<br />
The telecommunications market all around the world is expanding at an exponential<br />
rate and nowhere more dramatically of course than here in Australia.<br />
Telecommunications will break down economic but also very importantly it will break<br />
down social barriers. The way in which telecommunications will bring people<br />
together, not only people from all around the world but people who are isolated and<br />
alienated within the communities of our own nation should never be underestimated.<br />
The way in which links between people living in what they still regard as their new<br />
country and their relatives in their old countries, wherever those countries may be in<br />
other parts of the world, the way in which modern and cheaper telecommunications<br />
have diminished those barriers is one of the things that should never go unremarked at<br />
an occasion like this because one of the great things about modern telecommunications<br />
is the way in which it has really aided people in coming together, the way in which it<br />
has diminished distance, the way it has broken down barriers and helped to forge<br />
friendships and almost daily now we learn of these marvellous stories of romances<br />
being forged through the Internet. I mean, it's not one sort of instinctive sense of the<br />
romance of person meeting person but in time it's making a very, very massive<br />
contribution. So it is absolutely not only part of our present but it is a fundamental part of our<br />
future, telecommunications and the information and technological explosion that is<br />
bound up in it. So I want to congratulate the three winners. I want to say on behalf of<br />
my Government how very strongly committed we are to the central role of science and<br />
technology in the future of Australia and the contribution that scientists and engineers<br />
make to our nation is something that will never go unremarked and will never be<br />
ignored so far as my Government is concerned and I think I can speak confidently in<br />
that context on behalf of all political representation here tonight.<br />
But on a personal note, to the three gentlemen that are receiving and sharing in the<br />
great Australia Prize tonight, can I congratulate each of you unreservedly on the<br />
personal commitment and dedication that you have brought to your disciplines and to<br />
your professions. It is a unique accolade to be honoured with the nation's most<br />
prestigious science award. It is a unique accolade that your peers should have<br />
recognised your special contribution. It is a unique accolade that all those years of toil<br />
and dedication and commitment and that creative genius that people who can reach<br />
heights like this must obviously have. That also is a unique accolade and on behalf of a<br />
very respectful and a very grateful nation that is proud to acknowledge the<br />
contribution that you are making to the discipline of science, may I congratulate you<br />
and wish you well and thank you for your contribution to science and through it the<br />
contribution to the great human family to which all of us belong.<br />
Thank you.<br />
