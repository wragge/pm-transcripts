PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 30 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH NEWSPAPER JOURNALISTS<br />
FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT OF MINISTERIAL CHANGES<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Over the last two or three years the work load of the<br />
Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has<br />
expanded very greatly. I think we can see the results<br />
in that in a greatly improved industrial climate which<br />
comes partly from the relationship which has developed<br />
between Tony Street and the trade union movement. Partly<br />
also I believe from the changes to industrial law; the<br />
introduction of the Industrial Relations Bureau which<br />
has been workly but in a number of areas effectively.<br />
At the same time, through the expansion of various training<br />
programmes, the work load on that side of the Department<br />
has also expanded enormously compared to earllier times.<br />
If you wanted to go back before 1972 and before employment<br />
became a significant problem, the Departnient then was<br />
really an Industrial Relations Department. In recent times<br />
the totality of effort required by the Perm. anent Head<br />
and Minister has grown very greatly. In addition to that,<br />
over a time, the needs of the community, the needs of<br />
Government, in its own facilities for the community<br />
vary in different concerns. Vary and change over time.<br />
That's the reason for establishing two departments where there<br />
will be two permanent heads, obviously, and two Ministers<br />
involved: Tony Street with Industrial Relations, building<br />
on the foundations that have been set and Ian Viner in<br />
Employment and Youth Affairs. The resources of the Industrial<br />
Relations Department will be expanded because there are some<br />
areas where on a national industry and factory basis Tony<br />
Street would have wanted to be able to spend more time but<br />
over the past he has not been able to. A large part of<br />
the work of the Department has been reactive. You react<br />
to a dispute situation when it arises, or to a potential<br />
dispute when you come to hear of it. From the outset it has<br />
been our industrial relations policy the requirement to<br />
develop, as much as possible, consultative processes and<br />
relationships between management and labour that as far<br />
as possible will help to prevent disputes arising. The<br />
Minister and the Department will, under the new arrangements,<br />
be able to devote much greater attention and time to that<br />
aspect of industrial relations. I think this is in a sense<br />
a new development in approach to the industrial arena and<br />
one which no previous government or ministLer has embarked<br />
upon. That is an area where Tony Street has wanted to be<br />
more active than he has been and wanted the Department to<br />
be more active than it has been, but under the pressures of<br />
the total responsibility has not been possible.<br />
Additionally, of course, in the new Department of Employment<br />
and Youth Affairs, they are a very real concern to the<br />
community and very concerns on the part of the Government<br />
and certainly onU-ie part of myself to make sure that the<br />
training programmes and services that are available run as<br />
well as possible. Modified and changed as needs permit<br />
and as circumstances show it to be desirable. That also </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
is an area which in oresent circumstances requires the<br />
, attention of a senior minister on a full-time basis.<br />
The other changes, in a sense, flow from these two.<br />
They are set out in the statement. Fred Chaney to<br />
Aboriginal Affairs. The changes that have been made<br />
in Environment, Housing and Community Development<br />
I think are natural and sensible. Housing goes to<br />
Construction; Environment goes to Science wO. here those<br />
responsible for the environment will be able to work<br />
even more closer with the CSIRO and the resources in<br />
that area which will help to strenghten the overall arm<br />
of the Government in environmental matters.<br />
Question When ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Probably on the 5th. The details of the administrative<br />
arrangements order have to be worked out.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Question ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A number of portfolios depend for their position on the<br />
Minister that has them. Some portfolios obviously have<br />
to be in Cabinet. The Treasury is the obvious example.<br />
But other portfolios depend very much on the Minister.<br />
Aboriginal Affairs wasn't in Cabinet, it ca-me into the<br />
Cabinet because Ian Viner dame into Cabinet. I think he<br />
has been remarkable successful in that portf~ olio but I<br />
have every confidence that Fred Chaney will be a very good<br />
minister for Aboriginal Affairs with the concerns and<br />
sensitivities that are certainly very necessary in that area.<br />
The list, there is much more of an indication to the extent<br />
that this does mean something, it's an indication of people<br />
rather than a rank in the importance of an actual portfolio.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that when Fred Chaney has show-n a'great interest<br />
in that area already as you know and I think that interest<br />
is known. I'm quite sure that he ' 11 win the confidence of the<br />
Aboriginal people as Ian Viner did. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are official processes for the appointment of<br />
Permanent Heads to Departments and those processes<br />
will be that's under the Act as it is for the<br />
appointment of Permanent Heads.<br />
Question ( Laurie Oakes)<br />
need not guarantee ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That's correct-, yes. There's a committee of senior public<br />
servants who wilmake recommendations tCo the Government.<br />
Question How long will that take?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would have t;-hought those processes well they will be<br />
set in train forthwith of course, through the course of<br />
this coming week.<br />
Question<br />
What's the status at the moment... ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Acting arrangements have to be made and I will-be seeking<br />
advice also in~ relation to that.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
For the additional functions in industrial relations, I would<br />
envisage additiional resources being needed.<br />
Question<br />
To what extent?,<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Again, we need advice on that. I do envisage the human<br />
resources of the Department being expanded to enable it<br />
to fill what Tony Street regards, and T regard, as a very<br />
important role. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Question It doesn't seem all that important now. In 1974 it<br />
was very important with 6.3 million days lost, etc.<br />
( inaudible)."'. it's only a quarter ofL that now and yet<br />
you have to have a new Department to deal with the<br />
problem which is virtually no longer a problem.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think industrial relations is a continuing matter for<br />
concern because any dispute that occurs when it might not<br />
have occured because of greater attention or greater<br />
effort then it is a dispute that is unnecessary and damaging<br />
and wasteful.<br />
Question one of the reasons for lack of investment and overseas<br />
-confidence. But given this record surely we can't<br />
use that anymore as a reason for lack of economic recovery.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you will find that quite a number of the disputes<br />
that do occur in the export trade or on the waterfront and<br />
therefore they do come to the notice of people overseas<br />
to quite a considerable extent. The disputes that have involv. ed<br />
Utah, the container disputes, and it clearly doesn't enhance<br />
a country's reputation when trade is help up as a result of<br />
industrial dispute.<br />
Question ( Michelle Grattan)<br />
( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. Environment, Housing and Cormmunity Development. It's<br />
functions go to, in a sense, as I believe, their natural<br />
home. Environment into Science, Housing to Construction,<br />
Sport will go to...<br />
Question To what extent will Mr. Viner... ( inaudible).<br />
Prime minister<br />
Well it depends what you mean by that. If you regard<br />
NEAT as s-, ecially an employment training programme, These<br />
are obviously programmes designed to try and get people<br />
into work, in productive and useful work. The examination,<br />
monitoring, expansion of these programmes has been undertaken<br />
over the last couple of years in particular. I've got no<br />
doubt there will be modifications. I've said publicly, and<br />
Tony Street has, that there is a review of these particular<br />
programmes underway at the moment. A number of suggestions<br />
have been made to us. There are one or two interesting<br />
experiments being undertaken in different areas. </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Because of ourconcern, quite obviously these matt--ers<br />
are reviewed continually and I believe the Gove'-rnment<br />
will be better served and I think people who want assistance,<br />
help, in this area, will also be better served by having a<br />
Minister who can devote 100 percent of his time to these<br />
particular problems. I've got no doubt that there will<br />
be recommendations put to us from time to time but if there<br />
is an implication in your question that that means a change<br />
of the broad thrust of--economic policy, the answ,. er to<br />
that part of it would be no.<br />
Question Is there likely to be a review of the Government's overall<br />
policy on employment, following on from this creation of<br />
a new department?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not a review of the br-oad thrust of strategy.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That's the intention, but I will taking advice on that<br />
point also. If you are writing that you can say it is<br />
likely that.<br />
Question the whole lot up.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not the whole lot up, no, because both Departm~ ents would<br />
clearly need, as many Departments do, bases out in other<br />
parts of Australia.<br />
Question It will be headquartered in...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If you are talking about the headquarters put it in terms<br />
" it's likely that..."<br />
Question What happens to the special established months ago<br />
with Industrial Relations.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That committee would be continuing. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Question: ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It had work put in front of it and I'm not sure how often<br />
it has met actually because I don't know ,. hen all Cabinet<br />
Committees meet. It had matters put in front-of it and<br />
a good deal of work was commissioned as a result of that.<br />
I've got no doubt that the Committee will meet as it<br />
feels necessary.<br />
Question Could I just ask one question about the workings of that<br />
Committee. There has been some confusion ahout it.<br />
Will that Committee will particular disputes be<br />
referred to that Committee?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, it was never intended to ( inaudible). If you've got<br />
a major dispute, which the Minister feels needs referring<br />
to other Ministers or to Cabinet, it could co to that<br />
Committee or it could go to Cabinet. The major disputes<br />
go the Cabinet anyway, or have done in the zast. So there<br />
is nothing new in that. I think some of the writing at<br />
the time was that all disputes will.. but that just hasn't<br />
happened. It's not intended to happen.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Tony Street. That stays in his area.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Ministers didn't know this announcement was being made<br />
today but Tony Street will be handling that tomorrow. There<br />
will times in the future. NLCC will stay in his area of<br />
responsibility. There will times, clearly., when Ian Viner<br />
will need to be present.<br />
Question ( Inaudible) / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I don't know what his movements are tomorrow. If he can<br />
be, it would be helpful, but it's not mandatory and<br />
Tony Street's quite capable of handling it.<br />
Question Did you ask Yzr. Peacock if he wanted to change his<br />
portfolio... ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'm not going to start commenting on conversatiorslI might<br />
or might not : iave had with any other Ministers. I don't<br />
blame you for trying it on, but I don't think you would<br />
have expected any other answer.<br />
Question<br />
You say that the split of the EHCD will fit logically, naturally,<br />
in other departments. How logical and how natural is<br />
Mr. Newman with these likes atomic energy commission... ( inaudible)<br />
and general energy development. It's a sort of twin<br />
department to Trade and Resources ( inaudible). How does<br />
urban planning and local government fit naturally and logically<br />
into that?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you've forgotten that he's also got decentralisation<br />
responsibilities and the decentralisation...<br />
Question<br />
All I'm suggesting is<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not at all. Local government matters very clearly go with<br />
decentralisat ion.<br />
Question How do they go with the Atomic Energy Commission or...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you're suggesting that a Department sometimes only<br />
has one functi_* on. I hope you are not suggesting there just<br />
be one departm: ent for the Atomic Energy Authority.<br />
Question But I can't see the logical / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It logically and naturally fits with some 1 asDects<br />
of the Department of National Development.<br />
Question Did you say a moment ago that none of the Ministers knew<br />
that these changes were taking place?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Of course the Ministers knew these changes were taking place.<br />
Quite a significant nunber did but the question of timing<br />
was one that they might not have been aware of.<br />
Que stion<br />
Can I ask you if the reference to the new arrangements<br />
was "...( inaudible) industrial disputes". ( Inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. I think it is a cuestion of you can only do these<br />
things with co-operation. Our industrial relations policy<br />
has had, from the outset, in it the proposal that there<br />
should be consultative procedures established in particular<br />
work places which would enable management and labour to<br />
consult on a continuing basis and not just in a crisis<br />
atmoshphere when there is a real problem and a real difficulty.<br />
Now such processes work in some industries and some work<br />
places very well and very effectively. In others they work<br />
very well or very effectively. In others just not enough<br />
attention is given to it. In some, management might not be<br />
interested. In others unions aren't interested. Therie is<br />
a role to promote the concept of consultation in the<br />
industrial environment much more vigorously and I think it<br />
will take a good deal of time and effort. There are three<br />
levels at which this can occur because in a sense disputes<br />
come at different levels. It can -be local. It can be<br />
industry-based and sometimes national. I know Tony Street<br />
wants to work in this if you like preventative<br />
arena on the national level, the industry level and on<br />
an individual factory basis. I think it, in a sense, heralds<br />
an important additional element in our attitude to industrial<br />
relations and in the w.. ay we seek to go about promoting a<br />
better industrial cli-zate.<br />
Question Did he say he was more interested in this prevention... rather<br />
than the employment side<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Again, I don't want to talk about the particular information<br />
to Ministers. Tony Street I believe has been remarkably<br />
successful in the industrial relations environment and in<br />
the other area also, but the plain facts are that the / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
responsibilities in both areas have groTrn very greatly<br />
and the time involved has grown very greatly. I certainly<br />
believe he's got a continuing contribution to make in theindustrial<br />
relations environment which may be uniquely<br />
his. He's got a very great capacitLy to get on with members<br />
of the trade union movement that I think surprised some<br />
people when he was originally appointed to the job.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
He's been staying out at the Lodge tk-his week and we discussed<br />
these things at length and it is my very strong impression<br />
that he is where he wants to be.<br />
Question ( Inaudible) extent of your ministerial changes?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have nothing else in mind at all.<br />
Question You said last week that no changes wxere in contemplation...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes I did. I've been thinking of how, for<br />
some time, how to give more attention to the very real<br />
needs in our community in certain areas and to the changing<br />
basis of those needs. You can be king about it and<br />
not quite know how to respond to it.<br />
Question But you said not in contemplation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I didn't have ministerial changes in contemplation.<br />
Question You didn't?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. </p>
<p>10<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I didn't.<br />
Question<br />
You just wanted to think of ways to give m~ ore attention<br />
to ( inaudible).<br />
Question<br />
What is the employment prospect that faces the news<br />
of ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You've got Tony Street's statement and other statements<br />
in relation to that. The prospects are =-lI there. There<br />
are a number of factors that have an i--ract on what is<br />
going to occur in the employment arena. Some af these are<br />
under our own control in relation to inflation and changes<br />
in wage levels -,, here the attitude I have is virtually<br />
identical with that of Dennis Healey or -: he British Prime<br />
Minister. Others can also be affected by what happens<br />
overseas. Because inflation has tended " o increase rather<br />
than to continue to diminish in North Arn== erica and a number<br />
of countries in Europe I don't think you can expect to<br />
find an expansion in world trade, in world markets, which a<br />
year ago many of us were hoping for. That means that we<br />
will have to be more reliant on our own efforts to overcome<br />
our problems and even more vigorous in m~ aking A\ ustralian<br />
industries more competitive: to get a hb%; ger share of our<br />
domestic marketl-and at the same time to enable more people<br />
to get into the export arena. There' s b-eginning to be<br />
some encouraging news in relation to the exports of<br />
manufacturers. Question talks with ?, inisters over the last ccu-2ple of days.<br />
( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Some Ministers, because of the nature their job, you<br />
see very often and you are talking with them but other<br />
Ministers, because their task might be out of the mainstream<br />
of public concern, you don't talk to in relaxed way about<br />
their concerns and problems and how the-y feel matters are<br />
going in their portfolio and I wanted to do just that.<br />
