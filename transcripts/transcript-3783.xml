PRaME MINSTEA Press Statement<br />
] 8 June ] 975<br />
TASMANIA MEDIBANK AGREEMENT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam and the Premier of<br />
Tasmania, Mr Neilson today signed the Medibank Agreement between<br />
the Australian and Tasmanian Governments. The ceremonial<br />
signing took place at the Launceston General Hospital before<br />
Mr Whitlam met patients and staff there.<br />
Mrs Nellie Ellis, a patient at Launceston General Hospital<br />
witnessed the Prime Minister's signature on the two copies of<br />
the Agreement. Legislation on Medibank has passed both Houses of<br />
the Tasmanian Parliament and the Agreement will come into force<br />
as scheduled on July. This means that from that date,<br />
Tasmanians will be able to take full advantage of the benefits<br />
offered by Medibank.<br />
The onyv other State to have entered a Medibank<br />
Agreement is South Australia. The Prime Minister signed a<br />
Medibank Hospital Agreement with the South Australian Premier,<br />
Mr Dunstan, in Adelaide last Sunday.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he was especially pleased that the<br />
two State Labor G-overnments had shown the obvious advantages<br />
of co-operating with the Australian Government in the best<br />
interests of their citizens.<br />
In his Bass by-election campaign speech in Launceston<br />
last night, Mr Whitlam drew attention to the lameness of the claim<br />
of the non-Labor States for additional finance from the Australian<br />
Government, when they have shown such reluctance to join Medibank<br />
despite the obvious financial advantage it would be to them<br />
especially in the hospital field.<br />
Under the Medibank Agreement, the Australian Government<br />
will meet 50 zer cent of the net operating costs of all the<br />
recognised hospitals in Tasmania for the ten year period of the<br />
Agreement. ( A list of recognised hospitals is attavhed).<br />
The Agreement states that " it is the policy of<br />
Australia to ensure that every person has access to comprehensive<br />
hospital care, including medical treatment, provided without<br />
charge and without means test in standard beds of public hospitals." / 2 </p>

The Agreement provides for variation from time to<br />
time to ensure that Tasmania continues to draw maximum<br />
advantage from the scheme and may renegotiate should any other<br />
State negoti= re an Agreement in any more favourable terms.<br />
