    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................</p>
<p> Thank you very much Mr President. To you and to my State and</p>
<p> Federal Parliamentary colleagues and fellow Liberals. It is always</p>
<p> a delight to address the State Council of the NSW Division. It always</p>
<p> a pleasure to come back to this building where I have attended many</p>
<p> meetings over the years and shared with you our common commitment</p>
<p> to the Liberal Party cause here in NSW and throughout Australia.</p>
<p>This week of course has been dominated by two significant events.</p>
<p> The first of those was the unveiling of the 1999 Federal Budget. Rarely</p>
<p> has a government had the opportunity to present a budget in more positive</p>
<p> economic circumstances. And rarely has a government earned the right</p>
<p> by dint of its own decision making to present a budget in such favourable</p>
<p> circumstances. It is not an idle boast to say that the economic condition</p>
<p> of this country is better than it has been since the last 1960s.</p>
<p>In the last year the Australian economy has out-performed any economy</p>
<p> in the industrialised world. Despite predictions to the contrary,</p>
<p> we stared-down the Asian economic downturn. When I became Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia this country was an anxious outsider knocking on the</p>
<p> Asian door, almost begging admission. Such was the mindset that had</p>
<p> been acquired under the leadership of the former government. A little</p>
<p> over three years on we are seen as a nation stronger, more secure,</p>
<p> more progressive and more willing to help with our regional friends</p>
<p> than ever in our history. We are seen quite properly as being fully</p>
<p> engaged with, and committed, to the Asian region. But we are not obsessed</p>
<p> about how we relate to the region any more. We no longer worry about</p>
<p> whether we are part of Asia, involved with Asia, enmeshed with Asia.</p>
<p> We are simply being ourselves in Asia.</p>
<p>And the ourselves we are being, if I can put it that way, is a nation</p>
<p> proud of the fact that we occupy a special intersection of culture,</p>
<p> geography and history. And those things a few years ago that were</p>
<p> seen almost as weaknesses for Australia in Asia, such as our stable</p>
<p> banking system, some people said that was a bit dull and unenterprising,</p>
<p> our strong rules of corporate governance, our commitment to a system</p>
<p> of open parliamentary democracy, all of those things are now seen</p>
<p> as massive strengths. And when I met the President of Indonesia, the</p>
<p> leader of 211 million people, our nearest neighbour, the fourth largest</p>
<p> nation on earth, I am greeted as the leader of a country which is</p>
<p> seen as strong, as positive, as a good but not uncritical friend and</p>
<p> ally. I said when I became Prime Minister on the 2nd of</p>
<p> March 1996 that I would propound and defend the values of Australia</p>
<p> abroad. And I've kept faith with that commitment. And when I</p>
<p> spoke to Dr Habibie I propounded and defended the values of Australia,</p>
<p> but I did so in a way that did not hector or seek to tell another</p>
<p> country that what worked here necessarily worked there. And this is</p>
<p> something we should remember in our relations with other societies.</p>
<p>And just as I abhor us wanting to change ourselves to please others</p>
<p> I don't expect others necessarily to change themselves to please</p>
<p> us. We have to understand that in a world of differences, philosophical,</p>
<p> history, cultural and ethnic, inevitably nations do not need to be</p>
<p> carbon copies of each other in order to cooperate in a constructive</p>
<p> fashion. And we have achieved in relation to East Timor, we have achieved</p>
<p> something that our predecessors did not do. And that was we have played</p>
<p> a major role in changing the policy of the Indonesian Government.</p>
<p> And we've changed it in a very constructive way.</p>
<p>So it was with an enormous pleasure that we were able to present a</p>
<p> budget which delivered a surplus, a budget that reported that Australia</p>
<p> had grown more strongly than any nation in the industrialised world</p>
<p> over the last 12 months. A budget that recorded that we have the lowest</p>
<p> interest rates in 30 years, the lowest inflation rate in 30 years,</p>
<p> a strong level of business investment. But it was also a budget that</p>
<p> was able to make important social provision. It always important to</p>
<p> have a balance between economic realism and social concern and social</p>
<p> provision.</p>
<p>As I said a couple of weeks ago when addressing the Australian Unlimited</p>
<p> Conference in Melbourne, our government is very much about liberalisation</p>
<p> in economic affairs, and what I described as modern conservatism in</p>
<p> social affairs. A concern to maintain the traditional values of Australian</p>
<p> society but to apply them in a modern and contemporary fashion, having</p>
<p> regard to the changes that have taken place in our community and our</p>
<p> society over the last few generations. And that social provision,</p>
<p> or modern conservatism, expressed itself in a number of ways. Our</p>
<p> renewed commitment to further reform in the area of private health</p>
<p> insurance. We are for a mixed system. We are for the public hospital</p>
<p> system, but unlike the Labor Party we believe in private health insurance.</p>
<p> That's why we brought in a 30 per cent rebate, something the</p>
<p> Labor Party should have done years ago but refused to do because of</p>
<p> their obsession with destroying private health insurance, despite</p>
<p> what their now leader says. If they had done something about private</p>
<p> health insurance in 1990 when their former health minister Grahame</p>
<p> Richardson said they should, then we would not have inherited a private</p>
<p> health insurance level in this country of about 32 per cent.</p>
<p>We've brought in life-time health cover. Life-time health cover</p>
<p> will provide further incentive for young and healthy people to take</p>
<p> out private health insurance. But there will be a 12 month grace period</p>
<p> until the 1st of July 2000 for people between age 30 and</p>
<p> age 65 to join and under the arrangement everybody over the age of</p>
<p> 65 who joins for the first time being able to do so without penalty.</p>
<p> And at long last we will actually reward people who have given loyalty</p>
<p> to private health insurance funds over the long years. And they are</p>
<p> entitled to a reward.</p>
<p>Our social concern was displayed in relation to our commitment to</p>
<p> education. Quite unapologetically this budget provided for the most</p>
<p> generous and the most supportive provision for non-government schools</p>
<p> that any Federal Government in this country's history has provided</p>
<p> for. But it was not done in any way to disadvantage the government</p>
<p> schools. We believe in a simple principle in education and that is</p>
<p> that every Australian parent has the right to educate his or her children</p>
<p> according to their choice. It is a fundamental Liberal principle first</p>
<p> dramatically embraced by Sir Robert Menzies 36 years ago when he broke</p>
<p> the gridlock Â he broke the deadlock on State aid to independent</p>
<p> schools and ended almost a century of discrimination against almost</p>
<p> 30 per cent of the Australian population. He did it in a dramatic</p>
<p> and generous way, he did it in a way that the Labor Party was incapable</p>
<p> of doing.</p>
<p>And what I did, and what the budget did last Tuesday night was to</p>
<p> carry on that tradition into new areas to provide low income parents</p>
<p> in both Catholic and non-Catholic schools greater support and as the</p>
<p> Secretary of the Christian Schools Association said in his press release</p>
<p> that the announcement we made delivered more justice to working class</p>
<p> families and enabled them to make greater choices in education than</p>
<p> the provision that any government in Australian history had ever made.</p>
<p> And this argument we get from the Labor Party that we're discriminating</p>
<p> against government schools totally ignores the fact that the great</p>
<p> providers for the government schools are their owners and that is</p>
<p> the State governments of Australia. On a per capita basis Federal</p>
<p> Governments always give more money to independent schools because</p>
<p> Federal Governments don't fund government schools, they're</p>
<p> funded by the State Governments. And this business I mean to grab</p>
<p> hold of a statistic and to say that because you're giving $X</p>
<p> a head straight out of the Federal budget to Government schools, and</p>
<p> X plus to independent schools that you're discriminating against</p>
<p> the Government schools completely ignores the fact that we give billions</p>
<p> of dollars in financial assistance grants each year to the State Government,</p>
<p> and the biggest claim made on State government budgets is in fact</p>
<p> education.</p>
<p>And under the financial agreements this year, the State of NSW for</p>
<p> example will receive a five per cent real increase in their financial</p>
<p> assistance grants. Well the average will be five per cent across the</p>
<p> States and as you know the Commonwealth Grants Commission has awarded</p>
<p> the State of NSW an increase of about $165 million under the equalisation</p>
<p> arrangements that have operated under our Federal/State financial</p>
<p> relations.</p>
<p>So I reject totally and completely the hogwash peddled by the teacher</p>
<p> unions and the Labor Party that we are discriminating against government</p>
<p> schools. It is our responsibility to fund independent school choice.</p>
<p> We are doing it in a fair and balanced way and even in the most needy</p>
<p> and least provided for parish Catholic school in Australia, the parent</p>
<p> is only being subsidised to 70 per cent of the cost of educating a</p>
<p> child in a government school. And to suggest in those circumstances,</p>
<p> and given the responsibility of State Governments that in some way</p>
<p> we are discriminating in favour of so-called elite private schools</p>
<p> in this country is nonsense. The greatest expansion in the independent</p>
<p> sector is not in the so-called elite schools but is in fact in the</p>
<p> low fee schools that are growing up as a result of the relaxation</p>
<p> of the new schools policy that I undertook to do before the 1996 election.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen it was a great budget. It was deservedly well</p>
<p> received because it combines economic achievement with social concern.</p>
<p> It displayed a government that was sensitive to social need but also</p>
<p> a government that has its eye very clearly on economic strength and</p>
<p> economic rectitude. A government that recognised that we couldn't</p>
<p> be complacent and couldn't take for granted our economic achievement.</p>
<p> But above everything else, as we look back on Tuesday night, we were</p>
<p> able to say that today's strength was a product of yesterday's</p>
<p> reform. Just as tomorrow's strength will be a product of today's</p>
<p> reform. And that of course brings me to the issue of taxation.</p>
<p>You've heard me say before that I regard reforming the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system as the largest piece of unfinished economic business</p>
<p> in this country. I said that two years ago, I said it repeatedly during</p>
<p> the election campaign, I said it last week, and it's as true</p>
<p> today as it was then. And nothing that happened yesterday alters the</p>
<p> fact that if we want to maintain the momentum we have developed we</p>
<p> need to reform our taxation system in a quite fundamental way. And</p>
<p> that is why I committed the Government to taxation reform before the</p>
<p> last election. And when I took the decision that we needed taxation</p>
<p> reform and when our Cabinet decided we needed taxation reform, we</p>
<p> knew that we wouldn't get control of the Senate at the last election.</p>
<p> The reality is that under our present system, particularly as the</p>
<p> result of the changes that were made in 1984 to increase the size</p>
<p> of the Federal parliament, changes that the Liberal Party voted against</p>
<p> but as a result of that it is impossible, virtually, for either side</p>
<p> of politics to control the Senate in its own right. And until there's</p>
<p> any change in that, and I don't speculate about that, that is</p>
<p> going to continue to be the situation. I knew, therefore, that we</p>
<p> wouldn't get control of the Senate. And I calculated that if</p>
<p> we spelt it all out in detail before the election, if we did what</p>
<p> people constantly say politicians don't do and that is tell the</p>
<p> truth about our intentions and then set about keeping our promises,</p>
<p> I knew that if we didn't do that we would have no prospect of</p>
<p> getting the legislation through the Parliament.</p>
<p>So we spelt it out in total detail. We made full disclosure. We held</p>
<p> nothing back. We exposed ourselves to the most ferocious fear campaign.</p>
<p> And what we have sought to do since the election has been to keep</p>
<p> that promise. And I was very proud of the fact that Peter Costello</p>
<p> was able to hold up a document last Tuesday night, when he delivered</p>
<p> the budget, and it was entitled ÂKeeping Our Promises for a Stronger</p>
<p> Australia.' And every single promise I made on behalf of the</p>
<p> Government in October of last year has been honoured in full, without</p>
<p> variation, in the Federal Budget. We didn't suddenly discover,</p>
<p> as Mr Carr did after the 1995 State election that he couldn't</p>
<p> rid of the toll way. We didn't suddenly discover, as Mr Keating</p>
<p> did after the 1993 election that having won an election campaign fighting</p>
<p> an indirect tax that, Âoh, sorry fella's, I didn't</p>
<p> tell you about the need to increase all the wholesale sales taxes.'</p>
<p> We didn't do that. We did the exact opposite. We laid it out</p>
<p> in total detail. We exposed ourselves to all the risks that were inherent</p>
<p> in laying it out in detail. And we did that because we thought that</p>
<p> was the right thing to do and the honest thing to do. And we also</p>
<p> felt that that would give us some moral authority to say to the Senate,</p>
<p> Âwell, we told the people about it before the election, they</p>
<p> returned us to government, you have an obligation to pass it.'</p>
<p> And it's the operation of those forces which is at stake in the</p>
<p> debate that is taking place at the moment. What incentive is there</p>
<p> for future governments to be honest and open with the Australian people</p>
<p> if they can't implement what they were elected on? It would have</p>
<p> been a different matter if I had gone to the last election and said,</p>
<p> Âwell, I believe in taxation reform, trust me,' or like</p>
<p> Bob Hawke in 1984, I'd said I'm going to have a meeting</p>
<p> or a summit. Or if I had just generally fudged and said I'm going</p>
<p> to cut your income tax and then after the election said, oh, look,</p>
<p> I sort of left the page out. And that page contains a whole lot of</p>
<p> indirect tax increases. We didn't do any of that. We produced</p>
<p> a document that contained the greatest amount of detail ever presented</p>
<p> to the Australian people in an election campaign about a major policy</p>
<p> initiative. We could not have been more open and obvious and transparent.</p>
<p> We could not have made fuller disclosure. Yet we face a prospect that</p>
<p> what we were elected on being voted down by the Australian Senate</p>
<p> when the legislation is presented.</p>
<p>Now, the Australian people, in their own way, in their own time, will</p>
<p> make judgements about that and they will make judgements about those</p>
<p> who've made a contribution to that State of affairs. And people</p>
<p> keep asking me what is my reaction to this or that person. Other members</p>
<p> of the Australian Parliament are not accountable to me, they are accountable</p>
<p> to the Australian people, as I am accountable to the Australian people,</p>
<p> as my Federal colleagues are accountable to the Australian people.</p>
<p> And all we are saying to the Australian people is, we want to do for</p>
<p> you what we said we would do for you. That is what I am saying to</p>
<p> the Australian people. And I would have thought in its most elementary</p>
<p> way parliamentary democracy in our kind of society was about keeping</p>
<p> faith with people. And there's a marvellous quote, I think it's</p>
<p> from Robert Frost, that talks about having promises to keep and miles</p>
<p> to walk before I sleep. We have promises to keep. As a party we want</p>
<p> to keep them. There are others who are stopping us from keeping those</p>
<p> promises.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we remain committed, resolutely committed, to</p>
<p> reforming the Australian taxation system. We don't want to reform</p>
<p> the Australian taxation system because of some ideological bent. We're</p>
<p> not doing it because of our health. We're not doing it because</p>
<p> it's the next thing do and we've got bored. We're doing</p>
<p> it because we really believe it will strengthen the Australian economy</p>
<p> in years to come. I want the Treasurer of this country in 2010 to</p>
<p> be able to stand up and present a budget as glowing as the one that</p>
<p> Peter presented last Tuesday night and to turn around and say, this</p>
<p> is the product of the reforms that the Howard Government undertook</p>
<p> at the turn of the century. We do need a new tax system for a new</p>
<p> millenium. We owe it to ourselves not to be complacent. In a competitive,</p>
<p> globalised world economy your competitor is the other bloke in the</p>
<p> race, not your predecessor as Prime Minister 25 years earlier. It's</p>
<p> no good me telling the Australian people that our economy is performing</p>
<p> better than it did 30 years ago unless I'm able to say it continues</p>
<p> to outperform our competitors. And that is our challenge. We have</p>
<p> achieved a lot because of past reforms. We won't achieve more</p>
<p> in the future unless we undertake further reforms. And that is why</p>
<p> we need to change the Australian taxation system. And that is why</p>
<p> we will presevere in the campaign to change that taxation system.</p>
<p>My friends, that is all I want to say about the Federal political</p>
<p> scene. But can I say, as a longstanding member of this Division and</p>
<p> as a person who's attended as a delegate hundreds of State Council</p>
<p> meetings since I first started coming to State Council in the early</p>
<p> 1960s, that I share the sense of disappointment that the party organisation</p>
<p> feels about the outcome of the State election. And I think I would</p>
<p> be failing in my duty as a longstanding member of the New South Wales</p>
<p> Division if I didn't make a couple of observations. And I will</p>
<p> presume to draw upon that long membership in the candor of the observations</p>
<p> that I will make.</p>
<p>Can I first of all say, little is achieved by intense recrimination</p>
<p> or retrospection. Little is achieved by that. Nothing is achieved</p>
<p> by scape-goating. Something is achieved if lessons of past mistakes</p>
<p> are learnt and those lessons are applied. And something is achieved</p>
<p> if it is recognised that if there are some fundamental structural</p>
<p> weaknesses to a party's approach then those structural weaknesses</p>
<p> should be addressed at the beginning of a term in Opposition and not</p>
<p> somewhere else during that term.</p>
<p>Could I make the observation that, and I made it publicly before and</p>
<p> perhaps some people may not have liked the language I used but I stand</p>
<p> by it, but to be credible any Opposition has to develop an alternative</p>
<p> policy agenda. And it has to be developed over the period it is in</p>
<p> Opposition. It cannot be cobbled together at the last minute. One</p>
<p> of our most revered New South Wales Division's sons, Sir John</p>
<p> Carrick, had that marvelously evocative observation that you can't</p>
<p> fatten a pig on market day. Some people might think it's old-fashioned,</p>
<p> I think it remains very relevant. And you can't fatten, you can't,</p>
<p> you have to, over a period of time, build. We learnt that through</p>
<p> our bitter cost, Federally. We went through 13 years in Opposition</p>
<p> Federally. And when I look back on those years I can recognise mistakes</p>
<p> that are still being made by others. You can't put it together</p>
<p> at the last minute. You've got to develop a policy brand. People</p>
<p> have got to know you by your political values otherwise they will</p>
<p> not support you and that applies to you whether you're in government</p>
<p> or whether you're in Opposition. Now, that is a piece of across</p>
<p> the board advice. It is meant very genuinely. It is not directed any</p>
<p> anybody or any group of people in particular. It is generally directed</p>
<p> towards what I saw to be a difficulty here in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The other observation I would make is that one of the implied understandings</p>
<p> or covenants, as I often call it, on which the Liberal Party was established</p>
<p> is that you had a parliamentary wing and you had an organisational</p>
<p> wing. The parliamentary wing, unlike the Labor Party, was given complete</p>
<p> authority to determine policy. We won elections in the 1960s on a</p>
<p> campaign about the faceless men who controlled the Parliamentary Labor</p>
<p> Party. We prided ourselves on the fact that the people in Parliament</p>
<p> elected by the Australian people were the people who ultimately decided</p>
<p> policy. And we maintain that principle zealously. I consult the organisation.</p>
<p> I talk to them. I listen to them. I have a very close association</p>
<p> with my Federal President and with the State organisations and the</p>
<p> Federal Director. But in the end, our Cabinet and our Parliamentary</p>
<p> Party decides policy.</p>
<p>When we decided to embrace tax reform, before I made the announcement</p>
<p> I had a telephone hook-up with all of the State Presidents to explain</p>
<p> the Parliamentary Party's decision so they knew in advance. But</p>
<p> we took the decision but that's the Parliamentary Party's</p>
<p> prerogative. The corollary to that is that the organisation has complete</p>
<p> control in relation to candidate selection, has complete control in</p>
<p> relation to all of the matters relating to the running of campaigns</p>
<p> and to the operation of the organisation.</p>
<p>Can I say, with all the best will in the world, I think those two</p>
<p> responsibilities have become too blended and too merged here in New</p>
<p> South Wales, especially at a State level. I think one of the things</p>
<p> we have got to do is to reassert the separate responsibilities of</p>
<p> the organisation and of the Parliamentary party. I think it's</p>
<p> one of the important tasks that the organisation has over the weeks</p>
<p> and months ahead.</p>
<p>The other two observations I would make is, and this is as somebody</p>
<p> who first sat on the State Executive in 1963, is that I think our</p>
<p> State Executive is far too big. You can't run, in my view, a</p>
<p> political party with an executive that big. I think you desirably</p>
<p> need an executive of about 20 people whose sole parliamentary representatives</p>
<p> are those people who are elected directly to represent the federal</p>
<p> and State parliamentary parties. Now, some people in this room won't</p>
<p> like that and I don't imagine that much notice will be taken</p>
<p> of it. But, quite frankly, as somebody who cares about being in government</p>
<p> and as somebody who has had a bit of experience of being both in and</p>
<p> out of government, and as somebody who loves the Liberal Party and</p>
<p> who's spent all of his adult life as a member of the New South</p>
<p> Wales Division, I do think that I've earned perhaps the right,</p>
<p> just on this one occasion, to say a couple of things.</p>
<p>And there's one other thing I want to say and that is that if</p>
<p> all of that advice, per chance, were taken that would be good but</p>
<p> there's one other thing I just feel duty bound to say and that</p>
<p> is that I think this Division has spent far too much time and energy</p>
<p> in what I can only describe as self-destructive, personality-based</p>
<p> factionalism. I mean, I can understand in a way, providing it doesn't</p>
<p> become self-destructive, a party that has factionalism based on ideology.</p>
<p> But for heaven's sake, when it's based on mutual self-promotion</p>
<p> and it shows an unwillingness to see the common enemy it becomes self-destructive.</p>
<p>And I say that in relation to the behaviour of both sides of the argument.</p>
<p> One of the great successes of the Federal Parliamentary party after</p>
<p> I resumed the leadership in January 1995 was the fact that it operated</p>
<p> as a broad church. That there was proper representation in the shadow</p>
<p> Cabinet and in the Cabinet, of different points of view. A recognition</p>
<p> that in the end if there was a majority view on a particular issue</p>
<p> that majority view would prevail, but not in a triumphal, winner-takes-all</p>
<p> sense. And I think any political party is a coalition. We are a coalition.</p>
<p> The Liberal Party of Australia is the trustee of both the liberal,</p>
<p> the classical liberal tradition of this country, as well as the conservative</p>
<p> tradition. We are not exclusively either a small "l" liberal</p>
<p> party or a conservative party. We are a mixture of both. And unless</p>
<p> we remember that and we keep practising that we are doomed to repeat</p>
<p> the mistakes, certainly that we've experienced over the last</p>
<p> few years here at a State level.</p>
<p>Well Mr President I think I've said a fair bit this morning,</p>
<p> and perhaps I've overdone it, </p>
