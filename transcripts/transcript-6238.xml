FOR MEDIA 10 OCTOBER 1983<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following message to<br />
President Chun of South Korea:<br />
May I express to you on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and people our deep shock in learning of<br />
the tragedy which befell your party in Rangoon.<br />
The reasons for such a callous outrage are beyond<br />
imagination. A number of your ? inisters and officials<br />
who died in Rangoon were well and warmly known to me<br />
and other members of my government.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people I<br />
wish to express our condolences to you and to the<br />
Korean people and our support for your government at<br />
this troubled time. Would you please also convey to the<br />
families of those who died our deep sympathy. We wish<br />
a speedy recovery to the injured.<br />
We had been looking forward to your visit. Cooperation<br />
and friendship with the Republic of Korea are of great<br />
importance to Australia's future. I look forward to your<br />
visit taking place at a happier time.<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>
