E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PJI( Can I say what a pleasure it is to have Tony Blair in Australia. We are<br />
both in the same business and that has been modemising Labor parties<br />
which is a pretty tough thing to be doing at the best of times and I like to<br />
think, and I have said in this country and am happy to repeat it here, that<br />
one of the great structural changes in Australia in the last 12 years was<br />
actually the change to the Labor Party itself. Turning the Labor Party into<br />
a party of government has been a matter of enduring benefit to this country<br />
because most countries don't have the opportunity of modernising * their<br />
political parties. This I am doing and this, of course, Tony Blair is doing.<br />
Beyond that can I say that there is a very strong modemn relationship with<br />
Britain. Britain is the largest investor in Australia. We are the second<br />
largest investor in Britain. We hiave long traditional links and I am<br />
delighted to see the Leader of the British Labour Party in this country<br />
renewing those linkages and giving us a chance to compare notes about<br />
how we see both our domestic and our international policy outlooks and<br />
again to talk about the things we have in common and to listen to each<br />
others experiences and to know that we are on a very interesting and<br />
rewarding endeavour in the things we are doing.<br />
So, I'd like to say how glad I am to have Tony in Australia and it may not<br />
look to the travelling British press like winter, but it is. It is a strange sort of<br />
winter I know, but up here it is warmer than it is down south as you know<br />
and I am sure that a change of climate as it is will give US a chance to get<br />
to understand the Labour Party in Britain better and Tony we are pleased<br />
to have you here.<br />
TB: Thanks very much Paul. </p>
<p>J: Mr Blair, what can you take back from your consultations with Mr Keating<br />
and the Australian government back to Britain?<br />
TB: Well, obviously, the fact that the Australian Labor Party has won, is it five<br />
elections In a row? It seems to us a rather good record to take into<br />
account and emulate if we possibly can. But there are also, I think, very<br />
powerful lessons in the way that the Australian Labor government has<br />
delivered greater economic efficiency, very high rates of growth at the<br />
same time as keeping true to strong social values and the good social<br />
wage. Also, the Australian Labor Party and the British Labour Party have<br />
links going back over a long period of time. I was saying earlier this<br />
morning, although it has been the case that we have often looked to Left to<br />
Centre parties in Europe with which we have dialogue, in many ways the<br />
ties between the British Labour Party and the Australian Labor Party are<br />
even closer.<br />
J: Has Mr Keating passed his recipe for electoral success at a'national level<br />
onto Mr Blair and if so what's in it?<br />
PJI( You have got to keep changing the recipe, this is the problem. We have<br />
talked about our electoral success, but I think, Tony has in a sense,<br />
summed up what we have been about. That is turning Australia into a<br />
modem, a sophisticated market economy, but in the context of a set of<br />
social policies which have underlined the premium we put on inclusion.<br />
That is, we have tried to, by a process of strong employment growth and<br />
equitable policies in such things as access and equity In education, in<br />
health, the whole training agenda, employment of course the great liberator<br />
of all, in these things, I think, we have produced a much more equitable<br />
and fair society, yet we have had faster rates of growth double the rates<br />
of economic growth of our conservative predecessors. If there has been<br />
any formula for why Labor has won five elections I would say that was it,<br />
that is we made a point of wanting to take the country along together.<br />
That there is no underclass and that we think together we are stronger. If<br />
we are together we are better, we are stronger, we are more cohesive and<br />
I think, this has been well appreciated by our community.<br />
TB: If I could add just one thing to that, I think, to me the record of the<br />
Australian Labor government is one of combining economic efficiency with<br />
a just and fair society. But it has also been one about giving a very clear<br />
sense of direction and purpose to government and having a very clear and<br />
profound understanding of Australia's place in the world and, I think, those<br />
are all things that obviously have a resonance in British politics too.<br />
J: You are at the head of a resurgent Labour Party in Britain, what do you<br />
think you might have to offer to a Labor Party here? </p>
<p>TB: I think the Labor Party here has resurged and the length of time it has<br />
been in government shows that. -But, obviously, What wehavebeen tryinsg<br />
to do with British Labour Party is not just update how we apply our values<br />
to the modem world, but in particular our key message and the message I<br />
will be delivering in the speech that I will be making tomorrow is that we<br />
live now in a world of massive economic, technological and social change<br />
and it is the Left to Centre parties that are best able to cope with that world<br />
of change because we are willing to plan and invest and organise our<br />
societies in order to cope with that. And if we fail to do that, the result is<br />
massive insecurity and it is providing security through a process of change<br />
which is what the modem agenda for the Left of Centre is all about.<br />
J: Would that be the reason for what happened in Queensland this weekend,<br />
a massive insecurity in the community, they want to see a differentiation<br />
between Labor and the Coalition<br />
TB: I like the link, but I really don't know that that is for me to comment upon.<br />
J: You seem to be widely regarded as almost a certainty for the next Prime<br />
Minister of Britain and yet we have seen here on the weekend once again,<br />
a very unpredicted result, an unpredicted bad result for Labor in<br />
Queensland, does that sort of thing make you nervous?<br />
TB: As people back home know, I am the eternal warrior against complacency<br />
and I don't take anything for granted at all. It is very nice when people tell<br />
me about opinion polls and all the rest of it, but the only things that decide<br />
general elections are general elections and that is why the British Labour<br />
Party carries on working to deepen that bond of trust that it is establishing.<br />
But we take nothing for granted and we work from now right until election<br />
day.<br />
J: You are both going onto Rupert Murdoch's conference, one of the things<br />
you have in common unusually for Leaders of the Left is that Mr Murdoch<br />
seems to like you both.<br />
PJK: Once you get to know us you can't help but like us.<br />
J: How important was his endorsement for you as a factor of your winning the<br />
last general election? Can I also then ask, how important is it for Tony<br />
Blair to try to get a similar sort of endorsement for Labour at the next<br />
election in Britain?<br />
PJI( I think all Labor parties ever ask for and I'm sure this is the case for the<br />
British Labour Party is equality of treatment. The chance to disseminate<br />
one's message nothing more, nothing less. No one needs preference or<br />
asks for it. We have never had It and we were not endorsed by the News<br />
Corporation at the last election. In fact the majority of their papers came </p>
<p>out against us. But, I think, parties which are better win if they are able to<br />
transmit their message. And, I think, the very things that Tony Blair has<br />
mentioned about economic efficiency and social equity, these things make<br />
our country stronger and having a set of values which the public can<br />
identify with once they know what the policy structure is and the policy mix<br />
is, they can make their mind up. Let me say about this country, what we<br />
look for here most is dare I say it news. Our papers are too loaded with<br />
opinions and what we need here is a straight recitation of the news. If we<br />
can get that, then on that sort of wicket we can win. As News Corporation<br />
goes we are seeing, both of us, the News Corporation executives from<br />
around the world who meet every three years mostly in North America or in<br />
Europe, it happen&amp; to be here on this occasion. You are talking to people<br />
who are running media organisations in three continents, probably four<br />
soon, and it Is a good opportunity to say, in our case where Australia is,<br />
where it is going, how we see the Asia Pacific, why we think News<br />
Corporation has done well to have its head quarters here and to generally<br />
pick up some of their views too about the way' international<br />
telecommunications are going, the way the information highway is<br />
developing. I think it will be an interesting occasion.<br />
J: Mr Blair, will you be laying down any base lines as far as the media is<br />
concerned?<br />
TB: In the speech tomorrow, we will be setting out how we believe the Left of<br />
Centre can best respond to the massive economic, social and<br />
technological change and, of course, part of that is media and<br />
communications. But that is not all and what Is absolutely essential is to<br />
show how we can provide the best security and stability economically and<br />
socially during this era of change. And that includes the media, but Is not<br />
limited to it.<br />
J: But will you set up principles if you like, when you say this is what I believe<br />
in as far as the media is concerned?<br />
TB: Of course, and we wAIl be doing that but we will be doing many other things<br />
as well. I think what is absolutely essential, the great task of all modern<br />
governments and why I believe that today's Labour Party is best able to<br />
achieve this is that we have to show how in this era of change,<br />
revolutionary change, that is sweeping the world in technology, in media,<br />
in communications, in terms of economic challenge we have got to show<br />
how we can best meet that challenge and guide our people through it and<br />
that can only be done by a government that understands the importance of<br />
allying a strong and prosperous economy with a fair and decent society.<br />
J: And regulating the market or not?<br />
TB: Of course, but that is only part of what is a much, much bigger picture. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, do you think that the columnists in newspapers are inherently<br />
conservative?<br />
PJK: No, it is just that they are full of views end 1 am one of those old fashioned<br />
people who was brought up on newspapers where journalists actually<br />
reported news and that is what I think is the best sort of journalism. But<br />
we have now got around to, of course, where journalists interview other<br />
journalists on radio and television programs.<br />
J: When you were a young back bencher in 1972, there was a similar of<br />
the Labor Party then which is occurring what advice would you offer in<br />
the way of<br />
PJK: I don't think Mr Blair needs my advice on these things. Again, I repeat my<br />
point and I would be surprised if it wasn't his, that is without a handicap<br />
that is being able to disseminate one's message Labor parties can look<br />
after themselves very nicely thank you very much. Labor parties don't<br />
need preference or bias, they just need a straight go, but one of things<br />
which gives us a better go all of us is, of course, the diversity in the<br />
media. This is true in Australia where we now have much greater diversity<br />
than 10 years or so ago and the information highway itself holds out the<br />
prospect of much greater diversity than we have ever had, allowing people<br />
to take their news where they want it and not to have it wholesale or<br />
filtered for them. I think, this diversity of Information in media is a very<br />
democratic process and must be good for parties like ours.<br />
J: Can I ask Mr Blair the message he has got for British people living in<br />
Australia who are on the other side of the world when changes take place<br />
in Britain.<br />
TB: There are really three reasons for me being here. First, it is important to<br />
build that relationship between Australia and Britain which is of Immense<br />
importance both to trade and to foreign policy links between us. Second, of<br />
course, it gives me the opportunity to address possibly the largest media<br />
organisaton in the world and put the Labour Party's case there. Thirdly,<br />
there are in some estimates, as many as a quarter of a million people living<br />
here who have the right to vote In a British general election. Now, that Is a<br />
pretty important constituency and we want to make sure our message gets<br />
through to them. Thank you.<br />
PJK: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
