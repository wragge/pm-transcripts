PRIME MINISTER 1149193<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P . J KEATING MP<br />
The Australian Government welcomes the Joint Declaration on Ireland issued<br />
by the British Prime Minister, Mr Major, and the Irish Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds,<br />
on 15 December.<br />
The Government believes that the Declaration offers all parties in Ireland a<br />
new opportunity to establish a solid basis for understanding and trust within<br />
the Island and with the United Kingdom. Peace in Ireland can only be built on<br />
such understanding and trust.<br />
The Government hopes that all parties will now work for a renunciation of<br />
violenc" 3 and for peaceful reconciliation.<br />
Australia's support for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland has been<br />
shown in the past by Sir Ninian Stephen's chairmanship of the political talks<br />
on Northern Ireland.<br />
We continue to be ready to offer what support we usefully can to the process.<br />
