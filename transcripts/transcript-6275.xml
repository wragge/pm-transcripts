TRANSCRIPT Or NEWS CONFERENCE, AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSION,<br />
NEW DELHI, 24/ 11/ 83, MR. HAWKE, MR. LEE KUAN YEW, MR.<br />
GHAZALI SHAFFIE<br />
PM: Well Gentlemen, Lee Kuan Yew and Mr. Dhanablan and I<br />
have had a very useful discussion over lunch and I think<br />
I can say from the point of view of the Australian Government<br />
that any -let -me use words carefully any degree of<br />
misunderstanding that there may have been has been eliminated<br />
and we have a clear understanding of the commionality of our<br />
basic position in regard to Kampuchea, as indeed to our<br />
attitudes to the region generally.<br />
LEE: I would subscribe to what Bob Hawke has said. I think<br />
his has been a good lunch meeting. The food was agreeable<br />
too and what is much more important is that we think we see<br />
the broad picture more or less the same way which is more<br />
important than just resolving this minor difficulty. It<br />
doesn't mean we are not going to have hiccups from time to<br />
time. You are an open society. We are fairly robust in our<br />
reaction, but there are no as far as I: can make out, unless<br />
we have been deceitful to each other there are no hidden<br />
traps. We are not out to do things which you would object<br />
to, nor are the Australians out to have a settlement which we<br />
would find difficult to live with.<br />
JOURNALIST: So the row is over. Is that a good summary?<br />
LEE: This row is over, yes. I think this was never a row<br />
anyway. I mean Mr. Dhanabalan can assure you that he never<br />
intended this as any examination.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give us an example of minor differences<br />
wih you still have?<br />
LEE: I don't really want to go into specifics. The plain<br />
fact is there is a sum body of opinion in Australia to which<br />
the Prime Minis -ter alluded which feels that anything to do<br />
with Pol Pot is untouchable. We have explained to the Prime<br />
Minister that we are not fans, but we've got to live with<br />
the world as we find them. We find we've found only Son Sann<br />
and Sihanouk and they've got to live with Pol Pot and<br />
Sihanouk's had his children murdered by Pol Pot and he's still<br />
got to be in this coalition government so there are complex<br />
reasons why, despite our loathine, we've got to live with the<br />
coalition government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Lee, do you agree with the Australian position<br />
that there are great dangers involved in the isolation of<br />
Vietnam? LEE: I don't believe that anybody can isolate Vietnam if she<br />
dosn't want to be isolated. They are the world's best<br />
communicators. They've had 1945 they fought against the<br />
French. They spoke to the French people over the hea-1s of the<br />
French Government. They fought against the Americains. They.<br />
spoke to the Americans over the heads of the American Covernment.<br />
We V. 7U Id neve r 6 no ami of preven1t n t -lfl, mlPF m f f </p>
<p>I think our great strength in this particular case has been<br />
that they have got bad intentions to try and hide from the<br />
world. That's why they can't conmmunicate.<br />
GHAZALI: to this particular point. As soon as the<br />
American withdrawal took place unaware in these countries<br />
that went to Vietnam offered technical help so you can be<br />
sure that the whole exercise in order to resolve the<br />
Kampuchean question is precisely not to allow Vietnam to be<br />
isolated.<br />
HAWKE: Could I jus. t make the point that I made in Bangkok<br />
that those of the Australian contingent would be aware. I made<br />
it clear that we were not putting it that it was the ASEAN<br />
countries which had isolated Vietnam. It was an act of free<br />
choice on their part as to how they would conduct their affairs.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was there any discussion at all about a peace<br />
mission in the area?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Lee, could I ask you another question on<br />
Grenada. If you wouldn't mind describing the feeling within<br />
the delegates today over the question. Am I right to presume<br />
that it is becoming a very thorny question?<br />
LEE: I think we are anxious to get back on time at 3 o'clock<br />
because the debate was just warming up. I have no doubts<br />
this afternoon that issues will be There are people with<br />
very strong views on the subject and deep and abiding interests<br />
because they live in the region. I'm going to look forward to<br />
listening to the arguments. I'm quite sure that sane, rational<br />
men do not do insane, irrational things. </p>
