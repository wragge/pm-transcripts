<p>  The official programme will commence in Canberra on 7 November and finish in Perth on 12 November. Their Majesties will also visit Sydney, Adelaide and Yulara.</p>
<p> Their Majesties will meet a number of Australians involved in research and technological advancements in areas of interest to them including the fields of medicine, health care, the environment and in industry.</p>
<p>From Yulara Their Majesties will visit the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park where they will view the iconic Australian landmark and also learn of the association of the land with the Aboriginal people and about indigenous culture more generally.</p>

<p> Australia and Sweden enjoy a longstanding and warm friendship, underpinned by our people-to-people contacts and close cooperation on a range of fields.
