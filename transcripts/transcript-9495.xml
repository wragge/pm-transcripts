TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RAY MARTIN, A CURRENT AFFAIR, CHANNEL NINE<br />
27 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
RM: Would you agree that we have wasted, let's say, $ 232 million in the<br />
last five years as has been alleged?<br />
PM: Well, if statistics are the measure, the answer to that is yes, but we<br />
have quite dramatically improved the mortality rates of children.<br />
RM: There was a baby die of dysentery just up the track here a week ago.<br />
It didn't even make the papers. There was a baby die of meningitis<br />
two weeks ago, didn't make the papers. It is just taken for granted,<br />
who cares?<br />
PM: Well, I think, we care. You care and I care for a start. I think lots of<br />
Australians care.<br />
RM: Certainly Aborigines have to care, that is why they flew in from the<br />
bush. More planes than this little dirt strip has ever handled. And,<br />
they stood waiting in the rain for the big fella, like a water colour. Mr<br />
Keating is clearly more relaxed small talking to kids and soaking up a<br />
bit of culture. Despite 12 years of Labor doing next to nothing for<br />
Aboriginal health, everybody was polite and very grateful.<br />
GRAB: Thank you for coming here. We are all happy to see you<br />
here and happy to have you here.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
RM: They say there is only one bloke who can change this and that is you.<br />
PM: Well, I thank them for their faith in me. I will do my best. </p>
<p>RM: Are you conscious of that responsibility, because they have had<br />
politicians promise all kinds of things tell them they have got to get<br />
healthy.<br />
RM: This is why land, I think, we know the history of Mabo, we are now<br />
introducing the Land Fund Bill to let Aboriginal people buy back land. I<br />
think land gives them empowerment, the opportunity of a traditional<br />
lifestyle and whenever they have a traditional lifestyle the diabetes<br />
drops, the state of their mind improves, the diet improves, the health<br />
improves. But, I think we have then got to move on these issues on<br />
environmental health like for instance, the state of the sewerge<br />
systems, the state of their general water supplies, most of them live-on<br />
bore water, they don't actually have town water. They don't have<br />
storages, they don't have dams.<br />
RM: But this is hundreds of millions of dollars are you prepared to commit<br />
that?<br />
PM: Well, I think we are prepared to commit that which can be spent in a<br />
strategy which is co-ordinated and sensible. That is, one that works.<br />
RM: But let's just say that I'm a father of two children, and I live in one of<br />
these outback towns in Australia, and I see my mother has gone blind,<br />
and my father is about to go blind, and I have got diabetes, and the<br />
kids have got dysentery, and you're talking about " hopefully the States<br />
will do something for us".<br />
PM: No,<br />
RM: We're going to be dead before the State's do something for us.<br />
PM: No. I'm not saying that we sit back and let the States do it I'm saying<br />
that we all have to join in on the problem. I mean...<br />
RM: But isn't it time for a shake-up? I thought that's what you had been<br />
saying, that the time has come now to change the way we do it?<br />
PM: I think that's right I think we do have to change the way we do it.<br />
What is the catalyst for the change? The involvement of the<br />
community themselves. I think their willingness to be in it means that<br />
there is some basis for the rest of us taking a different look, and a new<br />
approach to it.<br />
RM: But you know State Governments they're going to look where the<br />
votes are? They will look up into Cape York and they will say " not too<br />
many votes up there a bunch of Aboriginal people. Right then, let's<br />
put the $ 100 million down into Brisbane, or lets put it in Sydney, or lets<br />
put it somewhere else". </p>
<p>PM: There is a sub-division which is out of a provincial town a suburb of a<br />
provincial town, somebody puts in a 10 acre sub-division there will be<br />
a water line out there in double-jig time. There will be the sewerage<br />
line out there, there will be the road the works. If it is an Aboriginal<br />
community, which has been in the same location for 50 years, there's<br />
nothing.<br />
RM: So, what are you going to do?<br />
PM: You have either got to encourage them to do it, pay them to do it,<br />
shame them into doing it a combination of all these things.<br />
RM: The political experts will tell me that there are no votes in Aborigines in<br />
Australia, so I presume that you are not doing it for votes?<br />
PM: It's done because it should be done.<br />
RM: Because you're committed to it?<br />
PM; Because it's a stain on our community to have this, that's why.<br />
RM: I could sit here and say " well, you have been in Government for 12<br />
years you have been Prime Minister for a couple of years how long<br />
do you want? Twelve years not enough? Do you want 20 years?"<br />
PM: That criticism is valid, except I think you have got to see we have<br />
got to get back to this thing about the division of responsibilities in the<br />
Federation to try and get that division better.<br />
RM: Is there more money for the Aborigines in the Budget?<br />
PM: That will depend on whether we think we can spend it wisely, quickly,<br />
and how we can wind programs up.<br />
RM: So, maybe?<br />
PM: Maybe. Probably.<br />
ends. </p>
