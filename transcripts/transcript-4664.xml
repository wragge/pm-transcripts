FOR PRESS 2 APRIL 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The current debate in Australia about the integration of<br />
migrants into our society is a most healthy sign. It<br />
demonstrates an increasing awareness of the complex human<br />
problems that are evolving in our multi-cultural society.<br />
Of course, it also helps to highlight the significant and<br />
lasting contribution the migrant community has made to our<br />
national development and of the role it will continue to play.<br />
I believe governments have a special obligation to migrants.<br />
They have a responsibility for keeping in touch with all<br />
community aspiration and needs, but this is all the more<br />
acute where language and cultural differences make<br />
communication more difficult.<br />
We are aware of the special problems that this can cause for<br />
migrants as they seek to build a life for themselves and<br />
their families in all parts of Australia. That is one of<br />
the reasons we recently decided that ethnic liaison officers<br />
senior public servants already working in Government policy<br />
areas would be appointed in all Commonwealth departments<br />
and agencies whose programs and services affect the lives<br />
of migrants.<br />
I have asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,<br />
Mr. McKellar, to proceed urgently with the setting up of this<br />
structure and I am pleased with the work already done.<br />
The ethnic liaison officers will fulfill a vital public service<br />
role. They will be charged with the responsibility to make<br />
sure that all Government services are geared to respond to the<br />
special needs of migrants. More particularly, we wish to make<br />
sure that migrants have equal access to, and information on, the<br />
great variety of services provided through the Commonwealth<br />
Government. On top of that, these officers will have the major task of<br />
considering all policy proposals against the background of the<br />
public impact they may have on migrant communities. They will<br />
be required to report regularly on their findings in relation<br />
to their own Department's performance. / 2 </p>
<p>I have called for regular advice on how this initiative is<br />
proceeding and the Chairman of the Public Service Board will<br />
report to me after the initial 12 months period.<br />
The first meeting of the ethnic liaison officers was held<br />
recently. It was attended by some 40 senior officers and<br />
was addressed by the Chairman of the Australian Ethnic Affairs<br />
Council, Professor Zubrzycki.<br />
This undertaking to provide ethnic liaison officers was an<br />
election promise and I will be keeping a close personal<br />
interest on its progress.<br />
The Government is concerned to maximize the effectiveness of<br />
all of our post arrival programs and services for migrants.<br />
We are aware of the significant changes in recent years in<br />
migrant needs and aspirations. For that reason we established<br />
the Galbally Enquiry which I expect to report to the<br />
Government within the next few weeks.<br />
We expect there will be recommendations in many areas,<br />
including initial settlement programs, education, communication<br />
including interpreting and translating and community<br />
based activity through ethnic organisations and resource<br />
centres. This report will be considered by the Government as<br />
a matter of urgency.<br />
meanwhile, initiatives such as the establishment of ethnic<br />
liaison officers in departments provide evidence of the<br />
Government's desire to make sure our migrant community enjoy<br />
their full rights and benefits.<br />
I sought Mr. Galbally's advice on the proposal and functions of<br />
ethnic liaison officers. He supported the proposal and<br />
believed migrants would welcome it.<br />
Australia is a richer and greater country because of the varied<br />
ethnic influences in almost every aspect of our daily life.<br />
As a nation we do owe a debt to our migrant friends.<br />
Continued Government concern and involvement in the welfare of<br />
the migrant community is a responsibility we are determined<br />
to fulfill. 000---</p>
