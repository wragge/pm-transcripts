TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MW<br />
LUNCH HOSTED BY LEADING JAPANESE BUSINESS<br />
ORGANISATIONS, TOKYO<br />
IMO E 00<br />
I am very pleased to be here today addressing major representatives of Japanese<br />
business including some old friends.<br />
The Australia-Japan rpartnershiD<br />
A gathering like this underscores for me the special character of the Australia-<br />
Japan association. It is a remnaflcble partnership. And I would like to<br />
acknowledge before this audience the role of the private sector in laying the<br />
foundations of this partnership.<br />
Both Australia and Japan owe a great debt to the vision and commitment of the<br />
Japanese business executives and their Australian counterparts who<br />
pioneered the resources trade in the decades after World War 1I.<br />
They laid the foundations of a trading relationship that fueled Japan's economic<br />
miracle in the 1960s and 1970s. It is a relationship that-is stfil vitally important<br />
to Japan's continued growth and to Australia's prosperity.<br />
It is also a relationship that has had a sigificance beyond its bilateral character.<br />
Because of its importance to Japan as the largest economy in the region, its<br />
dimensions and its reliability, this trading relationship is one of the great sinews<br />
of economic interdependence in the region as a whole. Faro m19/ 09/ 96 17: 46 Pg: 3 </p>

Austr-flia trades more with Japan than we do with any other country. In 1995, a<br />
quarter of Anstrnilia's merchandise exports and a fifth of our services exports<br />
went to Japan.<br />
From Japan's point of view, we are its fourth largest source of imports. We are<br />
its largest supplier of energy apart from oil.<br />
Our economic relationship has now become much more diverse. Australia is<br />
exporting more services, manufactures and processed foodstuffs to Japan as the<br />
Japanese market has opened up. As exports of manufactures and services grow,<br />
small businesses are becoming increasingly engaged.<br />
Japan is the third largest foreign investor in Australia with a current stock<br />
worth around $ 50 billion. It may surprise some of you to hear that nearly<br />
per cent of Japanese inveslunent flows to Australia in the past three -years have<br />
been to the manufacturing sector. In 1995, Australia was the fourth largest<br />
destination in the world for Japan's foreign direct investmnt<br />
Our relationship of course, Ladies and Gentlemen, goes well beyond the<br />
economic. Australia and Japan increasingly have similar strategic interests.<br />
Both of us are inextricably tied economically and strategically to Asia. But<br />
neither of us takes a narrow or inward-looking view of our region or one that<br />
excludes others.<br />
Japan and Australia both see their wider international links as bringing<br />
something positive to the region. We both see our relationships with the United<br />
States, in particular, as vital to the economic growth and to the stability of our<br />
region. Hence, we both see APEC as a key framework for cooperation-<br />
We also share an interest in the closest possible engagement of China in<br />
regional and global affairs as a responsible partner. Hence, we would both<br />
like to see China become a member of the World Trade Organisation on<br />
reasonable terns.<br />
The scale of human contact between our societies is now very large. Nearly<br />
800,000 Japanese tourists visited in 1995. In the same year, nearly 80,000<br />
Australians came to Japan. Six thousand Japanese students are in Australia,<br />
while 1,000 Australians are studying in Japan.<br />
So out of a trading relationship begun in more difficult times has grown a<br />
strong economic and strategic partnership between our two countries and a<br />
genuine friendship between our communities.<br />
The purpose of my -visit is to assure you that my Government is strongly<br />
committed to advancing Australia's partnership and friendship with Japan. I<br />
see a dynamic partnership as serving Australia's and Japan's needs well into<br />
the next century. I see it also as makcing a crucial contribution to the prosperity<br />
and the stability of our region. Farxft 19/ 09/ 96 17: 46 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>The new Australian Government<br />
I am conscious Mrt Chairman that a change of government after 13 years will<br />
inevitably arouse interest. Let me say that my Giovernment does have different<br />
views on some issues from our predecessors. And I want to say something<br />
about that in a minute.<br />
But first I want to reiterate that I and my Government welcome the progress<br />
made in the relationship with Japan under Mr Keating's government and under<br />
preceding Australian governments. Successive Australian governments from<br />
both sides of politics have made a contribution to building Japan and<br />
Austi-alia' s relationship.<br />
The foundation stone of the modem economic relationship between Australia<br />
an~ d Japan was of course put down by the late Sir John McEwen as Deputy<br />
Prime Minister in a Liberal/ Country' Party Government and the then Japanese<br />
Foreign Minister, Mr Kihi, in the formulation of the Australia-Japan<br />
Commerce Agreement in 1957-<br />
1 would like to say somethig about the differnt policy perspectives of the new<br />
Government because they are important and I believe will benefit our<br />
partnership with Japan especially as they will make Australia's economy more<br />
competitive and capable of sustaining growth in the longer term,<br />
Australia's economy:, the challene<br />
The key policy questions facing both Australia and Japan along with many<br />
other developed economies are similar. Those questions include how best to<br />
generate sustainable growth; how far should government intervene in the<br />
economy, and how to lower unemployment*<br />
Australia and Japan also need to ask how we can best promote continued<br />
growth in our region. In the case of Japan, it is good news for all of us that the<br />
Japanese economy is now beginning to grow more strongly.<br />
My government in March inherited an economny that was growing well with<br />
relatively low inflatiou-It grew by over 4 per cent in 1995-96 and is expected<br />
to continue to grow by about 3 V2pzer cent in the current fispal year.<br />
During the next eighteen months Australia is expectcd to grow faster thani any<br />
member of the 07 and to be one of the half-dozen fastest growing countries i<br />
the OECD. Inflation is low and should. fall to round 2 per cent by the middle<br />
of next year.<br />

But my Gonvemment also inherited an economy with some pressing structural<br />
problems. The most important were the problem of national savings, the lack<br />
of flexibility and competitiveness of Australia's labour market, and the<br />
constraints on small business,<br />
If these problems are not addressed growth in Australia ' will not reach its full<br />
potential, and we won't be able to reduce unemployment.<br />
And these are the problems therefore that my Government's reform agenda<br />
will tackle.<br />
The role of government<br />
Central to my approach is our view that government works best when it<br />
supports people and business rather than ties them down in regulations and<br />
bureaucracy. Government still has an important role to play at a strategic level. My<br />
Government is certainly not driven by any blind ideological imperative to slash<br />
the role of government for its own sake.<br />
But the best contribution government can make is to lay down macro-economic<br />
and micro-economic policies which create the conditions for business to thrive.<br />
he budget<br />
With this in mind, our first priority has been to get the budget in order.<br />
We have cut $ 3.9 billion from the underlying deficit in this financial year and<br />
cut $ 7.2 billion by 1997-98, bringing the budget into underlying surplus in<br />
1998-99.<br />
Government outlays will drop nearly 2 per cent from 27.2 per cent of GDP<br />
last year to 25.4 per cent in 1997-99, the lowest level since 1989-90.<br />
Increased national saving will help find investment, reduce pressure on the<br />
current account deficit and interest rates, and enable Australia to sustain higher<br />
rates of economic and employment growth.<br />
My Government has also committed itself to a number of measures which will<br />
make fiscal and monetary policy more transparent, This will improve the<br />
quality of policy formulation and the degree of accountability of the<br />
Govcrnment's performance.<br />
We will legislate for a Charter of Budget Honesty. Amongst other things the<br />
Charter will require the government of the day to publish an official budget<br />
update at the beginning of each federal election campaign. 19/ 69/ 96 17: 46 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>We have also announced an agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia<br />
which reinforces the Bank's independence and the shared commitment of the<br />
Government and the Bank to an underlying inflation target of 2 to 3 per cent,<br />
on average, over the economic cycle.<br />
Industrial relations<br />
My Government importantly is also committed to reforming Australia's<br />
industrial relations system.<br />
Our agenda for industtial relations reform is far-reaching and responsible. It<br />
builds on the shift towards enterprise bargaining1 which business and unions<br />
have supported. It will produce a more efficient and a more flexible labour<br />
market. Under a new system of workplace agreements, employers and employees will<br />
be able to enter into agreements on either an individual or collective basis.<br />
Wages and conditions will be determined as far as possible in the workplace,<br />
within a safety -net of minimum conditions and without the involvement of<br />
uniions unless the employees want them involvedL<br />
Inesponsible industrial action will also be minimised by guaranteeing genuine<br />
freedom of choice for employees as to whether they belong to a union.<br />
Penalties against unlawful industrial artion will be bolstered, including for<br />
industrial action against companies not directly involved in a dispute.<br />
The Australian community, understands the need for change in labour relations.<br />
People understand the costs to the economy of uncompetitive labour practices.<br />
Practical reform in industrial relations is absolutely necessary if we are to<br />
increase job creation and reduce unemployment. Higher productivity will lift<br />
economic growth and create new economic opportunities for all businesses,<br />
large and small.<br />
I am confident that our policies will engender more cooperation between<br />
employers and employees and a greater sense of shared interest in the success<br />
of particular enterprises.<br />
Improving competitgveptess 2nd reducing re3LlatiOns<br />
My Government is also committed to mak~ ing Australia's transport,<br />
communications and other infrastucture more internationally competitive.<br />

<p>Fax from -6-<br />
A nntional elcctricity market wvill be established in which power retailers can<br />
compete. The remaining barriers to free and fair trade between the states of<br />
Australia in nata4 gas will be dismantled. These steps will greatly improve<br />
the prospects for ventures in mining and minerals processing in remote and<br />
regional Australia.<br />
We will sell one third of Tcistra, our national telecomnmunications carrier. We<br />
will privatise federal airports through the sale of long-term leases. And we will<br />
encourage greater private participation in rail services.<br />
A task force is currently reviewing business regulations in order to fulfill my<br />
Government's commitment to reduce red tape for small business by 50 per cent<br />
in our first term in office.<br />
My government recently established an independent review of Australia's<br />
financial system to ensure that our regulatory arrangements are as modemn and<br />
cost-effective as possible.<br />
I believe that these reforms will reduce the costs of doing business in Australia.<br />
They will make Australia more competitive and a more attractive partner for<br />
Japan and for your companies and your institutions.<br />
Last week, my Government announced a Supermarket to Asia CounciL This<br />
Council. which I shall chair includes sectorai ministers, farmers, the transport<br />
industry, the food-processing industry, the packaging industry, the distribution<br />
and retail industry, oir national scientific research body, and a representative of<br />
the union movement.<br />
Its aim is to remove unnecessary regulations and generally improve the<br />
effectiveness of the food export chain from production on the Australian farm<br />
through to distribution into the Asian retail outlet<br />
Japan has undertaken significant steps to open its markets. This has led to<br />
increased market opportunities for countries like Australia in areas such as<br />
housing and construction, processed food and information technology.<br />
Australia is conscious that it will only succeed in taking advantage of new<br />
openings if we are a ful~ ly competitive nation. But there are still areas where<br />
we would like to see further liberalisation and deregulation in Japan, including<br />
in the agricultural sector.<br />
Finally and importantly. we in Australia know that living cheek-by-jowl with<br />
the fastest growing economic region in the world is no automatic guarantee of<br />
economic prosperity, success or market access. We must compete effectively<br />
in order to take advantage of that geographic prornixity. Fa rom19/ 09/ 96 17: 46 Pg: 8 </p>

AklEC I mentioned earlier the importance to both A'uvTalia and Japan of doing what<br />
they can to support continued growth in the wider region as well as at home.<br />
Last year at the Osaka APEC leaders' meeting, Japan demonstrated her<br />
credentials to regional economic leadership. That meeting set out a blueprint<br />
for implementing the goal leaders had set the year before in Bogor.-free and<br />
open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010/ 2020-<br />
My Government is committed to APEC and its free-trade goal. I look forward<br />
to discussing the forthcomi~ ng leaders meeting with Mr Hashimoto tomorrow<br />
and to exploring how I can cooperate with him in consolidatinig APEC.<br />
The fact is that economic srowth in East Asia beginning with Japan's own<br />
spectacular experience in the 1960s has relied to large extent on finding open<br />
markets for its exports. We cannot simply assume that markets wilt. become<br />
more open or even stay as open as they are now.<br />
There will always be pressures in Australia, Japan and elsewhere to slow the<br />
pace of liberalisation and deregulation. I understand those pressures and the<br />
social and political considerations behind them<br />
APEC offers the opportunity to help balance the short-term costs of domestic<br />
structural adjustment by improving access to export markets and by easing the<br />
burden on consu~ mers. APEC also helps maximise the benefits of liberalisation.<br />
The greater the number of economies that liberalise together, the greater the<br />
beneit to each-<br />
But for the process to work it is important that all APEC economies contribute<br />
to liberalisation and that all sectors of the economy are involved.<br />
As you know, each APEC couny must produce an individual action plan<br />
setting out how it intends to achieve the free-trade goal. These plans, I believe,<br />
must include substantial trade liberalising and facilitating measures that will<br />
bring concrete benefits to our business communities. They should go beyond<br />
existing Uruguay Round commitments.<br />
I think business should play more of a role in evaluating the progress of a-ade<br />
liberalisation in APEC. One practical way of doin this would be for the<br />
A2PEC Business Advisory Council to provide an independent report to APEC<br />
m Isters on the individual action plans.<br />
With substantial progress towards the Bogor target, APEC leaders can credibly<br />
urge the World Trade Organisation to agree on goals at its inaugural ministerial<br />
meeting in Singapore in December that will generate a renewed sense of<br />
purpose in global trade negotiations. Fafr~ i19/ 69/ 96 17: 46 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax from -8-<br />
This is important to help prevent the world from frapnenting into in protective<br />
regional trading 3rrangements. Neither Japan nor Australia is part of a trading<br />
bloc. We share the very strongest interest in the success of APEC and in the<br />
strengthening of the WTO.<br />
APEC members could also look at steps to accelerate liberalisation. At the<br />
recent APEC energy ministers' meeting in Sydney I proposed that APEC<br />
economies consider achieving free trade in primary energy by, for example, the<br />
year 2000. Bringing forward the target for free trade in primary energy would<br />
boost regional growth and make it much easier to find the enormous private<br />
sector funding needed to build the required infrastructure,<br />
Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I have appreciated very much your hospitality today. On my first visit to Japan<br />
as Prime Minister I am indeed privileged to have had the opportunity to speak<br />
to you.<br />
I chose to come to Japan in the first seven months of my Prime Ministership<br />
quite deliberately.<br />
I did it to demonstrate the ongoing commirnent of my government and of the<br />
people of Australia to the strong relationship, the deep and mature relationship,<br />
the remarkable relationship that does exist between Japan and the Japanese<br />
people and Australia and the Australian people.<br />
I wanted to convey to you some of the messages both about continuity and<br />
about change.<br />
There is continuity about the commitment of Australia and the Australian<br />
people to our relationship with your country and your people. There is also<br />
inevitably, and naturally and properly, in the democratic process an agenda for<br />
change now that a new government has been elected in Australia.<br />
I want to say to you that I bring the goodwill of the government of Australia, I<br />
bring the goodwill of the people of Australia, and I want to conclude by again<br />
thanking those people in the business community here in Japan and back home<br />
in Australia who from very small beginnings have built a great economic<br />
partnership a partnership built on mutual advantage and co-operation, and a<br />
partnership that has brought the two nations and the peoples of those two<br />
nations very close as we move together towards the next millenium. 19/ 09/ 96 17: 46 Pg: </p>
