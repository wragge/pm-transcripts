PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT FUNDRAISING LUNCH, THE VALLEY RESTAURANT,<br />
FAULCONBRIDGE, 30 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you so much, and thank you for so many of you coming. It has been a<br />
very, very pleasant day indeed to be here, and to be in the Mountains, and to<br />
have the opportunity of planting a tree at Faulconbridge with the line of oaks<br />
the Corridor of Oaks which are a symbol, I think, of our continuity of the<br />
Prime Ministership over the period since the Federation in 1901. And I am<br />
particularly pleased to be there today with the Mayor, with my parliamentary<br />
colleague Maggie Deahm, with Minister Bob Debus. I am particularly<br />
delighted that Margaret Free could join us today, and other distinguished<br />
guests, including the Chancellor and members of Local Government. It has<br />
been a very nice occasion, and I am pleased to have been able to make that<br />
link, again, between the Federation and Henry Parkes, and the things for<br />
which my Party has been interested in, and the things for which we have<br />
stood for a very long period of time. And particularly this link with Macquarie<br />
with Chifley, of course, being Member for Macquarie and Prime Minister, I<br />
have even got a link myself because I have been the Member for Blaxland<br />
since 1969, a bit tenuous, but there we are better than being the Member for<br />
something else.<br />
And in this, I think I was saying earlier, for those of you who weren't there<br />
that here we are now, a century on, thinking about our nationalism again.<br />
And I just reminded people of the great decade of nationalism and social<br />
experimentation in Australia it was more than a decade: from the early<br />
1890s until 1914 was the period when the sense of Australia came together.<br />
A period of great difficulty, of economic difficulties, of a very great drought in<br />
the 1 890s, the birth of the Labor Party, and then of course, the Federation.<br />
And then, basically, the First World War snuffed it out, and it only returned<br />
fleetingly again during the period of Curtin's Prime Ministership, and of<br />
course, with Gough Whitlam. And we hope that now, in the 1990s again, we<br />
can where we have had, in some of these economic difficulties, a drought<br />
these things must bring on a renewed sense of Australian nationalism.<br />
Because here we are now, this decade, thinking about that we have to round<br />
the circle off with an Australian Head of State. And it will be when it </p>
<p>happens Australians will feel very good about the fact that an Australian<br />
person is the head of the Australian nation that represents and personifies<br />
the Australian people. So, it was an opportunity to make these points again<br />
to say that, for my part, I was not about simply planting a tree as one of a<br />
series of Prime Ministers, but to plant it for the reason that we round the circle<br />
on Federation, and we cap it off by making clear that we are a unique nation,<br />
the Australian nation, and everything about us is Australian and our Head of<br />
State is Australian.<br />
I was talking earlier, too, about the categories of Australians who believe in<br />
Australia who have faith in Australia, and faith in the Australian people.<br />
And, many of you I know who are students of Australian history, remember<br />
Manning Clarke's division between the enlargers, and the straiteners and<br />
punishers he said that Australians tend to fall into two categories, the<br />
people who believe in something bigger, and greater and grander, and larger<br />
essentially have faith in their fellow Australians to make it, and those who<br />
say this is your place in life, get your nose to the grindstone, conform, and he<br />
said they are the straiteners. And I think, as time goes on, you can see in this<br />
debate again about an Australian republic, people coming out saying yes it<br />
very clear, we are a unique nation, that our Head of State shouldn't be the<br />
Monarchy of another country but there are still those people who say oh no,<br />
you can't let Australians manage themselves. Not quite yet not quite yet.<br />
They are not sure when it is, but not quite yet.<br />
At any rate, we have come a long way together, and I think we have got an<br />
opportunity now we have never had. And that is, one hundred years ago, all<br />
the markets we dealt with, all the people we traded with, were essentially in<br />
Europe, and sometimes in North America. This is the first time in Australian<br />
history the European history of Australia, the non-Aboriginal history of<br />
Australia where we are closest to the fastest growing markets in the world.<br />
So, now on our doorstep are markets growing faster than the traditional<br />
markets we used to have. And the thing I am most pleased about, is that<br />
Australia has set itself up in the last 10 years to be part of that<br />
psychologically, culturally, economically. Because you can't go and say to<br />
old societies like Indonesia 200 million people here we are, we are the<br />
Australians, not the Australians of a White Australia Policy, but a proud<br />
nation, Australians, we relate to you and we have respect for your culture,<br />
and they say show us how you treat your indigenes, and we will show you<br />
how you will treat us. You can't go there without integrity you can't<br />
approach these nations, and be part of this community here without integrity.<br />
That means that we have to come to terms with our own history and bring<br />
our culture, be clear about what our culture is, and who we are as a people<br />
before we can go out and do that. Now, I believe we are doing these things,<br />
and our relationship is such now with Asia I can't believe that at any stage in<br />
our history that we have had a better relatio nship than we have now, whether<br />
it be with Indonesia, or with Vietnam, and two weeks ago I had here the most<br />
distinguished Vietnamese, the General-Secretary of the Vietnamese<br />
Communist Party, who is now turning Vietnam into essentially a market<br />
economy after those years of deprivation. Or last week, where we had the </p>
<p>annual Ministerial Meeting with our Japanese colleagues in this case, the<br />
Minister for International Trade and Industry, Mr Hashimoto, and Mr Kono,<br />
the Foreign Minister. The two most important people in the LODP which is<br />
the Party which has essentially managed Japan all through the post-War<br />
years. I mean, we have got these relationships now, and we are building<br />
them up.<br />
And we can see an interesting life for ourselves an interesting engagement<br />
with this region, a better standard of living, more jobs in Australia, and a<br />
higher level of income for Australians. You compare that to the cloistered<br />
little country we were back in 1983 ring-fenced by tariffs, ring-fenced by a<br />
managed exchange rate. Sitting there, wondering which way to go: our<br />
national income falling, because the things we had relied upon traditionally<br />
wheat, wool, minerals being of much less value, and bringing much lower<br />
prices and sitting there watching the income go down, the debt go up, our<br />
competitiveness shot to pieces, no inner faith and confidence about<br />
ourselves, coming out of a deep recession with very high unemployment and<br />
inflation. I mean, that was the sort of yoke we were in, in 1983.<br />
But, when you look at the progress now here we are, we are clear about our<br />
identity, we pulled the tariff wall down, we have now got import competition<br />
and exports. Yesterday, we had the highest level of exports per month in our<br />
history we are seeing, in today's National Accounts, the inflation rate at<br />
2.1 on the broadest measure of inflation for the year. We have just had<br />
680,000 jobs since the last election can you believe that? 680,000 jobs<br />
since the last election. It took us 200 years to get 6 million people in the<br />
labour market, and we have added 10% of that in 2 1/ 2 years. I mean, it's a<br />
profound change. And today, with today's National Accounts, where we have<br />
another quarter of growth, we have 16 consecutive quarters of growth. The<br />
last time we had 16 consecutive quarters of growth was 25 years ago a<br />
quarter of a century ago. Four straight years of growth, four straight years of<br />
employment, four straight years of getting on top of inflation and giving us<br />
back our economic future. And yet my opponents talk about 5 minutes of<br />
economic sunshine in their cynicism, they talk about 5 minutes of economic<br />
sunshine. It is the longest growth phase in a quarter of a century. And it is<br />
now our opportunity to build on these things, but we have done all of this<br />
together the Government has done it with the Australian people. It has<br />
done it with the Trade Unions we have put it into a consensual model,<br />
where consensus matters. We have said at that Economic Summit way<br />
back there in 1983 that the policies of conflict can't give us the economic<br />
future we wish. That we can't have wage explosions that give workers a short<br />
term wage increase to see it dashed by high inflation a year later. That we<br />
need high investment to get high employment and that we need high<br />
investment to rebuild our capital stock to give us the exports and import<br />
replacement that will generate our wealth.<br />
But, we need to do all of this in the context of inclusion. That is, we are one<br />
nation and we are a nation together and it is not a nation for the high fliers<br />
and the top end of town. It is a nation for everybody and so we said you are </p>
<p>entitled to access and equity in health. You are entitled to access and equity<br />
in education and you can have these things in a country this wealthy and at<br />
the same time the goers who build the businesses can still have their go<br />
becausq the profit share is very high, the tax system, the corporate tax rate is<br />
by western world standards right on the line at about 35 or 36 per cent.<br />
You can do all these things, but we don't have to go for the punishing and<br />
straitening model of tearing people down and building an underclass.<br />
At the last election you might remember me saying we won't leave the<br />
unemployed behind, we won't have an underclass. Not that we might try not<br />
to have an underclass, we won't have an underclass. When I introduced<br />
Working Nation that great social change from the Government last year, that<br />
was directed to the long term unemployed and now we've had since that time,<br />
in these last two and a half years since the election, a quarter of all the jobs<br />
have gone to long term unemployed people. In other words, it is typically the<br />
case in most countries like Australia that the new entrants to the workforce<br />
are the school leavers or the migrants. Those who are long term unemployed<br />
stay out forever and they get marginalised, never to come back. We brought<br />
them back. So, the place is not only more fully employed, but it is happier<br />
and it is more fair.<br />
So, doing it together in a consensual way without a conflict model. It means<br />
that in this country, if you are single or if you are married or you have children<br />
and you wake up and you are sick you have got Medicare there to support<br />
you. Ten years ago three kids in ten completed secondary school. This year<br />
it is eight in ten and we have added about 60 per cent of places to higher<br />
education since the middle 1980s and you can see this by the growth in<br />
higher education and we have the Chancellor here today just to make the<br />
point for us. The reach of higher education and the access for higher<br />
education which we now have.<br />
But, how could we be the smart society that wanted to make the engagement<br />
with Asia, that wanted to sell the clever products and the services and not just<br />
another paddock full of wheat or wool as important as they are but to do<br />
the other things too, the high value added products, the intellectual property,<br />
the services, how could you do it when only three kids in ten completed<br />
secondary school? I mean, what hope did we have?<br />
This is the faith our opponents had in Australia. An elitist higher education<br />
system, an elitist secondary school system. Seven out of ten didn't make it<br />
bad luck. That was their philosophy bad luck, no faith in you. Of course,<br />
never distinguishing the point that so many bright people are the children of<br />
low income parents who make their way and make their change in this<br />
society, but they were marginalised because they were not allowed to take<br />
their place because the great liberator in a society like this is education. And,<br />
it was through this change that we have been able to see the proliferation of<br />
higher education, the regionalisation of higher education, the access to<br />
higher education and now, of course, for that six in ten kids who leave<br />
secondary school who were formerly untrained, we are bringing up the TAFE </p>
<p>system into a national structure to have vocational education sitting out there<br />
beside the universities as a place to educate our children. The children in<br />
the main of working class parents.<br />
Now, that is what inclusion is all about. That is what the consensual model is<br />
all about. So, when you go to the trade unions and say ' give us sensible<br />
wage outcomes and low inflation', we'll give you back high employment,<br />
access to education for your kids, a decent health system and a decent<br />
system of income support and a decent system of income support in old age<br />
with a pension and superannuation. We have got that agreement. That is<br />
what the Accords are all about. If it has worked so well for Australia, why<br />
would you tip it out? Why would you not have it? To go back to industrial<br />
fights so that one strong group can go and pick up a 15 per cent wage<br />
increase at the expense of other lower income groups to find it blows the<br />
inflation rate out of the water twelve months later and they end up with<br />
another three or four percentage points on interest rates. That is what will<br />
happen under our opponents. Were they to win an election, they eschew and<br />
reject any Accord, you would immediately see the unions protect themselves<br />
and go for wage increases. Immediately the Reserve Bank would start<br />
sticking interest rates back up and it wouldn't be by half a percentage point or<br />
one, it would be by three or four or five percentage points. In other words, we<br />
would hold wages down by flattening growth, by flattening the whole<br />
economy. In other words, rather than try to deal with the problem through an Accord or<br />
some consensual arrangement directly, the Coalition would deal with it by<br />
flattening the whole place and you end up like a west European economy. A<br />
low growth economy running at one to two per cent. But, one to two per cent<br />
doesn't provide the jobs. What we have in today's National Accounts is 3.7<br />
per cent growth for the year. You may remember about a year ago it was<br />
running at about six per cent and it was too. strong because we just couldn't<br />
keep the goods and services up to it and the demand for imports was too high<br />
and it went over into the current account and we said we have to slow this<br />
down and we have. And, it has come back from six per cent to a strong,<br />
sustainable 3.7 per cent. In other words, if you look at today's Accounts<br />
figures 3.7 per cent for growth for the year, 2 per cent for inflation and<br />
strong employment growth which we have seen over the course of the year<br />
we have got the economy, at the moment, where we want it. We have got the<br />
economy growing sustainably as I say for four straight years or 16<br />
consecutive quarters.<br />
This didn't happen by accident. It has been put there, not by spin doctors or<br />
smart advertising agents, or smart party secretaries or people passing notes<br />
to ministerial offices or words into the ears of journalists, it happened there by<br />
policy. This all happened by policy. It happened by substance and that is<br />
why we can sit here with our lunch and know that the Australian economy is<br />
growing at a strong sustainable rate. That our core competitiveness has<br />
been protected by low inflation. That those huge export growth figures that<br />
we saw yesterday are going to continue because the model is in place. </p>
<p>Look at the Government's last two major policy statements the Budget and<br />
Accord Mark VIII. The budget took the budget back into surplus. We will be<br />
in surplws now for the rest of the 1 990s. Which means as we need money for<br />
investment and in these National Accounts today, these are strong<br />
investment figures, as we need funds for the investment we will see it come<br />
from the budget surpluses. We will also see it come from that other element<br />
of the budget, national superannuation, where every Australian person by the<br />
year 2002 we are talking about seven years from now will have 15 per cent<br />
being put away for their income supplementation for the rest of their lives.<br />
Which will mean for somebody who is now about to join or just joined the<br />
workforce, they will have an income in retirement equal in today's dollars to<br />
average weekly earnings. In other words, it will be about twice the pension.<br />
But, it will do more than that. It will save trillions of dollars, thousands of<br />
billions of dollars for our long run investment and our long run savings. So,<br />
we don't need to put weight on overseas savings or on overseas debt. That<br />
was the Budget.<br />
A couple of weeks later we introduced Accord Mark VIII. Eight variations of<br />
this since 1983. What did it say? Essentially, that we will have a wages<br />
policy which is enterprise bargaining underpinned by a safety net. If you<br />
don't get anything in the bargain, you get the safety net adjustment to make<br />
sure that you can maintain your standard of living. They are modest safety<br />
net adjustments of around $ 10 per week. Completely affordable in national<br />
economic terms. But, the underpinning commitment which was in there. The<br />
core commitment was that the ACTU and the unions will run the wages<br />
system to produce two to three per cent inflation which is the target of the<br />
Reserve Bank. So, you have got the trade union movement of the country<br />
coming out, endorsing as a policy, the Reserve Bank's inflation target. It is<br />
unheard of in the OECD area, in the western world area. I mean, you don't<br />
find that kind of co-operation in countries they just generally don't have that<br />
willingness, groups in society don't have that willingness to make those sorts<br />
of commitments. Under the consensual model, we have got those sorts of<br />
commitments and those two things, the Budget in surplus, the huge stock of<br />
savings as superannuation and the commitment to low inflation, are the sorts<br />
of things that really matter.<br />
Now I noticed today in the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the barnacles of<br />
the Press Gallery, Alan Ramsey is saying the Government has wasted the<br />
year. The Government has wasted the year. Well have we wasted the year<br />
with 16 quarters of growth, four straight years of growth? Have we wasted<br />
the year with over 400,000 jobs in the last year, or 680,000 since the<br />
election? Have we wasted the year bolting inflation down so that we maintain<br />
our core competitiveness? You know, have we wasted the year giving<br />
Australians, particularly the younger Australians, the notion that in retirement<br />
they will have a standard of living akin to what they will have at work?<br />
You know, have we wasted the year building a stock of savings our<br />
opponents could have only dreamt of? Thousands of billions of dollars. </p>
<p>Can you imagine the whole of the workforce having 15 per cent of their<br />
income put away. That huge cash flow of that coming into national savings.<br />
Instead -of that, what they want us to do is chase down Parliamentary<br />
scandals and so-called, or worry about the sort of froth and bubble of public<br />
life and not the policy. All that matters are the policy changes and I face an<br />
opponent I mean I became Treasurer in 1983 after John Howard had left it<br />
after five years as Treasurer. It was like a dentist going over bad work. You<br />
know where he has done all the cheap jobs. You know, didn't touch the<br />
exchange rate, believed in deregulation but didn't have the bottle, didn't<br />
actually have the horsepower to actually float the dollar, believed in low tariffs<br />
but couldn't knock over the tariff wall, believed in changing the waterfront but<br />
couldn't do it. You know, believed in having a competitor to Telecom and<br />
decent telecommunications services and lower phone prices, but never got<br />
around to it. Left us with 11 per cent unemployment and 11 per cent inflation<br />
and just by the sheer effluxion of time, and as their third choice in this<br />
Parliament, he now says " well after you've spent 12 years of life putting it<br />
back onto an even keel with your colleagues, I think I'll now take over. I will<br />
come back and have a second go at wrecking<br />
Well you see, you have got to say well look have you really got faith in this<br />
country? Do you believe an Australian person should be our head of state?<br />
No, he says " no, I still believe that the monarchy is best for us. Mind you, if I<br />
were the Government, I might give you a referendum on the republic." But at<br />
the referendum, the Government itself, would be in favour of the monarchy.<br />
Oh say, oh that's terrific, thank you very much.<br />
In other words, do you believe " No, I believe that the monarch of<br />
Great Britain should be our head of state." Right. Do you believe that there<br />
are good instincts in the Australian community, that they will come together,<br />
that you can have things like Accords and that you can have, therefore,<br />
higher growth, higher employment growth and a good social wage?<br />
" No, don't believe in Accords, don't believe -there are these good notions<br />
there at all. Believe it is going to be survival of the fittest. If you are<br />
industrially strong, you take your pound of flesh. If you're not, bad luck."<br />
Well, therefore, do you believe in a safety net? " Don't believe in a safety net.<br />
You know, believe in the US system?<br />
And here is the US Labor Secretary, Robert Reich, saying " In America, we<br />
have had some of the highest employment growth in the world. But the army<br />
of working poor in America, the lowest half of the American workforce haven't<br />
had a real wage increase in 16 years." They haven't got beyond inflation in<br />
16 years. In fact, they have wage declines. And I read a statistic last week,<br />
that 70 per cent in the growth of American household income has gone to the<br />
top 10 per cent of households and the bottom 20 per cent of American<br />
households have lost 10 per cent of their income: an unconscionable division<br />
of wealth. That is the sort of thing my opponents believe in. And then they<br />
want to walk around and say " we believe in Australia, we believe in the good<br />
things." I mean they want to take us back to an obscurantist, conflict model </p>
<p>that we left in the late 1970s, early 1980s. And to pass up 16 quarters of<br />
growth and low inflation and linkages into Asia<br />
I said yesterday in the Parliament, I mentioned the General-Secretary of the<br />
Vietnamese Communist Party. He came to Australia the week after Vietnam<br />
was admitted as a full member of ASEAN the Association of South East<br />
Asian Nations, with Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand etc full<br />
member. That was two weeks ago. A week before that, the United States<br />
had diplomatically recognised Vietnam again and they had exchanged<br />
Ambassadors. The day he went home from here, the next day, he saw<br />
Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State in Hanoi. But John Howard<br />
wouldn't see him in Australia because he is still fighting the Vietnam War and<br />
he thinks a few Vietnamese in Western Sydney may not vote for him if he<br />
were seen to be meeting Mr Do Muoi because of their memories of the<br />
settlement of the Vietnamese conflict.<br />
Now how can Australia hand stewardship of its Asia relationship to somebody<br />
who plays these games and who doesn't understand that when you say to<br />
these people a full member of ASEAN, to the leader of the country I will not<br />
meet you or see you, I will snub you. Does he expect to be treated well by<br />
the Thais, or the Malaysians, or the Indonesians, or even the Japanese who<br />
run a western style economy? When Kono and Hashimoto were here last<br />
week, they knew about it, they knew Howard had snubbed him. So these<br />
things go around the region and then expect to say, after winning an election,<br />
for Mr Howard to wander out there, into the Asia Pacific, and say " Here I am.<br />
I believe in the monarchy. I still believe in all the trappings. I would have<br />
knighthoods back, if I had the chance. And just, by the way, I will only talk to<br />
the ones of you who I like."<br />
Now, the thing is we are either in this, or we are not. We are either part of<br />
this community of nations here, or we are not. We either go as a strong<br />
vibrant society and culture, or we don't. We either go there proud of what we<br />
are and what we have become, or we go there as some sort of derivative<br />
society on the back foot. Now these are the issues. But you can't be like that<br />
away from home, if at home you are divisive, you have a conflict model, you<br />
don't bring everybody in and we are all not part of the one nation. You can't<br />
cheat at home and kid people outside. It has got to be genuine right through.<br />
You can't say the Native Title Act is a day of shame. That Mabo is an act of<br />
shame and, at the same time, say to the Asian nations around us, we want to<br />
be part of the community of nations in this part of the world.<br />
So in coming here today to support Maggie, who is a new Member of<br />
Parliament, but a good Member of Parliament. Who is a person of the<br />
community who has faith in Australians and likes them, wants to be with them<br />
and know them and represent them. This is the sort of governing Party<br />
Australia needs, of people like this. Who have a genuine understanding of<br />
community sentiment and see the good things in Australians. Who feel the<br />
good sentiments and the good vibrations and not wanting to put their heads<br />
down and make them keep their place and straighten and punish them and </p>
<p>say " Well, if you are strong you get a big wage increase and if you are weak<br />
bad luck and there is no safety net for you and there is no Medicare for you.<br />
You go out there and put your hand in your pocket and if your kids get sick<br />
you go and pay for it and by the way we only like certain Asians and not<br />
others." I mean this is not the sort of Government Australia needs. But the<br />
Government Australia has got has been the great Government of post-War<br />
change in this country and the runs on the board are sitting in those national<br />
accounts data today. And it should be a matter of great pride to Australians<br />
that together we have all produced this result 16 quarters of growth.<br />
I guarantee there is not another OECD economy, since the world recession,<br />
which has had 16 consecutive quarters of growth.<br />
So these are the things to have pride in. That we care about our children,<br />
that we won't leave them uneducated, that we give them that access and we<br />
lift them up and we believe in them and we let them do their best to put their<br />
mark on Australia and that we have equality of opportunity and fairness.<br />
But, at the same time, we have a good profit share, strong investment growth,<br />
a sustainable growth rate in the economy and good employment growth. In<br />
other words, everyone gets a cut of the action. It is not for one section or<br />
another. Now, I think, that is the model we believe in. We believe in the model that<br />
brings the best out in Australia and Australians, that doesn't play favourites,<br />
that doesn't try and chop the thing up factionally, or in a partisan way. And<br />
what these last 12 years have proved is that that model works and I think the<br />
point we would like to make to you today is that it is the model for Australia to<br />
have one where we are together and we believe in one another and that we<br />
are kind to one another. A society which is a kindly society and not a hard<br />
bitten, devil take the hindmost, society, . a Ia the American Republicans,<br />
a la some of the other right-wing governments around the world. It is not for<br />
Australia, it is certainly not for Paul Keating and it is not for Maggie Deahm.<br />
ends </p>
