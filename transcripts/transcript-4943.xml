FOR PRESS 18 JANUARY 1979<br />
COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE TO QUEENSLAND IN RESPECT OF<br />
CYCLONE PETER<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that he had written<br />
to the Premier of Queensland agreeing to certain<br />
relief measures under the natural disaster assistance<br />
arrangements in connection with Cyclone Peter.<br />
Mr. Fraser said he had informed Mr. Bjelke Petersen<br />
that the Commonwealth concurred in the implementation of<br />
certain measures to assist those suffering personal<br />
hardship and distress and for the restoration of public<br />
assets and emergency protection and repair work<br />
by State, local and semi-government authorities under<br />
the same terms and conditions as those which applied<br />
for similar disasters in 1977 and 1978.<br />
The Commonwealth also agreed to loans being made<br />
to small businesses under the agreed terms which<br />
provide for loans up to a maximum of $ 25,000 with<br />
a term of 3-5 years and an interest rate of 5 percent<br />
per annum.<br />
Mr. Fraser also said that, in respect of affected<br />
primary producers, the Commonwealth would agree to<br />
the granting of loans for carry-on purposes of up to<br />
the agreed maximum of $ 30,000, and to the implementation<br />
of freight subsidies on the terms and conditions<br />
agreed upon for similar disasters in 1977 and 1978.<br />
