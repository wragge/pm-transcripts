Jj ALIST ALIAL<br />
FRERME MINISTER<br />
FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER ' S SPEECH TO KANSAI<br />
FEDERATION OF ECONOMIC ORGANISATIONS, OSAKA 3 FEBRUARY<br />
BEGINS: IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE KANSAI AREA, WHICH HAS ALWAYS HAD A<br />
SPECIAL PLACE IN AUSTRALIAN-JAPANESE RELATIONS.<br />
A CENTURY AGO IT WAS A KANSAI MAN FUSAJIRO KANEMATSU WHO<br />
PIONEERED THE GREAT AUSTRALIA-JAPAN WOOL TRADE, AND IN THE<br />
PROCESS ESTABLISHED ONE OF THE FIRST OF THE FAMOUS JAPANESE<br />
TRADING COMPANIES.<br />
WOOL SUPPLIES TO THE TEXTILE MILLS OF OSAKA AND ITS<br />
NEIGHBOURING CITIES FOR A LONG TIME REPRESENTED THE BIGGEST<br />
ELEMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S TRADE WITH JAPAN. AN WHEN IN THE<br />
FIRST GREAT TRANSFORMATION OF AUSTRALIAN EXPORT TRADE TO JAPAN,<br />
MINERALS CAME TO EXCEED WOOL IN IMPORTANCE, IT WAS THE STEEL<br />
MILLS CF THE KANSAI AREA THAT ABSORBED HUGH QUANTITIES OF<br />
IRON ORE AND COAL.<br />
THE TRADE IS NOT ONE-WAY. AUSTRALIA IMPORTS TWICE AS MUCH<br />
PER CAPITA FROM JAPAN AS THE UNITED STATES, AND FOUR TIMES AS MUCH<br />
AS THE INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES OF EUROPE. A HIGH PROPORTION OF THESE<br />
AUSTRALIAN IMPORTS ARE MANUFACTURED) GOODS FROM YOUR AREA.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS THE FOURTH LARGEST MARKET FOR JAPAN'S AUTOMOBILESBEH4IND<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA, AND ALMOST AS LARGE<br />
AS THE THIRD, GERMANY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN IS AT SOMETHING<br />
OF A CROSS-ROADS. GROWTH PROJECTIONS FOR RAW MATERIALS AND<br />
ENERGY RESOURCES, THE TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF MUCH OF THE STRENGTH<br />
IN AUSTRALIA'S TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN, HAVE BEEN4<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED BECAUSE OF THE COMBINED IMPACT OF<br />
SLOWER JAPANESE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ASSOCIATED ADJ. USTMENTS<br />
IN THE PATTENRS OF JAPANESE DEMAND.<br />
THIS IMPOSES ON AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS A NEED TO EXPLORE CAREFULLY<br />
NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN THE JAPANESE MARKET. WE HAVE BEGUN TO<br />
IDENTIFY NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS<br />
AND SERVICES, AND TO REGISTER AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS IN FUTURE<br />
JAPANESE TRADE LIBERALISATION PACKAGES.<br />
I HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO RECEIVE UNDERTAKINGS THAT THE JAPANESE<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL COOPERATE WITH US IN THIS REVITALISATION OF TRADE.<br />
THIS TASK WILL BE THE EASIER IF IT IS INFORMED ON THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN SIDE BY A SOUND APPRECIATION OF TRENDS IN JAPANESE<br />
INDUSTRY GROWTH, AND THE POLICIES WHICH-AFFECT IT. </p>
<p>HERE IN THE HEARTLAND OF JAPANESE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, I<br />
FIND IT PARTICULARLY APT TO REFLECT UPON JAPAN'S INDUSTRIAL<br />
EXPERIENCE AND TO ASK WHY JAPANESE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY<br />
HAS PERFORMED. SO STRONGLY IN RECENT-DECADES AND WHETHER WE<br />
CAN LEARN FROM THAT EXPERIENCE.<br />
I HAVE LONG HAD AN INTEREST IN JAPAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE,<br />
AND ONE SPECIAL FEATURE OF THIS VISIT T0 JAPAN HAS BEEN THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY IT HAS PROVIDED TO CONSIDER THE RELEVANCE OF THIS<br />
TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
THIS HAS SUGGESTED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS DESERVING CLOSE<br />
ATTENTION IN AUSTRALIA BY MYSELF, MY COLLEAGUES IN GOVERNMENT,<br />
AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY.<br />
ANY OUTSIDER LOOKING IN ON JAPAN IS IMPRESSED BY THE DYNAMISM,<br />
COMPETITIVENESS AND LONG TERM FOCUS WHICH SO OBVIOUSLY<br />
CHARACTERISE JAPANESE MANUFACTURING POLICY.<br />
THE COMBINATION OF A DISCIPLINED, HIGHLY SKILLED AND MOTIVATED<br />
WORKFCN'CE, ADAPTABLE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGEMENT, AND A SYSTEM OF<br />
INDUST. RIAL RELATIONS WHICH EMPHASISES CONSENSUS AND CO-OPERATION<br />
H4AS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO JAPAN'S SUCCESS IN PENETRATING<br />
WORLD MARKETS AND MAKING IT A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POWER.<br />
AUSTRALIANS HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF JAPAN'S SUCCESS.<br />
THE REACTION FROM SOME QUARTERS HAS QUITE NATURALLY BEEN<br />
DEFENSIVE. IT HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICAL OF SOME FEATURES OF<br />
THE JAPANESE APPROACH.<br />
BUT THE BENEFITS JAPAN HAS DERIVED FROM INDUSTRIAL GROWTH4<br />
AND THE ADVANTAGES WE HAVE BOTH DERIVED FROM OUR ECONOMIC<br />
PARTNERSHIP IT HAS MADE POSSIBLE ARE INDISPUTABLE.<br />
AN AUSTRALIAN UNDERSTANDING OF JAPANESE MANUFACTURING POLICY,<br />
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS INTEGRATED WITH EXTERNAL POLICIES,<br />
ESPECIALLY TRADE AND SUPPORTIVE POLICIES, ARE<br />
IMPORTANT TO FURTHER DEVELOPING OUR HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE<br />
ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP.<br />
SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING WOULD ALSO BE TIMELY IN A PERIOD WHEN<br />
AUSTRALIA IS BEGINNING TO CONSOLIDATE ITS ECONOMIC RECOVERY<br />
AND TO REINFORCE ITS PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINED MEDIUM AND<br />
LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH.<br />
IT IS NOW WIDELY RECOGNISED IN AUSTRALIA TH4AT THERE IS A NEED<br />
TO IMPROVE THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF AUSTRALIA'S MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRY. INCREASINGLY IT IS RECOGNISED THAT AN EXPANDING, EXPORTORIENTED<br />
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE SECTOR PROVIDE THE BASIC<br />
MEANS WHEREBY EMPLOYMENT GROWTH AND SATISFYING CAREER<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR GROWING POPULATION SPECIALLY FOR<br />
OUR YOUTH WILL BE PROVIDED.<br />
A DEFENSIVE, INWARD-LOOKING, AND STAGNANT MANUFACTURING<br />
SECTOR COULD HOLD BACK THE GROWTH OF THE WHOLE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY.<br />
L </p>
<p>THESE REALITIES HAVE RECEIVED PUBLIC RECOGNITION OVER THE LAST<br />
DECADE. THERE IS A QUITE WIDE APPRECIATION WITHIN AUS. RALIA<br />
THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY GRADUALLY. TO REDUCE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PROTECTION LEVELS IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF A MORE<br />
EFFICIENT, EXPORT-ORIENTED MANUFACTURING SECTOR.<br />
FOR GOVERNME NT THE ISSUE MUST BE HOW TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS<br />
TOWARD THESE INCREASINGLY WIDELY ACCEPTED OBJECTIVES<br />
WITHOUT DISRUPTING THOSE SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY WHICH ARE<br />
ALREADY PERFORMING WELL.<br />
JAPAN'S MANUFACTURING POLICY APPROACH ( UNDERLINED)<br />
FEATURES OF JAPAN'S MANUFACTURING POLICY APPROACH WHICH STRIKE<br />
AN OUTSIDER INCLUDE:<br />
THE EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES<br />
( INCLUDING GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS, UNIONS, ACADEMIA AND THE<br />
MEDIA) TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM CO-ORDINATION IN JAPANESE<br />
IND! 2STRIAL DEVELOPMENT.,<br />
THE WIDESCALE SHARING AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION<br />
RELEVANT TO JAPANESE INDUSTRIES ON BOTH MACRO AND<br />
MICRO-ECONOMIC TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS.<br />
THE EXTENSIVE USE BY JAPAN OF PLANNING AND FORECASTING<br />
E. G. THE PA'S ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, MITI ' S LONG TERM<br />
' VISIONS'I, AND THE LABOR MINISTRY'S LONG-TERM<br />
EMPLOYMENT PLANS. t<br />
THE APPROACH TO STRUCTURALLY DEPRESSED INDUSTRIES INCLUDING<br />
THE EMPHASIS ON PRODUCTIVITY GAINS.#<br />
THE PHASING OUT OF EXCESS CAPACITY IN SOME INDUSTRIES.<br />
REVITALISATION THROUGH THE SELF-RELIANT EFFORT OF INDUSTRIES<br />
THEMSELVES.<br />
THE ROLE OF APPROPRTA'TELY TIMED TRADE LIBERALISATION IN<br />
SPURRING PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND THEREFORE IN THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF EXPORT INDUSTRIES.,<br />
THE PRECISE WAY IN WHICH SOME OF THESE FEATURES OF JAPAN'S<br />
MANUFACTURING POLICY WORK DEPENDS ON THEIR HISTORICAL<br />
AND SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS AND ON LABOUR FORCE AND MANAGERIAL<br />
STRUCTURES THAT CANNOT BE TRANSLATED INTO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
E NVIR ON MEN T.<br />
SOME OF THESE HOWEVER FIND A PARALLEL IN RECENT AUSTRALIAN<br />
EXPERIENCE, WHILE OTHERS WARRANT CLOSE ATTENTION.<br />
THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS IN AUSTRALIA ( UNDERLINED)<br />
ALREADY IN AUSTRALIA, WITH THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT,<br />
WE HAVE SEEN4 THAT VERY SUBSTANTIAL SHARING OF INFORMATION<br />
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHARED GENERAL PERSPECTIVES ON<br />
POLICY CAN BE ACHIEVED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THAT PROCESS<br />
IS NOW BEING CARRIED FORWARD BY THE NEW ECONOMIC PLANNING<br />
ADVISORY COUNCIL. </p>
<p>THE SUMMIT WAS A LANDMARK IN RECENT AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL<br />
LISTORY. IT WAS TH4E VISIBLE MANIFESTION OF MY GOVERNMENT'S WISH TO<br />
PUT THE DIVISIVENESS AND CONFLICT OF THE RECENT PAST<br />
BEHIND US AND, IN ITS 3TEAD, TO BUILD A SPIRIT OF NATIONAL<br />
CONSENSUS AND CO-OPERATION.<br />
AT THE SUMMIT, REPRESENTATIVES OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENTS, OF. BUSINESS LARGE AND SMALL, OF THE UNIONS AND<br />
OF PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS GATHERED TOGETHER<br />
IN WHAT, IT IS NOW APPARENT, WAS A SUCCESSFUL QUEST FOR A<br />
COMMON NATIONAL PURPOSE.<br />
THROUGH THE SUMMIT WE CREATED A CLIMATE FOR COMMON<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF AUSTRALIA'S PARTICULAR<br />
ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE CONTEXT OF A RECESSED INTERNATIONAL<br />
ECONOMY. WE EXPLORED THE POLICY OPTIONS AVAILABLE. AND WE<br />
ENSURED THAT TH4E RELEVANT PARTIES CLEARLY APPRECIATED THE<br />
ROLE EACH W4OULD HAVE TO PLAY IN PULLING AUSTRALIA OUT OF THE<br />
RECESSION.<br />
AT THE SUMMIT, FOLLOWING PRESENTATION AND DEBATE OF<br />
SEVERAL ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, A BROAD MACRO-ECONOMIC STRATEGY<br />
WAS SUPPORTED BY THE PARTICIPATING REPRESENTATIVES OF<br />
BUSINESS. GOVERNMENTS AND UNIONS.<br />
AN AGREEMENT OF THIS KIND HAS NO PRECEDENT IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
IT HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE CURBING OF INCOME CLAIMS, RESTRAINT<br />
IN THE LEVEL OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BORROWING, AND TO THE<br />
RESTORATION OF RELATIVE PEACE IN TH4E AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS SCENE. THESE ARE NO SMALL ACHIEVEMENTS. THEY<br />
EXPLAIN IN PART THE RESURGENCE * OF INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE<br />
IN AUSTRALIA AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST RELIABLE ECONOMIC<br />
PARTNERS.<br />
THE SUMMIT WAS NOT A ONE-OFF EVENT. WE HAVE FOLLOWED UP,<br />
AS I MENTIO1NED EARLIER 1WITH THE ESTABLISH4MENT OF A SMALL,<br />
INDEPENDENT, REPRESENTATIVE ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY<br />
COUNCIL ( EPAC) TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF CONSULTATION<br />
WHICH BEGAN AT THE SUMMIT. AS PRIME MINISTER I CHAIR<br />
MEETINGS OF EPAC. EPAC* HAS ALREADY MET SEVERAL TIMES<br />
AND IS EXPANDING THE INFORMATION BASE AVAILABLE FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC POLICY FORMULATION. THE COUNCIL IS<br />
FOCUSING ON MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ISSUES, AND<br />
IS PUTTING FORWARD POLICY SUGGESTIONS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH. AS A FORUM FOR CONSULTATION AND<br />
REPRESENTATION IN ECONOMIC MATTERS IT HAS NO PRECENDENT.<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, IT IS ALREADY PROVING ITS WORTH TO<br />
GOVERNMENT AND, PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, IS WIDENING THE<br />
BASE OF COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRUCIAL<br />
ISSUES OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT.<br />
WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO FACILITATE AN ONGOING SPECIFIC<br />
DIALOGUE WITH MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE MECH4ANISMS FOR<br />
THOSE INVOLVED IN INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGET1HER<br />
TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT, INTERNATIONALLY. COMPETITIVE. AUSTRALIAN<br />
MANUFACTURING.' OUR PARTICULAR AIM IS TO SECURE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE<br />
SHARED PERSPECTIVES GROUNDED IN A REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF<br />
MARKET CONDITIONS. WE APPLIED SUCH AN APPROACH IN THE STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY PLAN. MY MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, SENATOR<br />
BUTTON, IS CURRENTLY RESTRUCTURING THE AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING<br />
COUNCIL WITH THIS AIM IN MIND.<br />
THE LONGER PERSPECTIVE ( UNDERLINED)<br />
THERE WOULD BE SUPPORT IN AUSTRALIA FOR THE VIEW THAT, IN<br />
THE PAST, THE ABSENCE OF SOUNDLY-BASED FORWARD PROJECTIONS<br />
OF ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY TRENDS HAD CAUSED INDUSTRY AND<br />
GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND EXCESSIVELY TO SHORT-TERM PRESSURES,<br />
RATHER THAN TO EXPLICIT LONG-TERM GOALS. THE RESULT HAS<br />
BEEN MORE PAINFUL PROCESSES OF ADJUSTMENT, AS WELL AS ADJUSTMENT<br />
FAILURES AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
I HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED TO EPAC THAT I SEE REAL ' VALUE IN THE<br />
PREPARATION OF AN AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT OF TRENDS IN PARTICULAR<br />
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS IN THE WHOLE ECONOMY. SUCH A<br />
STATEMENT MIGHT ANALYSE EMERGING PATTERNS OF ACTIV'ITY, AND RELATE<br />
THOSE PATTERNS TO A CONSISTENT GOVERNMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK.<br />
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT ANALYSIS COULD STAND AS A BENCH-MARK<br />
AGAINST WHICH CORPORATE PLANNERS MIGHT MEASURE THEIR OWN<br />
EXPECTATIONS. ISSUES IN STRUCTURAL ADJU-STMENT ( UNDERLINED)<br />
A FIRM GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO WIDE-RANGING CONSULTATION,<br />
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTHORITATIVE LONGER-TERM DATA<br />
BASE FOR ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY TRENDS, ARE IMPORTANT FOR<br />
THE TYPES. OF CHANGE REQUIRED IN AUSTRALIA'S MANUFACTURING<br />
SECTOR.<br />
WITH MORE FAVOURABLE MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS EMERGING,<br />
AUSTRALIANS CAN MORE CONFIDENTLY ADDRESS THE CHANGES WHICH<br />
WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOVEMENTS TOWARDS A MORE COMPETITIVE,<br />
EXPORT-ORIENTED MAN4UFACTURING INDUSTRY.<br />
ON THE BASIS OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A MEMBER OF THE CRAWFORD<br />
COMMITTEE ON STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT, WHICH MET IN AUSTRALIA IN<br />
1978/ 79 I WOULD SAY THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE HAS BEEN<br />
DEVELOPING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I HAVE ALSO 13EEN IMPRESSED THAT<br />
IN MY OWN RECENT CONTACTS WITH AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYERS AND UNIONISTS,<br />
MANY OF THEM HAVE DEMONSTRATED A STRONG AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR<br />
A FRESH APPROACH TO AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE POLICY. THE IMAGE<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS BEING IMPLACABLY OPPOSED TO NEW<br />
APPROACHES IS QUITE WRONG.<br />
IN AUSTRALIA THE ASSUMPTIONS OF AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRY POLICY ARE COM1ING UNDER CLOSER SCRUTINY. ISSUES<br />
COMING INTO FOCUS, SUCH AS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RECENTLY<br />
COMPLETED REVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS OF THE<br />
CUASTRALIAN INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION, INCLUDE:<br />
DEFINITION OF PRECISE GOALS. DETERMINATION4 OF THE TIMING<br />
OF THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT. SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE<br />
POLICY INSTRUMENTS. CONSIDERATION OF NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL </p>
<p>AND ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. , AND ATTENTION TO THE EQUITABLE<br />
DISTRIBJTION OF THE SOCIAL COSTS OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT.<br />
INDEED, I IAOULr LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT I SEE NO POINT IN<br />
ENCOURAGING CHANGE SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGE, AND EVERY<br />
POINT IN ENSURING THAT CHANGE IS GRADUAL AND ITS IMPLICATIONS<br />
APPRECIATED -TO THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXTENT BY PEOPLE<br />
AFFECTED BY IT.<br />
IN THIS AREA THERE IS MUCH WISDOM IN THE PROVERBIAL INJUNCTION<br />
'' TO HASTEN SLOWLY''. FURTHERMORE, EVEN WHERE CHANGE IS<br />
JUSTIFIED, AND IN THE COMMUNITY'S INTEREST, W4E MUST STILL<br />
ENSURE THAT THOSE A~ T THE FACE OF CHANGE ARE NOT ASKED TO<br />
BEAR ITS COSIS ALONE. IF CHANGE IS TO BE JUSTIFIED IN<br />
TERMS OF THE BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, THEN THE<br />
COMMUNITY MUST SHOULDER THE BURDEN, AND MECHANISMS MUST BE<br />
DEVELOPED FOR DISTRIBUTING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS EQUITABLY.<br />
BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT AUSTRALIA WILL HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM<br />
POLICIES WHICH HAVE AS THEIR ONLY FOCUS THE RESTRICTION OF<br />
IMPORTS, AND TO INTRODUCE PROGRAMS AIMED TO FACILITATE<br />
STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND DEVELOP STRONG, EFFICIENT AND<br />
COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES.<br />
WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE THE EMPHASIS ON<br />
PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY COULD SO STRENGTHEN AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
THAT IMPORTS WOULD BE RESTRICTED MORE EFFECTIVELY BY NEWLY-WON<br />
COMPETITIVENESSP THAT THEY COULD REASON4ABLY BE BY RESTRICTIONS<br />
ON TRADE. OUR RECENT EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT STEEL IS ONE<br />
SUCH EXAMPLE, AND MOTOR VEHICLES MAY BE ANOTHER.<br />
I HAVE FOR A LON~ G TIME BELIEVED THAT COMING TO TERMS WITH<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS IMPORTANT IF INDUSTRIES ARE TO<br />
MAINTAIN TH4EIR COMPETITIVE EDGE.<br />
I FULLY APPRECIATE THAT MEN AND WOMEN, FACED WITH4 THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF LOSING JOBS AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
CHANGE AND STRUCTURAL-ADJUSTMENT, LOOK ON IT WITH FEAR AND<br />
CONCERN.<br />
THOSE SAME PEOPLE, MOVED UNDERSTANDABLY BY PERCEPTIONS OF<br />
THEIR OWN IMMEDIATE SELF-INTEREST, MAY DEMAND OF GOVERNMENTS<br />
THAT THEY RESIST CHANGE AND REFRAIN FROM DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE<br />
MECHANISMS FOR ITS ACCOMMODATION. BUT IF THEY DO, THEY<br />
CONDEMN THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO LOW4ER RELATIVE<br />
LIVING STANDARDS AND A DIMINISHED FUTURE.<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CONSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE<br />
INEVITABLE. NO PEREPARING FOR THEM NOW WILL ONLY MAKE<br />
WORSE THE HURST FELT WHEN IT COMES. </p>
<p>OBVIOUSLY A FLEXIBLE AND SKILLED WORKFORCE WILL BE BETTER<br />
ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
I BELIEVE THERE ARE REAL LESSONS TO BE LEARNT BY AUSTRALIANS<br />
FROM THE FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE JAPANESE APPROACH TO SKILLS<br />
DEVELOPMENT. RATHER THAN LEAVING THESE MATTERS ENTIRELY TO<br />
GOVERNMENT, I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MANY MORE AUSTRALIAN<br />
EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS TAKING A GREATER INTEREST IN, AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR, DEVELOPING THE SKILLS OF EMPLOYEES.<br />
BY HELPING TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND RETRAINING, TH4EY SHOULD<br />
BE ABLE TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE INSECURITY AND POTENTIAL<br />
IN4DUSTRIAL PROBLEMS WHICH EMPLOYMENT CHANGES MIGHT BRING.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED TO ENSURE THE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION<br />
SYSTEM IS PROPERLY GEARED FOR THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE. WE<br />
SEE THIS AS BEING ESSENTIAL IF OUR PEOPLE ARE TO REALISE THEIR<br />
FULL POTENTIAL AS INDIVIDUALS, AND IF THE COMMUNIT IS TO<br />
MAXIMISE THE BENEFITS OF ITS HUMAN AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES.<br />
CONCLUSION ( UNDERLINED)<br />
IT WILL BE EVIDENT FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID TODAY THAT, DESPITE<br />
THE DIFFERENT HISTORICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TRADITIONS<br />
IN AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN, THERE IS MUCH IN THE JAPANESE<br />
APPROACH TO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY INDUSTRY POLICY THAT HAS<br />
RELEVANCE TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, THAT EXPERIENCE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE REALITY<br />
THAT PROBLEMS OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT ARE LIKELY TO BE<br />
EXACERBATED IF THE POSITIVE BENEFIiS FROM SUCH4 ADJUSTMENT<br />
ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECTED. I SEE IT<br />
AS IMPORTANT THAT THESE BE MADE EVIDENT TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMMUNITY AND THAT THERE BE A BROAD NATIONAL AND INDUSTRY-BASED<br />
CONSENSUS IN SUPPORT OF THE APPLICATION OF NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES AND POLICIES WHICH MAKE STRUCTURAL CHANGE FEASIBLE<br />
AND ACCEPTABLE.<br />
WITH MR NAKASONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,-I DECLARED AUSTRALIA'S<br />
SUPPORT FOR A MORE OPEN MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. I<br />
RECOGNISE THAT IN THIS CONTEXT AUSTRALIA MUST BE PREPARED<br />
TO ENCOURAGE DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES TO BE COMPETITIVE INTER NATI ONALLY,<br />
AND TO REVIEW AREAS OF HIGH PROTECTION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK<br />
OF THE APPROACH TO MANUFACTURING POLICY I HAVE OUTLINED.<br />
THE TASK WILL NOT BE AN EASY ONE. BUT SUCCESS WOULD MAKE THE<br />
EFFORT WORTHWHILE. </p>
