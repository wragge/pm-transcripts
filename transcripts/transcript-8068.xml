SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
HON R J L HAWKE<br />
DELIVERED AT LUNCHEON<br />
HOSTED BY M. JEAN LEQUES<br />
MAYOR OF NOUMEA,<br />
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE<br />
NOUMEA 28 JULY 1990<br />
Mr Mayor<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Thank you for your hospitality and for the warmth of your<br />
welcome to Hazel and me. We appreciate very much the<br />
excellent arrangements that you our near neighbours have<br />
made for us in New Caledonia.<br />
I do not believe that anyone visiting Noumea and meeting so<br />
many community leaders, as I have done this morning, could<br />
fail to detect the spirit of optimism that seems to permeate<br />
the community in New Caledonia.<br />
I have been particularly impressed by the commitment<br />
displayed by all parties to the Matignon Accords, and by the<br />
determination to make them succeed.<br />
For all these reasons, let me say that you have the respect<br />
of all Australians and our best wishes as you proceed with<br />
the important tasks ahead of you.<br />
I commented last night on the stark contrast between the<br />
prevailing spirit of cooperation and shared endeavour, and<br />
the bitterness and futility that so damaged New Caledonia<br />
for much of the 1980s.<br />
It is a truly significant achievement that peace and<br />
stability have been re-established in New Caledonian<br />
political life.<br />
New Caledonia is richly endowed with two strong and deep<br />
cultural traditions. Both these flourishing cultures have an<br />
enduring contribution to make to the emergence of a single<br />
harmonious New Caledonian society. Both deserve full<br />
respect; both must receive full recognition. </p>
<p>And, equally important, you are now committed to a process<br />
that will lead to an act of self-determination in 1998.<br />
As I said last night, Australia would have been<br />
uncomfortable deeply so with any outcome that denied<br />
such a choice to the people of this territory.<br />
Of course there are profound differences between loyalists<br />
and independantists about what you see as the best long-term<br />
outcome. It is not for me to take any side in this.<br />
But we welcome the fact as do our Pacific neighbours<br />
that a real act of self-determination will be made. And we<br />
welcome the prospect flowing from the Matignon Accords<br />
that when it is made this will be against the background of<br />
an experience of harmony and co-operation, not the hostility<br />
and bitterness of the past.<br />
Our concern both from the point of view of the territory<br />
and of the region generally -is that a viable future for<br />
New Caledonia must recognise the rights of the indigenous<br />
people and it must safeguard the rights of all other longterm<br />
residents.<br />
I want to assure you that whatever the choice New<br />
Caledonians make in 1998 and it is your choice, no-one<br />
else's you can be assured of Australia's continued<br />
goodwill and friendly support.<br />
You will find us a reliable friend of stability and a firm<br />
supporter of the processes of reconciliation.<br />
It is of course a very natural thing that Australians should<br />
support you and should understand the significance of what<br />
you are trying to do.<br />
That support and understanding springs from the deep roots<br />
of our common historical experiences.<br />
Of course, we are different in size and economic diversity<br />
not to mention that you are a French territory and we were<br />
British. But the differences that arise from such circumstances are<br />
less significant than the enduring similarities between us.<br />
When Europeans first came to our two countries they<br />
displayed and indulged a similar nostalgia for the Northern<br />
Hemisphere.<br />
When Captain Cook landed on this island, he called it " New"<br />
Caledonia because the pine-clad ridges reminded him of<br />
Scotland. In the same way, Australia had been given the early name of<br />
" New" Holland. </p>
<p>b 3.<br />
For that matter, Vanuatu was known as the " New" Hebrides,<br />
and " New" Zealand and Papua " New" Guinea received similar<br />
proofs that the Europeans saw these places as Southern<br />
Hemisphere replicas of Northern Hemisphere originals.<br />
In fact, the new arrivals arrogantly, but typically for<br />
their time turned a blind eye to all the evidence that<br />
they were intruding onto the territory of cultures that had<br />
flourished here for millennia. The early Europeans in<br />
Australia were undoubtedly guilty of that.<br />
In calling everything " new", the Europeans in the South<br />
Pacific were simply showing themselves as proudly selfconscious<br />
expatriates.<br />
To speak of Australia, I have always felt that even though<br />
it is just over two hundred years since the arrival of the<br />
Europeans, we are in many ways a much " newer" society now<br />
than we were then.<br />
This newness is not only measured by technology or education<br />
or economic strength, but, of critical importance, by the<br />
makeup of our people themselves.<br />
We are a nation of immigrants. With particular rapidity<br />
since the Second World War, Australia has drawn immigrants<br />
from virtually every country in the world.<br />
But as each new wave of people has arrived, the sense of<br />
being expatriates transplanted to a foreign soil has given<br />
way to a sense of belonging to, and commitment to, their new<br />
home.<br />
We are not only a more talented and more dynamic community<br />
as a result of these diverse origins, we are also much more<br />
united and much stronger.<br />
Let me say it again: our diversity, our multiculturalism,<br />
has become, for Australia, a great source of strength.<br />
In that regard we are very much a " new" society tolerant,<br />
harmonious and largely unfamiliar with overt communal<br />
violence and tensions.<br />
That is why I said earlier that it is not surprising that<br />
Australians should understand and support you in what you<br />
are now trying to do in New Caledonia.<br />
Because here, you too are building a new society and in<br />
doing so you are seeking strength through your diversity,<br />
and tolerance through honest talking and fair dealing.<br />
I am not pretending in any of this that there are precise<br />
analogies between Australia and New Caledonia. I am<br />
certainly not laying down any detailed prescriptions about<br />
the future of New Caledonian society.<br />
I respect you too much for that. </p>
<p>4.<br />
But I do believe this: we are going to be neighbours for a<br />
very long time.<br />
We who live in the Pacific and who share this region<br />
understand well, I believe, that differences can only be<br />
solved, and long-term solutions found, through cooperation<br />
and mutual trust.<br />
That is the single most important lesson of the Matignon<br />
Accords. And my discussions today have vividly shown me<br />
that this trust and commitment does exist.<br />
The success of the Accords means that I can today address<br />
New Caledonians not as two divided rivals but as one<br />
emerging united community.<br />
So what I have seen today what I see when I look at this<br />
gathering now are the faces of a truly " New" Caledonia.<br />
That is why I believe the Accords do offer the best way<br />
forward for you. I earnestly hope in the interests of all<br />
New Caledonians and the harmony and prosperity of the South<br />
Pacific region that the effort will be maintained and the<br />
progress continued. I congratulate you on the success you<br />
are achieving.<br />
