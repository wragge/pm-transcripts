TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, AWA, HONEBUSH 20 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did it take some quick talking to<br />
make sure that Senator Walsh remained in Cabinet?<br />
PM: It wasn't a matter of quick talking. I can be quite<br />
straightforward about what happened. Peter Walsh has had an<br />
extraordinarily difficult portfolio. Being Minister for<br />
Finance at a period when you're cutting billions of dollars<br />
in outlays is a very very unrewarding, politically<br />
unrewarding business. He's been under a lot of pressure and<br />
he just straightforwardly spoke to me and said it was<br />
getting him down and of course added to that was the fact<br />
that he comes from West Australia, that has imposed another<br />
strain. He raised the question with me as to whether he<br />
could go on. So I had a talk with him and I pointed out<br />
that I understood what a terribly difficult position it is.<br />
Because it's always very hard for a Minister no, no, no.<br />
It's a lot of things which intrinsically are worthwhile, but<br />
taken in the overall scheme of things you've got to say no<br />
too. The Minister for Finance is the focal point of<br />
everyone's bitterness when they can't get things or have<br />
things taken off them. So it's been a difficult time and we<br />
had a very straightforward talk about it and I said how much<br />
I appreciated a) the work he'd been doing and b) the strain<br />
under which he'd been operating. I asked him to consider<br />
that position and I'm very pleased to say Peter said,<br />
alright then I'll stay on.<br />
JOURNALIST: easy to relieve that kind of pressure that<br />
he's been feeling?<br />
PM: Not in the immediate sense. He'll be associated with<br />
the preparation of the April statement, but I hope that<br />
after the April statement has been completed that Peter will<br />
have the opportunity of getting a bit of a break because he<br />
really deserves it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some of the senior Government Ministers seem to<br />
have been a little bit concerned about general direction of<br />
the Government. Are you happy with it at the moment, the<br />
long term direction?<br />
PM: I'm very happy with the long term direction. We've got<br />
difficulties that we've got to deal with like the external<br />
position. That's why we're doing what no Prime Minister<br />
likes doing, I'm running a tight monetary policy with high<br />
interest rates. I hate having to do that and any Prime<br />
Minister in his right mind would hate doing it. But it's </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): necessary because we can't keep that high a<br />
level of activity going which is going to keep sucking in so<br />
many imports because we've got this external deficit<br />
problem. But we're on track. Look at what we're doing in<br />
the area of employment. Still high employment growth 1.3<br />
million jobs, 4% employment growth in this last year, four<br />
times as fast as our predecessors, twice as fast as the rest<br />
of the world. Those things have been done and our<br />
microeconomic reform is on track. The very difficult area<br />
is the waterfront, the maritime industry, but we'll have<br />
significant progress made on that during this year. So I<br />
think, as I've said before, just about any other country in<br />
the world would give their eye teeth to be in Australia's<br />
position. We have enormous advantages, our prospects are<br />
great, but we've got to recognise as a nation that we can't<br />
have everything all at once.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well what can we have with the runway? Will<br />
you be making a decision tomorrow?<br />
PM: That'll be before Cabinet tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has apparent indecision over the runway and<br />
Wesley Vale hurt the Government at all?<br />
PM: Let's take them in order. Wesley Vale, where we've<br />
made the decision, the agreement with the State Government<br />
which is accepted and understood is that they would deal<br />
with it at their level, they would negotiate. My Minister<br />
made, throughout the process, indications of the sorts of<br />
things that needed to be taken into account but the actual<br />
agreement was that they had to negotiate with the State<br />
Government. When the State Government had made its decision<br />
we would then pick it up. obviously it was a difficult<br />
decision. You would like to have the big investment, the<br />
new mill which would help in substituting imports for local<br />
production and also adding to our exports. But, as I've<br />
made it clear and I make clear again, as long as I'm Prime<br />
Minister we're not going to have development at any price.<br />
I was not going to accept a situation where as it stood you<br />
were going to be each day pumping 13 tonnes of chlorides<br />
into the ocean. You can't do that. It wasn't a difficult<br />
decision in the end. As far as the runway is concerned, let<br />
me make it clear that this decision has been around for a<br />
long time, governments before ours, the Fraser-Howard<br />
government had seven years, they dodged it. we started<br />
dealing with it by making the decision to acquire land at<br />
Badgery's Creek because whatever the decision is, third<br />
runway or not, there will have to be an airport built at<br />
Badgerys. So we made the hard decision to identify a site<br />
and now we'll be making a decision tomorrow as to whether<br />
there's a third runway or not at Kingsford Smith. It's not<br />
an easy decision. I've got to face up to the fact that<br />
there are some tough politics in it. There are some tough<br />
politics, a whole range of considerations, but we won't<br />
dodge them, we'll make the decision that on balance is the<br />
right one. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: With the third runway, will you look at<br />
compensating the residents affected by noise?<br />
PM: I don't want to get into a hypothetical of what we'll<br />
do if. Let's face that decision if it has to be faced after<br />
we make a decision in the Cabinet tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you definitely make a decision because you<br />
have postponed it quite<br />
PM: I would . think the decision will be made tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you worry that Mr Punch has been<br />
damaged by the airport issue?<br />
PM: I don't think he has been damaged but the decision will<br />
be made on the merits. It won't be on the basis of one<br />
individual.<br />
ends </p>
