PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATET,&amp; N<br />
7 December 19<br />
COLOUR TELEVISION<br />
Considerable controversy has arisen recently over<br />
Government action on the question of tariff assistance for the<br />
Australian electronics industry, regarding particularly the<br />
introduction of colour television to Australia.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today forwarded two<br />
references to the Tariff Board one covering the question of<br />
assistance for colour television receivers and components and<br />
the other a review reference covering electronic and electrical<br />
goods under the tariff boards current review programme.<br />
The decision was made after consultation with Labour's<br />
nominated Minister for Trade Dr. Cairns, the head of the Trade<br />
Department, Mr. D. H. McKay, and the Chairman of the Tariff Board,<br />
Mr. A. Rattigan. Mr. Whitlam said that the reference on colour television<br />
requests the Board to have regard to the Government's desire that<br />
the manufacture or assembly of colour picture tubes in Australia<br />
should not be encouraged at this stage.<br />
The Government has taken this decision because advice<br />
indicated that local production of colour tubes would be a<br />
costly operation and would undoubtedly increase substantially<br />
the level of protection which might be required. This decision<br />
by the Governme.. L' will also assist manufacturers in their<br />
preliminary plWhniig. Mr. Whitlam added that the Board had<br />
been asked to pr.: if-e an early report, preferably by 30 June<br />
1973 but no later than 30 September 1973.<br />
As well a. asking the Board whether assistance should<br />
be accorded the pr,. uction of colour television receivers, Mr.<br />
Whitlam said that the Board has also been asked for advice of<br />
what rates of duty or other assistance arrangements would be<br />
needed to sustai. n in Australia the manufacture of colour<br />
television receivers with low, medium and high content.<br />
Dr. Cairns said after the meeting that the review<br />
reference covered a very wide range of electronic and electrical<br />
goods, These included electronic components, electronic<br />
consumer product, telecommunications equipment, computers and<br />
automatic data processing equipment, arc welding equipment,<br />
electric motors and other industrial electrical equipment. / 2 </p>

Dr. Cairns said he was pleased that the question of<br />
colour television had been referred promptly to the Tariff Board<br />
for early enquiry and report.<br />
This step would enable the Board and the Government<br />
to be aware of the views of all interested parties, including<br />
manufacturers, television broadcasters and consumers.<br />
Dr. Cairns said he was sure that the Board's advice<br />
would be of great assistance to the Government when the time<br />
comes for it to weigh up the benefits and costs of assisting<br />
the local manufacture of colour T. V. receivers.<br />
Dr. Cairns said Australia had a well-established<br />
electronics industry which for many years had been engaged in the<br />
manufacture of components, consumer products ( such as monochrome<br />
television receivers) and telecommunications and defence equipment.<br />
The industry employs about 30,000 people and has funds employed<br />
approximating $ 2830 million.<br />
The advent of colour television presented both a<br />
challenge and a great opportunity to the industry.<br />
