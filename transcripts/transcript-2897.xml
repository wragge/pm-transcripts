-~ AUSTRCALIA Press Statement No. 78<br />
16 April 1973<br />
ACTION ON PRICES<br />
The Australian Government today dedided to seek<br />
urgently proposals for the stabilisation of domestic<br />
prices of meat.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said today<br />
that Cabinet had decided that the minister for Primary<br />
Industry, Senator Wriedt, should seek the proposals from<br />
the Australian Meat Board.<br />
The board will be asked to submit a plan for the<br />
stabilisation of domestic meat prices for consideration<br />
by the Government before the Premiers' Conference on<br />
Prices and Incomes Policy.<br />
The Premiers' Conference will be held in<br />
Canberra on 10 May.<br />
This was one of several decisions on prices reached<br />
by Cabinet today.<br />
Cabinet authorised the urgent preparation of<br />
legislation to establish a prices justification body.<br />
The Treasurer, Mr. Crean, will draft the legislation<br />
in -consultation with the Attorney-General, Senator Murphy,<br />
in time for its introduction and passage during the present<br />
Parliamentary sittings.<br />
Cabinet decided that in the development of the<br />
legislation the following points should be taken into<br />
account: The approach should be directed towards prices<br />
justification rather than price control;<br />
The name of the new body should be the<br />
Prices Justification Board; ./ 2 </p>
<p>S The board should be an independent body<br />
responsible to the Prime Minister; and<br />
S The board should not be limited to considering<br />
only matters referred to it but should be given<br />
authority to initiate investigations on its own<br />
account where significant price increases are<br />
noted.<br />
In other decisions on prices, Cabinet decided that<br />
the Economic Committee of Cabinet will be responsible for<br />
developing for the Cabinet the Government's policy in<br />
respect of prices and, in particular, for studying and<br />
reporting upon all Ministerial proposals which can<br />
affect prices. A special secretariat will be established in the<br />
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to assist<br />
the work of the committee.<br />
Cabinet decided to arrange for the Joint Parliamentary<br />
Committee on Prices to conduct immediate inquiries into prices<br />
of goods with high import content which have not fallen<br />
following the exchange rate appreciation in December 1972.<br />
In addition, Ministers who are members of the<br />
Economic Committee are to be invited to submit, as a<br />
matter of urgency, proposals for action which<br />
might affect prices.<br />
