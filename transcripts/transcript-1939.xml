Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Rear Admiral G. C. Oldham, C. B. D. S. has<br />
been appointed Commonwealth Director of the Captain Cook Bi-centenary<br />
Celebrations. A wide range of proposals to celebrate the 200th<br />
anniversary of Captain Cook's discovery and exploration of the<br />
eastern coast of Australia has been received and the Government<br />
proposes to mark the historic occasion in a fitting manner.<br />
The Government is pleased to have obtained the<br />
services of Rear Admiral Oldham who will supervise the planning<br />
and development of all Commonwealth activities and also co-operate<br />
as necessary with the authorities or committees appointed by the<br />
States to organise celebrations.<br />
Rear Admiral Oldham retired from the Navy in 1962<br />
after a long and distinguished career. He served in many ships of<br />
the Royal Australian Navy and was Captain of H. M. A. ships " Swan",<br />
" Warramunga", " Australia" and " Sydney". At the time of his<br />
retirement he was Flag Officer in Charge, East Australia Area.<br />
