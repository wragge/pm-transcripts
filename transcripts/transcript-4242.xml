FOR PRESS 29 SEPTEMBER 1976<br />
ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE B. H. P. PLANT GEELONG<br />
I am very pleased to be here today to open B. H. P's new<br />
Geelong rod rolling mill.<br />
B. H. P. is of course-oneof the major contributors to<br />
industrial development in Australia, and the new mill will<br />
be an important addition to industry in Geelong.<br />
When the mill is fully operational it will provide jobs<br />
for over 100 people and most of these will be recruited locally.<br />
The jobs and income generated by the operation of the mill<br />
will help, in turn, to maintain and create jobs in other<br />
industries in Geelong.<br />
As leader of' a Government which believes in the enormous<br />
contribution private enterprise can make to Australian<br />
prosperity, I am naturally delighted to see the confidence<br />
with which B. H. P. is planning for the future.<br />
There can be no sustained recovery without a strong and healthy<br />
private sector. Since the election last year, the Government<br />
has introduced a large number of measures to help private<br />
enterprise get back on its feet.<br />
The bloated public sector is being trimmed down. Government<br />
spending has now been brought under control. The size of<br />
the Federal Public Service has been, and is now being further,<br />
reduced. By June next year there will be 26,000 fewer<br />
Federal Government employees than under Labor's guidelines<br />
for 1975-76.<br />
A major objective, of course, of this restraint on Government<br />
is to make way for expansion in the productive private sector.<br />
Many firms have now accepted the challenge. B. H. P. is setting<br />
a valuable example.<br />
In the steel industry alone, B. H. P. has some $ 366 million of<br />
projects approved and at various stages of development.<br />
At Port Kembla, Newcastle, Whyalla and in coal mining, these<br />
projects alone, I understand, will provide some sixteen hundred<br />
jobs over the next four yeaLrs. 2 </p>
<p>B. H. P. is also involved in other major projects which<br />
could involve very large capital investments.<br />
Among these is the North West Shelf oil and gas venture,<br />
which will be the biggest development ever undertaken in<br />
Australia, and which could involve the investment<br />
of over $ 2,000 million. purchase<br />
of an interest in the Shelf has lifted Australian ownership<br />
to nearly fifty percent. And the recently announced partnership<br />
with Shell has brought into the project an international<br />
comapny with great technical and financial capabilities.<br />
Unless business picks up the challenge, unless private<br />
enterprise shows that it can do the job, Australia will not<br />
realise the great potential that we all know is there.<br />
The Government's job is to create the conditionsin which<br />
enterprise and initiative can expect decent rewards,<br />
in which it is possible to plan for the future and not see those<br />
plans disrupted by ill-considered Government action.<br />
This year we have introduced a number of important tax reforms<br />
as well as specific incentives for business designed to<br />
create those conditions.<br />
Among the principal measures introduced by the Government<br />
since coming to office are a 40% tax allowance for investment<br />
in plan: and equipment, that is available for investment<br />
expenditure by all sectors of the economy; exemption of<br />
new oil discoveries from the levy on crude oil; phasing<br />
out over a perlod'. of three years of the levy on coal exports;<br />
a greatly reduced write-off period for mining development<br />
expenditure that will assist with cash flows of new projects,<br />
as well as deductions for expenditure on developing port<br />
facilities; a new system of trading stock valuation adjustment<br />
that applies at a rate of at least S0% to 1976-77 business<br />
incomes. This-will give companies a very substantial tax<br />
off-set in future years.<br />
W1! e have thus set the framework for the private sector to increase<br />
investment, raise production and to take up the unused<br />
resources in the economy. There are increasing signs now<br />
that Australian enterprise is beginning to expand again after<br />
the damage suffered in the last few years.<br />
A substantial number of new projects have been put on the<br />
drawing boards this year those that have been publicised<br />
and drawn to our. attention will involve estimated. expenditure<br />
of very _ sllostantial sums. These are primarily mining ventures<br />
but also involve investment in building and construction, motor<br />
vehicle plants, oil refineries and miscellaneous other industries. 3 </p>
<p>Some of these have already been announced as firm<br />
programmes and expenditure is already under way.<br />
Many of them will involve the injection of overseas funds.<br />
Another company which has made an investment decision of<br />
particular significance to Geelong is Ford Australia Limited.<br />
Ford responsded to the Governme * nt's policy of encouraging the<br />
private sector and to the Government's motor vehicle<br />
plan by deciding to invest $ 72 million to build a new range<br />
of Australian cars. This would not have occurred had it<br />
not been for the modifications made to the motor vehicle policy.<br />
This investment will mean continuing employment in the company's<br />
Geelong operations. We look to every business to invest<br />
in its future and the future of Australia and hence to make<br />
a positive contribution to economic recovery. There is<br />
an important contribution to be made to recovery by everyone<br />
who works in industry employees and management.<br />
We all recognise that good industrial relations are going<br />
to be a major factor in reviving the economy. Management<br />
can make one of its most important contributions to recovery<br />
by taking company employees into its confidence by encouraging<br />
recognition of the common interests everyone has in a profitable<br />
and successful enterprise.<br />
B. H. P.' s new rod rolling mill is a welcome development particularly<br />
for Geelong. It embodies the latest technology, and it will<br />
produce a higher quality, closer tolerance product than other<br />
Australian mills.<br />
AustraliLap. wire industries, its neighbour and principal<br />
customer, will benefi~ t particularly from its operations.<br />
I congratulate all those who have played a part in its<br />
planning and development. It gives me great pleasure to declare<br />
the mill open. 000000000 </p>
