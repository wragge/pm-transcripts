6 OCT 1967<br />
LUNCHEON IN HCNOUR OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF NEW ZEALAND, THE RT. HCN. KEITH HOL. YOAI<br />
AT FARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA 3RD OCTOBER, 1.67<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister: Mr Harold Holt<br />
Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
WVe have become accustomed ' n Australia to an invasion<br />
at this time of year from New Zealand to the detr'ment of our overseas<br />
balances, and I understand that yesterday's sporting event in Sydney saw<br />
this fulfilled in the order of 1, 2, 3. I don't quite know what the cost will<br />
be to Australia from the visit here the very opportune. timely and happy<br />
visit of the Prime Minister, but at least ths is something we brought upon<br />
our own heads because he is here by invitation of the Commonwealth<br />
Government and we welcome him very warmly indeed.<br />
He has brought with him his Minister for Defence, Mr<br />
Thomson, Mr Laking, the Head of his Department of External Affairs and<br />
General Thornton, and we welcome all of these to the discussions which have<br />
already commenced with them.<br />
By a happy coincidence we have with us today a group of<br />
distinguished members of the Lok Sabha, the Parliament of India, and to<br />
you, Mr Speaker Sanjiva Reddy and your colleagues of the Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Association, you are amongst your fellow CPA members and<br />
it has added to the felicity of this occasion to have you here with us. nd I<br />
am sure you welcome this opportunity of seeing the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand in person. Keith Holyoake has been with us before, but he wears a<br />
couple of hats, and he came on earlier occasions as Foreign Minister.<br />
This is the first time, : n my recollection of him that he has made an official<br />
visit as Prime Minister of New Zealand, and indeed, I think this is about the<br />
second visit of an official kind by a Prime Minister of New Zealand in our<br />
history. Mr Holland was here at one point of time it may be this is the<br />
second time subject to Mr Holland.<br />
Keith Holyoake has been Frime Minister of New Zealand<br />
since December, 1967. .' hen I was over there earlier this year. and this<br />
was the first official visit by an Australian Prime Minister for just on twelve<br />
years he and I were described as the Anzac twins. Now you will be able to<br />
judge for yourselves how far he has got to carry that particular label. There<br />
are quite a few people in Australia who would feel there is an injustice being<br />
done to you, Keith. I don't know whether it is because you and I both'<br />
smile too often. I am often accused of doing that. Certainly we have both<br />
been in the Parliament of our country for the same period of time. You got<br />
away to an earlier start in 1i-32 but you hit one hurdle which kept you out for<br />
three years, and this has enabled me to match you in length of service in the<br />
Parliament our thirtysecond :) er in the National Parliament of our country.<br />
W. e were both Deputy Leaders of our parties for eight years<br />
and that is a very chastening apprenticeship, I can assure you. You have come<br />
through that to lead your Government since 1S6C, some six years before I<br />
came to office, and there are one or two people in this room who anticipate / 2 </p>
<p>r: I,<br />
that I won't be able to match your longevity in that particular role.<br />
In point of fact, you have now become, subject to the<br />
length of service as head of his government of Fresident Ayub Khan, the<br />
doyen amongst the Frime Ministers of the Commonwealth. This again is<br />
a rather sobering thought. Our occupational hazards don't apparently lead<br />
us to a long tenure and you are to be congratulated on being as long as you<br />
have in your particular office.<br />
Again there is a point of kinship in that you were returned<br />
at the general election your held on the same day last year as we held ours<br />
in Australia so that we can claim these points of similarity, but I believe our<br />
thinking goes more closely In line than that. And I have been very glad in<br />
my own discussions with you always to find an . dentify of view from you as<br />
the Head of your Government with that held by the Head of the Australian<br />
Government on many of the problems with which we have to deal together.<br />
.' i. th so many things In common, and with so many common<br />
interests, it is natural that we should communicate frequently, and now<br />
on this occasion, consult directly with each other to the advantage, I hore,<br />
of our two countries. Australia and New Zealand have a common cultural and<br />
historical heritage. have a common language, a common belief in<br />
democratic tradition, in the rule of law. differ to a degree as to the<br />
form of our Parliamentary ' nstitutions you have the misfortune to be without<br />
the benefit of guidance from an Upper Chamber, but we have a common<br />
interest in our two countries in the peace, stab'lity and economic rrogress<br />
in this area of the world.<br />
I said a little earlier that this was your first official visit<br />
in your capacity as Prime Iv. inister, and unfortunately in a sense it is<br />
very brief visit and a vworking visit in which much has to be concentrated here<br />
in Canberra in the time we have available to us. And I do hope that you will<br />
and please accept this as a formal invitation from me on behalf of the<br />
Government and people of Australia I do hose you will take an opportunity<br />
to spend a longer time vw. th us on an official visit in which you can get beyond<br />
the National Capital itsel and see sonrething of the fascination and interest of<br />
the three million square miles of territory that we can open up for you.<br />
You country and ours have been close toget her thrcugh<br />
many of the crises of our times. V. e fought together in two World 7! ars to<br />
resist aggression and to preserve the freedom of small countries, and stablished<br />
together what we both proudly acclaim as the A. NAC tradition. . Ve are both<br />
active members of the United Nations, and despite the smallness of your<br />
population, you have achieved there an influence and a significance out of<br />
all proportion to your numbers. You were recently a member of the Cecur'ty<br />
Cbuncil. You have had one of your countrymen a Fresident of the Assemrnbly<br />
of the United Nations. We are both active inside the Commonwealth of Nations,<br />
and in this area of the world, by geography we are faced together with<br />
similar problems and a similar outlook. H. e are Pacific by geography but<br />
we are also Pacific by national intent and we share a common desire for<br />
stability and progress in the countries of Asia and the Facif; c, V: e share a<br />
significant treaty relationship with the United Ttates through A NZUS and ; with<br />
our allies in the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. Vie participate in / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
efforts for wider regional endeavours through such institutions as ASPAC,<br />
the Economic Commission for Aia and the Far East, the Asian Develorment<br />
Bank, and in our work together in the Colombo Flan. And we stand together<br />
with our allies in Vietnam.<br />
The Frime Minister's visit reflects our desire for<br />
continuing friendly consultation in all matters of common concern. A visit<br />
by the Head of Government of his country would be an event of significance<br />
at any time, certainly it is most welcome and timely now, because our main<br />
purpose is to discuss together our shared defence policies in relation to<br />
Scuth-East Asia and the rrplication for both our countries of the changes in<br />
the British defence posture as outlined in the British White Faper. ' ie have<br />
forces working together in Vietnam and we contribute together to the<br />
Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
We have been reviewing our situation there. V'e are<br />
not attempting to reach final decisions at this point, but the talks with you<br />
and your Defence Minister and members of your official party are part of<br />
continuing close consultat'ons which we have with you and with other mutually<br />
interested governments over foreign policy and defence matters. Australia<br />
is neither at the commencement nor the ccnclusion of that process. In come<br />
respects there is time ahead of us. but planning is important now and we need<br />
to know what is going on in the mind of each other.<br />
Already '. ve have found our exchanges last night and earlier<br />
today, and those to be continued through the day, of value to our own thinking<br />
as we hope they will be to yours. There wil' bs naturally other matters on<br />
which you will wish to consult with us, and I know you have had talks vith<br />
my colleague, the Deputy Frime Minister and Minister for Trade, and this<br />
visit is, I hope, not just a rare event to be thought back on as something which<br />
happened in the history of our two countries. I hope it will be the beginning<br />
of a much more frequent process of consultation which I was able to touch<br />
off myself in January, and which I hope you, w'th your own further visits and<br />
those of your Ministerial colleagues here will be able to promote as time<br />
go-s on. I think I did mention to you in Newv Zealand that we had<br />
adopted a rather enlightened policy of enabling Members of this Parliament<br />
to travel at public e: xense to your country as they saw the necessity, so that<br />
we should get to know each other better. are working together on our<br />
Anzac Scholarships which I hope will also lead to a warmer and deeper<br />
understanding of each other's problems. In these ways we hope to manifest<br />
our conviction that so far ahead as our destiny lies, we see Australia and New<br />
Zealand going closely hand in hand together.<br />
I am now going to ask the Leader of the Opposition to<br />
support me before I invite all present to join me in drinking your very good<br />
health. </p>
