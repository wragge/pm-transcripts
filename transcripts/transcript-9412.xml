    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />INTERVIEW WITH ANN SANDERS, RECORDED 3 NOVEMBER 1994 FOR<br />AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AWARDS,<br />NOVEMBER 1994<br />E&amp; EO PROOF COPY<br />AS: It's easy for us Australians to pull down the so-called tall poppies do<br />you think that energy would be better spent paying tribute to our great<br />achievers?<br />PM: Well, getting poppies up is what it is all about, and there has been a lot<br />of concentration on tertiary education in this country and not<br />unreasonably but seeing people come through with real attainment's<br />in vocational education is wonderful for them, the institutions and the<br />country.<br />AS: One of the first things you did as Prime Minister in the vocational<br />education and training area was push for the establishment of a<br />national body why was this such an important goal?<br />PM: Because vocational education, or TAFE, has been the Cinderella of<br />Australian education, and we had 60% of the output of our Year 12<br />students coming out other than into tertiary education and many of<br />them being left untrained. The point of getting TAFE up to a National<br />system, and giving it national standing was so that anyone with a<br />vocational certificate should have not just an equal, but perhaps even<br />better chance of finding work and standing in educational terms in the<br />community, but to do that we had to bring TAFE together as a national<br />system. And so the Australian National Training Authority was a<br />devise we used to do that.<br />AS: Because TAFE courses and vocational training are often compared to<br />universities and schools does the former get the recognition that it<br />deserves, from the Government?<br />r 1<br />(: Lj</p>
<p>PM: It's getting it from the Government, but it hasn't had the standing and<br />the recognition in the community. And this is a great pity because<br />often the people who are trained, more often than not indeed, the<br />people who are trained vocationally are entirely useful, and<br />immediately useful to their employer, and they can start charting<br />strong career paths for themselves. There is a bit of snobbery still<br />about a tertiary education, where in fact the strength and the diversity<br />of courses now in TAFE really gives us a tremendous opportunity to<br />bring the whole vocational education system up, and to give young<br />people a real chance to not only set a career path, but change it when<br />they feel like it to do something else, and to keep that relevance to<br />work.<br />AS: You have often connected the future of young Australians to the Asian<br />market, telling students to get smart, get a job and help us win markets<br />in Asia. On the eve of the APEC Forum, how important are skills to get<br />us into Asia?<br />PM: They are entirely important. Australia's great comparative advantage<br />in the Asia-Pacific is its education system there is no country in Asia<br />with an education system as strong as ours. And selling innovative<br />product, elaborately transformed goods, internationally traded<br />services, are all the things that Australia can do if we can open these<br />markets up. The point of APEC is to open all these markets up, but<br />then we have to follow through, and of course, we will follow through<br />better if we have a trained and skilled workforce. Again, all the roads<br />lead back to vocational education.<br />AS: We are already technologically smart and leaders in some of these<br />fields how far can we go?<br />PM: Australian pure research and applied research and innovation is really<br />at the cutting edge. What we have now got to do is improve our<br />marketing and our access to markets, and Australia is now<br />concentrating on the Asia-Pacific, and market access as never before.<br />So, if the Government keeps a premium on education and training and<br />particularly in those areas where the premium hasn't existed in full<br />before such as TAFE and vocational education then we will be in<br />first-rate shape to really fully participate in this growth.<br />AS: Finally Prime Minister, do you have a personal note to the finalists of<br />the Awards tonight?<br />PM: Well first of all I would like to congratulate each and every one of them.<br />Those who are coming through as trainees, who have come through a<br />certificate course, to those who are the trainers, to the institutions this<br />is the sort of acknowledgment I am glad to see being attached to TAFE<br />and vocational education because Universities are very strong now,<br />and they're strong enough to look after themselves, so I don't mind</p>
<p>saying that I am a TAFE champion I'm a vocational education person,<br />and so tonight is the sort of recognition that I am very pleased to see.<br />AS: You're a dad too, what about encouragement to the parents of the<br />students here tonight?<br />PM: I think parents are now getting onto TAFE. I think they are<br />understanding that there are tremendous career paths here, and that<br />students can change them and there is that view that if your<br />child.... you have ambition for them becoming university students, and<br />perhaps they don't, there is going to be a system sitting beside the<br />universities just as strong, and just as good, and I think that is a very<br />optimistic point for many Australian parents today.<br />AS: And a good point on which to end. Thank you very much for your time<br />today.<br />PM: Thank you.<br />ends.</p>
