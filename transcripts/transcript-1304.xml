PPP' PRI.. E INISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
at 1:-1alaysian State Dinner, Kuala Lumpur 27TH APRIL, 1966<br />
Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers, Excellencies, gentlemen.<br />
I am delighted to pay my first official visit to Malaysia<br />
as the Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
I am, as you may be aware, no stranger to the charm of<br />
your country and the warmth of your hospitality.<br />
My last visit was in September, 1964, when Commonwealth<br />
Finance Ministers rc here.<br />
Even in the limited time available for observation since<br />
my arrival this morning it is readily seen that M'alaysia has<br />
continued its solid progress and development.<br />
My colleagues and I have greatly appreciated the<br />
opportunity you provided to us to hold discussions today with<br />
yourself and members of the Cabinet.<br />
This has given us a body of useful knowledge and a<br />
valuable insight into the policies you are pursuing.<br />
My colleagues and I appreciated the privilege we were<br />
given today of an audience with His Majesty the Yang Di-Pertuan<br />
Agong. You Sir, and many of your fellow Ministers and your<br />
senior officials have greeted me as old friends.<br />
There is in our consultations and exchanges an intimacy<br />
and an underlying mutual respect which has aeveloped over many<br />
years of close co-operation.<br />
This fueling of close friendship gives an aaaed depth<br />
and value to the continuous interchange between our two countries<br />
in so many fields.<br />
M1alaysia has overcome many difficulties in recent<br />
years. The successful way in which you have met and overcome<br />
the challenges that have arisen is a clear indication of the<br />
inherent strength and resilience of your multiracial community.<br />
Hand in hand with the effort to preserve your sccurity,<br />
you have made rapid advancement in the economic and social fields.<br />
It was good to learn from you personally today, Tun<br />
Razak, of your Government's rural development programme.<br />
This importpnt activity clearly owes much to you for its<br />
inspiration and its effective and purposeful execution.<br />
The co-operation between our two ccuntrics is now a<br />
matter of record and history having developed ovr a period of time </p>
<p>in many areas affecting the national life of both of us.<br />
We are joined along with other Commonwealth countries<br />
in military arrangements for defence and security.<br />
The relationship between the Armed Forces of our two<br />
countries is a close one.<br />
Our two countries share a determination to preserve<br />
national independence, stability and freedom<br />
; e are glad to assist you with technical assistance and<br />
to have your young men and women at our universities and technical<br />
institutions in substantial numbers.<br />
Our trade expands steadily and thure is a growing<br />
Australian investment here.<br />
It is a refreshing experience to visit Kuala Lumpur with<br />
its individuality, its atmosphere of modern progress and colourful<br />
growth. For Australians, develcpment-minded as we arc, this is<br />
a stimulating atmosphere.<br />
We feel very much at hone too, in your democratic<br />
environment and we admire the flexibility of outlook and the<br />
political wisdom which , alaysian leaders bring to the country's<br />
complex national affairs. </p>
