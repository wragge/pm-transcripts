TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO TIlE -' L3OURNE ROTARY CLUB<br />
Today I want to talk about the role of the Government in<br />
political and legal and social reform.<br />
There are many aspects of Australia's institutions where reform<br />
, is needed. Reform is needed wherever our democratic institutions<br />
work less well than they might. Reform is needed wherever the<br />
operation of the law shows itself to be unjust or undesirable<br />
in its consequences. Reform is needed wherever our institutions<br />
fail to enhance the freedom and self-resoect of the individual.<br />
The Liberal Party chose its name because it saw itself as a Party<br />
which would provide not merely responsible management of the<br />
nation's affairs but also progressive and enlightened refcrm.<br />
The Liberal Party in its turn inherited a great political tradition<br />
a tradition which has been a major force in building one of<br />
the most democratic and humane societies in the world.<br />
The great achievements of this tradition included in the 19th<br />
century: the ending of transportation and the establishment of<br />
a society of free people, responsible representative Government,<br />
the secret ballot, the factory acts which hel! ed to secure decent<br />
working conditions for Australians, and later the system of tariff<br />
protection to secure employment opportunities the concept of a<br />
fair wage and the arbitration system.<br />
Political leaders working in this tradition wrote into the<br />
Constitution the power of the Commonwealth Government to provide<br />
aged and invalid pensions and shortly after Federation they were<br />
introduced.<br />
These moves show that Australia has always been a country where<br />
constructive reform has been welcomed and encouraged. Achieving<br />
a better life for all Australians through progressive reform will<br />
be a continuing concern of the Government.<br />
The debate in Australian politics has never been over whether<br />
reform is desirable.<br />
Australians, whatever their politics, are too much realists to<br />
believe that no further improvement is possible and too much<br />
idealists to refuse to take action where it is needed.<br />
The debate has rather been about the kinds of reforms and the<br />
methods of reform which are desirable. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is axiomatic that the costs of reform should not outweigh<br />
the benefits gained. In particular, reforms should enhance<br />
the capacity of people to cope with their problems, to achieve<br />
and enjoy a better and more satisfying life.<br />
One of the most tempting approaches to reform for a politician<br />
is to try to solve problems simply by providing more and more<br />
money. There is,. of course, much that money can do but when inflation<br />
first gets under way the Government's coffers-are brimming<br />
over with tax receipts there is an almost irresistable temptation<br />
to start throwing money at every problem that is identified.<br />
Difficulties arise when the limits on what money can achieve are<br />
ignored and the other consequences of rapid increases in Government<br />
spending are disregarded.<br />
It is obvious that a very large number of problems which trouble<br />
Australians cannot be solved simply by spending more money.<br />
This is because they are not financial problems, but rather<br />
problems of human relationships, of organisation and approach.<br />
For example, a great deal has been spent on education in the<br />
last few years. School buildings and facilities have been<br />
improved. Yet despite this it is very evident that our system<br />
of education is still far from perfect.<br />
The core of education remains the quality of the experience that<br />
children have at school and that is affected by the quality<br />
of teaching, the way the school is organised, the attitudes of<br />
everyone in the school, the relationship of school to family<br />
and to the world beyond the school.<br />
These are not essentially problems of money. Insofar as money<br />
can contribute to their solution we must ensure that the money<br />
we spend is spent in the best possible way to secure the kind of<br />
education Australians want.<br />
Similar problems arise in the provision of assistance to<br />
disadvantaged people.<br />
Money is not enough. The way in which assistance is provided<br />
is of critical importance.' Assistance should be provided in<br />
a way that helps people to be independent in a way which<br />
" expands the opportunities of people to participate in and<br />
determine their future."<br />
The resources a poor family needs to break out of poverty include<br />
information about opportunities and the social security system<br />
as well as money. Government: assistance should not feed<br />
dependence but as far as possible expand people's capacity to<br />
meet their family's needs as they believe is required.<br />
An over-emphasis on the spending of money and a failure<br />
by Government to make responsible choices among competing claims,<br />
can also have other unforeseen consequences. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It can set off serious inflation and unemployment which damages<br />
many other aspects of the lives of Australians.<br />
The Report of the Poverty Inquiry warned about this. It said<br />
that Australian Governments should be wary of<br />
" falling into the inflationary trap of attempting to carry out<br />
so many social reforms or other public expenditures at once<br />
that they accelerate an inflationary spiral that does more damage<br />
to poor people than the assistance provided by the reforms."<br />
And again, it emphasised that:<br />
" lone element essential in any program to reduce poverty in<br />
Australia is that the rate of inflation be brought under conitrol.<br />
Unfortunately, some of the weakest sections of the Australian<br />
-community have suffered m ost as a result of the failure to see<br />
Government spending as being only one element in a program of<br />
responsible and progressive reform.<br />
The measures the Government is taking to bring inflation under<br />
control and to expand employment opportunities are in part an<br />
expression of our conviction that this is an absolute prerequisite<br />
to helping important groups of poor people.<br />
We are determined, despite our principal concern with restoring<br />
prosperity, to proceed with our program of reform, where this<br />
can be done without placing a-further strain on-the economy.<br />
There are many important areas ' where the reforms required do not<br />
involve major new spending commitments.<br />
We intend to push ahead in these areas.<br />
Let me now discuss some of these.<br />
The first of these areas-is political reform..<br />
Apart from the economy, the Government has been very concerned<br />
at certain trends in the way our political institutions have<br />
been working.<br />
our major concern in this area has been with the increasing<br />
centralisation of power in the Federal Government.<br />
Over time the Commonwealth has acquired a strong revenue base<br />
while the states have had constitutional power to act in a number<br />
of key areas.<br />
This divorce of funding from responsibility has been almost<br />
universally conceded to be an undesirable development.<br />
The Government believes that the proper approach to reform here<br />
is to restore appropriate financial autonomy to the States and to<br />
Local Government.<br />
As Australians become increasingly interested in political issues<br />
it is vital for the health of our democracy that there be<br />
readily accessible avenues for effecitve participation in<br />
Government. This cannot occur if more and more of the effective decisions<br />
on policy are made in Canberra. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
TheG o1-mn believes that key decisions should be taken as<br />
close as possible to the people affected.<br />
There is no virtue in uniformity if it frustrates the efforts<br />
of people to participate effectively in Government decisions<br />
which concern them.<br />
Accordingly, we are already beginhing to. implement one of the<br />
most radical and progressive reforms of our system of Government<br />
since Federation, designed to give the States ionce more a<br />
flexible and expanding financial base and Local Government as<br />
assured source of revenue.<br />
This reform has already been-considered at two Premiers Conferences,<br />
remarkable for the enthusiasm with which it has been welcomedon<br />
both sides of the political fence.<br />
The major principles of the new scheme have already been agreed<br />
upon.<br />
When it is fully implemented I believe it will be a major<br />
contribution to the health and efficient operation of our<br />
political system.<br />
A second concern of ours in recent years has been the inability<br />
of the House of Representatives to adequately scrutinise the<br />
Government's spending proposals.<br />
The ultimate power of Parliament over the Executive is control<br />
over, and scrutiny of, the Government's expenditure.<br />
This is a fundamental principle of our democratic system.<br />
With-out it the people's ultimate control over the Government is lost.<br />
In order to strengthen the Parliament's hand, the Government has<br />
moved to establish a Committee of the House of Representatives<br />
to review expenditure.<br />
This Committee has been based on the experience of the British<br />
House of Commons.<br />
The Committee will conduct its investigations throughout the<br />
year. It will therefore be able to explore more deeply selected<br />
areas of Government activity.<br />
The Committee will probably seek to cover a limited number of<br />
areas each year.<br />
But the very fact of its existence and lack of knowledge of the<br />
area for the next investigation will have its own salutary effect.<br />
Over time the Committee should make a very significant contribution<br />
to efficiency in Government spending.<br />
Let me also mention briefly a further deep concern of ours the<br />
great unlegislated increase in the personal tax burden which<br />
results from a combination of inflation with progressive tax<br />
scales. </p>
<p>Governments which want to increase the tax burden should have<br />
to say that this is what they want to do and legislate<br />
accordingly.<br />
As a result of inflation this has not been necessary.<br />
The reform of personal tax indexation we will be introducing<br />
will make Governments honest again.<br />
It will also strike a blow at one of the sources of the present<br />
inflation. I now want to turn to our policies to protect individual rights.<br />
A cornerstone of the Government's approach is a great concern<br />
with individual freedom.<br />
Policy in this area requires a balance to be struck between<br />
legitimate community interests and the fundamental importance<br />
of freedom to; the self-respect of the individual.<br />
One of the most highly valued possessions of western man is<br />
his privacy his right to exclude others from having knowledge<br />
of things that are his personal concern.<br />
Increasingly privacy is eroded in an age of technologically<br />
sophisticated data collection.<br />
It is time to weigh very carefully the interests of some people<br />
in having information against other people's right to withold<br />
or restrict access to that information.<br />
The Government is committed to legislate for the protection<br />
of privacy.<br />
The Law Reform Commission has been asked to examine and report<br />
on unwarranted invasions of privacy in areas under the control<br />
of the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
For example, invasions arising from information collected,<br />
recorded or stored by the Commonwealth Government Departments,<br />
Authorities and Corporations.<br />
The Commission will also examine what changes are needed to the<br />
laws of Commonwealth Territories to provide adequate protection<br />
for the individual with respect to: credit reference systems,<br />
medical, employment, banking and other records, listening,<br />
optical, photographic and recording devices to name but a few.<br />
Proposals for uniformity between Commonwe~' lth and State Laws will<br />
be considered by the Commission.<br />
The issue of access to information has another side to it.<br />
Ministers have also been requested to make themselves available<br />
whever possible to the media, and to ensure that their Departments<br />
make the greatest efforts to supply the public with information.<br />
A flow of information is vital for effective decisions, and the<br />
Government places great weight on consulation in the formation<br />
of policy. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
This is important Of course, not just in the formation of<br />
Government policy. Adequate communication and consultation<br />
lies at the heart of good industrial relations.'<br />
Our Industrial Relations Policy aims to encourage the formation<br />
of continuing mechanisms for communication in industry.<br />
The Government believes that through improved communication<br />
there will be a better understanding of the common interests<br />
of employees and employers.<br />
We are in a position to provide a lead in this area.<br />
The Government will be asking all Commonwealth Statutory<br />
instrumentalities to establish continuing mechanisms for<br />
consultation with employees.<br />
Unless measures such as this are taken there is a risk as<br />
Government and business organisations grow ever larger that<br />
close understanding between management and employees will become<br />
increasingly difficult.<br />
This must not be allowed to happen.<br />
Another issue raised by the growing scope of Government activity<br />
concerns the rights of citizens in relation to Government officials.<br />
The Government is concerned that people directly affected by the<br />
decisions of officials should have adequate rights of appeal<br />
and recourse.<br />
The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will be brought into<br />
operation later this year.<br />
The Tribunal will provide an independent review of the way<br />
ministerial and official discretions are exercised and will<br />
deal with appeals against administrative decisions on as wide<br />
a basis as possible.<br />
The Coalition Parties have consistently advocated and pursued<br />
this reform.<br />
When in Opposition, we also supported the concept of a Federal<br />
Ombudsman. The Ombudsman Legislation lapsed when the Parliament<br />
dissolved last year, and the Government is currently reviewing<br />
the legislation.<br />
The Ombudsman's task would be to investigate complaints or to<br />
initiate inquiries concerning administrative actions of<br />
departments and prescribed authorities and report to the body<br />
concerned. Provision could be made for the Ombudsman to report to the<br />
Prime Minister in cases where, in his opinion, adequate and<br />
appropriate action has not been taken with respect to his<br />
recommendations. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The growing complexity of Government, makes it very difficult<br />
for many people to know how best to get redress when problems<br />
arise. Lack of information is a particular problem for some<br />
disadvantaged groups and migrants. This makes the appointment<br />
of an Ombudsman all the more important.<br />
The Coalition Parties have long been concerned at the<br />
implications of the growth of bureaucracy both public and<br />
private in Australia.<br />
While the rights of Governments and others to information about<br />
individuals should be carefully controlled, citizens must have<br />
proper access to information about the activities of Government.<br />
If the Australian electorate is to be able to make valid<br />
judgements of Government policy, it should have the greatest<br />
access to information possible.<br />
I have requested that a submission be made to Cabinet which will<br />
provide the basis of framing legislation to this end.<br />
The Government is waiting in this area also for the Report<br />
of the Royal Commission into Government Administration.<br />
Alongside specific measures we have taken to check the growth<br />
of bureaucracy we are determined to ensure that citizens have<br />
adequate means of redress against unjust decisions or actions<br />
of the bureaucracy.<br />
The Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Ombudsman will be<br />
significant steps towards that objective.<br />
Particular problems of securing protection for individual<br />
rights arise in the case of disadvantaged groups or those in<br />
real economic need.<br />
The Government is committed to the view that those in need<br />
must have access to adequate legal aid.<br />
No one must be denied justice because of their economic<br />
position. The Attorney-General is at present reviewing the legal aid<br />
situation to determine the most efficient, economical and<br />
simple system of legal aid, which will enable all those<br />
requiring assistance to receive it.<br />
In some areas the Government believes that the current legal<br />
rights of some groups should be increased by new legislation.<br />
That is the case with land rights for aboriginals.<br />
The Government believes that effective action must be taken<br />
to secure land rights for aboriginals.<br />
The Government will introduce legislation to implement the<br />
policy of land rights for aboriginals. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Details will shortly be brought to Cabinet.<br />
There was a suggestion that legislation should pass through the<br />
Northern Territory Assembly, not through Federal Parliament.<br />
While some form of complementary legislation may be desirable,<br />
I would regard any move to shift the locus of legislation<br />
from Canberra to Darwin as a complete abdication of our<br />
responsibilities. The legislation will be introduced along with thorough<br />
consultation will all the people it affects.<br />
Recognition of the need to consult fully is basic to this<br />
Government's approach to Aboriginal Affairs and it has<br />
been a major point raised in our discussions with the<br />
Queensland's Government over Arukun.<br />
I have only been able today to touch on a few of the areas<br />
where the Government believes reform is necessary.<br />
They are all areas where significant forward steps are possible<br />
alongside the Governments economic strategy.<br />
Indeed, this strategy is itself a major set of measures to<br />
improve the quality of Australian life.<br />
We believe that our approach to reform truly expresses the<br />
social responsibility of Government.<br />
The reforms towards which we are working focus on the requirements<br />
of individuals for institutions which are responsible, adaptive<br />
and sensitive to their needs.<br />
Together they will help reverse the dangerous trend towards<br />
an ever more powerful, more centralised and intrusive<br />
Government.<br />
Along with our policies in other areas they will help to build<br />
an Australia in which people can confidently build their own<br />
lives. Despite our present economic problems we have an extraordinary<br />
opportunity to build in Australia a society of unmatched<br />
equality and 6pportunity based on a commitment to freedom<br />
and concern for the individual.<br />
This Government will play its part in achieving this great<br />
objective. 0000o00000 </p>
