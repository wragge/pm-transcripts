PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 DECEMBER 1990<br />
FIRST NATIONAL ROAD TRAUMA ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETING<br />
Members of the National Road Trauma Advisory Council met in<br />
Canberra today to consider road safety and health issues.<br />
Brian Howe, Bob Brown and I attended the inaugural meeting<br />
which considered the integration of health and transport<br />
issues.<br />
The eight member Advisory Council was established to allow<br />
health professionals and other community groups to help<br />
formulate road and vehicle safety standards. It is based on<br />
a proposal put to me by the Australian Medical Association<br />
and, in particular, Sir Dennis Paterson. The Australian<br />
Medical Association has done a great deal to support the<br />
Council's development. The State Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers have also agreed to support the Council and its<br />
proposals. Three year appointees are Sir Nicholas Shehadie, Professor<br />
Sir Dennis Paterson, Mr Gordon Trinca, Mr Bill Horman and Mr<br />
Peter Makeham.<br />
Dr Ruth Marshall, Mr Ray Brown and Ms Margaret Starrs were<br />
appointed for two years.<br />
The Council has been appointed to advise the Government on<br />
effective and achievable ways to cut further the number of<br />
people killed and injured on Australian roads. In<br />
particular, it will identify principal causes of road<br />
crashes and may propose national policies leading to a<br />
reduction in road trauma. While much of the emphasis in<br />
recent years has been on heavy vehicle safety, there is a<br />
continuing need to examine trends in passenger vehicle<br />
safety. For example, the Council will have before it a<br />
paper on future directions in occupant protection which<br />
includes discussion of devices such as air bags.<br />
The Council will report to the Premiers and to me annually<br />
and findings will be tabled in Federal Parliament.<br />
Details of appointees' careers are available from the Office<br />
of the Minister for Land Transport. </p>
