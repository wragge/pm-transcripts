PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 10 MAY 1988<br />
I have today sent the following message to President<br />
Mitterrand: Please accept my warmest personal congratulations, and<br />
those of my Government, on your re-election as President<br />
of France. Your historic achievement is very much<br />
admired here in Australia.<br />
The relationship between our two countries has grown<br />
steadily over the past seven years and I look forward to<br />
its further development during your second term of<br />
office. In particular, your country's very significant<br />
participation in Australia's Bicentennial celebrations<br />
has underlined our shared values, which will be<br />
highlighted again next year when the world celebrates<br />
the Bicentennial of the French Revolution.<br />
I am confident that our two countries will be able to<br />
develop further the bilateral relationship in a m ore<br />
mature atmosphere, which allows us to discuss all issues<br />
frankly and openly. I want you to know that your<br />
concerns about thIe recent violence in New Caledonia, the<br />
polarisation of communities and about the need for<br />
dialogue, are sentiments which are welcomed and shared<br />
in Australia. I am writing to you separately about this<br />
important issue.<br />
It is my sincere hope, Your Excellency, that your<br />
re-. election-will mark a new phase in constructive<br />
dialogue between our two friendly countries.<br />
once again, congratulations on your splendid victory. I<br />
wish you every success in tackling the tasks which lie<br />
ahead. Bob Hawke 0063354 </p>
