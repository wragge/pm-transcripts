HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.<br />
INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL ( NO. 3) 1967." L'&gt; R<br />
NOTES FOR THE MINISTER'S SECOND READING SPEECH.<br />
This Bill will give effect to proposals outlined in the<br />
Budget Speech. The proposal affecting most taxpayers is, of course, the<br />
increase of $ 26 in the amounts of the concessional deductions<br />
allowable for maintenance of dependants. The increase is to apply<br />
over the full range of dependants for whom concessional deductions<br />
are provided. The deductions for a spouse, a daughter-housekeeper,<br />
an invalid relative and a parent will each be increased from $ 286 to<br />
$ 312, for a student child under 21 years of age and one child under<br />
16 years of age the increase will be from $ 182 to $ 208, and for each<br />
other child under 16 years from $ 130 to " 156. The allowance for a<br />
housekeeper is also to be increased from $ 286 to $ 312.<br />
Another concessionaj deduction for which an increase is<br />
proposed is the allowance for payments by a taxpayer to provide<br />
superannuation or insu-rance cover for himself and his family. The<br />
present limit of 8OO on the maximum deduction allowable each year<br />
is to be increased to l, 2OO.<br />
These increases in the concessional deductions will apply<br />
in assessments for the 1967-68 income year and subsequent years.<br />
For salary and wage earners, the benefits from the increased<br />
dependants' allowances will be reflected in reduced tax instalment<br />
deductions to become operative from 1st October next.<br />
The remaining amendmients proposed by the Bill apply to<br />
primary producers. In 1965 and again in 1966 the Government introduced<br />
temporary measures to assist woolgrowers who, because of the drought,<br />
advanced shearing dates during the 1964-65 and the 1965-66 income<br />
years. When this occurred the proceeds of two wool clips would have<br />
been brought to account for taxation purposes in the one year.<br />
Provision was, therefore, made for these woolgrowers to elect to<br />
transfer the net proceeds of the second clip to the succeeding<br />
income year, so that the proceeds were taxed in the year in which,<br />
in ordinary circumstances, they would have been received.<br />
It is proposed to continue the operation of-these provisions<br />
for the 1966-67 income year and subsequent years, and to extend them<br />
also to advanced shearings brought about by fire or flood.<br />
Another amendment proposed by the Bill will apply to<br />
primary producers who, because of drought, fire or flood, are<br />
forced to sell livestock. The present law enables a primary<br />
producer forced to sell stock in these circumstances to elect to<br />
have the profits of the sale taxed over a period of five years,<br />
if he -uses the proceeds of the sale principally for the purpose<br />
of re-stocking. </p>
<p>2-<br />
The Bill proposes an alternative m-ethod of bringing the<br />
profits of a forced sale to accounit for income tax purposes. In<br />
very general terms, a primary producer who uses the proceeds of<br />
the sale principally for re-stocking may, in respect of sales made<br />
in 1967-68 or a subsequent income year, elect to have the profit<br />
on the sale applied to reduce the cost for income * tax purposes of<br />
stock purchased to replace the stock sold. The effect of an<br />
election will be to defer payment of tax on -the proceeds of the<br />
forced sale until replacement stock purchased is sold in the normal<br />
course of carrying on business.<br />
In some cases stock may be replaced by breeding up a new<br />
flock or herd, instead of buying animals. When this is the case,<br />
a primary producer may specify an amount of the profit of the<br />
forced sale to be included in his assessable income of the year<br />
in which natural increase is bred.<br />
If, by the end of the fifth year after the year in which<br />
the forced sale occurred, any amounit of the profits of the sale has<br />
not been applied in either of the ways I have mentioned the amount<br />
will be included in the primary producer's assessable income of<br />
that year. A further proposal relates to the cost of su; bdivisional<br />
fencing constructed on land used in primary production. Atk present,<br />
this fencing is generally subject to depreciation allowances at<br />
the special rate of 20 per cent. It is proposed to permit the cost<br />
of this type of fencing to be wholly deducted in the year in which<br />
it is incurred. Boundary fences or fences around stock-yards are<br />
not included in the scope of this proposal. These will remain<br />
su; bject to depreciation allowances. The amendment will apply to<br />
expenditure incurred on subdivisional fencing during the 1967-68<br />
income year and subsequent years.<br />
The final proposal affecting primary producers is the<br />
continuation, without any limit as to time, of the special 20 per<br />
cent depreciation allowances on plant and structural improvements<br />
used wholly and exclusively for primary production purposes.<br />
A memorandum explaining each clause of the Bill is being<br />
circulated for the information of honourable members and I do not<br />
propose to go into further detail at this stage.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
