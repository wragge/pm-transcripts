OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE SIXTEEINTH CONFERENCE OF<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATION<br />
CANBERRA, A. CT. 2 OCTOBER 1970<br />
Spech y~ the Primne Minister,. Mr. johln Goto<br />
Your Excellency, Mr President, Mr Vice-Chairman, Leader of the<br />
Obpoosition, Mr Premier of Queensland, Mr Speak-er and Parliamentary<br />
Colleagues: Yesterday at a social occasion I welcomed you here to Australia and<br />
extended wishes for the success of this Conference. Now that you are met in the<br />
Chamber in which your deliberations will take place, I extend again on behalf<br />
of the Government of Australia, and I believe I can say on behalf of all Australians,<br />
our best wishes for the success of your deliberations in our country.<br />
You have much of which to speak, and yesterday you had to listen to much<br />
of what we had to say. I think that on this occasion, so that you can get on with<br />
what you will make your business, I will merely say some few sentencesa in<br />
welcoming you to this Chamber and to your work in it. But if those sentences are<br />
short, that is not to be taken as an indication in any way that the streg1 of feeling<br />
behind them is not strong and that the welcome is not very genuine.<br />
It is not for me to repeat what was said yesterday, and what Hi0 Excellency<br />
expanded on today, but I feel that at this and succeeding conferences much will<br />
depend that will affect the future of the world.<br />
In all the diverse nations of which His Excellency has spoken and which<br />
meet here, there does lie hope. And I believe this Conference and this Commonwealth<br />
Association will be successful as long as it never seekis to turn itself into a<br />
mini-United Nations, as long as it never seeks to pass resolutions which purport<br />
to be binding on all the members present, as long as it ' keeps to its charter of, bringing<br />
together Parliamentarians for discussion of problems and for meetings of people<br />
from the various countries of the Commonwealth.<br />
And now if I can say this without anybody seeing any political implications<br />
in it I quote " Let observation with extensive view<br />
Survey mankind from China to Peru"<br />
And thiC., indeed, is what this Commonwealth of Nations will be doing, spread as it<br />
is across the world, and the possibility of being a force for good across the world.<br />
Welcome. </p>
