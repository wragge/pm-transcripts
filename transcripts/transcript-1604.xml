VISITL O U1., CANADA AND UK<br />
N3 YORK, U1SA<br />
ADDRESZS TO THE AMEIRICAN/ AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT AT THES<br />
RIV*" ER CLUB " TH JUN-i, 1 W7<br />
I want to speak about matters which are of domestic concern to us but<br />
which I believe are also of importance in the relations of your country with<br />
my own. The mou we can devel6p our own economic capacity in the international<br />
field the more we can help strengthen the American position in our area of the<br />
world. I believe it to be an abiding interest of the United States of America, at<br />
the highest policy level, to assist Where it can to strengthen the economy and the<br />
international significance of a staupch ally and friend who can mean so much to<br />
America in our area of the world.<br />
Growth has been our major objective in the field of economic development<br />
and this has been spelled out in terms of people and capital of vision and<br />
enterprise. These things have been our watchwords since the end of Wlorld<br />
W ar 11. Our objective has been to make the nation secure, prosperous, able to<br />
help our less fortunate neighbours and play a proper part in the defense systems<br />
of the free world. Our needs have been people and capital. Our vision has been<br />
reflected in our long-standing relationships with Britain and America and a<br />
recognition of our special regional position in Asia. I have, as many of you<br />
will be aware, just come back from another visit to four countries of Asia wlich<br />
I think it would have been difficult for many heads of government to have taken<br />
as a general peregrination.<br />
Some might have got to one, or to two or to three of them, but it is a<br />
mark of the special position we occupy in that region that I was able to go in all<br />
friendliness and to be warmly received in such diverse countries with such<br />
diverse policies as Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan and Korea. And what I saw there<br />
heartened me tremendously in the vision I have of the kind of Asia which can<br />
develop in the future a vision which I am glad to say your President shares<br />
and in which I believe the other leading members of your administration fully<br />
endorse. The people and capital we. need have been coming but the pressures of the<br />
day are casting some shadows ahead to us. The United Kingdom, for example,<br />
is facing fundamental decisions, both in her economic relationship with Europe<br />
and in her military and strategic dispositions E~ ast of Suez. These are matters<br />
I have already discussed to some degree with Mr. Wilson and with President<br />
Johnson. I will be discussi ng them further with Mr. W., ilson in London next<br />
week. The Australian economy continues to thrive. The grQwth in gross national<br />
product last quarter compared with the corresponding quarter 12 months previoutly<br />
was 13% F. ' ihere had been a rise of about 2-1 per cent in price level over the<br />
period, partly as a result of government decisions increasing charges in various<br />
directions to help finance a growing defence bill. But the net growth, even<br />
taking that into account, remained considerable. The earlier period, however,<br />
to give a balanced picture, had been affected by drought conditions in some parts<br />
of Australia and an increase in farm income between the two periods was from<br />
266 million to 436 million US dollars, an important factor in the rise. But the<br />
increase in non-farm GNP was, nonetheless, very high at 10 per cent. .92/ </p>
<p>Vie shall take increasing strength in future years, thanks to the efforts<br />
which many represented heie today are making, from our growing export<br />
returns from quite dramatic mineral discoveries and a lessened requirement<br />
for oil imports if we continue to make useful discoveries of oil and natural gas.<br />
In the week before I left Australia there were five promising new discoveries<br />
three of oil, one was at Roma in Queensland which was estimated to be the<br />
best since the Moonie discovery. More than a thousand miles away, off the<br />
coast of Victoria, the ESSO-BHP people had a strike which, while it has not<br />
yet been fully assessed, is certainly mor promising. And over on the coast<br />
of WTestern Australia, just by Barrow Island, where a well had been sunk on<br />
another island, Pasco Island, there was, again, another very promising<br />
discovery. The other two discoveries were a natural gas strike just a few miles<br />
from the Coast of Victoria closer, indeed, to the shore than the earlier<br />
ESSO-BHP discoveries of natural gas and an important nickel discovery over<br />
in Wlestern Australia by a company in which Anaconda has a substantial<br />
interest. And I mention this as the experience of one particular week. I<br />
don't say we can do that every week, but we have been doing it in enough weeks<br />
over recent years to raise great expectations for us of the strength this will<br />
brin; to our external position.<br />
While the current state of the economy and I speak subject to dry<br />
conditions in some areas which raise a little concern for the season ahead and<br />
the wheat crop represents a generally favourable picture, our national<br />
requirements for defence and for development continue to place heavy<br />
requirements and pressures on domestic resources. Our manpower is fully<br />
employed. The migration inflow continues to be steady with a gross intake<br />
this year of about 140, 000. V; e have had one of our best trading years, with<br />
imports and exports likely to be close to balance.<br />
On the other hand overseas reserves, while still at a comfortable level,<br />
have been falling to some degree as a consequence of a combination of<br />
factors. We have had reduction in the level of capital inflow following the<br />
policies of restraint exercised by the governments of the United Kingdom and<br />
the United States of America and these are our two principal sources of<br />
capital. There is a reduced availability of overseas loan money. What is<br />
available calls for higher rates than we have been accustomed to pay.<br />
The Interest Equalisation Tax continues to irk us and operate against<br />
us quite unreasonably. Wrhile borrowings have been reduced, we have been<br />
repaying loans of the past. Our total government indebtedness to the United<br />
Kingdom for example, is now more than Å“ stg 100 million less than it was<br />
years ago. And there are overseas guided missile destroyers, submarines and<br />
the F-1ll aircraft.<br />
There are also our overseas disbursements for military aid in respect,<br />
for example, of operations in Vietnam and the contribution we are maling in<br />
Malaysia. We cannot afford a blockage in our growth systems without direcy<br />
affecting our defence capacity and our capacity to give useful aid to others.<br />
Britain and America have provided Australia with most of its capital<br />
since the war and, despite an increased amount generated internally, we<br />
remain a capital importer and are certain to continue that way. Actually<br />
per cent to 90 per cent of our fixed capital investment is generated within<br />
Australia. But it is the remaining 13 per cent which is of great value to us in<br />
opening up new industry and giving us new techniques. 3/ </p>
<p>7e understand the reasons why Britain and America have placed restraints<br />
on the outflow of capital. But we do not feel we are asking for special favours<br />
when we ask that you here in America consider some early relaxation of those<br />
restraints. cannot afford to have our defence and aid programme slip out of<br />
gear. And, remember, we have doubled our defence effort in the last four years.<br />
ie are also the third largest aid diver in net termsn per head of population. It is<br />
all given in the form of grants without conditions. There are mutual advantages<br />
for both our countries if our development in these fields continues.<br />
Defence expenditure has more than doubled since 1962-63. It is now running<br />
close to five per cent of gross national product and this percentage is I am<br />
informed only surpassed by the Unite: i 2tates and the United Kingdom, which do<br />
not have our higher rate of population growth and the degree of provision for<br />
housing and other capital works which accompany . that higher rate of population<br />
growth. withhold from consumption a higher percentage of our gross national<br />
product 27 per cent than any other country in the world except Japan.<br />
The impact of your Interest . iqualisation Tax is one exa. mple of a difficulty<br />
which persists for us on the capital market. You have granted exemptions to<br />
Canada and Japan, and we find it difficult to understand why Australia cannot<br />
receive the same benefit. 7. e are actually losing reserves to the United States on<br />
government capital account unless this borrowing is facilitated. Ou r existing<br />
government debt in New York is requiring repayment and interest charges at the<br />
rate of $ UC35 mcillion annually. Australian Government guaranteed corporations<br />
like the airlines and other instrumentalities also owe money in the United States<br />
and their repayment and interec: charges amount to up to an additional $ UG33 m.<br />
a year. These are continuing burdens, and we hope they will be understood<br />
sympathetically. And to get the full picture of our payments out to you, there is<br />
the growing dividend payment from increased United States investments in<br />
Australia and a degree of borrowing inside Australia over recent years by Unite d<br />
Statec corporations which in earlier times were able to turn to their own<br />
borrowing sources in the United States. Co we want these things to be understood<br />
csypathetically and, we hope, acted on appropriately.<br />
Our efforts to strengthen our position externally are frustrated to some<br />
degree not solely by your country by various policies which continue to<br />
operate against us. I've mentioned the interest equalisation tax, on which I<br />
believe vie have strong case. Our country has been a good ally of the United<br />
States none stauncher over recent years. 7e have not looked for a dollar of aid,<br />
but we have looked for a sympathetic and realistic understanding of some of these<br />
problems. In the last 17 years our exports to America have increased by only about<br />
half the increase of our imports from-the United States. To put it another way,<br />
today Australia imports $ US6C. 3-a Iead from America but exports only $ UC31.<br />
a head. In another form and I think this makes the point a little. mrre<br />
3raphically some 12, 03, 33. Australians import 6C. 33 dollars value per head<br />
from you, and some 23, 330, ; 3 Americans import less than 2. 2 dollars per<br />
head from us. And I have not taken into this account the difference in per-capita<br />
income in our two countries which, in 1965 amounted to 3, 502 dollars an<br />
American citizen and 1, S3dollars an Australian citizen. ! hen you take per<br />
capita consumption measured in terms of consumption capacity again the<br />
disparity beco--es all that much wider.<br />
Australia is, in fact, the fastest growing market, I understand, for<br />
American exports. As we grow and develop vie are going to buy more American<br />
goods, and in the defence field as we grow and strecgthen nationally we will be<br />
playing a larger part in the joint policies that we have in our area of the world,<br />
and, indeed, in the international situation generally. 2o you have special<br />
reasons, including self-interest, in supporting our growth. </p>
<p>The United States purchases from us less than half the value ($ US375 m.)<br />
of goods that we purchase from the United States ($ US80C And this<br />
unfavourable balance has been a chronic feature of the trade between our two<br />
countries for many years. VWe feel that on raw wool we have been given a raw<br />
deal. One of the major disappointments of the Kennedy round was that no<br />
American offer to negotiate a 50 per cent reduction in the wool duty emerged,<br />
although we had a very confident expectation from our earlier discussions that<br />
this would be so. Furthermore, the benefit of the reduction in the wool duty from<br />
34 cents a pound to 25-cents which was made in 1947 was quickly impaired two<br />
years later when the United States we having paid our quid pro quo for this<br />
arrangement introduced subsidy arrangements to encourage local production.<br />
America is, in fact, the only industrial country in the world to impose a<br />
duty on this raw wool, and it puzzles me that Australia should have only .1 of<br />
one per cent of its wool enter without this duty when more than 67 per cent of New<br />
Zealand wool enters the United States duty free. And I remind you that I speak<br />
for a staunch United States ally, not an unfriendly power. I might also note<br />
here our position on sugar, dairy products, meat, lead and zinc. These items<br />
comprise 70 per cent of the value of our exports to the United States of America,<br />
but eachof them is currently under threat of some restrictive action or<br />
legislation in America.<br />
These are anxieties in Australia about what the future holds in our trading<br />
relationships in all these commodities. We are watching with keen interest for<br />
the results of the Tariff Commission inquiry into the effects of imports on the<br />
American dairy industry, and into the need for restrictions on dairy products<br />
not at present subject to import quotas. These may be problems lying ahead for<br />
Australia. There are others imminent. The bills before your Congress<br />
proposing restrictive quotas on imports of meat and lead and zinc, and tighter<br />
restrictions on dairy products, would cut us back perhaps by $ UCS0m. in our<br />
present trade if they become law. You will understand the unease in our<br />
industries at this possibility.<br />
A cut-back in meat exports would be a matter of difficulty for us. The<br />
chances of alternative markets for meat exporters if they are restricted further<br />
in the United States are not good, because the only other major world markets<br />
are Britain and the European Economic Community.<br />
There is quite a long history to our meat transactions. It began as a story<br />
of growth by us to meet your need and we were supplying a type of meat which<br />
was not being supplied by the market here, the inferior quality meat for hamburgers<br />
and that sort of thing. Then at your request, we voluntarily limited our meat<br />
exports, but this was soon followed by more A, er ican restrictions. At present<br />
the latest American estimate of 1967 imports is 402, 000 tons being ab out 2, 000<br />
tons below the quota. So no quota applies. However since quotas are imposed<br />
if imports are estimated to exceed a " trigger" point the legislation sets an<br />
effective upper limit on imports. For 1967 this " trigger" point is 444, COO tons,<br />
or 24, 000 tons less than actual imports in 1963 when Australia agreed to restrict<br />
exports voluntarily. This suggests that we are losing ground, and the<br />
uncertainty is disturbing to our industry.<br />
The other field I mentioned lead and zinc also has shadows falling. The<br />
United States is the world's biggest market for lead and zinc and, as such,<br />
directly and indirectly affects all world exporters when restrictions are imposed.<br />
The recent slackening in demand has led to new proposals for the reimposition<br />
of quotas. No-one liked the old quotas, though we accepted them without too<br />
much protest, but if present intentions are carried out the new quotas would be<br />
more permanent and, under the proposed formula as we see it, they could lead<br />
to a progressive reduction in the rate of imports. Our industry considered the<br />
situation so serious that it arranged, for the first time, to submit evidence at<br />
the recent Senate Committee hearing. Spokesmen for the administration<br />
opposed the proposals and for this we are grateful. Rut the Commnittee reported<br />
favourably on the bill and the risk remains. </p>
<p>Another problem I shall mention is sugar. Y.' e would like o feel<br />
that as the world's largest sugar exportr after Cuba ( which, of course, has<br />
been denied access to American markets) we would be in line for more<br />
generous allocations when there were needs arising from short-falls in<br />
supplies against quotas. It is true we gained access to a lucrative<br />
American market when the break with Cuba took place But we did not<br />
take advantage of the 1963-64 world shortage to divert to more lucrative<br />
markets. 7. maintain . d exports to Am rica in excess of '? CO, C00 tons,<br />
thereby foregoing profits elsevihere.<br />
On wheat, I acknowledge with appreciation that th United States<br />
accepted an Australian request regarding the question of ' basing points'<br />
in the recently concluded international VWheat Agreement.<br />
But the overall result, even there, fell disappointingly short of our<br />
earlier stated objectives, and to secure any agreement at all we accepted<br />
the obligation of increasing what had been a voluntary provision of wheat<br />
aid to the extent of 130, ? C tons per annum to a commitment of 225, 00C tons<br />
per annum. Some of the anxieties I have rmentioned may not develop into<br />
hurtful events, but the possibility is there, and in a spirit of frankness and<br />
of friendship, I wanted to tell you how we feel about them. 7 e need<br />
stability in our trading relationships, just as you do. As a good friend, we<br />
prefer to speak about these things while there is still time for consideration,<br />
rather than grumble too much after the event.<br />
THE MIDDLE EAST<br />
Now if I could turn for a fevw minutes to two matters in the<br />
international field.<br />
have never been able to ignore the incessant condition of<br />
tension that has prevailed betvween Israel and the Arab States ever since<br />
Israel came into dxistence as an independent State. But I am sure all of us<br />
hoped it was not going to bring a major resumption of hostilities among those<br />
countries in the immediate area, or bring us a. d others so close to the brink<br />
of involvement as we may have come in the last few days.<br />
7 e have had at least ten years in which these tensions had been kept<br />
under some sort of control, ten years in which many of us had begun to hope<br />
that realism and tolerance, with the help of the United Nations, would<br />
ultimately bring a political settlement of th! s unhappy conflict.<br />
It is all the more depressing, therefore, that a conflagration has<br />
flared again, and in so doing has threatened to spread to the point of<br />
embroiling the great powers, and possibly a great part of the world, either<br />
directly or indirectly.<br />
At this point in time, there is nothing helpful in accusing either side<br />
of having started the trouble. e can only be thankful that the Security Council<br />
has at least managed to agree on a resolution calling for a cease fire. This<br />
was clearly the first thing that had to be done if we , vwre to avoid the prospect<br />
of another " World ar. </p>
<p>6.<br />
There is no disagreement among us all that the first thing to be<br />
done is to stop the fighting. Then we can look again all of us to see<br />
if, together with our friends, and through the United Nations, we can find<br />
ways of making it possible for both sides in this unhappy and long-lasting<br />
confrontation to live together in peace.<br />
Meanwhile, we in Australia are grateful for the unsparing efforts<br />
that the President and the Administration of the United States, and the<br />
Prime Minister and Government of the United Kingdom, together with other<br />
Governments, have made to brin3 the Security Council to a point of<br />
decision. VI ETNAM Cn Vietnam, I do not need to explain at length to this gathering<br />
why we are involved there. The short answer is because the Republic of<br />
Vietnam asked for our help in combating the attacks directed against it<br />
from the Communist regime in the North, and because we saw this<br />
Communist-inspired and direct -d agression as a threat to free people and<br />
small nations small nations in particular everywhere.<br />
V: gave our help because we believe the Republic of Vietnam has<br />
a right to secure the separate, independent status that was granted to it<br />
under the Geneva Agreements of 1934: that is people have a right to choose<br />
their own way of life and be free to pursue with confidence the social and<br />
economic development for which they yearn.<br />
The Communists in the North do not want this: they want to<br />
impose their own communist way of life on South Vietnam. In Australia,<br />
we believe that if the Communists were to succeed in this, then all Nations<br />
in South East Asia would come under the same kind of pressure.<br />
This is the Communists' proclaimed programme of ' National<br />
Liberation". But properly understood, this programme is not national<br />
it is the programme of the Peking brand of international communism. It<br />
does not liberate to produce a free society it operates to produce anoth<br />
satellite in the Communist orbit.<br />
Our aim, therefore, is both defensive and constructive. Wa ew ant to<br />
see the ambitions of people in the new countries of Asia develop their own<br />
new societies, offering the material and social benefits that other modern<br />
societies now enjoy, but preserving their own national and cultural identities.<br />
Neither we nor you are bent on overthrowing the present regime in<br />
North Vietnam. Strongly as we reject the Communist philosophy an society,<br />
we have no aggressive aims against North Vietnam, nor against its neighbour and<br />
supporter, Communist China. Let them work out their destinies free from<br />
our interference. 3ut they must not interfere with others.<br />
No aggressor can expect his bases and communications and his<br />
war-making capacity to remain immune from attack. This would grant him an<br />
unacceptable military advantage, and j eopardise more lives in the villages<br />
and battlefields of the South. It is for these reasons that we in Australia<br />
continue to support strongly limited, controlled and discriminatory military<br />
bombing of selected targets in the North. </p>
<p>7.<br />
The struggle may be long and bitter. 3ut there is progress. The<br />
Military campaign has not been won, but it is now certain that it cannot<br />
be lost. Despite the ravage and destruction of the war there is heartening<br />
evidence of consolidation in South Vietnam of military, political, social<br />
and economic progress.<br />
Air Vice Marshal Ky and his Administration have lasted longer than<br />
most people predicted, and in doing so have made significant gains not only<br />
in the estimation of their people but in the establishment of order and<br />
security. This is further encouragement to us to see out the issue in Vietnam.<br />
hope the end will come soon, but we cannot look forward to<br />
this with any confidence at the present time. The cost of the war in men and<br />
resources falls heavily on South Vietnam and the United Ctatec in particular.<br />
It is costly to my own country. V.' e are as eager as anyone else to end it.<br />
V: e are anxious to see any avenue to a settlement thoroughly explored, to<br />
seize any opportunity that right offer a credible advance to a settlement.<br />
The hard fact, however, is that not only is no settlement in sight,<br />
but the regime in the North shows no inclination at all despite the flurries<br />
of expectation that occur from time to time to be ready to talk of peace.<br />
All efforts, and there have been a number, to open any sort of negotiation<br />
with the North Vietnamese r1eime have completely failed.<br />
I know of nothing new in the diplomatic field that allows us to hope<br />
this situation might soon change. Until it does, we and you have no<br />
alternative but to continue to combat the aggression. V'' e must hope that a<br />
more realistic view of his prospect will lead the a-grssor finally and<br />
we hope in the not too distant future to the negotieting table. </p>
