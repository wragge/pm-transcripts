TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JULIE FLYNN, RADIO 2UE<br />
4 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JF: Prime Minster, how do you intend to handle the sensitive human rights<br />
issues on this trip?<br />
PM: Well, look, I think, more particularly, how do I want to handle the trip, I<br />
think, is the real issue. And that is, I see the visit, it is to Thailand, the<br />
second largest ASEAN economy, Laos and Vietnam within Indo-China.<br />
This is a part 6ft1he world where dramatic changes have been<br />
happening, particularly with the end of the Cold War not so long ago,<br />
we have seen the settlement in Cambodia, economic reforms in Laos<br />
and in Vietnam and dramatic growth in Thailand, and I am visiting the<br />
area, in a sense, to consolidate some of our interests there, to see at<br />
first hand what is happening there, and of course being there at the<br />
opening of this bridge which Australia has built and funded across the<br />
Mekong River, joining for the first time Thailand and Laos. So, it is<br />
part of the general development of our relationship with Asia, South-<br />
East Asia and the Asia-Pacific. And that is the key matter. Now,<br />
human rights will arise, discussions invariably do wherever there have<br />
been human rights violations in countries. We will be, I will be as<br />
forthright in putting our views about that as I was more recently in<br />
China.<br />
JE: Don't we have a problem with our own standing in the region given that<br />
we have had boat people in detention here for up to three or four<br />
years?<br />
PM: All the people in detention here have chosen to exercise their rights for<br />
further appeals under our court system. They have all been given the<br />
offer of being able to return to their countries and apply for permanent<br />
residence. They have not taken it up. There is no analogy here<br />
between human rights violations in this part of world, and Australia. </p>
<p>JF: What do you see as the major benefits for Australia from the bridge<br />
itself?<br />
PM: Well, I think it shows that Australia's engaged with the area in a<br />
constructive way. That is, we have now seen great changes in<br />
Australia in the ' 80s. Australia has become an open modern trading<br />
economy, we are engaged with these countries, we are seeing many<br />
Australian companies invest in these countries. It is part of what is<br />
going to set Australia up in the 21 st century, to provide jobs for<br />
Australians. The bridge, I think, is, in a sense, exemplifies Australia's<br />
interest and role in these countries, and I hope indicates to their<br />
Governments and their communities that we see them as not simply a<br />
commercial relationship, but a broader one where Australia can play a<br />
role, of course, as we did very tellingly in Cambodia.<br />
JF Some of our Aid organisations have expressed concerns that the<br />
bridge will actually bring some negative things with it. I think one of<br />
them has referred to the fact that AIDS is spread along major transport<br />
lines and that not all necessarily the transport in and out of the region<br />
will be good. Is that a concern you share?<br />
PM: Well there is a concern there, but do I share the concern, no I don't. I<br />
think it is a pretty high handed attitude to take to say to a country like<br />
Laos which has got a per capita income of $ 200 a year, $ 4.00 a week<br />
to say that is ok you can stay on $ 4.00 a week, providing our<br />
consciences are clear, and there is no complicating factors of any<br />
growth in your economy and society we, you know, some of middle<br />
class moralisers of Australia, will be happy and contented. I think<br />
these countries want to see themselves grow, they want to see their<br />
economies participate in the growth in the area, and how can they do<br />
that when they don't even have primary infrastructure. So, this is a<br />
piece of valuable primary infrastructure which both countries want, and<br />
which Australia has been happy to provide. Now, can I just say on this<br />
question of AIDS. Australia does run now a program between<br />
ourselves and Thailand about AIDS, education and management. But<br />
that is really not the issue, I think, here. The issue here is Australia's<br />
forthright sensible engagement with the area manifesting itself in this<br />
case in the building of some primary infrastructure funded by us and<br />
built by an Australian construction firm. That rounding further the<br />
engagement we had politically and socially with these countries.<br />
JF: Thailand and Laos have had a disagreement about who will manage<br />
the bridge. They seem to have come up with a resolution to that<br />
problem, do you think that will be a permanent solution?<br />
PM: I don't know, it is up to them to make decisions about these things.<br />
Thailand is somewhat taken for granted in Australia. This is the<br />
second largest ASEAN economy after Indonesia. It is growing very<br />
rapidly. Because we don't have any problems with it there is a bit of </p>
<p>view around Australia that we don't need to tend to the relationship.<br />
Well, I think we do. I think there are tremendous opportunities there,<br />
we have got many many companies operating there and the same<br />
opportunities I think are opening up in Vietnam and also in Laos.<br />
BHP, for instance, is in Vietnam, we have got many hundreds of<br />
companies now operating up there and I hope that some of the growth<br />
that exists in, say, Indonesia and particularly in Thailand through this<br />
bridge can sort of start to avail itself, or to be made available to these<br />
other economies in Indo-China; Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.<br />
Australia's concern for these countries beyond simply the commercial<br />
relationship to the political, the civil, strategic, the I think stands us<br />
in good stead.<br />
JE: You will be holding talks with the Thailand Government, what regional<br />
security issues do you expect to come to the fore, given that we are in<br />
a post Cold War era?<br />
PM: Well I think we have seen a lot of developments in that area together.<br />
I mean the Cambodian settlement was something which I think has<br />
cheered people up in the region no end. They have shown us all what<br />
we can do together. The Post ASEAN Ministerial Council Meeting,<br />
which is a strategic meeting on defence and security issues is now<br />
attended by us, by the United States. So, we now have a regular<br />
dialogue on security issues with the region and I think these countries<br />
are interested in the broader security issues. That is, you know, what<br />
is the region going to look like into the future with the Cold War<br />
overlay removed, concern about the maintenance of the American<br />
military presence in the area. Australia playing, if you like, a larger<br />
role in foreign policy and also in defence cooperation terms. These<br />
are the sort of things that I think people will wish to discuss.<br />
JF: Do you think that North Korea is a problem in this particular region?<br />
PM: Well it is a problem. It is a problem, and we have been urging North<br />
Koreans to open themselves up to inspection by the IAEA, the<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, and to date, of<br />
c ourse, this has been an on again off again matter with them. Largely<br />
this relationship is managed or North Korea's behaviour is examined<br />
by, obviously, South Korea and the United States. I hope that the<br />
North Koreans see the sense of putting there nuclear installations<br />
under international safe guards and abide with them.<br />
JF: While you are away, of course, the Government will still be going<br />
ahead with Budget and Employment statement preparation, do you<br />
accept the Governor of the Reserve Bank concerns about the need to<br />
keep the budget deficit down?-<br />
PM: Well I think the Government is doing that, and we have been<br />
preaching this for years, I think. In the ' 80s Australia led the world in<br />
the fiscal consolidation which it introduced. It was because of that we </p>
<p>4<br />
were able to expand the budget when we needed to in the recession.<br />
Something, for instance, that the United States couldn't do. Now is the<br />
time, I think, to pull the budget imbalance back, and the notion that the<br />
Government is basically going to be spending the proceeds of growth<br />
I mean, it will have that deficit heading down, as it should, as private<br />
investment picks up.<br />
JF: Thank you very much<br />
