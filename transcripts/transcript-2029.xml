VISIT TO THE U. S. AND<br />
CANADA 1969 718<br />
CANADA<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, ~ I<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON, ON ARRIVAL IN OTTAWA<br />
2 APRIL 1969<br />
My wife and I are delighted to be in Canada. I much<br />
appreciate this opportunity again to meet your Prime Minister, Mr.<br />
Trudeau, so soon after our talks in London.<br />
I look forward to our discussions here in Ottawa, and<br />
I am sure they will be of benefit to both our countries. I shall not,<br />
in a statement on arrival and before I have talked with Mr. Trudeau,<br />
presume to detail what we are likely to discuss.<br />
But some of the subjects of common concern are obvious.<br />
Canada and Australia have an interest in world peace and security so<br />
that all nations, no matter how small, can be free and live without<br />
fear. As Pacific nations, we are both concerned to see<br />
stability and progress in Asia, with genuinely independent, economically<br />
developing, self-reliant states, and we in Australia have played and<br />
will play an active role in regional co-operation.<br />
Another field for discussion could be the development<br />
of further contacts between Canada and Australia. The more we visit<br />
one another the better. I am very happy to accept Mr. Trudeau's<br />
invitation to visit Canada, and he and other Canadian Ministers will<br />
always be welcome in Australia. In fact, we are looking forward to a<br />
visit very soon from the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce,<br />
Mr. Pepin. Our two countries need to keep in touch and work together<br />
whenever we can. Although many miles separate Canada and Australia, we<br />
both have much in common. We both have a Pacific coastline and are<br />
both developing an industrialised society in a harsh environment. We<br />
both depend heavily on primary products to earn foreign exchange and<br />
are therefore greatly interested in freedom of access to markets for<br />
primary products and in realising payable prices for such products.<br />
And we both have large scale immigration programmes. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Our friendship is of long-standing and we share a common<br />
purpose in many international activities. We have been comrades-inarms<br />
in two world wars, in the fighting in Korea, and we have taken<br />
part together in U. N. peace-keeping operations.<br />
We were proud to take part in your centennial<br />
celebrations at Expo ' 67 in Montreal and we acknowledge the imagination<br />
and vision that made it such a success.<br />
As Pacific and Commonwealth partners, we should build<br />
an even closer relationship in the future. I am sure we will. </p>
