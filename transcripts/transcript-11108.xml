<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good afternoon, Steve.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Congratulations on your preamble. I have seen it for the first time</p>
<p> today, obviously, as the rest of the country has. And most of the</p>
<p> callers we've had today have been very complimentary.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well that's very good.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you heard it read out as opposed to just in your own head when</p>
<p> you were writing it, yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I've recited it on a number of occasions to myself but has</p>
<p> somebody read it out?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We've put it to tape, would you like to listen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would love to hear it.</p>
<p>[TAPE PLAYED]</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you reckon?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's great. I haven't heard it. That's a very</p>
<p> delightful and moving presentation of it and it sounds even, well,</p>
<p> it seems even better when it's recited so very well. Whoever</p>
<p> that was, she did a lovely job.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much of what's there is yourself and how much is Les Murray</p>
<p> or is impossible to actually separate it? I mean, is it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very hard to separate it. Some of the phrases are, the second</p>
<p> last paragraph, the one about the equal dignity with one tiny change,</p>
<p> that was all Les Murray's work. One of the earlier paragraphs</p>
<p> was all my work. It varies a bit but, I mean, Les certainly contributed</p>
<p> a lot of the poetry. I, after a lot of discussion with him and after</p>
<p> discussions with my colleagues, contributed a lot of the ideas. There</p>
<p> were some phrases there that are very much mine. I was certainly very</p>
<p> keen on referring to mateship because I see mateship as not a blokey</p>
<p> term but I see it as something that sums up the idea of looking after</p>
<p> each other.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We had a charming woman from Tookaruk rang us earlier in the programme</p>
<p> saying she calls her dog her mate, so mateship, she says, is not at</p>
<p> all anything to do with males.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no it's not. Look, it may originally have had that connotation.</p>
<p> And you've got to remember that there's a whole generation</p>
<p> of Australians to whom the notion of male mateship in adversity in</p>
<p> war and so forth is part of our history. But in a more contemporary</p>
<p> way it expresses the fact that we look after each other in adversity</p>
<p> Â when you help people in fire and flood and you pull people</p>
<p> out from under, you know, a collapsed ski lodge at Thredbo. All of</p>
<p> that is an expression of the volunteer and community spirit of our</p>
<p> country. And the reason why I was passionate about having the word</p>
<p> there was that there isn't another constitution in the world</p>
<p> that would have a preamble that would have that word in it. And doesn't</p>
<p> that mean that it's something that we really own and is quite</p>
<p> distinctive and something that we know ourselves by almost intuitively.</p>
<p> And that transcends any kind of blokey origin of the word.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I know a lot of people have been putting their oar in. Another caller</p>
<p> said would it be possible at the very beginning to start with Âwe</p>
<p> the people'.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it would be. The reason I didn't want to do that is it</p>
<p> seems so derivative of the Americans. I mean, that's an American</p>
<p> expression, Âyou the people', a very, very American expression</p>
<p> and Les and I both wanted to avoid that. We wanted something that</p>
<p> was free of too many Âwe the peoples' and Âhumbly relying</p>
<p> on the blessings' which is language that may have belonged nicely</p>
<p> to an earlier period and another country but this is Australia at</p>
<p> the close of the 20th Century and I wanted something that</p>
<p> was in the language of that century. It was uplifting without over</p>
<p> the top because we're not an over the top people when it comes</p>
<p> to patriotic declarations. We are not as expressive, overtly expressive,</p>
<p> about these things as are Americans and we should never try and ape</p>
<p> Americans with these things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Not surprisingly some of the whingers have come out of the woodwork</p>
<p> already. Peter Yu, the Kimberley Land Council executive says it's</p>
<p> wimpish, dismissive of indigenous people, he says it's an aggressive</p>
<p> document from a small-minded man, which is a pretty rude way to react</p>
<p> to it. Alex Buso, who's regarded, apparently, as a prominent</p>
<p> author and playwright, says it's not a gripping read and it dates</p>
<p> back to the 50s. Both reasonably predictable criticisms I would imagine.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly Peter's is. I mean, Peter is a constant critic</p>
<p> of mine from the Aboriginal community. I don't think anything</p>
<p> I could Â I mean, the only thing that I could write that would</p>
<p> make him happy, I'm afraid, on this sort of issue would be something</p>
<p> the great bulk of the rest of the community would find unacceptable.</p>
<p> If you go too far in that area you will lose the rest of the Australian</p>
<p> community. They don't want something that is politically controversial.</p>
<p> They want something that recognises the truth and that is that the</p>
<p> indigenous people were here first and we honour their continuing culture.</p>
<p> Now, that's what the document does.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If the move to a republic gets voted down, Prime Minister, is there</p>
<p> still a necessity to have a new preamble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this is a republic neutral preamble. This will go into the Constitution</p>
<p> if the people vote for it whether or not we are a republic and it's</p>
<p> been deliberately designed. I mean, I'm going to vote against</p>
<p> the republic and for this preamble. And at the moment the existing</p>
<p> preamble...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Which I have here and, I mean, I can't even begin to read it</p>
<p> because it's very difficult to read out because it's very</p>
<p> legal.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's actually a preamble in the British Act which legally</p>
<p> enacts the Australian Constitution. It's not really a preamble</p>
<p> to our Constitution. It's a preamble in the British Act. And</p>
<p> I think it says, whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria humbly</p>
<p> relying on the blessing of Almighty God have agreed to be uniting</p>
<p> one indissoluble, Federal Commonwealth under the Crown. Now, that</p>
<p> was fine language for that day and that remains in the British Act</p>
<p> but this will go into our Constitution, be part of our Constitution,</p>
<p> whether or not we become a republic...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If we all vote for it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If a majority of Australians in a majority of States vote for it,</p>
<p> of course. And I have, we've deliberately made it republic neutral</p>
<p> so that somebody who doesn't want a republic but would like a</p>
<p> preamble...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And there will be people who would want that option.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there would be a lot people in that situation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just finally, Kim Beazley has also been critical of your work saying</p>
<p> that it is too wordy and that you've tried to cover too many</p>
<p> bases. Have you read his version or their version originally drafted</p>
<p> by Gareth Evans I think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I have read it and, look, I'm not going to sort of bucket</p>
<p> it as he's bucketed mine because I accept that people of goodwill</p>
<p> in a situation like this will express these things differently.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He read it for us, do you want to listen, it's only our lasts</p>
<p> 30 seconds.</p>
<p>[TAPE PLAYED]</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the concepts in it are indistinguishable from the concepts in</p>
<p> mine. I mean, there is nothing in that, in a sense, that's not</p>
<p> in our preamble.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He dwells on the word Âcustodian' in the last...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah well, that's right, but that's because that's</p>
<p> sort of become a bit of a buzzword of some people who are arguing</p>
<p> this issue. I know, well, he mentions that he uses the word custodianship.</p>
<p> We have used the expression, you know, we've talked about inhabitation,</p>
<p> inhabited the land. There are a few things in our document which are</p>
<p> values which are not in his. We talk about concepts such as fairness</p>
<p> and mateship and excellence and achievement and I think it's</p>
<p> important to go beyond the Â and I'm not being critical</p>
<p> of his preamble because I don't think this is something where</p>
<p> somebody's totally right and another person's totally wrong</p>
<p> Â but he has got in his preamble all the things that you would</p>
<p> expect. I mean, his is a very predictable preamble because it's</p>
<p> got all the things and it says we the people and so forth. I have</p>
<p> tried in this to introduce some notions of contemporary Australian</p>
<p> values. I mean, we all would expect a reference to democracy and equality</p>
<p> and those sorts of things, and that's in our preamble, but we've</p>
<p> gone a bit further and we've put in excellence and achievement</p>
<p> and mateship and fairness. And we've also got a sense of something</p>
<p> that's very important to the Australian experience and that sense</p>
<p> of space and the size of Australia and the vastness of the continent</p>
<p> which has had an enormous impact on the psyche of the Australian people.</p>
<p> It's conditions, our attitude, our sense of space and distance</p>
<p> and I don't think you have a thoroughly contemporary Australian</p>
<p> Constitution that doesn't have that concept in it. But I'd</p>
<p> understand, as I said a moment ago, Steve, the people with goodwill</p>
<p> are going to want to express these things differently and in the end</p>
<p> somebody, and that's understandably the Government and the Prime</p>
<p> Minister of the day, has got to say, well look, this is what we think</p>
<p> is appropriate. I'll be interested to hear people's views.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I think it's a fascinating debate and the community will want</p>
<p> to talk about and I congratulate you again on doing it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you like a copy of our read version?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would love it. I would love it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We'll courier that up to you overnight. Thanks for giving us</p>
<p> your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
