Part of the obligation that we owe to the men and women who defended this country is a special debt to those nurses of Australia who have made a magnificent contribution in all of the conflicts in which the nation has been involved.</p>
<p>It is a debt incurred by a tradition of caring, compassion and healing. This tradition is again being practised by service nurses – this time as part of Australia’s contribution to the multinational force in East Timor.</p>
<p>As I speak, 14 Service nurses from our defence forces are on the ground in Dili to provide vital medical support to the multi-national force and, if necessary, emergency medical care to civilian East Timorese in life threatening situations.</p>
<p>They come from No.1 Field Hospital at Holsworthy, No.3 RAAF Hospital at Richmond, No.6 RAAF Hospital at Laverton, and No. 3 Brigade  Administrative Support Battalion Medical Company and Lavarack Barracks Medical Centre, both in Townsville.</p>
<p>Some of these nurses will also assist in the rapid evacuation by air of serious medical cases. God willing, we hope that this is not needed.</p>
<p>The Nursing Tradition</p>
<p>The professionalism of these young Australians reflects a continuation of a long and proud history of Australia’s Service nurses which had its beginnings so many years ago.</p>
<p>In 100 years of Australian defence service nursing more than 10,000 nurses have given service to their country in times of war and conflict and over 100 have given their lives, including 29 nurses in World War I and 71 nurses in World War II.</p>
<p>Wherever Australian troops have served nurses have been there to provide care and support so vital to the defence effort and to the wellbeing of our troops.</p>
<p>From the veldt in South Africa to the sands of the Western Desert and the mud of the Western Front; from the imposing terrain of Greece and the Middle East, through India, to the jungles of Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea, nurses have always contributed to the defence of Australia’s national interest.</p>
<p>Our nurses have endured the same perils as the troops they served alongside – risks of injury and capture,risks of internment as prisoners of war, even the risk of death. And they have demonstrated the same proficiency and dedication, the same sacrifice and courage as the troops.</p>
<p>Their heroism has often gone unrecognised. Yet the conditions in which they worked were often appalling and involved considerable dangers. In many theatres of war disease was rife and the threat of invasion was always present.</p>
<p>They worked tirelessly to heal wounded soldiers and gave comfort to the many who did not survive. Sometimes even to enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>Their service and sacrifice has never been forgotten by the soldiers, sailors and airmen who owe their lives to Australian nurses.</p>
<p>Let us vow to never forget the remarkable feats of courage and compassion of the likes of Sister Savage, Sister Bullwinkel and Matron Best.</p>
<p>Sister Nell Savage</p>
<p>We should remember how the hospital ship, Centaur, sunk in May 1943, 22 kilometres of the Queensland coast. All but one of the service nurses on board were to lose their lives. </p>
<p>It was Sister Nell Savage, the only survivor who was to receive a George Medal for her heroism for helping others in spite of her own personal injury.</p>
<p>Sister Vivian Bullwinkel</p>
<p>And let us not forget the 65 Army Nurses on board the Vyner Brooke in 1942, the twelve nurses who were drowned or killed in the water as the ship was attacked by the Japanese and the further 21 who were massacred after they struggled ashore at Banka Island, only to be made to march back into the sea to be machine gunned from behind.</p>
<p>In the words of Sister Bullwinkel, the only survivor, "they all knew what was going to happen to them, but no one panicked, they just marched ahead with their chins up."</p>
<p>Matron Best</p>
<p>Then there is the incident in Greece in early 1941.</p>
<p>In the face of a German onslaught, the Matron of one of the Australian General Hospitals, Matron Best, was informed by her Commanding Officer that they were to be evacuated with ten minutes notice and was asked to select 44 nurses and physiotherapists to be evacuated.</p>
<p>Matron Best spoke to her nursing sisters, making it clear that the German forces would probably capture those who chose to stay.</p>
<p>She asked them to write two things on a slip of paper, their names and one other word – either ‘stay’ or ‘go’.</p>
<p>When she collected the slips, not one was marked with the word ‘go’.</p>
<p>She selected 39 sisters to remain with her, and the others were evacuated.</p>
<p>From these chapters in our history we have gained a tremendous legacy that illuminates, in a very special way, our ANZAC tradition.</p>
<p>The Memorial</p>
<p>Memorials such as this are important expressions of the value we place in the deeds of individuals. Here on ANZAC Parade, this memorial stands next to a select group of others that mark the particular contribution of men and women in forging and defending a free and independent Australia.</p>
<p>Our nurses have waited long for this tribute. Perhaps too long for a grateful nation, but not so long that their service has been forgotten.</p>
<p>This memorial is a worthy tribute to a 100 year tradition of service and sacrifice located here amongst memorials to the service men and women of this country, they dedicated themselves to serve.</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate Ms Elizabeth Percival, Executive Director of the Royal College of Nursing, Australia, who graciously agreed to chair the Memorial Management Committee, Ms Ita Buttrose AO OBE, who chaired the Memorial Fundraising Committee, and all those involved for their efforts which have culminated in the dedication of this memorial. </p>
<p>This memorial will serve as a prominent and appropriate focus for commemorating this special group of Australians who served, suffered and died in the service of a grateful nation.</p>
<p>To those nurses of Australia who are here today I say that your nation will forever be indebted to you. You have earned our admiration and respect for the contribution you made and the relief of suffering that you provided.</p>
<p>You are a living reminder that tyranny will never overcome the courage, tenacity and mateship of typical Australians.</p>
