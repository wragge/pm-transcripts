<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Prime Minister, jobs today. .75000 new jobs have been created. That’s the best monthly figure for two years. Your reaction?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>It’s good news. It’s good news for Australia. You don’t want to get over-excited on the basis of one month’s figures but it’s certainly gone in the right direction with a thump on this occasion and I hope it’s continued and I think all Australians of good will, whatever their political persuasion, will hope it’s repeated in that direction next month.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Are there any implications for monetary policy from the figures?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>No, I don’t think so. That’s a matter for the Reserve Bank, isn’t it.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Are you going to make your deadline that you set down, by the financial year?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well that’s certainly a lot more likely as a result of this figure. If it continues in that direction then it’s a lot more likely.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Ekkart Arbeit. Is it a witch hunt that’s going on at the moment?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>No I don’t think it’s a witch hunt. I believe Athletics Australia has done the right thing to ask for an inquiry to look again. Most Australians would want that to happen. I am not going to say any more in fairness to their independent role in this matter.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>In the last unemployment numbers you talked about the battlers who were having trouble getting jobs. What would you say to them today?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Things are looking better. I mean, can I say to those people out of work, the sun is shining more brightly today than it was a month ago. Now, one doesn’t want to get over-excited. It’s only one month but gee, it’s a terrific figure and it’s the best for a couple of years, and it’s good news for Australia and it’s a tonic for the employment outlook.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
