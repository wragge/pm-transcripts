<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Prime Minister, jobs today. .75000 new jobs have been created. Thatâs the best monthly figure for two years. Your reaction?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Itâs good news. Itâs good news for Australia. You donât want to get over-excited on the basis of one monthâs figures but itâs certainly gone in the right direction with a thump on this occasion and I hope itâs continued and I think all Australians of good will, whatever their political persuasion, will hope itâs repeated in that direction next month.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Are there any implications for monetary policy from the figures?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>No, I donât think so. Thatâs a matter for the Reserve Bank, isnât it.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Are you going to make your deadline that you set down, by the financial year?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well thatâs certainly a lot more likely as a result of this figure. If it continues in that direction then itâs a lot more likely.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>Ekkart Arbeit. Is it a witch hunt thatâs going on at the moment?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>No I donât think itâs a witch hunt. I believe Athletics Australia has done the right thing to ask for an inquiry to look again. Most Australians would want that to happen. I am not going to say any more in fairness to their independent role in this matter.</p>
<p><b>JRNLST:</b></p>
<p>In the last unemployment numbers you talked about the battlers who were having trouble getting jobs. What would you say to them today?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Things are looking better. I mean, can I say to those people out of work, the sun is shining more brightly today than it was a month ago. Now, one doesnât want to get over-excited. Itâs only one month but gee, itâs a terrific figure and itâs the best for a couple of years, and itâs good news for Australia and itâs a tonic for the employment outlook.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
