4, AUSTRAL1A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT ST GREGORY'S SCHOOL,<br />
CANPBELLTOWN, 23 MARCH 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: You are aware that there is a high-powered meeting<br />
underway today in relation to the housing industry?<br />
PM4: I believe that there is a meeting in Canberra, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you feel about their approach?<br />
PM: We don't know about their approach yet because they haven't<br />
told us. We can't prejudge their meeting. All I can say is that<br />
in Cabinet tomorrow we will be considering the housing industry<br />
and we will consider whatever the industry has got to say to us.<br />
We are conscious of the need to ensure that the housing industry<br />
is maintained in a viable condition. And we know that the high<br />
interest rate policy that we had to have last year and early this<br />
year to protect our external accounts would have, in the<br />
beginning, some adverse impact upon housing, but we are not going<br />
to let it run away.<br />
JOURNALIST: They have indicated that deregulation is something<br />
they will be pushing very strongly for. How do you feel about<br />
that? PM: We have made it quite clear what we think about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are not interested in listening to them again?<br />
PM: We will read and listen to whatever people have to say to<br />
us. We have made clear in three years in government that we are<br />
very much concerned in listening to what representat'ives of the<br />
community have to say. But there are other views than those of<br />
the housing industry on this issue as you know.<br />
