    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the last election I committed to spending one week every year in a remote Indigenous community to gain a better understanding of the needs of people living and working in those areas.</p>
<p>In September this year, along with parliamentary colleagues and representatives from government departments, I will spend a week in North East Arnhem Land.</p>
<p>This trip will mark the first anniversary of my swearing in as Prime Minister. It will be a significant personal milestone and it will be a great honour to spend it among Aboriginal Australians.</p>
<p>For an entire week, Aboriginal people will have my full focus and attention as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Last year I spoke to Gumatj leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu about spending a week living in his country and I am grateful for his offer to accommodate me.</p>
<p>With the help of the Yothu Yindi Foundation I will be alongside Yolngu men and women and will take part in practical activities that are of immediate benefit to the community while listening to community members about Government policy and practical solutions.</p>
<p>The Government is determined that children will go to school, adults will go to work and communities will be safe.</p>
<p>For the past decade I have spent time in remote Indigenous communities and I am committed to continuing this tradition as Prime Minister.</p>
