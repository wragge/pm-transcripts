BUDGET, 1961<br />
Speech in the House of Representatives by the Prime<br />
Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies. 24th August, 1961<br />
Sir I must be careful not to laugh. This debate has<br />
been quite interesting. It has been very reminiscent of budget<br />
debates that I have listened to for a long, long time. I have<br />
heard some of it directly, and some of through the medium of the<br />
wireless. I have learnt more things about myself than I ever<br />
knew before. Not for the first time, but for about the twelfth<br />
time, I have listened to honorable gentlemen on the Opposition<br />
side explaining with some vehemence how my Goverrunont is busy<br />
ruining the country, creating disaster, and bringing despair into<br />
the hearts of people. This may be, of course, merely<br />
repetition for the sake of emphasis, but I know, and all those<br />
who have been here for a similar time know, that this is the<br />
customary diet. The odd thing is that, in spite of this ruinous<br />
process of administration that we have adopted, not only in 1949<br />
when, I gather from one honorable member who spoke earlier, we<br />
won the election by fraudulent practices, but in 1951, 1955 and<br />
195Z at five consecutive gene ral elections the people of<br />
Australia, who are not fools, have been told of this kind of<br />
thing.<br />
Mr. Costa You said this afternoon that people are gullible.<br />
MR. MENZIES Gullible are they? Is that the Labour Party's viev?<br />
All I can say is that in this series of five elections they. have<br />
voted for us although there has never been an election campaign<br />
yet which was not preceded by prophesies from honorable<br />
gentlemen opposite of mass unemployment and grave disaster. At<br />
the end of nine years of our incompetent administration, the<br />
people of Australia gave us the biggest majority that a<br />
government has over had. Gullible are they?<br />
So I speak tonight on behalf of the people of<br />
Australia who have voted for us, who have maintained us, who<br />
have supported us, and who are now under attack for their own<br />
folly, so the Opposition says. That is the issue. Are the people<br />
stupid? Do they not understand these things? Or has the<br />
Opposition suddenly, in the still watches of the night,<br />
discovered the answers for the first time? It has never had them<br />
before. I do not propose to waste my tine on this or that. I<br />
want to say something about the spcech of the prospective Prime<br />
Minister the Leader of the Opposition. It is quite proper to<br />
refer to him in that way, as you will at once be disposed to<br />
agree. One must fight in one's own division. Therefore, I deal<br />
with the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, who was<br />
described this afternoon in a somewhat intemperate speech as<br />
am I permitted to use his name? the great Arthur Augustus<br />
Calwell. I know him very well and we are, I am happy to say on<br />
the best of terms. I have no objection to being Prime Minister<br />
and he thoroughly enjoys being Leader of the Opposition. The<br />
other night ho favoured us with a speech on the Budget and I will<br />
with proper respect, confine my remarks within a limited period<br />
of tirie to what ho had to say.<br />
Mr. Peters Get on with it.<br />
MR. I, 4ENZIES Yes, I will got on with it. So far I have been<br />
doing rather well, don't you think? The theme song of the<br />
Leader of the Opposition I quote his words was: All the<br />
troubles in the economy have been Govornment-caused. I would like<br />
to say to my distinguished friend, if he wore in the chamber,<br />
that, as a matter of advocacy, it is a very great mistake to </p>
<p>overstate your case. He said: All the troubles in the economy<br />
have been Govrnment-caused. That remarkable proposition<br />
ignores the rest of the world and the great tides of events that<br />
sweep around the world. Having established that proposition to<br />
his own satisfaction, he says what? He cannot say, and he did<br />
not say, that we created the boon of 1959-60, because he denies<br />
that such a boom over existed. I want all honorable members and<br />
all the people of Australia who may learn of the honorable<br />
gentleman's statement, to got that firmly fixed in their minds.<br />
He denies that there was a boom in 1959-60. I think I have a<br />
note here of what he said. I must quote his precise words. He<br />
referred to<br />
The myth<br />
I am not lisping<br />
of the 1960 boom which the Government has been trying to<br />
create in recent months.<br />
That is how the Leader of the Opposition disposed of the boom.<br />
He said that there , as no boom. It never existed; it was an<br />
invention, an act of imagination on our part.<br />
Mr. Haylen Hallolujah, I'm a boom!<br />
MR. MENZIES I know that the honorable member who interjocts<br />
agrees that there was a boom, but his Leader, or whatever he is,<br />
says that there was no boom. If the Leader of the Opposition<br />
means anything, he means that everything was going nicely, I am<br />
delighted to see that the honorable gentlemn is here now. For<br />
his benefit, I must repeat what I said. I was saying that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition denied that there was a boom. He<br />
described it as a myth created by the Government in recent months<br />
Mr. Fox He will " myth" out, too.<br />
MR. MENZIES I am sorry that honorable members should see fit to<br />
laugh, because laughter is prohibited by the Sydney " Mirror". I<br />
never read it without laughing. But what does the honorable<br />
gentleman mean, if he moans anything, by his statement that there<br />
was never a boom? Uhat he must moan is that, there being no boom<br />
and everything, presumably, going nicely, wo, within a year of an<br />
election, being minded to cormit suicide politically, took<br />
unnecessary measures and caused a depression and dangerous<br />
unemployment all of which my honorable friend will cure by the<br />
time-tLaoured Evatt-Calwell recipe of increased inflation. If he<br />
does not mean that, I ask everybody: What does he Tean? If<br />
there was not a boom if everything was completely normal-why<br />
in the name of fortune did the Government that I have the honour<br />
of leading suddenly make up its mind to take unnecessary measures<br />
to cause a depression and to go out to create unemployment? I<br />
put this to the common sense, if not of honorable gentlemen<br />
opposite, at least of the groat Australian people: Why should<br />
they suppose that we would commit such folly, unless they imagine<br />
that in a single stroke we had all gone mad?<br />
Now the Leader of the Opposition, having committed<br />
himself to these propositions, says, ' When I come in" he moans<br />
after the next elections " I am going to have a February Budget"<br />
I suppose January will be devoted to reconstruction and all<br />
that " for a œ 100,000,000 deficit". That sounds magnificent,<br />
does it not? It is the master-stroke of statesmanship. I think<br />
the honorable gentleman does well to be optimistic. Every<br />
leader should be optimistic. He says, " He have an election. I<br />
come in. HJe form a Cabinet. We get to work and in February I<br />
bring in a new Budget for a œ 100,000,000 deficit." A Budget in<br />
February, let me remind honorable members, would relate to the<br />
rust of the financial year. Itwould not become effective until </p>
<p>March. There would be March, April, May and June. So in four<br />
months of the current financial year the honorable gentleman<br />
would run into a deficit of œ 100,000,000. Subtracting the<br />
deficit of œ 16,000,000 for which we budget, he would have an<br />
œ 84,000,000 deficit for four months of the financial year. I am<br />
sure that, as an honest man, he means that; but I am equally<br />
sure that, as an intelligent man, he does not think it will<br />
happen. But if his statement means anything, it means that he<br />
would, in his Budget in February, introduce taxation reductions<br />
and increase Government expenditure at the rate of 000 000<br />
for four months and, therefore, at the rate of œ 250,006 006 a<br />
year. This is the thoughtful contribution made by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition. The arithmetic is simple. The deficit would<br />
run at the rate of œ 250,000,000 for a full year.<br />
Let me go on from that point, because I am perfectly<br />
certain that my honorable friend does not design himself to be<br />
the Prime Minister just for the balance of the financial year.<br />
This is always a salutary reminder. There will be another year,<br />
the financial year 1962-63. WIhat would he do in his Budget for<br />
1962-63? The honorable member for Shortland ( Mr. Griffiths) is<br />
interjecting. I am not asking him, because he will have nothing<br />
to do with it. What would the Leader of the Opposition do with<br />
the Budget for 1962-63? Would he go flat out for another deficit<br />
of œ 250,000,000? Is that what we are being promised by this<br />
party that wants development and hates unemployment? Is that<br />
what the game is? Because if it is not, then presumably, having<br />
got through an election on this rather lush promise he will, in<br />
1962-63, bring in a Budget in which he rjstores taxes, or cuts<br />
expenditure in order to achieve a balance, or continues the<br />
inflationary process and budgets for a deficit of over<br />
œ 200,000,000. Now, Sir, I do not ask the honorable gentleman to<br />
come clean onthis matter in this debate, because he has already<br />
spoken; but I do hope that he will cone clean on it with the<br />
people of Australia before piling day.<br />
We want him to come clean on this: Are we being<br />
promised a vast inflationary system of finance because I will<br />
say something about the consequences of that a little later or<br />
is he just saying something at this stage in order to get over<br />
the problem of the moment, and will then come along six months<br />
after polling day saying, " I an sorry. Those taxes I reduced I<br />
must now increase. That expenditure I let out I must now pull<br />
back"? Because, Sir, he has made glowing promises of easier<br />
borrowing. I wonder if he would mind my repeating it? Easier<br />
borrowing! Easier borrowing for the Government? For the people?<br />
How do you make borrowing easier if you are running into an<br />
inflationary boon? How do you make borrowing cheaper if the<br />
value of money is running away through inflation, as it<br />
undoubtedly would on the programme he has put before us a<br />
programme which, I may say, was so admirably exposed by the<br />
honorable member for Wide Bay ( Mr. Bardidt) this afternoon.<br />
Mr. Curtin Awl<br />
MR. MiHZIES Yes, aidirably exposed. It is a pity you were not<br />
here listening at the time.<br />
Mro Reynolds You are easily pleased.<br />
MR. MENZIES The hon: rable member says that I am easily pleased.<br />
If he would make only one bright remark I would be delighted.<br />
Easier borrowing. If I may use the famed Macaulayan phrase,<br />
every schoolboy knows that in a period of inflation borrowing is<br />
harder because interest rates must rise. But he is going to have<br />
easier borrowing. He is going to do something about the pay-roll<br />
tax. I must say to him, as an old friend, that I rather admired<br />
the way in which he phrased it. He did not really say, " We will<br />
abolish the pay-roll tax." That would have been well received </p>
<p>by some of those business interests that we are supposed to<br />
serve, would it not? Ho did not actually say, " We will abolish<br />
it." He said, " We will look into this to see whether we can<br />
replace it in some other way." That is as broad as it is long,<br />
and I do not attach much significance to it. He is going to do<br />
something about the petrol tax. He is going to have vastly<br />
increased expenditure in " Jestern Australia and Queensland, in<br />
which States the expenditure by this Goveornnent leaves for dead<br />
whatever was done by the Labour Party in its own time. He drags<br />
out the good old thing about an ovrseas shipping line the<br />
deficit on which no doubt he will carry on Treasury account. He<br />
is going to have some sort of government ihsurance company that<br />
is going to be unlike any other insurance company and be able to<br />
carry on profitably at a loss.<br />
This is the kind of thing he says, and because he has<br />
put it in that way, because he or whoever has advised him has<br />
looked up all the points of criticism, particularly in one or two<br />
places that we know of, and they have added them together, he<br />
produces this astonishing prograrmme so astonishing that I hope<br />
Australia will never have to suffer from it.<br />
Mr. Reynolds It has suffered from the Menzies Governmeiont a lot<br />
MR. MBJZIES Australia has suffered from the Menzies Government<br />
for twelve years, and if you can find anywhere in the world a<br />
happier and more prosperous country than Australia, I should like<br />
you to drop no a postcard.<br />
Now I pass on from that in order, if I May with<br />
profound respect, to point out a few uaps in the reasoning of the<br />
honorable gentleman who made this policy speech. I admit it is<br />
a little subject to correction, because the federal executive of<br />
his party had not finished meeting at the time the policy speech<br />
was made, and we all know that the policy of the Labour Party is<br />
fixed by twelve people, or whatever it may be, outside. But I<br />
say nothing more about that, because I an sure he has had a<br />
difficult time. However, first of all, let me take the gaps in<br />
his reasoning. He denies the boom. I just repeat that, because<br />
he went to some pains to say that there was not a boom. I wonder<br />
Sir, if the honorable gentleman believes that, and whether he is<br />
unaware of the tremendous rise in 1959-60 of what has been<br />
called " fringe banking" but which I much prefer myself to call<br />
money dealing by people dealing in money, many of them making<br />
Qnor. lous profits in consequence.<br />
Mr. L. R. Johnqson You could have stopped that.<br />
MR. NENZIES You say so, but I had other legal advice. Then<br />
there is hire-purchase finance. Is he unaware of the tremendous<br />
development in this field, of the development of fancy rates of<br />
interest, or does he deny that those things existed? To me,<br />
there were many indications of a boom, and to my delighted<br />
colleagues they conveyed the some idea.<br />
Does the Leader of the Opposition deny that we have<br />
had a tremendous speculative boom in land sales?<br />
Mr. Peters Promoted by the Governmento<br />
MR. MENZIES Wait a moment! You do not get away from it by<br />
saying " promoted by the Government". I am asking a simple<br />
question: Was there a boom in land selling? Was there a<br />
speculative land boom?<br />
Mro Haylon Ring up Artie. He will toll you.<br />
MR. 1ENZIES All right. Run away as fast as you like. Having<br />
a sense of relativity I am saying this to the Leader of the </p>
<p>Opposition, who says that there was no such thing as a boon. You<br />
do not explain this by saying that somebody was to blame for it,<br />
because immediately you say that you adnit it existed. But the<br />
Leader of the Opposition denies it existed. Does he? I wonder<br />
what people would say who found themselves having to pay a most<br />
fantastic sun of money for a bit of land on which to put up a<br />
hone. But the Leader of the Labour Party denies that there was<br />
any such thing. Does he deny that there was a speculative boon<br />
on the stock exchange? Not a bitU He says there was no boom. I<br />
do not like speculative boons on the stock exchange becauso,<br />
quite frankly, stock exchange speculation very seldon, if ever,<br />
puts new noney into industry. Does he deny that there was<br />
enornous increase in purchasing power and that in consequence<br />
there was an inr: ense denrand for inports? Does he deny that? I<br />
put this, because he never thought fit to refer directly or<br />
indirectly, to the fact that there was a grave threat to our<br />
overseas reserves, which were falling rapidly aid, but for strong<br />
action, would have fallen to the point of danger. The<br />
prospective Prine Minister of Australia is unaware of the fact.<br />
It is so trifling in his mind that never, from first to last in<br />
a carefully prepared speech, did he mention it. This is the<br />
leader of the alternative government. Does he deny that there<br />
was an acute competition for labour and materials? I wonder<br />
whether it crossed his eye, looking ovvor the records in the<br />
course of his studies, that because of this boon and this<br />
tremendous donand for basic materials, Australia, with all its<br />
remarkable increase in local production, had become a net importer<br />
of steel. There was no mention of it.<br />
These are all the m. rks of -a bo.) n, and a government<br />
that is confronted by a boor and is afraid to do something about<br />
it is not fit to be a governreont. A Government that inherits a<br />
quelled boom, or an abolished boon, and sets out to create a new<br />
one by its policy is not fit to be the Government of Australia<br />
either. Being confronted by all these obvious questions the<br />
honorable gentleman took refuge in saying that the boon was an<br />
imaginary thing created by our imagination and having no existence<br />
in fact. So, Sir, as I repeat, he paid no attention to the<br />
problem of the balance of payments. May I remind him and remind<br />
Australia, if it needs to be done, that this wonderful country of<br />
ours lives on international trade more than does any other<br />
country of its population. We are one of the great trading<br />
nations of the world. I am not boasting about this. It is a<br />
fact that if you put down the first ten trading nations in the<br />
world in absolute terms, not in comparative terms, we are one of<br />
then. Of course we live on it, because our exports enable us to<br />
pay for the things that we bring in from overseas, the bulk of<br />
which are in aid of production in Australia itself. We are a<br />
groat trading nation and therefore we have a vital interest in<br />
what our balance of payments may be.<br />
Do honorable members realize that all the economic<br />
troubles that have arisen in Great Britain of late are troubles<br />
of balance of payments America had a few of the same kind not<br />
so long ago all problems of how you can keep your exports up to<br />
the world so that you may buy what you want from the world and<br />
not go bankrupt in the process? This is the simplest possible<br />
way of stating the problem of the balance of payments. But the<br />
honorable gentleman opposite says nothing about it. It does not<br />
count in his world. Whoever advised him did not think of it.<br />
Governments have had to think about it very greatly in ny time.<br />
I wonder lam now speculating on what would have gone on in my<br />
friend's mind if he had thought about this matter lad r. it this<br />
is a dangerous and almost an impertinent exercise on my part<br />
whether he would have said that there would not have been a<br />
problem of that kind if import licensing had not been abandoned.<br />
It is a very udd thing that in his speech, so much adn irod in the<br />
Sydney afternoon press </p>
<p>Mr. Haylen The dailies were not bad cither.<br />
MR. MENZIES I was referring only to the juvenile section; you<br />
know what I nean.<br />
Mr. Haylen I understand. You would read the conics first,<br />
MR. MENZIES I always do except that I road the loading<br />
articles; they are the sane thing. Of course, my friend reads<br />
the comics, provided they are guaranteed written or drawn by an<br />
Australian. Anyhow, we will not quarrel about that. The Leader<br />
of the Opposition said not a word about import licensing. I<br />
thought he was going to say, " Of course, there was a boon and you<br />
caused it. You did not invent it; you caused it. And you would<br />
not have caused it if you had not got rid of import licensing."<br />
Now, Sir, this leaves us free to speculateo Does not<br />
the Loader of the Opposition know that in a period of domestic<br />
inflation with full and, fron tine to tine, over-full<br />
employment a reduction in the supply of goods will increase the<br />
inflationary pressure unless corresponding with the reduction in<br />
the supply of goods by impor. t licensing, you stiffen up the credit<br />
restrictions at hone? You cannot have it both ways. There are<br />
two weapons you can use on this matter. One is to let nore goods<br />
in, and the other is to restrict credit at hone by various<br />
processes. But if you let all the goods in, then quite palpably<br />
you will have to restrict credit twice as much; otherwise the<br />
inflationary boon will So right out through the roof. This is<br />
elementary. You do not need to be a professional economist to<br />
know that. But the honorable gentleman has thought fit to ignore<br />
it. I wonder, Sir, whether my friend, who is a good Australian<br />
and believes in Australian industry, regards import licensing,<br />
with its inevitably arbitrary and bureaucratic character, as a<br />
sound permanent means of encouraging Australian industry because<br />
quite frankly I do not. I am a great believer in Australian<br />
industry. I am a life-long protectionist. I will not accept the<br />
proposition that the right way to protect Australian industry is<br />
to put it at the mercy of the government of the day and of the<br />
officialdom of the day under a licensing system. Import licensing<br />
lasted long enough, and I hope that it will never cone back.<br />
There is one other question that I ought to put. I<br />
wonder whether my honorable friend, when he wins the next<br />
election and puts this new Budget of his into operation, is going<br />
to restore import licensing. He did not toll us. I am sure that<br />
as a member of the govornm cnt which made Australia a party to the<br />
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as Gatt, he will<br />
realize that with the present state of our overseas reserves<br />
because our measures have restored then to a position of<br />
abounding health in the last few months he could not<br />
re-introduce import licensing because, as he well knows and as<br />
his Government explained to us at the time, you cannot impose<br />
quantitative restrictions except to protect your balance of<br />
payments, and the balance today thanks to these measures that<br />
we have taken is so healthy that nobody would have believed it<br />
possible five months ago. That of course, explains why the<br />
Leader of the Opposition has not promised that he will restore<br />
import licensing. He has not even referred to import licensing<br />
and in fact, of course, he would not dream of making a promise<br />
because he knows that until his policy has been operating for six<br />
months there will be no justification at all for import licensing,<br />
Then, Sir I am bound to say that I heard this with<br />
great reluctance and with some sorrow I am accustomed to some<br />
of the extravagances elsewhere, but the honorable gentleman<br />
seemed to me to set out to destroy confidence, to preach gloom,<br />
to prophesy mass unemployment and to prophesy a depression deeper<br />
than anything we have ever known. Of course and listening in </p>
<p>this afternoon, I have learnt that there are quite a few<br />
expressions that are now parliamentary it is utter drivel to<br />
talk about a mass depression of that kind. There is not the<br />
faintest reason for any such prophecy.<br />
The fact is that every one in this chamber I say<br />
this emphatically on behalf of all of us hates to have out of<br />
work people who like to be in wo?: k and who are competent to be in<br />
work. Of course we do. No gover. nument in our history has done<br />
nore over a period of twelve years to maintain the highest<br />
possible level of employment than has this Government. We do not<br />
need to be told by bellowing fellows you know, Sir, whom I<br />
mean about unemployment and its hardships. Unemployment<br />
presents the nost tremendous human hardship that one can possibly<br />
imagine. But when people make speeches which, unless those<br />
people are utterly stupid, are intended to increase unemployment<br />
and human hardship, I express my utter contempt for them,<br />
One of the greatest tasks we have is to get rid of the<br />
relatively small amount, bur too big for our comfort of<br />
unemployment that exists au present. The right way to do this is<br />
not to destroy confidence in the cormunity but to encourage it.<br />
Let me put it into simple tcrms. Today, the numbers of registered<br />
unemployed are a little more than twice what they were in the<br />
period of the boom. Do not let us forget that we have always had<br />
a number of people registered as unemployed, even in a boom when<br />
we have had full employment. Let us agree that the nunmer today<br />
is twice as great as it was that is 50,000, 60,000 or whatever<br />
you nay care to call it. These people are tremendously important.<br />
How do we get them back to work? I put it in the simplest terms:<br />
We get them back by improving business turnover in this country<br />
by 2 per cent that is all.<br />
Mr. Griffiths What sort of business?<br />
MR. MENZIES The business of buying at the ultimate end, if you<br />
want it explained to you. If people are threatened with<br />
unemployment and are constantly told by their supposed leaders,<br />
" You never know, you may be out of a job tomorrow; this is going<br />
on and it will get worse and worse until it reaches the Lang<br />
percent.", then, of course, they will button up. But if they go<br />
about their affairs in the normal way, believing, as I think they<br />
should, that this country is in a resurgent movement which will<br />
make everybody before long forget these troubles, business<br />
activities will return to normal. I put it in this way: 2 per<br />
cent. more buying at the ultimate end<br />
Mr. James With what?<br />
, iR. MENZIES There is a good deal of purchasing power in the<br />
cormunity. The honorable gentleman forgets that there has been a<br />
substantial increase in the basic wage, a substantial increase in<br />
social service payments in this Budget and a very large amount of<br />
tax refunds this year, running, I think, to about œ 90,000,000. An<br />
increase of 2 per cent. and the trade position will begin to<br />
clear, the stocks will begin to move out and the manufacturers'<br />
wheels will begin to turn. Sir, I am trying to put this in<br />
proper proportion. It is all right to stand up and moan about<br />
people. I know it is the fashion for a few honorable members<br />
opposite to think of me as a thoroughly inhuman fellow. I am not.<br />
Mr. Jones Aren't you?<br />
MR. 4ME4ZIES You are the last nan who ought to say so. I an not.<br />
I an a responsible political leader and as such it is my duty to<br />
point out to this country that whatever reduces the confidence of<br />
the people will destroy their employment and whatever makes then<br />
see the position clearly with all the elements that make for<br />
employment will restore the jobs of those who today are without<br />
them. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Opposition Members Oh!<br />
MR. MENZIES I have heard that " Oh" many times. I have been<br />
here a long time. I know Opposition members say I have been here<br />
too long.<br />
Mr. Curtin Too long!<br />
MR. MENZIES Yes, too long for I th-t b. c. orable<br />
members opposite live year by yearelecti. ro by eluction. on<br />
prophesies of gloom. They say . o will DO more and more<br />
unemployment. That is the most sh. ockingly barren policy I have<br />
ever heard. It is quite discreditable. When they find 97 people<br />
out of 100 employed in a factory or whatever it may be, they say<br />
to the 97 as vdciferously as they can, " Be careful, you may be<br />
the next to go". I know it is not very well regarded by people<br />
of a delicate nature to say this kind of thing, but I perfectly<br />
well believe that there ure honorable members opposite who would<br />
regard another 100,000 the list of unemployed between now and<br />
December as the greatest r-' O. itical triumph in their lives.<br />
Mr. Reynolds Who is being inhuman now?<br />
MR. I-ENZIES I am being human, but I am taking leave to question<br />
your humanity. You might think about that occasionally.<br />
To me, the existence of unemployment is a terrible<br />
thing. It imposes human hardship. It is quite true that every<br />
government, whatever its political colour may be must deal with<br />
these groat problems in the broad an. occasionally m'ay have to<br />
accept some of these consequences. But it is a monstrosity to<br />
think that the Govcrnment does not know that there is tremendous<br />
tragedy in homes in which the breadwinner is willing to work but<br />
cannot work. The whole of our policy is designed to remove this<br />
tragedy. The whole of our policy has been to get rid of<br />
inflation, which is a threat both to development and to investmont,<br />
to produce a sensible stability in the community, to prevent<br />
the value of wages, s'Alaries and pensions from being run out by<br />
an inflationary movement, and thereby before long in total to<br />
restore a complete prosperity not a boom prosperity but a sound<br />
prosperity to the country.<br />
Our position today is that our overseas balances are<br />
good; that the seasonal prospects appear to be good, except, I<br />
regret to say, in parts of Queensland; that we have good<br />
prospects for wool production; and that we will have, I hope,<br />
good wool prices. Sales tax has been reduced on many cormmodities<br />
that afect the householder and we have the virtual ending of the<br />
credit squeeze, because all banking: restrictions today, under<br />
Reserve Bank directions, are concentrated in substance of<br />
speculative operations, as the Treasurer ( Mr. Harold Holt) pcirted<br />
out in his Budget speech. We have good bank liquidity and a<br />
vastly accelerated works and housing programme which has not<br />
received the study in this place that it deserves, though the<br />
Treasurer might, if he had had time, have said a good deal about<br />
it. We have increased purchasing power along the lines that I<br />
have mentioned. The last thing I wish to say is this: The Leader of the<br />
Opposition said, being put to it by himself, that he prefers expansion<br />
to stability. I want to say, if it is a permissible form<br />
of words, that we prefer both. We attach enormous importance to<br />
stability not for stability's own sake, but because we believe in<br />
expansion and because we believe that unless we can have a stable<br />
base in this country we can never attract the investments, the<br />
hopes, and the willingness to take risks that the country needs<br />
if it is to expand as it should. I could elaborate on that, but I<br />
will not, because my time has almost expired. Perhaps, before I<br />
resume my seat, I ouht to say that I hope I have made it clear<br />
that we do not accept the proposition advanced by the Leader of<br />
no Opposition. </p>
