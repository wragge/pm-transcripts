MANAGEMENT IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY<br />
Prime Minister's Address to Melbourne, 29th<br />
Fe bruary_, I960_<br />
One whose management of certain national affairs is<br />
under daily criticism and is found most inadequate by 49% of the<br />
electors may well claim some boldness in addressing you. But I<br />
have several good excuses, One is that you invited me, at your<br />
own risk. Another is that the business of politics is management<br />
You may perhaps believe that we in politics interfere in your<br />
management too much; but if we had no sense of management you<br />
would properly condemn us. But my third excuse, the best of the<br />
lot, is that we are living in an era in which management has<br />
major responsibilities, and in which national success or failure<br />
may well depend upon it, Any contribution which any of us can<br />
make is therefore desirable.<br />
I am encouraged by remembering that when I was a law<br />
student at Melbourne, under that great and good man Professor<br />
Harrison Moore, one of my friends in the back row ( a place<br />
eminently designed for meditation) held his hand up and offered<br />
an opinion disguised as a question, Harrison Mocre replied<br />
blandly, " Your suggestion is wrong, Mr. X, but I beg of you not<br />
to be disheartened, All suggestions, from however humble a<br />
source, are to be encouraged!"<br />
This is the 12th International Congress of Scientific<br />
Management. It is organised by the Australian Institute. It<br />
has attracted the attention of eminent men from many countries,<br />
It has already focussed, and will continue to focus, the attention<br />
of thoughtful people upon what is a vital problem,<br />
The very phrase " scientific management" deserves<br />
analysis. For we are all too much disposed to divide up the<br />
activities of life into separate compartments, WJe sometimes think<br />
of philosophers as those who engage in thought without experience;<br />
of politicians as those who have words without substance; of<br />
scientists as those who live strange lives among test tubes and<br />
the piercing of the mysteries of natural elements and forces; of<br />
business men as practical people who have experience w. thout<br />
thought. All of this is, of course, nonsense. We cannot sensibly<br />
subdivide the wcrld in this cynical way. For a. man without<br />
a philosophy of his own is only part of. a man; a politidan<br />
without substance in his mind is no more than a demagogue; a<br />
scientist who fails to see the impact of his work upon humanity<br />
is, quite possibly a menace; and a business man who has no<br />
comprehensive and orderly, and therefore scientific, thoughts in<br />
his mind will contribute little to the development of production<br />
and commerce. My assignment is to speak to you of " Management in a<br />
developing country". The very title is a recognition of the<br />
basic fact that, like every other element in life, the problems<br />
of management change with the years and with the circumstances,<br />
Jhen I was first Prime Minister, over 20 years ago, the business<br />
of government had only a fraction of the complexity which ipossesses<br />
tody Wars, depjressions, booms, the increasing demands<br />
made upon governments, a social revolution, have made their mark.<br />
In the course of one normal working week quite recently, to quote<br />
an actual example, I found myself trying to understand and do<br />
something about Budgetary policy, central banking action and<br />
monetary control., the protection and encouragement of industry.<br />
social services, the wage structure and its machinery, mineral </p>
<p>development, foreign policy and relations with neighbouring<br />
countries, the financial relations between Commonwealth and<br />
States, the problems of inflation, and policies relating to<br />
civil airlines. A developing country is a complex country. To<br />
understand what is going on requires that we should have learned<br />
to manage our own minds. This indeed, is the basic truth in all<br />
management. When I undertook this task, it occurred to me that to<br />
understand something about current and future develope nt it<br />
would be useful to look back 50 years, to see something of the<br />
changes that have occurred in Australia in that time. A study<br />
of those fascinating volumes, the Year Books, has enabled me to<br />
take a few key examples.<br />
I find that 1910 was a year of economic simplicity for<br />
governments, though not, of course, for many thousands of private<br />
people. Taxes were low. There was no Commonwealth Income Tax:<br />
the first world war produced that. The total Commonwealth<br />
Revenues were about œ 20m. Today they are œ 1400m. Our population<br />
was much less than half of what it is now. ife had 300,000 employed<br />
in factaies; today we have well over a million. Our<br />
overseas trade was made up of œ 60m. of imports and œ 74m. of exports.<br />
The exchanges were normal. Nobody had heard of exchange<br />
control or dollar shortages, or a two-currency world. The great<br />
problem of overseas funds had not arisen. Today our overseas<br />
trade has grown to œ 900m. of imports and over œ 900m. of exports.<br />
Exchanges are controlled, we have been passing through a period<br />
of the licensing of imports to protect our balances. ', ie are<br />
living in an era of Trade Treaties, the General Agreement on<br />
Tariffs and Trade, the European Common Market, and a score of<br />
other arrangements of an international kind which have studded<br />
what used to be the fairly plain road of trade with a myriad of<br />
signposts and prohibitions.<br />
There has been a social revolution. In 1910 there were<br />
65,000 old age pensioners; today there are ovei 500,000. There<br />
was no Invalid Pension; no Child Endowment; no Hosc" ' al Benefits;<br />
no Repatriation Benefits; no Medical Health tcneme; no<br />
Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme; no Unemployment Insurance, We<br />
paid œ 1,500,000 for Old Age Pensions. Today our Social Services<br />
Bill alone is over œ 300m. Our Defence Bill in. 1910 was œ 3m.<br />
Today, with no actual war on, it is œ 190m.<br />
I have selected these few examples because the Social<br />
Revolution has involved enormous increases in company and individual<br />
Taxation, new indirect taxes, and a host of governmental<br />
rules and reulations, all of which directly affect business and<br />
therefore management. For in a complex world, with growing burdens,<br />
the pressure on management is greater, and the need for<br />
managerial skill more imperative.<br />
Side by side with these things, there has been a vast<br />
development in the power and significance of the Trades Unions.<br />
In 1910 there were rather less than 360 000 morn' -s of Unions.<br />
Today there must be very nearly 2,000,000. But the matter does<br />
not end there. To meet the particular nature of the Commonwealth's<br />
industrial powers, there has been a great development<br />
of inter-state, i. e. nationally organised unions. Their weight,<br />
both politically and industrially, is susbstantial. The percentage<br />
of unionists to the total of wage and salary earners has<br />
risen to a preponderating degree.<br />
It follows from all this that business managerent has<br />
been learning to accommodate itself to the pressure of organisations;<br />
to recognise their value; to study their relationship<br />
to problems of management; to secure better human relations and<br />
man-management. But such problems cannot be solved by governments </p>
<p>alone. They call for good management and good work all round.<br />
We in Australia pride ourselves on our independence and a degree<br />
of irreverence about established persons or institutions. This<br />
is very good, for other ise pomposity could well become the endemic<br />
disease of politics, But this spirited attitude does<br />
not prevent us from taking most of our problems to " the government",<br />
as if that magnificent abstraction was all-powerful<br />
( which, fortunately, it is not) and all-wise, which will be admitted<br />
by nobody here tonight except myself. The sobe, truth is<br />
that community problems cannot be solved except by community<br />
effort. At a time like this, when we are not dealing with a<br />
crisis, but are called upon to take sensible steps to prevent<br />
one from arising, no good. citizen can hope to escape from his<br />
own responsibilities. Employees have well-understood ambitions<br />
for better pay and conditions, and security of employment, and a<br />
full opportunity for their children. But they must, and I am<br />
sure many thousands of them do, ealise that if wage increases<br />
outstrip increased productivity the effect will be that demand<br />
will exceed supply, prices will iise, and the value of rmoney will<br />
fall. e-nployees, therefore, have a vested interest in increased<br />
efficiency . nd production. It is by these means that real and<br />
effective wages will rise and family interests be served.<br />
On his side, the employer who simply passes on wage<br />
increases into higheo prices is contribting to the in-flationary<br />
spiral; rendering inevitable the next wage increas and cost<br />
increase, and price increase. Vast numbers of orc_.: a.. y citizens<br />
will suffer in the process, the export industries : i. ll be<br />
penalised, and the national finances will be discrganised, The<br />
task of the employer, who is for this prpose the manager, is<br />
therefore to meet each upward movement of labour cost first, by<br />
absorbing it as far as porsible, not regarding the currenit rate<br />
of profit as sacrosanct, , nd second ( or should it be first) so<br />
improving the efficiency of his operations as to reduce. or at<br />
least stabilise, his unit costs of production. The crowing<br />
availability of power, the rapid de'v . lopiuent of *. rliat we now call<br />
automation, the rising levels of education and skiill? , hould pay<br />
their o: ih dividends to ordinary mz; n nd women. If, chirefore,<br />
there is on the face of it a conflict between th2 iprf-its of investment<br />
and the upward pressure on wages, that conflicc be<br />
seen as a challenge to increased efficiency on both: sides, I<br />
short, the present period of our national cde'.. o. leent c ; n rroduce<br />
a damaging inflation if we are to pass the labours of contributing<br />
ingenuity to others and adopt as our mottc " E'ach for<br />
himself, and the devil take -he hindmost". But if ore se the<br />
problem and are prepared to understand nd deal with it, we ccan<br />
make the decade of the 60' s in Austr:. lia even more dynamic and<br />
productive than the last 10 years,<br />
Because I believe that, I assert that the most important<br />
Australians today are the mana; j ars. It is upon Their s" il I<br />
imagination, and enterprise that the national futur' wil den<br />
Against this background, political managers and business managers<br />
confront what is, properly speaking, a common task.<br />
It nmay perhaps induce a proper feeling of biothx ho. d<br />
if I say to you that we both suffer from common . orms of teml tation.<br />
You are tempted, and I hope you will net deny it, to regard<br />
politicians as verbose ' fllows who don't i. nderstand business<br />
and ought to keep their meddling fingers out of it. That sturdy<br />
attitude of mind persists until it becomes necessary to ask a<br />
government for a tariff, or bounty, or a trade promotion<br />
organisation, or an immigration programmo,<br />
Joe in politics are tempted to regard buriness men as<br />
politically ill-informed, and as failing to see th fo. rst of<br />
national economic policy for the trues of individual profit or </p>
<p>loss. But there is another form of temptation which is more<br />
important. You are tempted to take short views; so are we. The<br />
raising of prices, in a non-exporting and protected industry<br />
seems in the short run to be calculated to protect this year s<br />
trading account. In the long run, such a policy may involve the<br />
busin ss in decline and loss.<br />
Similarly, in politics, we are tempted to take the<br />
popular measure of the moment " the electors will be pleased!"<br />
forgetting that great economic policies seldom bear fruit in a<br />
month or two, and may be bitterly unpopular before they achieve<br />
a recognised success. In the long run, the short view may involve<br />
the nation in decline and loss.<br />
In both fields, therofore, clear intelligent imaginative,<br />
and brave management is of the essence. Above . ll, if<br />
people like you and me are to work together intelligently and<br />
successfully for the nation, we must get, not only wisdom but<br />
understanding. I will take one contentious mattor the licensing<br />
of imports. A restriction of imports by means other than<br />
customs tariffs is, under modern treaty and practice, permissible<br />
only to protect our overseas balances. We could find ourselves<br />
greatly embarrassed under GATT, and other international monetary<br />
arrangements, if we failed to realiso this.<br />
Time after time, my colleagues and I have wa: ned industry<br />
that import licensing is not a measure designed to protect<br />
Australian industry, but one designed to protect our overseas<br />
funds. Yet in a real sense, this has boon a counsel of<br />
perfection. If certain imports are, over a period of years,<br />
excluded or limited in quantity, not by tariff but by licensing,<br />
many people will begin or extend import-rcp. acing industries in<br />
those fields, hoping that what is, by declaration, temporary will<br />
turn out to be in practice, permanent. Yet, when the economic<br />
foundation of import licensing begins to disappear, and licensing<br />
with it, it will be hard for many to understand that the days of<br />
competition have returned; that tariffs, though important, are<br />
not the whole answer, and that management will have to carry the<br />
main burden. In my philosophy, that is no bad thing. I believe in<br />
free enterprise. That does not mean protected and monopoly enterprise,<br />
sheltered from competitbn; but competitive free enterprise,<br />
adequately protected by tariff against a cheap labour or<br />
unfair competition, but not given an exclusive access to the<br />
local market, irrespective of structure or efficiency.<br />
Let n. e turn t: o another , eneral observation. The<br />
current cant of C A P I T A L and L A B 0 U R is a great and<br />
misleading oversimplification. It conjures up a picture of fat<br />
capitalists and hungry workers, ungaged in a war to the knife.<br />
This picture is out of dato. Like so many conceptions which are<br />
thought to be radical and progressive, it is unreal and reactionary.<br />
The jrowing task is that of M A N A GE M E N T, which<br />
has to see that capital is put to the best use, and that labour<br />
is most productively applied. 2o do the latte:, management must<br />
regard the welfare of the employee and his human problems as of<br />
growing importance. Human leadership is the greatest element in<br />
productive management. There was a time wThen the capitalist was<br />
the employoe: direct. Psychologies arose which, as I have indicated,<br />
have persisted and are r', yed up. But in great modern<br />
enterprises, the " capitalists" are many and unseen. A little of<br />
their money m_-y form part of the great pool which supplies the<br />
enterprise. But the employers in substance are the managers<br />
employees themselves, who marry the money to the machine to the<br />
man. </p>
<p>So true is this that I have no '. seitation in saying<br />
that the development of Australia in the future will depend<br />
more upon compotent management, ' ohether of farms or factories<br />
or mines or . overnments or Trade Unions, than upon any other<br />
factor. Pressure groups will not ensure or even aid progress,<br />
for they seek power without responsibility. People rith money<br />
and nothing more will not unsure it, for they are passive. A<br />
badly managed factory worker will not ensure it, for he will fail<br />
to identify himself and his work with the end in view. The vital<br />
people are the managers, the loaders who plan for that end and<br />
see how to attain it.<br />
I now turn to some of the problems of true national<br />
development. What are the principal characteristics of rapid development<br />
in Australia? If we answer that question we will have a<br />
better idea of the nature of the tasks of management and of the<br />
difficulties which it will confront.<br />
The greatest characteristics, as I see them, are these,<br />
Wl ' i have a quickly increasing population, nearly half<br />
of the increase being the direct result of governmental immigration<br />
policies. This increase, while it stimulates optimism in<br />
business circles, provides additional stores of productive manpower,<br />
and adds to our national security, also creates its problems.<br />
There is a greater capital demand for factories and<br />
schools nd houses and servies, which in the short run is inflationary.<br />
In many large factories which I have visited, the copresence<br />
of hundreds of workers of different nationalities and<br />
languages has presented problems of organization and management,<br />
the handling of which excites my admiration.<br />
But, taking all these things into accou-t, I think that<br />
the outstanding effect of a fast growing populat-. jn is its psycho<br />
-logical ofect upon enterprise. The retailer plans and buys for<br />
an increasing number of customers. He is perhaps, less willing<br />
to be " taken over", or more willing to " take over". Retail trade<br />
is optimistic and increasing. Man-aacturing expands. The building<br />
industry is active. The great basic industries are hard<br />
pressed to cope with demand.<br />
This atmosphere of optimism is admirable, and indeed<br />
essential to growth. It is, indeed one of the act problems of<br />
political judgment to preserve and encourage optimism while doing<br />
what can be done to avoid excesses which may lead some day<br />
to pessimism and unhappy results. For inflation is a common<br />
dange: r; a flat rate tax upon the money of the poor as well as<br />
of the rich; the enemy of thrift; the basic injustice , ainst<br />
which we must all fight.<br />
A severe and unchecked inflation would be. nationally<br />
disastrous. I think it necessary to say something plain, but<br />
not extravagant, on this point.<br />
If costs rise ( as they are now rising) and prices rise<br />
in consequence we have what we call a " cost-inflation". But if<br />
the cost rises are primarily related to wage increases, the increase<br />
in purchasing power soon produces a " domand-inflation".<br />
-Jo need not, therfore, distinguish unduly betwe. en the two aspects<br />
of what is one common problem.<br />
Can costs go on rising, without national injury? Already,<br />
one or two of the smallr, but not insignificantexport<br />
industries are in trouble. Even the jreatest, like . iool and<br />
wheat, must h.: ve occasional . pprehensions. </p>
<p>But there is another aspect of inflation which cannot<br />
be ignored. As our population grows, so will our demand for<br />
goods and services. That, as our economic history proves, will<br />
be not m.-ely a demand capable of being satisfied by local production.<br />
It will include a large demand for imports. In other<br />
words, as Australia develops she -will become increasingly a<br />
great international trade drawing upon the skills . nd products<br />
of other lands. To pay for such things she will need increasing<br />
exports. If she is to achieve the necessary volume and, in terms<br />
of price, not be unduly vulnerable to changes in the price of<br />
wool, she must add to the diversity of her exports. She must be<br />
able to manufacture for export, and compete in the markets, particularly<br />
of the politically " new wrorld".<br />
There may be some who despair of such a result, though<br />
I think that they will concede that without such a result there<br />
will be a sharp limit to true Australian development.<br />
So there is our problem. In a rapidly developing<br />
country there will inevitably be inflationary pressures, Population<br />
will be increasing; capital demands will be not only<br />
largo but urgent; there will be an atmosphere of gr'owth and<br />
prosperity; standards of living will rise; luxuries will become<br />
necessaries; wages will rise; greater profits w ill be<br />
sought and frequently achieved; there will be international investment;<br />
public works programmes will grow.<br />
Yet, if we yield to the inflationary pressures, and<br />
say that their results do no great harm, we will check fixedinterest<br />
investment; we will be forced to carry more : nd more<br />
capital works on revenue; we will do grave injustice to those<br />
who live on fixed incomes; we will upset Gove-nment Budgets and<br />
move towards chronic deficit finance, thus dding inflation to<br />
inflation; and, except to the extent that c. eavily protected industries<br />
can live on the local market, price o-j: rselves out of the<br />
world. Und.. such circumstances, what action can I; take, not<br />
only as government but as people, to secure and confirm the enormous<br />
advantages of expansion . nd growth while at the same time<br />
maintaining that stability and security which always seems to<br />
to be the pro-condition of the attraction of men, money, and<br />
skill? The appropriate policies need not be sensational;<br />
there is no occasion for extravagance in our thinking, ' Ie can<br />
learn a great deal from our own experience and that of much<br />
greater countries, most or all of which have encountered the<br />
problems. Indeed, I should, to avoid sensational sm, make it<br />
clear that our current problem in Australia is nuch loss acute<br />
than that which follwed the Korean Jar,<br />
I would now like to state quite briefly the nature of<br />
some appropriate policies as we see them,<br />
Our objective must be to check rises in costs, by all<br />
means in our power, and to counteract :. owing monetary demand,<br />
negatively by banking and monetary controls, positively by increasing<br />
the supply of goods and services. The supply will be<br />
increased by active and growing manufucturing industries, and by<br />
imports on a scale that our exports will permit us to pay for.<br />
We must preserve stability of mp uunnpemlopylomynmt ent is<br />
nationally wasteful; so is over-. full employment, which inflation<br />
is apt to create in the first instance. So far as possible we<br />
should encourage savings so that there is adequate investment<br />
out of true savings, in loans for developmental publi works and<br />
in capital for private enterprise. . Je must attract investment,<br />
not speculation, from overseas, But above all, anc this is where<br />
John Citizen comes in, whether employer or employee or self-employed,<br />
we must increase our productivity pe.. head. And, if we </p>
<p>desire the stimulus which would follow a reduction of, or a less<br />
steep increase in, government expenditur, we can moderate our<br />
demands upon GoveL. nments. Don't overlook that last observation.<br />
In Australia we are apt to want the -bst of everything " at once,<br />
if not sooner". Getting our costs down does not mean cutting wages.<br />
It means getting better value for waes by increasing production,<br />
improving processes . nd skills, and attaining a realisation all<br />
round that wages and salaries are worth only what they will buy.<br />
We estimate that the two decisions made last year, in the Basic<br />
Jageo nd Margins cases, iill add something of the order of œ 165m.<br />
to the annual wages bill. Does anybody suppose that employees<br />
in Australia will be œ 165m. better off? If rises in costs and<br />
pricus continue at their recent rate, and tend to grow, employees<br />
may in the long run be no better off at all. : hat we need, for<br />
everybody's sake, is a period of quiet on the wages front, so<br />
that these increases may be digested, and so that industry generally<br />
can, by improved efficiency, ave:.. t their impact upon<br />
prices. It would be fatal to accept the folio circulairo of the<br />
wage-prices spiral as inevitable.<br />
On the side of _ ove: Lnment, the-e are two tasks to perform,<br />
each of which has a bearing upon the other.<br />
The first is to slow down the massive upward movement<br />
of , overnment expenditure, which in the case of the Commonwualth,<br />
has been rising of late at the rate of something like œ 100m. a<br />
year. The second is to do all in our power to avoid further<br />
deficit finance. How to do these things will be our greatest Budget<br />
task later this year. And let nobody think that it will be easy.<br />
It is difficult because management is the most important and the<br />
most difficult element of all.<br />
Thus it is that the problem of inflation presents perhaps<br />
the greatest challenge to management. Take national management<br />
first. The Industrial Tribunals, which exercise a great,<br />
and in its nature uncontrolled and uncontrollable power over the<br />
national economy, have been known to express a view that if<br />
the-o is any inflationary consequence of any decision, " the govoznment"<br />
has power to deal with them. This is, I fear, not<br />
correct. Indeed, it is one of the facts of life that the two<br />
most significant economic instruments, the Arbitration Commission<br />
and the Tariff Board, are, in the first case absolutely and in<br />
the second case for all practical prposes, independent bodies.<br />
I think it a very sood thing that this should be the case. The<br />
nation has good reason to appreciate the work that they have<br />
done. But clearly the Commonwealth's anti-inflationary powers<br />
are severely restricted in consequence. True, if we think that<br />
there is a demand inflation, we can increase taxes, which I know<br />
would give all of you great satisfaction! Interest rates, so<br />
far as they fall within the Banking power or the authority of<br />
the Loan Council, can be vuried. The Reserve Bank may call<br />
Trading Bank funds to Roeserve Deposits. Subject to the state of<br />
the overseas funds more imports may be admitted. Educational<br />
campaigns can be carried on. The costs of government may be<br />
reduced; this is quite a fashionable remedy, though, in the<br />
case of the Commonwealth, the costs of administration amnount to<br />
no mo.. e than of the total Budget.<br />
Hire-purchase seems to be substantially beyond our<br />
control. But the fact is that one of the great obstacles to<br />
counter-inflationary action is that there are many people who </p>
<p>think a bit of inflction is a very good thing; that a cost and<br />
prices rise of 3 or 5 per cent per annum makes for greator purchasing<br />
power buoyancy of business, and of course, if I may so<br />
so impertinently, a decline in the burden of overdrafts and of<br />
fixed indebtedness. Such a view pays little heed to the position<br />
of those on fixed incomes; and no heed whatover to the continuing<br />
and growing need to finance, by public borrowings at fixed<br />
rates of interest, great programme of public works, the completion<br />
of which is absolutely vital, through transport and water<br />
and power and housing and schools and universities, to the expansion<br />
of industry , nd commerce and the maintenance of employmont.<br />
Before I conclude, I would like to say a little more<br />
about import licensing, the impending winding-up of which has<br />
recently been announced, with, naturally, a mixed reception.<br />
A restriction of imports by licensing, if it reduces<br />
the actual quantity of goods available for local purchase, is inflationary<br />
up to the time at which local production roplaces the<br />
deficiency, if it ever does. But in an inflationary period, as<br />
we have seen in the past, boom conditions tend to develop, and<br />
with them over-full employment, bidding up for labour a rapid<br />
turnover of labour, and a loss of efficiency which still further<br />
adds to rising costs. One way of counteracting this is not to<br />
restrict imports, but to purmit them, so that demand does not<br />
overwhelm supply.<br />
But no remedy is simple, particularly in Australia,<br />
where the balance of our international trde can change quite<br />
quickly and drastically. Thus, the year 1953/ 54 was a thriving<br />
year, with employment and production rising and a tolerably good<br />
export income œ 812m. Early in the following year, 1954/ 55,<br />
however, the familiar signs of inflation (-ppoared. Labour shortages<br />
became rath_ r acute, prices began to rise fairly rapidly and,<br />
with local productive capacity fully taxed, the rising demand for<br />
goods spilt over into demand for imports.<br />
Unfortunately, it happened that our exports fell alay<br />
in that ye. r, and our overseas reserves began to decline rapidly.<br />
They had boon œ 571m. at the beginning of the year. By the end of<br />
the year they had fallen to œ 428m. and wore obviously destined to<br />
go a good deal lower. Therefore, instead of being able to meet<br />
the additional demand for imports we actually had to restrict imports<br />
as in fact re did in April 1955 and again in October195.<br />
I mention this piece of history because it illustrates<br />
how constant and complicated the problems of management can be.<br />
Our recent decision in respect of import licensing, made against<br />
the background of buyant overseas reserves, will impose fresh<br />
tasks of management and increased tariff-making activity. This is<br />
not because lice. nsing was a protective measure; we always made it<br />
clear that it was not; but because in the nature of things the<br />
exclusion of imports by non-tariff means tended to give a feeling<br />
of security to a variety of import-replacing industries in Australia.<br />
Some of these industries will now set about justifying a<br />
tariff protection. All of them will meet the challenge of competition,<br />
which is the great challenge to managoonent.<br />
I wish your conference well. Mine has been a small and<br />
inadequate contribution. But the subject is so vast and significant<br />
that all thought about it is to the good.<br />
