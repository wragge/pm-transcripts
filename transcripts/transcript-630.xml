STATEMENT BY-TIEPRTE ISE<br />
( The Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies, Cli, QC, MP.)<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
WEDNESDAY, 17TH OCTOBER, 1962.<br />
ANNOUNCEMENT OF ECONOMIC ENQUIRY<br />
Over recent years the Government has had requests<br />
foj. a-nujber of organisations for public enquiries into<br />
various aspects of our economic affairs. Some of these requests<br />
have related principally, if not wholly, to the Customs Tariff.<br />
Others have sought a wider coverage and, at the extreme, have<br />
wanted an enquiry to comprehend all the main aspects of our<br />
economic affairs. The Government has given much thought to these<br />
requests. It has found difficulty in seeing that an enquiry<br />
limited to the tariff, or any particular aspects of the tariff,<br />
would be a sufficient undertaking. Apart from anything else<br />
there would be great difficulty in confining any enquiry to Lhe<br />
tariff because that subject is connected with and dependent<br />
upon so many other issues. On the other hand, a general economic<br />
enquiry, as some have proposed, might have to become almost<br />
illimitably wide, take more time than is justified and by its<br />
very breadth, lead to conclusions so broad and vague and<br />
qualifiud as to be of little practical use. We have decided,<br />
therefore, to institute an enquiry of a particular kind.<br />
We feel that it should serve the requirements of<br />
the widest number of people and organisations, that it should<br />
be helpful not only to the Government and its various agencies<br />
but also to trade and industry, to all who play a constructive<br />
role in the growth of our economy. What we all need is light<br />
upon possibilities rather than guidance upon how to go about<br />
achieving this or that objective. We hope to have drawnm upas<br />
far as it is possible to do so with the information that<br />
can be had a chart or prospectus of our economic potentialone<br />
that would show both the extent of our resources and their<br />
capabilities and also the limitations upon those resources.<br />
It would also be valuable to have some competent<br />
and objective advice of an analytical kind upon certain great<br />
questions regarding the best use and disposition of our resources,<br />
For it is one of the fundamental facts about our economy that<br />
while many of our resources, so far as we know them, are good<br />
in point of quality, they are also limited in extent and subject<br />
to various handicaps upon their development. This makes it of<br />
the first importance that we should put them to the best and<br />
most productive use.<br />
These are the main considerations which have guided<br />
the Government in drawing up terms of reference for an enquiry.<br />
These terms of reference are as follows<br />
" HAVING IN MINI) THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF<br />
THE GOVERNMENTIS ECONOMIC POLICY ARE A HIGH RATE<br />
OF ECONOMIC AND POPULATION GROWTH WITH FULL<br />
EMPLOYMENT9 RISING STANDARDS OF LIVING EX( TERNAL<br />
VIABILITY, AND STABILITY OF COSTS AND RICES,<br />
TO ENQUIRE INTO AND REPORT ITS FINDINGS ON THE<br />

<p>-2<br />

IN THE WORK FORCE COMPONENT;<br />
THE AVAILABILTITY OF KNOTWN BASIC PHYSICAL<br />

THE GROWTH OF DOMESTIC SAVINGS;<br />

ECONOMY);<br />
THE LIKELY PATTERN OF GROWTH AND GEOGRAPHICAL<br />

AND TERTIARY ( INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENTAL<br />
SECTOR);<br />
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FOR THE OCCUPATIONAL<br />

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION FOR EXPORT<br />
AND THE SECURING OF ADEQUATE EXPORT<br />
OUTLETS; AND<br />
THE EFFECT OF CUSTOMS TARIFFS AND OTHER<br />
FORMS, DIRECT OR INDIRECT OF PROTECTION<br />
ON THE DISPOSITION OF RES6URGES AND ON<br />
THE BROAD ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES STATED<br />
ABOVE. I<br />
As they s-tand, these terms of reference are largely selfexplanatory<br />
and need no great elaboration. No doubt, when the<br />
Committee which is to conduct the enquiry has been assembled,<br />
we will have some discussion wi1' th them so that they will be<br />
quite clear in their minds as to what it is the Government<br />
wants them to do on its behalf and for the community.<br />
Appointments to the Committee will be made as<br />
soon as possible. it is not intended to establish the body as a formal<br />
Royal Commission. Within its terms of reference we want the<br />
Committee to hiave the greatest possible freedom in deciding how<br />
it goes about its work.<br />
The Committee will obviously require considerable<br />
staff assistance and we shall certainly see, to that. It -also<br />
seems likely that the Committee will w'ish to call on various<br />
people or institutions to undertake special enquiries. The<br />
facilities of relevant Commonwealth. Departments and authorities<br />
will be available to the Committee, and we do not doubt that we<br />
will also have the co-operation of State Governments and their<br />
associated authorities, so for as this is necessary.<br />
Especially do we hope that industry, in its various<br />
branches, will co-operate in making information av. ailable and<br />
perhaps in undertaking investigations which only they are<br />
capable of carrying out. It should be emphasised again that,<br />
in the degree that it is successful in throwing light on our<br />
economic future, the results of the enquiry can be of great<br />
value to industry and trade as well as to governments. 9a &amp; / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
For its part, the Government hopes that the enquiry<br />
will be helpful to it in providing information which will help<br />
it in the determination of many fundamental issues of policy,<br />
Amongst these, obviously, will be the important issue of tariff<br />
policy in its broadest aspects. It should help particularly<br />
in setting the role of the tariff in its due context and<br />
perspective and integrating it with economic policy as a whole.<br />
Naturally the Government will wish the report of<br />
the enquiry to be available to it as early as possible. At the<br />
same time it realises how wide and complex and difficult are<br />
the subjects it is putting before the Committee and it has not<br />
therefore laid down a fixed period within which the Committee<br />
should make its final report. That is something on which it<br />
will talk to the Committee when it has been brought together.<br />
The Government wishes to make it clear that it has<br />
the firmest intention of preserving the full independence of<br />
the Tariff Board as an advisory body established by Parliament,<br />
its system of open and public enquiry and its high public<br />
standing and prestige. These things are of the very essence<br />
of the Tariff Board system which has, over many years, served<br />
Australia well and has won admiration and respect overseas.<br />
The Tariff Board is, to repeat, an advisory body.<br />
It is not a policy-making body although its recommendations<br />
necessarily have a considerable influence on policy and it<br />
is not an executive body. Its principal and best-known function<br />
is to consider, on reference from th, Government, applications<br />
for protection by way of tariffs or bounties or, alternatively,<br />
proposals for the reduction of such protection. It also has<br />
power on its own initiative to review existing duties, to<br />
conduct enquiries on certain matters and to report to Parliament.<br />
But tariff policy as such is the responsibility of<br />
the Government. Only Parliament can enact tariffs; only the<br />
Government proposes tariff legislation to Parliament.<br />
The tariff and other forms of protection such<br />
as bounties and subsidies are means to provide a degree of<br />
shelter for local industries against the competition of imports<br />
from other countries and so to sustain and promote the growth<br />
of these local industries. Protection has been the policy of<br />
all Australian Governments since Federation. Our own policy<br />
is clear; we are for effective protection for efficient<br />
Australian industry. Tariff policy involves broad issues of principle<br />
how far one class of industry should be encouraged by protection<br />
as compared with other classes of industry, whether diversity<br />
of industry should be sought or specialisation, what relative<br />
weights should be given to the effect of tariffs on costs<br />
generally, on rural incomes and on consumers, how far international<br />
reactions to tariff increases should be taken into<br />
account and so on. But tariff-making is also a matter of<br />
decision in individual cases within a general framework of<br />
principles and under a changing context of circumstances. In<br />
that sense, tariff policy is built up and elaborated, precedent<br />
by precedent. It is equally apparent that policy on tariffs and<br />
protection generally must form part of, and be consistent with,<br />
economic policy as a whole. It must serve the same broad </p>
<p>4<br />
-obje-ct-ives of policy, external as well as internal. It clearly<br />
must be related to overseas trade policy our relations with<br />
other countries as well as to internal policy on the industries<br />
which provide the exports for overseas trade. it must be<br />
related to population growth and full employment but it must<br />
also be related to the problem of costs and prices.<br />
More and more as our experience widens, it is<br />
borne in upon us that sound courses of action depend on our<br />
ability to see ahead and, having seen ahead, to prepare<br />
a head. The need for more information and better information,<br />
more light on what is going on today, what may or may not be<br />
going on tomorrow or next year or the ne: ft five or ten years,<br />
is common ground with everyone. Business demands,. rightly<br />
enough, to know what thec Government is trying to do, what<br />
its objectives are and what its lines of policy will be.<br />
The Government, on its part, feols the need to know more of<br />
what business hopes to do and plans to do.<br />
The work of the Committee should help us all. </p>
