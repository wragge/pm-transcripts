    <content><![CDATA[<p>Russia's veto of the United Nations Security Council resolution to establish a tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the MH17 atrocity is outrageous.</p>
<p>Two hundred and ninety eight innocent people, including 38 Australians, were murdered when the aircraft was shot down above Ukraine just over a year ago.</p>
<p>By its actions today, Russia has shown complete disregard for the families' right to know who was responsible and to see these criminals face justice.</p>
<p>Russia had an opportunity to join the international community in this effort.</p>
<p>Its actions reinforce concerns Russia is protecting the perpetrators and continuing to assault the sovereignty of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Australia will continue its work with our partners to see justice done.</p>
