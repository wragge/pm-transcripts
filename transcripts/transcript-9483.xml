PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR, 16 FEBRUARY 1995,<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
CALLER: Welcome Mr Keating, and I think half of these people that have rung<br />
up should go to the UK and live under a conservative government and<br />
then they would know it's not easy. This is a very, very good country<br />
under Mr Keating's government, it's absolutely magnificent and that's<br />
all I would like to say. Welcome Paul.<br />
HS: Did you hear that?<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
HS: That was a nice introduction.<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
HS: The rest of it wasn't all so good. Thank you very much for your call.<br />
Look, the Prime Minister has joined me in the studio early, how are<br />
you?<br />
PM: I am good Howard, thanks.<br />
HS: Where have you been is a question I must ask you before the news<br />
because we haven't seen you here for 11 months, where have you<br />
been?<br />
PM: I would have come in August, but I..<br />
HS: What happened?<br />
PM: Got a bad attack of the flu as you know.<br />
HS: Well, people are making much of this fact that you appear to show us<br />
little regard. </p>
<p>PM: What they should be making much of is the fact that the economy has<br />
grown here 10 per cent in one year. It took 150 to 200 years to get so<br />
big then it got 10 per cent bigger in one year. Now, that is what I am<br />
here for, that's what I do. I am about making Australia grow more<br />
strongly and the last election the Government was rehired to restart<br />
the growth and employment. That's what we have done. That's what<br />
the community have got to worry about. Is he over there getting me a<br />
job? Answer yes.<br />
HS: Well, Richard Court would say he has done all that because it's all<br />
happened since his government came to power.<br />
PM: So, in other words the rest of the growth around the economy is all his<br />
too? In Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland..<br />
HS: No, it's Jeff Kennett in Victoria and..<br />
PM: What has happened, it's come off the Federal government's policies.<br />
This State has been growing, it's had 10 per cent economic growth in<br />
this last year which is just phenomenal and 5 per cent employment<br />
growth and 2 per cent inflation. It's come off the back of the Federal<br />
government's policies.<br />
HS: But, would you agree, I don't want to labour this too much, but there is<br />
a perception that if you are not here you don't care, and you agree<br />
there is a perception?<br />
PM: Perception from all the people who generally try to give us a boot in<br />
the tail at their ballot box, but from the people who are serious and are<br />
on side I don't think that is..<br />
HS: Do you know we are parochial Western Australians?<br />
PM: I know, but why should you be? I mean here you are, you're<br />
contributing a very large proportion of the country's growth. I mean<br />
much of the economic policy for the last decade had been set up in<br />
Canberra for Western Australia, the exporting states of Western<br />
Australia and Queensland and we have got here Carmen Lawrence<br />
and Kim Beazley and Peter Cook and our Ministers who are constantly<br />
here and putting me and the Cabinet in touch with Western Australia.<br />
I mean this is a we have got modern communications, it is important,<br />
I think, for Prime Minister's to visit parts of the country. I try to do that,<br />
but as you know to come west it's at least 2 days. So, it's 2 days out of<br />
any week and in this case it's 3, so given the pressure of the job it's<br />
not easy to do it all the time.<br />
HS: Well, I have got lots more questions to ask you and we will do that<br />
after the news and we will take some talkback, as much as we can. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister is in the studio with me and it's good to have him<br />
here after a gap of 11 months so we have got a lot of catch up on,<br />
haven't we?<br />
PM: It's your call.<br />
AD BREAK<br />
HS: We have the Prime Minister in the studio today, he is here in Western<br />
Australia for a three day visit and some of the issues which I know that<br />
most people want discussed are the Mabo land rights legislation, how<br />
it is going to impact on Western Australia, there is health and housing<br />
of Aboriginal people, there is the upcoming federal Budget, there has<br />
been a huge blue over road funding and a nice old set too over that,<br />
petrol prices and the fact that the Federal Government takes about 33<br />
cents in the litre and the suggestion that it might take more and forest<br />
management. Prime Minister, will you be discussing all or some of<br />
those issues while you are here and who will you talk to about that?<br />
PM: Well, you if you want to Howard.<br />
HS: Thank you.<br />
PM: Go for it straight away.<br />
HS: That puts me ahead of the Premier.<br />
PM: Well, in these things you probably are.<br />
HS: Good, thanks very much. Now, you made the point before the no<br />
I'm happy about that you made the point before the news that to<br />
come across here takes at least two days out of your time. The<br />
Premier, I guess, would contend that if he is going to go across to<br />
Canberra or his Ministers and see their counterparts, the same thing<br />
applies to them.<br />
PM: Well, that is true except there is half a dozen States and moving<br />
around them requires a substantial commitment of time, but<br />
nevertheless this is what we are all happy to do.<br />
HS: Now, can we expect, although I don't want to make everything of this,<br />
but more regular visits from you in the future?<br />
PM: It depends what the time is, when the Parliament is sitting, what the<br />
issues are. I mean, last year we had a May Budget we changed it for<br />
the time from August, we've always had August Budgets since the<br />
war. Last year we changed that and that changed a lot of the<br />
schedules. I had a number of overseas commitments, of course, one<br />
of them was APEC in Indonesia in November and a number of others </p>
<p>in the second half of the year and it is just pulling the better part of a<br />
week out, you know, you can do it, but you can only do it at the cost of<br />
basically keeping ones eye on the ball.<br />
HS: This business about the Premier won't see you and you won't find time<br />
for him, can you appreciate that electorate thinks this is a little bit<br />
puerile?<br />
PM: Well look, it is on his part. I mean, what normally happens to me is if I<br />
am coming to Melbourne Jeff Kennett will call be a week earlier or<br />
something and say ' I hear you are down next week, have you got any<br />
time?' and I'll ' yes', or John Fahey the same, and we'll have a meeting<br />
and hardly anybody knows and we'll sit down and do a bit of business.<br />
What Richard Court does is firstly go on your radio station then write<br />
me, essentially, a sort of rude letter, then release it to the newspapers<br />
and then send it to me and I'm supposed to say ' oh, yes, here I am<br />
Richard, now what do you want me to discuss?' I mean he has got to<br />
be joking.<br />
HS: So, you are saying that if he had written a..<br />
PM: If he was dinkum, if he is genuinely interested in the issues of his State<br />
and his people he would ring me and say ' look, you are coming over<br />
next week' he knew I was coming.<br />
HS: He did know you were coming?<br />
PM: Oh yes, because we had invited him to the Regional Economic<br />
Development Organisation launch yesterday. He knew I was coming<br />
and if had said to me ' look, can you make some time for me' I would<br />
have seen him. But, if there is a genuine wish to talk about some<br />
things, but you see, there is essentially no co-operation from him and<br />
what he does is he comes on your radio station, then he says he wants<br />
to see me. He then publishes a letter to the newspapers and then he<br />
sends a copy to me. So, he is not serious and if he is not serious why<br />
should I if he is in to playing games, I'll lend him a little snakes and<br />
ladders set before I leave. Another thing about him is, the terrible<br />
thing about him is he'll probably use it. In the quiet time up there he<br />
would probably get into it.<br />
HS: OK, but are we going to be punished for all of this? The West<br />
Australian..<br />
PM: No, just understand this, let me just take..<br />
HS: You don't hate us because we have got a Liberal government do you?<br />
PM: Look, don't confuse my association and good wishes and work for the<br />
Western Australian community with what I do with Richard Court. If he </p>
<p>wants to, essentially, deprecate their interests and discount them by<br />
these sorts of antics the point I made before the news Howard is this,<br />
Western Australia grew by 10 per cent economic growth last year. In<br />
other words, if we kept that up for 10 years, everything that has been<br />
created in the 150 to 200 years here would be recreated in full in<br />
years. Can you just imagine what speed of growth that is.<br />
HS: But, you won't let that happen anyway.<br />
PM: But, 10 per cent economic growth and 5 per cent employment growth<br />
and 2 per cent inflation, the growth and the change in Western<br />
Australia is coming off the policies of the national federal Labor<br />
government. Now, they are the things I mean essentially, in the last<br />
election campaign the issues were all about growth and employment. I<br />
said that we would make the economy grow again and we would get<br />
employment growth started. We started that with the One Nation<br />
package where we started spending money in 1992. When private<br />
spending was down we lifted public spending. Now, they are things<br />
that matter most to West Australians. I mean, this is a big primary<br />
exporting State, it has got minerals, it has got agriculture, it is now<br />
selling ships, ferries, sophisticated metals like the place I was at<br />
yesterday. That can only happen with the competitiveness, the low<br />
inflation, the exchange rate, the wage outcomes coming from the<br />
federal government's policies.<br />
HS: Sure, but just when it looks as though Australia is going to take off and<br />
we record a growth rate of 6.4 per cent, which in the Asian region<br />
wouldn't be considered anything special, you've loped the top off it<br />
with interest rate rises 2 and 3/ 4 per cent in five months.<br />
PM: But what we want is a sustainable rate of growth. Let's record this fact<br />
HS: We just want to enjoy ourselves.<br />
PM: Yes, but we want to continue to enjoy ourselves. We don't want to<br />
enjoy ourselves for one year, we want to continue to enjoy ourselves.<br />
This is the fastest growing, the economy of Australia, is the fastest<br />
growing western world economy by a big margin.<br />
HS: But, not as high as the Asian region countries?<br />
PM: But, the Asian region do not have a developed economy like this. I<br />
mean, for instance let's take Malaysia which is an important economy<br />
in this area. It's GDP is $ 40 billion, their whole national output is<br />
billion. It is growing at about 8 per cent a year. Australia is $ 400<br />
billion and we are growing at 5.5 to 6 per cent. You try and lift a<br />
platform of $ 400 billion and make it grow at 5.5 to 6 per cent. There is<br />
or $ 30 billions worth of wealth there. </p>
<p>HS: OK, but what's sustainable, I mean what will you allow to happen?<br />
PM: Well, if this was a European country and we were having a discussion<br />
on European radio, the average rate of growth would be 1.5 per cent<br />
for the nation. Here in Western Australia it is 10 per cent. In the<br />
whole of Australia it is 6 per cent. But what we are saying is to keep<br />
that going we have got to be able to produce the goods and services<br />
so it is not spilling into imports. In other words, we can't grow at a<br />
pace where we can't provide the product for it.<br />
HS: But, how would you like to be working in the housing/ building industry<br />
and all of a sudden interest rates go up 2 and 3/ 4 per cent in five<br />
months, they might go up more in the next few months then suddenly<br />
your work has stopped, that is what's happening.<br />
PM: It will slow down..<br />
HS: No, it's stopped in many cases.<br />
PM: But, overall it will slow down and it is coming off a massive high which,<br />
in the large, is unsustainable. But, if you take, I'm not sure what the<br />
medium priced accommodation market is like here in Perth, I certainly<br />
know about Sydney. Sydney is now becoming over supplied, hugely<br />
over supplied with medium priced, medium density housing. So, public<br />
policy slows it down and it makes the recovery more affordable so that<br />
when we are talking about 1996 and 1997 and 1998 we've still got<br />
good growth and low inflation. What we don't want to see is the<br />
growth go at such a pace that it blows the inflation rate and we are<br />
back into difficulties again.<br />
HS: Ok, but can I ask you what is sustainable, what would the Government<br />
allow to happen on a regular basis 4 per cent, 5 per cent, what?<br />
PM: We are saying, our target is to get to an unemployment we think it is<br />
feasible to get to an unemployment rate of about 5 per cent by the year<br />
2000.<br />
HS: That is your target is it?<br />
PM: Well, that we think is within our reach and you can only do that<br />
growing roughly at around 4 per cent a year nationally. Now, some<br />
States will do less than 4, others will do higher, but the average will 4<br />
per cent. At the moment the average is 6 per cent. So, we are slowing<br />
it down for the good of everybody. In other words, it is to everybody's<br />
benefit that their job security is not an issue, that they can look forward<br />
to their children getting jobs and they can look forward to their savings<br />
not been torn apart.. </p>
<p>HS: So, these are the interest rate rises we have to have are they?<br />
PM: Remember how low they have been. I mean, we took interest rates<br />
down to Reserve Bank cash rates, bill rates of 4.5 to 5 per cent and<br />
they are now around 5 per cent. They are now around 8 per cent, but<br />
they are still low..<br />
HS: But, we do remember how high..<br />
PM: The last 20 years, I mean they are very low rates.<br />
HS: We do remember how high home loan interest rates got under<br />
Treasurer Paul Keating, don't we about 18 per cent.<br />
PM: No, they never got to 18 per cent.<br />
HS: Maybe I went to the wrong bank.<br />
PM: Well, maybe you did Howard, but they never got to 18 per cent. But,<br />
at the moment they are around 10 per cent. Now, all of that reduction<br />
in interest rates meant a big lift in take home pay to people because<br />
they weren't paying it out on mortgages. So, what we have done is put<br />
a modest increase in there which will actually slow the economy and<br />
make the growth more sustainable for people and give it low inflation.<br />
As I said a week or so ago, it is a premium that Australians are paying<br />
to guarantee the longevity of growth. But, the core point is it is the<br />
Labor government in Canberra that delivered this growth to Australia<br />
and to Western Australia and getting these big competitiveness issues<br />
right and the linkages into Asia and the business which is coming<br />
down to Western Australia from Asia is in large part because of the<br />
Federal government's policies.<br />
HS: Can we talk about the leaking of the Budget ' wish list'. A lot of people<br />
think it is a bit rich for your government to be calling in the cops when<br />
back in 1980..<br />
PM: No, I'm not calling any cops.<br />
HS: Kim Beazley did didn't he?<br />
PM: No, no the police do all these things they make all this clear<br />
themselves. If confidential government property is stolen, the police<br />
investigate it, but they always have.<br />
HS: So, who called them in?<br />
PM: That would be done by the Commissioner. </p>
<p>HS: So, no politician, no one in government said ' look, the Budget papers<br />
have been leaked, or the wish list, will you investigate it', they just did<br />
it.<br />
PM: Obviously the police have been notified.<br />
HS: By who?<br />
PM: Well, they would be notified by the Secretary of the Department that<br />
had them stolen, no doubt.<br />
HS: And the Minister Mr Beazley, none of the other Ministers would have..<br />
PM: Look, don't fall for this line, Howard, that the Liberal's have..<br />
HS: I'm just asking questions.<br />
PM: I know, but you are repeating a line from the Liberals, you know, the<br />
Costello line " Keating has put the police on us". The fact is they<br />
have got Budget documents which have been stolen and when<br />
something of core value to the nation's interest has been stolen,<br />
pilfered, the Commonwealth police will always..<br />
HS: It is only a wish list isn't it?<br />
PM: It is a wish list by Departments, but it still is a document from the<br />
process of the Budget.<br />
HS: But, back in 1980 Treasurer John Howard's entire Budget was leaked.<br />
Now, I didn't hear anyone on your side complaining about that.<br />
PM: No, but it wasn't leaked to us. It was leaked to Laurie Oakes, a<br />
journalist. This has been leaked to the Opposition. This is a<br />
completely different matter, I mean, this has been leaked to the Liberal<br />
party.<br />
HS: So, you think there was nothing wrong with what happened in 1980.<br />
PM: Well, I don't believe the Budget I think it is a dreadful thing that the<br />
Budget should be revealed. It was a dreadful thing then and it is now,<br />
but it was done then by somebody to a journalist. This has been given<br />
to the Liberal party and then they want to pretend that they are not<br />
stolen documents. Well, of course they are stolen documents.<br />
HS: There has been a 40 per cent let's get on to road funding because<br />
this is another issue that does certainly affect Western Australia and<br />
the figure that I have been shown shows a 40 per cent reduction in<br />
Commonwealth outlays for roads in Western Australia during the past<br />
three financial years. Can you justify that? </p>
<p>PM: That is not true. The base funding, I mean Kim Beazley made this<br />
clear. Look, Richard Court has put on a 4 cents per litre petrol tax for<br />
his own reasons, for himself and his budget.<br />
HS: Nothing that needs $ 100 million extra to spend on roads.<br />
PM: It is nothing to do with the Commonwealth, nothing what so ever. The<br />
base funding is in fact gone up, well, I'll read from 1991 to 1994-5,<br />
$ 149 million, $ 155 million, $ 136 million, $ 149 million, $ 153 million, so<br />
in the last year it has gone up from $ 149 million to $ 153 million. What<br />
has come out of it are the One Nation spending which I said to you a<br />
few moments ago, which we introduced in 1992 to give the economy a<br />
boost and then withdraw it. The blackspot program which was part of<br />
that as well, that is the black spots which are those parts of particular<br />
roads where we have a lot of traffic accidents and when we want to<br />
give the economy a bit of a kick along we spend money to try and<br />
move these things out and we have a program to try and take out the<br />
most dangerous. That program came to and end, but the base funding<br />
and as Kim Beazley may also have made clear, that in terms of the<br />
Grants Commission recommendation this is the money which is paid<br />
to the States by the Commonwealth led to the inclusion of road<br />
maintenance expenditure in its assessments, along with various road<br />
related charges. He said this in a letter to Richard Court. The<br />
Commissioner accordingly recommended positive adjustments to<br />
Western Australia by amounts in the order of $ 69 million in 1993/ 94<br />
and $ 72 million in 1994/ 95.<br />
So, in other words, Richard Court has bunged on a 4 cents per litre<br />
petrol tax by himself, for himself, for his budget.<br />
HS: Are you going to add on any more to your petrol tax take in the<br />
Budget?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not going to be talking..<br />
HS: Can't you talk about what you are not going to do in the Budget?<br />
PM: No, the government is not there is a Budget process and the Budget<br />
will be produced in May. The Cabinet has not met on the Budget or<br />
any of the core, main issues of the Budget, so I am not in a position to<br />
be saying yea or nay to anything.<br />
HS: Not even nay.<br />
PM: Because it is just not intelligent to say nay. I mean, people ask me for<br />
three months, I'd be saying yea, nay, yea, nay all around the place. </p>
<p>HS: All right now Mabo you know that's a big issue over here you would<br />
easily have gleaned that. Major projects, which I'm told by the<br />
Government here, have been held up by Native Title legislation<br />
include completion of the Ord River scheme, new hotels proposed for<br />
parts of the Kimberley, tourism projects in Broome no-one wants to<br />
invest until they know whether or not the Native Title claims are<br />
legitimate or not?<br />
PM: Well you know what's happened Richard Court's Government is the<br />
only Government in Australia not to sign up under Mabo. Now isn't it<br />
interesting he says this is all Canberra, and Keating and the Keating<br />
Government, but why did Jeff Kennett and John Fahey and Dean<br />
Brown and others introduce State Legislation to dove-tail in with the<br />
Commonwealth Native Title Act?<br />
HS: Maybe because it didn't affect them?<br />
PM: No. It does affect them. And the same with Queensland they have<br />
done it to provide certainty to investors. The lack of certainty comes<br />
from the wilful rebuttal of national interests which comes from the<br />
Western Australian legislation. But let me just tell you this Howard<br />
this is the serious part of it Richard Court has now issued 8000<br />
grants of interest in land over the last year, over which a large part of<br />
which may be unlawfully issued. That is, they have been issued<br />
ultravires of the Native Title Act. Now I wrote to him one year ago<br />
saying to him: " if you issue these grants of interest, be warned that you<br />
do it at your own expense at your own behest and at your own<br />
expense and that you will put the interests of the people you are<br />
giving these land grants to at risk". The prospect is, Howard, in this<br />
next year this coming financial year there will be another 8000. So,<br />
by the time the High Court hands down its' decision on the Western<br />
Australian challenge to the Commonwealth Mabo Act...<br />
HS: When will that be, by the way?<br />
PM: Probably in the next couple of months he'll have in the pipeline<br />
somewhere between 8000-16,000 grants of interest in land. Now,<br />
some of these are exploration licences 3000 of the 8000 are<br />
exploration licences and they are not actually title. But there is 5000<br />
titles there. Now not all of them, of course, will be over aboriginal land.<br />
But some substantial number will be, and...<br />
HS: What's going to happen?<br />
PM: Well the day it all goes sour on him, you will then be on your program<br />
saying to me " this is all the Commonwealth's fault". So I'm just telling<br />
you, there is a lot of villainy here on the part of the West Australian<br />
Government and a lot of wilful villainy, putting the interests of Western<br />
Australians and West Australian businesses at risk by granting interest </p>
<p>in land which is ultra vires of a Commonwealth Act of Parliament<br />
agreed to by every other state bar Western Australian.<br />
HS: But he would take some comfort from yesterdays decision of the Native<br />
Title Tribunal it ruled against a claim by the Waanyi people for 250<br />
hectares of land in North-West Queensland he would say that is the<br />
beginning of the end of the Commonwealth's case?<br />
PM: No. No it's not....<br />
HS: He would say that.<br />
PM: Yes, I know. But what he would say would be wrong. What that<br />
decision reveals is pretty much as we have been saying.. . we say in our<br />
Act. That is, where there has been a previous grant of interest in land<br />
that is, a freehold title, or even a pastoral lease that extinguishes<br />
the Native Title. Now, that is what the Native Title tribunal announced<br />
yesterday that there was some other interest granted over that land<br />
which extinguishes Native Title....<br />
HS: But they're now going to go to the High Court over it. I mean, what's<br />
the point of the Native Title Tribunal?<br />
PM: but there was always the question about whether pastoral leases<br />
extinguished Native Title. We have asserted this in the preamble to<br />
the Act, but no doubt, on the first decision which this thing is some<br />
interest group will take it to the high Court to have it cleared up once<br />
and for all.<br />
HS: But they might just keep doing it all the time. Every time they lose they<br />
go to the High Court? I thought...<br />
PM: No. Because there will always be a test case on some of the principles,<br />
and that will be that. And there is no point in going back twice<br />
because the High Court won't take the cases on. But that buttresses<br />
my side of the argument what I have said all the way through is, when<br />
he had the scare campaign " oh, we got all these pastoral leases, and<br />
those people will lose their pastoral leases", and we have said " no, no.<br />
Our presumption is that pastoral leases extinguish the native title".<br />
And what yesterday's decision does is buttress to Commonwealth the<br />
Labor Government's case. But what he is doing is something<br />
altogether different he is issuing, willy-nilly every week, grants every<br />
week grants of interest in land which are probably in the main,<br />
unlawfully issued.<br />
HS: All right, lets go to talkback you have got about 10 minutes left, so<br />
David is you first caller good morning David. The Prime Minister is<br />
here and he is listening to you. </p>
<p>C: Good morning Mr Keating.<br />
PM: How are you David?<br />
C: I'm just wondering there is a lot of emphasis placed on looking after<br />
the family in the Social Security safety nets I believe the forgotten<br />
people of the community are the single unemployed, and when you are<br />
talking about living off $ 145 per week, and after paying $ 110 for your<br />
weekly rent, you know, we're talking absurd living standards and I'm<br />
just wondering can the single unemployed please get a better deal, Mr<br />
Keating?<br />
PM; David, let me tell you, you are far from being forgotten. Last year we<br />
introduced the largest policy change in any western country with the<br />
White Paper on unemployment, called Working Nation. Working Nation<br />
is a job compact for those who are long-term unemployed. That is, the<br />
Commonwealth will give you work and a job subsidy, in return for an<br />
unemployed person taking it. That is for the long-term unemployed.<br />
For the shorter term unemployed, we are paying unemployment<br />
benefits, we are seeking to encourage people into training but as well<br />
as that, we are creating so many jobs. Since the election which is<br />
just 2 years ago next month we have 496,000 jobs in this country-just<br />
on half a million jobs in 2 years. And in Western Australia, the<br />
employment growth rate in the last year was 4.7% just under<br />
That is a huge number of jobs. So in terms of the commitments which<br />
the Government and I made in the last election that is, not to forget<br />
the unemployed, and to focus on the creation of jobs and to give<br />
people job security we had the largest fall in unemployment in this<br />
last calendar year ever recorded in Australia The<br />
unemployment rate came down from 10.7% to which was the<br />
biggest calendar year fall on record. So, we're finding the jobs, we're<br />
trying to train people to take jobs, and to give them labour market<br />
programs and work subsidies, and we're doing it for the long-term<br />
unemployed by giving them a compact you take the job, we'll give you<br />
the job and the job subsidy.<br />
HS: All right David, thanks for your call. Paul's next he wants to talk<br />
about the flag. Good morning Paul.<br />
C: Good morning Howard, good morning Mr Keating.<br />
PM: How are you, Paul?<br />
C: I'm a young person in a young country, and I respect the office of<br />
Prime Ministership, unfortunately you have lost my respect in one<br />
particular area, and that is being your public denigration of our<br />
symbols of history and tradition. I believe that in a young country such<br />
as ours, these should be given nothing less than the highest regard, </p>
<p>and the way that you have gone about things has been a particularly<br />
damaging form of vandalism.<br />
PM: You think you can't trust an Australian as our Head of State. You're a<br />
young Australian, but you are saying to me that you think we shouldn't<br />
have an Australian person as our Head of State? Is that right?<br />
C: That's my question and I'm sure Howard would be pleased maybe<br />
an answer could get us an answer would get us on the 6 o'clock news<br />
tonight. And that is will you give a firm guarantee here and now that<br />
nothing less than a constitutional referendum be held to invoke any<br />
change in the flag? It's quite simple....<br />
PM: Let me just make this point I know what is simple and what isn't, and<br />
let me make this clear to you. The flag is ancillary to the main point,<br />
and that is Australia's constitutional arrangements....<br />
HS: It's like the anthem, isn't it?<br />
PM: . that's right. It's a representational thing, but the core matter is<br />
should we be borrowing the monarch of another country not<br />
withstanding the respect which I hold the Queen in, which is<br />
substantial regard on a personal basis, and for the job she has done<br />
with this country over time. But as a young country as you have put it<br />
we can't engage Asia in particular and walk around truly representing<br />
ourselves while the Head of State of Australia is the Sovereign of<br />
Great Britain. Now, your view is a very conservative view for a young<br />
person...<br />
C: How are you going....<br />
PM: . and I think your the one out of step not me. I mean, I would be very<br />
surprised if your view is held I'm not surprised, I can tell you your<br />
view is a minority view among Australians.<br />
C: I asked the question I agree that you want to change how are you<br />
going to do it?<br />
PM: There is only one way to do it by constitutional referendum. A<br />
majority of electors in a majority of states. What we have said is let's<br />
have our., our objective is to Australia see Australia become a republic<br />
by the year 2000, let's have a national debate. I raised all this openly,<br />
publicly in a policy speech in the last election 2 years ago, we now<br />
have a national debate of substance it's being talked about all the<br />
time and at some point of time, the Government will put a referendum<br />
to the public, and it will need to be carried by a majority of electors in a<br />
majority of states. But let me tell you this, even the Western Australian<br />
Government has commissioned and this is Mr Court's Government </p>
<p>HS: The Constitutional Commission...<br />
PM: yes, the Constitutional Commission said there would be no problem<br />
in their view in terms of the federation if there was a change to an<br />
Australian republic.<br />
HS: But if there is a change in Government which you don't want to<br />
happen do you think we would get that referendum? If there is a<br />
change at the next election within the next 12 months will we still get<br />
the referendum?<br />
PM: Well I don't think there will be, and<br />
HS: I thought you would say that.<br />
PM: . and therefore, we will be putting... . continuing this debate.<br />
HS: All right. Trish Townsend is on the line, I believe she is with the Forest<br />
Protection Society yes Trish? Big issue for the Prime Minister, this.<br />
C: Yes indeed. Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: How are you Trish?<br />
C: All right. Look, just a word of thanks for your recent efforts to try and<br />
help resolve the crisis facing the timber industry, and the rural<br />
communities, in WA and elsewhere. Mr Keating, in your latest<br />
statement on this issue of woodchipping, you say that in the future,<br />
export woodchips forests can only come from forests that have been<br />
assessed by under a Regional Forest Agreement between the<br />
Commonwealth and the states. I just have two questions the first is<br />
are you aware that in Western Australia we already have such an<br />
agreement in the southern forest region, and that a joint assessment<br />
between the Australian heritage commission and the Department of<br />
CALM has already taken place? And secondly, most of the timber<br />
harvesting areas or logging coupes withdrawn by your Government<br />
for re-assessment have already been assessed under the joint<br />
agreement between CALM and the AFC, so will your Government as<br />
promised in writing by your Environment Minister, Senator John<br />
Faulkner, give full faith and credit to the agreement between CALM<br />
and the AFC, and allow access to those timber harvesting areas?<br />
PM: I think we continue to recognise the worth of CALM, but the<br />
assessments we're doing at the moment are wider, and includes<br />
national state values as well as others, and I think that is one of the<br />
issues which need to be taken into account. We remain committed to<br />
the National Forest Policy statement, and the commitments in the One<br />
Nation document, and I think the quicker we get to a system . for the </p>
<p>benefit of the listeners who don't understand all these terms, what we<br />
have had in the past is a compartment by compartment assessment of<br />
whether woodchips should be allowed from particular places. We<br />
have said the best way to run the forests is not to have a debate over<br />
an area of 150 square meters at a time, but lets have representative<br />
reserves of trees, of species, of forests, and then the balance of it can<br />
be logged. That's what the National Forest Policy Statement says, and<br />
we want to move to Regional Forest Agreements across the country<br />
with clear definitions which include national estate values as well as<br />
others, and when we have got that, we will have a sensible<br />
industry...... first of all we will do this: we'll have, I think, what most<br />
Australians want that is, the important stands of trees protected, the<br />
trees which have got heritage and national estate values will be<br />
protected, but at the same time we will have the basis for a sustainable<br />
timber industry, and not have this internecine battle over small<br />
compartments of trees every year under these annual licence<br />
renewals. Now that's where we're heading this is what I think will be<br />
the value coming from this debate, and it should have happened<br />
years ago.<br />
HS: Could it have been handled better?<br />
PM: It's about the issues there are smaller... we are seeing smaller and<br />
smaller reserves of pristine trees. The smaller it gets, the more the<br />
environment movement gets agitated about it, and the smaller it is the<br />
more the loggers want to basically take what's left. So, I believe that<br />
we are not a long way away from a plantation based and a regrowth<br />
forest based sustainable timber industry. But we have to protect the<br />
important stands of trees. Now part of the problem of this debate,<br />
Howard, has been that some people in the environment movement<br />
and some in the Wilderness Society have run around saying " there is<br />
1300 compartments or coupes which are pristine stands of trees, and<br />
the Commonwealth Government is not protecting them, and they're<br />
desecrating them" that is just not true.<br />
HS: Well some of them have already been logged?<br />
PM: Exactly. And that is why of that 1300 that some people in the<br />
Wilderness Society are going on about, probably less than 500 are<br />
important stands of trees, and others have been logged once or twice,<br />
or completely logged, in the last half a dozen or 10 years. So, while a<br />
lot of Australians conscientiously do want the Commonwealth... or they<br />
do want to see their forests protected, they have got to know that the<br />
lead for them will not always be coming from the Wilderness Societies<br />
of this world. It will only come from the people who want the balance<br />
between looking after the important trees, and maintaining the forest<br />
products industry which of course we should be well able to do. </p>
