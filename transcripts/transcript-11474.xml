<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p> The Prime Minister John Howard has signalled a major</p>
<p> shift in his government's approach to economic reform at the Liberal</p>
<p> Party's convention in Melbourne over the weekend. Instead of the</p>
<p> tough talk of rationalism it seems we'll now be hearing about the</p>
<p> human face of reform. The first tangible evidence of this is the $240</p>
<p> million family package announced at the weekend. The Prime Minister has</p>
<p> joined us in the AM Studio and he's speaking to Philip Williams in</p>
<p> Canberra.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> Good morning Prime Minister, first to the stock markets,</p>
<p> they're about to open and it looks like it's going to be blood</p>
<p> on the floor today. Are you worried about the effect on the Australian</p>
<p> economy?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Phil, I don't think, or Philip, I don't</p>
<p> think I should start speculating about what might happen on the stock</p>
<p> market I'll leave that to the participants and the stock market analysts.</p>
<p> What I can say, and I think it's important that I do say it, that</p>
<p> the fundamentals of the Australian economy are rock solid and the world</p>
<p> economy, looked at in a generic way is now stronger and has been growing</p>
<p> at a very powerful rate now for longer than at any time for the last twenty</p>
<p> of thirty years. The American economy is very strong, our economy is equally</p>
<p> as strong. There has been a rebound within the Asian economies, Europe</p>
<p> is getting better, Japan is showing signs of recovery so if you look at</p>
<p> the economic fundamentals, economic growth, inflation rates, interest</p>
<p> rates, all of those things, they're all very positive. As to what</p>
<p> happens on the stock market particularly in relation to tech stocks well</p>
<p> that's a matter for the participants, I don't think it's</p>
<p> appropriate for prime ministers to start making predictions about that.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> But as you say we've had a great run in economic</p>
<p> growth, are you concerned about the effects, the combined effects of interest</p>
<p> rate rises not here but in the United States and the inflation figures</p>
<p> in the United States flowing on and are you worried that there might possibly</p>
<p> have to be adjustments to the budget projections here in Australia?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I'm not going to get into to talk about the</p>
<p> Budget, it will be brought down on the 9th of May and that's</p>
<p> only three weeks tomorrow. But Philip the fundamentals are very strong.</p>
<p> Whilst I don't talk about future movements in interest rates I do</p>
<p> note that compared with four years ago the average home buyer in Australia</p>
<p> is $245 a month better off. You've had quarter after quarter after</p>
<p> quarter of strong economic growth. The latest IMF forecasts for both the</p>
<p> American economy, the other strong economies of the world and the Australian</p>
<p> economy is a very positive one so if you look around, you talk to private</p>
<p> sector economists, all of them remain quite positive about the Australian</p>
<p> economy. I don't get into quantitative predictions about the levels</p>
<p> of growth but the general direction is very strong and the best indicator,</p>
<p> the social indicator if you like of economic strength is job creation</p>
<p> and we've created 650,000 jobs or more over the last four years and</p>
<p> that is terrific news.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> Prime Minister talking about social things back to the</p>
<p> Liberal Convention. Why has it taken four years for your government to</p>
<p> try and explain why hard economics equals happy Australians in the end?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Philip I've said those sorts of things before,</p>
<p> perhaps I said them better at the weekend than I've said them before</p>
<p> but I've certainly said them before and I have never seen this disconnect</p>
<p> between economic achievement and social happiness, the two are inextricably</p>
<p> linked. If you don't have a social dividend or a social bonus out</p>
<p> of your economic policies you shouldn't follow them. We don't</p>
<p> change the economy, bring in economic policies for some kind of intellectual</p>
<p> gratification we do it because it satisfies human need and provides families</p>
<p> with jobs and provides poorer people with social welfare support and encourages</p>
<p> people to take risks which are for the long term health and benefit of</p>
<p> the economy.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> Is there a danger though that people will see this new</p>
<p> warmer, shall we say cuddlier approach as a cynical rebadging of the party</p>
<p> image ahead of the next election which clearly, or the election campaign</p>
<p> has started judging by the atmosphere at the convention?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Philip the warmth of 653,000 more jobs has been</p>
<p> there for a number of years, that's been building over the last four</p>
<p> years. The lower interest rates have been enjoyed progressively over the</p>
<p> last four years. The lower inflation, the increased choices through the</p>
<p> taxation system for Australian families, the benefits of a 30% tax rebate</p>
<p> for private health insurance. People are now flooding back into private</p>
<p> health insurance. Now that didn't start happening at the weekend</p>
<p> that's been happening now over a long period of time. But this idea</p>
<p> that we've suddenly decided to produce some social policies because</p>
<p> we think it's politically desirable to do so is wrong, we've</p>
<p> been producing these socially beneficial policies for four years.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> You haven't been explaining them though in the way</p>
<p> that you explained them on the weekend telling Australians that the rationalism</p>
<p> perhaps went a little too far, that it's all about creating human</p>
<p> happiness. I've never heard you talk like that.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Philip perhaps I explain things in a way I haven't</p>
<p> before. I don't walk away from that. If people think that well let</p>
<p> them think that. The important thing is what we've done. And we have</p>
<p> from the moment we were elected, we have been trying to create jobs, we've</p>
<p> been trying to help families and we've done so. And when you have</p>
<p> a strong economy you have more people in work, you have lower taxes, you're</p>
<p> able to help more needy families and we've been very courageous in</p>
<p> an area like the Job Network. We copped a lot of flak over that but the</p>
<p> Job Network is outperforming the old Commonwealth Employment services</p>
<p> by a long way. So this government has been working on the social dimension</p>
<p> if I can put it that way ever since it came to office. It perhaps...</p>
<p> it received a greater focus and was put in a more articulate fashion at</p>
<p> the weekend, well so be it but the important thing I say to your listeners</p>
<p> this morning is that we haven't discovered at the weekend for the</p>
<p> first time the importance of the social dimension, it's been there</p>
<p> from the beginning.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> OK, childcare. What are these changes all about? What</p>
<p> are you aiming to do?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well it's really to provide Philip more flexibility.</p>
<p> We make a very big provision for childcare and in the tax plan coming</p>
<p> in on the 1st of July there'll be more choices available</p>
<p> for Australian families because there'll be more benefits for people</p>
<p> who choose for one parent to be at home when a child is very young as</p>
<p> well as continued strong support for childcare. Now in addition to that</p>
<p> we're going to generate several thousand more places for people who</p>
<p> might be shift workers, they might be in remote regional areas, they might</p>
<p> have a sick child or the pattern of working which the parent or parents</p>
<p> are involved may be such that the current childcare options are simply</p>
<p> not suitable.</p>
<p>   WILLIAMS:Now this is in the home?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> In the home, yes. It's taking the carer to the home.</p>
<p> WILLIAMS:</p>
<p> Prime Minister thanks very much for your time.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> OK.</p>
