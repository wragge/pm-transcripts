GOVERNMENT MEMBERS' TASK FORCE ON TAXATION<br />
I have today appointed Senator Brian Gibson to chair a special Government Members' Task Force<br />
on Taxation.<br />
The Task Force has been established to assist in the process of public consultation on the<br />
Government's plans to reform and modernise the Australian taxation system for the 21st Century.<br />
The Task Force will take public submissions on ways to achieve a fairer, better, more modern tax<br />
system, Public submissions should address perceived deficiencies in the current taxation system<br />
and possible options for change.<br />
Those making public submissions should bear in mind the Government's view that:<br />
a. There should be no increase in the overall tax burden;,<br />
b. Any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with<br />
special regard for the taxation treatment of families;<br />
c. Consideration should be given to a broad based, indirect tax to replace some or all of the<br />
existing indirect taxes;<br />
d. There should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration, and<br />
e. Reform of Commonwealth/ State financial relations must be addressed.<br />
The Task Force will submit to the Governiment summaries of submissions later in the year. The<br />
fi~ l membership of the Task Force is:<br />
Senator Brian Gibson ( Chairman)<br />
Mr Larry Anthony MP'<br />
Mr Joe Hockey NIP<br />
Senator Sue Knowles<br />
