    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PM.  No.  73/1962</strong></p>
<p>AID FOR SCHOOLS</p>
<p>My attention has been drawn to published statements attributed to Bishop M. L, Loane at the 32nd Synod of The Church of England in Sydney yesterday.</p>
<p>I am concerned first with his claim that a fresh and direct approach has been made to the Commonwealth Parliament by members of the Catholic Church for aid to church schools.</p>
<p>No such approach has been made to me or, so far as I know, to any Minister or Member.</p>
<p>Bishop Loane's second assertion on which comment is necessary is that a Commonwealth White Paper on education, to be published soon, will claim that expenditure on education by the States is out of proportion and will propose reduction of the allocation to each State to create a fund for the support of independent schools. This assertion is false, without any shadow of foundation, irresponsible, and reckless.</p>
<p>I regret that a member of the hierarchy of the Church of England should give currency, as if they were facts, to baseless rumours.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />9th October, 1962,</p>
