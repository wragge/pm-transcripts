    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PM.Â Â No.Â Â 73/1962</strong></p>
<p>AID FOR SCHOOLS</p>
<p>My attention has been drawn to published statementsÂ attributed to Bishop M. L, Loane at the 32nd Synod of TheÂ Church of England in Sydney yesterday.</p>
<p>I am concerned first with his claim that a freshÂ and direct approach has been made to the CommonwealthÂ Parliament by members of the Catholic Church for aid toÂ church schools.</p>
<p>No such approach has been made to me or, so farÂ as I know, to any Minister or Member.</p>
<p>Bishop Loane's second assertion on which commentÂ is necessary is that a Commonwealth White Paper onÂ education, to be published soon, will claim that expenditureÂ on education by the States is out of proportion and willÂ propose reduction of the allocation to each State to createÂ a fund for the support of independent schools. ThisÂ assertion is false, without any shadow of foundation,Â irresponsible, and reckless.</p>
<p>I regret that a member of the hierarchy of theÂ Church of England should give currency, as if they wereÂ facts, to baseless rumours.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />9th October, 1962,</p>
