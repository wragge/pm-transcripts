ELECTORATE TALK<br />
International. trade is of great importance to the Australian<br />
economy. Indeed in 1980-81, the value of Australia's.<br />
international trade was equivalent to well over one third of<br />
our gross domestic product. With a population of only<br />
million pe! ople, Australia's domestic market is relhtively<br />
small. W6 nEed large and growing markets overseas to achieve<br />
the expansion of employment opportunities and of real<br />
living standards that trade makes possible. And during<br />
the 1950s and 1960s, when total world volume of exports<br />
grew at an average annual rate of 10%, our living standards*<br />
were greatly increased by the trading opportunities that then<br />
were made available.<br />
But, while the Australian economy has derived enormous benefit<br />
from overseas trade, if overseas economic conditions are poor,<br />
the Australian economy is bound to ' be affected, and the<br />
reality is that economic conditions and prospects in major<br />
economies overseas are not good. In recent months<br />
industrial production has fallen in 6 of the 7 largest<br />
western industrialised economies; total unemployment in<br />
the industrialised countries of Europe and North America is<br />
set to soon exceed 30 million people, and last year, for the<br />
first time in 6ver 20. years, the value of world trade actually<br />
fell. Moreover, under the stress created by prolonged<br />
recession, many governments have relaxed their resistance<br />
to pressures for increased protection for their domestic<br />
industries.<br />
This world wide economic crisis poses a real threat to<br />
Australia's Living standards, and it has already had a significant<br />
impact on a11 sectors of the Australian economy, on the<br />
mining industry, on agriculture and on manufacturing. We have<br />
shaped our domestic policies in response to the challenges<br />
posed by these * circumstances, and in the current world economic<br />
climate, Australia is by no means the worst affected country.<br />
But the longer the world recession continues, the longer<br />
protectionism persists and the further it spreads, the more<br />
Australia will be affected.<br />
Next weekend iii Versailles, the heads of government of seven<br />
major economiLes, the United States, Japan, West Germany, the<br />
United Kingdom, France, Italy and Cdnada, meet in an economic ./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
summit t6 discuss the nature of the current economi-c crisis,<br />
and to seek solutions to it. This is the background against which<br />
I undertook my recent visit overseas to the United States,<br />
Canada, Japan and South Korea.<br />
In discussions with the heads of government of these countries,<br />
three of whom will be at Versailles, I put the view that<br />
Australia's living standards, and those of the entire world<br />
are heavily dependent on the Summit producing actions not just<br />
words; what the world is looking for is a lead a demonstration<br />
of political resolve from the seven major economics,<br />
which between them account for well over half the output of the<br />
industrialised western world, and about half the world<br />
merchandise trade. All agreed that concrete action was needed<br />
to break out-af the circle of continuing reces; sion and stagnant<br />
world trade, axnd all agreed that protectionist policies<br />
constitute a central problem in achieving a break-through<br />
which will give a realistic and lasting prospe ct of economic<br />
recovery. I took to those leaders a concrete proposal dE'signed to -tackle<br />
these problems head-on. Specifically, I suggEsted that the<br />
participants at the Versailles Summit give a l. ead to the rest<br />
of the world by agreeing to: a halt on increases in<br />
protection in all forms; a commitment to the a~ bolition of<br />
export incentives and subsidies over a five year period; and<br />
significant and progressively implemeted3 reductions in all<br />
other forms of protection.<br />
This is not a package of measures which any country could implement<br />
alone: indeed it would not solve the problem for Australia<br />
or any other country to implement them in isolation. Nor<br />
may it be the only proposal for action that would get sustainable<br />
reco ery going, though to my knowledge it is the only concrete<br />
proposal thathas so far been put forward, and I have<br />
indicated that if this proposal or something like it were<br />
agreed to by the Summit participants, Australia would join<br />
them in implementing it.<br />
All the world leaders I met agreed with the general principles<br />
underlying the Australian proposal and acknowledged its<br />
particular relevance to the world's problems, and the broad<br />
thrust of the. proposals has received widespread support by leaders<br />
of international economic organisations.<br />
It would not be an overstatement to say that the participants<br />
in Versailles Summit carry an enormous burden of responsibility,<br />
not only to their own peopl. e, but to people throughout the<br />
world including Australians whose living standards depend<br />
vitally on the promotion of world growth and trade. The<br />
objective of getting world trade moving again is surely one<br />
which must be shared by all nations.<br />
