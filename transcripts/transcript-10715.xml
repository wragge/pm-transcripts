<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning John.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Breathing a sigh of relief this morning are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very pleased that we have an agreement. The whole country</p>
<p>   will be pleased.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>It seems that they are... there's a couple of notable exceptions</p>
<p>   which were pretty obvious, but it seems the majority are.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They're pleased because they see it as a fair and honourable</p>
<p>   compromise and nobody, and certainly not John Howard, wanted a double</p>
<p>   dissolution election campaign, indeed, any election campaign, where</p>
<p>   one of the central issues was an acrimonious debate about Native</p>
<p>   Title. Contrary to what my critics have said, I have never wanted</p>
<p>   to fight a double dissolution on this issue because I am sensitive</p>
<p>   to the heightened emotions that can arise on such matters but I</p>
<p>   wasn't prepared to compromise the interests for the rural community</p>
<p>   in particular in order to avoid that election.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Have you heard what Daryl Melham, the Labor spokesman on Aboriginal</p>
<p>   Affairs has said?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't really. What did he say? I'm sure it is</p>
<p>   not very complimentary.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well, it certainly isn't. I think it is disgraceful. But I'll</p>
<p>   play it to you. Listen to this:</p>
<p>What we now have is, is John Howard is fast becoming the Errol</p>
<p>   Flynn of Australian politicians. He stuffs everything he touchs.</p>
<p>   He stuffed nursing homes, he stuffed childcare and now he's</p>
<p>   stuffed Native Title. This is a quick fix, because he was in electoral</p>
<p>   trouble.</p>
<p>Is that any way for a man who is a member of Parliament to talk?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it isn't, and perhaps you ought to ask of his leader what</p>
<p>   he thinks of it. This is the man who accused members of the front</p>
<p>   bench of the Liberal Party of being members of the Ku Klux Klan</p>
<p>   and went unrebuked. But I dismissed that sort of response with the</p>
<p>   contempt it deserves. It is a problem for Mr Beazley, not for me.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is a problem for Australia if we have people of</p>
<p>   that calibre or lack of calibre making statements like about the</p>
<p>   Prime Minister. I mean, like you or dislike you, you are the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of what we all believe to be the greatest country in the</p>
<p>   world and I think a statement like that is outrageous and I will</p>
<p>   ask Kim Beazley if he intends to do anything about it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is an insulting statement to the Australian public.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, I believe it is. Well, as we said, it seems that almost everybody</p>
<p>   is happy. Noel Pearson is, well, he is cautiously happy. He gives</p>
<p>   all the credit or most of it to Senator Harradine. Does it matter</p>
<p>   who gets the credit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. What matters is whether it is a good outcome.</p>
<p>   And it is a good outcome because it treats all Australians equally.</p>
<p>   And the real gap between the Government and others last April was</p>
<p>   that the Senate wanted to give Aborigines rights that no other Australians</p>
<p>   had and that's what I wasn't prepared to accept and the</p>
<p>   compromise that I've reached with Brian Harradine means that</p>
<p>   that won't be the case, that pastoralists, farmers and Aborigines</p>
<p>   will be treated in exactly the same way because I believe that all</p>
<p>   Australians should be equal under the laws of Australia.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>John, you've spent a lot of time recently claiming that any</p>
<p>   further compromise on Wik would betray the bush, so how can you</p>
<p>   explain this as not being a betrayal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The only element of our original position that we have conceded</p>
<p>   is the sunset clause. The other changes that we have agreed to don't</p>
<p>   alter the thrust of what we were on about. And when you balance</p>
<p>   that against the totality of what has been achieved and the certainty</p>
<p>   it delivers, in net terms there's been no betrayal of the bush,</p>
<p>   in fact the bush has been magnificently looked after and once again</p>
<p>   the Liberal and National parties have demonstrated that they are</p>
<p>   the only two parties in Australia that when the push is on, will</p>
<p>   stick up for the bush, because it is for the farmers of Australia,</p>
<p>   more than any other section of the Australian community that I refused</p>
<p>   to accept the Senate bill in April. And it was for the farmers that</p>
<p>   I held ground and it was for the farmers that I insisted on an equality</p>
<p>   of treatment and I simply say to them, giving away that sunset clause</p>
<p>   which incidentally only related to the timing which you could get</p>
<p>   on the register, not bring a court action. Giving that away was</p>
<p>   a very small price to pay for the enormous security and protection</p>
<p>   that they now have.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I talked to Ross Lightfoot yesterday. He claimed he'd abstain</p>
<p>   from voting if the deal wasn't his State's approval. Have</p>
<p>   you got him all squared away?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he was advised, like every other member of the party of the</p>
<p>   arrangement and I'm confident this bill will pass through the</p>
<p>   Senate. I was very sensitive to the interests of Western Australia</p>
<p>   because over 80% of the land mass of Western Australia is subject</p>
<p>   to native title claims, and that state is more directly affected</p>
<p>   than any other state. Richard Court has expressed his support and</p>
<p>   I thank him for the constructive national interest approach that</p>
<p>   he adopted. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>How much did One Nation's success in Queensland change your</p>
<p>   thinking on Wik?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It didn't change my thinking on Wik at all. I was always of</p>
<p>   the view that the real sticking point was the right to negotiate.</p>
<p>   The question of whether you should give to the Aborigines a right</p>
<p>   that no other section of the community had. And when it became apparent</p>
<p>   to me after his approach that Senator Harradine would consider removing</p>
<p>   that special privilege from the Senate position, then I thought</p>
<p>   an understanding was possible, but I wasn't certain of it right</p>
<p>   until the end.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Did you think that Senator Harradine may have had an ulterior motive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you'd have to ask him that. I have found him as always</p>
<p>   to be honourable. I don't agree with him on everything and</p>
<p>   he doesn't agree with me on everything. After all he came out</p>
<p>   of the bosom of the Labor Party in his early years, but he is a</p>
<p>   man of intense commitment to fairness, and he is a person who is</p>
<p>   always honourable and decent to deal with and I like him a lot as</p>
<p>   a man, and it is in a sense, a pleasure ot negotiate with somebody</p>
<p>   who is motivated by what he thinks is high principle.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well, could I ask you then do you think perhaps One Nation's</p>
<p>   success in Queensland might have changed his thinking on Wik?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that, once again, is for him to say. He said that he was</p>
<p>   concerned about aspects of the outcome of the double dissolution,</p>
<p>   but I don't want to speak for Brian Harradine. He's able</p>
<p>   to do that himself. Our position was always that we didn't</p>
<p>   want a double dissolution for its own sake. There was never any</p>
<p>   mileage as such for us in a double dissolution, because almost by</p>
<p>   definition we would get fewer Senators in a double dissolution.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>There would have been less mileage however after the emergence</p>
<p>   of One Nation wouldn't there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, many people argued that.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>But do you accept that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it would depend on whether One Nation's support at the</p>
<p>   time of any hypothetical double dissolution was as high as what</p>
<p>   it was in Queensland and there's a lot of volatility in Australia's</p>
<p>   politics at the moment and look, I'd be the first to acknowledge</p>
<p>   that the polls in the last few weeks for us have been bad. I've</p>
<p>   told my partyroom that. I'm a realist. I also know that six</p>
<p>   weeks ago the polls had us at virtually the same position as we</p>
<p>   were at in 1996 and I know in my bones that there is a lot of volatility</p>
<p>   in politics particularly in the non-Labor vote.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I talked back there of One Nation's success in Queensland</p>
<p>   and I've just given thought to that statement. Is that a correct</p>
<p>   statement. Is it One Nation's success or is it the major parties'</p>
<p>   failure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess it is a bit of both. Once again, I'm a realist.</p>
<p>   23% of Queenslanders voted for One Nation. What I want to do is</p>
<p>   to say to those people that your concerns can best be addressed</p>
<p>   by the Coalition and it takes something like immigration, which</p>
<p>   is in the news, it was afterall the Coalition Government that brought</p>
<p>   in the two year waiting period for new migrants for welfare benefits.</p>
<p>   I think you and I talked about that a couple of years ago when it</p>
<p>   was announced.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>We certainly did and you collected a bit of flak for talking about</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed I did but I am sure it was right. And interestingly enough,</p>
<p>   the leader of One Nation didn't support that measure when it</p>
<p>   was put through the Parliament. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>We'll get to that immigration thing in a moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's another matter but, and of course the Labor Party opposed</p>
<p>   it as well.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>That's right. Well I'd like to just touch briefly on</p>
<p>   that immigration thing in a moment or two. Some would consider you</p>
<p>   to be most ungentlemanly by getting the Wik thing through yesterday</p>
<p>   and getting One Nation's immigration story on the back of the</p>
<p>   papers and not on the front.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It wasn't by design.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I know, probably not, but it worked very well didn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what worked well was that the....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The result. And everybody is happy because Australians are collectively</p>
<p>   very decent people, they want harmony in their country, although</p>
<p>   they want equality of treatment as well. If they can have both they</p>
<p>   are very happy and we have delivered that. We have got a situation</p>
<p>   where there won't be a divisive debate on native title in the</p>
<p>   middle of an election campaign but we haven't sacrificed the</p>
<p>   great principle of equality of all Australians under the law. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Okay, so the double dissolution election on the issue of race is</p>
<p>   off the agenda but an election is still on the agenda, One Nation</p>
<p>   is still on the agenda, tax reform is still on the agenda, the National</p>
<p>   Party's under threat from One Nation in the bush. It sounds</p>
<p>   to a lot of people like a fairly explosive sort of mixture, how</p>
<p>   are you going to handle all that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you deal with one thing at a time. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>There's a lot to deal with.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is, but there always is in politics particularly when you</p>
<p>   don't control both Houses and we are living in challenging</p>
<p>   economic times.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>And challenging political times.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And challenging political times. The electorate, John, now is less</p>
<p>   tribal in its political allegiance. There are fewer people rusted</p>
<p>   on to either side of politics and therefore you get more volatility.</p>
<p>   Nobody...you don't have that situation where you automatically</p>
<p>   vote as your mother and father did or you vote according to your</p>
<p>   job or you background or where you live. There's a lot less</p>
<p>   of that now therefore you get more volatility.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, so this would have weakened the Coalition surely, the emergence</p>
<p>   of One Nation that this volatility that exists, the polls would</p>
<p>   suggest so?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well One Nation has taken votes off the Coalition's base there</p>
<p>   is no doubt about that. It has taken some votes from Labor and in</p>
<p>   the process in Queensland, of course, I am sure against their wishes</p>
<p>   those One Nation voters have helped install a Labor Government.</p>
<p>   Now it's our job to ensure that that doesn't happen of</p>
<p>   course Federally. I don't underestimate the challenge. We understand</p>
<p>   the concerns of One Nation voters, we agree with a lot of them.</p>
<p>   We certainly don't agree with the overtones of defining people</p>
<p>   according to their race which are part of the utterances of One</p>
<p>   Nation leaders. But where there are concerns our argument to the</p>
<p>   One Nation supporters is that we understand those concerns and we</p>
<p>   have acted upon many of them.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Are you surprised at the immigration policy? I doubt you are?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not the least bit surprised. Bear in mind that we have</p>
<p>   heavily cut the migrant intake. One of the weaknesses of this new</p>
<p>   policy is, as I understand it, is that is seems to be tipping the</p>
<p>   balance back away from skilled migration in favour of family reunion</p>
<p>   within the reduced numbers and that seems very strange. That is</p>
<p>   how I heard it explained yesterday.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>On....well on the face of it to a lot of people zero net migration</p>
<p>   as it's called might seem attractive to people who believe</p>
<p>   that high levels of unemployment are being pushed up by immigration.</p>
<p>   What effect would the One Nation policy have on this country if</p>
<p>   they were allowed to exercise it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one of the weaknesses of it is that it reduces the emphasis</p>
<p>   on skilled migration and whatever views you have about the aggregate</p>
<p>   number, there's a general view, I think, quite sensibly, that</p>
<p>   skilled....if you are going to have migrants, skilled migration</p>
<p>   should make up a larger proportion or a bigger proportion than family</p>
<p>   reunion. And, of course, the English language issue....now we have</p>
<p>   already introduced a bias in favour of English language skills but</p>
<p>   if you go to the extreme that One Nation's gone to you would</p>
<p>   be denying to this country people like Arvi Parbo, perhaps the late</p>
<p>   Victor Chang - two people I can think of. Four or five members of</p>
<p>   the Federal Coalition in Parliament came to this country without</p>
<p>   being able to speak a word of English. I mean we have quite a number</p>
<p>   in our ranks who came here from Europe as young children without</p>
<p>   being able to speak English. Alex Somlyay who was born in Budapest</p>
<p>   in Hungary and who is my Minister for Regional Development and who</p>
<p>   grew up in Blacktown in Sydney. He came to this country as a small</p>
<p>   boy not being able to speak English. Now are we really saying that</p>
<p>   we are so frightened and narrow that we won't ever allow somebody</p>
<p>   into this country who has to learn English after he or she has come</p>
<p>   here? Now that is going, in my opinion, that is going too far.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Can you understand that there will be people who will consider</p>
<p>   that to be a good idea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I do and I would say to those people: I understand your desire</p>
<p>   to ensure that there is a universal understanding and use of the</p>
<p>   English language within Australia. Of course I understand that and</p>
<p>   of course it is one of the great unifying things about being an</p>
<p>   Australian that we all speak the common language of English. But</p>
<p>   to say that we don't ever want in the future to have somebody</p>
<p>   come to Australia, no matter what their potential contribution,</p>
<p>   who has to learn English after they have come to this country, I</p>
<p>   think is narrow. And on the example I quote, I mean Arvi Parbo ended</p>
<p>   up the Chairman of BHP....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Oh yes there are plenty of them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And he came here without being able to speak a word of English,</p>
<p>   he was born in Estonia. Now, I mean we can't possibly be saying</p>
<p>   to ourselves and to the world we are too frightened and too narrow</p>
<p>   to have people like that. I think that is too backward looking.</p>
<p>   It's too insular. It speaks of a diminished and frightened</p>
<p>   mentality rather than one that wants to share the benefits of this</p>
<p>   country with others. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>There's very little doubt that a lot of figures in One Nation,</p>
<p>   there was 18 pages of this immigration policy, but a lot of the</p>
<p>   figures are absolutely wrong and you can blow holes to them everywhere</p>
<p>   but there is a risk that a lot of people will excuse that as a minor</p>
<p>   detail because people tend to put things aside if the main thrust</p>
<p>   is what they want to hear. I mean the basic, simplistic and populist</p>
<p>   line they push is an answer to the economic and social problems</p>
<p>   that we are facing could draw a lot of people. Do you understand</p>
<p>   that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, I do understand that and my response is to patiently, and</p>
<p>   I hope effectively point out the flaws in the simplistic approach</p>
<p>   and you do it by dealing with facts. You don't think you can</p>
<p>   deal with it by simply making a sweeping statement that's going</p>
<p>   to crush all the credibility out of these alternative statements.</p>
<p>   You have got to take each fact, analyse it and point out what's</p>
<p>   wrong.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Does One Nation lack credibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Many of its policies lack complete credibility. Look...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Does Pauline Hanson lack credibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I'm not going to get into personal observations</p>
<p>   on her or any members of her party. I will talk about their policies</p>
<p>   and the attitudes that they have struck and the way they conduct</p>
<p>   them.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You personally observed her the other day in Parliament in what</p>
<p>   I thought was a rather quaint way, in a kind of fatherly fashion</p>
<p>   calling her Pauline and treating her like she was a little girl.</p>
<p>   I didn't quite understand that and that was personal.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it wasn't personal in the sense that I was wishing to</p>
<p>   be offensive to her. I was perhaps drawing on the fact that a lot</p>
<p>   of people don't like too many exchanges of a personal kind</p>
<p>   between members of Parliament.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She was sort of interrupting me. But look, put that aside. Everybody</p>
<p>   reacts in different ways in different circumstances.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The general thrust of what I'm saying is that the best response</p>
<p>   that I have and the one I know best and I believe best suits the</p>
<p>   people of Australia is to look at what is being said, analyse it,</p>
<p>   and where it is wrong point out where it is wrong. And, but most</p>
<p>   importantly to remind her supporters, One Nation supporters, that</p>
<p>   many of the concerns they have I identify with and we have in fact</p>
<p>   acted on them. I mentioned a moment ago the two year waiting period</p>
<p>   from migrants getting welfare benefits. Now that was a policy of</p>
<p>   ours in the last election campaign. It was opposed by the Labor</p>
<p>   Party, it was ridiculed by many. When it came for a vote in the</p>
<p>   House of Representatives, Mrs Hanson did not turn up and support</p>
<p>   it which must seem very strange to many of her supporters. I mean</p>
<p>   here was a practical opportunity for her to demonstrate....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>And she didn't arrive.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....and she didn't arrive. Now in a sense it was supported</p>
<p>   by neither the Labor Party nor by One Nation. It's the same</p>
<p>   with tax reform. They are both opposed to tax reform together. They</p>
<p>   want us to hang to our present unfair tax system. So my intention</p>
<p>   is to deal with the merits of the alternative policies of One Nation</p>
<p>   and also to say to One Nation supporters, where your concerns are</p>
<p>   our concerns we will identify that and we'll point to what</p>
<p>   we have done to address them but equally where we think One Nation</p>
<p>   is wrong we'll say so.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I was talking at length to Tony Abbott the other day who was very</p>
<p>   keen to talk I must say. He was in some sort of committee meeting</p>
<p>   but he came out to talk to me about Pauline Hanson and in particular</p>
<p>   David Oldfield. Has Tony been given the job of sniping at One Nation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I haven't given him any particular mission, no, not at</p>
<p>   all. But Tony feels strongly about it,...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...and he's very articulate,....</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...and engaging.</p>
<p>LAWS: </p>
<p>Yes, well he referred to them as the ÂTarzan and Jane'</p>
<p>   of politics.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He has a capacity for colourful phrases.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
