PRIME MNISTER<br />

The Prime Minister has sent the attached letter to<br />
Mr. J. Brunt of the Australian Meat Industry<br />
Employees Union, Portland. 000---</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER C ANBSERRA<br />
Dear Mr. Brunt, I wish to confirm that I am prepared to have<br />
arranged a meeting of all parties involved in the live<br />
sheep export industry to examine in depth the problems<br />
you have raised with me. This meeting would involve the<br />
Minister for Primary Industry and the Minister for<br />
Industrial Relations, representatives of the farmers and<br />
the exporters, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and<br />
the Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union.<br />
I have approached both the Ministers and can<br />
confirm that they are willing to take part in the meeting,<br />
provided the conditions laid down at our meeting are agreed<br />
to. These were:<br />
* there would be no picketing of vessels loading live<br />
sheep prior to the meeting;<br />
* any bans and limitations imposed by the AMIEU in relation'<br />
to the export of live sheep are to be lifted, including<br />
those aimed at stock transport operators who were<br />
involved in the transport of sheep to vessels involved<br />
in the trade.<br />
Provided that your members are agreeable to these<br />
conditions, Mr. Street will convene-the meeting within the<br />
next four weeks.<br />
I appreciate your concern for your members and<br />
that you wish to have the issues discussed meangih'gfully by<br />
those involved in the live sheep trade, The proposed meeting<br />
will certainly enable such discussions * to take place. Your<br />
support and the co-operation of your union membership is<br />
essential if such a meeting is to be convened.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Malcolm Fraser). </p>
