PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW POST-BUDGET DINNER<br />
SYDNEY 16 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
Alan Kohler<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The Budget which Paul Keating delivered last night on behalf<br />
of the Government was the culmination of five years of hard<br />
work; five years of assiduous reordering of spending<br />
priorities; five years of cutting out waste and<br />
inefficiency; five years of tax reform.<br />
The Budget is another step down the path we have followed in<br />
our economic policy making since we were first elected in<br />
1983. This path leads towards an economy which is more<br />
competitive, productive and efficient and a society which is<br />
more compassionate and equitable.<br />
Since our re-election in July to a third term in office we<br />
have worked to maintain our momentum towards those goals.<br />
We have taken decisive action towards creating a leaner,<br />
more efficient public service.<br />
We have initiated an important debate on the role of the<br />
public sector.<br />
The most immediate task, however, has been to complete the<br />
formjplation of the 1987-88 Budget.<br />
It completes the three stage process begun with the May<br />
Statement and the Premiers' Conference.<br />
Most of the early attention of commentators has focussed on<br />
the stark outlines of the Budget:<br />
the fact that we have now eliminated the Budget deficit;<br />
the fact that we have cut real outlays for the second<br />
year in a row the first time that this has occurred in<br />
years; 001100 </p>
<p>the fact that tax will be a significantly lower<br />
proportion of GDP this year than last;<br />
the fact that our decisions on recurrent outlays will<br />
produce cuts next year which are at least as large as<br />
this year;<br />
the fact that for the first time in 35 years the<br />
Commonwealth will be retiring both overseas debt and<br />
domestic Treasury bonds a total in each case of $ 1<br />
billion; the fact that, based on the groundwork laid over five<br />
years to repair the revenue base and pare back<br />
Government spending, we have been able to deliver an<br />
economically responsible Budget without new or increased<br />
taxes, without major further spending cuts but with the<br />
major weTlfare initiatives promised in the electlon<br />
campaign.<br />
Those are remarkable achievements, ones which deserve the<br />
accolades accorded them by commentators and the financial<br />
markets. But tonight I want to comment on the contribution the Budget<br />
makes to our longer term task of economic reconstruction, an<br />
aspect which can too easily become lost in the initial<br />
post-Budget euphoria.<br />
The first, and most obvious, point to be made is that we<br />
have again created the necessary fiscal environment an<br />
environment which will permit interest rates to decline<br />
without leading to an excessive expansion of domestic<br />
demand. The point of our strategy is to secure steady improvement in<br />
our balance of payments while progressively shifting the<br />
policy mix towards fiscal policy.<br />
There should be no suggestion that this task be put at risk<br />
by an inappropriate easing of monetary policy.<br />
We have consistently worked to reduce the public sector's<br />
call on the available savings which will in turn reduce<br />
the need to borrow abroad.<br />
However, we have quite deliberately rejected the extremist's<br />
solution of seeking to make all of the adjustment required<br />
in one or two years.<br />
Too rapid a fiscal contraction would have risked putting the<br />
economy into a deep recession.<br />
Labor could not accept the associated blow out in<br />
unemployment nor, I believe, would the Australian people.<br />
But, just as importantly, a deep or prolonged recession<br />
would not assist longer term economic reconstruction. 001101<br />
I -4 </p>
<p>3<br />
The reasons are compelling.<br />
First, too sharp a contraction of economic activity would<br />
undermine the business confidence and thus the investment<br />
needed to give effect to the industrial reconstruction which<br />
Australia requires.<br />
Second, too sharp a contraction would undermine the<br />
community support which is essential in changing attitudes<br />
and workplace practices as part of that reconstruction.<br />
So we sought to strike the balance: moderating domestic<br />
demand to reduce the current account deficit in the short<br />
term, while also securing longer term adjustment.<br />
of course, in the end, contraction in demand cannot be<br />
relied upon to produce permanent reductions in the current<br />
account deficit. That can only be achieved if the economy<br />
is restructured to boost investment in the tradeable goods<br />
sector. However I do not have to argue this analysis in a vacuum.<br />
The ultimate test of the Government's strategy is<br />
performance and the indicators to date are very encouraging.<br />
interest rates have declined substantially since their<br />
peak in mid 1986<br />
and last night's announcement by the ANZ Bank that<br />
it will cut its mortgage rate by 0.75 per cent and<br />
its prime rate by 1 per cent is further<br />
confirmation of the trend<br />
westpac and the Commonwealth have since matched the<br />
new rates.<br />
investment has begun to pick up, especially in those<br />
areas most relevant to boosting exports of manufactures<br />
and services the latest survey of manufacturing investment<br />
intentions by the Metal Trades Industry Association<br />
shows a 15 per cent real increase in plant and<br />
equipment investment in the year ahead.<br />
while the Budget papers forecast a real increase in<br />
business investment overall of 5 per cent<br />
the whole of economic growth in 1986-87, and a<br />
substantial element of expected growth next year, is<br />
attributable to net exports<br />
exports have picked up strongly and real imports have<br />
fallen, reflecting both modest domestic demand growth<br />
and the improved competitiveness of our manufacturing<br />
and service sectors 0011[ 02 </p>
<p>most importantly, about half of our export growth last<br />
year came from the manufacturing sector and the MTIA<br />
survey shows a-growing awareness of export markets by<br />
that sector.<br />
The current account deficit has declined from 6 per cent of<br />
GDP in 1985-86, to 5 per cent last year and we expect a<br />
further fall to 4 per cent in 1987-88.<br />
But it is necessary to look beyond those figures to assess<br />
the real extent of adjustment which has occurred.<br />
in 1984-85 Australia had a goods and services deficit,<br />
in constant prices, of 2.6 per cent of GDP. Last year we<br />
turned that to a surplus amounting to 2.4 per cent of GDP.<br />
The forecast in 1987-88 is for a surplus of 4 per cent.<br />
In other words, in three years, our position has improved by<br />
some 6 per cent of GDP.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Let me turn to a number of specific areas of importance.<br />
The Government in its third term is increasingly turning its<br />
focus to micro-economic efficiency improvements.<br />
I want to refer to three of them today: education and<br />
training, taxation reform, and the role of the public.<br />
sector. In successive Budgets, beginning in 1985-86 we have<br />
virtually eliminated the financial incentive that existed to<br />
leave school by abolishing the dole for 16 and 17 year olds.<br />
School retention rates have risen from 36 per cent in 1983<br />
to over 50 per cent, this year. Our objective is to boost<br />
the proportion of students completing secondary education to<br />
per cent by the first half of the next decade.<br />
In the May Statement we announced new measures designed to<br />
help young people stay at school or in training rather than<br />
go on the dole.<br />
Our strategy aims to help young people get proper training<br />
and more fulfilling work not only to open up their life<br />
opportunities but also to develop a more skilled, more<br />
flexible labour force. To that end this Budget foreshadows<br />
far-reaching reform of the vocational education and training<br />
systems to make them more responsive to evolving economic<br />
conditions and to requirements for new skills.<br />
we have in mind a medium-term strategy which will aim to:<br />
increase the community's effort both in terms of quantity<br />
and quality of training; promote greater industry<br />
involvement in and relevance to that effort; and expand<br />
training and retraining opportunities for the unemployed. 0011". I </p>
<p>These objectives will not be achieved quickly or easily.<br />
Nevertheless, the creation of a single Employment, Education<br />
and Training portfolio was a crucial first step.<br />
The Budget paper on Skills Formation published last night by<br />
John Dawkins, the Minister for Employment, Education and<br />
Training, clearly indicates the direction of the<br />
Government's strategy. I commend this document to you for<br />
close study.<br />
The strategy it outlines will be refined in consultation<br />
with interested parties but the main elements are clear.<br />
The arrangements whereby Commonwealth funding is provided to<br />
TAFEs is to be reformed to achieve greater flexibility and<br />
better value for money.<br />
Priority in TAFE funding will be given to meeting skill<br />
shortages in areas of importance to future economic<br />
development, such as computing, tourism and hospitality,<br />
while at the same time maintaining the Government's<br />
commitment to improving the economic position of those<br />
disadvantaged in the labour market.<br />
The Budget honours our commitment in the May Statement to<br />
upgrade substantially our funding for training programs and<br />
to make training systems more responsive.<br />
In particular a new Youth Training program is to be<br />
introduced, assisting 13,000 young people in 1987-88 at a<br />
cost of $ 30.7 million, with a further significant expansion<br />
planned for 1988-89.<br />
Apprenticeship training is also to become more broadly based<br />
and multi-skilled in character, with more emphasis on<br />
acquiring competence and on continuous skills development.<br />
States and unions each have a special responsibility to<br />
promote long overdue change. But the business sector, too,<br />
needs to recognise the importance of the national training<br />
effort and to be prepared to play its part.<br />
Adequate priority has to be given to training and retraining<br />
within the business environment and also to assisting the<br />
development of courses and innovative and relevant training<br />
methods.<br />
with this in mind, the Government will be examining a range<br />
of measures to encourage an increased industry contribution<br />
to the national training effort.<br />
In taxation, this Budget completes the most far reaching<br />
reform ever attempted in this country. We have already<br />
introduced dividend imputation, cut personal tax rates<br />
substantially and restored fairness to the tax system by<br />
ensuring that all forms of income bear reasonable tax. 001104 </p>
<p>6<br />
we are now ready to look more closely at company tax.<br />
Business tax rates in some of the major economies are being<br />
reduced, funded in large part by the removal of business tax<br />
shelters. The Budget contains the commitment to review the<br />
business tax system in Australia to see what more can be<br />
done to eliminate any competitive disadvantage which<br />
Australian companies may be suffering.<br />
As promised in the election campaign, the Budget does not<br />
contain new or increased taxes on the national level. Tax<br />
revenue as a percentage of GDP is lower this year than last<br />
year reflecting in part the full year effect on PAYE<br />
receipts of the two tax cuts.<br />
For current tax rates to be maintained or lowered we must<br />
ensure that every possible dollar owing from the existing<br />
tax base is collected. The Commissioner of Taxation has the<br />
Government's full support in achieving such an outcome. He<br />
has been provided with the staffing, the equipment and the<br />
laws to discharge his tasks.<br />
Honest taxpayers, both corporate and individuals, should<br />
support these efforts. I am therefore somewhat bemused by<br />
the attitude of some in business and the accounting<br />
profession towards the Commissioner's proposals on audits of<br />
large companies.<br />
To argue, as some have done, that tax audits should be<br />
totally random is to suggest that the Tax Office should<br />
apply methods that no business would ever consider applying<br />
to its own operations.<br />
Reduced interest rates flowing from a balanced budget should<br />
provide a major stimulus to both business investment and<br />
housing construction.<br />
Clearly this Budget will bring the prospect of home<br />
ownership more easily within the reach of young families.<br />
First home buyers will obviously'benefit from lower mortgage<br />
rates. In addition the Budget increased income limits for<br />
applicants to the First Home Owners Scheme with dependent<br />
children. Renters also gain substantially from the Budget. Lower<br />
interest rates, restoration of negative gearing, and<br />
retention of a still generous depreciation allowance should<br />
combine to provide a powerful boost to the supply of rental<br />
accommodation, thus pushing rents down in real terms over<br />
time. Moreover, the Budget provides low income families renting in<br />
the private market with extra direct assistance of up to<br />
per week. This complements the new Family Allowance<br />
Supplement, the most far reaching social reform in memory. 001105 </p>
<p>7<br />
I take particular pride in this new scheme in this Budget,<br />
as it demonstrates once more our capacity to protect and<br />
enhance the welfare of the least well-off members of the<br />
community while also delivering a responsible balanced<br />
budget. On a related matter, no Government which has struggled so<br />
long and so successfully with the budget deficit, as we have<br />
done, could afford not to implement the Australia Card.<br />
None of the critics of the Australia Card has effectively<br />
questioned the estimate that it could raise nearly $ 1<br />
billion of extra revenue.<br />
And no Government which has taken such pains to ensure that<br />
reductions in Government spending do not unfairly hurt the<br />
interests of the least well off in the community, as we have<br />
done, could refuse to raise that revenue from those who are<br />
not paying their way in the community the tax cheats and<br />
the welfare frauds.<br />
The critics of the card have made it all too clear that they<br />
believe they hold the high moral ground in this debate,<br />
while we are said to be motivated by allegedly base<br />
considerations of revenue raising.<br />
I certainly do not underestimate the material benefits of<br />
the Card. Nearly one billion dollars in extra revenue will<br />
substantially improve the Government's ability to provide<br />
better services to the whole community.<br />
But increased fairness is a desirable goal in itself.<br />
Nor should we underestimate the value of the increased<br />
confidence in the integrity of the tax and welfare systems<br />
that the majority of Australians will have as a result of<br />
the introduction of the Australia Card.<br />
I cannot leave unchallenged the comment on this subject by<br />
the Financial Review itself in an editorial on 28 August.<br />
Your editorials are normally a highly respected voice. This<br />
was a regrettably ill-informed exception, with its colourful<br />
but utterly wrong references to " the machinery of<br />
totalitarianism" and " authoritiarian impositions". The<br />
editorial claimed that the Government was seeking to<br />
" improve the scope and depth of security surveillance over<br />
the Australian nation"<br />
None of that language validly applies to the Australia Card<br />
or to this Government. It is a blatant nonsense.<br />
I recognise and respect the legitimate concern of some of<br />
the Card's critics that civil liberties not be eroded. 0 01106<br />
I </p>
<p>The extensive provisions in the Australia Card Bill designed<br />
to protect the privacy of individuals should have dispelled<br />
those fears. My Ministers and I have made it clear that we<br />
are prepared to amend the legislation where necessary to<br />
strengthen these provisions further.<br />
Your editorial did not acknowledge the facts clearly set<br />
out in the legislation that it would be a serious offence<br />
for police to require production of the Card.<br />
You did not recognise that sophisticated security software<br />
will be in place to prevent unauthorised access to the Card<br />
register and that no other computers will be linked to the<br />
register.<br />
You failed to mention the Data Protection Agency, which is<br />
to be set up as an independent watchdog body with a sweeping<br />
mandate to protect privacy in the Australia Card program.<br />
In short you have done yourself and your readers a<br />
* disservice by providing an incomplete, and indeed fanciful,<br />
commentary on the Card.<br />
I referred earlier to the debate I have initiated on the<br />
role of the public sector.<br />
In May we announced our intention to sell, by open tender,<br />
long term leases on Commonwealth owned international<br />
aviation terminals.<br />
We have reviewed that decision and concluded that extensive<br />
regulations would be needed to prevent exploitation of a<br />
monopoly regulation so extensive, indeed, that the<br />
disadvantages of sale outweighed the advantages.<br />
Accordingly we have decided not to proceed with the sale<br />
because it has failed the second of the two tests which I<br />
have set.<br />
We are confident nevertheless of raising the $ 1 billion from<br />
asset sales estimated in the May Statement. In addition to<br />
the sales already announced we have decided to sell the<br />
Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Limited.<br />
On the basis of the two tests, public ownership of CACS is<br />
not necessary to ensure that its functions continue to be<br />
performed. Moreover the advantages of sale outweigh the<br />
disadvantages. We therefore intend to sell the<br />
Commonwealth's 100 per cent interest.<br />
This Budget also provides examples of where the Government<br />
has sought to boost public sector efficiency, while<br />
retaining public ownership.<br />
Government departments will now generally have a choice<br />
whether they obtain transport and storage services from the<br />
Department of Administrative Services or direct from<br />
alternative private sector suppliers. The Department's<br />
charging will be required to met all costs, including a<br />
return on capital. 0 1.107 </p>
<p>Just two months on, implementation of the new administrative<br />
arrangements is proceeding well. Although the primary<br />
imperative behind the changes is efficiency and the better<br />
delivery of government services, there will be substantial<br />
savings in staffing and running costs. In a full year<br />
savings will involve about 3000 staff years and $ 100<br />
million. Public staff numbers peaked in 1985-86, fell in 1986-87 and<br />
are expected to fall slightly further in 1987-88. We expect<br />
the underlying downward trend to continue into 1988-89 and<br />
be further intensified through 1989-90 as the full effect of<br />
the Government's efficiency dividend, administrative<br />
arrangements and other savings measures take effect.<br />
In closing, I ask you to contemplate how different last<br />
night's budget could have been if in Paul Keating's place<br />
stood Jim Carlton or whoever else would have served as<br />
Treasurer in a Howard government.<br />
We would not be looking at a balanced budget, a stable<br />
dollar, declining interest rates, or further export growth<br />
as part of the essential strategy of reconstruction.<br />
For the Liberals' tax policy which John Howard has<br />
reaffirmed since the election gave priority to tax cuts<br />
ahead of deficit reduction. In addition they would have<br />
eliminated the very base broadening measures, most notably<br />
Capital Gains Tax and Fringe Benefits Tax, which have<br />
contributed $ 2 billion to revenue this year.<br />
This would have threatened the dollar, and ensured high and<br />
higher interest rates for Australia's home buyers.<br />
It is hard to see how such a result could have pleased the<br />
Liberal Party's Treasurer, John Elliott, for example.<br />
Mr Elliott was interviewed yesterday morning on where<br />
he said " a balanced budget will be regarded by the business<br />
community as a good step from the Government".<br />
He also called for reductions in corporate taxes a matter<br />
which, as I have said, we have under active review.<br />
It remains to be seen whether Mr Elliott recognises these<br />
achievements or, as is more likely, he continues the removal<br />
off-shore of his investments away from what he called " one<br />
of the worst managed economies in the Western world".<br />
I am sure you recall the famous confusion among the<br />
conservative parties about whether tax cuts would be first<br />
cab off the rank or third behind deficit reduction and<br />
redistribution of the tax burden. 1 108 </p>
<p>I only need point out that my Government has in fact sent<br />
all three cabs off the rank. We have reduced the deficit to<br />
near zero; we have progressively redistributed the tax<br />
burden through means such as the capital gains and fringe<br />
benefits taxes and the assets test; and we have lowered the<br />
top rate of personal income tax from the level John Howard<br />
left as Treasurer of 60 cents in the dollar to 49.<br />
In summarising the budget, I would say: We have delivered.<br />
We have delivered in full measure on our election<br />
commitments.<br />
We have delivered consistently now, over five budgets<br />
the right mix of policies to restore economic health.<br />
There has been no deviation from the clearly established and<br />
clearly successful course we have steered since 1983 and<br />
there has been no deception in setting that course or in<br />
explaining its difficulties to the Australian people.<br />
We have delivered a balanced budget, which will remove the<br />
Commonwealth as a net borrower from financial markets.<br />
We have delivered lower interest rates and we are delivering<br />
lower inflation.<br />
We are delivering new jobs by the hundreds of thousands<br />
and by the end of 1988 we will have delivered one million<br />
new jobs since we came to office.<br />
We have delivered on our election promise to introduce a new<br />
and generous source of assistance to the least well-off<br />
families in our community.<br />
We have worked at what's right and what's necessary, and we<br />
have taken the long perspective, and that is the only way to<br />
manage the economy.<br />
All Australians are reaping the rewards. 0 0UI 0<br />
