PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS PM. No. 106/ 172<br />
MORAL ISSUES IN THE ELECTION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
Williar. _ IcMFahon, C. H. M. P.<br />
During the election campaign questions have been asked<br />
about the attitude of the principal parties on some of the moral<br />
issues of the day. There are fundamental differences between the<br />
Government and the Labor Party on a number of them.<br />
What stand should a Government take on such issues?<br />
Let me state my belief a belief which is implicit in our policies.<br />
In a free society it is customary to regard the private<br />
morals of an individual as a matter for his own conscience.<br />
However, when such moral actions impinge upon others and are likely<br />
to have adverse social effects, particularly if they are likely to<br />
corrupt the young, then it is the duty of Governments in democratic<br />
countries to intervene to protect the rights of others. With this<br />
principle, I fully agree.<br />
Abortion is a case in point. It is clear, of course,<br />
that under certain conditions there is justification for therapeutic<br />
abortion. The law should and does provide for this.<br />
But my Government does not believe in abortion on demand.<br />
I confirm the statements I have made before that we will not amend<br />
the law relating to abortion.<br />
My Government would apply the same principles to drugs,<br />
whether " soft" or hard drugs. While we recognise that drug addicts<br />
need and should get first-class medical attention, we would not, as<br />
some Labor Party members urge, remove the penalties for drug-taking,<br />
including marihuana. Medical science cannot exonerate marihuana from serious<br />
physiological and psychological effects, including possible genetic<br />
damage. In such circumstances, to give de facto legality to it by<br />
removing penalties would be reckless irresponsibility.<br />
Similarly, a Government has a responsibility to the<br />
community on censorship, particularly in the protection of the<br />
young. A Government should not be heavy handed or paternalistic.<br />
It should try to reflect the ethical standards and voluntary<br />
restraints of the community. This, we try to do. / 2 </p>
<p>.4 -2<br />
We reject the argument by some Labor members that<br />
all censorship should be removed, except on cinema advertising.<br />
In our view, the Australian people expect us to act on hard-core<br />
pornography and we will continue to do so.<br />
Mr. Whitlam. has stated his views on abortion and his<br />
intentions towards influencing his Party's policy on this matter.<br />
On 24 June 1971 he said: " I believe that if a woman<br />
does not want to bear a child, she should not have to. I believe<br />
in abortion upon request."<br />
Commnenting on the 1971 Federal Conference of the ALP,<br />
the official organ of the Queensland Branch of the ALP, " Trend",<br />
reports in its issue of July 1971: " Gough Whitlan made it quite<br />
clear that he favoured abortion on request, would campaign for it<br />
and support any bill aimed at aclhieving this object."<br />
We reject such an attitude. Clearly this is an issue<br />
at this election because it involves Commonwealth criminal laws<br />
which will be under review in the ni.; w Parliament. What the<br />
Commonwealth does in the A. C. T. could set an Australian standard.<br />
My Government does not intend to alter the existing<br />
abortion laws which provide for therapeutic emergencies but also<br />
protect against the unnecessary destruction of life.<br />
