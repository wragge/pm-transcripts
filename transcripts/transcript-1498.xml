FOR PRESS:-P. M. No. 21/ 1967<br />
DEATH OF DAME ANN McEWEN<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
My colleagues of the Government and I are saddened by<br />
the death of Dame Ann McEwen and express our deep sympathy.<br />
Dame Ann was a woman of great strength of character<br />
which sustained her bravely and cheerfully during her long illness.<br />
Her many public services won her the well-merited<br />
honour which she carried with distinction.<br />
She will be mourned by all who knew her.<br />
CANBERRA, February, 1962<br />
NOTE: The Prime Minister has sent a personal telegram of sympathy<br />
to Mr. McEwen, and spoke with Mr. McEwen on the ' phone<br />
this morning. </p>
