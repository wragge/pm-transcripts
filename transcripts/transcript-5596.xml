EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE FEDERAL COUNCIL MEETING OF<br />
THE LIBERAL PARTY, LAKESIDE HOTEL, CANBERRA<br />
Let us never forget that the future of Australia is totally<br />
dependent on the Liberal Party. Our Party has been the dominant<br />
political force in building the free, decent, tolerant and<br />
compassionate Australia to which we are all committed.<br />
It was the Liberal Party which provided the direction, the ideals,<br />
the purpose, and the organisation which in 1949 came to the rescue<br />
of an Australia crippled by Labor's socialist policies. We did<br />
it again in 1975.<br />
The Liberal Party stands for the way of life we want for this<br />
nation, and against those who would undermine and overthrow<br />
that way of life. Millions of people depend on the Liberal<br />
' Party to defend all that they hold dear. And we have told these<br />
millions they. can trust us.<br />
Having accepted that responsibility, our obligation is to stand<br />
together as one party, united, to advance the cause in which<br />
we all believe. And we'must never forget that we are one party.<br />
The branches, the State and Federal organisations, and the<br />
Parliamentary parties are all part of one great political<br />
movement. Whether we belong to different sections of the party<br />
or to the same section, we must retain the capacity to speak<br />
with not'at each other.<br />
Division and disunity weaken our cause and advance the cause<br />
of our political enemies. The Labor Party will never . defeat a<br />
united and purposeful Liberal Party. Only one thing can defeat<br />
the Liberal Party: division amongst ourselves.<br />
The Liberal Party embraces the broadest cross-section of the<br />
community of any political-party. We treasure in our Party a<br />
tradition of healthy argument and vigorous debate. We have<br />
a Party structure in which there has always been ample<br />
opportunity to express opinions and to persuade others that<br />
these opinions are right. We have a long tradition of working<br />
as a team and a total rejection of public actions and public<br />
behaviour which could damage respect for the Party in the wider<br />
community. / 2 </p>
<p>Our tradition of freedom in-voting in Parliament on matters of<br />
deep personal commitment is very diffe'rent from the caucusimposed<br />
discipline of the Labor Party. We recognise and<br />
respect the person of principle, and we do not ins-ist on a<br />
rigid conformity where principle is involved.. The unity of<br />
the Liberal Party does not come from compulsion. It relies<br />
rather on the intangibles of judgement and responsibility<br />
and it depends upon a sense of what is right and decent.<br />
Unlesswe recognise the importance of working together, we<br />
cannot expect the people to support us.<br />
John Mason this week decided to retire. He did so with<br />
dignity. I, along with Liberals throughout Australia, am<br />
grateful for what he has done for the Party. I hope his<br />
successor, whoever he may be, will receive the support of<br />
his colleagues in the Liberal Party. a iz<br />
We have also seen in recent days the announcement of the<br />
retirement of a great Premier in Victoria, Dick Hamer. As<br />
the days pass, -more . and more people will come to appreciate<br />
more and more fully just how much Dick Hamer has achieved.<br />
Dick Hamer is a person of decency, humanity and integrity.<br />
He always argued Victoria's case more firmly and more vigorously<br />
than many know. It was Victoria, through. Dick Hamer, which<br />
caused the Federal Government to re-open, after years of<br />
neglect, the vastly difficult problem of relativities in<br />
financial arrangements with the States. Dick Hamer deserves<br />
great credit for this. It is not widely enough appreciated<br />
: howmuch he has done to contribute to the. economic recovery<br />
that is now taking place.<br />
It is true that in recent times there were demands for greater<br />
change in policies and attitudes. But let me assert with all<br />
the strength I can command that those in the Party who joined<br />
in public criticism have not served the interests of themselves,<br />
or of the Liberal Party, or of their State.<br />
We all know that people react in different ways to difficult<br />
circumstances. But we also know that the crew which works<br />
together, which maintains its self-discipline and stays on<br />
course, will sail through to clear waters. Those who become<br />
nervous at the sight or sound of trouble, who respond to<br />
every criticism and every adverse headline, are a danger to<br />
themselves and their colleagues. Fair weather sailors in<br />
politics are a risk to their party and to the hopes of<br />
voters who have trusted them.<br />
The test of a political party is whether it can ignore the<br />
headlines that bear little relation to the substance of politics<br />
or of life. In the overall perspective, the headline of a<br />
day matters nothing. What is important is to know where our<br />
present actions will put us years and months ahead as well<br />
as weeks ahead. We need a sense of where we will be at. the<br />
end of the decade and beyond. We must take the long view and<br />
stand by the objectives of our Party., objectives which<br />
the Australian people have endorsed again and again. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
it-is only by taking the long view that our policies will<br />
be implemented, only by taking the lo ng view that we shall<br />
maintain the respect of the Australian&gt; people, only by takin~ g<br />
the long view that we will build the kind of Australia we<br />
want for our children, and-for their children.' 1t is sound<br />
understanding andconstancy of purpose that give to the<br />
Liberal Party the will and the strength to ride the storms<br />
and to be a guiding force in Australian life. When we know<br />
our philosophy and our policies are right the criticisms<br />
and attacks of the day-matter, little.<br />
We have provided leadership to Australia because of our<br />
steady purpose and philosophical dire ' ction. And at no time<br />
in recent years has that sense of purpose-and direction been.<br />
stronger than it is now.<br />
Ouar philosophy has now come to the forefront and this is in<br />
itself a remarkable turnaround. For it was only in 1972 that*<br />
Whitlaniism the so-called moderate version of Labor Socialism'-<br />
was in full flood. This doctrine gave a vast role to government<br />
and so there ensued an endless creation of departments, boards<br />
and commissions which produced a rise of 52,000 in Commonwealth<br />
employment in three years, while employment in private enterprisewas<br />
undermined.<br />
Under this doctrine, the States were to be replaced by the<br />
agents of Canberra, and private enterprise was subjected 1to<br />
the most detailed Government direction and regulation. In<br />
short, this doctrine asserted that Governments and bureaucrats<br />
know ; what-i_ 6go6d for us better than we-know it ourselves.<br />
Everyone except Labor now rejects that doctrine.<br />
There is now a virtually universal recognition that the right<br />
direction for Australia requires cutting back on bureaucracy and<br />
waste in.. Government; reducing costly regulation, and duplication<br />
between Commonwealth and States; encouraging private enterprise;<br />
reducing Government spending; and returning to people through<br />
lower taxes a greater say over how their own earnings are to be<br />
spent. The acceptance by Australians that this direction is the<br />
right one is an enormous achievement.<br />
Our Party was at the forefront in world terms in recognising<br />
during the seventies the kind of Government that would be<br />
appropriate for the rest of this century. We realised that<br />
certain policies that had been effective in earlier decades would<br />
no longer-work. . And our 1975 programme spelled out the policies<br />
that are producing in this country the way of life which<br />
Australians value, look forward to, and are entitled to have.<br />
We took a lead at a time when many people were confused. And now<br />
when many countries in the West are still struggling to regain<br />
their sense of direction, we are fortunate to be moving so strongJ<br />
in the right direction. Our programme pointed unambiguously<br />
towards lower taxes and greater job 6pportunities, to improved<br />
standards of life for all Australians, protection for those in ne<br />
an unyielding resistance to racism and discrimination; the<br />
protection of individual rights and the conservation of A4ustralia<br />
magnificent natural heritage for the benefit of all generations. .14 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
A key element in achieving-our goals was to establish a more<br />
limited role for Government. To this end we have cut back the<br />
Commonwealth's spending as a proportion of G. D. P. from over<br />
to under 28%. This is a vital achievement, fpr it helps<br />
make room for private sector growth.<br />
We intend to go further but we have come as far as we have only<br />
through the most rigorous restraint of Government expenditure.<br />
We have reduced the number of public servants under staff<br />
ceilings by some 10,000, and it is now well known that our<br />
recent decisions will lead to further reductions of some<br />
16,000 or 17,000. Through Sir Phillip Lynch's far reachinq. and<br />
visionary review of Commonwealth functions, we are introducing<br />
a number of reforms. The Commonwealth will be able to concentrate<br />
on its own major responsibilities rather than spreading its efforts<br />
and resources everywhere. Under this historic review, a number<br />
Qf functions will be passed to private enterprise. And after<br />
decades of growing centralisation in Canberra, the review of<br />
Commonwealth functions, by eliminating duplication and<br />
enabling the States to perform their appropriate functions<br />
without interference from the Commonwealth, will help revitalise<br />
the Federal relationship.<br />
A more limited and accurately focussed role for Government is<br />
equally an objective of the financial arrangements which have<br />
been made between the Commonwealth and the States, and of our<br />
new health policy. This health policy provides incentives to<br />
insuranqp and encourages people to look after themselves;<br />
it looks after the needy-and--the disadvantaged; it eliminates<br />
-the-situation where health costs of the well-to-do are paid. for<br />
by the taxpayer; and it means that one bureaucracy rather than<br />
two will be involved in the running of each State's public<br />
hospitals. These recent decisions have made our direction clearer than ever.-<br />
But we have been mcving in this direction, steadily and<br />
consistently, since 1975 and our move towards more limited and<br />
modern Government has been an integral part of economic revival....<br />
Inflation was of course our first priority and we shall keep<br />
our grip on that as tight as ever. And if anyone says that: we<br />
have placed too much emphasis on economic management I would<br />
simply say that a sound economy is the precondition of almost<br />
every other goal.<br />
Our economic policies, and the scope which we have given to<br />
private initiative, have unleashed enormous creative energies<br />
and the progress this country is now making is remarkable.<br />
The most recent figures show that in the half year to December,<br />
non-farm product grew at an'annual rate of which is an<br />
outstanding rate by O. E. C. D. standards. Private business<br />
investment is now rising at the strongest rate for three decades.<br />
The April unemployment rate of 5.6% was the lowest April rate<br />
for four years. Massive job creation is now taking place. Over<br />
the two:: years to -last December, .250,000 new jobs have been<br />
created by private enterprise. In all these economic<br />
improvements, Australia has been moving against the tide, while<br />
other countries have been standing still or even going backwards,<br />
we are going forward. Private enterprise has taken full advantag<br />
of the opportunities our policies have implanted and all<br />
Australians are feeling the benefits. </p>
<p>There is one particular point on which we must be very clear<br />
indeed:. our policies of limited Government are the policies<br />
for expansion and growth. -These policies not only create<br />
opportunities in the private sector,-' they also produce more<br />
of the wealth that is needed to fund-priority Government<br />
programmes and at the same time they encourage Goyernments<br />
to decide just where their priorities really lie.<br />
For decades, Governments have been taking more and more from<br />
people in taxes. There has to be a limit to that process. The<br />
time has come for Government to stop taking a larger and larger<br />
share of the nation's resources. If the Government wants to spend<br />
more in some areas then it should re-allocate its priorities,<br />
not demand more from the taxpayers. This is the way to pro~&amp;' ct<br />
the rights of taxpayers and at the same time maintain genezrous<br />
assistance for the needy and the disadvantaged in our society.<br />
It is part of our philosophy to stand for the protection of<br />
all people in our society. Let there be no mistake, we are<br />
the low tax party. In the three Labor Budgets, the tax receipts of<br />
the Commonwealth increased by over 10% per annum in real terms.<br />
S In our five Budgets, we have cut it. back to 3% per annum in real<br />
terms. For the coming year, there is a tax cut which will leave<br />
$ 500 million more. in taxpayers' pockets and the rebate on health<br />
insurance is expected to reduce the Commonwealth's revenue by<br />
a further $ 500 million in the following year.<br />
We believe that people can judge their own needs and wants a<br />
great deal better than can politicians or officials. Genuine<br />
. tax reductions can be achieved in only one way: -only by policies<br />
which stimulate national_ prosperityon. the one hand and hold<br />
back the demands of Government on the other. Let me-add<br />
here that the Government is determined to stamp out the. gross<br />
schemes of tax avoidance which have recently been growing up,-and<br />
the Treasurer introduced major legislation last week to deal.<br />
with them. . Let me add that. people who. cheat. on their responsibilit<br />
to. contribute a-fair share-. to the. cost of the services which<br />
Governments must provide do as much damage to the social fabric<br />
as some of the actions of militant union leaders.<br />
The freedom which Liberals seek means that we all have<br />
responsibilities to our fellow citizens, and freedom indeed depend<br />
upon a-sense of moral obligation. The-kind of Australia we want<br />
cannot be made . by laws alone. Indeed,. if every anti-social activit<br />
had to be proscribed and banned by law then we would be<br />
overwhelmed by laws and freedom could not survive. In a free<br />
society, people must accept mutual obligations based on the<br />
morality of respect for others and we in the Liberal Party must<br />
take the lead in developing this sense of community. The<br />
benefits of freedom and the importance of community responsibility,<br />
are two guiding principles of any Liberal Government. And the<br />
future will be made by the supporters of freedom by free<br />
people living and working in a free environment.<br />
Because of the emphasis which we have given to reviving<br />
Australia's economy, because of the turnaround we have. been making<br />
towards more limited Government, because we have acted with care<br />
and compassion towards the needy in our community, and because<br />
we have recognised our responsibilities to future generations,<br />
this country can look ahead: with tremendous confidence. I know of<br />
no country that can face the future with greater confidence. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
In 1983 the Liberal Party will be in a far stronger position to<br />
face the people than in 1980. The success of our approach will<br />
be increasingly obvious to all, just as it is increasingly<br />
obvious to our own organisation and members now. will win.<br />
in 1983 not by spending more, but by concentrating on the things<br />
we . ought to be doing. It will not be enough to argue that we! are<br />
good economic managers. The Australian people will want more<br />
than that. By implementing our philosophy across the whole<br />
range of human concerns and interests we are giving more. Our<br />
efforts to do more are having success. The Labor Party will.--.<br />
have to look to itself. It will be their seats which will bE.<br />
marginal, their members, not ours, who will be at risk.<br />
In taking the lead, Liberal Governments, both State and Federalt<br />
have received unstihted support from the Liberal Party. organisatfbn.<br />
Our branches, sections, committees and divisions all work<br />
untiringly and effectively for the Liberal cause. They set us all<br />
an example of loyalty, dedication and unity. I am glad to have<br />
this opportunity to thank all Party members for what they have<br />
done, especially in the 1980 campaign, and are continuing to do.<br />
I also thank the Federal Secretariat.<br />
We are the only party in this country with a philosophy that is<br />
relevant and practical for: our age. We are the only party with<br />
policies which express the values that Australians want to see<br />
built into this country's future. There will be difficulties<br />
ahead, there will be occasions to test the nerves. But the<br />
, problems . before us will increasingly be the problems of prosperity<br />
and-expansion.----.-.<br />
Mr. Hayden has said that the challenge to Socialism is-the spread<br />
of philosophies based on smaller Government and lower taxes.<br />
How right he ist he does not know how right he is. The<br />
Liberal Party has once more given direction to Australian. history-....<br />
Provided we maiitain our policies, provided that we never draw<br />
back from what we know to be right, provided that we act for all<br />
Australians in every walk of life, then a magnificent future<br />
awaits this country.<br />
I want to say just one thing more. Over the years, a quotation<br />
-about what life was or wasn't meant to be like has often been<br />
:.. talked about.-Some. people have said it represents my philosophy.-<br />
I think that now is the time to let you into a secret. Only<br />
half the quotation is ever quoted. In full, it says " Life is<br />
not meant to be easyi my child; but take courage: it can be..<br />
delightful". 000---</p>
