CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL. DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CAMPAIGN LAUNCH FOR SIMON CREAN<br />
MELBOURNE 4 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
I am going to leave you in doubt as to when the election is<br />
to be held.<br />
But I will leave you in no doubt at all that whenever it is<br />
held, it will see Simon Crean elected to Federal Parliament<br />
as an important addition to the ranks of the Labor<br />
Government. I have said in the past that there is a deep and<br />
unbridgeable policy chasm dividing this Labor Government<br />
from the collection of New Right ideologues who run the<br />
conservative Coalition.<br />
One critical aspect of this chasm has been the differences<br />
between us about how Australians as a community crpatp and<br />
earn our national prosperity.<br />
As Simon has just described, the two parties have for more<br />
than a decade been consistently and sharply and profoundly<br />
divided on this great question of industrial relations.<br />
An equally important aspect of this chasm between the<br />
Government and the Opposition concerns the way in which<br />
Australians as a community di-girihute the proceeds of<br />
national prosperity.<br />
What the Opposition's health fiasco tells us so clearly is<br />
that on this critical policy, Labor and conservatives stand<br />
for diametrically opposite values.<br />
Under this Government, we've created a system of health<br />
insurance that provides security to the sick and the<br />
elderly,-and to Australian-fami-lies-who would otherwise have<br />
to fend for themselves.<br />
Medicare is quite simply the most successful health<br />
insurance policy Australia has ever known.<br />
It is universal and it is fair. </p>
<p>It has brought two million Australian who were previously<br />
unprotected in under the umbrella of health insurance. Now<br />
all Australians are covered for essential medical and<br />
hospital treatment.<br />
More people than ever before are receiving treatment in our<br />
hospital systems. Compared to the last year before Medicare<br />
was introduced, this year some 600,000 more people will get<br />
hospital treatment.<br />
And it is financed responsibly and fairly, through the<br />
health insurance levy. People on higher incomes pay more;<br />
people on lower incomes pay less.<br />
Let us be very clear at the outset what it is that the<br />
Opposition is proposing to do.<br />
When you scrape away the dissembling and the code words,<br />
what you find is the conservatives' plain and simple<br />
determination to smash Medicare.<br />
They would throw millions of Australians out in the cold:<br />
forcing families to run the risk of major medical or<br />
hospital costs without the safe, simple, efficient and fair<br />
protection offered by Medicare.<br />
Let's look at the facts.<br />
In place of this fair and universal system, what the<br />
Opposition wants to do is, in Mr Shack's words, " quite<br />
simply to get back to a better mix between the public<br />
and private funding of the health care system".<br />
Translate the code words, and you have an Opposition policy<br />
that would destroy Medicare by driving as many people as<br />
possible back into the arms of the private health insurance<br />
funds. Those who can't afford private health insurance would be<br />
left out in the cold.<br />
Those people whom Mr Peacock described last November as<br />
" silly enough" to do without private health insurance " for<br />
whatever reason" that is, if they can't afford it would<br />
have no protection against the sudden trauma of massive<br />
doctors' bills or hospital bills.<br />
This is not theory; it is fact.<br />
The only choice people would have is either to take out<br />
private health insurance, or to run the risk of huge medical<br />
and hospital bills.<br />
Inevitably, some of those who are forced to choose the<br />
latter will incur bills they cannot pay. </p>
<p>What happens then? In the past, some have gone to jail as<br />
debtors. In South Australia, in the years before Medibank,<br />
more people were jailed for failing to pay hospital and<br />
doctors' bills than for any other single debt related<br />
offence. Do Australians really want to turn the clock back to that<br />
Dickensian society?<br />
Do Australians want families to be destroyed because they<br />
run the risk of unaf fordable health bills?<br />
Yet this would be the real effect of the Peacock/ Shack<br />
health fiasco not the hypocritical humbug they spout about<br />
protecting families in a fairer, more compassionate<br />
Australia. It was that famous press conference held by the Opposition's<br />
health spokesman, the hapless Mr Shack, that brought all<br />
this into clear focus.<br />
But the conservatives' real priorities have been clear for<br />
many years.<br />
The Fraser Government dismantled Medibank, despite<br />
Mr Fraser's personal and explicit promise to protect it.<br />
Now a Peacock Opposition wants to dismantle Medicare.<br />
What a disaster of an alternative Government!<br />
They've been in Opposition for seven years, and they have to<br />
call a press conference on the eve of a long weekend, to<br />
announce that they don't have a costed policy.<br />
But at least Mr Shack got something right.<br />
Mr Shack said: " The Liberal and National Parties do not<br />
have a particularly good track record in health, and you<br />
don't need me to remind you of our last period in<br />
government." I couldn't have put it better myself.<br />
And then there was this Freudian slip: " You might accuse us<br />
of a lot of things, but one of the things that I don't think<br />
we're guilty of is learning from our past mistakes."<br />
But the sole qatZd initiative after seven years of<br />
Opposition as opposed to the hidden agenda to do away with<br />
Medicare was to set up a committee in Government to try<br />
and find the answers that have eluded the conservatives in<br />
Opposition. This non-policy came only after months in which Mr Peacock<br />
and Mr Shack repeatedly promised they were about to produce<br />
a fully costed, detailed health policy. </p>
<p>It was just around the corner, they said. It was on the<br />
way. Last November, for example, Mr Peacock assured Australians<br />
that his health policy would be " the most successful and<br />
supported health policy, and I'm very confident of that."<br />
" It's not for me to release," he said, " but for Mr Shack,<br />
because it's such a very good health policy."<br />
This was at a time when there was basically no health policy<br />
at all!<br />
There was no health policy because there was no way of<br />
meeting the Opposition's twin goals that no-one would be<br />
worse of f and that the Government would be required to spend<br />
no extra money.<br />
Those twin goals always sounded like pie in the sky to<br />
anyone who understood anything about health funding.<br />
Now, at last, even the Opposition has accepted that they<br />
were pie in the sky.<br />
It seems more likely that, if ever the conservative health<br />
policy was implemented, it would fail bath tests.<br />
Smashing Medicare would certainly leave many people worse<br />
off. And funding a replacement for Medicare would certainly<br />
involve a large but unspecified Government expenditure.<br />
Mr Shack would only estimate the cost to be " somewhere<br />
between zero and $ 2.6 billion, depending on how many people<br />
opt out of the system".<br />
But don't be fooled into thinking that any extra Opposition<br />
spending on health would end up in the pockets of ordinary<br />
Australians. It would represent instead a direct subsidy, by the<br />
taxpayers, of private health insurance companies, private<br />
hospitals, and private doctors.<br />
That's where the money would be going<br />
-Whn--he e-ased--where' s--the -money -eoming from, Mr Shack<br />
refused to say. Or more precisely, he had no answer. It<br />
had to wait for what he called " Budget Cabinet" sometime in<br />
the first year of a Peacock Government.<br />
Of course, the implications of those words go far beyond the<br />
limits of a health policy.<br />
They go to the heart of the Opposition's entire Economic<br />
Action Plan. </p>
<p>Mr Shack was asked how he would fund the extra costs would<br />
there be higher taxes or greater spending cuts. His answer:<br />
this is a decision for Budget Cabinet.<br />
If you can't answer the fundamental questions about taxation<br />
levels and spending cuts, you don't have an economic action<br />
plan. If you can't answer those fundamental questions, your entire<br />
budgetary strategy is in tatters.<br />
Mr Peacock cannot assure people that what he promises to<br />
give with one hand such as child care rebates won't be<br />
taken away with the other in the form of a new health tax<br />
or even deeper cuts in some critical area of Government<br />
spending. The conservatives have a simple motive for wanting to<br />
destroy Medicare.<br />
They want to satisfy at last the vested interests who have<br />
opposed Medicare ever since it was first introduced as<br />
Medibank by Gough Whitlam.<br />
You can hardly ask for a more clear-cut case of the<br />
distorted priorities of the Opposition.<br />
They put self-interest and vested interest ahead of national<br />
interest and the interests of Australian families.<br />
They put ideology ahead of rational, common sense public<br />
policy. And they put the chaos of unplanned change ahead of the<br />
stability and fairness of Medicare.<br />
Andrew Peacock may think that he has taken health of f the<br />
election agenda by making Peter Shack run the gauntlet of<br />
the Press Gallery on the eve of a long weekend.<br />
But I can assure you that I and my Ministers will be making<br />
sure, every day, health stays on the election agenda.<br />
Because if you want a single policy that is a crucial test<br />
of both responsible economic management and effective social,<br />
justice, then health policy is it.<br />
-And -the oonservat-ives-L-eouldn de 4rver -en -their health<br />
promises. They couldn't get the figures to add up; they<br />
couldn't meet the expectations they had raised.<br />
So every day, my Ministers and I will be reminding the<br />
Australian people of the conservatives' real agenda: to<br />
smash Medicare. </p>
