    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has delivered on its election promise to cut green tape with all states and territories signing on for the one-stop shop for environmental assessments and approvals.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has today signed Memoranda of Understanding to implement a one-stop shop with the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>This means all Australian states and territories are now on board to develop a one-stop shop for environmental assessments and approvals within 12 months.</p>
<p>Establishing a single approval process that meets all state, territory and commonwealth laws is a key part of the Coalition’s deregulation agenda to strengthen our economy. It will create certainty for investment, grow the economy, reduce costs for business, boost productivity and create jobs.</p>
<p>By eliminating duplication, we can deliver more timely approvals and enable Australian businesses to expedite their work while maintaining the current high standard of environmental protection.</p>
<p>This approach was recommended by the Productivity Commission in its recent research report which supports the Coalition’s commitment to streamline environmental approval processes.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has today also signed a new assessment bilateral agreement with Queensland. This is a significant next step in the establishment of a comprehensive one-stop shop for environmental approvals, incorporating the federal environmental requirements.</p>
<p>A bilateral assessment agreement with New South Wales is currently being finalised.</p>
