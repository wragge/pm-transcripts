PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 20 OCTOBER 1978<br />
The Prime Minister today welcomed the assurances that the<br />
Government had received from the Government of Syria, that<br />
restrictions on Australian passengers of the Jewish faith<br />
transitting through Damascus airport are no longer applicable.<br />
These assurances had been given following representations by<br />
the Australian Government, which had been very concerned about<br />
reports that QANTAS was acceding to Syrian regulations that<br />
prohibited people of Jewish faith, of any nationality, travelling<br />
on aircraft that called at Damascus.<br />
Mr Fraser reaffirmed that the Australian Government abhorred all<br />
forms of discrimination on racial, religious or other grounds.<br />
The Australian Government had now asked QANTAS to take the<br />
necessary action to ensure that the Travel Information Manual<br />
issued by IATA is amended appropriately to conform with the<br />
current situation.<br />
This Manual is used by a large number of international airlines<br />
And travel agents, and it was on the basis of the information<br />
contained in it that QANTAS and other international airlines<br />
had counselled passengers of the Jewish faith to avoid flights<br />
through Damascus.<br />
Mr Fraser said that he was delighted that this restriction no<br />
longer applied, because the Government could not and would not<br />
condone discrimination against any group of Australian citizens. </p>
