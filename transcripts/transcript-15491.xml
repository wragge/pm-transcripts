    <content><![CDATA[<p>If Australia is serious about addressing climate change it must consider adding nuclear power to its energy mix, as many other countries are already doing.</p>
<p>Nuclear power is the only reliable source of low emission baseload power now available.  </p>
<p>There are no plans to develop nuclear power stations in Australia. The Government will not build nuclear power stations and does not expect to see proposals for private nuclear power stations for 10 to 15 years. </p>
<p>Power stations would only be constructed if they were commercially viable and satisfied strict environmental, non-proliferation, health and safety requirements. </p>
<p>My Government has decided there will be binding local plebiscites conducted in communities where power stations are proposed to be built. This would follow extensive community consultation.</p>
<p>Labor's reckless fear campaign against nuclear power is short-sighted, irresponsible and puts Australia's capability to deal with climate change at risk. </p>
<p>Many countries are investing in nuclear power, with 90 new power stations under construction or consideration.  Nuclear energy already represents 16% of the world's electricity generation and contributes to the global abatement of more than two billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Government's priority is to tackle climate change without damaging Australian jobs and living standards.  Nuclear power could make a significant contribution to this challenge.  </p>
<p>These opportunities are too important to be lost to Australia because of a dishonest Labor fear campaign about nuclear power.</p>
