IIWELCOME THE INAUGURATION OF THIS IMPORTANT COUr,$'<br />
~* IN THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT AT THIS IMPORT-ANT INSTITUTTONv<br />
jo IF I HAVE ONE COMPLAINT AGAINST AUSTRALIAN<br />
INSTITUTIONS OF TERTIARY EDUCATION IT IS THIS: THEY HAVE<br />
B3EEN REMARKABLY SLOW TO RECOGNISE THE VALUE OF PRACTICAL.<br />
TRAINING IN GOVERNM1ENT AND PUB3LIC ADMINISTRATION: CAN<br />
., ILLUSTRATE THIS BY RECALLING MY OWN DAY-S AS A STnflENTgC<br />
IN THOSE DAYS, AND INDEED UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY, THERE<br />
WERE PLENTY OF COURSES IN PO. I. TICAL SCIENCE BUT N1O COURSES<br />
p IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT; THERE WERE COURSES IN MEDICIN. E BUT-<br />
/ 9NONE IN. HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION; THERE lWEtE. COURSOiS IN<br />
EDUCATION BUT NONE IN UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION , t THJERE<br />
' i ~ WAS A STRONG TEMPTATION AND I SUSPECT THERE IS~ A TEMPTA1J ON'<br />
NOW -TO REGARD THESE PRACTICAL SUBJECTS* AS THE PROVINCE<br />
AMATEURS*, BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF THE TRUE SCHOLAIR A 1-1D A 11.11I<br />
' OF TIME FOR THE BORN LEADER) C YET TODAY, IF WE. Tf!-K2-THOSE<br />

S1 IT IS A MEA,..; E OF THE IMPORTANCE NOW ACCORDED TO SUCH<br />
STUDIES, A RECOGNITION OF THE GROWING COMPLEXITY AND<br />
SOPHISTICATION OF MODERN GOVERNM1ENT AND SOCIAL ORGANISATION,<br />
THAT WE ARE INAUGURATING THIS SENIOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN<br />
SLOCAL GOVERNMENT AT THE CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED<br />
SEDUCATIONX<br />
* TWO WEEKS AGO I SPOKE TO MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTE<br />
IOF MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION IN MELBOURNE AND GAVE AN ACCOU; T<br />
S OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIATIVES ON BEHALF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS..<br />
IT STRUCK ME THAT SO MUCH OF MY GOVERNMENT'S HOPES AND<br />
. AMBITIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEPENDED NOT JUST ON WHAT<br />
: GOVERNMENTS CAN DO, BUT ON THE CALIBRE AND EXPERIENCE OF THE<br />
S' MEN AND WOMEN WHO ADMINISTER CITIES, SHIRES AND MUNICIPALITIES<br />
.' FROM DAY TO DAY, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES<br />
SHOULD BE RUN BY PEOPLE WITH RIGOROUS PRACTICAL TRAINING IN<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIONX THIS IS NO TASK FOR THE<br />
AMATEUR OR THE DILETTANTEX VIE ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
' SYSTEMATIC STUDIES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL MAN, AND THE<br />
BUSINESSMANX WHY HAS IT TAKEN SO LONG TO RECOGNISE THAT<br />
SUCH TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR IN LOCAL'<br />
" c GOVERNMENT, FOR THE LEADER IN PUBLIC LIFE AS WELL AS FOR THE<br />
SLEADER IN COMMERCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE?<br />
it<br />
I </p>
<p>. THIS COURSE IN LOCAL G<br />

EVENTFUL ONE PERHAPS A FATEFU<br />

THE EMPHASIS MY GOVERNMENT HAS<br />

PLACE AS A FULL AND EQUAL PARTN<br />
IT IS NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF PRI<br />
MORE MONEY IS CERTAINLY NEEDEDX<br />
ARE WITH THE TRUE STATUS OF L<br />
ULTIMATE IMPACT ON OUR LIVESX<br />
NEXT MAY AND THERE SHOULD BE<br />
COMPANY TO EXPLAIN OUR REFERENDI<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL BE EMPOWERED TO<br />
GOVERNMENT BODIES AND TO DISTRI<br />
DEALINGS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMEI<br />
IN THAT WAY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT W<br />

-ORDINATION BETWEEN THE" i,<br />
r i r<br />
r-</p>
<p>SALREADY MY GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN SEVERAL PRACTICAL<br />
STEPS TO PLACE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON A MORE SECURE FOOTING,<br />
, ONE OF OUR FIRST ACTIONS LAST YEAR WAS TO WIDEN THE CHARTER<br />
OF THE COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMiISSION TO ENABLE IT TO HEAR<br />
APPLICATIONS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGIONS FOR GRANTS UNDER<br />
" SECTION 96 OF THE CONSTITUTION. IN THIS WAY WE HOPE TO MAKE<br />
THE COMMISSION AS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING INEQUALITIES BETWEEN<br />
S" REGIONS WITHIN THE STATES AS IT HAS BEEN IN REDUCING<br />
INEQUALITIES BETWEEN THE STATES THEMSELVESt THE FIRST<br />
APPLICATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND HEARINGS<br />
WILL BEGIN SHORTLY OUR SECOND INITIATIVE WAS TO SEEK A VOICE<br />
AND A VOTE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE LOAN COUNCIL, WE<br />
RAISED THIS PROPOSAL A PROPOSAL CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY<br />
S, OF THE LABOR PARTY AND OUR MANDATE FROM'THE PEOPLE AT THE<br />
.; CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION LAST SEPTEMBER; AND I REMIND YOU THAT<br />
IT WAS AT THE EXPRESS INSISTENCE OF MY GOVERNMENT THAT<br />
: IR, EPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE ADMITTED TO THAT<br />
CONVENTIONX WE RAISED THE PROPOSAL AGAIN AT A SPECIAL<br />
CONFERENCE OF THE PREMIERS IN OCTOBERx THE INABILITY OF THE<br />
PREMIERS TO REACH UNANIMITY ON OUR PROPOSAL OBLIGED US TO<br />
EEK A REFERENDUM A REFERENDUM TO REMOVE ALL CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
OBSTACLES TO THE RATIONAL CO-ORDINATION OF LOCAL, STATE AND<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA, </p>
<p>IAM FIRU-1LY CONIVIVICED THAT UNLESS THAT REFERENDUIM<br />
IS CARRIED LOCAL COVERNMIET IN AUSTRALIA WILL REMAIN IN ITS<br />
PRESENT SAT-JACK1ET, ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERM'ANENT<br />
FINANCIAL CRISIS, A POOR RELATION OF STATE GOV'ERNMENTS THAT<br />
LACK THE MEANS rO GIVE LOCAL GOVERIHEiNIT THE RESOURCES IT<br />
NEEDS,,, VE CAN GIVE LOCAL GOV/ ERNMENT THE MEANS TO DO ITS JOBA<br />
WE CAN GI\ VE IT THE STATUS AND AUTONOMY IT DESERVES)( WE CAN<br />
ENSURE ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE NOT AS AN APPENDAGE OF THE STATES,<br />
: NOT AS AN APPENDAGE OF THE COMMONWEALTH* BUT AS AN EQUAL<br />
9 PARTNER W1ITH BOTH IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEIf.! NO ONE KNOWS BETTER<br />
THAN YOU PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, AND ESPECIALLY THE DEDICATED<br />
MEN AND 11OMEN WHO HAVE UNDERTAKEN THIS FIRST COURSE IN LOCAL<br />
GOVERN4MENT AT THIS COLLEGE, THE FRUSTRATIONS AND DIFFICULTI0<br />
OF THE CAREER YOU HAVE CHOSEN~ I BELIEVE THAT IF YOUR CAREERS<br />
Q , ARE TO BE FULLY REWARDING, IF YOUR STUDIES AT THIS COLLEGE<br />
ARE TO BE TRULY MEANINGFUL AND VALUABLE TO YOU AND SOCIETYf<br />
THEN TOGETHER WE MUST WORK FOR A NEW DEAL FOR LOkCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
A-NEW DEAL THAT WILL ENSURE ITS FIRM PLACE It 0NES TI T tiT<br />
AND IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEMit<br />
. IHAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE REAL FUTURE OF LOCAL<br />
', GOVERNMENT, ITS REAL SUCCESS, ITS RELEVAN4CE A0D APAPiABILITY,<br />
ITS POPULARITY, ITS ABILITY TO INVOLVE CITIZENS AND * fO ENGAGE<br />
:;-THEIR EFFORTS AND SYMPATHIES, WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON 711E<br />
PEOPLE WHO ADMINIISTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON A DAILY BASIS, 0<br />
:. L~ OCAL. GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED DIRECTLY-WITH OUR LIV<br />

THAT IS WHY I WELCOME THE I14ITIATIVE FOR THIS COURSE<br />
. AT THE CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCAT 1ONf I SHOULD<br />
EMPHASISE THAT IT IS NOT AN " ACCREDITATION COURSE" FOR LOCAL<br />

I AM GLAD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF URBAN<br />
AND REGIONAL DEVELOP1MENT, FROM NEXT YEAR, WILL BE CONTRIBUTING<br />
$ 12,000 A YEAR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COURSE4 THE COLLEGE<br />
HAS ACCEPTED THE DEPARTMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT, DEPENDING<br />
ON THE NEEDS OF THE COLLEGE, PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO<br />
USING THE MONEY TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION AT<br />
COURSES BY OFFICERS FROM SMALLER AREAS; A GENERAL REDUCTION<br />
IN THE COST OF THE COURSE WHERE PRACTICAL; AND PROVISION<br />
OF FUNDS FOR VISITING LECTURERS OR RESEARCH ACTIVITIESX<br />
ANY FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE COLLEGE FOR . SCHOLARSHIP ATTENDANCE'<br />
CERTAINLY YOU CAN RELY ON MY GOVERNMENT'S ACTIVE<br />
E NCOURAGEMENT AND PRACTICAL SUPPORTt BUT WHAT I FIND TRULY<br />
HEARTENING IS THAT THE INITIATIVE FOR THIS COURSE CAME FROM<br />
LOCAL-GOVERNMENT ITSELF,, IT IS SYMBOLIC, PERHAPS, OF<br />
NGATTHIOEN AL IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT<br />
r: THE COURSE SHOULD BE PROVIDED HERE, IN THE NATIONAL CAPITALIT<br />
SEEMS TO ME THAT COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION ARE<br />
UNIQUELY EQUIPPED, WITH THEIR MORE FEEXIBLE PROGRAMMING<br />
ORRANTGOE MPERNOTVSID, E COURSES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION<br />
E AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOW ASSUMED TOTAL FUNDING<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES'FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION, INCLUDING<br />
