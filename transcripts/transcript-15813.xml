    <content><![CDATA[<p>It was with sadness this morning that I learned of the passing of former Federal Member for Hindmarsh, Whitlam Government Minister and leading light of the Australian labour movement, Clyde Cameron.</p>
<p>From his early days in South Australia as a shearer, union organiser and industrial advocate, and throughout his parliamentary career, Clyde Cameron was dedicated to defending the interests of working people.</p>
<p>As a Cabinet Minister in the Whitlam Government, Clyde's appointment of former High Court Justice Mary Gaudron to prosecute the case for equal pay for female workers in the Arbitration Commission made history.</p>
<p>Clyde was a leading advocate for pension increases, the provision of child care to support working women, and greatly improved the pay and conditions of public sector workers during his term as Minister for Labour and Immigration.</p>
<p>Although his career was not without controversy, Clyde Cameron's passion and commitment for working men and women remained paramount.</p>
<p>This was illustrated by his 31 years loyal service to the families of Hindmarsh.</p>
<p>Clyde Cameron retained throughout his life a great sense of pride and history. He will be sorely missed, particularly by those for whom he always stood so strongly.</p>
