TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MAXINE MCKEW, ABC RADIO, THE WORLD TODAY<br />
14 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MM: Prime Minister, Dr Hewson has this morning rejected your claim that he would<br />
change the GST and include food after the election. Don't you have to face the<br />
fact that the electorate could vell be in a mribod to believe Dr Hewson?<br />
PM: Why would they? He has said now for a year that if he changes his policy he will<br />
resign, he'd resign first. All of that humbug has been made obvious by his vaultface<br />
on the matter. He said yesterday in the newspapers, " in my own analysis it<br />
was fair to do what I planned", that was tax food. So he has got the hide to say<br />
yesterday: I still think taxing food is right but won't because of public opinion.<br />
In other words, he has changed his policy but he hasn't changed his mind.<br />
MM: But, Prime Minister, you have made some quite dramatic policy U-turns<br />
throughout your career, why shouldn't Dr Hewson be able to plausibly do exactly<br />
the same thing?<br />
PM: Yes, but anything that I have done has been within the framework that the<br />
Government was working in all the years.<br />
MM: 1985?<br />
PM: No, but we abandoned it. I didn't introduce it and then sneak in a food tax. Look,<br />
Dr Hewson believes let me say this, why doesn't he exempt things If he<br />
thinks the GST is unfair, where does he draw the line? Why doesn't he exempt<br />
other household necessities like water, gas, electricity and the telephone? Or, what<br />
about children's clothing, or clothing in general? Or takeaway food, what's he<br />
going to do with takeaway food? Are all the takeaway outfits going to be taxed<br />
with a 15 per cent GST? </p>
<p>MM: Well, presumably we'll get all those details on Friday.<br />
PM: Can I just say this. The Cole Committee, which was doing all these details about<br />
the building industry, tourism, all of these questions about food, fast food, all the<br />
distinctions which will really matter, it's now going to cynically report after the<br />
election, after having been promised by Dr Hewson in the middle of the year,<br />
September, October, then before Christmas, now after the election. In other words,<br />
all the details will be buried, and yet we're asked to believe that when he runs into<br />
the complexities of exempting food and the administrative mess of things like fast<br />
food and restaurants, and all the other things, that he won't when he has a political<br />
opportunity introduce a tax on food. Well of course he'll do it. Of course he'll do<br />
it.<br />
MM: Well, Prime Minister, can you spend the entire campaign wandering around saying<br />
that John Hewson is not to be believed? If you do that people might think you<br />
have nothing else to offer.<br />
PM: Hang on, let's be clear about this, this is the man..<br />
MM: You're making a big point about his believability factor.<br />
PM: He's now walking around talking about compassion. This is the fellow who said<br />
this..<br />
MM: Why do you reject that as so implausible, though? Isn't it perfectly conceivable<br />
that John Hewson could have had a conversion on the road to Damascus?<br />
PM: Come on, look, he discovered his heart when he discovered fear in it. Th1at's when<br />
he discovered his heart.<br />
MM: Others would say flexibility, that he's listening to people, the fact that he is now<br />
starting to do all the things that you'd been suggesting he should.<br />
PM: I'd say not flexibility. Fright. Look, he said this in a debate recently, " I remember<br />
you" ( that's me) " I remember you saying not long ago that when they fall off the<br />
pace" ( that's the poor and the underprivileged) " you'll reach back and pull them up.<br />
What you mean is you'll pull everyone else down to the lowest common<br />
denominator". Now how could you hold those sort of cold-hearted views and<br />
then be running around after your Federal Director has been on your back and<br />
saying that you're a born-again compassionate person? Then he said this, in a<br />
written speech recently to the Family Summit, he said " giving people choice is the<br />
compassion that liberates, just giving is the compassion that suffocates". This is a<br />
person who has, in terms of those not well-off, lacked any soul whatsoever. Now<br />
we're supposed to believe that because he is faced with a 47 per cent poll support<br />
for Labor and 40 for the Coalition last week, and the panic-stricken directives of </p>
<p>his Federal Director, Mr Robb, that we're supposed to say this is a new-found<br />
compassion and a new-found sense of decency in policy.<br />
MM: Prime Minister..<br />
PM: The thing is, Maxine, if you believe that you'd believe anything.<br />
MM: Prime Minister, one could say he has in fact listened to the force of your message,<br />
he is after all doing all the things that you've suggested he do he's listening, he's<br />
talking about equity and fairness and he says he is going to stimulate recovery.<br />
PM: No, this is the same fellow who said this on stimulation, he said on 24 November<br />
in the House ' surely stimulatory economic policies do not work'.<br />
MM: Well, now he's seen the light.<br />
PM: Come on, seen the light, come on. I mean is there any scepticism left amongst<br />
some of you people in the Gallery? Come on, please. This is a fellow who for a<br />
year has told Australians Fightback is the answer, if there's any variation in this I'll<br />
resign. Stimulatory policies don't work, if you reach down to help the poor they'll<br />
drag us all down and now we are supposed to believe with one beach walk and a<br />
couple of press statements that he's a compassionate, thinking, caring, listening<br />
person. You know what he's listening to? His Federal Director. You know what<br />
he's listening to? The polls, nothing else.<br />
MM: Prime Minister, if as you say John Hewson will bring the GST back on food after<br />
the election, what will you then do after the following election, will you remove<br />
the GST if elected, the election after next?<br />
PM: I made it clear where we stood, if he campaigns saying that food should be<br />
excluded and then he puts food in, subscquently we would vote against that in the<br />
Senate. But he would have certainly no..<br />
MM: You'd vote against the food being included on it?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MM: But you would pass the rest of the GST.<br />
PM: Well, if he won an election on the basis of the GST.<br />
MM: Right, let's fast forward to the following election, what would you do then?<br />
Would you campaign on the basis?<br />
PM: If you are still here Maxine I'll tell you then. </p>
<p>MM: Prime Minister, you didn't answer that question in Perth last week. If you are<br />
leaping ahead and assuming what John Hewson will do..<br />
PM: You are talking about two elections away.<br />
MM: I know, but that's what you're doing.<br />
PM: Six years away.<br />
MM: You're making judgements about what John Hewson will do after the election.<br />
Shouldn't you answer the same question about the election after next?<br />
PM: No, Maxine after the election can be within six to twelve months from now, that is,<br />
in the immediate future. The fact of the matter is that even with food out of the<br />
GST, it still collects $ 22 billion it's nearly half the Commonwealth's total<br />
income tax. T'his is a massive disruption to macro-economy and to the way all<br />
Australians will live. What he said is nothing that I've said in the past about being<br />
the politician that Australia needs, about having the policies which we require<br />
about not shifting, not bending what the Liberal Party have ended up with now is<br />
another Andrew Peacock, but without the good nature or the good humour.<br />
They've got someone who is a flim-flam man, someone who really basically<br />
doesn't stand for any policy other than that which will get him a vote at the polls.<br />
So all this hyperbole we've heard from him I'm the man, I'm the person, I'd rather<br />
resign than change is basically just pap. What we've got is what the Liberals<br />
always give us a collection of Andrew Peacocks only this time without a soul,<br />
without the good humour and without the good nature.<br />
MM: Prime Minister, regardless of what you see as the motives, isn't the fact that the<br />
policy shift by Dr Hewson back to the centre ground, if you like, doesn't that put<br />
pressure on you to move further to the left in your own policy?<br />
PM: His model is Fightback, which is a tax switch, which he says now he will make<br />
less objectionable, and he is talking vaguely about some stimulatory add on.<br />
MM: What if he comes out with a big on Friday?<br />
PM: Hang on. Just listen. It would do some of you people in the gallery good to listen,<br />
because none of you picked the pick up in Labor's fortunes, none of you. Basically<br />
you are writing the columns..<br />
MM: Yes, but you don't believe it either otherwise you would be having an election<br />
before Christmas. </p>
<p>PM: Yes we do believe it, yes, there are too many polls not to believe it. None of you<br />
picked it, just listen to what I say. John Hewson's framework is the Fightback<br />
framework. It is a tax switch which he says he will make less objectionable with<br />
maybe some things added on to it. The Government's framework is entirely<br />
different, it is a decade long development of a safety net, access and equity in<br />
education, in health, in aged care, in child care, it is a systemic approach of a<br />
Government with real compassion, a party with real compassion, well placed and<br />
as well as that a commitment by the Government to go back to doing what it has<br />
always done well and that is growing the economy. His framework is nothing like<br />
that, his framework is basically to have a tax switch which will increase prices, he<br />
wants to cut wages through his industrial relations policy and then we are<br />
supposed to say, well in all that cold hearted, hard hearted framework he might<br />
make the tax change less objectionable and he might add something on to it which<br />
I am supposed to say, oh well in that case, this is really something. I mean this is<br />
the same old tired framework, ideological framework which is reminiscent of<br />
Thatcher in ' 78-' 79, Reagan in 1980, which is now out of sync with the times all<br />
around the world, which Dr Hcwson now realises he has got difficulty with, he is<br />
not changing it because he thinks it is right to change it, in fact he thinks it is<br />
wrong to change it, he is changing it just for votes.<br />
MM: Don't you have to develop your own positive message and not just reiterate a<br />
negative message against Dr Hewson?<br />
PM: Maxine, I have just come from the Science Council where we were just talking<br />
about today, extending Australian science and technology into Asia. Where<br />
people at the meeting are saying that this Government's shift into Asia, in foreign<br />
policy terms, has made all the difference. Later today I am seeing people<br />
associated with the Qantas sale, we have got a brand new airline system just about<br />
to come off the stocks. We were talking this morning about the development of a<br />
national vocational education system which has happened this year with the<br />
national training authority. The Government is the Government of Australia, it is<br />
doing the big bold things like vocational education, like the shift into Asia, like<br />
telecommunications. That's where we stand, we don't have to run around and<br />
say...<br />
MM: But you did.<br />
PM: And say well now this finky dink proposal of the leader of the Opposition is too<br />
objectionable and has to be varied, where are going to say, oh well in that case our<br />
framework somehow has to be adjusted. Our framework is the framework of a<br />
sure-footed, confident Government that has remodelled the Australian economy<br />
from an industrial museum to a modemn industrial state.<br />
MM: But just finally you did articulate in Perth last week that you wanted to work on a<br />
second term agenda, as you put it. </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: Oh yes, but it will be again consistent with the big things we have done in the<br />
macro-economy, the micro-economy and in social policy. But Maxine let us not<br />
hear for a Government that has strung together one of the best social safety nets in<br />
the world, where you have had somebody as heartless as Hewson saying to us if<br />
you lean out to help people you will pull people down. If you give them things it<br />
is compassion which suffocates them. Let's not hear the hypocrisy and humbug of<br />
him saying, within weeks of saying those things, that he now believes that he is<br />
listening to people with compassion. You know what he is listening to, the polls?<br />
And do you know what he has found in his heart, he has found his heart? Because<br />
for the first time he has found fear in his heart, that is where he discovered it.<br />
