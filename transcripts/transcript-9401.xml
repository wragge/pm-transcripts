TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RAY MARTIN, " A CURRENT AFFAIR",<br />
3 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
RM: Prime Minister, thanks for your time. Now you're buying a house, as I<br />
understand it, like a lot of other Australians. What home interest rate<br />
have you allowed for in your budget?<br />
PM: Well, I'll take it as it comes, but I know it's coming with low inflation,<br />
so it's not....<br />
RM: You wouldn't handle 18% or 19% like you had a few years back?<br />
PM: Well this is not going to be the 1980s. We're not sitting on an<br />
inflation rate of or we're last week we had an inflation rate<br />
of and that is what in the end drives interest rates. So, interest<br />
rates will rise in the recovery you have seen that already<br />
RM: Right. Are these the rises we had to have?<br />
PM: The answer I think is yes but again, they won't be like the 1980s.<br />
They won't be as high as the 1980s, they won't go up like the 1980s.<br />
RM: Well we hope not, wouldn't we?<br />
PM: Well we would.<br />
RM: 14 or 15% is what Alexander Downer is predicting today he says<br />
they're going to explode.<br />
PM: Well that is just irresponsible, mindless behaviour that's what it is.<br />
That is unnecessarily trying to frighten people when at the moment,<br />
the official overnight cash and call rate in the Reserve Bank is<br />
and that's what drives the bills and drives everything else.<br />
RM: But you have people today that are paying 9.5% plus.<br />
PM: Yes, but that is not 16%. 14 Z71<br />
Q-D </p>
<p>RM: Do you categorically rule out 14<br />
PM: Well I can't be the interest rate ruling out business, Ray. But one<br />
thing for sure the 1980s are not here.<br />
RM: Do you scratch your head though, when you read the papers and the<br />
economics experts not just the pundits, but the experts who say<br />
" well, despite this positive news, I think there is still a boom-bust<br />
cycle around the corner"?<br />
PM: You see, we have got the same local group of commentators we have<br />
had for 20 years you and I know who they are and they are still<br />
saying the same thing: " we're all ' rooned it will never be any good",<br />
where the fact is that this is the best conjunction of economic<br />
circumstances we have had in 30 years.<br />
RM: So the people who rang up A Current Affair today when it was<br />
announced that you were coming on tonight, and said " ask about<br />
home loan interest rates" in a word what would you say to them?<br />
Don't worry?<br />
PM: I would say this that they have seen already a modest increase in<br />
interest rates, part of that has flowed through to housing, a bit more<br />
maybe but we will not see a repeat of the housing rates of the<br />
1980s.<br />
RM: If I asked you how a man who has been a politician all his working life<br />
for 25 years can afford to pay over $ 2 million for his house what<br />
would you say to me?<br />
PM: Easy, from my point of view. Basically, I'm like most other people in<br />
the Sydney market your house goes up in value and you end up<br />
with a big mortgage at the end of it.<br />
RM: So you are very much watching as everyone else is you're<br />
watching these interest rates because you could....<br />
PM: Well, I know what it's going to do to me. I mean, there's at least more<br />
than an observers interest there. I mean, I have one house in the<br />
whole of Australia a terrace house in Sydney the whole world has<br />
heard about it, and I'm intending....<br />
RM: Not a bad sort of a terrace house though....<br />
PM: No, but it was a flop-house when I bought it. It had 40 beds and<br />
hypodermics and joints laying all over the place when I moved in...<br />
RM: There's about 16 million Australians who wouldn't mind having it<br />
though would they?<br />
PM: No, but again, I bought it 12 years ago, and you know what has<br />
happened in the Sydney property market in 12 years. And it's </p>
<p>because I own that, that I can go from that house.... basically what I<br />
am doing is moving houses by one mile, and I'm moving up a bit with<br />
a mortgage.<br />
RM: Up a bit, with a $ 2 million place...<br />
PM: With a mortgage from one worth about $ 1.25 million to $ 2 million.<br />
RM: But you don't think that as a dyed in the wool Labor man a working<br />
class man that you have got to go sort of in the dark at night to go to<br />
Woollahra where<br />
PM: No. Because I have had 2 houses in my life. I had one in<br />
Bankstown....<br />
RM: How long ago was that?<br />
PM: I sold that in 1983 when I became Treasurer...<br />
RM: Right.<br />
PM: and I bought the terrace I now own at the same time, and that's all I<br />
have. And I will sell that as time goes by, and move into this other<br />
one. But again, I am not moving into it it's there for later. I'll let it<br />
because I'm quite happy with my current accommodation.<br />
RM: So you will rent it? You are quite happy to rent it and...( inaudible) all<br />
that sort of stuff?<br />
PM: Well you can't live in The Lodge and live in Woollahra at the same<br />
you have got to make your choice, and my choice is a pretty easy one<br />
to make.<br />
RM: How much rent can you get for a place in Woollahra?<br />
PM: Oh, a couple of thousand a week $ 2,500 $ 3000 a week.<br />
RM: That's not bad for a working class boy from Bankstown?<br />
PM: Well, that's what an old friend of mine used to say: " in the Labor Party<br />
Paul, we don't want to push people down, we want to bring them all<br />
up".<br />
RM: Have you ever lied in politics, like Graham Richardson?<br />
PM: You don't need to tell lies. I'm surprised....<br />
RM: Well, Richo says you can't be successful unless you tell lies?<br />
PM: I'm surprised Graham thinks that, frankly. I think you can I tend to<br />
take it on the chin and say it as it is. I mean, I'd rather say the thing<br />
that is less popular than mislead people. </p>
<p>RM: How do you tell of a politician is lying, Paul?<br />
PM: I don't know whether you can tell, but you can look at their work, that's<br />
the best way to do it. I don't know whether Graham put this line in the<br />
book for notoriety or not, but it is not a line I subscribe to.<br />
RM: Have you ever lied in politics?<br />
PM: No, I have never gone and said something I believed to be untrue.<br />
RM: How about the challenge, the first challenge against Bob Hawke,<br />
where you lost it and you came out on television and said that ' I have<br />
only got one shot in the locker and I've used it', but in fact you had two.<br />
PM: Well, later I had two, but I didn't at the time. At the time I thought that<br />
was it. You see, it is very hard to dislodge a Prime Minister. You can<br />
have one go at it and then what happened was, what basically beat<br />
Bob was Fightback. That's where I came from.<br />
RM: So, when you said that you meant it?<br />
PM: I was prepared to, when the Parliament rose at the end of 1991 that<br />
was the end for me. By early 1992 I would have left the Parliament.<br />
RM: Lazarus.<br />
PM: Well, they got me right at the end, but they knew they did too.<br />
RM: Are you pleased to read today in the paper or to hear that Prince<br />
Charles sees you as a kindred spirit?<br />
PM: He says I have got an interest in architecture and aesthetics.<br />
RM: And urban design?<br />
PM: There is not much in terms of central interests we share, but that is one<br />
of them.<br />
RM: But, are you pleased that he regards you as a kindred spirit?<br />
PM: Glad he has acknowledged the fact that I have I mean, his criticism<br />
of modern architecture in Britain has been somewhat akin to the<br />
criticisms that I have had in the design of our cities here.<br />
RM: The Cahill Expressway and so on?<br />
PM: Well, the Cahill Expressway is just an example, and I think he has<br />
done quite a lot for the architectural debate in Britain and I am quite<br />
happy for him to nominate me as a kindred spirit. </p>
<p>RM: Well, how about what he said, he told Jonathan Dimbleby that he was<br />
relieved to find you not as bad as he had imagined.<br />
PM: He got a very nice reception from me and my family and I from him<br />
when I visited him and his family at Balmoral. I have always found the<br />
Royal Family, in terms of personal relations, exceptionally nice to deal<br />
with.<br />
RM: What about when he said ' what do you mean when he said that you<br />
were a great exponent of the art of monologue'. Does that mean you<br />
wouldn't let him talk?<br />
PM: He is a good talker, I don't know that too many people get too many<br />
words past him. So, maybe he'll regard it as a bit of tussle, I don't<br />
know.<br />
RM: Would you accuse him of the same thing?<br />
PM: Yes, he is a good chatterer. He has got a lot to say, but good on him.<br />
RM: A republic by the Year 2000, has the pace quickened as we read?<br />
PM: I don't think the pace has quickened, but I am delighted to see more<br />
Australians believing that we can only go our own way with our own<br />
head of state.<br />
RM: Have the Royal scandals added to that, increased the number of<br />
people believing?<br />
PM: I think so, yes. I think that is part of it, but I think underlying it, that's<br />
part of it. But, I think the underlying thing is that, I think, Australians<br />
know we are making I am going to as you know Ray, to APEC in<br />
Indonesia in a week and a half from now and you can't get around like<br />
that saying ' oh, excuse me, we are just borrowing the monarchy of<br />
another country.'<br />
RM: You would like our own flag and our own head of state at a time like<br />
this?<br />
PM: I want our own republic. That is the first thing I want.<br />
RM: All right. Now, it is clear certainly from The Bulletin this week, that<br />
per cent of Australians want to elect the president, not allow politicians<br />
like you to decide who it is. How are you going to turn them around on<br />
that?<br />
PM: Sometimes people say ' well, that Keating, he wants this republic so he<br />
can appoint the president'.<br />
RM: Or maybe be president </p>
<p>PM: You know how interviewers are always asking you to rule things out<br />
well, let me rule that out.<br />
RM: OK.<br />
PM: And that you will give one of the popular guarantees I'll give a<br />
guarantee on that.<br />
RM: Never be president?<br />
PM: Never be president.<br />
RM: OK.<br />
PM: But, on the issue itself, I think, this is a terribly strong thing for our<br />
democracies that you don't have figures who are walking around,<br />
hearing voices, saying ' I've been anointed by the Gods', I'm wearing a<br />
national mandate, I have some position of supra authority above the<br />
Parliament and the whole embodiment of a nation is invested in me.<br />
RM: All right, last question. Jeff Kennett, I know you will want to answer<br />
this, says that you made no real attempt to save David Wilson in<br />
Cambodia a tough charge.<br />
PM: And a very low grade charge at that. Jeffrey has got a big mouth and it<br />
runs away from him every second week. We did everything we could<br />
possibly do. We sent an AFP officer out there, the diplomatic effort we<br />
mounted on this through the Cambodian government was as strong as<br />
we have ever done, but again, you are dealing with rebel forces in a<br />
dangerous part of the world.<br />
RM: All right. We thank you for your time and good luck in Indonesia too.<br />
ends </p>
