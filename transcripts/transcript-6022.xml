AS DELIVERED<br />
J)<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR~ MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 16 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
BUSINESSMEN'S BREAKFAST, MELBOURNE<br />
I indicated last night that the choice before us all on 5 March<br />
was a very clear one and I would have thought the choice was<br />
also very clear for the business community of this city and<br />
right around Australia. I was talking last night of the<br />
initiatives that we have already put in place to respond to<br />
three things: the world recession hitting Australia after<br />
we had held it off longer than in any other country and<br />
secondly to the drought, and thirdly to ohe of the worst<br />
wages explosions that we have had, well the worst since<br />
Mr Hawke was Presid~ ent of the ACTU in 1973 and 1974. The one<br />
common thread in those two things is that he was President of<br />
the ACTU then and the wages explosion of the last two years<br />
was a direct expression of ACTU policy laid down in 1979 when<br />
he was there.<br />
The main thrust of the Policy Speech was to provide expanded<br />
opportunities to young Australians. It is our intention in<br />
a number of key areas to establish youth projects which will<br />
provide additional opportunities and particularly, additional<br />
opportunities for young Australians who might riot be gettiing<br />
much of a go under present Government programs. In addition<br />
to that4 what I was saying last night was directed towards<br />
building up Australia's business strength for the future.<br />
We know quite well. that you cannot have a situation in which<br />
you rely on thie exports of farming products and you rely on th. o<br />
exports of minerals and that is the end of it. There has<br />
to be a strong manufacturing, business and commercial sector<br />
in Australia and we have to have policies to make sure that<br />
it grows and is innovative and is not only able to get a<br />
better share of markets, but at the same time that it will<br />
go out and create new markets.<br />
The decisions we made last July of greatly improving depreciation<br />
, provisions were obviously designed to help. In the c1rcumset.-in c<br />
that have-prevailedi, that we are presently in, I don't thnk<br />
anyone expects a mad rush of new investbprnts simply as a resnl L;<br />
of those measures even though thcy a are great improveme~ nt over<br />
what was there before. When the opportuniity for new investicnt<br />
does come, those depreciation provisions are clearly going to<br />
bring forward decisions that otherwise might still have been<br />
deferred. / 2 </p>
<p>Bus Break.<br />
Of course the wage pause itself is an integral part of our<br />
total policy. As we went through the year we had introduced<br />
the Budget which was designed to encourage wage moderation<br />
because it greatly improved the position of Australian families<br />
by about $ 18 a week in many typical cases. By the end of<br />
the year it was clear that that alone was not enough, that<br />
it was going to take too long to re-establish the competitive<br />
face of Australian industry and therefore a wage pause which<br />
all Australian Governments, including three Labor Governments<br />
are in agreement with.<br />
One of the very odd things about the Labor Party in this election<br />
is that they are going forward on a campaign of bringing<br />
Australia together or reconciliation when they are the only<br />
odd man out, because all the governments, including three<br />
Labor Governments agree with the wage pause. The Federal<br />
Labor Party do not. The Federal Labor Party and particularly<br />
their Deputy Leader, Lionel Bowen deliberately encouraged disputes<br />
in the oil industry. The Shell refinery was shut and clearly<br />
if that situation had been allowed to develop, this State and<br />
Australia would have dried up of fuel and many tens of thousands<br />
of people would have had to be laid off as industries shut.<br />
The official position of the Federal Labor Party was that the<br />
strike was justified and only to be expected and that they<br />
supported it. I think that gives a pretty good indication of<br />
what would happen after March 5, if Labor happened to win, which<br />
of course they are not. There was a report in the Geelong<br />
Advertiser a few days ago which indicated that one of the<br />
electricians from the ETU had said they had a commitment to go<br />
quiet until 5 March, the implication then being that they<br />
would get what they want. That 8% of course would start<br />
a new wage round and it is just not on so far as Australia is<br />
concerned. A number of the proposals that were put forward last night were<br />
obviously designed to assist small businesses in particular, a<br />
reduced rate of company tax, but the advance payment of<br />
on the purchase of Australian produced goods from all Government<br />
purchasing. I think that would be improving the liquidity of<br />
Australian firms by about $ 70 million. It is a one-off payment<br />
drawing forward of course, but it would have certainly improved<br />
the liquidity of Australian firms in a quite immediate way.<br />
The proposal that I believe has considerable imagination attached<br />
to it is for an advanced technology corporation. Sometimes<br />
new proposals are developed, new products are developed in this<br />
country to a certain extent, then the control of the developr. er: t<br />
goes somewhere else. I have been told computer firms, for ai. ck<br />
, of capital, have not been able to expand and maybe have gone out<br />
of business. I have been given specific cases of p. eople with<br />
good products, being able to sell, but not being able to maintain<br />
Australian control and Australian development because of the<br />
financial structure and the shortage or risk of venture capital<br />
in Australia. Therefore, we are proposing that an advanced<br />
technology corporation be established. It won't be Government<br />
bureaucracy. It is proposed we establish guidelines and that<br />
there be a management board a bit like the Aussat board for the<br />
establishment of the satellite and we call tenders for the<br />
management of the corporation. Capital would be attracted tuo . he<br />
2 16.2.83 </p>
<p>Bus Break. 3 16.2.83<br />
corporation by 100% tax deductibility for approved projects and<br />
the purpose of the corporation would be to bring innovators in<br />
touch, or give them advice in relation to markets, developments of<br />
new markets, the availability of finance, the capacity to gain<br />
finance and product development laboratories and to advise<br />
Government on progress that is made.<br />
This is something new in Australia but it is designed to establish<br />
the circumstance where small businesses with good ideas will be<br />
able to attract the capital and the development facilities to<br />
see that their ideas are put into practice in Australia. It is<br />
a new venture. In a sense it is experimental so far<br />
as we are concerned. I think it i s the kind of thing that is<br />
necessary. We have examined in detail what might be done to<br />
help further encourage high technology industries in Australia<br />
and we wanted to avoid the approach which said Government is<br />
going to select this industry or that industry or that product<br />
and some other product because if governments are going to make<br />
those choices, I am quite certain they will make those<br />
choices very badly indeed. Of course the approach that<br />
we are adopting in this particular matter leaves the initiative<br />
in the hands of the Australian entrepreneurs, in the hands<br />
of Australian private enterprise where in fact it ought to be.<br />
We are also going to establish a special division of the<br />
Development Bank with initial additional capital of $ 25 million<br />
to expand lending for small business. It is worth noting that<br />
since the charter of the bank was adjusted some time ago,<br />
the bank has lent about $ 100 million for small business undertakings.<br />
That has not attracted a great deal of publicity, but the<br />
lending is obviously useful. We want to build upon that.<br />
Industrial relations is something that clearly worries all Australians.<br />
We have determined on changes. Ian Macphee has come to the view<br />
that Federal industrial power is inadequate, that the Arbitration<br />
Commission ought to be given authority for the maintenance of its<br />
own awards and agreements. Some of you will remember that that<br />
was taken away from the Commission in a famous High Court case,<br />
I think it went to the Privy Council at the time, in the 1950s,<br />
a very long while ago. Now we want to redress that situation<br />
and reinforce the authority of the Commission. That does not<br />
have any implication fora more or less centralised system. It won't<br />
in any sense reduce or diminish the need for entrepreneurs<br />
-or businesses to look after their own industrial relations to<br />
the maximum extent that they can, but if the Cormmission is to<br />
make awards or register agreements that have the force of law<br />
as effectively they now do, then it is a fairly widely held view<br />
that the Commision should also have authority to seeing that those<br />
awards and agreements are in fact maintained.<br />
Our secret ballot legislation will be extended to the election of<br />
all union officials, not just some as is the case at the moment and<br />
also to enable the Commission, or if necessary the Government<br />
to order in relation certain industries that secret ballots apply<br />
before any industrial action takes place.<br />
I-M A VI CL. I I I </p>
<p>Bus Break<br />
. The Labor Party in its official platform would seek to place<br />
unions above and beyond the reach of law. That is perfectly<br />
plain and not only to free them in relation to industrial ntteis,<br />
but also to recognise that they have a political role beyond<br />
industrial matters, which would be<br />
recognised by an Australian Labor Party in a way which I<br />
believe would give even more power to the trade union movement.<br />
I don't think that is acceptable in Australia.<br />
If somebody wants to seek consensus with the trade union leadership,<br />
does anyone really believe that you can get to a sensible<br />
consensus with the Painters and Dockers, with the Halfpennys of<br />
this world, with the Carmichaels of this world or even with the<br />
Mr Gallaghers of this world. The kind of consensus that they<br />
would want with you is after they had run over you with a<br />
bulldozer. I don't really think that kind of approach is going<br />
to work with that kind of union leadership. Tt does not apply<br />
to all unions by any means, but to suggest that the unions<br />
can be set aside from the framework of law would be to suggest<br />
anarchy in its worst form.<br />
The policy approach that we have adopted for this election is<br />
a prudent one. There is clearly some additional expenditure and<br />
in the areas that I have mentioned that are of importance to<br />
business, that is included. But at the same time, this is not<br />
the sort of election in which anyone can with responsibility<br />
go out and say we are going to spend $ 2.75 billion over and<br />
above what is now being spent. By some slight of hand that is<br />
immediately turned into $ 1 billion and I think it remarkable that<br />
the press accept that reduction just on the say so of the person<br />
making the cormnent. $ 2.75 billion is $ 2.75 billion in anyone's<br />
language. The actual figure would probably be significantly<br />
more than that but it is impossible to tell. After the Policy<br />
Speech it might be possible to do some work in relation to it,<br />
but that so-called economic document the other day was<br />
so vague that it is not really possible to test whether the<br />
$ 2.75 billion is somewhere ntear ctc( ul'dt or wheLher it might<br />
be something the order of twice of that. One of the things that<br />
is clear is the policy of spend, spend again and spend again.<br />
That was the policy that Mr Whitlam adopted and I am told that<br />
Bob Hawke has the ambition to beat Mr Whitlam's biggest spending<br />
increase. In one of his Budgets, Mr Whitlam lifted expenditure by 46%<br />
in one year. I am told that it is Mr Hawke's objective to<br />
have a bigger increase that Mr Whitlam because it is Mr Whitla's<br />
record that he wants to beat. If it is Mr Whitlam's record<br />
, that he wants to beat, I don't think there is much doubt what<br />
the people of Australia would have to say about that. It is<br />
worth noting that Mr Whitlam himself has been very frank, and<br />
very plain and I very believe thoroughly helpful in what he<br />
has been saying about this particular election. Hie says: " there<br />
is no doubt what the public thinks of me ( that is Mr hi. tlam)<br />
compared to Mr Fraser and the more the Labor Party carmpaign<br />
makes clear Labor will pick up where we left off,( that is<br />
where Mr Whitlami left off) the better we will do."<br />
I think if Whitlam goes on saying that Mr Hawke is going to pick<br />
up where Mr Whitlam left off, then or majority will be<br />
significantly larger after 5 March. 4 16.2.83 </p>
<p>Bus Break<br />
There is the old question of where money is going to come<br />
from for a policy of course or to fulfill a policy cominitment<br />
and Paul Keating has given an instance of that. He says " We have<br />
massive savings locked up in the banking system which the<br />
Commonwealth could quite easily fund this sort of deficit, and<br />
get the Australian economy moving again." Savings locked up<br />
in the banking system, doing nothing I don't know how many<br />
bankers there are here, but they will be overjoyed to hear<br />
that. All the depositers, people have their savings in the<br />
bank will be even more overjoyed to hear it and small businesses<br />
and people who have housing loans, they also I suppose will be<br />
overjoyed. There are only two ways that I could see and probably<br />
only one of them legal whereby they could get the funds: introduce<br />
some funny bonds which they were talking about in the policy<br />
speech, enormously lift interest rates on Government paper<br />
and make life very easy for the stockmarket as one or two<br />
people have indicated. Lifting interest rates massively could<br />
attract the funds of course, but at great penalty to small<br />
businesses and at great penalty to home builders, home buyers<br />
of all kinds, at great penalty to everyone with loans of a moving<br />
rate of interest.<br />
That would be one way in which the Commonwealth could get a<br />
much larger share of funds which are there and which are mostly<br />
being used. Then, I suppose they could try the old Labor way<br />
of some sort of legal change, or some sort of change which<br />
would enable them to direct the banks as to where they leant<br />
and direct them in a very regulatory manner. Either way<br />
there would be a great many people hurt as a result right around<br />
the Australian community and the small businesses, home<br />
purchasers, financial markets would be under enormous disruption<br />
as a result of all of that.<br />
It is worth noting, and I think it is a question that you need<br />
to ask, that whenever Mr Hawke has been pressed for details<br />
about the policy, he ha.; tried to suggest that there is somethingr<br />
wrong in asking for details. He said those miserable conservatives,<br />
they always get out their calculators. If somebody who want! s<br />
to become Prime Minister is going to take a certain amount of<br />
money out of everyone's pocket, isn't it reasonable to ask<br />
how deep he wants to put his hand in your pockets? You cannot<br />
get away with just saying, " Just forget that, the details don't<br />
matter. All we want is billions and it will be a nice pleasant<br />
process." Really that approach just is not good enough.<br />
The Labor Party has not yet unfolded what they are calling<br />
a prices and incomes policy and I'believe it will be tinsel<br />
without much substance to it. They have been trying to get<br />
agreement with the union movement for the best part of a year.<br />
The launch date has been postponed on many, many occasions,<br />
simply because they have not been able to get agreement.<br />
Whatever comes out that can be examined at the time. Since<br />
this has in a very real sense become a centrel point to<br />
whatever policies they may or may not put forward, one would<br />
have thought that they have done some work about prices and<br />
incomes policies in other countries to see if they have worked<br />
or failed, but at least they would know the history of it all.<br />
/ 6<br />

<p>Bus. Break<br />
Four Corners did us a good turn some time ago by asking Mr Fawke<br />
questions about this in relation to Britian for example and<br />
he said in a way that was intended to silence the questioners,<br />
" Oh, no there have been no prices and incomes in Britain".<br />
Shirley Williams who was administering a prices and incomes<br />
policy for quite some time then had something to say on radio<br />
yesterday or the day before, making it perfectly plain that<br />
there was a strict policy applying to prices, applying to incomes<br />
and one which in fact had many penalties across the board<br />
or companies that broke the regime. She went on to point<br />
out that it had not done-Britain any good because companies<br />
under that regime had to reduce investment and that had<br />
medium to long term damage to the economy inherent in it and<br />
in addition to that, she made it plain that the unions did not<br />
stick with it and it led to what they call their winter of<br />
discontent and massive disruption of a kind that even this<br />
country has not experienced.<br />
Samuel Brittain was asked what advice he would give to any<br />
Australian who wanted to apply such a policy and he just<br />
tersely said " Forget it". The interesting point about this<br />
debate is that there was, and has been a comprehensive<br />
prices and incomes policy in Britain and Mr Hawke claimed<br />
to be in ignorance of it. Let's accept that claim, but<br />
being ignorance of it, surely it indicates very sloppy<br />
workmanship over something that is regarded as central to their<br />
policy. I suspect that most people here don't think much of<br />
that sort of policy anyway. But if.. a political party<br />
wants to advance it as something serious, then surely they<br />
have an obligation to have done their homework and not to<br />
dismiss facts and historical evidence as airily as Mr Hawke does.<br />
There is one other point that I think is relevant in coming<br />
to judgements in this campaign. This is the first time in the<br />
history of Australia I think where people have been asked to<br />
vote for somebody who has got no Parliamentary record and<br />
therefore you cannot make a judgement about that. It is<br />
fair enough therefore, to look at the record of earlier times<br />
and see what in fact happened. I have pointed out on more than<br />
one occasion that the time lost through industrial disputes when<br />
Mr Hawke was President of the ACTU, was three to four times<br />
greater than in the previous eleven years under his predecessor<br />
and that is worth noting. The worst occasion was when Mr Hawke<br />
was President of the ACTU movement, President of the union<br />
movement and when Mr Whitlara was Prime Minister, when over<br />
six million man days were lost in one year and over the whole<br />
period, over 34 million man days were lost.<br />
' The Financial Review has in very sharp compass questioned the<br />
credentials of Hawke and I suppose you might say they arc a<br />
little more objective than I am in some of these things, but<br />
I always think my politics is totally objective. The Financial<br />
Review said, " The very first thing that needs to be said<br />
about MR Hawke's decade at the head of the ACTU is that it has<br />
been a decade of barren failure". And it was Mr Whitlam who<br />
said, " I would think that any person who is the head or<br />
spokesman of a great political or industrial movement would c:<br />
able to show something for ten years effort." Well there are<br />
if you like two impartial observers. One must ask whether that<br />
6 16.2.83 </p>
<p>Bus Break<br />
is a reasonable credential for the most significant job that<br />
Australia has to offer. I believe it is not a credential and<br />
if people think that it is, they will be taking a risk with this<br />
country of a kind that they have never experienced in all their<br />
lives. I know many of us are gamblers when we go to the races, but I<br />
don't think when it really gets down to it, that we are gamblers<br />
with the future of this country and with the future of our<br />
children. The Labor Party have the gall and the hide to come<br />
here asking Australians to put a mark on a bit of paper as a<br />
result of the biggest gamble ever. That is not a reasonable<br />
proposition. Through the course of the last 12 months we have put many policies<br />
in place, policies to assist homebuyers through last year, policies<br />
to assist industry, in the Budget policies to assist Australian<br />
families in particular and make the request for wage restraint<br />
a reasonable one. Then the wage pause and since then we have<br />
announced the major new water resource program and every day<br />
is living reminder of the importance of that program to Australia<br />
as things stand at the moment with the current drought. We are<br />
also building for the future in improving road transport through<br />
the Bicentennial Road Program, lowering the cost of transport<br />
for industry and making it easier for all of us to get about this<br />
country and also last night I announced the Commonwealth suppot<br />
for tome remaining rail standardisation projects which would<br />
link certain ports in Victoria and Queensland in particular<br />
to the standard guage link and again designed to reduce<br />
the cost of transport.<br />
I believe we are doing sensible, prudent tdhigs for the develop: rment<br />
of this country. I have said on a number of occasions recently<br />
that we cannot sit back and say there is nothing we can do in<br />
Australia until there is world recovery, until something moves<br />
in the United States because while commentators say all. ort of<br />
things about when that might occur, it is not good enough for<br />
Australians to sit back and wait for other people. We have<br />
to do what we can on our own account and I believe that the<br />
Government has taken substantial and sensible decisions<br />
in relation to that over the last 12 months. I also believe<br />
, that our policies were advanced quite considerably and sensi:-ly<br />
in relation to business and small business last night.<br />
Our slogan, " we are not waiting for the world" I think is an ai:<br />
one, it is appropriate. I also believe it be very unecessary<br />
in today's circumstances. 7 16.2.83<br />
