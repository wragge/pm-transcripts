Q.-<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 MAY 1979<br />
VISIT OF VICE-PRESIDENT GUNDELACH TO AUSTRALIA<br />
The Vice-President of the E. E. C. Commission, Mr. F. O. Gundelach,<br />
will visit Australia in the wcck commencing May 28, as guest<br />
of the Australian Government.<br />
Mr. Gundelach's visit is the result of an initiative I took with<br />
President Jenkins of the E. E. C. Commission in June 1977 to<br />
resolve trade differences between Australia and the E. E. C.<br />
As the Commissioner within the E. E. C. Commission responsible<br />
for agriculture, Mr. Gundelach has been a key figure in the<br />
important bilateral trade negotiations between Australia and<br />
the European Community in the context of the MTN. These<br />
negotiations are expected to be finalised during the course<br />
of Mr. Gundelach's visit.<br />
The European Community is the world's largest trading bloc<br />
and the policies it pursue in the agricultural area are<br />
of critical importance to major agricultural exporting<br />
countries like Australia.<br />
A close working relationship has developed between Mr. Gundelach<br />
and the Australian Minister for Special Trade Representations,<br />
Mr. R. V. Garland, who has been personally engaged in high<br />
level negotititions with the E. E. C. Commission and the<br />
key Ministers in E. E. C. member states.<br />
I am hopeful the long and difficult negotiations will produce<br />
a settlement that provides Australia with significant<br />
improvements in the conditions of trade in the European Community<br />
for a number of important rural commodities, and I look<br />
forward to meeting Mr. Gundelach during his visit.<br />
Apart from his final round of discussions with Mr. Garland,<br />
Mr. Gundelach will also be having discussions with the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources,<br />
Mr. Anthony, and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr. Sinclair.<br />
