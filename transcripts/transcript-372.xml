SPEECH 3Y THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES, AT THE ANNUAL FEDERAL COUNCIL<br />
MEETING OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, AT CANBERRA,<br />
2TH SEPTEMBER, 1961<br />
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I must begin by agreeing with the President, not for<br />
the first time, that we can look forward, I believe, with no kind<br />
of pessimism, to the electoral events of the future. It is quite<br />
true that we have a very great problem in the Senate a problem<br />
rendered, on the whole, more difficult by some recent unhappy<br />
events. But that means that we must concentrate our attention<br />
more than we ever have before on the Senate vote, and on the<br />
Senate voting. I know that the Federal Executive has had this<br />
very much in mind; I know that some of the State Executives, at<br />
least, have. When one considers the number of informal votes<br />
that come to be put into the ballot box in a Senate Election it<br />
is a pretty serious reflection on the intelligence of our people;<br />
and a pretty serious reflection on the effect that we have had in<br />
making, at any rate, our own supporters understand how to vote.<br />
Because don't let us be superior about this: it is pretty safe<br />
to say that a good half of the informal votes are cast by people<br />
of our political persuasion. And indeed, perhaps more, A lot<br />
of work will have to be done. All of -s who go and make speeches<br />
in the campaign are not to be content just to feel that on the<br />
platform somewhere the names of the three Senate candidates are<br />
displayed. I think we want to make a great resolution that every<br />
time we speak, before we conclude, we will say something dut<br />
the Senate vote, we will say something about the Senate<br />
candidate, and draw specific attention to how you can make an<br />
effective vote in tnoir favour. I say that to all my brother<br />
practising politicians, to all candidates, and to all those who<br />
will be speaking in support of candidates.<br />
Now I want, if I may, to do what I usually have done in<br />
the past on this occasion, to say something about one or two<br />
issues overseas, one or two external problems, and something<br />
about internal problems. I will take the external ones first<br />
because as it happens we have, in the last few weeks, almost in<br />
the last few days, been witnessing the occurrence of events<br />
which will have a profound effect on the future of the world.<br />
First of all we have seen the tragic death of the<br />
Secretary-General of the United Nations. Now the Secretary-<br />
General of the United Nations occupies a post, the full<br />
significance of which may not have been seen when the United<br />
Nations was established. But as time has gone on he has become<br />
the chief functionary of the United Nations; he has become, in<br />
a true sense, its Chief Executive Officer; and, in a very large<br />
degree a director of operations which occur under the United<br />
Nations: a species of what shall I say? managing director<br />
with rather more power than the average managing director would<br />
possess, The result has been that whenever the Security Council<br />
has passed a resolution and that does happen occasionally<br />
whenever the General Assembly has passed a resolution, and the<br />
Secretary-General has been instructed to take certain step, it<br />
has been he who has been going to the spot, who has been trying<br />
to bring contending parties together, trying to arrive at some<br />
means of pacification in some part of the world. While Mro<br />
Hammarskjoeld had his critics I was guilty of crit: icising him<br />
myself more than once I think that everybody outside theSoviet<br />
Union regarded him as a man of great integrity and remarkable<br />
talent And now there is no Socretary-CGenral, Now there is, I<br />
imagine, a species of paralysis in the administration of the<br />
United Nations. And this is the great opportunity for Khrushchev; </p>
<p>Last year in Noveibor, at the Assembly, you will renmemnber<br />
that he devo ed most of his efforts to attacking the<br />
Socretary-General, to attacking the principle if a single Sacrctmy<br />
-Gonoral and of advocating what has now becorac familiar as the<br />
troika the throoee horses driven abreast. He said there ought to<br />
be three Secrotarios-Goncral, one fron the Communist countries<br />
ano fron the West, and one from the so-called uncomnitted countrit<br />
each of tho with a power of vote. In other words three<br />
Secrotarics-Geneoal unable to take a single doecision, or mako a<br />
single step, without unaninity.<br />
Well, of course, as everybody knew, anI as he knew we<br />
know, this was a more attack upon the existence of the United<br />
Nations. The whole idea was to render it complotely futile<br />
because, of course, Comunism flourishes in tr. ublod waters and any<br />
organisatich which enajos the support of 99 or 100 nations in the<br />
world, ost of whom want to have peace is sonmething that stands in<br />
the way of Communist aggrossion. So all of us understood at that<br />
time in New York that this was an attack on the existence of the<br />
United N.. tions certainly upon its capacity to function. I an<br />
hoping very nuch that this icok when the great -o there to speak<br />
they will make it quite clear that the troika principle in the<br />
Unital , a1tions is intolerable and will, under no circumstances, be<br />
accepted. It is about time that Khrushchov was nad to understand<br />
quite clearly that there is a point beyond which he can't go,<br />
Anyhow this is his great opportunity.<br />
And while this is occurring, and while thoSO threat wiil<br />
be nmade and manoouvros performed, thoro will be gr.. at agitation,<br />
great pressure: " But we haven't a Secrotary-General, vo'e ust do<br />
sonothing otherwise the whole thing will become paralysod". You<br />
seeo the traedy of it? All the pressure will be in favour of a<br />
quick cou-pronise: we nust have sonmobody, And that is t* ie time in<br />
life when you are liable to make errors, and to be forced into<br />
positions that you wouldn't want to adopt under any other circunstances.<br />
Therefore we are going to witness a very significant woad<br />
in United Nations history, and therefore in the history of the<br />
world, since the Great War.<br />
Now while that is goin on we have had some ron.-iarkable<br />
experiences in Great Britain and, to a trifling extent, in<br />
Australia. You all renomber that at the last Prime Ministers?<br />
Confeounce we unaninously said, in a decl. aration about disarr. cancnt,<br />
that the first thing to do was to bring about a suspension of<br />
nuclear tests because, as we said, the danger didn't so much arise<br />
from the groat responsible powers which have the bonb as it would<br />
arise fror2 the oxtonsion of this power to other countries less<br />
responsiblo and therefore more likely to bring about, by accident<br />
or by design, some groat world conflict. The right way to do that<br />
was to got an areoonent betoon the great powers, the nuclear<br />
powers, that they would not have any mor tests either in the air<br />
or below the surface, It sounded rather sin1ple. They had been<br />
working on it in Geneva for a long tie; they had got within<br />
measurablo distance of each other; there wore some argunants left<br />
about the nature of the inspection body and how many inspectors<br />
there ought to be and what the nature of the r. anc-ging c cmnittoo<br />
ought to be. But on the principle that you ought to suspond these<br />
tests, on the principle that there ought to be internati-nal control,<br />
on the principle that there ought to bb some effective intoe-<br />
-national inspection to soo that the agroieont was being carried<br />
out on these natters there was no disagreement in principlo at al,<br />
Well you know what has happened. The Soviet Union,<br />
having gone alon nmonth after nonth, nonth after nonth, sparring<br />
for tinme, agroing to somthing and then cancelling its areOcont<br />
a few weeks lator, having alnmost exhausted the patience of the<br />
Western world, but not copltely, suddonly announces that it is<br />
going to renew its tosting and poops off six or seven testing<br />
explosions within the next three or four days. </p>
<p>Now I have had something to say about that in another<br />
place. But I want to say something about it in another<br />
connection today. Aren't we a strange lot of people in te<br />
Western world? I think we are probably more sensible than most<br />
because so far we haven't had anybody attempting to organse<br />
10,000 people to sit down and disrupt the traffic of a city.<br />
What for? Because they are against the bomb. We had a poor<br />
bediaggled remnant who came up here to Canberra the otherday; I<br />
gathered from somebody that they were on the same lineo They<br />
don't go to the Kremlin; they don't go to the people who alone<br />
have shown that they don't want to ban the testing of bombs, the<br />
one group of people who have absolutely ruined the world's<br />
prospects of cutting off further tests. They don't go to then,<br />
no. They sit down in the heart of London just making nuisances<br />
of themselves, challenging the police to take action about them.<br />
What do they think, if they think at all? It can't be<br />
very easy to think if you are squatting in Trafalgar Square, or<br />
in Parliament Place. But let us assume that they think,, What do<br />
they think they think? Do they bla: me the Government of Great<br />
Britain for the fact that there are nuclear tests going on? Or<br />
are they, in fact, whether they know it or not, weakening the<br />
resolution of the Western world and conveying to Khrushchev and<br />
his people the belief that there is an enormous body of ornion<br />
in Great Britain which believes that Great Britain ought :-ot to<br />
be in the nuclear business, and that Great Britain will not<br />
dream of using nuclear weapons, and that in Great Britain there<br />
is a wave of pacifism which is completely inconsistont ~: ith the<br />
will to fight the will to defend? That is what they are<br />
conveying to the Soviet Union. In short, these nisguidedy~ ople<br />
are increasing the danger of war, not reducing it. And t1hat I<br />
think is something that we have to have very very clearly in niLLd<br />
If the complaint is that there are tests of bombs,<br />
whose fault is that? If the proposal is that we should, in the<br />
West and I use that word comprehensively because we don't have<br />
nuclear weapons in Australia but if the proposal is that the<br />
West should throw away nuclear weapons because of the appalling<br />
character of a nuclear war, then all I can say is, to use the<br />
famous old phrase that was used about George Lansbury once in<br />
the Sunday Observer, " This is the very ecstasy of suicide"<br />
because it would be.<br />
Bury all the nuclear , weapons deep in the sea if you<br />
can bury these wriched things deep in the sea put theo cut of<br />
the mind of man, put them out of the capacity of man to produce,<br />
put then out of existence in themselves., and the result would be<br />
that in terms of what we are pleased to call conventional trces,<br />
the Soviet Union plus the satellites could dominate Europe,<br />
could overrun Europe in a few days, And that is not a position<br />
that the Western world wants to be in.<br />
There is another matter which is, in a sense, external<br />
to us I want to say very little about it and this i-the<br />
discussion that is about to begin over the Common Markct. I am<br />
not going to rehearse the arguments you have all had the<br />
opportunity at any rate of hearing the views of the Government,<br />
and of reading a pretty carefally composed statement that I made<br />
on the matter myself but I would like to tell you, ii. a<br />
summary way, what the procedure is.<br />
At this moment we have officials in London and they are<br />
having a lot of discussions on coi modities it may be butter,<br />
it may be dried fruits, it may be canned fruits, neat wheato<br />
All the various commodities that are involved in our Lrade<br />
pattern have boon under discussion beot'ion our people and . ther<br />
Commonwealth people and the officials in Groat Britain, Not with<br />
the idea that the Britisii officials can say " Well, that is what </p>
<p>we are going to get for you" because they don't know what they<br />
can get; not that our people are saying " If you got that we are<br />
quite satisfied". But the real thing is that they are exploring<br />
the ground and examining how far it might be possible to deal<br />
with this connodity in terns of tariff, or how far with that<br />
commodity in terms of quota, or with that other coanuodity in<br />
terms of some special levy arrangement. There are myriads of<br />
fashions in which these natters can be dealt with. And they are<br />
having, therefore, exploratory talks.<br />
But before long the negotiations with the Six will<br />
begin, It is anybody's guess as to how long they will takeÃ¸<br />
The first estimate that came to us was that once begun they might<br />
take nine months. There are some now who think that they might<br />
not take so long as that, that there night be either sudden<br />
agreement or sudden disagreement on some vital matter. But I<br />
think that we have to face up to this fact that the Government<br />
of the United Kingdom would not have announced that it was<br />
applying for membership and proceeding to negotiate the terms<br />
unless it felt that the argument for going in was, from its<br />
point of view, tremendously powerful. We want to face up to that,<br />
nustntt just regard this as a sort of debating society<br />
gesture. No country like Great Britain, having, after great<br />
reflection in 1956, decided to stay out of the negotiations for<br />
the Comnon Market, and now in 1961, having decided to go in to<br />
negotiations for the Common Market, makes that tremendous change<br />
in outlook and opinion without the most profound thought, and<br />
without a pretty clear determination I should think, in its<br />
mind, that if it can got any kind of arrangement which seems<br />
reasonable in relation to the Comonwealth in relation to the<br />
Free Trade Association, in relation to British agricultire, then<br />
it will accept membership on those terms.<br />
There'ore we must negotiate closely, valiantly,<br />
intelligently; and we must conduct ourselves in all these<br />
negotiations at the moment, and next year particularly, with a<br />
sense of responsibility and with considerable authority. For<br />
once people have to be reminded, I think, that this job, this<br />
enormous negotiation that will affect the whole course of<br />
Australian overseas trade and affect Australia's internal<br />
economy possibly quite profoundly must be conducted by people<br />
of judgent of experience, and, above all things, of authority<br />
in the greal countries with whom we negotiate. This is no job<br />
for unknown people; this is no job for untried people.<br />
we have, I am happy to say, a pretty good repute in<br />
these countries overseas. ' l not only can talk to a country like<br />
the United States, but the United States encourages us at all<br />
stages to speak up and say exactly what we think, frequently<br />
asking us for our views. Our views nay be right or wrong, but<br />
they are respectable views in those countries. In Great Britain,<br />
as I don't need to tell you, we as a senior Commonwealth member,<br />
and as a country so intimately associated with Great Britain in<br />
every way, have a voice that is listened to. On the Continent<br />
of Europe increasingly, our voice is heard. We will need to<br />
have every bit of prestige that . e have been able to acquire,<br />
every bit of influence that we have been able to exercise, in<br />
these negotiations, because wo have much to lose; but we have a<br />
great deal to gain by putting forward, effectively putting<br />
forard, the position of our industries and their irresistible<br />
claims in a growing country to be growing industries with<br />
growing markets. Now I don't imagine for one nonent that the Common<br />
Market is, in the true sonsc, a political issue in our next<br />
election, It ought not to be, I We ouht to have a complete<br />
community of interest on these matters in Australia. I confess </p>
<p>I was disappointed when, having made a statement on this matter<br />
which was, I thought, completely objective and balanced, putting<br />
the problen and explaining the nature of the Treaty of Rome and<br />
the nature of the arrangement, I was disappointed when the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, instead of saying, as I would have expected,<br />
" We are one people on this matter; this is no Party matter; we<br />
will all stand together to do the best thing that we can for<br />
Australia on this matter", moved a vote of censure on us for<br />
some silly reason, and then proceeded to make a highly comic<br />
speech which those present will remnober, I don't understand<br />
the position of the Opposition but then I never could. And<br />
they can't which is perhaps one of the great sources of their<br />
weakness. Now I want to turn away from those natters and say<br />
something about the internal position; and I do this very<br />
largely by way of reminder, and by way of record.<br />
We have had an experience in the last few months, in<br />
the last year or so, which has given rise to violent opinions,<br />
; o groat fluctuations of fortune on the part of the Governrmnt,<br />
Having encountered a boom in 1960 a boom, the existence of<br />
which is admitted by everybody, except, strangely enough, the<br />
Leader of the Opposition we took steps to deal with it. And<br />
of course whatever steps you take to get rid of a boon cre bound<br />
to be unpopular with a lot of people. They have to be, because<br />
boons are very profitable for a lot of people. They are<br />
unprofitable for the ordinary man and woman who finds the value<br />
of his money running out, who finds that things are becoming<br />
dearjr, while a lot of other people find that their profits are<br />
rising in an astronomical way.<br />
You can't quell a boom by letting industries run along<br />
exactly as they were. lJhat do you take economic steps for?<br />
Take an example: ieJ found that one industry, which was an<br />
outstanding example of tremendous boom conditions and<br />
inflationary pressure, was the motor car industry, with a<br />
delivery of vehicles on to the register of about 1,000 a day an<br />
almost fantastic state of affairs for Australia, Well, wore we<br />
to let it go? I know there are poop, including some so-called<br />
economists, who think that inflation is not a bad ideas " It's<br />
not a bad thing; let it ride; let it go; let the boom go<br />
until it bursts". The fact that for every hundred people<br />
directly affected by neasures against a boom, there will be<br />
thousands and thousands of people ruined by the burst after the<br />
boom, the collapse after the boom, this doesn't trouble some of<br />
these so-called experts very much at all. It troubles us.<br />
It is the first duty of a Government, in the economic<br />
sphere, to look for progress , Jf courseo of all things progress<br />
and development for the nation un a basis of stability which<br />
does justice between man and man in the community. What would<br />
you think of a Government which paid no attention to an<br />
inflationary boom, which did nothing about it? I dare say it<br />
would -et an awful lot of votes in the next six months; but it<br />
would lose an awful lot of reputation six months thereafter,<br />
And the country would lose far more than the Government itself<br />
lost in terms of reputation. There are times, and we know it,<br />
and we have some reason to be proud of it, when you nust, if you<br />
follow the light that you see, take steps which will be<br />
unpopular with some. In the course of nature they are going to<br />
be unpopular with some people who normally vote for us, people<br />
engaged in business activities of one kind or another, We can't<br />
help thato Now if you are , ping to dampen down the boom, if you<br />
are joing to take steps which will prevent the motor car industry, </p>
<p>for example, fron boing. the outstanding example of inflationary<br />
pressure, of course you are joing to reduce the demand for cars.<br />
What is the use of playing with words on these natters? Of<br />
course you are going to r. 2duce the demand for cars. That is the<br />
object of the exorcise. And if you reduce the demand for cars<br />
then you are going to reduce the employment, in a direct sense,<br />
of people who are engaged in producing the cars. There is no use<br />
people getting into a grat flutter over this and saying " Look<br />
at thon, deliberately creating unemployment". You are not<br />
deliberately creating unemployment; you are putting people out,<br />
if you like, of employment in an over-flush industry. But you<br />
are releasing those very people for employment in other<br />
industries. A lot of people were paid off from various<br />
activities. Mr. Bolte down in Victoria for the first time found<br />
he was able to got the men he needed in the railways and in the<br />
tranways, which had been gravely understaffed. There is a<br />
movement of employment. But what I want to say to you is: for<br />
Heaven's sake don't be afraid of these people who put it all on<br />
a purely sentimental basis. If you are going to put down a boom,<br />
then you must be prepared to hit a few heads in the process.<br />
And we have done it. And the boom has gone. I dare say some of<br />
the people mngaoed in speculative activities in land curse the<br />
very sound of our name. I hope they do. And they no doubt<br />
will complain. But speculation in land was becoming a minor<br />
tragedy in Australia. How on earth people simple, ordinary<br />
people could afford to buy a block of land to put a home on<br />
began to elude my imagination.<br />
All these are aspects of a boom and they have all been<br />
dampened down to a point where all talk of the credit squeeze<br />
let me say quite plainly is purely a matter of history. There<br />
is no such thing as a " credit squeeze" today. I know everybody<br />
who can't get the finance that he wants attributes it to the<br />
credit squeeze. Of coursel But if you were to say to him,<br />
" What do you mean by ' the credit squeezeI doubt whether you<br />
would got an answer. The banks are liquid much more liquid<br />
than the conventional minimum of liquidity that they observe<br />
The only restriction on the banks' capacity to advance today is<br />
one that everybody would approve of, and that is that they are<br />
asked not to finance speculative activities, and they are asked<br />
to keep their attention very clearly on export industries and on<br />
home building. Now those are very good Central Bank directives.<br />
That is all that is left of the credit squeeze.<br />
But of course, you know, a lot of people who have boen<br />
over-trading, playing it up when the boom was on, are naturally<br />
going to find that things are not so easy when the boom is<br />
exhausted. In the old days they would have said " Well there<br />
you are, I played it up and the boom burst and I ve ot it in<br />
the neck. What a fool I was". But today it's " the credit<br />
squeeze". It isn't the boom that produced their trouble they<br />
claim; it's the corrective measures of the Government that<br />
produced their trouble, Now you want to keep some of those<br />
things, I believe, very clarly in mind.<br />
' lell in effect, what has happened? The boom has been<br />
brought down, has been quelled, Inflation has, for all<br />
practical purposes, been arrested; not completely yet, but the<br />
Consumer Price Index, as you have all observed, is becoming<br />
comparatively stable,<br />
One of the great problems that we had, the problem of<br />
the running down of our overseas reserves a very serious<br />
problem for a great international trading country like<br />
Australia has been solved. At the beginning of the year, or<br />
at the end of the last calendar year, as we saw it, we had a<br />
great chance, if we did nothing, of seeing our overseas reserves </p>
<p>run down to a -oint of dangero All the advocates of letting a<br />
boon roar along, T think, would hardly have b
they had found at the end of a financial year that our overseas<br />
reserves were not competent t. pay for nore than two or throo<br />
months of normal imports, ost of which are for manufacturing<br />
But we took our steps and in the result our overseas balances at<br />
the end of June were healthy, remarkably healthy, And apart<br />
altogether from a borrowing or drawing made according to our<br />
rights, from the International Monetary Fund, our overseas<br />
reserves were near enough to Å O0m. But if we had done nothing,<br />
if we had not taken these economic measures, then our reserves<br />
overseas would have been, well, with a bit of luck, half that.<br />
The result of this, of course, is tremendously<br />
important, because if our reserves are high and healthy, if our<br />
credit is so good with the International Monetary Fund that we<br />
are able to put in a sort of premium against run-down with them,<br />
then our progress in Australia becomes more and more assured.<br />
Don't forget I know you all know these things, but have them<br />
in mind as you go into an election that this country can't go<br />
on at its ,-ate de. velopment unless it has more and more capital<br />
from outside T'-ni and a half million people can't generate the<br />
capital tha. : ceded to develop a continent the size of the<br />
United States of America. It can't be done. Therefore we are<br />
chronically a capital-hungry country; and a capital-hungry<br />
country depends very fundamentally on its repute and credit<br />
abroad. If my Government, so disastrous a Government as I now<br />
learn, hadn't been able to establish in the sources of investment<br />
overseas, or helped to establish, a reputation for reliability,<br />
a reputation for being credit-worthy, a belief in the minds of<br />
people in the irmense possibilities of expansion in Australia,<br />
then I don't know where we would be. But as it is, as you kno;,<br />
last year in the boom year, we had a very large investment of<br />
capital from overseas in. , ustralia between Å 100m. and Å 200m,<br />
This is tremendously significant. Not public borrowing, but<br />
private investnent, productive investment. This year, in spite<br />
of all the disasters that we are supposed to have brought about<br />
by the credit squeeze, and by our policy, investment from<br />
overseas has reached a record luveL Wle have had much more capital<br />
flowing in in the year of corrective measures than we had in the<br />
year of boom. ,] ow this is a tremendous thing. Don't let us pass it<br />
over lightly. We were complimenting my friend Mr. Bolte just a<br />
little while ago about the result of his election. He wouldn't<br />
have won his election if it hadn't been that in the economic<br />
climate that I believe we have helped powerfully to createo ho<br />
himself has been able to ipursue a driving policy in Victoria<br />
which has developed the State, developed its industries, and givn<br />
people a feeling of high optimism about their own State, This,<br />
I am sure he would a: ree with me, is the dominating factor in<br />
the position that he not, and enabled him to increase his<br />
majority although unemployment was already the theme of the<br />
Opposition. So I remind you that if the object was to arrest<br />
inflation it has been substantially achieved; if the object was<br />
to preserve our balances and strengthen our balances overseas it<br />
has been more than successfully achieved, if the object has been<br />
to reduce the inflationary pressures, and particularly<br />
speculative pressures, then I think everybody would agree th: a<br />
it has been achieved.<br />
The one thing, the one thing that remains which is<br />
unpleasant, is that we have some uner. ploynnt. We don't answer<br />
that by saying " Well . e have always had some', because, of<br />
course, there are people who are normally not likely to be </p>
<p>8.<br />
employed we know that in a large numbor of millions of<br />
people. But forget about that. If we have at any stage oven<br />
50,000 or 60,000 who are willing to work, who are competent to<br />
work, and for whom there is no work, that presents a problem<br />
which, in an economic sense nay be regarded as fairly small, but<br />
in a human sense is serious, in a human sense must engage our<br />
constant attention. As a man said to me recently, and I<br />
thought he put it very well, " You can with great truth from an<br />
economic point of view in Australia say you have 1lo or 2% of<br />
people who are out of work, and that means you have 98 or 98-%<br />
who are in work, which is perhaps a better and more positive way<br />
of putting it. But to the ran who is out, and who oughtn't to<br />
be out, unemployment is 100%".<br />
Now that is, in a human sense, profoundly true. That<br />
is why we have concentrated so much effort, so much attention and<br />
no small amount of money on helping, the re-employment of people<br />
in some of these areas by providing, to a greater extent, the<br />
means of finance in local government, by making greater<br />
provision in relation to housing in arrangement with the States,<br />
by entering into an arrangement with the States that in the<br />
first half of the financial year they would tend to accelerate<br />
their works expenditure in relation to the total. All of these<br />
things have been directed, essentiallyto getting rid of what is,<br />
in mass, a small amount of unenployment; but what is, for the<br />
worthy individual, a very serious human problem.<br />
We are doing that and I am bound to tell you that I am<br />
quite optimistic about it. We observed that in the last month<br />
the figures of those registered for unnmploymont, registered as<br />
unemployed, fell and that the number of vacancies rose. though<br />
there may be a little variation here and there I'm told in the<br />
future. But I myself will be very greatly disappointed if, in<br />
another month or two, we don't find that the figures on the one<br />
side are continuing to fall, and the figures on the other side<br />
are continuing to rise.<br />
I mention that matter to you not because I have he<br />
slightest sympathy with an Opposition which, in order to win an<br />
election, will try to create a panic about employrent. There is<br />
no occasion for panic about empl: yment. Unemployment is, I<br />
repeat, in the economic sense, in the statistical sense, smaller<br />
here than in any other country, any other free country, you might<br />
care to mention. It is, in a sense, nominal. But our great<br />
human responsibilities are to put unemployment out of existence<br />
as quickly as we can for the people who are willing and able to<br />
work in Australia. All round, Sir, I think that one can report that the<br />
policies have worked well. The best proof that most of then have<br />
worked well is that we have been able to abandon most of them<br />
once they achieved their results. For 1962, as I have said<br />
repeatedly in other places, I am a complete optimist. I think<br />
that economically in 1962 we may run some risk of some boom<br />
conditions; but no risk of a depression at all. I would like all<br />
of you to say to those people who keep preaching depression that<br />
they are the only people who could produce one. Today a<br />
depression on the old model is just not possible.<br />
Therefore let us go into this battle with some pride in<br />
what we have done. We have been doing it now for 12 years. The<br />
country is in pretty good shape; it attracts increasing<br />
attention all round the world; it is, in a true sense, regarded<br />
more and more as the country of the future. I an veryproud to<br />
have had some connoction with the foundation laying of the last 12<br />
ears and I belivo that this Party is going to have, as it lodks<br />
ack in another 10 years, a . roat pride in showing that it was,<br />
from the beginning, the Party of the future, that it has gone on<br />
being the Party of the futu're and that it has : iven great oncouragemren<br />
to he people of Australia and great growfh to<br />
Austral a itself. D<br />
