TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT, 11 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Well, despite such misgivings, the PM and the Premiers struck a deal<br />
in record time today over lunch and I have now been joined by the<br />
Prime Minister. Paul Keating, welcome.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
PL: Well, it must have been a very convivial lunch, or did you just produce<br />
a bigger bucket of money?<br />
PM: Well, it's taken a couple of years and three meetings. You might recall<br />
the Darwin meeting where we didn't agree and it was a case of then<br />
trying to quantify these benefits and then go back to the drawing board<br />
to see how we might divide potential future revenue streams and<br />
what's happened today is a very historic thing. I mean, it's probably<br />
the most productive Premiers' Conference, Council of Australian<br />
Governments meeting, that I have attended and it is because I think<br />
that competition has worked for Australia. One of the reasons why we<br />
have got low inflation and high productivity is because of the<br />
competition which this Labor Government has introduced to Australia.<br />
Now, on this occasion we had the Premiers, that's Labor and Coalition,<br />
and let me say Premier Wayne Goss and Jeff Kennett, not just Jeff<br />
Kennett or Richard Court as described by your guest, helped in this for<br />
the main reason because it will benefit all consumers.<br />
PL: Yes, but what of David Bund's argument that the Industry<br />
Commission's estimate of the benefits are vastly overblown and you<br />
could live to regret this agreement?<br />
PM: Yes, well it's just conservatism it's just what the Telecom unions had<br />
to say before we set up Optus as a competitor. I mean, Telecom is not </p>
<p>privatised, yet Telecom tariffs have come down enormously, service<br />
has gone up. At this point, Australian Airlines, Qantas, is not<br />
privatised but air fares have fallen by 25 per cent and passenger<br />
movements have increased by 65 per cent. Competition works and<br />
those who bode ill, you know, [ and say] " beware, beware" it's just<br />
naked conservatism and, from the point of view of the unions, selfinterest.<br />
PL: Well, you have offered the States a big bucket of money over the next<br />
ten years what have they got to do to earn it?<br />
PM: Well, they have to meet certain benchmarks. They have got to<br />
introduce competition, they have got to allow the Trade Practices<br />
Commission, which has applied to the Commonwealth's regime all<br />
these years to apply to their own, and they have got to meet certain<br />
benchmarks which includes the reform of electricity, of water, and of<br />
free and fair trade in gas amongst other things.<br />
PL: So how will your average Aussie family tell the difference we'll get a<br />
smaller electricity bill, will we?<br />
PM: Like you get a smaller phone bill. But more than that, because we've<br />
got a coal seam right down the east coast of Australia, it ought to be<br />
one of our great natural advantages. It hasn't been because of these<br />
large monoliths like Pacific Power and the SECV. When we make<br />
them competitive, you will find the cheaper electricity brings the bigger<br />
industries and it becomes a real national advantage for the country.<br />
PL: But is it cheaper for big business, or cheaper for mums and dads?<br />
PM: It's cheaper for everybody. It will be cheaper for consumers generally<br />
and it will be cheaper for business consumers of large licks of<br />
electricity, or large licks of water or gas, and they're the things which<br />
give you an advantage in the world. I mean, all countries have got to<br />
find their comparative advantage. One of ours happens to be energy,<br />
water these sorts of things. Now, it's a big undertaking, but again,<br />
that's why today's reforms are very historic and don't let any special<br />
pleading diminish the strength of them.<br />
PL: It won't mean lots of job losses, it won't mean losers as well as<br />
winners?<br />
PM: Well, in a more competitive economy you end up with more growth and<br />
more employment. In the last year we've had four per cent<br />
employment growth. We've had over just since the last election, we've<br />
had over 560,000 jobs growth. If you take Telecom as an example,<br />
Telecom over time has put people off to make it more efficient, but they<br />
have gone and got jobs elsewhere in the economy. Because an<br />
economy which is growing and which is efficient produces new jobs. </p>
<p>That's the essence of a revitalised economy. See in the National<br />
Accounts that came out last week, Paul, we had five per cent growth,<br />
inflation running at one per cent, four per cent productivity growth and<br />
four per cent employment growth. I mean, I have never seen figures in<br />
the 26 years I have been in public life like that. It's not happening by<br />
accident it is happening by pian.<br />
PL: When are we going to see the benefits of this regime coming through,<br />
and how are we going to know like benchmark it as it happens?<br />
PM: The competition council will basically be required the National<br />
Competition Council, which is to be set up will be required to give the<br />
tick to each State to say whether they pass the threshold points for<br />
electricity, for water, for whatever, ports, wharves, et cetera. And, at<br />
that point, they get the next tranche of the Commonwealth payments.<br />
In other words, it is a performance related set of payments for States<br />
that do want to change things.<br />
PL: There is a big carrot hanging out there in front of the Premiers?<br />
PM: Yes, there is and it is more than the carrot, I think. Well, to some<br />
extent it is a carrot, but perhaps more than that, it is to say that there is<br />
an incentive here, but there is also a clear benefit. Remembering that<br />
some States have done some of these things without any carrot. They<br />
have done them for the same reason that the Commonwealth did it in<br />
telephones, in ports and wharves, in tariffs because, basically, it is<br />
good for Australia, good for the community, good for employment and<br />
good for living standards.<br />
PL: You talked earlier today of a fairer as well as a more efficient<br />
economy. What happens to community service and consumer<br />
interests in this drive for competition?<br />
PM: Well take motor cars, lower tariffs have given Australians cars at about<br />
$ 8,000 $ 10,000 per car cheaper. That is fairer because they get a<br />
better go. That means your living standards are higher because you<br />
can afford vehicles you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. We have<br />
had a 65 per cent increase in air travellers in the last two years. There<br />
is a whole community of people that haven't travelled before, that is<br />
fairer. Why are they travelling Paul? Because it is cheaper. Why is it<br />
cheaper? Because of competition policy in airlines.<br />
PL: On another matter, what is your reaction to the comments by Labor<br />
backbencher Russ Gorman, that when domestic violence is alleged<br />
restraining orders are too easy to get?<br />
PM: Well, I got asked about this today. I mean, what's happened here is<br />
we have had an internecine civil war in the Liberal Party in Western<br />
Australia and the device they have used to gemmy Senator Crichton-</p>
<p>Browne out of the Senate, claims about his private life. The Labor<br />
Party doesn't run those sorts of arguments in its party. We don't run<br />
people's private jives up and down to remove people and what they<br />
are now trying to say is we are all besmirched by this and now we will<br />
besmirch others.<br />
PL: They are implying that Labor MPs have a few dark secrets as well.<br />
PM: Well, no doubt, there is quite a few people who have dark secrets,<br />
including all the way up and down the Press Gallery here and right<br />
through the bureaucracy, out there in the community.<br />
PL: Is there any room in your Caucus for men who bash women?<br />
PM: Well, I don't approve of these things obviously. But again, we are not<br />
about to have a witch hunt which is begun with an internecine war<br />
inside the Liberal Party.<br />
PL: Is the Health Minister's role in the tragic Penny Easton affair a witch<br />
hunt?<br />
PM: I think so. It is the same thing. I mean, the Liberal Party is full of<br />
rancour and this is one of the points I have been making, nobody<br />
should assume that this motley outfit which has never been a national<br />
party, which is just a complexion of states, that John Howard can run it,<br />
there is hatred amongst these people like none of us have ever seen.<br />
PL: But, these allegations about Dr Lawrence are coming from Keith<br />
Wilson, a former Labor State Minister.<br />
PM: Yes, but the claims have been made earlier by the Liberal Party.<br />
PL: Well, he was an Anglican Minister through the years, he is a man of<br />
some reputation. Don't you take them seriously?<br />
PM: She denies those claims and I take her word.<br />
PL: Finally the Japanese Yen, are we seeing some sort of blip here or is<br />
this a watershed with big implications for Australia?<br />
PM: I think this has been on a long time. The Yen has been strengthening<br />
from 150 yen to the dollar to now 80 odd yen to the American dollar.<br />
This is going to produce huge fractures in Japan, it is putting all of<br />
their production off shore.<br />
PL: They buy a lot of raw materials from us, does this affect our..<br />
PM: It will affect us, but by the same token what will also affect us will be<br />
the fact that a lot of their production will be in other places and we will </p>
<p>be still sourcing that. But, this comes from the fact that there has not<br />
been enough domestic spending in Japan savings too high and<br />
domestic spending too low. In the United States its domestic spending<br />
too high, savings too low. And those two things have been driving the<br />
gap between their currencies and no amount of central bank mucking<br />
about, trying to set a rate will fix this other than a change of<br />
fundamental policies in both countries.<br />
PL: But that takes time, of course.<br />
PM: That is going to take time.<br />
PL: Thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
