STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR RWANDA<br />
The humanitarian crisis in Rwanda deepens each day. Australians have<br />
been shocked by the pictures of horror and suffering in the refugee<br />
camps on the Rwandan borders.<br />
The refugees of Rwanda have issued an international distress call, and<br />
Australia must respond.<br />
There are two challenges facing Australia and the rest of the<br />
international community. The first is to deal with the crisis on Rwanda's<br />
borders. The second, equally important, is to create the circumstances<br />
inside Rwanda which will encourage the refugees to return home.<br />
Federal Cabinet has today decided to respond to both these challenges<br />
by boosting Australia's total humanitarian relief to $ 10 million, and by<br />
providing an Australian Medica Support Force of more than 300<br />
personnel to support the United Nations Assistance Mission In Rwanda<br />
( UNAMIR).<br />
The Cabinet decision provides an additional $ 6.5 million aid package,<br />
on top of the $ 3.5 million already committed to humanitarian assistance.<br />
Of the additional spending announced today:<br />
$ 3.25 million will be provided to Australian aid agencies working in the<br />
field. Of this, $ 1.75 million will go to the public appeals conducted by<br />
Australian aid agencies, With the remaining $ 1.5 million going directly to<br />
specific relief programs.<br />
$ 3 million will be provided to the UN consolidated appeal announced<br />
last Friday. This will address immediate humanitarian needs, the<br />
repatriation of refugees, and the long-term rehabilitation of Rwanda. </p>
<p>TEL: 25. JuI. 94 16: 32 No. 006 P. 02/ 02<br />
The Government has also arranged for the immediate despatch by the<br />
first available plane of urgently needed medical supplies, Including oral<br />
rehydration kits, vitamins and anti-malarial drugs. These are valued at a<br />
further $ 250,000.<br />
In addition, the government will deploy as soon as possible two RAAF<br />
C-130 aircraft to Rwanda with water purification and other aid<br />
equipment.<br />
As I said, there is an equally urgent need to make it safe for the<br />
refugees to return to their homes in Rwanda. The deployment of the<br />
Medical Support Force is directed to this end.<br />
The force, based in Kigali Central Hospital, will be deployed for a period<br />
of six months, with an option for a second six-month deployment.<br />
They will be supporting UNAMIR in its mission to contribute to the<br />
security of civilians at risk in Rwanda, and to provide security and<br />
support for the distribution of relief supplies and humanitarian<br />
operations. The Australian Medical Support Force will also be able to<br />
provide assistance to Rwandan civilians at the nearby King Faisal<br />
Hospital. An advance party will leave Australia on 6 August. with the remainder<br />
leaving two weeks later.<br />
In sum, this represents an appropriate response from the Government to<br />
an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. It builds on the very generous $ 7<br />
million already donated directly by the Australian community.<br />
