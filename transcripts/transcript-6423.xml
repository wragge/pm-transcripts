PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA J. 2 July 1984<br />
The Federal Government welcomes the announcement of an<br />
agreement on new industrial relations arrangements in the<br />
building industry as part of which national building<br />
employers indicated their intention to seek leave to<br />
withdraw from deregistration proceedings against the BLF.<br />
The Government strongly believes that the agreement provides<br />
the beat prospects for a real improvement in industrial<br />
relations in the building industry.<br />
It is the clear expectation of the Government that all<br />
Parties to the agreement recognise, fully the responsibilities<br />
which they have now assumed and will abide by the commitments<br />
they have given. The Government will have the industry under<br />
constant review to satisfy itself in this regard.<br />
Adherence to the undertakings will enable a good deal of the<br />
industrial difficulties in the building-industry to be put<br />
behind us. Building workers and employers,-the industry<br />
and the economy stand to benefit from this. </p>
