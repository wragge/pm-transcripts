    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has decided to extend Australia’s air strikes against Daesh into Syria.</p>
<p>This marks the next phase of Australia’s contribution to the international coalition effort to disrupt, degrade and ultimately defeat the Daesh death cult.</p>
<p>The decision to expand air operations into Syria has been given careful consideration.</p>
<p>It follows Iraq’s requests for international assistance to strike Daesh strongholds, and a formal request from the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>The legal basis for these operations is the collective self-defence of Iraq.</p>
<p>The Daesh death cult does not respect borders and threatens the security of Iraq and the international community from its safe havens in Syria.</p>
<p>Daesh controls a large amount of territory in eastern Syria that serves as a source of recruitment and oil revenues, and as a base from which it continues to launch attacks in both Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>From Syria, Daesh has been able to operate training bases, conduct planning and preparation for attacks, and move fighters and materiel into, and out of, Iraq.</p>
<p>The extension of the Australian Defence Force’s operations into Syria will help protect Iraq and its people from Daesh attacks inside Iraq and from across the border in Syria.</p>
<p>The Daesh death cult is reaching out to Australians, as terrorist incidents and disrupted attacks here have demonstrated.</p>
<p>Australia joins a number of other nations – including the United States, Canada, Arab countries and Turkey – which are already contributing to the effort against Daesh in Syria.</p>
<p>Australia’s Air Task Group, deployed to the Middle East region, consists of six F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, a KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport and an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft.</p>
<p>Australia remains committed to the international effort to counter Daesh, which threatens stability in Iraq and the Middle East and the security of Australians at home and in our region.</p>
<p>As the Government has stated before, the size and nature of Australia’s overall commitment to defeat Daesh will remain under regular review.</p>
<p>This is a decision that is firmly in Australia’s national interest.</p>
<p>It reflects the Government’s steadfast commitment to keeping Australians safe from terrorism, preventing the spread of violent extremism to our shores and responding to a deepening humanitarian crisis.</p>
