BACKGROUND BRIEFING GIVEN BY THE<br />
LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY,<br />
SENATOR GORTON, AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA 9TH JANUARY, 1967<br />
SENATOR GORTON: Well, I have no statement to make but perhaps you<br />
have some question.......<br />
Q. Perhaps you can give us the mechanics of the business<br />
tomorrow?<br />
A. I expect to be sworn In as Prime Minister at 2.30 tomorrow<br />
afternoon. I do not propose to make any changes at all in the Ministry<br />
which will carry on in the same way it is carrying on now until after the<br />
Higgins by-election Is concluded.<br />
Q. When will that be?<br />
A. That I can't tell you because I have to speak to Wr Aston,<br />
probably Friday or Monday, or some time like that, and I would like to<br />
speak to the Liberal Party organisation down in Victoria. I would say<br />
perhaps a month, perhaps five weeks, perhaps three weeks. S1. ay<br />
between three and five weeks. After all, It is more likely to be four<br />
weeks than three. We have got to send a letter to the Country Party, we<br />
have to send a letter to the Labor Party, we have got to make sure from<br />
the Speaker that the writs are properly issued, and that kind of thing.<br />
About four or five weeks.<br />
Q. What are the mechanics df your transfer? For instance,<br />
how long can it be between the time you resign from the Senate until<br />
you contest an election? Is there a statutory period?<br />
A. No, but I think if I can rephrase your question: What is<br />
the time during which I can continue as Prime Minister without being<br />
a Member of either House of Parliament. The answer is three months.<br />
Q. Are you sure you will be nominated or selected for the seat?<br />
A. Ch no. I think it likely. t<br />
Q. Does that mean no Parliament until March?<br />
A. I think It might mean that. I would like to meet the House<br />
when It first met.<br />
Q. uni h0What are the reasons that would make you delay the Ministry<br />
A. Well, after all, one can't in this world take things for granted.<br />
I do need to have the Higgins electorate committee endorse me and<br />
select me. I do need to win the seat of Higgins at a general election.<br />
On figures, it looks as if this is likely to happen. Higgins Is a very<br />
good seat indeed. But I think it would look a little odd, I think it would<br />
be a bit peculiar If one has upheavals when there is a possibility, even<br />
a remote possibility of one not being confirmed In the position.<br />
I think It would be much better to wait until after the Higgins by-election. eoo* 9*/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Q. When will you resign from the Senate, Sir?<br />
A. I think I will resign from the Senate on the day before<br />
nominations close for the seat of Higgins.<br />
Q. Who do you have in mind for the Leader of the Government<br />
In the Senate?<br />
A. rwill have to consider that.<br />
Qi When are you going to hold your first Cabiiwt meeting with the<br />
present Ministry?<br />
A. We are going to hold the first Cabinet meeting but not the<br />
first Ministry meeting on the day after tomorrow.<br />
Q. You will be leading the talks with Thomson?<br />
A. I will be sitting in the chair when the talks with Thomson take<br />
place. I don't know that It would be entirely accurate to say that<br />
I will be leading the talks with Thomson because I think the pre sent<br />
Prime Minister has been immersed in the materials on which these<br />
talks will take place, and I would expect a great deal of assistance<br />
from him sitting on mny right hand.<br />
Q. Who will take part -the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee?<br />
A. The whole Cabinet. Not the whole Minktry, the whole Cabinet.<br />
Q. Did you meet the whole Ministry tonight, or are there some<br />
Country Party people who are not here?<br />
A. I recollect they were all here<br />
Q. What was the purpose of this meeting tonight, Sir?<br />
A. Well, this is somewhat of a history-making event in Australia.<br />
There has never before been a Senator who has been sworn In as<br />
Prime Minister. There has never before, as far as we know it<br />
it possible I may be wrong about the very early days of<br />
Federation been an occasion when somebody would be Prime<br />
Minister during a period of time when they were members of<br />
neither Houses of Parliament. This will occur in my case because<br />
I will resign just before the nominations close, and during the<br />
period of the by-election, therefore, will not be a Member of<br />
either House of Parliament. I haven't really checked this out, but<br />
I hope and trust I continue to be paid my salary as Prime Minister.<br />
I won't get any salary as a Member of Parliament. This is<br />
therefore precedent-making and an unusual event, and I think that<br />
the present Prime Minister felt in advising the Governor-General<br />
he would like to have the complete backing of the whole Ministry<br />
that this Is what they wanted to happen, and this iswhat they<br />
wanted to happen.<br />
Q. Will the Government the day after tomorrow announce or<br />
decide on the names of the commissioners for the redistribution? 9 a / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
A. No. The Cabinet the day after tomorrow will be concerned with<br />
the business of the British Minister.<br />
Q. Will It be the Gorton Ministry or the Gorton-McEwen Ministry?<br />
A. I hope and believe that it will be the Gorton-McEwen Ministry<br />
just as It was the Menzies-McEwen Ministry.<br />
Q. What were the voting figures?<br />
A. I haven't a clue, have you? But If you find out let me know. I'll<br />
be interested.<br />
Q. Did all the Ministers pledge to continue in their present portfolios,<br />
or Is there any Indication that any of them might not?<br />
A. I haven't noticed any of them jostling around to resign.<br />
Q. Can we take it that you have not concluded your discussions with<br />
Mr McEwen on the coalition?<br />
A. I think you can take it we have.<br />
Q. Would It be correct to say that the coalition is on the same basis<br />
as with the Holt and Menzies administration?<br />
A. This is right.<br />
Q. Were you surprised at this result today or did you always think you<br />
had It sewn up? You have been regarded as favourite for a long time.<br />
A. Yes, I know. But an awful lot of favourites get beaten In an awful<br />
lot of races. I am not a betting man; that's what punters tell me. I<br />
don't know whether Iym surprised or whether I was astonished. You<br />
remember that story so I won't go Into it. But I was pleased.<br />
Q. When will you move into the Lodge? Have you thought that far<br />
ahead?<br />
A. No.<br />
Q. You have got less distance to travel than most Prime Ministers.<br />
A. I have got to let my house first.<br />
Q. How well do you know the President of the United States?<br />
A. Not very well. I know him only from the meetings we had with him<br />
when he came out here. I would hope to be able and I only hope to be<br />
able to build something of the same kind of relationship with him that the<br />
late Prime Minister built with him. I think it was almost a unique<br />
relationship, just as I think his relationship with the Heads of Asian<br />
countries was, as far as Australia is concerned, something quite new,<br />
the relationship that he built, and something cf enormous significance<br />
to us. And when I can and I don't know when I can because there are<br />
a lot of problems crowding in I would try to see the foundation that<br />
he laid was built upon to be an enduring structure. e e e e / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q. Mr Holt ' s first mission abroad was to Viet Nam. Do you propose<br />
to do the same?<br />
A. I clearly must go to Viet Nam as soon as It Is possible,<br />
Q. That will be your first trip.<br />
A. You always want to get these things down in a sort of black and<br />
white... this Is his first trip... this is his second trip. I clearly must<br />
go to Viet Nam as soon as It Is possible In order to continue the great<br />
work which Holt did In this direction. And to other countries during that<br />
trip. I don't know when that will be. All I can say Is that will be as soon<br />
as the other problems which are crowding In would permit me to do it.<br />
Q. It looks as though you will be pretty tightly leg-roped here until<br />
Easter<br />
A. Well, I have got an election to fight!<br />
Q. Mr Bruce did lose one, didn't he<br />
( Interjection) That was In Flinders.<br />
A. Flinders is miles away, way down the peninsula. What's more It<br />
was on the question of whether there should be an Arbitration Court or not.<br />
Are you trying to scare me or something.<br />
Q. Will you continue with your present portfolio?<br />
A. For a while, yes, but I would hope to have somebody called In to<br />
take over the duties of It, just as Menzies originally called me in to take<br />
over the duties of It.<br />
Q. Could we take it that since you are not making any Cabinet changes<br />
you won't fill the vacn.<br />
A. Until after the Higgins by-election.<br />
Q. The vacancy will remain until after then?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
Q. You talked about upheavals, Sir. Can we take it you are thinking<br />
about extensive changes....<br />
A. Who talked about upheavals?<br />
Q. You mentioned upheavals a minute ago....<br />
A. Oh, well, I j ust meant. let's amend that and s ay " changes"<br />
Aifter all, all changes are upheavals in politics.<br />
Thank you. </p>
