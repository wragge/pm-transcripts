    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, the Rudd Government announced a further $2.5 million to deliver a state-of-the-art stadium for Mackay.</p>
<p>Work on the stadium is now underway, and the new investment will ensure NRL-standard stadium lighting, seating on three sides of the stadium, a sealed car park, upgraded hospitality facilities, and a community room.</p>
<p>The community and council have been tireless in their efforts to get Mackay a first-class stadium and the Rudd Government is pleased to provide additional funds to ensure the stadium will be a source of pride to the people of Mackay.</p>
<p>The $2.5 million is in addition to $8.8 million committed by the Rudd Government during the 2007 election.</p>
<p>The investment stands in stark contrast to the Liberal-National Party's decade of silence on the stadium, and eventual $6.5 million promise during the last election.</p>
<p>When complete, the Mackay community will enjoy a 12,000-seat capacity stadium, improved parking and drop-off facilities including for disability access, and better security and walkway lighting.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government welcomes Stadium Mackay's intention to work with local skills and training organisations to provide extra opportunities for the youth employment in the Mackay region in the construction of these upgrades.</p>
<p>This package of works will be ready to commence in coming weeks, subject to a formal risk assessment of the proposal by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, and Local Government.</p>
<p>This project is a wonderful example of the Rudd Government partnering with local communities, to create jobs and build community infrastructure for the future.</p>
