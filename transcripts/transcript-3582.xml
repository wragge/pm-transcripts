PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 429<br />
7 January, 1975<br />
OFFER OF INDONESIAN ASSISTANCE TO DARWIN<br />
The Prime Minister's office today released the<br />
text of the Prime Minister's response to President Soeharto' s<br />
offer of Indonesian assistance t-o Darwin.<br />
" Thank you very much indeed for your kind message of<br />
sympathy about the Darwin disaster. It was the worst natural<br />
disaster we have suffered in our history. The prompt expression<br />
of the sympathy of the people and government of Indonesia will<br />
be long remembered by those in Australia most affected by the<br />
disaster. I have been informed by our Charge d'Affaires in<br />
Jakarta * of Indonesia's generous offer of two C-130 aircraft to<br />
assist with the emergency operation. I personally very much<br />
appreciate this gesture coming from our closest and largest<br />
neighbour. As I understand has been explained to your<br />
foreign ministry the immediate evacuation crisis in Darwin is<br />
now over, and with it, the immediate need for additional<br />
airlift capacity. It is possible that the demand for aircraft could<br />
0 increase again as the reconstruction phase gets underway, and,<br />
if so, I hope that we will be able to avail ourselves of your<br />
most helpful offer which I deeply appreciate. E. G. Whitlam."<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
