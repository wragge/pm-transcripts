l AUSTRALIA<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 12 NOVEMBER, 1981<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER<br />
CAIRINS SECTION OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK<br />
The Great Barrier Reef is one of the wonders of the world.<br />
It is a focus of national pride, and all Australians treasure<br />
it. There is deep concern in the community for the welfare<br />
of the reef, and a universal conviction that proper care of<br />
the reef is a priority responsibility of governments.<br />
Since 1975, the whole of the reef has been protected by the<br />
Commonw.-ealth Government under the Great Barrier Reef Marine<br />
Park Act. Australia is indeed a world leader in conservation<br />
management of the marine environmen. The policy of the<br />
Commonwealth Government is to proclaim the various sections of<br />
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park progressively. The<br />
Capricornia section was proclaimed in 1979.<br />
The Cairns section has been the subject of negotiation for<br />
more than 12 ronths, the one outstanding issue being whether<br />
the western boundary should be the low water mark on the<br />
mainland or a line some distance off the coast.<br />
The view of the Commonwealth Government is that the low water<br />
mark on the Queensland coast must form the boundary where<br />
features of ecological significance are involved.<br />
The Co. mmonwealth Parliament has full jurisdiction and<br />
responsibility right up to the low water mark. The Commonwealth<br />
Government was willing to allow discussions with the Queensland<br />
Government to be extended to a very considerable length in the<br />
interesLs of achieving co-operation and agreement. But despite<br />
the length of the discussions, agreement has not been reached.<br />
Accordingly, the Commonwealth Government has decided to move atonce<br />
towards proclamation, and the enabling action leading to<br />
the proclamation of the Cairns section will be started<br />
immediately. / 2 </p>
<p>The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment will immediate]. y<br />
request the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority o identify<br />
precisely the boundaries involved and report to him on its<br />
recommendations to allow him to recommend-to the Governor-General tha<br />
the area be proclaimed.<br />
The total length of the Western Boundary will be some 550<br />
kilometres, and for about 30% of this distance the boundary<br />
will be the low water mark on the coastline.<br />
Among the ecofogical features included,-will be the sea grass<br />
beds north of Cape Flattery, which are an important habitat<br />
for dugong an internationally recognised endangered species;<br />
high quality reefs fringing the mainland and islands; and<br />
marine areas adjacent to Queens). and-proclaimed natior~ al parks<br />
which extend down to the shoreline.<br />
The Cairns section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will<br />
be some 36,000 square kilometres. When this is added to the<br />
12., 000 square kilometres in the Capricornia section, the park<br />
will then be many times larger than any existing or proposed<br />
marine Park anywhere in the world.<br />
The Marine Park concept and the way it is being implemented<br />
will ensure the conservation of the Reef ecosystem. It is<br />
the Government's. policy that regulation should be the minimum<br />
necessary to conserve the Reef. As with the Capricornia<br />
section, there will be perfectly satisfactory provision<br />
for recreation, shipping, tourism,., commercial and amateur<br />
fish'ing and other activities. The Park boundaries will<br />
exclude port and other marine areas adjacent to intensiveindustrial<br />
or agricultural developments on land, unless<br />
conservational reasons dictate otherwise.<br />
The selection of the boundaries of the Cairns Section of the<br />
Marine Park has'been made only after the most careful<br />
consideration of alternatives by the Government and by the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.<br />
The'eastern boundary of the new Cairns section will follow<br />
the eastern boundary of the Great Barrier Reef Region itself.<br />
In the south, the boundary will be a line commencing at low<br />
water mark and coincident for most of its length with the li. ne<br />
adopted for State purposes between the Cardwell and Johnstone<br />
Shires and thence passing immediately, south of Taylor Reef to<br />
the eastern boundary of the Regions. In the north, the boundary<br />
will be a straight line commencing at low'water mark ol the<br />
mainland at 14 degrees 40 minutes south and passing through..,<br />
Two Mile Opening to the eastern boundary of the Region.<br />
Lizard Island is within the new Section of the Marine Plark.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>Once the Cairns Section is formally proclaimed, the Great<br />
Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is ' required under the<br />
Act to develop a zoni-ng plan for the Section and, in this<br />
context, will be seeking public submissions. All submissions<br />
which the Authority receives will be examined carefully<br />
and will be taken into account in preparing a draft Zoning Plan..<br />
The draft plan will then be published so that members of<br />
the public are aware of the detailed nature of the Authority's<br />
proposals and are able to comment on them. The draft Zoning<br />
Plan will be 6pen for comment for at least one month.<br />
I regret that the Queensland Government has not come in with<br />
us on the vestern boundary of the Cairns Section. ' But I<br />
believe there is support throughout-the whole of Australia_<br />
for the course of action being followed. I hope that now a<br />
decision has been made, co-operation between the two Governments<br />
in Park matters will proceed. oooQOOooo----</p>
