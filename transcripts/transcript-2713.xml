PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PY1. N; o. 99/ 1972<br />
LOAN TO FIJI<br />
Statement by the Prime " inister, the Rt. } Ion. William<br />
Mc ! ahon,<br />
The Prime inister, Nr cahon, announced today, that<br />
in response to a request of the Fiji Government, the Australian<br />
Government had decided to join with the International Bank for<br />
Reconstruction and Development and New 7ealanI in helping to<br />
finance a road project in Fiji.<br />
The project, which entails extensive reconstruction<br />
work on the road between Nadi and Suva, will be the largest, most<br />
expensive, single project in Fiji's history. It has been<br />
thoroughly examined by the World Bank, and has been cleared<br />
through that Bank's procedure-for selecting economically viable<br />
projects. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development<br />
and New Zealand have agreed to co-operate in financing most of<br />
the foreign exchange cost of the project. Australia has agreed<br />
to lend $ US2.7 7. on terms similar to those offered by the other<br />
two lenders. Australia's loan will be outside, and additional to, the<br />
aid programme recently approved for bilateral aid to<br />
developing countries in the South-West Pacific, including Fiji<br />
over the next few years.<br />
Mr 1c? 1ahon added that he was particularly pleased that<br />
Australia was able to assist in financing this project in Fiji,<br />
which will make a significant contribution to the economic<br />
development of one of our closest neighbours in the Pacific.<br />
