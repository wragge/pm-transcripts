STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
SIR SIDNEY NOLAN MEMORIAL<br />
( PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY)<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
my last conversation with Sir Sidney was midway through last<br />
year. We talked a lot about architecture, a subject on which<br />
I can generally hold my own. But this is not to threaten<br />
you with a discourse on art today.<br />
I will leave the expert judgments to Elwyn Lynn and others.<br />
This gallery like a couple of others around the country<br />
is one of my favourite haunts.<br />
But just as you can enter a temple without knowing the<br />
rites, I know I can come here and pay tribute to Sidney<br />
Nolan without pretending to be expert on his life and work.<br />
And that is really the point: the power of his work was such<br />
that it has influenced even the inexpert among us.<br />
All of us have had our image of Australia in some way shaped<br />
by Sidney Nolan. All of us, I suspect have had our selfimage<br />
shaped by him.<br />
He was one of the great interpreters of our national life.<br />
He painted the physical landscape and altered our mental<br />
landscape. Radical? different as his painting was, when we<br />
looked at it-we recognised ourselIves.<br />
This will prompt some journalists to say -Keating admits<br />
resemblance to Ned Kelly but I em willing to wear that. </p>

Go and look at the Kelly Paintings here or at Lanyon any~ day<br />
and there will always be someone gazing at them and the<br />
paintings, like a mirror, will be gazing back.<br />
I've always thought it said something remarkable about<br />
Australians that in the 1950s they so quickly moved aside<br />
their Heysen gum trees for Nolans, Boyds and Drysdales.<br />
As I have often said in other contexts, Australians have a<br />
remarkable capacity for change. And I reckon it is because<br />
they recognise the truth when they see it.<br />
You'll forgive me for expressing the passing thought if<br />
only they had moved aside Bob Menzies when they moved aside<br />
Hans Heysen.<br />
What Sidney Nolan and his colleagues did was just about as<br />
subversive I suppose: they took our landscape and our<br />
legends and somehow made them both more radical and even<br />
more our own.<br />
Just when a generation of Australians had grown used to the<br />
Heidelberg school and its successors, and complacent in the<br />
thought that that was who were, along came Nolan and said<br />
actually, we're more like this.<br />
As an Australian who has been concerned with change, I have<br />
to say that the paintings of Sidney Nolan and the success<br />
of Sidney Nolan has always given me heart.<br />
His paintings expressed our essential difference to me<br />
they say something about our potential.<br />
It is true of course that Sidney Nolan became Australia's<br />
most internationally celebrated painter. He did us 8<br />
service in that.<br />
Yet his greatest service, I think, was to place before us in<br />
a period of pretty dull conformity some might even say<br />
regression images of this country which reminded us that<br />
our experience was at once unique and universal.<br />
He startled us: in much the same way earlier generations had<br />
been startled by the landscape, or by Ned Kelly, or as a<br />
bushman might be on seeing his reflection in a Wimmere<br />
waterhole for the first time.<br />
I think Nolan was among the poets of Australia.<br />
le was certainly among that generation who I'm sure will in<br />
time become legendary themselves. </p>

Those Australians who lived through depression and war and<br />
did not lose faith.<br />
Twenty eight years separate Sidney Nolan's birth from the<br />
end of World War II in which, incidentally, his brother<br />
was killed. In least twelve of those years Australia was<br />
either fighting a war or a depression.<br />
Whatever political path they took, or whatever their doubts<br />
about life here, they did not lose their love of this place<br />
and their essential Australianess.<br />
I don't say this out of any form of jingoism. I mean only<br />
that Sidney Nolan was of that generation which kept the<br />
place going and of a genius which revived us, renewed us,<br />
kept alive the spark.<br />
H-e was essential to the continuation of the national story.<br />
The sad thing about today is that that generation is now<br />
passing. Just a week ago I attended the funeral of Paul<br />
Hasluck. This week it was Tom Fitzgerald. It is just<br />
eighteen months since Manning Clark died. A year or so<br />
before that, Patrick White.<br />
The mantle has unmistakably passed to us the lucky post<br />
war generation.<br />
The life and death of Sidney Nolan is a reminder of how<br />
great the responsibility is.<br />
It is also a reminder of how tragic it is when we lose our<br />
young artists: in the past twelve months Brett Whiteley, the<br />
dancer Kelvin Coe, and the conductor Stuart Challender have<br />
all died.<br />
It is a reminder, especially for those who continue to<br />
peddle the idea that the right cultural policy is built<br />
substantially around starvation, that support for art and<br />
artists is an essential investment in the nation's life.<br />
We are currently developing a new cultural policy for<br />
Australia. One of the essential elements will be a strategy<br />
for developing creative habitats for artists.<br />
-Habitats -like the one the Reeds -provided for Sidney Nolan.<br />
That is another essential element in the cultural life of<br />
this country we need more private support for the arts.<br />
More private patronage. More John and Sunday Reeds. </p>

We are trying to find the best way to create that support.<br />
Sidney Nolan certainly understood that, and in his later<br />
life he put a great deal back into Australia.<br />
In honour of his brother, in 1974 he donated his Gallipoli<br />
paintings and drawings to the Australian War Memorial.<br />
In 1982 he donated the Paradise Gardens series to the<br />
Victorian Arts Centre.<br />
And the Kelly paintings have been donated to the ANG.<br />
Today I am delighted to announce perhaps the most generous<br />
gift of all.<br />
It is my pleasure to announce that a great project, dear to<br />
the heart of Sidney Nolan, has reached fruition.<br />
For many years it was the shared vision of Arthur and Yvona,<br />
1Bqx and Sidney and Mar~ y Nolan and their families that the<br />
Dundanon Estate on the b; anks-of the Shoalhaven River near<br />
Now ra be made a gift to the nation.<br />
indeed it was to talk about this, and not architecture, that<br />
Sidney Nolan came to see me last year.<br />
The Government has reached an agreement with Arthur and<br />
Yvonne Boyd under which the beautiful properties of<br />
" Bundanon" and " L~ iversdale", and an extensive art collection<br />
owned by them, are to be given to the Australian people.<br />
A public art gallery and performing arts Centre will be<br />
established, as well as facilities for walking and camping<br />
in the 1200 hectares of superb natural environment the<br />
environment which was the subject and inspiration for a<br />
great many Boyd and Nolan paintings.<br />
I understand that there are some 2000 works of art in the<br />
Boyd collection, including works by John Brack,<br />
Leonard French, Charles Blackman and John Perceval.<br />
Artists, musicians, film makers, performers and craftsmen<br />
and women will in future be able to live and work in<br />
Bundanon, and exhibit or perform the works created there in<br />
-a ew -purpose-des ig ned gallery and performing arts area.<br />
The gift includes the original sandstone residence dating<br />
from 1866 and its antique furniture, paintings and pottery. </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Jan. 93 10: 24 No. 012 P. 05/ 05<br />
In addition there is an important collection of art works,<br />
letters and photographs chronicling four generations of the<br />
Boyd family.<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to provide $ 5.43 million to the<br />
Bundanon Trust.<br />
Contributions will shortly be sought from major education<br />
and government institutions, as well as the public.<br />
This is a gift of profound significance, not to say great<br />
generosity. It will ensure that the contributions Sidney Nolan and<br />
Arthur Boyd have made to our national heritage will live on:<br />
it also means that new generations of Australians will have<br />
their opportunity to contribute.<br />
it means that a superb piece of our natural environment will<br />
be secure from the ravages of developers I know that is<br />
dear to Arthur and Yvonne's hearts.<br />
I take this opportunity today to express our gratitude for<br />
this gift, which has required more than generosity it has<br />
needed vision and patience.<br />
This is a rare gift to the nation.<br />
The announcement today Is a fitting tribute to the late Sir<br />
Sidney Nolan.<br />
it is also, of course Sir Sidney's tribute to Australia.<br />
And Arthur Boyd's tribute, and I can only say to Arthur and<br />
Yvonne, on behalf of everyone here and the Government and<br />
the people of Australia thank you.<br />
