FOR PRESS 15 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
BUDGET DEBATE<br />
Mr. Speaker, the Budget brought down by the Treasurer consolidates<br />
and advances the achievements which the Government has already made<br />
in fighting inflation and restoring a healthy economy.<br />
For the second time, we have a Budget which reduces the deficit<br />
by over half a billion dollars, firmly controls the rate of<br />
increase in Government spending, and creates the conditions for<br />
a further reduction in inflation and further " economic growth. At<br />
the same time it increases assistance to those most in need.<br />
Because the Government held its spending within zero real growth,<br />
Australia could afford a major tax reform, under which every wage<br />
and salary earner's take-home pay will rise from 1st February. As<br />
a result of this tax reform, taxpayers will save $ 406 million this<br />
year. Together with tax indexation, their tax savings* this<br />
year will total $ 1371 million. In 1978-79, taxpayers will save<br />
$ 1390 million from the tax reform. Together with $ 467 million from<br />
!-il3. tax indexation, they will be saving $ 1857 million. Had there<br />
been no tax reform, the benefits to taxpayers would have been<br />
$ 973 million less in 1978-79.<br />
This reform was achieved while at the sane<br />
time maintaining our commitment to protect pensions against<br />
inflation. In their desperation, Labor tried to conceal the<br />
benefits of this Budget from the Australian people. They pretended<br />
there were no tax cuts at all. I have a simple offer to make to<br />
those members opposite, who claim to disbelieve the reality of the<br />
tax cuts. Let them volunteer to refund their supposedly nonexistent<br />
tax cuts to consolidated revenue. By doing so, they<br />
will at last make a contribution to lowering the size of the deficit.<br />
Mr. Speaker, had this Budget's tax reforms not been so fundamental,<br />
one might have sympathised a little with the Opposition's unwillingness<br />
to admit that major tax reforms could be made. After all,<br />
their experience with tax reforms when they were the Government<br />
was with -the so-called Hayden tax reforms. So-called tax reforms<br />
that ripped $ 1,000 million of f taxpayers by not indexing the tax<br />
rates to take account of inflation. So-called tax reforms that<br />
imposed higher tax rates on many taxpayers including many low<br />
income earners.<br />
Let us see how these so-called reforms, made by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition's favourite Treasurer, worked. Let us-see how these<br />
so-called reforms affected some of the ordinary working men and women<br />
of Australia. / Under<br />
F77/ 202 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Under the Hayden " reforms" a taxpayer without dependents, whose<br />
concessional allowances had been equal to 10% of his nett income,<br />
paid $ 60, or 17.6% more tax in 1975/ 76 if his income was $ 4,000.<br />
If his income was $ 5,000, he paid $ 120 or 21.8% more tax. If his<br />
income was $ 6,000, he paid $ 212, or 26.2%.<br />
Some reform some Treasurer.<br />
The Hayden scheme hit the farmer particularly hard. In fact, many<br />
farmers with fluctuating incomes paid more tax under the Hayden<br />
system with its inisnan-ed general concessional rebate than wage<br />
earners with the same average income.<br />
Let me give an example. Under the pre-Budget scale, the indexed<br />
Hayden scale, a wage earner on an income of $ 10,000 would pay $ 2147<br />
a year tax. A farmer who had been on that income for some years who<br />
then had income of nil, $ 20,000 and $ 10,000, maintaining an average<br />
$ 10,000 income, would pay tax of nil, $ 5761 and $ 2147 in those three<br />
years a total of $ 1467 more tax than the wage earner.<br />
It should be conceded that under the so-called Hayden tax reforms,<br />
all taxpayers did have something to look forward to taxes which<br />
continually increased, because the Whitlam Government would not even<br />
commit themselves to indexing their new tax rates.<br />
Over the past few months,-the perpetrators of that tax hoax have<br />
enlightened us with further examples of their fine grasp of basic<br />
economic principles. At the Perth ALP Conference, the Leader of the<br />
opposition in a blinding flash of insight uncovered a novel<br />
intellectual concept " economic responsibility". This had<br />
unfortunately evaded him for the three years he was Prime Minister.<br />
The strain of grasping this new idea was so great that once he had<br />
given his speech and the ALP began its economic debate, the Leader<br />
of the Opposition proceeded to read the newspapers. Having thus<br />
rested, he returned to the fray a few weeks later, on July 20, at<br />
the National Press Club. He put forward the ALP's new economic<br />
plan more Government spending and a larger deficit. What a<br />
revolutionary break with Labor tradition that was. Unfortunately,<br />
he spoiled it all by concluding that " Labor offers Australia a long<br />
haul back to prosperity". The Australian people know perfectly well<br />
how long that haul would be.<br />
Then on August 11, just three weeks later, Labor unveiled with great<br />
fanfare their so-called " Proposal to get Australia working again".<br />
Its authors were the Leader of the Opposition and the Member for<br />
Oxley somehow the Shadow Treasurer was lost in the shuffle. This<br />
document declared tht " it should not be represented as an alternative<br />
Budget, but rather as a set of measures to be included in the Budget."<br />
This modesty was becoming but then no party has more to be modest<br />
about. It certainly was not an alternative Budget. What it sought<br />
was an increased expenditure of $ 800 million. Taken together with<br />
Labor's opposition to our policies to restrain Government spending,<br />
it is clear that they were contemplating a deficit of $ 3.5 billion<br />
or more at the least a 50% increase over the $ 2.2 billion we have<br />
budgeted for this year, a deficit which would bring higher interest<br />
rates and higher inflation. / The Opposition </p>
<p>-3<br />
The Opposition now says such huge expenditure on Government<br />
programmes is the only way they know of reducing unemployment.<br />
But in 1975 the Member for Oxley had to terminate a scheme strikingly<br />
similar to this so-called new proposal the notorious RED scheme.<br />
Labor terminated the RED scheme because it was inefficient and<br />
ineffective a scheme which cost $ 180 million but employed an<br />
average of only 13,000 people. The ALP's proposal is in the finest<br />
tradition of Labor economics it holds out the prospect of gravely<br />
damaging Australia.<br />
The next step in the Opposition's carefully thought out economic<br />
offensive took place a week later, after the Budget. On August 18,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, and Labor's joint-divided Shadow<br />
Treasurers, the Members for Adelaide and Oxley, held a very<br />
instructive press conference. It showed the ALP's superb approach<br />
to economic policy making, the machine-like precision with which the<br />
ALP's economic manager and Shadow Treasurer work together. The<br />
Member for Oxley said that the Labor Party had no commitment to<br />
personal tax indexation, but the Member for Adelaide admitted that<br />
personal tax indexation was ALP policy. The Member for Oxley said<br />
that the Labor Party did not commit itself to our tax reforms, but<br />
the Member for Adelaide seemed to rule out the scheme entirely.<br />
The Member for Oxley said that he could make some definite calculations.<br />
The Member for Adelaide said he could not. One commentator<br />
who was present was unkind enough to say that " Messrs. Whitlam,<br />
Hayden and Hurford resembled not so much the three wise monkeys as<br />
Donald Duck's nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louey". Well, after all,<br />
the ALP-has been livi-ng-in-fantasyland for so long that a touch<br />
of unreality was only to be expected.<br />
But the high spot of the ALP's contribution to economic theory and<br />
practice had not yet been reached. The climax was the Leader of<br />
the opposition's reply to the Budget a reply that contained nothing<br />
constructive, nothing of substance. A reply that some people<br />
described as full of tired and empty rhetoric. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition's speech was full of yesterday's delusions yesterday's<br />
words uttered by yesterday's man. But to dismiss the speech as<br />
completely devoid of meaning is to ignore the Leader of the Opposition's<br />
most revealing remark, that Labor's alternative to the Budget was<br />
" implicit" in all that he had been saying; implicit in all his<br />
criticisms of our restraint in spending Australian's tax dollars.<br />
It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition wants a return to the<br />
days when Government spending was unrestrained. He wants a return<br />
to the unrealistic, the destructive policies Labor pursued for three<br />
years, policies which increased Government expenditure by 115%.<br />
Policies which resulted in unemployment being trebled in one year.<br />
Policies which in three years trebled the rate of inflation.<br />
At the National Press Club, the Leader of the Opposition said that<br />
the Labor Government had made mistakes, that the ALP would henceforth<br />
walk the path of economic responsibility what responsibility?<br />
He and the Party he leads are economic incompetents. That is why<br />
the Australian people voted them into opposition. That is why the<br />
Australian people will keep them in opposition. / In this </p>
<p>-4-<br />
In this Budget, we have again re-examined Government programmes to<br />
ensure that funds raised from taxpayers are being used with the<br />
greatest efficiency, to the greatest effect. All Australians have<br />
a big stake in making Government more efficient and less costly<br />
for efficient Government means stronger more highly motivated<br />
Government, and lower taxation for all Australians.<br />
The Budget represents a major step in making Government more<br />
efficient, and achieving the lowest taxation possible consistent<br />
with sound strong Government.<br />
Through our vigorous efforts in reappraising Government programmes,<br />
we have held the real rate of growth in Government spending to zero.<br />
Yet at the same time we have provided large increases in payments to<br />
the states and local government, given high priority to programmes<br />
for relieving unemployment, especially for the young, and increased<br />
social security and welfare spending by 13%. The Budget gives high<br />
priority to providing effective assistance to those most in need.<br />
The automatic adjustment of social security pensions and benefits<br />
will result in increases in November, and again in May 1978, and<br />
repatriation disability pensions and service pensions will rise in<br />
the same way.<br />
We , have achieved all this, and reformed the tax sca les, without<br />
increasing postal charges or the duties on beer, spirits and<br />
cigarettes. This is the second consecutive Budget in which these<br />
charges have not been increased.<br />
Contrast Labor's record. It increased indirect taxes in two out<br />
of its three Budgets. As a result in 1975/ 76, collections of<br />
indirect taxes were $ 2.2 billion about 90% greater than they<br />
had been in 1972/ 73. It was our firmness in restraining Government<br />
expenditure which enabled. the Government to introduce substantial<br />
cuts in personal income tax. Australians want to have greater<br />
freedom to make their own decisions about spending and saving, and<br />
this Government is committed to providing the conditions under which<br />
the best efforts of all will be encouraged not stifled by excessive<br />
taxes. That is why we promised to reform the tax system.<br />
Last year we brought in personal tax indexation and major reforms<br />
for corporate taxpayers. This year we have made the most revolutionary<br />
change yet made to Australia's system of personal income tax. The new<br />
personal taxation measures restore the incentive to work harder and<br />
more productively and earn more. They give people the power to decide<br />
how a greater proportion of their income is spent.<br />
The new tax system accords with the views of most taxation policy<br />
experts. The Labor Government received many reports from committees,<br />
commissions and task forces bearing on taxation policy. Overwhelmingly,<br />
they support the main features of the personal tax system introduced<br />
in this Budget.<br />
The new tax system's first feature is that there are tax cuts for<br />
people at all income levels, and, for the vast majority of full time<br />
workers there is also a reduction in the excessively high marginal<br />
tax rates, that is, a reduction in the extra tax payable on each<br />
extra dollar of income earned. These changes accord with the main<br />
/ f inding </p>
<p>finding of the Asprey Committee the most comprehensive review<br />
of Australia's taxation system for forty years that the Australian<br />
tax system relies too heavily on personal income tax. The changes<br />
accord with the Mathews Committee's conclusion that rising marginal<br />
tax rates encourage tax avoidance and evasion, and may lead to<br />
substantial economic waste because tax avoidance becomes a basis<br />
of investment and employment decisions.<br />
The House will I hope recall that the ACTU's industrial advocate<br />
was a member of the Mathews Committee.<br />
The new tax system, by fostering skill and encouraging the acceptance<br />
of responsibility, heeds the warning of the Jackson Committee that<br />
a society " neglects at its peril rewards for skill and responsibility"<br />
The Jackson Committee concluded: " We have a general impression that<br />
reward differentials after tax are decreasing, and may no longer be<br />
sufficient to encourage individual effort and enterprise in industry."<br />
The House will recall that the President of the ACTU and of the ALP<br />
was one of the authors of that report.<br />
The new system's second feature is that icL-introduces a tax-free<br />
area at the base of every taxpayer's income of $ 3750, or about<br />
$ 72 per week. This replacement of the so-called " general<br />
concessional rebate" introduced in the Hayden Budget of 1975,<br />
accords with the Asprey Committee's recommendations.<br />
Just a few months before the previous Government introduced the<br />
notoriously misleading " general concessional rebate", the Asprey<br />
Committee had described such rebates as confusing. They reported:<br />
" The amount of tax to be levied on low incomes should not be<br />
obscured by artificialities". Artificialities were what the<br />
opposition's last Budget was all about artificialities that<br />
tried to hide the massive tax increases which the Hayden Budget<br />
inflicted on many taxpayers on low incomes. There are no such<br />
artificialities in this Budget.<br />
The new tax system's third feature is that it establishes one tax<br />
rate 32% as the basic rate of taxation paid by the vast majority<br />
of taxpayers. The Leader of the Opposition's claim that this<br />
abandons progressive taxation is completely untrue. Under the<br />
new tax system the higher a person's income, the higher the proportion<br />
he will pay in tax. Because the first $ 3750 of everyone's<br />
income is tax free, a taxpayer on any given level of income will<br />
pay a higher proportion of his total income in tax than a taxpayer<br />
who has a lower income, but whose circumstances are similar in<br />
other respects.<br />
A taxpayer with no dependants and no other deductions or rebates,<br />
at an income of $ 5,000 will pay 8% of his income; at $ 10,000 he<br />
will pay 20%; at $ 15,000, at $ 20,000, 29%; and at $ 50,000, 44%.<br />
At the same time, under this system, 90% of taxpayers pay the same<br />
amount of extra tax on each extra dollar of income.<br />
This principle was supported by Professor Henderson's Commission<br />
of Inquiry into Poverty, by the priorities review staff report on<br />
social welfare policy. / Moreove r </p>
<p>-6<br />
Moreover, the Asprey Committee took the view that " Over the<br />
middle band of income and wealth, the band in which the great<br />
majority of them spend their lives, most Australians will accept<br />
as fair and convenient an approximately proportional taxation<br />
system."<br />
Fourthly, the new system imposes tax surcharges on taxpayers<br />
with the highest incomes, but reduces the rate on the highest<br />
incomes from its present 65% to 60%. This also accords with the<br />
recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, and<br />
was in fact the maximum marginal rate Professor Henderson<br />
suggested.<br />
The Asprey Committee went even further, and suggested that an<br />
appropriate long term target would be reducing the highest<br />
marginal tax scales to<br />
Mr. Speaker, the new tax arrangements are in line with professional<br />
opinion on the best tax system for Australia. Those who clamoured<br />
for reductions in marginal tax rates before the Budget, but who now<br />
complain because taxpayers on high incomes get the largest reductions,<br />
are refusing to face an inescapable fact the fact that<br />
reductions in rates of taxation for those with low taxable income,<br />
automatically reduce the taxes paid by those with higher incomes.<br />
Those who believe that tax reductions on high incomes should have<br />
been less, should tell us at what income levels they believe<br />
marginal rates should have been higher.<br />
It may be helpful if I mention that the cost to revenue of a<br />
reduction of one percentage point is over $ 300 million in respect<br />
of the standard rate of tax of 32%, less than $ 30 million in<br />
respect of the 46% rate, and about $ 11 million in respect of<br />
the 60% marginal tax rate. Had the Government rejected the<br />
recommendations of expert inquiries, and left the maximum<br />
marginal tax rate at 65%, at best, the amount saved would only<br />
have enabled us to reduce further the standard 32% rate of<br />
taxation by one-fifth of a percentage point, from 32% to 31.8%.<br />
The Opposition's wilful misrepresentation of the tax reforrms,<br />
iLts attempts to set Australians against Australians by talking<br />
about a " class Budget", will not alter the fact that all people<br />
will benefit, and proportionately, people on the lowest incomes<br />
will benefit most of all.<br />
Taxpayers with a dependent spouse earning $ 7,000 a year will<br />
save 33% in tax. Those earning $ 8,000 a year will save<br />
On $ 18,000 a year, they will save 20% in tax. Taxpayers whose<br />
incomes fluctuate will be more fairly treated, and primary producers<br />
will have tChe added benefit of the new tax averaging<br />
arrangements announced recently by the Treasurer. Primary<br />
producers with fluctuating incomes, who were disadvantaged<br />
under the Hayden tax system, will no longer pay more tax than<br />
other taxpayers with the same average income. / As the </p>
<p>-7<br />
As the Asprey Committee pointed out, the averaging system has<br />
operated harshly on farmers with falling incomes. The Government's<br />
new tax averaging system will especially assist these farmers. For<br />
example, a farmer with taxable income of $ 4,000 but with an average<br />
income of $ 10,000 would have paid $ 453 tax under the pre-Budget scale.<br />
Under the simplified scale and the new averaging system, his annual<br />
tax will be $ 80 the same as a wage earner with an income of $ 4,000.<br />
A farmer with a taxable income of $ 8,000 but with an average income<br />
of $ 10,000 would have paid % 1583 in tax. Under the new arrangements,<br />
his annual tax liability will be $ 1360, the same as a wage earner<br />
with an income of $ 8,000. This is a reduction of $ 223 in tax.<br />
These savings are significant. They will remove the harshness<br />
identified by the Asprey Committee which farmers with falling incomes<br />
have experienced. At the same time, these measures will have<br />
negligible cost in 1977-78, arid will therefore not affect the<br />
Budget's economic strategy.<br />
The new tax system is simpler and fairer than any system of personal<br />
tax Australia has had before. The Opposition's campaign to confuse<br />
taxpayers will fail. Taxpayers will of course learn about the new<br />
tax system in the most direct way.<br />
On 1 July 1976 and 1 July 1977, all wage and salary earners became<br />
very aware about tax indexation when there were reductions in the<br />
tax deducted from their pay. On February 1 1978, there will be<br />
another reduction in tax reductions from pay packets. On July 1<br />
1978, there will be yet another reduction in the tax deducted from<br />
pay packets, and every wage and salary earner will benefit.<br />
Let me emphasise again the simple truth of the historic tax reforms<br />
this Budget has introduced. No individual taxpayer will lose.<br />
Every individual taxpayer will gain. All taxpayers are protected<br />
against inflation.<br />
The Budget brought down by the Treasurer is a Budget in which<br />
efficiency and sensitivity in Government administration are at a<br />
premium.<br />
With one decisive stroke, the Budget reforms and simplifies the<br />
personal tax system in such a way as to benefit everyone, to reward<br />
initiative and enterprise for everyone, to encourage harder work and<br />
higher productivity by everyone. It further reinforces the constant<br />
pressure against inflation which the Government has exerted ever since<br />
coming to office. It provides a stimulus to the economy through a<br />
large increase in the disposable incomes of all taxpayers, particularly<br />
after 1 February when PAYE deductions will be reduced. It protects<br />
the disadvantaged by increasing pensions and benefits to keep pace<br />
with inflation. The lower deficit sets the scene for lower inflation<br />
and lower interest rates.<br />
Mr. Speaker, this Budget represents a further stage in the economic<br />
policies we have employed throughout 1976 and 1977. These policies<br />
will continue to establish the sound foundation for sustainable<br />
economic growth and prosperity. </p>
