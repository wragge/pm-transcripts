PRESS CCNFERENCE OF THE PRESIDENT<br />
AND PRIME MINISTER HOWARD OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Parliament Mouse<br />
Canberra, Australia<br />
12: 45 P. M. ( L) PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: Mr. President, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of my government how<br />
much I have appreciated the opportunity of talking to President<br />
Clinton so soon after his reelection. I would like to repeat<br />
publicly the congratulations I extended to the President<br />
privately ont his reelection.<br />
This is a marvelous opportunity for both of us to<br />
reaffirm the importance of our longstanding, deep and rich<br />
association. It's an association that goes beyond the more<br />
formal elements of a treaty or an alliance. It's an association<br />
of like-mninded people committed to common values with many shared<br />
historical experiences, many common cultural attitudes, and above<br />
all., a very deep commitment to democratic institutions, values<br />
and freedoms of the individual.<br />
It was also for both of us an opportunity to affirm<br />
the importance the contemporary relevance of our partnership<br />
in the context of our common involvement in the Asia Pacific<br />
region, where I have said on a number of occasions that we share<br />
a common future and a common destiny. The President and I had<br />
the opportunity in our discussion this morning to canvas many<br />
global issues, but ones of particular relevance to our region,<br />
and we also touched upon a number of trade issues which are of<br />
ongoing importance in the bilateral relationship.<br />
I want to say how pleased I am personally to have<br />
the Opportunity with my wife. Janette, oñ welcoming the President<br />
and Mrs. Clinton to our country. They are very welcome not only<br />
for themselves and the great leadership that they're giving to<br />
their country, but also as the President and the wife of the<br />
President of the United States.<br />
The President of the United states is always welcome<br />
in Australia. And I will take the opportunity over the next<br />
couple of days in an informal manner to continue the discussion<br />
that both us have had this morning.<br />
But to you, Mr. President, again, publicly, my very<br />
warm welcome. You are here as a very welcome guest and with the<br />
goodwill of all of the Australian people.<br />
TME PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Prime minister.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have wanted to come to<br />
Australia for a very long time. I am glad that I have finally<br />
come. I wish I could have come earlier, and I've had so much fun<br />
in the last day, I'm amazed that only three American Presidents<br />
have come here. I think it ought to be a habit because of the<br />
unique partnership that the United States and Australia have<br />
enjoyed throughout the 20th century and indeed going back long<br />
before that. The Prime Minister and I had our first personal<br />
meeting today. It was a very good one. We talked about a lot of<br />
the things that we share in common as nations, We talked about </p>
<p>Fax From 28/ 11/ 96 82<br />
our common agenda to expand global trade through the World Trade<br />
Organization and APtC where we'll both be goinq in a couple of<br />
days. we talked about the work we have dons to halt the spread<br />
of weapons of mass destruction.<br />
And again, I want to thank in this press conference,<br />
Mr. Prime minister, on behalf of all the American people,<br />
Australia for the leadership that Australia exhibited in securing<br />
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and for your support in<br />
helping us all defreeze the North Korean nuclear program.<br />
we also share a commitment to advance democratic<br />
values, we have worked on it side by side throughout the wars of<br />
the 20th century, throughout the Cold War and now in this new<br />
era. We've joined together in supporting human rights In Burma,<br />
promoting the rule of law in Cambodia, helping to keep the peace<br />
in troubled corners of the world.<br />
We are working hard to build on the partnership<br />
between the United States and Australia. We talked about our<br />
security cooperation. We're moving forward on the Sydney<br />
statement of July which bolsteredi our security ties. I made a<br />
little bit of a joke about the U. S. Marines who will soon take<br />
part in joint training exercises in North Australia. They are,<br />
seriously, a powerful symbol and a concrete manifestation of our<br />
pledge to protect stability in the Pacific. But they're also. I<br />
think, apprehensive about seeing what that vast and not very<br />
populated area holds for them. There's a lot of talk about it,<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, already in the Defense Department, and we're<br />
certainly glad that there was no extra spaceship up there the<br />
other day. ( Laughter.) And let me say in the Prime minister's defense, when<br />
we started out yesterday morning, we thought that it might land<br />
in the United states. So no one quite knew where it was going to<br />
come down, but we're glad it wound up in the ocean,<br />
Let me also say that on a very serious note for the<br />
future, I was deeply Impressed by the comments that the Prime<br />
Minister had about the upcoming APEC leaders meeting in Subic say<br />
in the Philippines. We know we have to keep this group working<br />
together to push the barriers that still restrain global trade<br />
and to look especially for opportunities that will enable our<br />
people to get better jobs, to lead better lives, and in so doing,<br />
to advance the cause of the other APEC nations as well. So I am<br />
looking forward to the Philippines.<br />
Australia really started the APEC organization.<br />
' Then I convened the world leaders of the APEC nations5 in Seattle<br />
in 1993 and we've been building on it ever since. it Is very,<br />
very important, now that we have a goal of free trade in the area<br />
by 2020, now that we have a blueprint for achieving it, it is<br />
important that we actually take some concrete steps toward<br />
implementation of our goal, from tariff cuts to other<br />
deregulation measures. And I will be working hard for that.<br />
Let me say that the area that I would like to see<br />
the most progress in is in information technology, Currently,<br />
trade in that area is valued at a trillion dollars. It's<br />
projected to grow over 250 percent in the next 10 years. And we<br />
need to do more to open up those markets in a way that enables<br />
more people in the world to do what I saw last night when Hillary<br />
and I case in from the airport and all the people were waving to<br />
us. It seemed to me about one in every third person who was<br />
waving to us also had a cellular telephone in his or her ear,<br />
talking to someone back home and telling them about it. As I<br />
said to the Prime minister, half the people in the world are<br />
still two days walk from a telephone. And we have a lot of work<br />
to do if we're going to bring the world together to minimize<br />
misunderstanding, to minimize disruption and to maximize human<br />
opportunity. MORS 20/ 11/ 96 17: 02 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>28/ 11/ 96 17: 82 Pg: 3<br />

Let me lastly say another word about the special<br />
relationship between the United States and Australia. we're<br />
proud to be Australia's largest foreign investor, its second<br />
largest trading partner. Trade between our nations was about œ 16<br />
billion last year. We're also proud to have stood side by side<br />
with Australia in the conflicts and the struggles for peace and<br />
freedom and Prosperity in this last century. And I believe that<br />
this remarkable and wonderfully unique relationship between our<br />
two countries is on even more solid ground as we look to the 21st<br />
century. And I thank the Prime Minister for the reception he has<br />
given me today. Thank you, sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: Thank you.<br />
Q Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, you<br />
mentioned that you talked about multilateral trade issues. can I<br />
ask did you specifically raise Australia's trade concerns with<br />
the United States? And. Mr. President, Australian farmers are<br />
hoping for some sort of commitments from the U. S. that the SEP<br />
and DEEP programs won't be specifically targeted on Australia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: Could I say that I certainly<br />
did raise with the President the ongoing concern of Australia as<br />
a major exporter of primary produce about the practice of export<br />
support and export subsidies in the area of agriculture. And the<br />
President responded to that and he will do so in his own words.<br />
But I certainly made it very clear that that<br />
remained on of those areas in the bilateral relationship that<br />
needed continuous attention. And it is the tact that the<br />
Australian government believes that the existing arrangements do<br />
work against the interests of major primary producers such as<br />
Australia. I think it is fair to add that the prime source of<br />
the problem is not to be found within the United States, but<br />
rather within the European Union, and that is a view that I have<br />
expressed before and It's not a view or a reflection on the issue<br />
that I have Invented for the purposes of today's discussions.<br />
I've frequently expressed that view and I do see many of the<br />
United states, actions taken in the past as being in the context<br />
of responses to the activities of the European Union.<br />
But our concerns on that were certainly raised, as<br />
they have been in the past and they will be in the future. But I<br />
was quite reassured by the responses that were made by the<br />
President. But he will naturally deal with that in his own<br />
words. THE PRESIDENT: The Prime Minister actually raised<br />
two-trade issues and I'd like to tell you very briefly about both<br />
of them. The first, with regard to the ESP and the DEEP programs<br />
in agriculture, as I'm sure you know, the United States has just<br />
adopted a new five-year farm bill which eliminated specific<br />
program by program or crop by crop support and reduced overall<br />
trade subsidies. We did retain the export enhancement options<br />
because of the problems as the Prime Minister said that we have<br />
with the European Union.<br />
And I committed to the Prime minister end I commit<br />
to you and through you, the people of Australia, that we are<br />
going to do everything we can to make sure that any future use of<br />
these programs is not either directly or indirectly working to<br />
the disadvantage of a country that is innocent of any wrongdoing<br />
in this case, Australia. And I look forward to the day when<br />
we will have a genuinely open market in agriculture, which would<br />
help your agricultural interest and the American agricultural<br />
interest and I believe would work to the benefit of the entire<br />
world. The second thing the Prime minister mentioned was<br />
the leather dispute and let me just reemphasize where that is.<br />
HORIS </p>
<p>tax Fro 20/ 11/ 96 17: 82 Pg: 4<br />

Mr. Fischer and Ambassador Barshefsky have been working hard to<br />
resolve this. I very much want it resolved. We are very close<br />
to a resolution and we're going to do everything we can to<br />
resolve it so that when we leave Manila we'll both have smiles on<br />
our face about that. Besides that, I don't want any more<br />
cartoons like the one I saw in the morning paper where I hooked a<br />
golf ball way left and broken the window of the leather goods<br />
store. You need to build up my confidence far thjs golf game<br />
tomorrow, not tear it down. ( Laughter.) I need all the help I<br />
can get. Q Mr. President, the arrest of the CIA'S former<br />
station chief in Moscow is the second major spy scandal involving<br />
Russia in the last two years. Are you going to take is there<br />
going to be any retaliation for this incident, and do you think<br />
that the CIA needs to tighten its Internal watchdog system?<br />
THE PRESIDENT: Well, Deputy Secretary Talbott has<br />
already met with the Russians about this, number one. Number<br />
two, this is the direct result of the tightening of the system.-<br />
This arrest comes because of the new cooperation that I ordered<br />
between the CIA and the FBI. And I want to compliment Mr. Deutch<br />
and Mr. Fresh for the work that they did and the work their<br />
people did and I think it's a very good thing. And I'm glad that<br />
it happened and I think that it ought to be a signal that we're<br />
going to continue to do this and we will do what we think we have<br />
to do in intelligence, and we don't want any people in our<br />
intelligence agency spying for other countries, and we're going<br />
to take appropriate action when we find it.<br />
Q And in Russia, or are you<br />
THE PRESIDENT: Well, we've already had<br />
conversations with Russia and I think I shouldn't say any more<br />
than that at this time.<br />
Q Mr. President, is your foreign policy in<br />
this region China and trying to, if you want to, ease concerns<br />
that countries such as the U. S. and Australia are trying to<br />
contain China? And what can Australia and the U. S. realistically<br />
do in partnership in the region?<br />
THE PRESIDENT: China first. I think China has to<br />
be a big priority for all of us. if i ask everyone in this room<br />
to go by yourselves and take out a pad and writs the five big<br />
questions down that will determine the shape of the world So<br />
years from now, one of those questions would surely be, how will<br />
the Chinese define their greatness in the 21st century? Will<br />
they define their greatness In terms of the incredible potential<br />
of their people to learn, to produce, to succeed economically and<br />
culturally and politically? or will they define their greatness<br />
in terms of their ability to dominate their neighbors and others<br />
perhaps against their will or to take other actions which could<br />
destabilize the march toward democracy and prosperity of other<br />
people? The united States has no interest in containing<br />
China. That is a negative strategy. what the United States<br />
wants is to sustain an engagement with China, along with our<br />
friends like the Australians, in a way that will increase the<br />
chances that there will be more liberty and more prosperity and<br />
More genuine cooperation in the future. So I intend to spend a<br />
lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of effort on that, but not<br />
with a view of containing the Chinese, but with a view of making<br />
them a genuine partner with ourselves and others as we move<br />
forward. What can we and the Australians do? Number one, we<br />
can continue to push open trading systems that work to the<br />
benefit of all involved. Number two, we can continue to work<br />
together as we did with the comprehensive Nuclear Test San Treaty<br />
to continue to reduce the dangers of serious weapons. And,<br />
MORS </p>
<p>fax I ron MORS 20/ 11/ 96 17: 82 Pg: S<br />
number three. we can lead other freedom-loving nations in<br />
standing up against the new threats of the 21st century<br />
terrorism and the proliferation of other weapons, biological and<br />
chemical weapons. There are a lot of things we can do together<br />
that will make a big difference. But I see this in the context<br />
of building a partnership with China, not isolating it.<br />
Q The crisis in Zaire appears to be easing<br />
significantly. Is it still necessary to dispatch American<br />
troops? THE PRESIDENT: The real answer to that question is<br />
that we have not made a final decision. Tony Lake went to Canada<br />
yesterday to confer with the Prime Minister and others. We are<br />
very pleased, obviously, that so many of the refugees are able to<br />
wove freely back into Rwanda. we are urgently concerned about<br />
the continuing humanitarian problems there and have allocated<br />
about $ 140 million in U. S. AID funds to try to deal with those<br />
problems. And I expect to receive a recommendation shortly. We<br />
are continuing to explore with our allies what sort of mission<br />
needs to go there, what its composition should be, what the<br />
remaining problems should be.<br />
There's no question that the situation looks better<br />
than it did a couple of days ago. It's also no question the that<br />
possibility of serious human loss is still there. so we're<br />
working it hard. We'll try to resolve what we ought to do.<br />
we're working with our allies and I will give you an answer just<br />
as quickly as I can. But we have already allocated a significant<br />
amount of money to try to alleviate the nutritional and other<br />
problems that we know the refugees are going to have.<br />
Q Mr. President, you mentioned the shared<br />
commitment of Australia and the United States to human rights. A<br />
number of members of your party have proposed that you raise in<br />
discussions with President Soeharto the idea of a U. N.-sponsored<br />
act of self-determination or referendum in East Timor. What is<br />
your view of that proposition? And I'd like to ask Mr. Howard<br />
the same question what is your view of a U. N.-sponsored act of<br />
self-determination in East Timor?<br />
THE PRESIDENT: You said people in my party have<br />
said that I should do that? They haven't discussed that with me.<br />
( Laughter.) Let me say, without answering the specific question,<br />
because I haven't made a decision about that, let me say, I have<br />
been concerned about the whole question of East Timor from the<br />
first time I first heard about it. The United States has, while<br />
maintaining basically constructive and friendly relationships<br />
with Indonesia and working with Indonesia on the whole wide array<br />
of shared foreign policy concerns, has consistently done more in<br />
the last three years than we have previously. we changed our<br />
arms export policy to try to not sell those arms which could be<br />
most likely to be used to put down a civilian rebellion or to<br />
oppress people's human rights not in any country, but with our<br />
sales toward Indonesia. We have cosponsored the resolution in<br />
Last Timor In the United N'ations.<br />
And Indonesia is a very large, very great, very<br />
rapidly growing country with a massive amount of diversity<br />
both ethnic diversity and religious diversity. This is one area<br />
where they have not been able to manage it successfully. And we<br />
will continue to try to work to do what we can to resolve this in<br />
a way that is consistent with what I believe are universal values<br />
with regard to human rights and human dignity.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: As far as we are concerned,<br />
that's not an issue that I previously addressed my mind to, so,<br />
like the President, I won't specifically try and respond to it.<br />
But let me say that the East Timor issue is obviously a sep~ sitive<br />
elements of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia and, </p>
<p>taxa an28/ 11/ 96 17: 82 Pg: 6<br />
indeed, the relationship between Indonesia and other countriegs,<br />
You will all be aware of the great importance of the bilateral<br />
relationship between both Australia and Indonesia. There will<br />
always be differences of view about how different issues should<br />
be handled between our two countries. But my government and<br />
governments before mine of both political persuasions have shown<br />
a determination not to allow that issue to contaminate or<br />
undermine the broader relationship.<br />
And the significance of the bilateral relationship<br />
between Australia and Indonesia is only surpassed by our<br />
bilateral relationships with one or two other countries. And<br />
it's, therefore, important in everything that we do to try and<br />
keep a proper balance between our desire to foster that<br />
relationship, but, by the same token, to properly put down<br />
markers of errors and values in errors and attitudes and also, of<br />
course, to fully respect the fact that within a democracy such as<br />
Australia, people will openly and vigorously express their views<br />
on this issues. And it is no part of the role of the Australian<br />
government to prevent or discourage that. That Is a point that I<br />
made in my own personal discussions with President Soeharto when<br />
I saw him in Jakarta a couple of months ago.<br />
Thank you.<br />
2 Thanks very much.<br />
Q xr. President, if I could just follow up on the<br />
Indonesia question with your indulgence with the Prime minister.<br />
These stories now coming out back home in the united States<br />
dribs and drabs about John H-uang's phone calls to his former<br />
business associates at the Lippo Group when he was a Commerce<br />
nepartment official 70 phone calls, we're now told is<br />
information that was available before the election, but only<br />
coming out now and other suggestions that some of your aides<br />
were urging other aides over their objections not to release all<br />
of this information once you had it aren't you concerned that<br />
the impression is going to be created that you're trying to<br />
stonewall, that you do have something to hide? Isn't it better<br />
lust to come clean and release everything right away instead of<br />
letting It Just come out piecemeal like this?<br />
THE PRESIDENT: Well, for one thing, one of the<br />
things that we have learned the hard way is that when you release<br />
something as soon as you have it, then somebody is always saying,<br />
well, why didn't you release something else. I don't personally<br />
see any problem with any of the information that I've seen so<br />
far. I think we should answer whatever questions are asked.<br />
I've told everybody else to do the same thing. But, you know,<br />
I've personally, I've answered the questions that were asked of<br />
me in a way I think are entirely appropriate, and I think that's<br />
what-everybody else should do. And I don't think there's a real<br />
issue there. Q come forward and answer these questions<br />
Publicl. y? THE PRESIDENT: I believe that let me just say<br />
this I believe that everyone will have to deal with that in<br />
his or her own way. But one of the things I would urge you to<br />
do, remembering what happened to Mr. Jewel in* Atlanta,<br />
remembering what has happened to so many of the accusations over<br />
the last four years made against me that turned out to be totally<br />
baseless, I lust think that we ought to make sure we've got we<br />
ought to just get the facts out and they should be reported.<br />
That's what I've encouraged everybody to do and that's what we'll<br />
do. Thank you very much.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: Thanks very much.<br />
