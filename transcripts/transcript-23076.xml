    <content><![CDATA[<p>At Remembrance Day services being held across Australia, today we remember the armistice which ended the Great War and the sacrifice of our armed forces in times of conflict.</p>
<p>On Remembrance Day we stop and observe that moment when the guns fell silent.</p>
<p>We remember the Australians who have given their lives in the service of our nation and in the defence of our values.</p>
<p>They are our nationâs sons and daughters.</p>
<p>May our countryâs remembrance of them and their sacrifice remain ever strong.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
