ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Interest rates are important to all Australians. The level of<br />
interest rates can have an immediate and direct impact on our<br />
quality of life.<br />
They particularly affect young men and women wanting to buy homes,<br />
and to families and others wanting to borrow money to make<br />
improvements to their homes. They are also of special concern<br />
to small businesses and farmers, who rely on borrowed money to<br />
keep operating and to expand.<br />
They affect the capacity for large companies to raise money to<br />
expand their polants and factories and thus produce more jobs.<br />
In other words, the level of interest rates in a community has<br />
dir~ ct-imtvact on lifestyles and on employment levels.<br />
For these reasons, a key part in this Government's economic<br />
policy, has been to reduce interest rates substantially and in<br />
every area. We have started that process.<br />
The reduction in market prices for Government Bonds since the<br />
beginning of September amounts to the first consistent downward<br />
movement in more than four years. We have also seen this downward<br />
movement spread to other rates for some building societies and<br />
credit unions. major industrial companies have been able to<br />
raise money at lower interest rates.<br />
I am confident wi: my Government's policies continuing that<br />
falls in important interest rates could add up to a total of 2<br />
per cent wirnClin 12 months.<br />
The reductilcn in interest rates will also be reflected in building<br />
societies ! I=: dirig rates and bank overdraft rates, which of course<br />
affect thousands of Australians. This will offer new hope and<br />
give new ccnfiidence to young Australians seeking to buy or build<br />
their first home. It will offer new incentives for families and<br />
to add to or improve their own homes.<br />
What would happen to interest rates under the announced policies<br />
of Labor-? / Their<br />

Their policies would clearly mean higher interest rates. They<br />
want to add greatly to government spending and to increase the<br />
Government deficit to finance their expensive schemes. That can<br />
only mean one thing higher inflation and increased Government<br />
borrowing, which in turn will force interest rates up.<br />
So, inevitably, under Mr. Whitlam, interest rates will again<br />
become a burden. Australians will pay directly for a return to<br />
higher and higher interest rates. The cost of owning a home<br />
will go up, and job opportunities will be lost.<br />
It is for that reason, because of that price, that Mr. Whitlam<br />
does not discuss the question. He knows the consequences of his<br />
large spending plans on interest rates. He knows the price we<br />
will all pay.<br />
In this election there is a clear choice. It has rarely been<br />
clearer. Labor stand for big spending which will lead to<br />
increased inflationary expectations and to increased inflation.<br />
This in turn will push interest rates way up.<br />
The Government will continue with prudent economic policies.<br />
We utterly reject the big spending appr That is why under<br />
my Government inflation will keep fall:' and interest rates<br />
will follow. It is only by this course . hat investment and<br />
eco:-omic recovery will continue and more jobs will open up. </p>
