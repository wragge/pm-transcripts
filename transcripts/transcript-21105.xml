    <content><![CDATA[<p>  The retirement from the Senate of the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon Richard Alston, brings to an end a distinguished parliamentary career, spanning eighteen years.</p>
<p>Over that time Senator Alston has represented the people of Victoria with diligence, enthusiasm and an unflagging determination to achieve positive results for his State and for the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>Coupled with his service to the Liberal Party prior to entering the Senate, including as President of the Victorian Division, it is a record to be proud of.</p>
<p>As a senior Cabinet minister from the election of the Coalition Government in 1996, Senator Alston has played an important role in the government's reform agenda, not least being reforms in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<p>By opening the telecommunications sector to competition, Senator Alston oversaw the dramatic increase in providers, greater choice and lower prices for consumers and marked improvements in services throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Senator Alston will be missed.  He was a most valued colleague and a good friend.  I wish him and his family well for the future.   </p>
