    <content><![CDATA[<p>In just under two weeks, the leaders of the G20 will assemble in Brisbane.</p>
<p>This will be the largest ever gathering of world leaders in our history, and it is the culmination of Australia’s presidency of the G20.</p>
<p>The G20 is the world’s most important economic forum.</p>
<p>The countries of the G20 generate 75 per cent of all world trade and 85 per cent of the world’s Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>At this G20 Summit, our focus will be on building a stronger world economy.</p>
<p>Because economic growth means more jobs, higher living standards and governments that are better able to reduce tax and fund better services.</p>
<p>Australia has already secured an agreement that G20 countries will aim to boost their collective economic growth by 2 per cent above what is currently expected over the next five years.</p>
<p>Countries have been working on their action plans and collectively, we have already reached 90 per cent of our growth target.</p>
<p>Australia is leading by example with our Economic Action Strategy – scrapping the carbon tax and the mining tax, cutting red tape costs, signing free trade agreements and undertaking the largest infrastructure investment in our history.</p>
<p>The G20 focus will be on the fundamentals of the economy: trade, infrastructure, tax and banking.</p>
<p>Our discussions will include the $1 trillion world-wide infrastructure gap, reducing tax avoidance by global companies, and increasing participation in the workforce.</p>
<p>While a stronger economy won’t solve every problem; it will make almost every problem easier to tackle.</p>
<p>So it’s an honour to be hosting the G20.</p>
<p>I know there will be inconveniences in Brisbane as the leaders gather and I thank people for their patience.</p>
<p>It is an important event for Australia.  I’m confident that it will make a lasting difference for our country and for our world.</p>
