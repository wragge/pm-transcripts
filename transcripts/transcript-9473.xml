PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY CONFERENCE,<br />
BRISBANE, FRIDAY 10 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak to you,<br />
at this first Australian National Training Authority<br />
conference. The National Training Authority has a special<br />
significance for me: I might say a special place in my<br />
heart and in my mind.<br />
Vocational training is like that warm hearts and cool<br />
heads are what we need.<br />
And I don't think I have to tell you I'm a TAFE person.<br />
I was an early leaver a normal leaver in those days<br />
and I picked up a formal qualification at Belmore<br />
Technical College.<br />
ANTA was one of the first major creations of the Keating<br />
Government: prefigured in One Nation of which<br />
vocational education and training initiatives were a $ 720<br />
million centrepiece and announced at a Youth Summit<br />
later in 1992.<br />
It seems an eternity ago three Budgets, a major<br />
economic statement, the White paper on Employment, the<br />
statement on the arts and the new media, an election,<br />
three Opposition leaders and much else.<br />
Even in those three years there have been quite<br />
remarkable changes in the lives of our people, in our<br />
national life: changes both in our economy and society,<br />
and in our understanding of ourselves and the world<br />
around us.<br />
Unemployment is at last falling, employment growing more<br />
strongly than ever before in our history, we have the<br />
fastest growing economy in the OECD, investment is<br />
booming. Our perspectives and expectations have changed. our role<br />
in the region has materially altered and appreciation of<br />
it is deeper and more sophisticated. </p>
<p>The information highway is upon us. Much more than we<br />
did three years ago, we talk about information<br />
technology, information highways, new media, Internet.<br />
Because it is happening before our eyes, we are more<br />
aware that our children will learn things we never knew,<br />
by means we never had and I fear we will never really<br />
understand. The same goes for work: the revolution in work we are<br />
living through, particularly the rise of knowledge-based<br />
industries, is changing much more than our working lives<br />
it is changing the structure of our society.<br />
And if we do not address and facilitate these changes, we<br />
will disastrously fail the generations of the next<br />
century. That is why ANTA is so important it was created to<br />
address and facilitate the changes. Its success is<br />
crucial to our future.<br />
That is why I said ANTA has a special significance for me<br />
and for the Government: because there is nothing more<br />
gratifying in a political life than to have created<br />
something for the times ahead.<br />
Governments do not always discern the currents of change.<br />
This time I know we have.<br />
When we do these things there is a buzz of approval and<br />
enlightened interest and it lasts about 10 minutes and<br />
fades.<br />
But the reality doesn't fade with it, and nor do the<br />
challenges which face us.<br />
And now, three years later, we have in ANTA a body to<br />
meet and confront them.<br />
I think of AI4TA as a bridge by which Australians can get<br />
from the old to the new into the realm of new<br />
opportunities, into the new jobs, into the new<br />
technology. From fading industries to the industries of the future.<br />
It is a bridge, but not an unchangeable, inflexible one,<br />
I hope not an impregnable bureaucratic edifice.<br />
It needs to reflect the change it is dealing with. That<br />
means it must be adaptable, flexible, portable,<br />
approachable. It has to get women across, working mothers, new<br />
migrants, poor Australians and their children, Aboriginal<br />
Australians. </p>
<p>It has to be a bridge f or people in the growing number of<br />
industries where retraining of various kinds is necessary<br />
as often as every two years.<br />
It is not the only bridge we have, but it is an essential<br />
one. It provides the framework for the journey.<br />
As our economy and society changes it has to give<br />
Australians the training they will need to keep up, to<br />
make the transition from unskilled to skilled, from<br />
manufacturing industries to knowledge-based industries,<br />
from school to work, from unemployment to employment.<br />
In the last Atlantic Monthly, Peter Drucker declared that<br />
in future there would be " no poor countries. Only<br />
ignorant countries.",<br />
Australia simply cannot afford to be an " ignorant<br />
country". Nor can we afford to stand still. We can't afford to let<br />
old ways of thinking govern our response to present<br />
needs, or let old institutions administer to the future.<br />
Remarkably enough there are still influential people in<br />
Australia who tell us that the 1950s was a period we<br />
might usefully try to imitate. There were so many jobs<br />
in the fifties, after all.<br />
For once a bureaucratic answer is the right one. " Not<br />
applicable".<br />
Certainly there were jobs in the fifties.<br />
I can personally vouch for it I left school to take<br />
one. But, I hardly need to tell this audience that my job and<br />
most of the others of that era have gone gone as<br />
emphatically forever as those in farming, which a century<br />
ago were still the most numerous of all.<br />
I may not need to tell this audience but it is very<br />
important that all Australians know the way the wind is<br />
blowing. It is likely that by early in the new century a third or<br />
more of jobs in Australia will be in the so-called<br />
knowledge-based industries.<br />
That does not mean our manufacturing industry will shrink<br />
quite the opposite.<br />
In the past ten years our manufacturing output has<br />
increased by over thirty per cent, but the number of<br />
people directly employed in manufacturing is actually<br />
less than it was a decade ago. </p>
<p>In manufacturing, we produce more vastly more but<br />
with fewer people.<br />
Increasingly those people need skills and training. And,<br />
of course, so do the people in the industries where the<br />
new jobs are the service industries, the<br />
knowledge based industries.<br />
The unmistakeable fact is that, if we are to serve this<br />
and future generations, we need ANTA; we need the<br />
initiatives in Working Nation; we need NETTFORCE; we<br />
need a vocational education and training system as good<br />
as any in the world.<br />
We need more of these things to be a competitive and<br />
efficient country, a country in the front rank of nations<br />
and a fair and equitable social democracy.<br />
ANTA is more than a bridge between old industries and new<br />
ones, old lives and new ones it is a bridge between the<br />
past Australia and the future. It will be an essential<br />
underpinning of our success as a nation in the 21st<br />
century. I said before that there had been dramatic changes even<br />
in the three short years since ANTA was first proposed.<br />
One of those changes has been in education and training<br />
itself.<br />
We pledged those $ 720 million dollars in One Nation<br />
because we had reached an impasse: schools and<br />
universities had grown rapidly, but TAFE was actually<br />
declining. And budgetary problems left the States unable to expand<br />
the system.<br />
The changes have been remarkable. We all might take a<br />
little uncomplacent pride in them, and even allow<br />
ourselves to think that, if we can do these national<br />
things in vocational education, we can do them in other<br />
spheres of great national importance.<br />
In short, we now have national strategic planning of<br />
vocational education and training; cohesion and<br />
cooperation in place of the dislocation and<br />
inefficiencies of the past.<br />
We have certainty of funding for the States triennial<br />
funding and through-growth funding.<br />
We have two spheres of government working through a<br />
ministerial council; employers and unions working<br />
together on an industry-controlled board.<br />
And, in what may one day be seen as a landmark in our<br />
national development, we have ANTA established in </p>
<p>Brisbane, one of the dynamic regions of Australia: one<br />
of the regions of the future, with many of the industries<br />
of the future.<br />
Over the period 1993-97 the Commonwealth will have<br />
contributed $ 1.5 billion to vocational education and<br />
training.<br />
We have more than doubled our expenditure since 1989.<br />
Most importantly of all, by the end of this year we will<br />
be able to say that in the last four years the number of<br />
people enrolled in TAFE has grown by 25 per cent that<br />
more than a quarter of a million Australians have entered<br />
the system.<br />
This expansion of training will soon be transforming the<br />
Australian workforce.<br />
To illustrate this: in 1986, 45 per cent of Australian<br />
workers held post-school qualifications. In 1995 we are<br />
on track to a figure of 65 per cent by 2001.<br />
In other words, from a country where a significant<br />
majority of workers held no post-school qualifications to<br />
one where two-thirds do.<br />
In addition, ANTA is now spearheading the implementation<br />
of Australia's new entry-level training system the<br />
Australian Vocational Training System which will<br />
combine education and training with experience in<br />
workplaces. This will mean a more integrated framework for existing<br />
training pathways, such as apprenticeships and<br />
traineeships; and it will enable young people to combine<br />
more traditional academic school subjects with vocational<br />
education. I think we can say now that we are well on the way to<br />
making a reality the concept of an employment, education<br />
and training entitlement for young people leaving school.<br />
And I might say in passing, that while Governments bear<br />
the ultimate responsibility for achieving that objective,<br />
we should set ourselves the complementary goal of seeing<br />
it become a community value one held by parents,<br />
schools, employers and, of course, young people<br />
themselves. Nor should we forget that in the modern economy the need<br />
for retraining among older workers and older unemployed<br />
people can be as profound as that of our young people.<br />
The process of workplace reform and enterprisebargaining,<br />
and the drive to high quality and best<br />
practice, is generating demand among companies demands </p>
<p>and opportunities f or people in occupations regarded in<br />
the past as semi-skilled or unskilled.<br />
You have clients who have had no formal education and<br />
training for perhaps fifteen or twenty years.<br />
Many will have had no education or training in this<br />
country. There can scarcely be a greater responsibility than the<br />
one which is placed on those who provide it and I<br />
suspect that, whatever short term frustrations you may<br />
encounter, in the long run fulfilling that responsibility<br />
will be a uniquely rewarding experience.<br />
You are involved in a quiet revolution, one which is<br />
recognised and admired abroad; and, more importantly,<br />
one which will significantly shape the Australian economy<br />
and society in the next century.<br />
Now I could spend the remainder of this speech listing<br />
further achievements like the fact that today almost<br />
the same number of young people are studying at TAPE the<br />
year after leaving school as are going to university.<br />
Or I could instance some of the many benefits of growth<br />
in the training sector.<br />
The kinds of benefits which flow from the Vehicle<br />
Industry Certificate which has been developed at Ford.<br />
Or the on-site training which is providing skills<br />
and learning opportunities to workers in food processing<br />
companies in the Murray Goulburn area.<br />
I could itemise the progress and talk at length about<br />
some of the more remarkable achievements of recent times.<br />
I could, for instance, talk about the initiatives in<br />
Working Nation the most comprehensive response to the<br />
aftermath of the international recession of any country<br />
in the world.<br />
But it is mandatory on occasions such as this to point<br />
out that there is still a great deal to be done and many<br />
obstacles to overcome along the way.<br />
Mandatory and necessary.<br />
We have made tremendous progress, but not yet as much as<br />
we made in expanding secondary and higher education in<br />
the 1980s.<br />
We transformed the university sector from an elite to a<br />
mass education system, and we doubled retention rates in<br />
secondary schools. </p>
<p>We need a revolution of at least the same proportions in<br />
vocational education.<br />
If it is true that, as Peter Drucker says, " knowledge is<br />
the only meaningful resource today", we have to deliver<br />
knowledge to the workforce as a whole.<br />
The imperatives of economic success demand it. The equal<br />
imperatives of social equity and cohesion demand it.<br />
To provide it, we will need to dissolve the boundaries<br />
between schools and training, and between training<br />
institutions and industry.<br />
We are competing with countries like Germany, Sweden and<br />
France, which have well developed links between employer<br />
associations, training institutions and schools.<br />
Asian economies like Taiwan and Korea are rapidly moving<br />
in the same direction. We must move just as quickly.<br />
If we want a high wage/ high skills economy with high<br />
levels of employment, a world class training system is<br />
absolutely essential.<br />
Let me, then, briefly address three areas which it seems<br />
to me, we will need to tackle if we are to develop and<br />
maintain such a world class system.<br />
First, we will need to improve the quality and<br />
responsiveness of the system.<br />
Second, we will need to expand it expand it to the<br />
point where vocational education and training is the<br />
norm, not the exception.<br />
And third, we will need to get the balance right the<br />
balance between different types of education and<br />
training.<br />
Quality, understandably enough, is often measured by the<br />
standard of buildings and the qualifications of staff.<br />
Given the standards of a few years ago compared with the<br />
world class facilities and teachers we now have, we could<br />
be forgiven for thinking that we are rapidly approaching<br />
our quality goals.<br />
Ultimately, however, the quality of our training system<br />
has to be measured by its responsiveness to clients its<br />
responsiveness to industry and students alike.<br />
I am well aware that over the last few years industry has<br />
sometimes complained that the training reform agenda is<br />
hard to comprehend, and that the system assumed a<br />
knowledge of industry's requirements instead of taking<br />
steps to actually find out what they are. </p>
<p>The skill needs of industry and individuals are changing<br />
so rapidly there must be mechanisms to ensure that<br />
training and industry are moving hand in hand.<br />
Consider for a moment just two statistics: in the German<br />
metals engineering industry knowledge turns over every<br />
five years, and in the German information technology<br />
industry it turns over every two years.<br />
We need to ensure that training reform keeps up with the<br />
astonishing rate of industrial change. We therefore need<br />
to ensure that training reform is industry driven.<br />
Working Nation set us on that course and since then ANTA<br />
has undertaken its own review of the reform agenda.<br />
I am pleased to say a number of key reforms are in train.<br />
For instance, an Enterprise Stream has been developed to<br />
cater for the special training requirements of larger<br />
enterprises. And ANTA will be undertaking a series of pilots of<br />
userAchoice which will allow firms to choose the provider<br />
for off-the-job training.<br />
The second great challenge is to expand the coverage.<br />
By 2001, 95 per cent of 19 year olds will have completed<br />
Year 12 or an initial post-school qualification, or be<br />
participating in formally recognised education and<br />
training. That is the goal agreed to by all Australian governments.<br />
In Working Nation we announced a series of measures to<br />
extend the coverage:<br />
The Youth Training Initiative, to enable fifteen to<br />
seventeen year olds to get into education, training or<br />
work through individual case management;<br />
The Australian Student Traineeship Foundation to<br />
enable Year 11 and 12 students to receive vocational<br />
training and work experience; and<br />
The National Employment and Training Taskforce<br />
NETTFORCE which, under the leadership of Bill Kelty and<br />
Lindsay Fox, has already approved the establishment of 21<br />
industry training companies and consulted with State<br />
training authorities to streamline their accreditation<br />
arrangements. These reforms will make a difference, but they need the<br />
support of other players.<br />
Employers will have to take on more trainees, and State<br />
school systems will have to become flexible enough for </p>
<p>students to combine vocational training with academic<br />
study. It seems to me we should consider moving towards a<br />
European model where employer associations take a key<br />
responsibility for training.<br />
It may be possible to encourage larger employers to pool<br />
their incentive payments with an employer association, so<br />
that projects can be undertaken to improve training<br />
within an industry.<br />
When we speak of coverage, we also need to recognise that<br />
the current system is not doing enough for women.<br />
Women are woefully under-represented in trade training.<br />
And only half as many women as men receive financial or<br />
other support from their employer when they undertake<br />
education. No doubt there are complex reasons for this imbalance.<br />
But one thing is perfectly clear we will not be able to<br />
say that we have reformed training if we have replicated<br />
the inequities of the old system.<br />
It may be that we should give priority to developing new<br />
training arrangements for industries which do not<br />
currently train their employees.<br />
We know that it is in these industries, like community<br />
services, that the largest number of women work women<br />
who have not had access to recognised training.<br />
It may also be possible to encourage the establishment of<br />
group training companies for women only. Such companies<br />
might coordinate the placement of female trainees and<br />
apprentices between small businesses, and give trainees<br />
the support they need to enter training and see it<br />
through.<br />
The third great challenge might be expressed as a<br />
question: have we been expanding universities at the<br />
expense of vocational education and training?<br />
Parenthetically, I might acknowledge that there is an<br />
irony to this in Queensland which has a deficit of higher<br />
education places a deficit, I can assure you, which we<br />
intend to rectify.<br />
Nationally, however, the figures are a cause for some<br />
satisfaction. Commonwealth funding available to higher education has<br />
risen from $ 3 billion in 1983 to $ 4.8 billion in 1995<br />
an increase of more than 60 per cent. </p>
<p>In the same period, student numbers have increased by<br />
more than 70 per cent.<br />
There is no question that over the last two years, across<br />
Australia, it has become much easier to get into a<br />
university. The fact is we need more entrants to the labour force<br />
with trade and vocational qualifications.<br />
In every recovery up to now we have found ourselves<br />
importing trade qualifications and vocational skills.<br />
To reverse that phenomenon we probably need to reverse a<br />
popular attitude: we need to raise the status of<br />
vocational training both in reality and in the minds of<br />
our young people.<br />
For, while some surveys show us that more than half of<br />
Year 12 students aspire to professional status, only 14<br />
per cent of the workforce have professional status.<br />
The point is vocational skills and the teaching of them<br />
should have a comparable status.<br />
There is every reason to believe that the perception and<br />
the reality are both changing.<br />
Unmet demand for TAFE places is now 36 per cent higher<br />
than unmet demand for higher education.<br />
ANOP surveys show that the proportion of students who are<br />
choosing TAFE over university entrance has increased from<br />
to 25 per cent.<br />
There is no question that TAFE is gaining acceptance as<br />
one of the two major pathways in tertiary education.<br />
So, by way of coming to a conclusion: we are doing well,<br />
no one should doubt our resolve or our belief that the<br />
direction we are taking is the right one.<br />
But we are also very conscious of the size and complexity<br />
of the task and the hurdles we have to negotiate.<br />
Of all the points I might stress this morning, I would<br />
choose this one: the issue of vocational education and<br />
training transcends all other loyalties whatever they<br />
might be to States and Territories; regions; social<br />
groups; gender, race or ethnicity; and personal political<br />
affiliations. It is truly a national issue.<br />
It is in the first place, a national issue of equity. </p>
<p>Expanding vocational education to the degree that we are<br />
expanding it, is very likely to assist those among our<br />
young people who are relatively disadvantaged.<br />
And it is certainly the case that once individuals<br />
acquire post-school qualifications, their lifetime<br />
incomes and opportunities are significantly increased.<br />
Without doubt, it will be the best investment they ever<br />
make. In other words, the challenge we have taken on all of<br />
us in this room is probably the single most important<br />
policy initiative we can take to redress lifetime income<br />
inequalities in Australia.<br />
Vocational education and training is, in the second<br />
place, a national issue of efficiency.<br />
There is a parallel here with the Job Compact. The Job<br />
Compact works by assisting the long-term unemployed back<br />
into the mainstream of the workforce, a move which helps<br />
not only some of the most disadvantaged in the community,<br />
but the economy itself to reach its collective full<br />
potential. In the case of vocational education and training, we have<br />
to recognise as a nation that we are not just<br />
increasing the life chances of the disadvantaged, but<br />
guaranteeing our economic competitiveness.<br />
Technological change does not drop from the sky or emerge<br />
from the mind of a particularly brilliant professor of<br />
physics or sociology.<br />
We now know that, in the main, technological change comes<br />
from the adoption of innovation in ways that suit<br />
particular workplace environments.<br />
And there is now considerable evidence that the level of<br />
training of a firm's workforce substantially determines<br />
how efficiently new processes are converted into<br />
productive output.<br />
That is to say, skill formation begets technical change<br />
and we all know that technical change begets<br />
productivity, and productivity begets prosperity and<br />
material well being.<br />
That is what I mean by saying we need warm hearts and<br />
cool heads.<br />
So this is a great enterprise: not so much a<br />
revolutionary one, as one which must keep pace with the<br />
revolution which is already taking place. </p>
<p>I think we all know that there is going to be no end to<br />
the challenge, and that success itself will present new<br />
challenges. We should tell ourselves that this is in the nature of<br />
our era.<br />
The reward will not be a day when we can say the task is<br />
done. Rather, it will be knowing that by our efforts countless<br />
Australians of this and future generations will have<br />
opportunities that would be otherwise denied them.<br />
That they will have crossed the bridge to the 21st<br />
century and Australia will have too.<br />
