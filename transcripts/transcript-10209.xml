C R ( Bert) Kelly<br />
The death of Bert Kelly last Friday has removed from the Australian<br />
political scene a person who made a remarkable contribution to debate on<br />
economic issues in Australia.<br />
Bert Kelly was almost certainly the first and definitely the foremost<br />
parliamentary advocate in the post World War 11 period of lower tariffs<br />
and freer trade.<br />
At a time when it was unfashionable to do so he, almost single handedly,<br />
argued in Parliament for less government regulation and other economic<br />
policies now commonly described as economic rationalism.<br />
He withstood ridicule and attack from both sides of politics.<br />
In time hie was to see the ideas lie championed almost alone for so long<br />
enjoy mnuch wider political support.<br />
Bert Kelly argued his cause with high intelligence and superb humour. A<br />
Kelly speech from the backbench always attracted a good attendance in<br />
thle House.<br />
His " Modest Members" colun in The Australian Financial Review<br />
became synonymous with the push for greater economic liberalism.<br />
His admirers formed the Society of Modest Members which became a<br />
power forum for further debate.<br />
He faithifully represented the rural electorate of Wakefield in South<br />
Australia for 19 years. He served as Minister for Works in the Holt<br />
Governm-ent and as Minister for the Navy in the Gorton Government. </p>
<p>I particularly remember the kindness that he and his fellow South Australia<br />
Liberal, Jim Forbes extended to me as a new member when I entered<br />
parliament in 1974.<br />
Those now on the Australian political scene who take it as given that the<br />
contemporary economic debate is largely about the pace of further change,<br />
not whether we should return to the days of high protection, should<br />
remember the irnense debt of gratitude which is owed to Bert Kelly.<br />
On behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia I record my appreciation for his<br />
years of service and loyalty to our party. To his wife Lona and his family<br />
I extend my deep sympathy on their great loss.<br />
19 January 1997<br />
