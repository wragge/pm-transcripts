FOREWJORD FOR SPECIAL JUBILEE ISSUE OF " IMPETUS",<br />
MAGAZINE OF THE CHAMBER OF 11ANU1FACTUBES OF N~ EW<br />
SOUTH WALES.<br />
The strength of Its manufacturing industry is one<br />
of the yardsticks by which a nation measures its progress<br />
and in this respect Australia can count itself fortunate,<br />
for per capita we are one of the world's most higrhly<br />
industrialised countries.<br />
Growing up beside the great primary indutries<br />
which laid the first foundations of national development,<br />
the manufacturing industries have added a rich diversity<br />
to our society ; Ai have given invaluable balance to the<br />
economy, The wide spread of employment which they give and<br />
the range and volume of their output make us less vuirarable<br />
to overseas market fluctuations than we used to be. A<br />
nation's strength and stability depend upon such things.<br />
The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of<br />
Australia have had an effective hand in this gro-Ath for<br />
they have not only sought to stimulate it, but to give it<br />
purpose and direction. I am pleased therefore, on the<br />
occasion of your 60th birthd1ay, to ofler my congratulations<br />
on past achievements and to express good wishes for the<br />
future. R. G. MENZIES<br />
