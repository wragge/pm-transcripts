EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE~ PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF RODNEY HALL ' S NOVEL THE SECOND BRIDEGROOM<br />
ADELAIDE FESTIVAL OF ARTS, 4.3OPM 6 MARCH 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I'm pleased -to be here today at one of the world's great<br />
arts festivals.<br />
My purpose is both to launch Rodney Hall's book and to<br />
celebrate it.<br />
It's a pleasure to be here because I know Rodney Hall, I<br />
know some of his ideas, I know how much he cares about this<br />
country, and I know he is going to make a great contribution<br />
to our national life as Chairman of the Australia Council.<br />
I also know that this book, which was published in hardback<br />
last year, was never officially launched.<br />
And any book which has enjoyed such magnificent acclaim as<br />
this book has, deserves to be launched deserves to be<br />
celebrated. I doubt if any book by an Australian has received better<br />
reviews than this one.<br />
Some of them are modestly repeated on the cover the<br />
Financial Times calls it a modern classic<br />
Rodney will forgive me for mentioning that the Financial<br />
Times also gave me a good review recently, for a speech I<br />
made in the presence of Her Majesty, and another I made in<br />
the presence of Her Loyal Australian Opposition.<br />
This does not mean the Financial Timesq is easy to please<br />
it means they are discerning.<br />
On the same cover you will see that Dinny O'Hearn says the<br />
book is evenL better than the one before it, and the one<br />
before it was a masterpiece.<br />
This is the sort of language I have always liked. </p>
<p>In Frankfurt: they said Rodney Hall ranks with Garcia<br />
Marquez. In New York they compared him with William<br />
Faulkner and Flannery O'Conner.<br />
In the Sidney Morning Herald Stephen Knight ranked him with<br />
Patrick White.<br />
And back to London where the Sunday Time-, said " in Rodney<br />
Hall Australia has produced another great novelist".<br />
For this extraordinary critical reception Rodney Hall<br />
deserves our congratulations although I know he won't mind<br />
my saying that you haven't really been reviewed until you've<br />
been reviewed in the London tabloids.<br />
" Hands orf our language, cobber!", they would have said.<br />
Given the ex;. pert and international literary judgements that<br />
have been made on Rodney's recent work, it would be<br />
presumptuous of me to pass any judgement.<br />
But I can saLy that I enjoyed The Second Bridegroom and<br />
that it's a novel of great interest to anyone who has<br />
thought about European civilisation in this country.<br />
Anyone who has ever wondered what it means to be an<br />
Australian. The novel rang a Celtic bell in me. Like most Australians of<br />
Irish extraction, Celtic mythology and the Celtic<br />
temperament has always seemed to me a powerful force in our<br />
make-up, and in the creation of our legends and traditions.<br />
This is a book with any number of political and cultural<br />
implications for Australia.<br />
For instance! it's a very powerful reminder that we have to<br />
come to terms with Aboriginal Australia pre and post<br />
European.<br />
Until we do this until we start to make some real progress<br />
towards closing the gap in both attitudes and living<br />
standards I think there will always be a feeling among us<br />
that maybe wre don't quite belong, that we're not serious,<br />
that we're simply here for the view.<br />
Or just here! to make forgeries of the Old World.<br />
These are old themes in Australia: the Celticry and<br />
Aboriginality, the business of being what Manning Clark<br />
called Austral-Britons.<br />
Or as Rodney, Hall puts it Australians became a race with<br />
one foot in the ' air.<br />
If I might tie allowed to use that phrase for my own<br />
purposes, Rodney, allow me to say that I would like to see<br />
Australians put the foot down. </p>
<p>These cultural cross currents are no bad thing, of course.<br />
They have produced a lot of our intellectual energy. A lot<br />
of our difference in fact.<br />
And, contrary to the Les Paterson stereotype with which<br />
someone recently branded me, I don't have any time at all<br />
for the view that it's no good if it's not authentically<br />
Australian. You're looking at someone who has a great affection for<br />
Europe. Whoi counts among his greatest pleasures European<br />
architecture and European music.<br />
But I am not: British or French.<br />
I'm Australian. It's the land I know, the people I know,<br />
the resonances I feel, and my commitment to it happens to be<br />
unequivocal, unambiguous and absolute.<br />
If Australians are encouraged to think about it, I don't<br />
think any of' them will want the cobwebs to remain. I don't<br />
think they want their identity compromised.<br />
These things really should not have to be said in a nation<br />
which in truth is not so young any more.<br />
But, as we've discovered in the last couple of weeks, when<br />
these simplEt, unexceptional things arp said, they produce<br />
responses Which are quite extraordinary.<br />
They've been said, of course, by writers and artists,<br />
they've been~ said on the stage and on film for years since<br />
the turn of the century and before.<br />
That, of course, is one of the great virtues of the arts and<br />
why a country is healthier when they flourish. They can<br />
provide us writh a truer vision of ourselves than politicians<br />
or anyone else can.<br />
That is one of the principle reasons why my government will<br />
support the arts in this country.<br />
It is also cone of the reasons why we are in favour of<br />
appointing more artists to arts bodies, putting more of the<br />
focus of arts policy on artists, and doing all we can to<br />
improve the professional standing and income of our artists<br />
and why I'm very happy to be able to announce today that<br />
two great Australian artists, Carl Vine and Nanette Hassall<br />
will shortly be reccomended to the Governor General for<br />
appointment to the Australia Council.<br />
There is no doubt that their knowledge and expertise will be<br />
an enormous benefit, and their presence, inevitably, a<br />
boost to the! Council's standing. </p>
<p>4<br />
The arts of course play a variety of roles in this country<br />
but the most significant I think is making us believe in<br />
ourselves. I don't mean that patriotism is a prerequisite I mean that<br />
books like the one that we're celebrating today helps define<br />
us to ourselves and to the world, and that is very<br />
important. I may as well tell you now, however, that I will not be<br />
leaving it up the artists to do this you are going to hear<br />
a lot more in the way of uncompromising belief, including<br />
uncompromising reference to our history.<br />
As I said there are some among us who intend to put the<br />
nation's foot down.<br />
Let me once again congratulate you Rodney, thank you for the<br />
metaphor, and all of you for having me here.<br />
ADELAIDE/ CANBERRA </p>
