    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced that the HMAS Sydney II Memorial in Geraldton, Western Australia, has been recognised as a national memorial.</p>
<p>The HMAS Sydney II Memorial commemorates a tragic event in Australia's military history  -  the loss of HMAS Sydney II and her entire crew of 645 men. HMAS Sydney II was the pride of the fleet and her loss was keenly felt by the whole nation in November 1941.</p>
<p>The Memorial in Geraldton was dedicated on 18 November 2001, on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the sinking. It overlooks the Indian Ocean where HMAS Sydney II was lost. The wreck was located in March 2008 off the coast of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Government recognises memorials as being of national significance if they commemorate a significant aspect of war time history and play a major role in community commemorative activities. The HMAS Sydney II Memorial does just this.</p>
<p>This declaration recognises the efforts of the City of Geraldton-Greenough and civic groups such as the Rotary Club of Geraldton in constructing and maintaining this fitting tribute to the crew of HMAS Sydney II.</p>
<p>It also recognises the many volunteers whose dedication to sharing this memorial with visitors ensures that HMAS Sydney II will never be forgotten.</p>
