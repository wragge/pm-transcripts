Tonight I was pleased to present the prestigious 2002 Business Arts Partnership of the Year award to the Seven Network and Opera Australia tonight.<br />
The Seven Network and Opera Australia have worked together for six yearsâsharing venues, personnel and expertise to promote the performing arts.<br />
The commitment demonstrated by both these organisations has attracted new audiences to opera and enhanced the enjoyment of opera for devoteesâand both the Seven Network and Opera Australia are richer for the experience.<br />
This highly successful partnership was also awarded the inaugural Australia Council Media Arts Award.<br />
Individual awards for exceptional contributions to business arts partnerships were also presented, with Tony Berg from Gresham Partners receiving the Richard Pratt Business Leadership Award and Ian McRae from The Australian Ballet receiving the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Cultural Leadership Award.<br />
These awards recognise the significant support that corporate Australia offers the arts and celebrate best practice partnership models that enhance our business and creative communities.<br />
They demonstrate that the corporate sector understands that partnering the arts is not only good corporate citizenshipâit is good business.<br />
A full list of award winners will be available from the Australian Business Arts Foundation website at <a href="http://www.abaf.org.au">www.abaf.org.au</a>. </p>
