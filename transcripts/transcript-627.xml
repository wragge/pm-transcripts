    <content><![CDATA[<p> 13TH OCTOBER, 1962.<br /><br />Sirs, As the weather appears to be threatening, I think I had better begin by declaring the E. D. McKinnon Wing open.</p>
<p>( Laughter) ( Applause)</p>
<p>I am really not the best qualified person to do a task of this kind because, in my own fashion, I am a bigoted what is the word? Ballaratian, or Ballarat. I have been called worse names than that in my time. But,<br />Sir, I want to thank you for what you have said about my wife and I am happy to tell you that I have no reasonable doubt that by the time she arrives back in Australia she will be completely restored to her normal and almost turbulent vigour, ( Laughter)</p>
<p>I was delighted when I heard about this appeal.<br />I was a little taken aback when my colleague, Dan McKinnon,<br />procured somebody to write to me about it and gave me a<br />broad hint that a little donation from me would not come<br />amiss, And, as usual, he succeeded, I am not an old Ballarat<br />College boy, I am an old boy of a school in Ballarat which<br />has long since disappeared and if I am feeling a little<br />expanded occasionally I always explain to people " Grenville<br />College you see" ut it disappeared twelve months after<br />I lft ioe ( Laughter) It was a small school and when I<br />look back on those days, towards the en( of the first decade<br />of the century many of you won't remember it I remember<br />Grenville College a school so small that I got a game in<br />the football team ( Laughter). There was Ballarat College,<br />too just around the corner, under the headmastership of a<br />gentleman who I thin! I am right in saying was irreverently<br />referred to as Joe Garbetto I am open to correction on that<br />pointo Grenville College was nearby, and across the street,<br />was the boardinghouse of Ballarat College, We had well<br />let's say about 3' boys in our declining years, Ballarat<br />College might have had 50 or 60. The Ballarat Grammar<br />School, well, it was small in numbers but high in Anglican<br />pride, and between the lot of us, we didn't amount to more<br />than a fraction of the other schools. The Agricultural High<br />School was established, Oh dear, Sto Pat's next door,<br />And I want to tell you that I can very well remember<br />an occasion in the winter when, strangely enough, the snow<br />had fallen in Ballarat, fourteen inches of it, and we, being<br />less than the dust went around to Ballarat College and they<br />between us less than the dust, We collected the Ballarat<br />Grammar School and still we didn't have enough numbers and we<br />went to the School of Mines where we secured a few earnest<br />volunteers. Having recruited our strength in this fashion, we<br />went up to St. Pat's determined to storm them out. ( Laughter)<br />That was where we fell in, because with that low cunning that<br />characterises some people, they had waited for us ( Laughter)<br />and we were stormed out and we recovered some form of order<br />about a mile south of Lake Wendouree, Anyhow, theseEae simple<br />recollections. 00 0 0 0/ 2</p>
<p>But the great thing was that just as these schools<br />looked as if they might fade out and disappear, there came<br />about here a great pride in the idea of the schools, and what<br />has happened since then to Ballarat College what has happened,<br />on the other quarter of the Lake to the Grammar School? These<br />things give me immense satisfaction. In the case of Ballarat<br />College, I am happy to say -that I expect them, because there<br />is no greater tradition in the world than the Scots tradition<br />ol" scholarship. It would have been a monstrosity if Ballarat<br />College had disappeared. As it is, it is in the full flight<br />this magnificent growth, this great Appeal so magnificently<br />successful, under the auspices of my distinguished friend,<br />Mr. Dan McKinnon. These are all proofs of the fact that our<br />tradition from Scotland is a tradition of scholarship, a<br />tradition of pride, a tradition of independence,<br />I used to be rather fond of telling people that years<br />and years ago, being in Scotland on the estate of a well-known<br />man, I walked out on a Saturday morning and found myself talking<br />to what is described in Scotland as his cow-man, This was<br />his hired man. In most countries he would have been regarded<br />as instinctively, a rather illiterate fellow but very good<br />wit~ h the cattle, And inside ten minutes we had walked to the<br />corner of the field, and inside another ten minutes we were<br />leaning on a railing, and he was talking better philosophy and<br />metaphysics to me than any profesor I have ever met. He was<br />the man in charge of the cattle. This is a tremendous<br />inheritance, a tremendous instinct.<br />The other ' thing I want to say to you is that ther'e<br />are a lot of people who think that schools exist2 even good<br />ones, and universities exist to provide people with a certificate<br />that will enable them to earn a certain amount of money a Year,<br />This, ofT course is, in a sense, true. 3 ut in a profound Aense,<br />false. The great task of a great school is to produce,<br />not necessarily great men -that's a matter of chance but<br />men of quality, women of quality, people who have a sense of<br />the community in them, rather than a sense of their own<br />individual advantage. Therefore, I hope the day will never<br />come when schools like this chutrch schools, independent<br />schools will disappear in the great name of uniformity, In<br />fact Sir, that brings me to the last thing that I want to<br />say Z-0 you. Because the rain is falling.<br />There is, in our own country I say this to you<br />after great experience and thnought a frightful passion for<br />uniformity. This is a disastrous passion whoever goes to<br />school in Queensland must be taught in exactly the same way<br />as whoever goes to school in Tasmania-whatever rules apply<br />to people who live in the tropics must be exactly the same as<br />the rules that apply to people who live in the half-frozen<br />South. This, I venture to say, is nonsense. The genius in<br />our race, and in the history of our race has not been a genius<br />for uniformity. It's been a genius for Aifference, for individuality,<br />for personality developed, for a superb conflict of mind<br />with mind, so long as they are all instructed, civilised, sensible<br />minds. And that's why I hope the day will never come when schools<br />like Ballarat College will have been submerged in the broad<br />stream of purely State institutions,,<br />Don't let us be too uniform,, Let us be individual.<br />Let us have our own character,, Let us believe in our own traditioiL<br />because if we do that we will contribute to the sum total of<br />Australian nationhood something superbly valuable and indeed<br />imperishable. Now, on the whole, I am getting wetter than you are,<br />but I think the time has come to say, " You are now relieved from<br />duty," I have the singular privilege of declaring the Dan<br />McKinnon Wing of this great and famous school open.<br />2</p>
