PRESS SIATI.: MI.: NT 6 April 1975<br />
VIETNAMESE CIII , DREN IN SYDNEY<br />
The Prime Minister and Mrs Whitlam visited<br />
both the Quarantine Station at North [ lead and the Royal<br />
Alexandria Hospital for Children in Sydney this<br />
afternoon. After Mr Whitlam's visit to North Head<br />
it was announced that senior Australian Government and<br />
State Government officials were working closely to<br />
streamline arrangements for the Vietnamese children<br />
to join adoptive parents.<br />
More than half the children are receiving<br />
hospital treatment in Sydney but none is said to be in<br />
danger. At North Head, mere than 40 voluntary workers<br />
are helping medical and nursing staff care for the<br />
children. . Health checks are continuing on all children<br />
and it will be some days before these are completed.<br />
Officials stressed that these checks were<br />
essential for the welfare of the children and it was<br />
important that these be completed before the children<br />
were moved.<br />
