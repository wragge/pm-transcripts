    <content><![CDATA[<p>
  Last night's comments by the leader of One Nation about the 1967</p>
<p> Referendum on aboriginal issues were factually wrong in two important</p>
<p> respects.</p>
<p> She was wrong to say that the 1967 Referendum gave Aboriginal and</p>
<p> Torres Strait Islanders the vote. Their right to vote already existed,</p>
<p> including under State laws. The Referendum gave the Commonwealth concurrent</p>
<p> powers with the States in relation to aboriginal people and put beyond</p>
<p> doubt that indigenous people were finally counted in the census along</p>
<p> with all other Australians.</p>
<p> In other words, the 1967 Referendum was about treating all Australians</p>
<p> equally.</p>
<p> It was not the 1967 Referendum which produced bad indigenous affairs</p>
<p> policies. Those bad policies came from the Hawke and Keating governments.</p>
<p> Not only did their policies permit mal-administration but they also</p>
<p> included a tendency to brand any Coalition critic of their aboriginal</p>
<p> affairs policies as a racist or a bigot.</p>
<p> The present Government has restored proper accountability and credibility</p>
<p> in the area of aboriginal affairs.</p>
<p> It has ensured that funding is used to meet areas of disadvantage</p>
<p> in health, housing, employment and education and not for purposes</p>
<p> of political advocacy.</p>
<p> It was a Coalition Government led by the late Harold Holt and John</p>
<p> McEwen who sponsored the 1967 Referendum which secured the votes of</p>
<p> more than 90% of the Australian people. It represented a proper and</p>
<p> practical gesture towards ensuring that all Australians, irrespective</p>
<p> of their racial background, are treated equally under the laws of</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p> 15 July 1998</p>
