NATIONAL ANTHEM<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, in Perth today<br />
issued the following statement on the selected entries for<br />
the National Anthiem. Quest:.<br />
" With a National Anthem it is the music which<br />
really matters. We are still waiting to hear from our<br />
composers. " Composers are not obliged to use any of the six<br />
sets of words chosen from those submitted by the public.<br />
They can write their own words if they wish or collaborate<br />
with any writer. " The Government is niot imposing any anthem on<br />
the people. The public will be consulted in the final<br />
choice. If they decide, for instance, they want Waltzing<br />
Matilda or Advance Australia Fair, then of course we<br />
shall have it.<br />
" Opinion polls have shown clearly that the<br />
Australian people want a true Australian anthem. our aim<br />
has been to give all Australians whether they can compose<br />
music or not a chance to participate in writing an<br />
anthem. Thecir interest has been tremendous, and I thank<br />
all those who have taken part so far."<br />
Mr Whitlam recalled that when last in Perth on<br />
26 January to open the Perthi Concert Hall, he announced the<br />
national anthem quest. Today, on his~ return to Perth,<br />
hle was happy to report on its progress.<br />
