    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians, I have today written to the Prime Minister of Syria, Mr Mohamed Mustapha Miro, to extend to the government and people of Syria and to President Hafez al-Assad's family my condolences following the death of President Assad.</p>
<p>For thirty years President Assad led Syria through a turbulent period in the region's history. He was one of the most influential leaders in the Middle East.</p>
<p>We in Australia greatly valued the decision he took recently to participate in talks aimed at achieving peace in the Middle East. I would like strongly to urge President Assad's successor to continue down this path. Prosperity and an enduring regional peace would be a fitting tribute and the most appropriate epitaph to President Assad's life and to his commitment to serving his country.</p>
<p>Australia will be represented at the funeral of President Assad on 13 June in Damascus by our Ambassador to Syria, Victoria Owen.</p>
<p>13 June 2000</p>
