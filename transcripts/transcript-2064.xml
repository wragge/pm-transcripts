FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 45/ 1969<br />
BENDIGO BY-ELECTION<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton L~~ i<br />
I congratulate Councillor Cambridge on the results<br />
of the Bendigo By-Election.<br />
It is too early to say who will win the seat, and the<br />
distribution of preferences will decide this.<br />
But considering the Labor Party had an absolute<br />
majority of primary votes at the last three House of Representatives'<br />
elections for Bendigo and that by-elections traditionally go against<br />
sitting governments I believe the Liberal Party and its candidate<br />
have done well. My congratulations go also to the Country Party's<br />
Ralph Hunt for retaining Gwydir for the Government.<br />
CANBERRA 8 June 1969 </p>
