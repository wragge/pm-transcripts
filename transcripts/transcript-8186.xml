SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF VOLUME 12 OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN DICTIONARY OF BIOGRAPHY<br />
CANBERRA 7 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
The first volume of the Australian Dictionary of Biography<br />
was launched in 1966 by Sir Robert Menzies. A quarter of a<br />
century and seven Prime Ministers later, it is my very great<br />
pleasure to finish off the job.<br />
To put it quite simply, today's launch celebrates the<br />
appearance of a new landmark in the intellectual landscape<br />
of this country.<br />
Today brings to completion the original ADB project: twelve<br />
volumes of biographies covering Australia's history from the<br />
First Fleet to the outbreak of the Second World War.<br />
I am not prone to biblical quotation. But there is a<br />
compelling relevance in those stirring words from the<br />
Apocrypha: " Let us now praise famous men."<br />
The relevance is two-fold.<br />
First, the Australian Dictionary of Biography has become the<br />
foremost reference for anyone seeking information about the<br />
" famous men" and famous women of Australian history.<br />
And second, in creating these volumes, the editors and<br />
authors of the Australian Dict4onary of Biography have<br />
themselves earned the praise and the gratitude of all<br />
Australians. It was that . Iormidable pioneer . of . Australian historical<br />
studies, the late Sir Keith Hancock, who thirty three years<br />
ago convened the conference at the Australian National<br />
University that launched the ADD project.<br />
It must have seemed a breathtakingly ambitious proposal. It<br />
called for an unprecedented commitment to cooperative<br />
scholarship involving thousands of people around Australia.<br />
It demanded work that was at once scholarly and eminently<br />
readable. 3075 </p>
<p>2.<br />
And today, with the twelfth volume safely of f the press, we<br />
can lo~ ok back on 7211 biographies in the ADB and on nearly<br />
seven million words; and we can'only conclude that the plans<br />
and expectations of the ADB's founders have been met and<br />
surpased'. It is thoroughly right that. I should name those leading<br />
figures who have so expertly praised our famous men and<br />
women. As chadirman of the editorial board, Sir Keith Hancock was<br />
succeeded by Professor John La Nauze and the current<br />
incumbent Professor Ken Inglis; Professor Douglas Pike, the<br />
first general editor, was'succeeded by gode Nairn, Geoffrey<br />
Serle and, currently,* 3ohn Ritchie.<br />
Let m. e add how good it islthat Bede Nairn is with us today.<br />
His generous and productive involvement with the ADS<br />
continues, with his authorship of seven of the biographies<br />
in this volume.<br />
The Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian<br />
National University has borne most of the expenses of the<br />
project, the Melbourne University Press has been a stylish<br />
and accurate publisher.<br />
Finally, there is the veritable army of authors, nearly 3000<br />
strong, and contingents of advisers in libraries, archives,<br />
registries and historical societies around Australia and<br />
overseas who have generously contributed their time and<br />
efforts to do the leg-work, the patient digging, the<br />
painstaking research, that ultimately gives these volumes<br />
their strength and stature.<br />
The triumph of the ADD is that it has been truly a national<br />
project, in its planning and execution.<br />
It has not taken some elitist view of Australian history,<br />
glorifying the deeds of the leading public figures of<br />
Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
It has taken a truly national vantage point, that has<br />
encompassed women as well as men: shearers and . bushrangers<br />
and murderers and artists as well as Premiers and Governors<br />
and. Bishops; those born overseas as well as those born in<br />
Australia; the west coast and the smaller states as well as<br />
the~ populated south-east corner of the continent.<br />
So it is as diverse as the Australian community that it<br />
dencribes. -r<br />
In these last six volumes, covering 1891-1939, that<br />
community becomes an independent federation; undergoes the<br />
cycle of booms and busts including the Great Depression;<br />
endures the First World War and the lead-up to the Second.<br />
3076 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Reading this book about : he people oaught up in those events<br />
is like watching a parade going past an extraordinarily<br />
diverse national parade.<br />
In this the twelfth volwae alone, we have<br />
Labor's first Prime Minister, J C Watson;<br />
the tragedy of Ted Theodore;<br />
the soldier whom C E W Bean considered tli<br />
greatest man he ever knew, Sir Brudenell White;<br />
Streeton and Strehlow and a brace of Symes;<br />
the pioneer feminist Adela Pankhurst and Ethel<br />
Turner, author of Seven Little Australians;<br />
Joseph Leslie Trheodore Taylor, better known as<br />
Squizzy Taylor, whose occupation is crisply given<br />
as ' criminal';<br />
James Whelan, Just as crisply: wrecker;<br />
Fred Walker, the Vegemite man; and<br />
John Whittle, Victoria Cross winner, who by 1932<br />
was forced to beg to feed and clothe his family.<br />
Dr Johnson said that " to make dictionaries is dull work"<br />
but reading this one is far from dull.<br />
It is embued with a fantistic sense of evocative detail.<br />
We are told, for example, that John Wren died after.<br />
suffering a heart attack when Collingwood won the 1953 Grand<br />
Final; we glimpse Sydney University's Professor of Greek,<br />
William Woodhouse, spending his time on the train every<br />
morning teaching himself Albanian, Bulgarian and Hebrew.<br />
I was particularly pleased to see Sir Donald Bradman's<br />
tribute to Bill Woodfull, Test skipper during the ' Bodyline'<br />
series, and Bede Nairn's superb biography of Victor Trumper.<br />
And the ADB is embued too with a fundamental honesty. This<br />
dictionary is not an exercise in hagiography, of either the<br />
individual or the nation,. Our shortcomings are on display,<br />
too biographies of individuals who had to struggle,<br />
sometimes unsuccessfully, against community neglect or<br />
hostility.<br />
The unhappy story of the Aboriginal warrior Tjangamarra and<br />
Bill Gamage's life of the New Guinean patriot, Sumsuma, show<br />
two men whose different careers taught them depressingly<br />
similar lessons about the Australia of the Europeans.<br />
Ladies.-and gentlemen,<br />
For all these reasons, this volume is in every respect the<br />
equal of its eleven predecessors.<br />
It's very appropriate theit it should be launched in this<br />
building a building whose history lies ahead of it. 3077 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Inevitably, many of the words that will be spoken in this<br />
now Parliament House, and many of the deeds to be performed<br />
here, will one day be recorded in volumes of the Australian<br />
Dictionary of Biography that are as yet unplanned.<br />
But for all its newness, this is also a building that rests<br />
firmly on the foundations of Australian history.<br />
It embodies our parliamentary democracy and it encompasses<br />
the essence of our federal nationhood those vast enduring<br />
achievements won, at great cost, by our predecessors, many<br />
of whom of course are memorialised in the Australian<br />
Dictionary of Biogra Rhy.<br />
In this building are guaranteed the values they held dear:<br />
freedom and the supremacy of the individual in this great<br />
Australian nation.<br />
So the Australian Dictionary of Biography reminds us of what<br />
it truly means to be an Australian, and will teach future<br />
generations the basic truths of the Australian identity and<br />
the Australian achievement.<br />
In launching this volume and in commending this project I<br />
can give it no higher praise than to say that it performs<br />
those vital tasks accurately, comprehensively and with<br />
style.<br />
