FOR MEDIA I21 OCTOBER 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Great Barrier Reef is a unique and irreplaceable part<br />
of Australia's heritage. It is, in fact, one of the great<br />
natural wonders of the world.<br />
00C I am pleased to be able to announce tonight that the<br />
Governor-General has approved the proclamation of the<br />
Capricornia section of the reef as the first stage of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.<br />
The Capricornia section was chosen for the initial stage of<br />
the marine park because its reefs, shoals and waters form a<br />
distinct geographical unit. There are several habitable<br />
coral cays islands composed of coral sand and rubble<br />
often densely vegetated. These provide unrivalled<br />
opportunities for enjoyment for all Australians, and for<br />
the thousands of tourists they attract from overseas.<br />
Parts of this coral reef ecosystem are breeding areas vital<br />
to the continued survival of several species of fish, turtles<br />
and birds. The Capricornia section is also the Post accessible<br />
part of the reef. Tourist traffic from southern capitals and<br />
overseas, as well as from the nearby cities of Bundaberg,<br />
Maryborough, Gladstone and Rockhampton is becoming increasingly<br />
S heavy.<br />
The increasing use of and interest in the reef coul pose<br />
problems. While we welcome its importance as a recreational<br />
and educational facility for so many people the upsurge in<br />
interest could result in over-use.<br />
The threat to the reef comes not only from tourists, but from<br />
commercial interest in its vast resources. You will recall<br />
that in June this year I announced the Government's decisions<br />
on the question of future petroleum exploration in the area<br />
of the reef. ' In accordance with the recommendations of the<br />
Chairman of the Royal Commissions, we decided that no further<br />
petroleum exploration should occur, and that existing exploration<br />
permits would not be renewed until the results of both the short<br />
and longer term scientific research, recommended by the Royal<br />
Commissions, were available.<br />
I am also able to announce tonight that the Government has<br />
asked a panel from the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies<br />
Advisory Committee to advise on the necessary research programs<br />
and projects to increase our knowledge of the reef. </p>
<p>The panel, chaired by Professor Arthur Birch, an eminent<br />
scientist at the Australian National University, will also<br />
oversight research on the need for further protection of the<br />
reef. The task of Professor Birch and his panel will be to<br />
make sure that we get value for money in this research<br />
program, to monitor its progress and to report to the<br />
Government as results become available.<br />
We allocated $ 300,000 for the research in the Budget.<br />
Researchers presently engaged in this work include the<br />
CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the<br />
James Cook University and various other agencies. We would<br />
expect them all to actively compete for the funds available.<br />
I would like to pay tribute here to the co-operation of the<br />
Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, in the establishment<br />
of the marine park. In June, the Premier and I confirmed that<br />
it was the policy of our respective governments to prohibit<br />
any drilling on the Great Barrier Reef or any drilling which<br />
could damage the reef. The Commonwealth and Queensland have<br />
agreed to set up a ministerial council to give effect to our<br />
joint policies to protect the reef and its associated<br />
environment. The ministerial council had its inaugural meeting<br />
in Brisbane earlier this month and decided that the<br />
proclamation of thle Capricornia section of the marine park<br />
should proceed as a matter of urgency.<br />
The council also agreed that the day-to-day management of<br />
the park should be undertaken by the appropriate Queensland<br />
authorities, who, in discharging that responsibility, will<br />
be subject to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,<br />
which is a statutory authority established under Commonwealth<br />
legislation. The Marine Park Authority will continue to be responsible for<br />
recommending the Declaration of Marine Parks, developing zoning<br />
and management plans for such parks and arranging for relevant<br />
investigation and research.<br />
Let me emphasise, the proclamation of the Capricornia section<br />
of the reef is only the first step in achieving the best<br />
possible marine park. Two vital steps which are now in progress<br />
are the development of a zoning plan and a plan of management<br />
for the park. The zoning plan will be prepared by the Barrier<br />
Reef Marine Park Authority. It will seek to make sure that<br />
any adverse effects by people visiting the park will be minimal.<br />
The Authority wil. l ask the public for its views on how the<br />
park should be zoned.<br />
There will also be opportunity to comment on the draft zoning<br />
plan, which will be made public before final decisions are taken.<br />
Once the zoning arrangements are settled, the zones will require<br />
management on a day-by-day basis. Officials are presently<br />
discussing these matters so that the park will be set up as<br />
intended. While the creation and su~ cessful functioning of the ministerial<br />
council demonstrates the wisdom of involving the Queensland<br />
Government in the actions leading up to the Declaration of / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Marine Parks on the Barrier Reef I must emphasise that the<br />
final responsibility lies with the Commonwealth and that<br />
is as it should be.<br />
The proclamation of this first part of the marine park is<br />
further evidence of the Commonwealth's commitment to the<br />
conservation of our environment. -Over the past four years<br />
we have taken decisions that will guarantee that our<br />
children and their children have the opportunity to enjoy<br />
and experience the unique heritage of Australia. We took<br />
action in 1976 to stop mining on Fraser Island, the world's<br />
largest sand island, thereby helping to preserve a fragile<br />
part of our nation. We established the Kakadu National Park<br />
in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory.<br />
That park will protect and preserve the natural fauna,<br />
flora, the Aboriginal sacred rites and cave paintings and<br />
is likely to rank with famous national parks around the world.<br />
We have banned whaling and the importation of whale products<br />
after 1980. -We are studying the question of extending the<br />
ban on the import of products from animals which are<br />
endangered and we have assisted the World Wildlife Fund<br />
to establish a branch in Australia.<br />
Our commitment to conservation has been demonstrated, not<br />
by empty rhetoric, but by determined and positive action.<br />
This first proclamation. and our commitment to future<br />
development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park underlines<br />
our determination to secure the Australian environment<br />
for all Australians, for all time.<br />
I would hope that. Australians and many overseas tourists will<br />
visit our newest marine park and enjoy an environment unmatched<br />
in scale, diversity and beauty anywhere in the world. </p>
