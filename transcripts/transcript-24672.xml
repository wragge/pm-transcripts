    <content><![CDATA[<p>Major works are underway on the $896 million upgrade of the Torrens Road to River Torrens section of the North-South Corridor.</p>
<p>This project will support 480 jobs a year during construction and boost the productive capacity of Adelaideâ€™s transport network.</p>
<p>The 3.7 kilometre upgrade will deliver a three kilometre section of non-stop roadway along one of the busiest sections of the North-South Corridor, significantly reducing congestion and delays.</p>
<p>It also includes a two kilometre section of non-stop lowered motorway as well as an overpass for the Outer Harbor rail line.</p>
<p>The project will also deliver six intersection upgrades as well as improved cycling and pedestrian routes.</p>
<p>Today up to 52,000 vehicles a day use the road but once completed this section of the North-South Corridor will be able to cater for up to 115,000.</p>
<p>The more efficient movement of freight and commuters along the North-South Corridor will drive economic growth and boost productivity to help build a stronger South Australian economy.</p>
<p>By improving access to key industrial and residential growth areas, this project will help make Adelaide an even better place to live and do business.</p>
<p>Work on the project is due to be completed by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Coupled with the $620 million Darlington Upgrade which will begin later this year, these North-South Corridor upgrades will support on average more than 800 jobs a year.</p>
<p>The 2.3 kilometre Darlington Upgrade is due to begin later this year and be completed in late 2018.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and South Australian Governments have committed a joint $1.5 billion to ensure these two vital projects are delivered by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is investing a record $50 billion to build world class infrastructure for a stronger and more prosperous Australia.</p>
