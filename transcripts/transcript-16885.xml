    <content><![CDATA[<p>CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY</p>
<p>I acknowledge the First Australians on whose land we meet, and whose cultures we celebrate as among the oldest continuing cultures in human history.</p>
<p>Welcome to The Lodge - Therese and I are delighted to see you here this afternoon in support of such a good cause.</p>
<p>And one that's very close to my heart - literally.</p>
<p>DonateLife is about exactly that - donating life.</p>
<p>It's about promoting the cause of organ donation.</p>
<p>About getting people to talk about organ donation.</p>
<p>About getting families to talk about organ donation.</p>
<p>About getting as many people as possible to talk openly about their views, and their wishes.</p>
<p>That's what DonateLife Family and the DonateLife Network are all about.</p>
<p>Last week in Sydney, we saw the tragic death of a young Irish tourist after a street scuffle in Coogee.</p>
<p>Gearoid Walsh was just 23 years old.</p>
<p>He'd been in Australia for only five weeks when this senseless tragedy happened.</p>
<p>His mother flew from Ireland to be by her son's side last Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, his family made the terrible decision to switch off his life support.</p>
<p>And they also made the brave, generous, compassionate decision - to donate his organs so that others might live.</p>
<p>As Mrs Walsh said on Friday:</p>
<p>"In his death, Gearoid has helped six other Australians by being an organ donor."</p>
<p>My heart, and the heart of all Australians, goes out to the Walsh family at this difficult time.</p>
<p>And I thank them for their great grace and dignity, in acting in such a generous and forgiving spirit, to donate Gearoid's organs.</p>
<p>It's all too easy to take life for granted.</p>
<p>Too easy to take our health for granted, if we are fortunate to live without chronic disease.</p>
<p>We don't know what it is like to be hooked up to a machine that keeps you alive.</p>
<p>We don't realise how the simple things - kicking the footy around, going to school or even a short walk to the shops - can be an Everest to those whose bodies are failing them.</p>
<p>Or the constant fear, sadness and pain of watching your child's health deteriorate.</p>
<p>We don't know what it is like to hope that every time the phone rings, it is the call that could save your life.</p>
<p>Today, there are 1,700 Australians on our transplant waiting list today, waiting for that phone call.</p>
<p>The phone call that tells them that their chance for a life-saving transplant has arrived.</p>
<p>Some of you here today know that feeling all too well.</p>
<p>People like Liz Fowler.</p>
<p>Liz Fowler is a mother of two.</p>
<p>And she has lived with kidney disease for 20 years.</p>
<p>Liz is waiting for the call.</p>
<p>And has been for more than six years.</p>
<p>And she has two absolutely essential reasons for needing that call:</p>
<p>Her son, who is severely autistic and has been diagnosed with cancer;</p>
<p>Her daughter has won a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport. Liz wants to see her row in London at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Liz is one of 1,700 Australians waiting for a call.</p>
<p>Then there is Lachy Wallis, from my home town of Brisbane.</p>
<p>Lachy and his dad David, mum Lisa and little brother Mitchell, are here with us this afternoon.</p>
<p>Looking at Lachy today it is hard to believe that this young bloke was so sick at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>When he was put on the transplant waiting list, his health was deteriorating so rapidly that Lisa and David did not know if he would survive until a suitable donor was found.</p>
<p>So dad was tested for his suitability as a living donor.</p>
<p>And a week before David was due to have a third of his liver removed, the call came.</p>
<p>A liver had become available.</p>
<p>Lisa and David went into shock.</p>
<p>It was far from a celebration.</p>
<p>The reality of the situation hit home - that young Lachy, who was very ill at this stage, was about to undergo a very long and very risky operation.</p>
<p>But on top of that, Lisa said, was the knowledge that the liver was available because someone had died.</p>
<p>And a family somewhere was grieving for a lost loved one.</p>
<p>Lachy and his family know the power of a donor's gift.</p>
<p>And once Lachy came out the other side of the operation, the Wallis family silently thanked the donor and allowed themselves to enjoy the pure happiness of that gift.</p>
<p>Now when people ask Lachy how he's feeling he replies "I've never felt better".</p>
<p>And he is having swimming lessons three times a week and he is trying to gain enough strength and weight to get back on the footy field.</p>
<p>We wish you luck mate and hope to see you flying down the wing very soon.</p>
<p>On average, people on the transplant list wait between six months and four years.</p>
<p>Two people die each week waiting for a transplant.</p>
<p>So far this year 189 generous Australians became organ donors, resulting in a new chance at life for 608 Australians.</p>
<p>To those Australian families who said yes to donation, we thank you for making the decision to give others a special and deeply personal gift.</p>
<p>One of those families is with us today - the Kennetts from Adelaide.</p>
<p>Their wife and mother Julie passed away from cancer last year.</p>
<p>Rob, Perri and Jane - we offer our deepest condolences for your loss.</p>
<p>But Julie was very clear about her wish to be an organ donor and had discussed it with her family.</p>
<p>Julie donated both corneas enabling two people to have the gift of sight.</p>
<p>I'm sure, like the Wallis family, that the recipients of Julie's corneas thanked her.</p>
<p>And thank her every day they wake up and open their eyes and see the world around them.</p>
<p>It is people like Liz, Lachy and the Kennetts who have inspired the Government's $151.1 million Organ Donation Reform Package.</p>
<p>This national reform program is spearheaded by the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority and is gaining momentum in communities around the country.</p>
<p>Today, I am pleased to launch the cornerstone of our reform agenda - The DonateLife Network.</p>
<p>This is a newly formed national network of organ and tissue donation agencies and specialist clinical staff.</p>
<p>The 300-strong team behind the DonateLife Network includes 91 new hospital-based medical directors and senior nursing staff in 75 hospitals around Australia.</p>
<p>And DonateLife Agency staff are in every state and territory.</p>
<p>The DonateLife Network is central to our efforts to increase Australia's rate of organ donation for transplantation.</p>
<p>But improving our donation rate doesn't fall on the shoulders of these dedicated medical professionals alone.</p>
<p>We all have to do our part.</p>
<p>Although 90 per cent of Australians support organ donation, the family consent rate is just 56 per cent.</p>
<p>Forty per cent of Australians don't realise that their family makes the final decision regarding organ donation.</p>
<p>We can increase the family consent rates by ensuring that our family knows our wishes and that we know theirs.</p>
<p>Talking is the key.</p>
<p>This is why we are gathered here today.</p>
<p>Because it is in our homes that we can make a difference.</p>
<p>It is in our lounge rooms and at our dinner tables that we can start the conversations that may end in saving a life.</p>
<p>Memorable discussions that will allow us to confidently make the decision - should we ever be asked - to give consent for a loved one's organs and tissue to be donated.</p>
<p>Confidence that comes from knowing the wishes of our loved ones.</p>
<p>And there are three simple words that will help us gain that confidence.</p>
<p>Discover.</p>
<p>Decide.</p>
<p>And discuss.</p>
<p>Discover the facts about organ and tissue donation.</p>
<p>Make an informed choice and decide to become an organ donor.</p>
<p>Discuss with family and friends, so that you know each other's wishes.</p>
<p>Therese and the kids and I have had that chat as a family.</p>
<p>And today I can announce that we have decided to become a DonateLife Family.</p>
<p>As a DonateLife Family, we have committed to discussing and upholding each other's wishes.</p>
<p>And we want to invite every Australian to join us.</p>
<p>Deciding to become an organ donor is not a decision to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>That is why I encourage all Australians to discover the facts on the new DonateLife website.</p>
<p>At donatelife.gov.au, family and friends can find a range of materials, including a DonateLife Family pledge.</p>
<p>A simple tool that you can use to keep a record of each other's wishes.</p>
<p>The website also has Australian donor and recipient family stories, including those of the Kennett and Wallis families.</p>
<p>Their stories will encourage and inspire.</p>
<p>Australia is blessed to have highly skilled medical professionals.</p>
<p>We have a world class reputation for successful transplant outcomes.</p>
<p>Our surgeons know how precious donated organs are.</p>
<p>Anyone who has received a new organ knows how precious they are.</p>
<p>When you become a donor you don't just donate a kidney or a heart or a liver.</p>
<p>You donate a gift.</p>
<p>A second chance.</p>
<p>You donate life.</p>
