FOR PRESS 23 JULY 1978<br />
The Commonwealth has approved employment training for a second<br />
group of 500 eligible young people under the Special Youth<br />
Employment Training Programme in New South Wales State<br />
Government Departments and Authorities.<br />
The Commonwealth has already provided SYETP assistance for an<br />
initial intake of 500 young people under a similar arrangement<br />
in January 1978.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Commonwealth was pleased that the<br />
New South Wales State Government had joined the Commonwealth in<br />
a co-operative effort to assist young people.<br />
While there has not been an opportunity to fully evaluate the<br />
results of the first intake, Mr Wran had already indicated the<br />
trainees had shown a marked improvement. It was to be hopebd<br />
that this improvement would enable many of the trainees to<br />
find employment.<br />
The Prime Minister said that in advising Mr Wran Of the<br />
approval for additional training, he had expressed a desire<br />
for continued co-operation between the two governments in<br />
taking advantage of the programme.<br />
This would contribute further to the effectiveness of the<br />
programme which together with other major Commonwealth initiatives<br />
such as CRAFT, NEAT and CYSS, offered substantial assistance<br />
to young people in finding worthwhile employment. </p>
