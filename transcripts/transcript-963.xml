STATEMNT BY THE FRINE MINISTER AT MASCOT<br />
AIRPORT ON ARRIVAL HOME AFTER RIME MINISTERS1<br />
CONFERENCE IN LONDON 18TH JULY. 1961+<br />
Q. Good morning, Sir. You are looking very well, if I may<br />
may so, Sir.<br />
A. Oh, I'm not too bad for an old man. Tomorrow, of course,<br />
tomorrow afternoon I will have a Press Conference<br />
and TV interview ai Canberra. I will have had a day<br />
in bed and recruited my mental energy. All I want to<br />
say this morning is that I think that this conferenee<br />
was a great succes and I suppose for some people<br />
a surprising success. There were no bitter dispUes,<br />
There were arguents, of course. That'sa what we are<br />
for. But the communique that ultimately came out<br />
represented a remarkable degree of agreed opinion.<br />
From my point of view the matters that I<br />
will try to say something aboua in more detail tomorrow<br />
are first of all the references to Malazia, a problem<br />
to which I. myself, devoted a very great deal of time<br />
in this conference. Second the statements made<br />
about Southern Rhodesia whicA I think may need some<br />
clarification. I don't know. I haven't read the<br />
papers here, of course. I don't know what has come<br />
out of one or two clarifying statements that I tried<br />
to make in London. And in the third place, I will<br />
take the opportunity tomorrow of saying something<br />
about what I believe to be the effect on the future<br />
of the Com onwealth of this meeting. On each of<br />
these things, I think that good things can be said<br />
and I myself came away from this conference with a<br />
degree of satisfaction in the result that, quite<br />
frankly, I didn't expect to have when I arrived<br />
there.<br />
Q. How did you find President Johnson, Sir?<br />
A. He is a very interesting chap.<br />
Q. Did he promise any further<br />
A. Now, wait a minute. I thought it was arranged this<br />
is not a press interview. I'm not answering questions.<br />
I will tell you about him tomorrow, if you want to<br />
know. Thank you very much, Sir. </p>
