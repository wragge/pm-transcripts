    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Victorian Government will be the first state to join the Commonwealth Governmentâs Joint Police Taskforce into Industrial Criminality and Corruption.</p>
<p>The Joint Police Taskforce will investigate evidence of criminal conduct uncovered by the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption and will be supporting the continuing work of the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission has received significant evidence of criminal conduct which includes widespread instances of physical and verbal violence, cartel conduct, secondary boycotts, contempt of court and other institutional orders.</p>
<p>There is no place for standover tactics, violence or intimidation in Australian workplaces.</p>
<p>To generate jobs and grow businesses, workplaces must be safe, productive and law-abiding.</p>
<p>The Joint Taskforce will initially consist of officers of the Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police and will be expanded to additional jurisdictions following the completion of relevant agreements.</p>
<p>The evidence of corrupt behaviour, unlawful kickbacks and standover tactics in the construction industry has made it clear that there is a need for a Joint Police Taskforce to fully investigate this criminal activity.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will have all powers available to it that are currently available to the AFP and participating state police officers.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will be funded by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>31 October 2014</p>
