PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 18 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
WEEKEND OF NATIONAL PRAYER AND MOURNING<br />
The tragic loss of life and destruction of homes and<br />
possessions caused by the bush fires in South Australia and<br />
Victoria is one of the greatest disabtuzt in our history.<br />
I know all Australians extend their deepest sympathy to the<br />
relatives and friends of those who lost their lives and to<br />
those who have lost their livelihoods.<br />
I know all Australians will also join me in expressing their<br />
gratitude to the thousands of firefighters who are fighting<br />
the fires with determination and bravery and without whom<br />
the devastation would have been very much worse. The work<br />
of voluntary workers in providing relief from immediate<br />
hardship has also been wonderful and deserves our greatest<br />
thanks.<br />
B Qbu uC Lhiz Lra-yedy I call on all roligious loadarr to<br />
declare this weekend a time uE iaLional prayer and mourning<br />
for those who have suffered as a consequence of the fires.<br />
