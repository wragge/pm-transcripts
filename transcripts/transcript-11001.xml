<p>E&amp;OE..............................................................................................</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Good morning John. One of the things on your plate, as I said first</p>
<p> of all, the Warren Entsch affair as it's now being called. The</p>
<p> Labor Party say they'll go if necessary to the High Court to</p>
<p> challenge Mr Entsch's position in Parliament.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they can if they want to. But they'll have to pay for it.</p>
<p> Yesterday's move in Parliament by the Labor Party was all about</p>
<p> getting the public, the taxpayer, to pay for the High Court's</p>
<p> determination. Now we say that on the basis of our advice, the Solicitor</p>
<p> General, the acting Solicitor General, there's no Constitutional</p>
<p> problem with Mr Entsch. The Labor Party's got an opinion that</p>
<p> says otherwise. So if the Labor Party challenges that it can go to</p>
<p> the court. We're not stopping it going into the court. It's</p>
<p> quite open for the Labor Party to take the matter to court. And it</p>
<p> will be interesting to see whether it does. I mean it has talked about</p>
<p> challenging it, well that's fine. It can challenge it but it</p>
<p> can challenge it at its own expense. This is not an issue of high</p>
<p> principle. This is about the Labor Party trying to score a political</p>
<p> advantage over the Government. Now okay, it's entitled to play</p>
<p> that game, but it's got to pay for the game. You can't expect</p>
<p> taxpayers to pick up the bill. This is the real significance of the</p>
<p> move yesterday because if the Parliament has referred the issue to</p>
<p> the court then the public would have paid the cost of the court case.</p>
<p> But if the Labor Party takes the matter to court the Labor Party's</p>
<p> got to carry its own expense and run the risk of having costs awarded</p>
<p> against it. Just like any other litigant. It really wanted a legal</p>
<p> meal ticket out of the Parliament yesterday and because it's</p>
<p> been denied it, it's running around saying democracy's at</p>
<p> risk. Democracy is not at risk. The court will still decide the law</p>
<p> if the matter comes before the court.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>If Mr Entsch is going to go, if he's vulnerable to a challenge,</p>
<p> wouldn't it better for you to be seen to be doing the decisive</p>
<p> thing and making the decision yourself about his future rather than</p>
<p> the court having to do it for you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the advice we have is that he's not vulnerable.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>At all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. We have an opinion from the acting Solicitor General, Henry Burmeister</p>
<p> QC, a man who worked for Labor governments. So he's not a Liberal</p>
<p> lawyer. He's not somebody from the bar in Melbourne or Sydney</p>
<p> who's a member of the Liberal Party. Or in the case of the Labor</p>
<p> Party they can find some Labor lawyers. But the reality is that his</p>
<p> independent mind has advised the Keating Government, the Hawke Government,</p>
<p> and advised the Howard Government. And he said on the basis of the</p>
<p> established case law, the case law that's there, the man's</p>
<p> not vulnerable. Now I'm not going to look beyond that. I mean</p>
<p> I've got more important things to do like trying to get a decent</p>
<p> deal for our lamb exporters, and getting the tax package implemented.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>If the ministerial code of conduct is all about appearances, and saying</p>
<p> to the public look we've cleaned up the way the Parliament works.</p>
<p> Well surely here is an opportunity for you to show that it's</p>
<p> got some meaning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, the ministerial code was not about cleaning things up. The ministerial</p>
<p> code is meant as a guide for people's behaviour. It's not</p>
<p> meant as a death sentence. There's nothing in the code that says</p>
<p> that if anybody is in any kind of breach, technical or otherwise,</p>
<p> they must automatically be sacked. What happened here was that Warren</p>
<p> Entsch declared his financial interest in some companies, but he neglected</p>
<p> to declare his post as a director and secretary. Now if he had not</p>
<p> said anything about those companies then he would have been in trouble.</p>
<p> But the fact that he declared his financial interest but neglected</p>
<p> to declare his position is not in my view a hanging offence. Now people</p>
<p> will criticise me for that as they have. But that's the decision</p>
<p> I've taken. I think it is ludicrous if we get to a stage where</p>
<p> people are automatically knocked out on that basis because he hasn't</p>
<p> benefited from this mistake. He didn't know about the contract</p>
<p> until after it had been let. There's no evidence that he tried</p>
<p> to nobble the RAAF. There's no evidence that he used his position,</p>
<p> there's no evidence that he's done anything dishonest. He</p>
<p> made a mistake by not, as well as declaring his financial interest,</p>
<p> declaring his formal positions. Now I don't regard that as a</p>
<p> hanging offence.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But it's a running sore politically....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, Prime Ministers have running sores and arguments and political</p>
<p> criticisms every day of their life. But I've got to take a decision.</p>
<p> I try to play commonsense judgements. I've got a set of guidelines</p>
<p> that require people to do certain things. If they breach those guidelines,</p>
<p> and there's clear evidence of gross neglect, or malevolence,</p>
<p> or dishonest or unethical behaviour, well, people are out. But in</p>
<p> this case there's no evidence of that and the clincher is that</p>
<p> the man disclosed his financial interest in the companies. And the</p>
<p> thing that really matters, if you own a company, is how many shares</p>
<p> you've got in it not whether you're a director. Because</p>
<p> that determines the real level of your interest. But in this case</p>
<p> Warren declared his financial state but neglected to declare his formal</p>
<p> position as a director. It was a mistake. He shouldn't have done</p>
<p> that but I don't regard that as a hanging offence.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And if it was the other way around, if he declared a directorship</p>
<p> but hadn't told anyone there was financial benefit....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that would have actually been worse in my view because the real</p>
<p> thing that matters is the dough you get out of it and he told all</p>
<p> the world that he owned shares in this company. And interestingly</p>
<p> you go to the other part of the form, there was a couple of companies</p>
<p> where he was a director and not a shareholder, and he filled that</p>
<p> out. He honestly believed, I have a feeling people may think it is</p>
<p> that by declaring his financial interest that was enough but the world</p>
<p> knew that he half-owned the company. Because people who have private</p>
<p> companies they talk about ownership rather than shareholdings. This</p>
<p> particular company that got the contract is half-owned by Warren Entsch,</p>
<p> or half the shares are owned by him and half by another bloke. Now</p>
<p> he talks about half-ownership. He doesn't think in terms, and</p>
<p> most people don't think in terms of directorships and secretaryships.</p>
<p> That's language that's more akin to large public companies.</p>
<p> This bloke has not in my view done anything dishonest. I'm wearing</p>
<p> the flack, and I intend to go on doing so because I think it is stupid</p>
<p> to apply an ultra legalistic approach to these guidelines. They were</p>
<p> never intended to operate that way.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>A bit of commonsense applied.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Commonsense.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, listening to Parliament the other day, before we move</p>
<p> onto other things, listening to Parliament the other day there was</p>
<p> almost a veiled threat from you that if the Labor Party were going</p>
<p> to go this way then there was a lot of other baggage, a lot of other</p>
<p> dirt that could come out about the outside business activities, and</p>
<p> consultancies....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not dirt...no no. There was no threat. I don't issue threats.</p>
<p> I mean I don't believe that people should be thrown out of positions</p>
<p> on the basis of a technical noncompliance. I think that is ludicrous</p>
<p> because everybody could make that kind of mistake and Mr Beazley acknowledged</p>
<p> that himself a couple of years ago. And as Tony Abbott pointed out</p>
<p> yesterday there are a number of people in the Labor Party backbench</p>
<p> who've apparently have sort of, have got technical glitches in</p>
<p> their disclosure. Now we're not saying they should be punished</p>
<p> or thrown out or anything. I'm not suggesting that they've</p>
<p> done anything wrong, but backing the point that I was making that</p>
<p> once you go down this ultra-legalistic path you're going to basically</p>
<p> frighten a lot of people away from going into Parliament. And the</p>
<p> reality is that we have a lot of people in the Liberal Party who've</p>
<p> had a small business background. They get promoted to a parliamentary</p>
<p> secretaryship in the case of Warren Entsch. Now it's not...doesn't</p>
<p> carry the same status and so forth as a minister. It's a very</p>
<p> heavy burden to say to somebody like that, well you've got to</p>
<p> get rid of all of your financial interests, which essentially is where</p>
<p> the Labor Party is really in reality heading. Now I look at the substance</p>
<p> and I ask myself, okay, he made a mistake. He was careless, he shouldn't</p>
<p> have made that mistake. But there was no intent to defraud or camouflage</p>
<p> because if there had have been he wouldn't have disclosed his</p>
<p> financial interest in the company and that to me was the clincher.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>All right, we've got to cover a lot of other ground. According</p>
<p> to a report in today's Australian Financial Review there's</p>
<p> a spectre of a High Court challenge to the GST. The government solicitor</p>
<p> has said there is a question mark over whether or not under the Constitution</p>
<p> you can pass all of those tax laws through one bill at once.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I read that report. I haven't seen the legal opinion. But it</p>
<p> sounds to me very much like every legal opinion I've ever read,</p>
<p> and that is they say well our view is X, Y, Z, but of course it's</p>
<p> always possible that somebody could take another view. And from what</p>
<p> I see of the report that's basically it. All legal opinions are</p>
<p> like that. I don't think I've ever read a legal opinion</p>
<p> in my life which says that something is totally and utterly free from</p>
<p> doubt....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Never black and white.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well never, no. And that is the nature of the law. But on balance,</p>
<p> it was quite strong and about as strong as you can ever get.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Are you concerned about the ...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no, no I'm not.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>All right. The Premier, you may be concerned about this, the Premier</p>
<p> Jeff Kennett yesterday in an interview said that he thought it was</p>
<p> unacceptable to have a new GST package in effect rammed down his throat.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well nothing's being rammed down Mr Kennett's throat. In</p>
<p> the end it was our call to do a deal with the Australian Democrats</p>
<p> to get the package up, and it was quite unrealistic given the dynamics</p>
<p> of our negotiations with the Australian Democrats, it was quite unrealistic</p>
<p> of us to say to the Democrats: well we want you to agree to something,</p>
<p> and we've reached tentative agreement, but can we break off for</p>
<p> a week or ten days while I toddle off and sign up each of the State</p>
<p> premiers and chief ministers.</p>
<p>Now that was just unrealistic. What I have done is conclude a deal</p>
<p> which preserves real gains for the States. It guarantees that the</p>
<p> States will be no worse off during the transitional period. It guarantees</p>
<p> that after the transitional period the revenue gains to the States</p>
<p> will be such that they will be much better off than if the existing</p>
<p> arrangement continues. Given that we are paying the entire cost of</p>
<p> the changes out of our budget, and not out of the State budget, the</p>
<p> States have received an extremely good deal. But it seems that the</p>
<p> real rub with some of the Premiers is that in some way there weren't</p>
<p> detailed discussions with them before I signed up with the Democrats.</p>
<p> Well Mr Kennett knows, as well as every other State premier, that</p>
<p> in a situation like that, in the dynamics of such a negotiation it</p>
<p> was unrealistic of me to say: well you're not really negotiating</p>
<p> with Howard and Costello. You're negotiating with us but you're</p>
<p> also negotiating with Kennett, and Court and Carr, and Beattie and</p>
<p> so forth. Now that's just unrealistic and Jeff knows that. We</p>
<p> have got a very good deal. We're going to have a much better</p>
<p> tax system.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Why do you think he's holding out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well premiers always do that. Always. You should ask him that. I don't</p>
<p> accept the criticism. We're don't intend to, in any way,</p>
<p> renegotiate the arrangement with the Democrats. And as that very good</p>
<p> lift-out supplement in the Melbourne Age demonstrated this</p>
<p> morning this is an influently better system than the present taxation</p>
<p> system. Families in particular will get huge benefits out of it. I</p>
<p> thought it was an excellent supplement and full marks to the Melbourne</p>
<p> Age and I hope every Melbournian reads it because it really</p>
<p> is an excellent lift-out supplement, and it demonstrates very clearly</p>
<p> the family benefits out of this tax package. And that is exactly what</p>
<p> I set out to do two-and-a-half years ago...two years ago, to deliver</p>
<p> a tax package with great benefits for Australian families at the low</p>
<p> and middle income range. You look at that supplement this morning,</p>
<p> it's been done by Access Economics not by the Federal Treasury,</p>
<p> it's very clear that there are very big gains for people in the</p>
<p> middle with families, particularly single-income families whose relative</p>
<p> position has deteriorated and that was demonstrated in a survey that</p>
<p> came out about a week ago, over the last 14, 15 years. And what was</p>
<p> so pleasing about that analysis was that it concluded that the very</p>
<p> goal we set out to achieve has in fact been delivered through this</p>
<p> taxation package.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But at the same time as that coming out, you hear from the St Vincent</p>
<p> de Paul Society that there are 2 million Australians living in poverty,</p>
<p> and BRW at exactly the same time that the hundred richest families</p>
<p> in Australia have gone about 25% richer over the last year. So the</p>
<p> gap between the rich and the poor seems to be getting wider.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, I think the truth is that the well-off in Australia are getting</p>
<p> better off, that's true. There is a lot of evidence though to</p>
<p> say that through a combination of policies over the last 10 or 15</p>
<p> or more years, there have been real gains for people at the lower</p>
<p> end of the income range. There are surveys indicating that there are</p>
<p> fewer people, young people, children living below defined poverty</p>
<p> levels. We don't accept, and I don't think Access Economics</p>
<p> accepts either, but it's a matter for them to speak for themselves,</p>
<p> that the St Vincent de Paul conclusion is a true reflection of the</p>
<p> position. You see the problem with those sorts of analyses is John</p>
<p> is that they look at somebody's income irrespective of their</p>
<p> family circumstances. Now if you say that somebody on an income of</p>
<p> $100 a week is obviously struggling, but if that happens to be a 17</p>
<p> or 18 year old student with a part-time job living at home with his</p>
<p> parents who are in quite comfortable circumstances, you can hardly</p>
<p> say that person's poor. Yet the statistics throw that person</p>
<p> up as earning only $100 a week. And that is the difficulty of so many</p>
<p> of these analyses.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But the poor are doing it tough at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The poor in any....yes, but they are doing it better now than they</p>
<p> were a few years ago because prices are not going up as quickly, and</p>
<p> the value of social security benefits have been fully maintained.</p>
<p> And under the GST package, in particularly as a result of the arrangement</p>
<p> with the Democrats, pensioners are going to get a real increase of</p>
<p> 2%. And one of the things that the Labor Party will do if votes against</p>
<p> this package will be to vote against a 2% increase in the value of</p>
<p> the pension. Now this is over and above the compensation needed for</p>
<p> the GST. It's one thing to vote down the compensation to the</p>
<p> GST because you say you're simultaneously voting down the GST</p>
<p> therefore you don't need the compensation. But in addition they'll</p>
<p> be voting down 2% over and above that.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>An international story, the major thing happening of course, the peace</p>
<p> deal in Kosovo. Are you confident it will stick, and are you disappointed</p>
<p> that some sort of a deal over the Australian care workers was not</p>
<p> included?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as to my confidence that it will stick, when I spoke to President</p>
<p> Clinton yesterday morning about our lamb exports, and about our two</p>
<p> aid workers, he expressed a lot of optimism. He said that he thought</p>
<p> this was the real thing and he sounded very upbeat and deservedly</p>
<p> so because it's a huge breakthrough. I can only rely on the reports</p>
<p> I've seen, I can only rely on the tone of that conversation with</p>
<p> the President. And it was very clear from that conversation that he</p>
<p> was very upbeat and the reports seem a lot more reliable. The language</p>
<p> of the Yugoslav President, the fact that the Serbian troops have begun</p>
<p> to pull out. As much as you can do with these things I'm hopeful.</p>
<p> I didn't expect, you know, an immediate breakthrough on the aid</p>
<p> workers yesterday, but clearly, as a result of the peace deal their</p>
<p> prospects are a lot better because in a sense there retention's</p>
<p> a product of the conflict. Now that the conflict looks as though it's</p>
<p> been resolved, then the prospects of them getting out will increase.</p>
<p> But I did raise their position with the President. I've also</p>
<p> written separately to them about it. I've written to the British</p>
<p> Prime Minister and we will continue to lift every effort we can to</p>
<p> try and get them out.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And on the lamb exports, did President Clinton hint that there was</p>
<p> any joy for Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's certainly well aware of how upset we are about the</p>
<p> prospect of them applying quotas. I said that it would really deeply</p>
<p> disappoint the Australian community. It would anger out exporters.</p>
<p> We have arguments in the past that this is qualitatively different</p>
<p> because here is a problem in the American industry, not caused by</p>
<p> our exports, but rather caused by their bad marketing. We'd actually</p>
<p> offered money to help them improve their marketing techniques. And</p>
<p> you've got a group of people as you heard from that segment on</p>
<p> AM a few moments ago, people whose very livelihood in rural</p>
<p> areas of Australia depend on this. And I mean what is so vividly disappointing</p>
<p> for them is that they've worked their guts out to build up a</p>
<p> market and they've done it through efficiency, and now it's</p>
<p> going to be taken away from them by the executive act potentially</p>
<p> of a country that preaches free trade. The point I made to the President</p>
<p> was that if they go ahead and do this it will send a terrible signal</p>
<p> to those countries who don't want to open up agricultural trade.</p>
<p> The Americans say they do, we certainly do.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Did you indicate to President Clinton that there would be retaliatory</p>
<p> measures?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I didn't. I think it's silly in a situation like that</p>
<p> to start talking wildly about retaliation. I mean that is the language</p>
<p> in a sense of defeat because you are already assuming that your arguments</p>
<p> aren't going to carry any weight. You're preparing for what</p>
<p> happens afterwards. I mean if the Americans go ahead and impose restrictions</p>
<p> then we will have to consider where we go from there. But I was intent</p>
<p> yesterday to make the point to him that it will do immense damage</p>
<p> to the trade relationship between the two countries, but it would</p>
<p> also send a terrible signal to the rest of the world. And the Americans</p>
<p> have talked free trade now for years, and if they go ahead and do</p>
<p> this it would be one of the most blatantly protectionist acts imaginable</p>
<p> and it will send a terrible signal. Now in the end of course, when</p>
<p> you talk about retaliation, it's very stupid in trade to cut</p>
<p> off your nose to spite your face, and you've got to be very careful</p>
<p> about issuing bland general threats about retaliation. Because in</p>
<p> the long run Australia's interests lie in expanding world trade</p>
<p> because we are $19 million people. We need exports to grow and to</p>
<p> prosper. Therefore it is not in our interests to see the world throwing</p>
<p> up protectionist barriers.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Not at all. Still on international events, are you concerned by the</p>
<p> slowness of the count in the Indonesian poll, concerned is being expressed</p>
<p> about vote rigging, to put it bluntly?</p>
