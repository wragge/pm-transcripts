JOHN CURTIN).<br />No. 8.<br />PERIOD-2nTu NOVEMBER, 1941, To 27TH NOVEMBER, 1941.<br />By Atbcwribt:<br />L F. Joamm. Cnamonwc Comvrnnt PrinM. Cibm.<br />( Printed in Ajstli&amp;)</p>
<p>BANNING OF BOOKS.<br />ARMY MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br />In Parliament.-On 20th November, 1941, the Minister for the<br />Army ( Mr. Forde) said-<br />" The questions which have been directed at the Army Censorship<br />recently fall into three sections. The first concerns the list of publications<br />which are on the banned list prepared for the Army; the second<br />the alleged impounding of books being imported as cargo; and the<br />third whether Major Cameron, is associated in his military<br />capacity' with the banning of literature.<br />At the moment 171 publications, including books, magazines,<br />newspapers, pamphlets and cyclo-styled circulars, are on the Army<br />banned list on the ground that they are subversive. Of these, 83 come<br />under the broad description of Leftist"; 16 have a distinct Nazi<br />flavour and the remainder consist of certain Japanese periodicals and'<br />material which is militantly pacifist or anti-British. Of the 171<br />publications, 64 are published in England, 57 in the United States of<br />America, 16 in Japan, 9 in Russia, 4 in Australia, 3 in Manchuria,<br />3 in Mexico, 2 in each of France, China, Brazil, Ireland and Sweden<br />and 1 in each of New Zealand, Argentine, Finland, Switzerland and<br />India; 49 are printed in foreign languages and the rest in English.<br />Included in the list of banned " Leftist" publications are the Russian<br />newspapers Pravda and Izvestia, as well as a number of the works<br />of Ienin and others. I have ordered a review of the 171 publications<br />with a view to seeing if any of them can safely be released for<br />circulation without ' any risk to national security. Recently two<br />publications were removed from this list because it was found that<br />they did not contain any subversive or objectionable propaganda.<br />They were the Moscow News, a weekly newspaper published in English<br />in Moscow, and the Left News, a periodical published by the firm of<br />Gollancz, London.<br />" The Army is responsible for the censorship of matter passing<br />through postal and telegraphic channels. At present if any of the<br />publications on the Army's banned list are intercepted in the post they<br />are stopped. The procedure which was adopted in compiling the list<br />of banned publications was as follows: Publications intercepted in<br />the mail by postal and telegraphic censorship authorities, and suspected<br />of being subversive or detrimental to the efficient prosecution of the<br />war, were submitted to the Department of Information, which is the<br />press and publicity censorship authority. That department decided<br />whether or not a publication contravened the provisions of National<br />Security ( General) Regulation 17. If that department decided that a<br />publication did contravene the regulation, it was placed by the<br />Controller of Postal and Telegraphic Censorship on the banned list<br />and was stopped by the censors. The procedure for removing a<br />publication from the list is that if, in the course of examining materials,<br />a District Censor thinks that the tone of a listed publication has<br />changed, it is submitted by the Controller of Postal and Telegraphic</p>
<p>Censorship to the Department of Information. If that Department<br />finds that the publication is not subversive it is removed from the list.<br />The next question is the impounding of literature after the<br />importation and before sale or distribution. I am informed by<br />Military Intelligence authorities that they go no further than the<br />censorship action I have just detailed. The power to impound<br />" Leftist" literature exists in National Security ( General) Regulation<br />17, which provides that a Minister may, by order in the Gazette,<br />declare printed matter to be a prohibited paper. The printed matter<br />then becomes automatically banned and forfeited. Under National<br />Security ( Subversive Associations) Regulations, the Attorney-General<br />has certain powers in regard to the property of associations which are<br />declared to be subversive, but these do not appear to be relevant here<br />except where they relate to the impounding of the literature of those<br />organizations which have already been declared subversive.<br />' Complaints have been made that the Customs Department referred<br />doubtful publications to the Army which the Army banned without<br />explanation and that the Army refused to inform booksellers whether<br />or why the ban had been imposed. I am informed that the Army<br />in theal matters acts on the advice of the Department of Information.<br />Apart altogether from Army Censorship, the Customs Department has<br />power under their Prohibited Imports Regulations to stop certain types<br />of Communist literature.<br />In regard to the statements which have been made that the<br />Military Intelligence organization in Southern Command, of which<br />Major Cameron, is a member, has taken action to impound or<br />suppress literature other than that which is included in the banned<br />list, I am in a position to state definitely that Southern Command has<br />not at any time since the outbreak of the war, either within or outside<br />the scope of their powers, impounded any literature, imported or<br />otherwise, either on their own initiative or at the request of some other<br />authority, or in any other circumstances. Southern Command has<br />not been concerned in any way in association with the Criminal<br />Investigation Branch or with the police in the impounding of<br />literature. It is true that Major Cameron, in his military<br />capacity, was connected with Intelligence Censorship in name for<br />about a month, but his actual work was not very great. There are no<br />instances in which he was concerned with the banning of literature in<br />his military capacity."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 9.)<br />MR. A. CAMERON, M. H. R.<br />On 21st November, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />" I can see no justification for appointing a court of inquiry to<br />investigate the allegations made against Mr. Cameron, by a<br />section of the press. My investigation into the whole question of the<br />banning of books -showed that there were no instances in which<br />Major Cameron was concerned with the banning of literature in his<br />military capacity."</p>
<p>RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS.<br />On 21st November, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />" In view of our changed relationship with Russia I now cannot<br />see any justification for banning the two important Russian newspapers<br />Pravda and Izvestia. They are quoted every day in the cables, which<br />proves they contain no subversive propaganda against the best interests<br />of the Allies, either in their leading articles or propaganda columns,<br />and that Russia has everything in common with the British Empire<br />in this struggle." CENSORSHIP CONTROL.<br />In Parliament.-On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Trade.<br />and Customs ( Senator Keane) said-<br />" Recently I had occasion to intervene with regard to a large<br />consignment of books from overseas that had been delivered in<br />Melbourne and had been held up since last March. Although-the:<br />books number about 600, only one of them was opei to challenge.<br />Despite that fact, all books had been held under the. direction of some<br />Army authority, but, on the position being explained, the: books were<br />released. The main point is that there is dual control. " I have asked<br />the Army authorities to communicate to me their views. as to whether<br />the power of censorship, from the point of view of subversive activities;<br />should not reside in one authority. When I receive from the Minister'<br />for the Army a reply to my recent request for a full statement on the<br />matter, I shall answer at greater length."<br />On 26th November, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />The matter of censorship control is one that will be discussed by.<br />me at the first opportunity with the Minister for Trade and Customs<br />( Senator Keane) and the Minister for Information (' Senator Ashley).<br />There is a desire that there should be a centralized control of:<br />censorship." PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.;<br />SAGR[ CULTURAL COUNCIL MEETING.'<br />On 20th November, 1941, at a meeting of the Australian Agricultural<br />-Council at Canberra, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Scully).<br />. said-" I thank the various State Ministers for attending this meeting<br />and welcome them to the deliberations of the first meeting over which<br />it is my privilege to preside. I am fully conscious of the very difficult<br />task which confronts the Government, and particularly the Minister<br />a. isisting the Minister for Commerce ( Senator Fraser) and myself in::<br />guiding marketing policy through the problems which war brings I<br />have had considerable personal experience of agricultural . industries.:<br />I face the task as a man acutely aware of the primary producers'<br />problems. In this war shipping has suffered greatly, and the British<br />7780.-2</p>
<p>Governent finds it necessary to make changes in the disposition of<br />shipping at short notice. Supplying countries have to cope with<br />baffling problems and adjust their policy to variations in market<br />demands which cannot be foreseen.<br />" The new Government conmes to office with its own distinctive<br />policy in regard to agriculture. It has its own ideas in regard tothe<br />method of improving the general economic position of<br />the farmers; and<br />methods of control of marketing.<br />The Government believes that the financial position of farmers can<br />be improved by a better system of long-term finance. The farmer<br />should be able to secure, at reasonable rates of interest, financial<br />. At~ imodation over a long term of years in respect of the proper<br />capital vaoue of his farm. The present Government believes this can;<br />be made good by a properly constituted Mortgage Bank. To enable<br />the Mortgage Bank to function with benefit to the farmer and to<br />improve his general cconomic status, the Government is studying all<br />possible measures which may be summed up under the general title<br />of rural reconstruction. As the Minister for Commerce I Will do<br />everything t~ o improve the farmer's income; to enhance the importance<br />of rural life; to reverse the present tendencies towards rural depopulation,<br />and to establish the foundations of a greater rural prosperity. The<br />individual farmer must be protected against too heavy a load of debt.<br />TPhis protcction must come from control of land values and from<br />control of his general debt structure, with guidance to him as to the<br />capacity of his property to bear the load of indebtedness. Too great R<br />share of the income fronm the* farmn goes to the creditor.<br />" The rural community requires national effort to provide in the<br />country the amenities which are commonplace in the cities. This joint<br />effort at improvement of the individual farmer's position and the<br />provision of amenities for rural districts will comprise the subject<br />matter of rural reconstrucetion. Details of this policy will be dealt<br />with from time to time. I hope to have the States' co-operation to<br />improve the status of agriculture.<br />Regarding control of marketing, Ministers will have observed that<br />it. is to he the Government's policy to afford to growers a more complete<br />control over the marketing of their products. Efficient marketing of<br />any commodity requires specialized knowledge, but specialized knowledge<br />must be reinforced by an interest in the return to be secured.<br />It is, therefore, the Government's policy t~ o ensure adequate grower<br />representation on all marketing organizations. We hope to arrange<br />that efficient representatives of the growers shall attain a predominant<br />position on the marketing boards. This can be achieved without in<br />any wayv diminishing the technical e* fficiency of those or'Yani7ation<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 11.)</p>
<p>AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL DECISIONS.<br />On 21st November, 1941, the Agricultural Council decided several<br />matters. RURAL REHABILITATION.<br />It is desirable to continue debt adjustment for the time being and the<br />States urged that the Commonwealth continue to find funds for State plans.<br />The whole system of debt adjustment should be examined on a Commonwealthwide<br />basis with a view to bringing these plans into line with the Commonwealth<br />Government's plans for rural rehabilitation. The States accepted the Commonwealth<br />view that it is desirable to hasten the completion of plans for removing<br />wheat farmers from marginal areas.<br />INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.<br />Mr. Scully reported the nature of discussions in Washington between representatives<br />of the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada, Argentine<br />and Australia. Consultations on the progress . made in the discussions are<br />regarded as satisfactory by State Ministers who expressed their confidence that<br />the Commonwealth, if it decided to participate in an International Wheat<br />Agreement, would safeguard the best interests of Australia.<br />APPLES AND PEARS.<br />The Commonwealth has not yet considered the matter but will do so soon<br />and will then have the benefit of the views of the States.<br />SUPERPHOSPHATES.<br />Council adopted a method of rationing superphosphates which was submitted:<br />by the Department of Commerce. It is based on the use by each producer<br />of 65 per cent. of the quantity of superphosphates used in 1939-40.<br />POTATOES.<br />Council agreed that it was inadvisable to increase acreage or stimulate<br />production with the anticipated demands of the Supply Department. It was:<br />felt that the Supply Department should advise the State Departments of<br />Agriculture of its likely requirements and, having done this, should untilne<br />itself to operating on the market in a normal way.<br />MUNITIONS CONTRACTS.<br />REFUNDS TO GOWERNMENT.<br />On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin)<br />said that voluntary refunds aggregating at least Å 100,000 had been<br />made to the Government by two large Australian-wide organizations.<br />The refunds were from proceeds of war-time activities by these firms.<br />It was a healthy sign when big companies acted in such a way,<br />especially when, as far as he knew, the only reason for their action had<br />been that the right spirit had prompted them. He hoped that other<br />firms would follow the excellent example. Much of the money from<br />one firm had been made in the erection of a munitions annexe and he<br />wished to acknowledge publicly the company's patriotic gesture.<br />MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.<br />NITRIC ACID AND METHANOL.<br />On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin)<br />said he had approved of a recommendation which should make Au.-<br />tralia self-contained in respect of nitric acid and methanol, the requirements<br />of which at present amounted to Å 1,000,000 annually. This</p>
<p>would involve an expenditure of Å 2,500,000. Factories would be<br />erected at Ballarat and Maribyrnong ( Victoria), Villawood ( New<br />South Wales), and Salisbury ( South Australia). They would be<br />located on the sites of government explosives factories.<br />TANK MANUFACTURE.<br />On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army Forde)<br />said-" The conference on the production of tanks in Australia considered<br />the type of tank to be built and the whole question of the supply of<br />eugines for these tanks. Its object was to decide definitely the type<br />of tank to be built and the type of engine to be used."<br />[ Ministers who attended the conference were Mr. Forde, the<br />Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin) and the Minister for Air ( Mr.<br />Drakeford).] CHRISTMAS ARRANGEMENTS.<br />On 27th November, 1941, Mr. Makin said that State Boards of<br />Area Management would confer with workers' organizations as to what<br />days would be most suitable to ' constitute the Christmas holiday period.<br />The department was anxious that production should be maintained at.<br />the highest possible maximum but it was recognized that, after the<br />continuous and fatiguing hours which had been necessary to overcome<br />the shortage of technical skill, some break at Christmas was necessary.<br />The rest period for munition workers would allow for overhaul of and<br />repairs to machinery. ( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 23.).<br />CONTROL OF FORGINGS.<br />On 27th November, 1941, Mr. Makin said that in consequence of<br />the heavy demands on industry in respect of steel forgings, particularly<br />in respect of heavy forgings necessary for gun manufacture<br />and shipbuilding, it had been necessary to establish machinery within<br />the department to control production of forgings. An Assistant-<br />Controller of Forgings ( Mr. W. Noad) had -been appointed to the<br />Directorate of Materials Supply. It would be his business to ascertain<br />the requirements of steel forgings throughout the Commonwealth; the<br />forging capacity available and the full utilization of that capacity.<br />WOMEN'S WAR ORGANIZATIONS.<br />PATHOLOGY COURSE FOR WOMEN.<br />On M1st November. 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />sid-", Six women medical officers,: bearing the rank of captain, are at<br />present undergoing an intensive three months' course in the science of<br />pathology at the School of Tropical. Medicine. The course is especially<br />devised to give these women an intensive post-graduate experience of<br />the requirements of clinical pathology.. The object is to make them</p>
<p>proficient and competent to take charge of laboratories in Australia for<br />thorough investigation of the diseases to which an army is subject.<br />Their appointment would make it possible to release male doctors . f<br />the Australian Army Medical Corps for service' overseas."<br />AUSTRALIAN WOMEN~ S ARMY SERVICE.<br />On 22nd November, 1941, Mr. Forde announced the appointment . of<br />further officers to the Australian Women's Army Bervice-<br />Assistant Controller at Army Head.-quarters, Melbourne, Miss Jean<br />Wood; Tasmanian Commandant, Mrs. E. G. B. Scriven; Assistant<br />Commandants in Victoria, Misses Patricia Turner, E. F. Ratten, 1. V.<br />Murphy, M. Michelmore,. Dorothy May, and Mesdames E.<br />Jamieson and E. F. Parry;-Assistant ' Commandant, Western Command,<br />Miss J. Robertson. ( For earlier references, please see No. 5, page 18.)<br />WOMEN'S AUXILIARY AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE<br />RECRUITING.<br />On 26th November, 1941, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)<br />said-" There has been a gradual but modified intake of recruits for the<br />Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force in the last six weeks.<br />Authority has ' been given for two separate drafts to be enrolled,<br />approximately doubling the strength of the organization since the<br />change of Government. An impression seems to have grown up that<br />recruiting for the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force. has been<br />stopped. I am sure that this announcement will correct that impression.<br />The general principle of the future employment of women<br />in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and other defence<br />services will be considered by Cabinet with a review of man-power<br />problems, housing, uniforms and costs of such services."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 9.)<br />WEARING OF UNIFORMS.<br />On 28th November, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said--<br />" The following are the women's organizations within the Defence<br />Services for whom uniforms have been authorized-<br />Navy.-Women's Royal Australian Naval Service;<br />Army.-Australian Army Nursing Service, Australian Army<br />Women's Service, Voluntary Aid Detachments;<br />Air.-Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, Royal Ajistralian<br />Air Force Nursing Service.<br />Outside the Defence Services, the Red Cross Society, St. John'z,<br />Ambulance and Girl Guides have long been recognized as bodies<br />wearing uniforms.<br />" Numerous other outside women's organizations throughout the<br />Commonwealth at present wear uniforms. The recently gazetted<br />amendment to the National Security ( General) Regulations, relating<br />to the wearing of uniforms, is not designed to prohibit the wearing of</p>
<p>uniform by members of women's unofficial organizations created in<br />connexion with the war effort, if some type of uniform is desired by<br />them, provided that it is not ' similar to any uniform or emblem of the<br />Naval, Military or Air Forces of the Commonwealth, or of any other<br />part of the King's dominions, or of any women's auxiliary force,<br />detachment or service established by the ' Commonwealth ii connexion<br />with any of those Forces SPORT IN WAR-TIME.<br />PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br />On 21st November, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said:-<br />In my judgment, sport is not detrimental to the war effort. There<br />are thousands of the population who are engaged in the war effort, and<br />for whom the playing of games is a positive refreshment and a good<br />thing for their own physical welfare and for the morale of the country.<br />It is also a matter for great satisfaction that so many men who have<br />been prominent in sport have enlisted in the forces, and that others<br />who have not enlisted, but are engaged in the war effort, have intimated<br />that they are not available for a regular programme of games. I do not<br />see why attending football matches-which attract huge crowds-should<br />not be a positive benefit to people who work indoors all the week; many<br />on war jobs. I see more merit in such outdoor recreation than in<br />recreation indoors, provided, of course, that moderation and common<br />sense are observed.<br />" It would be a demonstration to the world of the spirit of the<br />British race if Australia and England resumed test matches immediately<br />~ fter the war. Our race does not live by bread alone. I think<br />that sport, such as cricket, is just as important to the British race<br />as the performance of Shakespeare. I think the two things go together<br />in making us what we are. The English lord and the London bus<br />driver both regard Hobbs as their common property. They watch the<br />weather with equal anxiety before a test match.<br />" Things of the spirit and grace, and courtesy, are not merely<br />valuable traits of our character. They are the things that distinguish<br />us from other races, and enrich our whole lives. Demands by some<br />sections that racing should be restricted will be discussed at a Premiers'<br />Conference in Canberra early in the new year. Ample powers for<br />control of racing are vested in the States and if there is to be any<br />regulation of racing the States should be the responsible authority to<br />take uniform action." AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.<br />INQUIRY INTO FINANOES.<br />On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Aircraft Production<br />( Senator Cameron) said that Mr. W. T. Harris, of the Sub-Treasury,<br />Melbourne, had been appointed full-time finance member of the Aircraft<br />Commission and had been asked to go thoroughly into the Commission<br />and make a report.</p>
<p>COTTON FABRIC FOR. AEROPLANE WINGS.<br />On 29th November, 1941, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)<br />said " An Australian-made cotton fabric, embodying improvements<br />designed to conform with the more rigid war-time requirements 9f<br />Royal Australian Air Force machines, is now being fitted to the wings<br />of trainer aircraft. A shortage of the imported prdduct vill resulf: in<br />an extension of the use of locally manufactured material. This represents<br />yet another step in Australia's policy of maximum self-sufficiency,"<br />WAR-TIME PROFITS TAX.<br />PROPOSED COMMITTEE.<br />In Parliament.-On 21st November, 1941, the Prime Minister<br />( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />" I give Mr. Holt, an assurance that the suggestion that a<br />Parliamentary Committee on war-time profits tax legislation be set up<br />will receive the most sympathetic consideration. I had hoped that: such<br />a committee would hav* e been established last year. Mr. Holt is no<br />doubt aware that representatives were actually named by the Opposition<br />to sit on such a committee. It was subsequently discovered, however,<br />that the activities of the proposed committee were to be restricted to<br />an examination of the sales tax measures of the Government. I had<br />hoped that it would be empowered to make a general review of the<br />Government's taxation arrangements."<br />WOOL AGREEMENT.<br />REVIEW NOT MADE.<br />In. Parliament.-On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for the<br />Interior, on behalf of the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Scully), said.-<br />" The Government finds that the understanding between the United<br />Kingdom and Australian Governments is that the price of wool may be<br />reviewed in May of each year. The Government has also ascertained<br />that the previous Government failed to initiate any such review. On<br />account of this failure it may not be possible to arrange any change<br />in the price until the 1942-3 clip. The Government at present has this<br />matter under consideration."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 8.)<br />ARMY INVENTIONS BOARD.<br />MINISTER TO REVIEW.<br />' On 22nd November, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />said he intended to review the present set-up of the Inventions<br />Boards and particularly the Army Head-quarters Inventions Section<br />with a view to ensuring a more expeditious consideration of submissions.<br />Six hundred inventions a week were submitted to the inventions<br />section of the Army. Only about ten had been accepted but a considerable<br />number, which showed great promise, were being investigated.<br />( For earlier references, please see No 2, page No 5, page 7.)</p>
<p>LEASE-LEND NEGOTIATIONS.<br />On 23rd November, 1941, the Prime Minister'( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />There is no substance in the suggestions made that there have<br />. been hitches in Lease-Lend negotiations between the United States<br />and Australia, caused by the change of Government in Australia. The<br />United States-Government ' has not asked the Commonwealth Government<br />to give guarantees not to expand or establish new industries in<br />Australia because of the benefits being derived by Australia under<br />Lease-Lend from the United States. The undertakings given by the<br />United Kingdom Government to the United States Government are<br />fully set out in the White Paper which was issued on 10th September.<br />1941. The decisions embodied in this White Paper were made by<br />President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill during the period when they<br />were drawing up the Atlantic Charter in August, 1941.<br />" Discussions are proceeding in the United States concerning sur-J<br />plus products, particularly on the effect of the supply of primary products<br />by the United ' States to the United Kingdom under Lease-Lend<br />on the marketing of Australian primary products in surplus production.<br />' The Government has not received any detailed reports on this subject<br />from its officers in the United States."<br />SHIPBUILDING.<br />MARINE ENGINES.<br />On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Navy ( Mr. Makin)<br />said that a marine engine factory to cost Å 700,000 would be built at<br />Fisherman's Bend ( Victoria). With the Minister for Health ( Mr.<br />Holloway) and the chairman of the Australian Shipbuilding Board<br />( Rear-admiral McNeil), he had inspected sites for the factory-<br />( For earier references, please see No. 5. page 22.)<br />SIR EARLE PAGE, M. P.<br />STATUS IN GREAT BRITAIN.<br />On 24th Novemiber, 1941, commenting on a question to be asked in<br />the Rouse of Lords by Lord Davies, concerning the status of Sir Earle<br />Page, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />" It is for Mr. Churchill and not for me to answer the questiona.<br />I know of no reason, however, why there should be any question<br />concerning the status of Sir Earle Page. Re has attended meetings of<br />teBritish War Cabinet; had consultations and discussions with<br />Ministers and has had regular contact with the Prime Minister. He<br />has met him separately and also in the War Cabinet. Sir Earle Page iFs<br />not a member of the British War Cabinet, but has attended meetings<br />of it. As I have said before, Sir Earle Page is an accredited representative<br />of the Australian Government to the British Government to<br />represent our views on war policy. The British Prime Minister said<br />he would be pleased to receive him. Communications I have received</p>
<p>from Sir Earle rage intim.* a ' te* that he, ' w' a* s received mst cordially and<br />that every facility was given to him to carry out his mission-which<br />was to state the Australian Government's views on war policy in<br />Great Britain. There is no occasion to define Sir Earle Page's<br />position. He is the representative of the Australian GoverlirnentA. and<br />not my personal representative. He was nominated by the preiious<br />Govern * ment to proceed to England and we authorized him to continue<br />his mission. He is the spokesman for the Australian Government.<br />Both Mr. Churchill and Sir Earle Page have expressed satisfaction<br />with the position and until either of them finds the present position<br />unsatisfactory, I do not propose taking any notice of Lord Davies."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 12.)<br />GENERAL SIR THOMAS BLAMEY.<br />RETURN TO MIDDLE EAST.<br />On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />said-" General Sir Thomas Blarney, General Officer Commanding the<br />Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East, will leave later this<br />week for the Middle East."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 3; No. 5, page<br />OWEN SUB-MACHINE GUN.<br />CONFERENCE ON PRODUCTION.<br />On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />said-" The conference to-day on the Owen gun was completely satisfactory,<br />and a number of points which were holding up production<br />were cleared up. I believe that the facto~ ry will be in full swing<br />producing the gun within a week or so. The first order is for 2,000<br />guns, but I have no doubt that further orders will be given. I am<br />satisfied that the gun is an efficient weapon and it is the Government's<br />aim to see that our men are given an adequate supply of modern<br />equipment at least equal to the best our enemies can produce. -The<br />question of paying royalty to Mr. Owen did not arise. It is a matter<br />on which the Government will give an equitable decision. Mr. Owen<br />is at present concentrating on getting the gun into production, and has<br />not worried about royalties."

The Regulations<br />implement certain recommendations of the Royal Commission on the<br />Monetary and Banking Systems and make other provisions to meet<br />the present conditions of war finance. Before finalizing the regulations<br />the Government had conferences with the representatives of the trading<br />hanks and the Commonwealth Bank.<br />It is generally agreed that the private banks play such an important<br />part in our financial system that control of their activities is<br />essential to an effective war finance policy. Experience elsewhere confirms<br />this view and in the United Kingdom, United States of America<br />and other countries the authorities , have exercised greatly increased<br />direction of banking and financial policy generally.<br />The Regulations are planned primarily to achieve two purposes.<br />Firstly, they ensure that the investment and loan policy of the banks<br />should accord with the general principle laid down to govern civil<br />investment, thus closing a major gap hitherto existing. Secondly,</p>
<p>they are designed to prevent the war financial policy of the Government<br />increasing the. profits of the private banks and providing the basis<br />for an-unsound expahsion of credit.<br />To aciieve these purposes the regulations provide that the banks,<br />in making advances and linvestments, shall comply with the policy laid<br />down by' tie. o ii'nwqbe alth Bank from time to time and provide also<br />that the trading-bank . shall lodge in a special account with the Commonwealth'Bank,<br />a. substantial part of the increase in their total assets<br />since' August, 1939. It is. intended that surplus investible funds which<br />accrue in the -future shall also be lodged with the Commonwealth<br />Bank. These funds will remain the property of the private banks and<br />will bear interest to lie paid. by the Commonwealth Bank&gt;: The rate<br />of interest payable will be, determined by the , Commonwealth Bank<br />but itmay not exceed a maximum rate fixed. by the Treasurer..<br />" The trading banks are required . also to provide such information<br />and returns, as are necessary to the Commonwealth Bank and the<br />Treasurer Å for . the purposes of the regulations. The accounts of the<br />banks will, b. e. in. vatigated periodically by the Auditor-General.<br />bdli'ev&amp; that' ' i'hse Regulations mark a definite step forward.<br />Not only can we be assured that the operations of the financial system<br />will, iiifutitre,' b directed wholly towards our common national purposes,-<br />ut'iiW: e bcanfiel even more confident than before of the stability<br />of that system.<br />" One important effect of the Regulations is that the' Government.<br />and the Commonwealth Bank will now be in a position to ensure that<br />every private bank follows a policywhich will operate in the national<br />interest and at the same time provide additional safeguards for the<br />security of the deposits of the public with the banks.

The Commonwealth Bank, in accordance with general principles approved<br />by the Treasurer, -will determine what portion of the private banks' surplus<br />funds available for' inestment are to be deposited in a special account,<br />7.

Exemptions from the Regulations may be made by the Treasurer.<br />An exemption from the Regulations is being granted for two<br />months to all institutions ( other than the private banks referred to)<br />which are, or appear to be, carrying on in Australia the business of<br />banking. This exemption will cover the Launceston and Hobart<br />Savings Banks, also pastoral companies and other institutions which<br />carry on some banking functions. This temporary exemption will give<br />time for inquiry and consideration as to whether any of these institutions<br />should be brought within the Regulations.<br />It will be seen that the Treasurer will work in close collaboration<br />with the Commonwealth Bank in administering the Regulations.<br />Broadly, the powers the Regulations confer are divided almost evenly<br />betw9en the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank with joint powers<br />in some instances.<br />The Regulations mean that banking will be subject to the same<br />kind of control as are all other phases of our national life that are<br />vital to the war effort.<br />" In future a person or corporation ( other than a bank of the<br />Commonwealth or of any State) shall not carry on the business of<br />banking except under licence from the Governor-General."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 24; No. 3, page 22; No.<br />page<br />NEW GUINEA.<br />ENTRY INTO UNCONTROLLED AREAS.:<br />On .26th November, 1941, the Minister for External .

This proposal<br />was considerably modified, and the new principle of aggregation' for<br />rating purposes will operate only in respect of income fioin assets<br />transferred after the 29th October, 1941, by a husband to his wife if<br />the taxable income of the wife exceeds Å 200.<br />" The Government' had proposed to remove the present exemption<br />so as to provide that dividends received by Australian residents from<br />companies,; the profits, of which are derived wholly or partly from outside<br />Australia, should be -taxable in the hands of the recipients. By<br />an amendment dividends from. this source which were receiv&amp; l prior<br />to the 29th October, 1941, will not be subject to tax.</p>
<p>" It was proposed to discontinue the practice of allowing as deductions<br />in arriving at taxable income calls paid on shares in mining<br />companies. The law has been amended by Parliament. This means<br />that the value of the tax concession on mining calls will be approximately.<br />the same as the concession which was enjoyed before the war.<br />The ' Government had proposed that the war-time" company tax<br />should be amended to provide for a statutory percentage of 4 per cent..<br />and that the commencing rate of tax should be 6 per cent.' until a<br />maximum rate of 78 per cent. is reached on the taxable profit in excess<br />of 16 per cent. on capital employed.
