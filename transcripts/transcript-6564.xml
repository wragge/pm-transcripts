EMBARGOED AGAINST CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER NATIONAL PRESS CLUB 29 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
As this campaign draws to its close, the central issues for<br />
the judgment of the Australian people on Saturday remain as<br />
they were at the beginning whether we are, as a nation<br />
under Labor, to consolidate and build upon the great gains<br />
of 1983 and 1984, to sustain in the years ahead strong<br />
economic growth without inflation, and on these firm<br />
foundations to build a fairer, more equitable society in a<br />
nation able to use its new self-respect and stunding in our<br />
region and the world to add a persuasive, persistent and<br />
consistent voice to the cause of peace and disarmament.<br />
Or, by contrast, to accept the alternative offered a<br />
return to the policies of the past and all that they<br />
produced renewed and mounting unemployment, renewed and<br />
mounting inflation, renewed and mounting industrial<br />
disputation, confrontation and division.<br />
It may have been your expectation held perhaps with soj,<br />
trepidation on the part of those of you who have followed<br />
the long campaign trail that I would use this last major<br />
forum of the campaign to recapitulate it all again.<br />
But I am sure you now know and the people of Austraii-now<br />
know, the basic arguments and issues our record and<br />
achievements and program, and that you and they know, all<br />
too well, the record of our opponents and the consequences<br />
of their proposals.<br />
But rather today, beyond bringing together the major threads<br />
and thrusts of our policies and commitments, I want, through<br />
you to the people of Australia, to place our program for the<br />
next three years firmly in the context of our longer vision<br />
for the future of our country a clear, clear-eyed and<br />
above all, clear-headed vision, which recognises, rationally<br />
and objectively, the challenges, the problems, the<br />
difficulties as well as the great opportunities which we all<br />
face together in this decade and beyond.<br />
It is a vision for a nation growing stronger year by year,<br />
by the wise and full use of its rich human and material<br />
resources, as a partner in the world's most dynamic economic<br />
region; for a nation becoming year by yesr more equitable<br />
and more fair, in which true equality of opportunity for all<br />
is no mere slogan but a living reality; and for a nation </p>
<p>constructively, persistently, unremittingly contributing to<br />
' he suoreme objective of a world and a region at peace, free<br />
from tne threat. of nuclear h~ jOloaust.<br />
Let me at once go to the three essential elements of our<br />
program to give flesh and substance to these goals<br />
economic, social., and international.<br />
First, the economic foundations.<br />
Sustained growth without inflation is the very basis and<br />
condition for achieving the legitimate aspirations the<br />
Australian people have for themselves and their families<br />
for improved living standards, for secure employment, for<br />
decent housing and for greater security and greater dignity,<br />
in retirement and sickness or incapacity for whatever.<br />
reason; and to enable us, as a nation, to improve the lot of<br />
those who depend upon social security payments for their<br />
entitlement to share in the prosperity of their country.<br />
We have been described as the lucky country.<br />
Perhaps, in the past, we accepted that description toc<br />
easily. And perhaps, in the past, we allowed ourselves to<br />
ignore the fact that the original author of the phrase<br />
intended, riot mere self-congratulation but a warninq.<br />
For too long we tended to assume that with our abundan1CC<br />
of resources, growth would come naturally, without rea.<br />
effort, and that the world would readily buy our surplus<br />
production. And the result was that, in the halcyon days, opportu. nities<br />
were squandered to place our growth and the maintenance of<br />
our standards on an even firmer footing.<br />
Now, that growth has once again been achieved and tlhis<br />
time by the efforts, restraint and responsibility of tUie<br />
whole community we must ensure we do not make that mist%-ake<br />
again.<br />
Above all, we cannot and must not allow our efforts and<br />
energies to be dissipated in needless conflict and contrived<br />
confrontation of the kind that occurred in the years before<br />
March 1983.<br />
To maintain high levels of growth over a long period without<br />
fuelling inflation requires the right mix of fiscal and<br />
monetary policies, and, as this Government has alone been<br />
able to do, the establishment of an incomes policy through<br />
the Accord, and wide-ranging consultative procedures for the<br />
economy as a whole and for its component sectors.<br />
I believe that on the basis of the approach and the<br />
fl. r-r </p>
<p>undertakings given at the last ulection, we have been able<br />
to move together with ex'-raordinary success in establishing<br />
that vital co-operation and in est~ bli-; hing the essential<br />
policy framework.<br />
This campaign has enabled us to take a major and I believe<br />
in the history of Australian elections, an unprecedented<br />
step towards giving Australia an even stronger economic<br />
policy framework to ensure strong, sustained and enduring<br />
non-inflationary growth in theyears ahead.<br />
And I repeat the commitment I have made on behalf of the<br />
Labor Government of Australia:<br />
In our next three year term of Government<br />
the overall level Of taxation will not increase as a<br />
proportion of gross domestic product;<br />
the deficit will not increase as a proportion of Gross<br />
Domestic Product;<br />
Government spending increases will be restrained below<br />
the rate of economic growth.<br />
And when I say that no previous Prime Minister, no previous<br />
Australian Government, has givcen so clear a forward<br />
commitment, it is because no previous Government has been<br />
able to establish the conditions which make such a<br />
commitment achievable.<br />
Now I have necessarily couched the three elemcnts of that<br />
commitment in the language of the ecnomist.<br />
But let me put it directly in terms of relevance to ordinary<br />
Australian families and citizens it means your tax burden<br />
will be reduced in an economic environment of grow'Ji, with<br />
low inflation and reduced pressure on interest rates.<br />
It is a commitment based on a recognition of the fact that<br />
~ nm oxre decoomythree out of every four Jobs is<br />
provided by the private sector. A healthy, growing<br />
Australian economy requires a healthy, growing private<br />
sector. The demands of Government upon the income of<br />
citizens and business should not inhibit initiative or<br />
investment directly or through excessive expenditures<br />
produce the same result indirectly by imposing upward<br />
pressures on interest rates in the capital market. This can<br />
and will be achieved. Our record shows that we can. And<br />
the Australian and international business and financial<br />
community has, by word and action, expressed its confidence<br />
that we will.<br />
The structure of Australian industry is constantly changing. </p>
<p>In the past that change has occurred haphazardly, often<br />
destructively for both those who employ and those i: ho are<br />
employed, and all too often wiihout any real concern for the<br />
economic anid social implications for the community.<br />
We are therefore committed to encouraging, with the<br />
co-operation of business, trade unions and relevant levels<br />
of Government, the orderly restructuring of Australian<br />
industry. We want to see an1 industrial structure which is<br />
competitive, export-oriented and capable of providing<br />
increased, secure and satisfying employment. Wle have<br />
demonstrated that this can be done in the steel industry<br />
which was facing extinction when we came to o,' fice. And we<br />
have shown it can be done in the motor vehicle industry.<br />
On the part of Government, the pursuit of effective industry<br />
restructuring requires a co-ordination of relevant policy<br />
areas industry and commerce, trade, Science and<br />
technology, education, employment and industrial relations,<br />
defence support. We have already brought these portfolio<br />
areas together at the Cabinet committee level under the<br />
chairmanship of Senator Button. In our next term this<br />
co-ordination will be made even more effective at the<br />
Ministerial and official level..<br />
Education and trainino is so important in thi~ s matter that I<br />
should say something more about it.<br />
We have strengthened and given certainty of funding to both<br />
the public and the private sector at the primary and<br />
secondary level, arid have provided the first real increases<br />
in funding a'l the tertiary level for several years.<br />
But we must not, as a nation, delude ourselves that<br />
increased funding alone meets the requirements of the<br />
future. We must be-concerned with the quality of our education<br />
systerit to ensure that our young people are equipped as well<br />
as possible to work and live in an increasingly complex and<br />
rapidly changing world. Our Government has commissioned<br />
Professor Karmel to report to uis on what is required to<br />
achieve this outcome in the primary and secondary levels and<br />
Mr Hudson, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Tertiary<br />
Education Commission, in the tertiary area. We will a. ct<br />
promptly upon their reports.<br />
Our concern as a nation for our young people must go beyond<br />
substantially improving the formal education system.<br />
Over the years the whole range of employment, training and<br />
retraining programs has evolved in a totally ad hoc,<br />
unco-ordinated and often irrelevant fashion. </p>
<p>We will soon receive the report of Hr Peter Kirby on this<br />
critically important subject and, on the basis of that<br />
report, wqill move to create a coherent, integrated set of<br />
proqrdms that will maich the aspirations and training of our<br />
youth to the new and changing requirements of industry.<br />
And in this area we should all note with satisfaction that<br />
more of our young people are staying at school longer.<br />
Education retention rates have been abysmally low by<br />
international standards. But from thrity-six per cent in<br />
1982 they have jumped to forty per cent in 1983, the highest<br />
for a decade and will be higher again in 1984, as a result<br />
of our policies. We will continue the Participation and<br />
Equity Program, and other important initiatives, to bring<br />
Australia up to levels which we need, and can achieve. We<br />
cannot afford to be a second or third rate nation in the<br />
training of the talents of our youth and under a Labor<br />
Government, we will not be.<br />
I have referred to our place in the world's most dynamic<br />
region. If we are to maximise our own economic growth we<br />
must increasingly, as I have often put it, mesh our econcmy<br />
into the rapidly expanding economies of North-east,<br />
South-east Asia and the Pacific. Our policies will continuWe<br />
increasingly to be directed towards ensuring that we<br />
contribute to and benefit from the growth of these<br />
countries, not only in agricultural and mineral products but<br />
through a range of processed and manufactured goods and<br />
services, applying the best technology available.<br />
One uf the most important single developments in the viorld<br />
today is the econom~ ic revolution in China. The productivo<br />
energies of almost a quarter of the world's population are<br />
being released by that revolution which is opening up China<br />
more and more to the Western world and as a result of our<br />
endeavours, not those of the Government alone, but of the<br />
business community as well, no country in the Western -, Orld<br />
is better regarded or better placed to be involved, to our<br />
mutual benefit, with China than Australia. We will continue<br />
to strengthen this significant relationship.<br />
And in the broader area of international trade, we will<br />
continue our careful work in the international forums to<br />
encourage the resumption of multilateral trade negotiations<br />
and to defend Australia's interests against unfair and often<br />
subsidised competition in world markets.<br />
And that is an effort we will continue not only in defence<br />
of Australia's interests but to avoid the great damage, if<br />
not disaster that could be done to international trade if<br />
there were to be increasing resort to these practices.<br />
I now come to the second element our social program. </p>
<p>And let me say that for this L~ boc Government and for this<br />
Labor Prime ' Minister, our social goals are in no w-y, a<br />
secondary priority; they are a fundamental priority the<br />
very heart of what Labor is about.<br />
But our goals cannot be achieved, either in the short or<br />
long-term, without sustained, non-inflationary growth.<br />
But let me say : a society which dedicated itself, narrowly<br />
and exclusively, to a single goal of economic growth, would<br />
sow the seed of its ultimate disintegration.<br />
True, growth should be pursued for the benefits it produces<br />
for the direct participants in the process by which<br />
productive growth is achieved.<br />
But equally, as a national goal, it must justify itself, and<br />
be inspired by, the recognition that growth is the basis for<br />
ensuring that those of our fellowi Australians who are not<br />
its direct beneficiaries receive from a compa~ ssionate<br />
society the opportuity to share equitably in the fruits of<br />
growth. Our vision is for an Austraila in -Which this will be assumed<br />
as a natural obligation Of our society. Our commitment is<br />
to that end and our policies will be directed to its<br />
achievement. And it is to this goal that we have applied the benefits of<br />
growth already achieved.<br />
While all Australians have benefited from economic recovery,<br />
the greatest beneficiaries in relative terms have been the<br />
poor and disadvantaged, and low and middle income earners.<br />
In framing our last 3udget, the Cabinet took the view that<br />
the highest priority for new outlays should te accorded to<br />
social welfare recipients, which was reflected in the<br />
provision . of more than $ 1 billion additional funding in a<br />
full financial year. The tax cuts now being enjoyed by all<br />
Australians, are also highly progressive, with low and<br />
middle income earners receiving the greatest benefits. As<br />
well, of course, the Medicare levy is highly progressive,<br />
with the lowest charges for health services being levied on<br />
those who have the least capacity to pay.<br />
The Government will also be giving the achievement of<br />
twenty-five per cent of male average weekly earnings as the<br />
basic pension rate, the highest priority among welfare<br />
measures during its second term.<br />
Already we have raised pensions as a percentage of male AWE<br />
from 22.9 per cent in December 1982 to 23.8 per cent today.<br />
But I put to you a broader vision. So often society is </p>
<p>called upon support those who would make no demand upon<br />
the community if they had been able fully to develop the<br />
talent,-within then.. Our visinn i~ s for an Australia within<br />
which every person irrespective of' sex, race, ethnic origin<br />
or income levels of parents, shall. have an equality of<br />
opportunity to develop to the full their individual talents.<br />
Our commitment is to that end, and our policies will be<br />
directed to its achievement. And, in this respect, let me<br />
say that there is no part of our record to date in which we<br />
take greater pride than the many measures we have initiated<br />
to remove discrimination against women in Australia.<br />
No Government recognises more deeply than ours that so many<br />
women still desire their fulfilment from the role of wife<br />
and mother. We respect them and will continue as we have in<br />
so many ways to increase the satisfaction of family life.<br />
Equally, no Government has recognised more clearly the<br />
obligation to give substance not just lip-service to<br />
society's, claim that there is no di* J'scrimination against<br />
women who seek their fulfilment outside or in addition to<br />
the role in the home. We will continue to do so.<br />
But underlying everything everything we hope for,<br />
everything we are working for is the third element of cur<br />
vision for Austialia a world free of the nightmare of<br />
nuclear catastrophe.<br />
Long before I became Prime Minister, long before I entered<br />
Parliament, 2t every appropriate international and national<br />
forum, and whenever the opportunity arose, I have affirmcd<br />
and reaffirmed my deepest belief, that all the efforts to<br />
create a more prosperous, a freer and a fairer society In<br />
our own community and in the world community, all will have<br />
been i vain, if we cannot live in a world at peace.<br />
There can be no higher purpose in Government than the<br />
pursuit ef positively peacef~ il relations between nations and<br />
particularly the elimination of the threat of nuclear<br />
devastation and destruction.<br />
No person and no Party is entitled to claim a monopoly of<br />
either morality or wisdom in these matters. My Party and my<br />
Government make no such claim.<br />
But we do claim credit for the hard, unremitting, purposeful<br />
and effective work we have done in bilateral negotiations<br />
and all relevant international forums to advance the cause<br />
of effective disarmament, the reduction of conventional and<br />
nuclear arsenals, the prevention of the spread of nuclear<br />
weapons, the achievement of a convention against chemical<br />
weapons, the prevention of an extension of the arms . race<br />
into outer space and the initiative for a South Pacific<br />
Nuclear Free Zone. </p>
<p>This week, Australia o'itained a larjer vote than last year<br />
for our resolution to establish the processes leading to<br />
negotiation of a comprehensive Test Ban Trpeaty. Again we<br />
were ablE!, as last year, to persuade the super-pow.-ers and<br />
the other nuclear weapons states not to oppose this year's<br />
stronger resolution.<br />
We are doing this work without drafratics, without<br />
grandstanding, without breast-beating because that, and<br />
that alone, is the way anything worthwhile, anything<br />
lasting, can be achieved.<br />
This work has been pursued with integrity by my Foreign<br />
Minis. ter. Bill Hayden, assisted by our Ambassador for<br />
Disarmament and an expanded Arms Control and Disarmament<br />
Branch in the Department of Foreign Affairs. We are<br />
establishing an independent Peace Research Centre at the<br />
Australiii National University.<br />
We will riot pursue the dangerous futility and fatuity of<br />
unilateralism. We are an aligned nation and our alliance<br />
with the United States is an alliance of peaceful and<br />
defensive purpose. Our Government will never initiate<br />
offensive action against another country.<br />
And, I repeat, we will continue to pursue the constructive<br />
work of the past twenty months in the field of disapmament<br />
so that Australia will retain the widespread inter-national<br />
respect which was reflected in our recent record vote for<br />
membership of the United Nations Security Council.<br />
I know the depth off feeling on this supreme issue of our<br />
time the supreme issue in human history. And everything I<br />
have said, everything we have done as a government,<br />
everything we are committed to continue to do, proves that<br />
my colleagues and I share that feeling completely,<br />
unequivocally, profoundly. There is no question about our<br />
needing some kind of message from the electorate on this<br />
matter, or a reminder about the deep feelings of the people<br />
of Australia, particularly our young people. We need no<br />
prompting.<br />
We hear the voice of the people and it is the voice of<br />
Labor and of this Labor Government.<br />
And for our part, we will not need to analyse the results<br />
next Saturday to learn the will of the Australian people on<br />
this matter; or our responsibilities as the Government of<br />
Australia the responsibility and the duty to continue our<br />
unremitting efforts in the cause of world peace and nuclear<br />
disarmament. </p>
<p>Conclusion We live in the most dramatically changing and challenging<br />
times in recorded history.<br />
The nature of the human condition has been put in a most<br />
striking way by the American sociologist, Kenneth Boulding.<br />
Speaking for his contemporaries, he said:<br />
" I was born in the middle of human history. The world<br />
in which I live is as different from the world in which<br />
I was born as that world was from the worid of Julius<br />
Caesar."<br />
And the challenge to us, in this country and in this age, is<br />
to face these times with purpose, with confidence and selfconfidence<br />
confidence in ourselves, confidence in each<br />
other that together, we can use our resources our<br />
physical and material and above all, human resources to<br />
build a better, a freer and a fairer Australia, and help<br />
build a better, freer, fairer world,<br />
And in putting this fundamental proposition this simple<br />
statement of achievable goals -for ourselves, for our<br />
children and our grandchildren -I find a deep continuity in<br />
the themes of this election campaign and those of the la-t<br />
campaign despite the great differences in Australia's<br />
situation, now and then, and the great differences in<br />
Australia's prospects, now and then.<br />
For the uodez-lying message of that campaign and the<br />
underlying strength of Labor's case in 1983, was hope,<br />
confidence and co-operation, in place of despair and in<br />
place of the politics of fear and confrontation.<br />
And that remains the alternative in this election; and that<br />
contr3st has provided the fundamental distinction between<br />
our Government and the alternative.<br />
And while in these opening remarks, I have deliberately<br />
refrained from canvassing in any detail what the alternative<br />
offers, I feel bound to raise one point specifically.<br />
And that is their proposal I regard it, and I believe the<br />
overwhelming majority of people in Australia will regard it,<br />
as a threat to abolish the Arbitration Commission. There<br />
Could be no clearer evidence that what they offer is a<br />
return to the policies which produced the division,<br />
disruption and disaster of their last term of office.<br />
And one can only ask: will these people never learn the<br />
lessons of history? </p>
<p>Friends, I firmly believe that no country is better endowed than<br />
Australia to meet successiully the great challenges of our<br />
time, the great challenges and opportunities of the region<br />
and the world.<br />
And we are now splendidly placed to hand over to our<br />
children as we and they approach the 21st century a<br />
nation of strength and growth, of fairness; a nation and 3<br />
people entitled to look at itself, its achievements and its<br />
standing in the world, with pride, dignity and self-respect.<br />
In the body of this speech I have concentrated more on the<br />
challenges, the complexities, the problems and the<br />
difficulties we all undoubtedly must confront, together, in<br />
the years ahead.<br />
But it is precisely because there are challenges, precisely<br />
because there are going to be problems and difficulties,<br />
that Australia needs a strong, united government with a<br />
clear and consistent idea of what lies ahead; and a<br />
government with a clear and consistent program to meet those<br />
challenges.<br />
And in December 1984, and for the next three years and<br />
beyond the leadership that Australia needs and deserves<br />
can only come from an Australian Labor Government.<br />
My colleagjues and I have devoted our public lives to<br />
equipping ourselves to give that kind of leadership to our<br />
great countr'y. We, together with you the people of<br />
Australia, have successfully met the immediate challenge of<br />
getting our country moving and growing again.<br />
Let us now, in the same spirit and I believe with the same<br />
certainty of success set out hands to the greater, the<br />
more enduring task, of achievi1ng together these great<br />
national purposes and goals I have set out today, for our<br />
Australia of the future, and our children' s future. </p>
