    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome this morning’s announcement from Kensington Palace confirming the visit of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and The Duchess of Sussex to Australia in spring.</p>
<p>As part of Their Royal Highnesses’ official engagements in Australia, they will attend the Invictus Games in Sydney.</p>
<p>As the founder of the Invictus Games, The Duke of Sussex has become a champion for war veterans around the world, including in Australia.</p>
<p>His attendance, alongside The Duchess of Sussex, will be a wonderful highlight for the more than 500 competitors and thousands of spectators.</p>
<p>I know the Australian people will greet Their Royal Highnesses with great warmth and excitement wherever they go during their time here.</p>
<p>Lucy and I look forward to hosting their visit and watching the remarkable feats of Invictus athletes from around the world.</p>
