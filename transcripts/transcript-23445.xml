    <content><![CDATA[<p>On Anzac Day, Australians at home and abroad pause to remember all who have served our country.</p>
<p>This is the 99th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>Over coming years, Australians will commemorate the centenary of the Great War and remember the tide of events that shaped our nation and that still cast a shadow over the wider world.</p>
<p>The First World War impacted on Australia like nothing else before or since.</p>
<p>It was the crucible that forged our nation.</p>
<p>From a population of just under five million, 417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home.</p>
<p>Of men aged 18 to 42, almost one in two served in uniform.</p>
<p>Of those who served overseas, almost one in five were killed in action.</p>
<p>Of the 270,000 who returned, more than half had been wounded â and others had mental scars that never healed.</p>
<p>We will never glorify war.Â  Still, the worst of times can bring out the best in us.</p>
<p>This day we remember all who have served our country â in our Army, Navy and Air Force â and through all conflicts: the Boer War, the First and Second World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and everywhere our Armed Forces are sent in our name.</p>
<p>The presence of Australians at Anzac Day events is a demonstration that we are a nation of memory, not just of memorials.</p>
<p>The character of our servicemen and women has helped to define our nation. Their courage, mateship and sacrifice have been exemplary.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
