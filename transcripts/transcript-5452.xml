TUESDAY 23 September, 1980<br />
ASSISTANCE TO QUEENSLAND LOCAL AUTHORITIES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser and the Premier of Queensland,<br />
Mr. Joh Bjelke-Petersen, today announced agreement on assistance to<br />
Local Authorities in Queensland, where the current drought had placed<br />
the availability of normal water supplies at risk.<br />
Mr. Fraser and Mr. Bjelke-Petersen said that the special initiatives,<br />
which would only apply for the duration of the current drought,<br />
would be of particular benefit in Laidley, Thallon and Mount Morgan<br />
where the situation is particularly difficult.<br />
The arrangements decided on today will enable Local Authorities to<br />
augment existing water supplies on a permanent basis and will also<br />
subsidise the purchase and the transport of water from the nearest<br />
available source to the local water supply system.<br />
To be eligible for assistance, the local Authority will be required<br />
to demonstrate that existing water supplies are adequate under<br />
normal conditions, that the present supply difficulties are a direct<br />
consequence of the current drought, and that the proposed remedial<br />
action is the most practical and economical way of supplementing<br />
the town's water supply.<br />
Mr. Fraser and Mr. Bjelke-Petersen agreed that th6 State would make<br />
a non-repayable grant of one-third of the cost of approved facilities.<br />
The remainder would be provided by Queensland, in the form of<br />
repayable loans, on repayment terms and at interest rates similar to<br />
those applicable to loans and to primary producers experiencing<br />
drought conditions, with such expenditure being eligible for<br />
Commonwealth assistance in accordance with the established Natural<br />
cisaster relief arrangements.<br />
in relation to the purchase and the transport of water, the Prime<br />
Minister and the Premier agreed that this should be-eligible for a<br />
dollar for dolar subsidy. The Conm-onwealth and the State would met<br />
cent of the costs under the Natural Disaster Assistance Arrangements.<br />
remnaining 0 per cent would be met by the Local Authority from<br />
its own resources. / 2<br />

Mr. Fraser and Mr. Bjelke-Petersen expressed concern at the<br />
severity of the drought in Queensland and agreed that those<br />
measures were well designed to ensure that adequate water<br />
supplies were available in areas where shortages were developing.<br />
The generosity of the measures provided tangible evidence of<br />
the concern felt by both Governments.<br />
The State, of course, will be responsible for the administrative<br />
arrangements associated with distributing these further assistance<br />
measures. 000---</p>
