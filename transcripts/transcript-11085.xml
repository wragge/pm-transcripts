    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>......very good thanks and I'm looking forward to coming</p>
<p> to Kalgoorlie this morning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Fantastic. Now what is the purpose of your visit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't been to Kalgoorlie since I became Prime Minister.</p>
<p> I think in fact I'll be the first Prime Minister to visit Kalgoorlie</p>
<p> for 18 years and it's an opportunity with the new Federal Member</p>
<p> for Kalgoorlie, Barry Haase to talk to the representatives of the</p>
<p> various industries. It's a very famous part of Australia. I'll</p>
<p> naturally listen to what the mining industry's got to say, but</p>
<p> generally an opportunity to meet the people of Kalgoorlie and to register</p>
<p> the point that my Government is very interested and concerned about</p>
<p> regional Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay. How important do you think that areas, major mining industries</p>
<p> like Kalgoorlie's are to the economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well mining is a very important part of the Australian economy. It</p>
<p> provides a huge amount of export income to the Australian economy.</p>
<p> It's a very important part of the Western Australian economy</p>
<p> but from a national perspective the contribution it makes to the aggregate</p>
<p> Australian economy is very big. Mining is of course influenced heavily</p>
<p> by world markets and world market prices, and every mining activity</p>
<p> in this country is influenced by world commodity prices. That is certainly</p>
<p> the most powerful influence of all on the industry.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much of the uncertainty over native title at the moment do you</p>
<p> blame for the cut in the exploration dollars.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a very big contributor, and can I say that for every day</p>
<p> that the Western Australian Labor Opposition holds up the passage</p>
<p> of the native title amendments through the Western Australian Parliament,</p>
<p> the more money is taken from the value of the mining industry in this</p>
<p> country. The mining industry in Australia and Western Australia has</p>
<p> already suffered from the huge delay inflicted by the Labor Party</p>
<p> at a Federal level, in the Senate. We finally got the 10 point plan</p>
<p> through, and while the Labor Party in Western Australia refuses to</p>
<p> pass the ten point plan they inflict damage on the gold mining industry</p>
<p> of Kalgoorlie, they inflict damage in the mining industry of Western</p>
<p> Australia. If they're interested in Western Australian industry</p>
<p> and jobs, and the mining industry of this State, they will pass the</p>
<p> Court Government's legislative changes without delay.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay. Now there's been some talk that Mr Costello's authorisation</p>
<p> of the sale of half of Australia's gold reserve indicates that</p>
<p> the Government doesn't value gold as a commodity worth storing.</p>
<p> How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that claim is wrong. The decision of the Reserve Bank, which</p>
<p> it was, to deal with Australia's gold reserves as it did was</p>
<p> a very good decision. If it hadn't taken that decision it would</p>
<p> have cost our foreign exchange reserves very dearly because it was</p>
<p> an astute decision of the time given the movements in the value and</p>
<p> the market price of gold on world markets. In fact it was a decision</p>
<p> that on any application of ordinary business principles was a very</p>
<p> intelligent decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you feel that has any bearing on the fact that the gold price is</p>
<p> still in a slump, hasn't risen since then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no no. That's really quite unrelated. It was a proper move</p>
<p> to protect the value of the gold and foreign exchange reserve, holdings</p>
<p> of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Reserve Bank of Australia would</p>
<p> have been retreant to its responsibilities to the Australian people</p>
<p> if it had not acted to get a good price and to have the right and</p>
<p> appropriate and most valuable mix of our reserve assets.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay. And are there any plans to sell off any more of our gold reserves?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look, I wouldn't speculate about that. Those decisions are</p>
<p> ultimately made by the Reserve Bank which is the custodian of our</p>
<p> gold and foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay. And what are your plans here for the rest of the day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll be going to a civic reception this morning, I'll</p>
<p> be attending a luncheon, I'll be going possibly to meet some</p>
<p> other groups, and generally move around the town and I'm looking</p>
<p> forward to it. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard, Thank you very much for your time.</p>
