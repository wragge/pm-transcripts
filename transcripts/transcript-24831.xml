    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will provide $116 million for the Armadale Road duplication between Anstey Road and Tapper Road. </p>
<p>The project will improve safety and ease traffic congestion on one of the main east-west links within the Perth metropolitan transport network.</p>
<p>Traffic on Armadale Road has increased significantly in recent years and is forecast to increase by a further five per cent annually due to ongoing residential and commercial development in the region.</p>
<p>This section of Armadale Road has a crash rate considerably higher than the Western Australian average. This commitment will significantly improve safety on this stretch of road.</p>
<p>Armadale Road links the two southern public transport corridors and provides access to other major arterial roads—Kwinana Freeway, the Tonkin, South West and Albany highways.</p>
<p>Up to 27,500 vehicles use the section of road every day and the growing traffic congestion was a concern to the Cities of Cockburn and Armadale.</p>
<p>Cockburn Central is a regional transport corridor and activity hub, close to the Kwinana Freeway and major arterial roads including Armadale Road and Beeliar Drive.</p>
<p>The project will also involve upgrading the seven kilometre stretch of road to a four-lane dual carriageway.</p>
<p>Upgrades will be made to the Nicholson Road and Fraser Road intersections and a Principal Shared Path on the northern side of Armadale Road.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has committed $116 million to this $145 million project, with the remaining $29 million to be provided by the Western Australian Government.</p>
