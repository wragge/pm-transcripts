73/ 95<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
THE HON FRED DALY AO<br />
With the death of Fred Daly, Australia has lost an outstanding Parliamentarian, the<br />
last survivor of the Curtin Labor Government, a man who humanised the<br />
parliamentary and political process and brought it closer to people, and one of our<br />
leading raconteurs and wits.<br />
Fred Daly loved the Parliament. He was a brilliant and frequently very funny<br />
parliamentary speaker. He entered Federal Parliament in 1943 and he served as a<br />
backbencher under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.<br />
Much of his political career was spent during the long years of the Labor Party's<br />
opposition from 1949 to 1972, first as Whip and then as a member of the front bench.<br />
Fred's fighting spirit, his enjoyment of the rough and tumble of parliamentary<br />
exchanges and his humour were very important in maintaining the parliamentary<br />
party's morale during this period.<br />
Fred spent his last three years in active politics as a member of the Whitlam<br />
Government. His work as a Minister and particularly as Leader of the House of<br />
Representatives was marked by his alert mind, quick wit and good humour.<br />
In the twenty years of his retirement, Fred Daly became a much loved writer and<br />
public speaker about Australian politics. His fund of memories and anecdotes<br />
served to keep younger generations informed and interested in the political history of<br />
the 1940' s, 50' s and 60' s where so much of Fred's political life had been lived.<br />
Fred spent those years in Canberra and became something of an institution in the<br />
National Capital's political, social and sporting life.<br />
My sincere sympathy goes out to Fred Daly's family. He will be deeply missed.<br />
GLADSTONE 2 August 1995 </p>
