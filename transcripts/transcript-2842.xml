THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 6 MARCH 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is very much more pleasant lighting and<br />
accommodation. I might mention it's by favour of the President<br />
that we are able to use this Committee Room.<br />
Gentlemen, the Cabinet this morning made some appointments.<br />
First of all, there were two vacancies on the Board of the<br />
Commonwealth Trading Bank within the Commonwealth Banking<br />
Corporation. One of ' the retiring men, Sir Brian Massy-Greene,<br />
has been reappointed. The other position has been filled by<br />
Mr Barnie Williams.<br />
Four appointments have been made to help Professor Henderson<br />
with his poverty inoufij. They are Professor Gates, the Professor<br />
of Economics and Head of the Department of Economics within the<br />
University of Queensland, Professor Sackville, one of the<br />
Professors of Law within the University of New South Wales, the<br />
Reverend George Martin, Superintendent of the Port Adelaide<br />
Central Methodist Mission, and Mr R. T. Fitzgerald, the Chief<br />
Research Officer of the Australian Council for Education Research<br />
and Editor of the Quarterly Review of the Australian Education,<br />
a member of the national Committee for Social Science Teaching.<br />
Mr Hayden can give you the details of that inquiry and the<br />
augmented terms of reference. A new administrator has beena'u. cd<br />
to Christmas Island. It is Mr Francis Scott Evatt who has bcW<br />
the Department of External Territories since November 1959 aiÃ±&amp; hc*<br />
been Acting Administrator since last July. The Governor-Genc-al.<br />
mentioned in his speech that the Government proposed to estab.Ã± ih<br />
a Protection Commission to advise on assistance for both Priwiary<br />
and Secondary Industries. You will remember that the general out'line<br />
of the Protection Commission was announced about ten months a : o<br />
and its relation to the functions being carried out by the old<br />
Department of Trade and Secondary Industry and the Department of<br />
Customs and Excise and of course relevant matters from the Dezi&amp;::.-<br />
ment of Primary Industry.<br />
On the first of this month, I wrote to Sir John Crawford<br />
inviting him to advise on the establishment of the Protecgtion<br />
Commission. Yesterday Sir John replied agreeing to do so.<br />
He is egn work on it. While Sir John is not going to con( uc<br />
a public inquiry, he has indicated that he would be preparc: tLo<br />
receive written submissions. Anybody wishing to take the opr; c<br />
to put these forward should direct them to Sir John through the<br />
Secretary of my Department by the end of next month.<br />
There are several visitors coming this month, the first<br />
half of next month, Mr PV" olichev, the U. S. S. R. Minister f or<br />
Foreign Trade will be here betwecn 11 and 18 of this mont'h;<br />
Tun Ismail, the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, will be c.<br />
between the same dates; Mr G. W. S. Malecela, the Foreign iicc<br />
of Tanzania, is arriving on the 9th for some ten days; Mr Bijecsic,<br />
the Prime Minister of Yugozlavia, will be here on~ 20, 21 and 22. </p>
<p>He is making a visit to many countries in the region;<br />
President Hammer de Roburt will be here from 3-5 April returning<br />
the visit which the Special Minister, Senator Willesee made on<br />
behalf of our new Government to celebrate the 5th anniversary of<br />
Nauruan independence, and Mr Arnold Smith, the Commonwealth<br />
Secretary-General, will be here from 3-16 April.<br />
There were a very large number of decisions by the Cabinet<br />
and I think if you want any further information on them, you can<br />
ask me or ask my staff afterwards. We approved the drafting of<br />
legislation to implement the Montreal Convention relating to<br />
Protection of Aircraft, 1971; legislation to amend the Marriage<br />
Act no consent required if you are 18 or more; legislation to<br />
implement the 1966 International Convention on the elimination<br />
of all forms of racial discrimination to which the Governor-General<br />
made reference in his speech opening the Parliament; legislation<br />
to change the terminology of magistrates to enable new Tasmanian<br />
legislation to come into operation, the Companies act on the<br />
Securities and Exchange Commission, Restrictive Trade Practices<br />
Monopolies and Consumer Protection legislation those two items<br />
are initial drafting to take advantage of the presence in Australia<br />
for some months of two United States experts whom Senator Murphy<br />
recruited, but the general framework has to go to the Economic<br />
Committee of the Cabinet; legislation to incorporate the National<br />
Gallery which was approved in principle in the Parliament before<br />
last and not mentioned in the last Parliament; legislation for<br />
further amendment of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the principal<br />
matter being to limit the variation from the quota of electors<br />
from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. It will be remembered that in<br />
1958 the Constitution Review Committee consisting of 6 Labor,<br />
4 Liberal and 2 Country Party members unanimously said that<br />
per cent was dufficient to cover all variations between censuses<br />
and so we are implementing that recommendation and we will be<br />
putting to the Parliament that the criteria for distribution should<br />
virtually be restored to what they were until 1964-65, that is<br />
one starts from the point of view of the quota; legislation to<br />
cover the new Departments Appropriations legislation to cover<br />
the Stevadoring Industry, to adopt amendments to the I. L. O.<br />
Constitution, to introduce the general insurance legislation<br />
which was tabled last Parliament; some further technical<br />
amendments to the Income Tax Law. We'll be moving to reappoint<br />
the Joint Committee on the A. C. T. We've approved amendments to the<br />
Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisations Charter which were<br />
approved at the Conference last year. We are establishing a<br />
Commonwealth Occupational Health Service, grants to the States<br />
for water projects, amendments to the National Regional and Urban<br />
Development Authority Act it will be the Cities Commission<br />
Act, acquisition of freehold land in Darwin, and at Oaks Estate<br />
and Hall and Tharwa. The general principle of publication of<br />
reports by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Bureau of<br />
Transport Economics, Bureau of Roads, will be publishing all thosoc<br />
reports. Amendments to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporatio;<br />
there are quite a number of them I haven't purported to give<br />
the details of them. I have the submissions here.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Barnard is present with you at today's<br />
Press Conference. Sir, is it proper to ask questions of him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course. </p>
<p>S~ J.<br />
Then, M r Barnard, if I might direct a question to you,<br />
you tabled in the ' House of Representatives today a statement<br />
by your Permanent Head, Sir Arthur Tange, concerning the matters;<br />
relating to Mr Lloyd's reinto rmyour staff. Do you a cce-, pc-<br />
Sir Arthur Tange's version of these affairs completely?<br />
MR BARNARD: There are some reservations that I would want to<br />
make. Generally the statement is his version of what occurred at<br />
the time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Next question.<br />
Mr Whitlam, either to you or Mr Barnard, whichever you think<br />
is more appropriate: on the question of overseas bases-, can you.<br />
now explain to us why it would imperil the furth-e-ruse of thlese<br />
bases to tell us the general purposes as you promised the Labor<br />
Government would? Can you tell us how it would be conceivable<br />
that joint control should be exercised by the Australian Government<br />
over them, I mean does this mean we intercept American signals,<br />
we have a hand on the switch to turn the power off, what does it<br />
mean, and finally can you tell us something which was rather<br />
obviously left out of Mr Barnard's statement to what extent<br />
would these bases be targets should the Americans become involved<br />
in a war which did not necessarily concern us but which was a<br />
conflict with another nuclear power?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't intend to elaborate on the statement<br />
which Mr Barnard made after Cabinet and Caucus consideration la~<br />
Wednesday. I've quite satisfied myself that to state the gcne;-..Ã±<br />
purposes of the satellites related to Pine Gap near Alice Spring~ s<br />
and Nurunga near Woomera would be to render the function quitce<br />
futile. I don't propose to state the purposes of them. I've<br />
satisfied myself as regards those two facilities and also I<br />
imagine everybody is satisfied as regards the facilities at<br />
Amberley and Alice Springs that they are not part of any weapo.<br />
system. They can not be used -any of them to make war on any<br />
other country. I don't know -nobody knows the full implicationis<br />
of the North-West Cape Station for which legislation was passed<br />
in 1963. There are to be negotiations on that matter.<br />
Mr Hartley said the other night that the North-West Cape<br />
Station should be subjected to political control by the Austraiian;<br />
Government. Will that be discussed in negotiations with the<br />
Americans?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The fact that this would be discussed has been<br />
announced by the Minister.<br />
But will that point<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Minister has stated what he will be discu.:, sinc,.<br />
Mr Barnard, you said you had some reservations about<br />
Sirr thr Tiies statement that was tabled today. Could you tELL<br />
us what those reservations were?<br />
MR BARNARD: You have the statement now and it does give<br />
Sir Arthur Tange ' s version of what happened at the time. I quitL-e<br />
frankly admitted this afternoon that I only learned last night and<br />
this morning that there were some circumstances which apply to this<br />
matter which were not previously known to me. But what I do want<br />
to make clear and want to emphasize is that when the question of </p>
<p>the discussions were first raised with me I'm now referring to<br />
the discussions which were to take place with Lord Carrington-<br />
I sought advice from the Departmental Head about protocol, and<br />
the information that was given to me was that it was not usual<br />
because there may be some matters involving questions that were<br />
the concern only of the two countries involved that it was not normal<br />
for members of a Minister's staff to attend those discussions, and<br />
at the time I accepted that advice. I subsequently thought about<br />
it and believed it was in my own interests to have a member of my<br />
staff present at the discussions and at that stage I advised<br />
Sir Arthur Tange that there should be a member of my staff present<br />
and I named Mr Woolner.<br />
I named Mr Woolner because he was my research officer and he had<br />
attended a number of the discussions with me. That is, on the<br />
question of the rationalisation of thae aircraft industry, when<br />
I have had discussions concerning the. Mr Woolner had<br />
been with me and so I suggested that Mr Woolner should accompany me<br />
to the discussions. Well, when I saw the report in the newspaper<br />
the next day subsequent to Mr Lloyd's decision to resign, that<br />
it was because he had not been invited, or had been told that he<br />
should not attend the briefings between Lord Carrington and myself,<br />
I immediately raised this question with Sir Arthur Tange. I said<br />
' did you advise a member of my staff that he should not attend'<br />
and the answer that I receivedi was ' no<br />
Now it is quite clear that some matters have been made clear<br />
to me which were not made clear to me at the time. All that I can<br />
say to you further to this is that that position will be rectified.<br />
No departmental head will advise any member of my staff abouil iLheir<br />
duties and I want to make that perfectly clear. In the same way<br />
I have also indicated that so far as decisions concerning the<br />
policy of this Government are concerned I will make them. As a<br />
result of the decisions of the Government, the Prime Ministe.,:<br />
and the Government, I will make them not the Department. Now<br />
I think this ought to be clearly understood.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, do you consider that your statement<br />
just now not to reveal the general purposes of the Pine Gap and<br />
Woomera bases conflicts with Labor policy which states tiht<br />
ge-neraf purposes shall be revealed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course I don't. I don't think it conflicts<br />
with anything in Labor policy.<br />
Do you accept that the Labor policy does state this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't got the text here.<br />
Sir, could I then end with this: Do you agree with<br />
Mr Barnard's statement in the House today that when he says tW<br />
the Government will make the decisions and that the Governmen* twill<br />
give due consideration to the-Party's decisions, do you<br />
consider this conflicts with the policy which states that the<br />
Conference is the supreme body which binds Party members?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I put the Party's policy for this Parliamon,-<br />
in my policy speech. That stands. If the Party changes its pol. icy<br />
then the changed policy will be put to the people at the next<br />
elections. Sir, what progress has the Government made towards beefing<br />
up the A. I. D. C. in its role of reducing foreign ownership of </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I'm sorry. We did do that this morning. I<br />
haven't got the thing here. we approved a considerable number<br />
of amendments to the A. I. D. C. Act to enable the drafting to<br />
proceed. Some of them require final form after consultation<br />
between Dr Cairns as the Minister for Secondary Industry and<br />
the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. This is because there<br />
are some matters of detail concerning the loan raising by the<br />
A. I. D. C. which have to be considered in the context of the<br />
financial agreement and the gentlemen's agreement which cover<br />
loan raising by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States and<br />
loan raising by semi-Government authorities with the approval<br />
of the Loan Council. Also there are some details which have to<br />
be carefully drafted in the light of the constitutionality of<br />
them. For instance, the A. I. D. C. could no more carry on some<br />
activities in its own right than the Commonwealth could carry<br />
on those activities in any other form. But the Commonwealth can<br />
carry on practically any activities if they're in the contexi.<br />
of financial corporations as phrased in Section 51 of the<br />
Constitution. But there are quite a number of amendments which<br />
have been approved Dr Cairns can give you the details if you<br />
like I suppose I can send for them now. They were in the Cabinet's<br />
Economic Committee file which I didn't bring down.<br />
Mine is on the question of the secrecy under which A. I. D. C.<br />
operates. Is this being<br />
PRIME ,' MINISTER: No, the amendments were ones to carry out<br />
practically the full range of policies for the A. I. D. C. which<br />
were mentioned in the policy speech. They are quite extensive<br />
amendments, but you'll see the nature of them if you read~ th~ c<br />
policy speech.<br />
Mr Barnard if I may, I wonder if you could tell us, Sir,<br />
on what grounds you yesterday offered a differing explanation...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen, I'm not going to have any more<br />
of the Conference taken up on this. I'm not going to be party<br />
to fomenting differences between the Minister and former members<br />
of his staff or the Minister and the Head of his Department.<br />
It can be done separately.<br />
Sir, we were told by one paper today that the main event*-<br />
in Cabinet was to be a go-woe contest between Mr Crean and<br />
Dr Cairns on the subject of inflation or expansion. How did tChait<br />
match finish?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Nothing in the Cabinet or the Economic Commitccc<br />
of Cabinet bore any relationship to the forecast. I have mentio<br />
I think, the subject of every matter which was debated in tL-he<br />
Cabinet this morning.<br />
Mr Barnard, has the U. S. Government cut down on the artoui-'<br />
of information that it's supplying to Australian D~ efence experts<br />
as alleg7ed5Mr Hartley and does this information also apply to<br />
information also supplied by the British Government?<br />
MR BARNARD: No.<br />
Mr Whitlam, has the Yugoslav Government been notified of<br />
what Senator Murphy is going to say in the Senate this week about<br />
Croatian terrorists? If not, will it be notified, how and when?<br />
And finally, will the Yugoslav Prime Minister be having talks<br />
on this subject when he comes to Australia? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I think it's very likely that the Yugoslav<br />
Prime Minister will refer to the acts of political terrorism<br />
which have occurred in Australia for many years past and the<br />
outrages against Yugoslav diplomatic and consular premises in<br />
Australia. We have been in touch with the Yugoslav authoritics,<br />
our Ambassador in Belgrade, and their Ambassador here about the<br />
movements of which we've been able to get some indication we<br />
can't assess how many people of Yugoslav origin who have lived<br />
in Australia have left in recent months on group tours for<br />
Europe. There have been some reports that the number involved<br />
we don't know the number involved -but that there have been<br />
some such movements has come to our notice and we have conferred<br />
in Belgrade and in Canberra about them. As I made plain in my<br />
policy speech, we are determined to do all we can to stamp out<br />
this political terrorism which has continued too long in Australia,<br />
to the discredit of Australia.<br />
I have this A. I. D. C. submission, but I think probably it'll<br />
suit you if you get it from Dr Cairns. There were two<br />
submissions and there are quite a number of recommendations, one<br />
of them has three paragraphs and another has about 10 I think.<br />
Sir, have you written to the Queensland Premier asking<br />
Queensland to hand over Queensland's Aboriginal reserves to the<br />
Federal Government? Has the Queensland Premier replied, and<br />
refused? And if he has refused, what's the next step in view of<br />
what you, through the Governor-Gdneral, said last week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have written about the reserves. I don'' C<br />
think I put it quite so directly that they should be handed over.<br />
I don't think a reply has come yet. However I will reassert what<br />
the Governor-General said in his speech that the Goverrient i* s<br />
determined to carry out the full range of responsibilities in.<br />
respect to the Aboriginal people that were given to the<br />
Australian Parliament in the 1967 Referendum. I mentioned thac'<br />
the Cabinet had authorised the drafting of legislation to cerry<br />
out the 1966 Racial Discrimination Convention. There is some<br />
legislation of the Queensland Parliament which is contrary to<br />
that Convention. I have written to the Premier of Queensland<br />
about it. I think I wrote about it in December, but I don't<br />
think he's replied.<br />
Sir, you haven't spoken to the Queensland Premier since<br />
you took office I don't think<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, he's the only missing Premier.<br />
In view of the considerable conflict which has. beea<br />
running is there any chance of you initiating talks with him<br />
picking up the phone to talk to him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There's been no difficulty in communication<br />
each way with any other Premier or, in fact, with the DeputL-y-<br />
Premier of Queensland when he has been acting Premier. For<br />
instance I don't know whether this is characteristic of the cil~ y<br />
and the last Country Party Premier in Australia, but last ~ iKy<br />
for instance, there was a very fruitful, successful conferelicc<br />
between the two Liberal Premiers, Sir Robert Askin and Mr h.~<br />
and Mr Dunstan and me the first significant variation in ' the<br />
River Murray Waters Agreement since it was first drawn up in<br />
1915. We did that last Friday morning. No difficulty whatever.<br />
I don't know what's wrong with Mr Bjelke-Petersen. </p>
<p>0 7.<br />
Prime Minister, at the last public Press Conference, Sir,<br />
we discussed the question of troops being retained in-Singapore<br />
after the withdrawal of the batallion we used the figure<br />
then of 500 to 600 troops you expected would be retained<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think in answer to questions I have said<br />
that, yes. Subsequently, Sir, you were quoted as having said at the<br />
background conference that these troops were being kept there<br />
to cover the presence of the Australian Signals Unit. Since<br />
the presence of the Australian Signals Unit is now of world<br />
knowledge, do you still intend to keep 500 to 600 troops in<br />
Singapore? PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to fcrecast the number of<br />
servicemen because it's not just soldiers involved in Singapore.<br />
The two crucial items are well known. The batallion and the<br />
battery will not be replaced when their terms expire which will<br />
be in January. Furthermore, the Defence Signals Division Unit<br />
which Australia operates in Singapore will be brought back as<br />
soon as possible. the other numbers can emerge during this<br />
year. There is no great urgency or panic about this question.<br />
If there is no urgency or panic about the question of<br />
the Defence Signals Unit, I'm not sure in my own mind why this<br />
was an off-the-record briefing which you gave when it could have<br />
been cleared up so simply and quickly by yourself, Sir, and<br />
furthermore why some people, myself and my friend Jack Fingle'Co-n,<br />
who is not perhaps a security risk and nor am I, were excluded<br />
from it, Sir? before you answer that, because my question is<br />
also along those lines<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Go ahead.<br />
I want to congratulate you on the number of Press conferencesthat<br />
you have given. You've been extremely generous with -them.<br />
Indeed I think it's true to say that already you've given more<br />
than Sir Robert Menzies, Mr Holt, Mr Gorton and Mr McMahon in<br />
twenty years. Sir Robert I might observe has done well. As my<br />
colleague, Mr Harris says, a few weeks ago you cancelled your<br />
usual Press conference and invited yourself or had invited for<br />
you a special group of journalists who mostly represent the<br />
three largest daily newspaper groups that almost monopolise th.-is<br />
Press Gallery. Excluded: Mr Harris of the London Times,<br />
myself, the A. B. C. and certain other people of news-gathering<br />
media. Now does this mean that you yourself regard us as<br />
untrustworthy, or possibly poor class journalists. As a Labor<br />
Prime Minister, I'm sure you will recognise the important<br />
industrial concept that's inherent in this. May we assume<br />
that in future press conferences we'll be invited along with<br />
the rest Mr Harris, myself and the A. B. C.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I undertook at the Last time you invited mo to<br />
the National Press Club that on any Tuesday when I was in<br />
Canberra I would have a press conference. That I have done with<br />
two exceptions. one was last Tuesday when I think it would be<br />
conceded that it would have been impracticable on the day of the<br />
Opening. The other occasion was two weeks before. On that occasion<br />
the Cabinet sat all morning. It had to sit that afternoon. I had a </p>
<p>dinner engagement at which I was to speak in Melbourne that<br />
night. I put to the Chairman of the Gallery do you want a briefing<br />
today or a press conference later in the week. He chose the<br />
briefing that day. It had to be in my office, the one which I<br />
inherited the temporary office and it is impossible, as anybody'<br />
who's been in the office would know, to have radio or. television<br />
equipment in it and accordingly the Australian newspapers were<br />
there. A record was taken and any of the other media who wanted<br />
to have the text of the record were able to get it in the usual<br />
way and many availed themselves of it.<br />
Have you yet come to the conclusion that five _ portfolios_-<br />
Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force and Supply, held individually<br />
by five Ministers in past Governments, is not too much of a<br />
burden for Mr Barnard or for any other Minister for that matter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On the contrary, I am quite satisfied that the<br />
holding of the five portfolios by one experienced senior man has<br />
made for much more prompt and satisfactory decisions. There are<br />
a host of instances that can be given of this. The Supply<br />
Department for instance was very often unable to place orders<br />
because the client Departments couldn't make up their mind. The<br />
one Minister now makes the decision. It is promptly implemented.<br />
I am satisfied that this is the best form of Defence organisat: o:<br />
that the country has had and the Mooreshead Report very largely<br />
recommended it. It will continue.<br />
As the Minister to whom the Tariff Board reports, you wo-ud<br />
be aware that the Board reported recently adversely on th3 prospocus<br />
of performance of one of the A. I. D. C.' s projects Information<br />
Electronics here. Will you have Sir John Crawford to investigate<br />
the possibility of extending the Protection Commission's optio.<br />
to cover the implicit subsidy in A. I. D. C. operations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This will be open to him to consider. I hope<br />
he does. Mr Whitlam, the 1971 Federal Conference passed a re: olu'ion<br />
protesting at the Federal Government's refusal to reveal the<br />
details and possible consequences of Pine Gap and Woomera...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: general purposes and possible consequences<br />
wasn't it? general purposes and possible consequences. Do you ta. kC<br />
that protest to apply to any Federal Government regardless of i<br />
political complexion and do you also now agree with the previouz<br />
Federal Government's decision not to reveal those general pur DCpo<br />
and possible consequences?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have said that it is not possible to reve.-<br />
any more of the purposes of Nurunga and Pine Gap than has be: en<br />
disclosed without nulifying the purpose of the Unit the<br />
facilities. I think Mr Chamberlain was next.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, will you be spending Easter in Parif;?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'd love to. But I was thinking Rome woulC. be..<br />
more appropriate. You're referring to the fact that the Fren. wh u<br />
suggested there should be consultations between France and<br />
Australia about the nuclear tests. We replied that we agreed<br />
with this and believed they should be at Ministerial level and </p>
<p>the French agreed to such discussions at Ministerial level in<br />
Paris. Now our Parliament obviously the time which would suit<br />
Ministers best to go to Paris would be in a week when the<br />
Australian Parliament is not sitting. The first such week the<br />
week after next is too soon for the French. The next weeks when<br />
the Australian Parliament is not sitting are Holy Week and Easter<br />
Week, those being the weeks before Easter Sunday and after Easter<br />
Sunday. It would probably be in one of those weeks that a<br />
minister or ministers will go to Paris. It may be that a Minister<br />
or Ministers might go in one of the intervening sitting weeks.<br />
That would be rather inconvenient for Australia but it is a<br />
matter of great concern to Australia and if the French would<br />
want to have the discussions earlier then we would be prepared<br />
to have them earlier even if it was a sitting week.<br />
There has been no discussion, still less decision as to who<br />
should go. There has been suggestion that I might go. This is<br />
by no means certain. I'd also like to say that there has been<br />
speculation that I might not go as originally proposed to the<br />
South Pacific Forum in Apia in Holy Week. I do intend to go to<br />
the South Pacific Forum in Apia in Holy week.<br />
I want to go back to the question that Wally Brown asked<br />
about Party policy. Were you saying that if there are policyz<br />
changes at-Surfers Paradise at the Conference that these would<br />
not be binding on the Government until the next elections?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What I'm saying is that I would regard it as<br />
inconceivable that the Federal Conference of the Australian<br />
Labor Party would purport to change the Party's policy during the<br />
currency of a Parliament on the election of which the policy<br />
had been placed in the form which the Conference had endorsed<br />
in 1971. I don't believe the Conference would purport to change<br />
policy in the midst of a Parliament. Of course the Party could<br />
change policy but the only proper time to do it would be for the<br />
next Parliament. The advantage of the Labor Party's procedures<br />
as far as the public is concerned, as far as the democratic<br />
process is concerned, is that they are available in print for<br />
everybody to read and we were elected on the basis of the<br />
Platform which was framed at Launceston in June 1971 and<br />
published in July or August 1971. That policy was put to the<br />
people in November 1972. The people clearly endorsed it.<br />
I don't believe that the Party Conference would purport to alter<br />
the policy on which we were elected.<br />
Given that you do not expect the Conference to change any<br />
policy while you have a Labor Parliament in power, what would be<br />
your position...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wait a bit. I don't think they'll change Party<br />
policy. What I did say is that I don't conceive the possibilitCy<br />
that the Party would change the policy for a Parliament during<br />
the lifetime of that Parliament. Now is that quite clear?<br />
I don't think it's likely that the Party will change its policy<br />
but if it does I can only conceive that it would change its<br />
policy for presentation to the people at the next elections.<br />
Given that, what if the Federal Conference orders you to<br />
implement the policy as laid down by the 1971 Conference in<br />
relation to...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PIR IMtEhMiINnIkT ERt; hat's a hyperthctical question. </p>
