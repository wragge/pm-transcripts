FOR PRESS_ P. M. No 11 / 1970<br />
COMMONWEALTH/ STATE JOINT ENQUIRY ON REEF<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Gorton today replied to a telegram which<br />
he received late on Friday from the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke -Petersen, on<br />
the subject of a Commonwealth/ State joint Enquiry into the danger of drilling<br />
on the Barrier Reef. Following is the text of Mr Gorton's reply, which was sent by<br />
telegram this morning: III HAVE YOUR TELEGRAM OF 16 JANUARY CONCERNING THE<br />
SUGGESTED COMMONWEALTH/ STATE JOINT ENQUIRY INTO POSSIBLE DANGERS<br />
TO THE REEF AS A RESULT OF DRILLING FOR OIL ON OR NEAR IT.<br />
I SEE NO NEED FOR THIS PROPOSAL TO BE CONFUSED WITH<br />
YOUR GOVERNMENT'S COMMUNICATION TO ME OF JUNE 1968.<br />
THAT COMMUNICATION INFORMED ME OF YOUR GOVE RNMENT'S<br />
INTENTION TO SET UP A COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE A NUMBER OF BROAD<br />
MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REEF AREA<br />
AND TO REPORT TO YOUR GOVERNMENT.<br />
IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH MIGHT<br />
APPOINT ONE MEMBER TO THE ELEVEN MAN COMMITTEE ENVISAGED.<br />
THAT SUGGESTION DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE IN FACT<br />
A JOINT COMMONWEALTH/ STATE ENQUIRY NOR IS IT SPECIFICALLY<br />
CONCERNED WITH DRILLING FOR OIL ON THE REEF. I BELIEVE<br />
THEREFORE THAT AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED IT SHOULD BE LEFT<br />
IN ABE YANCE AT PRESENT.<br />
THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US NOW IS THAT DRILLING BE<br />
SUSPENDED ON OR NEAR THE REEF PENDING A TRULY JOINT<br />
COMMONWEALTH/ STATE ENQUIRY WHICH WILL REPORT TO BOTH OUR<br />
GOVERNMENTS AND WHICH WILL MAKE PUBLIC ITS REPORTS.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH IS PREPARED TO ENDORSE THIS<br />
SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AND I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WILL LET ME KNOW<br />
WHETHER THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT IS ALSO PREPARED TO DO<br />
so. </p>
<p>IF THE-QUEENSLAND GOVERNMEN1T IS PREPARED TO DO<br />
SO I SUGGEST THAT* DISCUSSIONS MIGHT BEGIN ON THE SIZE OF THE<br />
COMMITTEE, THE NUMBERS OF COMMITTEE MEN TO BE APPOINTED<br />
BY EACH GOVERNMENT, THE INTERESTS TO BE REPRESENTED, THE<br />
DATE OF COMMENCEMENT, AND SIMILAR MATTERS.<br />
I WOULD BE GLAD OF YOUR EARLY ADVICE."<br />
Following is the text of Mr Bjelke-Petersen's telegram, received<br />
on Friday: " I HAVE YOUR TELEGRAM OF YESTERDAY CONCERNING<br />
AMPOL EXPLORATIONS SUGGESTED OIL DRILLING ENQUIRY AND HAVE<br />
NOTED THE TERMS 0I9 YOUR OFFER TO MR LEONARD. IN SO FAR AS<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED A BASICALLY SIMILAR BUT WIDER<br />
PROPOSITION REGARDING DRILLING ON THE BARRIER REEF WAS<br />
PREVIOUSLY PUT BEFORE YOU IN MY PREDECESSOR'S LETTER OF<br />
7TH JUNE 1968 TO WHICH A DETAILED REPLY IS STILL AWAITED.<br />
THE PROPOSALS THEN MADE AND THE SUPPORTING INFORMATION<br />
GIVEN WERE AND STILL ARE PERTINENT TO THE QUESTION OF REEF<br />
DRILLING AND THEREFORE I SEE NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD NOT<br />
APPROPRIATELY PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR ANY JOINT COMMONWEALTH,<br />
STATE INVESTIGATION NOW. CONSEQUENTLY i( OU WILL APPRECIATE<br />
THAT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS YOU FURNISH ME WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT'S<br />
VIEWS ON OUR PROPOSAL OF 7TH JUNE 1968 OR ANY ALTERNATIVE YOU<br />
MAY CARE TO ADVANCE I WOULD NATURALLY PREFER TO DEFER<br />
A DECISION ON YOUR TELEGRAM OF YESTERDAY DATE."<br />
