VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY CHANCELLOR KOHL<br />
The Chancellor of Germany, Dr Helmut Kohl, will visit Australia from 2 to<br />
7 May. The Chancellor will be a most welcome guest.<br />
Chancellor Kohl's leadership and vision have played a crucial role in<br />
shaping the momentous developments in Germany and Europe during the<br />
past decade.<br />
Australia's close and extensive relations with Germany have long had a<br />
strong personal foundation since many Germans settled in Australia last<br />
century. The Chancellor's visit is a valuable opportunity to reaffirm die importance<br />
of the relationship between our countries and our shared commaitment to<br />
expanding our ties.<br />
I also look forward to discussing with the Chancellor the scope for<br />
cooperation between Australia and Germany in pursuing our economic<br />
interests in the Asia-Pacific and in Europe.<br />
Dr Kohl will visit Canberra, Sydney and Port Douglas. He will be<br />
accompanied by a delegation of ministers, parliamentarians and business<br />
leaders. April 1997 </p>
