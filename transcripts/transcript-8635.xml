PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
FAREWELL RECEPTION FOR PROFESSOR SLATYER<br />
26 AUGUST 1992<br />
Professor and Mrs Slatyer, Ministerial Colleagues,<br />
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Thank you all for joining Annita and myself tonight, to<br />
farewell Ralph Slatyer and afford him the recognition he<br />
deserves as he steps down from the position of Chief<br />
Scientist. I might say that for one so used to being among<br />
practitioners of the dismal science, it's a pleasure to<br />
be among exponents of the real thing.<br />
In fact I've spent a decade attempting to push Australia<br />
in the direction of innovation, manufacturing, creatingmaking<br />
things. Using our brains.<br />
It's always seemed to me that in the end this is the best<br />
measure of how far we have come. How civilised we are.<br />
Both in his role as Chairman of ASTEC from 1982-198.7 and<br />
then as Chief Scientist since 1989, Ralph Slatyer has<br />
been a pivotal figure in providing advice on-cee and<br />
technology matters to the Government.<br />
There have been enormous changes in this period.<br />
Industrial R&amp; D in Australia has had one of the fastest<br />
' rates ofi growth of all OECD countries, and attitudes in<br />
the business community to technology and innovation are<br />
changing rapidly.<br />
The universities are now increasingly involved with the<br />
employers of their students and the users of their<br />
science and technology.<br />
The Government research agencies have developed strong<br />
links with indusiitry and other users of their research.<br />
There is a new spirit of cooperation between researchers,<br />
and with research users.<br />
Ralph Slatyer has been a key player in all of this.<br />
1580 </p>
<p>I might say that the Government itself has been extremely<br />
active. The recently released White Paper on Science and<br />
Technology, called Developing Au~ trali an Id-Cass A<br />
Blupfroinr theI is eience of7 our commitment to<br />
the crucial role which science and technology can and<br />
must play in shaping the future of Australia.<br />
our belief in this was further emphasised by the decision<br />
in the Budget to make the 150 per cent tax concession for<br />
research and development a permanent feature of the tax<br />
system.<br />
So too, the establishment of the Cooperative Research<br />
Centres Program testifies to the Government's<br />
determination to strengthen our science and technology<br />
system and capture its benefits in Australia.<br />
Ralph Slatyer, of course, was involved in the creation of<br />
this program.<br />
He has also established the Prime Minister's Science and<br />
Engineering Council and guided it successfully through<br />
the early years to become a major national forum.<br />
All of his work has been characterised by imagination,<br />
professionalism and pragmatism. He has a flair for<br />
creating mechanisms that work in practice.<br />
At the same time Ralph has made important philosophical<br />
contributions to our thinking on the roles of public and<br />
private institutions in building a technologically<br />
innovative and internationally-oriented Australia.<br />
He has been a capable leader and coordinator.<br />
He has been, first and foremost, an Australian determined<br />
to help his country build its place in the world.<br />
For over twenty years he has given exemplary service to<br />
Australian governments of different political<br />
persuasions. At the national level he has also been a leader in<br />
developing environmental policy and in formulating<br />
practical programs for ecologically sustainable<br />
development. He has managed the not inconsiderable feat of gaining the<br />
respect of both the conservation movement and the major<br />
resource based industries.<br />
At the international level, he was President of two<br />
important intergovernmental environmental programs where<br />
Australia has been influential in determining their<br />
character and effectiveness. 1581 </p>
<p>He was also President of the International Council of<br />
Scientific Unions, as well as being involved in one of<br />
its important non-governmental environmental programs.<br />
To do all this in addition to his full time and part time<br />
commitments in Australia, both to the Government and to<br />
the Australian National University, is remarkable.<br />
Not surprisingly, Ralph has high standing in the science<br />
and technology community. His research career led to his<br />
election at an early age to the Australian Academy of<br />
Science, and then to the Royal Society of London and the<br />
United States National Academy of Sciences.<br />
He is one of a very small number of scientists who have<br />
been elected to both these famous national academies.<br />
In closing let me just say that I have mentioned only<br />
some of the highlights of Ralph Slatyer's distinguished<br />
career and its outstanding value to the government. I<br />
know there is much more to be told.<br />
Ralph, your work has brought great credit to yourself, to<br />
the institutions with which you have been associated, and<br />
to your country.<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I<br />
congratulate and thank you and extend to you and June<br />
every best wish for the future.<br />
