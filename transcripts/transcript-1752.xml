TARIFF CHANGES ON TEXTILES AND SOUYD RECORDERS AND REPRODUCERS<br />
( Statement by the Prime Minister and Minister for Trade<br />
and Industry, Mr. J. Mc~ wen)<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry,<br />
Mr. J. McEwen, announced today that the Government has adopted<br />
reports by the Tariff Board on textiles and on sound recorders<br />
and reproducers. Mr. McEwen said the reports on textiles represented the<br />
conclusion of the General Textile Reference made on 5th October,<br />
1960. The reports covered a wide variety of textiles which had not<br />
been included in the earlier interim reports on this reference.<br />
The Government had adopted the Tariff Board's recommendations<br />
subject to some minor variations which were necessary to<br />
comply with Australia's international commitments. On felts for<br />
paper making machines, for example, increased duties recommended<br />
by the Board would not be brought into effect until current<br />
international tuariff negotiations have been. completed.<br />
The Prime Minister stated that the new duties would<br />
simplify areas of the Tariff which had not been reviewed in recent<br />
years. Some of the more important changes were consolidation of<br />
the duties of fabrics coated with P. V. C. and cellulose derivatives<br />
at the levels of the combined present ordinary and temporary duties;<br />
increased duties on certain monofil and strip of synthetic resin;<br />
increased duties on certain elastic and elastomeric fabrics. Reduced<br />
duties would apply to a wide range of the textiles covered by the<br />
report. The present quantitative restrictions on imports of twine,<br />
cordage and rope of polyethylene would be continued until 31st<br />
December, 1968, and would be extended to cover similar products made<br />
from polypropylene. Mr. McEwen also announced that the Government had adopted<br />
the Tariff Board's recommendations on sound recorders and repr-oducers.<br />
Duties of 45% ( General) and 32421 ( Preferential) would apply to most<br />
recorders and reproducers of the types made locally. The present<br />
duties on tape recorders will not be varied but the general rate<br />
e./ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
of duty on record players will be reduced from the present level<br />
of 60% ad valorem. Other changes include reduction of the duties<br />
on gramophone records to 7o ( General) Free ( Preferential) and<br />
increased protection for certain grades of magnetic tape.<br />
Mr. McEwen added that details of the new duties,<br />
which would apply after the close of business today, had been<br />
published in the Commonwealth Gazette. Copies of the Tariff<br />
Board's reports and the duty changes are available from Collectors<br />
of Customs in all States and from the Office of Secondary Industry,<br />
Department of Trade and Industry, Canberra.<br />
