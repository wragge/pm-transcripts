THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS 8 JUL 96B3<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
As some Premiers requested that the financial assistance grants<br />
arrangements be listed for discussion at this Conference, I think it would be<br />
useful if I were to say two things:<br />
* First, to indicate by how much these grants are likely to grow next year<br />
under the formula agreed between us three years ago; and<br />
* Secondly, to indicate the Australian Government's attitude towards any<br />
suggestion that we should change the five-year agreement to which we<br />
have all subscribed and which obtains until 30 June, 1970.<br />
Formula Grants for 1968-69<br />
In the present financial year we now know that the agreed formula<br />
provided the States with grants amounting to $ 907, 539, 000. This was<br />
5 million more than the amounts estimated a year ago and included in the<br />
budgets of both the Commonwealth and the States. As compared with the grants<br />
paid in 1966-67 the formula produced an increase this year of approximately<br />
$ 81 million. The formula for determining the grant to each State next year,<br />
that is 1968/ 69, will take account of the estimated rise in average wages in the<br />
twelve months to 31 March 1969 and the increase in each State's population<br />
during the calendar year 1968 while the grants so produced will be increased<br />
by a betterment factor of 1. 2 per cent.<br />
It is not possible at this stage to make a reliable estimate of the<br />
future movement in average wages. Nevertheless, for purposes of planning our<br />
budgets we need to make an estimate of the grants and for this particular purpose<br />
we have calculated the effects of an increase of 5. 5 per cent in average wages<br />
in the twelve months to the end of next March. On this basis, and with he added<br />
assumption that the increase in each State's population will be the same * in 1968<br />
as it was in 1967, the grants payable to the States in 1969 will be about<br />
$ 989 million, or $ 82 million more than in the year just ending. If the increase<br />
in average wages proved to be 6 per cent, the grant would amount to about<br />
$ 994 million; if the rise in average wages were as great as 6-1 per cent, the<br />
grants would be about 1, -300 million. I mention these latter figures to illustrate<br />
a broad range of possibilities.<br />
For purposes of our discussion, I suggest that we use the estimate<br />
of $ 989 million as the prospective amount of the grants next year. This would<br />
represent an increase of about $ 82 million or 9 per cent as compared with<br />
the formula grants paid in the present financial year. I am circulating a table<br />
giving details of these figures for each State.<br />
Commonwealth's Attitude to Revisions of Formula<br />
" The Commonwealth's general attitude towards the formula grant<br />
arrangements themselves is that we wish the agreement made<br />
between us and the States to be kept. The present formula grant<br />
arrangements are designed to operate for a period of five years<br />
as from 1 July 1965 and they therefore do not come up for review<br />
until 1973. It is fair to say that, from the States' standpoint, the present<br />
agreement represents a great improvement on the arrangements which operated<br />
prior to 1965. When the grants were reviewed at the Premiers' Conference in<br />
June 1965, two main improvements were effected in the grants formula namely,<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
a trebling of the betterment factor and a reduction in the time lag before changes<br />
in population were reflected in the grants. At that Conference, a special<br />
addition of 2 million was made to Victoria's formula grant for 1965-66<br />
resulting in further increases in subsequent years and it was agreed to increase<br />
Queensland's share of the grants by adding 0 million to the amount on which<br />
Queensland's grant for each of the five years of the arrangements would be<br />
calculated, In 1967, two further concessions were made by the Commonwealth<br />
in the grants arrangements an amount of $ 5 million was added to the grants<br />
on which the formula operates and arrangements were made to reduce the time<br />
lag before increases in wages are reflected in the grants. This latter revision<br />
gave effect-to a proposal which the Commonwealth had advanced at the June<br />
1965 Premiers' Conference as being desirable but which the States preferred<br />
not to agree to at that time.<br />
As a result of these changes, the grants formula has now been<br />
improved to the point where it virtually ensures that the grants to the States<br />
will increase at a faster rate than Gross National Product. It is, I think, alsd<br />
worth pointing out that, under the present formula, the grants not only rise in<br />
proportion to increases in the two main factors causing increases in State<br />
expenditures rises, in the wage costs and increases in population but also<br />
provide an element for improvement of standards of State services, nan-ely,<br />
a betterment factor which increases the grants by 1. 2 per cent each year.<br />
We recognise that, even under the improved grants formula,<br />
these grants have not been growing quite as fast as the growth in State<br />
expenditures desired by the States. Clearly, however, the Commonwealth<br />
could not undertake a commitment to underwrite any rate of growth by which<br />
State Governments might decide to increase their expenditures. This is<br />
particularly true at a time when the Commonwealth's commitments in other<br />
fields particularly defence have been increasing at a rapid rate. Nor should<br />
we overlook the assistance which the Commonwealth has been providing in other<br />
directions to the States. Commonwealth assistance in such fields as education,<br />
roads and railways has been increasing at a rapid rate. In fact, in recent<br />
years, total Commonwealth assistance to the States has been increasing at a<br />
faster rate than Gross National Product and it has also been absorbing an<br />
increasing share of Commonwealth tax revenues.<br />
In this regard, in addition to the formula revenue grants to the<br />
States, specific purpose capital payments to the States, about which the<br />
Treasurer will have something to say in more detail at the Loan Council,<br />
have also been increasing. For the moment, it is sufficient for me to, say<br />
that these additional payments to the States are expected to increase next<br />
year to $ 330 million, equivalent to an increase of 20 per cent on the payments<br />
of $ 275 million this year.<br />
It is sometimes suggested that the revenue grants should increase<br />
at the same rate as what is described as the " natural" growth in Commonwealth<br />
income tax collections. It has also been suggested that this natural growth<br />
of income tax collections is in the region of 10 per cent per annum. Between<br />
1959-60 and 1966-67 Commonwealth income tax collections did, in fact,<br />
increase by 10 per cent per annum. That increase, however, reflected a<br />
significant effective increase in tax rates. In actual fact, there is no clearly<br />
definable " natural" growth rate of Commonwealth income tax collections and,<br />
by choosing different periods, different answers can be produced. Between<br />
1956-57 and 1966-67, for instance, the average rate of growth of<br />
Commonwealth income tax collections was only about 8 per cent per annum.<br />
In short, our attitude is that requests for variations in the<br />
agreement reached between us on the grants formula can not<br />
be considered until the present arrangements come up for<br />
review in the course of 1969-70. Clearly, there would be / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
little point in having arrangements which were agreed to<br />
run for a certain period of time if such arrangements were<br />
to be altered, or be subject to review, every year."<br />
Action to meet Special Difficulties<br />
At the same time, the Commonwealth is always ready to consider<br />
making assistance available outside the formula grant arrangements if any State<br />
is faced with serious financial difficulties arising from circumstances beyond its<br />
control. I illustrate this fact by referring to the assistance which the<br />
Commonwealth has provided to help those States who have been facing major<br />
problems arising from the recent drought. Over the last three years, the<br />
Commonwealth has provided about $ 84 million for this purpose.<br />
The Commonwealth has been helping in two ways. First, we have<br />
made available over the last two years special revenue assistance amounting to<br />
about $ 25 million to help offset the effects of the drought on the revenues of the<br />
States concerned. ( This year, such assistance amounted to $ 14 million.) We<br />
have also been meeting virtually the whole cost of the drought relief measures<br />
which have been instituted to help farmers and to provide employment grants in<br />
the drought areas. We have done this in co-operation with the States.<br />
Commonwealth reimbursements to the States in respect of these relief measures<br />
have amounted over the past three years to nearly $ 60 million of which<br />
approximately $ 23 million has been expended in the current financial year. These<br />
relief measures will co. tinue for a period in 1968-69, and as there will also be<br />
large claims arising from commitments made in 1967-68, our reimbursements<br />
to the States next year will again be substantial.<br />
General I conclude on this note. These days, all Governments<br />
Commonwealth and State are faced with heavy commitments and with increasing<br />
demands for the provision of Government services. I appreciate that the State<br />
Governments are called upon to discharge important responsibilities. But I am<br />
sure that the Premiers will appreciate that the Commonwealth, in its approach to<br />
the problems we are discussing today, must also consider very carefully its own<br />
national responsibilities. In saying this, I am not referring simply to our<br />
increasing defence c: ommitments though these are important enough in<br />
themselves. I am refer; rng also to much wider responsibilities for the economic<br />
health of the nation. We must keep the Australian economy moving strongly but<br />
not unhealthily ahead, we must maintain a sound external financial position in<br />
these unsettied times and we must avoid inflationary conditions which could<br />
undermine our efforts in all these directions.<br />
