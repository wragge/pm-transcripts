PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATETJENT NO.<br />
December 1972<br />
TAAR RIVER SEWERAGE CONTROL<br />
The new Australian Government today took its first<br />
step against pollution by approving a grant to help clean up<br />
the Tamar River at Launceston.<br />
The Government decided to give $ 300,000 in the current<br />
financial year towards the cost of the first stage of a treatment<br />
plant for Launceston sewerage.<br />
The Senate Select Conmmittee on Water Pollution in 1970<br />
singled out Tamar River pollution for mention in its report.<br />
The committee said " Raw effluent is discharged into<br />
the Tamar River, a practice which was aptly described by the Port<br />
Mdanager and Port Engineer, Port of Launceston Authority, Mr.<br />
J. K. Edwards, as ' primitive, obnoxious and beneath the standards<br />
acceptable to any present day community'."<br />
The Premier of Tasmania, Mr. Reece, sought the grant<br />
today during talks in Canberra with the Prime Mlinister, r lr. Whitlam,<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister, Mdr. Barnard, and Mr. Frank Crean, M. P.<br />
He sought the grant to enable the Launceston Corporation<br />
to proceed with the construction of a plant which would provide<br />
both primary and secondary treatment facilities.<br />
This would enable the pollution load in the Tamar River<br />
to be reduced to a level which was acceptable from a public health<br />
and environmental point of view.<br />
The Commonwealth grant indicates the new Government's<br />
desire to overcome pollution problems of the type being<br />
experienced in the Tamar River.<br />
