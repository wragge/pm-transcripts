PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 JUNE 1990<br />
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will visit<br />
Australia from 22-24 June 1990 as a guest of the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
This will be the first Mexican Presidential visit to<br />
Australia, the main purpose of which is to promote<br />
bilateral trade and investment. President Salinas will<br />
also discuss political and economic developments in the<br />
Pacific and multilateral issues such as disarmament when<br />
he meets with me and other Government Ministers in<br />
Canberra on 22 June. The President is scheduled to meet<br />
with business leaders in Sydney on 23 June.<br />
While Australia-Mexico trade is currently valued at<br />
around $ 137 million a year, the recent liberalisation of<br />
the Mexican economy provides opportunities for enhanced<br />
trade. Australia has had cordial and constructive relations with<br />
Mexico since the establishment of diplomatic relations in<br />
1966. I welcome President Salinas' visit as an<br />
opportunity to strengthen further the relationship and to<br />
enhance bilateral economic links.<br />
