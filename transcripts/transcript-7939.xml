PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, RICHMOND BRIDGE, HOBART<br />
MARCH 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Today we are witnessing yet another piece of<br />
dramatic evidence of the commitment of the Liberal and<br />
National Party coalition to ensuring that those who are<br />
already most privileged in this society should have that<br />
privilege further entrenched. The policies that they've<br />
announced in regard to child rebates and child care<br />
rebates mean very simply that there is no targeting in<br />
terms of need. Those who are already best off in the<br />
community will do best out of their proposals. This is<br />
consistent with their whole approach to government.<br />
You've seen it in regard to capital gains tax, that<br />
they'll put billions of dollars into the pockets of less<br />
than one per cent of the richest in the community. The<br />
whole approach in regard to capital gains tax, education,<br />
superannuation and now in regard to children. It is an<br />
obscenity that scarce resources should be wasted upon the<br />
highest income people in the community without any<br />
targeting to those in need and that those of us in the<br />
community who are already the best off should do best<br />
under their proposed policies. Further it is quite clear<br />
that the policies announced will create no new places<br />
and, further, that it will be open to rorting. It is a<br />
situation which will lead to a nightmare of<br />
administration and has already properly been condemned by<br />
those in the community who are most knowledgeable in this<br />
area. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one of the key themes of the<br />
Opposition leader today is ' a vote for Labor is a vote<br />
for more of the same, that there'll be no change, that<br />
the status quo will remain'. Isn't this one of the<br />
toughest arguments that they've got to throw at you?<br />
PM: If that's the best argument then you're going to see<br />
me walking around for the next three weeks with a large<br />
smile on my face. The answer is in two parts. It is one<br />
of the few statements made by Mr Peacock which has some<br />
accuracy in it. It is accurate that you will have more<br />
of the same in that under my Government there has been<br />
the creation of 1.6 million new jobs. And I remind Mr<br />
Peacock that that's a rate of job creation five times<br />
faster than in the seven years of their government. And<br />
it is true that there will be more of the same, that we<br />
will continue to create jobs significantly faster than<br />
jot </p>
<p>could possibly happen under their policy. So he's right.<br />
He's also right that there'll be more of the same in that<br />
Medicare will be maintained so that in this country every<br />
person will be covered, so that there will universality<br />
and fairness in regard to Medicare. He is right in that<br />
respect, that we will maintain and save Medicare against<br />
the proposed demolition of it by them. He's also right<br />
in saying that there'll be more of the same in regard to<br />
education. I remind Mr Peacock that under their seven<br />
years they did nothing to lift the rate at which kids<br />
stay in school. I've doubled it. There's two out of<br />
three of the kids staying on because we have applied<br />
funds to those in the community, the lower and the lower<br />
to middle income areas, so that their kids can stay on in<br />
the education system. He's right in that respect. He's<br />
also right that there'll be more of the same in regard to<br />
the taxation system. That is when they walked out of<br />
office the top tax rate was 60 cents in the dollar and<br />
the bottom rate 30 cents in the dollar. Under my<br />
Government it's been reduced to 47 and 21. How has that<br />
happened? It's happened because I brought to an end the<br />
disgrace which was the taxation system under Peacock and<br />
Howard and Fraser. A system which was described by their<br />
own Royal Commissioner as being a country where the<br />
fastest growing industry was the tax avoidance industry.<br />
A country with a tax system which was described by<br />
Professor Russell Matthews as a country in which it had<br />
become increasingly a matter of choice as to whether the<br />
rich paid their tax. So he is right. There'll be more<br />
of the same. The closing of the-tax rorts which they<br />
allowed to flourish. There will not be the situation<br />
which he promises, that is of a reversion to the past<br />
where billions of dollars were passed to the wealthy out<br />
of the pockets of those who need it by way of increased<br />
expenditure for education and health which we have used,<br />
the money that we get from the capital gains tax, is used<br />
for the benefit of a great mass of Australian people. So<br />
you can see, yes he is right in very many respects that<br />
0 there will be a continuation of the same, that is to<br />
economic growth, employment growth and a fair system in<br />
which government is used in the interests of all<br />
Australians rather than to prop up the privilege of the<br />
few. A second thing to say about his statement is that<br />
we have created, and are creating in cooperation with the<br />
Australian people, the basis for a prosperous future for<br />
Australia. We inherited an Australia which was inwardlooking,<br />
where manufacturing industry was diminishing,<br />
where employment was declining in manufacturing. I<br />
inherited an Australia in which after seven years of<br />
conservatism the steel industry of Australia was going to<br />
be closed down. Now, under my Government we've created a<br />
situation where not only have we saved the steel industry<br />
but it is now growing in terms of its exports all around<br />
the world. We now have created the basis for the future<br />
where exports are going to grow, where we will have a<br />
more competitive Australian economy. We've also created<br />
a situation where we'll be tackling, for the future, the<br />
debt problem by extending superannuation right through </p>
<p>the population. That will be relevant to the needs of<br />
individuals. It will be relevant to the savings and debt<br />
situation of Australia. At the end of their period we<br />
had an Australia which was uncompetitive. Now we have<br />
these things. The highest investment surge in Australian<br />
history the highest investment surge in Australia's<br />
history, more people in work and more people being better<br />
trained. These are the building blocks for a future<br />
competitive Australian industry and Australian economy in<br />
which there'll be more jobs, more secure jobs and better<br />
trained Australians.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the environment Mr Hawke, Senator<br />
Richardson has estimated that about 20% of voters could<br />
leave the major parties for the green candidates. Given<br />
your speech yesterday, what's your estimate?<br />
PM: I don't pretend to know the figures. All I can say<br />
is I've read the various analyses and polls that have<br />
been done and they do seem to have a common feature, that<br />
the green candidates, independent candidates will<br />
probably have a higher vote than they've had before. My<br />
point yesterday is simply this, that for those in the<br />
community whose first concern is the environment, they<br />
simply then have to ask themselves the only important<br />
question " If my concern, my primary concern is the<br />
environment, which of the two parties which will form<br />
government that is Labor or the coalition which has<br />
the best record on the environment?" The answer to that<br />
question is simple. As I've said before, I repeat it<br />
again, the Franklin in this state of Tasmania runs free<br />
because of Hawke and Labor. The Liberals would have<br />
dammed the Franklin. The Daintree Rainforests are not<br />
logged because of Hawke and Labor. They would be logged,<br />
would've been logged and continued to be logged under the<br />
Liberals and the Nationals. Kakadu is not mined because<br />
of Hawke and Labor. It would be mined under Liberals and<br />
the National Party. The tall forests of Tasmania have<br />
been saved because of Hawke and Labor. They would be<br />
felled under the Liberals and National Party. So that is<br />
the question. Whatever the number of people is that is<br />
going to vote 1 on environment, they must give their<br />
second and determinative preference vote to Labor.<br />
JOURNALIST: Further on the environment, will the Labor<br />
Party's three uranium mines policy be maintained<br />
throughout your fourth term?<br />
PM: I would believe so. We've got a position of course<br />
where the Party is looking at the whole question.<br />
But from what I can gather, the economic situation is<br />
that there wouldn't, it wouldn't make sense to go beyond<br />
that. It is proper that I should say we've got to get<br />
the report of the committee, but that's the inclination I<br />
have, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the future for Medicare under your<br />
Government? What's going to happen to the levy? </p>
<p>PM: The Medicare levy will not be increased in the life<br />
of the next government. It's been made clear by Dr<br />
Blewett. As you'll appreciate, the forward estimates<br />
cover the projected ongoing costs of Medicare. The<br />
position for the voters of Australia in regard to their<br />
health care is crystal clear. You have a government<br />
which has instituted a system which is both universal<br />
every Australian is covered and it is fair because<br />
people like the Prime Minister on high salaries and Peter<br />
Harvey on a reasonably good salary Peter, we pay more, as<br />
we should, so that all Australians are covered. Against<br />
that you don't have to rely on my own words. Let me<br />
quote the immortal words indelibly imprinted on the mind<br />
of every concerned Australian of the shadow minister for<br />
health, Mr Shack, and he said the Liberals and the<br />
National Parties do not have a particularly good track<br />
record on health and I do not need, he said, to remind<br />
you of our record in government. One thing in this<br />
S campaign, in the pre-campaign period which the Liberals<br />
have got absolutely right. Their record is appalling.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock's talked about relaxing Loans<br />
Council limits on the States for infrastructure projects.<br />
Would you support relaxation of the Loans Council limit?<br />
PM: If we had a proposal before us which could be<br />
regarded as relevant and targeted for a particular issue<br />
we'd be prepared to look at it. But Mr Peacock's problem<br />
goes far beyond that. I understand that he is making<br />
available the princely sum of $ 3 million for cleaning up<br />
beaches and rivers. That's for the whole of Australia<br />
$ 3 million. I'm told this morning that the estimate here<br />
in Tasmania by the authorities is that for cleaning up<br />
the Derwent alone, the River Derwent would cost $ 52<br />
million. $ 3 million is pretty irrelevant isn't it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given that the environment is a big issue<br />
and you do have these concerns about independent or green<br />
candidates, is there anything more that you're able to<br />
announce in that area?<br />
PM: We'll be making an environmental statement later.<br />
There'll be references in the policy speech and perhaps<br />
some other comments. But I'll just make two points.<br />
One, that is that there'll be more things to be said and<br />
I will be saying them before the campaign is over.<br />
Secondly, the choice couldn't be starker and clearer.<br />
The point is that you've got to test parties on issues<br />
for the future on the basis of what they've done in the<br />
past. I remind you and all the people of Australia that<br />
on every fundamental decision that we've taken to protect<br />
the environmental future of Australia, we have been<br />
totally opposed by the Liberals and National Party. The<br />
second thing of course is to say this. That even if some<br />
sections of the Liberal Party, and I concede that there'd<br />
be some elements of a very divided Liberal Party, there'd<br />
be some elements of the Liberal Party which would have a </p>
<p>reasonably enlightened view in regard to matters<br />
environmental. But the realities are of Australian<br />
political life that on all issues, and particularly<br />
environmental issues, the National Party tail wags the<br />
coalition dog. People who are concerned with the<br />
environment have got to realise what it would be the<br />
National Party who would be laying down the law for the<br />
coalition on these issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your Government paid out $ 26 million in a<br />
grant to buy the Abel Tasman passenger ferry in 1984.<br />
Are you prepared to commit your Government to a future<br />
financial involvement of cross-sharing in<br />
PM: I've indicated that when we're returned after the<br />
24th that we are prepared to discuss these matters with<br />
the Tasmanian government. I have a record in regard to<br />
Tasmania which is, I think, second to none in terms of my<br />
personal commitment to Tasmania. And as I said when I<br />
was down here the other day launching the Tasmanian<br />
package, that was not just something done in an election<br />
campaign. From day one of my Government, the night of<br />
the 5th of March, I said when Tasmania wiped the slate<br />
clean of Labor Representatives in the House, I said ok,<br />
that's happened, but I'm here to govern for Tasmania.<br />
I've delivered and more than delivered on every promise I<br />
made to Tasmania in regard to the Franklin and on every<br />
Land Council I ' ye gone beyond what the recommendations<br />
were to take account of what I see as the special needs<br />
of Tasmania. So the package that I delivered here a week<br />
ago is in I would point out, as the Premier is<br />
concerned, that every single Tasmanian ought to be scared<br />
mindless of the Liberal and National Party policies in<br />
this campaign, because it represents a cut to Tasmania of<br />
about $ 62.5 million. That's what their proposals mean<br />
both in terms of the loss to individual Tasmanians and to<br />
the State through the cutting of programs of their<br />
policies. Every Tasmanian before they go into that<br />
ballot box on the 24th of March should know that the<br />
contrast couldn't be starker. Prime Minister Hawke<br />
consistent with what he's done in the seven years, he's<br />
come up with an additional package now, positive increase<br />
in funds for Tasmania. The alternative, a slashing by<br />
$ 62.5 million if the Liberals and National Party were to<br />
form a government.<br />
JOURNALIST: How many seats do you think you'll pick up<br />
in Tasmania Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I'm looking hopefully at all of them, at all of<br />
them. Because in light of just what I've said, really,<br />
what Tasmanian concerned for himself or herself or their<br />
kids, could possibly vote for a coalition which is<br />
promising to slash $ 62.5 million off Tasmania. So I<br />
believe that the appeal of Labor against our opponents is<br />
going to be strong in every electorate.<br />
JOURNALIST: One seat, two seats? </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: I would like to get the five.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the economy facing a rise in unemployment<br />
as a result of the economy contracting?<br />
PM: No not a rise in unemployment. I believe that what<br />
we're going to see, and what we are seeing, is a slowing<br />
down of the economy. But you can have a situation where<br />
you can have a slowing down in growth without necessarily<br />
a rise in unemployment. What you've got to remember is<br />
that part of the economic management of this country<br />
under my Prime Ministership and our Government, has been,<br />
as I've said, this massive employment increase. I just<br />
want you to understand the implications of that and how<br />
it's made up. That's 1.6 million new jobs. And as I've<br />
said, that's five times faster than before, it's twice as<br />
fast as the rest of the world. It's been associated with<br />
an enormous increase in the participation rate. The<br />
participation rate is at its highest level ever. And in<br />
fact, just note this statistic. If in fact the<br />
participation rate today was the same as when I came to<br />
office, the unemployment rate would be That's a<br />
foundationally important statistic to have in your mind.<br />
If you had the participation rate of when I came to<br />
office the unemployment rate would be So what<br />
you're looking at is a slowing down of the economy<br />
deliberately engineered because we were operating at too<br />
high a level and bringing in too many imports. We've got<br />
to slow it down somewhat so that we can deal with the<br />
external account problem. But we will still have<br />
economic growth and still have employment growth.<br />
JOURNALIST: keep the unemployment rate around that<br />
six per cent mark then?<br />
PM: That's what we would be aiming at, about that order.<br />
JOURNALIST: The seventh anniversary today, any<br />
celebration planned or anything like that?<br />
PM: I couldn't think of a more idyllic place in which to<br />
be celebrating it. I've put my movements, if you like,<br />
and my holidays where my mouth is. Within the last three<br />
years twice I've come down at Christmas time at the end<br />
of a hectic parliamentary session to have a few days in<br />
Tasmania, because there's something very special about<br />
Tasmania as far as I'm concerned. People say well<br />
y'know, you haven't got the industry and so on that<br />
you've got in the mainland. That's true but the things<br />
that you have got here are fantastic. We've got to do<br />
our best to make sure that they are preserved, like this<br />
magnificent bridge in the background. We've got to see<br />
that that's protected. I like Tasmania. It's a good<br />
place to be on the seventh anniversary. And whereas seven<br />
years ago Tasmanians, because they were misled about the<br />
Franklin you remember they were told then by the<br />
Opposition and they were told by the Hydro-Electric </p>
<p>7<br />
Commission here that if you didn't dam the Franklin<br />
Tasmania wouldn't have the power needs that are required.<br />
The people of Tasmania were misled. It's been conceded<br />
since that that was not right. But we lost five seats<br />
then. So I'm here now seven years later and I hope it's<br />
on the edge of keeping of course the one we've got and<br />
getting the other four. That would be the best<br />
celebration I could have, post-dated for the 24th.<br />
JOURNALIST: government has written to your Transport<br />
Minister expressing concern that Tasmania would be worse<br />
off and suffering after deregulation because of lack of<br />
flights and services and higher air fares. What can you<br />
say to alleviate those concerns?<br />
PM: Yes. We have made it clear that we believe that the<br />
continuation of the two airline policy was something<br />
which was against the interests of Australia. I don't<br />
think there's anyone really can argue about that. It's<br />
been a matter of fascination for me that I'm supposed to<br />
be the man who looks after Sir Peter Abeles. Sir Peter<br />
Abeles and Ansett of course had a very cosy situation<br />
with the two airline policy. I've kicked the props from<br />
under that, as should happen. Now, I have said also that<br />
we will be monitoring the operation of the Australian<br />
aviation system after the end of the two airline policy<br />
to see that the interests of areas like Tasmania are<br />
protected. I have no reason to believe from what I have<br />
heard from the industry and what I've heard from my own<br />
Ministers, that Tasmania needn't have that fear. But I<br />
give the people of Tasmania this clear guarantee. We'll<br />
be monitoring what happens when the two airline system<br />
finishes because I will want to ensure that Tasmanians do<br />
not suffer.<br />
ends </p>
