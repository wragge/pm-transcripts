Embargo until 5 pm. PRIMEST AIAITE<br />
FOR PRESS 4 April 1978<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he would be making<br />
a two day working visit to Japan in April. He would<br />
arrive in Tokyo on 19 April.<br />
Mr Fraser said that he believed that there were important<br />
international economic problems that he should discuss<br />
with Mr Fukuda, and he'had suggested to Mr Fukuda that<br />
there would be advantage in their meeting before Mr Fukuda<br />
left on his forthcoming visit to Washington. Mr Fukuda had<br />
readily agreed.<br />
Mr Fraser said the world still faced significant economic<br />
problems and he was concerned that all avenues be explored<br />
to bring about an improvement in international economic<br />
development.<br />
He welcomed the opportunity for discussions with Mr Fukuda<br />
in an informal and personal way. He expected that these<br />
would cover the general problem of the world economic<br />
situation, and matters such as world trade and the North-<br />
South Dialogue for international economic development.<br />
Mr Fraser stressed that he would not be seeking to negotiate<br />
bilateral matters with Mr Fukuda on this occasion. The<br />
Deputy Prime Minister had only recently returned from Japan<br />
where he had held extensive and useful talks with the<br />
Japanese Government and business leaders on these issues. </p>
