PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP AT THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN FILM INSTITUTE AWARDS PRESENTATION, SYDNEY,<br />
NOVEMBER 1993<br />
1 am delighted to be here tonight with friends in film and television to<br />
celebrate another year of spectacular achievement for the industry.<br />
Another year of success and confidence.<br />
As an Australian I'm very proud that we have a world class film and televlsion<br />
Industry which produces world class material. And with It an event such as<br />
the AFI awards to recognise it.<br />
I know that over recent times, and particularly in the light of the nominations<br />
for Best Film this year, we've had a bit of a debate about what an Australian<br />
film looks like.<br />
About whether you have to have a gum tree rather than a fir tree in it. Or<br />
sun, sand and surf. And a little snow or in Vincent's case, a lot of snow.<br />
About whether its got to be packed with people who are recognisably<br />
Australian, and, If so, who is. About whether its still OK to do period pieces<br />
I know that this is more than a matter of taste or fashion and I welcome the<br />
debate. In fact, as you've probably noticed, I welcome most debates about our<br />
cultural identity, and none more -so than in this industry which is so crucial to<br />
our cultural development.<br />
And that I think is the important point.<br />
This Industry Is crucial to our cultural development.<br />
We need it and we can't do without It. </p>
<p>Other countries can, of course, produce films, indeed excellent films, for<br />
Australians to see. And to learn from.<br />
But that is a very different matter.<br />
The simple fact is that no other country can produce Australian films. Or<br />
Australian television programs.<br />
Nor can they acquire the ability to do so. Its not something they can be<br />
educated to or grow into. Its certainly not something they can buy or we can<br />
sell. No-one else can give Australians ( or indeed the rest of the world) the<br />
perspectives that our filmmakers do.<br />
That is why we have to make sure that Australians don't lose creative control<br />
over the things that help us and future generations to understand what it<br />
means to be Australian.<br />
Why we have to make sure that the revolution in communications technology<br />
serves our cultural needs, rather than sit back and allow the globalisation of<br />
the telecommunications market to set our cultural agenda for us.<br />
Giobalisation can of course work in our favour too. It can create opportunities<br />
for our fil-ms tobe seen more widely.<br />
And as films such as Strictly Ballroom and the Heartbreak Kid, among others,<br />
show, we can go on making, dare I say it, distinctly Australian films, which the<br />
global market will pick up. Films which are not hung up on categorization or<br />
ideological purity.<br />
Australians must retain the capacity to show ourselves to the world and to tell<br />
the world our stories the ones that Ae want to tell. The ones that we should<br />
tell. But this does not preclude our filmmakers from exploring other parts of the<br />
world. We don't have a monopoly on Insight into the human condition. There<br />
are lots of things out there for us to learn. And to tell others about.<br />
Nor should it preclude us from attracting other filmmakers to Australia to<br />
make their films, or from pursuing new co-operative arrangements,<br />
particularly within our region.<br />
When I was in China earlier this year, I was fortunate to be able to visit the<br />
Beijing Film Studio, and meet Chen Kalge. Filmmakers such as Chen are at<br />
the front of liberal change in China. it would be good to see our industry<br />
working cooperatively with them. </p>
<p>We need such things to keep the industry flourishing. So we can provide<br />
Australians and many others with what they clearly want to see.<br />
While this Government will always be ready to assist in the process, It cannot<br />
nor should not be responsible for maintaining the critical mass the industry<br />
needs to survive.<br />
But I can assure you that we will continue to be a strong supporter and keep<br />
looking for new and better ways to help.<br />
I congratulate the AFI and everyone Involved for the great show tonight. I<br />
congratulate the ABC for televising it. Most of all, I congratulate the industry<br />
for its successes over the last year and I look forward eagerly to the triumphs<br />
that are sure to come.<br />
Thank you. </p>
