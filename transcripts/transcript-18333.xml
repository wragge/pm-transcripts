    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Prime Minister Julia Gillard today visited the site of University of Tasmania's new state-of-the-art institute, which will provide a new research hub for marine scientists in Tasmania.</p>
<p>The construction of the institute is funded by a $45 million investment provided by the Gillard Government under the Education Investment fund.</p>
<p>Due for completion in early 2014, the new Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies will house 290 marine scientists, students and staff in 2014, providing opportunities for collaborative research of national and international significance.</p>
<p>The Institute will be located close to both the Australian Antarctic Division and the CSIRO's Marine and Atmospheric Research laboratories, on the iconic Hobart waterfront.</p>
<p>The Hobart wharf district is the ideal location for this leading research facility being the current and historical departure point for Australia's Antarctic research expeditions.</p>
<p>The 3-level building will have a 5-star green rating. It has also been designed to fit in with its historic surroundings. </p>
<p>A ground floor exhibition space showcasing a range of marine and Antarctic displays will provide an additional point of interest for visitors to the waterfront precinct.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian-based science community already makes an important contribution to the world's understanding of the Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>While in Hobart, the Prime Minister also toured CSIRO's Marine and Atmospheric Research laboratories and visited one of Australia's two deep water research vessels - the RV Southern Surveyor.</p>
<p>Under the Super Science initiative, the Federal Government has provided $387 million in marine, Antarctic and climate research infrastructure including $120 million for a new, state-of-the-art research vessel to replace the Southern Surveyor. </p>
<p>The RV Investigator is due to arrive in Hobart in June 2013 and will be able to accommodate four times the number of scientists on voyages for almost twice as long. It is anticipated the new vessel will operate out at sea for up to 300 days a year - some 120 days more than the Southern Surveyor. </p>
<p>Other funding to ensure Australia's continuing leadership in marine, Antarctic and climate science and research includes:</p>
<p> * 	$102 million for the Australian Antarctic Division in 2011 - 12<br />
 * 	$73 million for the Antarctic research through the Cooperative Research Centres program<br />
 * 	$102 million for the Integrated Marine Observing System (including $52 million Super Science funding)<br />
 * 	A total of $100 million from the Education Investment Fund to support three major marine research facilities: the Sydney Institute of Marine Science; the Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre in Perth - including $45 million for the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies.</p>
