    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I witnessed the signing of an historic Memorandum on Cooperation in Education between Australia and Japan. The Memorandum was signed by Ms Yuko Obuchi, Japanese Vice Minister for Education and Australian Ambassador to Japan, Mr Murray McLean OAM.</p>
<p>I also took the opportunity on my visit to Japan to present eight high achieving scholars and professionals from Japan with prestigious Endeavour Awards. </p>
<p>The Endeavour Programme is part of the Australian Government's Australian Scholarships initiative worth AUD$1.4 billion. The Endeavour Programme aims to strengthen education linkages between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region by supporting high achieving students and professionals in their fields of study and research. </p>
<p>The memorandum and scholarships will give a meaningful boost to a very successful and productive education relationship. </p>
<p>Both countries are strengthening their education systems to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. The exchange of information and scholars will help to realise that ambition. </p>
