FOR MEDIA 17 April 1984<br />
I met today with the Premier of Tasmania, Mr. Robin Gray,<br />
as a follow-up to our meeting on 6 April.<br />
The discussions were productive and another meeting will be<br />
held within the next two weeks at which it is hoped<br />
substantial progress towards a resolution of the issues<br />
between the Commonwealth and Tasmania will be achieved.<br />
It was agreed that no further public comment would be made<br />
before the next meeting. </p>
