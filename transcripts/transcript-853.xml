<p>FULL TEXT OF THE SPEECH<br />
This is no ordinary election. It comes at a time when<br />
the Government has precariously and unexpectedly survived<br />
by one vote for two years. It comes at a time when<br />
turbulence and international tension exist nearer to our<br />
frontiers than ever before except during the last war; when<br />
strength is needed in the voice of Australia; when our<br />
country cannot afford to compel its Government to spend<br />
a lot of time, week by week, on the problem of domestic<br />
political survival.<br />
Why did I seek a dissolution? I have already given you<br />
the greatest reason. Nobody knows quite as well as I do<br />
how incredibly difficult living on a knife-edge is, but, anyhow,<br />
there will be a poll on November 30th and on that<br />
day you will vote about who is to be in government, and<br />
not about whether your choice should have been postponed<br />
for some months.<br />
The Opposition has, in these last two precarious years,<br />
five times tried, in Parliament, to defeat us and force an<br />
election, and has each time failed narrowly. It can scarcely<br />
complain now at having an election which it so eagerly<br />
sought. We address you with pride in the achievements of the<br />
past fourteen years and with confidence in the future. We<br />
recall how marvellously this nation has progressed; what </p>
<p>great structures have been built, or are in the building,<br />
upon a firm foundation.<br />
That no government can live on its past record is<br />
true. Yet our future growth is largely determined by the<br />
quality of what has already been done. A good future<br />
cannot easily be the projection of a bad or incompetent<br />
past. Any employer has good reason to examine the record<br />
of a prospective employee. At an election, you are the<br />
employers! There have, as in all other countries, been fluctuations<br />
in our fortunes; but the strong general trend has been<br />
upwards. Those who seek to make your flesh creep with<br />
foolish and false talk of another " credit squeeze" must<br />
assume that there is such a violent upsurge in economic<br />
activity as will produce an inflationary boom.<br />
We do not anticipate any such state of affairs.<br />
As a non-Socialist Government, we do not think that<br />
all good causes can be served only by Government orders<br />
and controls. We believe that the highest good for the<br />
nation can be achieved by wise co-operation between Government<br />
and people. With that co-operation, booms can<br />
be avoided and extraordinary measures be unnecessary.<br />
The choice at this election is particularly important<br />
for those of you who are under 35. You have, as voters,<br />
never known a Socialist Labour Government at Canberra,<br />
and some of you may therefore be tempted to fall for the<br />
old cry " It's time for a change!" even though it<br />
would be a change back to the very people who were<br />
dismissed in 1949.<br />
Now, change is a good thing, so long as it is a change<br />
for the better! Those who recall the Labour Party Socialist<br />
era of restrictions, attempted nationalisation, and the discouragement<br />
of enterprise which ended in December, 1949,<br />
will not need to be reminded that a Liberal-Country Party.<br />
4 priccs and costs, the answer will be difficult and slow,<br />
and the economic casualties high. If, to pay for hundreds<br />
of millions of added expenditure, a Labour Government<br />
increased taxes commensurately by increasing personal<br />
income tax and company tax steeply, or invented new taxes,<br />
or inflated the currency, with reduced true incomes, it will<br />
be too late to say, " We didn't know it was loaded!"<br />
You will not be able to indulge in the luxury of second<br />
thoughts, or of an early and successful repentance. Put<br />
the A. L. P. into power this time, and you will suffer the<br />
consequences for long after my time, or that of some of<br />
my most experienced colleagues. Our alliances broken, our<br />
export industries defeated by inflated costs, the Communists<br />
encouraged and active, our country will find that it has<br />
abandoned the substance for the shadow, National Security<br />
through alliances for a species of impotent isolation, and a<br />
steady growth for a spectacular decline.<br />
tkAustralia is at the cross-roads. Which road will you </p>
<p>PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA<br />
Recently, at Port Moresby, I took the opportunity of<br />
broadcasting a statement on our policy and intentions for<br />
the future of Papua and New Guinea. All I need do now<br />
is to summarise what I then said.<br />
We will press on with education, not only for political<br />
citizenship but for technical and administrative skill.<br />
We will do all possible to improve rural production,<br />
both for consumption and export. We will develop markets,<br />
improve transport facilities. We will encourage<br />
capital investment, without which progress will be slow.<br />
We will, by the creation of local governing bodies and by<br />
means of a largely elective Legislative Council, help the<br />
indigenous inhabitants to learn the art and science of selfgovernment,<br />
so that when the time comes for them to make<br />
a choice, they will do so freely and with knowledge.<br />
Meanwhile, we will continue to provide growing financial<br />
support and, as I have repeatedly said, we will defend<br />
Papua and New Guinea as if they were part of the Australian<br />
mainland.<br />
FINAL I end, as 1 began, with a reference to the vital issues.<br />
We are asking for a Mandate. There are times in a goodnatured<br />
country like our own, when people are tempted to<br />
say, " Well, things are good; we can take a chance. And<br />
if it turns out wrong, we can easily send for the others."<br />
Forget it. The choice you make this time will decide the<br />
political and economic future of Australia for ten years.<br />
If it endangers our great alliances, repair will be difficult<br />
and slow. If it initiates a great burst of inflation and rising Government at Canberra has helped to create a revolutionary<br />
change in the economic climate, in production, in the growth<br />
of trade with the world, in living standards, in social services,<br />
in provisions for health, in the free choice of employment<br />
and large and growing employment at that in<br />
population growth, in large savings and large industrial<br />
investment, in increasing educational opportunities, in<br />
national development credit, and security. To compare<br />
Australia today, under a free enterprise Government, with<br />
the Australia of fourteen years ago is to pinpoint the most<br />
dramatic change and growth to be recorded anywhere in<br />
the world. As electors you have a great chance to make a change,<br />
not by turning away from a sound and growing prosperity<br />
to new and almost hysterical experiments carried out under<br />
the close control of Labour's outside executive not elected<br />
by you but by giving to the Government a working<br />
majority. That is the electoral change that is needed. An<br />
almost equally divided National Parliament is no proper<br />
foundation for a stable and positive and authoritative Government.<br />
When I say " authoritative", we are not seeking some<br />
dictatorial authority over you. Heaven forbid. We leave<br />
that to the Socialists, whose whole doctrine subordinates<br />
the individual to the State. Socialism is, in fact, both repressive<br />
and reactionary. " Authority" in an Australian<br />
Government is what it needs to have when it is negotiating<br />
with other countries, whether on political arrangements, or<br />
trade, or military alliances, or arrangements for the common<br />
security. It can derive that authority only from you.<br />
And, speaking of trade, don't forget that, under Trade<br />
Treaties negotiated by us, Japan has become an immense<br />
customer for our primary exports. Our rural industries<br />
would have been in great difficulties otherwise. Yet Labour<br />
voted to a man against the Japanese Trade Treaty. </p>
<p>FOREIGN POLICY<br />
We want growth and progress and security at home.<br />
For that purpose we need security abroad. We want friends<br />
and a defence policy which gets us strength and a true<br />
willingness and capacity to co-operate with our friends in<br />
the defence of the common security.<br />
It was my Government which negotiated the ANZUS<br />
pact with the U. S. A. and New Zealand. It is of vital importance.<br />
To take an example, we have made it clear that<br />
we will defend Papua-New Guinea against attack, as if it<br />
were part of the Australian mainland. That promise of ours<br />
is, as a result of ANZUS, completely backed by the United<br />
States. Yet the A. L. P. has never been enthusiastic about<br />
ANZUS. Its left-wingers, who have to be placated and<br />
compromised with, and who might very well dominate it<br />
in the next three years, are very uncritical of " Communist<br />
Imperialism", which the world knows to be a threatening<br />
reality. We helped to negotiate SEATO.<br />
We sent Australian forces to Malaya as part of a<br />
Commonwealth Strategic Reserve under SEATO. The<br />
Opposition front-seat spokesmen in Parliament and the outside<br />
back-seat drivers-the 36 men-were opposed to<br />
having our troops in Malaya. Mr. Calwell now says, I<br />
think, that he does not object; but all he says is subject to<br />
his outside Federal Executive, whose orders bind him, and<br />
whose President has recently re-affirmed Labour's objections.<br />
Now that Malaya has expanded into Malaysia, what<br />
do we find? My Government has made an express statement<br />
that we will join with Great Britain and Malaysia<br />
herself to resist armed attack upon the political independence<br />
and national integrity of Malaysia. Labour in Parliament<br />
guardedly supported " the concept" of Malaysia, but proto be found in co-operation; government doing, as in the<br />
public works field, what private enterprise cannot reasonably<br />
be expected to do, and private enterprise doing, with the<br />
incentive of profit and advancement, what no Government<br />
Department could hope to do either successfully or at all.<br />
We express our indebtedness to those who have, at a sacrifice<br />
of their private time, given us the benefit of their<br />
experience and their ideas. We have a real belief that, in<br />
the national interest, this association will go on.<br />
OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE<br />
We have been greatly impressed by the old people's<br />
welfare work which is being done by voluntary organisations.<br />
They have directed attention to human problems<br />
which are above and beyond the provision by Government<br />
of pensions, aged persons' homes, and such general benefits.<br />
We strongly support what such organisations are<br />
attempting to do to meet individual problems which cannot<br />
be dealt with by either complex or uniform legislative provisions.<br />
We will confer with the State Premiers to see what<br />
can be done to assist this valuable work.<br />
IMMIGRATION A large and sustained programme of immigration is a<br />
very important element in national growth. It sustains<br />
confidence for the future, and is of great assistance to forward<br />
business planning.<br />
This year we are increasing our overall target by 10,000<br />
to 135,000. All the signs are, judging by last year's<br />
experience, that this target will be exceeded. We will continue<br />
our programmes into future years with vigour and<br />
imagination. </p>
<p>to be handled with care and understanding. As, from a<br />
national Australian point of view, we would wish to see<br />
new capital from overseas employed for the great purpose<br />
of developing new industries or extending existing ones with<br />
all the benefit of overseas skills and experience, we will<br />
always have a particularly warm welcome for new capital<br />
designed to these ends. We also believe that fears and misunderstandings<br />
are least where there i6 an Australian participation<br />
in shareholding and management, and most when<br />
there is no more than a mere change of ownership without<br />
more. There is, we believe, a growing recognition of this<br />
in the minds of intending investors.<br />
The Terms of Reference to the Committee of Economic<br />
Enquiry include " Overseas investmint in Australia<br />
( including likely sources and trends and an assessment of its<br />
significance to the Australian economy)". The Committee's<br />
findings will be of great value and interest.<br />
BUSINESS CO-OPERATION<br />
Governments may easily be misled by statistics which<br />
are, in their nature, somewhat out of date. We have, therefore,<br />
in the last two years, developed the practice of<br />
periodical consultation with representatives of the primary,<br />
secondary and tertiary business community in order to elicit<br />
their practical day to day experience and views.<br />
This practice has proved to be of great value, and we<br />
will continue it.<br />
As a non-socialist Government, which values the great<br />
contribution which private enterprise makes to national<br />
growth, we subscribe heartily to the principle that, in a<br />
free and growing country like our own, Socialism, or State<br />
authority and control, is not the answer. Socialism is' in<br />
fact, both repressive and reactionary. The true answer is ceeded to attach terms to any military support which they<br />
know to be unacceptable to Malaysia.<br />
The pledge we have given has already had a marked<br />
effect among our neighbours; and our allies. It is essential<br />
that they should know, as a result of this election, whether<br />
the Australian people stand behind our clear-cut statement,<br />
or prefer the ambiguous, uncertain, equivocating, fluctuating<br />
and almost mumbling attitude of our opponents.<br />
There is a similar conflict about the establishment of<br />
the American Naval Signalling Station at North West Cape<br />
in Western, Australia. When Labour's outside governing<br />
body, the 36, ( whom you are being asked to vote into power<br />
on polling day) met at Canberra to consider this matter,<br />
it went within two votes of opposing the American proposal<br />
outright. The switch of one vote would have warned<br />
the Americans off. Finally, a grudging approval was given,<br />
but on terms as to control which, as is well known, the<br />
Americans were not prepared to accept. You must resolve<br />
these issues. It is vital that Australia's foreign policy and<br />
relations with foreign powers should be clear and steady,<br />
and that the world should know that they are managed by<br />
a government which has a clear mandate from the Australian<br />
people. That is what we are asking for. That, above all, is<br />
why we are having an election.<br />
There is another grave matter. Labour proposes to<br />
negotiate a nuclear-free zone South of the Equator, with a<br />
prohibition of the storing or deployment of nuclear weapons<br />
in that area. This is a suicidal proposal. If adopted in<br />
the absence of a general world disarmament which effectively<br />
included the Communist powers, it would certainly imperil<br />
the existence of both SEATO and ANZUS. Great Britain<br />
and the U. S. A. are our allies in SEATO, and the U. S. A. in<br />
ANZUS. Each is a nuclear power. The capacity of the<br />
United States, in particular, to use nuclear weapons has successfully<br />
deterred the Communist aggressors in the past, and </p>
<p>has thereby saved the free world. The Soviet Union has<br />
great nuclear power: we may be sure that Communist China<br />
will have it before long. Both are North of the Equator;<br />
but nowadays nuclear weapons could be delivered anywhere<br />
in the world. It follows that Labour's proposals, if successful,<br />
would seek to prevent our two nuclear-powered<br />
allies from firing nuclear weapons from any point South of<br />
the Equator, while leaving the Communists free to fire into<br />
this zone without resistance!<br />
I was one of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in<br />
London who declared for the ending of nuclear-testing, and<br />
carried a resolution against the extension of nuclear weapon<br />
capacity to nations not then possessing them. We do not<br />
want to increase the area of risk, or entrust great weapons<br />
of destruction to small minds or small hands. But if the<br />
Communists strike and world war comes, it will, for as far<br />
ahead as we can reasonably see, come with nuclear weapons.<br />
Australia's security would be at stake.<br />
Would you wish us, now, to contract ourselves out<br />
of nuclear counter-attack from the Indian Ocean or South<br />
West Pacific, or for that matter from Australian territory?<br />
To do so would be cruelly to handicap our allies and disastrously<br />
to aid and abet our enemies. Do you seriously think<br />
that any nuclear power would wish to continue to be our ally<br />
on such terms? That is why, clearly looked at, Labour<br />
policy is clearly one of suicide, and a lonely suicide at that.<br />
DEFENCE We present to you a notable Defence record. Our<br />
latest air force decision rounds off the largest and most<br />
ambitious re-equipment programme in the peace-time history<br />
of Australia. Our policy isto<br />
provide highly mobile, modem, and wellequipped<br />
forces for our defence;<br />
8 social and regional interests, difficulties of communication,<br />
remoteness or distance, the trend of population changes,<br />
physical features, and the relative areas of proposed Divisions.<br />
We do not propose any fixed quota differential, but<br />
we do propose by the Statute to emphasise the factors to<br />
which I have referred.<br />
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES<br />
It is of the essence of competitive enterprise that there<br />
should be real competition, and that the road to advancement<br />
in any business should be open to all. This system<br />
we wish to protect.<br />
Privately imposed restraints which are against the public<br />
interest or submit the small trader to oppressive limitations<br />
should be eliminated.<br />
After the publication of a broad statement of policy<br />
in general terms, the Government has held many discussions<br />
and has received many criticisms and suggestions.<br />
I now announce that we will, after the election,<br />
assisted by these and any further discussions and suggestions,<br />
prepare and introduce into the new Parliament, a Bill<br />
to deal with restrictive practices and to protect the small<br />
trader. After its preparation and introduction, it will be<br />
open for public scrutiny for a reasonable time before the<br />
second reading debate is resumed.<br />
INVESTMENT FROM OVERSEAS<br />
Investment from overseas countries has taken an<br />
important place in our economy. Over the last fifteen years<br />
it has amounted to over Å l, 500M.<br />
This investment has produced great advantages, but<br />
under some circumstances produces problems which need </p>
<p>medical benefits by This means that the gap which<br />
has to be met by the patient will be reduced by at least 20%.<br />
All contributors to medical benefits insurance funds will<br />
be entitled to this increase, without being required to make<br />
any increase in their weekly contribution to the fund.<br />
MENTAL HEALTH<br />
The Commonwealth has already, under a limit of<br />
LiO0M., made grants exceeding on the basis of El<br />
for each Å E2 expended by the States on the building or<br />
equipping of mental health treatment centres. That limit<br />
will not apply for the next three years. This is of particular<br />
importance to those States which have spent up to their<br />
share of the existing limit.<br />
REDISTRIBUTION The Statistician, in dividing the electorate quota into<br />
the population of each State, to determine how many seats<br />
in the House of Representatives that State is to have, is at<br />
present bound to find that if the division leaves a fraction<br />
less than one half, the State does not get a seat for that<br />
fraction. This means, at present, that growing States, like<br />
Queensland and Western Australia, and even New South<br />
Wales, stand to lose a seat. This is, we think, wrong. We<br />
therefore propose to amend the Representation Act to provide<br />
that any surplus fraction will equal one seat. In consequence,<br />
no State will lose a seat.<br />
Again, we will amend the Electoral Act by making it<br />
clear to the Redistribution Commissioners that, in exercising<br />
their discretion to vary the normal electoral quota up or<br />
down, to allow for some variation between compact metropolitan<br />
seats and very much larger rural areas, they shall<br />
specifically take into account, community of economic, to maintain those forces, in both quality and quantity,<br />
in such shape as to enable us to co-operate<br />
with our SEATO and ANZUS partners, to theqi1<br />
satisf action and our own;<br />
to provide, in Australia, at Woomera and in Supply<br />
scientific and technical and production backing.<br />
We know that, in a war for survival, we would not be fighting<br />
alone. We have alliances with great powers. But,<br />
equally, we are not so self-centred as to think that these<br />
alliances confer on us rights, but no duties. We must stand<br />
by our allies if they are to stand by us.<br />
Australia is ready and able to meet its international<br />
commitments. I will not burden you with a detailed account of our<br />
greatly extended defence programme. But, in case our<br />
opponents, who have suddenly discovered an interest in<br />
Defence for purposes of this election, have tempted you to<br />
believe that our defences are inadequate or obsolete, I<br />
mention just a few highlights.<br />
The Royal Australian Navy is in process of securing<br />
three of the most modern missile-carrying destroyers in the<br />
world, plus a submarine force, to be added to an aircraft<br />
carrier, a converted troop-. carrier, and the normal escort and<br />
anti-submarine destroyers and smaller craft.<br />
The Army has been re-. organised and is being expanded<br />
for mobility, speedy availability, and modemn equipment,<br />
including Army co-operation aircraft of the very latest type.<br />
The valuable work of the C. M. F. will have our special<br />
attention. In the Air Force, we had previously made and put into<br />
service the Canberra reconnaissance-bomber which is still<br />
in good service in many other parts of the free world. We </p>
<p>adapted, produced, and put into service the Sabre jet fighter,<br />
still engaged in many places. These aircraft are far from<br />
obsolete. But the Government has actively followed the stream<br />
of events. We already have, to make the mobility of our<br />
forces a reality, the world's best transport plane, the<br />
Hercules. We have, for seaward reconnaissance, the best<br />
plane of its type, the Neptune. We are re-equipping our<br />
fighter squadrons with a large number of Mirage fighters.<br />
Our advice is that they are superior to any world competitor.<br />
And now we have arranged, on most favourable terms of<br />
cost and delivery, to obtain the American TFX reconnaissance<br />
bomber, which our Air Force experts, after<br />
extended investigations overseas, declared to be " the ideal<br />
choice for the i. e. the best for our purposes, our<br />
security, and the men who will fly them.<br />
We can look our allies in the face with justice, and<br />
have no temptation to appease our enemies.<br />
ECONOMIC POLICY<br />
The objectives of the Government's Economic Policy<br />
are a high rate of economic and population growth with<br />
full employment, increasing productivity, rising standards of<br />
living, external solvency, and stability of costs and prices.<br />
They are being successfully achieved.<br />
Indeed, our opponents have realised that their<br />
prophecies of a depression, unemployment and gloom have<br />
been proved false.<br />
Having realised that they cannot frighten you, they<br />
have now decided to try, rather offensively, to buy you.<br />
They have made a series of irresponsible bids which<br />
would add hundreds of millions to the money -in circulation<br />
without in any way increasing or cheapening production or Commonwealth subsidy of Å l for every Å 3 which a person<br />
in this age group deposits or shall have deposited, over a<br />
period of at least three years in an identifiable account at<br />
an approved institution, to be released, upon or after marriage,<br />
for home building or purchasing purposes. The<br />
maximum subsidy for one house will be Å 250. Thus by<br />
the Commonwealth subsidy, Å 750 saved in this age group<br />
for a home after marriage will be increased to Å 1,000. For<br />
obvious reasons, this will not extend to the purchase of<br />
State houses, or for the purchase of house and land costing<br />
more than Å 7,000.<br />
Second, there is the problem, which bears heavily upon<br />
many people, of filling, frequently on oppressive terms of<br />
borrowing, the gap between available housing loans, and<br />
the buying need of the purchaser. Among these people are<br />
many-sometimes overlooked-who want a house which is<br />
in size or quality better than the average. We must not<br />
encourage too much uniformity of dwellings in a refreshingly<br />
individualistic country.<br />
To meet this problem, we will assist the obtaining of<br />
low deposit loans related to the income and reasonable<br />
credit-worthiness of the borrower. We will do this by a<br />
system of insurance by a National Housing Insurance Corporation.<br />
Loans, the subject of the guarantee, would extend to<br />
something like three times the borrower's established income,<br />
with some reasonable total ceiling. The Government will,<br />
up to a high percentage of valuation, ranging up to<br />
in appropriate cases, insure the repayment of such loans<br />
by approved lenders at approved rates of interest, which,<br />
under guarantec, should be reasonable.<br />
MEDICAL BENEFITS<br />
In view of the medical profession's assurances regarding<br />
stabilization of fees, we will increase Commonwealth<br />
23 </p>
<p>Third, there is a special need for improved science<br />
teaching in the secondary schools, if we are to keep in step<br />
with the march of science.<br />
As some recognition of this need, we will make available<br />
05M. per annum for the provision of building and<br />
equipment facilities for science teaching in secondary<br />
schools. The amount will be distributed on a school population<br />
basis, and will be available to all secondary schools,<br />
Government or independent, without discrimination.<br />
CHILD ENDOWMENT<br />
Child endowment will be raised to 15/-per week for<br />
third and subsequent children. Having in mind the educational<br />
responsibilities of parents, 15/-per week endowment<br />
will be paid in respect of all full-time student children from<br />
16 to 21.<br />
HOUSING Housing is a constant problem in a growing country.<br />
Work is, however, going on apace. The current year should<br />
see a record programme.<br />
We are making a large contribution, direct and indirect,<br />
to this construction rate of something like 100,000 dwellings<br />
a year. Indeed, of all the dwellings in Australia, 36% have<br />
been built during the term of office of the present Government,<br />
while 76% of Australian homes are owned or in process<br />
of ownership by the occupiers.<br />
But there are two special problems which we propose<br />
to help to solve.<br />
First, there is a special difficulty experienced by young<br />
married people, particularly in the age group up to 35, in<br />
financing the purchase of a dwelling. We will provide a supply. In short, they are offering you an inflationary boom<br />
of unprecedented virulence.<br />
Tonight I will announce some valuable items of policy<br />
affecting both metropolitan and rural people. They are all<br />
practical. Unlike the Opposition, we know, from much<br />
information and experience, what we can perform, with advantage<br />
to the people and without hindering the performance<br />
of that general policy.<br />
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
Under us, the process of development is getting faster<br />
and faster as time goes on. In the last three years, developmental<br />
expenditure by the Commonwealth in the States and<br />
Territories was about double what it was in the three years<br />
which ended in 1958. This is the story of progress building<br />
on progress. The contributing factors in Australian growth have<br />
been the achievement of remarkable stability in prices and<br />
costs, a high national credit at home and abroad, a buoyant<br />
loan market, high and rising employment, a growing programme<br />
of immigration, great business and manufacturing<br />
expansion, a remarkable increase in rural production, the<br />
vital facts that Australians believe in themselves, and that<br />
the rest of the world believes in us too.<br />
The rate of development is progressive; greater at the<br />
end of our fourteen years of office than ever before. Having<br />
achieved a long period of stabilised prices and costs, we<br />
want to avoid any new cost-price spiral. But we will press<br />
on with growth in no timid or faint-hearted way. We<br />
believe, and confidently expect that over the next five<br />
years, given good government, growth should at least equal<br />
a total increase of 25% in the Gross National Product, in<br />
terms of constant prices. </p>
<p>Growth in all its forms, in public resources, in private<br />
business development, in rural production, in the promotion<br />
of the export trade, in widening opportunities for individuals,<br />
is the prime objective of our policies.<br />
In the very hey-day of our progress, the Australian<br />
Labour Party asks you to dismiss us; to commit the national<br />
fortunes to the hands of its Members of Parliament and the<br />
famous outside body, thirty-six " faceless men", whose qualifications<br />
are unknown, who have no elected responsibility to<br />
you. Do you feel tempted? Why?<br />
Would you really believe that a Caiwell Government<br />
would raise the credit of government at home or abroad?<br />
Or that Mr. Calwell's astronomical promises of hundreds<br />
of millions added to the existing supply can be performed<br />
without raising the levels of prices and costs and taxes?<br />
Or that the Socialists will encourage the growth of competitive<br />
free enterprise? Or that the enhanced bureaucracy<br />
of a Socialist Administration will stimulate production at a<br />
bearable cost level? Or improve that standing and relationship<br />
with the great free powers which means so much to<br />
our external security and therefore to our peaceful domestic<br />
growth? If you admit that you cannot believe these things,<br />
you must agree that our opponents are, by offering you<br />
everything that anybody has ever asked for, trying to persuade<br />
you to gamble recklessly with the prosperity and progress<br />
and safety of a splendidly growing nation.<br />
NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT<br />
The development of Northern Australia is of great importance<br />
to all of us. Four authorities are directly involved<br />
-the States of Queensland and Western Australia,<br />
the Northern Territory Administration, and the Common-In research, so growingly important for a growing<br />
nation, we have adopted and are pursuing most encouraging<br />
measures, with an outlay which already exceeds Å 25M., as<br />
against something a little over Å 3M. when we came into<br />
office. I now want to announce some new and, I think you<br />
will agree, valuable items of policy.<br />
First, there are many good pupils in secondary schools<br />
who would benefit if they were helped to have the final two<br />
school years which they might otherwise miss, through family<br />
circumstances. Those two years will make them much<br />
better equipped, whatever they do thereafter. There are<br />
many undergoing technical training. Any scheme which<br />
assists a student to carry through a course of technical study<br />
for an additional two years would have great national value<br />
in these times.<br />
We propose to create special Commonwealth Scholarships,<br />
to be awarded competitively, at standards to be<br />
worked out wvith the States.<br />
There will be in the case of secondary schools 10,000<br />
such scholarships per year, tenable at a secondary school for<br />
two years. They will cover each year payments for fees<br />
and books up to 100 per annum, and a further maintenance<br />
allowance to the parents of Å 100 per annum. They will<br />
be open to students of all secondary schools, State or independent,<br />
without discrimination.<br />
There will also be 2,500 scholarships carrying the same<br />
benefits, open to students at technical schools.<br />
Second, having in mind the urgency of increasing<br />
technical school facilities, we will offer to the States an<br />
annual grant of Å 5M. towards the building and equipment<br />
costs of technical schools. </p>
<p>We have provided special taxation allowances of<br />
two kinds, of great value to family people-<br />
Education expenses of children up to the<br />
age of 21, to a maximum of Å 150 per year each;<br />
Å 91 for each dependent child between 16<br />
and 21 who is receiving full-time education.<br />
I ask -you to take note of the fact that every item in<br />
this remarkable list was introduced by my Government<br />
for the first time. Labour had done nothing about them.<br />
And note also that the financial pace, so far from slowing<br />
down, is increasing rapidly every year!<br />
On top of all this, we have not overlooked the educational<br />
responsibilities of the States in the fields of primary<br />
and secondary education. The size of the school population<br />
is a large factor in determining the amount of the Commonwealth<br />
grants to the States. These have increased from<br />
Å 165M. in 1951-52 to Å 469M. in 1963-4!<br />
On the capital side-which brings in school buildings<br />
-we provided, between 1951 and 1963-assistance to the<br />
States' programmes, over and above the yield of the Loan<br />
Market, 30% of what the States spent on works.<br />
Considering these facts, it is not surprising, though<br />
it is vastly pleasing, to know that State Governments have<br />
been able to increase their expenditure on education from<br />
in 195 1-52 to Å 201M. last year! This year they<br />
are all spending more, and spending it well. Most Premiers<br />
agree that we have, recognising how big a factor in their<br />
Budgets is Education, treated them in no parsimonious<br />
fashion. In short, the story that the Commonwealth ignores the<br />
claim of primary and secondary education is demonstrably<br />
false. wealth. Between them, a great deal has been done, with<br />
very heavy Commonwealth subsidies. From irrigation<br />
schemes on the Ord River, beef roads and harbour works<br />
in Western Australia, to great mineral developments, beef<br />
roads, Mt. Isa railway reconstruction, and the commencement<br />
of the close use of the Brigalow country in Queensland,<br />
there is a buzz of activity. We are entering a phase of<br />
northern development more exciting than ever before.<br />
How should this growth be promoted?<br />
It has been proposed by some thoughtful people that<br />
some special commission or authority should be established<br />
and that it should, so to speak, have the problem handed<br />
over to it. There have been suggestions about using the<br />
famous Snowy Mountains Authority.<br />
What these proposals overlook is that all government<br />
development work costs money much money and that<br />
Governments are accountable to the taxpayers for the<br />
money they spend. It follows that no government can, by<br />
giving authority to some outside body, abandon control over<br />
its own budget. That expert bodies can do great work in<br />
carrying out works approved by governments and parliaments<br />
is clear; the record of the Snowy Mountains Authority,<br />
a brilliantly competent executive body, working under a<br />
specific vote out of the Commonwealth Budget, shows this.<br />
The method we have employed in recent years has<br />
been to confer with the State concerned, to discuss the value<br />
and priority of some development work, and then to make<br />
Commonwealth-State agreements for the carrying out of<br />
specific undertakings. This method has undoubtedly worked<br />
very well in practice. Under it, my own Government is finding<br />
millions of pounds for matters now proceeding in the<br />
two States and the Territory. We have no doubt that this<br />
practice, of considering individual projects on their own<br />
merits, and then deciding whether there is a national significance<br />
which should attract Commonwealth aid, could con-</p>
<p>tinue to servc this nation very well. After all, a similar<br />
practical approach has already, further South, created the<br />
Snowy Mountains Scheme, completed rail standardisation<br />
from Sydney to Melbourne, and has put into construction<br />
the great rail standardisation schemes in Western Australia<br />
and South Australia, the vast Chowilla Dam in South Australia,<br />
the long-deferred Blowering Dam in New South<br />
Wales, newly-equipped Coal Ports, and many other enterprises,<br />
to be found in every State.<br />
The present methods have worked, and the speed of<br />
their operation will be accelerated as time goes on and<br />
knowledge increases.<br />
To make the examination of northern projects an<br />
examination made, of course, in consultation with Commonwealth<br />
and State Ministers, and with expert advice<br />
needs to be in the first instance the special responsibility of<br />
one Commonwealth Minister.<br />
To this end we will establish a special Northern<br />
Division of the Department of National Development. I<br />
should add two observations. One is that private enterprise<br />
has a major part to play in Northern Development, has<br />
already done a great deal and needs encouragement. The<br />
other is that we learn that the Premiers of Quensland and<br />
Western Australia are preparing proposals for presentation<br />
to us. When we receive them, they will be studied sympathetically.<br />
But clearly this cannot be done effectively in the<br />
middle of an election campaign.<br />
There are two special problems.<br />
The first is Water Storage and use. The second is the<br />
matter of freights; the cost of transport of materials and<br />
plant to the North is one of the greatest burdens upon<br />
Northern Development by Governments and citizens alike.<br />
The Water Resources Council, which in our 1961<br />
Policy Speech we undertook to establish, is now functioning I want to put this matter straight by stating the relevant<br />
facts quite baldly.<br />
We initiated block grants to the States for their<br />
Universities in 1951.<br />
We established the Murray Committee in 1956,<br />
and completely adopted its report. A series of massive<br />
grants for the Universities began.<br />
In 1959 we established the Australian Universities<br />
Commission. Over the next three calendar years, we will find<br />
Å 60M. for the State Universities, and Å 21M. for the<br />
Australian National University.<br />
Greatly assisted by this new and very substantial<br />
Commonwealth aid, there are now 69,000 undergraduates,<br />
as compared with 32,000 in 1949.<br />
We have initiated large aid to the teaching hospitals.<br />
This will substantially increase as from next<br />
year. We have established a special and widely representative<br />
Committee to examine " the whole field of<br />
post-secondary education in Australia." I am<br />
informed that this Committee expects to report by the<br />
end of the year. Its report is bound to have great<br />
significance both educationally and financially not only<br />
for the Universities but in such areas as senior technical<br />
education, teacher training, and agricultural education.<br />
The Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme we<br />
established in 1951. Under an announcement I made<br />
a few weeks ago, there will be as from next year 5,000<br />
open entrance scholarships, 1,280 second and later<br />
year awards, and up to 225 post-graduate awards. </p>
<p>focal point for the planning and development of a comprehensive<br />
system and to help in co-ordinating the activities<br />
of Commonwealth and State Governments in the roads field.<br />
Our own study suggests that this is desirable. We will helpfully<br />
discuss with the States the desirability of establishing<br />
such an authority.<br />
The nation would benefit from a thorough-going survey<br />
and appraisal of the existing roads system and of foreseeable<br />
road requirements.<br />
TRADE My colleague, the Minister for Trade, can tell you an<br />
exciting story of the growth of exports including manufactured<br />
exports and of our increasing activities, through<br />
Trade Commissioner Services and Trade Missions, all<br />
around the world. What I want to do is to refer to a<br />
criticism sometimes made, that while there is a Department<br />
of Primary Industry, there is none of Secondary Industry.<br />
The Trade Department is in fact concerned with Tariff<br />
Policies, with Trade Treaties, and with the promotion of<br />
exports of secondary products, and maintains close contact<br />
with manufacturers. To make this clear, we propose to<br />
alter the name of the Department from " Trade" to " Trade<br />
and Industry", and to create in it a special Secondary<br />
Industry Section under a very senior and responsible official,<br />
working immediately under the Minister and the Secretary<br />
to the Department.<br />
EDUCATION I claim that we have a unique and rapidly-growing<br />
record in the field of education. As briefly as possible, and has taken for its first task the measurement and assessment<br />
of Australia's water resources. We will support the<br />
Council vigorously, financially and otherwise. The information<br />
gathered will be of particular significance for<br />
Northern Development. We have, in such cases as the<br />
Chowilla Dam and the Blowering Dam, and flood mitigation<br />
works on the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, shown<br />
a readiness to support thoroughly-examined and prepared<br />
State proposals. The work of the Water Resources Council<br />
should assist greatly in discovering and evaluating the<br />
possibilities of water schemes in the North of Australia.<br />
When we consider the great increases, and sometimes<br />
multiplication of costs in the Northern Territory, the North<br />
of Western Australia, and parts of the North of Queensland<br />
caused by the costs of transportation, we see that we have<br />
here a practical problem of great magnitude.<br />
Before anybody offers to say how this Nor-thern freight<br />
problem should be tackled, it is necessary to have a thorough<br />
and authoritative examination of the facts, and the feasibility<br />
of various methods of dealing with the problems disclosed.<br />
We propose to establish a competent Committee of<br />
Investigation to conduct this examination and report to the<br />
Government.<br />
PETROL PRICES<br />
Among the elements which place burdens upon rural<br />
costs, particularly in more remote areas, is the increase in<br />
the price of petroleum products as the distance grows between<br />
the metropolitan areas and those further out. We<br />
propose to do something about this. We will bring about<br />
a change in the price of petroleum products ( other than fuel<br />
oil) so that nowhere in Australia will the normal price be </p>
<p>more than four pence a gallon above the level of capital city<br />
prices. We propose to effect this by arrangement with petrol<br />
companies, and by arranging with the States for the Commonwealth<br />
to make grants to the States ( under Section 96<br />
of the Constitution) to enable them to pay the appropriate<br />
compensation to those companies. City prices and those at<br />
present with a fourpence or smaller differential will not be<br />
affected.<br />
DECENTRALISATION I have already referred to our petrol price proposal.<br />
I should add that a great deal of our current policy is<br />
designed to aid the country areas and to add to the attractiveness<br />
of rural industry. Our measures range from special<br />
taxation allowances, special depreciation allowances, subsidies,<br />
stabilisation schemes, and such items as the Superphosphates<br />
Bounty, the encouragement of mining and<br />
mineral exploration, and a host of other provisions which<br />
are well and favourably known to the man on the land.<br />
Practical measures to assist the decentralisation of<br />
industry in Australia will, with renewed emphasis, be regarded<br />
as an important policy objective.<br />
OIL SEARCH<br />
We will extend the oil search subsidy scheme for three<br />
years from June 30th, 1964, and will also extend for the<br />
same period the tax benefits granted by Section 77A of<br />
the Income Tax Act. The Commonwealth Government<br />
subsidy has already increased the total amount of money<br />
spent in exploration by roughly one-third and is materially<br />
assisting progress. Complete success would revolutionise the<br />
Australian economy. EXTENSION SERVICES<br />
Much valuable re earch work is being done in Australia<br />
by C. S. I. R. O. and other organisations, in aid of both<br />
primary and secondary industry. Much more will be done<br />
in future. But we believe that the results of research do not go<br />
into practical application quickly enough. This is particularly<br />
true in rural production, where increased productivity<br />
and efficiency are essential to combat pressures on the cost<br />
level. We are prepared to work with State Governments,<br />
which have major responsibilities in this field, and to consider<br />
in a helpful way the need and scope for further Commonwealth<br />
assistance to Agricultural Extension Services.<br />
We regard the whole matter of extension services as of<br />
major importance to higher production and lower costs.<br />
ROADS We have enormously increased Commonwealth aid for<br />
roads from Å 8,767,000, when we came in, to 058M. In<br />
addition, we are providing this year fLIOM. -for Northern<br />
beef roads, roads in the Territories, and so on. Already<br />
the Commonwealth, without a primary responsibility, finds<br />
more than a third of the total expenditure on Australian<br />
roads. We are working on a new scheme to take the place of<br />
the existing legislation which expires in the middle of 1964.<br />
Proposals will be put before the States early next year.<br />
Under the current legislation a total of Å 250M. has been<br />
granted to the States for roads over a five-year period. We<br />
intend that over the next five years our contribution will be<br />
not less than Å 350M.<br />
Many people and organisations have advocated the<br />
establishment of a national roads authority to provide a<br />
