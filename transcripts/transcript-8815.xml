SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NATIONAL AGENDA FOR WOMEN<br />
BANKSTOWN TOWN HALL, SYDNEY<br />
FEBRUARY 1993<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
including the Mayor of Bankstown<br />
Ministerial and Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I am very pleased to have an opportunity to address a great gathering of women so<br />
early in the election campaign.<br />
Of course, when this event to launch the New National Agenda for Women was<br />
first planned, none of us knew it would take place during a campaign. Even I<br />
didn't know!<br />
But in fact it makes very little difference.<br />
The thoughts I want to share with you today are not campaign-driven.<br />
would have delivered the same speech had this launch been held two weeks ago.<br />
But I nevertheless appreciate having the chance to address the women of Australia<br />
in this election context because I suspect my remarks will get greater media<br />
coverage than they otherwise might.<br />
And I'm pleased about that.<br />
T'here are things I want to talk about today which I know are very important to<br />
women in this country, and it is important to me that as many women as possible<br />
get to hear about them.<br />
What brings us together today is the New National Agenda for Women the<br />
government's approach to striving for true equality between the sexes by year<br />
2000. </p>

It is a document that sets parameters rather than laying down a step-by-step<br />
approach. It identifies the issues Australian women care most deeply about and thus provides<br />
all Australians with guidance about how we should proceed in order that women<br />
may participate fully in all areas of our society.<br />
The framing of the document says a lot about how we in the Labor Party approach<br />
important issues such as these.<br />
The document is truly a democratic one.<br />
In order to find out what women thought about the issues and problems facing<br />
women today we listened, naturally enough, to the National Women's Consultative<br />
Council and the many other women's organisations which last year participated in<br />
a day-long " Renewal Forum" on the Agenda.<br />
But we did more than that. We also listen to women who do not beong to<br />
organisations and do not have a voice when documents such as National Agendas<br />
are drawn up.<br />
We commissioned research which sought the opinions of ordinary Australian<br />
women.<br />
We talked with waitresses, cleaners, primary school teachers, shop assistants,<br />
mothers at home, office workers.<br />
We asked them how they felt about their lives and we also asked them what they<br />
thought of government programs meant to benefit them.<br />
What they told us was not exactly what we hoped to hear.<br />
Many of them felt that governments, state and federal, were not responsive to their<br />
problems and needs.<br />
We learned a lot about what women today are thinking and feeling and we took it<br />
very seriously.<br />
We already knew how concerned women ( and men) were about unemployment.<br />
How they feel for those without jobs, and how they worry about maybe losing<br />
their own.<br />
We already knew this, but we had it reinforced for us. [ it003/ 0I 1 </p>

We are doing what we can to confront the realities of unemployment.<br />
We are providing a social net to ease the hardship.<br />
We are providing as many training opportunities as we can.<br />
Above all, as I outlined yesterday in my statement " Investing in the Nation" 1we<br />
are doing all we can to create growth.<br />
We learned something else from listening to Australian women.<br />
We learned that women are very likely to make distinctions between the issues<br />
that are important to them as Australians as citizens, if you like and those that<br />
are important to them as women.<br />
And it is on those latter issues that I would like to spend some time this morning.<br />
There were three areas women unanimously nominated as being of pressing<br />
concern to them; these were child-care, violence against women and women's<br />
health. Before I set out how we intend to respond to these three subjects, I think it is worth<br />
reflecting on changes that have occurred in the lives of women and men but<br />
especially women over recent decades.<br />
In fact if we look back over the past hundred years, we can take enormous pride in<br />
a record of progress and achievement in the area of women's rights ( as they used to<br />
be called) which very early on earned Australia a reputation as a world leader.<br />
Next year all Australians will join South Australians in celebrating their women's<br />
suffrage centenary.<br />
South Australia was the first state to give Australian women the vote at a time<br />
when New Zealand and two of the United States were the only places in the world<br />
to do so.<br />
Australia continues to set the pace for other democracies when it comes to status of<br />
women issues.<br />
Recently the International Labour Organisation singled out Australia's<br />
achievement in reducing the gap between women's and men's wages.<br />
Under our centralised wage fixing system, and with the protection of awards,<br />
women's earnings are now 93 per cent of men's. </p>

4<br />
In countries like the US and Japan, without such protection, women still earn only<br />
around 70 cents for every dollar men take home.<br />
And the important point is, that contrary to the dire predictions when equal pay<br />
was first put into awards, even though women in Australia are paid relatively more<br />
in relation to men than women in most countries, their employment prospects have<br />
not suffered.<br />
On the contrary, growth in female employment has been exceptionally fast in<br />
Australia. In the past ten years the number of women in the labour force has increased by<br />
almost 40 per cent.<br />
What has happened in Australia over the past decade has been a unique partnership<br />
between the women's movement and the Labor Government, a partnership that has<br />
achieved much of which we both can be proud.<br />
Without it, we would not have our pioneering record of legislative achievements<br />
like the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action law.<br />
Nor would 77 per cent of girls stay at school until Year 12. In 1982 only 40 per<br />
cent did.<br />
We can be proud that more than 52 per cent of enrolments in higher education now<br />
are women, up from 46 per cent in 1982.<br />
And that more women are being elected to public office and I see many of<br />
Labor's federal and state parliamentarians here today, as well as quite a few who I<br />
hope will be joining us in Canberra after March 13!<br />
Indeed, when we talk about the dramatic changes in women's lives over the past<br />
century, we must not overlook the even more rapid pace of change just over the<br />
past decade.<br />
Indeed the 1980s may well turn out to be the time when the revolution in women's<br />
lives passed that point of no return, that point at which women decided they liked<br />
their new found freedom and opportunities and had no intention whatsoever of<br />
giving them up.<br />
This certainly was the virtually unanimous view of the women who participated in<br />
the research described earlier.<br />
These women, no matter what their age, their education, their marital or maternal<br />
status or their present circumstances, were totally agreed on one thing: they were<br />
better off than their mothers had been. </p>

They valued the choices women have today, including the greater economic<br />
independence more and more women have.<br />
Even though many women felt they paid a price in terms of the stresses involved in<br />
trying to juggle their various roles and responsibilities, they wouldn't turn back the<br />
clock for anything.<br />
I sense that many women today have an enthusiasm for their lives and the<br />
opportunities that are available to them that earlier generations lacked.<br />
An event like today's is a case in point.<br />
A day to think about the issues that as women you care about.<br />
I'm not overlooking the men in the audience and I thank them for coming so that<br />
I'm not the only male here today! but today is a day for women to take particular<br />
pride in.<br />
And a day to remember as the one when we decided to do something about many<br />
of those issues.<br />
Yesterday I released a major economic statement which contained, among other<br />
things, a number of important initiatives on child care.<br />
I included those initiatives in that statement, rather than the very tempting option<br />
of " saving them up" for today, because think it is time that child-care was<br />
included amongst our mainstream economic issues.<br />
Child care should be treated with the same seriousness as education or aged care.<br />
The time is long past, as far as I am concerned, where child care was tagged as " a<br />
woments issue"~ or a " welfare issue" and only attracted the crumbs from the table<br />
where the budget banquet was enjoyed.<br />
I know how paramount an issue child-care is for women.<br />
Without it, mothers have little choice about employment or study or training.<br />
It really is the gate-way to choice, and to independence.<br />
That is why have decided to give child-care such a big budget boost, to ensure it<br />
is never again starved for funds.<br />
For the first time in the history of child care policy we have addressed both the big<br />
picture and the smaller details. L1 006/ 011 </p>
<p>01/ 09 * 94 13: 48 *&amp; 06 273 2923PM RESOFC 1O/ OI<br />
6<br />
We have addressed the three big questions of supply, affordability and quality.<br />
We have also dealt with the smaller but no less important issues of arrangements<br />
for sick kids, playgroups, and wholesale sales tax and Fringe Benefits Tax<br />
exemptions for child care.<br />
As I said yesterday at the National Press Club: these measures move child care into<br />
the 21st century.<br />
We as a nation can afford good child-care and the time has come to provide it.<br />
At the same time, we need to recognise that women's child-care needs are neither<br />
uniform nor identical.<br />
T1here are new choices and new patterns in women's lives today.<br />
Many women are choosing to stay home while their children are young, although<br />
most will return to the labour market at some time in the future.<br />
The point is, though, that policy needs to recognise and respond to these patterns.<br />
It is no longer good enough, if ever it was, to say that any given woman is either in<br />
the workforce or in the home.<br />
Chances are these days, over the course of her lifetime, she will spend periods of<br />
time doing both.<br />
But during her period at home she is entitled to an acknowledgment and respect<br />
that perhaps was not always forthcoming in the past.<br />
At the same time, women at home often can do with some practical assistance.<br />
The increased funds we have allocated to playgroups, and the occasional care<br />
places will help provide a break for women at home while they shop or go to the<br />
doctor. In time, I hope we might be able to take other measures to assist women caring for<br />
children at home.<br />
Perhaps the most sobering message to have come from our consultations and our<br />
research was the level of fear felt by women in Australia as a result of violence on<br />
the streets and in the home.<br />
I find such violence appalling and intolerable. P51 PRESS OFFICEQ007/ 011 </p>

As a society we must do all that we can to eradicate it, but we also need to be<br />
realistic and to recognise that we need to provide safe havens for women and<br />
children while we work through ways to make this country less violent.<br />
Today I announce several measures to this end.<br />
Upon re-election, we will establish a referral program in each state for women<br />
escaping domestic violence in rural and remote areas.<br />
This special program would provide practical help to women and children in<br />
remote areas in the form of a 008 phone number to call for help, and payment of<br />
transport to escape violent situations.<br />
We will also extend the life of the National Committee on Violence Against<br />
Women. Late last year the Committee produced a highly praised report, the National<br />
Strategy on Violence Against Women, and I believe that the work of this<br />
Committee in maintaining a national focus on this issue is too important for it to<br />
be disbanded.<br />
Like many others, I was recently shocked to read that a judge, during a sexual<br />
assault trial, had explicitly condoned the use of violence by a man against his wife.<br />
I do not believe that reflects current community attitudes.<br />
It is intolerable that women should continue to suffer prejudice or injustice of this<br />
kind in our courts or anywhere else.<br />
I am pleased to inform you that earlier this week, just before the Parliament was<br />
prorogued, my colleague Michael Duffy the Attorney -General, took an initiative<br />
which I trust will be the first step in ending such unfair and archaic attitudes<br />
We are committed to ensuring Australia's laws and legal practices reflect changing<br />
community attitudes and, to this end, the Attorney has asked the Australian Law<br />
Reform Commission to report to him on ways of ensuring equality before the law.<br />
Justice Elizabeth Evatt will head this inquiry.<br />
Her widespread legal experience within Australia and internationally makes her a<br />
most appropriate person to conduct this report.<br />
I look forward to her Interim Report later this year.<br />
am also able to inform you that the government has provided funds to the<br />
Australian Institute of Judicial Administration to develop courses for magistrates 200O8/ 01 I<br />

and judges to help them identify prejudices that might impact on their judicial<br />
conduct towards women.<br />
' This program is to be developed by a Committee headed by Justice Deidre<br />
O'Connor, President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.<br />
The third issue singled out as being of greatest concern to women was their health.<br />
The Labor Government has had a good record in initiatives in women's health.<br />
Overall, we have allocated $ 123 million to health services specifically for women,<br />
especially in the area of prevention of breast and cervical cancer.<br />
Today Brian Howe, the Minister for Health, informed me that the National<br />
Women's Health Program will continue for a further 12 months at the current level<br />
of resourcing.<br />
He has also developed a National Osteoporosis Policy to meet the concerns of<br />
women whose family history suggests they might be at risk of osteoporosis by<br />
providing a Medicare rebate for a bone density test.<br />
In an important, and unprecedented, step Mr Howe has also decided to institute a<br />
major longitudinal study into women's health.<br />
For too long, we have assumed that health studies did not need to be gender<br />
specific. The result has been that we know very little about the medium and long term<br />
effects on women's health of, for instance, the contraceptive pill or Hormone<br />
Replacement Therapy.<br />
Special studies of women of different ages will teach us a great deal and, in time,<br />
give us a far greater understanding of the health needs of women at various stages<br />
of biological development than we presently possess.<br />
Finally, two measures to increase women's political and economic participation in<br />
our society.<br />
I know that some of the major women's organisations are concerned that women<br />
workers might be disadvantaged by the enterprise agreements and workplace<br />
bargains that are the new prototype for industrial relations.<br />
Let me take a moment to state here that I am categorically opposed to the<br />
reduction in women's wages that the Coalition's abolition of penalty rates would<br />
cause. </p>

And of course it is mostly the lowest paid women who would suffer, the waitresses<br />
and shop assistants and hospital cleaners who are dependent on penalties to boost<br />
their earnings.<br />
But professionals like nurses would also have their earnings savaged.<br />
I have seen figures that suggest that a RN Level I with one year's experience<br />
working two ten-hour weekend shifts would lose $ 155.13 of her current total<br />
wage of $ 403.33 if penalties were abolished.<br />
This is unconscionable.<br />
Making hard working and low paid women bear the brunt of Dr Hewson's IR<br />
experiments. We will do everything in our power to ensure such women are protected.<br />
We will spend $ 1 million to establish Working Women's Centres, initially in four<br />
states, to provide advice and assistance to women on workplace issues, especially<br />
on enterprise bargaining and access to training.<br />
I hope these centres can be up and running soon after we are re-elected because,<br />
with the Liberals gaining power in several states, women are going to need them.<br />
I want to conclude by making one final announcement, one that I hope will be well<br />
received by today's audience.<br />
For too long the major women's organisations in Australia have had to struggle<br />
along 0on paltry amounts of funding.<br />
It is time to enable women's organisations to operate with the same<br />
professionalism and expertise afforded to conservation, ethnic and other<br />
organisations by dint of their receiving more realistic levels of funding.<br />
I propose to increase the program of operational grants for women's organisations<br />
to $ 1 million a year, a more appropriate amount in view of the important work<br />
your organisations undertake on behalf of women.<br />
The new National Agenda is an achievement of which we can all be proud.<br />
It is a non-partisan document, one that sets out to articulate the various aspirations<br />
of Australian women today.<br />
Perhaps the overriding aspiration is the one that is expressed by the document's<br />
title: Shaping and Sharing the Future. PM PRESS OFFICE9010/ 011 </p>
<p>01/ 09 ' 94 13: 52' 06 273 2923PM PRESS OFFICE<br />
This title came to us from the women we talked to. It was their expression of their<br />
desire to be part of the nation we are forging together.<br />
While they and we recognise that often special programs are required to meet<br />
special needs, at the same time all of us, women and men, want to join together<br />
making a richer and fairer future for us all. Z011/ 011 </p>
