CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL 10 P. M.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FABIAN SOCIETY CENTENARY DINNER MELBOURNE 18 MAY 1984<br />
For any Association or secular institution to reach its<br />
first century is noteworthy and, in our times, remarkable<br />
enough in itself.<br />
That alone would be sufficient reason for us to join<br />
together tonight in this celebration of the centenary of the<br />
Fabian Society, brought into formal existence in London a<br />
hundred years ago this month.<br />
And, incidentally, I trust it will be noted in the<br />
appropriate quarters that those of us here tonight<br />
associated with the Australian Labor Party and the<br />
Austr lien Labor Government have been so far able to<br />
overcome our notorious prejudices as to celebrate a British<br />
centenary and a British institution indeed, in many<br />
respects, a quintessential British institution.<br />
But seriously, I invite you all to consider the wider and<br />
deeper-significance of this achievement because it goes<br />
far beyond the Fabian Society's more survival In the<br />
technical and temporal sense.<br />
For tonight we are marking the centenary of a Society and an<br />
idea which, of its very nature, could not at its birth be<br />
thought to have had much chance of survival at all much<br />
less aurvive into the very and of the 20th century.<br />
For this was, and is, that most difficult things of all to<br />
maintain a political association. It was founded as, and<br />
remains, a purely voluntary association of lfkce-minded men<br />
and women, bound by no dogma or creed or fixed body of<br />
doctrine. Unable to offer its members inducement or<br />
rewards, or to impose discipline or enforce rules; an<br />
association based entirely on morel and intellectual ground<br />
and, by the very essence of its nature and purpose, having<br />
only the loosest structure and formal organisation.<br />
I I a </p>
<p>Further, the century since 1884 has been the moat turbulent<br />
and eventful in human history, a century of tremendous<br />
change in human attitudes and standards, a revolutionary era<br />
in which no political, social or economic assumption made a<br />
century ago has gone unchallenged, and few, if any, have not<br />
been fundamentally changed.<br />
Yet the Fabian Society and its original ideals endure.<br />
That a Society so conceived could survive in such a century<br />
and survive with continuing vigour is surely striking<br />
testimony to the enduring strength of the cause with which<br />
it has been so closely identified and to which it has<br />
contributed so much -the cause of social democracy.<br />
I deliberately use the words " the cause with which it is<br />
identified", because the Fabian Society did not and does not<br />
claim to be a cause in Itself.<br />
Rather, it was called into existence to represent and<br />
promote an ides and an ideal and, most important a<br />
method, an approach by which that idea could beat be<br />
implemented and by which the ideals of social democracy<br />
could be given practical effect.<br />
And almost from the beginning, its founders envisaged that<br />
the vehicle would be a labour party long before the<br />
British Labour Party as such existed.<br />
Sidney Webb one of the founders of the Fabian Society and<br />
for so long its presiding genius described the process in<br />
this wayi<br />
" From 1887, the Fabians looked to the formation of a<br />
strong and independent Labour Party. we did all we<br />
could to foster and assist, in succession, the<br />
Independent Labour Party, then the Labour Representation<br />
Committee and then the Labour Party but we also<br />
eat ourselves to detach the concept of socialism from<br />
such extraneous ideas as suddenness and simultaneity of<br />
change, violence and compulsion, and atheism or<br />
anti-clericalism nor did we confine our<br />
proapganda to ' the slowly emergi~ ng labour party, or to<br />
those who were prepared to call themselves socialists,<br />
or to the manual workers or to any particular class."<br />
So, from the beginning, the Society drew its strength from<br />
its vision of the future of Labor and the Labor Party.<br />
But beyond this fundamental strength, many factors have<br />
contributed to the strength and survival of the Society. </p>
<p>3.<br />
First, we cannot ignore the personal element that<br />
extraordinary galaxy of political, intellectual and literary<br />
talent which made up the firmament of Fabianism the Webba,<br />
Graham Welles, George Bernard Shaw; then later Tom Mann, who<br />
helped introduce Fabianiam to Australia; then later on again<br />
people like Bertrand Ruesell, G. D. H. Cole$ Harold Laski and<br />
R. H. Tawnoy.<br />
Many may think that, in terms of hia contribution to Fabian<br />
philosophy and social democratic thought, Tawney was the<br />
greatest of them all. Certainly his great work Equality<br />
stands as the definitive exposition of the true meaning of<br />
social democracy, both as an ideal and a practical program.<br />
Another source of the Society's strength was what we may<br />
call the medolgy~ of Fabinaiam -the primacy given to<br />
facts, kw-egproper research and solid information as<br />
the basis for action whether political, social or economic<br />
action. It was the recognition, as Beatrice Webb put it,<br />
that: " Reform will not be brought about by shouting.<br />
What is needed is hard thinking"..<br />
And the third and greatest and most enduring source of the<br />
influence of Fabianism was the idea of practical relevance.<br />
And this is the very essence of Fabianisip.<br />
It is the recognition that the commitment to democracy and<br />
democratic means is fundamental.<br />
It is the recognition that this fundamental commitment<br />
imposes on social democrats obligations and restraints in<br />
terms both means and ends.<br />
It is the recognition, as I myself put it in the " Resolution<br />
of Conflict" lectures the Boyer Lectures, in 1979 " of<br />
the need for those who would advocate change to temper. their<br />
fervour with a sense of gradualism".<br />
Arid it cannot be emphasised, too strongly or too often, that<br />
this approach is not a matter of mere pragmatism. It is<br />
equally a matter of principle.<br />
It is a principle which follows inexorably from our<br />
commitment to democracy.<br />
And it is a principle which lies at the very heart, not only<br />
of Fabianism, but social democracy throughout the world.<br />
It is of course the classic concept of Fabianiam the<br />
inevitability of gradualness.<br />
And nothing is more widely misunderstood or more frequently<br />
misrepresented. </p>
<p>It was never conceived as B Justification for opportunism.<br />
It was, and is, a principle of necessity.<br />
The principle was first and beat propounded by Sidney Wnhh<br />
himself. SPAalcing ae Pzrooident ul' the British Labour<br />
Executive at the Party Conference in 1923, he said:<br />
" Let me Insist on what our opponents habitually ignore,<br />
and, indeed, what they seem intellectually incapable of<br />
understanding, namely the inevitable gradualness of our<br />
scheme of change. The very fact that Socialists have<br />
both principles and a programme appears to confuse<br />
nearly all their critics.<br />
Webb continued:<br />
If we state our principles, we are told ' That is not<br />
practicable'. When we recite our programme the<br />
objection is ' That is not Socialism'. But why, because<br />
we are idealists, should we be supposed to be idiote?<br />
For the Labour Party, it must be plain, Socialism is<br />
rooted in Democracy; which necessarily compels us to<br />
recognise that every step towards our goal is dependent<br />
on gaining the assent and support of at least a<br />
numerical majority of the whole people. Thus, even i~ f<br />
we aimed at revolutionising everything at once, we<br />
should necessarily be compelled to make each particular<br />
change only at the time, and to the extent, and in the<br />
manner, which ten of fifteen million electors, in all<br />
sorts of * conditions, of all aorts of temperaments, from<br />
Lend's End to the Orkneys, could be brought to consent<br />
to it.,,<br />
That was Webb in Britain In 1923. It is as relevant and<br />
true in Australia in 1984. For it represents an unchanging<br />
truth and a fixed principle for the Labor Party and social<br />
democrats everywhere.<br />
And. I repeat and'emphasis it goes beyond pragmatism; it is<br />
the principle which flows from our fundamental commitment to<br />
democracy. I suppose there is no greater hero in the pantheon of<br />
radicaL reform thin Aneurin Bevan, who was also a great<br />
Fabian. He was never accused of selling out, or selling the<br />
cause short. He was never denounced as an opportunist or<br />
derided as a pramgatist. </p>
<p>Thirt-y yeas. uv arL,, r WebbBs analysis which I have just quoted,<br />
Bevan wrote this magnificent confession of his faith:<br />
" The philosophy of democratic Socialism is essentially<br />
cool in temper. it sees society in its context with<br />
nature and is conscious of the limitations imposed by<br />
physical conditions. It sees the individual in his<br />
context with society and is therefore compassionate and<br />
tolerant. Because it knows that all political action<br />
must be a choice between a number of possible<br />
alternatives it eschews all absolute prescriptions and<br />
final decisions.<br />
Consequently it is not able to offer the thrill of the<br />
complete abandonment of private judgment, which is the<br />
allure of modern Soviet Communism and of Faacism, its<br />
running mate It accepts the obligation to<br />
choose among different kinds of social action and in so<br />
doing to bear the pains or rejecting what is not<br />
practicable or less desirable<br />
It seeks the truth in any given situation, knowing all<br />
the time that if this be pushed too far it falls into<br />
error Its chief enemy is vacillation, for it<br />
must achieve passion in action in the pursuit of<br />
qualified judgments. It must know how to enjoy the<br />
struggle, whilst recognising that progress is not the<br />
elimination of struggle but rather a change in its<br />
ter Msn.<br />
In this brief review, I have said enough to indicate the<br />
spirit, ideals, methods and objectives of the Society whose<br />
centenary we celebrate tonight.<br />
I have so far referred only in passing to its Australian<br />
contribution, as part of its general contribution to the<br />
cause of Labor and social democracy.<br />
But Australian Fabianism and Australian Fabians have made a<br />
specific and significant contribution to the Australian<br />
Labor movement and the Austraian Labor Party.<br />
The circumstances in which the Society in Australia has<br />
operatled have, of'course, differed considerably from those<br />
of the parent body. So too has its role.<br />
The Australian Labor Party is many years older than the<br />
British Labour Party. Our Parliamentary success came much<br />
earlier And has been much move con3istent than that of the<br />
British Labour Party. That early and consistent success,<br />
combined with our historic origins in the trade union.<br />
movement, meant an emphasis on practical achievement above<br />
theory and doctrine. </p>
<p>6.<br />
And indeed, the Australian men and women of the 1890' s and<br />
the early 1900' s had already recognised the inevitability of<br />
gradualness and applied it in practice, tit a time when, for<br />
the British Labour Party, it was merely a statement of<br />
principle for future Labour governments, yet to be elected.<br />
A further difference in the role of Fabianism in Australia<br />
lay in the nature of aur Federal system and I mean, not<br />
only the Federal nature of the Australian Constitution, but<br />
the Federal structure of the Australian Labor Party itself.<br />
It may even be that the comparative success of the Society<br />
in Melbourne relative to other capitals reflected something<br />
of our colonial past. It certainly established Melbourne in<br />
its role as the headquarters of the radical tradition in<br />
Australia.<br />
But despite the differences, Fabianism has made a valuable<br />
and enduring contribution to social democracy in Australia#<br />
in both thought and action.<br />
Fabian Societies were formed here as early as 1896.<br />
As Frank Crean has recalled, the present Society, the Fabian<br />
Society of Victoria, now, I am pleased to say, properly<br />
named the Fabian Society of Australia was formed in 1947.<br />
And of course that was a very significant year in the<br />
history of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian<br />
Labor movement.<br />
I hasten to say that I'm not suggesting that Importance<br />
derives anything from the fact that 1947 happened to be the<br />
year I joined the Labor Party in Perth.<br />
But the year 1947 represented both a high tide, and a<br />
turning of the tide, for post war Labor, and for the Chifley<br />
Labor Government. It was for the movement as a whole a year<br />
of great optimism and enthusiasm and achievement. The work<br />
of post war reconstruction was going on apace. Full<br />
employment was established as a national principle and a<br />
national goal.<br />
But 1947 was also's year when the challenge against bank<br />
nationslisation forced on us a realisation of' the<br />
restrictions and restraints imposed by the Constitution, and<br />
in particular by Section 92.<br />
Consequently, this led to a rethinking of our approach.<br />
Because, unless the Platform was just to stagnate into<br />
irrelevance, the search had to be made for alternative means<br />
of achieving our objectives. </p>
<p>And in that search and it was a search and a development<br />
of policy that went on for more than 20 years Fabians were<br />
in the forefront Fabians like Frank Crean, Jim Cairns, Kim<br />
Beazisy, Race Mathews, and not least our own Fabius Maximus<br />
Gough Whitlam himself.<br />
Throughout the long years in the wilderness, the Society<br />
played a valuable role in producing and dissiminating<br />
information and ideas, and in promoting dialogue.<br />
It preserved the Fabian tradition of research as the basis<br />
for reform.<br />
There were times in the bitter years after the Split when<br />
the Fabian Society seemed almost a lone voice for sanityt<br />
civility, realism and genuine idealism amongst us in<br />
Victoria.<br />
But above all, the ongoing importance of Fabianiam, in<br />
Australia has been to help bring to our movement, and our<br />
cause, that quality which I said before was the essence of<br />
social democracy the need for a sense of relevance, in the<br />
application of our ideas and our Ideals to practical<br />
purposes and achievable goals.<br />
And in this I gladly acknowledge the debt of my own<br />
Govsrnmont to Fabisnism.<br />
Earlier I dealt at some length with the principle of the<br />
Inevitability of gradualness.<br />
There was another important idea a method more than a<br />
principle which became closely sssoc a ad with Fabianiam.<br />
Sidney Webb called It " permeation".<br />
Today it would be called " consensus".<br />
Webb put It this wayz<br />
" Moat reformers think that all they have got to do in a<br />
political democracy is to obtain a majority. This is a<br />
profound mistake. What has to be changed is not only<br />
thei-vote that Is cast, but also the mental climate in<br />
which Parliament and the Government both live and work."<br />
That I find, to be an accurate description of the approach I<br />
and my colleagues have tried to bring to the affairs of this<br />
nation in our first term of office. From the National<br />
Summit on, we have attempted to transform the atmosphere of<br />
politics the background, the assumptions, the shared<br />
information and perceptions of common goals, through which<br />
decisions can be made, not just by the Government and<br />
Parliament but by key groups and Interests like business and<br />
unions.<br />
I </p>
<p>.8<br />
Of course there are some who will misunderstand or<br />
misrepresent the nature of this approach and the meaning of'<br />
consensus. It was ever thus.<br />
Beatrice Webb describes in her diary of their Melbourne<br />
visit in 1898 a meeting with people whom she only identifies<br />
as " some Victorian socialists" from her unflattering<br />
description clearly not members of the Labor Party -and<br />
writes: " Sidney tried to explain the Fabian policy of<br />
permeation, with the result that the Chairman, in his<br />
concluding remarks$ recommended the meeting to adopt Mr<br />
Webb's suggestion of taking the capitalist down a back<br />
strebL and then knocking him on the head."<br />
We all have to face the fact that if our Government is to<br />
make really greet and worthwhile reforms reforms that will<br />
endure, reforms that will permanently change this nation<br />
then it is not enough simply to obtain a temporary majority<br />
at an election, or even successive elections.<br />
For our reforms to endure, the whole mood and mind and<br />
attitudes of the nation must be permanently changed.<br />
Certainly, we are proceeding to implement the policy an<br />
which we were elected and the platform of the Party with a<br />
thoroughness, I believe, not excelled by any previous Labor<br />
Government in our history. But-that specific task must go<br />
hand in'hand with the more general and deeper, longer range<br />
task the task of establishing# in the mood and mind of<br />
this nation, permanent acceptance of the naturalness and<br />
Inevitability of change and reform, as the authentic<br />
Australian way of life..<br />
And that, for the first time in our history, is what this<br />
Labor Government is attempting.<br />
Let me conclude:<br />
An occasion like this serves to bring home to us all, one of<br />
the gteat truths dbout our cause In Australia -the cause of<br />
Labor and social democracy.<br />
And that is the continuity of our movement and the<br />
continuity of our role in our nation.<br />
The Party itself is a hundred years old i~ n 1991. The Labor<br />
movement is already wall over the century. I.' </p>
<p>9.<br />
One of the great paradoxes of Australian politics is that<br />
the parties and forces of conservatism and reaction for<br />
all their self-proclaimed loyalty to tradition have no<br />
real continuity and no true sense of continuity.<br />
And without a sense of continuity in the case of<br />
individuals or parties or movements or nations there can<br />
be no true sense of identity.<br />
And I believe it is precisely because our adversaries lack<br />
that sense of their own continuity, and in a deep sense,<br />
their own identity, they are obliged to seek it outside<br />
themselves in other insitutions and even other nations.<br />
And that I believe explains, at least in part, much of their<br />
current conduct their lurches, not only in search of a<br />
policy, but in search of an identity.<br />
It is, by contrast our own sense of continuity, as a<br />
government, a movement, a party, a cause which provides us<br />
with the stability and strength to overcome the countless<br />
setbacks we have suffered and, equally, in the days of<br />
triumph, to live up to the motto set for itself by the<br />
Fabian Society one hundred years ago:<br />
" For the right moment you must wait, as Fabius did, most<br />
patiently, when warring against Hannibal, though many<br />
censured his delayas; but when the time comes you must<br />
strike hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in<br />
vain and fruitless." </p>
