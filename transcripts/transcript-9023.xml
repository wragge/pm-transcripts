PRIME MINISTER 139<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
COMMENT ON THIE WEST AUSTRALIAN MABO LEGISLATION<br />
Thc Mabo legislation introduced by the West Australian Government is draconian and<br />
discriminatory, may well be invalid in whole or in part under the RDA, and will result<br />
in massive uncertainty.<br />
* It is a recipe for endless dispute and l itigation, which will bog down land dealings<br />
and smother industry and investment<br />
* it fails even to validate pre-1975 grants and state legislation ( unlike the<br />
Commonwealth proposal); there will be considerable doubt whether this validation<br />
is successful<br />
* there is no clear means of determining who has native title and where<br />
* there is no clcar means of determining what rights are available under native title or<br />
the statutory substitute<br />
* the new traditional usage rights can only be defined by a court where there is a<br />
conflict; this is a recipe rot increasing community disputes and ongoing uncertainty<br />
* the Bill gives Aboriginal people only 12 months to claim compensation for<br />
extinguishment of native title; the only way for Aboriginal people to protect their<br />
rights would be to swamip the compensation system with claims whenever a grant<br />
is made<br />
* the Bill extinguishes a title which under the High Court doctrine could run as high<br />
as exclusive possession, and replaces it with a statutory title deliberately pitched at<br />
the lowest imaginable level of rights to land<br />
* the Bill allows freehold or leasehold to be issued where there is native title and to<br />
wipe out Aboriginal rights; this would make Aboriginal title the only form of<br />
interest in relation to land which could he taken away and given to a third party<br />
without compulsory acquisition </p>
<p>a due process is denied; grants may be made irrespective of any court proceedings<br />
concerning rights of traditional usage<br />
4 the shabbiness is compounded by the schedulc of amendments to other WA Acts<br />
which can be used to deny holders of traditional usage rights important procedural<br />
protections available to other West Australians and give Aborigines no effective<br />
standing or avenue of appeal<br />
* the virtually unfcttcrvd discretion for Ministers to disregard Aboriginal interests<br />
raises serious questions about appropriate checks and balances in public<br />
administration<br />
* there has been not a shred of consultation with Aboriginal people<br />
* the Premier misrepresents important aspects of the Commonwealth proposal, e. g.<br />
hc alleges that it contains no capacity for Aboriginal people to obtain land rather<br />
than money as compensation.<br />
The Bill is an obstacle to the achievement of what Aboriginal people. industry and the<br />
community generally needed a just, workable and certain land management regi me<br />
which took account of Mabo.<br />
It would do damage to Austratlia's international reputation. It would cost the country<br />
in terms of international as weli as domestic investment.<br />
It would polarise the Austr-alian community. It is the antithesis of reconciliation, and a<br />
throwback to an earlier era in which Aboriginal rights were steamrolled whenever<br />
governments or interest groups judged it expedient to do so.<br />
A right which, by definition, has survived for 200 years and derives from occupation of<br />
land for thousands of years before that would be extinguished not much more than a<br />
year after being recognised by the highest Court in Australia.<br />
It has sold out the interests of West Australians Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.<br />
The Commonwealth Government cannot afford to see economic development in a<br />
third of the continent brought to a halt and will protect the national intere'st. Nor is the<br />
Government prepared to stand by and see Aboriginal people disposed of land to which<br />
they have native title.<br />
I reiterate my commitment to a national approach to Mabo which will work in the<br />
interests of all Australians. The Bill shortly to be introduced into the Federal<br />
Parliament would be balanced, fair and workable,<br />
The West Australian Government should get on board.<br />
CANBERRA November 1993 </p>
