PRIME MINISTER FEBJRUARY 1980<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF NEWSVOICE' X01<br />
The latest jobless figures out today put Australia mployed<br />
last month at 382,000, about 6.8% of the full-time workforce. The<br />
Bureau of Statistics says a jump of 27,000 on the December figures<br />
was caused mainly by school leavers. There was a slight improvement<br />
against the January figures last year. According to Mr Viner, the<br />
Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Australia is starting 1980<br />
on a much better basis than last year. In Perth, Chris Hunt asked<br />
Mr Viner what he thought of Government critics who predicted h million<br />
unemployed. Mr Viner<br />
Wtheilnlk hetrheo swee carriet, i cst hec opueladk refaidg urteh eifro r crtyhse tasle asboanl l atl et3 82a, l0o0n0e, thsoe irI don't<br />
statistics very well. There's no way we'll reach 500,000.<br />
Chris Hunt<br />
Would you go so far as to say that we've definitely reached a bottoming<br />
out and that perhaps we're on the edge of a distinct improvement.<br />
Mr Viner<br />
In Sydney the other day, I pointed out that there are very strong<br />
indications within the economy, that the economy will improve<br />
throughout 1980 and that that will reflect itself into a continually<br />
improving employment market. In 1979 we had a very strong rise of<br />
122,000 in the employed labour force, at the beginning of the year I<br />
don't think anybody really anticipated that and that reflects the<br />
growing strength of our economy.<br />
Labor's spokesman on employment, Mr Nick Young, said he wasn't<br />
surprised by January's figures. He told Alister Young in Melbourne,<br />
he'd expected no improvement and there virtually was none.<br />
Mr Young<br />
We said last year unless the Government spent some money on job<br />
creation programmes we'd be heading into a record of high unemployment<br />
and thats exactly what we've got. You've got to add these figures to<br />
the figures put out by the Bureau of Statistics on those people who<br />
have given up hope for a job altogether. Theres no doubt that we'll<br />
have well over 500,000 now that would like to go to work.<br />
Alister Young<br />
The figures do indicate there has been some small drop over the same<br />
period last year, whats your reaction to that.<br />
Mr Young<br />
A drop in these figures of about 3,000 out of a total of about 450,000<br />
odd so its insignificant as far as the improvement is concerned. It<br />
just exposes the rhetoric of Mr Viner and Mr Fraser and how false that<br />
is. The fact is the Government doesn't give a damn about those people ./ 2 </p>
<p>who are unemployed and intends to do nothing about it.<br />
Wool handlers in 3 cities began walking off the job today in protest over<br />
the upholding of an appeal lodged by the Wool Brokers Federation agaj nst<br />
wage rises of up to $ 15.90 awarded by the Arbitration Commission.<br />
The latest reports show more than 700 wool handlers in Sydney, Melbourne<br />
and Newcastle are now on strike and more are expected to go out tomorrow.<br />
This report from Alister Young in Melbourne.. A federal secretary of.' the<br />
storeman and packers Union, Simon Green, predicted last night the upholdin(<br />
of the appeal would spell the end of wage indexation. His argument is<br />
that no matter what evidence is presented in support of wage rises<br />
through work value exercises, the amount awarded is preset the community<br />
standard between $ 8 and In his opinion, this makes a mockery of the<br />
wage fixing system. And thats the matter being discussed at present by<br />
union heads at a meeting now underway in Melbourne. The meeting is<br />
expected to draw up a plan of action to firstly consider ways of overturning<br />
the appeal benches decision and secondly, how best to pursue the<br />
claims for its members in the oil, tobacco, container terminal and paint<br />
industries. If the Storeman and Packers Union decides to pursue the<br />
claims outside the wage indexation system, they are hoping for support<br />
from the ACTU at its executive meeting next week. Meanwhile. the wool<br />
workers are expected to meet around the country tomorrow to decide where<br />
and how they can reverse the appeal benches decision and win back the<br />
$ 15.90 awarded by Deputy President Mr Justice Staples. Alister Young,<br />
Melbourne. Hundreds of firefighters in Victoria are battling two big bushfires<br />
which are burning out of control.<br />
Hopes seem to be growing daily that the 50 American hostages in Tehran<br />
are close to being released. They've been locked up.-now for 102 days,<br />
but Geoff MacMullan says the lastest news conference given by President<br />
Carter reinforces the view that a breakthrough in negotiations isn't<br />
far off.<br />
The Deputy Opposition Leader, Mr Lionel Bowen, says Australian security<br />
is threatened more by events in Kampuchea than in. Afghanistan.<br />
Mr Bowen returned to Australia today after an Asian visit which included<br />
Hanoi and refugee camps in Thailand. Mr Bowen told Richard Palfreeman<br />
why the Kampuchean situation posed a greater threat-than the Russian<br />
invasion in Afghanistan.<br />
Mr Bowen<br />
Because you could get big power and super power involvement there<br />
immediately. You could get a Russian base established in the region.<br />
You have a war there already in Kampuchea, you have massive flights of<br />
people known as refugees or as other people call them illegal migrants.<br />
Everyone of those factors would not only affect the world it would<br />
affect Australia first.<br />
Question Why then is not Mr Fraser paying attention to this area of the world.<br />
Mr Bowen.:.<br />
I think he's frightened of it so he'll pay attention to some other area<br />
that might suit Australia and the United States. But this is a region<br />
which we were involved militarily in 1960 due to. Mr Fraser's own<br />
philosophy at that time, maybe its a guilty conscience but if he went<br />
back there today he'd see the horrific results of our involvement in<br />
those regions. Genocide in Kampuchea, millions of people displaced, </p>
<p>armies activily involved in warfare and no peace and stability in<br />
sight. Question What positive action then should Australia be taking to bring a degree<br />
of peace and stability to Kampuchea.<br />
Mr Bowen<br />
The only way to get peace and stability in any region. is to have<br />
dialogue with the people concerned. And I would think Australian<br />
Governments should immediately initiate some form of conference<br />
between those parties that would include, not exclude, Vietnamese,<br />
the Asian and anybody else we think that would assist. The idea<br />
is to neutralise Kampuchea, its important we don't recognise the<br />
horrific regime of Pol Pot, a well known communist whose responsible<br />
for the deaths of at least 3h million Kampucheans.<br />
Australia's largest mining house, CRA, has announced a record profit.<br />
CRA said today it made a profit of 135. million dollars in 1979.<br />
Booming world prices for copper, gold, lead and zinc were the main<br />
reasons. However the CRA result has also been kicked along by : lealthy<br />
rises from some of its other subsidiaries and associates. Bouganville<br />
Copper made a profit of 110 million dollars, Calmalco earned 59<br />
million dollars, Hamersley Iron made $ 31 million and Mary Kathleen<br />
Uranium $ 17 million.<br />
The Opposition leader Mr Hayden has criticised the ABC for its<br />
decision not to allow him full time to reply to Mr Frasers address<br />
to the nation last night. Mr Hayden put out a statement in Canberra<br />
describing the ABC's decision as dispicable. Barry Cassidy reports.<br />
Mr Hayden who is campagning in Western Australia said that Mr Fraser<br />
had clearly lent on the ABC Commissioners to avoid an open debate on<br />
an embarrassing issue. Australian participation in the Olympic Games.<br />
He said it was hypocritical absurdity to pretend that Mr Frasers<br />
address last night did not impinge on party political debate. He said<br />
it called for serious analysis on some important points. Mr Hayden<br />
said he wanted to make it plain to the ABC that it could not muzzle<br />
the Labor Party, he had approached all three commercial networks<br />
asking for equal time. one network had already agreed to telecast his<br />
address, he was confident the other stations would do likewise. He<br />
said it was a matter of national shame that the ABC did not have the<br />
integrity and respect for fair play that commercial stations had shown.<br />
Barry Cassidy in Canberra.<br />
The Winter Olympics have begun at Lake Placid in the United States.<br />
But an agency reports says they may become a fiasco because of chaos<br />
with the transport system. </p>
