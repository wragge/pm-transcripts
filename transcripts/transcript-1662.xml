ORLNING OF THE U. S. NAVAL COM.-UNICATION<br />
STATION AT NORTH-.' BST CAP:, W2ETLSTZRN AUSTRLIA<br />
16th SEPTEMBER, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime Yinister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Mr. Premier; Your Excellencies; Admiral Johnson and<br />
other distinguished United States Naval servicemen; the<br />
distinguished servicemen of Australian Forces present here;<br />
my Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues and the representative<br />
of the Opposition in the Federal and State Parliaments; and<br />
the very many distinguished guests, much too numerous for me<br />
to single out although no doubt the contribution which so many<br />
of you have made woul. d justify that; and you, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen and Boys and Girls:<br />
This is a notable and indeed a historic day in the<br />
history of our young nation. The station itself is located in<br />
an area which has already made some contribution to Australian<br />
history because not only do we stand at the most north-westerly<br />
point of our continent but Learmonth in the Second World War<br />
saw a happy comradeship of Australian and United States<br />
servicemen as our aircraft moved in and out into action from<br />
the Learmonth airport.<br />
And we recall here in Australia still with gratitude<br />
indeed we commemorate that notable occasion annually the<br />
critical Battle of the Coral Sea which virtually spared our<br />
country from a hostile invasion, thanks to the assistance and<br />
the might of the forces of the United States. And from the<br />
comradeship and partnership of that ' World * 4r pa-rticularly<br />
in this area of the world, although of course there had been<br />
a comradeship cemented in the First Wdorld Wdar, but it was in<br />
the Second World bbar that we came so close to each other as<br />
nati-ons. And we learned to value the more fully the friendship<br />
and the help that one could bring to the other. Flowing from<br />
this came the ANZUS treaty that alliance between the United<br />
States, Australia and New Zealand which, in my judgment, ranks<br />
as the greatest single contributing factor to the long-term<br />
security of this nation in the history of the Australian Federation.<br />
I welcomed Admiral Johnson the comment you made your first<br />
comment when you came here showing your own realisation of<br />
the need for us to keep closely together in matters of security<br />
through the future history of this region of the world.<br />
And that happy community partnership which we now<br />
find here in Exmouth itself flowing from this project is not<br />
of course a surprising thing because we have in both our<br />
countries a common heritage of British freedom and of British<br />
democratic institutions. These have influenced our own national<br />
growth although the composition of our countries in time becomes<br />
affected, and affected richly to our advantage we have discovered,<br />
by the influx into our respective country yours in very much<br />
greater numbers than ours in the United States but we in turn<br />
with 40 nationalities now making their contribution to Australian<br />
growth and Australian strength. But we are finding that in this<br />
richer community we still have a basic reliance upon the principles<br />
of freedom and the democratic institutions which were part of<br />
our common heritage.<br />
Now, Sir, this ' Centre is, I may clearly say, a<br />
sensible, practical, logical extension of the ANZUS spirit,<br />
an application of the ANZUS spirit to a particular project.<br />
In a sense it made history, because for the first time we<br />
found here on Australian soil a project in which there were<br />
established on a continuing basis the forces of another<br />
country. But we do not think in terms of a foreign country </p>
<p>2.<br />
with the United States. le have a basis of friendship, a<br />
closeness of co-operation, an interdependence of interest<br />
which has drawn both our countries very closely together.<br />
Earlier this week and I say this in particular<br />
to you, Mr. Premier I have been visiting some of the more<br />
notable development projects in your State. It makes a rather<br />
striking contrast to contemplate that here we have been seeing<br />
great economic developments arising, from our extraction and<br />
processing of minerals which have stood undisturbed through<br />
the aeons of time and to come, as I did only yesterday, to<br />
this project which is the modern, technical expression in<br />
its most recent form, a matter for wonderment to laymen like<br />
myself. Now Australians, although small in number and remote<br />
geographically from other parts of the world, or those parts<br />
where scientific development has proceeded most extensively,<br />
have perhaps it may appear rather curiously to some shown<br />
a very real interest in matters of radio physics, in astronomy,<br />
in outer space research and items of that kind. There may be<br />
some who think that because so many of us have experience of<br />
vast lonely spaces and clear blue skies and more opportunity<br />
of contemplating the constellations, the 1' ilky day than other<br />
nationalities, that this has some bearing on it. There may<br />
be a feeling that the very fact that we incorporate the Southern<br />
Cross in our national flag is an expression of our interest<br />
in these matters astronomical. Another cause, of course, which<br />
has a very real bearing on this is that, geographically placed<br />
as we are, Australia is able to make a contribution to space<br />
research and to the study of the heavens which supplements<br />
what is done in the Northern Hemisphere.<br />
But be that as it may, we have developed our own<br />
expertise in the tracking stations, in such places as Parkes<br />
with a radio-telescope there and at 1doomera, where at the<br />
present time we have a joint project with the United States,<br />
the Sparta Project which is adding to our knowledge of matters<br />
in which we have a mutual interest. And whether there is some<br />
special significance in this or not, well I leave to others to<br />
fathom. The fact is that it does exist and this, I think it<br />
will be agreed, makes us worthy partners in this enterprise.<br />
Perhaps it also would be not inappropriate to use in this<br />
context the torin " wavelengths" because Australians and Americans<br />
do seem to find it possible to get on a wavelength with each<br />
other with far less crackling static than is usually found in<br />
relations between one country and another.<br />
Now the purpose of this station is to improve the<br />
efficiency of our efforts to maintain security and peace not<br />
only in this area of the world but as a contribution to peace<br />
throughout the world as a whole. And I wonder how many people<br />
pause to realise just what is the magnitude of thc American<br />
contribution to the peace of the world at this time. Certainly<br />
those of us who live in South-E~ ast Asia or the Asian region<br />
have very good cause to know the magnitude of that contribution.<br />
I wonder how many of my fellow countrymen know that if you<br />
take the periphery of Asia running round from South Korea,<br />
Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam itself, Thailand,<br />
Australia and New Zealand, just to mention those in particular,<br />
there has virtually been underwritten by this mighty power the<br />
security of free p., eoples in those countries. , e realise it in<br />
relation to ANZUS but I wonder how many of us recognise that<br />
this is the order of dimension of the American undertaking and<br />
the American contribution to the peace of the area. And we<br />
honour you, Admiral Johnson, and all associated with you in<br />
the contribution that you and your servicemen are making to<br />
underwrite this guarantee of freedom. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Now, here in this centre we are able by our joint<br />
efforts to make a contribution. Frankly, I had not even through<br />
all that I had read been led to prepare my mind for the v'qstness<br />
of the enterprise. To think that there are those 13 towers<br />
out there, all higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, all<br />
constructed to withstand the cyclonic gales which occasionally<br />
assail this part of the coast, and even the sight of them<br />
leaves one unprepared for what one sees when you come close and<br />
get inside the structures. It's almost bewildering and dazzling<br />
to see the complexity and scale of equipment that goes into<br />
the task that this centre will serve.<br />
And so we express today as Australians, and I as<br />
Head of an Australian Government, our appreciation to the<br />
contribution this enterprise will bring to our s' uarity and<br />
the security of other free peoples. Re also kn-. and we<br />
will be saying perhaps something more on this at the ceremony<br />
which follows later in -the township itself what this has<br />
meant to this particular relatively isolated part of Australia<br />
in terms of community development, and the happy partnership<br />
which has been revealed under the stress of war is again<br />
exemplified in the happy community spirit which you have<br />
developed in this township.<br />
I spoke earlier of the power of the United States<br />
and we do well to reflect that this power is used for the<br />
purposes of peace. I know of no action or policy decision<br />
of a Government of the United States which is directed to<br />
its own aggrandisement or the acquisition of additional<br />
territory under its own control. It is there as a force for<br />
freedom and peace in the world, and we in our dav and generation<br />
have cause, as we go about our own task of developing our<br />
nation and building up our security, to be grateful for the<br />
security which is underwritten virtually for us by this great<br />
power which has used its strength with so much restraint and<br />
with such a high principle as its purpose.<br />
This, the first United States' station on Australian<br />
soil will, I hope, long continue as a symbol of the continuing<br />
partnership between our two countries and al". tÃ±.. at this<br />
partnership stands for in terms of happiness, security and<br />
interdependence of free peoples in the life of the world as<br />
it develops ahead of us. And so to me it is a particular<br />
pleasure, as the Head of the Australian Government and people,<br />
to be personally associated here today with a ceremony which<br />
is both historic in itself and important in its symbolism. </p>
