FOR PRESS P, M. No, 2Z1_ 963<br />
ECONOMIC COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY<br />
Statement bthe Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. R, G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister conferred this morning<br />
with the Members of the Committee of Sconomic Enquiry<br />
Dr, James Vernon, C. B. E. ( Chairman)<br />
Professor Sir John Crawford, C. B. E.<br />
( Vice Chairman)<br />
Professor P. H. Karmel<br />
D. G, Molesworth, Esq., C. B. E.<br />
K. B. Myer, Esq., D. S. C.<br />
There were also present Dr. F. B. Horner, the Secretary of<br />
the Committee; Mr. A. Wo McCasker, the Executive Officer;<br />
and Mr. J. F. Nimmo of the Prime Minister's Department.<br />
The purpose of the Conference was to discuss<br />
the arrangements that must be made to provide the necessary<br />
research staff for the Committee, and effective liaison<br />
between the Committee and those Commonwealth Departments<br />
from which a good deal of factual information will need to<br />
be obtained. The Prime Minister indicated to the Committee<br />
that it was to regard itself as the master of its own<br />
procedure; that it should feel at liberty to accumulate such<br />
facts as it needed in its own way, being guided by its own<br />
judgment. He said that the Government's decision had been<br />
in favour of a committee rather than a royal commission,<br />
because of the greater informality of procedure which the<br />
former made possible. The Prime Minister said, after the meeting<br />
" Although the Commit-ee will of course determine its own<br />
procedures, I am hoping for its sa: e that as much information<br />
as possible will be put before it in writing and not by<br />
oral evidence. Expericnce has shown that much time can be<br />
lost by the hearing of oral non-controversial evidence on<br />
some matter on which a written document would be more concise<br />
and valuable and more easily recorded and studied. In other<br />
words, it seems to me to be undesirable that the Committoe<br />
should have to conduct its investigations in an atmosphere<br />
of public debate; it should rather be regarded as conducting<br />
a piece of highly important research with the best technical<br />
assistance it can get from any source that it desires,"<br />
CANBERRA, 7th March, 1963. </p>
