FOR MEDIA: TUESDAY 15 APRIL 1980<br />
OLYMPIC GAMES BOYCOTT<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following telegram to all<br />
delegates attending the meeting of the Australian O]. ynipic<br />
Federation in Melbourne at the weekend:<br />
" The Government has today reaffirmed its view that<br />
because of the continued Soviet aggression in<br />
Afghanistan by the Soviet Union, it is in Australia's<br />
national interest to stand with other countries who<br />
have connemna rhis action and not send a team to the<br />
Moscow Olvmcics.<br />
Th " Government ccnfidently expects that the decision<br />
ma-e by the U. S. Olympic Comrmittee will be followed -in<br />
other countries and that there will be an effective<br />
bc-; cott.<br />
I ask that as a delegate to the Australian Olympic<br />
FeCeration, you support a decision not to send an<br />
Australian team to Moscow.<br />
Because of the unstable situation in the Persian Gulf<br />
which the Soviet Union has caused, and the implications<br />
to other countries, the Government's view is that it is<br />
not in the interests of our national security for<br />
Australia to take part in the Moscow Olympics.<br />
I strongly urge you to take these national interests<br />
fully into account, and to support an immediate decision<br />
by the Federation not to go to Moscow."<br />
The Government will be taking further steps later in the week to<br />
explain its position to the Australian Olympic Federation.<br />
Arrangements have been made for myself, the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, and the Minister for Home Affairs to meet the Executive<br />
of the Australian Olympic Federation in Melbourne on Friday.<br />
The President of the Federation, Mr. Grange has also agreed to<br />
my request to address the plenary session of the Federation on<br />
Saturday morning.<br />
Through these initiatives, the Government wishes to ensure that<br />
delegates are fully aware of the issues involved before they cast<br />
their votes. 000---</p>
