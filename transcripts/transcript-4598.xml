A<br />
FOR PRESS 16 DECEMBER 1977<br />
I have considered the position of the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Liberal Party, the Right Honourable Phillip Lynch, in the<br />
light of his disclosure to me of his family's financial interests<br />
and in particular, their interests in commercial arrangements<br />
entered into in September 1973 whilst he was in Opposition, and<br />
concluded in 1976 after he became Treasurer, concerning land at<br />
Balnarring in Victoria.<br />
I have also taken independent advice from Mr Stephen Charles, Q<br />
of the Melbourne Bar, who advised me that on the facts available<br />
to him from documents supplied and from information made available<br />
from Irish, Young and'Outhwaite, and Mallesons, that nothing<br />
has been done by Mr Lynch or his family which was illegal,<br />
commercially improper or represented a conflict between his or<br />
their private interests and Mr Lynch's public duties as a<br />
Minister of the Crown, and that the arrangements were normal<br />
commercial arrangements.<br />
Mr Charles has advised me that in his opinion Mr Lynch did comply<br />
with the directive in my letter to all Ministers of 13 January, 1976,<br />
requiring disclosure of private interests.<br />
I am delighted that Mr Charles has advised as he has. I happily<br />
accepted that advice. I now regard the matter as closed, and I<br />
see no reason why Mr Lynch should not be re-elected as Deputy<br />
Leader of. the Liberal Party.<br />
I very greatly regret the difficulty and anguish that<br />
Phillip Lynch and his family have experienced over recent weeks.<br />
ilook forward to working with him in the coming period.<br />
These events have shown that a Prime Minister is placed in a most<br />
difficult position when he is called upon to pass judgement on<br />
colleagues with whom he has worked closely, particularly as<br />
the Prime Minister must act as judge and jury when allegations of<br />
impropriety are raised. ./ 2 </p>
<p>A far more satisfactory procedure must be found to resolve<br />
these situations which can have such an impact on an individual's<br />
career and on the life of his family.<br />
A whole new approach is required. I do not regard the Report of<br />
the Parliamentary Committee on Pecuniary Interests as putting<br />
forward adequate solutions. In my view, a statement of pecuniary<br />
interests to the Parliament does not provide an adequate procedure.<br />
Because of that view, I intend to appoint a judge or Queen's Counsel,<br />
to be assisted by a businessman and an accountant, who will need<br />
to be familiar with modern commercial practice and procedures,<br />
to make recommendations to the Government on what interests should<br />
be disclosed.<br />
They will also be asked to recommend what procedures should be<br />
followed to determine whether there has been any breach of the<br />
high standards which are properly required of those in public office.<br />
The-Committee. will also be asked to recommend the method which<br />
should be used to determine whether there has been a breach.-<br />
. They will be asked to examine whether or not a register under<br />
judicial supervision should be instituted and maintained in such<br />
a way, which, in the event of allegations of impropriety or on the<br />
judge's own ini-tiative, will allow for expeditious and proper<br />
judicial examination of such allegations.<br />
