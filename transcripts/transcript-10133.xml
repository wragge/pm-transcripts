Fax from October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE BON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
NIGHTLINE CHANNEL NINE<br />
LYNEHAM: Welcome to Nightline.<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
It's a pleasure.<br />
LYNEHAM: On May 7 you told the Parliament your guidelines would be complied with in full.<br />
Now if you were fair dinkum why shouldn't Short, Gibson and Moore have resigned<br />
many months ago?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
To start with, the conflict of interest, the action which involved a conflict of interest in<br />
Brian Gibson's case only took place a few weeks ago. Moore hasn't breached the<br />
guidelines and I don't remember the exact date of Short, so the answer is no.<br />
LYNEHAM: But Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any<br />
company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. That's it,<br />
no ifs, no buts.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but you apply it within the three cases. In the'case of Jim Short he should have<br />
got rid of the bank shares. In the case of Brian Gibson, he wasn't directly involved in<br />
Taxfrv~ 16/ 10/ 96 18: 12 Pg: 8 </p>
<p>Fax from 16/ 10/ 96 18: 12 Pg: 9<br />
banking matters therefore it was arguable whether he should have got rid of them and<br />
in the case of John Moore, I don't believe he's in breach of that guideline.<br />
LYNEHAM: But Bligh Ventures in which John Moore has nearly 100 000 worth of shares, has a<br />
stake in several technology companies. He's Mfinister for Industry, Science and<br />
Tourism. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but he doesn't own any shares in those companies. How can you divest yourself<br />
of shares you don't own?<br />
LYNEHAM: Oh so if you have them at arm's length...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course, that's the whole point. I mean, arm's length means exactly that. That is<br />
exactly the situation. If you're at arm's length from something of course there can't be<br />
any conflict of interest.<br />
LYNEHAM: But didn't Brian Gibson go today because he gave a decision..<br />
PRIME MIN4ISTER:<br />
He wasn't at arm's length. I mean, he actually owned shares in the company that<br />
controlled the company that benefited from his decision. Mind you, he didn't benefit.<br />
That was a very, very technical breach but it was actually a subsidiary but we're not<br />
talking about that here.<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
Well, the Labor Party says we certainly are talking about it here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
Well of course. In the Labor Party they would say anything. Just look at the<br />
guidelines. The guidelines say that you've got to get rid of shares in companies that<br />
are operating in the areas of your responsibility. Now the companies that you named<br />
are not companies in which John Moore has shares. He has about two or three percent<br />
of the issued share capital of the venture company which invests in a whole range of<br />
activities and there would be many investments that that company has that he wouldn't<br />
even be aware of. I mean, it's like a policy holder with the AMP, a superannuation </p>
<p>Fax from policy holder with the ANTl wouldn't have any idea from day to day what the AMP<br />
invests in or the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund.<br />
LYNEILAM: Why did he put them on the market then the day after your deadline?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He put them on the market because he wanted to remove the possibility that the sort of<br />
allegations that are being made against him were being made, but if he didn't put them<br />
on the market because I told him to and he is not in breach of the guidelines. I mean, I<br />
don't have any shares. I've never had any shares as a Minister. That doesn't mean to<br />
say other people can't have shares. It's a question of having them in the terms of the<br />
guidelines. LYNEHAM: So even though the company that he helped to found has substantial interests in a<br />
range of other companies, that's not a problem?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is not a breach of the guideline but I think what this whole issue has thrown up is<br />
the desirability of looking at the introduction in Australia of the American-British<br />
approach of a blind trust where if you've got a substantial holding of shares you can<br />
give them into the caue of a trustee when you become a Minister. You have no<br />
control, no say about what happens to them and you can be kept at arm's length from<br />
them and when you have finished your ministerial tour of duty you can have them back<br />
because we don't want to get into a situation in this country where anybody who owns<br />
shares is frightened out of going into politics, Mind you, with this sort of business<br />
happening we are fast approaching that situation.<br />
LYNEHAM: Your critics say that now that your Ministers won't comply with the guidelines you're<br />
changing the guidelines to comply with the Ministers.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a little bit rich to say they won't comply when two of them have resigned for what<br />
are no more than technical breaches where neither of them have had any personal gain,<br />
neither of them have been guilty of any personal dishonesty. I can't think of a Prime<br />
Minister who's required that in the past' any Prime Minister,<br />
LYNEHAUM: But you're the bloke who put yourself up as the man going to forge a new trust. You<br />
were going to set the bar higher than any.... Faro m16/ 10/ 96 10: 12 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from 16/ 10/ 96 10: 12 Pg: 1<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would argue that the compliance has been higher than anybody else, would argue<br />
that very strongly.<br />
LYNEHAMWell your critics would argue it took you a fair while to get to the edge with Short<br />
for example for three or four days he sat there still a minister in charge of banking<br />
policy while still holding banking shares.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well no, that's not right because when it was brought to attention he sold the banking<br />
shares the following day. In the end Short went because of the apparent conflict of<br />
interest, as did Brian Gibson. Neither of them gained anything, neither of them<br />
profited, neither of them is regarded as lacking in personal integrity. They paid<br />
insufficient attention to the detail of the guidelines and they've paid a very high price.<br />
Now, that is a high high-jump bar, I'm not boasting about that, I'm sorry it's occurred<br />
but nobody can say that we haven't replied compliance with the guidelines.<br />
LYNEHAM: Are you going to dig in over John Moore?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
There's nothing to dig in over. He's not been in breach of the guidelines.<br />
LYNEHAM: How do you think the battlers are going to feel about all this, you know, hundred<br />
thousand dollars here, I've just forgot my fifty thousand dollars worth of shares over<br />
there it doesn't sound very...<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
It is always easy, when you're talking about shares, to paint the picture of cigars and<br />
millionaires, It's always easy to do that.<br />
LYNEEHAM: But when you're talking fifty, a hundred thousand dollars.-.<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER:<br />
But you know, equally you could talk that about hundred thousand dollar investments<br />
in piggeries and large shareholdings of ministers in former governments. I just say that<br />
the idea that we should create a climate in this country where people who own shares </p>
<p>tax rom16/ 18/ 96 10: 12 Pg: 12<br />
are frightened of going into politics would rob the country of a full range of the people<br />
who want to serve in its institution.<br />
LYNEHAM: And it's hard I think it raises a question of the old dilemma of John Howard and<br />
tough decisions. Last time you were leader people said you would often shy at the<br />
fence, you would often not take that tough decision.<br />
PREME MINISTER:<br />
And you don't think it was tough to get a letter last night from somebody who's as<br />
honest as you'd find anybody in this building, Brian Gibson, who's been a<br />
conscientious Parliamentary Secretary who'd accumulated a share portfolio to help<br />
with his own retirement, and, you know, in great distress to say to me, " John, I'm<br />
sorry I've let you down, I haven't gained anything"'. He gives me that resignation this<br />
morning, I call him around and I say, Brian I've got no alternative but to accept it, I<br />
know you've done nothing wrong, I know you haven't made a cent out of this. It<br />
caused him great personal distress because he really is an honest, decent, hardworking<br />
man. But despite that I said I can't not accept your resignation. Now, are you saying<br />
that is weak? I think it's good leadership to think about the personal side of the impact<br />
of decisions on people, but at the end of the day to do your duty. Now, I've done my<br />
duty in relation to both Short and Gibson and I'm doing my duty in relation to Moore,*<br />
I'm not going to have people knocked off just because Kim Beazley and Simon Crean<br />
say they're in breach. I'll satisfy myself and if I'm satisfied with somebody who's not<br />
in breach I will defend that person. Loyalty is a two way process in politics. I've got<br />
loyalty for my colleagues, they're entitled, when the merits require it, to have loyalty<br />
back from me.<br />
LYNEHAM: Let me finally and quickly shift to another area though with this same question mark.<br />
It took you nearly a month to make a substantive reply in Parliament to the comments<br />
made by Pauline Hanson. Now I know you say you don't want your agenda driven by<br />
somebody else, you are the Prime Minister, but doesn't tough, clear leadership demand<br />
a response on issues like immigration and race, quicker and firmer?<br />
PRE MINISTER:<br />
No. I deliberately did what I did in relation to Pauline Hanson. I don't regret for a<br />
moment what I did. It did not take a month for me to respond Parliament was in<br />
recess for part of the period. I actually responded on the largest current affairs<br />
programme in Australia, the Ray Martin programme. I made my views very clear<br />
when asked about immigration, when asked about Asian immigration, when asked<br />
about Aboriginal affairs, but I repeat Paul, I don't care what anybody says, the policy<br />
positions of my government will be annunciated not by way of response to the maiden<br />
speech of a backbencher, not by way of response to a motion put down by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, I will choose my fora, my circumstances, my language and my time<br />
to make policy pronouncements and I will be very determined to maintain that </p>
<p>16/ 10/ 96 16: 12 pg: 13<br />
approach and I'm not going to be growl beating by some of the politically correct<br />
commentators in to making announcements at a time of their choosing and not mine.<br />
LYNEHAM: Finally, how do you respond when Asian leaders tell you, as I assume they must have,<br />
of the ugly climate they've been starting to feel in recent weeks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they haven't. I mean it's interesting, isn't it? I visited, in the wake of Pauline<br />
Hanson's speech, I visited two of out major Asian partners, Japan and Indonesia, and<br />
the issue wasn't raised once.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well Tim Fischer picked it up, he didn't think-.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean I know the answer frm my experience Paul-I think too many people have<br />
paid too much attention to what the lady said. I find it fascinating that those who are<br />
now ringing their hands about how much publicity she has received are the very people<br />
who gave her that publicity.<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister thank you for your time.<br />
ends. </p>
