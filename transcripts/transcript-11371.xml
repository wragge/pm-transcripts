<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Rob. To Mike Tyler and Kevin Maher, to my</p>
<p> colleague Senator John Tierney, other distinguished guests, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen. This dinner has got off to an excellent start - you've</p>
<p> got lamb on the menu. I'll refer to that in the context of Australia's</p>
<p> economic challenges in a few moments.</p>
<p>But can I say that for me tonight is a special honour. I do appreciate</p>
<p> the opportunity of addressing a gathering of people drawn from different</p>
<p> sides of the argument but united in the common cause of an intelligent</p>
<p> and cooperative approach to employers and employees working together</p>
<p> for the benefit of their industries, the benefit of their job security,</p>
<p> and the overall benefit of the country.</p>
<p>And I'm conscious that this annual lecture, this dinner honours two</p>
<p> men, Maurie Finnegan and Maurie Rudd who made a remarkable contribution</p>
<p> to the trade union movement in the Newcastle and Hunter area, and</p>
<p> more generally throughout New South Wales and Australia. Both of them</p>
<p> had their union careers through the old Federated Ironworkers' Association.</p>
<p> It underwent a number of name changes, identity changes, but never</p>
<p> lost a strong sense of passionate commitment to union principles and</p>
<p> the betterment of the interests of union members and their families.</p>
<p>The old Federated Ironworkers' Association of course has a special</p>
<p> place in trade union history in Australia because it was the location</p>
<p> of one of the most famous battlegrounds in the late 1940s and early</p>
<p> 1950s when ideological struggles within the trade union movement and</p>
<p> the broader labour movement in Australia had a different dimension</p>
<p> perhaps than they do today, and have a special resonance for those</p>
<p> who follow and understand the history of the trade union movement</p>
<p> in this country.</p>
<p>I didn't have the privilege of meeting Maurie Finnegan, but I did</p>
<p> have the privilege of meeting Maurie Rudd on a number of occasions.</p>
<p> He was a very dedicated union man. He had a passionate commitment</p>
<p> to the city of Newcastle. He fought against a debilitating illness</p>
<p> that finally claimed his life, to secure a fair and decent outcome</p>
<p> for the men and women affected by the industrial and economic changes</p>
<p> that came upon Newcastle two or three years ago.</p>
<p>I shan't forget visiting him in the John Hunter Hospital not long</p>
<p> before he died, and spending about an hour with him and his two very</p>
<p> fine children. He knew of course that he was facing death very soon</p>
<p> and he hadn't long, as I understood it, lost his wife. And the matter</p>
<p> of fact, cheerful, resolute disposition that he displayed, and the</p>
<p> encouragement and inspiration that he demonstrated by that display</p>
<p> to his son and his daughter had quite an impact on me. He was in every</p>
<p> sense of the word a genuine article, somebody who cared about his</p>
<p> fellow men and women, somebody who was true to his union principles,</p>
<p> true to his labour principles, but undoubtedly somebody who was prepared</p>
<p> to work closely with anybody who shared his common commitment to improving</p>
<p> the lot of the people of Newcastle. So I do regard it as an honour</p>
<p> to have been invited to deliver this lecture in honour of those two</p>
<p> men.</p>
<p>I do it ladies and gentlemen, at a time when if you talk about the</p>
<p> generality of the Australian community, if you look at the things</p>
<p> that measure economic and social performance in Australia, it is fair</p>
<p> to say I think without exaggeration, it is fair to say that generally</p>
<p> speaking the Australian economy at the present time is performing</p>
<p> extremely well.</p>
<p>I've just come back from a visit to Japan and the United States, and</p>
<p> I've visited the financial community of New York on a number of occasions</p>
<p> in the time that I've been in politics. As Prime Minister, once in</p>
<p> 1997 and on a number of previous occasions as Treasurer, or as Minister</p>
<p> for Business and Consumer Affairs or as Leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p> And I can say without fear of contradiction that in that most, I suppose,</p>
<p> that city of the most savage financial and economic judgements that</p>
<p> you can find anywhere in the world, I found on this occasion a ready</p>
<p> acceptance of the fact that the Australian economy is as a whole performing</p>
<p> very strongly indeed.</p>
<p>Our growth rates, our low interest rates, our low inflation, our [inaudible]</p>
<p> gains as a nation over the last few years have given to the Australian</p>
<p> economy a resilience and a strength. And the fact that we were able</p>
<p> to successfully stare down the dramatic downturn in the Asian economies</p>
<p> in a way that frankly surprised me, I'll be honest. I thought about</p>
<p> 18 months ago what was going to happen was that we were going to say</p>
<p> well we were going pretty well until we were mugged by the Asian economic</p>
<p> downturn. And it didn't turn out that way. We have fared rather better.</p>
<p> And I'm pleased for that, and I think we're all pleased for the sake</p>
<p> of Australia that that has occurred.</p>
<p>Now I do speak against that background, but I readily acknowledge</p>
<p> that although that is the general position, there are a number of</p>
<p> areas of Australia including areas of the Hunter that are not sharing</p>
<p> all of that general prosperity. And it would be a mistake for me,</p>
<p> and it's a mistake I don't intend to make, to pretend that because</p>
<p> at a national general level we're doing particularly well that that</p>
<p> is evenly distributed throughout the community because in the nature</p>
<p> of things it's not. And part of my job, and part of the thing that</p>
<p> has brought me on a number of occasions to Newcastle and will continue</p>
<p> to do so, is the sensitivity I have to the particular problems of</p>
<p> different regions of Australia and the particular challenges here</p>
<p> in the Hunter, and I want to say something about those in just a moment.</p>
<p>But can I say that one of the other general observations I wish to</p>
<p> make apart from the remarks I've made about the Australian economy,</p>
<p> is to say something of the way in which the political and economic</p>
<p> landscape of this country has changed over the last 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p> And in doing so it has mirrored a number of the changes that have</p>
<p> occurred throughout the world during that same period. It's fair to</p>
<p> say that the world, and Australia was no exception, went through a</p>
<p> period in the 1960s and 1970s, which was evident in the United States,</p>
<p> it was evident in Europe and it was evident in Australia, where there</p>
<p> was a belief that if you had a problem then all that had to occur</p>
<p> was that the government, particularly the federal government in a</p>
<p> federation, should throw a large amount of extra money at that problem</p>
<p> and that it would go away.</p>
<p>The Americans during the time of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations</p>
<p> described it as the great society, whereby what you did was that you</p>
<p> pumped large increasing amounts of federal money into particular projects</p>
<p> and that the problems would go away. And I think we saw something</p>
<p> of a retreat from that in the 1980s. We saw a bit of a backlash against</p>
<p> it and we developed a culture in a number of parts of the world and</p>
<p> it was optimised by the memorable but not particularly noble phrase</p>
<p> in the Hollywood movie 'Wall Street', when Gordon Gecko said that</p>
<p> greed was good. And it tended in the eyes of many people who summarised</p>
<p> the attitude of that period when it was thought that rampant and rather</p>
<p> insensitive capitalism was the solution to every problem.</p>
<p>Now I think in the 1990s we have reached something of an new equilibrium.</p>
<p> We're never going back to where we were in the '60s or '70s or '80s.</p>
<p> You never go back. You might have a common thread of attitudes and</p>
<p> values from the past but you always have to adapt to new circumstances.</p>
<p> And one of the things that I've tried to develop in the little more</p>
<p> than three years that the Government has been in office is what I</p>
<p> call a social coalition. The idea of a social coalition is to recognise</p>
<p> one very important fact of life in Australia as we face the next millennium,</p>
<p> and that is that there is no one section of society that can really</p>
<p> on its own solve all of the challenges we have, or achieve all of</p>
<p> the goals we seek.</p>
<p>The government alone cannot solve all of the nation's problems. Governments</p>
<p> working together can't solve all of the government's problems. Governments</p>
<p> are good at some things but they're very bad at other things. Governments</p>
<p> have significant national responsibilities. They have a role in providing</p>
<p> a social security safety net but they're not very good in my view</p>
<p> at running businesses. In fact they're very bad at running businesses</p>
<p> on just about every occasion. On the other hand other sections of</p>
<p> the community are not able to carry all of the burdens and achieve</p>
<p> all of the goals. And what I've sought to do through the notion of</p>
<p> a social coalition is to bring together the government, the business</p>
<p> community, other organisations within the community, be they welfare</p>
<p> organisations, trade unions, and of course the enterprise and commitment</p>
<p> of individual people to tackle problems.</p>
<p>One of the first things I did when I became Prime Minister was to</p>
<p> get together a task force on youth homeless. But instead of the task</p>
<p> force being run by somebody out of a federal government department,</p>
<p> the task force was chaired by Captain David Eldridge, a Salvation</p>
<p> Army officer from Melbourne. And it's produced I think quite a different,</p>
<p> some might say not quite revolutionary, but certainly dramatically</p>
<p> different way of tackling the problem of youth homelessness. Placing</p>
<p> a premium in the first instance on seeing if there could be a reconciliation</p>
<p> achieved between a young person who had left home and that person's</p>
<p> family. And only when those who had cared for the child that had left</p>
<p> home believed that that reconciliation did we then go about seeing</p>
<p> that those people were looked after in the social security system.</p>
<p>What I did on that occasion was to involve at a policy making level,</p>
<p> the welfare organisations of Australia. And I've continued to do that</p>
<p> in relation to such things as the challenge of drug abuse within our</p>
<p> community. And I make no apology for the fact that I draw very heavily</p>
<p> on organisations like the Salvation Army and the society of St Vincent</p>
<p> de Paul, and other organisations of that ilk, in developing policy</p>
<p> for great social challenges and social issues. And I do that because</p>
<p> I believe they have more coalface understanding and experience of</p>
<p> the human misery caused by those social problems than any other group</p>
<p> of people in the Australian community.</p>
<p>In the past the attitude was, well we'll allow them to provide the</p>
<p> care, the Christian charity if you like, but they don't really understand</p>
<p> in their soft-headed way what sought of broad ranging policies are</p>
<p> needed. The reality of course is that people who run welfare organisations</p>
<p> are anything but soft-headed. They know how hard it is to raise money,</p>
<p> and they know the value of the hard-earned dollar, or a difficulty</p>
<p> raised dollar perhaps better than any other group of people in the</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>But what I seek to achieve in a number of these areas, and it's found</p>
<p> in expression in the call that I've made to the Australian business</p>
<p> community shortly after the last election to be more generous in supporting</p>
<p> noble causes and charitable endeavours. I want to develop a greater</p>
<p> sense of corporate philanthropy within Australia. I'm not saying so</p>
<p> much that business should give more, what I'm saying is that more</p>
<p> businesses should give because there are many individual companies</p>
<p> and many individual business men and women in this country who have</p>
<p> a remarkable record of generosity to less well off and less fortunate</p>
<p> Australians. Our Government has introduced a number of tax incentives</p>
<p> to encourage a greater involvement by the business community in philanthropic</p>
<p> endeavour, and this is another expression of the notion of a social</p>
<p> coalition. Of tapping the capacity of the different strands of society</p>
<p> where they are best able to contribute to make that contribution.</p>
<p> And of course here in the Hunter the taskforce that carries my name</p>
<p> is a good example of the social coalition at work because you have</p>
<p> every conceivable element of that coalition represented on the taskforce.</p>
<p> You have the trade union movement represented, there's a co-chairmanship</p>
<p> of somebody from the trade union movement, somebody from the business</p>
<p> community, you have community leaders, you have representatives of</p>
<p> the churches. In other words you have the very best expression of</p>
<p> a community organisation. And at a micro-Hunter level so to speak,</p>
<p> it is an example of the social coalition at work.</p>
<p>Now I am very aware of the psychological impact on this city of some</p>
<p> of the decisions that were announced several years ago. I'm also aware</p>
<p> of course that the future of this city is increasingly diverse. As</p>
<p> I look around this room and I had a look at the guest list before</p>
<p> I came, it reminded me that old notions of Newcastle are no longer</p>
<p> relevant. It reminded me of the way in which the industrial and service</p>
<p> base of this city has already diversified, of the enormous change</p>
<p> in the hunter region, of the growth of many service industries, not</p>
<p> only in tourism but also in education. And the enormous potential</p>
<p> in relation to defence industries that exist in respect of the various</p>
<p> operations in the Williamtown area.</p>
<p>Now tonight is not an occasion for the listing of banners and the</p>
<p> tabulation and the enumeration of.we've made a decision on this and</p>
<p> that, and don't you remember that we decided to allocate a few million</p>
<p> dollars here and there. But it is an opportunity for me to say that</p>
<p> we do remain very strongly committed to the future of this city. We</p>
<p> won't satisfy you on everything. We expect to continue to be criticised.</p>
<p> That is part of the process and it's part of the ongoing exchange</p>
<p> that occurs between a government and a community. But we have brought</p>
<p> good faith and also some dollars, and I hope in the incentives that</p>
<p> we have provided in a number of areas to which I will refer. We have</p>
<p> also I think made a material contribution to strengthening the job</p>
<p> and economic and industrial opportunities of this city for years into</p>
<p> the future.</p>
<p>I think you're aware of the $10 million structural adjustment package</p>
<p> that we announced in 1997, and we've approved a number of proposals</p>
<p> out of that. And I'm pleased to announce tonight that we have agreed</p>
<p> in principle to provide a $2.5 million sum of money in assistance</p>
<p> on a dollar-for-dollar basis for Impulse Airlines to establish a call</p>
<p> centre to service their current operations and the funding is subject</p>
<p> to meeting certain Commonwealth requirements that we understand from</p>
<p> discussion with the airline that they're optimistic that those conditions</p>
<p> can be met. And that this project will generate some 70 direct jobs</p>
<p> and of course many more indirect jobs and is a good illustration of</p>
<p> the continuing diversification of the Hunter region's employment base.</p>
<p>I mentioned the defence industry and Rob reminded me of my visit to</p>
<p> Newcastle a couple of years ago, and after being in Newcastle I went</p>
<p> out to Williamtown. And of course on my last trip to Newcastle a few</p>
<p> months ago I opened the British Aerospace lead-in fighter support</p>
<p> facility which will inject $60 million into the area and employ 250</p>
<p> people directly. I also announced that five of the new airborne early</p>
<p> warning and control aircraft will be based at Williamtown and involves</p>
<p> an extra 200 RAAF personnel and approximately 80 contractors. Yesterday</p>
<p> my Defence Minister John Moore announced that Boeing is the preferred</p>
<p> tenderer for these aircraft and the project involves new infrastructure</p>
<p> valued at around $50 million.</p>
<p>I understand that the Redbank Power Station is now set to proceed</p>
<p> which involved Commonwealth assistance through the infrastructure</p>
<p> borrowing scheme which will generate investment spending of $600 million,</p>
<p> 1200 construction jobs over 2 years, and 250 direct jobs when the</p>
<p> power station is in operation.</p>
<p>Some of you may remember the industry policy statement I made in December</p>
<p> of 1997 and in that policy statement I announced the development of</p>
<p> the manufacturing in bonds approach which was designed specifically</p>
<p> to provide incentives for new investment in areas such as the Hunter,</p>
<p> and specifically in Newcastle. So ladies and gentlemen I mention these</p>
<p> things not to say well aren't we grand blokes and haven't we done</p>
<p> all these wonderful things, but to exemplify and to demonstrate that</p>
<p> our commitment is not just rhetorical. I do understand that the process</p>
<p> of adjustment and change in the community that has had a particular</p>
<p> cast and a particular mold for a long period of time is not easy.</p>
<p> But I detect from the many contacts I have with people in the Hunter</p>
<p> Valley and in Newcastle, I detect that there is a strong sense of</p>
<p> optimism, there's a strong sense of accepting that change is necessary,</p>
<p> that this area has very special qualities, it has a great beauty,</p>
<p> it has the capacity to attract and develop new industries and it's</p>
<p> in the process of doing that. And it has one other priceless asset</p>
<p> and that is that it has a great community sprit, it has a great sense</p>
<p> of identification with Hunter Valley's symbols. I meant he first thing</p>
<p> that Kevin said to me tonight was to start talking about the match</p>
<p> on the weekend between St George and Newcastle, and he informed me</p>
<p> of course that he was going to...no the upcoming match between St</p>
<p> George and Newcastle, and he informed that on Saturday he was going</p>
<p> to be barracking for St George in its match against the Broncos. So</p>
<p> that very very strong identification with symbols is very apparent</p>
<p> and a community which is based on a tradition attached to a particular</p>
<p> city, even though that tradition undergoes change, it leaves a very</p>
<p> strong deposit of a very strong community spirit.</p>
<p>So my message to you tonight ladies and gentlemen as Prime Minister</p>
<p> is that the nation as a whole, and generally speaking the nation is</p>
<p> in very good shape economically. I don't expect everybody in the room</p>
<p> to agree with every single thing that I've said. I would be perfectly</p>
<p> astonished if I found any audience in Australia that I addressed that</p>
<p> would do that. But I do think that over the last year as a result</p>
<p> of what has happened with our economy, as a result of us being able</p>
<p> to stare down that Asian economic downturn, Australians have acquired</p>
<p> a sense of national pride, a sense of confidence, of self belief,</p>
<p> the like of which we haven't had before or certainly for a long period</p>
<p> of time.</p>
<p>In the past [inaudible] have a lot of economic things. We've always</p>
<p> been externally and outwardly a very confident, optimistic people.</p>
<p> But deep down I think there's been a feeling that when it came to</p>
<p> world competition we were going to get cast aside and trampled on</p>
<p> and find it very difficult. And the great value of what has happened</p>
<p> in now being able to stare down the Asian downturn is that I think</p>
<p> we have overcome that. And there is about Australia at the present</p>
<p> time a sense of the can do and the sense that we can take on the world</p>
<p> in certain areas and beat them, and that Australians are as good if</p>
<p> not better in so many areas. Now that has always been true but perhaps</p>
<p> as a community we needed a demonstration. And the fact to our surprise</p>
<p> perhaps that it is certainly a reality that we've been able to work</p>
<p> and live through the Asian economic downturn, to diversify our exports</p>
<p> to North America and Europe, that all of those things have given to</p>
<p> us a sense of confidence and a self belief.</p>
<p>But amidst that I recognise that the general can't be applied to every</p>
<p> particular part of the national being. There are areas of Australia</p>
<p> that continue to deserve particular understanding and special sensitivity,</p>
<p> not only the Hunter Valley but a number of the regional and rural</p>
<p> areas of Australia, that find the impact of economic globalisation</p>
<p> very difficult to assimilate and very difficult to handle. And all</p>
<p> governments have to be sensitive towards that. But so indeed do the</p>
<p> affected communities.</p>
<p>I was relating a moment ago to those on my table the experience that</p>
<p> we've had in recent months with the pork industry. You may remember</p>
<p> around the time of the last election there were quite a number of</p>
<p> people involved in the pork industry that were demonstrating very</p>
<p> strongly, not only against us. They were demonstrating against everybody</p>
<p> because they felt very understandably that they were being poorly</p>
<p> treated, they were losing markets. That wasn't as a result of any</p>
<p> particular decision that the government had taken, but simply as a</p>
<p> result of changed market circumstances. In the face of a lot of criticism</p>
<p> and opposition from the industry the Government withstood requests</p>
<p> for handouts and subsidies, but rather fought to provide financial</p>
<p> assistance so that the industry could get into export and incredibly</p>
<p> enough that has worked. You now have a situation where sections of</p>
<p> the pork industry cannot fill the orders which are coming from countries,</p>
<p> particularly in the Asian-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Now that's not true of every pork producer, it's not true of every</p>
<p> industry facing that kind of challenge. But it's an example of the</p>
<p> sort of thing that can be achieved if there's and acceptance by both</p>
<p> the government and by people in the community or people in the industry,</p>
<p> that constructive cooperative change is unavoidable, and that if governments</p>
<p> are prepared to work together with industries in a constructive way,</p>
<p> recognising that you can't go back when market circumstances have</p>
<p> changed.</p>
<p>I mentioned lamb and I'll finish on lamb. We announced today, Mark</p>
<p> Vaile the new Trade Minister announced today that we'll be providing</p>
<p> some financial assistance to the lamb industry and assistance to encourage</p>
<p> and help the industry increase not only its domestic market but also</p>
<p> its export market. The Americans have taken a very selfish and a very</p>
<p> unfair decision. Australian lamb producers get no subsidies from the</p>
<p> government. The American lamb industry is extremely inefficient and</p>
<p> not only has the American government imposed a 30% tariff which effectively</p>
<p> freezes the existing market at 78,000 pounds, but it's also imposed</p>
<p> a 9% in quota tariff which is the unkindest cut of all. We're providing</p>
<p> some assistance which will offset the cost of that so that with luck</p>
<p> we may be able to help the Australian lamb exporters preserve their</p>
<p> existing market in the United States, although their prospects of</p>
<p> increasing it which would otherwise have occurred because of the superior</p>
<p> quality of the product, their prospects of increasing it are virtually</p>
<p> zero. But we are going to provide the industry with some advice and</p>
<p> some assistance to diversify, to improve the promotion of the product</p>
<p> not only here but also in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, another example of recognising the need</p>
<p> to change, that on some occasions you can't go back. But if there's</p>
<p> a right revel of cooperation between the government and an industry</p>
<p> and the community you can effectively move forward.</p>
<p>May I conclude ladies and gentlemen by saying again to the Industrial</p>
<p> Relations Society that I am very honoured to be here. I do have something</p>
<p> of an affection for Newcastle. My wife's family come from this district.</p>
<p> As you know we've holidayed in this general area over a long period</p>
<p> of time and we do have a very special affection. It's a city with</p>
<p> a tremendous sprit. I don't always agree with the way it votes but</p>
<p> that's life. It takes all kinds, and I respect it in the great tradition</p>
<p> of the robust Australian democracy. And one of the things that has</p>
<p> happened to Australian politics I think over the last few years that</p>
<p> it has become less tribal. We still have our differences and that's</p>
<p> good because it would be terribly dreary if we all agreed on everything,</p>
<p> and vigorous debate is the stuff of which good policy is made. And</p>
<p> that applies no matter who's in power and it applies no matter what</p>
<p> the country is.</p>
<p>But I think we have become a little less tribal. We are seeing more</p>
<p> of the national interest on some issues. I think there's a greater</p>
<p> recognition that something I've always held very dear about public</p>
<p> life in this country and that is that</p>
