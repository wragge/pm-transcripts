E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, RANDWICK LABOR CLUB, SYDNEY,<br />
26 OCTOBER 1984<br />
JOURNALIST: the Costigan Report from Mr Peacock if he<br />
doesn't guarantee not to reveal confidential details?<br />
PM: Let me say, Peter. What I've done is, I've written to Mr:<br />
Peacock indicating of course that we would make the report full),<br />
available to him, but the strict confidentiality must be<br />
respected. And the reasons for that are obvious. I will just put<br />
it very briefly. It is in respect of any on-going prosecutions<br />
that may be involved they must not be prejudiced. And secondly,<br />
the civil libe rties of people who may be named, who may not in<br />
fact have any charges against them. And so I am waiting on the<br />
reply from Mr Peacock to that letter. And he must be prepared to<br />
accept those conditions of strictest confidentiality. I don't<br />
think there is anyone in Australia o: E any political persudsion : ho<br />
would possibly disagree with that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Earlier on, Prime Minister, Mr Peacock was giving<br />
indications that he was going to release sections of the Report<br />
( inaudible)&gt;<br />
PM: ( inaudible) is doing that, I started to wonder whether<br />
the~ public for Mr Peacock could go any lower than it is, but<br />
I am sure that if he were to do that, it would. This is not an<br />
issue that is politically advantage it is You must<br />
respect the public interest in the two ways that I have said.<br />
Firstly, we are concern'ed, and I would assume Mr Peacock was, that<br />
every possibility of people who should be pursued according;<br />
to the criminal processes should be undertaken and without<br />
prejudice. There must: be nothing, at least which would inhibit:<br />
those processes. And secondly we should all feel a concern for<br />
the rights of individuals. Now, to get political advantage<br />
and prejudice those two basic considerations, then the people will<br />
make their judgement. As far as Mr Kennett is concerned, that i~ s<br />
a matter for arrangement between Mr Cain, the-Premier of Victoria,<br />
and the Leader of the Opposition. And if Mr Peacock is going to<br />
try and play politics on this, he will pay the price. He doesn't<br />
seem to learn quickly enought that there are standa~ rds of<br />
behaviour that the people of Australia expect from their political<br />
leaders. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
I think that that is not only a hypothetical question, ou. t<br />
it is just not fair to speculate on that. I trust that he will<br />
have the good sense to understand the necessity of abiding by<br />
those conditions.<br />
J OURNALIST: Prime Minister, will you concede that there are now<br />
big differences between the position of your Government and the<br />
ACTU over the productivity increase and indirect taxes?<br />
PM: No, I not only do not, but I think if you contain your<br />
patience, you will find that later this aft~ ernoon There will be a<br />
statement issued by the ACTU which will make it quite clear that<br />
that is not the case.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible.<br />
PM: Just a minute, I can't let that one<br />
JOURNALIST: That you have been putting pressure on<br />
PM: No, I don't put pressure on the ACTU.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Mr Dolan?<br />
PM: No, I have not spoken to Mr Dolan.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the Costigan matter. In one sense you are<br />
criticising Mr Peacock<br />
PM: No, no, I am not. Now, let's be quite clear on this. There<br />
have been propositions put to me that Mr PEacock has himself been<br />
making statements as to what he would do. I am responding to<br />
those. He has been saying he would release the document, he<br />
wouldn't abide by this, he would make it available to the public.<br />
That is what I am responding to.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the wording of the conditions you put in<br />
that letter?<br />
PM: I haven't got the document in front of me, but it seems to<br />
meit was that he would have the whole document made available -to<br />
him, unexpurgated, but that the strictest condition of<br />
confidentiality must be adhered to. That is the essence of what I<br />
said.<br />
JOURNALIST:-Inaudible.<br />
PM: I haven't spoken to Mr Crean. I have spoken to Mr Kelty.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Trimbole.<br />
miL I </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: No, this is something which is within the proper processes<br />
of the law and I hope that those processes are pursued ttL<br />
conclusion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I think you should see the stat~ ement which I understand will<br />
be made by the ACTU. Once you see that and hear what I have to<br />
say later on the , you will see lthat the position I am putting<br />
-to you is justified.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have the Costigan Report yet?<br />
PM: I don't have it yet, but my office has it, as I understand.<br />
I haven't seen it yet. </p>
