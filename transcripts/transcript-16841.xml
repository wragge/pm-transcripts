    <content><![CDATA[<p>Geraldton in Western Australia has become the first community in Australia to benefit from the Rudd Labor Government's $40 million investment in cycling infrastructure, a key element of the Economic Stimulus Plan.</p>
<p>The funding the Government is providing will support up to 21 local jobs during the current global recession as well as build the permanent facilities that will encourage healthier lifestyles amongst residents and a more sustainable community over the longer term.</p>
<p>Specifically, the City of Geraldton-Greenough will receive $272,000 for three projects:</p>
<p>- The manufacturing and installation of bike racks at nine locations around the City, including Bob Davies Park, Rundle Park, Spalding Park Tennis Club, Tarcoola Tennis Club, Recreation Ground, John Forrest Park, the Waterplay Playground and near the Visitors Centre.</p>
<p>- The construction of 10 new off-road concrete bike paths spanning four kilometres across Geraldton.</p>
<p>- The establishment of three bike lanes along Chapman Road from Phelps Street to Mabel Street, and along Durlacher Street from Highbury Street to Keane Drive and from Maitland Street to Hutchinson Street.</p>
<p>The Council as well as the WA Department of Planning and Infrastructure are also contributing funding to these projects.</p>
<p>The Government would also like to acknowledge and thank the Australian Greens senators for actively supporting the passage of the legislation that has made funding for these projects possible.</p>
