PRIME MINISTER TUESDAY, 16 OCTOBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC'S NEWSVOICE<br />
The row continued. today over the Federal Government's plans<br />
to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Prime Minister<br />
and the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr. Street, made it<br />
clear today that the Government and not members of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would control legislation<br />
relating to industrial disputes. Both Mr. Fraser and Mr. Street<br />
came under strong Opposition attack in Parliament this afternoon<br />
over the proposed amendments, now awaiting debate in the Senate.<br />
Report<br />
Statements this afternoon by both the Prime Minister and<br />
Mr. Street were perhaps the strongest yet in the growing<br />
controversy over the Conciliation and Arbitration Act amendments.<br />
There now appears no question whatsoever that the Government<br />
has not intention of withdrawing or watering down the legislation.<br />
In reply to one question Mr. Fraser said it was the Government's<br />
right to determine legislation in the industrial relations area<br />
and that was a policy the Government would pursue. The amendments<br />
now before Parliament would strengthen the powers of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration President in a way the Government<br />
believed. was constructive. Launching a public importance debate<br />
on the need for the Government to re-consider its industrial<br />
relations policy on the basis of concern by 25 members of<br />
the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Opposition<br />
Leader, Mr. Hayden, accused the Government of putting a noose<br />
on the impartiality of justice and it was not over-stating it,<br />
he said, to say the issue had now moved to crisis proportions.<br />
The Conciliation and Arbitration amendments, said Mr. Hayden,<br />
were not only unconstitutional, but would be inflamatory and<br />
create all sorts of problems for the Commission's handling<br />
of industrial disputes, in addition to which Parliament itself<br />
had been deceived. In his reply, Mr. Street said he had received<br />
advice from the Attorney-General which reaffirmed earlier<br />
advice that objections raised by a Deputy President of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, Mr. Justice Staples, did<br />
not show the amendments were in any way unconstitutional. He also<br />
denied the legisl. ation would create problems for the Commission.<br />
Rather they would enhance the integrity of future awards.<br />
Outside the HOUSE!, Mr. Hayden maintained however, that the Government<br />
had set out on a deliberate course to force the amendments<br />
through Parliament at the same time undermining the credibility<br />
of Mr. Justice Staples.<br />
Hayden There is a long record of Judges of various courts in<br />
Australia speaking publicly on matters of concern including<br />
criticism of aspects of rules they have to administer.<br />
What the Government sought to do, however, was to try to<br />
intimidate Justice Staples, to quell any criticism coming<br />
from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and set<br />
about in a most unwholesome way to try to reduce the<br />
man's professional standing and to intimidate him by<br />
suggesting there would be inquiry at the Attorney-General's / 2 </p>

Hayden ( continued)<br />
level; leaked stories about perhaps being called by both<br />
Houses of Parliament to show cause why he should remain<br />
a Judge, when in fact they already have a communication from<br />
all 25 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commissioners<br />
expressing their total dissatisfaction and objection to this<br />
legislation. The whole thing is a contrivance to mislead<br />
the Parliament and to try to duress Justice Staples into<br />
silence. At the same time they have tried to panic<br />
measure the legislation through the Parliament. Now, it is<br />
quite undesirable. What this legislation will do will be to<br />
destroy the credibility of the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
system in this country before disputants who appear before it.<br />
It is unconstitutional anyway. What the Government should<br />
do is withdraw the legislation, revise its position after<br />
consultation with all of the likely parties to these sorts<br />
of processes.<br />
Kampuchea: thousands of refugees are still streaming across<br />
the border into Thailand. Many of them are sick and starving.<br />
Border fighting is intensifying.<br />
A strong earthquake, followed by a series of aftershocks,<br />
has rocked Southern California and Northern Mexico. One person<br />
reported killed and more than 40 injured. There has been<br />
considerable damage to many small towns and communities.<br />
N. S. W. has a new Police Commissioner. He is Mr. Jim Lees,<br />
who has been Acting Commissioner since the resignation of<br />
Mr. Merv Wood in June.<br />
A sit-in by 31 workers at the Union Carbide Plant in<br />
Melbourne has ended after 51 days. It is thought to be the<br />
longest occupation of a workplace by employees in Australia.<br />
The workers locked themselves in the plant after Union Carbide<br />
threatened to use staff labour to perform overtime work, which<br />
has been banned in support of a 35-hour week campaign.<br />
Interview with Mr. Neville Hill of the Victorian Metalworkers<br />
Union.<br />
A New Zealand marine scientist has come up with-a new<br />

The power authority in Tasmania, the Hydro-Electric<br />
Commission, wants the State's next major power development<br />
scheme to be based on the integrated development involving<br />

Trade: Australian manufacturers want to set up a customs<br />
union with New Zealand. The New Zealanders are apparently<br />
not keen on the idea. The Australian businessmen are reported<br />
to be pushing the idea at the Annual Meeting of the<br />
New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement held this year in<br />
New Zealand. 000---</p>
