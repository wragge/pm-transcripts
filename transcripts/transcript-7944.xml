My Friends, Fellow Australians<br />
The message I bring to you today is a message of confidence<br />
in the future of Australia, and a renewed commitment to a<br />
better, fairer future for all Australians.<br />
It is a message based firmly on realism<br />
the realism and substance of our policies for the<br />
future, the fact that the tough and hard decisions we have<br />
had to make for the good of Australia are starting<br />
to work,<br />
the fact that we are building together a nation of<br />
opportunity, fairness and security,<br />
and above all, on the strength of the Australian<br />
people.<br />
My Friends,<br />
I know that we have had to take hard and unpopular decisions<br />
for difficult times.<br />
I know I understand completely that those decisions have<br />
been tough for many decent, hard working Australia":.<br />
But I also know that I would not be fit to lead our great<br />
country if I had chosen the easy, popular way at the cost of<br />
the nation's future.<br />
And anyone however glib or smooth who tells the people<br />
of Australia that the future lies at the end of an easy road<br />
is not fit to be your Prime Minister.<br />
This is not a time for slogans or hollow rhetoric.<br />
It is a time for leadership. It is a time for substance.<br />
It is a time for realistic policies. It is a time for real<br />
answers. Policy Launch<br />
by the Prime Minister,<br />
Bob Hawke<br />
8 March 1990 </p>
<p>2.<br />
It is a time for vision with realism. And now more than<br />
ever, it is a time for stability and unity in government.<br />
And by those tests, the people of Australia have never had a<br />
clearer choice.<br />
And in a very deep sense, the choice lies between two<br />
opposing principles the choice between opportunity and<br />
privilege. This, in the final analysis, is the great divide between<br />
Labor and the Liberal/ National Coalition a profound<br />
difference over goals for the nation, and over a range of<br />
specific issues: taxation, education, training, industrial<br />
relations, health care, child care, superannuation.<br />
ence IOn all these vital issues, you have the decisive difference<br />
a A Labor working to enlarge equality of opportunity for all;<br />
aLiberal/ National coalition working to deny opportunity and<br />
entrench privilege.<br />
My Friends,<br />
the Labor presents a comprehensive, realistic, responsible and<br />
achievable plan for Australia's future:<br />
have A-a plan for continued growth and rising<br />
rtingproductivity; a plan to increase the nation's savings and reduce<br />
on ofthe nation's debt;<br />
ianf..-a strategy to boost exports and replace imports;<br />
k-a strategy to free up international trade and to<br />
4$ tie Australia into the economic boom in Asia and<br />
the Pacific;<br />
sions a framework of education and science policies to<br />
prepare our young people for the challenges of the<br />
have 21st century;<br />
an agenda for a fair society with opportunity open<br />
at to all Australians wherever they were born,<br />
at ofwhatever their background;<br />
a commitment to the right of all Australians to<br />
ple health care through Medicare;<br />
road a plan to protect Australia's precious environment<br />
for all time, for all Australians.<br />
Our plan represents an historic step towards great national<br />
goals:<br />
e. real </p>
<p>: 3.<br />
a modern, growing economy, earning its income,<br />
paying its way through exports to the markets of<br />
the world, re-equipped and restructured in its<br />
attitudes, its institutions and its technology;<br />
a self confident and vigorous partner in the world<br />
economy and in the economy of our region the<br />
region of the future.<br />
Let me emphasise:<br />
The new proposals I present today are achievable,<br />
responsible, fully paid for.<br />
By contrast, our opponents, at last count, had a credibility<br />
gap of $ 6000 million in unfunded promises.<br />
Our new proposals build on our years of hard work together<br />
our work together to create one million six hundred thousand<br />
new jobs, to take 250,000 people off the dole.<br />
The task of managing the Australian economy in these times<br />
of strong growth has, of course, called for rigorous<br />
policies and sometimes tough decisions.<br />
And let me say frankly to all my fellow Australians: there<br />
was no decision tougher for us than to have interest rates<br />
that hurt home buyers and squeezed business.<br />
None of us has enjoyed that.<br />
But our task was to get the right economic climate, so that<br />
the falls, when they came, could be sustained.<br />
Because we've followed the right policies, interest rates<br />
are going down.<br />
And that's the verdict of the banks which set them.<br />
My Friends,<br />
Now is the time for further measures to reform our econoMy<br />
and to improve your living standards.<br />
The first element in-our plan is the wage/ tax and<br />
superannuation package we are presenting for your<br />
endorsement on 24 March.<br />
It is a package which will deliver to the average wage and<br />
salary earner the equivalent of an extra S50 a week in wage<br />
rises and tax cuts, in four stages over the next 16 months.<br />
It is a package which meets fully the tests of economic<br />
responsibility, fairness and foresight.<br />
It is a package which the country can afford. It is a<br />
package which the working men and women of Australia<br />
deserve.<br />
S I </p>
<p>s9o f eIt is siso mneotht insg Wehthicinhg yowuh ichha veth ee aGrnoevde rnbmy eynot uirs whoarkn dainngd out. It<br />
ts restraint. Our package to raise wages and cut taxes responsibly,<br />
world fairly, steadily is central to Labor' s plan for<br />
ae Australia's economic strength.<br />
By stark contrast, our opponents, with breathtaking<br />
irresponsibility, seek to govern without a wages policy.<br />
They have no better idea of the outcome of that lack of<br />
policy, now, than the Leader of the Opposition had last<br />
,) ilityNovember when he said: " Who's to know?*.<br />
But in fact, we do know. We know who would suf fer. We know<br />
it from their record.<br />
. herthe industrial jungle, where the rich, the powerful, the<br />
groups with most industrial muscle, would grab the big but<br />
s h Livoe l d a ins. Pa t e w u d g ve u he l w o<br />
A system that is fair for all would be replaced by a free<br />
for all.<br />
e h reh r iv d g i s<br />
tea Theirs is a recipe for a wages explosion for runaway<br />
t thereinflation for massive unemployment.<br />
It is a recipe to feed higher and higher interest rates.<br />
that It is a recipe to destroy the award restructuring which is<br />
doing so much to reform Australian industry.<br />
: es But there is another, immensely serious, consequence of the<br />
Liberal/ National desire to smash our wage/ tax package and<br />
the Accord with the trade union movement which underpins it.<br />
Australians now have for the first time a national<br />
superannuation scheme which all1 people covered by industrial<br />
awards can enjoy; a benefit which helps fight inflation; a<br />
omy benefit which prepares Australia for the ageing of I'ts<br />
population; and a benefit which the nation and its<br />
businesses, large and small, can afford.<br />
Yet the Liberal/ National coalition would sabotage this<br />
national savings plan, a plan already amassing a huge bank<br />
f or investment in Australia's export and import replacing<br />
and industries.<br />
I 4age<br />
ths. Because of our policies, eight out of ten Australian<br />
employees already get an average of $ 15 a week paid into<br />
their own personal superannuation scheme by their employer.<br />
Over the next three years, under our package, that will<br />
double to $ 30 a week saved for your retirement. 6; 089 </p>
<p>And let me add for those who have retired or are planning<br />
their retirement that no aged or service pensioner will pay<br />
any income tax by 1995.<br />
Every one of the dollars saved through our superannuation<br />
plan helps finance Australia's development without foreign<br />
debt. It's a national savings scheme good for you, good<br />
for Australia.<br />
It's too important to be put at risk.<br />
My Friends,<br />
We need more exports. We need more competitive industry.<br />
We need manufacturing muscle, built on the backbone of our<br />
great mining and agricultural resources.<br />
We have begun, strongly begun, that process.<br />
Under Labor the proportion of people working is at record<br />
levels. They are better educated than ever before, better<br />
trained and working with better tools and technology.<br />
What better base for productivity growth?<br />
And what more complete rebuttal could there be of the<br />
Opposition's putting down of Australia's productivity as<br />
virtually zero than the official figures released here and<br />
overseas just this very week? There's the fact<br />
Australia's productivity is on the rise, and sharply so.<br />
Seven years ago, Australia's steel industry was on the verge<br />
of shutdown.<br />
We have together goverment, unions, employers<br />
transformed the steel industry. Today we are exporting<br />
steel to the world $ 750 million in the last year. The<br />
value of these exports will treble to over $ 2 billion by<br />
1992. Seven years ago, our motor vehicle industry was collapsing<br />
under the weight of self-defeating protection and<br />
inefficient work practices. Today we are shipping<br />
Australian cars and car parts to Japan and the United<br />
States. Our ship building industry has been revitalised. Now the<br />
Europeans can catch a ferry across the English Channel<br />
made in Tasmania.<br />
We are now exporting electronic equipment to Asia,<br />
pharmaceuticals to Europe and optical lenses throughout the<br />
world.<br />
G; 9( </p>
<p>Australia is now one of the world's great tourist<br />
destinations, our telecommunications industry is leading the<br />
way into export markets, and our exports of education,<br />
3 health and legal services are achieving unprecedented<br />
: 1 growth. But we can do more. We must do more.<br />
Earlier in this campaign I outlined Labor's integrated<br />
strategy to boost Australian exports.<br />
And I outlined a ten point plan to lift further the<br />
productivity of our industry.<br />
My Friends,<br />
No longer content to be just the lucky country, Australia<br />
must become the clever country.<br />
To realise that vision I am announcing bold new initiatives<br />
today to build on our substantial achievements in education<br />
and scientific research to unleash the skills and talents<br />
of our people.<br />
When we came to office, thirty six per cent around one in<br />
three children completed high school education. Today,<br />
2 sixty per cent finish Year 12; that's sixty seven thousand<br />
more kids a year with a better chance in life, a new<br />
opportunity for the future.<br />
7ge To assist parents with the financial burden of keeping their<br />
children at school longer, for their children's good and the<br />
country's good, we will introduce a new Education Completion<br />
Allowance. For those students not receiving AUSTUDY, family allowance<br />
for students during the last two years at high school will<br />
be replaced with a payment of $ 300 twice a year a total of<br />
$ 600 and an increase of $ 115 paid at the time when the<br />
demands on parents for books and equipment are greatest.<br />
And we want to encourage that ever-increasing number of<br />
young Australians finishing high school to strive for<br />
excellence. So today I'm announcing the Australian Students Prize.<br />
Five hundred awards of $ 2,000 each will be made to our best<br />
young achievers at the end of Year 12.<br />
And for all these kids finishing school there is now a<br />
greater opportunity than ever before for a job or, if they<br />
choose, a place in universities, TAFE colleges,<br />
apprenticeships and job training.<br />

<p>Australia must reduce ita reliance on imported technology<br />
and borrowed research.<br />
We must become a leader in the production and export of<br />
ideas. My Government has already dramatically boosted our science<br />
and technology potential with a $ 1,000 million package of<br />
initiatives last year.<br />
But to stay abreast and move ahead of the world, we need to<br />
pool the talents of our university, Commonwealth, State and<br />
private sector researchers and link them more effectively to<br />
the rest of the economy.<br />
The Government has now decided to establish a network of<br />
fifty world class Cooperative Research Centres.<br />
These research centres will create additional jobs for about<br />
1,000 talented Australian scientists.<br />
They will be established over the next five years, built<br />
around outstanding research leaders and pooling the talent<br />
of outstanding research groups not only from the CSIRO,<br />
other government research organisations and the<br />
universities, but also from private industry.<br />
When fully established we will be providing $ 100 million a<br />
year in additional funding to support the new centres. Each 2A<br />
research centre will be staffed with a team of highly<br />
skilled scientists, using the latest high tech equipment,<br />
exchanging information around the world making scientific<br />
breakthroughs in medicine, technology, pollution control,<br />
communications. And so, instead of young Australian scientists having to go<br />
to Europe, America and Japan to find the leading edge of<br />
scientific research, we'll have their scientists coning to<br />
Us.<br />
The new centres will be located wherever possible on. or near. i<br />
university campuses, so that research staff can help in the<br />
equally vital task of training young researchers.<br />
This is the most significant step ever taken by a Federal<br />
Government to draw together the strengths of Australian<br />
researchers. It will equip Australians with the scientific<br />
research capacity to take our modern nation into the 21st<br />
century. My Friends,<br />
At the same time we cannot afford to exclude any group of<br />
Australians from making their contribution to the national<br />
mobilisation of resources. </p>

group of<br />

fit and able Australian is unemployable.<br />
We will never accept the proposition that some Australians<br />
are expendable, to be dropped through a trap door and<br />
forgotten. We of fer instead a safety net of training and<br />
re-training for the unemployed.<br />
We will abolish the dole and replace it with a Jobsearch<br />
allowance for those actively seeking work.<br />
For those who cannot find a job after 12 months, there will<br />
be a Newstart allowance, conditional on accepting training<br />
or retraining for available work.<br />
Despite our success In lifting the proportion of children<br />
staying on to finish school, we recognise that some schools<br />
and some kids are still missing out.<br />
Therefore, Labor will provide $ 37 million over three years<br />
to address literacy and learning problems in disadvantaged<br />
schools. Further, we will expand Secondary Education Hostels for<br />
Aboriginal Children.<br />
And we will provide $ 60 million over the next two years to<br />
improve school facilities, equipment and curricula.<br />
My Friends,<br />
There is a new generation of social issues facing those who<br />
live in the outer areas of our cities.<br />
The voluntary groups and State agencies that have to deal<br />
with crisis in peoples' lives, day to day, know that<br />
isolation is becoming a major social problem -isolation from<br />
employment opportunities, from family support, from<br />
education. I now commit my Government to provide, with the States and<br />
voluntary groups, a new level of Commonwealth support. We<br />
will extend marriage counselling services. We will<br />
establish Family Resources Contres. We will support State<br />
efforts to care for teenagers after school. And we will<br />
help provide improved transport for outer urban areas<br />
through the provision of more trains and buses. The total<br />
cost of these measures will be $ 128 million over three<br />
years. My Friends,<br />
In the task of national mobilisation to build a more<br />
productive and competitive economy, the women of Australia<br />
have a key role. Today International Women's Day I<br />
re-affirm our deep commitment to equality of opportunity f or<br />
the women of Australia. It is a commitment to give women a<br />
full say, a real choice and a fair go. I;() 93 </p>
<p>We recognise that if women are to have a real choice, they<br />
need access to child care.<br />
That is why we have established what is already one of the<br />
best systems of child care in the world, and why we will<br />
make it even better more places and more affordable access<br />
to them.<br />
Under our existing child care strategy we will have created<br />
144,000 new child care places by 1992. Of itself that<br />
represents a trebling of child care places since we came to<br />
office. Today I announce that we will be making available additional<br />
funding capable of creating, with the States, another 50,000<br />
child care places over the next five years.<br />
And, further, we will provide the incentive for employers to<br />
extend child care in both the public and private sectors.<br />
We expect an estimated 28,000 new places in employer<br />
provided and commercial centres.<br />
To do this we will greatly increase the fee-relief for low<br />
and middle income families. It will mean, for example, that<br />
a family with a gross income of $ 30,000 a year, with one<br />
child at a child care centre, will receive a fee-relief<br />
benefit of $ 65 a week over twice the benefit currently<br />
paid. And for the first time, we will extend fee-relief to low and<br />
middle income families using commercial child care centres.<br />
Parents are entitled to be confident they are getting<br />
quality attention for their kids, whether they are using<br />
Government -funded or commercial centres. So we will work<br />
with all the key interests in child care to develop a system<br />
of accreditation.<br />
In all, we will spend some $ 400 million in what will<br />
constitute the biggest expansion of child care in I<br />
Australia's history. We estimate there will be a quarter of<br />
a million places by mid-1996.<br />
Last week in Perth, with Premier Carmen Lawrence, I<br />
committed my Government to new policies for womenincluding<br />
a national program for the early detection of<br />
breast cancer, fully funded at $ 64 million over three years.<br />
My Friends,<br />
Central to everything I am putting forward today -and<br />
central to the decision you will make on 24 March -is the<br />
kind of Australia we want for our children.<br />
And that's not just a matter of education and jobs and<br />
opportunities and economic growth. It is, very importantly,<br />
the natural environment they'll inherit. </p>
<p>-he We in this generation have no greater responsibility then t&amp;<br />
pass on intact to future generations Australia's price1. ft<br />
environment.<br />
; ces My Government unequivocally accepts that responsibility,<br />
-tted That I's why we stopped the damming of the Franklin.<br />

the tall forests of Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and<br />

Australia's shores.<br />
58 to We are leading the f ight to prevent mining in Antarctica.,<br />
We are leading the f ight to end the barbaric practice of<br />
drift net fishing in the South Pacific. We are making<br />
strong scientific effort to help tackle the greenhouse Or<br />
low ozone problems and are banning virtually all use of CFUs.<br />
a thatAnd our commitment to the environment will not end there,<br />
B will be making a separate statement on the environment 1Ce<br />
y the coming weeks.<br />
My Friends,<br />
wl and It has been said that those who do not learn the lesson$ Si<br />
res. the past will be condemned to repeat them.<br />
Everything the Coalition has done, and all it still starU<br />
rk for, shows that they have not learned the lessons of th* U~<br />
rk ~ past failures, and that they wish to condemn the nation V<br />
ystem traumatic and socially destructive repetition of them.<br />
I said at the outset that the great divide between usla<br />
between opportunity and privilege.<br />
: ir of There are two key issues in this election which starkl'.<br />
the difference capital gains tax and Medicare. y<br />
The plain fact about the Liberal/ National plan for the<br />
abolition of the capital gains tax is this:<br />
ears. billions of dollars that would have been availablo t-,<br />
education, health, training, roads would be shovel,,<br />
into the pockets of less than one in a hundred<br />
Australian taxpayers.<br />
: he The capital gains tax is a fair tax. The vast majority-.,<br />
wage and salary earners do not pay capital gains tax aze,<br />
never will.<br />
Itly, jAnd you find on Medicare that same conflict between<br />
privilege and opportunity. </p>
<p>For all their confusion, their twisting and turning, the<br />
truth is that the Liberals and Nationals would dismantle<br />
Medicare scrap bulk billing leave two million and more<br />
of our fellow Australians without health cover benefit<br />
only the wealthy and saddle the Australian family once<br />
again with all the burden, the anxiety, the cost, the<br />
inconvenience and the confusion that existed before we<br />
delivered affordable health care to every Australian. 0<br />
I will tell you Q= z policy in two words: Medicare stays.<br />
Fellow Australians,<br />
A party that cannot govern itself cannot govern Australia.<br />
And that's why I've said that your choice on 24 March will<br />
determine whether our highest aspirations for the future are..<br />
to be fulfilled.<br />
We c= n attain stronger national prosperity from a world S<br />
competitive economy greater financial security for<br />
families a ladder of opportunity for all Australiansunshakeable<br />
protection of the natural environment. 0<br />
We can attain these goals in the 1990s.<br />
Under Labor, Australians will attain them.<br />
That is Labor's pledge for Australia's future.<br />
And it is my pledge as Australia's leader.<br />
I don't seek to create false hopes or to raise unrealistic<br />
expectations. There is still hard work ahead of us as a<br />
nation. None of us should be under any illusion about that.<br />
But I make my pledge for the 1990s with confidence because<br />
we have already done much of the hard work, laid the. i<br />
enduring foundations, taken many of the tough decisions in<br />
the 1980s.<br />
Remember: the reascn for those tough decisions and the<br />
discipline in the 1980s was precisely so that we can, with<br />
continued and united effort, create a more secure future, in<br />
a stronger Australia. I<br />
Only Labor can make that continued and united effort-and<br />
only Labor can create that more secure future.<br />
Because only Labor has the plans, the vision, the guts and<br />
the leadership to assure our country's future a future<br />
rich in hope and promise as we approach the threshold of the<br />
21st century. </p>
