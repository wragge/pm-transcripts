    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have called this news conference to make some</p>
<p> comments about the draft preamble which was overwhelmingly approved</p>
<p> in the Coalition Party Room this morning and to answer any questions</p>
<p> that you might have on it.</p>
<p>This preamble, which is the product of a great deal of work and discussion</p>
<p> between myself and in particular one of Australia's finest and</p>
<p> best known poets, Mr Les Murray, is an endeavour on the part of the</p>
<p> Government to express in contemporary and essentially ageless language,</p>
<p> not only some of the historical realities of our country but also</p>
<p> our contemporary values and those things that Australians hold dear</p>
<p> and those things that have a relevance, not only to Australia's</p>
<p> past and present but also to Australia's future.</p>
<p>You are aware of a number of the items that I indicated would be included.</p>
<p> It does include, as I have indicated in a number of interviews, an</p>
<p> acknowledgement of the prior occupation of the land mass of Australia</p>
<p> by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It recognises,</p>
<p> in very clear language, that they were here first. It also honours</p>
<p> their continuing culture and, I think, in language that Australians</p>
<p> will see as both dignified and appropriate.</p>
<p>The text also acknowledges in every generation the contribution of</p>
<p> immigrants to this country. And it is important to remember that this</p>
<p> country has, since European settlement, been a nation that has, in</p>
<p> every generation, received immigrants from different parts of the</p>
<p> world and that process continues.</p>
<p>The draft recognises the democratic federal character of our government.</p>
<p> It also acknowledges that sense of space which is inherent in the</p>
<p> Australian experience, the vastness of this country and the impact</p>
<p> that that has had on the nation's destiny and also on the spirit</p>
<p> and the temper of the Australian people.</p>
<p>It does express the importance in Australian life of a number of concepts.</p>
<p> The freedom that Australians have to express pride, not only in their</p>
<p> country but also in their heritage. And that, of course, is an acknowledgement,</p>
<p> in a very direct way, of the diversity of the backgrounds of so many</p>
<p> Australians. We are naturally stating, in very simple language, our</p>
<p> commitment to those basic freedoms and the right of people to pursue</p>
<p> their own hopes and ideals.</p>
<p>We pay proper regard to excellence as well as fairness to independence</p>
<p> as well as mateship. And let me say, in relation to the word mateship,</p>
<p> that it is one of those words hallowed by the Australian experience</p>
<p> which has a particular resonance, I believe, with all Australians.</p>
<p>It is also a document which seeks to make it plain that we do not</p>
<p> feel overwhelmed by the tall poppy syndrome, that achievement in the</p>
<p> Australian nation is an important quality and an important ideal,</p>
<p> and that the equal dignity and the equal respect that the law affords</p>
<p> to every Australian, irrespective of background or any other distinction,</p>
<p> is not something that should ever be invoked against either excellence</p>
<p> or achievement.</p>
<p>In the very nature of things a document like this is going to be the</p>
<p> subject of a lot of debate. It's never possible, of course, to</p>
<p> have a document that every person in the country agrees with completely.</p>
<p> All you can ever hope to do is to produce a document which most Australians</p>
<p> will feel, in most respects, expresses the sort of things that they</p>
<p> would like to say in a preamble to their Constitution, and that is</p>
<p> what I have sought to do. And I would address that comment obviously</p>
<p> to people who are going to have this or that to say about the draft</p>
<p> preamble.</p>
<p>The other observation I'd make is that it is necessary in a document</p>
<p> like this to have some continuity of poetry and of language. You can't</p>
<p> write a preamble through a meeting of the factions. You can't</p>
<p> write a preamble through a process of negotiation and bargaining.</p>
<p> You can try and embrace in a preamble a series of concepts and express</p>
<p> them in language that people can understand and express them in language</p>
<p> that is dignified without being pompous, which is ageless without</p>
<p> being old-fashioned and is contemporary without being faddish and</p>
<p> understandable only to a section of the Australian community. And</p>
<p> they've been the sort of considerations that I've had in</p>
<p> mind as I've worked over recent weeks.</p>
<p>The document did receive very enthusiastic support in the Joint Party</p>
<p> Room. It is now open for comment. The Government will consider comment.</p>
<p> I'll consider comment not only from the Opposition and other</p>
<p> parties and people in the Parliament but also from different sections</p>
<p> and from individual Australians.</p>
<p>I've already been in receipt of hundreds of preambles and I've</p>
<p> got quite a library of preambles that have been sent to me over recent</p>
<p> weeks and no doubt I will receive some more over the weeks ahead.</p>
<p> But may I say that it's been an extremely fascinating and uplifting</p>
<p> experience to try, in co-operation with a great wordsmith and also</p>
<p> seeking advice from one or two other people, to put together some</p>
<p> words that try and embrace in an appropriate fashion a sense of our</p>
<p> history, a sense of who we are, a sense of what we believe in and</p>
<p> a sense of what we aspire to achieve in the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does the word Âinhabited', referring to Aborigines, also</p>
<p> contain the concept that they would have had custody of the land as</p>
<p> well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it means what it means. The great difficulty with this kind</p>
<p> of language is that it can mean different things to different people.</p>
<p> That's not the purpose of it. But it's meant to be a faithful,</p>
<p> respectful, dignified statement of what is an historical truth. And</p>
<p> that word was chosen because we felt that best expressed what we wanted</p>
<p> to express. And obviously it talks of the history. It's talks</p>
<p> of what happened which obviously was that this land was first occupied</p>
<p> by people who were clearly, they were the only occupants, the custodians</p>
<p> of it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, why did feel unable to go the extra step and mention the</p>
<p> word custodianship especially given that this is going to have no</p>
<p> legal implications?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think this better expresses what happened and in a more poetic</p>
<p> flowing fashion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, just on the word mateship [inaudible] perhaps be perceived</p>
<p> as sounding a little bit Âblokey'? For example, would you</p>
<p> describe or refer to as say, somebody like Jocelyn Newman or your</p>
<p> wife as Âmate'? It's a fairly masculine kind of a word.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let me say a couple of things about that. Firstly it is not true</p>
<p> that this is a subtle attempt to get the vote of the New South Wales</p>
<p> right! That's the first observation I'd make. And a more</p>
<p> important observation is that whatever the origins of the word may</p>
<p> be it has become to occupy I believe a hallowed place in the Australian</p>
<p> lexicon. It really has. And it not only talks of the bonds between</p>
<p> men but it also talks of the bonds between men and women, women and</p>
<p> women, of people. It talks of the spirit of helping people in adversity.</p>
<p> We express mateship when we help people in floods. We express mateship</p>
<p> when we help people in fires. We express mateship when we strive for</p>
<p> days to rescue people who have been buried under the debris of ski</p>
<p> lodges. We do it when we work hard to haul bodies out of train wrecks.</p>
<p> It's an expression that refers to the willingness, the distinctive</p>
<p> willingness of independently minded Australians to help their fellow</p>
<p> countrymen and women in times of adversity. It does also have a particular</p>
<p> historical residence to those who served and died in many cases in</p>
<p> war defending this country. And I would have thought if it has a particular</p>
<p> residence to them, as well as having a resonance to others then it</p>
<p> is an eminently appropriate word to have in the preamble. It does</p>
<p> conjure up to some degree the spirit of Weary Dunlop, and all of those</p>
<p> who can be cast in a similar light, as well as having a more contemporary</p>
<p> meaning. It is the one word in all of this which is so unarguably,</p>
<p> distinctively, and dramatically and proudly Australian. You wouldn't</p>
<p> find it in any other preamble. That is a virtue and a strength, and</p>
<p> not a point or a source of criticism. And I'm also supported,</p>
<p> I might say in my response, by the Australian Oxford Paperback Dictionary</p>
<p> definition of it being "a bond between equal partners or close</p>
<p> friends; comradeship; comradeship as an ideal". I don't</p>
<p> find that exclusively Âblokey' and I don't believe</p>
<p> any fair-minded Australian understanding the history and the spirit</p>
<p> of this country would either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I've said is that I will consider the comments that have</p>
<p> been made. Obviously if I had an utterly closed mind I wouldn't</p>
<p> consider any comments. I will of course consider comments but I should</p>
<p> also say that a great deal of careful thought has gone into this.</p>
<p> And you can't negotiate something like this. In the end somebody</p>
<p> has got to make a decision and if you adopt the process of bargaining,</p>
<p> and parlaying, and negotiating, you can end up having a very ugly,</p>
<p> lumpy, piece of prose which nobody feels particularly happy about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What were the influences on you as one of the prime authors of the</p>
<p> preamble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my own feeling about this country. The history; the contribution</p>
<p> of the original Australians; the contribution of immigration; the</p>
<p> sense of space that I've always felt about Australia and the</p>
<p> impact that that has had and continues to have. A desire to say something</p>
<p> about our commitment to excellence and achievement, to put aside this</p>
<p> notion that we are burdened by the tall poppy syndrome, and that is</p>
<p> certainly apparent in the penultimate paragraph. They are some of</p>
<p> the things. And obviously the egalitarian nature of the country. The</p>
<p> quality of people before the law. And the other thing that I wanted</p>
<p> to do was to have a preamble that was not full of whereas' and</p>
<p> humbly relyings, because it is 1999, we are on the verge of the 3rd</p>
<p> millenium, and what was appropriate and dignified and poetic, and</p>
<p> what sang to Jefferson and others doesn't sound so poetic and</p>
<p> dignified and sing in 1999 and I think you do need something that</p>
<p> has a contemporary relevance without being an indecipherable sort</p>
<p> of dirge from a hard rock concert.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can you explain the Âfreedom for fashion'? What's</p>
<p> behind the use of Âfashion'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that means that you can't be sort of over-borne by a passing</p>
<p> fad and that's, you know, that's a gentle rebuke to political</p>
<p> correctness.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] largely your draft rather than Les Murray's?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's a lot of Murray in it. The poetry in it is. I certainly</p>
<p> contributed the ideas. Les Murray wrote and then we talked again and</p>
<p> he re-wrote. I also took some advice from a couple of people close</p>
<p> to me on my staff, Catherine Murphy and Michael L'estrange. They</p>
<p> contributed ideas. I talked to my Cabinet colleagues about it. There</p>
<p> were one or two changes there, several changes there. I think it's</p>
<p> fair to say that the bulk of it is a combination of Murray and Howard,</p>
<p> but listening to other people. There's a lot of Les Murray in</p>
<p> it. I mean he will speak for himself in relation to it. But we worked</p>
<p> together very closely on it and I spoke to him a few moments ago and</p>
<p> told him that it had been warmly applauded in the Party Room, and</p>
<p> he was very pleased about that. But he will speak for himself. I never</p>
<p> presume to speak for people in his situation. But certainly he contributed</p>
<p> a great deal. I did. Others helped and I'm very grateful to all</p>
<p> of them and I am very proud of this product. I feel very happy with</p>
<p> it. I think it reads nicely. I think it expresses what so many people</p>
<p> feel about our country. And it's not offensive in my view to</p>
<p> anybody. It's something that is republic neutral, and it's</p>
<p> the sort of statement that I believe Australians in 20, 30, 50 years</p>
<p> time would feel happy about it, and that's very important. You</p>
<p> can't sort of assume that what, as I said earlier rang and sang</p>
<p> a few hundred years ago necessarily works the same today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could you specify a bit more about the processes that took place here?</p>
<p> How long did you spend with Les Murray....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what happened Tony was this: that I, as you know, started talking</p>
<p> about this a few weeks ago and I rang Mr Murray up, and I'd never</p>
<p> met him before. I knew of him. And I think I may have met him in a</p>
<p> group, at a dinner about 15 years ago. And he came here and then we</p>
<p> went to the Lodge and we talked. And then he did a draft and he faxed</p>
<p> it to me. And then I had a talk to him and he sent me another draft.</p>
<p> And then we played around further and then I also sought the views</p>
<p> of my colleagues on it, and I also took the liberty, at one stage,</p>
<p> of showing the draft to Professor Blainey, the person, the historian,</p>
<p> the whom I have an immense respect. And there weren't...I</p>
<p> mean, the changes and the evolving character of the document were</p>
<p> largely, were overwhelmingly the product of exchanges between myself</p>
<p> and Mr Murray. But I did take it to Cabinet on a couple of occasions</p>
<p> and in response to comments and suggestions made by my colleagues</p>
<p> there and nuances or preferences expressed for nuances there, they</p>
<p> were reflected. And, basically, I talked to Michael L'Estrange</p>
<p> and to Catherine about it quite extensively and right at the end I</p>
<p> showed it to the bard O'Leary.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, if I could just turn for one minute from the preamble.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, could we just deal with the preamble?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] If, as expected, the Democrats oppose this in the Senate</p>
<p> you'll have to mount a formal Âno' case against the</p>
<p> preamble...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They will if they vote against it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I mean, [inaudible] a formal Âno' case, is not the case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'll deal with that when it comes. I'm not making</p>
<p> any forward commitments about funding Âno' cases. To mount</p>
<p> a Âno' case against the preamble, to formally campaign against</p>
<p> it, that's an interesting proposition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you seek any religious advice in relation to the reference to</p>
<p> God?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Did I seek the advice of any men or women of the Church? No, I didn't.</p>
<p> I think one of those things where a mere layman is appropriately qualified</p>
<p> to have a view as to how you might refer to God. I think the formulation</p>
<p> of Âwith hope in God' is more contemporary, is softer, is</p>
<p> better than perhaps humbly relying on the blessing, which was nice</p>
<p> then but perhaps not quite as appropriate. And I hope that those in</p>
<p> the Australian community who have a reservation about referring to</p>
<p> God will see this as an appropriate way, if you are to refer to the</p>
<p> Almighty, the appropriate way of doing so and I believe it is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you have any plans to visit the towns hit by Cyclone</p>
<p> Vance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do I have any plans to what?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>To visit the towns in Western Australia hit by Cyclone Vance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll be talking to Mr Court in a few moments, as soon as</p>
<p> this press conference is over. Mr Court and I are going to have a</p>
<p> discussion and he's going to bring me up-to-date. And the question</p>
<p> of what I may or may not do and so forth, I'll determine after</p>
<p> that discussion. Clearly I am distressed, as all Australians are,</p>
<p> of the damage that has been done. There are disaster relief arrangements</p>
<p> in place under which federal money is automatically available to help</p>
<p> people who are affected to a certain degree, to the requisite degree,</p>
<p> and that will naturally operate in relation to this and I'll</p>
<p> get a full briefing from the Western Australian Premier shortly after</p>
<p> this news conference.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just on the...can you confirm that the Government</p>
<p> has received a submission from Singapore Airlines and News Corp that</p>
<p> Singapore Airlines fly 50 per cent of Ansett and if so has the Government</p>
<p> formed a view on that at this stage?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are reports in the press this morning. I obviously did</p>
<p> meet Mr Murdoch, Mr Eddington and the Chief Executive of Singapore</p>
<p> Airlines yesterday. I think it's up to those companies to talk</p>
<p> about any commercial plans they may have. It's not for the Government</p>
<p> to talk about things. If the Government was to talk about those things,</p>
<p> let me say this, that the relevant laws would apply and the relevant</p>
<p> laws, if there were any proposal in the wind, the relevant laws relating</p>
<p> to foreign take-overs are well known and the laws relating to competition</p>
<p> are well known. At present Ansett is owned by two corporations, both</p>
<p> of which are foreign. And in terms of foreign investment, hypothetically</p>
<p> speaking, a transfer from News to Singapore Airlines would be a foreigner-to-foreigner</p>
<p> transaction.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that politicians on all sides of the Parliament</p>
<p> have access to a loophole which Keith Wright [inaudible] superannuation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's always necessary in these things, George, to look</p>
<p> at the totality of the remuneration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you any advice yet on what form of examination or investigation</p>
<p> you may follow and what exactly are you looking for?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will get some advice from the Attorney-General and when that's</p>
<p> been received, if it's appropriate to say anything further we</p>
<p> will. I don't wish to say any more. The issue's been very</p>
<p> well publicised and I don't think it's right in something</p>
<p> like this that the thing be treated other than seriously and carefully</p>
<p> in a totally transparent fashion and in a manner which is fair to</p>
<p> everybody who was mentioned in the programme and also fair to the</p>
<p> public interest because the allegations made are weighty allegations,</p>
<p> serious ones, and I don't intend to play the political game over</p>
<p> them. Thank you.</p>
