PRIME MAINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 AUGUST 1990<br />
I will be visiting Japan between 16-20 September at the<br />
invitation of the Japanese Government.<br />
My program on 17 and 18 September will be devoted largely<br />
to assisting with the presentation of Melbourne's bid for<br />
the 1996 Olympic Games.<br />
My official visit will take place on 19 and 20 September.<br />
It will be my first full bilateral visit to Japan since<br />
1986. Much has changed in our bilateral relationship,<br />
and in the world at large, since then and I will discuss<br />
the direction of our relations with Japan, particularly<br />
our important economic links, global and regional<br />
strategic issues, and co-operation in areas such as<br />
science and technology, the environment, culture and<br />
education. I will be having talks with Prime Minister Kaifu and with<br />
key Japanese political and business leaders. I will be<br />
making an address to the annual convention of the All<br />
Chambers of Commerce in Japan and opening Australia's new<br />
embassy building in Tokyo. </p>
