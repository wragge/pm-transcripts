PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 APRIL 1991<br />
The final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal<br />
Deaths in Custody is to be presented by 26 April 1991. The<br />
report will not be available publicly until it has been<br />
tabled in Federal Parliament, probably in early May.<br />
Reports on individual deaths have been made public as they<br />
have been presented and tabled. By the end of March, 78<br />
reports had beEtn tabled and the remaining 21 are expected to<br />
become publicly available in April. The final report's<br />
recommendations will relate to the circumstances of<br />
individual deaths, as well as canvassing the underlying<br />
social, economic, and cultural issues contributing to those<br />
deaths. In addition to their immediate importance to the families of<br />
people whose deaths have been investigated, the Royal<br />
Commission's fiLndings are expected to be of international<br />
interest as well as of national significance.<br />
I have asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the<br />
Hon. Robert Tickner MP, to assume responsibility for<br />
coordination of the Commonwealth Government consideration of<br />
the final report.<br />
I have written to all Premiers and Chief Ministers to<br />
suggest that the Commonwealth, the States and the<br />
Territories continue to work together to develop a joint<br />
strategy of response to the final report's findIngs and<br />
recommendations. I have asked the Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers to set in train a liaison process with Mr Tickner. I; 8 </p>
