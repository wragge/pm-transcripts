    <content><![CDATA[<p>CHAMBER OF M\ UFACTURES OF JEI SOUTH JALES,<br />ANNUAL DINjIER, SYDNEY 16th SEPTEiABER, 1964<br />Speech by the Prime Minister. the Rt. Ho. Sir Robert Menzies<br />Sirs, Your Excell. ency<br />I am speaking tonight at a great disadvantage.<br />Jell, as you know, I usually do. I looked at the programme<br />of the sports, as you might say, and I realised that I was<br />the first. Now that is a position I don't caro for,<br />except, of course, in my capacity as a cold-blooded dictator.<br />I am going to be replied to by young Ferrier here who has<br />all the advantage of being able to disagree with me with<br />exquisite courtesy and then Mr. Pettingell who is a strange<br />mixture of a man he's in the gas busiress as I am, he's<br />in the manufacturing business for some reason that I don't<br />understand and he's a banker for some reason that, technically,<br />I don't understand. And I thought for a moment he was going<br />to be replied to by John Renshaw and indeed here is Pat<br />Hills here tonight. You think of what mischief he'll make<br />of me! Henry Bolte won't be in the same street' And then<br />my old friend Mr. Herford is going to speak and then Harry<br />Jensen, When I've made a mess of it and even somebody else<br />has made a mess of it, he turns up and leaves us all for<br />dead. Great pity. I regret that he didn't become the Member<br />for East Sydney, And do you know why I regret it? Because<br />I really thought that that would have given us our cnly<br />chance of fixing him up. You know what I mean. But instead<br />of that no no, there he is. Anyhov" good luck to him, as<br />long as he lays off this strenge idea that Tullamarine is<br />to be the chief international airport.<br />Do you know, gentlemen, that about a w ek<br />eight days nine days ago, I found that in a moment of<br />sickness when I was in my bed, I had agreed to make a speech<br />here to another Association The Australian Industries<br />Development Association. So I came down, and I made whac<br />you might loosely call a powerful speech and I looked around<br />the pecple to whom I was talking and I realised with a<br />horrible clutch at the heart that they were just the same<br />gang qs I would be spealzing to tonight. And, consequently,<br />I am at a very great disadvantage. I admit that with<br />exquisite courtesy........ And so with your kind permission,<br />when I go back to Canberra early in the morning, I will<br />tell Dan Minogue that as a special compliment to him the<br />clock rang. ( Laughter) Now, you members of the N. S. U. Chamber of<br />Manufactures I hope that's right have been beguiling or<br />ordering me here for many years and I've had a variety of<br />experiences. I can remember believe it or not occasions<br />on which when I stood up to speak the people applauded.<br />This is a very happy memory on my part and I remember on one<br />occasion ( I think it must have been in 1952 when we had a<br />painfully unpopular Budget) that I arrived here and walked<br />in and somebody proposed my health in the most offensive<br />possible terms, everybody applauded him like mad. I won't<br />mention him you all know him and then I got up to reply<br />and was received with great courtesy by two members who<br />said ( slow applause) well, even two are better than none</p>
<p>2<br />from the point of view of the politician and I remember on that<br />occasion you will remember this Sir, I said that there was<br />a musical comedy coming on in Melbourne which ultimately was<br />bound to reach the provinces in which the theme song, slightly<br />altered for my purpose was " One Enchanted Evening" " One<br />Enchanted Evening, you will see a supporter across a crowded<br />and that was true, and mind you, you've been much<br />better ever since. I must say that for you. You've had your<br />civilised moments in dealing with me. Therefore tonight<br />perhaps I might have a civilised moment or two to speak tc you.<br />I've been thinking about manufacturing and doing<br />a little manufacturing of my own, no doubt, and hearing about<br />manafacturing and being indoctrinated for a lorg time, and I<br />said the other night, somewhere else, my earliest political<br />recollection is being told by my father who strangely enough<br />had great dynamic violence and lack of toleration in his view<br />not a bit like me, And I remember my earliest lesson at my<br />father's knee they talk about your mothel's knee but it is<br />my father's knee was that the. one thing to be iun. erstood in<br />Australia was that we must hive manufacturing and we must have a<br />protective tariff. Now some of you gentlemen may think that in the<br />course of time I've wandered a little off the course, but this is<br />when I was fourteen years old, and at fourteen years old, in my<br />experience, you don't quarrel with your father. ' Jell, that's<br />not true in the case of my own children but it was in our cae,<br />And so from the very beginning of my political life, I've understood<br />something about protection and I've understood something<br />about the reasons for it, but i have never succumbea to the<br />easy arguments which occdsionally were produced against the<br />creation of manufacturing in Australia. And therefore I say to<br />you, as I've said many times before, this matter has gone beyond<br />argument. I believe that there are sume settled policies in<br />Australia, national policies, policies which are shared by all<br />parties and one of them is that we must do -eaerything we can to<br />develop secondary industry in Australia and in recent years we've<br />added to this. And to develop the capacity of secondary<br />industry to export to the rest of the world.<br />Nowr, Sir, this is easy enough to say but I think<br />we've become sophisticated enough, haven't we, to have a look<br />at this and to consider its implications. WJhen I was this small<br />boy of sixteen, short and thin, people imagined that the great<br />argument in life was whether you were a protectionist or a free<br />trader and even later on in my life, there was a great argument<br />as to whether you believed in secondary industry or primary<br />industry as these were two branches of industry fighting with<br />each other. Now I do hope that we've grown out of that.<br />Ue are now Australians and we are Australians in a country in<br />which farming, grazing, manufacturing, tertiary industries<br />retailing industries are all engaged in some or other aspect of<br />total national effort. This is the one thing I think that we<br />must now come to learn because I will assume that you are all<br />manufacturers. Let me therefore at once say to you that being<br />manufacturers you are also the greatest importers in the<br />country that's right isn't it? Because if you were to analyse<br />the volume of imports into Australia you would find thac the<br />bulk of the imports came in as raw materials, and as plant and<br />as equipment for manufacturing industry. And therefore I address<br />you as manufacturers, and I address you as major importers.<br />This is something worth remembering. When I address you as<br />manufacturers and importers, I address you as major employers / 3</p>
<p>-3-<br />in Australia. You can't get this thing off on to particular<br />sections or groups. You are great employers and because you<br />are great employers, you represent a body of activity without<br />which we couldn't have an immigration programme at all.<br />So I emphasise that immigration. It is to the<br />lasting credit of my opponent in the Federal Parliament, Mr.<br />Calwell, that he was the Minister who had enough courage to<br />start a major imigration movement in this country after the<br />war, And I have never hesitated to pay tribute to it. But<br />we have gone on with it. And this year7 were importing<br />that's the right word we are bringing into Australia a greater<br />number of immigrants than we have for a long long time. They<br />come here expecting to work.<br />They could not come here without any genuine<br />expectation of work unless we had been wise enough and you<br />had been wise enough to develop enormous manufacturing,<br />secondary activity in Australia. Because, of all the migrants<br />who come here, very few go on to the land. The land has<br />succeeded in producing more and more with fewer and fewer<br />people, for obvious reasons. And therefore I've never been<br />able to discuss an immigration programmne without saying to<br />myself, " Well, this can't succeed unless we have a great<br />manufacturing programme. Secondary industry and immigration<br />are intimately bound together," And therefore I might describe<br />you not only as great producers and great importers, but as<br />great immigrators, and this is worth thinking abcut,<br />You see my point I want you to give up, if I<br />may say so, thinking about yourselves as specialists in a<br />special field, In reality. manufacturing today has become the<br />general practitionere You must not regard yourselves as merely<br />concerned with manufacturing, but you are concerned with<br />importing, you are concarned with immigration, and indeed<br />nowadays you re concerned with exporting. I know there are<br />people who think in a rath. er shallow way that a little flush<br />of inflation does no harm, it will improve the equities and it<br />will reduce the burden of the debentures you know what I mean<br />a little bit of inflation.<br />In the short run yes, I can understand that some<br />people, in the short run, will think that a little bit of<br />inflation does no harm, like a little bit of something I would<br />mention in other circumstances. This is not true. In the<br />short run it may be, but in the long run your interests and my<br />interests and all the interests of all the responsible people<br />in Australia depend upon having a reasonable stability of the<br />currency, so that people will save money and not be afraid, so<br />that they will save money for investment and not be afraid, so<br />that the loan market will be healthy, and unless the loan<br />market is healthy I say to you, quite frankly we will either<br />have to stop a lot f works of development which are vital from<br />your point of view, or we will have to increase taxes to an<br />exorbitant extent. And, therefore, you have in the long run a<br />tremendous interest in the stability of the currency. And then<br />there are two other matters in which you are interestedo<br />I've mentioned the others.<br />If I may say so, Mr. President and Your Excellency,<br />you are interested as citizens, because we have too much<br />disposition, even in our own relatively small country, to divide<br />ourselves into a body of special interest, or a body of special<br />pressure groups. We've only eleven million people. We've<br />never lived in the whole course of our lives in a state of<br />go 60/ 4</p>
<p>4<br />greater risk than that in which we live today. We have only<br />to look on the map north of ourselves to realise that some of<br />the greatest and most crucial events in modern history are<br />occurring near to us. And we're not frightened of our fears<br />it's not in our nature to be frightened but it is essential<br />that in looking at all these matters that are going on, we<br />should remember that we are one people with one vital interest.<br />And, therefore, wha' I've baen saying to you tonight is designed<br />to indicate that we must not just think of ourselves as manufacturers<br />but think of ourselves as importers, think of ourselves<br />as employers of migrant labour, think of ourselves in a variety<br />of capacitieso This is essential, because given Australia is<br />a united nation, we're not going to be easily overthrown by other<br />people, And that means, Sir, coming to the end of this<br />exercise, that the interesting thing, the obvious thing but at<br />the sama time the uncommon thing, is that we're all citizens<br />of one country, citizens of no mean country. Don't let us take<br />too much time off to argue with some other section or some other<br />group. Let us defend our interests, of course this is auite<br />right, but let us always have in mind that, whether you're a<br />manufacturer or a farmer or a grazier or even a poor wretched<br />politician, you are subordinate to one great thing and that<br />is the interest of our countryo<br />Now, Sir, I knew this is well understood, I know<br />as well aj most people could know how manufacturing industry<br />has understood these things, has worked on these things, and I<br />as the head of the Cormonwealth Government am immeasurably<br />indebted to your representatives for the advice that we ask for<br />and receive from time to t. me. I don't want to underestimate<br />that at all. I bops it will go on mo. re and more and mcre. But<br />in proposing the health of Austrolian indisstry. I vwould like to<br />make it clear that I am not proposing the health of a foreigner,<br />but proposing the hedlth of somathing which is in the va:' y web<br />of our national beingo Now have I made that clear?<br />I'm happy, and if I haven t made it clear, you<br />will still be happy to join with me in drinking the health of<br />Au., ralian industryo '-3</p>
