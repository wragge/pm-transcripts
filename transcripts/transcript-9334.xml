SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL CAPITAL APPEAL<br />
THURSDAY, 25 AUGUST 1994<br />
When I launched the ' Australia Remembers' program here only last week I<br />
expressed my affection for this place and my high regard for the work that is<br />
done here.<br />
For a long time now the Memorial has been the most visited museum or<br />
gallery in Australia. Attendances this year are booming. I understand that<br />
more than 900,000 people will visit this year. They come, I think, as Manning<br />
Clark once put it, ' to understand what it means to be Australian'.<br />
This Memorial is a great national institution which touches the lives of millions<br />
of Australians and we want to see it continue to grow.<br />
It must never get out of touch with the times, or grow inward looking and<br />
parochial. The message of the Memorial must remain powerful and persuasive from one<br />
generation to the next. Therefore its galleries are bound to need regular<br />
renovation and renewal.<br />
I am pleased to say that over the last decade the Commonwealth government<br />
has played its part in seeing that we meet this responsibility.<br />
The Memorial has a professional and well-qualified staff and a collection that<br />
is well-housed, well-documented and secure.<br />
But a much greater challenge now presents itself. Over the next decade all<br />
of the Memorial's major galleries will be renewed in order to tell their stories<br />
coherently and comprehensively in a language that today's visitors and<br />
tomorrow's will understand.<br />
The Memorial has embarked on an exciting and ambitious program and today<br />
I announce the launch of a Capital Appeal which aims to raise the necessary<br />
million over the next three to five years.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has given the lead gift of $ 2.5 million to<br />
renew the Pacific War Gallery. We announced this in the May Budget. </p>
<p>2<br />
In addition the Budget also allowed for an increase of $ 2 million annually to<br />
the Memorial's base funding.<br />
This injection of funds will guarantee that the building is sound, that there is<br />
an adequate and qualified staff for the tasks ahead, and that the collection is<br />
properly managed and developed.<br />
A great deal of work has gone into the preparations for the launch of this<br />
appeal. In each state and territory the Memorial has established advisory groups<br />
made up of business and community leaders. These men and women are<br />
giving their time freely and generously and I thank them for that.<br />
The first stage of the appeal is aimed at corporate Australia. Only in the<br />
second stage will the general public be called on for donations. I have no<br />
doubt that both stages will meet with a generous response.<br />
In launching the appeal today I also invite state governments to demonstrate<br />
their support perhaps by collectively matching the Commonwealth's gift of<br />
million.<br />
While we cherish what has been achieved at the Memorial, we cannot fail to<br />
see what needs to be done.<br />
This Pacific War Gallery is a perfect example of the story half told.<br />
It was at Milne Bay and on the Kokoda Track that Australian troops turned<br />
back the Japanese. It was in the Pacific War that the battle for Australia was<br />
won. The story of those battles and the spirit of the Australians who were engaged<br />
in them must be told here at the Australian War Memorial and with<br />
government and public support it will be.<br />
I congratulate the Council, the Director and his staff for deciding to embark<br />
upon the challenge of renewal, and all those who have worked so hard to<br />
establish this Capital Appeal.<br />
I sincerely hope that state governments, business and the community at large<br />
, will respond: and I am confident that they will because each year, by coming<br />
here in such numbers, they prove their affection for the Memorial and their<br />
respect for the Australian men and women whose great sacrifice is honoured<br />
here. It is a great national cause, and it is with pleasure that I now launch it.<br />
CANBERRA August 1994 </p>
