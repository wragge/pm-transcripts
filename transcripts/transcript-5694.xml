Atw. tralia is a Å parse, dry continent, and the availability of<br />
good. water. supplies has alwaye-b-een crij-ical to our.-developiient.<br />
The great water projects of earlier yeart, have been landmnarks<br />
in our economic progress as a nation. ProjeCtfS such as the<br />
Snowy Mountains Scerehave reant an enormous amnownt to<br />
Australia, and it is* plain that dellandi prr our limited water<br />
resources will increase in the years ahe-<br />
The Goverrnm,_ nt recent-ly t-ook the historic decision what we inust<br />
develop a perspeotive on Australia's total water resource needs<br />
rigjht through to the year 2000. Such a perbpective will be<br />
essential in developing a stratecly to nmeet AuStralia'F water<br />
requirements through the 1980' s and l990' t. Tlo achieve the necessary<br />
perFpective, an invcntigation and study will be undcrtaken by<br />
the JDepartrinent of National Development and Energy, in collaboration<br />
with r-elevant water avthoritieEs and other organisationn.<br />
The Govexrnient believes we need an updated assessmnent of all<br />
Australian water resources, including undergjround as well as<br />
surface water, in term-s of both quality and quantity. We need<br />
estirnates of current water usage, we nieed to know the---iandf<br />
ex! enditurez on wa-.; ter resource dvel~ ipt, and we need to excemine<br />
. tthe implications of future demands,<br />

As-a result of ' this decision, the co~ rit. Lnity-will have available<br />
to__ it in. feouc<br />
to _____ ormation which %,, ill give us guidance in water rsuc<br />
development right througjh-to tbt-i end of this. ci'ntury, so that<br />
we can use our management and planining skills to prevent<br />
inadequacies in water supplieo from imposing avoidabhle limitations<br />
on the development of Australia.<br />
This initiative on the part of the Commonwealth Government in<br />
relation to water resources is obviously very much in harmony<br />
with the New R~ iver Murray Water., Agroerflent which wiis entered into<br />
by the three State Goverrnents and the Comonwealth a few weeks ago<br />
which-wri result in effective and co-operative managemtent of the<br />

We must have an adequate research base to ' Fupport whbatever<br />
