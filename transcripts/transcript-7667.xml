CH{ ECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MISTR OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE HON R J L HAWKE AC MP<br />
BANQUET DINN( ER HOSTED BY CHANCELLOR KOHL<br />
BONN THURSDAY 29 JUNE 1989<br />
I am delighted to be in Bonn, Mr Chancellor, to return your<br />
visit to Australia last October, for our Australian<br />
Bicentenary; and it is a very great pleasure to be able to<br />
renew our friendship and resume our discussions so soon.<br />
Your visit, the first ever by a Federal Chancellor,<br />
represented a milestone in the relations between our two<br />
countries. There is clearly a growing awareness in both<br />
countries of the mutual value of our even broader<br />
co-operation at all levels. That is the goal of my vst<br />
It is a goal I k~ now you share.<br />
It is, Mr chancellor, an invigorating indeed inspiring<br />
experience to be here at such a momentous period in the<br />
history of the peoples of Europe. In such an historic, and<br />
so hopeful a process, Germany stands centre stage.<br />
Today, a revitalised Germany, transformed in forty years by<br />
the energy and determination of its people, is playing a<br />
pivotal role in Europe and in East-West relations. The<br />
German economy exerts a tremendous influence in the world<br />
economic system. There is renewed interest in the rich<br />
heritage of German culture and language.<br />
Mr Chancellor,<br />
In coming here to renew and extend our relationship, I build<br />
on very long and strong human associations between our<br />
peoples.<br />
= F! rom the earliest days ,7; rEuropean settlement, people of<br />
German origin have made a valuable contribution to<br />
Australian life. For the first hundred and fifty years,<br />
German people and their descendants formed by far our<br />
largest community of non-Anglo-Celtic origin. Today, in our<br />
richly diverse and vibrant multicultural society, they<br />
remain a vital and valued part.<br />
PRIME MINISTER A<br />
Jot </p>
<p>Now, both our countries are vigorous Federal democracies.<br />
Now, we share a deep commitment to parliamentary democracy<br />
and the rule of law. Now both countries draw a significant<br />
part of our economic strength and political stability from<br />
the contribution of strong, free and responsible trade union<br />
movements. Both our countries are committed members of the Western<br />
Alliance. We have each made a contribution to more<br />
constructive relations between East and West in our<br />
respective regions. We co-operate closely with each other,<br />
as staunch members of the United Nations, on the great<br />
issues of disarmament and arms control, nuclear<br />
non-proliferation, and human rights. That co-operation is<br />
also now expanding to embrace international environmental<br />
issues. And I refer here in particular to our useful<br />
discussions today on the Antarctic.<br />
When we met in Canberra last year, Mr chancellor, we gave<br />
special attention to encouraging greater contact between our<br />
respective business communities. You were accompanied in<br />
Canberra by a number of leaders of German industry; and I<br />
have now travelling with me distinguished representatives of<br />
Australian industry. Senior officials of our two<br />
governments met in Canberra in early May. for the inaugural<br />
session of annual economic consultations. The very<br />
successful Business Meeting I attended in Cologne yesterday<br />
underlined the potential for the development of a more<br />
dynamic economic relationship between us.<br />
These exchanges are all valuable in identifying<br />
opportunities which our private sectors will, I am sure,<br />
follow up with vigour.<br />
Mr Chancellor, the European Community, particularly the<br />
Federal Republic, as the world's largest exporter, has a<br />
huge stake in a healthy multilateral trading system, and in<br />
the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round.<br />
Australia looks forward to working with the Federal Republic<br />
of Germany in achieving a comprehensive and balanced result.<br />
We welcomed, Mr Chancellor, your personal assurances last<br />
October in Canberra that the European single market, planned<br />
for 1992, will not, as you put it, come to resemble a<br />
fortress. We urge you to continue your efforts to ensure<br />
" that the single rarketW 16 indeed be a free and fair market<br />
place for all. </p>
<p>May I make it very clear, Hr Chancellor, notwithstanding our<br />
caution on specific areas of direct economic concern as we<br />
discussed them with great frankness today, in particular our<br />
concerns over the Common Agricultural Policy Australia<br />
regards the growing unity of Europe as of potentially vast<br />
political importance and benefit. Apart from the economic<br />
importance of a single market of 320 million, European<br />
integration has already transformed the historical political<br />
relationships between the nations of Europe. It has placed<br />
Europe in a position where it can have an even more<br />
influential role in world affairs. These are developments<br />
which we welcome unreservedly.<br />
Mr Chancellor,<br />
Your country has experienced in the sharpest and most direct<br />
way the tensions and the traumas of East-West confrontation.<br />
You have witnessed at first hand the measureless tragedy of<br />
families and neighbours divided by the barriers of fear and<br />
imposed dogmas. Yet we are seeing those barriers coming<br />
down. Today, we are witnessing immensely important changes. in<br />
the Soviet Union, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the quest<br />
for economic progress is now being joined to political<br />
reform, enhanced human rights, demands for free expression,<br />
greater openness in the conduct of public affairs as<br />
inevitably it must, as ultimately it will be, everywhere.<br />
For the first time for more than forty years, we are seeing<br />
co-operation from the East in arms control and the search<br />
for resolution to regional conflict.<br />
Mr Chancellor,<br />
Australia pays tribute to the constructive and responsible<br />
role which the Federal Republic, as a key member of NATO,<br />
has played over the years in East-West relations and the<br />
pursuit of arms reductions. Your personal role has been<br />
important indeed constructive, realistic, balanced,<br />
far-seeing.<br />
Australia also, as a member of the Western alliance, is<br />
proud to play its part in maintaining global stability,<br />
while at the same time working unceasingly for progress in<br />
arms control and disarmament.<br />
T-:-refer in this conteie~ d oir-work in favour of a global<br />
ban on chemical weapons and our proposal to hold a<br />
conference of Government and industry representatives on the<br />
trade in chemicals with potential use in the manufacture of<br />
chemical weapons. I look forward to high-level West German<br />
participation in this Conference, by Government and<br />
industry. </p>
<p>Mr Chancellor,<br />
Our talks today have confirmed that the scope for expanded<br />
co-operation between our two countries is excellent. our<br />
Governments are committed to it. So are our business<br />
communities. I am confident this visit, which my wife and<br />
I, together with my Australian colleagues in government and<br />
business, will long remember with warmth and gratitude, will<br />
advance that co-operation substantially-<br />
Hr Chancellor,<br />
There can be na dinphi-w~ b At~ ni at-a riiuial anA r-haiinwjinry<br />
paifz in ene artairs iio Qai. Ly vZ Euzupei, buL of all<br />
humanity. It is nothing less than the turning point of the<br />
nuclear age; and upon the direction we now take, the<br />
decisions we make, depends, quite literally, the future,<br />
indeed, the very existence, of civilisation. Because of<br />
these immense stakes, the responsibilities, challenges, and<br />
opportunities for leadership have never been as great, since<br />
the dawn of the nuclear age. No country in Europe<br />
understands better than Germany how muuch is at stake. It is<br />
that deep understanding on the part of the German people and<br />
leadership, Mr Chancellor, combined with their commitment to<br />
democracy, which provides one of the great sources of hope,<br />
in this new era a bright new hope, for Germany, for<br />
Europe, and for all the friends of Europe and Germany<br />
throughout the world not least the firm friend you<br />
certainly have, in Australia. </p>
