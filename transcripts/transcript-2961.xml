PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY, 26 JUNE 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks gentlemen. The Cabinet sat in Sydney<br />
yesterday morning and afternoon and here in Canberra this<br />
morning. Most of the time yesterday was devoted to the<br />
briefing for the Treasurer, Mr Crean, and myself at the Premiers'<br />
Conference in Canberra next Thursday and Friday. Clearly,<br />
I can't give you any information or answer any questions about<br />
this because it is clearly portion of the general Budget<br />
situation. I can, however, give you several other decisions.<br />
I think I told you last week that I had just<br />
received or was just about to receive Sir John Crawford's<br />
report on what we tentatively called a " Protection Commission"<br />
to succeed and incorporate the Tariff Board. We have decided<br />
to call this new body the " Industries Assistance Commission".<br />
There are copies available of Sir John Crawford's report from<br />
Mr Walsh. We have asked the Parliamentary draftsman, the<br />
Parliamentary counsel to draft a bill to incorporate the<br />
recommendations. This doesn't mean that the Cabinet has accepted<br />
all the matters in the report. We believe, however, that it<br />
will make for speedier legislation if we get a draft as soon as<br />
we can on the items which Sir John Crawford recommends. There<br />
is an inter-departmental committee consisting of the Prime<br />
Minister's Department, Treasury, Department of Secondary Industry,<br />
Department of Primary Industry and Department Customs and<br />
Excise which will be consulted by the Parliamentary draftsman<br />
to draw up alternative provisions in the Bill. When, therefore,<br />
Cabinet has before it the Bill and the various alternative<br />
provisions, we can make decisions on those aspects. Nevertheless,<br />
we did not want to delay public knowledge and discussion of the<br />
report and the drafting of the basic legislation based upon it.<br />
We also decided to make further advances to the States<br />
under the Non-metropolitan Unemployment Relief Scheme to the<br />
extent of $ 5 million for next month, $ 4 million for August and<br />
$ 3 million for September. The grants are to be allocated among<br />
the States on the existing proportionate basis. The matter can<br />
be considered again before September.<br />
Dr Cairns will be giving you a press statement on<br />
multi-lateral trade negotiations to be held under GATT in Tokyo<br />
on 12, 13 and 14th September. He will also give you a statement<br />
on the additional items he will be giving this statement at<br />
noon next Friday, because it has to coincide with a similar<br />
statement from New Zealand about additional items to Schedule " A"<br />
of the New Zealand/ Australia Free Trade Agreement. He will give<br />
you today, a statement on the Australian trade display in Peking<br />
in the latter part of next year, probably July. </p>
<p>The Minister for the Environment and Conservation,<br />
Dr Cass, will give you a statement on our decision to endorse<br />
the International Convention on trade in endangered species.<br />
Senator Wriedt, the minister for Primary Industry,<br />
will give you details of the Wheat Industry Stabilisation<br />
Scheme for the coming year.<br />
The Acting Minister for Defence, Senator Bishop,<br />
will give you a statement on the development of the Nomad<br />
aircraft, and probably a statement on the G. M. H. dispute.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Q. Prime Minister: Are you concerned at the apparent delay<br />
in getting the Prices Justification Tribunal operating. When<br />
will the Government be appointing the other members of the<br />
tribunal and when, in fact, do you expect it to be operating?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We expect the Tribunal to come into operation<br />
on 1 August. We expect to make the appointment of the Deputy<br />
Chairman and the other members after Cabinet next week. I was<br />
discussing this matter with the Chairman, Mr Justice Williams,<br />
in Melbourne last Thursday. We all want to have the tribunal<br />
operating as early as possible. It will not be possible to<br />
get the staff together and to have the tribunal operating<br />
effectively before August.<br />
Q. In your remarks before Question Time, you mentioned the<br />
G. M. H. dispute, did you mean the Ford dispute.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I did.<br />
Q. Was the question of G. M. H. planning to close down its<br />
Adelaide assembly line discussed at Cabinet.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Was the future of the Australian motor industry discussed<br />
at Cabinet.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was quite a discussion on this, yes.<br />
Q. No resolution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There will be discussions with the industry<br />
over the next six weeks.<br />
Q. Would you be able to state those more explicity?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. No.<br />
Q. Will they be with the Japanese companies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, primarily, but with other companies as<br />
necessary. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Q. I understand you saw the French Ambassador this morning.<br />
Did you discuss when the tests will begin, or get any indication<br />
when the tests will begin. Also, will you recall Australia's<br />
Ambassador in Paris when the tests begin?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wasn't able to get any information whether<br />
or if so when there will be any nuclear tests by the French<br />
at Mururoa. However, as you quite well know, there is no<br />
statements made after calls or discussions of this nature.<br />
Q. What about Mr Renouf?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not going to speculate on these matters.<br />
I hope, as I said last Friday night, that the French will abide<br />
by the interim order of the International Court of Justice.<br />
I will not speculate in any other sense.<br />
Q. G. M. H. notified the Government on the 7th that they were<br />
going to increase their prices. What action did the Government<br />
take to try and prevent this increase coming into effect. If<br />
no action was taken, why not? What action will be taken now,<br />
and if no action is planned, why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Tribunal will deal with this matter I<br />
would expect.<br />
Q. Sir, Mr Snedden, 18 months ago, was carved into little<br />
pieces by you when he failed to take action over a steel<br />
price increase of which he had advance notice. How does this<br />
differ from that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a tribunal which has been set up by<br />
the Parliament and it will be authorised to deal with this rise<br />
if it goes ahead.<br />
Q. In your election campaign speech you said that a Labor<br />
Government would not hesitate to use its powers as a customer<br />
and through tariffs, subsidies and contracts to prevent<br />
unjustified price rises. If the tribunal finds that the G. M. H.<br />
rises are unjustified, will you then do as you said you would<br />
in your policy speech?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We would consider all those matters, yes.<br />
Q. Sir, can I assume from your answer to me that you made no<br />
attempt to try and persuade G. M. H. to wait until the Tribunal<br />
came into operation or<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't hear about this until yesterday, but<br />
G. M. H. knows quite well that the Parliament has enacted this<br />
legislation. I would have expected them to have waited. We<br />
have acted as quickly as is possible, and, as I have told you<br />
already, it is not possible to get the tribunal in operation<br />
before August. And I had discussions with the Chairman on<br />
this, to repeat, last Thursday in Melbourne. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q. On this question of motor car rises. I understand most<br />
of the other motor car companies have, in fact, increased their<br />
prices over the last couple of months. Will their price rises<br />
also be referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I forget the details there. I don't think there<br />
have been any rises since the Parliament passed this bill.<br />
Isn't that right?<br />
A. I'm not sure.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I don't think there have been.<br />
Q. Sir, if the Acting Treasurer was notified of the increase<br />
on the 7th don't you feel that you a-.. Id/ or the Cabinet should<br />
have been told, and have you conveyed this feeling if you<br />
haven't to the Acting Treasurer, Mr Stewart?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I accept that the Government was told this,<br />
but I would also expect that the company would have waited until<br />
the Tribunal was in operation.<br />
Q. In reply to an earlier question on G. M. H. prices, you said<br />
" 3if it goes ahead". Do you have any reason to believe that they<br />
won't go ahead with their prices?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would hope they wouldn't.<br />
Q. Do you have any reason to believe they won't?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can only go on what I have read. The Tribunal<br />
can deal with this matter.<br />
Q. Sir, isn't there a similarity between a minister failing to<br />
notify you of this and a minister failing to notify<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Another question.<br />
Q. Sir, you say the Tribunal can deal with this. How?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It can have a hearing to determine whether<br />
the increase in prices is justified.<br />
Q. But then what does it do, if it decides the increase is not<br />
justified? You told Mr Barron that you would think about carrying<br />
out what you said in your policy speech, the question of the<br />
Government as a customer.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. In what sense is the Government a customer? Would you think<br />
about subsidies....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. All those matters which Mr Barron mentioned.<br />
And there is also an impact on the public. The public is entitled<br />
to know whether a competent tribunal regards an increase in<br />
prices as justified. It may be the prices increase is justifiable. </p>
<p>But the company, I would think, should have waited until the<br />
proper body had had the opportunity to determine that matter.<br />
Q. Was the company told that that tribunal would probably<br />
look at any rise<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
Q. Can your words today be taken<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think we will have another one.<br />
Q. Sir, why didn't the Acting Treasurer tell the Government<br />
that this price rise was going to take place?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. I would have thought that this<br />
is quite immaterial. The answer would quite clearly be, in any<br />
case, you should wait until the Tribunal has an opportunity<br />
to hear this matter and give a ruling on it.<br />
Q. You said you would have expected the company to wait until<br />
the Tribunal was set up. The company says they waited as long<br />
as was economically feasible and that they weren't told when the<br />
tribunal would be operating. That seems like a reasonable<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I didn't know until last Thursday when<br />
the tribunal would be able to operate.<br />
Q. Well, how do you expect them to wait for an indefinite<br />
period PRIME MINISTER: Well, they now know.<br />
Q. Have they since been asked officially by the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I haven't communicated with them, at<br />
any rate.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, does this apply to all other companies?<br />
Is this in fact a price freeze that you are applying for all<br />
other companies which might want to put up the price of their<br />
products? Should they all now wait until the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal is established?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would hope so, that is, the companies whose<br />
operations would be a sufficient size to bring them within the<br />
scope of the tribunal and, obviously, G. M. H. is a company of that<br />
size.<br />
Q. Other companies who now want to do it, if they do it, they<br />
will be referred to that Prices Tribunal when it is established<br />
in August?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will be within its scope to deal with it. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Q. Prime Minister, would you consider a special inquiry now<br />
because of what's happened in<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There is a tribunal to deal with this<br />
matter, as far as the Parliament is concerned, and it will be<br />
operating as early as possible.<br />
Q. May I ask you Mr Prime Minister, what do you think of<br />
the non-aligned movement specially in view with the forthcoming<br />
summit in Algiers, and does your Government intend to be<br />
present at this conference, either as an observer or as a guest.<br />
And, if I may add another short question, what are the prospects<br />
of improving the Australian/ Yugoslav relations? Do you think<br />
that some problems which in the previous years have been obstacles<br />
for better relations are now overcome?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, whether Australia is an observer or<br />
a guest at the non-aligned conference in Algiers will depend<br />
on the members of the conference. Australia can't be either an<br />
observer or a guest unless she is asked. If she is asked,<br />
then she would accept the invitation. Australia can't be a<br />
member of the conference because Australia is not a non-aligned<br />
country. Most of our neighbours, however, will be attending<br />
this conference. Now you ask about relations between Australia<br />
and Yugoslavia. I believe they are very greatly improved because<br />
the Australian Government has now made it plain that it will<br />
not alllow Australia to be any longer used as a base for operations<br />
against the Government of Yugoslavia. There is one issue which<br />
Australia and Yugoslavia are discussing and that is the issue<br />
of dual nationality. The Yugoslav Government takes the attitude<br />
which is, I think, the usual attitude taken by countries in<br />
the Roman law tradition that a person doesn't of his own volition<br />
give up the citizenship of his country; the country itself has<br />
to agree to that.<br />
There are a very great number, some tens of thousands<br />
6f people who were born in Yugoslavia and whose citizenship has<br />
not in the Government of Yugoslavia's view been ended but who<br />
have become naturalised as Australians. Now, what Australia<br />
asks is, that if any of those persons having dual nationality<br />
are visiting Yugoslavia and would be in trouble with the law,<br />
then the Australian representatives should be informed because,<br />
in our view, they are also Australian citizens. This is a legal<br />
question of some complexity and it concerns a great number of<br />
countries, it is of interest to Australia because we have had<br />
so many migrants who, as we like them to do, have become<br />
naturalised. Now, this is a matter being considered, as you<br />
know, by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Australian Parliamentboth<br />
Houses all parties are on that; this question of multiple<br />
nationality. But a very great advance has been made already,<br />
I am happy to acknowledge. We have been in the last month or<br />
so, given much more information about dual nationals who have<br />
been arrested or charged in Yugoslavia than had ever been the<br />
case before. </p>
<p>Q. Returning to this question of the G. M. H. price increase.<br />
You said that you have accepted that the Government was notified<br />
on June 7 that the increase was proposed. You said you know<br />
of no request from the Government to G. M. H. to hold back on an<br />
increase in price. You said that, yourself, you didn't know<br />
until last Thursday when the Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
would be operating and yet you have said that you would rather<br />
hope that G. M. H. would hold back on the increase until the<br />
tribunal was operating. In view of those dates being as they<br />
are, and in view of the fact that G. M. H. has stated, and has not<br />
been contradicted, that it has held back already on a price<br />
increase, do you think it reasonable to expect G. M. H. to<br />
have further held back on the increase in prices?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I do.<br />
Q. Sir, now that G. M. H. knows the date of the tribunal, do<br />
you expect them now to withdraw the amounts of their price rises?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope they will.<br />
Q. Will the Government officially ask them to do so, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Any citizen knows the law.<br />
Q. Will they be contravening the law if they go ahead with<br />
the price rise before the matter is considered by the Tribunal.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. A tribunal will be available<br />
from the beginning of August to deal with such matters and if they<br />
put in an application now it would obviously be one of the<br />
first to be heard.<br />
Q. Sir, has the law come into operation already despite the<br />
non-existence of the tribunal itself?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The act has been assented to but it comes<br />
into operation on a date to be proclaimed, and that date will be<br />
the 1st of August or the first week day in August.<br />
Q. But surely that means that any price rises before the<br />
1st of August are not subject to the tribunal?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We can look at the Act. I thought that it was<br />
possible to look at these matters retrospectively.<br />
Q. Behind a lot of the pressure on prices is the high state<br />
of economic activity which seems to be approaching boom levels.<br />
Is the Government intending soon to apply some sort of correction<br />
to this rather head-strong momentum in the economy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, obviously we will be wanting to restrain<br />
expenditures which are in the Government's jurisdiction.<br />
Conspicuously, of course, this will be the case in those matters<br />
which are covered by Dr Coombs' Task Force.<br />
Q. And, in the private sector, Sir? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are very great limitations on what<br />
the Australian Government can do in this field aren't there?<br />
Q. Can I ask you whether the Government is still in favour<br />
of the 10 year moratorium on whaling.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. Is our delegation fully informed of this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. Was there any discussion in Cabinet about it this morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There is a conference at which the<br />
Australian delegation will be voting in favour of a ten-year<br />
moratorium. Q. Do you agree with the Victorian Housing Minister, Mr Dickie<br />
that latest Commonwealth Housing Agreement is unenforceable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I certainly don't. I expect that any<br />
Government which signs an agreement will stick to the terms of<br />
it.<br />
Q. Well, what action will the Australian Government take<br />
against Mr Dickie's statement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I do not assume that the Victorian Government<br />
will not abide by any agreement to which it becomes a party.<br />
I'm certain that Mr Hamer would not sponsor or tolerate any such<br />
action.<br />
Q. Could you tell us how preparations are going to put into<br />
effect the Government's promise to make interest on housing<br />
loans tax deductible.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I can't mention9 I said right at the<br />
outset there will be no statement and no answers on any matters<br />
which might be in the Budget.<br />
Q. But you are committed to have that in the Budget aren't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I can only repeat what I have just said to you.<br />
I will not answer questions on matters which could be in the Budget.<br />
Now, you all know that I must take that attitude.<br />
Q. Sir, well this is a non-Budget one. Have you heard from<br />
Sir John Crawford? If so, could you give us any outline at all<br />
on his recommendations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, that was the first thing that I gave<br />
this afternoon.<br />
Q. I was wondering if the Australian Government had decided<br />
who is going to be the next Chairman of the A. B. C.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Q. Could you tell me his name please?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. You will know the new boss once there<br />
has been an Executive Council meeting. There were several<br />
recommendations which the Government made yesterday for the<br />
consideration of the next Executive Council, and this was one<br />
of them. I think you will be very pleased with the man we<br />
have given you.<br />
Q. When will the Executive Council be meeting, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not sure, I don't often attend it as you<br />
know. Q. Prime Minister, last Friday two of your ministers raised<br />
the question of a capital gains tax. Mr Hayden said in Queensland<br />
he thought it was a matter which would be considered in the<br />
context of this year's Budget, Mr Crean thought it would not be<br />
considered for two years. Will it be considered in the context<br />
of this year's Budget.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would love to oblige you, but I just have to<br />
be consistent even with my favourites.<br />
Q. Are your ministers not bound by the same situation, because<br />
the public are quite confused by this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They are now. I mean, you may find it more easy<br />
to seduce them with questions like this than you will me, but you<br />
won't seduce me with it.-<br />
Q. You have suggested to them that they should not discuss the<br />
contents of this year's Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've said that they should resist your enticement.<br />
Q. They both made these in public speeches, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I have just one abbortive question. I don't<br />
think this has been discussed.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Don't bring this up.<br />
Q. Do you think that Ministers should speculate in Canberra land?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But, however, I don't know what you are<br />
referring to.<br />
Q. In view of your comments a month ago that these press<br />
conferences were a protection against a Watergate type thing<br />
in Australia, I feel justified in trying to seduce you further<br />
on the issue I raised earlier. This G. M. H. thing is the second<br />
occasion on which important advance information has not been<br />
passed on to you or the Government. Do you plan any action<br />
to try and make sure that a third such incident doesn't occur? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: You all seem particularly interested in this.<br />
G. M. H. knows what the law is as much as anyone else in Australia,<br />
and when Parliament has passed an Act then, I would think, that<br />
companies as large and as prosperous as G. M. H. ought to give<br />
a good example.<br />
Q. Unclear.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to persue this any further. It<br />
is completely immaterial. General Motors knows what the law<br />
is, Q. Well they have acted in accordance with the law, haven't<br />
they Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't think so. They could wait until<br />
the Tribunal can hear their case, and if it is a good case,<br />
then they ought to be sure that it will succeed. But, at any<br />
rate, as soon as they put in an application, the sooner it can<br />
be determined. </p>
