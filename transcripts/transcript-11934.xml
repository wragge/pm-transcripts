<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr John Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very characteristic Kerri-Anne</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Oh yeah</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I just say I hope it all goes well. You talked about energy and being positive and enthusiasm and you've brought all of those qualities to both television and radio over quite a number of years and I wish you well. I do think it's important on radio if I can sort of sound like a media commentator for a moment, they comment on me a lot so I'll just be a media commentator for a moment, you do need a variety and I think your particular background and skills will provide a different picture and a different pace and I think that's terrific and I wish you well.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well thank you, don't stop now, I'm not stopping you, well zip-ee-di-do-dar it's a wonderful day already. Did you like my opening song.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very good and you'll get to like it a bit more.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Listen and again I really sincerely thank you for making this your first radio interview for the year. You're just back from holiday, how were the holidays?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very good, I stayed in Sydney and I read a lot of books, I played a lot of golf, I watched a lot of cricket and it was a great holiday. I just stayed at home. I'd been travelling around over the last few or so months that the thought of spending three weeks or more at home and doing all of those things and particularly trying to improve my golf swing and reading a whole variety of books and of course going to every day of the Sydney Test against the West Indies, it was a great holiday and I'm glad I had it and I feel energetic and refreshed and enthusiastic and ready for a very active and I hope pretty productive year for the county.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well about those books you mentioned, I heard you with Piers Ackermann before you went away and I tell you the list of books in your holiday reading was heavy duty. Did you really, come on maybe this close to reading a trashy novel.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no, I do try during my holiday period to read a lot of heavy books and they were pretty heavy. I've just about finished Henry Kissenger's sort of tour de force on world diplomacy over the last 300 or 400 years and I read a couple of books on federation, one on Edmund Barton, the biography of the first Prime Minister of Australia, a book on the great battles between Halifax and Churchill in the British War Cabinet in May of 1940 - terrific read, quite gripping - and really although it's on a serious subject, it's not a big book and it's written in a very gripping style and it's based on some new material that's only just come out. Anyway it was a heavy diet but then I suppose they're the sort of books leaders settle down with. But I do read fiction from time to time but I tend to be somebody who likes reading biographies and history. I find biographies of people endlessly fascinating..</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of your own..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are so good and I've read some fabulous biographies in my time. Biographies of people like Weary Dunlop and Patrick White, just very very well written.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>On the international scene the biggest news out of America at the moment of course, the inauguration of President Bush. How is that going to affect us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think beneficially. I know the senior members of the Administration very well. The Bush Administration will be more open to us in relation to trade matters although I don't imagine we're going to get an easy deal and it may still be extremely difficult and perhaps in the end disappointing.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>They're just not fair are they.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No they're not, they are a big country and they push people around, as the Europeans do. The Europeans are worse when it comes to agriculture, the Europeans are much worse than the Americans. They're both pretty bad and they both subsidise.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But do we have no big stick.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No we're not big enough, so all we can do is be better and use the rules as best we can. As we did with lamb. Clinton put that quite unfair impost on lamb. And we complained and we did two things - we kept exporting even through the new barrier and we took them to the rules tribunal, the World Trade Organisation and that organisation found in our favour. Now the Americans will shout and scream a bit about it but in the end they will have to come to heel otherwise we can impose some kind of retaliatory tariffs on some of their exports. So, there is a modicum of justice out there.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Are you going over to America?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hope so. It's a question of arranging a mutually convenient time.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Did you notice, when I saw the Inauguration Ball, that President Bush actually had the black tie and Texan boots on . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I saw that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And those boots with the Presidential Seal. Now if you're going over, I've got something for you. You know I always like to have a little gift for you and . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You do yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Now we didn't want our Prime Minister to feel embarrassed with his Presidential Texan boots with the seal, so what we've done is get you a pair of RM Williams with the Commonwealth Seal. Do you have a prime ministerial seal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. I just, I use the Australian seal. They are, they are . . .</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Can I just put one on and see if they fit. Oh it's all right. Oh you've got some new shoes. That tie is lovely. Do they fit? I think they're a 71/2.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sure they will.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Oh go on have a go Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no I am sure they fit.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Because we can take them back. Do you like our . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are very nice.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Our seal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I like your seal and that is, I will not feel underdressed when I go there . . .</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And they're special Olympic ones if you notice at the bottom. There's a little Olympic plaque at the bottom of one of those. So RM Williams thank you very much and we've got the Coat of Arms with of course KAK at 873 and just promise me you're going to wear them over there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will. I will wear these.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You wouldn't be ripping off that little thing at the front or anything would you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well no, no but I mean the passage of time sometimes you know erodes the gum.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Could be. Well we just wanted you to keep up with the President that's all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>In fact given the fact that Mr Bush is in there following in the footsteps of his father. Do you think you're going to see one of your children as prime minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I think you'd have to ask them that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Come on, they haven't said, "Dad . . . ?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No they haven't. One of the things I've always tried to do with my children particularly now that they're adult is that I never presume to speak on their behalf. We have a very close association I am very happy to say. We are a close family.   One of the ways in which I think we've achieved that is that I don't use them as some kind of stage prop.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I just thought maybe you know . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think one or two of them have quite an interest in politics, they all have an interest, but one or two perhaps more intensely. But I just have no idea as to whether later on in life.. they don't really want to get heavily involved now I can say that. But as for later on I just don't know.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You do have a wonderful family. A very warm, close family. And your lovely wife - who's the sentimental one? Who's the . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am quite sentimental. I remember sort of occasions and what people were wearing.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>For instance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can remember the sort of dress my wife was wearing when I met her thirty years ago.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You're not serious.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I am serious. Of course I am serious.   Why wouldn't I?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You remember what your wife was wearing when you first met?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What was she wearing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She was wearing a very attractive short white dress.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Isn't that nice?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I remember it very vividly.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And your first conversation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our first conversation was about, we actually met at a post by-election party . . .</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Gee whoopdeedo there..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was actually quite a good day, well it was a bit of a wake, our candidate lost. But we never expected to win. But . . .</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>When you saw your wife for the first time, what went through your mind?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I thought she was a very attractive woman and I got talking to her and I was, you know, I was really buzzed about having met her.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You remember all the anniversaries and the birthdays?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I remember anniversaries and birthdays. But I am sentimental in a different sort of way. But we're a reasonably sentimental family, Janette's sentimental, we're all a bit sentimental. And it's the most important thing in the world to me that the family is close, it's just terrific. And really you can do it no matter what you do in your life. You can always find time to be a family no matter how busy you are, you really can. It's a bit of a myth you know when people say they don't have enough time. You really have to make time and you can do that no matter how busy you are.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Indeed. Well that's tremendous words to hear. We're going to take a break and Mr Howard I know has very generously said he will stay here for a little while longer today.</p>
<p>[commercial break]</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Joining me kindly this afternoon the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. Mr Howard we're just talking of your Christmas Party.   I met your cat, Honeycomb.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Honeycomb's got quite an attitude, hasn't he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Some people say he has attitude problem. But yes he's been with us for fifteen years and quite a, quite a part of the family.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Quite a discerning cat.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very discerning cat. He looks you over and some people he's none too impressed with. I hope he was nice to you.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>He was very nice.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But a couple of people he did sidle passed and then put his claws...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Let me know afterwards, off air.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Off air. Sorry, yes of course. I should mention this subtly. But actually, well I love cats, I love dogs. But so, you always had dogs when you were young?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When I was a boy I had three older brothers and no sisters and we sort of had an Irish setter called Ceasar who was an absolute institution of the suburb where I went to school and whatever and he would follow me to school and follow us across the road to church and sit in the back and he was a great institution so I grew very fond. But we've only ever had in our own family had a cat. It's great.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well I've got to say . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Honeycomb is an institution. He's even on the prime ministerial website.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes he is. Yes he's there. You can look him up as well as the policy speeches.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And the policy speeches as well.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes you can have Honeycomb and the policy speeches in a package.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well with the attitude that Honeycomb's got I reckon he'd probably have some very good thoughts about politics.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You think he'd be a valuable minder do you?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And you know what they say about cats, they're very intuitive.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Now a little later in today's programme, our first programme Mr Howard, we have one Steve Waugh. Now when Steve our captain is coming on, have you got any questions you want me to pass along? They're doing all right aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They're doing all right. I don't think anybody could be other than tremendously admiring of what Steve's achieving and what the whole team has achieved.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I am going to show this to Steve as well and I am passing it over, it is a cricket bat that my husband gave me that he personally had signed in 1953 in England and it's got the entire . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's got the entire..that is a fantastic bat.   </p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>For a cricket lover like obviously him and myself that is great. It's got the 1953 team that was lead by Lindsay Hassett and Alan Davidson.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And managed by Don Bradman. Don Bradman's signature is on the other side but it's fading a little bit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a great old, that's a great . . .</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I thought you might like it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a great piece of English willow there.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Remember the last time you were on Midday up on the tele you actually taught me how to bowl because there was a bit of a bowling scandal that was on and you taught me how to bowl.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But this time I thought maybe you'd give me a few tips with batting.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the fellow you've got in an hour's time can do far better with that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Where is my tennis ball? Oh here it is. I'll be having . . . folks I know this is radio but there's the, I am sitting back here so we will just have to speak very loudly because it is radio. Now okay, what I . . . I hold it like this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No you've got to sort of put it a bit more like that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Now I am turning my bat around ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen the prime minister has, oh that's a good action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. It's more like that yes but I repeat you've got an expert coming in shortly and he will be able to tell you all about that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well I am going to ask him if I've got the right action and then I will tell you whether you were right or wrong. Now here we go, I've got my action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I hit it ladies and gentlemen. Even I could.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You got two past cover point.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well I will be asking, what about, hey how good is this team?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to make definitive comparisons but if you look at its record there hasn't been any better. If I were asked to choose an Australian cricket team since the war you'd have to include a number of players out of this team but you'd include others as well.   There's no doubt that the depth of their batting is extraordinary and the fact that they can rest people in one day games and still do very well.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What about the leadership qualities? You're a leader of our country, of the party. Steve Waugh is a leader, clearly a very successful team. Can you run any parallels there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think in any leadership position there are some common characteristics.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Which are?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well persistence, absolute dedication and commitment. I mean Steve Waugh is a very focused person. He eats and breathes it. He has great knowledge of the history of the game and great respect for its traditions and culture as did Mark Taylor and Alan Border the other two Australian captains I've known very well in that position. And all of them, and they're the three I've experienced most, all of them had those qualities, that sort of persistence and capacity to fight back, all of those because no leader has it all his or her own way all of the time. If you look at the life experiences and one of the things I find about biographies of people is that everybody has ups and downs. I mean you were talking about your own ups and downs in the media. That's a common experience of anybody who makes it.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But isn't it the art of recovery?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The art of recovery is very very important and Steve Waugh has had a difficult period. There was a period when people were you know, were very critical of him. But he's had a fantastic year with the bat, absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well talking about leadership, Mr Beazley - the Leader of the Opposition - made his first speech for the year. And talking about recovery do you think he and his team will be able to recover this year? It is an election year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a matter for the Australian people. I think that the election will be hard for us because we're going for a third term and that's always difficult and I don't take it for granted. I think it's going to be very tough, but that's up to the Australian people.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>He talked this morning about the priorities for them - health, education, living standards and improved skills.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I mean they're motherhood statements. But they really are if I may say so a policy lazy Opposition because we didn't get anything, we didn't get any ideas. I mean I believe in utopia and everything as well as the next person. But in the end if you're in the business of politics you've got to actually say how you're going to do it. I mean he says he wants to improve living standards - how? He wants to have better health - how? Better education - how? Better things for the regions - how? I mean he's had five years and you haven't seen any details of how it's going to be done. They are a very policy lazy Opposition and policy lazy Oppositions produce videos and pamphlets at the beginning of the year. Policy serious Oppositions produce actual policies.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>So do you have any pamphlets?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've got policies and we've been implementing policies for the last five years. We have a few pamphlets to go along with the policies as well.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What about this year ?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well next Monday I will be announcing the biggest ever policy statement by any government in relation to science and education. I mean it will be a very comprehensive statement that will deal with research, scientific endeavour, innovation, greater educational opportunities for people. All of these things will be part of a quite detailed, properly costed comprehensive package that will have a program for implementation.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Gee the GST has been a bonanza hasn't it for the government in terms of..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know it's been a bonanza in..what you mean in a political sense or..?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>No, in terms of finance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know yet. Well I really don't know Kerri. The indications are that it's on track but we took a huge risk introducing it because it's always tough but we believed it was right and the Labor Party hoped it would fall over in a heap and us with it. Now that sort of hasn't happened and I think the Australian people have adapted to the new system and I thank them, and I particularly thank the small business community because there is additional work for them. I understand that but..</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Will that get easier for them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it will because people get more used to it.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Have you tried to fill out one of those Business Activity Statements?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I've gone through it. I mean it's impossible to sort of simulate filling out something like that unless you've actually got a small business. But I've talked to a lot of people. The anecdotal evidence, I was talking to a small businessman in a very micro business the other day and he was very sort of up beat about it. He said it's a piece of cake. All you've got to do is follow the instructions and he could use the accounts method and he said it's very simple. Now others are not so complimentary. The Tax Office has got 2,000 people out in the field listening to concerns and they're willing to go at no cost.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>The Taxation Department's listening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are on this. I'll tell you what..</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I can just hear the roars of laughter.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well I understand that. Well you know, okay, people in small business who've got concerns if they want somebody from the Tax Office to come and talk to them at no cost, visit them at their business premises they just ring the number in the paper and they'll come.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What do you think are your priorities, what are you priorities for this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my priorities are to build an Australian community where people are given equality of opportunity, where there is affordable access to health care and education services and all of those things for all of the Australian community. But I also want a society that is self-reliant and I want a society that is prepared to have a go at achieving things and changing things for the better. I don't just believe in a society where the role of the government is to sort of underpin everybody. I think the role of the government is to look after people who can't look after themselves.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Is it difficult making all these decisions and trying to pursue these priorities when it is an election year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No because we've, in the last election we took the tax plan to the people. It was the biggest single change to our tax system ever and we made that the centrepiece of our campaign. One thing I promise the people that I'm going to do this year, I'm going to keep doing things. You get elected and you've only got one go at being Prime Minister and you've got to use every minute of every waking hour of every day trying to do positive things for the betterment of the country. It's no good sitting there and just thinking isn't it great being in government, being Prime Minister. That's no good for anybody. And what I want to do is to take advantage of the years that I have in the job to improve things where they need changing and improving, but equally hanging on to those things that are worth preserving because not everything that we've done in the past is wrong. I mean we've got a lot of things right. This country's got more things right than most and we ought to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>With an election year, and I'm sure maybe you don't even know when the election is going to be. It's a bit early.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it has to be by not later than the end of the year but exactly when it is it's hard to say.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>The leadership question will be raised, I won't be the first. Is it difficult running an election knowing somebody else wants your job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I mean that's how our system works. I mean when I was Opposition Leader I wanted Mr Keating's job and when..</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Yeah but you're on different sides.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Who do you think is the pretender to your throne?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a matter for the party. See we're not like the Labor Party. There's no secret Kirribilli pact. We didn't have a huddle on the lawn of Kirribilli and say this is going to happen like the Labor Party did, and kept it concealed. I mean they went to an election in 1990 having made a deal between the leader and the deputy leader of the party.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But we all know there are various factions in the party so...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's nothing wrong with people having ambition. I had ambition before I became leader. I openly confess it. Ambition is part of the competitiveness of life. But in the end the party decides who the leader is and I would never presume to say this or that person should be the leader of the party at some time in the distant future when I go.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>With Peter Costello, people may assume he would want your job. Does it make a working relationship...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have a very close working relationship. Very close. We had a very lengthy conversation during the holidays about the year ahead and different economic issues.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>See you weren't on holiday the whole time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you never are.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Do you get those [inaudible] phone calls saying there's a little war happening over here we thought we'd mention, or...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're never completely on holiday. Anybody who says you are in my position is kidding the public.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>This being an election year I'm sure you have the family, as I know what a strong family man you have, you'll have the family in mind. We're going to introduce on our program for the rest of the year a little segment called 'Bringing up Baby', and we have a wonderful..would you mind if I actually [inaudible]..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No please do.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>She's going to be shocked because I haven't really caught up with it this morning.   Margaret could you come in. Ladies and gentlemen I want to introduce you to Margaret and she doesn't know she's going to meet you Mr Prime Minister. This is Margaret Norman. Now Margaret ladies and gentlemen, we will follow Margaret and her baby, she's due today, right through the year with all, you know, the obvious associates with having a family, her first, you're 24 Margaret?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Now I mean what can you offer a young family like Margaret and her husband Danny this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hope we can offer you job security, I hope we can offer you a peaceful society for your child to be born into. I hope we can offer you good health services and I hope that as your child grows up he or she gets a good education and also grows up in a society that gives him or her plenty of opportunity. But the most important thing, you know, is that, having a family is the best thing that could happen to anybody. I think it's fantastic. We were very excited when we had our first child and you must also be very excited.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>How are you feeling Margaret? [inaudible] phone.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Yeah, it's been pretty good actually.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>First baby's normally a little late.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>That's what they say.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What was this morning like?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>No problems, just getting ready for today.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>So you didn't wake up thinking today is really going to be the day?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Actually I felt like it was through the night and I thought I'll definitely have it tomorrow. It's been really heavy this morning and I could barely walk but now I'm feeling okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do you think it might be another couple of days?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Possibly, possibly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you'll keep us informed.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I will, I will.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're going to follow, that's terrific, through the year?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Yes. The birth and everything associated with having babies. You know the good side, sometimes there are some tough times and we'd like to get experts in associated with childhood. You know, everything from clothing to, you know, behavioural problems and all the joys of. When you had your first child do you remember that vividly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very vividly. I was there.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You were at the birth. Tell me, that was quite avant-garde.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was. I was present at the birth of my children, our three children rather. Yeah it was. It probably was.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Were you more scared than your wife?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a fascinating experience and I'm very glad I went. I really am. And I was present at the birth of our two sons as well. It's a great experience and it wasn't as common then as it's become now. Melanie...</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Did people think you were strange because..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No not strange. I think.I remember sort of tiptoeing around the subject a little bit with my mum who was perhaps a bit more traditional in relation to those things. I mean a great wonderful family woman and great mother but you could sort of tip toe around those things a bit with people who sort of didn't think it was the done thing. But it's a generational thing. I mean men were exiled from labour wards.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What about your family Margaret, will your husband be present?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>He's excited actually.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>What does daddy do?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>He's in form working, building.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Building. And where do you live now?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>We live in Hurstville. We bought an apartment there.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You haven't had to fill in a Business Activity Statement?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>No I gave it to the accountant.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Did you just. Did look at it, how did you find it?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>It wasn't too bad but I thought I'd just leave it to him to make sure it got [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You've got something else, sort of on your hands at the moment.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Danny's actually, he works for himself.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Yeah, so we have to do that.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Have you got any ideas for the Prime Minister? Well he has got his policies very well formulated this year but he's always looking for input?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Make it simpler.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Just make it simpler, that's all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And is your husband busy?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>Yeah he's working now. I don't if he's going to be listening to this. But he's working.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Is there lots of work out there?</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>It's a bit slow at the moment but we're hoping it picks up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I think anything at all to do with construction there was a bit of a pull forward of things before the GST and then a slow down. But some of the latest signs are that it's coming back again and we hope that's the case.</p>
<p>MARGARET:</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well I'm so glad Margaret I could introduce you to the Prime Minister. And Mr Howard just as we wrap it up today again I really appreciate your time today. You've been more than generous. And I know one of your favourite songs, well you like Bob Dylan, he's coming on the 25th of March. Are you going to go and see him by the way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll see what other things I've got on. I did read he was coming.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I know he's one of your faves, but also Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler. Which is your favourite song from Dire Straits.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh probably 'Walk of Life'.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>How appropriate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We've been talking about all of that haven't we.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well as we take a break on Midday with Kerri-Anne on 873, Margaret will be back for a chat in a little while. But Mr Prime Minister, again thank you very much. All the very best for the year and say hi to the family. You've been a real joy and thank you for taking the time.</p>
