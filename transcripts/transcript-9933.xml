iities for STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
issue for<br />
to HOWARD TO CUT 22,000 GREEN JOBS<br />
it of<br />
lisitions, John Howard proposed today to set up a new program to enable young people to<br />
work on environmental projects. He claims the program would provide placements<br />
support it for up to 2,000 people.<br />
. iberUnfortunately for Mr Howard, this proposal mimics a far more comprehensive set of<br />
! me initiatives already in place through Working Nation namely:<br />
9,000 Landcare and Environment Action Plan ( LEAP) places<br />
onatio 5,000 Jobskills places<br />
of policy. 10,000 Regional Environment Employment ( REEP) and New Work<br />
Opportunities places.<br />
. nt wil These programs are funded through the $ 9 billion, four-year Workng Nation<br />
initiative an initiative that the Coalition is committed to cuttina.<br />
Since the Coalition is cutting Working Nation, in which there are 24,000 environment<br />
~ Arroll jobs, the net effect of Mr Howard's plan would -appear to be a decrease in green<br />
4988 employment of 22,000.<br />
Mr Howard has been reported as saying that the source of the money for this<br />
proposal will be announced later in the campaign. This can only mean through cuts<br />
to LEAP and other successful Government job programs either that, or he plans to<br />
return to the Telstra magic pudding.<br />
Through LEAP a community-based program the Commonwealth vill be spending<br />
$ 106 million in 1995-96 to help young unemployed people to gain practical<br />
experience in Landcare, environment conservation and cultural heritage.<br />
Importantly, LEAP is open to young unemployed people aged 15 to 20 years. Mr<br />
Howard's proposal ignores 15 to 16 year olds. Early school leavers in this age<br />
group are among the most disadvantaged in our community.<br />
In addition, by restricting his proposal to 17 to 20 year olds, he is making a mockery<br />
of his promise to remove " rigid age requirements" from labour market programs. </p>

On Monday this week the Prime Minister announced a new Green Volunteers<br />
initiative as part of Young Australia. This initiative will enable at least 2 000 young<br />
-ust ali-pe. year to Participate in environmental projects on a voluntary basis.<br />
They can do so on a full-time basis on projects up to a month's duration or part time<br />
on projects that require 1 to 3 days work per week over four weeks. MPS 8/ 96<br />
In Young Australia we also announced:<br />
making LEAP available to small employers and farm families by allowing single Australian<br />
LEAP placements ( in addition to the existing project-based placements) involved v<br />

In truth, after a lifetime of never going near it, Mr Howard is not at home with the maternity<br />
environment. And it shows. His new plan is a miniature version of government ( Matemit4<br />
