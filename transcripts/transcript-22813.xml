    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Fijian Prime Minister</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister what is your reaction to the proposal for the Great Council of Chiefs was put forward to try to resolve the crisis in Fiji?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have heard my reaction is one of intense disappointment indeed dismay.  It would appear that a democratically elected Prime Minister has been removed by the barrel of a gun.  No amount of explanation or no amount of sophistry can all of that fundamental fact.  He was chosen by the people of Fiji in a democratic election, under a constitution that afforded ….. treatment to all races and was not racially based.  It would appear that the inevitable outcome of an illegal criminal act is that this democratically chosen Prime Minister is to disappear from office and that is a profoundly upsetting and disturbing outcome and if that turns out to be the case, which appears overwhelming likely then Fiji will incur the appropriate condemnation of many democratic countries and democratic leaders around the world.  Australia had a close association with Fiji. I am intensely disappointed and upset and I know that I speak for Australians on both sides of politics here in saying how much we deplore the apparent disappearance of democracy in Fiji and the re-immergence of a constitutional approach based on race and not on equality of citizenship.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:  </p>
<p>Will Australia be effecting Fiji’s expulsion from the commonwealth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well its not appropriate tonight that I start spelling out what responses will be.  I will talk to my colleagues.  The important thing is to register in unambiguous terms the concern that I have the Government as about this turn of events.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:  </p>
<p>.. The Prime Minister has said there will be an international back lash.  Have you spoken to him yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I would no reason to talk to .. about it.  Its probably spoken…</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will there be any sanctions or any other actions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as I …  a moment ago, I am not going to announce any responses tonight.  There’s things that you consider in the light of day.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:  </p>
<p>… that Fiji appears to be going backwards in terms of race relations.  </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am concerned about any departure from a constitution that affords people equality of rights irrespective of their race.  I mean its one of those fundamental things that we all hold dear and when it is qualified or diminished or removed anywhere, we’re disturbed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This debate still hasn’t accepted the Council of Chief’s proposal.  If you think there’s any chance it could be turned around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that’s something, well I don’t know that Mr Speight would be unhappy with the outcome.  He seems to have got everything he wanted.  But that is something that has to be resolved in Fiji.  But whatever one says about that card alters the fact that it would appear that there has been a capitulation to rebellion.  A capitulation to hostage taking, a capitulation to the use of armed force to alter a democratic outcome and that is always to be profoundly regretting and profoundly condemned.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Australia expect that outcome in any way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I would be concerned about the matter over the past few days, yes.  Thank you.</p>
