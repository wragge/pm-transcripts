,4&gt; AUSTRJ1<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 24 SEPTEMBER 1981<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH IN THE HOUSE ON THE BUDGET<br />
. Central to every Budget brought down by this Government, to<br />
every action with significant economic implications, has been<br />
our recognition of the critical role of economic policy in<br />
creating a favourable environment, for individual initiative<br />
and a Ã¸ growing private sector, for effective humanitarian concern<br />
and greater assistance for the needy, for balanced economic<br />
development throughout Australia and sustained confidence in<br />
our future. This Budget highlights the gulf between the Australian<br />
economy as it was in 1975 and the Australian economy as it is today,<br />
with out international reputation restored, with well-founded<br />
projections for growth, higher employment and better wages, arid<br />
with the enhanced potential for personal income tax reductions<br />
which even the Opposition has not failed to perceive within this<br />
Budget. When this Government came to office in -1975 inflation was high,<br />
it was above world levels, and it was uncontrolled, unemployment<br />
was growing and orivate sector employment actually shrinking<br />
and confidence was shot to pieces. How different is the<br />
picture today, with inflation below world levels, with nearly<br />
300,000 new private sector jobs created in the two years to<br />
May, and with very great confidence indeed in this country,<br />
as evidenced particularly by the widespread investment in the<br />
manufacturing and mining industries that is now taking place.<br />
All of this comes from the steady application of responsible<br />
economic pDolicies by this Government and it comes particularly,<br />
as it will continue to come, from the successive Budgets of<br />
this Government.<br />
I want first to say something about this particular Budget's<br />
strategy in the context of the Government's overall economic<br />
objectives, and I shall put it to the House that the virtual<br />
elimination of the deficit in this Budget will be seen in<br />
years ahead as a landmark in Australia's development, that<br />
any claim that this Government is a high spending or a high<br />
taxing Government does not stand up, and that expenditure<br />
restraint must continue to be a matter of fundamental priority.<br />
Secondly, I want to explain to the House the success of the<br />
Government's commitment to combining expenditure restraint and<br />
economic responsibility, with effective care and concern for<br />
the legitimate expectations, the real needs, and the<br />
authentic aspirations of the Australian community. And I will<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
put it to the House, that our programmes are effective and progressive,<br />
that they identify priorities and balance the total range of<br />
human concerns, and that any suggestion that the Government does.<br />
not care, does not understand, simply flies in the face of the<br />
record.<br />
Mr Speaker, the strategy of this year's Budget is unmistakable<br />
in the virtual elimination of the deficit which has been achieved.<br />
The three and a half billion dollar Budget deficit which the<br />
Government inherited from Labor, which would have been even higher<br />
without the expenditure reductions made by this Government when<br />
it came to office, would now be almost seven and a half billion<br />
dollars if we had persisted with deficit financing at the Labor<br />
rate of almost five per cent of GDP. The Government<br />
consistently rejected deficit financing as totally inappropriate<br />
for Australia's circumstances through the 1970' s and into the<br />
1980' s, for these circumstances are quite different from those<br />
-which existed in the 19301s, as Keynes himself would unquestionably<br />
ha'ie recognised.<br />
Australia Is still paying the price for Labor's irresponsible<br />
deficits, for those deficits are still distorting Australia's<br />
capital mark et, and still contributing to excessive interest<br />
rates as the loans thnat had to be raised at the time to fund<br />
the deficit are still1 having to be rolled over and renewed.<br />
The Labor deficit was ncthing more than a way of making the<br />
future pay for the spending schemes of the past, either throuqh<br />
inflation, or throu.. gh higher taxes, or both. Deficit financing<br />
encourages expectations that are unreal and it-means<br />
dishonesty about the r-eal level of taxation.,<br />
With the virtual elimiInation of the deficit in this Budget, we<br />
can plan next year's Budget no longer hostage to this element<br />
of the Lablor Govenr~ ent's mismanagment and with the enhanced<br />
potential -For tax cuts wThich I have already referred to. The<br />
Government has got rid of ; the massive Labor deficit partly by<br />
an honest approach to taxation and partly by rigorous restraint<br />
on its spending. We have worked at the problem from both ends.<br />
Our more honest approach to taxation, which has involved lifting<br />
Commonwealth revenue by 2.4 per centage points as a proportion of<br />
GDP has gone into getting rid of the deficit. The Government's<br />
view has been that our children should not have to pay the costs<br />
of the Government programmes of today.<br />
The Opposition calls this a high tax approach which only shows<br />
again that thne opposition simply does not care about the longterm<br />
development or future of this country. The claim that this<br />
Government is a high tax Government simply does not stand up.<br />
And if we look at the sales tax increases and the Government's<br />
objectives in connection with them, objectives of deficit<br />
elimination, of reduced pressure on interest rates-, of a better<br />
balance in the tax mi-x, and of enhanced potential for personal<br />
income tax reductions; the Government's overriding concern<br />
with reducing the burden on the community of taxation and of the<br />
high costs of Government is again apparent. ./ 3 </p>
<p>4<br />
The proportion of G. D. P. which the GovernmenL spends is not<br />
only vital to the number of dollars in actual pay packets, it<br />
determines whether-there is enough room for expansion and<br />
growth in the private sector.<br />
In 1975/ 76, the Commonwealth Government spent 30.1 cents of<br />
every dollar of G. D. P. In 1981/ 82, the Commonwealth Government<br />
will be spending 2 cents less than in 1975/ 76 of every dollar<br />
produced in Australia and this reduction, which would be nearly<br />
3 cents but for the extra payday which only comes at twelve<br />
year intervals means that the Government will be spending<br />
3.7 billion dollars less than if the 1975/ 76 proportion had<br />
continued. This Government's reduction in Budget outlays as a proportion of<br />
G. D. P. stands in stark contrast to the increase under Labor<br />
from less than 24% to more than 30%. Everybody knows how much<br />
easier it is to spend more rather than less, and the steady<br />
progress which this Government has sustained in reducing its<br />
expenditure requirements has come about only as a result of the<br />
Government's resolute commitment to the cause of expenditure<br />
restraint and more limited Government.<br />
This Government will continue to maintain expenditure restraint<br />
and will continue the task of bringing down its outlays as a<br />
proporticn of G. D. P. towards the more moderate levels which<br />
prevailed before the Whitlam Government came to power.<br />
Let me t-urn from the Government's expenditure restraint to<br />
its borrc-wing restraint because in the end, borrowing is a form<br />
of expenditure. This year's Budget makes a substantial contribution,<br />
over an, above the reductions already achieved in the Loan Council,<br />
towards reducing Government borrowing requirements and a central<br />
objective of this is to ease the pressure on interest rates.<br />
The interest rates which currently prevail are produced by three<br />
main factors; inflation, the pressure of demand within Australia,<br />
and the impact of overseas factors. A prospering Australia, where<br />
business investment and business borrowing are surging ahead,<br />
cannot hope to cut itself off entirely from overseas trends in<br />
interest rates, and overseas trends have been upwards in<br />
recent years.<br />
This overseas pressure, together with the demand that is arising<br />
out of growth in the Australian economy, explains why it is<br />
imperative that all Governments should pull back their borrowing<br />
demands. Be ween 1975/ 76 and 1980/ 81, the Commonwealth Government<br />
has achieved a reduction of over $ 2 billion in its own and its<br />
authorities borrowing requirements,. and there will be a further<br />
reduction of about $ 1 billion this year. </p>
<p>While substantial public sector borroing is needed to provide<br />
infrastructure for the private sector economic developments<br />
now taking place, that borrowing must not be so high that is<br />
squeezes out these developments. For all loans are ultimately<br />
drawn from the one pool of funds, and larger borrowings by<br />
Governments reduce the availability of funds, not only for large<br />
investment projects, but also for home owners, farmers and small<br />
businesses and. tend to push up interest rates at the same time.<br />
All Governments need to be aware that the dollars which they<br />
borrow could be used for other purposes that the money which goes<br />
into a $ 10 million Government loan might have been used to provide<br />
three or four hundred housing loans.<br />
While interest rates are obviously too high at their present<br />
levels, it must also be recognised that the people who provide<br />
the funds for borrowing will need an adequate return if they are<br />
to continue to invest their capital in this way, and the fact that<br />
the present housing interest rates are little different from the<br />
average rates through the 1960s when inflation is taken into<br />
account serves again to demonstrate the insidious nature of<br />
inflation,-and the continuing need to get it down in the cause<br />
of lower interest rates.<br />
Bringing down inflation has of course been a vital target in<br />
the Government's exzenditure restraint and the continued containment<br />
of inflation obviously remains a primary economic objective of<br />
the Government.<br />
The restraint of this Government, both in terms of spending and<br />
borrowing, has been remarkable by any standards as other countries<br />
recognise and it is even more remarkable in view of the fact that<br />
the priority areas of social security, welfare and defence, which<br />
have required real increases over the period in question, encompass<br />
such a high proportion of Budget outlays more than 37% in fact<br />
this year.<br />
I have been speaking of what this Government has achieved over<br />
almost six years through its consistently applied Budget strategy.<br />
But while the Budget is the major economic vehicle through which<br />
the Government's. philosphy. and priorities are given concrete<br />
expression, many other activities of Government have a significant<br />
impact indeed in their own right on the well-being of Australians<br />
and the prospects for increasing prosperity.<br />
The Review of Commonwealth Functions provides a particular example.<br />
The results of the Review contributed significantly to restraining<br />
expenditure ih 1981/ 82, but to assess the R. C. F. exercise only<br />
in this perspective is to miss its main point. For out of that<br />
review have come decisions which will strengthen the role of the<br />
private sector, reduce Government interference in private sector.<br />
decision-making and restore to State Governments responsibility and<br />
ultimate control over areas of activity which are rightly theirs.<br />
/ 6-<br />
5 </p>
<p>The impact o-these outcomes is not to be measured merely in<br />
dollars and cents: indeed in some cases their monetary value<br />
would be virtually impossible to estimate, but they will offer<br />
huge long-term benefits in increasing the strength of<br />
Australian federalism and the vitality of the Australian economy.<br />
Another area of Commonwealth Government decision-making, which has<br />
significant implications for long term prosperity is that of<br />
tariffs and protection. This is an area of decision-making<br />
fraught with difficulties, for we all agree that the long-term<br />
benefits of a more competitive and efficient Australian economy<br />
need to be balanced against the costs to those whose employment<br />
prospects may be put at risk and the consequences for those who<br />
have made substantial investments under existing protection<br />
policies. On many occasions the Government has stated its view that Australia<br />
should move progressively towards lower levels of protection<br />
in order to promote the development of a manufacturing industry<br />
which will be more internationally competitive. In the last three<br />
years in particular, as the I. A. C. has moved through its<br />
progressive series of reviews of assistance to all sectors, we<br />
have taken many decisions which over a period of time, will phase<br />
down protection in a wide range of industries including iron<br />
and steel, rubber products, chemicals, sporting equipment and,<br />
starting in 1932, textiles, clothing and footwear.<br />
We have also recently acted to eliminate, except in the case<br />
of certain defence-strategic industries, an additional element of<br />
protection to Australian industry afforded through a margin of<br />
preference in Comconwealth Government purchasing. And now that<br />
the I. A. C. has almost completed its series of tariff reviews, we<br />
have asked the Commission to report by early 1982 on what options<br />
are available to achieve further general reductions in protection,<br />
and I want to emphasise that gradualism and the avoidance of<br />
disruption are indispensable elements in the Government's approach<br />
and policies in this area.<br />
In these and other ways, the Government has sought to promote<br />
the necessary conditions for a dynamic economy and a prosperous<br />
society. In doing so, however, we have not forgotten that change<br />
and progress even prosperity itself inevitably confront people<br />
with pressures and problems, that sound and responsible economic<br />
management must be integrated with care and concern for the needs<br />
of people.<br />
Let me turn to this wider issue, bearing in mind that a Budget<br />
does not demonstrate genuine concern about people or their<br />
well-being unless it faces up to economic reality with firmness,<br />
with conviction, with balance, and with that proper caution which<br />
does not place hard won gains at risk. It also needs to be<br />
understood that Budgetary policy is not just a matter of cutting<br />
up this year's national cake which is what the Leader of the<br />
Opposition boils it down to in the end and that while Budget<br />
allocations have an immediate and critical bearing on the well-being<br />
of a significant proportion indeed of Australians, Australians<br />
overall should obviously be looking to a healthy economy rather<br />
than few dollars and cents in the Budget for their economic well-being.<br />
/ 7<br />
0 </p>
<p>What better illustration of this could there be than the<br />
increase of $ 2.7 billion, after tax, in real household disposaYe<br />
income that was achieved last year as a result of the economic<br />
growth and activity which this Government's policies have generated.<br />
In considering this Government's policies on the great issues<br />
of human concern and the real needs of people, the starting point<br />
must be our programmes for young people because it is this<br />
Government which has concentrated on equipping those who are not<br />
academically inclined with useful work skills, and this Government<br />
which has based its policies 6n the premise that young people<br />
who are not at work ought where possible to be in education or<br />
training.<br />
The Government has sustained its original commitment to<br />
the development of a skilled workforce, with particular emphasis<br />
on youth, and prominent among our major initiatives are the<br />
C. R. A. F. T. ( Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Full-Time<br />
Training) Scheme, the S. Y. E. T. P. Scheme, and the School to Wbrk<br />
Transition Programme. Under these initiatives, a record<br />
95,000 apprentices will receive assistance in 1981/ 82 compared<br />
with only 21,000 assisted in 1975/ 76 by the old apprenticeship<br />
scheme; 90,000 young people will be able to obtain work experience<br />
including longer-term experience for 12,000 of those who have<br />
had the greatest difficulty in finding jobs; and 23,000 young<br />
people will receive training under the transition programmes<br />
in T. A. F. E. institutions alone.<br />
The Government has also introduced a variety of smaller scale<br />
schemes because the Government's initiatives cater for the<br />
real problems in this area.<br />
The programmes implemented by the Government are appreciated<br />
through--ut the community and nobody in the community would want to<br />
deny the importance of the Government's concern in relation to<br />
this matter.<br />
The total allocation in the 1981/ 82 Budget directed towards<br />
training schemes and transitional programmes is more than<br />
$ 240 million, almost 40% up on last year's allocation, and upwards<br />
of 225,000 young people will be receiving assistance. / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
Ana the fact that youth unemployment has come down by over nineteen arid<br />
a half thousand in the year to August shows the effectiveness<br />
of our policies.<br />
I turn to the Government's initiatives and support for disabled<br />
and handicapped persons, where assistance is being provided in<br />
1981/ 82 involving an overall expenditure of over $ 1.1 billion.<br />
This figure might possibly be doubled or trebled without the real<br />
needs that exist being fully met, but the real increase<br />
of 39% on the 1975/ 76 figure shows the very considerable and<br />
sympathetic commitment of this Government to the well-being of<br />
handicapped and disabled persons. The Government's view is that<br />
a wide range of programmes and forms of assistance are<br />
required to meet the needs that exist. About two hundred and<br />
eighty projects have been approved to date for the 1980/ 83<br />
triennium in the handicapped persons welfare programme.<br />
A new programme of aids for disabled people who were not covered<br />
by existing programmes was established last June and the national<br />
employment strategy for the handicapped is improving services<br />
and increasing assistance under the training programmes at a<br />
cost of $ 4 million in 1981/ 82. Three new initiatives in<br />
the Budget, which will have a significant impact on the lifestyles<br />
ofhandicapoed and disabled people, are a new permanent scheme<br />
for assistance in the production of audio books in addition to<br />
Braille books, a new scheme of support for the establishment<br />
of radio services to supply spoken word services, and the<br />
new Australian caotion centre, which will provide access to<br />
television prograr-es for people with impaired hearing. / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
The Governrment is acutely aware of the difficulty of allocating<br />
priorities in relation to the needs of disabled persons and a<br />
fundamental principle of government policy is to assist disabled<br />
persons to live normal lives wherever 1and so far as this is<br />
possible and our commitment to making real gains in meeting<br />
the needs of disabled persons in our community will be maintained.<br />
I turn to Aboriginal affairs, where health care, employment<br />
opportunities and self-management initiatives are among the<br />
most central . oncerns and objectives of government policy. In the<br />
1981/ 82 budget health grants to Aboriginal medical services, at.<br />
almost $ 5 million, have more than doubled in real terms since:<br />
1975/ 76, and are up 22% on last year's allocation; $ 50 million<br />
is to be provided over 5 years for the Aboriginal public health<br />
improvement programme, $ 8 millionof it this year; $ 47 million<br />
will be provided in 1981/ 82 for Aboriginal education and<br />
training, and a further $ 25 million has been allocated specifically<br />
for employment and related programmes for Aboriginals. Some<br />
$ 78 million will be provided through'various programmes for<br />
Aboriginal housing. Grants to Aboriginal legal services will<br />
increase by almost 20% on last year; to Aboriginal cultural<br />
and recreational organisations by 18%; and funds for social<br />
support schemes will increase by 24%.<br />
The well-being of the Aboriginal people concerns the Government<br />
as it concerns the vast majority of Australians and while a great<br />
many of the initiatives which need to be developed require a<br />
financial commit-ent, initiatives of a different order are equally<br />
required. In relation to the profoundly important objective of selfmanagement-,<br />
the Aboriginal Development Commission is an exciting<br />
initiative, which is attracting overseas interest. It was<br />
established only after detailed consultations with Aboriginal<br />
organisat. ons and communities, including with the National<br />
Aborigina. l Conference. It already has over 60% of its<br />
positions occupied by Aboriginals. In 1981/ 82 it has available<br />
over $ 50 : illion for spending on Aboriginal advancement<br />
progra-mes.<br />
This Government also promoted the establishment of the National<br />
Aboriginal Conference a body elected by Aboriginals to give<br />
independent advice to the government on matters affecting the<br />
Aboriginal people and with which successive Ministers for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs have developed strong ties.<br />
The Government continues to seek co-operative progress in meeting<br />
the special' claims and the particular needs of Aboriginals and<br />
while there is much that may be said about the treatment of<br />
the Aboriginal people in earlier times, I believe that the<br />
record of achievement over the last decade or two a record<br />
to which both sides of this House have made significant and<br />
impressive contributions provides a basis for confidence that<br />
progress will continue as a matter of urgency and of the highest<br />
priority. </p>
<p>10<br />
I turn to the Budget allocation for assistance to aged persons.<br />
This is an area which raises issues and dilemmas of profound<br />
significance for the community especially in the situation in<br />
which there is not only an increase in the aged population but<br />
also in which the legitimacy of established expectations and<br />
the policy of directing government assistance to the needy<br />
cannot be recpnciled completely in practice.<br />
Assistance for the aged is directed to three major areas of need<br />
pensions and other income support; services which enable aged<br />
persons to remain in their own homes; and assistance for people<br />
who require either sheltered accommodation or nursing care.<br />
The 1981/ 82 allocations illustrate the degree of this Government's<br />
commitment to its policy of protecting basic pensions against<br />
inflation a policy which we regard as crucial in ensuring social<br />
justice especially for those whose only source of income support<br />
is their pension and the Government has, through indexation,<br />
maintained the rea! value of pensions with the cost of the<br />
1981/ 82 increases amounting to about $ 430 million in a full year.<br />
The upper limit at which an aged couple can receive some pension<br />
payment will be $ 266 oer week after November 1981, compared with<br />
$ 163 per week when the Government came to office. The Government<br />
is continuing tc Drovide assistance for home ' care, meals-on-wheels,<br />
and senior citizens centres, at a cost of over $ 23 million in<br />
1981/ 82.<br />
Support is also being provided towards the capital costs of<br />
nursing homes, hostels and self-contained accommodation, and the<br />
personal care subsidy.<br />
In all, at $ 4.6 billion for 1981/ 82, assistance for the aged<br />
has more than doubled since this Government came to office<br />
a real increase of 20% s~ nce 1975/ 76.<br />
I turn to multicultural affairs and services to migrants where<br />
this Government's achievements are again meeting theneeds, the<br />
concerns and the aspirations of so many. members of the Australian<br />
community.<br />
The Galbally report, which was designed as a review of services to<br />
migrants has become a symbol of a transforming vision of Australian<br />
society. It recommended that $ 50 million be spent on new or<br />
expanded programmes over three years, and we have more than met<br />
our commitment to this expenditure through expanded settlementand<br />
migrant education programmes, establishment of migrant resource<br />
courses, the development of multicultural television and ethnic<br />
radio, establishment of the Institute of Multicultural Affairs,-,<br />
the funding of ethnic schools, and the on-going teaching of<br />
ethnic languages and culture. The Galbally vision is increasingly<br />
becoming a reality.<br />
I V </p>
<p>11<br />
There has obviously been major expenditure on a very large<br />
-number of programmes and services for immigrants and for ethnic<br />
communities. But the truly significant-aspect of all this is not<br />
so much the financial commitment involved but rather that<br />
multicultural Australia has been made a reality under the<br />
auspices of this Government, and to a significant extent as a<br />
result of its initiatives and encouragement.<br />
The 1981/ 82 Budget combines responsible economic management<br />
with effective care for people and their concerns and the list<br />
of initiatives and achievements which I have presented is by<br />
no means exhaustive.<br />
The same picture of effective achievement of progressive Liberal<br />
objectives would emerge in an examination of grants for local<br />
government, of grants for overseas aid, of increases in<br />
family allowances, and in attention to veterans' affairs.<br />
Any suggestion that this government has concentrated on economic<br />
management to the exclusion of broader concerns and issues is<br />
wholly groundless. Any suggestion that the Government has lost<br />
sight of its own Liberal objectives, or its commitment to the<br />
way of life which Australians want, is wholly groundless.<br />
Of course, the Government recognises the importance of a strong<br />
economy as a pre-condition for the realisation of wider social and<br />
cultural objectives. That recognition has been written large<br />
in the balance which has been maintained in our pursuit of social<br />
and hum-anicarian objectives and in the rigorous way that we have<br />
always given first place to the highest priorities. It is<br />
this concentration on priorities which has allowed the Government<br />
to make significant increases in allocations to areas of need while<br />
maintaining expenditure restraint and building up the Australian<br />
economy.<br />
Above all, the Government's policies reflect its fundamental<br />
philosophy that individual Australians, and Australian families,<br />
have the right, and must have the freedom, to decide for<br />
themselves their own needs, their own way of life. Our policies<br />
unlike the Opposition's are designed to give a constructive<br />
a positive and a properly limited role for government to make<br />
room for private enterprise, to make Australia strong by moving<br />
in a responsible and balanced way to a more competitive economy,<br />
to give people greater control over their own incomes by firmly<br />
setting this country on the only course leading to lower<br />
taxation, to develop opportunity, choice and power over their<br />
own lives for all Australians by appropriate government<br />
programmes for Aborigines, for migrants, for the elderly<br />
and for the young, to make government strong to protect<br />
the weak and open doors for the disadvantaged, and individuals'"<br />
strong to defend their rights and build the kind of life they want<br />
for themselves.<br />
In six years, Australia has been brought from the chaos of<br />
the Labor disaster to a condition of strength and prosperity<br />
with unrivalled prospects and a magnificent future.<br />
