FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 1 FEBRUARY 1982<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE<br />
SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE<br />
On 24 November 1981, I said that the announcement<br />
by France, Britain, the Netherlands and Italy of<br />
their intention to participate in the Sinai peacekeeping<br />
Force made it possible for Australia also to participate<br />
in the force. I indicated that we looked forward to<br />
Israel's acceptance of the European offer.<br />
The Governments of both Israel and Egypt have now<br />
accepted the offers made by these four European<br />
countries to participate in the peacekeeping force.<br />
With that matter resolved, the multi-national force<br />
has achieved the degree of balance which will enable<br />
Austral. ia to participate in this peacekeeping<br />
initiative. An announcement will be made in due course on the<br />
precise! composition of our contribution and the<br />
duration of our participation. As I have said, the<br />
commitment which we make will be consistent with<br />
that stated to the Parliament. 000---</p>
