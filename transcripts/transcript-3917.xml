PRIlME MW7C PRESS STATEMENT NO. 573<br />
12 October 1975<br />
COAL EXPORTS<br />
The Prime Minister today announced the outcome<br />
of a review, by the Resources Committee of Cabinet, of the<br />
future development of the Australian coal industry.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that last year<br />
Mr Connor had given an assurance to the Japanese steel<br />
industry that Japanese needs of Austral~ ian coal would be<br />
met. Further talks earlier this year with the steel mills<br />
indicated their intention to purchase the maximum quantity<br />
of coking coal from Australia, on condition that such coal<br />
is competitive and of acceptable quality. The mills have<br />
indicated the broad requirement of some 44-49 million tonnes<br />
of Australian coal per annum by 1980. This represents<br />
an additional 15-20 million tonnes per annum over the<br />
current level of contracts from Australia. In addition,<br />
the electric power industry in Japan has indicated a<br />
requirement of 15 million tonnes per annum of steaming coal<br />
by 1985, of which a substantial quantity is expected to be<br />
purchased from Australia.<br />
The Prime Minister said that if these additional<br />
tonnages are to be available there is an obvious need for<br />
some new coal development to take place. New projects which<br />
are at present planned by various companies include Hail<br />
Creek, Nebo, Norwich Park, Blair Athol, West Cliff, West<br />
Ballanibi, and Bargo. He said that the Government's view<br />
was that while it will continue to exercise an overall<br />
supervision of the coal industry, particularly to avoid over-supply,<br />
there would be a prima facie presumption that export<br />
approval would be given to projects which obtain sales<br />
contracts satisfactory to the Government, including its pricing<br />
policy requirements. New projects will, of course, also<br />
have to meet the Government's other policy objectives,<br />
including the foreign investment guidelines announced by the<br />
Primte Minister in his statement on 24 September. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Government anticipates that sufficient<br />
new projects will get underway in the near future to meet<br />
the expected increased demand as it falls due. Hail Creek<br />
has already been approved subject to foreign investment<br />
conditions being satisfied. As a further step in that<br />
direction, subject again to certain foreign investment<br />
conditions and to exchange control conditions being met,<br />
the Government is prepared to give the necessary export<br />
approvals to enable the Nebo project in the Bowen Basin<br />
of Queensland to proceed. And subject to satisfactory<br />
contracts being obtained, the Government also stands<br />
ready to approve such other projects as can meet the<br />
Government's foreign investment policy objectives. It<br />
would wish to see existing mines continue to play a viable<br />
role in meeting the present export demand level. In this<br />
context, the Government welcomes the assurance by the<br />
Japanese steel industry that, in the event of a reduction<br />
in their level of coking coal consumption, purchases<br />
of Australian coking coals under contract would not be<br />
reduced. It expects that in allocating purchasing contracts<br />
the Japanese industry will pay due'regard to the needs for<br />
a balanced and healthy development of the Australian coal<br />
industry. CANBERRA, A. C. T. I<br />
