    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government and NSW Government will invest $38.6 million to enhance cancer services at Gosford and Wyong Hospitals as part of the Central Coast Regional Cancer Service.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will provide $28.6 million and the NSW Government will provide a further $10 million, to provide the full spectrum of cancer services, including prevention and screening, treatment, palliative and supportive care.</p>
<p>With some cancers, patients from rural areas are up to three times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis than their counterparts in urban areas. The $38.6 million investment in Gosford and Wyong will work towards improving the services and care for the more than 32,000 NSW residents diagnosed with cancer each year.</p>
<p>The new facility at Gosford will include the construction of three radiotherapy bunkers, installation of two linear accelerators, a CT scanner and an additional five chemotherapy treatment chairs.</p>
<p>The funding will also support the enhancement of a multidisciplinary clinic and day oncology unit at Wyong Hospital.</p>
<p>Once fully operational, the Central Coast Regional Cancer Service is expected to provide treatment for an additional 828 radiotherapy patients per year and 2,500 additional chemotherapy treatments per year.</p>
<p>The Central Coast Regional Cancer Service forms part of the Rudd Government's $560 million commitment to establish regional cancer centres so that Australians can get care closer to home and their community.</p>
<p>While Australia has better overall cancer survival rates than comparable countries, there is still unacceptable variation for some people, depending on the type of cancer, a person's socioeconomic status or where they live.</p>
<p>It is of great concern that for the 30 per cent of Australians living in rural and remote areas, outcomes are worse than for people living in the city.</p>
<p>Since coming into office, the Rudd Government has committed over $2.3 billion in cancer infrastructure, medicines, screening and research.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also shows the benefit of the Federal Government stepping up to the plate and providing funding for health services across Australia.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Rudd Government would provide 60 per cent of the funding for capital upgrades for public hospitals.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally through local hospital networks to deliver better outcomes for local communities. </p>
