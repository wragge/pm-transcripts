    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government will create 400 local jobs and establish a new energy industry to provide more opportunities for businesses and families in the LaTrobe Valley.</p>
<p>These are real jobs being created right now.</p>
<p>The $50 million investment into a world-first Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) pilot project will open up a new global market, grow the local economy and create more jobs.</p>
<p>The pilot project will turn brown coal into hydrogen as we continue to diversify our energy sources.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is creating the economic conditions to create more jobs in our regions - not just in our cities.</p>
<p>The pilot will create over 400 direct and indirect jobs. It is an initial step towards a commercial-scale hydrogen supply chain to diversify energy sources.</p>
<p>Hydrogen energy is currently used in cars, electricity generation and industry.</p>
<p>The four-year joint federal, state and industry project will demonstrate the feasibility of turning brown coal from the abundant reserves in the Latrobe Valley into hydrogen to be exported to Japan.</p>
<p>A commercial HESC project has the potential to grow to add more than $8 billion to Australia’s economy.</p>
<p>We are not only creating a new industry and jobs in the Latrobe Valley and Port of Hastings, but building local skills in a future global hydrogen industry, estimated by the Hydrogen Council to be worth $2.5 trillion in 2050.</p>
<p>As our economy transitions, we must create new industries to provide jobs for today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Our CSIRO hydrogen and energy experts will be working with their Japanese counterparts, maximising the exchange of scientific knowledge created from the pilot, including in carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>Australia is well-placed to become a global hydrogen production and export leader, with abundant resources, excellent infrastructure and technical prowess in commodity development.</p>
<p>The project builds on the long-standing trade relationship between Japan and Australia on energy and resource commodities.</p>
<p>Investing in this feasibility pilot is a down payment on our future economic prosperity and security. We now embark on four critical, ground-breaking years.</p>
<p>The world-first Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain pilot project is significant for the cutting-edge science and technology it uses, for the potential it represents for Australian industry in hydrogen production and export, and for the jobs it will create.</p>
<p>The Australian and Victorian governments are providing a combined $100 million in funding to the $496 million pilot project, co-funded by a Japanese consortium — led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) — and the Japanese Government.</p>
<p>The project is being delivered by a consortium of large Japanese and Australian companies, including Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, J-Power (Electric Power Development Co. Ltd), Iwatani Corporation, Marubeni and AGL.</p>
