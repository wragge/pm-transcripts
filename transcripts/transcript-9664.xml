FOR MEDIA PRISONER VOTING<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Kim Beazley, today announced that the<br />
Government would not proceed with legislation to extend voting to all<br />
prisoners. Mr Beazley indicated he had made his decision after discussion with his<br />
colleague the Minister for Administrative Services, Frank Walker.<br />
Currently, prisoners who have committed offences which attract prison<br />
sentences of five years or less are entitled to vote. The recommendation to<br />
extend voting rights to all prisoners was put forward by the Joint Standing<br />
Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 1993 Federal Election.<br />
The recommendation was founded, in part, on advice from the Australian<br />
Electoral Commission that the current system created administrative<br />
difficulties. Mr Beazley said that while the Government had decided not to extend voting<br />
rights to all prisoners, it would look at ways of streamlining current<br />
arrangements. PERTH JULY 1995<br />
