FOR PRESS PM. NO. 82/ 1967<br />
FREE REPLACEMENT OF LOST MEDALS<br />
Earlier this year, Senator J. E. Marriott of Tasmania<br />
asked a Question V ithout Notice in regard to medals lost in the<br />
Tasmanian bushfires. Mr Holt today sent the following reply to the Senator:<br />
" Dear Senator Marriott, On 18th April, 1967, you asked the Leader of<br />
the Government in the Senate a Question Without Notice<br />
concerning Service Awards and Decorations lost in the recent<br />
bushfires in Tasmania. It is the practice to replace Campaign Stars,<br />
Decorations, etc., on production of a Statutory Declaration<br />
setting out the circumstances of loss or destruction<br />
In the past, a small charge ( including package<br />
and postage) has been made to cover the actual cost of the<br />
item to the Service Department concerned.<br />
I have now decided that free replaeement will<br />
be made to all ex-servicemen who can satisfactorily explain,<br />
by Statutory Declaration, the loss of the original free issue.<br />
This, of ourse, will apply to ex-servicemen who lost their<br />
medals in the Tasmanian bushfires.<br />
My colleague, the Treasurer, has been asked to<br />
refund any amount charged to ex-servicemen who have applied<br />
and paid for replacement consequent on the bushfires.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
HAROLD HOLT.<br />
CANBERRA, 17th August, 1967 </p>
