    <content><![CDATA[<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Good morning to you, Mr Howard</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Annie.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Did you hear from Mr Clinton this morning, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. The American government, after the attack had been launched,</p>
<p>   informed us and informed, presumably, other countries. My understanding</p>
<p>   is that there was overwhelming intelligence and material indicating</p>
<p>   a link between the destruction and loss of life in both Kenya and</p>
<p>   Tanzania as the result of the bomb outrages about 10 days ago and</p>
<p>   that these targets are directly linked with people who the Americans</p>
<p>   believe responsible for those terrorist attacks. Now on that basis</p>
<p>   what the President has done and what the Americans have done is</p>
<p>   justifiable and I support it.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>So will Australia be called on at all for any support further to</p>
<p>   this fight against terrorism?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn't have thought that Australia would be called</p>
<p>   upon to contribute anything. Australia, of course, has been willing</p>
<p>   in the past in relation to other activities to join the Americans</p>
<p>   but this represents an American response to the violent and murderous</p>
<p>   attack on American citizens and American assets about 10 days ago.</p>
<p>   And distasteful as it is, no country, including the United States,</p>
<p>   can sit by idle when attacks are made on its citizens and its citizens</p>
<p>   are murdered.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Alright Mr Howard we'll move on now to the big issue involving</p>
<p>   Australia, the GST. Are you finding it a little harder to sell than</p>
<p>   you thought it might be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I knew people would snipe at the margin. But what I say to</p>
<p>   the Australian public is think of the long term interests of Australia.</p>
<p>   We cannot go on forever with the existing tax system and I was fascinated</p>
<p>   to learn last night that this is the view of a Minister in the Keating</p>
<p>   Government who lost his seat at the last election.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>I must say Mr Howard, I see Gary Johns says that but he supports</p>
<p>   it ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is what he said, "I'm coming down firmly on the</p>
<p>   side of the Howard Government tax package because it's the</p>
<p>   sort of package that Labor will have to introduce at some stage</p>
<p>   in the future. Any honest, decent Government would". I can't</p>
<p>   think of a more emphatic endorsement.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Do you think there might be others who support him as well from</p>
<p>   that side of politics?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sure there are. I mean both Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley</p>
<p>   supported Mr Keating's 12.5% consumption tax in the 1980s.</p>
<p>   I know that in their hearts Labor know it's right to reform</p>
<p>   the tax system but what they want to do is to sneak back into office</p>
<p>   on the strength of a tax cut promise and nothing else. Now that's</p>
<p>   not good for Australia, you can't have tax relief and tax cuts</p>
<p>   without tax reform. We've reached that stage in our history</p>
<p>   where we have to embrace reform, we have to look at what is good</p>
<p>   for the country. You could always focus on one aspect of a plan</p>
<p>   like this and say it's bad or you don't like it or you</p>
<p>   wish it was something else. But if you think of the country and</p>
<p>   the long term benefit of Australia and Australians you have to support</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, while you might say there's endorsement there you'd</p>
<p>   have to say there's not too much endorsement if we look at</p>
<p>   the headlines of the newspapers today and we'll just put them</p>
<p>   on the screen. The Fin Review saying, "Tax package starts</p>
<p>   to fray" "Nursing home GST backdown" "PM caves</p>
<p>   in on GST for the aged" on The Australian. Do you see</p>
<p>   that? That's certainly not endorsement is it? (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that headline in The Australian is wrong. We haven't</p>
<p>   caved in on anything. We merely confirmed what was the case under</p>
<p>   the plan and that is that the cost of providing nursing home services</p>
<p>   will actually fall as a result of the GST and nursing home fees</p>
<p>   will be free of the GST. Now that's what we confirmed and what</p>
<p> Mr Costello said yesterday was that we would make certain that those</p>
<p>   two situations work their way through and that residents in nursing</p>
<p>   homes were not adversely affected. I mean they shouldn't be.</p>
<p>   If the cost of providing nursing home services actually falls there's</p>
<p>   no justification for an increase in nursing home fees. I mean that's</p>
<p>   a matter of common sense.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>But if their fees rise as a result of a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they shouldn't.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>But how can you guarantee, can you stop them rising?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Annie if your costs fall, if your costs go down you have no</p>
<p>   right to put your fees up do you?</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>What about low rent housing for pensioners what about rises there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The situation in relation to that is that the people who are living</p>
<p>   there will not be paying GST on the rent. But the question of future</p>
<p>   levels is a matter for State housing authorities. We don't</p>
<p>   control them and that is a matter that would be in the purview and</p>
<p>   the responsibility of State housing authorities.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>There is plenty of confusion about isn't there between State</p>
<p>   and Federal responsibilities in this which must make it harder for</p>
<p>   you to sell?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Annie, it is a complex area and if you're gutless and indifferent</p>
<p>   about the future you just walk away and you say it's too hard.</p>
<p>   But if you really have the long-term interests of the country at</p>
<p>   heart, you have the courage and the guts to try and do something</p>
<p>   to reform the system and that's what we're doing. And</p>
<p>   I ask Australians to put aside some of the petty politically partisan</p>
<p>   sniping from the side and to focus on our long-term future. Of course</p>
<p>   we will respond to detailed questions, we've provided enormous</p>
<p>   detail and that's why we've got a government funded education</p>
<p>   campaign. But the question people have got to ask is will this be</p>
<p>   good for our country? And in their hearts even Labor members, former</p>
<p>   Labor Ministers know that it will be and that is why we are pursuing</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, in your presentation of the tax package you said it</p>
<p>   was interlocked. Taking things out, putting things back in might</p>
<p>   dismantle it. Do you still stick by that or are you going to have</p>
<p>   to make some changes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, Annie, it is interlocked. For example, you can't</p>
<p>   get a dividend out of the cash economy of $3 billion unless you</p>
<p>   have a GST. You can't reform Commonwealth/State financial relations</p>
<p>   without a GST. You can't reduce the price of fuel in the bush</p>
<p>   without a GST. You can't reform the income tax system in a</p>
<p>   lasting way without a GST. Labor tried to do that in 1993, Mr Keating</p>
<p>   and Mr Beazley offered a tax cut and no GST. They got back into</p>
<p>   office they took away the tax cut and they increased every indirect</p>
<p>   tax they could lay their hands on and they provided no compensation</p>
<p>   to the nursing home residents, the pensioners or the battlers. In</p>
<p>   other words we got their GST but without compensation and no income</p>
<p>   tax cuts. And they had to do that because they found that the tax</p>
<p>   base was just ebbing away and unless we make this reform the tax</p>
<p>   base will continue to ebb away and that was a point made last night</p>
<p>   by the Reverend Tim Costello on behalf of the Baptist Church.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the States say they're not going to be dropping</p>
<p>   their payroll tax because there's not enough revenue coming</p>
<p>   back to them in the GST. Now that might be a bit of a blow to your</p>
<p>   plans is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not a blow because we didn't factor in them</p>
<p>   dropping their payroll tax. What we said was that we can go this</p>
<p>   far, we'd like to go further but that will have to await another</p>
<p>   phase of reform. This is a huge reform that reduces by $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   the cost of doing business in Australia and reduces the costs for</p>
<p>   exporters by $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>But gee, dropping payroll tax, wouldn't that be a boost?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course it would but you've got to find some money</p>
<p>   to pay for it and it's something, it's like $7-9 billion.</p>
<p>   Now you've got to pitch the GST at an acceptable level and</p>
<p>   to have got rid of payroll tax you'd have needed a GST of 13%</p>
<p>   or more. Now we think that would have been too high, we think 10%</p>
<p>   is the right level provided it applies across the board. You've</p>
<p>   got $13 billion of personal tax cuts, you've got cheaper fuel,</p>
<p>   a reduction in business costs. But it is an aggregate package and</p>
<p>   it is a bold and courageous attempt to fix something that everybody</p>
<p>   knows deep down needs fixing.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the support of welfare groups and welfare lobbies is</p>
<p>   very important to you and there isn't a great deal of support</p>
<p>   at the moment from such organisations as ACOSS and so on which one</p>
<p>   commentator described as political dynamite if you don't get</p>
<p>   their support. Now how can you get their support?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not a question of getting the support of this or</p>
<p>   that organisation. It's a question of getting the support of</p>
<p>   the Australian people. ACOSS won't determine the acceptability</p>
<p>   of this package, the Australian people will. And I notice this morning</p>
<p>   that Archbishop George Pell, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne</p>
<p>   speaking on behalf of the Catholic Church made it very clear that</p>
<p>   there is no such thing as a Catholic position on tax reform. He</p>
<p>   quite rightly made the point that Catholics and Christians generally</p>
<p>   will have different views according to their own personal attitudes.</p>
<p>   And the idea that the Churches are for or against a GST is ridiculous,</p>
<p>   and Archbishop Pell has made that perfectly plain and he also said</p>
<p>   that his personal view was that we needed a broadening of the tax</p>
<p>   base in order to support a decent welfare system. So I don't</p>
<p>   regard that as a criticism I regard it as good leadership, good</p>
<p>   leadership from Archbishop Pell asking people to look at the merits</p>
<p>   of the package according to their own personal political convictions.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you might have seen on our news, the Sydney Olympic</p>
<p>   Chief Executive, Sandy Hollway showing some concern about the cost</p>
<p>   of Olympic tickets after July 2000. Those bought before that won't</p>
<p>   attract a GST, those after worry him with his budgeting. What would</p>
<p>   you say to him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he shouldn't worry and he should think of Australia</p>
<p>   rather than taking a narrow view.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>This is Australia's Olympics Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but hang on, but the people who will be buying the tickets,</p>
<p>   the Australians who will be buying the tickets will have tax cuts.</p>
<p>   I mean on the 1st July the tax cuts come into operation so any increase</p>
<p>   in the price of things will be more than swapped by the increases</p>
<p>   in after tax income that people will have as a result of the personal</p>
<p>   tax cuts. That particular criticism is a classic example, if I may</p>
<p>   say so, of a taking a very narrow view and only telling half the</p>
<p>   story. Of course if you say I don't like a GST on this or that,</p>
<p>   that sounds plausible but if you were then were to go on and say</p>
<p>   but I recognise that everybody buying those tickets will have more</p>
<p>   money in their pocket so therefore the Games won't suffer you</p>
<p>   would be presenting a more plausible and more honest a picture.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, just in closing. Are you accepting any dinner invitations</p>
<p>   say on the weekend of October 17th?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Several, several. It's going to be a very, very enjoyable</p>
<p>   night.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>I see there have been a couple of little, there's a dog and</p>
<p>   cat show or something that normally takes place on October 17th</p>
<p>   where the tally room is in Canberra I understand it's been</p>
<p>   cancelled. Have you heard about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I saw some news report about it but I can tell you without any</p>
<p>   equivocation I have not decided when the election will be. Like</p>
<p>   any other Prime Minister I would like to have an election at a good</p>
<p>   time. It won't be on the weekend of the grand finals, I can</p>
<p>   certainly rule out the last weekend in September. No chance at all</p>
<p>   of an election on the last weekend in September.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>A lot of people will be very pleased with that Mr Howard. And what</p>
<p>   about the fact that the English, your favourite cricketing opponent,</p>
<p>   they're coming here late October for the Ashes tour, the first</p>
<p>   Test is on November the 20th, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Well I'm looking forward to that. And I'm looking</p>
<p>   forward to a great contest and I'm sure Australia will hang</p>
<p>   on to the Ashes. I want to see a lot of cricket during the summer</p>
<p>   as well.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>So you might have to fit something in between October the 17th</p>
<p>   and November the 20th perhaps?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I always try and harmonise cricketing pursuits with others.</p>
<p>ANNE FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you so much for giving us some of your very precious</p>
<p>   time here on 11AM today, we really appreciate it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
