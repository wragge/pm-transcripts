STERLING DEVALUATION: CAB I NET DISCUSSES<br />
EFFECTS ON AUSTRALIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
When announcing on 20th November the decision of the<br />
Government that there should be no change made In the value of the<br />
Australian Dollar following the British Government's amnouucement of,<br />
devaluation of the Pound Sterling, I said that Cabinet recognised that the<br />
effects of this decision would fall unevenly on the Australian economy,<br />
I referred to the fact that some industries, particularly some primary<br />
industries, are more closely linked with the British market than others,<br />
and commented that the difficulties of affected industries were currently<br />
under urgent examination to find appropriate ways and means of overcoming<br />
their problems. Cabinet has had before It today a series of papers arising<br />
out of this examination by Departments. Our discussion this morning<br />
was directed to a paper prepared by the Treasury which dealt with the<br />
more general Implications, together with the economic context In which<br />
they should be seen. This paper covered recent developments overseas,<br />
Including the extent of devaluations in various countries; our reserves<br />
position and balance of payments prospects; our general budget position<br />
and prospects; and trends in the Australian economy.<br />
We recognised the difficulty, especially at this early<br />
stage, of making anything in the nature of precise calculations of the<br />
effects on Australia of the recent devaluations. However, It is now clear<br />
that the Sterling devaluation has not been accompanied by an extensive<br />
chain of devaluations on the part of other countries. Our holdings of<br />
gold and foreign exchange now amount to about 070 million. As our<br />
drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund stand at $ 630 million,<br />
our total first and second line reserves amount to about $ 1,700 million.<br />
Thus, our reserves position is quite strong.<br />
While it Is not possible to make a precise assessment of<br />
the direct and Indirect effects of the overseas devaluations on our balance<br />
of payments for the remainder of the year, we believe that, so far as the<br />
direct effect Is concerned, apart from the downward adjustments in our<br />
Sterling balances, the net effect of the devaluations will be quite small.<br />
We have every confidence in the longer term situation of our balance of<br />
payments. We do not believe that the devaluations are likely to lead<br />
to any large net effect on this year's Budget, apart from any decisions we<br />
might take to deal with problems arising from them. We have concluded<br />
from our study of the Treasury paper that, faced as we are with these<br />
moderate devaluations by countries , which account for only a relatively<br />
small proportion of our total trade, and which have little slack to expand<br />
outward by more than a few per cent, the net direct effects on our<br />
domestic economy as a whole should be quite small. There is reason to<br />
believe that in the longer term, the effects on our economy should be<br />

favourable. We are not in a position, however-to. make firm judgments<br />
as to indirect effects which might flow from the conditions now being<br />
experienced throughout the world as a result of the devaluation of a major<br />
currency. We considered this afternoon the effects of Sterling<br />
devaluation on rural industry, secondary industry, minerals and metals,<br />
freight rates and our Territories. These were dealt with in papers<br />
prepared by the Departments of Trade and Industry, National Development,<br />
Primary Industry and Territories.<br />
Total exports to all markets of rural products In 1966-67<br />
amounted to 051 million. Of this total, some $ 408 million, or twenty<br />
per cent, was exported to Britain and other countries which have devalued.<br />
The Minister for Primary Industry has asked all the Commonwealth<br />
Marketing Boards to examine as a matter of urgency and advise him of<br />
their view of the full Implications of the effects of the British devaluation<br />
on the industries with which they are concerned. It is evident that it<br />
will be some time before a full assessment of the effects on all industries<br />
can be made, but Cabinet hopes to have a more complete picture before<br />
the meetings it will be holding In the week of 11th December.<br />
We have already agreed, at their request, to meet<br />
representatives of t he manufacturing industries that week, and are<br />
considering a variety of representations and requests from other<br />
Industries. The Cabinet has made a good deal of progress in its<br />
consideration of a programme of export Incentives. It has been asked<br />
by industry representatives to defer a decision on this until the effects of<br />
devaluation can be more clearly seen. However, it is our desire to<br />
announce our export incentives programme In the course of the next few<br />
weeks. We shall do this after taking into account the views of Industry.<br />
CANBERRA, November, 1967. </p>
