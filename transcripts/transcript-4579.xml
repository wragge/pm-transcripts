AUSALI( A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 4 DECEMBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
As a principal part of our economic policy the Government is<br />
creating conditions for a fall in interest rates. We believe<br />
it is essential that interest rates fall so that Australia's<br />
economic recovery continues.<br />
It is vital for many reasons. It is vital for the build up of<br />
business investment for the re-equipment of our factories<br />
and for the building of new plant. That will create jobs.<br />
A fall in interest rates would also be reflected in a stronger<br />
stock exchange which will help in the raising of new share<br />
capital. It will lower thcostof new fixed interest capital borrowings<br />
and thus encourage businesses to borrow more so that their<br />
operations can be expanded. That will create new jobs.<br />
As lower interest rates help to improve the investment outlook<br />
there will be a greater willingness for overseas investors to<br />
provide capital to-Australian industry. This will lead to a<br />
further strengthening of our dollar.<br />
For hundreds of thousands of Australians, a fall in interest rates<br />
will have immediate and direct impact. Lower interest rates will<br />
reduce the cost of buying or building a new home the cost of<br />
mortgage finance will be lower up to $ 10 a week on an average<br />
building society loan for a new home.<br />
The effect of lower interest rates on existing mortgages will be<br />
even more widely felt. Lower interest rates will mean even more<br />
young people will be able to buy or build. That will quickly lead<br />
to increased demand for furniture and household goods and<br />
appliances. As a consequence factories will run at a higher level of<br />
capacity that will create jobs.<br />
Lower interest rates improve standards of living in many direct<br />
and indirect ways. It will mean low cost of bank finance,<br />
personal loans and consumer credit; thus assisting families<br />
to buy consumer goods from retailers.<br />
Lower interest rates help to raise share prices that benefits<br />
Australians whose savings, particularly for-retirement, are<br />
invested directly and indirectly through the stock exchange, / All these </p>
<p>-2<br />
All these rewards can begin to be realised over the next twelve<br />
months, only if current economic policies are maintained.<br />
Now compare Labor's stated economic plans. Its commitment to<br />
increase Government spending and a much larger Government<br />
deficit does not mean lower interest rates nor does it mean<br />
a continuation of existing levels of interest rates.<br />
A Labor Government would mean higher and rising interest rates.<br />
Their spending and wage policies will increase inflationary<br />
expectations and, inevitably, lead to higher interest rates.<br />
Clearly that would damage business investment and consumer confidence.<br />
It is notable that Mr. Whitlam, Mr. Hurford,. Mr. Willis, Mr. Hdyden<br />
and Mr. Hawke the men who make economic policy pronouncements for<br />
Labor haven't told us their interest rate policy.<br />
Mr. Hayden challenges the Government's expectations of a 2%<br />
reduction in interest rates over the next twelve months. He<br />
fails to grasp, or does not want to grasp, that interest rates<br />
will come down because inflation is coming down.<br />
Again, over the last few weeks, major companies in Australia,<br />
together-with their underwriters, have expressed their confidence<br />
in this outlook by continuing to ' lower the interest rates on<br />
medium and long term debentures.<br />
When a Government pursues economic policies that get inflation<br />
down and strengthen the economy, interest rates will fall.<br />
In the United States, in.-the twelve months from December 1974, the<br />
*.. bank lending rates-for top industrial companies fell by 3%.<br />
In Britain, in the nine months to September this year, the<br />
equivalent rate fell from 15% to 8%.<br />
Mr. Hayden says it cannot be done. What'he means is that under-<br />
K. * his-policies it could not be'done..<br />
our-policies are putting. Australians-in-jobs.<br />
We have stopped the massive rate of increase in unemployment.<br />
because we are encouraging industry to increase employment<br />
opportunities. Lower interest rates' will give even more'<br />
incentive.<br />
* We are protecting industry-and saving-jobs.<br />
Labor has refused to guarantee to protect tens of thousands of<br />
jobs in the apparel industry. Labor wants to pursue free trade<br />
policies. They know this will throw workers out of their jobs.<br />
We are reducing inflation, encouraging development that will<br />
make new jobs.<br />
Labor will again stifle development increase inflation at the<br />
expense of jobs. / We are </p>
<p>-3<br />
We are reducing interest rates that will encourage<br />
activity throughout the community and provide more jobs.<br />
Labor's big spending policies will increase interest rates<br />
and add to unemployment.<br />
Sadly, Mr. Whitlam's Labor Party no longer represents the<br />
working men and women of Australia and he knows it.<br />
His economic policies will not reduce unemployment -they<br />
will add to it.<br />
His tariff policies will again create another pool of<br />
jobless. His wage policies regrettably mean prolonged<br />
unemployment. His tax policies will penalise hundreds<br />
of thousands of trade unionists.<br />
Mr. Whitlam's Labor Party the Party that increased<br />
unemployment by 192,000 in-one year alone, precisely because<br />
of these policies is a sad and sorry shadow of the Party<br />
of Chifley, of Curtin and of Caiwell.<br />
It is out of touch with today's realities.<br />
It is out of touch with Australia's working men and women.<br />
