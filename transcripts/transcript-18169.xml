Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the start of stage three of the rollout of the National Broadband Network  -  creating up to 800 new jobs.</p>
<p>The stage three rollout will extend to a further 90,000 homes and businesses in Burnie, Devonport, Launceston and Hobart, employing around 800 workers at its peak.</p>
<p>By June next year, the NBN will be rolling out across 12 sites in Tasmania with each site employing around 40 workers.</p>
<p>At the peak of activity in 2015, there will be 20 sites under construction with 800 Tasmanians working on the massive infrastructure project.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced today that from Tuesday, Tasmanian businesses can apply for grants under an $8 million Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund to help them create long term, sustainable jobs.</p>
<p>The fund is part of the $120 million package recently announced to support regional development projects under the Tasmanian Forests Intergovernmental Agreement.</p>
<p>The fund is a vital part of the economic package to improve the diversification and breadth of Tasmania's economy.</p>
<p>In particular, it will assist areas affected by the restructure of the forestry sector with innovative and ongoing job creation projects.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has invested more than $100 million in skills training and job services in Tasmania in the past year, providing greater opportunities for Tasmanians to up-skill and re-train. </p>
<p>To celebrate the inaugural National Skills Week, the Prime Minister and Member for Franklin, Julie Collins today met apprentices training for a new career at the Skills Institute in Hobart.</p>
<p>They were joined by Australian Apprentice of the Year, Hobart electrician Jason Bryan.</p>
<p>The apprentices will meet the growing demand for skilled workers in the renewable and sustainable energy and sectors and for the NBN.</p>
<p>NBN Co is working with Government employment and training agencies to develop a coordinated approach to build a trained labour pool for the NBN rollout.</p>
<p>Around 50 per cent of the new NBN jobs will require semi-skilled labour, meaning unemployed or displaced workers could be quickly prepared to undertake these tasks.</p>
<p>A further 30 per cent of the new NBN workforce will be cablers who will require a Certificate 3 accreditation, which can be achieved with 18 months of training, including time on the job.</p>
<p>The rollout of the NBN will have a significant impact on the Tasmanian economy with the new jobs and opportunities for businesses to provide additional supplies, transport and other services.</p>
<p>Record numbers of Tasmanians are seizing the opportunity to get training and formal qualifications for the skilled jobs emerging in the economy, including more than 12,000 apprentices and trainees.</p>
<p>These students are among a record number of nearly 47,000 Tasmanians studying to gain formal qualifications through Vocational Education and Training.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government will host the Future Jobs Forum this week, attended by industry and union leaders.</p>
<p>All parties will work together at the forum, exploring practical and innovative measures to create the jobs of the future. </p>
