<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'd like, I know on behalf of all Australians, to thank</p>
<p> Mark Taylor for a magnificent innings as captain of Australia. He</p>
<p> has been a very great captain. He's had a terrific record. He</p>
<p> struggled through a period of personal batting adversity with tremendous</p>
<p> courage and kept his good humour and his good spirit. Never took his</p>
<p> eye off the responsibility of leading the Australian team. I want</p>
<p> to wish him and Judy, and their two children the very best for the</p>
<p> future. I think his decision is both understandable and correct. And</p>
<p> once again he's displayed a good judgement and I wish him well</p>
<p> for the future and I warmly thank him for the memories of some magnificent</p>
<p> innings and tremendous leadership.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM, do you have thoughts on a successor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a matter for the selectors and the Australian Cricket Board.</p>
<p> I am the Prime Minister I won't give a running commentary of</p>
<p> things like that. I don't think it's fair to the administrators.</p>
<p> Of course I have thoughts, but I'll keep them to myself.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think he's been Australia's best Test Captain?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look, let's not get into comparisons. He must take his place</p>
<p> alongside people like Bradman, and Ian Chappell, and Richie Benaud.</p>
<p> Different people for different periods take different things into</p>
<p> account. West Indies perhaps haven't been as strong in the last</p>
<p> few years as they were in the 1970s and the 1980s. On the other hand</p>
<p> he's gone through some difficult personal periods which some</p>
<p> other captains didn't go through. And I don't want to sort</p>
<p> of start making comparisons, they're odious.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] Prime Minister when he was making up his mind?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, he runs his own life. We talk to each other from time to</p>
<p> time. I'm quite sure his ultimate council, as it should be, his</p>
<p> wife and family.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think Australian Test Cricket can maintain its momentum in</p>
<p> the short term?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm quite certain it can. I mean there's enormous depth</p>
<p> in Australian cricket, enormous depth and I have no doubt that the</p>
<p> team will continue to be a very strong one, no doubt at all. But thank</p>
<p> you Mark for the tremendous contribution to Australian cricket.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have not...[inaudible].</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have (inaudible) like a standing ovation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I was delighted to see that Test Match, it was one of the best</p>
<p> matches I've seen in years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM, can I just ask you, are you pleased with today's trade figures?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a very good figure. It's only one month, but it is</p>
<p> an excellent figure and it's way better than market expectations.</p>
<p> But I emphasise it's only one month.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
