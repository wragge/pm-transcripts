    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Senator Ryan on his appointment as President of the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate Presidency is a vital role in our Parliament. The Senate President represents all Senators, ensures the smooth running of the Senate Chamber and works with the Speaker to ensure the Parliament is resourced, secure and able to conduct its business.</p>
<p>Senator Ryan will make a fine Senate President, just as he has been effective, capable and successful in his service as Special Minister of State for which I thank him.</p>
<p>As a result of his appointment, Senator Ryan has today resigned from his ministerial responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Mathias Cormann will now take on additional responsibilities as acting Special Minister of State.</p>
<p>Senator Cormann served in this role earlier this year.</p>
<p>He is one of the most senior ministers in the Government, and will handle the additional duties with his usual skill and calm.</p>
<p>I congratulate him on his appointment.</p>
