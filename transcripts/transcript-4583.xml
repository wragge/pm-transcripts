FOR PRESS 5 DECEMBER 1977<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT FORECASTS<br />
The unemployment forecast prepared within the Department<br />
of Employment and Industrial Relations leaked to the press<br />
tonight was dated 23 August 1977.<br />
This forecast forms part of an internal confidential Departme-tal<br />
working document which was put together without the complete<br />
knowledge of the backup Budget documents and of important development<br />
since then.<br />
The forecast is therefore outdated and misleading for the<br />
following reasons:<br />
. It does not-take full account of the Budget.<br />
It takes no account of the low C. P. I. increase of<br />
2 percent in the September quarter. Indeed, the<br />
document from which the figures have been selectively<br />
leaked assumed the September quarter C. P. I. increase woul<br />
be greater than that in each of the two preceding<br />
quarters. The forecast also takes no account of the good<br />
September quarter growth in the Gross Domestic Product,<br />
as revealed in last week's quarterly National<br />
Accounts. These accounts confirmed the improvement in<br />
the trade account with an expansion of 5.3 percent in<br />
exports and decline of 6 percent in imports. / 2 </p>
<p>It also takes no account of the important decline in<br />
interest rates and of the Government's policy<br />
( following the Budget and the September quarter C. P. I.)<br />
to keep interest rates falling.<br />
It does not take account of recent statistics showing<br />
a strong increase in both actual capital expenditure<br />
In the September quarter and expected capital<br />
expenditure for the December half-year.<br />
In addition to the foregoing factors, it has been known that<br />
an election would have to be held within 12 months.<br />
Once it is clear that the Government's policies will be<br />
continued as will be confirmed on Saturday additional<br />
confidence will assist the pace of economic recovery.<br />
This will then be followed by a December quarter C. P. I. which partly<br />
because of the Government's policy in keeping down State and<br />
Commonwealth indirect taxes and charges will show one of the<br />
lowest increases for many years for that period. This will<br />
reinforce the recovery in economic activity.<br />
Hence, these forecasts, like those of the ANZ Bank,<br />
have been surpassed by a series of important developments and<br />
Government initiatives since they were prepared. </p>
