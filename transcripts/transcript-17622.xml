HOST: Thanks for joining us on the inaugural 6pm program, Prime Minister. It's a small moment in Australian media history, I know, but thanks for being with us. We will talk about what you've been up to in Brisbane today, because I know you've been very busy with the flood relief, but can I ask you a personal straight political question? You've had so much on your plate before the floods I wouldn't blame you if you've had second thoughts on whether or not it was such a smart idea last year to knock over Kevin Rudd. You could say who in their right mind would want to try and run this country at the moment?</p>
<p>PM: Well George let me congratulate you on a moment in history with your new show, and let me say it's a privilege to serve in this position each and every day. I took this position to lead the nation in the best of times and in the worst of times and we've been doing it really tough. This is not the summer we wanted, George, we wanted a nice lazy summer where we could sit at home and watch the cricket, but this is what Mother Nature has done, and we are going to pull together and recover from this.</p>
<p>And every day that I'm out speaking to people I'm just blown away by the community spirit</p>
<p>HOST: I know you've been dealing today with apprentices and people who are eventually going to help in the post-flood reconstruction as it were, a mammoth task. PM are we up to it? I know you're going to try tell me that we are but, in all honesty, are we?</p>
<p>PM: George I'm telling you we're up to it because we are up to it. Here in Brisbane today, I've done two kind of contrasting things but they've been on a theme. I've been in a boardroom talking to the representatives of corporate Australia about what more they can do to help with the efforts to rebuild Queensland and the nation, and I'm here and I've been in Tracy's home, looking at the flood damage, meeting with Matt and the apprentices that he employs, and they're here volunteering, helping Tracy through as just one of the flood victims in Queensland.</p>
<p>So businesses from the biggest in the nation through to local small businesses, are pulling together, and it's been great to meet with the apprentices here. They're part of our workforce of 26,000 apprentices. They're going to be pulling together for the flood effort.</p>
<p>HOST: While you've been busy up there in Brisbane, there's a lot of debate going on, as we speak in fact, about this one-off levy that you've proposed, but isn't a better long-term solution a national disaster fund? Or are we going to have to cop you and Tony Abbott getting at each other ad nauseam over whether a levy is what he would call another great big tax?</p>
<p>PM: The only thing you're going to hear from me is just some plain speaking about what the nation needs and what we need to do now is rebuild. That's going to mean some Budget cutbacks, there'll be tough choices there, probably some complaints, but we're going to do it George because we need to free up the money for the rebuilding, and there may also be a levy.</p>
<p>Australians, I think, understand that part of the contract between us, part of the thing about being Australians together, is that we work together in tough times. The choices I'm making now aren't easy decisions but they're about the nation getting the job done and rebuilding Queensland and other parts of the country.</p>
<p>HOST: I don't want to end on a negative note, but the word I keep hearing from the commentators about your own performance at the moment is that it's disappointing. We like Julia Gillard, we admire Julia Gillard, but it's a bit disappointing. What would you give yourself - honestly - out of 10 at the moment? How do you think you're going?</p>
<p>PM: George look I don't worry about any of that and this isn't about me. This is about people like Tracy whose home's been flooded. This is about people like Matt who is here helping with the rebuilding, helping with the renovation of Tracy's home. This is about leading the nation during a difficult time, making the decisions we need so that we can do the rebuilding here in Queensland and beyond. That's my focus.</p>
<p>HOST: Well you've certainly got plenty on your plate, that's true. Thanks, Prime Minister, thanks again for your time.</p>
<p>PM: Thanks for the opportunity George, and good luck with the first show. </p>
