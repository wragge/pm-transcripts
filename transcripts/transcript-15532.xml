    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce that the Australian Government will provide funding of $1 million to the Sydney Christmas Parade Trust to assist with the presentation of the inaugural Sydney Christmas Parade to be held on 25 November 2007.  </p>
<p>The Sydney Christmas Parade aims to promote unity and goodwill amongst the people of Sydney and strengthen the sense of community by encouraging people to join together to celebrate Christmas and the holiday season.  Charitable organisations will also benefit from funds that the Trust hopes to raise through the event, thereby sharing the spirit of Christmas with those in need.</p>
<p>As well as being a celebration of Christ's birth, Christmas is also part of our Australian culture.  It is a time to renew friendships and catch up with people we haven't seen for far too long and most importantly it is a time to spend with our families and loved ones who mean so much to all of us.</p>
<p>The Sydney Christmas Parade aims to attract hundreds of thousands of spectators and involve up to 60 community, multicultural and corporate floats.</p>
<p>I commend the Sydney Christmas Parade Trust for its contribution to the community and encourage everybody to participate in and support what promises to be an enjoyable and memorable event.  </p>
