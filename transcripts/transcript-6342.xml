JAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 March 1984<br />
Today's EPAC meeting focussed on longer-term economic policy,<br />
as agreed in the December meeting.<br />
I reported in some detail on the! issues of industry and<br />
trade policy that had arisen in relation to my recent visit<br />
to five Asian countries. There was strong support for the<br />
approach outlined in my statements prior to and during the<br />
Asian visit, in particular in my speech in Osaka on February 3.<br />
I explained that I had asked Senator Button to co-ordinate the<br />
work of a range of Ministers in areas relevant to structural<br />
change in the economy. Senator Button attended the EPAC<br />
meeting during discussion of longer term policy.<br />
There was a highly constructive discussion of industry policy,<br />
which fully justifies the government's high expectations of<br />
the usefulness of EPAC. This led to the development of an<br />
agreed statement on medium to longer-term economic policy,<br />
which is attached.<br />
In this context, the Council agreed that the Office should<br />
prepare annually a detailed medium-term assessment of the<br />
Australian economy and that this assessment be released after<br />
consideration at the December EPAC meeting. The assessment.<br />
should be broadly based and should include:<br />
An analysis of overseas economic conditions as they<br />
are likely to affect Australia during the next few<br />
years. An analysis of the sectoral structure of the economy<br />
and of the changing industrial composition of<br />
production and employment.<br />
An evaluation of prospective develIopments in capital<br />
and labour markets and of the outlook for prices.<br />
A review of the trends in size and composition of the<br />
Australian population and of the economic implications<br />
of such changes.<br />
An analysis of the prospective siLze, composition and<br />
financing of the public sector.<br />
The likely rate of growth in and distribution of<br />
national income.<br />
Council agreed that the office should develop and use such models<br />
as are appropriate in preparing the assessment, but that<br />
extensive use be made of other source materials and the results<br />
of research undertaken elsewhere. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
An opportunity should also be given for community views to be<br />
taken into account in developing this assessment.<br />
There was also discussion of papers by EPAC members on taxation,<br />
directed to longer-term policy formulation.<br />
I am grateful to EPAC members for the productive effort that.<br />
they have put into the work on taxation policy for this meeting.<br />
EPAC agreed that<br />
it is clear from these contributions that there are<br />
shortcomings in the present taxation structure, whether<br />
viewed from the standpoint of the efficient long-term<br />
growth of the Australian economy, or of the building of a<br />
more equitable Australian society.<br />
It is also clear that taxation reform must consist<br />
of an overall package. Single elements of taxation<br />
reform cannot properly be judged in isolation.<br />
For community discussion of these matters, and in the end<br />
government decision, to be productive, it should focus on<br />
inter-related packages of measures. This makes the matter<br />
highly complex, and it will take considerable time for<br />
informed community attitudes to emerge.<br />
Reform of the taxation structure is a long-term matte:-,<br />
with large implications for the g~ rowth and structure of the<br />
Australian economy. Different se ctors of the economy<br />
have put very different views to EPAC.<br />
Consistent with the government's approach to building<br />
community consensus on complex issues, the government<br />
will not take positions on these matters until there ' has<br />
been wide community discussion and until informed<br />
attitudes to alternative packages have emerged.<br />
It was accepted that the government's -immediate priorities on<br />
taxation reform are to support the Prices and Incomes Accord and to<br />
everything to strengthimn and broaden and to do nothing to weaken<br />
the economic recovery which is now underway. To this end, the<br />
government has made it clear that it will provide some relief on<br />
personal income taxation * for low and middle income earners<br />
in the coming budget if threoverall budgetary situation allows<br />
it to do so.<br />
Papers on medium and longer-term. economic policy, taxation<br />
and other matters, which were presented to the meeting have been<br />
declassified to facilitate public discussion. A list of available<br />
papers is attached. / 3 </p>
<p>EPAC STATEMENT ON MEDIUM TO LONGER-TEMI ECONOMIC POLICY<br />
1. In its last two meetings, EPAC has deliberated on<br />
longer-term problems of economic growth and employmen,:..<br />
This will be a central focus of the work of EPAC.<br />
To guide this work, the EPAC today recognised that<br />
the medium to longer-term problems demand an approach of:<br />
A. Generating and maintaining high growth rates<br />
B. Influencing the participation rates to assist<br />
in reducing the level of unemployment.<br />
2. High growth rates are essential to meeting Australia'S<br />
employment and wider national ambitions. In sustaining<br />
high and continuing growth rates it is recognised thai:<br />
A. Australian industry needs to be internationally<br />
competitive<br />
B. Australia has advantages in natural and human resources<br />
which need to be further developed<br />
C. Growth must be broadly based across the economy<br />
D. Growth will require high levels of investment<br />
from home and abroad<br />
E. There must be stability in government policy over long<br />
periods of time to allow implementation of plans for<br />
high levels of investment<br />
F. A more co-operative less combative pattern of<br />
industrial relations should continue to be developed<br />
G. Growth policy must work within constraints imposed<br />
by the availability of productive resources and<br />
capacities, and by the reqjuiremnents of stability<br />
in the balance of payments and in domestic financial<br />
markets </p>
<p>3. In the development strategy for maintaining high and<br />
continuing growth rates it is recognised that<br />
A. The Government and the A. C. T. U. are committed<br />
to the Prices and Incomes Accord to provide:<br />
Wage and Price stability,<br />
opportunity for business to plan new investment<br />
in a more certain economic environment<br />
B. Fiscal and monetary policy should continue to be<br />
based on providing stimulus without accommodating<br />
any reversal in the downward trend in inflation<br />
4. It is recognised that the incomes policies and the<br />
monetary and fiscal policies taken together cannot alone<br />
create the circumstances to satisfy the objective of<br />
continuing high growth rates.<br />
It is recognised that we need to develop integrated<br />
and dynamic policies across all sectors.<br />
If we are to develop such policies we need to manage<br />
change constructively rather than simply to respond<br />
to change. In doing so we need to accept and plan for<br />
faster rates of change, which are consistent with our<br />
objectives. In particular on protection, consistent with<br />
the shared understanding that change must occur if grcwth<br />
is to ensue, policy must be applied in a manner which<br />
facilitates change while minimising the hardship associated<br />
with such change. </p>
<p>An active industry development strategy should be<br />
developed in which:<br />
A. Encouragement and opportunities to plan and invdst<br />
enterprises<br />
are given to industries or/ involved in expansion<br />
of competitive production.<br />
B. The infrastructure for industry development is<br />
improved and provided more efficiently.<br />
C. Industry and the workers in them are given the<br />
opportunity to adjust to change within stable<br />
programs that are known in advance of their application.<br />
D. There is a limit on artificial and bureaucratic<br />
regulation, and there is reduction in regulation which<br />
encourages neither economic efficiency nor social<br />
equity.<br />
6. It is generally recognised that the labor demand side<br />
measures are the primary method of generating employment<br />
opportunities. However, there are a range of options<br />
relating to labor supply policies, affecting labour force<br />
participation, which can be developed on an agreed basis.<br />
These include:<br />
raising the proportion of young people who experience<br />
higher levels of formal education<br />
facilitating voluntary earlier retirement<br />
reducing the cost penalties associated with employment<br />
of additional persons compared with increasing overtime<br />
distributing national productivity increases in a<br />
manner which increases employment opportunities<br />
carefully and strictly controlled introduction of<br />
part time work. </p>
