" The existing support networks and<br />co-operation between services will continue."<br />Mr Staples said that he would be advising State welfare<br />Ministers and community representatives on details of the<br />new program. Legislation is expected in Parliament in the<br />Autumn session next year.<br />FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Lancia Jordana ( 062) 77 7220 .3231</p>
