PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF NATIONAL FILM AND SOUND ARCHIVE'S<br />
' TAKE 88' EXHIBITION<br />
CHATSWOOD 1 AUGUST 1988<br />
We are launching today a unique new venture in Australia's<br />
cultural life the first travelling exhibition mounted by<br />
the Australian National Film and Sound Archive.<br />
In a very real sense movies and television programmes and<br />
radio broadcasts are the essence of our popular culture.<br />
Living in 1988 we are accustomed to being entertained and<br />
informed by the avalanche of images pouring from our TVs and<br />
cinemas and the cascade of sound emerging from our radios<br />
and record players.<br />
But it is easy to forget just how fragile are the image and<br />
sound recordings that provide the basis of this culture.<br />
Nitrate films, wax phonograph cylinders, radio discs are all<br />
s ubject to decomposition and disintegration unless they are<br />
cared for; video tape of news broadcasts and sporting events<br />
are liable to be erased and reused unless they are copied<br />
and stored.<br />
That is why the Government established the National Film and<br />
Sound Archive to provide in a proper way for the<br />
preservation of these fragile expressions of our national<br />
heritage and creativity and not just the preservation but<br />
the display of them. That is what this exhibition,<br />
' Take 88' seeks to do.<br />
This exhibition will allow large numbers of Australians over<br />
the coming months not only to relive some of the great<br />
moments of Australian screen and sound but also to<br />
appreciate the importance of the task of preserving them for<br />
future generations.<br />
Take 88 includes a tremendous range of footage and broadcast<br />
material, old and new from Australia's oldest surviving<br />
film, showing the Melbourne Cup of 1896, and the synthetic<br />
cricket tests broadcast on radio in the 1930s, to the 1956<br />
Melbourne Olympics and our Bicentennial Australia Day<br />
celebrations this year. 745 </p>

You will see the ads for Aeroplane Jelly and early model<br />
Holdens, news broadcasts and movie newsreels, quiz shows,<br />
comedians ranging from Roy Rene ' No' to Norman Gunston,<br />
musicians from Dame Nellie Melba to Slim Dusty, and products<br />
of one of the oldest and one of the best film industries in<br />
the world our own film industry, which has been producing<br />
box office successes to critical acclaim for more than<br />
years.<br />
And it's important to recognise that all the videos shown in<br />
this exhibition have been dubbed and edited by technicians<br />
in the Archive's own laboratory.<br />
There are many people to thank for the hard work involved in<br />
mounting this exhibition. I congratulate both the Wesgo<br />
Group for its financial support, and Westfield for providing<br />
venues in four states and travel costs. And I applaud the<br />
initiative of the National Film and Sound Archive in<br />
deciding to show the Australian people in this most direct<br />
of ways just how rich is its collection.<br />
z invite you all to enjoy the show and I have much pleasure<br />
in declaring open ' Take 88'.<br />
