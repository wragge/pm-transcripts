    <content><![CDATA[<p> The failure of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, at</p>
<p> the end of Question Time today to either rebuke or support the inflammatory</p>
<p> and irresponsible remarks of Senator Nick Bolkus is a dismal failure</p>
<p> of his leadership.</p>
<p>Senator Bolkus' remarks attacking police and security service action</p>
<p> to remove illegal items and a fire from the Parliamentary precincts</p>
<p> were totally untrue and deeply offensive to Australian Federal Police</p>
<p> and Australian Protective Service officers carrying out their duties.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley's refusal to rebuke Senator Bolkus was pathetic.</p>
<p>He compounded this weakness by responding to my comments with a welter</p>
<p> of irrelevancies unrelated to the issue I had raised.</p>
<p>The remarks of Senator Bolkus were calculated to inflame division</p>
<p> within the community, not promote the cause of reconciliation.</p>
<p> 11 February 1999</p>
