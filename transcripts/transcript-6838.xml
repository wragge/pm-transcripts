PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON 4 CORNERS MONDAY 10 FEBRUARY 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: The Hawke Government is entering its fourth year<br />
with the economy looking pretty good and the Opposition not so<br />
good. But there are a few clouds on the Canberra horizon<br />
nonetheless. Prime minister thanks for joining us. I suppose<br />
the biggest cloud must be the mood in the bush right now. You<br />
massaged the farmers in Western Australia for all your worth, and<br />
yet they still showed you the door.<br />
PM: Well you're wrong on that. You don't want to believe<br />
everything you read in the press in the immediate analysis. From<br />
what's been indicated to me, in fact the vote in rural West<br />
Australia has held up. So I would hold your fire on that one<br />
Andrew. JOURNALIST: Well Brian Burke seemed to be impressed by the<br />
figures too, because he lamented, and it was quite a sight on the<br />
night, he doesn't know what a government has to do to impress<br />
those people out in the bush.<br />
PM: Brian's reaction immediately was as you say. I'm suggesting<br />
to you before you make this assertion now you have a good look at<br />
the figures.<br />
JOURNALIST: You can't afford to have the people in the bush<br />
offside though can you?<br />
PM: Of course you can't and I don't want to have them offside.<br />
We are very concerned with the troubles that are being faced by<br />
very, very many of our Australian rural community. And I have<br />
the Minister, Mr Kerin, coming to us with submissions to Cabinet<br />
to see what extra help we may be able to give.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the real problem that a lot of their problems are<br />
really beyond your control, that they're to do with marketing<br />
overseas and yet you're still expected to deliver the goods?<br />
PM: Well Andrew that's in part right. The international markets<br />
for the products they're selling have been corrupted by the<br />
practices of the European community and now very unfortunately<br />
the United States, in retaliation against those corupting<br />
practices of Europe have brought in their export enhancement<br />
program under which they are mandated to spend some $ 2 billion in<br />
the next three years. And unfortunately unless we can do<br />
something about it Australian producers, the most efficient rural </p>
<p>producers in the world, are going to get another slap behind the<br />
ear as a result of those things. Now there is a limit as you say<br />
rightly to what we can do there but I can assure you I have got<br />
Mr Dawkins who has just been over there coming back. We will<br />
do all we can to impress upon the United States the impropriety<br />
of making Australian producers suffer as a result of their<br />
actions. JOURNALIST: And cross your fingers. But, of course, there is one<br />
thing you can do here and that is drop the price of petrol. The<br />
farmers say that that would save them something like $ 850 a head<br />
in a year. When are you going to bite the bullet on import<br />
parity? PM: My relevant ministers will be meeting on Thursday and they<br />
will be coming up to Cabinet. I will have a Cabinet meeting on<br />
Friday to consider this matter. And all the relevant factors<br />
including the interests of rural Australia will be taken into<br />
account.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is a nasty choice you face, isn't it? Political<br />
credibility or economic credibility?<br />
PM: Well, you shouldn't be in politics if you don't realise that<br />
there are hard decisions to be taken. And I realise that. You<br />
said in the opening of the program we have been in Government for<br />
three years. I think all Australians including rural Australia<br />
will look at that record and share with us the pride in the<br />
achievements there have been. We have had to take hard decisions.<br />
We will be prepared to take them again but I'll certainly be<br />
making decisions with a very considerable degree of consciousness<br />
of the needs of rural Australia, I can assure you.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're in something of a cleft stick on the petrol<br />
one can I put it to you though. You promised to keep the import<br />
parity but you are also, of course, committed to the trilogy and<br />
to tax cuts. Something has got to give surely?<br />
PM: I think you will see that we will manage a decision which<br />
will take into account all the considerations to which you have<br />
referred and which will be consistent with the three years of<br />
sound macro-economic policy decisionmaking that's given this<br />
country the outstanding record of growth that it has got. And the<br />
prospect for 1986 of virtually double the OECD average.<br />
JOURNALIST: Of course, there is one other option and that is to<br />
slash spending. But your Caucus Committee Chairman doesn't seem<br />
to keen on that either?<br />
PM: Now, when we are talking about slashing spending, let's look<br />
at the political realities. The people who currently attempt to<br />
pass for an opposition in this country make some noises about<br />
that. When they were in they had all their noise about the Razor<br />
Gang and they came up with some miserable $ 300 million. Now what<br />
we have done since we came in, we inherited a deficit in prospect<br />
of 5% of GDP. This year that will be down to about Whereas<br />
they were all talk, we have been action. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Yes well I'm wondering if Caucus isn't getting a<br />
little bit restless about that though?<br />
PM: I have the privilege of being in the Caucus. I was in there<br />
again today and I can assure you a very harmonious, constructive,<br />
united Caucus.<br />
JOURNALIST: They haven't had enough of this fiscal restraint. I<br />
mean it's the fourth year in a row.<br />
PM: What they do say they like is the continued endorsement of<br />
the Australian people. I mean afterall if you want to look at<br />
what's happened since we rose in the Parliament at the end of<br />
last year massive endorsement of Labor in South Australia. The<br />
same thing in Western Australia. A very good result in Scullin<br />
and in Tasmania, well we know that they've been out of the<br />
mainstream of Australian politics since 1982/ 83.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's certainly an element of Caucus that is a bit<br />
restless though over the question of land rights. A Caucus sub<br />
committee is meeting tomorrow, as you know, to discuss your<br />
comments during the Western Australian election campaign, now<br />
that that election is over where do you stand on land rights?<br />
PM: Well it's not a question of before an election, during an<br />
election and after an election.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Burke made it clear he couldn't win with<br />
that sort of policy.<br />
PM: Well let me make it clear that on the question of land<br />
rights, Mr Holding, a very, very good Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs will be coming to the Cabinet in the near future with the<br />
policy proposals which will be calculated to take into account<br />
the needs of the Aboriginal people, not only in regard to land<br />
rights might I say because that's not the only issue which<br />
concerns the Aboriginal people, but take into account the<br />
interest of the Aboriginal of the states and of the mining<br />
community and of the agricultural community. We've made it<br />
clear, and I've said this in the Parliament so has Mr Holding,<br />
that we'd like to see a situation where the states would<br />
themselves handle this matter in a way which is consistent with<br />
the broad principles which we think should apply. We believe<br />
we're capable of bringing that situation about. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I suppose one thing you would want to avoid, of<br />
course, would be another rural backlash and that is an issue they<br />
haven't been too keen on the land rights isn't it?<br />
PM: Well, there are some people in the rural area obviously who<br />
have fairly strong feelings on this issue but we have shown our<br />
capacity to talk with the various groups that are involved. And<br />
that is not only rural people but the mining interests, the<br />
Aboriginal people themselves and the states. And those series of<br />
discussions are going on with Mr Holding in charge of them. I<br />
have a great deal of confidence in his capacity to produce a<br />
result which will be appropriate. An appropriate judge by the<br />
criteria of the interests of the Aboriginal people themselves<br />
and, let me say, in terms of the interests of the Aboriginal<br />
people themselves it would be against their interests to have<br />
something imposed which of itself would generate a greater degree<br />
of antipathy and antagonism towards them. So we have got to work<br />
this out in a way which will meet the legitimate concerns of the<br />
Aboriginal people and the legitimate concerns of a range of other<br />
people in this community. we will do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: At least, as you say Mr Hawke, you are prepared to<br />
take notice of the voters. That's something that doesn't seem to<br />
be troubling President Marcos at the moment. I am wondering if<br />
you're very worried about the implications to regional security<br />
of the current events in the Philippines?<br />
PM: Obviously it must be a matter of concern on that score but I<br />
think much more a matter of concern in regard to the internal<br />
affairs of the Philippines itself. And it is clear Andrew, that<br />
those independent observers are saying that the election has<br />
clearly not been a completely fair exercise. It is our hope as a<br />
Government, and I am sure I speak for the overwhelming majority<br />
of Australian people, that this will be resolved in a way which<br />
is going to be able in the future to sustain a democratic process<br />
within the Philippines.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, we have all got our fingers crossed. Mr<br />
Hawke, thank you for your time this evening.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
