    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>This is my 15th year in Parliament, but I am always learning new things about this place.</p>
<p>For example, I was recently told that it would take one painter 16 and a half years to paint the entire building.</p>
<p>Which, if nothing else, gives us a new perspective on Michelangelo's achievement in the Sistine Chapel. </p>
<p>Perhaps just as remarkably, more than 20 million visitors have passed through the House's doors in 25 years.</p>
<p>Australian political giants and foreign dignitaries.</p>
<p>The leader of the world's largest nation  -  Hu Jintao.</p>
<p>The leader of the world's largest Islamic society  -  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.</p>
<p>The Queen of Australia and the Prime Minister of this parliament's distinguished ancestor in Westminster  -  Tony Blair.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers of two of our closest Commonwealth friends  -  Canada's Stephen Harper and New Zealand's John Key.</p>
<p>And all four Presidents of the United States elected since the opening of this place.</p>
<p>Legends of radio, television and the Parliamentary press gallery have walked these corridors. </p>
<p>Spiritual leaders and business tycoons.</p>
<p>Community groups and protest movements whose causes span the ideological spectrum. </p>
<p>Millions of excited schoolchildren and their patient teachers.</p>
<p>Australian tourists and international visitors.</p>
<p>People drawn by the striking lines of this building and itslight-filled design.</p>
<p>The warmth of its Australian timbers. The beauty of its magnificent art collection. </p>
<p>People who have come to see our democracy in action.</p>
<p>Both the cut and thrust of Question Time and the unifying spirit of great bipartisan moments.  </p>
<p>People who come to have their voices heard, see their argument made.</p>
<p>To receive a nation's thanks. Or its apology.  </p>
<p>And I think it is not too much to hope that these visitors leave inspired.</p>
<p>Not just by the place Australians have built.</p>
<p>But the country, the civic pride and the democratic system that this building represents. </p>
<p>Today though, we are here to honour those who made this place possible:</p>
<p>Its visionary architect Romaldo Giurgola, who unfortunately can't be with us today.</p>
<p>And the men and women who brought that vision to fruition; taking an empty hilltop and turning into our nation's foremost public building.</p>
<p>We also celebrate the thousands of people who come to this house every working day.</p>
<p>There is a group that is not employed by the Parliament but which makes this place both their home and their subject-matter (for good or ill): the press gallery, who have the opportunity to render such a vital service to our democracy.</p>
<p>There are the cleaners who maintain the 9.6km of corridors and the guides who make visitors feel so welcome within these halls.</p>
<p>The electricians who make sure the 40,000 lights go on.</p>
<p>The gardeners who care for the 13 hectares of grounds and mow the sloping lawns that children just love to roll down.</p>
<p>The editors who produce the 19,600 pages of Hansard each year.</p>
<p>The tabling office and chamber staff who have overseen the passage of more than 4,200 bills.</p>
<p>The parliamentary librarians who have fielded more than 680,000 enquiries.</p>
<p>The chefs, waiters and baristas who have prepared and served hundreds of thousands of meals and millions of cups of coffee.</p>
<p>The security guards, plumbers, printers, switchboard operators, fitness trainers, nurses and IT staff.</p>
<p>All of you who do your jobs so well and with such quiet efficiency that you sometimes miss out on the recognition you deserve.</p>
<p>In a place often associated with prima donnas and limelight, you are backstage making sure that the show goes on.</p>
<p>More than 70 of you have been here from day one, a distinction you share with just four of my Parliamentary colleagues.</p>
<p>There is no better illustration of the apolitical dedication that so many of you bring to your daily work.</p>
<p>And no better reminder that the smooth running of this building is something we should never take for granted. </p>
<p>So on behalf of all Australians I pay tribute to Aldo and to all who created this building, and I thank all those who through their hard work, patience and good-humour give it life every day.</p>
<p>Through their love of freedom, generations of Australians have built a great democracy.</p>
<p>You have given that democracy a fine and worthy home.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation, I simply say: “thank you”. </p>
