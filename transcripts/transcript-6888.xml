LlA6HINCGTONs D. C.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKEt Ladies and sntlemen3 I will m~ ake really<br />
a very brief, btatemeint~ l and then be available for any ' quest ions that<br />
you would want to address to me.<br />
I went to say thmit our visit to Washington? 1 believe) keg been<br />
in achlevirs the primary objective of that visit; which<br />
has bean to put befor the President) the administration and the<br />
Congress the concerns jof Australia with regard to developments in<br />
international trade Ir agricultural products. I've sought to convey<br />
in t?% ose quarters the fact of the importance to Australia of what<br />
happens in this aree. 1 have indicated thet Australia is heavily<br />
dependent on whallt happenS in international trade and Agriculture.<br />
Some 40 percent of our export income is derived in that area. We<br />
export 60 percenit Of Our agricultural production.<br />
And my mission kilos basically been in two parts, firstlyi to<br />
seek from the admini strat ion, and others to whom I've spoken an<br />
assurance of sympethe&amp;--Ic consideration a+ Australia's interests; 1 tie<br />
implementation ot relieant aspects 0+ the + arn legislation in this<br />
country. I've pointed Out that It would be improper it Australia, an<br />
elficiant igr'culturat producer, which is a non-subsidi2or of<br />
exports, should be adversely affected by tke implementation of<br />
programs in this coun~ ry; and secondly, and in a lonser term sense<br />
more importantlyp I h va urged upon the President and others to wh~ om<br />
I've spoken) the need i or the United States to take the lead in<br />
ensuring that the question o4 international trade in agricutural<br />
goods should be put at tine foreiront of the agenda% of the relevamt<br />
international fore in forth-coming months.<br />
I've asked firstly that at the Tokyo summit that the President<br />
should % at that this matter is on the agenda; but most importantlys<br />
that as the now MTN r9und begins later this year, that the, United<br />
States should seek to ensure that the question of international trade<br />
In agricultural Produ~ ts is on the agenda; it is not some side issue;<br />
it is one of tundamental importance. I've assured the President that<br />
it the United States takes that lead that Austral ia will be standing<br />
shoulder-to-shoulder wilth them in svpporting that Position..<br />
I. P. 14 </p>
<p>RPR. 18 ' 86 17: 52 AUSTRLIAN' DIPLOMATIC NETWORK ~ 334/ 2.<br />
Ican say that I have received a very sympathetic consideration<br />
to0 theae submissionj tl % t I h'" avt put at all love;* at which I have<br />
) gad the opportunity o 11 speaking. I will again express my gratitude<br />
to 0the administrations and also my thanks to our embassy h and the<br />
ambassador for the sx ulient prog3ram that has been' arranged which<br />
has enabled wso I think, 4advance the interests of Australia.<br />
Ot course) we have spoken about otheor matters. But that has<br />
been thet prime Purpo5s o'T my visits andi L believe<br />
it has been successful. Now I am open to questions.<br />
Q Mr. HawkvblIcani we take a looI ahot thheassuranie5 mean to<br />
the average termer in Australia? 7 It we take wheat, which is anea<br />
our main con~ cerns; the m~ rket price CoU~. B down to S. 0&amp;<br />
whwat, which means a $ 0 Percent drop in the price ot wheat to the<br />
Australian firmer. News I guest he's not going to be too happy about<br />
that, o thgr II it no aSSurance there. The other side of the<br />
tiino -1 tkatw I suppoSe the U. S. tarsetS the EEC i the EEC i S go Ing to<br />
move into ALJstral Iar markets. So i+ the United States don't got wss<br />
the&amp; EEC willI So whoro are the assurance* from the Australiani<br />
farmers point of view' 4<br />
PRIME MINISIEI% HAWKE, Well, obviously# thmrs has already been<br />
an impact as for as price is concerned in the perilad in which you<br />
could have said that the export enhanceme0nt Program might have had<br />
some impact. There his beam a 15 percomtsea $ 20 a ton<br />
decline in wheat prices but we acknowledge that that has already<br />
occurred. What we art' trying to do is to seek to ensure that the<br />
criteria that have bein rkteULd Ito last year 4&amp; being operative<br />
sh~ ould continue to aI.~ Ftlthat as far as possible the<br />
operation of the Progrjam can be targeted away from Australian markets<br />
and secondly) that Wh~ ra the program Is applied that the United<br />
States should seek to got assurances trom those acquiring wheat from<br />
the United States under that Prog3ram) an undertaking that they would<br />
not diminish their purchases from Austraiia. Now we are realistic<br />
enough to know that ycqu can't have an absolute dividing line which<br />
says that here on 0hij side there is going to be markets in which<br />
there are no Australi'an interests. In the other ones in which there<br />
are. There will be aldesire of overlapping. All I can say is that I<br />
and those with me beloeve that we have now established a framework<br />
for continuing consultation in which thoe United States will continue<br />
to listen to what we've got to say and attempt to take into account<br />
Cur interests. Q Prime Minitert do the 8assraondes Siven to you an<br />
agriculture go any lurther than the assurances given to trade<br />
mmii* ter John Dawk inrs when he was here in Washington.<br />
PRIME MIN19TER HAWKE: TU. bu ilId upon them and I hers take the<br />
opportunity ot doing what I did before I left Australia and that Is </p>

to Pay tribute to the lark that was done by John Dawk ins. W~ e now<br />
have a more eixtensiveijit YOU Ilk*, Penetration at the point of view<br />
of Austrliap right up to the level of the<br />
President. I ' we had the opportunity at speaking notmeroly with the<br />
administration oat+ icialls but also with &amp; IlI the relevant leaders an<br />
the Haill. So, what I '. vs dome is~ bul Id upon thne work done by th<br />
Trade Minister and I bel ieve add tolitin an uffective way. I roo* atp<br />
pay tr ibute to the foundat ioni work that was done by HI M.<br />
Q On the question of Libyaj will the initiative in the<br />
United Natis% be turned I nto a f ormal1 roe1lwtion'? Have you had any<br />
i nd icatI Oo 4T'om t'ie Un Ited States or from Libya itsoif?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWJKE, The question ot what will be done with 4<br />
contribution at the Australian delegate Is still a matter of<br />
d iscussionm by Mr iWco tt All that I Ivc. had conveyed to me at th is<br />
stage i s that the--I 6riderstand ' that the Secretary GeneralI and the<br />
Pres ident a+ the Caumi i I have expressed a Pazsit ive Ott itude towards<br />
the broad suvivestionsithat we have made. 1 can't say that there's<br />
been a positive response from Libya) who 1 understand took the f loor<br />
yesterday to critlcite the Australian intervention. 0Of course) as<br />
far as the United States Is concerned) as I saldi the inidicatiom of<br />
Article 51 of t0, v Chat~ ter of the U. nited Nations) Its@ 14 Carries with<br />

And i t i s my beI &amp; 1 from the d iscus i ons that I Ive had P and<br />

that I w ill givea comlni tmenmt and adher e tzi suclh a : amm itment not<br />
to resort to the tactics and the process of terror ism. There was a<br />
question here first off.<br />
Q I asked if you were hoping or expect ing more + ram the<br />
talks conicerning trada.<br />
PR~ IME MINISTER HAWKE, Not I think the outcome broadly matches<br />
our expectations, Beather. What we've reallI y had to do is to be<br />
certain in our minds ithat we have created the framework now fori<br />
tirst of-all, a very clear understanding of the nature ot<br />
AuStralia'S actual and potential vulnerability in the implementation<br />
of the farm programi. I think, as I say building an Mr. Dawkins'<br />
Visit.) I have done that, </p>
<p>PPR. 18 ' 86 17: 54 AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATIC NETWORK P. 17<br />
Secondly, and look ine to tht tuturO, which is the mast Important<br />
consideration, I've trjied to create a better international framework.<br />
am cartoon that Ino -Nave the wholehearted cooperation of the<br />
Uniteadt s am nstation in giving essiential priority in the<br />
mew MTN round to agriculJtu~ ral matters. I could not Have expected a<br />
more enthusiastic response from all to wham I spoke on the basic<br />
necessity of having thlat up at-t-h forefront. Wie can'tj as an<br />
international trading community'Tatford the luxury of previous<br />
roundst where agricult, kre Has been regarded as a side lauoi shuttled<br />
at+ into Salle oix no~. j J and allowing people to talk about it as<br />
a sidesHow. it's cenitrally important. I think we've achieved that<br />
Q Canada hens imiltar concerns about the export enhancement<br />
program. I'm wonderirl it there's any way that Australia and Canada<br />
might join torces it, expressingo or putting pressurat Porhsal on<br />
the adm in istrati on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER H-1KEt Well) I had cause last year to Haye<br />
scme diocussions with ' th-e Conadians whom I was there very bristly:<br />
and we have mutual con~ cern for what Happens Here. We certainly Have<br />
a mutual concern as to the operations a+ the European program because<br />
that affected us in Cjnada witk regard to our Potential beef sales<br />
there. So I think th re is a substantially common position between<br />
us. I would expectp from the background to which 1 refer and which<br />
I've been involved ari which Me. Dawkins has boom inivolved in<br />
discussions with His 9ounterparti that we would not only Have common<br />
ground in regard to the position here; so most importantlyi I tHink<br />
common ground In the soarts of positions we would take in the MTN<br />
nescotiations, which commences in September at this year.<br />
0 Will there be future talks with Canada?<br />
PRIME MINISTER H WKE' We Save a framework of relationships<br />
there which involve Cpntimw. itne consultations. Imean it hasn't been<br />
formal ized in a procesl of every six mcnths. But the relationship<br />
between us at the leviql of prime minister to prime minister and trade<br />
minister to trade minister is a very productive omes I believe.<br />
0 President Reagan used some interesting emphasis In his<br />
statements earlier about ANZUS. I wonder if he has given you any<br />
indication at what he plans to do nexto or how the talks are going<br />
New Zealand? Just hoi T angry is he with Now Zealand'?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I thiink to be fair) not only to the<br />
Presidento but to the wh-ole of the United States administration<br />
that's been involved in thiss </p>

0,9 react Ion woulld not be teir lY tYPit 10d as One Of anger. 1<br />
say that not because I'mi here In the capital P but I have been<br />
involved in discussicr1 son this tcir a long period. I think the<br />
appr or iate do er 1pt Iofn Is one aof sever 0 dIsapoo int mont, I don't<br />
th ink gr, tie ev idance , ct t ime that anyone coulId siggest tl,% re ' s<br />
certainly. no evidence to supporti'that the Unitoo States has imposed<br />
great Pressuro ujpon New Zealand and pressed tor a differnnt<br />
resolution. Timi discussion have been Spread out ever a long period<br />
of timne and there has bviciusiy been I beitevaea sincare wis) e On<br />
the part 0+ the United 6tates' administration to secure a clhange of<br />
view on the part of Niw Zealand,<br />
Nowp I thinik time is running out in terms of Now Zealand's own<br />
timetable. As far as we can understandii Now Zosiand wOiA A iM<br />
to leg islIat 1on by the per Iod of August'j Septemberi Octoberii 1+ tW<br />
latest. Now the p09ei in that we hove 1 that no roeIlut ion by<br />
way of discussion can be arrived at, and Now 2ieaiand embodies into<br />
legiation the position Which it's been espousing) tin I have<br />
repeated again today to tee President what we have said Privately and<br />
Publicly before, and that to these tiings: Firstly, and most<br />
importantly# that we ' would mot wish the United States to take action<br />
to abrogate the treaty. We. believe thei treaty ssould be left In<br />
pisto. that in tmat event there would be an interchange 0f<br />
letters between the President and myself, the Puroose of which would<br />
at to establish by that correspondence the intention on tihe part o+<br />
the United States and Now Zealand to continue in cperations as<br />
between ourselvess tl~ at is tl e United States anid Australia, the<br />
provisions of the triaty. And that would lead to the position then,<br />
thirdlyj that it at somein luturr stage New Zealand~ ;. ishedl to come back<br />
into the operstionofthe treaty', that would be thnere. lt5houaj add, I<br />
think in fairnesis both to Australia and to the Un. ited S of<br />
relevance to Now Zealaria, ti', at in all points in tne discussion we<br />
have made it clear ario the United States 6as accepted it as<br />
reasonable and sensible; that in the event of that situation<br />
emergings we) Australia, would maintain a bilateral defense<br />
cooperative rolaticn " eip with New Zealand. 1hat is in our initereot<br />
in the region, anid in that sense in the interest of tie United States<br />
as well. Did the Pconcur with your suggestion? </p>
<p>,-pPR. 1 e86.18: oo AUSTRfLIPN DIPLOMATIC NETWORK P. 02<br />
6.<br />
Pm': Yes there is acceptance as I seeiat of that position,<br />
JOURNALIST,. Couli you be a little more specific about the feedback from<br />
Americans you hava~ spoken to about the Australian proposal In th. UN<br />
and would you cairs to covinent on acute Caucus reaction that I think has come in the<br />
losr 24 hours. to your statement on Libya?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAW.. KE: Lot me take the secornd part t Irst. I've<br />
found it a senuible rule in my intrequent overseas visits to note trom<br />
abroad comment upon what 1 happeninmg I m AustralI Ia. There Is a very<br />
simp Ie wellI one of. the reasons P 19 ot the excI usi1ve reason)<br />
yaw are mot always certain that you know Precisely what boom said<br />
and the circumotances , of it being saido so I am not going to break<br />
that rwle which I've iound a useful anid sensible one to + or.<br />
coming to the first part of the Qu. est ion. I repeat what<br />
1 said before that the discussions theat 11ve had with the<br />
administration) privately, reflect what we've said publicly, andI<br />
would not think it appropriate to say that the United States was<br />
saying that the concePit that we out about the position of the United<br />
Nations were ones that they were putting. Nevertheless, it is my<br />
impression clearly that they do not regard the United States does<br />
not regard the proposals that we have put as inconsistent with the<br />
position thnat they've, adopted, And I kave no reason at all to<br />
believe that thu United States would not welcome a position whore the<br />
avenues nominated within Clhaptsr 61 particularly article 33 of the<br />
chartirs could be used. If in fact any, one of those avenues could<br />
lead to a positioni where this situation could be peacefully resolved<br />
and certainly the United States would welcome % hats as wouldi all<br />
reasonable People.<br />
0 Prime Min'istar, do You bAiive the American r a id on L Ibye<br />

PRIME MIJN15TER HAWKE, I've been around tis Some for a very)<br />
very long timeh and I am not going to be led into a position of<br />
satisfying or attempting to satisfy someone else's use of language. 1<br />
have the capacity te~ put quite clearly my position and the position<br />
of my government. I've done that In three ways. Before I left<br />
Austral ia) just some hours5 before I left., in a statement to<br />
the Parliament. I've done It through our representative In th, 1<br />
United Nations and I've done It In private conversation with the<br />
United States administration In a way which completely reflect* what<br />
I have said Publicly. Now yoirSvarlous interpretations of that<br />
position. For instance) the representative of Libya saw fit to<br />
attack the statement by the representative at Australia. On the<br />
other hend, the leader of the oppositions at least that's what he was<br />
when I was there I don't know whether there has<br />
been any change in the past Couple ot days but he attacked the<br />
statement that I made. So you have difterent perspectives seeking to<br />
put a particular interpretation. Now people can put the<br />
interpretation that they will. Those worcis are clear. They were<br />
clear In the Parliaiiiient) </p>
<p>AiPR. 18 ' t6 01 AUSTPAL. LqN pLr1TCNTOKP. 03<br />
clear in the United Nat Ionse And that is that we Have $ aid that we<br />
regret that th19 cirlcumstances have arisen where torte has been wood.<br />
We have said that thee9ssential condition far bringin'g this position<br />
to an and Is that Libylae has got to bring to an ernd its direction<br />
and export 04 and can~ ra I of terrori 1sm, and i n tHose r. I rcw. Matences,<br />
at course, which we hope could be advanced by the processes that we<br />
put, there would by am elimination of torts in all respects.<br />
Now we could havo, it we'd wanted to) in the United Nations, 411111111<br />
what appeared to oithers to be all that WOO necessary to exhaust their<br />
responsibility tha isj to get up GAattack and cast aspersions.<br />
We Have the percepti'on of our respons ibilIity whicih goe$ beyond<br />
that, and that is to look to thne jutur* and too what possible<br />
mea~ ures may be available to bring an end to a situation WhIch is not<br />
only tragic for those who may be immediately involved; but which<br />
potentially could constitute a danger for the rest o4 the world.<br />
Now with a sense of responsibilIity, we Have made such<br />
suggesticin%. Now th-ai's the respornuibia way to undertake both-your<br />
analysis and your memb~ ership of tHe Security Council. And I'm not<br />
going to be diverted 4rom the exercise of that responsibili ty by some<br />
cheap arid I don't Pefer that to you and your question but lome<br />
cheap attempt to say) "' Do you describe that by thls word or that<br />
word?" We depend upon a full analysis of what w&amp; giI said in the<br />
parI Iament what &amp; WX'I sa id Inm the United Nat Ions P wh ich as I say. hase<br />
been reflected completely in the discussions I've Had Here in the<br />
United States. 0 On the matter of agr I u Iture, t 1 $" t%&amp; nt900"<br />
b-Jloaicl: against the concepts of subsidization,<br />
Everybody's concerned. abo j. Hat's happening in the EEC and the huge<br />
subsii I ~ even thoush thV'f'oin rate May come downri, 2.40 4e(% aft / QJ4<br />
111.36S, di+ irence between the ) man rate and the target rate.<br />
There's still a massive subsid~ going to the United States farmer<br />

direct or indirecti 5uch, as through% t4. Sanspart mr groin-handlins O, 1AWiAM. WS<br />
or perheps even some 4cirm C34 acreage restriction?<br />
PRIME MINISTER H' 4WKE: As a concept in Australia) you mean?<br />
" A1Just go firstly to our perception of what happens herep and then come<br />
back to what our reaction should be. We've made it quite clear that<br />
we object % o tk&amp; concept Of subsidization in the larser producing<br />
areas of the European Community and here, 111 far as the United States<br />
is concernedi as to vloat part of their programs whlch% are directed<br />
toward some + arm of rietal-latlai agaimst the European Communitys we<br />
say we. can understand; that sort of reaction. But what's </p>
<p>Zz. ANI<br />
_ PPR. IS ' Q8Z 18e: 02 AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMAnTIC NETWORK P0<br />
tundameritally imPOrtart is that the United States and tlhe Community<br />
h4ave got to underst nda that there must be an emu to this concept of<br />
subsidy agaimst subsiiy-taxpayer against taxpayer. In the ends by<br />
dlefinition, that is djisastrous, for the Communities involved and the<br />
rest of us % hA&amp; rL in the international t-adimg regimes. And sai we are<br />
saying to theOAUnited fitates as we will be saying when we go to<br />
Brussels that there's got to be a total re-think of the way in Which<br />
governmonts relate thelmselves to their agricultwral Sectors.<br />
Now) coming back to the second part of your questioni we Have<br />
before we came here) ) ust before we came Here, in fact a matter of<br />
an hour or so before elofts had the situation where my minister<br />
for primary indwStr-yiMp. Kerins produced in the parliment two<br />
things, one very largo Sbo. t* Aof equivalent to a whito paper it yaw<br />
like. And secondly a parlimontary statement encapsulating the<br />
essence of that Ppal.. And we had within that approach sou&amp; 3kt to<br />
direct Ourselves to UflyS in wkich ' Some forms o+ legitimate assistance<br />
can be provided. It's a rather smnall Package. And the sort% of<br />
t~ 5t-hat Jpirj'e LjOn? Iwhat y1, u wL-! e ta) ik-Ing aboute 9or instance,<br />
we've suggested a,' offissi9on Into % v'&amp; rA marketing haridling charges.<br />
Ibnd it does appear thgt a fairly signiticant cost is being imposed<br />
upon Austral ian produgers in that area. And we think something can<br />
be done there. We've looked ate6b4E elements wkich may help to reduce<br />
the cost burden on + armors whi04 is an, appropriate and legitimate way<br />
of going about this.<br />
Buts In the end, what we have said, not merely to our own rural<br />
constituency) but whit we're saying to the United States and what<br />
I'll nBM~ 4 5b* e5sy , nW hat I'll be Saying to Mirs. ThatcHer, to<br />
Prime Ministers Craxi and Papandreou, is this; if the world<br />
continues with thls concept of subsidizing, heavily subsidizing<br />
rural producers and partictilarly Heavily subsidizing exports as a<br />
result of internal overproduction, then, that Is the road to<br />
disaster. Ando what I'm wanting to sets particularlyo when I go to<br />
Europap into th'e minds of the Europeans) is as I've put it the<br />
conjunction of interests that exist.. That i5, Our interest as<br />
an efficient producer, agriculture Producer) and theirs, that th 9<br />
enormous subsidization which is involved vir J$ trOvj,<br />
is signlifcatly against thefir Interests. The sort of figures % hat<br />
are involved ore massive. The budgetary subsidy for agriculture in<br />
% he last year is $ 27 billiont and that includes $ 9 billion tar export<br />
subsidy. Now ti-at i5 , ust the budgetary cost. The cast by way ot<br />
transfer from consu. mers in very' very High prices is estimated to be<br />
double that.<br />
Now that means that the level of economic growth in the </p>
<p>APR. 1e ' 86 18: 04 AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATIC NETWORK<br />
community is significantly loe than it otherwise would have been.<br />
1It is estimated that ' omqthlng like one-snd-a-4, el+ million more<br />
people could be employed in the European commiunty it those practices<br />
weren't followed. So what we lIv! ultimately it; t to got is not to<br />
try and Play a same against one anatkarliii4tHis subsidy against that<br />
subaidys as I say. taxpayer againit that taxpayer. We won't win<br />
like that. 0 ; Sure SOPIP y'o. are Successfu. l. Were You disappointao int<br />
Mr. McLaughl in describing your package as a % ad arid disappointing<br />
document. PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, Let me any this, I would have been<br />
surprised if Mr. McLa'u ghIinm hasn't said anythiing elso. He Is an<br />
awro-Politician, perh'aps in both, senses of the word " agro."<br />
O Can I go back to Libya again?<br />
PRIME MINISTER H AWKE, Well, yes. I'm + luid in those matters.<br />
Q In the lig'ht of the Libyan criticism in the United Nations<br />
yesterday iMiSGCA40mc fr A does it concern you n4 440# 4<br />
Australia mighebb.. tarrset for terrorist activity'?<br />
PRIME MINiSTER NAWKE' It would always concern me if Australia<br />
or Australians within our country or abroad were to become a target<br />
for action. This did not preclude us in January from responding<br />
positively to a call by the United States to its friends around the<br />
world, ar4 countries around the rest of the world to take some sort<br />
a+ actions against L* I~ bya. In January o1 this year in response to<br />
that suggestion from the United Stateso we did these things.<br />
Firstly) we reduced the level af representation in the Libyan<br />
embass~ y. And secondlys we responded positively to the request that vhemi<br />
the United States was then saying ' t would withdraw assistance of<br />
U. S. nationals In Libya In the oil figldsi tH at we should not fll<br />
that gapi and we responded positively in that way. Now we believe<br />
that that wag the right th-Ing to doi and we were not intimidated in<br />
taking what we thought was the rimlht decision through some perception<br />
that we would so incqr the wrath oi Libya and perhaps pu~ t ourselves<br />
at riisk.<br />
It seems to me the world I-, a got to understand that it It behaves In<br />
that way and allows Itself to be intimidatedi it's not a very tenable<br />
world In which we're going to live.<br />

PRIME MINISTER HAWKE% PYRIeE aMh~ i. T ERiHA'UEl: Il come bar. k to you.-</p>
<p>PPR. 18 ' 836 18: 05 AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMA~ TIC NETWORK P. 06<br />
Ln the ls-couple of' days; there has been a rebal tour<br />
of Now Zealand rugby players errivying in Soutlh Africa to play a<br />
seIas of games . thor I F ir stlIy what i s the Austr aIi an at t itude<br />
toward it? Would Australis, under its pol icy on sports C* fcP. 1 4<br />
ban those players from representing thiNew<br />
Zealand nationai team at any future games they may be cal led Upon to<br />
play in Australia'?<br />
* PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, Weil, lot me first a+ all-say that we<br />
share the view of Mr. Lange that the action of those players is to be<br />
total ly regrettC'd And iUt stuestiamnwhich I'm not entitlfed to<br />
express a legal opinion, but it's a Cquet Ion ot whether) in fact)<br />
by that subterfuge theyv mlyd hyhv in fact broken the<br />
letter as wellI as the spirit of the low which was brought down by the<br />
court in New Zealand in regard to the All-Blacks' proposed tour*. So<br />
we deplore the decision of those involved to undertake that tour)<br />
because we would say that whatever view one may have had when they<br />
were talking about their All-Blacks tour# surely thu evidence which<br />
ka. accumulated s ince ' that t Ime of what 1s happeni ng I n South Afr ice<br />
should have led them to the conclusion that it was improper to be<br />
giving aid and comfort to a regime under which Increasing numbers of<br />
people are being killed,<br />
So it's qwite clear what our position is) and under the,<br />
provisions of Green Eagles) the situation would be that we would not<br />
be within Australia playing against people who are im that category.<br />
Now I hope thatj if+ I can broaden my answer Just br ieflIY,; I woulId<br />
hope that as a result 04 what we are doing within tke Lommonweelth,<br />
a d it t e sstance which, I believe we will receive from t e<br />
United States, I hope that there will be a positive response from the<br />
government of Southn Africa to the proposals that have been put to i t<br />
by 0, r Eminent Persons Group, which Proposals provide the basis<br />
for the beginnings of dialogue. And what's got to happen is that<br />
th-rough, those processes 0? clalosuei we can begin the processes of<br />
change peacefully in s outh Africa<br />
because the " iernat~'" I believe is frightful t otmlt n<br />
dnb' eiee tatwI have a Icing timescaie within which thte<br />
processes of dialogue will be available.<br />
Q HwMk. e in our t~ e~ t from the white House today<br />

accept that violance. J'is a Solution t ope rbeso h ol<br />

PRMIMI ISTR HWK~ i Well# it is an embracing statement. I<br />
tl , nkj however) if yow look at the Statement that I made in ' 0h1<br />
Parliament and the sttement Herei the emphases are clearly Placed.<br />
I don~' t tinik there i~ any doubt about whire those emphases are. We<br />
don) t want t0o se6 tor e used iin any way) And we gay both i n Canber rg<br />
and here that thy resntial condition of removing force from thle<br />
% cone is a commitmen~ t by Libya to refrain trom the resort to<br />
terrorismn. 0 JuJst + 01llowing On~ from John's question) given the view<br />
that violence is not a solution to the Complex Problems of the worlIds<br />
did you urge Presid ent Reagah to revise his previously expressed<br />
view that America Stands ready to repeat 044-k-if the situation<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: AS IMosid 1 think twice here my private<br />
converSationsg with the President reflected what we've soid Publicly#<br />
And that i s that we be I eve that th, best resources ol all o+ us<br />
should be used to settle these matters in the way which we Suggested<br />
in our contribution in the Security Council.<br />
O2 &amp; A1% I yowr talks Save you called for the Publication of the<br />
evidence -ibye as yaw said you hoped to?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, Yes) I put to tHe Presidenit and others tc<br />
whom I spoke % he view that havin% town the evidence myself, and which<br />
f ind compelling and I say I'ves seen evidence in Australia and<br />
I'vehadadditional evidence made available to me since I've been<br />
here Ibel ieve that it would be in the best interest ot the United<br />
the UieSttswatodo. I wouldn't presumetoelthmwa<br />
to do. That is a viei~ that I have. I recognize the very<br />
considerable cowrittr-gons iderat ions that are in thy minds ot thit<br />
President and those who advise his and I don't think it needs MUCS<br />
imagination to understand what those counter-comsiderations are. bu~ t<br />
I speak from the position of , aiviri9 seen the evidence and tindins it<br />
compelling and feelin~ that It would be useful if the world could guy<br />
it. But I accept that that must be a decision wliich% the United<br />

must do.<br />

PRIME MINISTER HAWKEI Well, the President, and Q4* c-t wO-N<br />
I Spkt retorred to tihe counter-conslderat ions. Trhy are intelligent<br />
people. I guess th ' u nderotand the strMgh of the reasoning that<br />
I've puts but they ulitimately are the ones wo've got to make the<br />
judgments about the integrity of thutr intelligence Operation. And<br />
; t would be preaumptuul for someone who hasn't got the<br />
responsibility for tlleir intelligence operation to presume to make<br />
the judgment 40r' tenq. All I con do from my point of view is to say<br />
what I one as the adiantaese.<br />
Q Is that evidence so compelling that/ it was<br />
worth soint Publico co you believe that other countries would support<br />
the United States' *; tion?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, Well; let me Say this, as a very least<br />
I believe that the evIdence or made available would destroy at<br />
one stroke the statements of those who seek to cast doubt upon the<br />
crediblity t! the United State* when they ro~ orred to the<br />
exIstece of such evidence.<br />
Q Mr. Hawkei is the evidence to which you refer the<br />
electronic interceptsi?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, Oh now aorrr c'n.<br />
Q uelI, what is the evidence then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE; Wells when you're shown something in<br />
total confidence wit~ the highest intelligence rating you wowld even<br />
exceed the bounds o+ f optimism ot some of my press gallery friends If<br />
you thought 1 was going to break that confIdence. 1 notice they<br />
don't ask the questlqn. All I can say is that it lsin my judiment,<br />
authentic and It is in my judgment compelling.<br />
a Was it evidence related to the specific justification for<br />
the strikeback that was made M ^ nclA<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE; 1 have evidence that has been provided to<br />
me, most specifically in regard to the West Berlin Incident# but very<br />
importantly evidence which goes beyond that to projected propDoals<br />
for a range of attacl~ s into the future as well as may I say some<br />
other recent aborted attacks planned.<br />
Q Do you feel you've made any progress on the South Pacific<br />
nuclar free Zone trebtyl </p>
<p>P. 0<br />
RPR. 18 18: 13 AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMARTIC NETWORK P0<br />
PRIME MINISTER H WKE, Yesi I think we are better placed now<br />
than we were. The op ortunity has been Provided 0+ putting the case<br />
at allI levels now to thip President Secretary Wieinberger and I did<br />
that lolt week in Can , erra and to poopl o@ n the Hi Ii who have an<br />
interest in tkese matters. My Judgment is, Michelle, that tkgp# is<br />
no doubt now in their minds that the operation at the treaty and<br />
therefores the adherence to the protocols by the United States w~ culd<br />
in no way diminish or endanger the operation 0+ our treaty<br />
relationsihips irder ANZUG. I have no doubt that that is clearly and<br />
without question in the minds of our friends here,<br />
Now, that does not mean that thnere may not 6@ some Other<br />
considerations thatil*' would feel that4I went to take into account.<br />
But<br />
the point that i've just made I think is now clear beyond question in<br />
their minds, and I can only express the hope that in the result they<br />
will feel able to becoame adherents to the Protocols.<br />
Q A senior admInistration official who briefed after your<br />
talks with President ' Reagan said the U. S. Interpreted your<br />
statements on the I-lby~ pIssue as OuPPOrting US action? Are You happy<br />
with that interpretatipm?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, This is another approach to the<br />
question that Has been raised In thrae or four different ways<br />
already. I could I 5uppose just ask You to turn Your tape&amp; back to<br />
* the answers I Have already given. What I'm about, I repeat3 is to Put<br />
thle Position at the goveOrnment I've done that in Canberra,<br />
we've Had it done in N w York and I've rapflected privateily what we've<br />
* said Publicly. I've Indicated that there are numbers of<br />
interpretations a% to how Libya or spokesmen I'm not going to<br />
enter into the business of saying Yuueti wriyuueta<br />
word." I'm about positively trying to deal with this situation.<br />
We've done that. I'm not 9oing to be diverted by saying, " Whick word<br />
do YOU Wart to attaCh-? A<br />
Q Australia se I fically referred in its UN statement to<br />
Libyan terrorism and vialence. WHY didn't You refer to the United<br />
* States actions specifirjallyI<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKL: Ueli, it is not correct to say that we<br />
w. didn't refer to the action of the United States, because we said in<br />
the Parliament and it Was reflected in the statement in the United<br />
* Nations that we counseled restraint and we doepiy regret the conflict<br />
has taken place and urgyes both sides to restrain hostilities and<br />
engage in general ettorits to bring about the Peaceful resolution of<br />
their differences. That's what I said in Canberra and the United<br />
* Nations * language rtflefcts that so I don't think it 1i, correct to say<br />
that reference wasn't Mnade to action on both sides. but what those<br />
Statements did make cig~ ar in both Canberra and in Now Yark is that<br />
the essential condition for the creation of an end to this </p>
<p>APR. 18 ' 86 18: 14 AUSTRA~ LIAN DIPLOMA~ TIC NETWORK P0<br />
conflict is the commitment by Libya to ceast its terrorist action.<br />
This Is not ju 6t that, it acknowledges terrorism at an appropriate<br />
instrument. The evidence is, as 1 sayo compelling that they arm<br />
diracting and controlling and 2xporting terrorism. And until that<br />
ceases) you are not going to have tka condition for an end to this<br />
cam# I i ct<br />
0 Did you discuss with the President or any of the Other<br />
People you visited orl the Hill the differences that Australia has<br />
with the administratilon, on the fu. nding ot the Contras in Nicaragua'?<br />
PRIME MI NISTER; HjAWlKE% There was an Acknowledgement. It didn't<br />
take up a great deal of our time) because we had so many other<br />
matters to talk about. But thuro was an -acknowledgement of the<br />
difference of position that we hanve in regard to Central America. it<br />
took up ver-y little 0, f our time.<br />
O Mr. Hawke, do you expect to got1~ support for your<br />
position on L~ bya'?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, On?<br />
O 1' rt position you have put to the administration on the<br />
Libyan attack.<br />
PRIME MINISTER IJAWKE: W~ ell) let me say this) as I've said<br />
I've lost count Of how many times I've said it here that the<br />
position that we'Ve piut privately in our discussions with the<br />
administration r of Ieclts what we have put in the Parliament and in the<br />
United Nations. And I Iunderstandi and I'm not going to so back on<br />
what I said b f r. I'm not commentIng in any detail on what<br />
hpesback in Auostra4li a while I'm away but I understand that on<br />
th, morning after I lieft that in the continued Caucus meetings which<br />
had been acheduled at any rate# tkat Sill Hayden gave* a report to tke<br />
caucus on our position# and that that report# as I understand, wasn<br />
accepted by the caucus at least there was no attemtpt to depart<br />
from the report tkat Mr. Hayden gave. And we have boom In constant<br />
communications he* reign minister and myselfs since I left. And<br />
the presentation tHat; we've made at the United Nationsi and the<br />
inclusion of the paragraph in my departure statement Iheret represents<br />
the coincidence of position between the foreign minister and myself.<br />
0 Mr. Prime Ministers the US administration is interpreting<br />
publicly PRIME MINISTER HAWKE-Bes Your pardon'? P-03 </p>
<p>APR. 18 ' 86 18: 15 AUSTRAiLIA~ N DIPLOMATIC NETWORK P. 04<br />
0k ThUS admi niStration is interpretin2 Publicly that you<br />
are supporting their attack on Libya. That 19 tiuir : nterpretation,<br />
not a journalistic iriterpretation. Are you mappy with that<br />
nterpretation? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I repeat what I've said befoire, and<br />
don't know<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE,' Now, wait a minute. Lot me at least<br />
repeat what I've 5aid bvfore, before you ask me to repeat it &amp; aan, OV<br />
not to repeat it again. And that is that it's q~ uite clear that<br />
people will give particaular emphasis to particular parts ot our<br />
statement. What we've tried to do Is to address ourselves to the<br />
issue in a way which ref lects a proper judgment of the circumstances<br />
which save rise to this action<br />
And) that statement both in the parliment and again in New York in<br />
the Security Council does say that the essential condition for the<br />
bringing to an end of i conflict is the adoption of a Position by<br />
Libya which esckews resort to terrorism. Now, that's what we said<br />
about where it h* hic and we've addressed ourselves to the future.<br />
And we will continue within the United Nations to do what we can to<br />
try and positively bring about a situation where this sort of<br />
conflict does not arise again. That's the major thing that we should<br />
be concerned about) not only Australia but we believe everyone that's<br />
nvol ved. 0 Mr. Hawke, I an we go back to the issue of agriculture just<br />
for a little moment--<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, Well, I've got nothing--<br />
o going around and round and round in circles--<br />
PRIME MINiSTER HAW4KE-Well I'm net laoint around and around in<br />
circles. I must say th Iat agriculture interests me much more.<br />
O Yeah, well,-' it interests me, too.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HA WKE, Yeah, I noticed. ( Laughter)<br />
a Nobody wants a prIce-cutting war. And it would appear<br />
that Amer icans are hell-bent on getting back the market that<br />
they Ive Ios~ eAkhey havilIso got a very sizable bud-get to make<br />
sure thevy do get their mnarkets back) and it would appear that there<br />
oa price war inevit~ ble except as you mention that there's a<br />
possibility of trade negotiations. Nowi what's the<br />
likelihood from the discussions you've had that there will be trade<br />
negotiations before a price war'? And if a price war Is lnevitabiei </p>
<p>PPR. 18 ' 86 18: 17 AUSTRA~ LIAN1 DIPLOMATIC NETWORK e16<br />
how lon~ g is it igoing to go on before wt Got sanity return?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWJKEt Well, I don't think it's inevitable.<br />
Right at this moment) I think, in Paris I think tkey're meeting; it<br />
may be Bruisevis. Mr. &amp; utter. arid Mr. Lyrig are soins to be discussing<br />
with the Europeans tHe ' immediate di++ icu! ties in regard to the action<br />
whicho hag been taken by the community as a resuit of the accession by<br />
Spain and Portugal talthe Common Market and at lipast-that'g Ye'utter<br />
and Lyins and Anderson (: fork* are sitting down arid trying to<br />
work their way tkrou9h this. 1 don't think we have to be totally<br />
pessimistic Q# J lQ! that this trade war ia In all respects inevitable.<br />
All we can do with-ti,, relatively limited clout and status that we<br />
Have vis-a-vis Europir, and the United States it to point to the<br />
ultimately self-defeating nature of recourse is that position.<br />
There's nothing more we can do. We haven't got the resources to<br />
stand up there and play that game arid we don't intend to.<br />
0 Mr. Prime Ministers jusltaking your answer to Peter<br />
Lo ue'hl1st quesion) does this mean that you will not publicly<br />
refute the US interpretation of your position.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE, It means th-at I am not going to got up<br />
and deal with everyone's interpretation of my positions whether It's<br />
a spokesman for the adMinistratlonM Whether it's Libya, whether it's<br />
Mr. Howard. I used tlke phrase just as I departed at the airport in<br />
Canberra that I'm not'soing -to lot into tHisi+ tPfarte I think I used Is.<br />
." squallid auction", arid I regard it asgsquailid auction to oay,<br />
M" iere are you on some scale of support'?" 1 used it In regard to the<br />
leader Woteoppositi-on. I regard it as a totally squallid auction<br />
that tHepapposition should be getting up and 5ayingo " I'm more<br />
supportive. You're less supportlve of someone or ather.' It<br />
reflects no credit onipeople who want to got into that<br />
auction. I'm not getiAns into it. I Have enoush faithi in the<br />
integrity of my foreign minister and myself as prime minister who<br />
Have formulated the p61' tion ci' the Australian government to allow<br />
those statements to stand on their own.<br />
What we're about is the tuture. That's what everyone should be<br />
about. How are wes as men and women of good wiil lacging to try and<br />
usje our resources to bring about a situation where we won't Have a<br />
recurrence of this pa~ ition" f That's what I'm about. And you can ask<br />
all the questions you like and Have your own attempts to create an<br />
