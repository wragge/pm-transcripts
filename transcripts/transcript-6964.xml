TRANSCRIPT OF 11.00 AM 30 JUNE 1986<br />
PM: It was a remarkable achievement by any standards not just to<br />
found a new party in Australia but to bring it to a situation<br />
where it has such considerable power. it does hold the balance of<br />
power in Australian politics. And without any question it is Don<br />
Chipp that has done that. No one else.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you think the Democrats will fare without Don<br />
Chipp? PM: it will be a much harder job for them. it is obviously<br />
impossible to quantify these things Paul, but the appeal of the<br />
Democrats has been very much the appeal of Don Chipp.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should there be a future role for Don Chipp in<br />
Australian public life?<br />
PM: I would be quite certain that there is some place for him<br />
yes. JOURNALIST: So we haven't seen the last of him yet?<br />
PM: I don't think so.<br />
