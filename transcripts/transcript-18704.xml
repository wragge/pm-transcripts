Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the Federal Government would provide $14 million for the $25 million replacement of Big McPhee Bridge on the Great Northern Highway in partnership with the Western Australian Government.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Kununurra Chamber of Commerce and Industry today, the Prime Minister said the new bridge would make road freight transport more reliable for local mining and agricultural industries.</p>
<p>Big McPhee Bridge is located on the only sealed road between Kununurra and Broome, making it a critical and economically significant piece of infrastructure.</p>
<p>When it was forced to close in March 2011 after sustaining significant structural damage during the Kimberley floods, it caused major disruptions to local mining and agricultural operations.</p>
<p>The new bridge will replace the existing 55 metre long single lane-bridge with a new 108 metre long dual-lane bridge that is 2.5 metres higher, reducing the need for it to close during the flood season.</p>
<p>In the past, the bridge has had to close for an average three days every two years, with the longest recorded closure being 21 days - a real blowout for reliable freight transport.</p>
<p>Construction of the Big McPhee Bridge will be completed in the current dry season.</p>
<p>As part of the Government's Nation Building Program, $3.7 billion has been provided to upgrade and modernise Western Australia's road, rail and public transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>This financial year alone we're providing $1 billion.</p>
<p>Today's announcement takes the Government's total investment in upgrading and maintaining the Great Northern Highway to $239 million. </p>
