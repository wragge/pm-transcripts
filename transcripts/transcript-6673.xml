CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NUNAWADING BY-ELECTION OPENING<br />
21 JULY 1985<br />
FOR MEDIA<br />
The people of Victoria have made two very significant decisions<br />
over the last eight months. On the 1st of December last year, they<br />
returned the Federal Labor Government in Canberra to a second term<br />
of office. Then, on the 2nd of March less than five months ago<br />
they gave a similar vote of approval to the Cain Government in<br />
Victoria. The reasons for both decisions were simple. In both electioRs, the<br />
people of Victoria were responding to the record of achievement of<br />
both Governments during their first terms of office.<br />
During those periods, Australians ' and Victorians witnessed a<br />
remarkable turn-around in their country's and their own economic<br />
fortunes. And since the polls, the recovery has continued and in<br />
many respects strengthened.<br />
It is due in no small measure' to the fact that the Federal Labor<br />
Government our own Government and the Cain Government of<br />
Victoria have co-operated and co-ordinated their social and<br />
economic policies. This partnership helped to produce a truly<br />
stunning economic recovery which has benefited all the people of<br />
Australia, but especially Victorians.<br />
It has transformed the social and economic atmosphere in this<br />
country and in this State. It has turned bleakness and despair<br />
into brightness and optimism. It has created a future in place of<br />
a sorry past. And it is providing a new security for Australians<br />
where previously there was a lingering threat to their livelihoods<br />
and a gradual erosion of their standards of living.<br />
It is this great partnership between our government in Canberra<br />
and the Cain Government in Victoria which has produced such a<br />
radical change of fortunes for all of us.<br />
our joint achievements stand in stark contrast with the hollow </p>
<p>posturing of the Opposition parties. They have a history of<br />
destructive tactics. They are naturally negative. Their constant,<br />
carping negativism is no substitute for government.<br />
It would be a tragedy if this negativism was to hinder the<br />
success we have all achieved together. It would be tragic if the<br />
partnership between the Federal Government and the Cain Government<br />
in Victoria, which has proved so successful in turning Australia's<br />
and Victoria's economies around, was not to continue.<br />
It is unfortunate that the preoccupations of recent weeks have<br />
obscured the momentous improvements in the lives and prospects of<br />
Australians and Victorians under our two Labor governments.<br />
We must not forget the things that really matter to Australians<br />
security of incomes and employment, freedom from unnecessary<br />
industrial disruption, moderate inflation, fairness in the<br />
provision that is made for the needy, and all the things that<br />
affect the daily lives of our people.<br />
We must not forget that economic growth is the key to improvements<br />
in the living standards of ordinary Australians.<br />
And we must not forget that under 2 Labor governments, growth has<br />
returned to Australia and Victoria after nearly a decade of<br />
stagnation.<br />
The financial year that ended last year was the second successive<br />
year of 5 per cent growth in Australia's non-farm economy.<br />
In the 7 lean years of coalition rule there was not a single year<br />
of 5 per cent growth. And all the signs are that strong growth<br />
will continue. Strong gro ' wth in private consumption and investment<br />
look like making 1985-86 the third year in a row of 5, per cent<br />
growth. This strong growth has created over 380,000 new jobs in Australia<br />
in the 2 years and 2 months since the National Economic Summit<br />
Conference. This is 40,000 more new jobs than were created in over<br />
7 long years of coalition rule.<br />
These new jobs have absorbed the new participants in the labour<br />
force while reducing unemployment from 10.3 per cent in April 1983<br />
to 8.7 per cent last month. And of all the states of Australia,<br />
Victoria has done best. Victoria's unemployment rate is now down<br />
to 7.1 per cent.<br />
Inflation and industrial disruption in Victoria and Australia as a<br />
whole are dramatically lower than a few years ago.<br />
Victorians know what this economic recovery means in practical<br />
terms. In Victoria, motor vehicle registrations in the 3 months to<br />
May this year were 17.5 per cent higher than the corresponding<br />
period a year ago even stronger growth than the 12.5 per cent </p>
<p>for Australia as a whole.<br />
In Victoria, approvals for new home construction have risen 19 per<br />
cent in the year to the March quarter, compared with a national<br />
growth of 1 per cent.<br />
In Victoria, capital investment increased by 11 per cent in the<br />
year to December last year, compared with the national figure of 3<br />
per cent.<br />
These statistics tell an important story.<br />
The choice before you in Nunawading is a clear one. It is a<br />
choice between a party which at the Federal and State levels has<br />
brought about strong growth in output and employment and reduced<br />
inflation, and a coalition which can only promise a return to the<br />
economic and social chaos of the early 1980s, overlaid with their<br />
obsessive ideological trappings.<br />
The Liberals meeting in Canberra last week highlighted the rift in<br />
the Party leadership and between the Party leader and the Party<br />
president. They showed that they really stand for nothing. All<br />
they can do is carp and complain and posture on empty policies<br />
which have no relevance to Australia's economic well being.<br />
The last week has given us valuable insights into what would lie<br />
ahead if the conservatives came to power again. In the last few<br />
days, the Opposition Leader has targetted<br />
TAA, the Australian National Line,<br />
AUSSAT the authority administering Australia's domestic satellite<br />
the Health Insurance Commission which runs Medibank,<br />
the Australian Industry Development Corporation,<br />
the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation,<br />
the Commonwealth Bank and<br />
the Pipeline Authority.<br />
All these are in danger of the sell-off.<br />
The efficient delivery of government services many of which only<br />
government can provide will be sacrificed on the altar of<br />
ideological expedience.<br />
The Liberals ignore entirely the social costs necessarily absorbed<br />
by our public corporations. They would embark on an<br />
indi scriminate attack on a whole range of services generally<br />
regarded as basic to the quality of Australian life. The Chairman<br />
of the Liberals' social welfare and health committee, Mr Ian<br />
Wilson, last week was actually calling for the privatisation of<br />
health and hospitals, schools and universities, as well as income<br />
security and welfare.<br />
This is the logic of his leader's approach it is the logic of a </p>
<p>blinkered, insensitive, totally inappropriate ideological<br />
obsession. All the conservatives really want is to sell off the profitable<br />
areas of government activity, which contribute to public revenue,<br />
leaving even heavier burdens on taxpayers to pick up the slack to<br />
keep essential government services operating.<br />
Picking and choosing in this way is hardly the hallmark of a<br />
socially responsible Government. Considerations of efficiency and<br />
social equity would be jettisoned by those obsessed with<br />
profitability. Social and economic conscience has no place in the<br />
calculations of the Liberals' ideological purists.<br />
What the Liberals are on about is a one-off fire sale, a Sale of<br />
the Century, of your assets the assets of the people of<br />
Australia. They would transfer them into the hands of a<br />
privileged few, to the cost of every one of us. No regard will be<br />
had to the social costs involved.<br />
Let me take the example of the Commonwealth Bank which is one of<br />
our great Australian institutions. It has been built up over<br />
generations by big investors with their corporate accounts and<br />
small investors with their life's savings. Thousands have bought<br />
their homes through the Bank and have mortgages with it.<br />
The Commonwealth Bank does not belong just to any government or to<br />
any particular generation. It belonged to the previous<br />
generations of Australians who started it and built it up. It was<br />
bequeathed to the current generation. And it will be left to<br />
future generations.<br />
It should not be the plaything of a government which is devoid of<br />
practical and substantive ideas for providing the essential<br />
services which the people of Australia need.<br />
Make no mistake. The conservative parties threaten the<br />
continuation of services provided by government across a whole<br />
spectrum of essential activities.<br />
As Senator Peter Walsh, the Minister for Finance, has said<br />
elsewhere, the conservatives see about 25 per cent as the ideal<br />
level of Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of GDP. If suddenly<br />
we had 1.5 per cent unemployment the level of the 1960s and<br />
early 1970s instead of today's level, outlays would fall to<br />
about 27 per cent of GDP without any policy changes at all.<br />
If we assume that public debt cannot be repudiated and it cannot<br />
then to reduce the 1984-85 budget outlays to about 25 per cent<br />
of GDP would have required 2 per cent cuts in spending on defence,<br />
social security, health, education and general purpose payments to<br />
the states, which absorb 74 per cent of outlays.<br />
It would mean cancelling payments for all other Commonwealth<br />
functions, which would mean no payments to industry, the arts, </p>
<p>transport, or foreign aid, and closing down the ABC, the CSIRO,<br />
the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Tasmanian Railways and<br />
this list is not exhaustive.<br />
And it would mean abolishing almost all the Commonwealth<br />
administrative framework, including the Taxation Office and the<br />
Department of Finance. There would then be nobody to collect or<br />
pay public money. Government would be replaced by anarchy.<br />
This is no answer to Australia's problems.<br />
The Liberals passed a resolution at their Council in Canberra a<br />
place which I might say is currently gripped by the same wintry<br />
chills which blight the Liberals' social and economic conscience<br />
they passed a resolution decreeing that a Coalition government<br />
would cut 3 billion dollars off the deficit in each of its first 2<br />
years. We have cut the deficit from a prospective 9.6 billion dollars to<br />
6.75 billion dollars in two years. That is a big cut. But it is<br />
as dramatic a cut as the economy could bear without severe<br />
dislocative social and economic effects.<br />
The Conservatives would have you believe that it is a simple task<br />
to cut out spending and to get rid of some of the great Australian<br />
institutions which provide valuable and essential services to the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
It is not simple. It is difficult and complex and it is fraught<br />
with dangers. It would threaten the security of many, many<br />
Australians. For all their rhetoric, the conservative parties of this country<br />
have in government done economic harm to our families to the aged<br />
and to youth. In government they wrought havoc on all these<br />
groups through the unemployment and inflation generated by their<br />
economic and social policies. Now they are promising nothing<br />
different, other than to further reduce funding in ways that will<br />
hurt these groups. There could be no clearer contrast between<br />
that and what the Labor Party stands for for what John Cain and<br />
the Victorian Government stand for.<br />
In government, at the Federal level, the coalition parties<br />
presided over a situation where, in their last 5 years, teenage<br />
employment fell by 19 per cent. Now their only policy response to<br />
the tragedy tha. they created is to suggest that youth wages<br />
should be cut.<br />
The-Federal Government is now close to finalising an approach to<br />
youth policy which in an integrated way will achieve these<br />
objectives. It will ensure that the benefits of strong growth in<br />
Australia and the especially strong growth in Victoria over the<br />
last 2 years are passed on to our young people, and that they can<br />
contribute to future growth with some pride in their efforts.<br />
In the labour market we have already made a start. We have<br />
achieved a reduction in teenage unemployment of 19 per cent. But<br />
the Government is now looking at the far more compr'Ihensive gains </p>
<p>that can be achieved by a combination of further improvements in<br />
participation rates in secondary and tertiary education, and the<br />
introduction of a traineeship program.<br />
I stand by my previous remarks on this subject as a statement of<br />
an objective which should be integral to what any Labor Government<br />
is seeking to achieve, as well as being clearly in the best<br />
interests of our country.<br />
And it is an objective the Government has good reason to believe<br />
can be achieved by the early 1990s. It is an issue which received<br />
close attention from the recent Quality of Education Committee<br />
headed by Professor Peter Karmel. The Committee reported that<br />
and I quote:<br />
" Increased retention to the completion of secondary school<br />
and the flow on to tertiary institutions can be expected,<br />
under the Committee's scenario, to increase the number of<br />
teenagers in full-time education by about one third. This,<br />
together with the additional 75,000 trainees recommended by<br />
the Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs, could<br />
bring youth unemployment down to a level comparable with that<br />
of the 1960s, while full-time job opportunities for the young<br />
continue their downward trend."<br />
I might add that there are some signs that over the past 2 years<br />
we have been doing better than is required to meet the projections<br />
of the Karmel Report. In contrast with the huge fall in teenage<br />
Jobs in the years before we took office, teenage employment has<br />
increased significantly since mid-1983.<br />
The challenge for us all is to transform the present situation<br />
into one in which every one of our young people can look to the<br />
future with some optimism and hope about being able to enjoy<br />
satisfying and productive employment.<br />
This is not a task which we in Canberra can do on our own. It<br />
requires close co-operation with the states. It is essential that<br />
each of the states has comprehensive and forward looking policies<br />
in place to complement our own.<br />
And this provides us with another great example of how the Federal<br />
and State Governments are together transforming the future for<br />
Victorians.<br />
Nowhere is this partnership between the Cain Government and the<br />
Federal Government's more evident than in our joint commitment to<br />
transform the future for our young people. The Cain Government<br />
has already given you its Youth Guarantee. The Federal Government<br />
will ensure that that guarantee is supported and complemented in<br />
our own youth policy.<br />
It is this partnership which is at risk on the 17th of August.<br />
The Cain Government needs Nunawading because it needs the solid<br />
support of the Victorian Upper House in ensuring that it can carry<br />
out its program unfettered by the Conservative forces of<br />
negativism and confrontation.<br />
We all need Nunawading because we need the Cain Governm~ ent. </p>
