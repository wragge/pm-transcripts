PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING OFFICIAL LUNCH,<br />
CYPRUS, 26 JANUARY 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
I'am a nrember of the Commonwealth Committee of Cyprus.<br />
t. L4Commonwealth Action Group.....<br />
6NA. And which way this Action Group is working to happier days.<br />
Well it has had three meetings since its formation, and the view<br />
that it has taken and I think understood by our friends is that<br />
it would keep a monitoring role upon the discussions and processes<br />
under the aegis of the United Natio's-. Secretary-General. If at<br />
some point it would appear/ f latot her role, then that would<br />
be considered but I think that its understood at this stage that<br />
the appropriate process, but I would think that at our meeting<br />
in October President Klprianouwould be reporting to the<br />
Commonwealth what had transpired at that time and the Commonwealth<br />
would have considered at that stage in October this year<br />
consider if there was any other avenue open to it as<br />
Commonwealth. What is the secret/ o te rek iEpriot in the / 6<br />

What the secret? Well I can only really speak of the period--<br />
since 1983 as to why they are happy now and that is because<br />
good government is being provided which 40 read a significant<br />
economic recovery which they have participated but I may add too<br />
to that point, but I think the secret of the success, if not merely<br />
the happiness and the capacity of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to<br />
live together but more broadly the-capacity of people from scores<br />
Of different countries to L. ive---tog-e-theristhat-the. r-e<br />
gratitude on the part of Australians as what we describe as a<br />
" fair go", thats an Australian expression, fair go and stripped of<br />
all the academic jargon that might be developed by sociologists<br />
around that point, I think it simply means that every person<br />
irrespective of sex, religion, ethnic origin ought to have the<br />
opportunity in freedom to develop his or her capacity to the full.<br />
That's the attitude of Australians, and we try to make that work<br />
as perfectly as we can and wit hin that framework that people<br />
of different backgrounds are able to live peacefully together<br />
beyond<br />
and perhaps in that way that has some lessons fts. the shores of<br />
Australia. Q. What are you expecting from your mission in the . Middle East?<br />
Hawke: Oh, just let me repeat what I've said before, _ we haven't<br />
come toAtiddle East crossing ourselves as* mediators, as people<br />
with any especial expertise but rather we are coming as a-country<br />
which I think is in good standing with the countries that we<br />
are visiting: Jordan, Israel and Egypt a country which has a<br />
concern, not only about the tragedy or potential tragedy of a<br />
conflict in that region, but also as a country which has strong<br />
ties bilaterally, a country who hab a large part of export / 17 </p>
<p>trade<br />
and import/ passes through the region, a large part of his<br />
communication passes through the region, so I've come<br />
essentially to have a listen, be informed of the perspectives<br />
of the leadership of the countries in question and I've simply<br />
said if there's any way at all which Australia may be able to be<br />
of assistance then of course we would be available but I had not<br />
in any sense meant, to exaggerate arole for Australia.<br />
Q. What does your country think of the International Conference<br />
in Cyprus?.<br />
Hawke: Well the President has put the view to us that that could<br />
be an appropriate course of action we have said that at this<br />
stage we see the office of the Secretary-General as being<br />
appropriate to pursue the issue that has not precluded at some<br />
stage the possibility of such a conference, but it seems at this<br />
stage that the issues dividing the party is so complex that an<br />
amount of work remains to be done, but it could be that at some<br />
stage the appropriate course of action again in the end these<br />
matters will only be dissolved if there is the will on the part<br />
of the immediate parties concerned, and I would simply like to say<br />
that as a result of the meeting that I have had today with the<br />
President I have absolutely no doubt about the will, and the<br />
commitment and the integrity of the President and his Government<br />
to effect a solution. </p>
