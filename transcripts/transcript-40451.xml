    <content><![CDATA[<p>Jane Halton AO PSM has advised me that she wishes to tender her resignation as Secretary of the Department of Finance with effect from 14 October 2016.  </p>
<p>Ms Halton was first appointed as a Secretary in 2002 and she led the Department of Health for 12 years before being appointed to the Department of Finance in 2014.  She has had a long and distinguished career at the highest levels of the Australian Public Service, being the longest serving Secretary of the Department of Health and the first woman appointed to head a Commonwealth Central Agency.</p>
<p>Ms Halton has made an enormous contribution in public life both nationally and internationally and has been a leader for women in the public sector.</p>
<p>I thank her for her service and have no doubt that she will continue to contribute to the nation.  I wish her all the very best for the future.</p>
