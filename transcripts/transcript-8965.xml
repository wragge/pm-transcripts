THE WHITE HOUSE<br />
Office of the Press Secretary<br />
For Immediate Release September 14, 1993<br />
PMSS CONrrRENCE BY THE PRESIDENT<br />
AND PRIME MINISTER KZATING OF AUSTRALIA<br />
The East Room<br />
3: 11 P. M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. It's a great pleasure<br />
for me to welcome the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Keating, to<br />
Washington and to have this opportunity to make a couple or<br />
statements and then answer some of your questions.<br />
Despite the vast ocean which separates us, Australia and<br />
the United States share essential values and interests rooted in our<br />
frontier heritages, our shared commitment to democracy, our status as<br />
Pacific trading nations, and our efforts across the years to ensure<br />
and strengthen our common security.<br />
It's a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to<br />
personally reaffirm those bonds today.<br />
The Prime Minister and I exchanged views on a wide<br />
variety of issues, I'd like to emphasize the importance of one in<br />
particular the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations,<br />
We agreed that strengthening GATT's trade rules is a top priority for<br />
both our countries. As a founder-of the cairns Group of free trading<br />
agricultural nations, Australia Is working closely with us to bring<br />
the Uruguay Round to conclusion this year.<br />
So that we can achieve agreement this year, the Prime<br />
Minister and I strongly urge the European Community not to reopen the<br />
Olair House Accord on alricultural trade as has been suggested. We<br />
need to move forward not backward, to complete the Round and to give<br />
the world economy a much-needed boost.<br />
We also discussed the importance of economic relations<br />
in the new pacific Comunity that both our nations are committed to<br />
help build. We discussed the building blocks of that Community;<br />
bilateral alliances, such as the one we share; an active commitment<br />
to supporting the spread of democracy and support for open and<br />
expanded markets. We discussed the important role of the organization for<br />
the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC. Both the U. S. and<br />
Australia are members, Both of us have been active proponents of<br />
regional trade liberalization. And I look very much forward to<br />
working with Prime Minister Keating to make the November APEC<br />
ministerial meeting and the leaders conference in Seattle,<br />
Washington, a big success.<br />
Australia and the United States also share mutual<br />
security interests. Australia has been our ally in every sar<br />
cOnflict of this century. Today we share an interest in bolstering<br />
the regions security and in supporting its movement towards<br />
democracy. I expressed my particular admiration for the crucial role<br />
Australia has played in fashioning and implementing the international<br />
effort to promote reconciliation in Cambodia. I told the Prize<br />
TEL 15. Sep. 93 12: 08 NoO009 P. O1/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL<br />
Minister that we look forward to many similar partnerships In the<br />
years ahead.-This seeting vas to have occurred yesterday, but Prime<br />
Minister and i agreed that we should delay it because of the signing<br />
of the Israeli-. Palestinian Peace Agreement. That historic<br />
breakthrough reminds us that we live in a momentous time when the old<br />
walls of division are falling and new vistas are opening. Our<br />
success in seizing thee* opportunities will depend on large seasure<br />
on how well the community of democracies can respond to work together<br />
to~ wards shared goals. Today this xestin? with the Prime Minister<br />
reaffirms that our two nations will continue to work together closely<br />
to turn the promise of this era Into reality.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINIS79R XEATING: Thank you, Mr. President.<br />
Well, I'd like to say firsthand that our meeting was most worthvhile<br />
from my point of view and Australia's point of view, for the quality<br />
of our discussion&amp; and our close agreement on1 a wide range of Issues<br />
I think demonstrates the vitality and the relevance of the Australiarelationship<br />
at a time of great change internationally. Let me<br />
say, I'm very favorably impressed by the vigor and imagination with<br />
which the President and his team are addressing the now challenges we<br />
now face in the world.<br />
Australia is a country which puts great importance on<br />
it. relationship with the United States. Our longstanding friendahip<br />
which the President has just referred to, is based on shared values<br />
of democracy and freedom and, as he remarked, we fought in rive major<br />
conflicts together over the courae of this century. Arid in the post-<br />
Cold War period, I'm happy to say that our alliance remains very<br />
strong, indeed. In commerce and diplomacy we do a great deal<br />
together. I was impressed In our discussions today by the priority<br />
which now attaches to fundamental questions of international trade<br />
structures. I welcome the strong support that President Clinton has<br />
Siven to APEC as ant organization for promoting trade and investment<br />
n the Asia-Pacific area. I congratulated hiz on his truly historic<br />
initiative of inviting other APEC leaders to join him at an informal<br />
meeting in Seattle thisB November. This will allow APEC leaders to<br />
discuss ways of moving towards an Asia-Pacific Community which brings<br />
benefits of closer economic integration to all members. This step<br />
also recognizes the increased importance of the Asia Pacific in world<br />
affairs. We agreed on the importance of achieving a successful<br />
and balanced outcome of the Uruguay Round by the mid-Decembezr<br />
deadline. No other joint action by governments this year could do<br />
more to boost the prospects of world growth and jobs, both subjects<br />
which the President and I are intensely interested.<br />
We agreed that any move by the turopean Community to<br />
reopen the Blair Mouse Accord on agriculture seriously risks<br />
jeopardizing the whole Uruguay Round. The Blair Hfouse Accord already<br />
represents a mintimum outcome acceptable to those countries seeking to<br />
establish fair rules of trade for agriculture.<br />
Finally, I should like to thank the President for his<br />
gracious hospitality and to congratulate him on the leadership he is<br />
showing on the United States international arnd domestic agendas.<br />
Mr. President, thank you very much for having us in the<br />
White House from Australia. And we appreciated the arrangements#<br />
particular the difficulties of the the opportunitv tlre~ ented by<br />
T1EL5:. Sep. 93 12: 08 No. 009 P. 02/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL 3-<br />
THE PRESIDINT1 Terry, I'd like to call on you first,<br />
and then if we could, I'd like to alternate between one question from<br />
an American jourrnalist and one question from an Australian<br />
journalist. So we'll have to go on the honor system, although I<br />
think most of the Australians are here, on the right.<br />
Okay, Terry, go ahead.<br />
Q Mr. President, you said today that you don't want<br />
to personalibe the NAPTA fight, but I'd like to ask you about remarks<br />
Made today In this room by Presidents Carter and Bush. They both<br />
spoke about demagoguery in NAM, and President Carter spoke about a<br />
demagogue with unlimited finaincial resources, obviously Mr. Perot.<br />
Do you think that Mr. Perot is playing loose and fair with the facts?<br />
THE PRE SIDENqT; Well, I'm going to reiterate what I said<br />
before. I don't want to I am for this agreement because I think<br />
it will create more jobs. I think anyone who wants to enter the<br />
debate Should do so. I think we should be very Careful if we make<br />
-that if we make an assertion that we know that it has some factual<br />
basis. And if any of us make a mistake we ought to say so.<br />
You know, my office has already put out a statement<br />
because I inadvertently made a factual error today not a big one,<br />
but it was an error, and we corrected it. And I just thinic that the<br />
people of this country and of most of the wealthier countries in the<br />
world4 have seen such enormous pressure on the middle class our<br />
folks have really been hurt that they want this to be an open<br />
debate. * But we don't need to prey on their fears# we need to really<br />
work through all the various arguments and the issues and the facts.<br />
And then I'm going to do my beat to do that and I'll be glad to<br />
argue, debate or discuss with anyone who has a different opinion.<br />
out I think, as President, I should take the position that I'm going<br />
to try to bring this country along with this and leave that other<br />
business to others to fight.<br />
someone from Australia yes?<br />
Q mr. Clinton, could you comment on Australian<br />
concerns that the U. S. push on human rights in countries such as<br />
China and Indonesia could threaten Asia-Pacific economic cooperation?<br />
Could Mr. Keating also comment on that? And, Kr. President, could<br />
you also flush out eXactly what you want to see coning out of the<br />
leaders summit in Seattle in November?<br />
TME PRESIDENT: Lest me mention, first of all, the United<br />
states does have a very strong position on human rights, and I think<br />
we should. I also think your government has a good position on human<br />
rights$ which it has not been reluctant to express in dealing with<br />
other nations. But that has not undermined our relationships,<br />
commercial relationships and political relationships with-countries<br />
that we think are makfilg an honest effort to shoot straight with us<br />
and to work with us.<br />
You mentioned Indonesia. I went out of my way to ask<br />
President Boeharto to come to Japan and meet with as when I was<br />
there because he's-the head of the nonaligned nations. Indonesia, I<br />
think, is one of the most underestivated countries in the world.<br />
Xoot pea ple have no idea how big it Is, that IS0 million people live<br />
there, that it is a vast, enormous potential partner in a global<br />
economy. We have questions abo* ut the issues or East Timor, as you<br />
kLnow, and I think yo do, too your country does, too. But we have<br />
had good contact with Indonesia. With regard to China, the United<br />
T1EL5:. Sep. 93 12: 08 NO. 009 P. 03/ 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Sep. 93 12: 08 No. 009 P. 04/ 08<br />
4<br />
Chinese economic revival. We have very strong commercial<br />
relationships with them.<br />
But it is our responsibility in the world in which we<br />
live, I think, to try to restrain the proliferation of weapons of<br />
Iass destruction, to try to stand up for human rights, and to try to<br />
engage the Chinese across a whole broad range of issues, so that we<br />
can't simply have a cooreoe-only relationship.<br />
I an going to do what I can to build the Pacific<br />
community and not to undermine it, and that's what your Prime<br />
Minister spoke so eloquently about today.<br />
I think you wanted him to oment on this, too.<br />
PRIHN XINIST R KZATING; Neither the United States nor<br />
Australia will ever compromise its shared sense of democracy, its<br />
commitment to human rights and the respect of human values. And we<br />
put them forthrightly wherever we see those values under threat or<br />
seeking to be compromised. And this is trus in Australia's case with<br />
Indonesia. It's been true in respect ot China, as has been the case<br />
with the United States.<br />
But I thinX It's true for at and I'm certain for the<br />
President that we sea these issues as part of a total relationship<br />
where we seek to have an influence on these countries and where the<br />
influence may be diminished if the totality of the relationship only<br />
involves the human rights questions, and beyond that* that Is on<br />
these other issues like proliferation and other issues and commercial<br />
questions, where the relationship aust be seen in it* totality.<br />
Q Mr. President, a day after the historic signing<br />
ceremony here on the South Lawn yesterday, the Israelis appear to be<br />
establishing a relationship with MorOco, a formal relationship, and<br />
there is this agreement between Israel and Jordan. What specifically<br />
are you doing now to try to promote the establishment ot formal<br />
diplomatic relations between Israel and other Arab nations Saudi<br />
Arabia, Kuwait good friends of the United States? And do you<br />
thinX that is in the cards in the immediate future?<br />
Th pIsDI$ Well, let me first may that I am very,<br />
very pleased that Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Mister Peres<br />
have been reoeivelt by Xing Hassan in Morocco. When we learned of<br />
this development yesterday, and we talked about it in some detail<br />
Prize Minister Rabin and I talked about it I was very pleased,<br />
because I think the Xing may have set an example, which I hope other<br />
Arab states will consider following now to try to continue just to<br />
establish dialogue. We are at this moment focusing on three or four aspects<br />
of what we can do to implement this relationship. One is, what about<br />
all the practical problems that are still out there. You know,<br />
elections have to be held. There are a lot of other economic<br />
endeavors have to be undertaXen in the Gaza and there areo lots of<br />
things that just have tp be done practically. So we have a team now<br />
looking at all these practical probleme to see What can the United<br />
States do to facilitate this.<br />
The second thing we're doing is looking at what we can<br />
do to try to organixe an appropriate level of in Ae_ ent. And in<br />
that regard, we're looking primarily at maybe having a donors meeting<br />
and trying to bring in the interested turopean countries and Asian<br />
countries and Arab countries to talk about how we can put together<br />
the kind of package we ought to have.<br />
Yesterday, I met with a couple of hundred Anerican<br />
Jewish and Arab leaders from around the country and I asked them to<br />
participate from the point of view and private sector and<br />
B s9 </p>
<p>TEL 5<br />
partnerships and helping to develops these areas so we could really<br />
move this relationship forward.<br />
And then the third thing that we're going to do is to<br />
discuss on a political level what we should do to try to facilitate<br />
further political contacts. The announcement between Israel and<br />
Jordan today is very helpful. And I hope that will give further<br />
enoouragement to other Arab countries.<br />
Is there another yes?<br />
Q Mr. President, you made a very eloquent appeal Cor<br />
support for your NATA proposals today, asking for the middle class<br />
to understand what it could provide in jobs for your HAFTA<br />
initiative. Yet you're still providing massive subsidies<br />
billion a year in the agricultural sector. when are we going to see<br />
some change in that? Because that is hurting free traders like<br />
Australia. T) a P&amp; RESIDENT I'm sorry, I didn't hear change in<br />
what? g Your agricultural subsidies, particularly the<br />
Export Znhancerent Program.<br />
THE RZESzDzNTt well, perhaps the Prime Minister would<br />
like to comment on this, too, but what we are trying to do with the<br />
Export Enhancement Program is to have it run, if you will, only<br />
against or in competition with countries that have done things that<br />
we believe constitute unfair trade by governmental action. That is<br />
we intend to do what we can to avoid using the program in ways that<br />
undermine Australia's interests. And we're going to work very hard<br />
on that because Australia basically iS a free trading country in<br />
agriculture. And in a larger sense, if we could get a new GATT<br />
a" reement that includes agriculture, that would be of enormous<br />
benefit to Australia, to the entire Cairns Group, and to the whole<br />
principle of reducing subsidies in agricultural trade and opening up<br />
more competition. So I think if you will ust watch the way that thing Is<br />
applied, that program over the next year, you will see that we are<br />
going out of our way not to have it conflict with the trade targets<br />
and interests of Australia, which is a country that does practice<br />
what it preaches in terms of tree trade and agriculture.<br />
Q Mr. President, what is your estimate now of how<br />
many jobs would be lost net jobs lost under the North American<br />
Yree Trade Agreement? And what can you better describe your<br />
proposal for reemployment? Is it job training, are they subsidies?<br />
What kind of proposal ThE PRESIDENT: First of all, we are convinced our<br />
administration is convinced that net mor* e jobs will be gained than<br />
lost. If we didn't think that we wouldn't be pushing it. but we<br />
know that some jobs will be lost. Now many will be lost really<br />
depends upon things that are almost impossible to calculate. Let me<br />
Just give you one example. We know right now that certain<br />
a rioultural seqtors will be helped and others over a period of time<br />
will lose some of their tariff protections in America over a period<br />
of several years. We know right now that certain manufacturing<br />
sectors, particularly high-end manufacturing sectors higher wage,<br />
more sophisticated manufacturing will be helped. Other manufacturing<br />
will be subjeot to more competition and fewer import limits.<br />

<p>TEL: 15. Sep. 93 12: 08 No. 009 P. 06/ 08<br />
somewhere else and will then use American products. Let me just give<br />
you one example. Someone told me yesterday about a company that's<br />
making toys now no offense, Prime Minister in China that<br />
intends to open a plant in Mexico because it will cost so much less<br />
to send the toys from Mexico to the U. S. than China to the and<br />
if they do, they will all of a sudden begin to buy all their plastic,<br />
which is ever So percent of the ooaponent parts from Dupont or some<br />
United States company.<br />
So it is hard to know how many obs will be lost. Net,<br />
wTeh ebree liaervee , n owth ejorbe s wbiellin gb e loas bt igi n pdluesf. e nseB uct utthbaecrkes . w ilAl ndb e whjoabt s I lwoasntt.<br />
to do is to completely reorganize the unemployment system into a<br />
reemploygent system in which people who lose their jobe who are not<br />
likely t679et that same job back within a reasonable amount of time<br />
can goet a wide range of training opportunities based on two things:<br />
What do they want to do, first? And, secondly, based on the best<br />
information we have, what are they most likely to get a job doing7<br />
And so, we are now the Secretary of Labor is<br />
designing a progrea we intend to present it to the Congress, and I<br />
think it will have broad bipartisan support.<br />
Q How will you finance it?<br />
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Through economies we plan to<br />
finance it now through economies assoClated with Implementing the<br />
Reinventing Government report.<br />
An Australian journalist. Yes, sir?<br />
Q You've just acknowledged that some of the gains of<br />
KAFTA might be at the cost of East Asia. Now do you see NAFTA, which<br />
seems to be essentially a preferential arrangement within the North<br />
American context, being able to operate with in that broader APEC<br />
framewor, which is meant to be nondiscrlminatory?<br />
1 would ask Mr. Keating to also respond, please.<br />
PRESIDZNT CLINTON: If you look at it from our point of<br />
view, what we're trying to do is to further lower our trade barriers<br />
against Mexico, and they're % oing to lower and against Canada<br />
they're going to lower more of theirs against us, That's not<br />
inconsistent with what my overarching goal is, which is to get a<br />
freer trading system worldwide, which is why we're pushing the GATT<br />
Round. But, meanwhile, it is very much in the interest of the<br />
United States to have a stronger, more stable, aore democratic and<br />
more pro6perous Mexico on our southern border, able to buy more ot<br />
our products. And most of what we do there would have marginal or no<br />
impact one way or the other on anything that Could happen, for<br />
example, in Southeast Asia in the next four or five years.<br />
I would also say that If this worxs, what I think you'll<br />
see is more open trading systems and fewer tariffs in many other<br />
Latin American countries which are changing politioally and<br />
economically as well.<br />
so I am not for a discriminatory systmp but what I am<br />
trying to do Is make those systens lea closed in their relationships<br />
with us now in the hope that over the long run, the GATT Round and<br />
the worldwide trading rules will really come to dominate the trading<br />
policies of all nations. And then, when we have regional groups like<br />
APEC, they'll be for the our~ osa of outtina more arrancements </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Sep. 93 12: 08 No. 009 P. 07/ 08<br />
-7-<br />
PRESZDENT C TON: yes, would you i1Xe tQ answer that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER KUTING: I don't thinX that there is<br />
anything necessarily inconsistent between either the United States<br />
trading into the Asia Pacific, Canada trading with the Asia Pacific,<br />
or Mexico trading with the Asia Pacific individually or collectively<br />
as part of KAPTA. I think what is important in terms of the view of<br />
the Asian economies Asia-Pacific economies of NAFTA is that there<br />
ie perhaps more flesh on the bones of APEC before NAFTA goes beyond<br />
Mexico, perhaps into South America. But the concept of )# AFTA<br />
integrating with the Asia Pacific is one where I don't think there is<br />
any conflict of concepts. And as the President has said, both things<br />
are going to increase the velocity of trade, both within the<br />
Americans and within the Asia Pacific.<br />
Q Mr, Keating, could you tell us it you've determined<br />
who will represent China at the APEC at the leaders conference<br />
that follows the viinisterial meeting, and it you've given the<br />
President of any idea of other issues that might be discussed at that<br />
time, and what the objectives actually are at that conference?<br />
PRIMt MINISTER IATING: Well, I thinX the President<br />
naturally is the host of this conference and, therefore, the invitees<br />
and the acceptances are primary a matter for him. gut I know that<br />
China is now considering who they might send.<br />
The key thing about the conference is that it provides<br />
definition to a new economic world economic comunity. And that<br />
is the Asia-Pacifio economic comzunity. So by having a leaders<br />
conference, by the APEC member states attending at leadership level,<br />
it's providing a definition of that area that formally wasn't so.<br />
APEC, in terms of its Intrastate trade, is, in fact,<br />
more integrated than is the European Community or even NXPTA. go<br />
there's a great naturalness about AP2C, and I think the President's<br />
historic initiative of inviting the leaders together gives its form,<br />
substance, and as we ourselves adopt an agenda, a work program for<br />
the trade-liberalizing agenda o APEC. Not only is that body having<br />
form and definition, but it will actually proceed along the path of<br />
trade liberalivation, the very thing that the President is committed<br />
to. THE PRESIDENT: if I might, let mae just say, first of<br />
all, on the economic issues, Asia is the fastest growing part of the<br />
world. Latin America In the second fastest growing now. About<br />
percent of our exports are now going to Asia. And about more and<br />
more of our trade-related jobs are tied there. It is a very<br />
important thing that we are not only hosting this economic conference<br />
that and the Prime Minister has been too modest. He played a<br />
major role in convincing all these countries that their leaders<br />
should come to Seattle to be a part of this. But the fact that all<br />
these leaders are going to come here and we're going to have a chance<br />
to sit one on one and in groups with no sort of bureaucratic<br />
apparatus, not preset agenda, nothing to weigh us down, and talk<br />
through a whole range of economic and political issues, is an<br />
enormous opportunity for me to follow up on what we did at the<br />
0-7, where we reestablished clearly and publicly the dynamics of our<br />
relationship with Japan, which we're working on now; our security<br />
obligations in Yorea.<br />
Now, we'll have a chance, I'm not sure a United States<br />
president has ever had before, to talk to the leaders of all these<br />
countries at one tine and to try to map out an agenda. Out I don't<br />
want to prewrite what's going to happen there because it might get a<br />
little better as we ao alona. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Sep. 93 12: 08 No. 009 P. 08/ 08<br />
THE PRESIDENT: well, we don't know yet. But I's hoping<br />
that they'll be very vell represented and I kind of think they will<br />
be. We owe the last question to an Australian journalist<br />
because we promised 50/ 50. Oo ahead.<br />
Q I appreciate it. For both of you gentlemen, do you<br />
See that the NAFTA THE PRESIDENT; He's not an Australian journalist.<br />
( Laughter.) Q No, for the ABC the Australian Broadcast<br />
Corporation. THE PRESIDENT: Oh really? Okay, go ahead. ( Laughter.)<br />
Q You talked a lot about<br />
THE PRESIDENT: I thought ve'd'get an American trying to<br />
mimic an Australian accent. ( Laughter.) I didn't realize we had<br />
go ahead. Q You've talked a lot about the NAFTA process and<br />
GAT. And for both of you, do you see any positive impact of having<br />
the alternatives of NAFTA and QATT baving alternatives of NMATA<br />
and APEC for the GATTprocess? is there a certain political leverage<br />
that you get out of it? I believe Mickey Kantor had Ambassador<br />
Kantor had talked about that during one of the congressional<br />
hearings. Is there a positive impact going back to the GATT process?<br />
PRINZ MINISTZR 5CATING: Well, I think APEC and NAlTA,<br />
too, end Up being GATT-plus options. They are GATT plus. But in the<br />
event that GATT did fail, they do define themselves as freer trade<br />
areas. In the case of MAFTA, in the case of APLC, defining an area<br />
which has got enormous mass, an enormous weight economic mass and<br />
economic weight and economic growth. So the United States looking<br />
into that all of us locking into that, lifting the velocity of<br />
that means that in defining a new economic and trading community, in<br />
getting that growth up this is at least some alternative than where<br />
we'd have been in the unhappy position of the GATT Round failing.<br />
Now, frankly, I don't think the GATT Round will fail. I<br />
don't think the Europeans can let the French decide that the world's<br />
trading round should fail. I don't think the French will want to<br />
carry the Odium Of the round failing at their expense. And<br />
therefore, I believe there's much in the GAT Round succeeding.<br />
But I do see NAFTA and APEC aS GATT-plus overlays or<br />
overlays to the GAT. but you can also see them in place thereof in<br />
part as discrete area communities where we can all benefit by freer<br />
trade. Q ( Inaudible.)<br />
PRIME MINISTER KEATINQ Well, I think you've got to say<br />
this, that APEC equals growth, equals jobs. I think NAPTA equals<br />
growth, equals jobs. And that's the point the President was making<br />
earlier. THE PRESIDENT: I couldn't give a better answer than<br />
that. Thank you very much.<br />
THE PAESS: Thank vou. </p>
