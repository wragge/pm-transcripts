PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW OLLE, PAUL LYNEHAM JIM<br />
MIDDLETON, 4 CORNERS, 17 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
OLLE: Within the next 12 months and possibly a lot sooner<br />
Australians must choose their next Prime Minister. There<br />
are just two serious contenders for the position and tonight<br />
they're both here in our Sydney studios for job interviews.<br />
The direct comparison should help us ensure the country's<br />
placed in the very best of hands. To ensure the<br />
questioning's in the very best of hands I'm joined by ABC<br />
televisions' Chief Political Correspondents', Paul Lyneham<br />
and Jim Middleton. Last week's economic statement and the<br />
critical weekend by-election have given a sharp focus to the<br />
performance of our alternative Prime Ministers. As we all<br />
know the incumbent won't go face to face with his opposite<br />
number so you'll have to settle for back to back. While<br />
we're talking to Bob Hawke, John Howard is waiting in the<br />
wings, out of ear shot, in the proverbial sound proof booth.<br />
Well Prime Minister that seems as good a place as any to<br />
start. Why won't you debate head on with John Howard? I<br />
mean you've had<br />
PM: I do it in the Parliament when he's prepared to face me<br />
in the Parliament, which is very seldom. I'm not going to<br />
give this man who can't get great standing in his own Party<br />
an additional platform. There is no need to. I'll be<br />
judged on the performance of this Government.<br />
OLLE: Maybe you don't need to but you used to relish such<br />
encounters. I mean are you no more confident about that<br />
PM: Before I was Prime Minister I do a lot of things<br />
differently since I've been Prime minister, Andrew, as you<br />
probably know.<br />
OLLE: It's just that he's just outside there. It seems<br />
like-PM: Look let's get on with it. Why waste time on that.<br />
OLLE: Alright you're clearly not going to move on that.<br />
Let's look at Greensborough. You've won but it was hardly a<br />
terrific result for you, was it, 16% loss of primary votes? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well let's judge it against the assessments that were<br />
made by the National Party and the Liberal Party before the<br />
by-election. The National Party said and one of the leading<br />
figures in the Liberal Party said they expected a swing of<br />
between 15 and 20%. They got about 5. Now a traditional<br />
by-election swing, given the circumstances of the VEDC, the<br />
Fordham resignation, the National Safety Council of<br />
Australia fiasco and high interest rates, I'll settle for<br />
that win thank you.<br />
MIDDLETON: It is nevertheless an erosion of votes. Is<br />
perhaps one of the problems that you've confused the voters<br />
of Australia? On the one hand you're continuing to ask them<br />
for restraint but by the same token you've just given them<br />
or are just about to give them some more money. That<br />
confusion part of the problem?<br />
PM: I don't know whether it's confusion but it is true that<br />
we've asked the voters to restrain over a fairly long period<br />
of time. But it's also the case that last year I promised<br />
them, to continue after this year to promise them that by<br />
the 1st of July we'd be giving them significant tax cuts<br />
which will ensure an improvement in their real standards of<br />
living. We're doing that in a situation and in a way which<br />
we believe should not involve a significant increase in<br />
demand because the other factors which have had the economy<br />
boiling away will not be there to the same extent. We won't<br />
have the great increase in the terms of trade, we won't have<br />
investment at the same high levels, for example, and we<br />
won't have housing construction at the same high levels so<br />
we're paying for the tax cuts out of the accumulated<br />
decisions we've made before which gave us the significant<br />
budget surplus. So there may be some confusion. They<br />
certainly don't like the high interest rates but the fact is<br />
that we can't have them lower at the moment while we get the<br />
level of activity down.<br />
MIDDLETON: It does sound a little bit like a reward for<br />
being good.<br />
PM: It sounds much more like what it is and that is the<br />
delivery of a promise specifically made last year. That is<br />
that if there was wage restraint during 1988-9 Jim, and<br />
there has been, and if we could negotiate wage restraint<br />
for ' 89-90 which we have done, then I promised that there<br />
would be significant tax cuts from July 1. There is nothing<br />
more complex than that. It's the delivery of a relevant<br />
economic and political promise. That is if we had not done<br />
what we have done, that is promise significant wage ( sic)<br />
cuts, workers having exercised wage restraint, then in the<br />
economic circumstances they would've been able to obtain a<br />
massive increase in wages. So what we're getting is a<br />
buy-off of a massive increase in wage costs by the delivery<br />
of a specific and responsible promise to deliver tax cuts. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: But many Australians Prime minister believe I<br />
think that we are now closer to the banana republic than we<br />
were in ' 86 when Paul Keating issued that<br />
PM: I don't really believe that and if they do they are<br />
wrong. The evidence is overwhelmingly against that. What<br />
we had then was a massive decline in the terms of trade<br />
which slashes<br />
LYNEHAM: It's worse now.<br />
PM: No. The terms of trade have improved, more than<br />
improved<br />
LYNEHAM: inaudible<br />
PM: But what you've got to understand about the current<br />
account is that that is made up very substantially of a<br />
massive increase in investment. The investment levels of<br />
Australia now are the highest as a proportion of gross<br />
domestic product they have been for the 40 years that<br />
comparable records have been kept. So we're restructuring<br />
Australian industry, there is a massive re-equipment going<br />
on, and that will mean that in the period ahead you're going<br />
to have an Australian sector, an industrial sector, which is<br />
going to be more able to compete with imports and also<br />
provide more exports. And remember that the level of<br />
manufactured exports has increased in each of the last two<br />
years by 20%, we're going to do better than that in the<br />
future I believe.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well if the tax cuts and the wage increases are<br />
not going to fuel demand and make our trading position even<br />
worse, why have you felt the need to urge Australians to<br />
either save that money or buy Australian made<br />
PM: Well obviously we'd be best I mean I don't want to<br />
see demand burst out but for the reasons I've put before the<br />
factors that have been putting demand at a high level are<br />
not going to be repeated. But it would still be better for<br />
Australians for those Australians who can and I realise<br />
not all can to save rather than spend. But it remains<br />
true that obviously with a deficit on the external account<br />
it would be much better if Australians could buy Australian<br />
rather than to buy imports and so I've asked that they do<br />
that. I mean there is just no argument amongst any<br />
economist about that. we'll all be better off if all off us<br />
and myself included you, Australians out there, all your<br />
viewers, if we can spend the additional disposable income<br />
we've got, buy Australian.<br />
OLLE: All that you've said so far Prime minister the<br />
economic statement that Paul Keating brought down last week<br />
has had a somewhat frosty reception I think it's fair to say<br />
across the community. Is the problem that people simply<br />
think that you're giving back what's rightfully theirs<br />
anyway? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: No I think there was some degree of cynicism engendered<br />
by absolutely wrong interpretations as to timing. But I<br />
don't know what you do in this circumstance. When I<br />
promised 12 months ago that I'm going to deliver tax cuts on<br />
the 1st of July I do it then I'm accused of cynicism and I'm<br />
going to have an election. Of course the bloke who talked<br />
about there being a July election is the fellow that you're<br />
going to have on after me. Now what his reasons were for<br />
doing that I'm not quite sure but perhaps it's because he<br />
wanted to shore up his position and they couldn't have a<br />
change of leadership right on the eve of an election, I<br />
don't know. But all it was was the delivery of a promsie.<br />
Now if I hadn't delivered the promised that I'd made 12<br />
months ago I would've ben accused of breaking a promise.<br />
OLLE: Well there's another promise we have in front of us<br />
now. Mr Keating says there's going to be a sharp<br />
deceleration in demand. When and what impact do you think<br />
it will have?<br />
PM: There are signs already Andrew, of demand decelerating.<br />
It is apparent to some extent in the housing statistics. I<br />
think that you'll see in the third quarter firmer evidence<br />
of the decline in demand. So what we've got to do and on<br />
our record we're entitled to be judged that we can do it<br />
is to make sure that we get the level of demand coming back<br />
sufficient to help us on the current account and the level<br />
of imports but not so far back as to stop growth and stop<br />
employment. Now on 6 years performance we're entitled to be<br />
judged as capable of doing that. We will.<br />
MIDDLETON: The Treasurer also suggested there'd be a<br />
halving of demand. Normally one would think of that as<br />
being a recipe for recession and indeed<br />
PM: Not if you know your statistics. Just remember what<br />
the statistics are. In the last 12 months, and this is on<br />
the basis of the national accounts which came out the<br />
previous week, demand had grown by 8% these are the<br />
figures that Paul had in mind demand had grown by 8%,<br />
production, Australian production, had grown by The<br />
difference between the 8% growth in consumption, the 4%<br />
growth in production, was imports. So what he was saying<br />
quite rightly is that you could have consumption coming back<br />
by the sort of order he was talking about and that would<br />
still be consistent with significant growth but more<br />
containable growth. His figures are right.<br />
MIDDLETON: With this big slowing in demand isn't that going<br />
to for the first time put a dent in one of your proudest<br />
records, that of job creation?<br />
PM: It will mean that the rate of employment growth won't<br />
be so high. But just remember what the figures are. In<br />
this last year we've had employment growth of 3.8% which is<br />
together with what we've done in the previous five years<br />
responsible for the fact that we are creating jobs 4 times </p>
<p>PM ( cont): faster than Mr Howard did in his period in<br />
Government and twice as fast as the rest of the world. So<br />
we can afford the rate of employment growth to come back but<br />
still have a situation where we can take account of the<br />
growth in the workforce.<br />
OLLE: So now it is going to be harder for people to find<br />
jobs though isn't it? Who's going to feel the pinch first,<br />
do you think?<br />
PM: You always want to look on the dark side, I know<br />
Andrew, but the point is that you've got to look at the<br />
alternatives. See people are saying that rates of interest<br />
are too high. If you brought back the rate of interest now,<br />
if you eased monetary policy, then of course what you would<br />
do would be to have a flood of imports and then you would<br />
have a situation where you'd have to massively put the<br />
brakes on. In this way we'll continue to do what we've done<br />
for six years in changing economic circumstances. Remember<br />
what happened in 85-86. we lost $ 11B of national income<br />
when the terms of trade turned against us and we were still<br />
able with the cooperation of the trade union movement to<br />
avoid recession and keep employment going. Now we've got an<br />
overheated economy so the task which we will achieve is to<br />
bring back the level of activity sufficient to lower imports<br />
down but to keep employment growth growing. We will. our<br />
record shows that we are entitled to be judged as capable of<br />
doing that.<br />
LYNEHA4: But isn't that one reason why people are confused?<br />
When we were getting poor terms of trade we were told to<br />
tighten our belts. When they're throwing money at us by the<br />
bucket load we're told that we can't handle that, we've got<br />
to tighten our belts?<br />
PM: The-re is nothing difficult about that. If you've lost<br />
$ 11B of national income as we did in our 85-86 period<br />
with a decline in the terms of trade then you're $ 11B<br />
worse off. Now the situation we've got that all economists<br />
it doesn't matter where they are politically recognise<br />
that we've got an overheated economy because with the<br />
turn around of terms. of trade we've had an enormous increase<br />
in income coming into the country, we've got employment<br />
rising, we've got investment at a 40 year high, the highest<br />
it's been since records have been kept for 40 years. Now<br />
those combinations of circumstances have an economy<br />
operating that strongly that we're sucking in too many<br />
imports so in that situation of course you've got to<br />
exercise restraint, get things down. But we can do that in<br />
a way which is increasing the real disposable income of<br />
people because we're doing that, it's a paid for tax cut out<br />
of the surplus that we've been able to generate by the<br />
decisions we've taken up to this point. That is with the<br />
tax cuts that we're giving we will still have in 89-90 the<br />
same level of surplus that we had before and we've done that<br />
all in the circumstance where I remind you of what we've<br />
done in the period. We inherited a situation where the<br />
deficit as a proportion of the gross domestic product was </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM ( cont): We've translated that to a surplus of<br />
Now that 6% turnaround represents a turnaround of<br />
approximately. Now that's enabled us to increase by<br />
26% in real terms the expenditure on social welfare, to move<br />
the proportions of outlays that go to social welfare, from<br />
to 56%, do all those things and accumulate this surplus<br />
out of which we'll pay for the tax cuts. So there is no<br />
pressure from what we've done for an increase on interest<br />
rates because the public sector borrowing requirement will<br />
remain at zero and there'll be no pressure on inflation<br />
because the trade union movement have accepted a wages<br />
outcome for 1989-90 of 6 1/ 2%.<br />
LYNEHAM: And will they stick with<br />
PM: They will, and what I will defend as vigorously as I<br />
can is the integrity of the trade union movement. Every<br />
employer in this country knows, and I think you appreciate<br />
Paul, that they could be getting very very much higher wage<br />
outcomes now. The employers have been knocking down the<br />
door of the ACTU trying to give wage increases. They've<br />
held it to 7% in this last year, they've agreed to 6.5% in<br />
1989-90, they will stick to their bargain.<br />
OLLE: Won't the unions be more tempted to take that money<br />
though if they get knocked back?<br />
PM: Knocked back by whom?<br />
OLLE: When they have to justify their restructuring to<br />
qualify for this<br />
PM: They have given their undertaking and you are entitled,<br />
I believe, you are entitled to judge them on their record.<br />
Every employer, every economist in this country knows that<br />
in this last 12 months instead of getting a 7% increase in<br />
wages they could've gone into double digits. The last three<br />
years of the chap that's coming on after me, when he was<br />
Treasurer, in the last three years under that government,<br />
double digit wage increases under them. In more buoyant<br />
economic circumstances now, 7% and they've agreed to<br />
On their record they're entitled to be believed. It's their<br />
restraint which has produced 1.3 million more new jobs, a<br />
rate of job growth twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
They've done that, why shouldn't they be believed now when<br />
they say that they'll agree to Because what you've<br />
got to remember is what we've done is to deliver on average<br />
a 12% increase in disposable income but with only<br />
coming from it from wages. That's the additional cost on<br />
employers, the rest has come from a combination of tax<br />
reductions and increases in family allowances.<br />
MIDDLETON: And you can guarantee that in these overheated<br />
circumstances that if the unions don't restructure as<br />
they're supposed to do, that they won't get that second<br />
round, that second part of the plan? </p>
<p>PM: Quite clearly they've given the promise, and this is<br />
entirely hypothetical. If they weren't to keep their<br />
promises then the situation would change. You're talking<br />
about your fellow Australians, people who could've got much<br />
greater wage increases but have been prepared to have real<br />
wage reductions so that we can have another 1.3 million of<br />
our fellow Australians in work. Why in the name of all<br />
that's fair and decent and reasonable, when they've done<br />
that, when they've put another 1.3 million of their fellow<br />
Australians into work by accepting a real wage reduction<br />
over this period, why don't you believe them now? The fair<br />
and reasonable thing Jim is to say, well my God, they've<br />
accepted a real wage reduction over this period, they've<br />
allowed Australians to have a rate of employment increase<br />
four times as fast as under the Fraser-Howard years, twice<br />
as fast as the rest of the world, they've delivered that and<br />
now you want to be sceptical about their promise.<br />
MIDDLETON: Well there are plenty of employers out there in<br />
the who are battling to get skilled workers. They may<br />
be tempted to have<br />
PM: They've already been tempted. That's what I was saying<br />
before Jim. The fact is that Bill Kelty there at the ACTU<br />
has been knocking employers back, he's been knocking them<br />
back. Why? Because they do have a commitment to a view of<br />
a restructured Australia, one that's more competitive, one<br />
where its workforce through the restructuring process is<br />
going to be multi-skilled, have broad-banded classifications<br />
so that the actual structures in the workplace will reflect<br />
the patterns and processes of production of the modern days,<br />
not of 50 years ago. Now Kelty and the ACTU are committed<br />
to that and they know they can't get that without<br />
restructuring and they know they can't get it without the<br />
commitment they've given us.<br />
OLLE: One of your answers is productivity as well isn't it?<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
OLLE: Why not go the whole hog then as John Howard plans to<br />
do and reward individual effort, be it at the company or<br />
worker level rather than<br />
PM: For one very simple reason. What you're saying is that<br />
you want to do away with the centralised wage fixing system.<br />
OK. It's pretty sensible Andrew to look at history. They<br />
did this in 1980-81. We warned them against it and the<br />
centralised wage system was gone and they went back to a<br />
free run. What happened? A 17% increase in wages, a<br />
blowout. The way in which you've got a real wage reduction<br />
and real wage restraint compensated by improvements in the<br />
social wage in this country is through the centralised wage<br />
system. The employers of this country have been saved,<br />
we've all been saved by the fact that instead of wages<br />
blowing out like that, a la the 17% increase under Howard<br />
and that each year, the last three years they were in<br />
office, double digit wage </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PM ( cont): increases, we've got it down significantly to 7<br />
and 6.5% and it's that which has enabled employment growth<br />
to take place. Now why in the name of anything that begins<br />
to be sensible do you want to say Mr Howard and Mr Fraser<br />
messed it up, got double digit wage outcomes under the<br />
previous system, so we think it's a good idea and what did<br />
they do in that? Got the worst recession in 50 years,<br />
simultaneous double digit inflation, double digit<br />
employment, interest rates well above what we've got.<br />
day bills under us haven't reached 18%, they got to 22%<br />
under Mr Howard in April of 1982. So you think it would be<br />
a good idea to say that was beaut then to get the worst<br />
recession in 50 years, let's go back to that.<br />
OLLE: Nevertheless there is a logic isn't there in<br />
rewarding individual effort and penalising inefficiency?<br />
PM: That is what happens. You know how we are rewarding<br />
effort now? We are rewarding it in a very simple way, by<br />
putting more Australians into work. There is effort. How<br />
do you think we've had a 20% increase in manufactured<br />
exports, how do you think we've had a 9.2% reduction in real<br />
unit labour costs since our term in office, how do you think<br />
we've had a 7.4% increase in our international<br />
competitiveness other than by this wage system. And the<br />
reward that's come out of all those things that have been<br />
done have been the 1.3 million jobs and the fact that we can<br />
now compete in markets in a way we were never able to do<br />
before. You don't get 20% increase in manufactured exports<br />
in each of the last two years without there being a system<br />
gradually putting in place which is establishing incentive,<br />
both for employers and for workers.<br />
MIDDLETON: You're fond of comparing your record and John<br />
Howard's record, what about your team's? You've got<br />
PM: Let me say, when I talk about my record it's not just<br />
Bob Hawke. I mean I recognise, as I think you'll<br />
acknowledge, I always speak about the contribution of my<br />
Ministers. I mean, it is a team.<br />
MIDDLETON: Some of your Ministers are looking a bit tired,<br />
Peter Walsh is taking a break, others are talking about<br />
quitting John Button at the next election and so on. we<br />
can't even be sure that you'll be around right through the<br />
next term can we?<br />
PM: You can be sure of me. There's no question you talk<br />
about some of ministers being tired, of course some of them<br />
are. You don't work as hard as they have for 6 years and<br />
stay exactly as fresh as you were at the beginning of 6<br />
years. But there has been basically a great stability<br />
amongst my core ministers, core economic and industry<br />
Ministers, a great stability. You've talked about Button,<br />
Keating, Kerin, Blewett, Walsh.<br />
MIDDLETON: But you won't have all of them after the next<br />
election. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PM: I'm not aware of any that are going of the ones I've<br />
mentioned. And let me say, if you want to talk about<br />
stability just look at my mob, great fellas, they'll be<br />
there, and have a look at the other side.<br />
OLLE: We'll obviously take that up with Mr Howard.<br />
PM: I'll leave it in your good hands.<br />
OLLE: But inevitably, apart from the team thing that we<br />
just emphasised, there are personal comparisons that are<br />
going to be made of the leadership aren't there, between<br />
yourself and Mr Howard. Why is it do you think that people<br />
like you personally so much more than John Howard?<br />
PM: I'm not going to talk about John. I'll attack him<br />
politically and strongly and vigorously but in terms of<br />
personality and so on, that's another matter. As far as-<br />
OLLE: Do you feel when people talk disparagingly of<br />
' little Johnny'? I mean, he's even taller than you isn't<br />
he? PM: No he's not actually as it turns out but that's, I<br />
think, a matter of absolute irrelevance. John Button is<br />
much smaller than his counterparts. What's size got to do<br />
with anything? I've never heard anything so ridiculous.<br />
Look at the size of Malcolm. So what, what does it mean?<br />
It's the most futile and stupid thing, the fact that I'm<br />
fractionally taller than John Howard, so what. It's nothing<br />
to do with it. The only part of your question Andrew that I<br />
can helpfully say anything about is in terms of my own<br />
position. I think what's relevant is this, that I honestly<br />
can say that I love mixing with people. I've been in public<br />
life now for just over 30 years and all of that 30 years<br />
I've made a point of mixing and I enjoy it. For some<br />
politicians it's a chore, for me it's not, I'm lucky. I<br />
love the Australian people, I love mixing with them.<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, you said when asked to give him a<br />
reference once that he was hard working and loyal. Now you<br />
were prepared to give him a reference but you're not<br />
prepared to look at the other side.<br />
PM: It's not for me to go into an attack on the personality<br />
of my opponent.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you concede he's tenacious?<br />
PM: Of course he's tenacious. I've said that, he is<br />
tenacious and I congratulate him for his tenacity. But I<br />
would hope that as far as the relations between John Howard<br />
and myself are concerned that we can fight like Kilkenny<br />
cats about our perceived policy differences, where we think </p>
<p>PM ( cont): we've been inadequate, where each other's been<br />
inadequate on policy positions. You won't find me getting<br />
into some personality attack upon John Howard. I don't<br />
think that's the way to do it.<br />
OLLE: Prime Minister, our time is up. Thank you very much.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
ends </p>
