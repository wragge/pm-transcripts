    <content><![CDATA[<p>I warmly welcome the ground-breaking ceremony today to mark the beginning of construction of the New Zealand memorial in Canberra. </p>
<p>The memorial is a timely reminder of the close and abiding links between Australians and New Zealanders, both in times of war and peace.  It also recalls our common sacrifice in pursuit of the ideals we both hold so dear.  The ANZAC spirit lives on strongly today in East Timor, in the Pacific and elsewhere.  </p>
<p>I understand that, fittingly, the memorial will feature the two bronze handles of a Maori kete or basket, which represents the sharing of values and burdens between us.</p>
<p>The memorial is New Zealand's gift to Australia for its Centenary of Federation in 2001. </p>
<p>The Hon Bruce Scott, Minister for Veterans Affairs, and Senator the Hon Ian Macdonald, Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, will represent the Government at the ground-breaking ceremony. </p>
<p>I very much look forward to being at the dedication ceremony , likely to take place just before ANZAC Day 2001.</p>
