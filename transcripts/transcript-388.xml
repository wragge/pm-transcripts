IMPROVED HARBOUR #. ND COIL LO.. DING FACILITIES AT<br />
GLAD3TONE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. R. G. M4enzies<br />
Recently the Premier of Queensland ( Mr. Niclin)<br />
sought Coronrealth financial assistance tc-wards the cost of<br />
improving the facilities at Gladstone H.-rbour for the export of<br />
coal to Japan. There is the prospect that at least one nillion<br />
tons of coal from the Lov. iur Dawson Valley nay be exported<br />
t'rough the port of Gladstone during the next five years. The<br />
improvements it is proposed to carry out include the provision<br />
of new coal loading facilities and the deepening of the port to<br />
pernit access by larger vessels. These irprovements are<br />
estimated to cost Å C405,000.<br />
The Commonwealth Governament has been impressed by the<br />
prospect of substantial additional export earninjs which<br />
improvement of these harbolir and loading facilities would permit.<br />
The Coimmonwealth has therefore offered queensland<br />
financial assistance towards the cost of iz7proving the<br />
facilities at Gladstone. The assistance is contingent upon a<br />
contract being obtained for the export of at least one million<br />
tons of coal from the Lower Dawson Valley within a five-year<br />
period. Subject to this, the Co. rmonwealth will provide a total<br />
of Å 200,000 towards the project. Of this, Å 100,000 will be a<br />
, rant, and the remaining Å 100,000 will be a :: epayable long-terrm<br />
loan. The Queensland Government Las accepted this offer,<br />
