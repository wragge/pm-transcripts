    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p> Ladies and gentlemen, today we have had an extraordinarily successful</p>
<p> Premiers' Conference. We've reached agreement on all outstanding</p>
<p> matters relating to the financial agreement between the governments</p>
<p> which has now been signed, sealed and delivered. And the last act</p>
<p> in the dramatic transformation of Australia's taxation system</p>
<p> and the last deed required to take this country into the 21st</p>
<p> Century with a financial and taxation system fit for the 21st</p>
<p> Century is for the Australian Senate to take heed of what the governments</p>
<p> of Australia, the Federal Government and the six State governments</p>
<p> and the two Territorial governments of Australia have done.</p>
<p>It was a very good meeting, there was a bit of give and take. The</p>
<p> Commonwealth was able to go part of the way in relation to the Queensland</p>
<p> situation. We agreed with a number of the State requests in relation</p>
<p> to the disputed items. We did not agree with one major request relating</p>
<p> to the fringe benefits tax because that did not involve as alleged</p>
<p> by the States any diminution at all of the goods and services tax.</p>
<p> Overall it was an outstanding result. It speaks volumes for the constructive</p>
<p> character of these meetings when they are backed by a decision of</p>
<p> the Australian people. As one of the Premiers said today, the Federal</p>
<p> Government has a mandate to implement taxation reform and of course</p>
<p> we do. And the Premiers were recognising that and that is why they</p>
<p> signed this agreement. But it would be wrong of us, of either of us,</p>
<p> to discount the historic character of today's agreement. This</p>
<p> is the largest single transformation of Commonwealth-State financial</p>
<p> relations at least since the end of World War II and perhaps since</p>
<p> federation. And it lays the basis importantly for a growth in tax</p>
<p> revenues to the States that will fund the schools, the roads, the</p>
<p> police services and the hospitals that the States need.</p>
<p>One of the ironic things to me about this whole tax debate is that</p>
<p> the GST is the most pro-welfare sector tax system that this country</p>
<p> could ever have. Because it's through the GST going to the States</p>
<p> that for the first time the States will have enough money to fund</p>
<p> all of the services that they want to fund.</p>
<p>The other item that I'd like to mention is drugs. The Commonwealth</p>
<p> has offered a new $220 million drug programme over a period of four</p>
<p> years. This is over and above the $290 million under the Tough on</p>
<p> Drugs strategy that I have progressively released over the last couple</p>
<p> of years. The biggest single item in the new programme is a diversion</p>
<p> strategy whereby the Federal Government will fund, we calculate up</p>
<p> to 300,000 treatment places over a period of four years as part of</p>
<p> a diversionary programme whereby people who have been apprehended</p>
<p> by police that are not judged to be people who would benefit from</p>
<p> going through the criminal justice system are offered the opportunity</p>
<p> of going into treatment. And if, we believe that if we can through</p>
<p> this approach divert a large number of those people into treatment</p>
<p> facilities that will not only be of enormous long-term benefit to</p>
<p> them but also to the community. The Commonwealth will provide the</p>
<p> money, we will fund the places, the States and Territories will provide</p>
<p> the police services, there will be joint assessment teams to be funded</p>
<p> by both the Commonwealth and the States. We will work out a separate</p>
<p> protocol between the Commonwealth and each of the States in relation</p>
<p> to the interaction of the assessment procedure, the police and the</p>
<p> treatment facilities. It does represent a new approach. It does have</p>
<p> some similarities to an approach being trialled in Victoria and also</p>
<p> some aspects of the drug court approach in New South Wales. And it</p>
<p> is going to be adopted on a national basis and in addition to that</p>
<p> we'll be providing a lot more resources for schools, some further</p>
<p> resources to go into the activities of the Federal Police and the</p>
<p> criminal investigation activities of the Federal Police and the National</p>
<p> Crime Authority.</p>
<p>But it represents new money of $220 million over and above the $290</p>
<p> million which now takes to over $500 million the additional Commonwealth</p>
<p> Government commitment to the war against drugs. We don't argue</p>
<p> for a moment that it provides all of the solutions but it will be</p>
<p> another important building block. We have also indicated that we will</p>
<p> to the best of our capacity at a federal level fast track the National</p>
<p> Health and Medical Research Council consideration of the listing on</p>
<p> the pharmaceutical benefits scheme list of Naltrexone and also when</p>
<p> an application is made in relation to Buprenorphine we will adopt</p>
<p> the same approach as well. That is the drug that has been mentioned</p>
<p> by Mr Beattie, the Queensland Premier. And the Victorian Premier placed</p>
<p> on the table for consideration by governments, and it will be a matter</p>
<p> to which we will return later, the proposal to establish a national</p>
<p> institute in relation to depression.</p>
<p>Overall, the drugs component of the conference was equally constructive.</p>
<p> There's a genuine desire Commonwealth and States across party</p>
<p> lines to focus on our many common points of agreement and to make</p>
<p> a further contribution towards fighting the scourge of drugs within</p>
<p> our community. And I am particularly pleased at the very co-operative</p>
<p> attitude displayed by everybody in relation to that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard you mentioned give and take with the States on the tax deal.</p>
<p> Are you ready to extend some give and take to the Senate in the form</p>
<p> of enhancing the compensation package?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we think the compensation package is good. We think it has stood</p>
<p> the test of scrutiny and examination and we look forward to the debate</p>
<p> starting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard can you guarantee that pensions under the GST will always</p>
<p> be higher than they would otherwise have been without the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can repeat the guarantee that I gave in the election campaign</p>
<p> and the guarantee on which we were elected and that is that under</p>
<p> our arrangements people receiving the pension will always be in real</p>
<p> terms 1.5 per cent ahead of the CPI. That was the guarantee I gave</p>
<p> in the election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about in relation to male average weekly earnings?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you know the arrangements in relation to male average weekly</p>
<p> earnings. You know that as a result of our legislation there was a</p>
<p> guarantee under that legislation that it would not fall below a certain</p>
<p> percentage of male average weekly earnings and that's always</p>
<p> been the case. If as a consequence of the action of our proposals</p>
<p> and our commitment pensioners are even better off, well that's</p>
<p> good.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is your drugs policy predicated on zero tolerance especially in schools?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look our drugs policy is not predicated and never has been predicated</p>
<p> upon a particular description. Everybody around that table today is</p>
<p> united in the view that there is no place for drugs in the schools</p>
<p> in Australia, and that we will give the principals, the parents and</p>
<p> the school communities every support in pursuing that objective. Some</p>
<p> people like myself call that zero tolerance. Others might call it</p>
<p> something else. But the name is not as important as the commitment,</p>
<p> and the commitment is that there is no place for drugs in our schools</p>
<p> full stop.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On radio this morning you spoke of an element of compulsion for this</p>
<p> treatment.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes there is. There is an element of compulsion. I mean what happens</p>
<p> is that if somebody is apprehended they have to be assessed. They</p>
<p> might then decide not to comply with the, or enter into the treatment</p>
<p> to which they have been assessed. But of consequence of that could</p>
<p> be that they slip back into the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Costello how important was your conversation with Senator Colston</p>
<p> in arranging the extra money for Queensland and how important do you</p>
<p> think your future dealings will be with him in terms of arranging</p>
<p> passage of the GST legislation?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Well it's very important. Senator Colston had previously made</p>
<p> representations to us concerning additional funds for Queensland.</p>
<p> He's a Senator from Queensland and I think he's got the</p>
<p> interests of Queensland at heart. I rang him again this morning. We</p>
<p> had a discussion about compensation. He put his view to me and as</p>
<p> it turned out the Commonwealth and Queensland compromised. Queensland</p>
<p> had been seeking an additional top-up after the first year and we</p>
<p> agreed to give a top-up after the second year. And so we met the Queensland</p>
<p> demand half way. But Senator Colston was very important to that and</p>
<p> I recognise the submissions that he made and they proved very successful,</p>
<p> very good for Queensland if I may say so today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what about the future of the GST? Did he express or do you expect</p>
<p> to discuss with him any question of compensation for the poor under</p>
<p> the GST plan?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Well I think Senator Colston's made the point before, that he</p>
<p> respects the Government's mandate in relation to GST. By the</p>
<p> way it wasn't just Senator Colston. Premier Beattie made the</p>
<p> same point today. He accepts the Government's mandate in relation</p>
<p> to GST. We went to an election. We received a mandate and those people</p>
<p> that recognise the outcome of elections, and that governments ought</p>
<p> to be allowed to govern on the basis of their policy recognise that.</p>
<p> And Senator Colston's made that point previously I believe.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Treasurer, the States, Premier Beattie...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Speak up George. I can't hear you and I always like to know what</p>
<p> you're saying.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You said Peter Beattie respects your mandate but that still didn't</p>
<p> stop you from kicking in a bit of extra money. The Senate, even if</p>
<p> it did respect your mandate, would be demanding extra compensation.</p>
<p> Is that now the reality that we are in? That having compromised with</p>
<p> the States, that we are looking at some sort of compromise with the</p>
<p> Senate to get the package through?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Let me make the point about Queensland's claim. Queensland's</p>
<p> claim was that the GST revenue ought to be distributed on a pure horizontal</p>
<p> fiscal equalisation basis which would deliver them a bonus over and</p>
<p> above the minimum guarantee, the current system. And they said that</p>
<p> they should be entitled to that from the beginning. Our argument was</p>
<p> that that money should be used to make the minimum guaranteed payment</p>
<p> to the other States and that for the first three years any bonuses</p>
<p> should be redistributed into the pool. Now we came to a compromise</p>
<p> with Queensland so that Queensland gets the benefit after the two</p>
<p> years. It wasn't fully what they were seeking but it was a compromise.</p>
<p> Now you're asking about the Senate and compensation. The first</p>
<p> point I make, and I think the Prime Minister said it, the Senate is</p>
<p> the States' House. It would be a funny day wouldn't it if</p>
<p> the Senate tried to vote down something that's just been agreed</p>
<p> by the Commonwealth's six States and two Territories. And you</p>
<p> may well ask why the States' House which is there and elected</p>
<p> on a State franchise would be voting against an agreement between</p>
<p> eight governments and the Commonwealth. You might well ask that first</p>
<p> point. The second point is, and I come back to what was said yesterday,</p>
<p> even after yesterday, the preferred modeling which was requested by</p>
<p> Labor from Ann Harding still doesn't identify losers. I mean</p>
<p> it's all very well to go around and say "additional compensation".</p>
<p> But if each category of person under all reasonable assumptions is</p>
<p> still a winner it's additional compensation to people who are</p>
<p> already winning. And....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But on their assumption, pensioners get 30 cents in some cases.</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Well depending on the assumptions you make George, but I think I'm</p>
<p> right in saying, and I think this has been accepted by Warren and</p>
<p> Harding, and by anybody that's looked at it, on all reasonable</p>
<p> assumptions, under tax reform all identified category and classes</p>
<p> are still winners - are still winners. In other words if tax reform</p>
<p> were defeated they would go backwards. Now I know there are a lot</p>
<p> of arguments that got around about additional compensation but that's</p>
<p> sort of premised on the fact of identifying people who would be worse</p>
<p> off. We have still not, and none of our political opponents, and none</p>
<p> of the modellers, have yet identified a category of person that is</p>
<p> worse off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So are you ruling out additional compensation, Mr Costello?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>I'm saying that no additional compensation is required if all</p>
<p> categories of person on all possible analyses, with all reasonable</p>
<p> assumptions, are still winners.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that mean you are ruling it out?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Well I gave you the answer ...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>At least three of the States are reviewing National Competition policy.</p>
<p> Do you view that with favour and what is your concern about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It wasn't discussed. Nobody raised it with us.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Premier Beattie...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he didn't raise it. I mean people can always, you know,</p>
<p> have reviews in their minds and amongst themselves but they didn't</p>
<p> raise it with us.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much is the total value of the compromises you had to give today</p>
<p> to get the States on board. They were asking $800-odd million, was</p>
<p> it a figure of $600-odd?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nothing like that.</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>The largest item of the claim from the States was a claim on fringe</p>
<p> benefits tax of $750 million over three years which is not accepted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But look, can I just say in relation to that Â it was give and</p>
<p> take. And one or two of the items that the States put forward had</p>
<p> merit and we agreed to them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But how much did you end up giving?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Much less than they asked for. The precise amount I don't remember,</p>
<p> Paul.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was it $819 million over three years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't done the calculation. We agreed to give, I think</p>
<p> it was about $70 million a year in relation to the local government</p>
<p> and then there was a certain amount going to Queensland and there</p>
<p> was some in relation to housing and the tax equivalent payments.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would it have been more than you expected?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. It was about what we thought Â look, you may find it very</p>
<p> hard to accept but we actually did try and analyse the merit of the</p>
<p> argument. And there was some merit in the Queensland argument, some</p>
<p> merit, not as much as Queensland claimed. There was certainly some</p>
<p> merit in relation to the local government argument. There was no merit</p>
<p> in relation to the fringe benefits tax argument, none at all. There</p>
<p> was some merit in relation to housing and some in relation to the</p>
<p> tax equivalent regime. So we are reasonable men and we settled in</p>
<p> a reasonable fashion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given that, then one could assume if there were any merit in the arguments</p>
<p> put by the Senate you'd have a little (inaudible)....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we had an argument about merit last October and we were judged</p>
<p> the more meritorious of the two teams and that's why we won.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given the defeat on FBT is Victoria the only State that's lost?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>The defeat on FBT doesn't produce any loss in Victoria.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>But the claim on FBT by the States was that because the gross up factor</p>
<p> will be increased as a result of the GST, that revenue should go to</p>
<p> the States and not the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth position is</p>
<p> and was that fringe benefits tax, which is an adjunct to the income</p>
<p> tax system, is a Commonwealth tax base and GST is a State tax base</p>
<p> and that the States were not entitled to any of the proceeds off the</p>
<p> Commonwealth tax base. That was that argument. The argument by Victoria</p>
<p> that they haven't done well is an argument in relation to the</p>
<p> funding for 1999/2000. It's not an argument about the distribution</p>
<p> of funds under the new tax system. It's an argument about the</p>
<p> distribution of funds under the current tax system with the relativities</p>
<p> as set by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It's the last argument</p>
<p> of the ancient regime, that argument. And since they now have a guaranteed</p>
<p> tax base in the future we don't have to have those arguments</p>
<p> anymore because they've got a guaranteed share of the goods and</p>
<p> services produced in Australia at 10 per cent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Victoria go it alone on FBT or did the other States support....?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>It was put forward this morning as a joint demand.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, if the Senate continues to refuse to accept your tax package</p>
<p> in its current form, now that the States have signed off on it, and</p>
<p> if the Senate still refuses, will you consider a double dissolution</p>
<p> election, now that you have the backing of the ....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, as I've said before, it's not long since I was</p>
<p> re-elected and I've got no desire to race back to the polls.</p>
<p> I remain positive. I remain hopeful. I believe that today's outcome</p>
<p> sends a loud, unmistakable, powerful and emphatic message to the Senate</p>
<p> Â get on with it, do the will, do the bidding of the Australian</p>
<p> people; do the will, do the bidding of the Australian States. I mean,</p>
<p> if you can get Bob Carr and Jeff Kennett and Peter Beattie and Richard</p>
<p> Court and John Olsen and Jim Bacon, all of them - three Labor, three</p>
<p> Liberal - to sign up and to say this is the tax system for the new</p>
<p> century, how on earth can the Senate hold out and preserve any sense</p>
<p> of credibility. I mean, here you've got the most recently successful</p>
<p> Labor leader in Australia, he's offered Della yet again to visit</p>
<p> Canberra...</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Which we accepted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Which we accepted. The most recently successful Labor leader in Australia,</p>
<p> the two most recent leaders Â I mean, Beattie and Carr have won</p>
<p> elections and those who have lost elections on the Labor side should</p>
<p> take a bit of notice of those who've won elections on the Labor</p>
<p> side and they should heed their message. But we will just take the</p>
<p> Senate in its stride. The debate starts soon. We'll listen to</p>
<p> the debate. We'll talk to people. We believe the Senate should</p>
<p> do the will of the Australian people and I have no intention of hypothesising</p>
<p> and speculating about entirely hypothetical situations.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
