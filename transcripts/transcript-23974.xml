    <content><![CDATA[<p>Madam Speaker, Mr President.</p>
<p>It is a joy to have friends come from afar.</p>
<p>With free trade negotiations concluded and with a comprehensive strategic partnership established, this is an historic and memorable day.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I welcome His Excellency Xi Jinping, on his first visit to Australia as President of China, but on his fifth visit to our country.</p>
<p>No Chinese president has ever known more about Australia than President Xi.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, when he completes his visit to Tasmania, he will have visited every single one of our states and territories. </p>
<p>This President of China, in fact, is more widely travelled in our own country than most Australians.</p>
<p>But it runs in his family.</p>
<p>Thirty five years ago, the President’s father, Xi Zhongxun visited New South Wales as Party Secretary of Guangdong Province. </p>
<p>The President’s father visited markets, farms, ports, docks, factories, schools and research institutes and along with then-New South Wales Premier Neville Wran, he signed a joint declaration on Guangdong-NSW friendship and cooperation – it was the first official sister-state relationship between Australia and China and it was so successful that 80 sister-state and sister-city relationships have subsequently been concluded.</p>
<p>Just as the friendships between our cities and states have flourished, our national friendship and cooperation has grown and prospered.</p>
<p>Xi Zhongxun saw the potential of our two peoples working with each other and learning from each other.</p>
<p>Today, we should also remember the foresight of the father of Australia’s modern relationship with China: Prime Minister Whitlam.</p>
<p>When he established diplomatic relations with China, our two way trade was one fifteen hundredth of what it is today.</p>
<p>So we acknowledge Prime Minister Whitlam, and all the leaders of our countries who have put aside ideology to see Australians and Chinese as people with common interests and shared aspirations to a better life.</p>
<p>Yes, Australia and China have different systems of government; one is a young country, and the other an ancient one being renewed; but we have become a model of how two peoples and two countries can complement each other.</p>
<p>We are testament to the saying that a wise man seeks harmony, not conformity.</p>
<p>In April this year, I saw first-hand Chinese ships and planes working together with Australians (and with Japanese, Koreans and Malaysians), on the sea and in the sky, searching for the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370. </p>
<p>In the saddest of circumstances, our people worked side-by-side to seek resolution to this baffling mystery. </p>
<p>We mourn the loss of the 154 Chinese passengers along with the six Australians and 79 others on board.</p>
<p>To the Chinese families of those who were lost, I promise, I promise we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery. </p>
<p>Two of those on Flight MH370 were Chinese-Australians: two among almost a million Australians of Chinese background.</p>
<p>Chinese people first came to Australia in large numbers during the gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s and not all of them returned home once the diggings were exhausted.</p>
<p>Even before the Great War, there were more than 20,000 Chinese Australians, and at least 198 of them enlisted to fight for King and Country: four won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and 14 won the Military Medal as members of the first Australian Imperial Force.</p>
<p>In every part of our national life, Australians of Chinese ancestry have helped to build our modern nation.</p>
<p>Around this Parliament today, there are Members and Senators of Chinese ancestry.</p>
<p>Professor John Yu is a former Australian of the Year.</p>
<p>Dr Victor Chang was our foremost heart surgeon.</p>
<p>His school report card said: “Victor conquered language difficulty to obtain matriculation, he gave us all an example of persistence and is now doing medicine at the university”.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Chinese in Australia. </p>
<p>All of them form a human arch connecting us to what Prime Minister Menzies first called our ‘near north’.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I led the largest and most high-powered delegation ever to leave this country for the inaugural Australia Week in China: with me were two Ministers, five Premiers and a Chief Minister, the Chairmen or CEOs of companies worth 50 per cent of the value of our stock exchange and hundreds more business people.</p>
<p>Chinese direct investment in Australia (with just 23 million people) is only a little less (on some data) than Chinese direct investment in the United States (with more than 300 million).</p>
<p>This is very significant: we trade with people when we need them; but we invest with people when we trust them.</p>
<p>A relationship might begin with commerce but it rarely ends there, once trust has been established as I believe it has between Australia and China.</p>
<p>Trade and investment has made China wealthy.</p>
<p>The advance of hundreds of millions of Chinese from subsistence to the middle class in just 40 years is probably the greatest material advance in all of human history.</p>
<p>China is richer and stronger and the whole world is richer and stronger as a result.</p>
<p>China is by far Australia’s largest trading partner.</p>
<p>Indeed, China is now the largest trading partner for more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>But trade and investment is just one part of how we help each other.</p>
<p>For at least a decade, over 100,000 Chinese students a year have been learning in our universities and from our experts.</p>
<p>From next year, under the New Colombo Plan, Australia will start to return the compliment with thousands of young Australians soon to be studying in China.</p>
<p>They are our new ambassadors to China and to the region.</p>
<p>The success of Australia’s G20 presidency owes a very great deal to China’s like-minded leadership of APEC over the past year.</p>
<p>Australia was only able to mobilise G20 members to make specific policy commitments to deliver inclusive growth and jobs and freer trade because China was already pursuing similar goals.</p>
<p>On behalf of Australia, I thank President Xi for his personal contribution in Brisbane.</p>
<p>I congratulate China for hosting the G20 in 2016 and I am sure that, under China’s presidency, the world will build on the Brisbane action plan for growth and jobs.</p>
<p>As President Xi told the G20 just two days ago, “if you want to walk fast, walk alone” but “if you want to walk far, walk together”.</p>
<p>This is true of Australia and China; it’s true of Australia and the world because all of us have a long journey to make and only one planet to share.</p>
<p>Our challenge is always to seek the best in each other.</p>
<p>We are all walking into the future and, provided we stay together, there is no limit to how far we might go.</p>
