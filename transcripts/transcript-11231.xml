    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce that The Queen has approved two new medals in the<br />
   Australian system of honours and awards, an Ambulance Service Medal<br />
   and an Emergency Services Medal. These new awards complement the<br />
   existing Australian Police Medal and the Australian Fire Service<br />
   Medal.</p>
<p>  The new medals will recognise distinguished service by the men and women<br />
   of our ambulance and emergency service organisations across the nation.<br />
   The status of the awards will be reflected in their placement in the order<br />
   of precedence of Australian honours and awards together with other civilian<br />
   awards recognising distinguished and meritorious service. Recipients of<br />
   the medals will have an entitlement to the letters "ASM" or "ESM"<br />
   respectively after their name.</p>
<p>  The Emergency Services Medal will be available to members of both<br />
   state emergency services and voluntary emergency organisations.</p>
<p>  Only a strictly limited number of medals will be awarded to members, either<br />
   full-time or part-time, and volunteers each year. These awards provide recognition<br />
   beyond the National Medal that was extended to members of voluntary<br />
   search and rescue groups by the government in August this year to recognise<br />
   long service.</p>
<p>  There are at present 11,000 persons serving in ambulance services in Australia<br />
   and 55,000 in state emergency services together with thousands more who<br />
   serve in voluntary search and rescue groups. The establishment of medals<br />
   to recognise distinguished service in ambulance and emergency services is<br />
   a further instance of this government taking action to recognise those who<br />
   serve, whether on a career or voluntary basis, in times of community and<br />
   personal crisis. Australians value these services highly and it is therefore<br />
   appropriate that those men and women who serve their community selflessly<br />
   and to the highest standards have their achievements marked by the nation.</p>
<p>  On behalf of all Australians, I thank those who serve us in ambulance and<br />
   emergency service organisations and who may now have their distinguished<br />
   service recognised.</p>
