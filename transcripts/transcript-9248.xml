    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Flag issue raised today in Question Time was debated atÂ length on 28 April 1992. At the time the then Leader of the Opposition, DrÂ Hewson, described the issue as a " distraction".</p>
<p>The Australian Flag was first proclaimed in 1953. Before that date there wereÂ three flags available for official use: The Union Jack, British Red EnsignÂ ( with Southern Cross), and the British Blue Ensign ( with Southern Cross),<br />which is the flag as flown today.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's statements today are consistent with the DASÂ publication, The Australian Flag, and are supported by the publication, I, by Ausflag Limited:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">" Australians have not always fought under the present flag. Indeed theÂ only war ( undeclared) where that was definitively the case was theÂ Vietnam War. The Union Jack was the only flag used on our sideÂ during the Boer War, the Union Jack was again predominant in theÂ First World War ( it being the senior flag until 1953). And there wasÂ confusion among the Union Jack, the Defaced Red Ensign and theÂ Defaced Blue Ensign. The famous Changi Flag, which flew at theÂ liberation of Singapore in 1945 was a Red Ensign. The United NationsÂ flag was the flag we fought under in the Korean War".</p>
