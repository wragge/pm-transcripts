LIBERAL PARTY RALLY<br />
BOX HILL, VICTORIA FEBRUARY, 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
( Introduction not recorded)<br />
and in full dignity of robe and office have given<br />
me this warm and cordial welcome to the Municipality of Box Hill.<br />
I don't think that the Mayors of either Malvern or Uaulfield would<br />
have done it with any more grace and dignity than you have done.<br />
( I had tn get in a plug for Higgins. Even Prime Ministers have to<br />
watch their electorates, ladies and gentlemen:)<br />
Mr. Chandler I sat enraptured while I heard you<br />
introduce me to this audience. There is only one problem about<br />
hearing delightful thirs said about yourself and that is that<br />
somehow you are expeoted to live up to them and it is not always<br />
easy to measure up to the specification which one s friends<br />
expound on your behalf. But I do appreciate what you have said<br />
about my long service and apprenticeship in this party service<br />
to this party and apprenticeship to that very great man who in<br />
the judgment of all of us here, has been the outstanding political<br />
figure in the history of our nation. And what a model for any<br />
successor to have before his gaze and in his mind as he goes about<br />
the tasks of government.<br />
Well this particular task this morning is a very pleasant<br />
one. I left Canberra and its rain and cold and here we come into<br />
this beautiful late summer morning in Melbourne amongst friends<br />
and colleagues serving together the principles we hoid in common<br />
as fellow Liberals ann oining for the common purposes of policy<br />
that we have presented io the nation. And so I take advantage<br />
of this opportunity to talk over with you some of the things cf<br />
course not more than a selection of the things which could be<br />
discussed mn an occasion such as this, but some of the things in<br />
which we have a mutual interest.<br />
Now first, the Liberal Party itself. Its strength<br />
vigour and vitality I think, is admirably reflected here. It's<br />
not every party that could hope to secure on a Sunday at 1 p. m.<br />
the sort of attendance that I see stretched out before me in this<br />
hall. It's not only a very acceptable tribute to myself I don't<br />
place that by any means at the top of the list-but it is certainly<br />
a reflection of the strength and of the vitality of the Liberal<br />
Party. And this is as it should be because the Liberal Party<br />
carries tremendous responsibilities for the Australia of today,<br />
ad perhaps even more importantly, for the Australia of the years<br />
Ours is a young party as political parties go. It is<br />
only last year that we were celetrating our 21st birthday, We<br />
came into being in 1944 at a time when the non-Labor par ies had<br />
fallen into a sort of state of decay which we see reflected in<br />
the Labor Party at the present time. Sir Robert Manzies and<br />
others of like mind assembled together and they built what has<br />
become the greatest arrty on our side of politics in the history<br />
of the Federation and a party which is as yet in its infancy in<br />
relation to the contribution it is going to make to the national<br />
development, the national strength. But here in the 21 years, / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
we have occupied 16 of those in national leadership and this has<br />
been associated with the grofitest era of development and national<br />
qowth and growth in international influence and prestige that<br />
his country has ever iknoan, and of course the thin s have gone<br />
together. it is the leadership under the distinguished head of<br />
the party, Sir Robert Menzies, that has carried us to this<br />
situation. But Australia has need of the Liberal Party. We had<br />
reached a point in our affairs when we needed a party which<br />
would stand for all sections of the Australian community which<br />
would cast aside once and for all, the old hitter concept of<br />
class warfare tAe stru le between employer and employee; that<br />
would see in the needs of Australia a neea for a party of unity,<br />
a party which could develop a co-operating democracy, with the<br />
national Parliament linked in friendly co-operation with the<br />
Parliaments of the States; not trying to make a Federation work<br />
by imposing authority from the centre or by so construing the<br />
Federal powers that the States were reduced to nothingness, but<br />
a true Federation based upon a spirit of co-operation rather than<br />
on a strict definition of powers. And I believe that we can<br />
claim in Australia today that no country can present a picture to<br />
the world of closer national co-operation at al levels of<br />
government than will be found in the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
There was a need when we took office for a party which<br />
would lead the country into a reat era of growth. Here we were<br />
in Australia with something under 8 millions of people with a<br />
land mass approximately the size of the United States of America,<br />
if we leave Alaska out of the picture, and with tremendous tasks<br />
if with this small population, we were to develop the resources<br />
of the continent and to set briskly about the business of<br />
populating a country by immigration as well as our on natural<br />
inorase agan is a storyof etrendou3 succesa, the<br />

21 y,. irs of lite a Liberal Paty tht cojectives have been<br />
largely realised and the kind of Autralia we set about to create<br />
has been brought into being and suZ-tined.<br />
owi' whether we can SUtin2l iso into the future<br />
depends very largely onr, the co. ntribution, the akill, the judgment,<br />
that you and I as your national leader of the party can comoibne<br />
together to effect. I confidently believe that we of the Liberal<br />
Party are going on to geater strength in the years ahead. Our<br />
best years are ahead of us not behind us, proud though we may be<br />
of the achievement of our hirst twenty-one years.<br />
Now one of the encouragin'. ti ngs for someone in my<br />
situation is to see ho; this Autraian torv of Liberal leadership<br />
is now, reachin: into t he pain. 1cw loeg-er ation of people in<br />
other part of the wld and n in quite receLt \ 7eeks, it<br />
almoot Sems as though tnere has been a fresh discovery of this<br />
country of ours. S* */ 3 </p>
<p>I could perhaps illustrate this process for you by my<br />
own experience of the latter part of this week. I spent a great<br />
deal of time at the United States Embassy because it is through there<br />
that these visitors have been passing, but on Thursday night I dined<br />
there with the management group of " Newsweek", the geat weekly<br />
journal in the United States which ranks with the " Time" publication<br />
as one of the mass circulatin weeklies of the world, and " Newsweek"<br />
is following in the wake of " Time" in setting up its own edition<br />
published in Australia for this part of the world. And the next<br />
day at lunch, there was the management group out here, top-ranking<br />
people from " Time", " Life" and Fortune", and they having established<br />
te " Time" edition in Australia are now turning, I understand to the<br />
publication of an Australian edition of " Life" as well. The following<br />
day, there was the visit of Vice-President Humphrey and this is only<br />
the second time in our history that the Vice-President of the United<br />
States has come to this country. The very fact that he chose to do<br />
so, after the most strenuous tour which he had just undertaken, aain<br />
is a mark of the importance which the United States attaches to what<br />
is occurring out here. On Monday I shall be meeting the Chairman<br />
of the largest bank in New York, the First National ity Bank.<br />
Now I mention these things just as topical illustrations<br />
of the sort of process that is goin on week by week in the Australia<br />
of today. The Ambassador of the United States put it to me this way.<br />
e said, " It is as if our people have just discovered the existence<br />
of Australia and all that E can mean in terms of potential".<br />
My Press Secretary tells me that there are fifteen<br />
interviews with the foreign press lined up when I can get round to<br />
carrying them out, so the interest is not confined to the United States<br />
of America. Now contrast the situation of our own party in all its<br />
vigour and vitality with the unhappy and dolorous situation of the<br />
official Opposition. It is not easy at the moment to sort out just<br />
what form the Opposition takes. Is it an Opposition of the Right or<br />
an Opposition of the Left or just a general scramble? I ask this<br />
question because I was interested to notice that when Mr. Whitlam was<br />
so elaborately pointing out the Kind of Labor Party that he would be<br />
leading, he said he wanted to make it clear that he sought to lead a<br />
radical and socialist party. Now he was making a bid for leadership<br />
somewhat to the right of the Left ' ing, the Left Wing having installed<br />
some of its Parliamentary colleagues, not themselves supported by<br />
the Caucus for those positions, into posts which others who had been<br />
supported by the Caucus posts from which others had been displaced<br />
as the result of the action of the Federal Executive of the party.<br />
The group, not described by me but described rather unkindly b<br />
Mr. Whitlam as the " twelve witiess men", yet I understand two of them<br />
support.. him quite strongly. But those who took up or were supported<br />
to these new posts are said to be men of the Left. Now Mr. ' itlam<br />
by deduction would be regarded as a Labor leader of the Right but<br />
even a Labor leader of the Right feels that the offer he should make<br />
to the electorate is that of leadership of a radical and socialist<br />
party. Now does anybody in their senses, looking arnund the<br />
Australia of today, believe that what Australia wants is a radical and<br />
socialist party. If only the Labor Party would proclaim that quite<br />
frankly and firmly and I was indebted to Mr. Whitlam for doing so<br />
because it hasn't been easy to sort out of their own disarray just<br />
what it is that they do stand for at this time. But if the Right<br />
Wing of the Labor Party declares itself to be for a radical an<br />
socialist party for the Australia of these times, then it is as well<br />
that the Australian public should realise this and reject it as<br />
opportunity offers, as I am quite certain they would wish to do / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Well, I don't intend to spend a great deal of time this<br />
morning on the problems of the Labor Party. I don't rejoice in<br />
a weak Opposition but certainly I am very glad to have the current<br />
majority we enjoy in Parliament, and it will be my objective when<br />
we come to election, to increase that majority as handsomely as<br />
I can succeed in doing. But it is for the Labor Party to either<br />
make its own omelette or unscramble the eggs as best it can.<br />
The incident through which we have * ust passed however,<br />
or are passing, is illuminatng in one important respect for us,<br />
and that is the demonstration it has given to where the centre<br />
of authority lies in the Australian Labor Party under its<br />
Constitution. Now when we spoke in the last election about<br />
" 56 faceless men" di6tating to the Parliamentary Caucus as to<br />
what lines of policy they should follow, we were attacked for<br />
misrepresenting the position as the Labor Party saw it; but we<br />
were clearly right because immediately after the election, Mr.<br />
Whitlam got busy himself in trying to effect some improvement<br />
in the oosition. He has returned to it in this last week or so<br />
and has'gone even further in outlining the embarrassing position<br />
in which the Parliamentary party finds itself. And can any<br />
Parliamentary party in the history of this country have ever been<br />
treated so contemptuously or in such humiliating fashion as the<br />
Parliamentary party of Labor in the Federal sphere.<br />
Now I am glad to report you know it I report it<br />
publicly that from the outset inside our own organisa ion we<br />
adopted firmly the principle that it was not for any outside<br />
organisation to dictate to the elected representatives of the<br />
Australian people as to how they should record their vote inside<br />
the Parliament. Policy discussion certainly; and we have inside<br />
the Liberal Party our own important annual Council meetings and<br />
we have the meetings of the Joint Standing Committee on Policy<br />
and from these discussions and from discussions with the State<br />
Council meetings and the Branch meetings there flows up to the<br />
Federal leadership recommendations of policy which the<br />
Parliamentary Leaaer is able to take into his consideration and<br />
bring before Cabinet as in his judgment he deems it desirable to<br />
do. But nobody seeks to dictate to him or to his Parliamentary<br />
colleagues. The proper role of a Parliament in a democracy is<br />
fully recognised inside the Liberal Party and completely safeguarded<br />
by our Constitution.<br />
Now let me turn from the Labor Party to the problem of<br />
development and defence. I put these two together because they<br />
are linked and it is important that we should clearly see the<br />
relationship the one has to the other. This gives me the<br />
opportunity to state the position in my own terms to a great<br />
audience from the Liberal Party itself and I welcome that<br />
opportunity because, perhaps from the distortion which occurs<br />
when statements are abbreviated in the press I have found that<br />
repeatedly over recent times what I have said on this matter<br />
has been interpreted as a statement by me that there can be no<br />
increase in the Defence vote. Well that, of course, is absurd.<br />
We have increasing obligations as our own resources grow, so<br />
our capacity to do more will grow and we are already currently<br />
co ing with a build-up in the Defence vote a doubling of the<br />
budgetary provision over a four-year perioa and a sizable<br />
increase ahead of us in the next financial year. So we are not<br />
talking in terms of no increase in the Defence vote. What I am<br />
trying to ensure is that the process of development, having so<br />
painstakingly been got under way and sustained through all the<br />
difficulties we have encountered, that this process shall go on<br />
strongly and firmly and itself make, over the years, a contribution<br />
to our capacity to do more by way of defence or to do more<br />
by way of international aid and in the kind of world in which<br />
we live, these things are also linked together. </p>
<p>The talks we have had in recent times have been<br />
extremely helpful to us in helping to form our own ideas as to what<br />
we should be doing. First there was our discussion with the<br />
Minister for Defence in the United Kingdom, Denis Healey, and there<br />
had been rumours that you would have read about in the Press; there<br />
had even been a statement somewhat along these lines from the<br />
shadow Minister for Defence in the Conservative Party to the effect<br />
that the British were withdrawing their forces East of Suez. We<br />
were not prepared to take final decisions about our own defence<br />
planning until we had a clearer view of the British intention and<br />
also a clearer view of the future as seen by the United States in<br />
respect of Viet Nam. But the talks of the last few weeks have<br />
cleared our minds on both these matters and now enable us to go<br />
forward firmly with our own planning. And the discussions that<br />
have taken place over recent weeks in relation to the contribution<br />
we can make in one theatre or another these will be pursued now<br />
quite speedily to a conclusion and I hope then to be able to make<br />
some early announcement about them.<br />
But we were able, as a result of these discussions<br />
with Mr. Healey, I think, to have some substantial influence upon<br />
the British thinking. We were able, as I know the United States<br />
felt it desirable to do also, to emphasise the importance we<br />
attach to a British presence in that area of the world, not<br />
merely for purposes of military security or making a military<br />
contribution against such a matter a, Indonesian confrontation,<br />
but for the moderating influence which the British presence has<br />
there in a restless undecided and uncertain area of the world,<br />
and for the strengthening of morale which results from all this<br />
throughout the South-East Asian area generally. If there were to<br />
be a British withdrawal in this area, I am sure it would have a<br />
quite seriously damaging effect upon morale and, indeed upon the<br />
general security of the area as a whole. Well, fortunately, that<br />
view has been accepted by the United Kingdom. We have been assured<br />
that they will remain in Singapore for as long as they find it<br />
practicable to do so. But it flows from this that with the kind<br />
of contingencies that have to be guarded against it is a sensible<br />
thing to be planning against the possibility that other arrangements<br />
may have to be made at some future point of time. So our<br />
Service people are exploring these possibilities and will be<br />
canvassing them in due course with the representatives of the<br />
United Kingdom. Now in the case of the United States, the value of<br />
Mr. Humphrey's visit could hardly be exaggerated. I don't know<br />
whether any of you had an opportunity to hear him speak yesterday<br />
but his was one of the most powerful and moving public statements<br />
that I think I have heard in a political lifetime. For any<br />
waverers as to the need for us to be in Viet Nam or any who<br />
retain some naive notion that what is going on tAere is some sort<br />
of a civil war which we should be keeping out of and minding our<br />
own business, then the powerful statement of the Vice-President,<br />
has set the record straight. He clearly brought home the<br />
circumstances under which Peking direction, Hanoi direction, are<br />
influencing the course of events in Viet Nam the supplies, the<br />
infiltration, the troops that are moving from The North into that<br />
area the discovery of the underground trenches, cells fully<br />
stocked and equipped with weapons of communist origin and obviously<br />
requiring some years of construction in the thoroughness with which<br />
they have been prepared these things mark the purposefulness, the<br />
determination to expand communist influence throughout that area<br />
of the world. And we believe that not merely is the security of<br />
South Viet Nam involved in this issue but the security of the<br />
whole of the South-East Asian area anA, indeed, properly understood,<br />
this forms part of the challenge, the world challenge which in one<br />
form or another free people have had to meet repeatedly over the<br />
years since the end of the Second World War. To meet in Berlin, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
ti meet in areas of Greece when the civil war, so-called, was<br />
being waged there. As the Vice-President ointed out, it was a<br />
remarkable thing that when Yugoslavia cease to be an area through<br />
which supplies could move to Greece, the civil war collapsed.<br />
Here was a war which in substance was a reflection of the communist<br />
programme of infiltration and subversion which so skilfully has<br />
een carried out in so many parts of the world.<br />
And so we have a clear recognition, in the minds of<br />
the Governments, anyhow, of the United SYates and of this country,<br />
that in Viet Nam is being fought one of the criitical battles for<br />
free peoples throughout he world everywhere. I would hope that as<br />
this real isation spreads amongst those countries, they would find<br />
themselves able to do more than they are doing now if not in the<br />
military field, then in making a contribution to tAe second phase<br />
of the programme there, that of building up in a positive and<br />
constructive way, the community so that there can be a peaceful,<br />
stable and prospering South Viet Nam in the years ahead of us.<br />
Now, the United States has undertaken tremendous<br />
responsibilities in this area. It has felt at times the loneliness<br />
of leadership and I know that it has valued the Australian presence,<br />
the moral support which Australia has brought to it, the comfort<br />
and assurance that Australia sees this issue in the same fashion<br />
and with the same clarity that the President of the United States<br />
has seen it. We are all indebted to him, or should be, for his<br />
resolution, his firmness of purpose his determination to see this<br />
thing through, when in his own country, as in ours, and indeed in<br />
any iemocracy the voice of dissent can be raised. There have been<br />
the critics who have sought to undermine his position because he has<br />
made his own clear decision as to what has to be done in relation<br />
to this threat. Now let me just mention in passing that this small<br />
country of ours we are small in terms of population; sometimes<br />
this tends to be overlooked by nur friends an allies outside. The<br />
Americans tend to see what we are doing in Viet Nam but not pay<br />
very much heed tc what is being done in relation to confrontation<br />
in Malaysia. The British are conscious of the effort we are making<br />
in collaboration with them in respect of Malaysia, but know comparatively<br />
little about what we also in one form or another, are<br />
contributing in Viet Nam. NeitAer of them seem to be very well<br />
aware of what it means to a country that has to develop its own<br />
resources, what it means in terms of national effort to house and<br />
give the amenities of a modern community to the larger population<br />
growth rate that Australia possesses. Uur population is growing<br />
at an increase of 2 per cent. a year. The United Kingdom .8 of<br />
1 per cent. The United States 1.3 er cent and I have been pointing<br />
out to our friends from the United States that if our rate of<br />
population growth were occurring in their country at this time,<br />
hey would Fave tn add to the number of houses built year by year<br />
mnre than 500,000 additional houses. In the United Kingdom, they<br />
would have to add 170,000 additional houses. So that these are<br />
facts of life for us. We can't afford to overlook that growth;<br />
population growth and development create domestic problems for us<br />
ana make heavy demands upon our resources.<br />
Now why we believe that we must go firmly ahead with<br />
this development, this process of population must be regarded as<br />
fundamental to the policies of the nation, is because Australia<br />
has not always enjoyed these opportunities for growth. We sustained<br />
nearly half a million casualties in two world wars. ie encountered<br />
the disastrous depression of the thirties and it is only over the<br />
last twenty years that we have in recent history been able to<br />
embark on a period of sustained growth which must continue if<br />
S. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Australia is to build its own strength and from that strength,<br />
make an increasing contribution to the security and well-being of<br />
others. And we want to have this clearly understood by those<br />
with whom we are associated in friendly alliance in our treaties<br />
and in great tasks together of a humanitarian kind in the various<br />
directions in which we undertake them. Australia has not looked<br />
to a relativity between its contribution and those of its allies<br />
when it comes to international aid. We are a capital-importing<br />
country. Despite this, we rank about fourth amongst all the<br />
countries of the world in the per capita provision we make for<br />
international aid.<br />
Recently there was established an Asian Development Bank<br />
and capital sought was $ 1,000M. to get this institution going so<br />
that finance could be available for projects of a helpful kind<br />
in the countries of Asia. The United States was to contribute<br />
200M.; Japan $ 200M, and Australia is contributing $ 85M., a quite<br />
disproportionate commitment on our part, measured in terms of<br />
population or resources. I mention these facts because we need<br />
not feel when one looks at the record that Australia is failing<br />
to respond in the variety of directions in which around the world<br />
today, people expect to see us making a contribution.<br />
Now when we were established as a nation in 1788, the<br />
United States was then twelve years after the Declaration of<br />
Independence. At the Declaration of Independence, there were<br />
less than 4 million people in the United States of America so<br />
that just 12 years before Australian establishment occurred, there<br />
were less than 4 million people in that mighty country. Today,<br />
while we have been growing, struggling along to get to our 12<br />
millions of people the United States has grown to 190-odd<br />
millions, constituting the most powerful and prosperous nation<br />
on earth. And they have done it by taking in people, taking in<br />
capital down through the years until they are now at such a<br />
position of strength that they in turn have been sending capital<br />
out for investment around the other areas of the world.<br />
We have had a lot of argument in one form or another in<br />
Australia about overseas investment and I hope that at least in<br />
the Liberal Party, we have a clear mind on this matter. I believe<br />
we do from the discussions at the Council Meeting in Canberra<br />
I think it was in the course of last year. We recognise that there<br />
are problems that come when you bring in capital from overseas,<br />
but there are great gains for this country in the diversification<br />
of industry it brings us, the additional techniques which come in<br />
aid of our industrial rowth in the capital equipment which comes<br />
in as part of the capital inflow, and finally, if the enterprise<br />
is successful, and quite apart from the addition to job opportunities<br />
which are created in this way, finally if the enterprise is<br />
profitable and successful there is an Australian dividend from<br />
he taxation of the profits thus earned.<br />
I can illustrate it for you by pointing to the fact that,<br />
say, $ 1M. of profit would carry taxation at the ordinary company<br />
rate of the order of $ 425,000. Of what remains, if the normal<br />
practice were followed and this is how it averages out over the<br />
field of companies about half the remainder would be ploughed<br />
back into that business, providing additional job opportunities<br />
for other Australians or for the migrants who come here seeking<br />
jobs in their turn. And of the balance that might be remitted<br />
overseas then except in the case of the United Kingdom there is<br />
a withholding tax to be paid which on the most favourable basis<br />
would be 15 per cent., and for many companies is of the order of<br />
per cent. And so you can say that out of this $ 1M. of profit,<br />
we the Australian people, have our dividend of just on half a<br />
million dollars, which goes to the purposes of government defence / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
social welfare, education any one of the many tasks which<br />
governments have to undertake, and as tomost of the rest, it is<br />
tloughed back into Australian industr~ widenfing our industrial<br />
aeas the process goes on. iihen I Low of the pains that other<br />
countries go to in their endeavours to attract capital investment<br />
into their economies, I marvel that our own Australian people<br />
aren't the more appreciative of the benefits which this process is<br />
conferring upon us.<br />
We shall be a stronger nation, a better-equipped nation<br />
as a result of these processes than if we had to rely entirely upon<br />
our own savings. We go save and save well, Ninety per cent. of<br />
all the investment in Australia is of our own internal generation,<br />
but the remaining ten per cent. i~ s a very welcome addition and<br />
provides some of the key industries some of the major projects of<br />
a mineral kind. Take th field of the search for oil here it is<br />
the oversea investment; when Australians would be reluctant to<br />
lay nut funds in any dimension in such chancy propositions, it is<br />
this oversea investment which is helping to resolve whether<br />
Australia has the fuel oil resources to sustain itself over the<br />
years ahead. Now I hope when the arguments develop, as they do fiom<br />
time to time, these facts can be kept in mind by our own supporters<br />
in the Liberal Party. It would be very pleasant if we could do<br />
all these things for ourselves but if we try to rely solely on<br />
what we can do for ourselves, t~ hen we must be prepared to accept<br />
a much slower rate of growth and defer for greater peripds of<br />
time, the widening and strengthening of the industrial base of<br />
the nation. Now the final thing I wish to say, Mr. Chairman, is<br />
that just as I mentioned earlier, there seems to be a new disco ery<br />
of Australia taking place around the rest of the world, so also<br />
I believe that par of the reason for this is recognition that we<br />
are on the threshliold of a new chapter of our national history.<br />
WNe have seen the beginnings of it in the dramatic growth of our<br />
trade with Japar and in the view being taken by so ma-ny overseas<br />
industrialists tAat Australia is to be looked to not just as a<br />
domestic market for the suipply of the goods of their manufacture<br />
but as a launching place in order to penetrate the markets and<br />
the customer capacities to be found in the countries of Asia.<br />
That is why many of these overseas concerns are establishing<br />
themselves here. A market of a prospering 12 millions and upwards<br />
is a comparatively small thing against the potential as Asia<br />
industrialises, as the standards rise, as consumption capacity<br />
increases; then here in Australia is a stable base which can be<br />
looked to as a launching point for the markets of this excitin new<br />
area of the world. There is a focus on Asia today such as has<br />
never existed before and in that spotlight Australia is showing<br />
up the more clearly the significant role it has to play.<br />
It is certainly flattering in our ejes, but it is a<br />
reflection of the judgment they make that the Heads of Government<br />
such as the United Kingdom and the Uhited States maintain the<br />
closest contact with us. They honour the Head of an Australian<br />
Government not only with warm friendship but with the closest of<br />
communication and we are in reyular and continuous communication<br />
with the Governments, both of Ce United Kingdom and the United<br />
States. I stress them in particular because quite clearly those<br />
are the countries of the geatest significance for us, and we can<br />
all take some comfort in the strength of our friendship and in<br />
the effectiveness of our co-operation; but for Australia this<br />
opens up a new era of opportunity, a new era of responsibility.<br />
With growing nationhood, we have growing obligations<br />

the more determined we must be that the job of<br />
national leadership will be performed effectively and as the<br />
nation would have it performed.<br />
Now here, you, and those of us in the Parliamentary<br />
party come together for the formation of policies for the<br />
development of a national teamwork which will enable this great<br />
country of ours to take full advantage of the exciting vista that<br />
opens up ahead of us. I for my part feel completely confident<br />
that the Liberal Party will eamsure up in full degree to the<br />
responsibility that falls to it and look forward proudly to<br />
carrying the banner of Liberalism as your leader for many<br />
successful years ahead. </p>
