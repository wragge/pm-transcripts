PRIME MINISTER<br />
MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP. 24 AUGUST 1972<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, quite obviously poverty is going<br />
to be one of the big issues in the election in 1972<br />
You have spoken, and Mr Snedden has spoken, about the<br />
Government's endeavours to stamp out poverty, particularly<br />
in the areas of pensieiners, particularly widows and<br />
aged and invalid pensioners. Now what exactly have you<br />
done?<br />
PM: This covers a pretty broad canvas, but what we<br />
did was to study the Henderson Report on Poverty, a limited<br />
rep6rt though it was, and we tried to ensure that in each<br />
case, that is of aged pension, invalid pension, widow's<br />
peasion, and in the case of a standard family, that at<br />
least we gave them increases in benefitsthtt took them<br />
above the poverty line as defined by Professor Henderson<br />
and his group., The Professor's Report is npt yet fully public,<br />
as I understand it?<br />
Oh yes, it's fully public. It was published<br />
a year or more ago, I believe, but it has been brought<br />
up to date. But what we have done is we have increased<br />
the poverty line in accordance with the movement of, say,<br />
the Consumer Price Index, and we have compared that with<br />
the increases we have made in the -rious benefits.<br />
Prime Minister, one of the suggestions that has<br />
been made this year is that pension benefits should be<br />
tied to the cost of living index in some way rather than<br />
being announced in the B et on an annual basis. Do you<br />
accept this point of view? / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: No, I don't. I think it is better we make up our<br />
mind based upon the Consumer Price Index of the kind of<br />
increase that we should give. But what we have done, and I<br />
think it is much more important, we have gone much further<br />
than the increase in the CPI Index would indicate. As for<br />
example, you take, as it were, a married couple where under<br />
Professor Henderson's criteria they would have got about<br />
$ 19.50, the actual rate for us and if it has been updated<br />
by the Consumer Price Index, would have been about $ 24 or<br />
they will receive about $ 38.50 from us. In other<br />
words, we do better than tying it to the Consumer Price<br />
Index.<br />
Q. How exactly will this $ 38.50 be made up, Prime<br />
Minister?<br />
PM. It will relate to the actual pension rate itself<br />
together with what we call supplementary assistance and<br />
endowment.<br />
Q. I see. The supplementary assistance and endowment<br />
has to be applied for separately is that correct?<br />
Pm. Yes, they have to be.<br />
Q. one of the complaints that I have heard voiced by<br />
people calling Open Line to this station has been that whenever<br />
something like this happens with pensions all that<br />
happens is that such people as the pensioners' landlords take<br />
it away again. Can anything be done about this?<br />
PM. That is difficult because we have no power here, but<br />
what we have done in this Budget is to provide that<br />
supplementary assistance, that is assistance to those<br />
pensioners who have to pay rent, would also be increased by $ 2<br />
to Regrettably, we haven't a direct influence here. I<br />
only wish we had.<br />
Q. Another issue I would like to raise with you this<br />
evening, Prime Minister, is the National Health system. There<br />
have been a number of revolutionary ideas put forward in the<br />
last year about the National Health system. There is, of<br />
course, an alternative Labor scheme and various things like<br />
this. One of the ideas I believe Labor is putting forward is<br />
one for compulsory medical insurance. Can you see that<br />
within a year or two your Government will be interested in<br />
adopting a need for compulsory medical insurance?<br />
PM. . I don't think so. What we are trying to do is to<br />
work with the Australian Medical Association in order to get<br />
a common fee, and we had a committee of inquiry, first of all<br />
it started with Mr. Justice Kerr and then continued when he<br />
went to the Supreme Court, that made recommendations to us<br />
that would bring the doctors' remuneration was increased but<br />
also had the effect of ensuring that the patients themselves<br />
were protected to the maximum extent. In other words, that<br />
if we in government were prepared to pay an additional amount<br />
to the medical practitioner for the common fee, it would<br />
overcome the necessity of the patients themselves having to<br />
make an additional coantribution. We believe that with the<br />
AMA that now has the power to recommend and to decide upon<br />
common fees for domiciliary attention, for attention in the </p>
<p>surgery, or for major surgical operations, we believe if we can<br />
S get an accommodation and agreement with the AMA, that this will<br />
really make the National Health $ cheme, whether for hospital<br />
or medical attention, not only well balanced but in the best<br />
interests of the patient.<br />
Q. One final point, Prime Minister, with the National<br />
Health Scheme, is the Government looking at all at the<br />
possibility of insurance for the cost of dental care or<br />
various ancilliary services like the cost of glasses and<br />
things like this?<br />
PM: We have had a look at them on several occasions,<br />
not in this Budget because we thought there were other<br />
matters to which we had to give very urgent attention. We<br />
decided in the past that it was a little too difficult to<br />
supervise and for that reason we have not gone ahead with it.<br />
But this is a matter more, I believe, for my colleague, the<br />
Minister for Health, than it is for me. I will certainly<br />
direct your question to him as soon as I get back into the<br />
House.<br />
Q. That is very kind of you, Prime Minister. Thank<br />
you % ery much. 41.. i4
