    <content><![CDATA[<p>Following agreement from all state and territory governments, I can today release the report of, and COAG response to, the Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) National Inquiry on Bushfire Mitigation and Management.</p>
<p>I announced this National Inquiry on 10 October 2003 and the report of the Inquiry, chaired by Mr Stuart Ellis AM, was provided to me in April 2004.  All state and territory governments have carefully considered the recommendations and have now agreed a joint response with the Federal Government.  Although the report and response have not been released until today, all states and territories have been able to use the report as a basis for planning responses to bushfires.  The report and response are available from the COAG website at <a href="http://www.coagbushfireinquiry.gov.au">www.coagbushfireinquiry.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>The report includes 29 recommendations to improve bushfire preparedness.  Eight of these recommendations have already been implemented.  This includes continued national funding for fire fighting aircraft and development of agreements for emergency broadcasting with the ABC.</p>
<p> My Government announced funding of $16.5 million over three years in the 2004-05 Budget for the National Aerial Fire Fighting Centre.  I also announced in September 2004 that the Australian Government would provide $24 million over the next three years towards national bushfire preparedness.  This funding is in addition to the Australian Government's commitment of $68.5 million for the Natural Disaster Mitigation Programme, announced in the 2003-04 Budget, which brings the total allocation for the programme between 2003-04 and 2007-08 to $103.3 million.</p>
<p>The report focuses on opportunities to improve national cooperation and management of fire fighting resources.  We can not prevent bushfires but we can be better prepared so we minimise their impact on life and property.  The report highlights the need for a better understanding of risk, a greater focus on mitigation and better cooperation across jurisdictions.  The Council of Australian Governments has decided that the Augmented Australasian Police Ministers' Council will have a lead role in coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the report's recommendations.</p>
<p>I wish to acknowledge the cooperation of the states and territories in this process and to thank all those, especially the volunteers around the country, who fight to save lives and property.  The recent terrible tragedy on the Eyre Peninsula, and the fires around Perth, should increase our resolve to ensure we are all better prepared to meet the threat of bushfires.  </p>
