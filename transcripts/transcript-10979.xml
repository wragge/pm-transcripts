<p>Well, thank you very much, Colin, to Mark and Judy, to Richie Benaud,</p>
<p> to John and Veronica Fordham, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is not really a chore for me, can I say that it is a great pleasure.</p>
<p> There are many things that one is invited to in one's political</p>
<p> life that you perhaps wonder sometimes whether you're going to</p>
<p> enjoy the experience. But to be invited to be here today to share,</p>
<p> for a couple of minutes, my thoughts about a remarkable Australian,</p>
<p> a great Australian cricketer and a great Australian captain, is an</p>
<p> enormous privilege. And I want to thank the Sydney Daily Telegraph</p>
<p> for giving me the opportunity of doing so.</p>
<p>It is true that we had a very early start to Cabinet this morning</p>
<p> and it is true that a few people remarked on the brusque way in which</p>
<p> I despatched some of the business so that it would  but the</p>
<p> decisions were still very good  so that I could be here. And</p>
<p> when Richie Benaud got up to speak he put me in mind of another important</p>
<p> commitment of mine that I sort of longed to be over so I could get</p>
<p> out to watch an encounter in which he was involved. And I recall that</p>
<p> my very last law exam at Sydney University, I did on the morning of</p>
<p> the first day of, I think, the third Test between the West Indies</p>
<p> in Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. A match in which, I think,</p>
<p> Garfield Sobers scored a fine 168. And after the exam was over I raced</p>
<p> out to the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch the match. So my connection</p>
<p> with the game is spontaneous and genuine and absolutely devoted. I</p>
<p> frequently said that about the greatest office anybody can aspire</p>
<p> to is to be captain of the Australian Cricket Team. And there is a</p>
<p> special bond between a sports-loving Australian public and the captain</p>
<p> of the Australian Cricket Team. There's nothing quite like it.</p>
<p> It's a function of the fact that it is our national game and</p>
<p> it's a function of the fact that cricket and those who've</p>
<p> led Australia into battle on the cricket field have always occupied</p>
<p> a very special place in the hearts of Australians.</p>
<p>Mark Taylor's cricketing prowess is well known to a gathering</p>
<p> like this. It is extraordinary, it's exemplary and it ranks him</p>
<p> amongst the very greatest players that cricket has seen from any nation.</p>
<p> But I think there are two characteristics about him that have really</p>
<p> endeared him to the Australian public above and beyond his capacity</p>
<p> as a player. And the first of those is that he's a great fighter.</p>
<p> Everyone knows that he went through a valley of criticism and despair</p>
<p> at a time when people were being very critical of him but he never</p>
<p> lost his nerve. He never lost his calm. He never lost his resolve</p>
<p> and, very importantly, he never lost his civility and that is a great</p>
<p> tribute to him.</p>
<p>I can remember on the evening before the Adelaide Test at the beginning</p>
<p> of last year at a time when there was a lot of criticism of him. I</p>
<p> happened to be in Adelaide for a meeting and I then found that I was</p>
<p> able to go to the game later on. And I rang him to wish him well and</p>
<p> his response was that of a person who understood the criticism, was</p>
<p> determined to prove it wrong but wasn't complaining about some</p>
<p> of the unreasonable things that were being said about him. And I think</p>
<p> it was that characteristic and that quality that endeared him to millions</p>
<p> of Australian and world cricket lovers.</p>
<p>And I think the other quality which was really demonstrated on that</p>
<p> morning in Pakistan only a few weeks ago when he really did play out</p>
<p> the finest traditions of the game. And I had the opportunity of getting</p>
<p> through to him on the telephone at his hotel to congratulate him on</p>
<p> the tremendous score that he'd achieved and I asked him what</p>
<p> he thought he was going to do and he said he thought he'd pull</p>
<p> up the stumps. And, of course, he went on to do that. And he was putting</p>
<p> his team first but he was also honouring the traditions of the game.</p>
<p> And I think what Mark has done is to remind all of us and to remind</p>
<p> particularly the young lovers of cricket that of course we strive</p>
<p> to achieve, we strive to be the best, we strive to be the world record</p>
<p> holder but we also honour the best traditions of the game. And he's</p>
<p> taught us that there is nothing incompatible with personal achievement,</p>
<p> personal success, decent financial remuneration as a consequence of</p>
<p> that achievement and success but also honouring the great traditions</p>
<p> that are associated with wearing the finest head apparel in the world</p>
<p> and that is the baggy green of the Australian Cricket Team.</p>
<p>So, Mark, you have done us all proud. You've been a wonderful</p>
<p> cricketer. I hope you continue to give inspiration and leadership</p>
<p> to Australian cricket for many years into the future. As one of your</p>
<p> very constant supporters and fans over a long period of time it gives</p>
<p> me immense pride and satisfaction and pleasure to be here today. And</p>
<p> I know to cross all of the boundaries that might otherwise divide</p>
<p> Australians on other issues and say on behalf of all Australians how</p>
<p> much we admire and respect what you have done. Sport does dissolve</p>
<p> the barriers in Australian society, sport unites us all. Nothing quite</p>
<p> binds the Australian community together like the love of sport, the</p>
<p> love of a great Australian sportsman or woman and a great sporting</p>
<p> achievement, whatever the sport may be. And we've had those in</p>
<p> abundance. To have succeeded in Pakistan in both Test cricket and</p>
<p> one day cricket and to have seen this astonishing achievement of yours,</p>
<p> Mark, has really given us an absolute feast of cricket enjoyment and</p>
<p> cricket pleasure. So on behalf of, not just of myself and of my political</p>
<p> colleagues on both sides of the House, because there are cricket lovers</p>
<p> on both sides of politics as there naturally are throughout different</p>
<p> sections of the community, I say thank you for what you have done</p>
<p> for Australian cricket. Thank you for being such a fine Australian</p>
<p> Captain, of having honoured and kept and elevated the finest values</p>
<p> of the game and thank you, most importantly, for being a wonderful</p>
<p> Australian.</p>
