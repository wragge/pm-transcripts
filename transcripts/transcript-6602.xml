TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE 4 MARCH 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I have had conveyed today to the representatives of the<br />
government of the United States and New Zealand that Australia as<br />
the host government for the proposed July meeting of the ANZUS<br />
Council, it was decided that that meeting should be postponed<br />
indefinitely. That decision had been made-necessary as a result<br />
of the situation that has arisen following the decision of the New<br />
Zealand Government in regard to the United States Naval vessels.<br />
It became clear as things developed that it was unlikely that that<br />
meeting could in any practical sense go ahead. The United States<br />
conveyed to me in Washington that they could not see the<br />
attendance at such a meeting as practical. We could un~ derstand<br />
that postion. And indeed I would say that I believe that the New<br />
Zealand Government itself must have foreseen following its<br />
decision that this position would be likely to arise. We, of<br />
course, have the pre-eminent responsibility as a government to<br />
ensure that the essential security interests of Australia are<br />
protected. This will be done by appropriate bilateral<br />
arrangements between us and the United States and between us and<br />
New Zealand. And I believe that I will be in a position later<br />
this week to make announcements as to those arrangements that will<br />
be made. Throughout this position that has arisen following the<br />
decision of the New Zealand government, I and my Government have<br />
been committed at all points to trying to ensure the protection of<br />
Australia's national security interests. WE have been consistent<br />
at all points throughout and I ask that people contrast the<br />
consistency of the Australian Government position with the<br />
nonsensical and inconsistent and political opportunism of the<br />
Leader of the Opposition. He has said today, that, he hFs argued<br />
all along that Australia should use every pressure available on<br />
both the United States and New Zealand to ensure and indeed an<br />
earlier meeting take place because the role of Australia now ought<br />
to be one of mediating, trying to get the parties together. I<br />
hope it will not have escaped your attention, I believe it will<br />
not escaped the attention of the Australian public, that indeed Mr<br />
Peacock was last year was pursuing exactly the opposite position.<br />
He was saying that Australia should move in, discard New Zealand<br />
and work for the establishment of a bi-laterial relationship. I<br />
content myself with quoting from the transcript the Leader of the<br />
opposition's speech on the 16 October which goes to the AM program<br />
where it was said, the Opposition Leader, Mr Peacock ' has made<br />
foreign policy one of his first targets, and his guns are aimed </p>
<p>directly at New Zealand." Mr Peacock said, Liberal<br />
Government would give New Zealand just three months," this is on<br />
the 16th of October, ." would give New Zealand just three months to<br />
lift its ban on nuclear warships and if New Zealand elected not to<br />
to anything in this he said then a Liberal Government<br />
would try to negotiate a new bi-lateral treaty with the United<br />
States to replace the ANZUS pact. So his position then was let's<br />
shoot New Zealand down, let's have a bi-lateral pact. Now he is<br />
saying we should be negotiating with the United States and New<br />
Zealand. The facts are clear and they are unarguable and that is<br />
that it is totally impractical in the current circumstances that<br />
such a meeting can proceed. Therefore in those circumstances, it<br />
is, as I repeat, the pre-eminent responsibility upon this<br />
Government which I will discharge, of ensuring that this country's<br />
security are protected by the appropriate arrangements to be made<br />
between us and the United States and between us and New Zealand.<br />
I would add finally that it is the common position of the three<br />
treaty partners, that the treaty remains in place but until such<br />
time as normal operations can be resumed under the treaty then we<br />
will ensure that our interests are protected in the only way that<br />
they can be done appropriate bi-lateral arrangements.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will this mean separate meetings with the US and New<br />
Zealand?<br />
PM: Yes,*-it will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Ministei'r, this time Australia is making<br />
decisions as the host country, so is the situation, this time<br />
Australia and not the United States is punishing New Zealand?<br />
PM: No, it is not a question of Australia punishing New Zealand.<br />
It is a total misinterpretation of the situation. My statement<br />
makes it clear that as a result of the decision by New Zealand<br />
itself, and the reaction of the United States, that it simply<br />
would not be practical for a meeting to go ahead. The United<br />
States made it clear that it could not attend a meeting in these<br />
circumstances, we understand that position and I repeat I believe<br />
that New Zealand must have foreseen that once it made that<br />
decision, you can't have a continuation of a alliance relationship<br />
if an essential element of that relationship comes to an end. It<br />
is not a question of punishing. Indeed, we will continue to have<br />
bi-lateral relations with New Zealand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given the fundamental difference of<br />
opinion over nuclear ships between the United States and New<br />
Zealand, how is it that you can say here, that it needs to be<br />
emphasised at this point, is not in dispute between any of the<br />
ANZUS partners?<br />
PM: Well, because it is the fact. And if facts are clear and<br />
simple and straighforward, they should not be in dispute. Because<br />
the United States says the treaty remains, we say the trea ty<br />
remains, New Zealand says the treaty remains. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What is the treaty now, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Well the treaty * is a document which sets out relationships<br />
between the three treaty partners. Now one of the treaty partners<br />
has made a decision in regard to the defence relationship, that an<br />
element of that, that is the availability of its ports to the<br />
naval vessels of another, that is the United States, will not be<br />
there. And in those circumstances what has been regarded as an<br />
essential element of--the defence relationships is not operating.<br />
The United States has responded to that. And so, in those<br />
circumstances the actual operations, previous operations, existing<br />
operations, of the treaty are not in fact operating. That does<br />
not mean that the treaty itself does not exist. I mean I would<br />
have thought that that is self-evident.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you saying it exists but is not<br />
operating? PM: I am saying it exists but is not operative in respect of the<br />
significant elements of it, which had previously been operating<br />
and without being exhaustive, the tni-lateral exercises are not<br />
operating, there has been a decision to cease the exchange of<br />
intelligence. These important aspects are simply not operative<br />
now. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in addition to the ANZUS treaty as it<br />
now exists, will you now be seeking a mutual defence pact. with the<br />
United States?<br />
PM: I don't believe that that is a necessity because what the<br />
United States has made clear is that they regard the relationship<br />
between the United States and ourselves as still operative.<br />
Perhaps I can make it best, most clear to you, by reading to you<br />
what the Secretary of State Shultz said on the 20th of February,<br />
which goes precisely to this point. He issued a press statement<br />
which included the following statement. " I am pleased by the<br />
announcement of Prime Minister Hawke of Australia on 19th of<br />
February that his Cabinet had reaffirmed Australia's support for<br />
the ANZUS Alliance and for the full responsibilities that the<br />
alliance entails. We note that the Prime Minister describes ship<br />
visits and US/ Australian joint facilities as continuing<br />
fundamentals to the Australian/ United States alliance<br />
relationship. We welcome these reaffirmations of Australia's<br />
commitment to its ties with the United States." Now when you take<br />
that into account, his statement of the 20th of February, with<br />
what was also said by thePresident of the United States when we<br />
were there earlier in February, it is quite clear as far as the<br />
United States is concerned, as it is clear as far as Australia is<br />
concerned, the operational defence relationship between us remains<br />
intact. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will there be formal ministerial<br />
level meetings between Australia and New Zealand under ANZUS in<br />
future? When do you expect they might take place? Will they take<br />
place annually? Are there any arrangements<br />
PM: I have said earlier in this conference that I will be in a<br />
position later this week to make a statement as to the, both in<br />
respect of the United States and Australia, and in respect of<br />
Australia and New Zealand, precisely the form of discussion that<br />
will take place. But they will be bi-lateral.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime MInister, did the Americans tell you in what way<br />
it would impractical for them to sit down and talk to New Zealand<br />
in an ANZUS Council meeting?<br />
PM: NO they didn't go into detail, but I would suggest that<br />
developments since then make it clear that if you have cut off<br />
intelligence communications from one party to the other then in<br />
the nature of things it is going to be pretty difficult to sit<br />
down and have discussions about the range of issues which in<br />
themselves would tend to be covered by such intelligence<br />
information.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, in your view is there any significant element of<br />
the ANZUS treaty which is operative at the moment?<br />
PM: I think you would have to say that in so far as ANZUS was a<br />
tni-lateral relationship, that no there is virtually nothing of it<br />
which is operative now. And I say in operative terms, having<br />
emphasised that the treaty itself is, remains there. Now, my<br />
obligation on behalf of the people of Australia, that in a<br />
situation brought about as a result of a dispute and a difference<br />
between the other two treaty partners, that we do everything we<br />
can do ensure that our essential national security interests are<br />
maintained. And that is what we have done, and what we will<br />
continue to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, is it a concept now rather than a treaty?<br />
PM: It is a treaty. I mean, I don't know how many times one has<br />
to give an answer.. I think if you look at the transcripts of what<br />
I have said before you will get the answer to your question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you ever consider putting the argument<br />
to the United STates that an ANZUS Council meeting might have been<br />
another opportunity to seek some sort of creation..<br />
PM: Now what I indicated when it was put to me in Washington that<br />
the United States, as it saw it then, could not see its way clear<br />
to participate, was that we said we could understand that<br />
position. But I said I would have to discuss this matter-with my<br />
CAbinet colleagues when I returned to Australia. I also recall </p>
<p>1<br />
that at that point Michelle, the decision had not been made by the<br />
United States in regard to what they would in fact do about<br />
intelligence sharing. It was only subsequently that that decision<br />
was made. Now I and my colleagues have as I indicated to the<br />
United STates that I would do, we have considered-this matter and<br />
we agree that in all those circumstances, as I say a meeting of<br />
the ANZUS Council is not practicable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, although you say that the ANZUS treaty does<br />
remain now, is it not a fact that even if the United STates wanted<br />
to unilaterally withdraw, under the terms of ANZUS it would not be<br />
able to do so immediately.<br />
PM: But you keep getting into situations which are not relevant.<br />
I repeat I think for the third time, that the. United States has<br />
made it clear that that is not a course of action that they want<br />
to do. So that it can, and hopefully I won't need to say it<br />
again, the position of the United States is that they are not<br />
talking about withdrawing from the treaty. They are not talking<br />
about tearing up the treaty. Now that is the fourth time. I hope<br />
it's clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you feel Mr Lange's current international odyssey<br />
in both in what he is saying and doing, is actually further<br />
undermining the spirit and character of ANZUS or threatens to?<br />
PM: I don't want to make any comment on what you refer to as Mr<br />
Lange's odyssey.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there is implicit criticism on criticism of<br />
New Zealand and support of the United States in the statements<br />
that you have been making. Would you agree that the United States<br />
unilaterally upgrade or have changed the meaning of the treaty by<br />
insisting that the two other parties accept nuclear armed ships?<br />
PM: No, that is an interpretation which is entirely without<br />
foundation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that important sections of the<br />
Treaty are now not operative, is Australia less secure than we<br />
were before?<br />
PM: No, we are-certainly not-less secure. Again I would have<br />
thought it was clear by now, but again I will repeat it, that as<br />
far as the United States is concerned, their relationship, the<br />
rights and obligations which apply between our two countries,<br />
remain operative. There has been no diminution in that at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is New Zealand less secure?<br />
PM: Well, that is ultimately a judgement that New Zealand has to<br />
make as to whether it is less secure and I don't think that the<br />
situation would be assisted by a gratuitous observation from<br />
myself as to whether they are less secure. We have adopted the </p>
<p>6<br />
consisted position, as distinct from the Leader of . the Opposition<br />
who has jumped from one position to another on this seri'ous matter<br />
from the end of last year. We have adopted a consistent position<br />
throughout that is that we are not goin g to attempt to interfere<br />
with the decisions of New Zealand or of the United States. Our<br />
pre-eminent and continuing responsibility has been the protection<br />
of our national security interests.<br />
PM: Mr Hawke, why does the Australian Government as the host of<br />
the ANZUS Council choose to make the announcement of the<br />
cancellation, rather than leave it to the US Government who didn't<br />
choose to participate?<br />
PM: Because we are the hosts. We are the ones who issue the<br />
invitations. Now what we have got to and that is on a<br />
rotational basis. It was our turn to host this year and now we<br />
have got to deal with the realities. I am not in the business of<br />
trying to play political advantage in this, as I keep repeating.<br />
What we have got to do is to make sure that we make decisions that<br />
ensure that Australia's real interests are protected. Now the<br />
realities are that the Council could not in any effective sense go<br />
ahead. Therefore, we as a Government have to be in a position to<br />
go ahead and make the bilateral arrangements with the United<br />
States and bilateral arrangements with New Zealand. Now, you<br />
can't go ahead and finalise and organise your bilateral<br />
relationships if you are still deluding yourself and deluding<br />
other people that the other meeting is going to go ahead. It<br />
could not go ahead. There is no reasonable, practical effective<br />
way in which it could go ahead, so that had to be cleared out of<br />
the way and let's get on with-the business of dealing with how we<br />
are going to protect Australia's interests in this bilateral<br />
fashion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did the United States make it clear to us<br />
that if we decided to go ahead with the meeting, they would not<br />
attend ( inaudible)&gt;<br />
PM: I made it clear that they said that they could not attend a<br />
meeting in those circumstances.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you seek the views of the New Zealand Government<br />
before deciding?<br />
PM: In the sense that I am not trying to tell New Zealand what<br />
to do, the reciprocal is that I am not conducting my affairs on<br />
the basis that I have to get my decisions cleared with New Zealand<br />
or with anyone else. My responsibility is to Australia. I have<br />
got to deal with this in terms of how you are going to protect<br />
Australia's interests in a context created by the decisions of<br />
others, about their bilateral relations, now the New Zealand<br />
Government made a decision. There was an inevitable reaction from<br />
the United States. As I say, I can't believe that New Zealand<br />
could not have been aware that this is the sort of positi-on that<br />
could have been arrived a-t, but in the circumstance created by </p>
<p>others, then we have, as I say I repeat a pre-eminent<br />
responsibility of taking action to ensure the protection of<br />
Australia's interests and that is what we will always do, as<br />
distinct, I repeat, from Mr Peacock who tries to play politics in<br />
this in October and say, destroy New Zealand. Go for a bilateral<br />
treaty. And then in March says, no don't do that. Negotiate<br />
together to keep them together when it can't be done. That is not<br />
what we are about. We are about the real decisions that have to<br />
be made in this real world.<br />
JOURNALIST: So Mr Hawke, are you hoping now to be rid of this<br />
matter, or are you hoping that it is now a matter between New<br />
Zealand and the United States?<br />
PM: It's not a question of being rid of this matter. I repeat<br />
that the dispute as to whether ships of the United States go into<br />
New Zealand is between the United States and New Zealand. I have<br />
never been possessed or seized of the matter, never, because it<br />
has always been a matter between the United States and New<br />
Zealand. So how can I get rid of something of which I have never<br />
been seized.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think there is something odd, Prime Minister,<br />
for the fact that your Prime Minister is out tripping through<br />
Indo-China.<br />
PM: I haven't got a Prime Minister tripping through Indo-China.<br />
It may be that wish may be father to the thought, I accept.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your Foreign Minister is tripping through Indo-China<br />
proposing a role for Australia as a mediator in a conflict which<br />
( inaudible) but our two major allies doorstep.<br />
PM: You always want to be very, very careful about argument by<br />
analogy to make sure that there is an analogy. There is not one<br />
in the circumstances to which you refer. As far as the position<br />
in Indo-China is concerned, there is no treaty relationship with a<br />
situation where one party to the treaty has said this is not<br />
operative and the other has said in those circumstances there is a<br />
certain reaction. Now, in the case of Indo-China we have got the<br />
position where we have certainly an interest in the area. Our<br />
interest in the area has been welcomed by all parties concerned.<br />
Already, Bill Hayden, the Foreign Minister, has played a useful<br />
and constructive role which has been welcomed by others where he<br />
has been acting, as he has, on behalf of our Government. It would<br />
be quite silly and counter-productive for us to say because you<br />
have got some problem in regard to ANZUS that you are not going to<br />
continue there. The ANZUS relationship is one thing. We deal<br />
with that as it stands. It is in no way analagous to what is<br />
happening there. It is entirely appropriate that Mr Hayden should<br />
continue the discussions he is having there and we will continue<br />
to have them because if there is any way in which in those<br />
circumstances we can help to play some role, however small, in<br />
trying to bring that problem to an end, we will do-it. </p>
<p>I, 8<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in the weeks since your talks with Mr<br />
Shultz have you sought to warn New Zealand that the ANZUS Council<br />
was in jeopardy?<br />
PM: I didn't need to be a messenger. I made it-clear that we<br />
are not a messenger. I said right from the beginning that that is<br />
not how we see our role. You don't believe there haven't been<br />
discussions between the United States and New Zealand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe that the US has handled this whole<br />
matter with the utmost sensitivity?<br />
PM: I am not here to make judgements, as I said to Max Walsh<br />
about odyssies of one leader around the world, nor am I here to<br />
make judgements about the United States. I have made it clear in<br />
my opening statement that we indicated that we understand the<br />
reaction of the United States in this matter and I don't think<br />
there is anything to add to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, would it be reasonable to conclude<br />
that you discussed the inevitable consequences of this action by<br />
New Zealand with Mr Lange when you talked with him at thc South<br />
Pacific Forum?<br />
PM: Well I talked with Mr Lange before the South Pacific Forum<br />
and at the South Pacific Forum wie didn't go into any further<br />
details on this matter. I have simply said here that the<br />
Government of New Zealand has made a decision early in the piece<br />
on this matter. I can't believe that in their consideration of<br />
the decisions they have taken and to which they have adhered,<br />
that they have not addressed their minds to the likely<br />
repercussions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, has the United States been just<br />
withdrawing its intelligence New Zealand, in other words to<br />
cut off Australian intelligence?<br />
PM: Well I invite you to have a look at the transcript of the<br />
press conference I had on that matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why was this decision made now rather than closer to<br />
July.. PM: Well I have already answered that question. Let me repeat<br />
it. Our responsibility is to look after and advance Australia's<br />
national security interests in the real world with which it is<br />
faced. It is quite clear that the trilateral meeting can't go<br />
ahead and that the trilateral relations are not operative. Now<br />
that is the reality. Now, are you suggestig that knowing that<br />
that is the reality I should say, oh well, perhaps a star will<br />
appear in the sky and something might change that real world<br />
situation. We have got to live in that real world situation, so I<br />
have got to be in a position my Foreign Minister, my Defence<br />
Minister have to be in the position to discuss with the United </p>
<p>States what are the arrangements, how are we going. to operate now<br />
in that real world. We have to do the same with New Zealand. it<br />
would be a gross dereliction of duty if faced with that reality, I<br />
said, well I will delay making the arrangements which are<br />
necessary to be made in Australia's interests.<br />
* JOURNALIST: Is it also the reality that the operations of ANZUS<br />
will remain dormant until there is a change of government in New<br />
Zealand?<br />
PM: No, that question has been put to me before. I am not in<br />
the business of saying there has got to be a change of government.<br />
It may be. I don't know. It may be that this Government in New<br />
Zealand could change its position. I don't know.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the New Zealand Government doesn't change its<br />
position, would it be in Australia's security interests for that<br />
government to be defeated?<br />
PM: oh.<br />
* JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when do we get the Beazley/ Hayden papers<br />
on ANZUS?<br />
/ PM: When do we or when does the Cabinet. I mean, who should get<br />
them first. I mean, do you mind if we get them first?<br />
JOURNALIST: I don't mind ( inaudible).<br />
PM: No, well you have got your own arrangements about that<br />
presumably. We, the Cabinet, expect to get them next week. We<br />
hope to.<br />
: 4* JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you concerned that the conflict<br />
between the US and New Zealand is damaging to the security of the<br />
South Pacific region as a whole?<br />
PM: Well, Geoff, let me answer it this way. I think obviously<br />
everyone would have a greater sense of continuity if this problem<br />
hadn't arisen, but I would think that the countries of the South<br />
Pacific would feel, no, from the statements that have been made in<br />
the United States and by myself that as far as the relationship<br />
between the United States and Australia is concerned, they remain,<br />
as I have said, undiminished. So there will be that sense of<br />
continuity. As far as the relationships between Australia and New<br />
Zealand are concerned, we will attempt to keep them in the best<br />
possible shape. So as far as the South Pacific area generally is<br />
concerned, I don't believe there is any reason for concern. There<br />
would have been a reason for concern if this Govenrment had<br />
followed the vacillating policies of the Opposition who one day<br />
a are arguing destroy ANZUS and then another start trying to mediate<br />
in the situation which is unmediatable, but where the countries of<br />
the South Pacific can see the consistency of position that has<br />
been followed by the Australian Government and our commitment to </p>
<p>ensuring that the relationships with the United Sta-tes remain<br />
intact and that we will do our best to do the same thing* with New<br />
Zealand, I don't think in those circumstances there is cause for<br />
concern on their part.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, why do you assume it is unmediatable if<br />
Australia hasn't tried?<br />
PM: It is not a question of not having tried. If you have the<br />
position where as a result of the decision of the New Zealand<br />
Government an important element of the relationship has come to an<br />
end the access of ports for their ships and the United States<br />
in those circumstances has said that it could not and would not<br />
participate in the meeting. And you have the position that New<br />
Zealand is saying, well, no that is it's position. It is not<br />
changing, then you can't mediate a position where the two parties<br />
are saying that is our position.<br />
JOURNALIST: If no-one tries. I mean, you were ACTU President. I<br />
mean, I am sure were faced with similar..<br />
PM: Well, again I warned before about analogies. If you<br />
believe that in a situation talking about the national security<br />
interests of this country, that you are going to say, no, I will<br />
attempt now to interfere in the decision-making process in New<br />
Zealand and I will attempt to interfere in the decision-making<br />
process in the United States, then you are pressing an analogy<br />
which is not sustainable. I mean, which way do you want it. Do<br />
you want it that Australia is going to try and pressure New<br />
Zealand. I mean, what I have been told before and I understand it<br />
and accept it, is that New Zealand is a sovereign foreign country<br />
and that it is not Australia's position to be trying to push New<br />
Zealand around. I have certainly, I mean not that I am an avid<br />
reader of everything that you write if you can accept that<br />
without any disrespect but that certainly has been the position<br />
that you have espoused. Now you can't have it both ways. You<br />
can't be arguing that Australia should be staying aloof from,<br />
leaving this independent nation of New Zealand there to make its<br />
own decision and at the same time saying, oh no, you should be<br />
interfering to get them to change to accommodate to the United<br />
States. In international relationships where two countries make<br />
their position clear on what they regard as a matter of<br />
fundamental impor tance, that is it. There are other areas where<br />
countries concerned can indicate that there is room for manoeuvre,<br />
that there is hope for discussion. Going back to the analogy<br />
that was pressed before in regard to Indo-China, if you want to<br />
say that the two sides roughly in the Indo-China dispute -on the<br />
one hand Vietnam and on the other the ASEAN group there both<br />
sides have indicated that they welcome the involvement of<br />
Australia. It's not a question of dogmatic positions with no room<br />
for positive discussion. They have welcomed and said, perhaps<br />
there is room. That is not the position here. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Just to take you back to that answer. you gave Geoff<br />
over there about the South Pacific.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your words were that you see the relationship<br />
between the US and Australia remains undiminished.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Then you went on to say as far as New Zealand and<br />
Australia are concerned, we will attempt to keep it in the best<br />
possible shape.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are we to infer from that that our relationship is<br />
diminished, as you see it?<br />
PM: No, what I am saying is that there have got to be further<br />
discussions with New Zealand anid Australia. Those discussions I<br />
will be able, as I say, later in this week to spell out. There<br />
hasn't been, therefore, at this stage, any statement by New<br />
Zealand of its reaction to the position. I was able to quote<br />
precisely from the administration in the United States as to what<br />
the position was. There is no corresponding statement to which<br />
You should read no more into it than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Australia informed New Zealand that the July<br />
Council meeting is off indefinitely because the Americans w-. on't<br />
come, or had Washington already told them?<br />
PM: No. Washington could not have told New Zealand because the<br />
Ambassador of the United States and the High Commissioner for New<br />
Zealand were both informed just before 4 o'clock this afternoon.<br />
JOURNALIST: So this treaty as a tripartite agreement remains<br />
indefinitely a treaty in name only?<br />
PM: Well, I believe that that is not an unfair description<br />
because if in fact a treaty which is a trilateral treaty and under<br />
which certain operations have been going on if those operations<br />
are no longer going on then I guess in some sense that is not an<br />
unfair description. But I do want to emphasise consistent with<br />
what I have said about not intruding into the affairs of New<br />
Zealand or of the United States, in our discussions that we have<br />
with the United States and with New Zealand I mean it may emerge<br />
that there are certain things that went on before which may still<br />
go on. But it is impossible at this point to be definite about<br />
that and therefore I have the responsibility of making sure that<br />
we get the bi-lateral relationships in a sensible, operative way. </p>
