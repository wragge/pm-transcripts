JOURNALIST: Well Mr Hawke, what's you response to the<br />
latest developments in the Gulf?<br />
PM: Well I'm very pleased that there's this move been<br />
made by President Bush. It gives the hope that the<br />
strong signal that's been given by the United Nations,<br />
through its most recent resolution, of the preparedness<br />
to use force If necessary may, however, give rise to a<br />
resolution by diplomatic activity. It's important that<br />
It be understood, as the President clearly has, that the<br />
three conditions of the United Nations and they're not<br />
the conditionsi of President Bush, they are the conditions<br />
of the United Nations are not negotiable. That is the<br />
total withdrawal of the Iraqi forces, the release of all<br />
hostages and the return of the Independence of Kuwait.<br />
Those are non-negotiable. Now if Saddam Hussein is<br />
prepared to hakve discussions within that context there is<br />
hope that conflict can be avoided.<br />
JOURNALIST: If that conflict can't be avoided will<br />
Australian troops be involved?<br />
PM: I'll be making a statement to the Parliament on<br />
Tuesday. I've made It clear that I'm not making any<br />
pre-emptive comments before I speak to the Parliament on<br />
that. JOURNALIST: What about the Palestinian position there<br />
regarding theise talks?<br />
FM: well I don't understand what you mean.<br />
JOURNALIST: ' It's been said that the Palestinian issue<br />
should be discussed at these talks between Mr Bush and<br />
PM: Well the Security Council didn't say that and the<br />
Security Council is right.<br />
-~ JOURNALIST: It's been reported today that the Australian<br />
" vernment's preparing to send or to keep four ships in<br />
fhte GuIf </p>
<p>PM: I read lots of things in the papers about what I'M<br />
going to do. Would you be surprised to know that very<br />
often they're not right?<br />
JOURNALIST: So are you denying that that's going to<br />
happen? PM! No, I'm not making any statement until Tuesday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you considering such a move?<br />
PM: I aM considering talking with my colleagues in the<br />
Party and I'll also be having a conversation with the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, consultations in respect of the<br />
Party and the Leader of the Opposition which I've<br />
promised in any situation where we were considering what<br />
would happen in the Gulf. Those things will be done and<br />
I'll make a statement to the Parliament on Tuesday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this matter so important that Australians<br />
should be prepared to die in the Gulf?<br />
PM: We don't want anyone to die, either in the Gulf or<br />
anywhere else. We want the matter to be resolved<br />
peaceably but what you have to remember are the facts<br />
that some people tend to forget and that is that one<br />
nation has attempted to destroy the existence of another,<br />
simply by marching in and say; sorry, Kuwait you no<br />
longer exist, you're us. Now if the world allows that<br />
sort of proposal to stand as an acceptable norm of<br />
behaviour then international relations are dead. That<br />
sort of position is not going to be tolerated by the<br />
world as the Security Council has made clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just back home for a moment, if I may?<br />
PM: Yes sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Industry heads and your own industry<br />
Minister this morning said that they believe the<br />
recession will get worse before it gets better. Do you<br />
agree? PM: Well whether you've reached the absolute bottom now,<br />
no-one can be absolutely certain. I think the thing that<br />
I am totally confident about is that the economy will<br />
recover in 1991 but it's impossible when you're in a<br />
recession to say is it this month or that week where<br />
you've actually hit the bottom. There are signs of<br />
recovery but I would just be misleading the Australian<br />
people if I1 said: well we are right at the bottom now.<br />
But what I am confident about, as I say, is that the<br />
recovery will take place next year.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Just a minute. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Nobby Clarke today also warned that the rmF<br />
might be forced to intervene soon in our economy.<br />
PM: Nobby. Good old Nobby. I mean, I think Nobby ought<br />
to, you know, really keep to the business of trying to<br />
run his bank. I don't think Nobby really, from a<br />
Position of how he's run the bank, is in a position of<br />
strength to tell people how to run the economy nlow. I<br />
intend no ill will towards Nobby but I say Nobby you run<br />
your bank and that's your job.<br />
JOURNALIST: indaudible<br />
PM: Just a minute. No you've had a chance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Keating says we're having<br />
a recession that we had to have. Do you agree with the<br />
Treasurer and do you accept the responsibility for the<br />
recession? PM: What the Treasurer was conveying was this, and I<br />
don't want to, ds I say, engulf you in statistics but<br />
there's a very simple one which is necessary to<br />
understand. That is that 18 months ago our expenditure<br />
as a nation was increasing by 10 1/ 2 per cent and our<br />
production by five per cent. Now the economy could not<br />
be allowed to go on doing that because if we in those<br />
circumstances had not taken action to lower the level of<br />
activity then the world would have done it for us and it<br />
would have done it in a totally devastating way. So we<br />
had to slow the economy down and that was the sense in<br />
which the Treasurer was saying what happened was a<br />
necessary remedy for the situation of the Australian<br />
economy. We've got to go on for some time having a<br />
situation where~ our Increase in outlays, our increase in<br />
expenditures as a total community are less than our<br />
growth in production. In that sense the decisions that<br />
were taken were, unfortunately, necessary. As I've said<br />
recently, I haven't spent 32 years of my life in public<br />
life, that is pursuing a public career rather then<br />
private aggrandlisement, I haven't been doing that to<br />
capriciously inflict hurt upon the Australian community.<br />
I know that I had the responsibility as Prime Minister,<br />
with my Governmfent, to make the decisions which were<br />
going to ensure the future welfare of the Australian<br />
economy. Ok, think<br />
JOURNALIST: you and the Treasurer have consistently<br />
said that all t; he Opposition offers is to solve those<br />
problems by driving the economy into recession and that<br />
you would not do that, this has now happened.<br />
PM: No, what wie've said is that the Opposition has no<br />
recipe, has hatt in the past and has in the present no<br />
recipe for deal. ing with the basic economic challenges of<br />
this country. It's been true in the past, it remains<br />
true. If you look at the situation in 1982-83 when they<br />
unnecessarily created a recession one of the reasons why </p>
<p>that was done is that they had no wages policy allowed<br />
a wages blowout of 17 per cent and the economy was driven<br />
into levels of unemployment that hadn't been seen for<br />
year.. We haven't reached and we will not reach those<br />
sorts of levels of unemployment and a basic reason why<br />
we're going to come out of this recession in a relatively<br />
strong position in because we have got inflation going<br />
down and it's in large part is the result of having an<br />
effective wages policy. While the Opposition is in the<br />
situation where they've got no way of controlling the<br />
level of wages outcome then they would be, as they were<br />
in the past, a disaster for this economy.<br />
JOURNALIST; Can I just ask you one for our Perth<br />
station? PM: For your Perth station, yen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Brian Burke has been named as the " B"<br />
involved in phone tapping in Western Australia. Is there<br />
a possibility that you might recall him from Ireland?<br />
PM: This question arose earlier. I don't make<br />
judgements about the people on the basis of allegations.<br />
People are innocent until they are proven guilty. Now as<br />
far as the situation in Western Australia is concerned a<br />
Royal Commission has been set up and it is for the Royal<br />
Commuission to make decisions as to who they want to Call.<br />
If, for instance, and I do it in no more than a<br />
hypothetical sense in answering your question, if they<br />
felt they wanted to call Mr Burke then of course he would<br />
come back for those purposes.<br />
