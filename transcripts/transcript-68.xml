PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, HON.<br />
J. McEWEN, AT CANBERRA ON THURSDAY, 7TH MAY, 1959, AT<br />
11.30 A. M.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN: There are reports that Australia will be called on<br />
to further reduce its production of lead and zinc,<br />
which arises from the current New York meeting to<br />
the extent of 23,000 tons. Have you any information<br />
or any comment?<br />
Well, I have some information, I think the story<br />
flows from falling lead-zinc prices, dating back<br />
more than a year, followeby the A-oricar anxiety<br />
the local anxiety of their own inducty that,<br />
about a year ago, we were proposing from here, after<br />
consultation with the Australian industry, tha-; there<br />
should be a study, at the international level, of the<br />
relevant facts, which would have the dua. objectivos<br />
of seeing whether anything could be done to<br />
stabilize markets and give us a basis on which we<br />
should argue with the United States that they ought<br />
not to take any unilateral action, That is more than<br />
a year ago. Sir Edwin McCarthy, at his end. tool cn<br />
instructions, an ititiative in convening inuernational<br />
meetings, and this has evolved with nhe<br />
Montreal Conference decisions intervening, v-hich<br />
gave a general lead in the approach to iworld c-mmuodj. r,<br />
prices. This had led to a succession of conferonces<br />
between governments and their industri. c. internationally<br />
between the industries without benefit of<br />
government; and a succession of meetings under the<br />
auspices of the United Nations, All thi: has<br />
culminated in the meeting which is now curre-t and<br />
may be, in fact, practically finished, in kew Yo<br />
in which governments under the aispices of the United<br />
Nations but all equipped with the dvice of their<br />
own industry people have been considering what<br />
might be done to stabilize world markets nd prices<br />
for lead and zinc. I think the critical a. ppoch<br />
was a question of whether it was practical. and<br />
desirable to attempt to reasonably equate the<br />
quantities of these metals coming on to world<br />
markets with the consumptive demand, T t . iin-i-may<br />
expect perhaps today some announcements to emerge<br />
from the meeting. I know there have been rumoars,<br />
but there are no official decisions yet tnat h'rav,<br />
been communicated to me,<br />
Do you think you might be happy about the. in formn'atio-n<br />
that is coming?<br />
I think so, because the whole procedure ha b adc<br />
work-out of what I was propounding for our<br />
Government at Montreal that there shculcu bt a<br />
commodity by commodity study of the facto.; s :; hich<br />
may contribute to stabilisation of c rmmnodity<br />
prices. This has been an actual work-out of thai<br />
approach.<br />
Mr. McEwen, Isn't this rather a suggestion<br />
cut production in any country, but ins'eadc, l:-p<br />
a certain amount of lead and zinc off ' e *: arket by<br />
stockpiling in the countries concerned?<br />
Well, I have been carefully choosing ords I<br />
say equate the quantity of lead and z. in coring on<br />
to world markets to the consumptive de. oand, It<br />
would be left to each country possibly to a-h<br />
company to decide whether its lr'iA-but-': ooi; c~ l, </p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />
MR. M cEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWJEN:<br />
QUESTION;<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWJEN:<br />
QUESTION: MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION: be at the point of production, or at the point of<br />
smelting, or at the point of export to world markets.<br />
Would there be any Government advice to Australian<br />
companies on that point?<br />
There is certainly no Government instruction. There<br />
is a desire by the Government that, to the extent<br />
that our own policies are having a work-out, that<br />
Australia should be capable of speaking with a<br />
single voice. And that has substantially been<br />
achieved. But, actually, this is more a que-Istion for industry<br />
than for Government to take the initiative, I mean?<br />
My own attitude is that the Government ought never<br />
to take an arbitrary position if industry is willing<br />
to make a decisive arrangment itself. And the units<br />
of production in these industries are so few in<br />
number that I have always thought -that it should be<br />
feasible, and I believe in the Australian scene, it<br />
is feasible, for the industries to reach such a<br />
measure of agreement that it avoids the necessity for<br />
Government intervention.<br />
What you say, Sir, seems to suggest that however it<br />
may be achieved, we may be brought to a position<br />
of agreeing to a further reduction in exports at<br />
least? No; I would correct you there. The industries have<br />
done that substantially themsleves over the last<br />
year. Some of the Broken Hill maines announced long<br />
since that some would reduce their working days, and<br />
some reduce their exports. And you have seen<br />
recently the announcement on behalf of Mt. Isa.<br />
And this would probably not affect us any agreement<br />
we have already anticipated?<br />
I think you may take it that it would not further<br />
affect us.<br />
We have had reports that Broken Hill have already<br />
agreed with other producers on a private level to a<br />
1212 per cent. cut in their sales. Does this mean<br />
that if there was an agreement by the United Nations<br />
comamittee that there would be, say, a 10 per cent.<br />
cut in sales? Surely Broken Hill would have to<br />
make a further cut in their sales from their current<br />
level, following such an agreement?<br />
Well the relationship, in my experience which is a<br />
fairly long one between the mining groups, is<br />
that they meet % hese problems without all necessarily<br />
taking the same action at the same time. But they get<br />
a total end re~ sult that is substantially the<br />
equivalent to what it would have been if they had<br />
all. taken the same action at the same time.<br />
Could I just check the precise wording of something<br />
you said earlier, Sir? You said it would be left to<br />
each country or each company to decide at what point<br />
there should be controls whether at maining,<br />
smelting, or export. You said " each country" or<br />
" leach company"? </p>
<p>MR. McE-4EN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. MoE14EN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWt-EN:<br />
COMMENT:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McZWEN:<br />
QUESTION: I said both, and I was trying to get back the<br />
atmosphere in which I was quoting both. To each<br />
country and, perhaps, to each company, so that in<br />
one country it may even be a governmental decision.<br />
In our country in this country I am sure that<br />
whatever is done is going to transpire to be an<br />
industry decision which may not necessarily apply in<br />
both metals an equal formula to every producing unit.<br />
They work out a balance " You do a little more on<br />
lead and we'll do a little more on zinc'. They do<br />
that kind of thing. It works out, well, much better<br />
than a government applying an arbitrary formula.<br />
It has been reported this morning, Mr. McEwen, that<br />
there is something in the nature of a revolt in the<br />
Government parties over the New Guinea taxation<br />
position. I understand that the party met and<br />
considered the matter again this morning. Could you<br />
clear the thing up for us?<br />
Well, I saw the " revolt" in print, but I would say<br />
there has been no revolt. There has been a vigorous<br />
discussion, as I would hope always to have as<br />
evidence of a virile party organisation. 3. further<br />
discussion this morning has been conducted in a<br />
completely amicable atmosphere.<br />
Can you say, Mr. McEwen, whether the Government will<br />
allow debate on the New Guinea issue? If so, when<br />
and how?<br />
The New Guinea question of taxation?<br />
Ye s.<br />
There will certainly be an opportunity for debate<br />
if legislation is passed in the New Guinea<br />
Legislature, because our own statute requires that<br />
such New Guinea legislation is finally tabled in our<br />
Parliament. That produces a procedural opportunity<br />
for debate.<br />
I will put it another way: Will there be an<br />
opportunity to debate it before it is finalised in<br />
the Legislative Council?<br />
I think that there will not be a special opportunity<br />
created; but today is " Grievance Day". The Supply<br />
debate is on the stocks, and there are opportunities<br />
for any members to express themselves.<br />
On another New Guinea question, Mr. McEwen: Is it<br />
a fact that there are proposals before the Government,<br />
which may or may not have reached the Cabinet, for<br />
QANTAS to leave the New Guinea airlines field and for<br />
them to be replaced by Ansett and as a sort<br />
of extension of Australian domestic airline<br />
operations. Well, I think it is publicly known that Mr. Ansett<br />
has expressed his desire to be allowed to get into<br />
the New Guinea traffic. This has not been a matter<br />
of Cabinet discussion. It may well transpire<br />
eventually to be so.<br />
Have you got any person in mind to succeed Mr.<br />
McDonald as T. A. A. Chairman, Sir?<br />
MR. McEWEN: No. </p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEvTEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McE4fEN:<br />
QUEST ION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. MC7' WEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McDEEN:<br />
QUESTION: MR. McEdEN:<br />
COMM1ENT:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. iMcDJEN: Is there likely to be an early appointment?<br />
I would think not a very early appointment, for<br />
the reasons that were incorporated in my announcement<br />
of his appointment to the other position.<br />
Mr. McEwen, have you yet received any reports from<br />
Washington on the " Food for Peace" talks or is it<br />
a bit early at this stage?<br />
Well, of course, I have received advice I mean<br />
the cables are buzzing backwards and forwards<br />
because guidance and instruction have to go from<br />
here. I am expecting a final communique in today.<br />
Indeed, it may have just hit my table for all I know.<br />
But I certainly have not sighted the final<br />
comtmunique.<br />
When do you expect a decision to be made, Sir, on<br />
the QA14TAS proposal for a new Sydney hotel?<br />
I cannot put a time upon the thini~ ing that relates<br />
to this. It is evident that the growing volume<br />
of busines of QANTAS particularly with the<br />
additional traffic that is expected to be associated<br />
with the 707' s raises the question of the adequacy<br />
of the Wentworth Hotel for QANTAS's own purposes<br />
there. And that does quite legitimately, raise the<br />
question of whether QJLTAS is to be in a position to<br />
service the additional traffic and service it where?<br />
this is a matter in which exploratory discussions<br />
are proceedin, between QANTAS and the Government at<br />
the present tinie.<br />
Has it reached Cabinet level yet, Mr. McEwen?<br />
Oh yes, it has reached Cabinet level, but not to<br />
a definitive point.<br />
Is there likely to be an early Cabinet decision?<br />
Well, in a matter in which discussions are proceeding,<br />
I frankly can't anticipate how quickly we will<br />
reach a decision.<br />
Is it just a question of discussion, Sir, or are you<br />
seeking further information?<br />
What is the difference?<br />
Quite frequently, a preliminary Cabinet discussion<br />
leads to a decision to get some further facts that<br />
may not initially be before the Cabinet.<br />
Well, I think that is partly the position, but I<br />
think the exploratory discussions and that is the<br />
terin I use will roam over the whole field of<br />
necessity, dimensions, when, where I think that is<br />
the kind of discussion that is proceeding.<br />
Has any protest boon made to the Government against<br />
this hotel going on in the party, for instance?<br />
Well, I have never heard of any protest.<br />
By private parties like Chevron?<br />
No. To the best of my knowledge no. </p>

MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEiIEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION: Senator Paltridge is handling the matter at this<br />
stage, I take it between Cabinet discussions?<br />
Yes, naturally; it is his business.<br />
The Mr. McEwen, is proposing to ask the<br />
Government to introduce legislation to restore<br />
soldier preference legislation which would not be<br />
open to challenge in the court. Have you considered<br />
that matter at all, or received any request?<br />
My understanding and I am without the benefit of<br />
the Attorney-General's advice on this is that<br />
the Court's decision is on a straight constitutional<br />
base that would leave the Government leave the<br />
Parliament without power to legislate to reestablish<br />
preference in ordinary employment. This,<br />
of course, does not touch on my understanding<br />
the constitutional right of the Government in respect<br />
of its own employees. The Government does not<br />
propose to vary its policy in regard to its ovm<br />
employees. The Boyer Report which deals with the<br />
whole matter of public service employment by the<br />
Commonwealth, will be studied on its own merits.<br />
I am not aware as to whether this issue is raised<br />
at all in the Boyer Report. But it will be studied<br />
on its merits. And I understand that the State<br />
Governments have said that they propose to sustain<br />
preference as they have had it up to the present time<br />
in their own employment.<br />
Are you proposing naything outside the public service<br />
level on this matter?<br />
I ami, persinally, not aware of what opportunity<br />
there is outside the Coimmonwealth employees.<br />
Have you had any further information, Sir, on this<br />
so-called new wonder fibre from Italy?<br />
No, I have not.<br />
What is the Government's attitude to Sir Thomas<br />
Playford's request for money for the rail<br />
standardisation I am not equipped to answer that.<br />
Has anything come before Cabinet yet, Sir,<br />
Not in the immediate past.<br />
How far past have you had something to do with it?<br />
Well, I think it is known didn't we announce back<br />
at the time of the election that we would make some<br />
funds available? I think that is the most recent<br />
treatment of the matter by the Government.<br />
Have there been any discussions with Britain on<br />
the launching of satellites from Woomera?<br />
I am not able to answer.<br />
Sir, it has been sugge3sted that a third Minister,<br />
other than Mr. Downer and Mr. Cramer, will be going<br />
abroad shortly. Are you in a position to tell us<br />
who he is and what his purpose would be in going<br />
abroad? </p>

MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION: MR. McEWEN: No, I am not in a position, but I have seen Senator<br />
Spooneris nar-.-. e mentioned in the papers. All I can<br />
say is that the very nacure of Senator Spooner's<br />
Departrm-ent and its functions is such that there<br />
could arise an occasion for him to go abroad, but<br />
there is nothing in prospect as of the present.<br />
Can you say, Sir, when you think the present sittings<br />
will finish and when the House will resume again?<br />
Well, I expect them to finish probably today week.<br />
I can't say with any precision when the House will<br />
resume the Budg--et session. That will be influenced<br />
by the timing of the conclusion of the Cabinet's<br />
construction of the Budget, I should think.<br />
You have no time-table in mind for the Budget itself?<br />
Not a precise one.<br />
It will be later than last year, I take it, Sir?~<br />
I would think it igcht be a little later, but not<br />
much later.<br />
Have you any date in mind yet for the Loan Council-<br />
Premiers I Conference?<br />
No, we have not a date.<br />
Does i~ t look like being early or late?<br />
It looks to me like being miiedium. ( Laughter.)<br />
Mr. McEwen, there have been reports that there have<br />
been substantial revisions in the balance of<br />
payments estimates for 1958/ 59 and probably for<br />
1959/ 6o, com.. pared with what was sought at the time<br />
of the last Budget; also that the overall cash<br />
deficit that the Government looked to at the time of<br />
the last Budget will almost certainly not be<br />
realised. In view of that more favourable out-turn<br />
in those two basic financial estimates which governed<br />
the bid at the time of the Budget, would that, in<br />
your mind be prim-za facie evidence in favour of more<br />
tax roducLons or a m-. ore liberal approach in the next<br />
Budget, just as a matter of principle?<br />
Well, let me try to deal with the two subjects<br />
separately. The balance of payments to the extent<br />
that the balance of payments has improved through<br />
additional earnings, is gratifying but not very<br />
great. The balance of payment improvement is,<br />
undoubtedly, principally attributable to capital<br />
outflow, which is gratifying but not predictable with<br />
any great confidence or precision. And I would think<br />
that, to the extent that our policies are affected<br />
by the phenomenon it is illustrated in the fact<br />
that with a fall-away in earnings, we have sustained,<br />
for the time-being, the import licensing ceiling<br />
at 800 million. I think we will take it from there<br />
in accordance with our experience of capital inflow<br />
and then in the import licensing period following<br />
the present one, we will have the benefit of the<br />
new wool season. I don't think I can really say more<br />
than that, excopt to repeat that it has been our<br />
constant desire to lessen the sgringency of import<br />
licensing as we felt it was safe to do it. But we<br />
have no intention of applying a short-term approach<br />
and on and off approach to that. That is good for<br />
S </p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McE WEN: no one. On the other side, it is undoubtedly true<br />
that the response to Government loan raisings has been<br />
very gratifying. I don't think that the Government<br />
feels that the future in this is completely predictable.<br />
Last year, there is no doubt that the estimate of<br />
the outcome of loan conversions was a contributing<br />
factor to the deficit budgeting. And, by the sane<br />
token, an improvement in the loan situation will be<br />
appropriately taken into account in the Budget<br />
construction, but I would be the last to be guessing<br />
now as to the consequences for taxation.<br />
Sir, recently the New Zealand Minister for Agriculture<br />
conferred with Sir John Collins in Wellington on the<br />
price of Australian butter selling in the U. K. Have<br />
you had any official complaints from New Zealand<br />
about us dumping butter on the U. K. market?<br />
No I have not. I think that would come to me. Any<br />
such issue would be first considered by the Australian<br />
Dairy Produce Board and the Department of Primary<br />
Industry. But I think it would come to me pretty<br />
fast, and I have no knowledge of it at all,<br />
Has the Goveruiment yet decided on an Ambassador to<br />
Moscow, Mr. McEwen?<br />
No,<br />
Another point on this " Food for Peace"-When you<br />
came back fr'om America, you said that ii the<br />
Americans as i understand it if the Americans<br />
wanted to step up their disposals following the<br />
" Food for Peace" Conference, there would have to be<br />
some assumption by the Americans of some obligations<br />
towards stabilizing, or ensuring that we would be able<br />
to have export earnings sufficient for our Durposes,<br />
or there w-ould have to be some compensation to us if<br />
the Americans expanded their surplus sales into our<br />
markets. Do you think, following what you know of<br />
the developments at the " Food for Peace" Conference,<br />
that we will have to pursue that line of approach?<br />
I don't think that we will. I don't feel able to be<br />
dogmatic about this, because I feel that there has<br />
been some shift of American policy some indication<br />
of shift of American policy even since I was over<br />
there In other words, they are shoving signs that they<br />
would be prepared to bind thenselves in sor1 way to<br />
not making sales that would affect our commercial<br />
sales?<br />
Well, they have been, from the outset, very<br />
forthcoming in giving assurances that they recognise<br />
our claim to be protected in our legitimate conmiercial<br />
opportunities. They accept that as a principle, Th2hey<br />
will, I am sure, come out with a much more effective<br />
and continuous instrument of consultation, because to<br />
accept the principle is not enough in a spatter of<br />
individual transactions, We have always relied on<br />
two things acceptance of a principle and then the<br />
backing of that principle by an instrument of study<br />
and consultationo, I think that that will be one<br />
of the outcomes of this conference. On the other hand,<br />
the operation of this declared principle is very<br />
important if there be any appreciable increase in the<br />
actual non-comiercial disposal, </p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWIEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
MR. McEWEN: What form do you think this instrument of<br />
consultation could take?<br />
Well first it could be a committee formally<br />
constituted, including representatives of all the<br />
commercial exporters of wheat. So it could have<br />
-a basis of existence founded upon an agreement a<br />
formal agroement between the countries concerned.<br />
Then it would need to have an appropriate charter<br />
which would need to be a charter governed by a<br />
declaration of principle and procedurally capable of<br />
continous and particular study of the financial<br />
capacities, for example, of individual countries to<br />
buy commercially; what inhibited them from buying<br />
commercially a complete exchange problem or an<br />
exchange problem flowing from a diversion of their<br />
exchange resources to developmental programmes, as<br />
distinct from consiumption imports. These are the<br />
k~ ind of things.<br />
Is there some evidence that the Americans appreciate<br />
that some countries are transferring their exchange<br />
problems to us?<br />
Yes, I think there is. And I really think there will<br />
flow from this conference an acknowledgement of the<br />
peculiar interest of Australia in wheat trade with<br />
the Asiatic countries. They have been our historic<br />
markets and, of course, we have the -eographic<br />
advantage of freight.<br />
Have you yet decided on the composition and terms of<br />
reference of the committe to review taxation laws?<br />
No, we have not,<br />
