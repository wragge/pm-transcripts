TWENTY-FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL MEETING<br />
Melbourne 23 April 1972.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. William McMahon, M. P^<br />
Mr President, Members of the Executivu of the Zionist Federation<br />
of Australia and New Zealind, and all of you who have come to<br />
commemorate the Twenty-fourth Anniversoryof the Proclamation of<br />
the Independent State of Israel:<br />
I am honoured to be your guest today. Some ? eople will say I<br />
came here tonight to demonstrate clearly that there was no hint of<br />
bigotry or discrimination associatea with me. There is a simple<br />
answer. It is true and correct.<br />
Australian Jewry has always treasured the absence of discrimination<br />
and anti-semitism, and the traditions of freedom and democracy<br />
in Australia. I have always treasured those principles and I always<br />
will treasure them. I am here this evening to renew that commitment<br />
on my own behalf, on behalf of our Government, on behalf of the<br />
National Government and, I am absolutely certain, on behalf of the<br />
great majority of all Australians.<br />
All the world knows the story of the miracle of modern Israel.<br />
Israel is a haven for the oppressed and unfortunate. It is th2<br />
chanpion of Jewish rights and of the right of survival, wherever they<br />
are threatened. And it preserves the historical identity of the<br />
Jewish people, through its culivation of treir spiritual and cultural<br />
heritage. So this is a proper occasion to remind ourselves of the<br />
prophetic visions of justice and peace upon which the State of Israel<br />
is founded, and by which it is guided. The story of Israel is unique<br />
in our generation, which has seen the emergence of so many new nation<br />
states. There is noather exayole of a people who, having lost their<br />
independence and become widely dispersed in foreign lands, have been<br />
able, twenty centuries later, to come together to form a nation state.<br />
It is living testimony of faith, vitality, and determination. It is<br />
a reminder that forbearance, courage, resolution and industry can<br />
prevail during the darkest night. There is no bravernor prouder story<br />
than the record of Jewish history. It is a story of sadness and of<br />
unbelievable triumph. It is a story which is still unfolding in<br />
Israel where a strong and independent modern state has been built by<br />
Jews in the land of their fathers. ./ 2 </p>
<p>S2. Through sheer hard work and the clever application of scientific'<br />
knowledge, an arid and exhausted land has been restored and made<br />
productive... this was eloquently and felicitously expressed with<br />
masterful understatement by Winston Churchill in Jerusalem more than<br />
fifty years ago in speaking of the beginnings of the new Israel:<br />
" It is making two blades of grass grow where one grew before". This<br />
prophecy has been fulfilled. The grass is green in Israel today.<br />
The desert is blooming.<br />
Australians have not forgotten the evils that shamed humanity<br />
which were revealed following the second world war. They have not<br />
forgotten the victimisation, the persecution the massacres and the<br />
injustices which would have broken and overcome a lesser people. It<br />
is this imperishable spirit and this irresistible urge for freedom<br />
and independence which we salute tonight from one young and free<br />
nation to another. Our two countries have many links which hind<br />
us closely. In two world wars, a warm relationship was built up<br />
between the Jewish population of Palestine and our own fighting<br />
men. This is a relationship forged in war that has continued<br />
undiminished and which.. I know will endure and grow.<br />
Through its active membership of the United Nations Palestine<br />
Commission and the General Assembly, Australia helped the modern<br />
state of Israel to take its place as a nation in 1948. Since then,<br />
we have consistently supported Israel's right to exist, along with<br />
all other states in the Middle East. We have -ackedI srael as a<br />
sovereign independent state with a right to exist within secure and<br />
recognised boundaries free from threats or acts of force. It is<br />
one of the tragedies of our time that the issues which divide Israel<br />
from its Arab neighbours still remain unresolved. The major<br />
influences on events in the Middle East are exercised by countries<br />
other than Australia. But we, in this country, have emphasised<br />
both in the United Nations, and anywhere else where our voice is<br />
heard, that Australia stands ready to support any constructive efforts<br />
designed to further a negotiated settlement. We continue to hope that<br />
good sense and moderation will prevail.<br />
Mr President, it has also been put to me that you support an<br />
immediate start to meaningful dialogue between the Arab States and<br />
Israel. And, further, that such a dialogue should lead to a just<br />
settlement of the Middle East conflict, based firstly on secure and<br />
defendable borders, and on mutual recognition and dignity. It is<br />
said that such a settlement would once and for all remove the dread<br />
of war from the Middle East in the interests of world peace and the<br />
co-operative development of this important region of the world. And<br />
I might add, it would be a settlement of immeasurable benefits to men<br />
and women of all nations in that area.<br />
That is what has been put to me as your position. It is a<br />
position with which I must say I agree add support as a constructive<br />
attitude. Peace in the Middle East is not only in the interests of<br />
those nations who live there. It is in the interests of the world,<br />
and it is in the interests of Australia. I am proud to be Prime<br />
Minister of a country where men accept each other for whlat they are<br />
and where bigotry has no place. / 3 </p>

Over many years, this country has been sympathetical-ly<br />
concerned with the plight of Jewisb pooplz in countries where they<br />
have been subject to discriminattion and oppression. For some of<br />
those who haue been aV'le to e; ni'grate, we have gladly provided a<br />
new home. We believe others who wish to emigrate from countries<br />
where they feel unwanted shogid be allowed to do so. And I mention<br />
particularlythe struggle of Soviet Jewry to live in freedom with<br />
thQ right to cherish their culture and tradition, and their struggle<br />
for freedom to return to the land of their forefathers in Israel if<br />
they wish to do so.<br />
Australia has cause to be thankful to its Jewish community<br />
for its significan contribution to our society and national life.<br />
You have added the weight of your faith to the spiritual life of<br />
this nation. You have given much to our own culture. You have<br />
given your skills to businass and commerce. You have given us<br />
notable leaders in war and peace.<br />
I take three names only from our history; names that are<br />
honoured for the diversity of their contributions to our natidial<br />
life. There are, of course, many others. Firstly, the late Sir<br />
Isaac Isaacs, our first Australian-horn Governor-General. He was<br />
a man of the law and of letters and of politics who helped to draft<br />
the Australian Constitution by which we live today; a Chief Justice<br />
of the Commonwealth and before that a Cahinet Minister.<br />
Then there was the late General Sir John Monash, a Jew hy<br />
race and faith, who was one of our greatest Australian~ s. He led us<br />
superbly in war; he was an innovator in peace; he was warrior,<br />
acadamic, administrator and the first president of the Australian<br />
Zionist Federation. And lastly, the late I. H. Boas, son of the first Rabbi for<br />
the Jewish community in South Australia. A scientist who made a<br />
dramatic contribution to Australian industry by pioneering the use<br />
of our native gum tree and the eucalypt, in paper-making. He served<br />
Israel, too, with his special genius. You honour him with the Boas<br />
Institute of Forest Products in Israel. Part of a giant industry<br />
is his monument in Australia today.<br />
These men adorn the Australian story and there are many more<br />
of Jewish faith, living and dead. Their lives are fine examples of<br />
the way in which the Jewish community enriches the quality of<br />
Australian life. We will continue to be enriched if we remain one<br />
peoplc of several faiths certainly but united by a common<br />
purpose and sharing the same dangers and the same opportunities.<br />
And I say to you with all the sincerity of which I am capable: I<br />
will repudiate and reject any hint of anti-semitism as disgraceful<br />
and unworthy of any Australian. I have nothing but comtempt for<br />
any Australian who would stoop to such statements or behaviour.<br />
Mr President, as Israel stands on the threshold of its<br />
year, I am most honoured that you have included me on this<br />
occasion. Together we share in the pride of achievement by Israel.<br />
It is the hope of all of us that a just and lasting peace will be<br />
achieved before we next meet to commemorate this great anniversary. </p>
