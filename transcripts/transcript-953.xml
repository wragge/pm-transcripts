<p>" THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF POLITICAL AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP INII THE MODERN STATE"<br />
There are two good reasons for my sense of pride<br />
on this occasion. One is that it would be an honour for any man to<br />
be asked to deliver to you the first Baillieu Lecture. Lord<br />
Baillieu is a great Australian and a great man. He bears a<br />
name greatly distinguished in what I will later refer to as the<br />
" industrial statesmanship" of Australia. He has added to it<br />
by his great services to British industry and international<br />
understanding. The work of such men should appropriately be<br />
honoured during the years of their activity; we have, as a<br />
rule, a bad racial habit of deferring our praise to the obituary<br />
column. My second reason is a quite simple and personal<br />
one. Clive Baillieu is my friend, always more than faithful<br />
and more than just to me. This personal reason enables me to<br />
add affection to respect.<br />
You have invited me to speak of the interdependence<br />
of Political and Industrial leadership in the modern world.<br />
There can be no more important subject. I am delighted with it,<br />
for I have lived with this problem for many years as a political<br />
leader, and am now given the opportunity of setting down, in a<br />
more or less ordered form, some of the results of that experience.<br />
I begin by saying that we must bring our vocabulary<br />
up to date. The word " statesmanship" has usually been applied<br />
to the highest level of politics. It has connoted the management<br />
of state affairs which, when the term came into use, were<br />
political affairs " pure and simple" if you will forgive such an<br />
imaginative expression. Those were the years, not so many<br />
generations behind us, when even lawyers could profess to find<br />
an intelligible distinction between governmental functions and<br />
business functions, with mutual exclusiveness. </p>
<p>Those days have gone. The lines have not been<br />
merely blurred; they have disappeared under the pressure of<br />
modern complexities. Today the management of state affairs<br />
cannot be artificially confined in its scope. Politics and<br />
industry are deeply involved with each other, acting and<br />
re-acting upon each other. The qualifications of the modern<br />
statesman will be inadequate or incomplete unless he is conscipus<br />
of the problems of industry and the impact upon those problems<br />
of political policies and actions. This is not just to say<br />
that there has been a change in political outlook; it is also<br />
to say that there has been a change in industrial outlook.<br />
Neither change is as yet complete.<br />
Industrial activities are, in the modern world, no<br />
longer purely private matters, to be resolved by private decision<br />
alone in the light of unfettered competition. I beg of you not<br />
to think that I suffer from the reactionary socialist doctrine<br />
which discourages the rewarded enterprise of the individual and<br />
attributes quite mystical faculties to that omniscient and<br />
omnipotent body, the State. What I am saying is that neither<br />
politics nor industry can live alone. The old-fashioned " sturdy<br />
individualist" who told government to keep clear of his business,<br />
that he wanted neither help nor hindrance from it, is as dead as<br />
the dodo. The doctrinaire socialist still flourishes, but, in<br />
my country at least, his voice becomes fainter.<br />
It is frequently charged against those of us who are<br />
not Socialists that we are reactionaries; that we want to turn<br />
the clock back; that we yearn for a restoration of laissez-faire.<br />
In the modern world, this is quite untrue. The truth is that<br />
it is the non-Socialists who have moved with the times. I can<br />
understand, as an intellectual and historical exercise, how<br />
Socialism attracted the support of radical thinkers after the<br />
industrial revolution in Great Britain, the creation of " dark<br />
satanic mills", the horrorsof child labour, when industrial power<br />
was in a limited number of hands, when the rights of employed<br />
people were either denied or imperfectly recognised, when the<br />
infant Trades Unions were too commonly regarded as subversive<br />
bodies, when social services as we now know them were almost nonexistent.<br />
It is not strange that under these circumstances there<br />
grew up in many thoughtful minds the egaliterian belief that the<br />
creation of social and industrial justice demanded a high measure<br />
of uniformity, and that uniformity could be achieved only by the<br />
mastery and management of the State.<br />
But we know, and occasionally admit, that there is no<br />
uniformity among personalities, or talents, or energy. We have<br />
learned that true rising standards of living are the product of<br />
progressive enterprise, the acceptance of risks, the encouragement<br />
of adventure, the prospect of rewards. </p>
<p>3.<br />
These are all individual matters. There is no Government<br />
department which can create these things. What governments can<br />
and should do, when encountering some new problem or developing<br />
state of affairs, is not to say " the Government will run this",<br />
but first of all to seek the private enterprise answer, to help<br />
the individual to help himself, to create, by legislation and<br />
administration, a social economic and industrial climate favourable<br />
to his activity and growth.<br />
The validity of these theses is, in my own Australian<br />
experience, covering a consecutive fifteen years of Prime<br />
Ministership, seen with increasing clarity by a younger and, on<br />
the whole, better educated generation of electors, who want the<br />
opportunity to make their own way and place in the world. They<br />
reject the enfeebling notion that the chief end of man, from<br />
the cradle to the grave, is to be ordered around by, and live<br />
dependent upon " the Government". There is some eloquent corroborative<br />
evidence to support my own judgment. At the recent<br />
Australian election the leader of the Labour Party, a party whose<br />
principal objective has for very many years been " the socialisation<br />
of the means of production, distribution and exchange", promise<br />
that if elected he would, in effect, suspend the socialist objective<br />
for the life of the Parliament!<br />
Clearly the definition and function of Statesmanship<br />
have widened. Industrialists may protest that politicians should<br />
not interfere in business affairs. But it is impossible to<br />
believe that in a complicated world of international trade and<br />
finance, of economic theories and policies which are no longer<br />
academic exercises but touch and concern all forms of human acticity,<br />
and of the domestic social demands which have brought about what<br />
we call " the welfare state", governments, however non-socialist,<br />
can be passive observers.<br />
Today's industrialists, whether primary or secondary,<br />
and however individualist they may be, demand and obtain government<br />
intervention by way of aid and organisation. I will illustrate from<br />
my own country. There are internal marketing schemes for the<br />
handling of certain primary products and price stabilisation<br />
schemes administered through various boards for such commodities<br />
as dairy products, wheat, and sugar. The farmer is still a free<br />
agent, farming his own land and producing his own goods. But<br />
he has called government aid in to secure for him the adequate and<br />
reasonably stable prices which he needs to make his individual<br />
enterprise effective and profitable. </p>
<p>Under special circumstances, government provides<br />
subsidies. One example is butter, where a domestic subsidy gives<br />
to the dairy farmer some assurance of a profitable domestic price<br />
to be set off against his frequently unprofitable price on world<br />
markets of considerable instability. Another is a recently<br />
introduced bounty on superphosphates, designed to encourage the<br />
use of fertilisers and the consequent increase of production and<br />
reduction in costs.<br />
The manufacturer has frequent resort to the Tariff<br />
Board and special statutory authorities for customs tariffs and<br />
bounties. In the broad sense, he looks to Government for<br />
assistance and protection. He may not put it in so many words,<br />
but he is acutely conscious of the interdependence of government<br />
and industry. But perhaps he tends to over-simplify the problems<br />
of government. He is occasionally disposed to see his own<br />
industrial problem as if it were in a national vacuum. " My<br />
business is being adversely affected by lower-cost imports; the<br />
solution is a higher tariff; please provide it!"<br />
This is, of course, a dangerous over-simplification.<br />
Protective tariffs are designed to avoid unfair competition;<br />
but they should not be designed to prevent all competition.<br />
Complete domestic monopolies are inconsistent with international<br />
trade. Now, whatever could have happened domestically in the<br />
absence of government interventions and controls, it is clear that<br />
international trade is today so involved with government trade<br />
services, trade treaties, international conventions and export<br />
inducements, that it could not survive without them. Speaking<br />
again of my own country, this has been recognised by both government<br />
and industry. We have regular consultations with industrial<br />
and financial leaders. We are assisted in specific fields by<br />
many groups of advisers. We have an expanding overseas Trade<br />
Commissioner Service which provides an exploratory instrument<br />
which individual industrial exporters could probably not afford.<br />
An Export Development Council of leading businessmen advises us<br />
on ways and means of increasing our export income. Two notable<br />
results have been the creation of the Export Payments Insurance<br />
Corporation with outstandingly good results and the<br />
introduction of a scheme of tax concessions successfully designed<br />
to encourage more production for export and a more vigorous search<br />
for and development of new markets overseas. </p>
<p>We are, of course, all familiar with such intergovernmental<br />
agreements as those relating to wheat and meat and<br />
sugar and certain metals. On our side, at least, all such<br />
agreements are worked out in the closest consultation with the<br />
industries concerned. The Trade Treaty is now a commonplace. It enlarges<br />
the horizons and opportunities of individual producers while<br />
helping to bring into a healthy condition, the trade and financial<br />
balances which are a constant care of government.<br />
I will not seek to multiply instances or make anything<br />
like a complete catalogue. But I will say at once that such<br />
examples as I have given are all examples of the inevitable interdependence<br />
of political and industrial leadership in the modern<br />
world. Once this is acknowledged on both sides, the future<br />
becomes clearer. But it must be acknowledged as a vital principle<br />
of government, not just as an occasional and accidental by-product<br />
of some extraordinary circumstance:<br />
This truth is, in my opinion and experien.. as till<br />
obscured by some antiquated dogmas, and prejudices, and limitations<br />
of outlook. Thus, it is still the practice of many economists and<br />
financial writers to refer to capital expenditure in " the public<br />
sector" and in " the private sector" as if they were referring to<br />
two mutually exclusive and indeed actively competitive zones.<br />
Nothing could be more wrong. When private capital is laid out<br />
upon capital expansions of industry, this is done on the assumption<br />
that public capital expenditure will be made to provide the streets<br />
or roads, the water services, the lighting services, the schools,<br />
the means of public transport, the housing, without which an<br />
extended industry could not hope to carry on. I would be<br />
prepared to say that in my own country, the overwhelming bulk of<br />
expenditure in the so-called public sector is basic expenditure<br />
in the private sector. May I take just one rather striking<br />
illustration. The famous Snowy Mountains Scheme at the headwaters<br />
of the Snowy, Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers, will, when<br />
completed, have cost well over Å 400 million, all provided by the<br />
Commonwealth Government and therefore to be called expenditure in<br />
the public sector. Yet, apart from some fractional supply of<br />
electric power to the Australian Capital Territory, and to<br />
governments in New South Wales and Victoria, the great purposes of<br />
the Snowy Scheme are to provide hydro-electric power and light to<br />
private industries and private citizens, at cost, and to provide<br />
through its great dams and lakes, water for the </p>
<p>irrigation of the thousands of privately owned and operated farms<br />
which will be brought into existence.<br />
There are other old prejudices and limitations of<br />
outlook in the industrial world. Let me look at some of them<br />
quite frankly. In the economic field, now so directly and indirectly<br />
affected by government economic policies and actions, it has<br />
become essential that industrial leaders should understand<br />
something of politics, should, by getting to know something of<br />
the complexity of national and international economic problems,<br />
come to understand that it is dangerous as well as selfish, to<br />
behave like a pressure group. We have all seen occasions when<br />
representative bodies in the business and industrial world have<br />
demanded higher import duties at a time when the best judgment of a<br />
wise and well-informed government might lead it to increase imports in<br />
the interest of some international trading advantage. It is, I<br />
suppose, natural that many men in industry should take short views and<br />
be affected by the prospect of some immediate advantage. After<br />
all, very few of us look over the wall of our own garden to get<br />
a picture of the outside world. It is simple, and tempting,<br />
to demand reductions of taxation when things are going well,<br />
( so that they may go even better!), and not always popular to<br />
point out that, while deficits in Government budgets are appropriate<br />
in times of recession, they could hardly be deliberately planned<br />
at a time of expansionary growth and inflationary pressures.<br />
In short, there is still a considerable failure of<br />
mutual understanding. Governments have a disposition to be<br />
over-statistical and sometimes if I may make such a confession<br />
to lean too heavily on economic orthodoxy or its current version<br />
in a highly unorthodox and muddled world, where the laws of -reason<br />
or of nature receive much violent treatment. We have discovered<br />
that, in evaluating the effects of some economic measure, statistics<br />
are not enough, for in their very nature, statistics are always<br />
out of date. This is one of the reasons for my own Government's<br />
consultations with industrial leaders whose knowledge is gained at<br />
first hand in the factory and the market-place.<br />
It is one of the occupational hazards of political<br />
leadership or responsibility that, in our anxiety to avoid the<br />
dangers of travelling in a " wilderness of single instances", of<br />
being induced by hard cases into bad laws, we may, under the<br />
compulsion to make laws of wide and general application, come to<br />
treat men and women as just ciphers in a calculation, and not as<br />
individual human beings whose individual welfare and development<br />
must be the greatest ultimate concern of government. </p>
<p>Avoidance of this hazard requires constant contact<br />
with people as well as papers, with practical managers of<br />
industry as well as economists, with the people who provide the<br />
revenues as well as those who spend them, with TradesUnions as<br />
well as organisations of employers.<br />
For, if we are to be civilised people in truth as<br />
well as in name, we must be members one of another. For me,<br />
the perfect society would be one in which, by equality of<br />
opportunity and a full development of individual character and<br />
talent, each citizen was independent in his own heart and mind,<br />
but all citizens were inter-dependent in all social rights and<br />
duties. dHas it ever occurred to you that, in spite of our<br />
parliamentary democracy, the characteristic of which is that<br />
the rulers and the ruled are the same people, putting into or<br />
casting out of Parliament those of their own number whom they<br />
freely choose, and thus coming to obey laws of their own making,<br />
we still hear on all sides " why doesn't the Government do this or<br />
that or cure this or that?", as if the Government was a foreign<br />
body. I cannot suppose that this engaging habit is peculiar to<br />
Australia. But it illustrates a serious defect in our social<br />
development. Politics is too often, and by too many politicians,<br />
seen as a clash of material interests, a " dialectical materialism".<br />
Employment is seen, by too many advocates, as importing an inevitable<br />
conflict between the interests of the employer and of the employee.<br />
And there are those with " webbed and inward turning eye" who appear<br />
to believe that there is a conflict betwee i government and industry,<br />
that they do not understand each other and never will, and that<br />
in this conflict each must get the better of the other if it can.<br />
I imagine that the pure Socialist, the stern unbending nationaliser<br />
of all industry, will seek to get rid of this conflict by making<br />
Government the master. If our antipodean experience counts for<br />
anything, the creation of a nationalised industry does not dispose<br />
of the other problem of employer-employee relationships, but<br />
rather complicates them by adding political overtones to industrial<br />
demands. In all these matters, we need a greater sense of<br />
inter-dependence. The great common interest in any industry is<br />
that it should be successful, growing, and profitable. Only<br />
thus can it provide a growing employment, good wages and conditions,<br />
and personal security.<br />
I do not want to be misunderstood on these points.<br />
Though I am the leader of a great non-Socialist party, I am not<br />
a doctrinaire anti-Socialist. I recognise that there are some </p>
<p>things which, in their very nature, lend themselves to government<br />
management or control. Over our history in Australia, we have<br />
established government control of the postal, telegraphic, and<br />
telephonic services, the international communication services, the<br />
railways. In a . country like Australia at least, such things lend<br />
themselves to Government monopoly control, which nobody seeks to<br />
change. But the practical difference between the Socialist<br />
and the non-Socialist seems to be this. People like myself,<br />
before resorting to State Management, first seek for the private<br />
enterprise answer, Only when that is not forthcoming do we put<br />
the Government in charge. The Socialist approaches the problem<br />
from the opposite direction. He seeks first the Socialist<br />
solution, and turns reluctantly to private enterprise only when<br />
the Socialist plan proves to be unworkable. I, of course, know<br />
but little of your domestic politics, nor would I dream of<br />
embarrassing you by intervening in them. But I do know something<br />
of the politics of my own country where, strangely enough, we have<br />
parties superficially not unlike your-own* I will, therefore,<br />
illustrate my point by reference, exclusively to Australia. It<br />
must be admitted that the way of the Socialist in Australia is made<br />
harder by reason of our Federal Constitution, with its division of<br />
legislative authority between Commonwealth and States, and its<br />
specific prohibitions of certain types of law, whether Commonwealth<br />
or State. To economise on time, I will take three examples of<br />
what I mean. The Commonwealth's power over broadcasting is<br />
attributed to its specific constitutional power to make laws<br />
with respect to " postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like<br />
services". The first people to enter upon broadcasting in a<br />
business way were private citizens. The business grew and became<br />
more complicated. To avoid chaos, government intervened, first by<br />
negotiating the acquisition of certain leading stations and then,<br />
in 1932 by creating an Australian Broadcasting Commission more or<br />
less on the model of the BB. C.<br />
By 1942 the present pattern was established, The<br />
AB. C. conducts national broadcasting services and is sustained<br />
largely by listeners licence fees. There are licensed commercial<br />
stations, which derive their revenue from advertising. This dual<br />
system, though occasionally threatened by the Socialists, has<br />
worked well, with a good deal of co-operation between " overnment<br />
and industry. Australians would, in my opinion, strongly resist<br />
a government monopoly of such a pervasive and persuasive means of<br />
communication, instruction, and political propaganda, The dual </p>
<p>system preserves the right of choice of the individual listener,<br />
and, by competition, improves efficiency.<br />
More recently, we have dealt with television in the<br />
same way, and for the same reasons.<br />
My second example is that of the Civil Air Services.<br />
These were pioneered by private enterprise, and with a great deal<br />
of success. The Labour Government in 1945 decided to nationalise<br />
the industry by first creating a National Airlines Commission with<br />
power to conduct air services, and then, by a series of statutory<br />
devices, giving it a monopoly, thus eliminating the private<br />
services. The High Court found that the creation of a monopoly<br />
in interstate air services violated Section 92 of the Constitution.<br />
Since then, we have enjoyed the dual system, which provides a most<br />
healthy competition, and has resulted in a very high . standard of<br />
efficiency and safety. This system is not by any means accepted<br />
by the Labour Party, but I think it will survive.<br />
My third example is in interstate shipping coastal<br />
shipping where a successful Commonwealth Shipping Line operates in<br />
competition with private shipping companies.<br />
These examples show that government organisms and<br />
private enterprise can live together to the public advantage.<br />
At the very least, they dispose of the false hypothesis that<br />
there is an inevitable conflict between government and industry,<br />
and that such a conflict can be resolved only by victory for one<br />
side. You may think these remarks to be rambling, and even<br />
irrelevant. Yet they all tend to confirm the truth that there is<br />
an interdependence between government and industry.<br />
Certain matters which seemed simple to me when I was<br />
young now seem to me most difficult. This is inevitable when<br />
you begin by seeing the problem from a distance and end by seeing it<br />
from the inside. One lives and learns. Some things I have<br />
learned to believe most strongly can be put in a short series of<br />
propositions. 1. Rising material standards of life in a democracy<br />
cannot be adequately attained unless industries<br />
are developed, production increased, and the resources<br />
of the nation expanded. They will not be attained<br />
by a simple process of redistribution, nor by the<br />
creation of a state of affairs in which we are all<br />
employed by and dependent upon the State.<br />
2. An uncontrolled and unregulated free competitive<br />
enterprise would tend to destroy the weak, impoverish<br />
the poor, and reduce that dignity of the individual </p>
<p>man and wompn which it must be the purpose of<br />
democracy to create and enhance.<br />
3. By seeking a compromise between these two extremes<br />
we do not, as in the case of many compromises, arrive<br />
at a weak solution. Paradoxically, we arrive at a<br />
strong one. When we blend the two ideas, with<br />
common sense and a spirit of co-operation, we secure<br />
a modern state inii which there is more to distribute<br />
because private citizens have been encouraged to<br />
produce more, for profit and reward, and have been<br />
helped to regard life as an adventure and not a<br />
folding of the hands with a feeling of absolute<br />
security. In that state the private entkepreneur<br />
will observe his social and industrial responsibilities,<br />
partly because 4overnment requires him to do so, but,<br />
even more importantly, because he realises that the<br />
adventures of discovery and risk investment, and<br />
advances in skill and management, will reap their<br />
richest harvest if the people employed in the enterprise<br />
feel that they are getting their share in advancing<br />
prospects and their full recognition as human beings.<br />
In brief, it is in co-operation that we will do best.<br />
Within that framework, there will still be conflicts about wages and<br />
hours and long leave and retirement benefits and health schemes,<br />
and even mutual criticism of Rovernment's bureaucratic tendencies and<br />
the insensibility of the individual manufacturer to the overall<br />
economic needs of the country. But they will all be more readily<br />
resolved if all concerned are conscious of the paramount need for<br />
co-operative effort in what is seen to be the common cause.<br />
I will conclude by elaborating this a little.<br />
Interdependence in leadership is designed to nourish a<br />
sense of interdependence among the people, and in turn to be<br />
nourished by it.<br />
In my experience, all democratic governments are<br />
accused by their opponents of sudden changes of policy. I will<br />
not argue about this, except to say that changes of emphasis,<br />
and changes made from time to time to meet special circumstances,<br />
are not necessarily changes of policy. Rigidity of mind and<br />
common sense must frequently be in conflict.<br />
But I do believe that if we are to avoid what will<br />
appear to be sudden decisions, or if we are to avert some of their<br />
unhappy consequences, we must face up to some of the underlying<br />
elements ( not always visible) in a sound national progress and a<br />
developing economic strength. </p>
<p>11.<br />
I have, I think, time to mention two of them.<br />
One of them is public morale. If people know what<br />
a government is aiming at, and what great industrialists are<br />
aiming at, and they have respect for the honesty of purpose of<br />
the leaders in each field, they will be less liable to panic<br />
or to depression. This was gloriously proved by Winston Churchill<br />
during the war. Great things though he did in many fields, his<br />
vital contribution to victory was his fostering of morale. He<br />
saw more clearly than most, and expressed more clearly than any,<br />
that morale was the essential basis of survival and of victory.<br />
What he did in war is no less necessary in peace.<br />
Our economy tends to be plagued by booms and depressions. These<br />
close relatives do not arise from purely material factors or<br />
possess some inevitable character. Each is contributed to, if<br />
not entirely created by, psychological factors. In the more<br />
primitive days of banking, the " run on the bank" was the psychological<br />
cause of insolvency much more frequently than it was the result.<br />
In modern times, we have seen depressions accelerated by caution<br />
and pessimism on the part of management as much as by fear in the<br />
minds of the customers. As I once heard a noted economist say,<br />
back at the beginning of the thirties, " Prices fall because<br />
they fall!", i. e., because people tend to stop buying on a falling<br />
market. If people understood the reasons for temporary fluctuations,<br />
if they understood the purpose of government financial measures.<br />
designed to increase or reduce the volume of purchasing power, to<br />
restrain inflation or to encourage expansion, they would be less<br />
inclined to aggravate their own problems.<br />
This is, of course, easy to say. The civilian problems<br />
of peace are less concentrated and less intelligible than the<br />
civilian problems of war. But, if we had, in government and in<br />
industry, a clearer sense of co-operation, of joint responsibility,<br />
we might make a massive contribution to the spirit and morale of<br />
our people. The other element goes beyond an understanding of<br />
what we, government and industry, are doing and intending. It<br />
concerns itself with what private citizens make of what they are<br />
doing and intending theiselves. For it is upon their self<br />
reliance and enterprise that our whole structure must be based.<br />
They are under great temptations today, in the era of what has been<br />
called " the welfare State". It will be fatal if they come to<br />
regard the government as the only creator of all good things, as the<br />
perennially solvent guarantor of personal prosperity for all.<br />
For governments, and government departments, are administrative<br />
rather than creative, nor can any government guarantee or financial<br />
provision be any more effective than the sum capacity of the<br />
people, as producers and earners and taxpayers, to provide. </p>
