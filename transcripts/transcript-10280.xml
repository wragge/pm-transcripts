22 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE CARE AUSTRALIA<br />
ANNIVERSARY DINNER<br />
GRAND HYATT, MELBOURNE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much to Malcolm Fraser, the Chairman of Care Australia; to my<br />
Parliamentary colleagues, Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, Robert Hill, the<br />
Leader of the Government in the Senate, Barry Jones, the National President of the<br />
Australian Labor Party, to other very distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Can I say firstly how very happy I am to share this very special occasion marking the<br />
anniversary of the establishment of Care Australia. It is an opportunity to reflect<br />
upon the selfless contribution of so many people who work for a magnificent and<br />
generous organisation in the relief of the very unhappy circumstances of people all<br />
around the world.<br />
Care is an organisation that as Malcolm mentioned began in the United States at the<br />
end of World War II. I didn't know until tonight when Malcolm mentioned it, and it<br />
shows that you still keep learning things from former Prime Ministers, that Care had<br />
been instrumental in such a major way in breaking the Berlin air lift.<br />
To those of us in recent years Care of course is, I suppose, ineradicably associated<br />
with the suffering of people particularly in Africa. And it's an occasion such as this for<br />
me on behalf of the Government to thank those men and women of Australia who have<br />
gone to these very troubled parts of the world, given of their effort, in some cases<br />
given of their health and their lives to relieve the suffering of others.<br />
And none of course has been a better and properly honoured example of that than<br />
Malcolmn's own daughter, Phoebe, who's with us tonight whose contribution has been<br />
quite remarkable. But I know that she would not want herself to be singled out, but<br />
she's but one of many Australians who have done such magnificent work. </p>
<p>Care is an organisation that has sustained by the generous help and the generous<br />
donations of people in Australia. It's an organisation that has had amongst its<br />
executive officers people with whom I've had a great deal of connection. And I can't<br />
let an occasion like tonight go by without remarking on the presence of Tony Eggleton<br />
who did such magnificent work for Care. Tony and Malcolm and I, of course, go back<br />
a long way and I'm so delighted to be here tonight and to be in company of both of<br />
them. And can I say very genuinely how much I respect what Malcolm Fraser has put<br />
back into the community since he ceased his active parliamentary political days. He<br />
has set a wonderful example of community service and it's one that I respect<br />
enormously. And an occasion like this, of course, is an opportunity to reflect upon the importance<br />
of non-governiment organisations in the provision of overseas aid. It's also an<br />
opportunity to reflect upon the ongoing importance of official government assistance.<br />
Australia provides, and I acknowledge the point that the Chairman has made about it<br />
not quite being enough, but Australia nonetheless provides in the order of SI1.6 billion<br />
of official overseas assistance. And I guess many of you would know that the country<br />
that receives as a nation the largest single portion of that is Papua New Guinea. And<br />
at a time when the affairs of that country are occupying the attention of the<br />
Government and occupying the attention of many Australians, it's opportune and I<br />
think appropriate for me to say to those in the Australian community who criticise the<br />
fact that we have any overseas aid at all, let alone argue about the particular level of it,<br />
it's an opportunity and I think it's right to say that if we are concerned about the<br />
stability of that country and if we have concerns about its immediate fuxture in current<br />
circumstances we can only imagine what might be the case if that country had not,<br />
over the years, been provided with significant levels of aid by Australia. It is not only<br />
an exercise in humanitarian assistance of relatively wealthy nations such as Australia to<br />
give official assistance, but it is also a matter of the long term self-interest of this<br />
country to give intelligent overseas aid. At the present time there's an inquiry being<br />
conducted into the structure and character and nature of overseas aid chaired by the<br />
former Chairman of Woolworths, Mr Paul Simons. And the Government will have<br />
that report and will be responding to that in the near future. But let me say to all of<br />
you that whilst there will be debates about the actual level of aid, and there will be<br />
proper submissions put to my Government as they were put to the predecessor<br />
government of Australia, I think I can say without any fear of political contradiction<br />
that official overseas aid in significant proportions will remain a very important element<br />
of Australian budgets for years into the fiuture.<br />
When we think of non-government organisations, of course, we think of the generosity<br />
around Australia of literally hundreds of thousands of individuals who give, in many<br />
cases small amounts but for them proportionately very large amounts, to help<br />
organisations such as Care and the other great non-government organisations. We also<br />
think of the very generous corporate support. And I want to acknowledge the<br />
contribution of corporate Australia and the philanthropy of corporate Australia to<br />
organisations; such as Care.<br />
In the context of the Government's ' work for the dole' scheme I have spoken often in<br />
recent weeks at what I call the notion of mutual obligation within our society. And<br />
I've expressed the belief that a society such as our own will only hold together </p>
<p>cohesively and effectively if we are underpinned by a pattern of mutual obligations.<br />
We provide assistance for those within our own community who through no fault of<br />
their own need assistance, and on occasions it is not unreasonable that something be<br />
asked in return from them and that is a principle that I've articulated in relation to the<br />
work for the dole' scheme. And I don't think it is wrong for me to articulate that<br />
same principle in relation to the obligations of those in the community, including in<br />
corporate Australia and those in the more affluent sections of the Australian<br />
community who can afford to do so, that a principle of mutual obligation exists in<br />
relation to their support for and contributions towards worthy causes to organisations<br />
like Care.<br />
Australia provides for its corporate citizens a climate of unrivalled political economic<br />
and legal stability. Quite legitimately, companies and their managers will complain<br />
about this or that government policy, whoever is in power, or this or that set of<br />
economnic circumstances. But if you look around the world there are few countries in<br />
which it is easier to do business. There are few countries in which, in overall terms,<br />
there is a more beckoning business environment and business climate. And I have no<br />
reluctance, particularly on an occasion such as tonight, I have no reluctance at all in<br />
asserting in that context the principle of mutual obligation. There is an obligation on<br />
those within our community I don't state it in any kind of hectoring or preaching<br />
sense, but I state it perhaps, to some degree, in a self interest sense so far as the<br />
corporations are concerned there is an obligation to make contributions to<br />
organisations such as Care. And of course tonight's magnificent dinner marking the<br />
anniversary of the foundation of Care Australia is supported by so many<br />
Australian companies and so many Australian individuals who've given very<br />
generously of their time and their resources, of their money over the years to support<br />
Care. I had the opportunity earlier this morning of spending a fascinating hour with the<br />
former Chairman of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin-Powell. And he<br />
remarked upon the fact that the world has changed so much over the past few years<br />
with the collapse of communism and the end of the Cold War that we no longer have<br />
the enemy we'd had for most of our lifetime. And that that rivalry between the<br />
communist world and the capitalist world, that rivalry between east and west, which<br />
had really patterned and determined and conditioned our responses and our attitudes<br />
over such a long period of time, the disappearance of that had left almost a political<br />
void, almost a political vacuum. But we also agreed that it had given the world a<br />
tremendous opportunfity and had given many people a great sense of hope about our<br />
capacity to turn our attention to the relief of suffering and unhappiness and distress in<br />
particular parts of the world. And none of us, not only on occasions such as this but<br />
none of us generally can of course be other than impressed very heavily by the<br />
enormous gaps between the rich and poor around the world as well as the growing<br />
evidence unhappily of those gaps within our own society. And the contribution that<br />
Care makes to the relief of human misery, the contribution that it makes to the<br />
provision of resources that will generate self help and self support and providing<br />
people with a way of lifling the pall of dependency on others and generating hope and<br />
optimism about their own fives and their own future is of course a very, very worthy<br />
aspiration now, as it always has been, for mankind. </p>
<p>And whatever may be the difficulties within our own domestic economy, whatever<br />
arguments we may have about whether this or that way of doing things could be<br />
improved within Australia. We are amongst the most fortunate, the most blessed and<br />
the most happy and stable and wealthy of societies in the world. And that does put a<br />
moral obligation as well as an obligation of long term pragmatism upon the<br />
Government of Australia and upon the citizens of Australia to make proper provision<br />
for programmes and organisations that are determined over a period of time to help<br />
those who need help most. And the challenge is immense. The marvels of modemn<br />
communications have dramatised human suffering into the living rooms of Australia<br />
and the living rooms of the world and the living rooms of the affluent in a way that<br />
hasn't been the case in earlier years and all of us, as a consequence, are very conscious<br />
of that. But of course there is that danger of disaster or ' poverty fatigue' as I think the<br />
experts have called it, that danger that we see so much of it that we become numb,<br />
almost indifferent to it. And that is why we need organisations such as Care to<br />
intelligently mobilise on an ongoing basis for concern of the community and the<br />
concern of the Australian people.<br />
But ladies and gentlemen can I say how much I respect and admire the work of Care.<br />
Can I remark upon what it has achieved in Australia over the last 10 years. Can I<br />
thank on behalf of my Government, and I know on behalf I'm sure of the Opposition*<br />
as well, can I thank Malcolm Fraser and all those who've worked for Care, who've<br />
given their energy and their talents and their commitment. It is a noble cause to help<br />
those who suffer and it is a noble cause to reach out and gather up the less fortunate<br />
and in many cases the wretched and underprivileged within our world and within our<br />
society and Care has been in the forefront of doing that in a practical, efficient,<br />
effective manner. I salute their contribution to mankind and I wish Care Australia<br />
continued success and continued achievement in their great mission of relieving human<br />
misery and promoting human progress.<br />
Thank you. 4 </p>
