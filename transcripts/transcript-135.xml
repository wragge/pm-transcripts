CANCELLATION OF OVERSEAS VISIT BY SENATOR<br />
THE HON. W. H. SPOONER, M. M.<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER.<br />
A visit overseas this month by the Minister for<br />
National Development, Senator Spooner, had been cancelled, the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, said today.<br />
Mr. Menzies was commenting on a news item cabled from<br />
Bangkok that Senator Spooner might visit Thailand later this<br />
month. Mr. Menzies said: " Several South East Asian countries<br />
have extended invitations to the Australian Government for a<br />
senior Australian Minister to visit them.<br />
" Arrangements were well advanced for Senator Spooner<br />
to visit these countrios when, unfortunately, he had to undergo<br />
a minor operation. " Although he has now been able to resume duties here,<br />
his medical advisors have told him that it would be unwise for<br />
him to accept the strain of an overseas tour.<br />
" Accordingly, he has had to cuncol the arrangements.<br />
" Senator Spooner and the Government much regret the<br />
cancellation and the loss of this opportunity to extend Australia's<br />
friendship with these countries."<br />
CANBERRA, 6th November, 1959. </p>
