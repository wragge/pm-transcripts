    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce today the provision of $1 million towards</p>
<p> the re-development of Manuka Oval.</p>
<p>While Manuka Oval is undoubtedly one of the most picturesque grounds</p>
<p> in Australia, the ACT Government and ACT Cricket Association have</p>
<p> been concerned for some time at the standard of facilities at the</p>
<p> Oval.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's funding of developments from the Federation</p>
<p> Fund will complement the $1 million grant which has been committed</p>
<p> by the ACT Government.</p>
<p>In addition to the work underway to refurbish the Bradman Pavilion</p>
<p> and provide improved public and corporate seating, the Commonwealth's</p>
<p> funding will allow public, press, sponsor and player facilities to</p>
<p> be brought up to the standard required by the Australian Cricket Board.</p>
<p>As well as hosting the annual Prime Minister's XI match and the</p>
<p> Canberra Comets in the Mercantile Mutual Cup, the improved facilities</p>
<p> will assist the Association to attract other national and international</p>
<p> sporting fixtures to the Oval, to the benefit of Canberra's economy</p>
<p> and recreational sector.</p>
<p>The upgrade will increase the Oval's chances of hosting Australian</p>
<p> Football League matches in future.</p>
<p>The federal Government's grant of $1 million, in partnership</p>
<p> with the ACT Government's work, will provide significant support</p>
<p> to the Canberra community, and in particular strengthen Canberra's</p>
<p> sporting infrastructure for first class cricket and high standard</p>
<p> Australian Football League games.</p>
<p> 17 December 1998</p>
