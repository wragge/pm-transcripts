PRIME MINISTER]<br />
EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR WOMEN ( UNIFEM) BREAKFAST<br />
HILTON HOTEL, BRISBANE 8.00 AM, MONDAY 9 MARCH 1992<br />
Premier and Mrs Goss, Lord Mayor Soorley, my Minister<br />
Assisting, Wendy Fatin, the President of UNIFEM Australia,<br />
Beverley Perel and our esteemed guest, Ms Teresita Deles,<br />
and friends.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here this morning to join in<br />
your International Women's Day celebrations.<br />
Sometimes the d enomination " women" obscures the reality of<br />
women in society.<br />
Because of the special needs of women many of them caused<br />
or compounded by generations of prejudice and neglect it<br />
is easy to get into the habit of thinking about women as a<br />
minority group.<br />
The truth is, of course, women are more than half of the<br />
population and all government policy has an effect on their<br />
lives, whether it is a specific measure or a broad one.<br />
In Australia today it is not always easy to separate<br />
policies for women from policies for society at large.<br />
But you may be assured that this government is determined to<br />
ensure that all government policies are assessed in regard<br />
to their impact on women.<br />
And we will go on making the specific changes necessary to<br />
improve the conditions under which Australian women live and<br />
to increase their opportunity and choice.<br />
We will continue what has been a steady advance.<br />
But before I talk about the government and Australian women,<br />
I would like to make a few remarks about UNIFEM.<br />
In recent years UNIFEM Australia has done much to heighten<br />
public awareness of International Women's Day through<br />
hosting a number of successful breakfasts like this. </p>
<p>UNIFEM is one of the major international organisations<br />
devoted to improving the status of women. It plays a vital<br />
role in the developing world, giving assistance to women to<br />
exercise control over their lives and to participate more<br />
fully in making decisions.<br />
These occasions provide the opportunity to highlight the<br />
critical role that women play in development.<br />
It is also a chance to consider the changes that still have<br />
to be made if women are to find equal places, and equal<br />
access to them, in the world community.<br />
The government takes an active interest in the improvement<br />
of women's status in the world.<br />
At the current meeting of the United Nations Conference on<br />
Environment and Development, Australia will be calling for<br />
gender equity issues to be incorporated into that body's<br />
work. This meeting is a lead up to the major United Nations<br />
Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio de<br />
Janeiro later this year.<br />
As I'm sure many people here are aware, this conference is<br />
of great importance in the world's quest for sustainable<br />
development. Because women have a major part of the responsibility for<br />
growing the world's food and play a significant part in the<br />
management of the earth's resources, Australia's own aid<br />
program supports UNIFEM's efforts to highlight the role of<br />
women. The integration of women into development programs is both<br />
more equitable and more effective.<br />
It makes better use of the talent and energy residing in all<br />
those women at the heart of economy and society.<br />
For the sake of equity we have to acknowledge the<br />
contribution of women both paid and unpaid. For the sake<br />
of efficiency and commonsense, we must harness their skills,<br />
their ambitions, their energy and their genius.<br />
What is true for the world is true also for Australia.<br />
And I can say with confidence and pride that in the nine<br />
years so far of the Labor government, women have made great<br />
advances and their contribution grows in proportion to<br />
their advance.<br />
I have a feeling, an inkling, that I am not widely regarded<br />
as a feminist:.<br />
This may be because I am regarded rightly as that most<br />
conservative of creatures, a family man. </p>
<p>It may be because my ancestry is Irish.<br />
It may be because ideological denominations have always<br />
worried me a. great deal less than doing things.<br />
My view has been that women will benefit most if the<br />
material circumstances of Australian life are progressively<br />
improved. That I think. is the starting point. As Treasurer I took the<br />
view that if I succeeded in expanding the economy, making it<br />
more robust and secure then I was expanding opportunity,<br />
expanding thme government's ability to undertake programs of<br />
reform and build essential services, increasing employment<br />
and making it possible for people to plan their lives with<br />
confidence. In doing these things, I believe I was doing things of great<br />
benefit to Australian women.<br />
As Prime Minister I continue to take that view, but with<br />
more windows on to it.<br />
As Prime Minister I would like to see less of the nuts and<br />
bolts and more of the world outside.<br />
I incline towards inclusion. I want to lower the<br />
drawbridge. I think we should be looking for ways to increase the<br />
influence of women in national policy and social development<br />
in the culture of Australia.<br />
We will know we are making progress when on both sides we<br />
hear voices which are less adversarial and ideological and<br />
more authentically the voices of Australian women and men.<br />
I think I will feel that we have succeeded when women are to<br />
a greater extent partners in the development of Australia,<br />
shaping much more of the policy for the country as a whole.<br />
I have always thought that the crime in politics was not<br />
thinking the wrong thought, but not doing enough.<br />
Not making the changes which your times demanded.<br />
I have a building block model of reform. I think that if you<br />
put one block down you create the logic and the impetus for<br />
another.. and another.<br />
In time the public sees the shape of your vision becoming<br />
concrete and they actually help you finish.<br />
As I said, my big effort in politics has always been towards<br />
improving the material conditions under which Australians<br />
live. </p>
<p>At a time like this, in a recession, I know that might have<br />
a hollow ring to it.<br />
I can only say that it distresses me that there is so much<br />
distress in Australia at present.<br />
It distresses me all the more because in the l980s we<br />
created jobs, we boosted business, we introduced many<br />
measures which have improved the conditions of life for<br />
Australians in substantial and enduring ways.<br />
But bemoaning it won't solve it. Ideology won't solve it.<br />
My big effort is still towards reform, improvement and<br />
these days that means recovery. I do not know of any other<br />
way. Recovery means jobs for women and men.<br />
Of the 1.5 million jobs we created since the early eighties,<br />
per cent have gone to women.<br />
Women's wages in the same period increased to 84.5% of the<br />
male average, which is very good by OECD standards.<br />
We supported the women who went to work with the Women's<br />
Employment Strategy.<br />
We trebled the number of child care places available, and<br />
250,000 funded places will be created by 1995-96.<br />
In the past two years the number of families receiving fee<br />
relief for long day care has increased by more than 200 per<br />
cent and average, payments have increased by 60 per cent.<br />
These initiatives which increased opportunities for women to<br />
work, were matched by measures which increased the equity<br />
for those who stayed at home to care for children.<br />
Family Allowance was increased and indexed.<br />
The Family Allowance Supplement was introduced for the low<br />
paid and their dependents.<br />
Supplementary payments were introduced for low income<br />
workers mostly women.<br />
I could list a great many other measures which have made<br />
Australian policies in regard to women, in many cases, a<br />
model for other countries.<br />
We established the Child Support Agency, addressed the<br />
poverty traps3 that sole parents face; introduced a<br />
retirement incomes strategy which improves women's access to<br />
superannuation while guaranteeing maintenance of the age<br />
pension; we've trebled rent assistance; introduced the<br />
National Women's Health Strategy; set up the Office of<br />
Indigenous Women to work towards the elimination of </p>
<p>discrimination and disadvantage among Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander women; established the National Committee on<br />
Violence Against Women; introduced a Sex Discrimination Act<br />
and an Affirmative Action Act.<br />
These specific initiatives have been no more or less<br />
important than general measures we have taken to extend<br />
opportunity, strengthen the social net and modernise our<br />
economy and society.<br />
When we doubled the school retention rate, women benefited<br />
more than two out of every three girls now finish secondary<br />
education. More than half of all higher education places are now taken<br />
by women.<br />
Medicare benefited and continues to benefit women.<br />
And of course it would be a travesty if Australian women<br />
felt excluded from our fundamental objective and the<br />
landmark reformsi we have made to achieve it the effort to<br />
build a strong, internationally competitive society for on<br />
our success in this, our future and our children's future<br />
depend. The jobs, the opportunities, the security, social justice,<br />
the quality of our society depend on this.<br />
So then do women depend on it. And it depends on women.<br />
The Economic Statement, One Nation, we released on February<br />
26 builds on our reforms more than that, it sets the scene<br />
for recovery.<br />
One Natio~ n is about strength through partnerships:<br />
partnerships between government and business, the<br />
Commonwealth and the States, employees and employers,<br />
communities. It's a statement of inclusion the idea is to include<br />
everyone in the productive processes, in education and<br />
training, in the social safety net, in the ability to make<br />
the most of and enjoy this country.<br />
It is aimed at creating a greater sense of belonging, a<br />
greater spirit of cooperation, a much greater degree of<br />
social cohesion.<br />
As it closes gaps between people it closes distances<br />
with a national rail freight highway which makes the<br />
country economically much more efficient and the<br />
highways safer for cars<br />
city ring roads which have a similar effect: </p>
<p>an electricity grid which, by combining our resources<br />
and building in an element of competition, will make<br />
electricity cheaper<br />
by deregulating the airline industry which will make<br />
travel cheaper.<br />
The idea behind One Nation is to build Australia's strength<br />
to build a recovery which will carry us well into the<br />
future. The idea is to set common national goals and create a<br />
stronger sense of national purpose.<br />
It is to pull this vast and sometimes divided country<br />
together. I would like to think that everyone in this room will read<br />
the One Nati,= document.<br />
In conjunction with the National Agenda for Women which lays<br />
out the government's objectives through the next decade I<br />
think it lays out real and achievable reforms, reforms which<br />
wi1ll hP undertaken, which will benefit all Australians.<br />
This year we will be reviewing our progress in the<br />
implementation of the action plans of the National Agenda<br />
and setting our goals for the rest of the decade.<br />
One Nation will create 800,000 new jobs.<br />
Areas of particular benefit to women include the Textile,<br />
Clothing and. Footwear Industry which will receive<br />
$ 51 million to help the industry adjust, become more<br />
efficient an~ d sd create secure jobs in manufacturing.<br />
The tourism industry, which employs a high proportion of<br />
women, will benefit enormously from deregulation of the<br />
airlines, the improvement to our roads and new depreciation<br />
allowances on tourist related buildings.<br />
One Nation also ' contains substantial new incentives to small<br />
and medium business, many of which, of course, are owned and<br />
run by women, and in which many women work.<br />
Reforms to Australian workplaces which will make Australian<br />
business and industry much more efficient will have also<br />
have a profound effect on working women's lives.<br />
Enterprise bargaining will make it possible to negotiate<br />
flexible working-time arrangements and other improvements to<br />
make workplaces more compatible with family life and<br />
responsibilities. We have also established a Work and Family Unit in the<br />
Department of Industrial Relations to explain to employers<br />
the advantages of having family friendly practices in the<br />
workplace. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the government will continue to guarantee that the<br />
wages system is equitable and protects those with little or<br />
no bargaining power.<br />
The government emphatically does not believe in the<br />
" survival of the fittest" among Australian workers.<br />
The $ 720 million we have allocated to vocational training<br />
will be a great benefit to women, particularly as this<br />
massive funding increase goes hand in hand with the specific<br />
direction in the National Agenda to improve training and<br />
employment outcomes for women.<br />
The One Nati. n statement increases assistance to families on<br />
low and medium incomes.<br />
It makes rental assistance immediately available to people<br />
in need.<br />
This is to name just a few of the measures One Nation<br />
contains. The statement combines, I believe, a mix of the bold and<br />
enduring nation-building projects Australia needs, and<br />
measures which will help people through the hard times.<br />
The point of One Nation is the point of my government get<br />
the economy moving, get people back to work.<br />
Do it the only way it can be done: do it by calling on all<br />
of our strength our resources, our institutions, our<br />
people. Do it in partnership. Build the partnerships.<br />
At the start I said that it is increasingly difficu Lt to<br />
conceive of women as a distinct social or economic category.<br />
There is a long way to go before we reach the point when<br />
discrimination has been eliminated, the extra difficulties<br />
for women in the community, in the workplace, the home and<br />
in business have vanished, and we don't so frequent~ y<br />
include women among the disadvantaged.<br />
But I think one can read in the signs evidence of social<br />
progress. We're getting there, we've made more headway in the last<br />
nine years thian we made in the previous hundred, and we' re<br />
going to make a lot more in the next nine.<br />
I am sufficiently proud of what has been achieved and<br />
confident enough of what can and will be, to say that I can<br />
help. I think we can build a very good society in Australia and<br />
its key element will have to be the opportunities, the<br />
chance to participate and have a voice, the options of work </p>
<p>and home, the security, and the centrality of women in this<br />
one nation.<br />
I must conclude by congratulating UNIFEM on the great work<br />
it is doing.<br />
I trust that my comments today were not taken to mean a lack<br />
of interest in the condition of women in the developing<br />
world. Far from it the government will continue to support UNIFEM<br />
and remains committed to its objectives.<br />
But today, I have taken the opportunity to tell Australian<br />
women that, of all the partnerships we seek in the<br />
One Natin Statement, none is more significant than that<br />
between the women and men of Australia. Here, no less than<br />
in the developing countries, Australia needs their skills<br />
and energy and we' will only reach the goal of the good<br />
society we want by continuing to extend their influence.<br />
Thank you for having me. </p>
