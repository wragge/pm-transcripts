    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC will lead a new Joint Agency Coordination Centre (the JACC) that will be based in Perth to coordinate the Australian Government's support for the search into MH370.</p>
<p>A former Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Houston is an individual of enormous experience and great skill who has already served his country with distinction.</p>
<p>Australia is providing extensive logistical and other support to the Government of Malaysia in the investigation into MH370.</p>
<p>The new JACC will work with key Commonwealth, state and international stakeholders including the families, friends and international media.</p>
<p>The JACC will ensure that the search being coordinated by AMSA and ATSB is reinforced by strong liaison with all the relevant stakeholders, including the families of the passengers.</p>
<p>The JACC will provide a single contact point for families to gain up-to-date information and travel assistance including visa services, accommodation advice, interpreter services and counselling.  </p>
<p>The Australian Government has already announced that visa fees will be waived for affected families.</p>
<p>This multi-country search is a powerful example of international cooperation at a time of adversity.</p>
<p>Military air crew from Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and the United States are searching for possible debris from MH370.</p>
<p>They have been conducting these searches over a very large area in challenging conditions, far from the Western Australian coast and in variable weather.</p>
