AT K" IPO AIRPORT, SEOUL 6TH APRIL, 1967<br />
Your Excellency Prime Minister Holt, Mrs. Holt,<br />
distinguished members of the entourage and dear fellow citizens.<br />
On behalf of the Government and neonle of Korea I<br />
wish to extend my warmest welcome to Prime : inister and Mrs.<br />
Holt, who have come a long way from Australia, one of our closest<br />
allies. The Korean people vividly recall how the Australian<br />
people came to our aid in our time of dire need. Je are also<br />
fully aware of the great contrioutions Australia is making in the<br />
cause of peace and progress in the Asian and Pacific re. ion. When<br />
our independence and future were at stake on accoint of the<br />
unprovoked communist invasion in 1950, Australia was among the<br />
first free nations to dispatch combat troops of ' round, naval<br />
and air forces to this country to help us defend our Republic<br />
from external aggression.<br />
Indeed, we feel forever indeated to those memoers of<br />
the Australian armed forces who, despite enormous hardships,<br />
valiantly fought in an alien land in the cause of freedom and<br />
justice, marking brilliant records in the annals of the Korean<br />
ar through their noble sacrifices. At the time when the comiunist<br />
forces launched a full-scale offensive in the spring of 1951, the<br />
all'ant Australian soldiers in the now famous battle of Kapyong,<br />
though greatly outnumoered and under adverse conditions, held t<br />
their positions to the last, helping the allied forces secure<br />
their vital positions and finally frustrate the enemy's offensive.<br />
Their gallantry and heroism are still fresh in our memory.<br />
Through various United iations relief programmes the<br />
Colombo Plan and the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia<br />
and the Far East, Australia has helped us in the rehabilitation<br />
of the war-torn country and the achievement of social and cultural<br />
pro ress. As a memuer of the United nations Commission for<br />
Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea Aust-ralia has also been<br />
working strenuously toward our goal of bringing about a unified,<br />
democratic and independent Korea.<br />
Our hearts are overwhelmed today with deep sentiments<br />
in welcoming Prime Minister Holt, the great leader of the Australian<br />
people who have done so much for us.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, the Australian people have overcome<br />
many an obstacle including adverse natural conditions to brin about<br />
abundance and wealth, prosperity and welfare for themselves. Now<br />
they are sparing no effort in helping other free Asian nations<br />
overcome their adversities. Australia has also taken active part<br />
in SEATO, ANZUS, ASPAC, the Manila Summit Conference and the<br />
Asian Development 3ank, thereby contriouting greatly to the<br />
progress and prosperity in the Asian and Pacific region and to<br />
the collective security of the free nations in this part of the<br />
world. the Korean people, have great admiration for your<br />
people's courage, resourcefulness and the spirit of co-operation.<br />
In Korea, we have been able to attain remarkable / 2 </p>
