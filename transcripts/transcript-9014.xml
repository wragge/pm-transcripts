TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP KOUION ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE, SUNDAY, 24<br />
OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, it has been another long day of talking, as we are getting<br />
towards the end of this conference, do you 6un the Commonwealth is any<br />
more or less relevant now than it was at the befinning?<br />
PM: I think it is a very useful body, it is a dispara-1 body drawn from right across<br />
the landscape from the countries of the world and it can play a very useful role.<br />
It does deliver, apart from concentration on issues like South Africa which it<br />
has done effectively and Rhodesia in years gone by, this year the GATT. It has<br />
also focussed attention on things it can do ii: self as a program deliverer of<br />
things like education and health into certain countries and that was the subject<br />
of today's discussions. There is the Commonwealth fund for technical cooperation;<br />
Commonwealth health programs and the some evaluation of the<br />
efficiency of the Secretariat it was an administrative day. But these are the<br />
things, I think, the Commonwealth does and does rather well.<br />
J: How do you feel about the sort of big pictuie demands that people like Dr<br />
Mahathir are calling for Commonwealth interv,. ntion or action of Bosnia. Do<br />
you think there is a role there?<br />
PM: No, the Commonwealth is not a crisis management organisation. That is a role<br />
which is properly with the UN. I think if it tries,. to extend itself into those sorts<br />
of areas, I think it will get into trouble. Now t lere was some of this discussed<br />
yesterday and I made that point, that the Cormmonwealth should pick its mark<br />
and do the things it can do and not try and do the things it is not set up to do. I<br />
know people get distressed about these varioL s situations in various parts of<br />
the world. Indeed here in Cyprus a country which is divided. But, the<br />
Commonwealth can't fulfil that role, but it can c: o other things and it is a matter<br />
of deciding what it can do and what it can't do. </p>
<p>J. o you have majority support Prime Minister, ; 1mongst the -Other leaders'?<br />
PM: I think so, I think that was very broadly reflected yesterday that view about<br />
what the Commonwealth can do and can't do and what it should do. It is an<br />
effective body I think, for certain things, but there is no point in over claiming<br />
for it or over reaching for it because to do that is to transgress upon the field of<br />
other organisations like the United Nations or the World Bank or the IMF. So,<br />
it is a case of the specialised dialogue it can promote and the work it can do<br />
and the programs it can deliver are things of substance and they are important<br />
in they're right and it doesn't have to go doing things which other agencies and<br />
organisations, in fact, are set up to do.<br />
J: Prime Minister in your view, what are the major threads that Commonwealth<br />
leaders will have to pull together in preparatior for the final communique?<br />
PM: I think that is probably all revealed now in terms of the discussion on the<br />
GATT. I think some of the themes which we discussed yesterday that is,<br />
some of the things around the agenda for peace themes run by the UN<br />
Secretary-General and the program delivery issues which we discussed today.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Queen talked the other day of changing the<br />
Commonwealth. Some of the British papers are now canvassing the idea that<br />
Prince Charles perhaps could become Head of the Commonwealth, what do<br />
you think of that idea?<br />
PM: I have never heard of that idea. I think, tha Queen has managed to keep,<br />
obviously, a personal association with the Commonwealth all these years and<br />
takes the opportunity on every Commonwealth meeting, I think, to meet each<br />
Head of Government and to participate appropriately in the proceedings of the<br />
meetings. So in that sense, I think, she is a unifying and binding element on the<br />
Commonwealth.<br />
J: Do you think she should stay on in that role?<br />
PM: It is not for me to say, nor is it for me to comment on Fleet Street stonies.<br />
J: Do you think it is the sort of job that someonie like Charles would be able to<br />
handle?<br />
PM: I think, Prince Charles is quite competent at whatever he has turned his hand to<br />
in the various things he has taken an interest in, but to say that is to say the<br />
obvious isn't it, rather to endorse him for any role with the Commonwealth.<br />
That is a matter entirely for the Queen herself<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Commonwealth is made up mainly of developing countries.<br />
Is there a danger that there just won't be enough money to keep an Organisation<br />
like this doing the things that the Commonwealth wants to do? </p>
<p>PM: There is always a discussion every meeting about resources and there was a<br />
discussion about resources today. These are in the main -made up, the great<br />
bulk of them are made up by the developed countries and countries are<br />
assessed, but most countries make a contribution. So, the body is well funded<br />
and there has been efficiency reviews in the lasi year or two and the Secretary-<br />
General was talking about those today. So, I don't think resources are a<br />
problem, it is a matter of having it adequately resourced and efficiently<br />
delivering its programs.<br />
J Would you prefer a shorter CHOGM next time perhaps?<br />
PM: I think they could be shorter. T made those remarks today. In fact they meet<br />
every two years, I suggested they could meet every three and probably for<br />
three days rather than five.<br />
J: How did that go down?<br />
PM: I am not sure all that well, but the fact is it had to be said and I said it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you got a round of applause when you mentioned Mabo<br />
reconciliation in the opening speech, there arc suggestions at home that the<br />
Coalition there are divisions within the Liberal party about the way the<br />
leadership is handling the issue, do you think that the Liberal party and the<br />
leaders specifically, there is an element of racism in their response to Mabo?<br />
PM: That is extreme language, but I think the federal Opposition would be wise to<br />
join the rest of the country in supporting a Ma: oo settlement, a comprehensive<br />
one. I think it is better for the Aboriginal and Islander community of Australia<br />
that such a settlement enjoys the full support of the parliament. But, there is a<br />
lot of interest in it here at CHOGM because I think that countries are interested<br />
in Australia and they are interested to see what we do with our indigenes.<br />
J: Has this been a particularly successful CHOGM in terms of Australia's role and<br />
Australia's interest given the predominance of issues such as GATT and other<br />
things?<br />
PM: We pursue our interests and I think single mindi. dly on the issues that matter to<br />
us, obviously trade at the moment is topical to us and the GATT and we have<br />
pursued that because we think this is a very effective forum to promote a<br />
successful conclusion of the GATT. We hav, 1 a thought through position I<br />
think, on most things and on an agenda such as the one which has been<br />
promoted at this meeting. We have had a position on each and every item. So,<br />
I think we have come well prepared and we take the business of the<br />
Commonwealth seriously.<br />
J: Prime Minister, one more question on rcconciliation and that is the<br />
entombment of the unknown soldier. Dr Hewson has is apparently wishing to<br />
be one of the pall bearers, do you think that wculd be reasonable for him to be<br />
joining you? </p>
<p>PM: I will think about that when I get home, if he says anything about it to me.<br />
J: Prime Minster, you are to meet the Singapore Prime Minister tomorrow, what<br />
do you hope to get out of that and what sort cf subjects are you going to rely<br />
on?<br />
PM: I think mutual trade and investment issues, the politics of the area and also<br />
APEC because Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is going to Seattle and he will<br />
be interested in APEC and I would be interested in his thoughts about how the<br />
APEC discussion is developing.<br />
J: Would you hope that a person like the Prime Minister of Singapore would act<br />
as an honest broker if you like in further discussions with Dr Mahathir?<br />
PM: I didn't raise ever with him yesterday whether he should go to Seattle or not. If<br />
he goes good, if he doesn't go the meeting will go on and I think be successful.<br />
It doesn't have to be entirely inclusive, people have choices here, so I think we<br />
would like to see Dr Mahathir there, I would, but if he is not there the meeting<br />
will succeed, I think, anyway.<br />
ends </p>
