<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Good morning and prepare for 48 hour of election foreplay - pre-election</p>
<p>   foreplay. The Prime Minister is expected to call the election on</p>
<p>   Sunday. The vote is expected October. He is with me now and we will</p>
<p>   take calls in a moment. Today Labor has put its tax bid in the market</p>
<p>   place and it is getting a pretty rough assessment. I'll speak</p>
<p>   to the Opposition Leader about that lately. But first in our Sydney</p>
<p>   studio for his regular appearance on the programme, the Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard I look at the world economic situation, Europe in turmoil,</p>
<p>   the Dow down 300 points, the Australian dollar in crisis, the Canadian</p>
<p>   dollar in crisis, commodity prices 21 year low, South Korea slumping</p>
<p>   badly, talk of a world recession. And I see both you and Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   offering tax relief and I wonder why. It is a bit like handing out</p>
<p>   free lollies on the aircraft when it's about to crash. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're not just offering tax relief, we are offering tax</p>
<p>   reform and that's the big difference. What we are doing is</p>
<p>   changing the tax system to strengthen the Australian economy precisely</p>
<p>   because we live in a difficult world economic environment.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you agree world recession is a possibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's a alarmist. But what I do say is that at this time</p>
<p>   it is not the time to be changing the economic management of Australia.</p>
<p>   At a time when the world is threatening you need a government that</p>
<p>   has got a proven track record of good economic management. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So you are saying: stay with us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Certainly and whenever the election is I'll certainly be saying</p>
<p>   that because we have a good record. We inherited a huge deficit</p>
<p>   of $10.5 billion and turned it into a surplus. We've got interest</p>
<p>   rates down, we've got inflation down, we've got business</p>
<p>   investment up and Australia is still growing quite strongly despite</p>
<p>   the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But, Mr Howard, nobody wants to be alarmist but when you pull all</p>
<p>   these things together.....I mean, the Reserve Bank buying the</p>
<p>   dollar. The dollar what 55.3 overnight. I think every Asian market</p>
<p>   except Hong Kong was in some sort of trouble. Our market has to</p>
<p>   face difficulties today. I mean we have got serious problems haven't</p>
<p>   we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The world is very unfriendly at the present time and that makes</p>
<p>   it all the more imperative when looking at something like taxation,</p>
<p>   we fix the system and don't just fiddle at the edges that we</p>
<p>   reduce our business costs which our proposal will do. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But what's the point in fixing taxation if I haven't</p>
<p>   got a job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If you fix taxation you are more likely to have a job because through</p>
<p>   our plan the costs of producing everything in Australia will come</p>
<p>   down because we are taking $10 billion annually off the costs of</p>
<p>   business. We are taking $4.5 billion off export costs. We are making</p>
<p>   the indirect tax base more efficient and therefore people who have</p>
<p>   obligations will have to meet them under our system. See, what you</p>
<p>   need at a time of economic difficulty is to make the system work</p>
<p>   better and that is what our plan does. Mr Beazley's promises</p>
<p>   don't address the weaknesses in the system. There is no reform,</p>
<p>   we have still got the same old creaky indirect tax system....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'd like to get to that, to his promise in a moment if you</p>
<p>   don't mind. Just stay on the world economic situation....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But the two things are related.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Of course, but the word recession I agree it's a word anybody's</p>
<p>   reluctant to use but at the very least we are heading to a major</p>
<p>   readjustment are we not and it's going to be tough?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Neil, it is precisely because the Government knew that these</p>
<p>   sorts of things were always possible that we got the budget in order</p>
<p>   two years ago. I mean people criticised us for that. Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   criticised us, he said: well you didn't need to fix the deficit</p>
<p>   it would fix itself. Now just ask yourself where would Australia</p>
<p>   now be if we still had a deficit of $10.5 billion and we still had</p>
<p>   the sort of interest rates that we had two years ago. We would be</p>
<p>   really vulnerable and weakened and at the mercy of a hostile world</p>
<p>   economic environment.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well can I ask you where Australia will be in 3 months? What is</p>
<p>   all this going to do to this country? You said we were fireproofed.</p>
<p>   Now, the reaction to the Australian dollar shows we are not fireproof</p>
<p>   does it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes but, Neil, I can't, for obvious reasons, talk about a</p>
<p>   particular level of the Australian dollar. But you have to look</p>
<p>   at the internal realities of the Australian economy. And the internal</p>
<p>   realities are that we have a low inflation rate, we have strong</p>
<p>   business investment, we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years</p>
<p>   and we have a budget in balance and we have significantly reduced</p>
<p>   our Federal Government debt over the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>   And you have a Government that has the courage to try and reform</p>
<p>   the tax system to make the Australian economy more competitive.</p>
<p>   So what I say summing all of those together is that that is the</p>
<p>   kind of answer, that is the only answer that we can give to the</p>
<p>   rest of the world. We can't control what happens on international</p>
<p>   financial markets, no government can. But what we can control is</p>
<p>   the internal strength of the Australian economy and our policies</p>
<p>   have made Australia stronger. Taxation reform will make Australia</p>
<p>   stronger and if Australia is stronger it will be better able to</p>
<p>   withstand an unwelcome world environment.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You must still be comparatively pessimistic or have a more pessimistic</p>
<p>   outlook now than there was. I mean are the outlooks being revised?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, the outlooks are always under review but the point I make</p>
<p>   again is that we can't control what happens on Wall St, we</p>
<p>   can't control what people do in dealing rooms of financial</p>
<p>   institutions, no government can. But what we can control is how</p>
<p>   we manage our own economy and how strong we make it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well where will we be in 3 months time, what is the impact of what</p>
<p>   we are talking about on the average person listening to us now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, it depends very much on things like, you know, duration.</p>
<p>   I mean ups and downs in the levels of the currency and, once again,</p>
<p>   I don't want to get specific are not of themselves things that</p>
<p>   have long-term consequences. What really matters is our international</p>
<p>   competitiveness. What matters is the cost of doing things in Australia.</p>
<p>   That's why getting those production costs down through tax</p>
<p>   reform is so important. That is why having low interest rates is</p>
<p>   so important. The bigger the debt the more vulnerable we are to</p>
<p>   adverse international adjustments. I remain very positive about</p>
<p>   the Australian economic outlook. I have never said that we will</p>
<p>   be completely unaffected by the Asian economic downturn but I have</p>
<p>   said that we have been protected against the worst effects of that,</p>
<p>   in no small measure due to the corrective measures the Government</p>
<p>   took two and a half years ago.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But it's not just Asia now is it? I mean the European situation,</p>
<p>   what's happening in Russia, the Canadian dollar down, Dow is</p>
<p>   dropping.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this is just a reminder, this is just a reminder, Neil, that</p>
<p>   whether we like it or not we live in a global economy. Some may</p>
<p>   not like it but there's nothing we can do about it except -</p>
<p>   and this is a very important exception Â make certain that</p>
<p>   we make our domestic economy as strong as possible. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well we are not fireproofed are we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are certainly avoiding the worst effects of the Asian economic</p>
<p>   downturn.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will we continue to avoid the worst effects of the world economic</p>
<p>   downturn?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe we will if we follow the right policies.....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Costello...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....if we keep our budget in balance, in surplus. If we reform</p>
<p>   our taxation system, if we keep our interest rates low and our inflation</p>
<p>   low. If we do those things our prospects are much stronger and that's</p>
<p>   why we have got to reform our taxation system. We don't have</p>
<p>   the luxury of fiddling with it and playing at the edges.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Costello was quoted today saying that the outlooks were more</p>
<p>   pessimistic view of the economy now, the revised outlooks. Do you</p>
<p>   agree with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I haven't seen that particular quote....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Financial Review paper.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well okay, I am not saying he didn't say it. But the clear</p>
<p>   situation is that there is some impact on - by the rest of the world</p>
<p>   - on the Australian economy but you have to ask yourself: are we</p>
<p>   doing all that can be done in relation to those things over which</p>
<p>   we have control. We can't control what Wall St does but we</p>
<p>   can control what Australia does. And by reforming the tax system</p>
<p>   we are going to give Australia a stronger, competitive edge, we</p>
<p>   are going to reduce the cost of our exports, we are going to reduce</p>
<p>   the costs of producing everything in Australia. We, therefore, are</p>
<p>   going to make Australian businesses more competitive therefore more</p>
<p>   able to employ more people and to export more goods and services</p>
<p>   overseas. That is why tax reform is good for Australia so....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If I am the average....the average Australian listening now</p>
<p>   though...I mean there has been nervousness around for some time</p>
<p>   about employment, that goes through the period of probably the past</p>
<p>   15 years. Is my job safe, are my kids going to get a job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well your children are more likely to get a job in a low inflation,</p>
<p>   low interest rate, competitive Australian economy than in a high</p>
<p>   inflation, high interest rate, uncompetitive Australian economy.</p>
<p>   A reformed taxation system that reduced the costs of every small</p>
<p>   business operation is more likely to deliver your child a job than</p>
<p>   one that leaves the existing out-of-date 1930s wholesale tax system.</p>
<p>   We have a very clear choice at the moment and that is to decide</p>
<p>   in favour of a tax approach which is good for Australia or have</p>
<p>   a micro-debate about how it affects different interest groups within</p>
<p>   the Australian economy. Important though that is, in the long run</p>
<p>   what is more important is which approach the taxation will make</p>
<p>   Australia a stronger country because if there is one thing Australia</p>
<p>   needs at a moment of international economic challenge, and that</p>
<p>   is domestic economic strength and the policies that are more likely</p>
<p>   to deliver Australia domestic economic strength, a stronger Australia,</p>
<p>   are those policies that ought to be supported.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay the average person will worry about their job and will worry</p>
<p>   about interest rates, and how they can affect them. Will interest</p>
<p>   rates need to go up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Neil, I don't comment about the future level of interest</p>
<p>   rates, but I do remind you that in two-and-a-half years we have</p>
<p>   brought interest rates down dramatically to their lowest level in</p>
<p>   thirty years and that has meant a saving to the average Australian</p>
<p>   battler of $300 a month off his or her mortgage payments. Now that</p>
<p>   is the best news on housing interest rates that Australians have</p>
<p>   had in more than 30 years and it is flowing through now into the</p>
<p>   small business sector. Actions and deeds speak louder than words</p>
<p>   and promises when it comes to something like interest rates and</p>
<p>   we have the runs on the board. We've got those interest rates</p>
<p>   down from their very high levels under Labor. They are now at historically</p>
<p>   low levels and they've delivered cuts worth $300 a month to</p>
<p>   Australians.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the election, have you decided yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will you give it consideration over the weekend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, Neil it is obviously something that is on my mind but I haven't</p>
<p>   decided. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When will you decide. Not when will the date be, but when do you</p>
<p>   think you'll make a decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil come on.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you've seen the speculation that you are going to call</p>
<p>   it on Sunday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil there is all sorts of speculation but I am not going to go</p>
<p>   any further than to say that the matter remains under very close</p>
<p>   notice and attention.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Business Council, Stan Wallis said to me yesterday, the sooner</p>
<p>   the better to get some stability one way or another. Do you think</p>
<p>   there is an argument there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I haven't decided yet. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No no, I'm not asking whether you've decided. The stability</p>
<p>   argument is important isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's a lot of arguments that have to be taken into account</p>
<p>   and I'll take them all into account and when I've reached</p>
<p>   a decision I'll make an announcement.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When you reach a decision, it is just immediate though isn't</p>
<p>   it? I mean, you could decide now, and head off on a plane to Canberra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I've never done this before. Well, I haven't.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No of course.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a novel experience.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a quick break, come back with Mr Howard on Labor's</p>
<p>   tax package and some calls.</p>
<p>[Ad break]</p>
<p>I feel I should apologise to the Prime Minister having John Laws</p>
<p>   reading ads on the programme, however we'll take calls from</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister in a moment.</p>
<p>Mr Howard just quickly, the micro-view if you like, as you said</p>
<p>   of the Labor tax policy and yours. What about your case. High income</p>
<p>   earner. How do you benefit under the Coalition package compared</p>
<p>   to Labor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't done the exact calculation to be perfectly</p>
<p>   truthful, but somebody on a high income is paying a lot more tax</p>
<p>   to start with so if you have a cut in tax the dollar amount that</p>
<p>   that person gets is obviously larger than the dollar amount that</p>
<p>   a person on the lower income gets because they are paying a lot</p>
<p>   more tax to start off with. You've always got to have a trade-off</p>
<p>   between incentive and equity. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you accept that lower income earners will do better under this</p>
<p>   package, under the Labor package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't, in an ultimate sense because I don't think</p>
<p>   it is deliverable without the fundamental reform of a GST.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But they'll do better in a dollar sense won't they?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, providing it is delivered, but in 1993 they were offered</p>
<p>   the same deal without a GST and when Labor won they took away the</p>
<p>   tax cuts and they increased the indirect taxes. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>All right, but if they trust Kim Beazley, there's a better</p>
<p>   bid there if you like, a better dollar ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what matters, as I said a moment ago, is what you deliver,</p>
<p>   not what you promise. And those people were promised this in 1993.</p>
<p>   Labor got back on the strength of that promise, they took away the</p>
<p>   tax cut. They put up the indirect taxes. There was no compensation</p>
<p>   for the battlers and they were all worse off.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What do you think is high income these days?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Labor Party thinks it is $50,000 a year. Now, there are</p>
<p>   literally hundreds of thousands of couples, perhaps several million</p>
<p>   couples whose combined incomes are between $40,000 a year and $60,000</p>
<p>   a year. I mean, this idea, this new envy threshold, that a combined</p>
<p>   income of $45,000 - $50,000 a year is rich, is unbelievable. I mean,</p>
<p>   we don't want a society built on envy. We want a society that</p>
<p>   balances equity and incentive. You want both. We won't survive</p>
<p>   if we don't have both. We need equity for social stability</p>
<p>   and decency but we need incentive to get the country to go ahead.</p>
<p>   And the biggest social criticism that I have of the Labor Party's</p>
<p>   tax approach is that it is anti-incentive. There is no incentive</p>
<p>   for people to save. Retired people get nothing out of it and you</p>
<p>   have very savage withdrawal rates and high marginal tax rates for</p>
<p>   family incomes between $40,000 - $60,000 a year. And there are loads</p>
<p>   and loads of families with two incomes who are at that kind of level.</p>
<p>   Now that is the social criticism I have. The economic criticism</p>
<p>   I have is that he has not reformed the system. He has left the existing</p>
<p>   wholesale tax system in place, he's just played at the edges,</p>
<p>   there is no boost for exporters, there is no help in reducing business</p>
<p>   costs. And we are just stuck with this same old wholesale tax system.</p>
<p>   Now Neil we have been talking about this for 25 years, not you and</p>
<p>   me, but the community. And everybody agrees that you have got to</p>
<p>   reform the tax system, and what's their reform? They are going</p>
<p>   to take wholesale tax off orange juice which they themselves imposed</p>
<p>   in 1985. I mean, big deal.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay we'll take some calls, there are a couple of other questions</p>
<p>   I would like to ask if you have time. Harry go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister. Federal and State government pensions</p>
<p>   are tied to a so-called basket of goods. Generally most pensioners</p>
<p>   think that that basket of goods does not reflect inflation rates</p>
<p>   of the things that they are normally interested in. Is that basket</p>
<p>   of goods going to be reviewed and also where is it possible to get</p>
<p>   a copy of this secret basket of goods?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it is secret Harry. If you'd like</p>
<p>   to leave your name and address with Neil's programme, I'll</p>
<p>   arrange for some information to be sent to you by the statistician.</p>
<p>   But it is compiled by the statistician, it does include things that</p>
<p>   people normally buy at the supermarket, of course it does. It does</p>
<p>   include food, and it does include clothing and it does include rent,</p>
<p>   and all the other things that people are concerned about. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Just on rent Mr Howard, the GST will put up rents on public housing</p>
<p>   won't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that will depend ultimately on decisions of State Governments</p>
<p>   because they control public housing, we don't.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's certainly happening here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it can't be happening there at the moment, because it</p>
<p>   hasn't come in.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Government has said it will happen because public rents and</p>
<p>   public housing are linked to the income of the pensioners. Say you</p>
<p>   give them 4% on the compensation package, they'll lose a quarter</p>
<p>   of that when their rent goes up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, ultimately it all depends on the decision that is finally</p>
<p>   taken by the State Government and it depends on a whole lot of trade-offs</p>
<p>   and it depends upon the calculations about the impact of the package</p>
<p>   on State Governments but the rent, the tenant won't have to</p>
<p>   pay the GST on the rent, it is what called input taxed, in other</p>
<p>   words it is free of, there is no GST on the rent itself to be paid</p>
<p>   by the renter and the question of whether there is any adjustment</p>
<p>   is something that has got to be determined by the Government, the</p>
<p>   State housing provider.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Michelle go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hi Mr Howard. I'm a Liberal voter, but at the moment I desperately</p>
<p>   need you to convince me not to vote Labor. My husband earns $33,000</p>
<p>   a year, I'm on $5000.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do you have any children?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>We have a 10 year old daughter, and from what I can tell we are</p>
<p>   going to be worse off. I was ready to vote for the GST a few weeks</p>
<p>   ago, and now I'm really frightened, but I don't want to</p>
