TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS AT COBURG, MELBOURNESATURDAY<br />
14 FEBRUARY 1987-..<br />
0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNAL-IST:.. Do--you-fee-1--comforted-that---ian-S-i-nc-l-a-i-r--and--S-i-r-Joh--<br />
haven't been able-to resolve-their _ differences._ at a__ mee. ting<br />
yesterday? PM: You may have noticed I haven't been spending much time or<br />
talking about them. I am just getting on with the job of running<br />
the country which is what people want me to do. And I am leaving<br />
them to their own devices. It is quite clear that the nature of<br />
the hatreds and differences between them within the Liberal Party,<br />
within the National Party, between the National Party, between<br />
the Liberal Party, are so profound that they are not going to go<br />
away and I leave it to-<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it good news for your Government though?<br />
PM: The good news for our Government is that we are a good government<br />
and we are going on with doing the job that the people of Australia<br />
want. We had very difficult circumstances last year. We were<br />
prepared to make the tough decisions. It got a little bit of<br />
unpopularity at the time but people are realising that that is<br />
what is required. They want stability in government and they want<br />
a government that has policies and can make decisions and that<br />
is what we are giving them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it give you the chance to make more tough decisions<br />
this year?<br />
PM: I don't make tough decisions for the sake of making them and<br />
saying ' look at my hairy chest, what a tough decision maker I am'.<br />
I take the decisions which I believe are necessary. In 1987 the<br />
economy is going to be in better shape than it was in ' 86. To<br />
the extent that tough decisions are necessary, I will take them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Joh attacked the Liberal tax policy aga'i today.-<br />
What does that mean for their tax policy?<br />
PM: What is very interesting is that. oward and Joh say that their<br />
policies are very similar. Mr Howard there is virtually no difference<br />
between my policies and Sir Joh's. And so when you realise just<br />
how inept and irrelevant Sir Joh's policies-you realise-thatyou<br />
are also making the same criticism of Mr Howard. I don't really<br />
want to spend very much time on them. They are manifestly incompetent<br />
They are incapable of formulating policies. As I said when I got<br />
back from overseas, we have waited four years for the production<br />
of a policy and what have we got. incentivation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir Joh is making clearer sounds today that he will<br />
form his own political party. Does that pose a greater threat<br />
than him as part of the coalition forces? </p>
<p>2.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you been able to persuade Mr Scholes<br />
to resign from the Ministry?<br />
PM: I have got no comment about that there are some discussions<br />
going on but that is an internal matter. I have got nothing to<br />
say publicly about that.<br />
