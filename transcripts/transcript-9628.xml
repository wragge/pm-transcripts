PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM,<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RESUMPTION OF NUCLEAR TESTING BY FRANCE<br />
On behalf of South Pacific Forum heads of government as current Chair of the Forum,<br />
I condemn France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific.<br />
Individual Forum governments have already issued statements and protests that reflect<br />
the depth of their disappointment. The immediate widespread public antagonism to<br />
France's decision right across the South Pacific reflects the resentment felt by our<br />
peoples.<br />
Forum heads of government understand and share these feelings. On their behalf, I<br />
express our unequivocal opposition to France's decision.<br />
The statements that have been issued by other nuclear powers, and by other countries<br />
in Asia and in other parts of the world are welcome. Forum leaders hope that France<br />
will hear and take note of what the world is saying.<br />
France has exercised a choice about the nature of its engagement in the South Pacific.<br />
Forum members had welcomed the improved relations between France and countries<br />
in the region. France's decision is a major setback to this trend which was partly<br />
founded on its 1992 moratorium on nuclear testing in the South Pacific.<br />
The wider implications of France's decision are also of deep concern to Forum heads of<br />
government. France's decision undermines the outcome of the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation<br />
Treaty Review and Extension Conference ( NPTREC). The decision is particularly<br />
regrettable in the light of agreement reached at that conference, including by France,<br />
that negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT) should be completed<br />
by no later than 1996 and that, pending such a treaty, nuclear weapon states would<br />
exercise the utmost restraint. t'Vi </p>
<p>The South Pacific Forum remains strongly committed to a CTBT as a key step in<br />
global efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and eventually eliminate nuclear<br />
weapons. It offers the prospect of ending testing completely in the South Pacific as<br />
elsewhere. The heads of government have noted President Chirac's commitment that<br />
France would sign such a treaty. They will hold France to that commitment.<br />
Heads of government also called on France to abide by the Protocols of the South<br />
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.<br />
I am in contact with my fellow heads of government about arrangements for a Forum<br />
delegation to convey to the French Government the depth of the Forum's concern. I<br />
envisage that the delegation would be led by the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator<br />
Evans. CANBERRA JUNE 1995 </p>
