    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Federal Government will provide</p>
<p> $5 million from the Federation Fund towards the restoration of St</p>
<p> Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney.</p>
<p>This contribution towards the St Andrew's Appeal Fund will help</p>
<p> restore this important heritage listed building by the year 2000.</p>
<p> It is fitting that St Andrew's, as the mother church of the Sydney</p>
<p> Anglican Diocese, be assisted from the Federation Fund.</p>
<p>The Cathedral is the first constructed in Australia, designed by Francis</p>
<p> Greenway with its foundation stone laid in 1819 by Governor Lachlan</p>
<p> Macquarie. Finally consecrated in 1868, the physical and spiritual</p>
<p> history of St Andrew's is entwined with the growth of Sydney,</p>
<p> and of our nation.</p>
<p>Now, after years of wear and tear, the fine yellow Sydney sandstone</p>
<p> which is the physical shell of this fine Gothic cathedral is in desperate</p>
<p> need of restoration.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's contribution towards the restoration will</p>
<p> importantly provide jobs and training in stonemasonry, not solely</p>
<p> for the substantial reconstruction, but also for on-going maintenance.</p>
<p>St Andrew's Cathedral has been a source for spiritual comfort</p>
<p> and guidance for Sydney-siders since before Federation. I am proud</p>
<p> that the Federal Government is contributing to the restoration of</p>
<p> this significant and historic Cathedral, and I urge others to similarly</p>
<p> lend their support to this worthy restoration project.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's contribution matches that made by the previous</p>
<p> Government to the restoration of Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral.</p>
<p>This will bring to $369 million commitments made to date from the</p>
<p> $1 billion Federation Fund announced in the last Budget.</p>
