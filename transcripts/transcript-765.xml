PRIME MINISTER: Welcome " ho1me, Sir Robert, and we congratulate<br />
you on yi instcllat icn in the Order of the<br />
Thistle. NowV tolme little mor-e rmundane<br />
things Eir. You spoke in fairly general<br />
t ermns yeisterday,, Could you give us something<br />
more specific on your talks with Mr, MacMillan<br />
and Pr-esideat Konnedy?<br />
I was wiordering what procedutre would suit<br />
you. ha T had in mind was that I might<br />
perchaps maku some observations of my ov. fl on<br />
some of' these iia tes, a nd then the-ire will ' be<br />
questions th. at some or you would li; ke to put<br />
and it iJs a_, vvayn concoivabDie, of course,<br />
that I mig-ht be able to anerwer some of them.<br />
Bat, I think it might be helpful, if I sai~ d<br />
somaething in a gene-1-1 wo-y, It has u. 1.2 been<br />
pretty hurried, because I had a totlal of<br />
twelve days in London, somewhatineutd<br />
by certain domestic events not on. m. Iy part,<br />
but on the part of other people three<br />
da~ ys in Scctland., 1 had a day in Ottawa Ond.<br />
wodays in Wa-shington, with 1beforeth,<br />
the better part the day i', n Virginia at<br />
Charlottes. 111c. 1 thin" K, howiever, that the<br />
main mn-tters tha-t I had discussions about can<br />
be put faIrly briefly0 My rpa-in talks in the<br />
United Kingdorm wore with the Prime Ministev.<br />
Mr0Ivi( amilln,-n, viith the Lcrd Hovne, with<br />
Mr,~ Sandys a-, nd wihMr. Butler. The<br />
prcincip~ ral things tha,, 7t I discusoed with theohadf<br />
rela,-tio-. n ill ' South-East Isiza, in<br />

that new Federation. I also had somne ta-lks<br />

are some very Jl3. pu. tant discussicns taking<br />

<p>P. M.<br />
( Continued). undoubtedly a very deep gulf between Chinese Communists<br />
and the Ccraimnist of the Soviet Union. This is not<br />
a mere matter of words; as we all know from reading<br />
the news from day to day there are very big differences.<br />
I think myself that the Soviet Union-it seems odd when<br />
one looks back a few years the Soviet Union feels that<br />
the aggressive quality of Chinese Communism is something<br />
that is to be resisted. The Soviet Union itself has<br />
been, I think, rather more willing to negotiate than<br />
it was in the past and I attach great importance in<br />
this connection to the remarkable perfrmnance of<br />
President Kennedy over the Cuba matter a performance<br />
which I think has undoubtedly given a check to<br />
agressiveness on the part of the Soviet Union and<br />
produced a state of mind in which we may well hope to<br />
have agreement on such matters as the test ban. And<br />
that attitude on the part of the Soviet Union, of course,<br />
can very well be affected by this increasing friction<br />
between the Soviet Union and Communist China a certain<br />
feeling of apprehension about the large Communist<br />
neighbour. And that is why this seems to be tne right<br />
time for the Western powers to pursue their negotiations<br />
with Mr. Khrushchev and to pursue them in the atmosphere<br />
that an agreement is possible on this and perhaps other<br />
matters, yrovided there is a realistic state of mind and<br />
provided, of course, that there is some goodwill and a<br />
desire for peace. The President of the United States<br />
and the Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, both, if I may say<br />
so, seem to me tc have grown in authority in the handling<br />
of the international affairs.<br />
I know one reads occasionally about internal politics<br />
in the United States. I don't profess to understand<br />
them very clearly.. There is always some friction,<br />
Well, we are not unfamiliar with that in our own<br />
country. But these two-very important for us and for<br />
the world seem to me, in the handling of the<br />
international matters, to have acquired increasing<br />
authority. It has been said in various quarters that<br />
there are reasons for dispute or matters for dispute<br />
between Mr. Macmillan and President Kennedy over some<br />
of the NATO problems. I think it proper to say that I<br />
found on both sides a very healthy personal friendly<br />
relationship between them. I think that it is quite<br />
clear that Mr. Macmillan and President Kennedy are in<br />
constant communication, always meet as friends,<br />
always discuss things with frankness and that any / 6 </p>

to sit in judgmient on them. You have to remember , bouat the<br />

It worko very satisfCactorily we think, and Ihas for a long<br />

P i11. Well, 9 I can't speak for the Chinese. I don -t know, Nor<br />
indeed cEan 1 speak', for Mr,, Khnrishcheov, My own view is that<br />
thi. differences between wqhqt cal) Il for th1-is purpose the<br />
iRussi'ans and tlie Chi-nese in the Cormunist world is a dfeec<br />
which does no hLarm wvith rolations with the Wstern world,<br />

P. M~ Tiel, as soon s I kniow the &amp;:. nz-, rer to tha t quest4on~ Iwl<br />
announce it.<br />
Q. ~ Sir Robert. can you answer it to this extent have you<br />
any timetable of when you willl discuss redistribution with<br />
Mr. McEwon?<br />
P. M. No, but it will have to be soon,<br />
Sir Robert did you ask President Kennedy about a visit<br />
by{ hima to Au1straiia daring taie talks withi him this time?<br />
P4M% 1 Ve had a general discussion about that matter, but 1 am not<br />
in a position at pr~ esent to say anything,<br />
Sir Robert.. i~ n vr: oew, of your imfpr s ; ion t~ lnt the tronsion is<br />
easing, does that rake any d: Lffoei. roco to youri Governirint's<br />
atLitude to d., efence in vie-! of the statemen-t you made?<br />
No. Look, a defence prograrmm e is not soilething that can<br />
fluctuate froma day to day according to wlaetfter the weather<br />
signals are bOetter or worse, You Lave take a muc,!, l longer<br />
view than that.<br />
But -the sense of urgency is growing?<br />
P. M4. I still bave a considerable sense of urgency about the whole<br />
problem, yes,<br />
Q. ~ There has been -a lot of speculation, Sir Robe-rt while you<br />
were overseas about the prospect of an early Federal<br />

P. M. o<br />
P. HM. called it a new franc. The technical answers to that were<br />
tremendously powerful. All right in the case of France;<br />
you move a decimal point two to the left because you<br />
already had a decimal system, so the new franc was got not<br />
by altering the system but by an alteration of the decimal<br />
point, But a new pound based on the decimal currency,<br />
operating what for two years, ide by side with an old<br />
pound ( non-decimal), and in fact at twice the value would<br />
produce so our experts advised us, and I accept it, the<br />
most in olerable confusion, because it will take a long time<br />
to change over the accounting machines, tne cash registers,<br />
all this kind of thing, and the confusion between a pound of<br />
one breed and a pound of another, one being decimal and the<br />
other being non-decimal, was too much to contemplate. So<br />
I myself, if you are interested, withdrew my advocacy for the<br />
use of the word " pound" which would have otherwise suited<br />
me, my personal view, very woll,<br />
Sir, are you worried about trends in overseas investment in<br />
Australia? I am not. No, I road the other day a statement made by Mr<br />
Holt, the Treasurer, on this mratter, answering something that<br />
had beon said by some Opposition spokesman, and if I may say<br />
so, I thought it completely accurate, This doesntt mean that<br />
we deny the possibility of problems in the future, but it<br />
does mean that looking at the matter now, , w see advantages<br />
which outweigh the disadvantages in the flow of capital into<br />
this country, And we would be pretty sorry for ourselves if<br />
it stopped tomorrow. There are two ways of stopping it<br />
deado One is to prohibit it by scme means or other, and the<br />
other is to attach such rigid conditions to it a: 3 to<br />
discourage it, and capital being a shy bird it very easily<br />
fls awayo We as a nation have no reason o complain if we<br />
receive a tremendous inflow of capital, Our development in<br />
Australia would have been less if we hadn't received this<br />
confidence and practicable working investment You have<br />
always to keep two things in mind. One is that capital<br />
which merely comes in to buy something out that is one<br />
kind of thing, That is the kind of thing we scrutinise<br />
very carofully, But capital. private capital . rhich comes<br />
in to create an industry to develop some product in<br />
Australia, to increase employment in Australia, this is<br />
of tremendous value to us, In past elections I have had a<br />
certain amount of fun addressing meetings at say, Ford in<br />
Geelong, and inviting the Labour voters standing in front<br />
of me to consider whether they are opposed to capital<br />
coming into Australia from overseas. In other words, whether<br />
they are opposed to the jobs they nave,<br />
Did you encounter Hioffr-on in his porogrinations in<br />
search of capital?<br />
I didn't see him with the eye, but hear rumours of him with<br />
the earo I didn't actually see him. Wait a moment, I am<br />
wrong. I think I said good-day to him in London at the<br />
Reception. I apologise<br />
Has he achieved anything of any great moment at all?<br />
I couldn't tell you that, All I know is that the Commonwealth<br />
representatives around the world have been doing<br />
their best and devoting a considerable amount of time to<br />
helping these State roprosentatives, I heard very good<br />
reports in America of what Mr,, 3rcnd had been doing. Â® o / i'O </p>
<p>10<br />
Q. Sir Robert is it embarrassing for the Corr onwealth<br />
representatives to have these State Premiers and officers<br />
moving around the world in apparent conflict?<br />
P. M. Well, you see, that is a loaded question " in apparent<br />
conflicto" I think their experience is that when State<br />
representatives are going around the world their relations<br />
with the Commonwealth representatives are the most<br />
harmonious in the world. It is only up here that we get<br />
differences,<br />
QO Sir Robert we are associated with the UK,/ Malayan defence<br />
agreement through an unpublished exchange of letters. Can<br />
you give us some indication of what type of conmitment in<br />
Malaysia is contemplated?<br />
PoM, No I can't because we have none at present. This is all a<br />
matter that has to be discussed. You say that we are<br />
associated, We are not. Great Britain has a defence<br />
agreement with Malaya and has indicated her willingness to<br />
extend it to Malaysia, that is to say when Malaysia comes<br />
into existence. It will not be very shortly,, Our relations<br />
with Malaya on the defence side have been indirect7 through<br />
the Commonwealth Brigade the reserve, We have not,<br />
ourselves, had direct obligations to Malaya in that field,<br />
but we have come in on the side so to speak of Great<br />
Britain, Whether we should now make a defence agreement<br />
with Malaysia a direct defence agreement in which<br />
obligations are accepted is a matter which has yet to<br />
be discussed I had some discussion about it in London,<br />
That is true, But as a Cabinet matter, this has yet to<br />
be discussed because up to now, Malaysia has been a concept<br />
and not a facto Now that Malaysia becomes a fact, the<br />
time arises when we have to determine what we are prepared<br />
to do in that field and there are many aspects that have<br />
to be considered<br />
Qo Will it be in the near future, Sir, that discussion?<br />
P. M. I don't know. I daresay we will be concentrating our minds<br />
on the Budget in the next week. Without undue delay.<br />
Q. I am thinking, Sir, in relation to defence ' discussions<br />
that have been going on for some time at home here.<br />
P. Mo What defence?<br />
Qo Our own. defence policy. Would it be related to that?<br />
PM. Well, look, you are asking me to anticipate a problem,<br />
Suppose the Commonwealth Governmont said, " Well, we are<br />
prepared to make some agreement with Malaysia," Then-. the<br />
next question would be " To what extent, in what form,<br />
through what arms." The next question would be Are<br />
they to be additional to what we already have or are they<br />
to represent a different disposition of the forces that<br />
we now have or will have under our programme?" These<br />
problems are not to be disposed of by a sweeping sentence,<br />
I assure you,<br />
Qo Did you have any discussions with President Kennedy on<br />
defence and trade that you can tell us about? 0 a 0 a 0 0/ 1 1 </p>
<p>11<br />
P. M. No I did not have any discussions on trade, My colleagu.<br />
had been there only a week or two before. He had had very<br />
full discussions and had had some very useful ones in all<br />
places and I didn't see any reason to duplicate them.<br />
Q, Did you discuss the question of the position of Australian<br />
New Guinea either with Kennedy or the U. oN administration?<br />
P. Mo Well, I think that apart from reiterating the proposition<br />
two propositions we didn't have any, The two propositions<br />
were first, to repeat what I had said in the House<br />
that the defence of Australian New Guinea and Papua was<br />
regarded by us in exactly the sam way as the defence of<br />
our mainland and that any overt attack on it would be<br />
resisted in the same way; I repeated that, That is well<br />
understood, In the second place oi course, it is well<br />
understcod and agreed that should such an event occur,<br />
ANZUS would operate and we would have the assistance cf<br />
the United States of America, These , re two things....<br />
there is nothing new about them, I have said them time<br />
after time. They are worth repeating so that there will<br />
be no room for error in any other country,<br />
Q Si. r Robert, proposals have been reported for the Western<br />
air defence of India Will Australia be associated with<br />
mnerica and Britain in this regard?<br />
PM. I woul. dn't say anything about that at the present timeo<br />
Certainly we have no obligation to do so. As to what<br />
discussions may have occurred as the result of some of<br />
these investigation teams I am not up to datoo You may<br />
take it that we have entered into no new obligation in<br />
that fieldo<br />
Qo While you wero in London did you discuss the possibility<br />
of any future Royal Visits perhaps Princess Margaret?<br />
P. M. No, I didn't have a discussion about that, No, I think<br />
I will say that this has got nothi: ng to do with Princess<br />
Mar garet<br />
q, I was going to ask about the Queen Mothero.. o.<br />
P. M. Yes, I know you wore. Well, there is nothing I can say<br />
about that at present.<br />
Qo Sir Robert, in your discussions with the loaders of the<br />
world as Prime Minister of Australia, how did they feel there<br />
about Australia? What do they look on Australia as being?<br />
Why I said that question, I will explain it Sir. We have<br />
so many business leaders that como back and they seem to be<br />
preoccupied by the thought that Australia has to have more<br />
money to go in advance Now, we know full and well that<br />
we are pretty well set up in Australia. Is this a question<br />
largely thought of overseas?<br />
FoMO I don't know what you mean by " pretty well set up".<br />
Q. We have a country here which is going ahead by leaps and<br />
bounds. We have so much to offer in Australia. Does it<br />
look to these world leaders the men with whom you have<br />
discussed and talked to, that we will have to have all<br />
overseas capital to go ahead with our plans in the future<br />
or do they look on Australia as a land of opportunity or<br />
look on it as a land where things are just a * ooo/ 12 </p>
<p>12.<br />
PMo I see, It would be a mistake to think that the relationship<br />
between us is that we are begging for help, so to speak,<br />
because we are noto They look on us as a strong country,<br />
as a friendly country. They look on us as a growing<br />
country. They think, particularly in their business fields<br />
that this is a land of opportunity and they are much more<br />
affected by the attraction that they feel towards the<br />
Australian opportunity than they are to any argumentative<br />
view that may be put, urging them or begging them or<br />
something of that kind. That is not our position, We<br />
are not regarded, in other words, as a sort of poor relation.<br />
On the contrary, we are looked upon both in the United States<br />
and in the United Kingdom as a pretty good relation, a<br />
relation that will someday be a rich relation, or as I<br />
think as Compton McKenzie said, a rich relative,<br />
Q. Did President Kennedy ask us to assume any extra defence<br />
obligations in this part of the world?<br />
P. M. No. I told President Kennedy about our recent expansion<br />
of the defence programme and the contingent addition to<br />
that which would arise on a Canberra replacement on which<br />
there is an evaluation team at this moment. I think they<br />
have reached America. I told him all about that. He was<br />
extremely interested in it but not any more than that,<br />
Q, Sir Robert, is there any possibility of Australia being<br />
asked to conduct a fact-finding mission to Southern<br />
Rhodesia?<br />
P. M. I think perhaps I would prefer to answer that by saying<br />
that there is no possibility that we will conduct one,<br />
I think I am right in saying that almost every Commonwealth<br />
country has been asked by the Government of Southern<br />
Rhodesia to send somebody, but that is not a proposal that<br />
attracts me at all. We are not settling the problem of<br />
Southern Rhodesia We have got enough of our own, We are<br />
not going to be the people who have to advise as to who<br />
ought to have a vote in Southern Rhodesia. I have been<br />
concerned in this matter chiefly from a constitutional<br />
point of view as it affects the Commonwealth and quite<br />
frankly, I donTt want to see Southern Rhodesia out of<br />
the Commonwealth. They are one of our old friends, o But<br />
whether they are in the Cononwealth or not will depend,<br />
not upon us, our view, so much as what happens over the<br />
next few weeks in relation to their discussions with<br />
Mr. Butler and to their own decisions as to what, if<br />
anything, they are going to do about the franchise,<br />
But we have no abmitions to be busybodies, you know,<br />
Quite enough busybodies in the world without us joining<br />
their ranks, </p>
