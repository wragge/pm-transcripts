SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
ARRIVAL OF HIS HOLINESS, POPE JOHN PAUL 11<br />
WEDNESDAY 18 JANUARY 1995, SYDNEY<br />
Your Holiness, Your Eminences, Your Excellency, Premier, distinguished guests,<br />
ladies and gentlemen<br />
Your Holiness, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to Australia.<br />
I welcome you as the spiritual leader of one billion people worldwide, and of five<br />
million Australians.<br />
Your Holiness, I welcome you on behalf of all Australians.<br />
I welcome you as a man of faith and as a respected and admired international<br />
figure one, surely, known to more people, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, than<br />
any other Pope in history; one who has given moral leadership in the pursuit of<br />
peace and justice; in the interests of the young; in defence of the family; and in<br />
the cause of ecumenism.<br />
We are honoured by your presence. We thank you for making the long journey<br />
to Australia to bestow a great honour on an Australian woman whom we hold in<br />
the deepest affection and regard.<br />
You have come to honour Mary MacKillop for her goodness, her heroic virtue,<br />
her dedication to the poorest of the poor. In doing so, you renew in all of us the<br />
message she brought to those she encountered in her own lifetime.<br />
In a great many ways she is a woman of our time.<br />
In the last century as in this one, people came to Australia from all over the world<br />
in search of better lives. In the remote areas of Australia, Mary MacKillop<br />
helped the children of the poor to find them.<br />
She established communities of hope. </p>
<p>2<br />
It is partly because she worked in the bush, in many ways the cradle of our<br />
tradition, that she became a legendary figure for Australians.<br />
Mary MacKillop's sympathies were with those we call the underdogs of society<br />
which is where, by tradition, Australian sympathies lie.<br />
If we have not succeeded in converting those sympathies to an entirely fair and<br />
just society, they continue to constitute an ideal and an inspiration and Mary<br />
MacKillop continues to embody them for us.<br />
Through her work she spoke to all Australians and she spoke for the kind of<br />
tolerant and diverse society we aspire to today.<br />
She readily crossed denominational boundaries. Protestant and Jewish<br />
Australians supported her and were her friends.<br />
She was the daughter of Gaelic-speaking Scottish migrants, but her voice<br />
became a distinctly Australian one. When she wrote to the Vatican she began<br />
with the words: " It is an Australian who speaks".<br />
Today, the Order she founded, the Josephites, continue to serve the children of<br />
the poor. Today, they bring hope to those on the margins of society in the<br />
suburbs of modern multicultural Australia, and, increasingly, to those in need in<br />
the countries of the Third World.<br />
Your Holiness, in the next two days, many thousands of people who have<br />
journeyed from all over Australia and New Zealand, will gather in Sydney to<br />
greet you and be present at Mass and the beatification of Mary MacKillop.<br />
These will be great days in the lives of all who attend. They will be very<br />
significant days in the life of our nation.<br />
The presence of so many reflects both their continuing affection for Mary<br />
MacKillop and the Josephites, and, Your Holiness, their great regard for you.<br />
I said we feel honoured to have you here among us: I dare say many of us also<br />
feel stronger.<br />
Stronger for having among us a man whose steadfast defence and unremitting<br />
advocacy of Catholic faith and Christian ideals is a source of comfort and a<br />
guiding light.<br />
Again, on behalf of all Australians, I welcome you.<br />
ENDS </p>
