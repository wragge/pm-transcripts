    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I will travel to Turkey for the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>I will be joined in Turkey by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key â a testament to the enduring bond between our two countries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Key and I will join the Turkish commemorations of the Gallipoli campaign.</p>
<p>On Anzac Day in Gallipoli, we will remember the sacrifice of the men who fought and died there.</p>
<p>While in Turkey I will meet with Prime Minister Davutoglu and President Erdogan to discuss the conflict in Syria and Iraq, and ways to stop radicalised Australians crossing the Turkish border to join ISIL.</p>
<p>We will also discuss how we can continue working together closely as past and current presidents of the G20.</p>
<p>After Turkey, I will travel to France. In Villers-Bretonneux, we will remember the sacrifice and achievements of Australians on the Western Front.</p>
<p>In meetings with President Hollande and Prime Minister Valls I will discuss opportunities to deepen our already strong cooperation, particularly on national security challenges such as counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>We will also discuss new measures being implemented to keep our citizens safe against the violent extremism that has pervaded both our nations.</p>
<p>21 April 2015Â </p>
