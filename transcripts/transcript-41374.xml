    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>FITZY: </strong></p>
<p>We’ve had a phone call from the Prime Minister, he joins us now – Malcolm Turnbull, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Welcome, Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Great to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>How does it feel to be the last interview on the Fitzy and Wippa Show for 2017?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>It is awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>And a very Merry Christmas to you and all of your listeners. I’ll tell you where I am – I am just about, in my car, just about to go into the gates at Government House…</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><strong>FITZY: </strong></p>
<p>Coming home from Oxford Street?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>To meet the Governor-General who will sign the Marriage Bill and it will then become law.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>And it will be the law of the land from, it will be operative from midnight tonight.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>And people will be able to, same-sex couples will - like everyone else - will give 30 days’ notice to their wedding and so the first same-sex couples to be married can be married on the 9th of January.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Isn’t that amazing? That is sensational.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>I’m just driving down the driveway to Government House now.</p>
<p><strong>FITZY: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, you know how long you have to book to get a function centre these days for a wedding – any chance, if you’re still in Potts Point, can maybe we have a wedding at Kirribilli House if that’s free? Maybe for a couple of weekends?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, who are you planning to marry?</p>
<p><strong>FITZY: </strong></p>
<p>Well, anyone that wants to ring in – 13 24 10 – if you would like to get married.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>WITZY: </strong></p>
<p>We’re giving away a venue this morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Oh, so anyone who wants to ring in can marry you?</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>You’re not already taken?</p>
<p><strong>WITZY: </strong></p>
<p>Very giving. Very giving.</p>
<p><strong>FITZY: </strong></p>
<p>No, we’re both married Prime Minister but we thought this might be a great opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Well that’s the other question Prime Minister – how many invitations have you had since yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, I have had one but I anticipate getting some more. But I’ve got to say, it is a very, very joyful day. And this is a great day for all Australians. You know, my Government and this Parliament delivered it but it was the Australian people that made the decision. We gave everyone their say.</p>
<p><strong>WIPPA: </strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>A lot of people wanted to stop us doing that but we gave everyone their say and overwhelmingly they said ‘yes’ – ‘yes’ and get on with it. And that is what we’ve done. Now I’m literally just about to pull up at Government House so I’ll have to love you and leave you.</p>
<p><strong>FITZY: </strong></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>And with a very, very Merry Christmas on this very happy day.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
