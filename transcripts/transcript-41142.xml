    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today at around 7am our time, North Korea launched a ballistic missile which flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan and landed in the Pacific about 1000 kms east of Japan.</p>
<p>Australia condemns this latest reckless, dangerous and provocative act by the North Korean regime which continues to threaten the peace and stability of the region.</p>
<p>Australia is already implementing strong unilateral sanctions against those supporting the North Korean regime’s illegal and dangerous weapons program.</p>
<p>The United Nations  Security Council has recently decided on tough new sanctions, as well.  </p>
<p>We call on all countries to fully implement the UN Security Council sanctions to pressure Pyongyang. Effective implementation of sanctions requires a global effort.</p>
<p>In particular we welcome China’s clear intent to implement the latest sanctions which will impose a heavy economic price on North Korea for its dangerous conduct.</p>
<p>China has unique economic leverage over North Korea and with that greatest leverage comes the greatest responsibility and we urge Beijing to use it, to bring this North Korean regime to its senses.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to work with all our partners, including the United States, Japan, South Korea and China, to bring increasing pressure on North Korea to end its dangerous behaviour which poses such a threat to the security of our region and of the world. </p>
