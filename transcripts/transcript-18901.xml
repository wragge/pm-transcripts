    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>Your Royal Highnesses, I bid you a special welcome to our country and our capital.</p>
<p>To The Prince of Wales, you are a familiar visitor to these shores.</p>
<p>In you, the people of Australia know they have a true and sympathetic friend.</p>
<p>To The Duchess of Cornwall, I hope you have discovered the warmth of the Australian character and a land you will always feel welcome.</p>
<p>Since landing at Longreach on Monday, these have been days to explore and revisit the facets of our landscape and culture:</p>
<p>From the Outback, to the vineyards of South Australia, and the race that stops nation.</p>
<p>Now, we gather here in this capital to reflect on the bonds of history and affinity which made Australia the nation it is today.</p>
<p>The Father of Federation, Sir Henry Parkes, called it the “crimson thread of kinship” and the associations are all around us.</p>
<p>Not far from here is found the writing table Queen Victoria used to sign into law the Constitution that led to the creation of this capital.</p>
<p>Up on Capital Hill meets the Federal Parliament first inaugurated by King George V as Duke of Cornwall and York in 1901.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century later, another Duke of York came to open these old Parliament buildings  -  a shy prince who came to show the ‘heart and stomach of a king'.</p>
<p>Like Your Royal Highness, he too was accompanied by a gracious Duchess. Your beloved grandmother.</p>
<p>It is a story also inscribed in the streets and parks of this beautiful zone where, one by one, the East-West terraces have been named in recognition of our monarchs since Federation: Queen Victoria Terrace, King Edward Terrace, King George Terrace.</p>
<p>Today, the symmetry is made complete with the naming of Queen Elizabeth Terrace.</p>
<p>At the same time, the green space in front of Old Parliament House and two roads either side will stand in honour of Sir Henry Parkes reflecting the mix of ancient tradition and contemporary democracy that underpin our constitutional order.</p>
<p>This place will be a lasting tribute to Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee inscribed forever in the architecture of this capital.</p>
<p>It will remind future generations that for more than half of our journey as a united nation, Elizabeth the Second has been our monarch.</p>
<p>No-one in the history of our Federation has shared more consistently in the affairs of our Commonwealth or followed them with deeper interest and goodwill.</p>
<p>As Canberra prepares for its centenary, it is fitting that The Queen's life of duty is given recognition here in our nation's heart and her wisdom and dignity are honoured among the people she has so faithfully served.</p>
<p>I thank Your Royal Highnesses for sharing this commemoration with us.</p>
<p>And I know you will convey to Her Majesty the sentiments we share in naming this place today.</p>
<p>No Head of State could be more worthy of this honour, and no nation could more freely or gratefully bestow it. </p>
