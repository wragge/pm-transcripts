* PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 25 AUGUST 1978<br />
INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE UAKES<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, your put the nation on notice that this<br />
dispute could go for a month or even more. Why do you<br />
think it will go that long?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I hope very much that it won't and I hope that<br />
commnonsense will prevail over the weekend and that the<br />
votes on Monday and Tuesday unionists will take Commissioner<br />
Clarkson's advice and reject their Executive recommendation. The<br />
Commissioner has worked very hard to get a compromise<br />
proposal that's reasonable but we do need to understand<br />
and the community needs to know that as far as technical<br />
innovation is. concerned, the members of this union have<br />
got a 10-year guarantee of no retrenchments as a result<br />
of new equipment. Commissioner Clarkson's proposals which<br />
were accepted by Telecom, involve a very adequate<br />
consultation, it involves trial periods for equipment and<br />
independent assessment. Against that background I would<br />
have thought that it's a very reasonable package.<br />
QUESTION: Does this tough line mean that the Government won't budge,<br />
no matter what. That if anyone gives in it will have to<br />
be the other side?<br />
PRI14~ E MINISTER:<br />
We shouldn't look at it in terms of giving in. The Commissioner<br />
has put forward reasonable proposals. Telecom, even though it<br />
had misgivings about one or two aspects of it, accepted them<br />
and thought that it was necessary to do so in the interests<br />
of the public at large. But it's very important that Telecom<br />
be, continue to be able to advance, use new equipment, and<br />
make sure that the total Australian community can get the<br />
benefits of more efficient services and either services that<br />
contain costs or which, even in some of the circumstances,<br />
might enable the costs and charges to be reduced. And you can't<br />
do that if you are going to have some members of the Union<br />
making the point that there are no changes unless we agree<br />
with them. -So it's out of that background that the dispute's<br />
begun. </p>
<p>-2<br />
QUESTION: Let's assume that it's not settled next Tuesday. How long<br />
can Australia go without telecommunications?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's going to be very very difficult indeed. That's<br />
very plain now. At the sametine I believe it's going to be<br />
of enormous significance and of enormous cost to Australia<br />
if Telecom were to give in or if the Government were to<br />
give in relation to an issue of this kind because there are<br />
many areas within Australia where a selected group of<br />
people have got a fairly significant influence in what happens<br />
and if they are to be enabled to overthrow the processes<br />
of arbitration and conciliation and of compromise and<br />
discussion to get to a resolution of the dispute, then that<br />
means that those select groups can hold the community to<br />
ransom. The ultimate cost in that to the whole community<br />
would in the view of the Government be much greater than<br />
having to continue with this particular dispute for some<br />
time. That's why last night, I thought it necessary to put<br />
the nation on notice that the dispute could go on at great<br />
inconvenience to businesses, to individuals and to families.<br />
QUESTION: You also said that the Government has no power to force people<br />
back to work. What do you have the power to do? What action<br />
can you take?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't want to go into that in too great a detail. But there<br />
are onviously powers in relation to stand-downs and suspensions<br />
and there are extensive powers under Commonwealth legislation,<br />
some of which has been on the books for a long time, some of<br />
it not so long. No Government likes being forced into a<br />
position of using that sort of legislation but we felt it was<br />
only fair to the members of the Union themselves to indicate<br />
that the Government was determined that we thought<br />
Commissioner Clarkson's proposals ought to be supported and<br />
that we did support them, but if it takes two sides to<br />
support a compromise proposal such as the Commissioner put<br />
forward. Telecom has and if the union is* not going to<br />
support it well the Government just can't stand by and do<br />
nothing at all while this goes on and the whole network<br />
deteriorates. You've got to take action in those circumstances<br />
which are designed to try and get an ultimate resolution even<br />
if it takes some time.<br />
QUE ST ION:<br />
If your worst fears are realised and it does drag on for a month<br />
or more, have you looked at what the armed services can do?<br />
Have they got any expertise?<br />
PRIME MINI STER:<br />
There's a task force at the moment examining to see what<br />
can be done and see what facilities are available tor emergency ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ( continued)<br />
communications. One of the things which I think should be<br />
some comfort to many individuals is that it is believed that<br />
the local networks are likely to your local dialling<br />
is likely to keep in operation for quite some time and that<br />
of course is very important in relation to emergency services<br />
and hospitals and other matters of that kind. So far as<br />
business communications are concerned, going from capital city<br />
to capital city, they are virtually non-existent now.<br />
Q'UESTION: I gather telexes are being affected too? Airlines<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, a number at telexes are seriously affected. You could<br />
get to ~ the circumstances where your airlines are affected<br />
because you've got the facilities around airports which are<br />
sensitive.<br />
QUESTION: Given the seriousness of the situation, have you thought of<br />
calling on Mr. Hawke? Have you approached him in any way?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Mr. street has called a National Labour Consultative Council<br />
together. I'm not sure that a time has been fixed for a<br />
meeting just yet but I think it will be meeting quite shortly.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that Mr. Hawke will involve himself after<br />
( inaudible) with the UTAH dispute?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm told that well he's a member of that Counciland<br />
I'm told that he will be attending and I also understand<br />
that he is very concerned about the prospects. I think<br />
everyone ought to be concerned. While I felt it necessary<br />
f or the Government to state it's view clearly and state what<br />
it regarded as the national interest in this particular matter,<br />
we really do need, all of us, to remember that we are<br />
Australians first and we've all got an obligation to this<br />
country and that.... ( end tape). 000---</p>
