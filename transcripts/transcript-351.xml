ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF FARMERS' SETTLERS? ASSOCIATION<br />
SYDNEY, 31ST JUL; Y, . l<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, R. G. Men&amp; ze<br />
Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
If, technically, my job this afternoon is to declare<br />
the Conference " Open" at the end of my speech I think it might be<br />
a wise precaution if I declared it open now ( Laughter) which I<br />
do, Sir, with great goodwill.<br />
This afternoon I don't want to talk too much about<br />
things that you will talk about later on. One of them, for<br />
example, is the recent change in the basic wage. Now I am not<br />
going to debate that unduly because, like you, we take these<br />
things, if we can, as they come. But there are two aspects of<br />
the basic wage inquiry that I would like to mention very briefly.<br />
The first of them is that the thing that troubles me<br />
most about the last decision is that it seems to contemplate an<br />
annual adjustment of the basic wage on the basis of the changes<br />
i. n the Consumer Price Index. Now I don't say that it literally<br />
said that; but it appears to contemplate something in the nature<br />
of an annual adjustment on the basis of an Index figure. For<br />
myself, and speaking with great respect to the Commission which I<br />
am sure considered these matters with great care, I don't like<br />
this business of adjusting things on the basis of an Index<br />
figure, and above all, the great mass of wages in the country,<br />
because this means that overy time there is an increase the<br />
tendency will be for it to produce in the following year another<br />
increase. Consumer price indexes tend to respond, pretty<br />
accurately, to the cost level. I don't like that very much. I<br />
think that we ought always to be in a position to have the basic<br />
elements ii costs determined from time to time on a perfectly<br />
independent investigation, and on an independent footing.<br />
There are a lot of people in Australia, there may be<br />
many of them in thiscity, who don't nind if these items keep<br />
rising because, let's face up to it, there are quite a few people<br />
in Australia who have a vested interest in a degree of inflation.<br />
But you haven't. From the point of view of the man on the Land,<br />
whatever he may be producing, inflation is enemy 110o 1; and any<br />
policies that are taken to restrain inflation are of most vital<br />
importance to the great primary industries of Australia.<br />
Therefore I don't look very happily at anything that suggests<br />
that there will be automatic changes, or that we have reconciled<br />
ourselves to going up, and Iup. Speaking on behalf of the<br />
Government that has recently, I'm iold, made itself a little<br />
unpopular ( Laughter) with anti-inflationary measures, I repeat<br />
here what I have said time after time elsewhere that some people<br />
can pass on the cost of inflation, But the primary industries<br />
can't. Therefore I am not surprised, and you won't be surprised,<br />
when I tell you that although I have found in Sydney or<br />
Melbourne a few rather acid remarks being dropped w. ith great<br />
courtesy into my ear., ha~ en't found it in<br />
been recently in uoeensland, Jestcrn Aastralia. Tha mania,<br />
moving around here and there and I find, as I expected to find,<br />
a very profound belief in the minds of those who conduct rural<br />
industry that stability in prices and costs is of tremendous<br />
importance, to them; and therefore of trcmendous importance to<br />
the Australian nation.<br />
There are two groat organisms in Australia which have<br />
much to do with economic policy now get out of your minds this<br />
old idea that Canberra has all the econom. ic powers, and that<br />
Canberra can do what it wants to do, because of course it has </p>
<p>extremely limited authority but two great organisms have very<br />
great authority. One is the Tariff Board, a much respected<br />
institution, which is at the very basis of our tariff policy,<br />
and of all parties' tariff policy; and the other is the<br />
Arbitration Commission which is at the very basis of wage-fixing.<br />
I will take the second to illustrate what I have in<br />
mind. Frankly I don't think that the primary industries have yet<br />
taken sufficiently seriously the immense authority of the<br />
Arbitration Commission. There is, for instance, a claim by<br />
some Industrial Union, there is a response by a series of people<br />
in the manufacturing world, Counsel for the Union gets up and<br />
quotes balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, demonstrates<br />
that a great number of leading companies are doing very well<br />
indeed as they are and I want to know why it is that on these<br />
occasions there is not, regularly, a formidable presentation of<br />
the case for the primary industries. Nobody can do it for you.<br />
My experience in life is that if yot want something done<br />
powerfully, from your own point of view, you jolly well do it<br />
yourself. Nobody else will do it for you. There was a tinm<br />
when wage fixing did not have a direct impact on many rural<br />
industries but today it does. And I would think that the<br />
Arbitration Commission itself would welcome a powerful presentation<br />
by the primary industries of the impact of whatever claim<br />
is being made on their industries, and therefore, on the export<br />
business of Australia as a whole.<br />
I have mentioned this to individual friends of mine who<br />
are farmers and graziers and they look at mo, they detect in me<br />
the horrible signs of a former lawyer ( Laughter) and they say,<br />
" You know, very expensive; you lawyers are very expensive"<br />
although, mind you, they are very much more expensive now than<br />
they were in my time.( Laughter) And my reply to this is,<br />
" Well, that's all right. Suppose it costs a few thousands<br />
pounds to out a case to the great wage-fixing tribunal of<br />
Australia; what is that compared to the many, many millions of<br />
pounds involved, or possibly involved, in a decision?"<br />
Now I just throw that out to you not because I am<br />
advocating the interests of a profession to which no doubt I<br />
shall not return ( Laughter) much to my sorrow but because I<br />
seriously think that this is a matter that deserves constant<br />
thought. We cannot afford to have great industrial issues<br />
determined on a narrow basis; they ought to be determined on<br />
the broad national basis. They can't be, unless people like<br />
yourselves take a hand in the game.<br />
Now that is all I want to say on that matter. What I<br />
really wanted to do, Sir, in opening your Conference, which I<br />
have already done, was to say something to you about a matter<br />
which is, I suppose, on the lips of all of you today the<br />
possible entrance of the United Kingdom into the European Common<br />
Market. I understand that some announcement al be made on this<br />
matter one way or the other by the Prime Minister of the United<br />
Kingdom, at about 1 o'clock in the morning, our time that is to<br />
say just before the tea adjournment at the Test match. ( Laughter)<br />
I won't presume to anticipate what may or may not be said. All<br />
I know is that this decision is one of the most momentous<br />
decisions that the United Kingdom has had to take, in time of<br />
peace, in my lifetime, a tremendously significant decision. If<br />
the decision is to go into negotiations then of course when the<br />
negotiations have been completed and the United Kingdom knows<br />
the best turns on which it can go into the Common Market, there<br />
will be another decision, even more momentous, and that will be<br />
the decision whether to go in on the negotiated terms. So here<br />
we have an epoch-making ratter, a matter which has been in the </p>
<p>air now for a couple of years, a matter on which Imysolf have<br />
had discussions over the last two years with Chancellor<br />
Adonauer of Germany, with General De Gaulle, the President cf<br />
France, and of course with Ministers in Groat Britain. And the<br />
other day the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Mr.<br />
Duncan Sandys, came out hero and he had discussions with us,<br />
having had discussions in Now Zealand. And having had talks<br />
with us he went on to Canada and had discussions thereo<br />
In the first place, we have had general talks about, this<br />
matter for a long time past. This was the first time on which<br />
we had had specific talks and had got down to what you might.<br />
call some of the brass tacks of the problem. Because this will<br />
be very much, no doubt, in the press in the neal future, it might<br />
help you if I tried to explain to you what the various aspects of<br />
this matter are that concern us, that concern you and rn,<br />
Nobody in Australia can be dogatic at this time because<br />
half of the questions that arise are not yet capable of answer.<br />
Don't write me down as being violently opposed to something, or<br />
in support of something: I'm just going to tell you what I<br />
believe to be the issues, and how we ought to approach them.<br />
First let us have in mind that the Treaty of Rome was<br />
executed years ago there are six countries in it, France<br />
Germany, Italy, and what we call the Bonelux countries, Belgium,<br />
the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The object of the exercise was<br />
that over a period of years 10 years in the first place I<br />
think it was, now lookihg rather more like 8 or 7, or perhaps 6,<br />
they would gradually develop a Common External Tariff so that<br />
there would be a uniform customs duty right round this area. as<br />
against the rest of the world. There are one or two exceptions<br />
like tropical colonies, but I won't complicate the matter by<br />
dealing with them.<br />
At the same time as they achieved a conmon external<br />
customs barrier, they were to develop internal free trade, so<br />
that in due course the products of Germany would enter France<br />
free of duty, the products of France enter Germany free of duty,<br />
and so on. Therefore if Great Britain were to go into that<br />
schere now, unconditionally, as the other six have, the position<br />
would be that French wheat would go into England free of duty,<br />
and that Australian wheat would pay a duty to go in. This would<br />
be preference in reovrso; this would mean a complete internal<br />
preferential free trade area in Europe, including Great Britain,<br />
and a common customs barrier against the rest of the world,<br />
including countries like our own.<br />
Now that is if they went in unconditionally. I've no<br />
reason to suppose that they will. But the other six have all<br />
gone in unconditionally and they are working towards that<br />
conclusion. If Great Britain wont in unconditionally then I have<br />
no doubt that the Scandinavian countries would; and if that<br />
turned out to be right, as I am sure it would, then the position<br />
would be that Danish butter would pass in free of duty into the<br />
United Kingdom market whereas Australian buttor, and Now Zea. land<br />
butter because butter is an enormous item in that country<br />
would be up against a tariff barrier. These are obviously very<br />
grave considerations for us.<br />
But it isn't fer us to tell Great Britain how to run her<br />
business. IJe can offer our views I got almost hoarse offering<br />
mine in the course of our negotiations with my friend Duncan<br />
Sandys we can offer our views, we are not without them. But in<br />
the long run, as we emphasised at all stages, the United Kingdon<br />
will determine for itself what it is going to do. No doubt it<br />
will pay great attention to what has been said in the<br />
Commonwealth countries. </p>
<p>4.<br />
One of the things that Great Britain has to answer and<br />
I don't know the answer to this is whether in fact her memborship<br />
of the Connon Market would strengthen her own economy. Now<br />
it is tremendously important to us that her oconomy should be<br />
strengthened, because if it weakens, and ieakens and weakens<br />
our own direct market will weaken and weaken and weaken. We have<br />
a great commercial, material interest in the non-weakening of the<br />
United Kingdom oconomy. Some United Kingdom lead*, rs, no doubt,<br />
believe that if they o into the Cor. on Market they will have a<br />
big hone market, 200, 250 million people, bigger than the United<br />
States of Aeorica and that this will, by extending their home<br />
market, increase their competitive position in the world. That<br />
is a very intelligible argument.<br />
But of course, on the other hand, countries like<br />
Germany which, having had their heavy industries wiped out during<br />
the war now have completely modern heavy industries, may find<br />
thor: 3elves able to compete in Great Britain itself at a position<br />
of gireat advantage, compared with s,. me of the older heavy<br />
industries in the old country. iell these are great<br />
considerations. Weo nust all hope that no error will be made in<br />
the conclusion that is arrived at bec-use we have a very large<br />
indirect interest in the wisdom of any decision that is taken.<br />
Now I say no more about that; I just turn to our own particular<br />
interests. We have benefiting from Commonw-alth referenco, or from<br />
special agreements, wheat, butter, dairy products of one kind and<br />
another, moat, sugar, dried fruits, I needn't go through the<br />
whole list, as distinguished from wool whica com. mands its own<br />
world market. With these products we have special arrangements<br />
which are of irmmense value to us. We regard ourselves, as the<br />
Australian Government, as having a primary duty, a primary duty<br />
to protect those interests. Therefore we devoted a good deal<br />
of time to discussing then, to pointing out that you can't simply<br />
turn a preferential system upside down without exposing our<br />
export industries in these fields to very great danger. We have<br />
teen told by the United Kingdom representative that not only will<br />
we be, of course closely consulted on these matters, but, as we<br />
ourselves requested, they will do their best to see that when<br />
they come, in the course of negotiaticns, to deal with our<br />
products, wheat, meat, whatever they r. ay be, Australia, if they<br />
have their way, will be represented in the negotiations<br />
themselves. Now that, of course, depends not merely on the<br />
goodwill of the old country, but it depends on the attitude of<br />
the Six, all of whom are getting stronger and stronger under the<br />
Common Market system. But we will persist in our view that<br />
nobody can argue the case for our export industries half so well<br />
as we can ourselves; that we are not willing, or not happy, to<br />
have these things dealt with by deputies. We must, ourselves,<br />
have the opportunity of beingpresent, and presenting the view<br />
that we want to present about the industries that I have been<br />
referring to. I am sure that the British Government will do its<br />
best to produce that result.<br />
It may well be that if negotiations started next month<br />
it ,.. ould be months before any conclusion had been reached; but<br />
the day will come, perhaps in the first half of next year, I<br />
wouldn't think before, when the whole negotiation having been<br />
thrashed out, the Government of the United Kingdom will know what<br />
terms it can get for a modified accession to the Treaty of Rcme,<br />
to the Cor. on Market. Then we will have one of the great and.<br />
climactic decisions of modern history. Because if the decision<br />
fell -against the interlests of the Cormonwealth countries if the<br />
decision meant that our preferences that we now enjoy either were<br />
very heavily modified or disappe. red, then of course it would.<br />
mean the beginning of the und of the whole preferential trade<br />
texture that has characterised the British Commonwealth almost<br />
since its boeinning. So that is a great, historic event.<br />
I </p>
<p>And from our point of view more than an historic event<br />
because it would imean that we would be forced by circunstances<br />
to develop new markets we are always looking for tho of<br />
course but the heat would be on to develop now markets, to try<br />
to repair the partial loss of the old. No doubt Great Britain<br />
herself would be forced to realise that preferential trade is a<br />
two-way trade and this, therefore, might have enormous<br />
significance to the business that the United Kingdom writes in<br />
Australia. I don't know; we haven't worked that one out; we<br />
prefer to look at that if, and when, the occasion arises.<br />
Now all that is on the economic side. All I want to say<br />
to you gentlemen is that nobody could be more clearly seized than<br />
we are of the vital importance of protecting ou positions in<br />
these respects. I already had a cormmittee of officials working<br />
in London before Mr. Sandys came out here. There will no d-' ubt<br />
be further conferences, either official or unofficial, in the<br />
course of the next month or two. It all depends on whether the<br />
British Government decides to neotiate; and we will know that<br />
by tomorrow morning. But on top of all that and this is<br />
going to , ive us a tremendous task on behalf of the export<br />
industry on behalf of industries that are vital to the<br />
development of Australia, l-t's make no error about it the<br />
decision here can have a very big impact on the whole Commonwealth<br />
structure. You know this thing we used to call the British Empire<br />
has g.. ne through some strange changes in my own political<br />
lifetime. It bucame D Comm. irnwealth and nov it has changed; it<br />
has a wider membership, it has less cohesion; its members<br />
disagree with one another more than they over did before. True,<br />
Canada, Auralia, New Zealand stand in the allegiance to the<br />
Throne that groat subtle element that charact. rises the old<br />
British Empire but the rest. Republics, one thing and another,<br />
are not in the allegiance to the Throno. They a: re now countries,<br />
they are not as familiar as we are with our systems of Governn~<br />
nt, or our instinctive feelings about Governront. ie have an<br />
immense variety of nations in the Commonwealth and they grow<br />
every day. ioll that is a metaphorical expression: there are<br />
two or three recently in each year. It is very important<br />
therefore to consider from our point of view whether the<br />
relationship, the Commonwealth relationship, that exists between<br />
a country like Australia and the old country remains intact;<br />
whether, when I go, if I'n still Prime Minister, which they tell<br />
me is improLable, whether when I go to London to have a<br />
conference, I can still talk to the Prime Minister of the United<br />
Kingdom as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, not as<br />
something else, but as the head of another Government in<br />
another great Commonwealth country. Now this seems to me to be<br />
tremendously important because it is those contacts and these<br />
discussions which now contain, I think, the true essence of the<br />
Commonwealth. Suppose, on some terms or another, Great Britain goes<br />
into the Common Market. The Com-mon Market is not only an<br />
economic device, not , merly something designed to build up the<br />
industrial strength of the European nations, it is a great<br />
political conception. I r. ade rather a point of that when Mr.<br />
Sandys was out here and I saw it strongly confirmed a few days<br />
ago when the Six had a meeting, and issued a communique in which<br />
they said that the political aspects were tremendously important<br />
and that they were going to work towards coinmon political<br />
organisms, towards cor-aon policies. l" ow this may be a very<br />
great thing for the world I don't sit in jud eint, becausa I<br />
don't know how it is going to be worked out.-it may be that it<br />
will be a tremendous thing for the world to have a cohesive<br />
Europe so that you have, in effect, a third great world power,<br />
and one on the free side. That has iimense and exciting<br />
possibilities. </p>
<p>6.<br />
All I do is to say this: I record the fact that if that<br />
happens and Europe, including Great Britain, develops these new<br />
political organisms, common policies, integrated policies then<br />
you can hardly say that the British Cor. m-onwealth remains the<br />
sane. Because then a Priue Minister of Australia would be<br />
dealing with the Prime Minister of Grcat Britain, not as the<br />
Prime Minister of Great Britain, but as a very influential member<br />
of a European association which had, perhaps, overwhelming<br />
importance and very naturally in the mind of London, Now<br />
rwhether that is good or bad don't ask me to say. I used to be<br />
accused of being an old-fashioned Imperialist; I have even been<br />
referred to, quite courteoa sly, as a great Cormonwealth man; I<br />
achit that I am almost lost in a lot of these modern dovelopnents<br />
almost lost. But I don't think that it is sensible to pretend<br />
that something is the sane, wlhen it has changed. Therefore<br />
think we must make up our minds that if there is a ne otiation,<br />
and if the negotiation succeeds on torms which may not be<br />
entirely satisfactory to us, then the new set-up, not only<br />
economically, but politically, will tend to direct the attention<br />
of Great Britain to Europe, and to that extent, away from some<br />
other parts of the world.<br />
Sir, that is not a very cheerful reflection; but it is<br />
one that is in my mind and that is in the minds of all my<br />
colleagues and I sincerely hope that we are wrong. We may well<br />
be. There have been people unkind enough before today to say<br />
that wje were wrong about somethings once or twice between you<br />
and me I hazve thought we wore. ( Laughter) I hope we are wrong on<br />
this natter. But what I have been saying to you is not designed -o<br />
represent a series of do;~ atic views but to illustrate to you<br />
that if the decision is taken to negotiate we are going to be<br />
onlookers, and I hope participants, so far as the Government is<br />
concerned, in a series of economic and political negotiations,<br />
which I believe will be the most important that we have been<br />
involved in in ry lifetime. Therefore we must hope for<br />
wisdom; we must have patience; we must not rush, unduly, to<br />
conclusions. But the price of our maintaining our position as a<br />
nation will be eternal vigilance. And all I promise to you on<br />
behalf of my own Governmeont is that we will be vigilant, we will<br />
be persistent, we will be getting in the back door from tine to<br />
time if we can't get in the front; we are determined that on all<br />
these matters the interests of our own country shall never be<br />
overlooked. </p>
