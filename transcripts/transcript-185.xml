1825_ RA1 1980<br />
Asked about his reactions to the news from Paris, Mr. Mensies<br />
saids " Well, I suppose I'm like all the rest of us it makes one<br />
feel very anxious but my first reaction to what appears oe the surface<br />
of the problem so far is that it is an unparalleled piece of hmnbug.<br />
I mean, the greatest experts in spying in recent tines asking another<br />
Power to apologise humbly seem to me to be almost unbelievable. In<br />
fact it is so absurd it can't really be the whole root of the matter.<br />
From the time this incident occurred about this aircraft the one thing<br />
that stuck in my mind is that it was near enough to a thousand miles<br />
inside Russian territory, if that's the right word. That alom of<br />
course wouldn't be very comforting to Ehrushcher, because if aircraft<br />
ean travel as far as that at great heights undetected, quite obviously<br />
S the capacity of the Western Powers to deliver the aeclear weapon is<br />
greater than perhaps the Soviet leaders have permitted their people to<br />
believe. That will explain the real anger on his part. If there is<br />
no sueh explanation then it is simulated anger and I would think it is<br />
a pretty poor thing when the people of the world, who have a vested<br />
interest in peace, or a contingent interest let's say, or a great belief<br />
in it, or a wonderful desire for it, should find these negotiations just<br />
set aside for propaganda points. That I think would be unpardonable<br />
and I believe that the uncommitted portions of the world would think so.<br />
Q the whole therefore I think that Khrushchev has done more harm than<br />
good to his own cause".<br />
Asked about future prospects Mr. Menzies went on:<br />
SCh well, that's anybody's guess. Tou're thinking in terms of<br />
a Treaty with East Germany, pressure on Berlin. You see, for all we<br />
know they will meet this afternoon. How do we know? hrushchev's<br />
nothing if he is not spectacular. I think he is the best propaganda<br />
expert in the world. He has made a slip this time, if it is propaganda".<br />
SQuestioned about the possibility of pressures within Russia<br />
itself, Mr. Measies indicated that one knows little about that. It was,<br />
however, quite conceivable that there may have been unobasant reactions<br />
to the journey of a thousand miles over Russian territory. Mr. Mensies<br />
also referred to " some symptoms of the rise of what we might call the<br />
new Bourgeoisie inside the Soviet Union. It is bound to happen when some<br />
people are paid a great deal more than others and live rather better than<br />
others. You caa' abolish these distinctions just by act of Parliament.<br />
I think there are a few symptom of some growth of that kind but how far<br />
it goes, how far it is vocal and how far it can exercise pressure I<br />
wouldn't know". Mr. Menzies further said that Khrushchev is very flexible about<br />
his tactics but they don't affect the direction of the battle or the<br />
objectives of it. </p>

Asked about the suggestion in the United States that the<br />
plane was delivered to him and not shot do=, Mir. Menzies replied:<br />
* In these fields I an the least expert of people and I<br />
have had no mpert advice. But as a layman like most of usn hero,<br />
I find it a little difficult to believe that if you shot a plane<br />
down at that enormous height by some rocket device there would be<br />
time for the pilot to bale out or that you would collect so neatly<br />
coins, wedding rings which in the event of semething of that kind<br />
must have been sea aduIover many square miles.* Therefore, one is<br />
peormitted to be skeptical and to think that the plane perh~ aps for<br />
other reasons had to ceme down and that the pilot baled out".<br />
Asked about his own hopes from the Summit, Mr. Menzies said:<br />
* I had hopes that some result would come out not on a wide<br />
field but for zaxple there were two things<br />
the suspension of nuclear tests. Thy got so close<br />
to each other at Geneva on this matter that I had<br />
hopes that the four leaders sitting down together or<br />
at anry rate three of them, I am omitting Do Gaulle<br />
ifto, r It htihso upgrhpt oteh, a bt ecleaaudsee rsh em migihgth t bne oat bblee tionv oslevtetdl ein-'<br />
that matter by giving a broad diretion to the Geneva<br />
negotiaters which wouild produce a moratorium right<br />
down the sale; and<br />
not to settle the berlin quetion ( which is still<br />
bedevilled by all sorts of juristic and military<br />
considerations) but that they might have got some<br />
standstill arrangement in relation to Berlin for a<br />
period of time even though it might not be a long<br />
period. If we could have got one of those or both<br />
ot those out of the Summit Meeting it would have<br />
loosened things up and given people a good deal of<br />
hope for the future".<br />
In reply to a question on the future of Woomera, Mr. Menzies<br />
said: " Woomera wo't of course by any means disappear, but whether<br />
it will mintain its full range of activities I would think would depend<br />
upon the study that is being made here now on its possible wse for space<br />
research. I think there is a good deal of feeling that in Whs spae<br />
research business the United Kingdom ought to have a hamd. If the result<br />
is that we are going to have space rfmearok, then the overall eff ect of<br />
the abandonmet of Blue Streak as a weapon would be comprative3y small.<br />
But I think it all has to be understood that their judgement as to whether<br />
Blue Streak should be continued must be parimount. ThqV are the people<br />
who are in the immediate firing line. Thqr are the people who under<br />
the pressat arrangements possess some share of the deterrent and it is<br />
their military advise which must be of paramount importance in determininag<br />
whether you are going to have a vehicle of this kind sent from a fied<br />
place. Sir Charles Lambe came out to Australia and he discussed this<br />
with = and with three or four Ministers direetly e. aorned,, including the<br />
Minist er for Def ence. We were by no means disposed to disagree with the<br />
views that thq were taking*. </p>
<p>11r. Mensies was asked -" Now that you have had an opportunity<br />
to got a true picttre of the situation in South Africa from Mr. Louw, will<br />
you say what the Australian Government's attitude in to South Africa's<br />
racial policy". He repliods<br />
01 don't know that I will. I man, whenever I say something<br />
like that it is suggested in some quart-ers that we are approving of their racial<br />
po3. icy, That is not the position at all. What we have done in to adopt<br />
what the Conference in London agreed was the correct attitude. We do not<br />
interfere in th. domestic policies or affairs of another memiber of the<br />
Comonwealth. The whole Conference here abreed with that. I don't know<br />
whether we have the complete picture yet because several of us had-, private<br />
talks,. I suppose all of us one way or another with Mr. Lmzw, he has very<br />
strong views, but in the course of these private talks at least five of us<br />
of the group to which I vas attached ( and that includes one Afriopn and<br />
two Asian Prime Ministers) put to Mr. Lauw after a good deal of to * 3d fro<br />
and explanations by him, certain ideas which we thought would softeA the<br />
asperities of this policy and perhaps make it a good deal more workalg. e,<br />
practicable, rasonable, witower word you care to use, and he told 4~ that<br />
he would convey those notions to the Prime Minister. He was in a difficult<br />
position bemause he was representing his Prime, Minister; he just couldn't<br />
speak with much authority as if he was Prime Minister. I must say that all<br />
these suggestions were made in the i~ odeato and good tempered way. I mas<br />
greatly imnpressed by the fact that those three colleagues ( Ekrmih and<br />
I Taaku) didn't s* am to be making hysterical extravagant remarks or proposals<br />
at &amp; 34. On the contrary they recognised the difficulty that presented the<br />
South African sukment, the difficulty which so maxr people don't appear<br />
to realieq because they have a grnat difficulty one that I am very glad<br />
we don't have to deal with in Australia. It is easy to be theoretical<br />
about what you would do if you had a multi-racial society. We don't have<br />
the problema to cope with and under those circumstances I feel that their<br />
recognition of the, fact that there was that problem and that you couldn't<br />
do thing in a hurry was very good.<br />
" I didn't hear an illtmpored remsk made om the matter.<br />
In point of fact the Confere* ce its elf realised what a nuimber of people<br />
outside do not realises that the argument was not all Sbarpevifle.<br />
Sharpevifl was not discussed in the Prime Minister'sa Conference as an.<br />
incident. What vas discussed was the policy, to the extent that it van<br />
not discussed in formal meetings but what we were talking about in private<br />
meeting was the policy of Apartheid and its political, social, JJAUstri<br />
manifotations. -Of course, the incident of Sharpowille broUg~&amp; t4 ito<br />
the picture betause it is not to be forgotten that this polic7 Allsit<br />
start yesterday it is 15 or 20 years olds and ar a matter of fact<br />
Louw claimed, and I think he is right, it was first stated Saduts<br />
himself, though Smuts himself, of course, had ideas of method * W dogepe<br />
and temper whiqh were not necessarily those of his suM eon I I"<br />
it has nibeenbo brougtt up before at the Prim Minister's 6otre. t<br />
but taihtks time, no doubt because of the world wide reaci -,, ito tho<br />
to the Sbarpoville incident and the undoubted fact that in 4 h<br />
countries of the Cm~ nwealth outside South Africa there w, 7t Uf~* m oW52<br />
strong feelings. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
* I agree with the Tunka, ( what the Tumku. ins upposed to<br />
have said) that the knowledge pined by Leow here of the depth of<br />
feeling, non* the less deep because it has been moderately expressed,<br />
mst have some effect on his mind. It may very well have an effect<br />
on the mind of his Prime Minister". Mr. Menzies continued:<br />
N kid my piece on these matters in May private talks<br />
and I think it would be very unwise of ae to be reproducing publicly<br />
what the private talks that couldn't have been held under other<br />
countries".<br />
AID TO AI Asked about a " Colombo plan for African oountries*<br />
discussed at the Conference, Mr. Uen21ems aidt<br />
" I think there is reference to that in the comwanique,<br />
but what happened in effect was this. It uas raised when we were<br />
having a general discussion on regional economic problem, and the U. K.<br />
mentioned this in relation to the Colombo plan. I said that the<br />
problem of the development of Africa was tremendously important, that<br />
we had in the pest, I thought, under-estimated it. Now there are<br />
people in Africa. The movement towards independence is rapid<br />
and accelerating. The fact is itis going faut. We will have a position<br />
in which politically independent commuities will be in many cases<br />
, economically dependent, which is an unhappy state of affairs and could<br />
easily lead to social disorders and propagunda results of a very unhappy<br />
kind and under thoe circumstances I believe that we have to take<br />
into immediate study the possibilities of decidinig a comprehensive<br />
plan of some kind for Africa, not necessarily along exactly the same<br />
lines as the Colombo plan but one worked out.<br />
" Nobody is agreed in principle to this thing yet but we,<br />
are all attracted to the idea.* When I get back hoe I will have my<br />
people work on these, and in fact one of the official committees already<br />
existing is going to have a look into this, to examine its practicability<br />
and what sort of scheme could be worked out of a practical kindN.<br />
