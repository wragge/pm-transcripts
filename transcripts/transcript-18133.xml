The President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, will undertake a bilateral visit to Australia on 16 and 17 November.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming President Obama to Australia. The United States is Australia's closest ally and partner. The Alliance is fundamental to Australia's security and a cornerstone of stability in the Asia-Pacific region. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Alliance.</p>
<p>The United States is also a vital economic partner for Australia. In addition to its status as the world's largest economy, the United States is Australia's largest source of foreign investment and our third largest two-way trading partner. </p>
<p>President Obama's visit will come immediately after he chairs the APEC heads of government meeting in Honolulu and before his historic participation in the newly-expanded East Asia Summit in Bali.  </p>
<p>The President's visit will be an important opportunity to renew our close ties and take forward shared objectives, including restoring the health of the global economy and promoting growth and jobs, planning for transition in Afghanistan and developing strong institutions which can help address the region's political, security and economic challenges.  </p>
