STATE PFNCTION ROOK, PARLIA HOUSE<br />
PORT MRESBY 3 SEPTMBMR 1990<br />
When I first visited Port Moresby, the year was 1965, and<br />
Australia's relationship to what was then called the<br />
Territory of Papua and New Guinea was a purely colonial,<br />
decidedly paternalistic one.<br />
In the years since, I have visited Papua New Guinea on many<br />
occasions and, when I have not been able to visit, I have<br />
kept myself closely informed of events here.<br />
I witnessed your steady progress towards independence and<br />
the eaergence of the leaders of your new nation; I<br />
understood your pride and joy as you celebrated independence<br />
in 1975; I have watched with a sense of involvement and<br />
encouragement the steps you have taken since independence;<br />
and now I return, for my fourth visit as Prime Minister, to<br />
meet with you again on the eve of your 15th anniversary of<br />
nationhood. Recalling today that first visit to Port Moresby in 1965, I<br />
think you are entitled to be deeply satisfied that the<br />
legitimate expectations about nationhood and selfdeterminatinn<br />
that wpre ttrring then, have been so<br />
significantly fulfilled.<br />
Let us be clear in describing the magnitude of that initial<br />
task of nation building. The old Territory of Papua New<br />
Guinea, its boundaries and components, was a purely<br />
artificial entity the product of decisions made by<br />
imperial planners in far-off capitals. There was little<br />
geographic or ethnic coherence to it; it was truly the<br />
cTraC-Lira v&amp; cX ® * tle, wl.. Ml~ ® * k ® waliS iXthl&gt; nwneqrChf*<br />
independence for a nation of Papua New Guinea had a doubly<br />
difficult challenge: they had not only to create the<br />
institutions of nationhood, they had also to create the very<br />
concept of it.<br />
So your achievement is so much the greater than many others<br />
who started with simpler and more natural building blocks. </p>
<p>S<br />
2.<br />
But I don't pretend no one should pretend that the<br />
decade and a half that have passed since independence have<br />
been plain sailing. They have not, for that matter, been<br />
plain sailing in Australia.<br />
It is true to say that Papua New Guinea has never passed<br />
through a more difficult test of character and resolve than<br />
it is passing through today. That is my judgment and it is<br />
your judgment too, Prime Minister.<br />
From many sources some external, such as the tall in<br />
commodity prices, and some internal, not the least of which<br />
is the question of Bougainville strong pressures are being<br />
felt that pose the profoundest challenge to the nation that<br />
years ago was albout to celcbwiito ito indoporidonce.<br />
I want to say at the outset how grateful I an to you Rabbie,<br />
and to Margaret, f or your kind invitation to Hazel and me to<br />
visit at this difficult time.<br />
We have already spoken about these important issues,<br />
Mr Prime Minister, and we shall do so again. I want to say<br />
how greatly I value hearing your views, and the views of<br />
your colleagues and of the many other political and business<br />
leaders I shall meet throughout Papua New Guinea on this<br />
visit. At the same time, I hope in all these discussions to outline<br />
Australia's views to underline both the depth and enduring<br />
nature of Australia's friendship and commitment to Papua New<br />
Guinea; and the very real constraints the very proper<br />
constraints we feel in intruding in any way in Papua New<br />
Guinea's own efforts to solve these troubling issues and to<br />
realise your considerable potential as a sovereign nation.<br />
I want to develop these thoughts first by making some<br />
comments about the broader international environment in<br />
which we operate an environment that has changed in<br />
fundamental ways even in the fifteen months since you, Prime<br />
Minister, last visited us in Canberra.<br />
We are seeing nothing less than the emergence of a new world<br />
order. After four decades of the relative certainties of<br />
superpower deterrence as awesome and terrifying as those<br />
certainties were we are moving with hope into an era in<br />
which superpower cooperation is replacing rivalry; in which<br />
disarmament is replacing the accumulation of weapons; and in<br />
which democracy and the respect for huan rights are<br />
replacing despotism and the abuse of human rights.<br />
We are each democratic nations. we are each conceurzed to<br />
see international peace and co-operation. These are<br />
therefore trends most welcome to Australia and Papua New<br />
Guinea alike.<br />
But the optimism with which we survey this less threatening<br />
world is tempered by the fact that, in the wake of the<br />
sharply bipolar post-war decades, multipolar diplomacy may<br />
provide different uncertainties and different headaches. </p>
<p>A 3.<br />
We have every reason to hope that the great international<br />
institutions in which Australia and Papua New Guinea<br />
participate like the United Nations and the Commonwealthwill<br />
work better, but their workings will be more complex,<br />
more challenging.<br />
Patience will be needed to hear out the more numerous<br />
voices, and skill will be needed to weigh uip the more finely<br />
balanced competing interests.<br />
And of course regional conflicts can still pose grave<br />
threats to peace and prosperity as we are starkly seeing<br />
in the Persian Gulf today.<br />
In such a world, consultation and regional cooperation will<br />
be not just optional extras for governments; they will have<br />
to become deeply engrained habits.<br />
In this regard, I believe we nations of the Asia-Pacific rimhave<br />
good reason for confidence.<br />
First, we have an unparalleled basis for building prosperity<br />
for all ou~ r peoples.<br />
This region of high growth, high output, high productivity<br />
and intense trade complementarities, is rich in<br />
opportunities for all of us; though or course in this<br />
intensely competitive region, we will have to run faster<br />
just to keep up for example, in attracting foreign<br />
investment and integrating ourselves with regional<br />
developments. Second, friendly, constructive and candid dialogue among the<br />
nations of our region is already a fact of life as ASEAN<br />
shows and, of direct relevance to Australia and Papua New<br />
Guinea, as the South Pacific Forum also shows.<br />
I point with a certain pride of authorship too, to the<br />
progress being made by the new regional foru of Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Cooperation. I look forward with<br />
anticipation to the time when Papua New Guinea can itself<br />
become a member of APEC.<br />
This changing world requires us to look closely at the<br />
nature and prospects of the Australia-Papua New Guinea<br />
relationship. The transformation of the global strategic environment, the<br />
dynamism of east Asia, and the emergence of new generations<br />
of post-independence leaders and issues throughout the South<br />
Pacific including here in this most populous of the<br />
Pacific Island countries have rendered many of our<br />
assumptions and images-of the past outdated and irrelevant.<br />
our relationship is too important to us both to see it<br />
suffer from any failure by us to bring ourselves and our<br />
assumptions up to date. </p>
<p>The real, contemporary basis of our relationship is<br />
accurately described in the Joint Declaration of Principles<br />
that was signed by then Prime Minister Wingti and myself in<br />
1987.<br />
Together with other agreements, and notably the Development<br />
Cooperation Treaty that Prime minister Namaliu. and I signed<br />
last year, we have a comprehensive framework within which to<br />
take forward the relationship between our two countries well<br />
into the next century.<br />
The absolutely fundamental feature of that framework is the<br />
recognition that we are each sovereign independent nations.<br />
The relationship between us has thankfully changed<br />
utterly from the colonial one that I saw at first hand in<br />
1965; it has changed substantially since independence; and<br />
it is evolving still.<br />
The Joint Declaration a wholly commendable initiative<br />
first propoood by Papua Now Guinea wo A lndamrk in this<br />
evolution because it recognised and articulated that the socalled<br />
' special' relationship between us that dominated the<br />
first decade or so after independence, was itself a phase<br />
through which we had passed.<br />
In many eyes here, the ' special' relationship represented a<br />
restriction on your political and economic sovereignty an<br />
unsatisfactory half-way house on the road to full<br />
sovereignty.<br />
The Joint Declaration was designed to spell out the fact<br />
that Australia and Papua New Guinea, enduring friends as we<br />
are and uniquely important to each other as we always will<br />
be, are nevertheless independent nations with sole<br />
responsibility for shaping our own destinies.<br />
I'k ppa" RwnuR" fl&amp;~! ta in Inn1k1ng at h<br />
whe chancjun iiiu vu. aixt ziage-_, : or oxasuplu, La. vie boon<br />
designed to recognise the principles outlined in the joint<br />
Declaration. Instead of simply providing direct budget assistance, our<br />
total aid package still running at more than $ 300 million<br />
a year is increasingly being directed to specific projects<br />
determined in accordance with Papua New Guinea priorities.<br />
We sponsor projects in taxaition and customs not to do the<br />
job of revenue raising for you but, as a friend, to assist<br />
Papua New Guinea itself to strengthen these essential<br />
institutions of nationhood, and so to improve your own firm<br />
foundations for revenue. one of the stated goals of the<br />
Treaty that we signed last year, Rabbie, was the achievement<br />
by Papua New Guinea of fiscal self-reliance.<br />
We provide police assistance not because we believe we can<br />
solve law and order problems but to help you do the job<br />
yourselves. </p>
<p>We are involved in land management and rural development<br />
schemes with the same intention in mind.<br />
We have provided some 2000 Papua New Guineans with<br />
scholarships and training awards in Australia over the last<br />
decade in the firm belief that people with education and<br />
training are the best resources for any country, Australia<br />
included, to make economic and political progress.<br />
This transformation in our aid package reflects the broader<br />
truth of Papua New Guinea's sovereign independent status.<br />
We have no wish to intervene to solve your problemsi it<br />
would not be proper for us to interfere in the way you<br />
manage your affairs.<br />
More importantly still, Australia has no-caMacj finally to<br />
solve these problems.<br />
Because if effective solutions are to be found and of<br />
course, they can be found they must be solutions that<br />
emerge from within Papua New Guinea and are implemented by<br />
Papua New Guinea not from outside.<br />
Like all societies, Papua New Guinea has its own way of<br />
doing things. Your ability to talk things through, your<br />
capacity to find solutions that fit, are arts that are<br />
different from those that have evolved in<br />
Australia and elsewhere; and that are<br />
essential to the successful creation of a<br />
cohesive, efficient Papua New Guinea nation.<br />
It is simply not possible or desirable to turn the clock<br />
back to 1975 or 1965 or for that matter, 1985, before we<br />
signed the Joint Declaration of Principles.<br />
The suggestion occasionally made that Australia should<br />
transfer large numbers of public servants or consultants<br />
or military advisers to help you is just not on.<br />
That would make a mockery of the whole process of<br />
independence and nation building which the Founding Fathers<br />
of your country so forcefully and so properly demanded.<br />
Of course having said all that I would not want to be<br />
misinterpreted as suggesting that Australia will somehow<br />
walk away from our commitment to help Papua New Guinea.<br />
I tell you emphatically, we are too important to each other<br />
to allow that to happen.<br />
We've been through too much together for our friendship ever<br />
to be broken. </p>
<p>-4<br />
6.<br />
And you have made too much progress in building a tree,<br />
democratic society with a free press with established<br />
capacities for the fair delivery of services to all parts of<br />
the nation with continuing economic development for us<br />
ever to want to see that progress reversed or those<br />
principles diminished.<br />
But we simply cannot nor would you want us to reinsert.<br />
ourselves in your domestic issues and attempt to impose a<br />
solution that could only be second-best, short-lived, and<br />
ultimately counter-productive.<br />
This is the context in which I place any consideration of<br />
the question of Bougainville.<br />
We fully support the Papua New Guinea Government's resolute<br />
commitment to a political solution and we agree with you<br />
that Bougainville must remain an integral part of Papua New<br />
Guinea. We welcome the Endeavour Accord as a possible framework for<br />
the restoration of services to Bougainville and as a stop in<br />
the right direction towards the resolution of this issue.<br />
we want to see a settlement. We have already indicated our<br />
willingness to assist in the rehabilitation of Bougainville.<br />
But we have no direct role in constructing a settlement.<br />
Our Defence Cooperation program with Papua New Guinea is<br />
aimed in common with the rest of our assistance to you<br />
at strengthening the institutions of your nation.<br />
We are committed to helping you improve the capability of<br />
your security forces, although the objectives and priorities<br />
for their use in meeting the new challenges of the 1990s are<br />
of course for you to decide.<br />
The time is long past when Australian forces could act in an<br />
internal security role in Papua New Guinea, except perhaps<br />
in the most extraordinary, agreed, and limited of<br />
circumstances. That means no doubt there will be some changes in emphasis<br />
in the Papua New Guinea Defence Force's objectives and<br />
perhaps structure. When Papua New Guinea is ready, we will<br />
be happy to help you develop the necessary capabilities<br />
under our Defence Cooperation program.<br />
Ny friends,<br />
These are the kinds of issues important and complex ones<br />
that i look forward t6-discussing with you all during this<br />
visit. I am confident the future for Papua New Guinea, and its<br />
relations with Australia, are bright if we continue to<br />
make the right decisions. </p>
<p>In saying that I am not indulging in idle speculation or<br />
polite platitudes.<br />
I truly believe that you should have every confidence in<br />
your abilities and your prospects.<br />
I look at the physical resources of your great land: the<br />
agricultural, mineral and energy wealth that is waiting to<br />
be tapped.<br />
I look at the considerable sum of foreign private<br />
investment in Papua New Guinea, including $ 1.8 billion<br />
already invested by Australians a sun that is likely to<br />
rise sharply.<br />
I look at the support you have been extended by the<br />
international financial community, as evidenced by the<br />
recent World Bank Consultative Group Meeting, which reflects<br />
very widespread approval of your program of stabilisation<br />
and long-term structural adjustment.<br />
I luuk uL ripa New Guinans growing roles on the<br />
international stage, reflecting an increasingly outwardlooking<br />
orientation and backed up by an ever stronger<br />
network of nations here in the South Pacific who together<br />
are confronting and resolving critical regional issues.<br />
Papua Now Guinea's voice an independent and clear voiceis<br />
heard with respect by nations in the region on a wide<br />
range of issues. we will ourselves always listen with<br />
respect to what Papua New Guinea has to say.<br />
I look at the strong democratic institutional framework of<br />
nationhood that you have created, and your genuine efforts<br />
to increase political stability through reforms to the<br />
Constitution. I look at your repeated capacity to produce political<br />
leaders of character, vision and resolve and I most<br />
certainly include you in that list, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
Indeed Prime Minister your policies on economic<br />
stabilisation, your outward-looking conduct of foreign<br />
policy, your determination to achieve political and economic<br />
reforms designed to improve national stability and<br />
efficiency are all praiseworthy and proper initiatives that<br />
can only improve the welfare of your people.<br />
And not least, I look at the vast resources of these people<br />
the men and women of Papua New Guinea themselves:<br />
resilient and courageous people who have done so much so<br />
rapidly to build a modern nation in an ancient environment.<br />
with all these advantages, mr Prime Minister and<br />
distinguished guests, you should have no doubts about Your<br />
own capacity for the delicate, difficult, demanding but<br />
exhilarating task of national development that stands ahead.<br />
And you should have no doubts that through this process<br />
Australia will stand with you as a close neighbour and firm<br />
friend. ccc </p>
