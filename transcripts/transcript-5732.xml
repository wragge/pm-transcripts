PRIME MINITE<br />
FOR M~' EDIA MONDAY, 4 JANUARY, 1982<br />
SIR WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
I would like to express my best wishes to Sir William McMahon<br />
on his retirement and to express the appreciation of the<br />
Government, the Parliament and the people of Australia for<br />
a life-time dedicated to the service of his country.<br />
Sir William retires as Father of the House after 33 years<br />
in the Parliament, 21 years of them as a Minister of the<br />
Crown, first as Minister' for the Navy and finally as<br />
Prime Minister. His application and his energy have always<br />
won the respect of his colleagues. He was a distinguished<br />
Treasurer and Foreign Minister in a career which covered<br />
seven portfolios before he was called on to lead the<br />
coalition Government in March 1971.<br />
I served with Sir William in the Ministry for six years.<br />
I have greatly valued his support over the last seven years,<br />
since I became Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party<br />
and I always appreciated his suggestions to me in the office<br />
I now hold.<br />
Sir William has served his country with dedication and his<br />
Party with loyalty. He will be greatly missed in the<br />
Parliament and in the Party room.<br />
I wish him and Lady McMahon many years of happy retirement<br />
after the responsibilities of public life. </p>
