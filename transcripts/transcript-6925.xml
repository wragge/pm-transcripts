TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT JINLING HOTEL, NANJING<br />
22 MAY 1986<br />
PM: Well, ladies and gentlemen there are probably some other<br />
matters that you wish to talk to me about but can we deal<br />
With this area first. You will recall that when General-Secretary<br />
Hu Yaobang was in Australia last year one of the areas of<br />
co-operation which we agreed should be developed was in wool<br />
and textiles and it is a matter of great pleasure and pride<br />
to me that in the period since then already three joint venture<br />
agreements in the area wool textiles have been signed. And<br />
today we have seen the signing of an agreement in regard to<br />
the wool handling store and I certainly want to thank David<br />
Asimus ( International Wool Secretariat Australian Wool Corporation)<br />
for the way in which as Chairman of the Australian Wool<br />
Corporation they picked up and worked assiduously in this<br />
area. I have with me also Vice Minister He who is the Vice<br />
Minister on the Chinese side responsible in this area. So<br />
I would like to hand over to David and Vice Minister to say<br />
a few words about developments in this area and answer any<br />
questions you may have and then once that is done, if there<br />
are any other matters you would like to talk to me about well,<br />
then I am available.<br />
ASIMUS: Well, I think the main comment from our side is that<br />
we are very pleased that this has come to fruition. China<br />
this year is now the second biggest purchaser of Australian<br />
wool something like 63 million kilograms which is about<br />
$ 260m worth so far in this wool selling season. So you can<br />
see the significance of the market here to us and the wool<br />
store if you ' like is going to be used solely for Australian<br />
wool and i t is designed to service the wool textile industry<br />
in this province, improve the efficiency of storage handling<br />
and distribution of wool and as part of that it will also<br />
serve as a base if you like for technical seminars and fit<br />
into the general pattern of co-operation we have had now for<br />
many years with the Ministry of Textile Industry in the area<br />
of raw wool processing and so on. And, of course, the other<br />
aspect that the Corporation is involved with Ministry of Textile<br />
Industry is through its position as a major shareholder in<br />
the International Wool Secreta * riat where we provide a full<br />
range of technical service of design, styling, fashion and<br />
so on. And in addition one of the achievements we are quit e<br />
pleased with and with the co-operation of Minister He we have<br />
now launched the Wool Mark in China. We have switched on for<br />
example, in Shanghai a fortnight ago,' a big neon Wool Mark </p>
<p>2<br />
sign and we are looking forward to help from the Ministry<br />
of Textile [ ndustry here to develop Wool Mark products for<br />
the home consumer market in China as well as of course assisting<br />
them with their exports. I should mention that the project<br />
is jointly funded by the Wool Corporation and the Australian<br />
Government through ADAB. It is store of, I think, 15,000 square<br />
metres capable of holding 20,000 bales of normal density or<br />
80,000 bales of high density dump wool. It will be the most<br />
modern construction available in Australia. As you know the<br />
Corporation is probably the biggest commercial warehouser<br />
in the Southern Hemisphere not just Australia. So we have<br />
some expertise in this area not only in the building and<br />
construction but also in the operation of storage like this.<br />
And it is in that technical area that we will be continuing<br />
to give some assistance for some time after the store is built.<br />
PM: Any questions you wish to address to Mr Asimus?<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the total investment of the AWC in China<br />
now? ASIMUS: Well, our ongoing expenditure both here and through<br />
this the wool store will Cost WE. estimate about $ 2m, the Chinese<br />
side of course are providing the site, filling and labour<br />
and we are providing a prefabricated structure built in<br />
Australia and to be brought here and also construction and<br />
design. Our ongoing program both individually and through<br />
IWS would be in excess of something like $ 2m a year I would<br />
estimate. JOURNALIST: Is there scope for further such facilities in<br />
China or this adequate to handle the current flow from Australia?<br />
ASIMUS: We wouldn't be planning to do this again very quickly.<br />
We would see now we would be looking to develop our relationship<br />
with China, the Ministry for Textile Industry particularly<br />
in the area of the development of the domestic market for<br />
wool products. It is certainly I think an objective of the<br />
Ministry and the Chinese Government to improve the quality<br />
of products available to the coosumer:. We through IWS and<br />
through the Corporation itself can certainly assist with that.<br />
Obviously the Chinese side see an advantage in our co-operation<br />
to the point of view of improving the quality and ability<br />
of their textile exports to compete internationally. So if<br />
you like there is a trade-off there between us. Our interest<br />
and our understanding from the Ministry is that they have<br />
undertaken that there will be an expanding. market for Australian<br />
wool consumed domestically in China. And we of course help<br />
any country that is producing wool products that is prepared<br />
to let us work in their domestic market. And the Wool Mark<br />
of course, we have got over 100 mills licenced here now in<br />
China to use the Wool Mark, full quality control facilities,<br />
ability to enter mills, inspect their products, test them<br />
for quality and so on and the full range of services that<br />
goes to a mill that is licenced. The same as we might be doing<br />
in West Germany of Japan or anywhere else. </p>
<p>PM: Is ther-e anything else in this area? Any questions for<br />
Mr Hu?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you yet spoken with Mr Fraser<br />
since he returned to Australia on the South African question<br />
and will you be meeting with him when you return to Australia?<br />
PM: I haven't spoken to him since he has returned and it<br />
is quite likely I will talk with him on my return. I have<br />
spoken once with him already in Australia earlier this year<br />
and I spoke to him by phone in Washington. I think it is very<br />
likely I would speak to him when I get back to Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe we are now facing the likelihood<br />
of a much more severe imposition of sanctions on a co-ordinated<br />
basis against South Africa?<br />
PM: Well. that has to be seen as a possibility Paul. As you<br />
know I have asked for the preparation of a Cabinet submission<br />
for early consideration upon my return and this will be one<br />
of the matters that I will be directing my attention to as<br />
soon as I get back to try and get as clear an appreciation<br />
as I possibly can of how extensive the damage is that has<br />
been done to the eminent persons group process by this devasta ting<br />
action of the South African Government. I have no doubt that<br />
there will be pressures for the sort of action that you are<br />
talking about. But I want to find out particularly is what<br />
the view of the members of the eminent persons group and the<br />
views of the front line states. It may be and I say this obviously<br />
subject to being informed directly, it may be that they still<br />
see some hope in the process which it seemed to me had been<br />
fairly well established by the work of the eminent persons<br />
group. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Australian rugby players may be going<br />
to follow the Australian cricketers to South Africa. Do you<br />
have any message for them?<br />
PM: Well, I have made it clear in the past what my view is<br />
about this area. We will not be adopting the action of<br />
dictatorial states by withdrawing passports. But I simply<br />
would say in the most friendly and constructive way that I<br />
possibly can to Australian rubgy union players that surely<br />
they must understand with the increasing bloodshed that there<br />
is in South Africa and the increasing worldwide condemnation<br />
of the abhorrent apartheid regime that it is not becoming<br />
for Australians to be associated in any way in giving aid<br />
or comfort however direct or indirect. It is running counter<br />
to the increasing welling up of world opinion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you seem to be saying that the actt( 7Av<br />
by South Africa may already have destroyed the work that theminent<br />
persons group was hoping......<br />
PM: What one must be certain of is that it has set it back<br />
very considerably. I have tried to make it clear Butch, that<br />
until one gets direct information from all sources and I would<br />
think particularly until I have the opportunity of talking </p>
<p>with Mr Fraser that you can't make a final judqement. I express<br />
I suppose the hope seeing that we were so much responsible<br />
for the initiation of a process which has grown in strength<br />
and attractiveness to a wide range of people that you don't<br />
want to see it destroyed. But I can understand that it must<br />
have been a devastating blow to many who had been prepared<br />
to invest a lot of hope in it. I remind you that when the<br />
initiative was first launched by us in the Bahamas at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting that there was some<br />
scepticism on the part of some of the front line states and<br />
certainly some expressed on behalf of the ANC. But interestingly<br />
as the process developed all the front line states and the<br />
ANC expressed their preparedness to co-operate as they did<br />
with the process. And it has become increasingly recognised<br />
as the only process now in existence which was offering some<br />
hope however slight you may judge it. There was a general<br />
recognition that it was the only hope for a possible avenue<br />
to dialogue and peaceful resolution. It will be a tragedy<br />
if by the action of the Soiith African Government that hope<br />
has been destroyed. Perhaps it hasn't been but I repeat I<br />
can't from here be definite about that until I have the opportunity<br />
of full discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you any plans to contact Mrs Thatcher<br />
directly or the other leaders of the small group controlling<br />
this eminent persons committee anid have you any comment on<br />
the attitude Mrs Thatcher has expressed?<br />
PM: My immediate plans will be to become, on my return, as<br />
thoroughly imformed about the developments as I possibly can.<br />
I will make up my mind in the light of that information as<br />
to what is the appropriate course of action for us to take.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, during your discussions with Hu Yaobang<br />
last night was the South African question raised and if so<br />
what was raised to the extent of a joint diplomatic initiative<br />
on, South Africa?<br />
PM: Well let me say this, I am genuinely not able to go to<br />
the detail of the discussions that I had with General-Secretary<br />
Hu Yaobang. I can say that at his request we are going to<br />
have further discussions tonight after the banquet. I can't<br />
go into details but I will say this no, the answer to your<br />
specific question about South Africa.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in Canberra today Mr Willis apparently<br />
said that regardless of the outcome of the June 5 meeting<br />
the Government would have to review wages policy and Senator<br />
Walsh has also said that all economic indicators point one<br />
thing and that is there must be a cut in real wages. But how<br />
to achieve it is the point of conjecture. Do you agree with<br />
the statements by both those Ministers.<br />
PM: There is certainly not a point of conjecture which I<br />
am going to pursue here in Nanjing. I will certainly be having<br />
discussions not only with these two Ministers but with all<br />
my Cabinet colleagues upon these and associated matters when<br />
I return. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I just want to ask you a question about China.<br />
Pretty radical I know. Could you just give us your impression<br />
please of this visit to China, not necessarily in a poltical<br />
sense but what you have seen?<br />
PM: Yes I will. These things firstly, I have been tremendously.<br />
pleased for Australia that the leadership of the Chinese people<br />
attaches such obvious importance to the relationship with<br />
Australia. I think it is true to say that no other country<br />
has been provided with the sort of access and opportunit.<br />
that have been given to me as Prime Minister of Australia<br />
on this trip and as I say on behalf of the people of Australia<br />
I am very appreciative of that. I think it is enormously important<br />
for Australia for the rest of this century and beyond that<br />
we can have such an obviously cordial positive constructive<br />
relationship with this large and growing country. Secondly,<br />
I have had confirmed the conviction that I have expressed<br />
as you know before coming here that what's happening in China<br />
is in my judgemnent the single most important thing that is<br />
happening in the world. There is a renewed commitment to the<br />
processes of reform and of opening up to the rest of world.<br />
A commitment which has obviously been strengthened by the<br />
success of the Sixth Five Year Plan. Now the extension of<br />
those principles into the urban economy raises enormous opportunities<br />
for growth, to raise also enormous challenges. One of the<br />
most attractive features I think of the Chinese leadership<br />
is that while they have the sense of commitment and excitement<br />
about the process of reform they are totally straight forward<br />
in acknowledging the problems that they have confronted and<br />
acknowledging the problems that they will face in the future.<br />
I would say then from that that what has been particularly<br />
gratifying as well on this visit is that I have had the opportunity<br />
of going away from Beijing out to Sichuan and now here and<br />
I have had the opportunity of seeing in action the principles<br />
and the program which have been expounded to me by the leadership.<br />
And you can see the total commitment of the leadership at<br />
all levels in China and the people with whom they are associated<br />
and I can't think of anything more exciting than to be in<br />
a country of 1 billion people undergoing the most radical<br />
transformation that you could possib-ly imagine. The great<br />
flexibility which they are exhibiting in casting aside some<br />
of the rigidities of the past, tapping the initiative of individuals<br />
and groups, giving them a capacity for decision making that<br />
they didn't have in the past to make their own decisions,<br />
to make their own mistakes if you like. Now this is releasing<br />
an enormous immeasurable reservoir of* talent., initiative and<br />
entrepreneurialship. The exciting thing about that is that<br />
no country is better placed in terms of the attitude of the<br />
Chinese leadership to be associated with that exciting development<br />
than Australia. I<br />
