    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>We’ve met again with you the heads of the three big east coast gas exporters and I want to thank you for your cooperation and the assurances, the commitments you’ve given to ensure that the east coast gas market will be supplied so the domestic gas shortage about which we were so concerned will not arise.</p>
<p>The commitment today, which you’re making is to offer sufficient gas to meet the expected shortfall and any emerging shortfall through the good faith offering of gas to the domestic market on reasonable terms.</p>
<p>These commitments are vitally important to ensure Australian jobs and to ensure Australians have affordable and reliable energy and including electricity - gas being a more important fuel than ever in the generation of electricity.</p>
<p>I want to thank you very much for those commitments and by ensuring that there will not be a shortfall of gas next year, that means we will not be required to place restrictions on exports.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for that.</p>
<p>Zoe did you want to respond?</p>
<p><strong>ZOE YUJNOVICH, SHELL AUSTRALIA COUNTRY CHAIR on behalf of QCLNG PROJECT PARTICIPANTS: </strong></p>
<p>Maybe in response just - we appreciate the constructive dialogue that we’ve had.</p>
<p>There have been some difficult and tense moments and we appreciate the challenge that you’ve given to us. </p>
<p>We hope that through the Heads of Agreement, indeed we can find a path forward to make sure that the domestic market is serviced and that indeed there is enough available gas for the market, which we stand behind and are committed to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
