TRANSCRIT OF PRESS gONFERENCE, WASHINGTON, 16 APRIL 1986<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I thought you would appreciate<br />
the opportunity of knowing in advance the contribution<br />
that Australia will be aking this afternoon in the debate<br />
in the Security Council on this issue. And we will be<br />
distrib4ting to you a copy of the statement. I have been<br />
engaged since I have been here in discussions with my<br />
colleaggs. Mr Hayden, the Foreign Minister and agreed on<br />
the position that Australia will be putting. I think it<br />
is besticaptured, if you like the approach that will be<br />
adopted in the Security Council by this sentence. " If<br />
our vor4 this week is not to be a complete failure, yet<br />
another sterile exchange without constructive end, it is<br />
necessary that all of us, members of the Council and members<br />
of the Jnited Nations, should turn our minds actively and<br />
without further delay to the discharge of our responsibilities<br />
to avoid further tensions and to bring our deliberations to a<br />
constructive conclusion". The atatement points out the<br />
wide po ers that the Security Council has under Chapter Six<br />
of the Charter. Chapter Six is that which deals with<br />
specif c settlement of disputes and they will be therefore<br />
saying to the Security Council today that we have taken it<br />
upon oarselves to ake absolutely specific recommendations<br />
as to tow within the wide range of powers delineated in<br />
Chapte Six, the Security Council should act. We are<br />
urging themselves of those powers and try to use them<br />
to sectre a peaceful reOlution of the dispute that exists.<br />
We refer to the fact that on 14 January of this year the<br />
Genera: Assembly. the full General Assembly, adopted by<br />
a resolution on measures to prevent international<br />
terror * sm and we have said it was absolutely necessary that<br />
Libya ust binding commitment to and discharge of those<br />
commit ena not to resort further to acts of international<br />
terror La and in those circumstances a reciprocal commitment<br />
from t e United States not to have further resort to force.<br />
Now. l dies and gentlemen, that is the essential thrust of<br />
the contribution that Mr Woolcott will be masking on behalf<br />
of my Government in the debate in the Security Council this<br />
afternoon. As I say, copies of that statement are available.<br />

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you any reason to believe that<br />
the Unit d States will support the Australian initiative?<br />
PM: Well let me say this, that the President, in announcing<br />
his act ion, invoked section 51 of the, Article 51 of the<br />
Charter which Article is in these terms, and are very relevant<br />
to your question. It says that nothing in the present charter<br />
shall i pair the rights, individually or collectively of<br />
member cations, to take action in self-defence. But it goes<br />
on to s: y that until the Security Council has taken measures<br />
necessa y to maintain international peace and security. So<br />
the vet) section 51, which has been properly referred to by<br />
the Unit ed States itself, logically goes on to the responsibility<br />
of the security Council. taken those measures, which as 1<br />
say, ar delineated in Chapter 6 to proceed then to a<br />
peacefu resolution of the dispute.<br />
JOURNAL ST: Prime Minister, in pratical terms, what happens<br />
if the IN picks up on our initiative. What machinery then<br />
goes into operation?<br />
PM: We0l1, you will see that when read Chapter 6, and particularl<br />
the firpt article 33, that they indicate a range of methods that<br />
are available. Let me refer to them it says the parties<br />
to any dispute, the continuation of which is likely to<br />
endanger the maintenance o f international peace and security<br />
shall first of all seek a solution by, and then they mention<br />
methods of negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation,<br />
arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies<br />
or arrangements or other peaceful means of their own choice.<br />
So that! is why you will find that in the statement that I<br />
have authorised to be made to the Security Council, we don't<br />
deem to! take it upon ourselves this is the particular way<br />
which the Security Council should use the powers that are<br />
designated. It is appropriate that the members of the Council<br />
should jeddress themselves to the provisions of Chapter 6, dealing<br />
with the specific settlement of disputes, and after debate<br />
and discussion, choose that particular method which, to them,<br />
seems most appropriate in the circumstances.<br />
JOURNAIIST: Have we sounded this out with the American<br />
OovernIent informally?<br />
PM N The American Government will have be provided with<br />
a copy of what we are going to say. But I want to make it<br />
clear hot we believe, have believed, from the moment I made<br />
the st temeout in the Australian Parliament that the basic<br />
oblige ion on us and on all like-minded members of the<br />
international community is now to concentrate on seeking<br />
a pe ceful method of the resolution of the dispute. That<br />
should be the pra-eminent thought of all parties. And<br />
consis ently with the statement that I made in the Parliament,<br />
my Oov rnument is now pursuing that same thrust in the Security<br />
Counci We believe that it isa course of action which<br />
should recommend itself not merely to the parties immediately<br />
involv d, but to all members of the United Nations.<br />
specific suggestion@, why should it be<br />
taken eriously?<br />

PM: Well, it would presumptuous for us to say that we know<br />
exactly th
are mentioned in the charter. We want to take the initiative<br />
if you lik
we are say: ng that we stand ready with other members of the<br />
Security Council, and with co-operation with the SEcratary-<br />
General tolparticipate in those ways. We don't presume to<br />
say that we know, by putting ourselves in the minds of all<br />
members, what particular method would best recommend itself<br />
to the Security Council amongst the range of alternatives<br />
that are mntioned in Chapter 6.<br />
JOURNALISTi Can you say explicitly whether you think the<br />
United Steae was wrong to take the military action that it<br />
did. And secondly, will you be asking President Reagan not<br />
to take any further military action against Libya even if<br />
its diplomats and facilities abroad are attacked?<br />
PM; The p sition of the Australian Government is made quite<br />
clear in theN Parliament and in this statement. We have indicated<br />
the fact that there is a very considerable body of evidence<br />
which establishes that Libya has been involved in the direction<br />
and support of international terrorism against innocent<br />
civilians ' including Americans. And that was deplored. And<br />
we have indicated that we understand that in those circumstances<br />
why the reaction has taken place. But we, in fact, are saying<br />
that the use of force is not going to resolve this issue. And<br />
that is what we are saying and we are not going to be, as I<br />
said in my' departure from Australia, I am not going to be put<br />
into some squalid auction of levels of support for or against<br />
particular positions because that may help you to write a<br />
headline. 1 It doesn't help to resolve the dispute. And that<br />
is what we are about.<br />
JOURNALISI: Mr Hawks, what did Mr Hayden mean yesterday when<br />
he said tIat Australia was willing to play a mediating role<br />
in the dispute between<br />
PM: No, that position has been reflected in the statement that<br />
we are together authorising and will be made by Mr Woolcott<br />
in the Seurity Council. and that is Australia doesn't seek<br />
itself totake on specifically a role of mediator. What we<br />
do insist though, as I have said, we regard ourselves as<br />
having a 1rime responsibility as a nation, our prime responsibility<br />
as a nation is to put in the Security Council the pre-eminence of<br />
positive 4pproache. to settling this dispute. And we are saying<br />
that we sqand ready as a member of the Security Council to,<br />
and tha U ited Nations, we stand ready to play our role along<br />
with othess. We don't seek a special role for ourselves.<br />
JOURNALIS t Prime Minister, having drawn attention, or having<br />
about to draw attention of the Security Council to Chapter 6<br />
and all t ose various alternatives, does Australia have a<br />
favoured osaition, when the debate starts what are we going<br />
to say? fre vWe going to say 9/<br />

PM: We ar, going to say what I have said here, and you will<br />
see when y , u read the statements that my observations or<br />
synthesis . f it, if you like, accurately reflects what is there.<br />
And that i that we don't think, it would be presumptuous to<br />
say in adv tce, this is the best way. We say here are a range<br />
of options that are available, mentioned in ARticle 33. Let's<br />
as members of the Security Council, address ourselves to the<br />
issue in terms of the available options. And we would find<br />
ourselves informed by that discussion and debate. What we<br />
want to doA and what we think we have the obligation to do,<br />
is to say get the focus right. We are not concerned about<br />
trying to dwell upon the past, but to say look the way through<br />
is by looking to Chapter 6 and all of us addressing our minds<br />
to the obligation which the Charter imposes upon us all to<br />
look to that method. And I remind you, as I have said, that<br />
Article 51', which has been invoked, by its very language, refers<br />
back to that obligation.<br />
I<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, among those options would you see any<br />
merit in t'ho Security Council setting up a small group of<br />
nations to' actively try to find some route to settlement.<br />
PH: If that appears from the discussion as the most likely<br />
way. I mean, it is pointless trying to say in advance that<br />
this is the best way. You have got to get the feel of the<br />
people involved, see what may recommend itself as the most<br />
likely method. This is why Article 33 doesn't say look here<br />
is the wa. bacausa they recognise that different disputes are<br />
likely to lend themselves to different methods of resolution.<br />
And so you need to be there to be part of the debate, the feeling.<br />
the view of people as to what particular method would be the<br />
most appropriate. If that particular method was the one that<br />
emerged, then certainly we would see that as appropriate. And if<br />
it were t e wish of those involved, Australia would stand ready<br />
to play whatever part was asked of it. We seek not to impose<br />
ourselveslupon the Security Council as the mediator. But what<br />
we do insist upon is our right, and what ve believe is our<br />
obligation to put before the Security Council, the collective<br />
responsibility of that body under the Charter now to find<br />
a peacefuI resolution of this matter.<br />
JOURNALIS~ t Do you think the United States might find it<br />
presumptuous of Australia to suggest mediation in the first<br />
place. PM: I cso't see that the United States, or anyone for that<br />
matter, a n find it presumptuous that where Section 51 has<br />
been Invo ad that Australia or anyone else should point out<br />
the logic l implications. If you look at Section 51 it takes<br />
you straipht back to Chapter 6.<br />
JOURNALIS: Prime Minister, you have seen the evidence as I<br />
undorstan you have had long experience negotiating, do you<br />
believe It is possible for the United States to negotiate<br />
with Gadd fi. a man that the President has called a madman.<br />

PH: You v 11 see, let ms len, so to the particular section of<br />
the contri ution that we will be making, which I think picks up<br />
your point Where our Ambassador to the United Nations will<br />
be develop ng the points I have made, he says " I do not necessarily<br />
wish to ma e firm proposals as to the exact method" as I have<br />
been sayin here, that the Council itself might employ. But<br />
we identif a number of relevant points. And there is this<br />
observatio " Finally, Mr President, I note that the parties<br />
themselves could bring the dispute to a speedy end<br />
by making and strictly observing genuine and binding commitments<br />
to the Security Council about their future conduct. These<br />
commitments would include. on the one hand, a pledge concerning<br />
the strictest respect for and adherence to the terms of UNCA<br />
resolution 40/ 61,' that is one to which I have referred, of January<br />
of this year, " whichunequivocally condemns terrorism and calls<br />
on all stIteoe to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting<br />
or partic pating in terrorist acts. They would include on<br />
the other and a reciprocal commitment to refrain from recourse<br />
to armed force. The Council could examine urgently how such<br />
commitmentj might be undertaken by the present parties and by<br />
all states concerned". So you can see what has been saidthere<br />
is that it would be appropriate to expect a readiness to<br />
negotiate apd to involve itself in such discussions on the<br />
part of the United States in a situation where that binding<br />
commitment were given by Libya.<br />
JOURNALISTJ Sir, your aides are quoted here by Radio Australia<br />
as saying that Libya and the United States might be persuaded<br />
to 5egotia~ e through the auspices of an acceptable intermediary.<br />
My questiok is. why would Libya consider Australia to be an<br />
acceptable intermediary?<br />
PH: Well,. there is a total lack of logic if I may say so in<br />
your quest on because we are not saying that we are maying<br />
that we ar the acceptable intermediary.<br />
I made it $ uite clear in what I have said here, it is in this<br />
statement. And neither is there any implication in that that<br />
we are the acceptable intermediary. I don't why you jumped to<br />
that concl ldon.<br />
JOURNALIBT: Prime Minister, if ve were asked by the UN Security<br />
Council to act as a mediator, would your Government accept that?<br />
PM: We have got some rules that travel well across the ocean<br />
about not aeverin$ hypothetical questions, but in this case<br />
I am prepared to add to what I have said before. And that is<br />
that we vill be saying In the statement that we stand reedy<br />
to play a role, any role, that is asked of us by the United<br />
Nations, through the security Council, in its consideration<br />
of the matter. We are not saying that we are any more appropriate<br />
than auyoee else, But as a nation which has consistently confirmed<br />
the centr lity of the peaceful resolution of international<br />
disputes, we stand ready to play a part vit h others, if asked.<br />
We don't oek to elevate ourselves to some position of primacy<br />
in this matter. We will do whatever is asked of us. But where<br />
we do as&amp; rt a position, and as Ambassador Woolcott will be today,<br />
is to say It Is absolutely essential that the Security Council<br />
now direc s its attention to the future to see how we can remove<br />

oI mr Hawks, you came here to talk about trade.<br />
Is this Li yen taking up valuable time and do you think<br />
this is go ng to affect those trade discussions at all?<br />
PM: It is obviously valuable time that has been involved,<br />
but I want, to emphasise and I appreciate the question very<br />
much Greg I want to emphasis* that we've bought a very<br />
substantia body of experts and officials ( they are not<br />
mutually * ealusive, you know) with us. And we also have here<br />
in Washington people who have been working on those issues.<br />
That work has bean continuing through this We will be<br />
in a positrion to be totally well equipped to deal with what<br />
you rightly say is the major purpose of our visit here. There<br />
will be no; interference with, or diminution of, the work that<br />
is to be d'one on that major purpose of the visit.<br />
JOURNALISi: Do you think that job would be made easier if<br />
Australia was more overtly supportive of the US position on the<br />
Libyan attack?<br />
PMt I don't think anyone would respect, including the United<br />
States. would respect us if we formulated positions in regard<br />
to issues if we said what we thought they would like to hear.<br />
And in a argaining framework the United States accepts what<br />
is the fact that we are a good friend and a reliable ally<br />
under the! relationship and the commitments which found it.<br />
And ve will make a statement and adopt a position which we<br />
regard as correct. I have done that from the moment that I made<br />
the state; ent in the Parliament and it is also reflected in the<br />
statement to be made to the Security Council. The positions<br />
that we wtll be putting to the United States in regard to<br />
the issue of agricultural trade stand in their own right. We<br />
have a compalling case to put. And one which I believe will<br />
be unders ood and I would hope acted upon sympathetically by<br />
the Unite States.<br />
JOURNALIS Prime Minister initiative that is being put<br />
it i a f irly obvious solution, I suppose, and it might have<br />
occurred lo some other country to approach the United Nations...<br />
Given the work load that you already have on your plate the<br />
problems of agricultural trade why do you feel it necessary for<br />
Australia to raise at the Security Council given the nature of it<br />
PM: When you are a member of the Security Council we sought to<br />
Ve, we are that membership gives you responsibilities. We<br />
don't say., well, we sought to become a member of the Security<br />
Council so we can walk around the world and say, look, how<br />
clever we are. We got elected to the Security Council.<br />
Meubership of the Security Council gives you obligations,<br />
imposes ociligations upon you. We vill discharge them.<br />
JOURNALI&amp; T: But the Government has copped some criticism the<br />
loreign binister has copped some criticism for attempting to find<br />
solution1, for example, the Cambodian situation.<br />
