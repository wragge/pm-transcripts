BROADCAST: 3HA-No. 96<br />
3YB-11 Nov. 1976<br />
FOR PRESS 7 NOVEMBER 1976<br />
ELECTORATE. TALK<br />
Two reports of immense significance the Fraser Island Report<br />
and the Fox Report on uranium development have turned the<br />
spotlight on the Government's attitude towards the Australian<br />
environment. This spotlight is welcome.<br />
It is a very healthy and encouraging sign when the strong views<br />
of special interest groups and the public at large can be<br />
debated in an open and responsible manner. I hope this<br />
trend continues.<br />
It would be unfortunate for the community if views of<br />
environmental issues became so emotional and heated that reason<br />
and debate gave way to public disturbance. If this were to<br />
happen,+ thcse views would certainly lose credibility. The cause<br />
behind those views would not be helped it. would in fact<br />
be immensely harmed.<br />
The Government's stand on the environment is clear. We<br />
recognise the quality of the environment is crucial for this<br />
and future generations of Australians. There is much greater<br />
understand-ing and concern for the natural environment now<br />
than ten or fifteen years ago. There are many more people<br />
aware of the care that we ought to show, and I think, increasingly<br />
are coming to show, in relation to the natural environment.<br />
People understand that many parts of this and other countries<br />
have been polluted and destroyed because man has not recognised<br />
his own potential for environmental damage.<br />
The Australian Government recognises that in a world of rapid<br />
population growth and a world with severe problems of disease<br />
and hunger Australia must accept -responsibilities in the<br />
global context. In other words, the demands of conservation<br />
must be balanced with those of development.<br />
Our commitment to the environment has been translated into<br />
po sitive action in the eleven months since we were elected to<br />
government. We promised to promote community involvement and<br />
responsibility in the environment issues. This meant that where<br />
development projects were likely to have a damaging effect on<br />
the environment, special impact statements would be prepared<br />
before Government decisions were taken. / 2 </p>
<p>We promised to support the public role of approved voluntary<br />
organisations and to publicise environmental issues. We<br />
undertook to improve consultation b-, tween industry and<br />
government in this field, and promised the preservation of the<br />
national estate.<br />
I want to outline some of our specific achievements. Our concern<br />
for the national estate is evidenced by our support of the<br />
Australian Heritage Commission. This Commission has the<br />
responsible task of compiling a register of the national estate,<br />
in which a record of sites, buildings, and natural areas of<br />
national importance is being made. This is ongoing work.<br />
National trust organisations in each State have been allocated<br />
grants and conservation organisations have also received<br />
government financial suppor-t.<br />
The Government has also established the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park Authority. This park area is within the boundaries<br />
o f the tip of Cape York Peninsula to Fraser Island.<br />
The Great Barrier Reef is undoubtedly unique the focal point<br />
of an exciting marine world.<br />
The Government also promised to support the Australian National<br />
Parks and Wildlife Service and to assist in establishing a<br />
national park of world significance in South West Tasmania.<br />
The Government also undertook to observe in letter and spirit<br />
the Environment Protection Act.<br />
This Act is the legislative basis on which the Government ensures<br />
that environmental factors are taken into account before reaching<br />
decisions on proposals that could affect the environment.<br />
The Act was passed when we were in Opposition, but it received<br />
our full support.<br />
As I indicated earlier the issues that have been most prominent<br />
in the environment field in recent weeks have been Fraser Island<br />
and the mining of uranium. The Government is considering reports<br />
from these two independent inquiries which carried out exhaustive<br />
examinations of these questions.<br />
Fraser Island is an area of unique beauty. The Government fully<br />
recognises its responsibility to make sure this part of our<br />
national heritage is not lost to future generations. lWe recognise<br />
the fragility of the environment of Fraser Island. We recognise<br />
it needs protection. At the same time we are conscious that a<br />
Dumber of people are dependent for their livelihood on the<br />
Fraser Island mining operations Obviously the Government's decision,<br />
on this important question will not be supported by all sections<br />
of the community.<br />
We must, however, take decisions that will be to the lasting<br />
advantage of the entire community. As to the uranium question,<br />
there has already been many opportunities for all interested<br />
groups within the community to put their-views. In addition, there<br />
will be a debatC on tL-he contents of the first report of the Fox<br />
Commission in the National Parliament fairly shortly. At this point<br />
it would not be fair of me to comlent any further on the ' report,<br />
particularly as the Commission has yet to bring down a further<br />
report. / 13 </p>
<p>3.<br />
The Government's track record on environmental issues<br />
is strong. We have shown that we are firmly committed<br />
to the preservation of our national heritage. We have shown<br />
our desire to ensure that all Australians are able to<br />
enjoy a high standard of living.<br />
