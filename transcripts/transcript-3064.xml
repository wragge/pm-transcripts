STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER ANDT MINISTER<br />
AFFAIRS, 1-UWWHi ITLAM~, ON HIS= PLTRN<br />
CHINA AND JAPAN, 5NOVEMBR= 1973.<br />
" Within the next few days I shall be reporting to the<br />
Australian Parliament on the results of my visit to China and<br />
Japan. I believe this visit, in the company of several of my<br />
ministerial colleagues, was the most successful and productive<br />
overseas mission ever undertaken by an Australian Government<br />
delegation. We have forged new understandings with two of our<br />
greatest neighbours with Japan, our most important trading<br />
partner, and with China, the most populous nation in the world.<br />
With both countries we have redefined our relationship<br />
to the benefit of both sides and set new perspectives that will<br />
endure for years to come.<br />
Our basic task in Japan was not an easy one. Essentially<br />
it was to explain to the Japanese Government that in the development<br />
of our minerals and energy reso'Urces Australia in future will be<br />
the master of her own house. We will not allow the present<br />
proportion of foreign ownership and control of these resources<br />
to increase. In Tokyo we made this position quite clear. The<br />
Japanese understood it. They accepted it. At the same time we<br />
reassured Japan that Australia would never deny Japan access to the<br />
raw materials she needs, We will remain a dependable supplier.<br />
That position, too, was understood and welcomed.<br />
I did not go to Japan to carp or complain, as the Leader<br />
of the Opposition did, about Japan's defence spending or internal<br />
policies. I did not go, as Mr ' 2nedden did, to incite Japan to a<br />
resurgence of militarism. I went to seek new friendship and<br />
understanding. </p>
<p>A 6<br />
The fruits of that understanding will be embodied in a<br />
lasting treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two<br />
countries. For years the Japanese Government sought such a<br />
treaty with Australia. The previous Australian Government refused<br />
to conclude such a treaty. We have now cleared the way for o<br />
negotiations on the Treaty of Nara to begin without delay.<br />
As an example of the kind of cooperation that will flow<br />
from our better relationship, Senator Wriedt obtained most<br />
encouraging indications of Japan's willingness to make long-term<br />
arrangements for the purchase of our primary products, especially<br />
wool. I am confident that such arrangements will bring benefits<br />
to both countries. My visit to China was the first ever made by an<br />
Australian Prime Minister. It brought great practical benefits<br />
to Australia as well as great personal satisfaction to me.<br />
It marked the end of a generation of neurotic fears and<br />
lost opportunities. Australia has now established a firm and<br />
cordial friendship with a government representing a quarter of the<br />
earth's population. That friendship, I believe, will be lasting<br />
and fruitful. As a result of my extraordinarily long and thorough<br />
discussions with Premier Chou En-lai, Chairman Mao Tse-tung and<br />
other Chinese leaders, the Australian Government now has a much<br />
better knowledge of Chinese attitudes to a whole range of world<br />
problems. Such knowledge is essential to the conduct of a mature,<br />
confident and constructive Australian foreign policy.<br />
We are no longer working in the dark. China knows what we<br />
think. We know what China thinks. On many issues such as nuclear<br />
tests, the Middle East, Bangladesh and Korea we frankly<br />
acknowledged and fully explained our differences.<br />
On many practical issues we made great progress.<br />
Dr Patterson secured Chinese agreement to important long-term<br />
contracts for the sale of sugar to China. This arrangement may well<br />
prove to be the biggest commodity deal Australia has made with </p>
<p>-3-<br />
another country. It follows the highly valuable wheat contract<br />
with China concluded recently by Dr Cairns.<br />
I believe we are now entering a more enlightened and<br />
productive era in our relations with China. I believe the great<br />
foundations of friendship and cooperation we have laid on this<br />
visit will stand for years to come. </p>
