PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
' GROUP OF 100'<br />
SYDNEY 1 OCTOBER 1987<br />
David Say<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen-<br />
The advent of the Group of 100 onto the national sce * ne is to<br />
be welcomed by all who care for Australia's economic health.<br />
The organisations which make up this Group be they<br />
privately or publicly owned represent a major component of<br />
the nation's economic activity.<br />
So it is a pleasure to address and to open this first<br />
national conference of the Group of 100. I look forward to<br />
hearing of the results of your deliberations not only at<br />
this conference but at future conferences.'<br />
one of the hallmarks of my Government has been its<br />
determination to seek the active contribution of all groups<br />
in the community including business groups such as this<br />
to the task of Government decision-making. We have never<br />
believed that Government has a monopoly either of experience<br />
or of wisdom.<br />
As David Say, your President, said in his introductory<br />
co ' mments, we must seek a -cooperative approach to the<br />
resolution of the serious economic problems we face.<br />
The virtue of such cooperation lies ultimately in its<br />
recognition of the fact of our mutual dependence and this<br />
is particularly true in an economy of relatively small size<br />
like Australia.<br />
I want to come later to the details of Australia's domestic<br />
economic situation. Let me say at the outset however that<br />
the successes we as a nation ' have so far enjoyed in meeting<br />
the considerable economic challenges we face have been<br />
attributable in no small measure to our recognition of our<br />
interdependence and to our capacity to cooperate.<br />
Through working together we have advanced the interests not<br />
only of individual groups, but of the community as a whole. t U </p>
<p>The recognition of our mutual dependence is just as<br />
important on the international scene.<br />
I had the pleasure in January of delivering the keynote<br />
address to the World Economic Forum at Davos. David Say, I<br />
know, was among the audience. My message on that occasion<br />
was that unless nations recognised their complete<br />
interdependence they risked returning to the economic<br />
insanities of the pre-1939 years with the added danger<br />
that in the nuclear age the consequences of conflict would<br />
be truly horrendous.<br />
The debt crisis and the commodity price slump demonstrate<br />
that the poverty or prosperity of individual nations are<br />
questions that concern us all.<br />
I told the audience at Davos that successful leadership<br />
today required two closely related commitments. Though my<br />
prescriptions were directly chiefly at governments they have<br />
considerable relevance to the business sector.<br />
First, Governments must show their willingness to<br />
restructure their own economies, with the way being led by<br />
the developed countries.<br />
Second, Governments must be committed to the development of--<br />
free and fair international trade.<br />
Good domestic policy and good international policy are<br />
inseparable.<br />
The implications for business are also clear. Without the<br />
cooperation of business, without its willingness to take<br />
advantage of the opportunities which ' open trade and economic<br />
reconstruction can bring, the best efforts of governments<br />
will be ineffective.<br />
I believe we in Australia are being successful in making the<br />
appropriate domestic adjustments. Although this enormously<br />
complex task is far from complete, we are already beginning<br />
to achieve an improved economic performance.<br />
our successful approach has also lent credibility to our<br />
efforts in international forums to turn back the tide of<br />
protectionism which threatens not only the trade in<br />
agricultural products, in which we have an immediate stake,<br />
but also the whole trading system on which the prosperity of<br />
the world depends.<br />
If I may refer once more to my Davos address, I said that<br />
nations which seek to achieve domestic political goals<br />
through distorting the international trading framework are<br />
deluding and hurting themselves while they are also hurting<br />
others. I will shortly be travelling overseas and I will make use of<br />
the opportunity presented by this trip to reinforce this<br />
basic argument in a number of forums. 4 &amp;-1 </p>
<p>3.<br />
In San Diego I will be addressing the American-Australian<br />
Chamber of Commerce on my concern about the prospect for<br />
Australian exports in view of the growing protectionist<br />
sentiment in the United States.<br />
At the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Vancouver<br />
I will be discussing trade reform with Heads of Government<br />
from a diverse range of Commonwealth countries, many of whom<br />
share Australia's concern about the world trade system.<br />
Indeed I have been asked to lead off the CliOGM debate on<br />
world economic issues.<br />
in Geneva, I will be addressing GATT members on the progress<br />
of the agricultural protection initiative I launched at<br />
Davos. Later in the year, ' at a valuable regional forum to which I<br />
have been invited, I will discuss the future of Australia's<br />
political and economic links, including trade, with the<br />
crucial Pacific Rim economies.<br />
In the US, at CHOGM, in Europe, and in our own region, our<br />
message is consistent and it is forceful.<br />
Restrictive and distorting trading practices those already<br />
implemented and those in prospect ultimately serve 4<br />
no-one's interests. All countries would gain from a move<br />
towards fairer competition in international markets.<br />
A good many of the impediments to fair trade have been<br />
prompted by hasty and negative responses to bilateral<br />
concerns. I will be stressing that a more positive and<br />
beneficial response is available through multilateral<br />
solutions to such problems.<br />
Australia has consistently stressed and worked towards this<br />
goal in the context of the new MTN round. We took a leading<br />
role in establishing the Cairns Group as a new third force<br />
in negotiations, which led at Punta del Este to agriculture<br />
being put for the first time on the MTN agenda as a matter<br />
of priority.<br />
GATT is crucially concerned with questions of fair and open<br />
world trade and has championed this cause throughout its<br />
yearexistence. The shortcomings of the world trading<br />
system today should not in my view be blamed on GATT.<br />
Rather they have resulted from the selfish approach of some<br />
of its members.<br />
Australia is a smoll country and therefore has limited power<br />
In the world economy. Forums such as those I will be<br />
addressing provide us with great opportunities to put our<br />
view on the need for reform of the world trading system, and<br />
to marshal those forces with similar interests and<br />
objectives. But I will be emphasising in these forums that multilateral<br />
trade reform is not enough. Domestic economies must also be<br />
restructured. 0( 01t) </p>
<p>4.<br />
As far as Australia is concerned, the domestic economy has<br />
seen a more fundamental reorientation over the last few<br />
years than it has in any time since its emergence from the<br />
Second World war.<br />
Australia had been too complacent in the post-war period.<br />
We relied on primary commodity exports, we protected an<br />
inward looking and inefficient manufacturing base, and we<br />
ignored the potential of our neighbours in the Western<br />
Pacific Rim.<br />
The fragility of such an approach was highlighted in 1985<br />
and 1986 by the massive' collapse in our terms of trade.<br />
A sustained effort is needed to reduce our reliance on the<br />
production and export of primary commodities. The community<br />
business, unions and the Government must work together<br />
to reconstruct the Australian economy to take us in<br />
prosperity to the end of the century and beyond.<br />
This task must build on the strengths of the Australian<br />
economy: our skilled workforce; our rich natural resource<br />
base; our well developed infrastructure; our political<br />
stability; and our proximity to the world's most dynamic<br />
growth area, the Western Pacific Rim.<br />
It has been to realise the full potential of these strengths<br />
that my Government has directed its economic decision-making<br />
since our election in March 1983.<br />
We are steadily eliminating protection, encouraging<br />
manufacturers to innovate and to compete on the world<br />
market. We have striven to ensure,' with the cooperation of<br />
the trade union movement, that unit labor costs move broadly<br />
in line with those of our principal trading partners. We<br />
are encouraging newer ways, smarter ways, cheaper ways, more<br />
efficient ways, of earning our national income.<br />
Just as important, we are also providing the broad<br />
macro-economic framework which is necessary. In addition to<br />
wages moderation it has been crucial to-deliver sustained<br />
restraint in budgetary policy and appropriately tight<br />
monetary policy.<br />
We have sought to emulate private sector efficiency<br />
improvements, streamlining the public service to parallel<br />
more closely the performance of efficient private sector<br />
bureaucracies. moreover we are looking closely at the<br />
operations of our major public enterprises to see how their<br />
performance can be improved.<br />
Last May, the Treasurer delivered an Economic Statement<br />
which contained the toughest expenditure cutting exercise in<br />
years. This, and the tax reform policies which we<br />
adopted in our second term, allowed us to all but balance<br />
the Budget for 1987-88. 0 0 t 53 G </p>
<p>This is a substantial achievement. We have trimmed<br />
$ 10,000 million from the prospective Budget deficit which we<br />
inher -ited from our predecessors in just five Budgets. It<br />
compares very favourably indeed with the recent fiscal<br />
performance of other developed economies.<br />
The broad Budget aggregates suggest a fiscal climate in the<br />
years ahead which will complement the task of restructuring.<br />
We have cut real outlays for the second year in a rowthe<br />
first time this has been achieved in 35 years.<br />
Decisions already taken-on recurrent outlays will<br />
produce cuts next year which are at least as large as<br />
this year.<br />
Tax will be a significantly lower share of GDP this year<br />
than last; andI<br />
For the first time in 35 years the Commonwealth will<br />
this year be retiring both domestic and overseas debt<br />
each to the tune of about $ 1000 million.<br />
I cannot stress enough that the Budget outcome is not a<br />
one-off or chance occurrence. It is a further step along<br />
the consistent path of responsible macro-economic management<br />
that my Government has followed since March 1983. Largely<br />
as a result, interest rates are beginning to fall.<br />
For those of you who operate in the corporate environment<br />
and face the disciplines of the market, our approach offers<br />
further confirmation that the Government's macro-economic<br />
policy is predictable and stable. This is one of the most<br />
important contributions a Government can giake to the<br />
economy, allowing business to plan investment decisions with<br />
confidence. As a measure of the extent to which Australia is<br />
successfully meeting the challenge of reconstruction, we are<br />
now beginning to witness a turnaround in our current account<br />
and trading performance. The current account deficit has<br />
declined from 6 per cent of GDP in 1985-86 to 5 per cent<br />
last year, and we expect a further fall to 4 per cent in<br />
1987-88.<br />
But to get a real impression of the adjustment which has<br />
occurred already, one needs to look beyond these aggregates.<br />
In 1984-85, Australia had a goods and services deficit in<br />
constant prices of 2.6 per cent of GDP.* Last year we turned<br />
that into a surplus of 2.4 per cent and this year we expect<br />
this surplus to increase to 4 per cent.<br />
Particularly gratifying is the large increase in<br />
manufacturing exports, reflecting the improved<br />
competitiveness of our manufacturing sector. 0 I 5-3 7 </p>
<p>6.<br />
This growth has been so strong that exports from the<br />
manufacturing and tourism sectors now account for virtually<br />
one quarter of exports, compared to only one fifth just one<br />
year ago.<br />
Although we have a long way to go to solve our external<br />
problems, it is clear that we have turned the corner.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
David Say was kind enough to give me advance notice of what<br />
he had in mind to say in his introductory comments. Let me<br />
at this point, David, take issue with one of your remarks in<br />
your kind introduction.<br />
You mentioned that Australia has two major disadvantagesthe<br />
small size of its market and its remoteness from the<br />
major markets of the US an'd Europe.<br />
of course both of those descriptions are true. But they are<br />
nothing like the impediments that they once were as so<br />
many companies, especially as many of the smaller companies<br />
which I have visited, are only too willing to attest.<br />
The reality is that Australian manufacturing is now more<br />
competitive abroad than it has been since at least 1973.<br />
Even John Elliott has been moved to comment: " The ending of<br />
a fixed exchange rate saw the dollar fall to a level where<br />
tremendous opportunities have opened up in new<br />
manufacturing."<br />
At a time when freight rates are so sharply compressed, it<br />
is hard to imagine a time when Australia has had a better<br />
opportunity to break out of the confines of its small market<br />
and take on the mass markets of Europe and the USA, where<br />
our competitive gain has been particularly strong..<br />
However, even that proposition bears further analysis<br />
essentially because of its Atlantic-centred view of the<br />
wo rl1d.<br />
There has been a clear shift of economic power over recent<br />
years towards the Pacific basin. if there is one statistic<br />
which encapsulates that fact it is that in 1984, for the<br />
first time, the value of trade across the Pacific exceeded<br />
that across the Atlantic.<br />
The countries of the Pacific Rim include the world's two<br />
major economic powers the United States and what must<br />
become an increasingly import-oriented Japan. They also<br />
include one of the world's most rapidly growing and populous<br />
countries China and an array of developing countries of<br />
diverse size but grpwing economic strength.<br />
Each of these countries is undergoing profound economic and,<br />
in many cases, social change. They are changes which over<br />
time can provide Australian business with outstanding<br />
oppo . rtunities for trade and growth. 0( 0i)-~ 33 </p>
<p>The Government is doing what it can to provide the right<br />
environment for business at home, to encourage other nations<br />
to speed up the necessary process of economic reconstruction<br />
which they have to undertake, and to open previously<br />
insulated economies to imports from Australia.<br />
But in the end it will come down to the foresight and the<br />
entrepreneurship of Australian business to determine how<br />
well we perform.<br />
It is clear that profitable opportunities will increasingly<br />
become available for those bold enough to seek them out.<br />
Yet it will require hard work to exploit those<br />
opportunities. Specific projects have to be identified.<br />
Distribution outlets have to be estab~ lished where none now<br />
exist and a marketing strategy has to be developed and<br />
promoted all of which require the investment of management<br />
talent and financial resources.<br />
The commitment required is not transitory and it needs to<br />
involve the whole of the enterprise.<br />
It will take time to build up trade in new areas and we will<br />
have to learn to cope with the vagaries of floating exchange<br />
rates and the other hazards of trading.<br />
That is not just a task for management. It is one for<br />
workers also. We simply have to be prepared to look at how<br />
we do things now, to see what changes are necessary to meet<br />
today's environment and to make those changes.<br />
Moreover that is a task which we need to address constantly.<br />
If we cannot remain adaptable we consign ourselves to the<br />
class of the also-rans. I<br />
Let me say that I beli eve that attitudes are changing and<br />
that Australians have understood the message of the past<br />
couple of years.<br />
As I implied earlier I see it in the actions of medium and<br />
small companies across the breadth of Australia who are now<br />
exporting, perhaps for the first time, and who are<br />
developing new products and new markets.<br />
I see it in the quiet revolution taking place in the<br />
attitudes of trade unions to training and retraining, to the<br />
reform of work and management practices, and to the need for<br />
continued wages moderation.<br />
I see it in their willingness to acknowledge the need for<br />
change and to work with management to achieve it.<br />
I see it also in the willingness of companies to undertake<br />
research and development, assisted by the most generous tax<br />
concessions in the world. And I see it in the lift in<br />
investment which has begun, especially investment for trade<br />
related activities. 0 0) t -j 3 </p>
<p>It. has been clear sinceour re-election on July 11 that<br />
while we are not going to relax our efforts on the<br />
macro-economic plane to restructure the economy we will be<br />
concentrating closely in our third term of office on the<br />
search for efficiencies in the micro-economy.<br />
We have identified a full agenda of reform in a number of<br />
areas, including transport and aviation; communications;<br />
government-owned business enterprises; education and<br />
training; and industry policy, including assistance,<br />
taxation and regulation.<br />
Let me say a little today about developments in the last, of<br />
these areas, industry policy.<br />
The next three years will see a continuation of Labor's<br />
efforts to lower gradually the levels of industry<br />
protection.<br />
We cannot, as a nation, hope to be internationally<br />
competitive if. we persist in insulating key industries from<br />
import competition. Indeed, as I said at Davos, the overly<br />
protective approach of the past is a primary cause of the<br />
difficulties facing our manufacturing sector today.<br />
The tax system clearly will play a vital role in the<br />
restructuring process.<br />
Tax reform, as you know, has been a major emphasis of the<br />
Government. We need to be sure, however, that the corporate<br />
tax system remains as efficient and as internationally<br />
competitive as possible.<br />
This is why we have begun a review to identify options to<br />
cut the company tax rate through a sensible broadening of<br />
the company income tax base. This is in line with similar<br />
recent reforms in a number of major western economies<br />
including the United States and Britain. our objective is<br />
to ensure that Australian companies can compete on equal<br />
terms.<br />
At this early stage I obviously cannot comment in detail<br />
about any specific changes. But I can assure you that any<br />
tax changes which flow from the review will be fair,<br />
fiscally responsible and aimed at increasing Australia's<br />
intirnational competitiveness.<br />
The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin,<br />
has recently announced a comprehensive review of<br />
Commonwealth assistance and development policy relating to<br />
the resources, energy, agricultural, fisheries and forestry<br />
industries. The review will reassess the direction and<br />
nature of assistance measures, the degree of regulation and<br />
disparities in the treatment of different industries. 001 I0 </p>
<p>9.<br />
one area of reform in which I am sure you are all interested<br />
is business regulation. During our second term we<br />
established mechanisms for reviewing regulations. The BRRU<br />
has made a major contribution to this work and is achieving<br />
results. of particular interest to this group, companies<br />
and securities law is being reviewed in our third term of<br />
office. Over recent years, business operations have changed greatly.<br />
Activities are taking on a much more national and<br />
international character and their associated financial<br />
arrangements are becoming more complex.<br />
The existing co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme<br />
has had difficulty in meeting these challenges. The scheme<br />
itself also has a number of inherent defects that must be<br />
addressed. For these reasons the Government has authorised the<br />
Attorney-General, Mr Bowen, to develop a Commonwealth<br />
Companies and Securities Sch~ eme to replace the co-operative<br />
scheme.<br />
This scheme will be introduced only after full consultation<br />
with interested parties. Such consultation is already<br />
taking place through a Steering Committee set up by Mr<br />
Bowen. The task of this committee is to advise on the<br />
powers of the new Securities Commission and on any changes<br />
needed in regulations.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The past few years have highlighted the structural<br />
weaknesses in the Australian economy and its vulnerability<br />
and inflexibility in responding to external shocks. The<br />
challenge of the next three years is to set about tackling<br />
those weaknesses, through both domestic and international<br />
policy tools.<br />
At Davos, I emphasised that successful restructuring demands<br />
a fundamental change in performance and attitude both<br />
nationally and internationally. As such it is a task which<br />
individual countries and governments cannot successfully<br />
perform alone. We look to other nations, the business<br />
community and the unions to work with us in meeting this<br />
great national and international challenge. 0j 0) 15: i 4 _ 1 </p>
