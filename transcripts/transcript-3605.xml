PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 442<br />
February 1975<br />
NEW MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE<br />
The Government has decided to establish a special<br />
committee of ministers which will be concerned primarily<br />
with the Australian Government's relations with the States.<br />
The ministerial committee will comprise the<br />
Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Social<br />
Security and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development.<br />
The committee will be supported by a group of officials<br />
drawn from their Departments, working as a task force.<br />
The Australian Government will negotiate a new<br />
five-year financial assistance agreement with the States<br />
before the present agreement expires at the end of the<br />
current financial year.<br />
The Treasurer's consultations with the State<br />
Treasurers which-are now underway, are preliminary steps<br />
towards the negotiation of the new five-year agreement.<br />
As well as being concerned with the Australian<br />
Government's relations with-* the States overall, the<br />
ministerial committee will examine programs of direct<br />
assistance to regions, local Government and local communities.<br />
The Australian Government has laid considerable<br />
stress on the adoption of a regional approach to planning<br />
and decision-making.<br />
It is now time to consolidate the Australian<br />
Government's initiatives. This consolidation involves<br />
further co-operation with State administration.<br />
