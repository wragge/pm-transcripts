TEL PRIME MINISTER 0/ A<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP AND<br />
THE BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA<br />
COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS<br />
The President of the Business Council of Australia, Mr John Ralph and I have<br />
agreed on the critical importance of implementing a national competition policy<br />
along the lines recommended in the Hilmer Report. A t our meeting in Canberra<br />
today we discussed the benefits to the Australian economy that would flow from<br />
further microeconomic reform.<br />
Mr Ralph stressed that the BCA's top reform priority is the implementation of a<br />
national competition policy. I emphasised that the States had an important role to<br />
play In furthering Australia's economic interests. I said I hoped that, at the meeting<br />
of the Council of Australian Governments In Darwin next month, Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers would agree to:<br />
national competition legislation, which would<br />
extend trade practices law to all businesses, including Stateowned<br />
ienterprises and unincorporated entities<br />
establish a national access regime for essential infrastructure<br />
facilities establish a national prices surveillance system<br />
establishment of an Integrated national approach to competition<br />
administered by one set of Institutions; and<br />
continued progress In specific reforms such as to electricity and gas.<br />
I have assured Mr Ralph that business and other interested parties will be consul ted<br />
on the details of national competition policy legislation.<br />
