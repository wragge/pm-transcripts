SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF " NETWORKING AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE", THE FINAL REPORT<br />
OF THE BROADBAND SERVICES EXPERT GROUP, FILM AUSTRALIA,<br />
LINDFIELD, SYDNEY, 1 MARCH 1995<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here if not quite among visionaries, then at least<br />
among those who speak the language of the future, and who see as the<br />
authors of this report see the shapes and patterns of the future in an<br />
information age.<br />
That age, of course, is already upon us.<br />
If I might offer an image from the past the future at our doorstep is a bit like the<br />
encyclopaedia salesman, standing there proffering solutions to our educational<br />
shortcomings; entreating us to invest in knowledge of the things we never<br />
learned or had in life, but can now render to our children; tempting us with<br />
worldliness. The children, mind you, know more about it than we do. The chances are<br />
they've been clicking away at interactive media for years. Chances are they're<br />
playing a virtual reality game while we are standing at the door.<br />
But the game has really just begun, and we can't leave them stranded with a few<br />
scraps of technology which by Christmas will look like something from the Dark<br />
Ages. So, despite our reasonable doubts about the capacity of technology to change<br />
the things which really matter like love, laughter, life and death we say " Yes".<br />
We're not sure that technology gives us much more than a stress-related illness<br />
and a sense of inadequacy but we say " Yes". </p>
<p>Al Gore says the new information age is the equivalent of the Gutenburg Bible,<br />
but we know his emphasis is not on the Bible, but the technology which printed<br />
it. We know it is no substitute for belief.<br />
We know in our bones that it will not, of itself, give us knowledge or happiness.<br />
It will no more change our essential human needs than it will alter our bodily<br />
functions though I've met a few zealots who would have us believe that it will<br />
do these things.<br />
But for all our reservations, we look at the kids, and we think we cannot in f<br />
conscience deny them these things. This is their future. It's what the salesman<br />
says it is it's the best investment we can make.<br />
Now I don't know if there exist any reliable statistics to show that those who buy<br />
encyclopaedias end up with happier and more successful children than those<br />
who don't.<br />
But it is pretty obvious that merely buying them is not enough.<br />
It depends on buying, if not the best, then the best we can afford, and the one<br />
which is most appropriate to our needs.<br />
It also depends on whether we use it and, if we do, what we use it for as an<br />
icon of our learning for visitors to admire, or for the practical education of<br />
ourselves and our children.<br />
So long as we buy it for the content and not just the leather binding: so long as<br />
we bought it for what it says to us, rather than about us: so long as we were<br />
interested in the content rather than the appearance I think the chances are<br />
that with the encyclopaedia we did make an investment in the future.<br />
And I think the same is true about the new communications technologies.<br />
We really do have to embrace them now, so that we, our children and future<br />
generations of Australians will not be left behind.<br />
So that Australia will enter the 21st century where it should be, in the front rank<br />
of nations.<br />
And, when we do it, we should not be under any illusion that the act of embrace<br />
will, by itself, create the future we want.<br />
The technology itself is marvellous, of course; but it is only the means to an end. </p>
<p>Like the encyclopaedia, it is a beautiful thing.<br />
Like the encyclopaedia, it contains the means to worldly knowledge; to useful<br />
practical knowledge.<br />
Like the encyclopaedia, it can be the means of self-improvement, it can bring<br />
people from the margins into the mainstream.<br />
But, of itself, it is not a better education; or a better health service; or a better<br />
life.<br />
This technology will not teach us how to think. It will not teach us logic or<br />
argument or how to put a case, or how to work effectively in the world.<br />
It will not teach us how to write but all these things will be as important in<br />
information age as they have ever been.<br />
In fact, of itself, technology contains a few serious risks. It presents us with a<br />
great challenge.<br />
The initial excitement might be in the technology, but what matters is what we do<br />
with it.<br />
The real excitement is not in the highway itself, but in where it can take us.<br />
It can, for instance, take us to a more democratic and equitable society, or one in<br />
which injustice is intensified by unequal access to knowledge.<br />
The same can be said of the global context: it can help to bridge the gulf<br />
between the developed and the developing world, or it can make the gulf wider.<br />
It can strengthen our national culture and those of other countries, or, by the<br />
flood of homogenised " global" product, it can fatally weaken them.<br />
There is a lot at stake nothing less, in fact, than the shape of the society and<br />
the world we inhabit in the 21st century.<br />
The great challenge is to make sure that the new communications technologies<br />
enrich and strengthen us.<br />
For instance, they can be a powerful educational tool.<br />
We now have the opportunity to fully realise the educational potential that<br />
television never delivered. </p>
<p>We can link schools to share information.<br />
We can make it possible for schools in regional Australia to share the vast<br />
resources of our great institutions.<br />
We can expand the realms of these institutions.<br />
There are possibilities we have not yet thought of.<br />
The technology has the ability to help us meet our education and training needs<br />
in a world in which the turnover of knowledge in industry will soon complete I<br />
cycle every five years and sooner in the so-called knowledge-based industries.<br />
If Australia is to get the vocational training system we need, the effective<br />
deployment of the new technologies is essential.<br />
We can teach history, brick-laying, civics, hairdressing, physics and football<br />
around the clock, around the continent.<br />
We can deliver better health services to all Australians all the time: better<br />
diagnosis, better staff training, better care.<br />
We can deliver rehabilitation programs national rehabilitation programs into<br />
homes and community halls right across the country.<br />
We should be able to surely make the delivery of government services more<br />
efficient. Both the operation and our understanding of government should be improved by<br />
the application of these technologies.<br />
Again we can see the challenge: if we let it, the technology can be alienating, but<br />
if we are clever we can strengthen the bonds between us and raise our level of<br />
mutual understanding.<br />
We have to decide, as from now, that access to the national information<br />
infrastructure will be no less a general right than access to water, or public<br />
transport or electricity.<br />
It must not and need not be in any way the preserve of business, or the better<br />
off, or those who live in the major population centres, or who attend better<br />
schools. It has to be a fundamental right of all Australians. </p>
<p>We should recognise it as being to the 1990s what the railway and the telegraph<br />
and the mechanics institute were to the 1890s.<br />
The only difference need be that, unlike the railway, the information highway will<br />
not run through the seats of influence and privilege and you won't have to<br />
change trains at Albury.<br />
It goes without saying, of course, that the more rapidly and effectively we take on<br />
these technologies, the more competitive Australia will be.<br />
In fact, our competitiveness crucially depends on it.<br />
These days we talk about knowledge being the principal source of a nation's<br />
wealth. With the new information technologies, we must recognise that we are talking<br />
about more than the distribution of that wealth we are also talking about its<br />
creation. We can use this technology to greatly increase the productivity of our existing<br />
industries, and we can develop industries which produce or adapt the<br />
technology. We can export the technology.<br />
We are doing this now.<br />
But the greatest potential lies in content.<br />
An educated, English-speaking, multicultural, outward-looking country in the<br />
fastest growing region in the world has enormous advantages in the information<br />
market place.<br />
All those new channels and services and networks and systems will need<br />
programs and ideas and software.<br />
Australia can be a significant provider.<br />
Creating content for our own channels will be an essential part of protecting and<br />
enriching our national life.<br />
It will also be an export industry.<br />
We can trade in ideas and culture as well as minerals and manufactures. </p>
<p>That is why this is a very appropriate place to launch the Report.<br />
Film Australia is creating product for the highway and exporting it the potential<br />
to do more is virtually unlimited.<br />
It is a reminder that we are already engaged in the new technology.<br />
Australia is not simply receiving the new technology and the product it carries,<br />
but actively creating and shaping them.<br />
Last week in Brussels the G7 held an information society summit.<br />
Among other things, they concluded that realising the potential of the global<br />
information society depended on governments promoting:<br />
the universal provision of and access to services<br />
equality of opportunity<br />
diversity of content, including cultural and linguistic diversity, and<br />
open access to networks.<br />
They also stressed the importance of " defining an adaptable regulatory<br />
framework". " To succeed", they decided, " governments must facilitate private initiatives and<br />
investments and ensure an appropriate framework aiming at stimulating private<br />
investment and usage for the benefit of all citizens".<br />
Most of what they said, we have been saying in Australia for some time.<br />
Much of it we have been doing.<br />
And, of course, there is no better example of this than this Report by the<br />
Broadband Services Expert Group.<br />
BSEG's work rivals, and in most cases surpasses, the work being done by any<br />
other government in the world.<br />
The work of BSEG in the past year has helped to put Australia in the best<br />
possible position to take advantage of technological development particularly in<br />
their social applications. </p>
<p>The Report recommends the implementation of a national strategy: a strategy<br />
based broadly on the joint development of technical and creative infrastructure.<br />
The technical infrastructure is already on the way. Our telecommunications<br />
networks provide the platform for new interactive services to operate, and offer<br />
access to networks like Internet.<br />
Telstra and Optus are investing billions of dollars which will guarantee a firstrate<br />
telecommunications network in Australia next century.<br />
Later this year, a new dimension will open as optical fibre cable networks begin<br />
to reach substantial numbers of Australians.<br />
It is no less a significant advantage that the Australian population is computerliterate.<br />
More than 40 per cent of Australian households own a personal<br />
computer, which, with the exception of the United States, is the highest rate in<br />
the world.<br />
Last year we went a long way to developing the creative infrastructure when we<br />
produced the cultural statement, Creative Nation.<br />
A substantial part of that statement and a substantial part of the money it<br />
provided was directed at information technology and the new media.<br />
A significant precursor of Creative Nation was the decision to combine the<br />
portfolios of Communications and the Arts in other words, to link the<br />
technologies of the future with the creativity of our people.<br />
In giving a substantial boost to Australian cultural development, the statement<br />
recognised the need to encourage the growth of industries producing content for<br />
the new media.<br />
The creation of AME the Australian Media Enterprise whose board will be<br />
announced by the Minister within the next few weeks, carries the process<br />
significantly further.<br />
The BSEG Report recommends a " whole of government" approach. I am<br />
pleased to say that that is the direction we have taken.<br />
Last year I wrote to Ministers seeking Cabinet Submissions on the effect of new<br />
technologies on key portfolios.<br />
I'm expecting those submissions to be discussed in late March at a special<br />
Cabinet meeting which will be dedicated to government use of information<br />
technology. </p>
<p>8<br />
Information technology concerns education and training; it concerns industry; it<br />
obviously concerns telecommunications and the arts.<br />
It is, therefore, a major interest of Simon Crean's, Peter Cook's and Michael<br />
Lee's. It is a major interest for Ministers and Departments of Health, Human<br />
Services, Social Security, Administrative Services, Finance, Trade and others.<br />
It is certainly an interest of mine.<br />
That is why I want to implement the BSEG recommendations as quickly as<br />
possible.<br />
The fundamental recommendation is a national strategy for new communications<br />
networks.<br />
We have in part commenced that work.<br />
However, to take it further, I have decided to establish a National Information<br />
Services Council as the Report recommends.<br />
The Council will comprise Ministers and leaders from relevant fields, and will be<br />
established under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering<br />
Council. The members of the Council will be announced within the next few weeks.<br />
It will meet in April and October this year and, following the meetings, Cabinet<br />
will be convened to formally coordinate the Government's policy responses.<br />
By the end of the year we will have a blueprint for the next century.<br />
There is a great deal more I would like to say: but I don't want to sound like a<br />
zealot. Like all new technology and new encyclopaedias for that matter this new<br />
information technology does inspire a sort of messianic passion in the early<br />
stages of conversion.<br />
Yet, as the Report makes so patently clear, we need most of all a very<br />
considered and rational approach.<br />
So I will limit myself to saying this the opportunity for Australia is probably<br />
unprecedented. </p>
<p>9<br />
We have the chance to dramatically improve the performance of our existing<br />
industries while creating a plethora of new ones.<br />
New industries which will integrate us with the region and the world and, at the<br />
same time, strengthen our national life, culture and identity.<br />
We have the chance to deliver services more equitably and efficiently than ever<br />
before. In other words, we have the chance to make Australia significantly wealthier and<br />
more democratic: culturally richer and socially more cohesive.<br />
It is an extraordinary opportunity and it can be truly said that we are superbly<br />
placed to take advantage of it.<br />
Coming as it does, between the G7 meeting in Brussels and the CeBit Fair at<br />
which Australia is the partner country in Hanover next week, this launch of<br />
BSEG's Report is also well-placed.<br />
Let me close by congratulating Brian Johns and everyone who served on the<br />
Group and contributed to the Report.<br />
Above all, I want to thank them.<br />
They have made a very substantial contribution to their country.<br />
We know what the challenges are. We know that we can meet them, and that<br />
when we do, we meet our responsibilities to our children and the Australians of<br />
the 21st century. </p>
<p>ANNEXURE 1<br />
G-7 CONFERENCE ON THE INFORMATION SOCIETY<br />
Government ministers of the Group of Seven ( G7) industrialised nations and<br />
representatives of leading technology companies met in Brussels over last weekend at<br />
a conference on developments on the information society.<br />
Summary of principles agreed by ministers of G7 nations:<br />
The smooth and effective transition towards the information society is one of<br />
the most important tasks that should be undertaken in the last decade of the<br />
century;<br />
Our action must contribute to the integration of all countries into a global<br />
effort To succeed, governments must facilitate private initiatives and investments and<br />
ensure an appropriate framework aim-ing at stimulating private investment and<br />
usage for the benefit of all citizens;<br />
In order to realise the potential of the global information society in the future,<br />
the G7 partners agreed to collaborate in the areas of:<br />
-promoting dynamic competition<br />
-encouraging private investment<br />
-defining an adaptable regulatory framework<br />
-providing open access to networks<br />
while: -ensuring universal provision of and access to services;<br />
-promoting equality of opportunity to the citizen;<br />
-promoting diversity of content, including cultural and linguistic<br />
diversity; and<br />
-recognising the necessity of worldwide cooperation with particular<br />
attention to less developed countries.<br />
[ n addition, the G7 launched I11 projects aimed at stimulating and promoting the<br />
application of information technology. The projects encompass education and training,<br />
electronic libraries museums and galleries, global health care applications, environment<br />
and natural resources management, government on-line services, and broadband<br />
networking. </p>
<p>ANNEXURE 2<br />
HANOVER<br />
CeBIT is the world's largest information technology and telecommunications trade fair,<br />
held annually in Hanover. It has grown at an extraordinary rate since its inception in<br />
1986. In 1993, the fair was attended by over 660,000 visitors, with 5,800 exhibitors<br />
from 45 countries.<br />
One partner country is selected each year this year, Australia has been selected to fill<br />
that role. The partner country is given the opportunity to create an exhibit featuring:<br />
Information Technology<br />
Network computing<br />
Computer integrated manufacturing<br />
Software<br />
Consulting and services<br />
Office technology<br />
Banking technology<br />
Security equipment<br />
Research<br />
As partner country, Australia will present a conference program to promote our<br />
technological achievements and potential, and the opportunities for investing and doing<br />
business in Australia. Australia's exhibit will also include economic and trade<br />
development agencies, industry associations, consulting firms, investment and<br />
technology brokers, and banks and other financial institutions.<br />
The theme " InTelligent Australia" has been chosen for the partner country<br />
involvement. It is aimed at highlighting the following benefits.<br />
Australian skill in creating and using IT applications: in finance, banking,<br />
mining, education, health, environmental management, transport, hospitality<br />
and government.<br />
Australia as a source of innovation through federal and state programs of<br />
research and development.<br />
Australia as a destination for investment by overseas firms whether they seek<br />
equity interest in leading edge companies, or partnerships to access new<br />
markets. Australia as the ideal location for US and European firms to establish their Asia<br />
Pacific regional headquaters.<br />
Australia as a gateway to Asia, combining proximity with stability, competitive<br />
costs and a sophisticated telecommuincations infrastructure. </p>
