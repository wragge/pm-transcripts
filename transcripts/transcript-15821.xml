    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with great pleasure I announce today that 1000 of Australia's best and brightest people have been selected to help shape the nation's future at the Australia 2020 Summit.</p>
<p>The 10 member independent Steering Committee, chaired by Professor Glyn Davis, has had a very tough job selecting the participants from nearly 8,000 very high quality nominations.</p>
<p>The selection process was extremely rigorous and demanding and I commend the Steering Committee for their efforts over the past month.</p>
<p>The 1000 people who have been selected will receive their invitations this coming week.</p>
<p>I would like to personally congratulate those invited to participate in this national debate about Australia's long term future.</p>
<p>This Summit will bring together a diverse and talented range of people who are incredibly positive about gaining the opportunity to put forward their ideas on a national platform.</p>
<p>I would like to encourage every Australian, whether selected as a participant or not, to contribute their ideas and ambitions to the 2020 Summit by making a submission to one of the 10 critical discussion areas which will form the basis of Summit discussions.</p>
<p>In addition to making a submission there are a number of associated events where people can put forward their ideas and participate in discussions.</p>
<p>School Summits will be held by individual primary and secondary schools over a three week period, starting on the 17th of March. The 2020 Youth Summit will involve 100 young Australians and will be held in Canberra on April 12 and 13.</p>
<p>In addition some State and Territory Premiers will be holding their own Summits and there has also been a great deal of interest from Local Members of Parliament to host Summits in their respective electorates to ensure that the ideas of their constituents are considered.</p>
<p>All of the key issues and ideas from the submissions and associated events will form part of the discussions at the 2020 Summit in Canberra on April 19 and 20.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister, I congratulate and thank everyone who nominated. I look forward to hearing your ideas for Australia's future.</p>
