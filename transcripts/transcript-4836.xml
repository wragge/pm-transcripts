FOR PRESS 27 SEPTEMBER, 1978<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC CONFERENCE ON NATIONAL,<br />
PARKS AND RESERVES<br />
The commonwealth Government has agreed to share with<br />
New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland the costs of the<br />
second South Pacific Conference on National Parks and<br />
Reserves. The Conference will be held in Sydney in<br />
April/ May next year.<br />
Formal sessions of the Conference will concentrate on<br />
practical conservation problems common to the South Pacific<br />
Region. The object will be to encourage effective<br />
solutions compatible with the cultural background, existing<br />
resources and national aspirations of the countries of<br />
the Region. The Conference will include tours of National<br />
Parks in Queensland and Victoria.<br />
All overseas delegates will be responsible for the cost of<br />
travel to and from Australia. This could deter representation<br />
from some of the smaller countries of the Region, and<br />
therefore the Commonwealth Government is approaching the<br />
United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP) seeking<br />
assistance to subsidise the air fares of delegates<br />
from these countries. 000---</p>
