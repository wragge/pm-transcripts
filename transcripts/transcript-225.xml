Text of' Speech by the Right Honourable R. G. Menzie. E,<br />
C. HI 10) M. P, Prtm e MiniLs ter<br />
I', dinev-Iay, 5th October, 1960<br />
I join in the congratulations which have been extended to the new<br />
President and the new member nations. Each of them, in a sense, needs our<br />
sympathy, our understanding, and our disinterested help. I have heard only<br />
some of the speeches. for I arrived from Australia only on Friday last, but I<br />
have read most of the earlier speeches, and have endeavoured to sense the<br />
feeling of the debate. Each delegate must try to make his individual<br />
contribution to our discussion from the point of view of his own country.<br />
I should therefore present myself to you I am afraid for the second time<br />
to-day as the Prime Minister of a nation which grew out of six colonies;<br />
a nation of relatively small numbers something over ten millions-but of<br />
considerable productive and trading development, and a lively interest in the<br />
world Australia is, indeed in terms of international trade, one of<br />
the first seven trading nations. This being so, it will at once be seen that<br />
the continuance and expansion of peaceful trade is, from an economic point<br />
of view, vital to us,<br />
The proportion ' of our trade which sails the seas is immeasurably greater<br />
than that of countries of high population and resources, who could, if they<br />
wished, live to themselves much more successfully than we could. We therefore<br />
not only have, as human beings, a passionate desire for peace; we have, as a<br />
nation, a great vested interest in its preservation, It would seemn to most of<br />
us a happy circumstance that sentiment and interest should coincide. " 1Here",<br />
we would say, " is the perfect marriage", Future generations, if huiman follies<br />
do not destroy them in advance, may well, with the clear " hindsight" of history,<br />
wonder how it came about that the 20th century was so marred by war, and how<br />
it was that, in 1960, representatives of 100 nations could not make peace.<br />
" Surely", they will say, " if each nation had peace as its heart's desire, and<br />
also wanted peace as the condition of prosperity, nothing could have stood<br />
in the way". Can we all honestly look into our own hearts and mindsand answer<br />
those implicit questions? As a newcomer to this Assembly: I have been<br />
shocked at the evidence that there are some who have no peace in their hearts,<br />
and who appear to believe that by threats of aggression, by violent propaganda, </p>
<p>by actual conquest if necessary, they will extend the substance of their<br />
material wealth and the boundaries of their economic influence.<br />
I thought that President Eisenhower made a statesmanlike, constructive,<br />
generous speech. In a conference in which there appears to be a<br />
disposition in the minds of some to play for the ideological support of the<br />
new member nations, and to bring them within what I believe are called<br />
" Spheres of influence" for purposes of aggrandisement, the American President<br />
took a high line.<br />
He said in effect, and I most respectfully agree, that we are not<br />
to look at our new colleagues as if they were voters to be collected, or as<br />
pawns in a vast international game, but as independent, co-equal, and free.<br />
The new nations have not won their freedom only in order to barter it<br />
away. It is offensive to them to regard them as potential satellites. Let<br />
me, for my own country, address some words directly to the representatives of<br />
these nations. They have not failed to observe that there are those here who seek<br />
to inflame their minds with a spirit of resentment, and to make them believe that<br />
their best friends are those who produce with monotonous but fierce regularity<br />
slogans about " colonialism" and " imperialism".<br />
It is I believe, a simple but sometimes forgotten truth that the<br />
greatest enemy to present joy and high hope is the cultivation of<br />
retrospective bitterness. I beg of all these distinguished representatives<br />
to put bitterness out of their minds.<br />
So far as they are concerned, the past has gone. The dead past<br />
should bury its dead. It is the present and future that matter. Most of them<br />
know that political independence can be won more swiftly than economic independence<br />
and yet both are essential to true nationhood.<br />
Under these circumstances, nations which are older in self-government<br />
should not be looking at the new nations as people whose support should be<br />
canvassed, but as people who need objective assistance with no strings if the<br />
material prosperity of their people is to be improved. It is one of the<br />
significant things in contemporary history that the advanced industrial<br />
nations are, because of their scientific and technological advantages,<br />
improving their standards at a phenomenal rate; while less advanced<br />
countries, lacking the same techniques on the same scale, are advancing at<br />
a slower rate. This is not one of the facts of life which one may observe and,<br />
having observed, forget. Its significance is that gap between the advanced<br />
and the relatively unadvanced tends, unless we do something about it, to grow<br />
wider every year. It is not a state of affairs which civilised and humane </p>
<p>thinking can indefinitely tolerate.<br />
If in this Assembly and in the nations here represented, we will<br />
constantly remember that our trust is for humanity and that, indeed, the<br />
United Nations itself has no other reason for existence, we will more and<br />
more concentrate our efforts on providing economic and technical help for new<br />
nations to the very limit of our capacity; not because we want, to put it<br />
crudely, to buy them into our own ideas of things, not only because we really<br />
and passionately believe in independence and freedom, but also because we<br />
believe that our fellow human beings everywhere are entitled to decent<br />
conditions of life, and have enough sense to know that independence and<br />
freedom are mere words unless the ordinary people of free countries have a chance<br />
of a better life to-morrow.<br />
This point of view seemed to me to underlie the temperate speech<br />
of Mr. Macmillan and other speeches made by democratic leaders.<br />
But there are others who have so far misunderstood the spirit of the<br />
United Nations as to resort to open or veiled threats, blatant and in some<br />
instances lying propaganda, a clearly expressed desire to divide and conquer.<br />
They should learn that " threatened men live long", and that free nations,<br />
however small, are not susceptible to bullying.<br />
I will permit myself the luxury of developing this theme, though<br />
quite briefly, in the particular and in the general. In his opening speech,<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Khrushchev made his usual great play about " colonialism".<br />
As Mr. Macmillan reminded us, the a'iswer to much of his story is to be found<br />
in the presence in this Assembly of many new nations, once colonies and now<br />
independent. Mr. Khrushchev said among other things " nations who oppress other<br />
nations cannot themselves be free. Every free nation should help the peoples<br />
still oppressed to win freedom and !-ndependence". This was, in one sense, a<br />
most encouraging observation.<br />
It made me wonder whetheT we were perhaps about to see a beginning<br />
of an era in which the nations of Eu~ rope,, which were once independent and are<br />
now under Soviet Communist control, were going to receive the blessings of<br />
independence. What a glorious vista of freedom w3uld be opened up by s-ich a<br />
policy. How much it would do to relieve the causes of tension, and promote<br />
peace. I venture to say that it is an act of complete hypocrisy for a<br />
Communist leader to denounce colonialism as if it were an evil characteristic<br />
of the Western Powers, when the facts are that the greatest colonial power<br />
now existing is the Soviet Union itself.<br />
Further, in the course of this Assembly, Mr. Khrushchev wab good<br />
enough to make some references to my own country and its positior la~ ion<br />
to the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. He calls upon Australia to give </p>
<p>immediate full independence and self-government to New Guinea and Papua. As<br />
a piece of rhetoric this no doubt has its points. But it exhibits a disturbing<br />
want of knowledge of these territories and of the present stage of their<br />
development. Nobody who knows anything about these territories and their<br />
indigenous people could doubt for a moment that for us in Australia to abandon<br />
our responsibilities forthwith would be an almost criminal act.<br />
Here is a country which not so long ago was to a real extent in a<br />
state of savagery. It passed through the most gruesome experiences during<br />
the last war. It came out of it without organised administration and, in a<br />
sense, without hope. It is not a nation in the accepted term. Its people<br />
have no real structure of association except through our administration.<br />
its groups are isolated among mountains, forests, rivers and swamps. It is<br />
estimated that there are no less than 200 different languages.<br />
The work to be done to create and foster a sense and organism of<br />
community is therefore enormous. But with a high sense of responsibility,<br />
Australia has attacked its human task in this almost unique area. Since the<br />
war some form of civilised order has been established over many thousands of<br />
square miles which were previously unexplored.<br />
We have built up an extensive administration service from nothing to<br />
a total of thousands of public servants, local members of the public service<br />
and administration indigenous employees.<br />
We have created five main ports with modern equipment, We have<br />
built over 5,000 miles of road; constructed over 100 air fields; established<br />
and improved postal and tele-communications services. We have built four<br />
large and modern base hospitals, 101 subsidiary hospitals and 12,000 aid<br />
posts and medical centres. There are in operation 778 infant and welfare<br />
clinics. We have built from nothing, medical services which include 119<br />
doctors, 347 trained nurses, 236 medical assistants, and thousands of native<br />
medical assistants, medical orderlies and nurses.<br />
In a little more than a few years, we have established 4,100 schools<br />
which are attended by 200,000 pupils; large stock stations have been<br />
established; and a great forestry industry founded. I could go on like this<br />
indefinitely. All this has been done in a few years since the war. The<br />
achievement has not been without cost. We are a very strange colonial power,<br />
if I understand the sense in which that term is used. We have put many<br />
more millions into Papua and New Guinea than have ever come out or will ever<br />
come out. Like the Netherlands. whose representative spoke last night about<br />
its side of New Guinea we regard ourselves as having a duty to produce as<br />
soon as it is practicable an opportunity for complete self-determination for<br />
the people of Papua and New Guinea. We have established many local<br />
government Councils in order to provide training in administration, and we<br />
have set up a Legislative Council on which only the other day we substantially<br />
increased the number of indigenous representatives. </p>
<p>Mr. Khrushchev includes us in his diatribe against " foreign<br />
administrators who despise and loot the local population". I have shown<br />
how exactly opposite to the truth this is in our case. His further<br />
extravaganza about the " overseer's lash" and the " executioner's axe" must<br />
relate to areas with which he is more familiar than he is with New Guinea<br />
and Papua. I must say with complete clarity that we do not need to be lectured<br />
on such matters by a man who has no record whatever of having brought colonial<br />
people into freedom and self-Government. We indeed are proud to be in the<br />
British tradition of the 20th Century a tradition which has by sensible<br />
degrees and enlightened administration brought the blessings of self-<br />
Government and a seat in the Councils of the world to many former colonies.<br />
Why has this General Assembly become so significant a forum on this<br />
occasion? Why has it attracted the attendance of what I must imagine to be<br />
the greatest number of Heads of State and Heads of Government in its history?<br />
These are interesting questions and I should like to try to<br />
answer them. The dominating fact is that world's peace is under threat and,<br />
as Mr. Nehru pointed out on Monday, peace is the paramount problem. We<br />
are not living in a time of peace.<br />
The " cold war" is intensifying. The heartsand minds of men and<br />
women are distressed. Most delegates have come here hoping that tensions<br />
might be reduced, that some ray of light may come through some opening door;<br />
that the new nations here represented for the first time here because they<br />
have achieved an independent freedom and are, as I hope and believe,<br />
determined to maintain it would make a fresh contribution not to<br />
recriminations but to achievement.<br />
Running through all these ideas is the widespread world feeling that<br />
the United Nations represents the great hope; that it is better to debate<br />
freely about grievances and occasions of difference than to make war about<br />
them. But what has happened so far? A highly organised group, threateningly<br />
led, has developed an attack in at least four directions.<br />
It has engaged in a colossal war of propaganda, singularly uninhibited<br />
by facts and marked by gross falsity of argument. The old slogans<br />
have been used ad nauseam. Mr. Khrushchev talked on Monday last in a somewhat<br />
macabre fashion about corpses. But I point out that the whole of his<br />
heated propaganda about " imperialism", of which his own country is no doubt<br />
itself the chief current practitioner, has been designed to put pressure<br />
on the newly free nations to move into the unfree Communist orbit, to foment<br />
bitterness in their minds about the past, to disinter the corpses of old<br />
grievances and sorrows; to persuade our new colleagues, if he can, to<br />
forego the joy and hopes of their new and independent nationhood. </p>
<p>Mr. Khrushchev has engaged in an attack upon the Secretary-<br />
General, the distinguished choice of the United Nations, a man with whose<br />
opinion anybody has a right to disagree, but whose ability and integrity<br />
are beyond challenge. He has the complete confidence of Australia.<br />
Mr. Khrushchev has without a shred of evidence, called him the biassed<br />
representative of Western capitalism, and has asked for his replacement by a<br />
triumvirate of Secretaries-General.<br />
In this triumvirate there will be what I will describe in the<br />
modern jargon as an " in-built" veto; a triumvirate whose work would be<br />
clearly doomed to frustration and fatuity, leading to the consequential<br />
collapse of the United Nations executive machinery. Since the result of his<br />
proposal could be no other than this, it must be presumed that he intends<br />
it. There is an old maxim of the English law that a man is presumed to<br />
intend the reasonable consequences of his actions. It is a trite saying,<br />
but it is worth thinking about.<br />
Mr. Khrushchev has sought to convertthe United Nations into the<br />
dis-United Nations by dividing the nations ( as ancient Gaul was, according to<br />
Caesar) into three parts, which he conveniently though perhaps not very<br />
accurately described as the Communist world, the free aemocratic world<br />
( or as he might prefer to call it so as not to step outside the slogan line<br />
the capitalist world), and the neutral world. Neutralism is of course, one<br />
of those rather rotund words which does not readily admit of definition.<br />
If, when we say that a nation is neutral, that it will not under<br />
any circumstances take arms in any conflict which does not concern the<br />
protection of its own immediate boundaries, it seems to be a notion hard<br />
to reconcile with the Charter of the United Nations which contemplates under<br />
certain circumstances the use of combined force in terms of the Charter<br />
itself. Mr. Nehru, the distinguished leader of India, has not, I think,<br />
used the word " neutral" in this sense I hope I accurately represent him,<br />
He and his Government maintain large defences in their own country, and are<br />
active supporters of the Charter.<br />
What he has consistently made clear is that he stands for nonalignment<br />
in the sense that he will not engage in any special military or<br />
quasi-military alliance.<br />
My own country does not subscribe to this view although it<br />
respects it, since we are party, for example, to the South-East Asian<br />
Treaty with the military associations which are either expressed or implied<br />
in it. But we do not quarrel with each other about these matters </p>
<p>0 </p>
<p>4 7.<br />
I would think it i mpossible to believe that some of the<br />
greatest leaders of so-called neutral countries would regard themselves<br />
as being neutral in the great conflict of ideas. The real point that I<br />
want to emphasize is that you cannot make the United Nations effective by<br />
converting all of us into pledge advocates of groups of conflicting<br />
interests in this Assembly, in the Security Council, in the whole operation<br />
of the United Nations and its specialised agencies.<br />
Unity must be the aim. Common action for peace must be the<br />
procedure. In short, Mr. Khrushchev has on this occasion, so far from working<br />
towards an easing of the cold war, for the very existence of which his country<br />
carries a grievous and major responsibility, set out to exacerbate the cold<br />
war by fomenting tension, by encouraging bitterness and by seeking to paralyse<br />
oftconfuse the minds of the free peoples. I speak for a small nation with a<br />
love of peace, without nuclear weapons, with a burning desire to develop<br />
itself, a task which consumes every ounce of energy it possesses; to raise<br />
. its standards * of living; with no ' aggression in its heart;<br />
utterly independent, though with strong historic and present ties with its<br />
sister nations of the Commonwealth.<br />
In Australia-we are as I will not need to say, resolutely opposed<br />
to communism. It will never prevail in an unconquered Australia. It runs<br />
co ' unter to all our traditions, our instincts, anO our hopes. But there is<br />
a distinction to be made. , Free democracies are not aggressive. No free<br />
nation or combination of free nations desires either to send political<br />
missionaries into the Soviet Union ( a courtesy which we would be glad to have<br />
reciprocated) or to resort to the futile arbitrament of war. In this true<br />
sense, we stand for peaceful co-existence. We believe that Communist countries<br />
have as much right to their own system as we have to ours. It means that<br />
for other countries, emerging from colonial rule, we believe in selfdetermination,<br />
uninfluenced by threat or guile or purchase.<br />
It is an appropriate occasion on which to remind delegates that<br />
Australia is situated in a part of the world in which the immediate threat of<br />
aggression comes from Communist China, a nation of vast resources of manpower,<br />
and with leaders deeply devoted to Marxist principles. It is small<br />
wonder that such nations as Pakistan and the Philippines, Thailand, Great<br />
Britain, the United States, France, New Zealand and Australia have banded<br />
themselves together for mutual assistance and to do their best to avoid a<br />
further exposure of the area to Communist control. This treaty is paIlpably<br />
one of non-aggression. It deserves the careful thought of delegates<br />
because it will recall to their minds the fact that Communism is not expansionist<br />
in the West and South-West only.<br />
I used the well-known phrase " peaceful co-existence". Perhaps<br />
I should make it quite clear that we would welcome " peaceful co-exist~ ence" if </p>
<p>4 8.<br />
the Communists would only practise it. Nobody denies or regrets the great<br />
modern development of the resources of the Communist powers. The technological<br />
achievements of the Soviet Union for example have excited our admiration.<br />
All that we ask is that we just be left alone to enjoy our own forms of<br />
government and our own type of civilization.<br />
I was profoundly interested in what Mr. Nehru said about disarmament,<br />
and about the need for establishing contemporaneously, arrangements for<br />
disarmament and inspection. There are, however, two aspects of this matter,<br />
about which he and I have exchanged ideas before to-day, which are worth<br />
mentioning. The first is that the problem of disarmament itself cannot be<br />
divided into parts.<br />
As has already been said, disarmament and inspection are inseparable.<br />
Again it is to me unthinkable that we should imagine that the risks of war<br />
would be diminished if the nations disarmed in the nuclear field but not in'<br />
the field of what are politely called " conventional arms". For the fact is<br />
that it is only the possession of nuclear weapons, terrible though they<br />
are in their possibilities of destruction, horrible as it is to contemplate their<br />
continued development, which deprives the Communist powers of instant and<br />
overwhelming military superiority in the relevant areas. Nuclear, thermonuclear<br />
and conventional arms must, therefore, all be dealt with together.<br />
The second point I make is that I cannot honestly accept the view<br />
that armaments are the major cause of world tension. That view seems to me<br />
a serious over-simplification. True, if any power or combination of powers<br />
has shown that it is aggressively-minded and seeks to extend its boundaries<br />
of control wider and wider by force if necessary, then the possession by<br />
that power or group of powers of vast armaments will be the cause of tension.<br />
But if the non-aggressive powers are in result driven into maintaining and<br />
developing great defensive armaments, it is proper to say that their armaments<br />
are the result of tension and not its cause.<br />
In effect, what we need in the world, just as much as the vastly<br />
important disarmament talks, is a serious attempt by negotiation to encourage<br />
freedom and understanding, to remove the causes of friction and to persuade<br />
nations that aggressive policies and proselytising political religions are the<br />
ememies of peace. There are many other matters which I could speak about.<br />
But time marches on, and I wish to avoid repetition.<br />
I therefore conclude by saying, for Australia, that we subscribe to<br />
the sound principle of foreign policy that no nation should seek to interfere<br />
with the domestic affairs of another. This, indeed, is the " good<br />
neighbour" principle. If it could be accepted seriously and generally, the<br />
world would become a happy place. </p>
