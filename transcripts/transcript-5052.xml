PRIME MINIISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 MAY 1979<br />
The Prime Minister will visit Nigeria on 28-30 July 1979 at<br />
the invitation of the Nigerian Head of State,. General Obasanjo.<br />
He will then proceed to Lusaka, Zambia for the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting to be held on 1-8 August 1979.<br />
While in Nigeria the Prime Minister expects to exchange views<br />
with General Obasanjo on major current issues, including<br />
Southern African matters, and to continue discussions on<br />
international economic issues which were initiated in Jamaica<br />
in December 1978. The Prime Minister will also be discussing<br />
aspects of the bilateral relationship between Australia and<br />
Nigeria. The visit reflects the importance Australia attaches to its<br />
relations with black Africa and our desire to maintain<br />
contact with important black African countries on Southern<br />
African issues.<br />
The Prime Minister has said that he warmly welcomes this<br />
opportunity to visit Nigeria, a significant African State<br />
and an influential fellow member of the Commonwealth. </p>
