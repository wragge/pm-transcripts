PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 DECEMBER 1989<br />
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mr lan<br />
Burgess, Managing Director of CSR Limited, as a member of<br />
the Australian Public Service Management Advisory Board.<br />
Mr Burgess will replace Mr David Block, AC, as the<br />
representative with management expertise in the private<br />
sector. His appointment will commence with the first<br />
board meeting in 1990, and will be for two years.<br />
I have earlier expressed my appreciation for the valuable<br />
contribution made by Mr Block during his two years as a<br />
member of the board.<br />
Mr Burgess is highly regarded as an outstanding manager.<br />
I am confident he will bring valuable insights to the<br />
board, and thus contribute significantly to the further<br />
improvement of public sector administration i<br />
n Australia.<br />
