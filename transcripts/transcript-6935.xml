PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH<br />
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CANDLE-LIGHTING CEREMONY<br />
KINGS HALL 28 MAY 1986<br />
YEARS AGO, THE VISION AND HUMANITY OF PETER BENENSON, A<br />
CATHOLIC LAWYER OF JEWISH DESCENT, BORN OF ENGLISH AND<br />
RUSSIAN PARENTS, GAVE BIRTH TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, THE<br />
GREAT ORGANISATION WHOSE ANNIVERSARY WE CELEBRATE TODAY.<br />
IN RlAY 1961, THE FIRST AMNESTY APPEAL WAS MADE, ON BEHALF OF<br />
POLITICAL PRISONERS FROM EIGHT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,<br />
BOTH COMMUNIST AND NON-COMMUNIST.<br />
IN DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR, THE FIRST SYMBOLIC LIGHTING OF THE<br />
AMNESTY CANDLE TOOK PLACE ON THE STEPS OF THE CHURCH OF ST M. ARTINS-IN<br />
-THE-FIELD, LONDON.<br />
FROM THOSE SMALL BEGINNINGS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS<br />
DEVELOPED INTO AN ORGANISATION WITH OVER HALF A MILLION<br />
MEMBERS, SUPPORTERS AND SUBSCRIBERS WORLD-WIDE.<br />
IT HAS 1MADE ORDINARY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD AWARE OF THE<br />
PLIGHT OF THOSE DEFENDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS WE IN AUSTRALIA<br />
TAKE FOR GRALNTED. IT [ HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING PRACTICAL<br />
HELP TO THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF ABUSE.<br />
AMNESTY CAN RIGHTLY CELEBRATE TODAY TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF<br />
SUCCESSFUL ENDEAVOUR TO IDENTIFY AND FREE PRISONERS OF<br />
CONSCIENCE, TO SECURE FAIR AND PROM4PT TRIALS FOR POLITICAL<br />
PRISONERS, AND TO END TORTURE AND EXECUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE<br />
WORLD. IN AUSTRALIA AMNESTY HAS SOME 10,000 COMMITTED MEMBERS IN<br />
BRANCHES IN ALL STATES. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY GROUPS ARE<br />
WORKING HARD TOWARDS RELEASE OF PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY COMMENDS THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN<br />
WHEREBY THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP IS WRITING TO 10,000 DECISION<br />
MAKERS IN SOUTH AFRICA TOWARDS THIS END.<br />
TODAY'S CEREMONY, FITTINGLY HELD HERE, IN THE PLACE WHICH IS<br />
CENTRAL TO AUSTRALIA'S FUNDAMENTAL IDEALS OF FREEDOM AND<br />
DEMOCRACY, IS SPONSORED BY TWO OF THE AUSTRALIAN AMNESTY<br />
GROUPS, THE A. C. T. GROUP AND THE PARLIAMENTARY GROUP. </p>
<p>THE PARLIAMENTARY GROUP WAS FORMED IN 1973 AND CURRENTLY HAS<br />
OVER 70 MEMBERS. THE FOUR PARTY LEADERS, JOHN HOWARD,<br />
IAN SINCLAIR, DON CHIPP AND I ARE HONOURED AND PROUD TO BE<br />
ITS PATRONS.<br />
THE WORK OF AMNESTY IN IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING PRISONERS<br />
OF CONSCIENCE HAS THE SUPPORT OF ALL AUSTRALIANS TO WHOM THE<br />
IDEALS OF POLITICAL AND PERSONAL FREEDOM AND THE VALUE OF<br />
FREE SPEECH AND OPEN PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT ARE<br />
IMPORTANT. TO NOBODY WERE THESE IDEALS AND VALUES MORE IMPORTANT THAN<br />
TO THE LATE SENATOR ALAN MISSEN. ALAN WAS TWICE THE<br />
CHAIRMAN OF THE PARLIAMIENTARY GROUP OF AMNESTY, AND WAS ITS<br />
CURRENT CHAIRMAN AT THE TIME OF HIS UNTIMELY DEATH IN MARCH.<br />
IT IS THEREFORE WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I AM ABLE TO<br />
ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY AMNESTY GROUP HAS<br />
DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT MEMORIAL TO ALAN WHICH WILL<br />
REFLECT HIS LIFETIME'S COMM'ITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS CAUSES.<br />
NEXT YEAR, BEFORE HUT-IAN RIGHTS WEEK, THE PARLIAMENTARY GROUP<br />
WILL ORGANISE A HUM4AN RIGHTS LECTURE TO BE GIVEN IN ALAN<br />
MISSEN'S NAME. WITH ANY PROCEEDS RAISED FROM THE LECTURE,<br />
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN BY A PROMINENT PERSON WITH DIRECT<br />
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE AREAS OF HUM-AN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS,<br />
AMNESTY WILL THEN MAKE SOME DONATION TO A SPECIFIC AMNESTY<br />
PROJECT, THEREBY COM4BINING BOTH SOME PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF<br />
THE WORK OF AMNESTY WITH A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF<br />
CONCERN. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ALAN WOULD HAVE APPROVED<br />
WHOLE-HEARTEDLY OF THIS UNJDERTAKING.<br />
AMNESTY TOOK AS ITS SYMBOL THE CANDLE SURROUNDED BY<br />
BARBED-WIRE IN RECOGNITION OF THE TRUTH OF THE ANCIENT<br />
CHINESE PROVERB, " BETTER TO LIGHT A CANDLE THAN CURSE THE<br />
DARKNESS". HERE TODAY, IN LIGHTING THIS CANDLE, A CEREMONY WHICH I<br />
PERFORM ON BEHALF OF ALL AUSTRALIANS, WE REMEMBER THE FATE<br />
OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY<br />
WHERE THEIR RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE RESPECTED. WE SUPPORT<br />
THE WORK WHICH AMNESTY HAS DONE FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY<br />
ON THEIR BEHALF, AND I INVITE THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
TO JOIN WITH ME IN OUR EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR AMNESTY'S<br />
CONTINUING EFFORTS. </p>
