PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 M4AY 1987<br />
Australians have watched with close interest and deep<br />
concern the recent events in Fiji. The Australian<br />
Government has monitored the evolving situation extremely<br />
carefully, hour by hour, including through the reporting of<br />
our High Commission in Suva. It is absolutely appropriate<br />
that this should be so given the importance to Australian<br />
interests of stability in this near neighbour and the fact<br />
that we have been faced with the unprecedented spectacle in<br />
the South Pacific of the forced overthrow by the military of<br />
a democratically elected government.<br />
Cabinet met again today to review the very fluid situation<br />
in Fiji, to review the approach which the Government has<br />
adopted and to consider a range of possible responses by<br />
Australia. I express again our continuing strong concern at damage<br />
being inflicted on the fabric of Fiji society and on its<br />
political institutions.<br />
Australia is accustomed to share with Fiji common values of<br />
the rule of law and of Parliamentary democracy based on free<br />
elections. Those values have been shared because of our<br />
respective sovereign commitments to them and in recognition<br />
of their contribution to the welfare, progress, and security<br />
of the South Pacific region.<br />
The Government accordingly believes that in emphasising<br />
publicly those values and objectives it has also been<br />
helping in a time of crisis to hold before the leadership of<br />
Fiji the values of that nation as well as of Australia. The<br />
Government continues to be convinced of the sole claim to<br />
legitimacy of the Bavadra Government. It will maintain its<br />
condemnation of the military coup. It reaffirms also its<br />
strong view that if reliance is to be placed on fresh<br />
elections they must be free and general and be held under<br />
the existing Constitution.<br />
Although the situation in Fiji is highly complex and<br />
although there have been many twists and turns as the<br />
situation has unfolded, no analysis can escape one basic<br />
judgement. The essence of the crisis is the assault on<br />
Fijian democracy. The solution to the crisis must be the<br />
restoration of democratic principles and practice. We can<br />
be flexible as to precise solutions, but consistency with<br />
that basic principle is vital. </p>
<p>we believe also that given the delicately balanced communal<br />
relationships in Fiji, the protection and preservation into<br />
the future of democratic process is indispensable to all the<br />
people of Fi-Ji. The-unique composition of Fiji society<br />
provides added proof of the essentiality of genuine<br />
democracy to all groups.<br />
Fiji already has certain constitutionally entrenched rights<br />
for the Fijiazns. The maintenance or modification of these<br />
rights are the responsibility of all those in Fiji. They<br />
will fail themselves if they fail to proceed by due<br />
democratic processes and if they confuse the agreed<br />
entrenchment of certain rights with any attempt by one<br />
community to seek control of the other through some<br />
contamination of the Constitution.<br />
The Government confirms its support for the<br />
Governor-General's courageous efforts to uphold the<br />
Constitution and to accept appropriate advice to that end.<br />
It praises the courage displayed by Dr Bavadra under<br />
enormous strain and his conciliatory approach following his<br />
release. It appeals to both major communities to recognise<br />
as they have In the past that they each depend vitally on<br />
Parliamentary democracy. It reaffirms that the armed forces<br />
and police have only one role to serve and not subvert<br />
their democratic Constitution.<br />
we hope earnestly that the search for a solution and the<br />
proper me'ans to finding it can proceed with the<br />
participation of all parties and at a pace as well as<br />
direction that will prevent any further disturbance of law<br />
and order or further human suffering and damage to property.<br />
In weighing our responses to developments in Fiji we need<br />
also to take account of the views of our friends In the<br />
South Pacific :* egion. The events in Fiji are as unwelcome<br />
for them as they are for us, and unsettling for Fiji's<br />
neighbours. In deciding on our own actions we have to bear<br />
in mind the implications they have for these countries and<br />
for our relations with them.<br />
We shall keep in contact with these countries about<br />
developments ir Fiji and our responses. I have myself been<br />
in touch with N~' ew Zealand Prime Minister Lange on a number<br />
of occasions and have spoken to Papua New Guinea Prime<br />
Minister Wingti. our diplomatic missions in the region are<br />
conveying our views to the Governments of other South<br />
Pacific countries and are reporting their views to us.<br />
I will have an excellent and very timely opportunity to talk<br />
about events in Fiji with South Pacific leaders at the South<br />
Pacific Forum meeting in Apia in just over a week. </p>
<p>A most important consideration is that in influencing the<br />
course of events in Fiji the sense of direction conveyed by<br />
the collective views of Fiji's neighbours will be of great<br />
importance. Those deciding how to resolve the crisis in<br />
Fiji will have to be conscious of the importance to Fiji of<br />
its reputation in the South Pacific region and of its ties<br />
with neighbouring countries.<br />
For this reason, also, I attach considerable weight to<br />
maintaining close consultation and co-operation with our<br />
neighbours in the South Pacific.<br />
Clearly the development of exact means of restoring<br />
democratic processes in Fiji must be principally a matter<br />
for the people of Fiji themselves. But Australia can, by<br />
its own posture and actions, help facilitate the process and<br />
impress the need for the effort in Fiji to proceed with<br />
speed and determination. Because of our own national<br />
interest and our longstanding friendship with Fiji and its<br />
people we cannot ignore a responsibility to do so.<br />
In the light of these considerations Cabinet discussed a<br />
number of options. It noted that I have already suggested<br />
to Commonwealth Secretary-General Ramphal that he issue a<br />
statement in support of maintaining the democratic process<br />
in Fiji under the existing constitution. I appreciate his<br />
prompt response. actions already taken by the Government in<br />
response to last week's coup have been<br />
a freeze on the initiation of any new Australian aid<br />
activities suspension of a range of activities in the defence<br />
co-operation field, involving:-<br />
no new defence co-operation activities<br />
suspension of all routine RAN visits and 4RAAF<br />
flights suspension of plans for future activities with, and<br />
delivery of new equipment to, the Fiji armed forces<br />
n~ o acceptance of further Fiji Armed Forces<br />
personnel for training in Australia<br />
on the day of the coup instructions were given to<br />
Australian advisory personnel in Fiji to continue<br />
to report for duty but to avoid action that would<br />
be seen as outside their status as Australian<br />
Defence Co-operation personnel. </p>
<p>In addition Cabinet has today decided on a number of<br />
important new steps:<br />
The bilateral officials talks with Fiji scheduled for<br />
June have been cancelled.<br />
We will intensify dialogue with other countries about<br />
the situation in Fiji. One purpose will be to<br />
encourage other Governments to make absolutely clear<br />
their opposition to the Fiji coup and their demand for<br />
the full restoration of democracy there<br />
a special effort will be made to talk with other<br />
Com~ monwealth countries.<br />
In addition, it has been decided that Australia should<br />
seek an exchange of views on the Fiji crisis with our<br />
fellow members of the South Pacific Forum. Those<br />
soundings have already begun as part of our continuing<br />
dialogue however, the South Pacific Forum Meeting in Apia at<br />
the end of the month will provide a valuable<br />
opportunity for leaders of the regional countries<br />
directly concerned to consider what scope there<br />
might be for us together to signal our support for<br />
the restoration of democracy in Fiji.<br />
And, in the defence co-operation area, Australian<br />
Defence Force Advisory personnel now serving in Fiji<br />
have been instructed not to report for duty and<br />
training of Fiji military personnel at present in<br />
Australia has been suspended.<br />
Cabinet examined a number of possible economic measures<br />
including aid which could serve to bring home the depth of<br />
Australia's concern to the authorities in Fiji. It<br />
concluded that the measures reviewed should remain on the<br />
table, but that this was not the time for quick recourse to<br />
economic pressures. The immediate and spontaneous effects<br />
on Fiji's economy of the attack on constitutional rule were<br />
in any case severe and may well intensify unless normality<br />
is rapidly restored. These heavy economic penalties on Fiji<br />
will be difficult to retrieve and are likely, if left<br />
unchecked, to damage permanently the existing base for the<br />
economic welfare of all Fiji citizens. Cabinet took the<br />
view that all responsible figures in Fiji should be acutely<br />
aware of this prospect in considering the future course of<br />
events in their country. </p>
<p>PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIANS<br />
The Cabinet today also agreed details of contingency<br />
planning to evac-uate Australian citizens from Fiji should<br />
this be required.<br />
As I have repeatedly made clear, my Government unequivocally<br />
rejects any suggestion that it would intervene with military<br />
force to influence the political processes now underway in<br />
Fiji. Australian contingency planning only addresses the<br />
possible need to protect the safety of Australian citizens<br />
in Fiji should civil order there deteriorate.<br />
The Government's absolute priority in this situation, as in<br />
all circumstances, is to preserve the safety and welfare of<br />
Australian citizens.<br />
It is the Government's strongest hope that emergency<br />
evacuation measures would not be required. The Government<br />
is conscious of the measures being undertaken to reduce<br />
tensions in the country and that at the present time the<br />
situation is relatively calm. However, the Government is<br />
also conscious that acts of violence have occurred and that<br />
there is a potential risk to Australian citizens in Fiji.<br />
Circumstances at the moment do not require the evacuation of<br />
Australian citizens, and the Government has no information<br />
to indicate that expatriates in Fiji, including Australians,<br />
are in any immediate danger.<br />
The Government nevertheless considers that prudent<br />
responsibility to its citizens requires it to make provision<br />
for the oossible evacuation of Australians from Fiji.<br />
To achieve this, it is expected that the operations of<br />
international airlines serving Fiji should be able to meet<br />
the needs of those Australian citizens who might wish to<br />
leave. The Government is keeping in close contact with<br />
Qantas on arrangements for this.<br />
However, the Government must also take account of the<br />
possibility that civil operations may need to be<br />
supplemented by other means, including assistance by<br />
elements of the Australian Defence Force. on the advice of<br />
the Chief of the Defence Force, the Government has examined<br />
a range of planning options to meet a variety of possible<br />
scenarios. These include the use of:<br />
civil aircraft<br />
a combination of civil and military aircraft<br />
military aircraft only, and<br />
naval ships. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Cabinet noted that because of pre-programmed visits to the<br />
South Pacific there were already five RAN ships in the<br />
immediate vicinity of Fiji ( HMAS Sydney, Adelaide, Stalwart,<br />
Wollongong and Cessnock). The Government has decided those<br />
ships will remain in the area for the time being. In<br />
addition, HIKAS Success, the Fleet Underway Replenishment<br />
ship has sailed for the Fiji area today ( 21 May) to support<br />
the continued operation of the RAN ships already in the<br />
ar ea<br />
Cabinet also noted that HMAS Tobruk left Sydney today en<br />
route to Apia, Western Samoa, to provide accommodation -and<br />
other support for the South Pacific Forum meeting on 29,<br />
may. Advantage may be taken of this deployment to have<br />
additional support available for the possible movement of<br />
Australian citizens from Fiji.<br />
Because of the large number of Australians in Fiji and the<br />
potential complexity of any evacuation, should it be<br />
required, some additional personnel may be embarked in HMAS<br />
Tobruk for transfer to the other ships in the Fiji area<br />
where they would remain unless required. The personnel,<br />
consisting of an army company ( about 110 personnel) from the<br />
operational Deployment Force based in Townsville, have been<br />
placed on notice and may be flown to Norfolk island to join<br />
HKAS Tobruk if required.<br />
I wish to stress that the only purpose in embarking the<br />
company would be to assist in any evacuation operation,<br />
including assistance with the security of Australian<br />
citizens and the provision of administrative and<br />
communications support for that operation. This would be<br />
the minimum number of personnel for such a task and would be<br />
totally inadequate for any broader purpose.<br />
I have released these details so that there will be no<br />
misunderstanding of the purpose of the Australian Defence<br />
Force units near Fiji. I emphasise that there is no current<br />
intention to evacuate Australians from Fiji and that this<br />
is simply prudent contingency planning. Should<br />
circumstances arise where evacuation becomes necessary this<br />
would be announced by the Government and arranged through<br />
the Australian High Commission.<br />
The Government will maintain its present close contacts with<br />
other countries which have similiar interests in the<br />
situation about possible cooperative efforts in the event<br />
that evacuation becomes neccessary. </p>
