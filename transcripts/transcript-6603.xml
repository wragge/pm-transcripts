PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON 5AA, ADELAIDE, 4 MARCH 1985<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: Well, that's a very relevant question which doesn't lend<br />
itself to an easy slick answer. Just let me take a little bit of<br />
time on it. The Americans say that they don't want the ANZUS<br />
Treaty to be torn up. They want it to stay in place there so that<br />
if at some later time the New Zealanders change their attitude,<br />
normal relations can be resumed under it. But they say,<br />
correctly, that the nature of the relations have changed as a<br />
result of the New Zealand decision. So they want to keep the<br />
bilateral relations between the United States and New Zealand as<br />
strong and effective and functioning as possible. And so do we.<br />
That is between Australia and the United States. similarly,<br />
as far as we are concerned between Australia and New Zealand we<br />
want to keep the relationship effective because we are the two<br />
major powers in the South Pacific area and there are obligations<br />
and responsibilities that attach to that status. And the<br />
Americans understand that. So what is really happening now is<br />
that I have asked Mr Beazley and Mr Hayden to prepare a detailed<br />
submission for the Cabinet which we will consider within the next<br />
week, I would think I think the week after this one in which<br />
the detailed implications of that philosphy that I have just put<br />
are spelt out. That is, Australia, the Australian Government<br />
remains totally committed to the Alliance relationship with the<br />
United States and we are going to see that everything involved in<br />
that relationship is maintained. At the same time we want to<br />
maintain an effective relationship with New Zealand so we have got<br />
to see what is involved in doing that. At the same time, and I<br />
make this final point, as a result of the United States decision<br />
that it will not pass on US-sourced intelligence to New Zealand,<br />
we must and will respect that so that that requires also some<br />
detailed planning in that any mixed source intelligence has got to<br />
bhe looked at so that nothing of United States origin goes onto New<br />
Zealand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible. </p>

PM: Well we must and we will. I mean, the United States<br />
relationship is fundamental as far as this Government is<br />
concerned. And I have made that clear from the time I first<br />
campaigned in 1983. It remains central in our international<br />
relationships. That doesn't mean, of course, as I have said, that<br />
we are subservient to the United States, that we won't have*<br />
different points of view to them on particular issues. We do and<br />
we will, but nevertheless that alliance relationship is central.<br />
We will continue to accept our obligations under that relationship<br />
of hosting joint facilities, of making our ports available for<br />
visits of United States ships under that alliance. These things<br />
will remain. We are not in the business of punishing New Zealand,<br />
but what New Zealand itself has to understand that as a result of<br />
its own autonomous decision that there will be certain reactions<br />
in respect of its relationship with the United States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible.<br />
PM: n No, well the United States would not be expecting that this<br />
Australian Government would in fact impose sanctions upon New<br />
Zealand. They wouldn't expect us to, nor have they in any sense<br />
asked us, but the problem for New Zealand rather comes as a result<br />
of its own decisions vis a vis the United States. I mean, that<br />
will be a decision which as time goes on they will no doubt have<br />
to assess. I believe that they did not expect the extent of<br />
reaction that has already taken place, but I have made it-clear<br />
from the beginning, Leighton, that this Government is not in the<br />
business of trying to pressure New Zealand. I mean, it has to<br />
make up its own mind where it goes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible.<br />
PM: OK, Leighton, thank you very much. Best wishes. </p>
