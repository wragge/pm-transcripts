CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CITIZENSHIP CEREMONY<br />
TAMWORTH 26 JANUARY 1989<br />
Let me first of all extend my congratulations and thanks to<br />
the Tamworth City Council for organising this important<br />
ceremony today.<br />
This Australia Day, citizenship ceremonies are being held in<br />
towns and cities throughout Australia. They are all part of<br />
the special effort we are making this year, the Year of<br />
Citizenship, to encourage people to take up the rights and<br />
obligations of full membership of the Australian community.<br />
Tamworth has done a fine job, not just in administering the<br />
oaths and affirmations of citizenship but also in reminding<br />
us that those formal declarations of commitment to our<br />
nation are of deep significance for all of us.<br />
Mr Mayor,<br />
I am told you have forgone the opportunity to visit the<br />
United States in order to be here today. May I pass on,<br />
through you, to your Council and to the people of Tamworth<br />
my thanks for their efforts today.<br />
It's probably fairly typical of the laid-back Australian<br />
style that we usually spend Australia Day enjoying ourselves<br />
like thousands of people do annually at the Country Music<br />
Festival here in Tamworth.<br />
But Australia Day is also an occasion to celebrate our<br />
identity as Australians and our unity as a nation. It is a<br />
day for reflecting on what we are today and what we might<br />
become.<br />
Australia Day last year, in our Bicentennial year, was<br />
particularly significant. But every Australia Day gives us<br />
an opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation<br />
and we have a lot to celebrate.<br />
In particular, Australia Day is a very fitting time for<br />
ceremonies such as this, at which we enlarge the family of<br />
Australian citizens.<br />
I </p>
<p>So having thanked our Tamworth hosts, I now want to direct<br />
some particular comments to these twenty five people who are<br />
our guests of honour today our twenty five new fellow<br />
citizens. You men and women have just taken one of the most important<br />
decisions that anyone could take in their life. You have<br />
declared publicly your commitment to the country you have<br />
made your home.<br />
You have come to Australia and to Tamworth from many<br />
different nations Britain, France, Laos, New Zealand,<br />
Portugal and Singapore.<br />
Now as Australians,-you have taken on all the rights and<br />
obligations of Australian citizenship.<br />
You have made a conscious declaration one that those of us<br />
who were born here are not required to make.<br />
So this occasion gives us all an opportunity to consider<br />
carefully what citizenship means.<br />
Being Australian means many things.<br />
It means sharing an identity as Australians in the midst of<br />
our tremendous diversity of origins and backgrounds.<br />
It means having pride in the diversity of our multicultural<br />
society, and in the values of fairness, equity and<br />
understanding which have created it.<br />
It means taking responsibility for the future prosperity and<br />
harmony of our country.<br />
But above all else, being an Australian means having a<br />
commitment to Australia.<br />
As I said on this day last year, during our Bicentennial<br />
celebrations on Sydney Harbour, the one thing needed to be<br />
an Australian is commitment to this country and to its<br />
future.<br />
The way you look, the way you dress, the faith you observe,<br />
the place you were born they are all important things but<br />
they are irrelevant to the question of whether you are a<br />
fair-dinkum Australian.<br />
What is relevant is your commitment to our parliamentary<br />
institutions, to the rule of law, to freedom of speech, to<br />
our values of tolerance and a fair go for all in short,<br />
your commitment to Australia.<br />
Citizenship is the best expression of that commitment and<br />
Tamworth is a great place to celebrate it.<br />
Tamworth is a living proof that Australia is, at heart, a<br />
nation of immigrants. </p>
<p>We perhaps tend to associate immigration with the inner<br />
suburbs of the great cities, but that's only because those<br />
areas tend to be home to the people who are the most recent<br />
arrivals in this country.<br />
The truth, of course, is that over our two hundred year<br />
history every part of our nation has been influenced and<br />
enriched by the hard work and commitment of immigrants and<br />
the descendants of immigrants.<br />
Before 1788, the Tamworth district was originally the home<br />
of the Kamillaroi Aboriginal people.<br />
Then it was the Scots who laid the foundations of the great<br />
New England pas. toral industries.<br />
Then it was the Chinese and the Americans and others from<br />
around the world who came to the gold fields.<br />
As the Mayor has already said, Tamworth today has a<br />
population made up of people from every part of the world<br />
a microcosm of mankind.<br />
Australia will continue to accept immigrants who contribute<br />
to our economic growth and prosperity through their skills<br />
and business investment.<br />
And we will continue to do so using selection procedures<br />
that are utterly free of discrimination on grounds of race.<br />
The days of the White Australia policy are dead and buried.<br />
Australia also has a proud record in acknowledging our<br />
international humanitarian responsibilities by accepting for<br />
resettlement people who have been affected by war or tragedy<br />
in their country of birth.<br />
The people of Tamworth have shared in this responsibility.<br />
Over the past 10 years the Tamworth Uniting Church and St<br />
Peter's Anglican Church have helped to resettle a large<br />
number of Laotian refugee families.<br />
Today Tamworth has one of the largest Laotian communities<br />
outside Melbourne and Sydney, and I am delighted that some<br />
of the members of this community have become Australian<br />
citizens today.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Today is a day of anniversaries.<br />
We're probably all a bit blase about celebrating<br />
anniversaries, having just had the Bicentenary which I<br />
know in Tamworth coincided with the one hundredth<br />
anniversary of Tamworth becoming the first town in Australia<br />
to use electric street lighting.<br />
But we should still recall the significance of today. </p>
<p>It is of course the 201st anniversary of European settlement<br />
of this continent.<br />
It is the fortieth anniversary of the introduction of the<br />
Chifley Government's Nationality and Citizenship Act the<br />
law that created for the first time the legal concept of<br />
Australian citizenship.<br />
The Bill had been introduced into Parliament the previous<br />
September, and it was on the 40th anniversary of that<br />
occasion last year that I announced 1988-89 would be a Year<br />
of Citizenship.<br />
During this Year of Citizenship I want to draw attention to<br />
what it means to be an Australian citizen, and I want to<br />
encourage as many people as possible who are qualified to<br />
take up Australian citizenship, but have not yet done so, to<br />
make that public affirmation of their commitment to this<br />
country. I have written recently to all Australian households about<br />
the importance of citizenship, and encouraging those who are<br />
not citizens to think carefully about taking this big step.<br />
The example set by these twenty five new citizens is a<br />
valuable element of the Year of Citizenship an example I<br />
hope will be followed by many more people throughout the<br />
Year.<br />
As the Year of Citizenship TV advertisements say, to become<br />
an Australian all you have to do is swear that is to make<br />
a public declaration of your commitment.<br />
I said today marks a number of anniversaries. Today also<br />
breaks something of a drought for Tamworth.<br />
I am told that a search of your records has revealed the<br />
astonishing fact that before today, no Prime Minister had<br />
visited Tamworth for more than sixty-six years.<br />
Billy Hughes made the last visit in 1922.<br />
I don't know why all those Prime Ministers since then missed<br />
out on the warmth of your hospitality.<br />
Billy Hughes was a remarkable man but I am sure he wasn't as<br />
warmly welcomed as I have been.<br />
Then again, Billy Hughes didn't bring Slim Dusty to town.<br />
Slim Dusty is going to play for us shortly and I am sure<br />
that even in the tough competition of the 17th Country Music<br />
Festival he will as usual be a hit.<br />
And may I say how delighted I am to have had the chance to<br />
hear Eric Bogle, Ted Egan, Norma Murphy, and John Williamson<br />
at this ceremony.<br />
There's a very relevant lesson to be learned from country<br />
music in Australia.<br />
I I </p>
<p>Country music has its origins in other parts of the world.<br />
But Australian country music artists have moulded and<br />
adapted it, imbued it with their own spirit and their own<br />
experience. They have given it a distinctively and<br />
genuinely Australian character.<br />
In particular, country music is a place where black and<br />
white Australians have found common ground. Black artists<br />
as well as white have left their mark on the country music<br />
tradition and have been very popular entertainers.<br />
So like so much that is great about this nation, country<br />
music has its roots elsewhere.<br />
But who would say that the Tamworth Festival is not one of<br />
the great celebrations of Australian culture?<br />
I would like to conclude by addressing myself once more to<br />
the people who have become citizens.<br />
You join more than two million others who have made this<br />
declaration during the past 40 years since the introduction<br />
of that Chifley Government Act.<br />
Many different paths have brought you here.<br />
You represent many different backgrounds and many different<br />
histories. But you all have in common the wish to declare<br />
yourselves proudly as Australians.<br />
As Prime Minister of Australia I am proud to welcome you as<br />
Australians and as fellow citizens.<br />
From now on, we can work together as fellow Australians to<br />
ensure this nation's future prosperity, peace and freedom. I </p>
