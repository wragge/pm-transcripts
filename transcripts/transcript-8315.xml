PRIME MIN! STER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 JULY 1991<br />
I am shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Dr Victor<br />
Chang's death. His is a loss which all Australians will<br />
feel. Dr Chang's enormous contribution to cardio-vascular medicine<br />
was recognised worldwide.<br />
Many Australians and, indeed, people from throughout the<br />
region, owe their lives to Dr Chang's exceptional skill,<br />
dedication and energy.<br />
The high regard in which Dr Chang was held was properly<br />
recognised in 1986 when he received the AC.<br />
I extend my deepest sympathy to Dr Chang's widow, Anne, and<br />
family. 3 1 </p>
