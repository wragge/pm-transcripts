FOR PRESS: PM No. 17/ 1971<br />
MEETING WITH FINANCE CONFER] ENCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister,. Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime M1iister, Treasurer and the Governor of<br />
the Reserve Bank today met with representatives of the<br />
Australian Finance Conference.<br />
The object of the meeting was to discuss ways by<br />
which the Finance Companies and the Government could<br />
co-operate should it be necessary to a-ct in the future against<br />
possible inflationary consumer demand.<br />
Consumer demand is not at present significantly<br />
contributing to increased prices.<br />
It was agreed that information would be exchanged<br />
regularly between the Reserve Bank ari-, d the members of the<br />
Conference, so that a month by month watch could be kept<br />
on developments, and so that, if it were necessary in the<br />
future to take any action, the Conference and the Government<br />
would meet to co-operate in such action.<br />
