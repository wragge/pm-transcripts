TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH NATIONAL AUSTRALIA DAY CONCERT 29/ l/ 85<br />
PM: Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever the measure of greatness of<br />
our nation, and I believe it is very considerable indeed, it<br />
arises because through the years we have absorbed the best that<br />
has been brought here from many countries of the world by the<br />
men and women who have come to make this their home and because<br />
we have fashioned ourselves, our attitudes, and our institutions<br />
in a distinctive way which reflects the realities of our<br />
continent. While I think we can not always extoll everything in our past,<br />
we have repudiated the concept of proprietorship for those who<br />
inhabited this land before European settlement, while at the same<br />
time subsequently often being less than generous in sharing + his<br />
land of ours with those who have come here.<br />
But nevertheless, we have on this national day very considerable<br />
reasons to smile. We should indeed be very grateful to all<br />
those who have cone before us for so having conducted themselves<br />
that we can this day in 1985 truly assert that Australia is one<br />
of the few really vibrant democracies in the world where the<br />
commitment to the liberty and the freedom of expression of the<br />
individual is sadly diminishing.<br />
W e are also a's a nation of less than 16 million people in a world<br />
of 4.8 billion entitled indeed to be proud of the many<br />
contributions that Australian men and women have made in the<br />
fields of art, music, letters, architecture, sport indeed a<br />
remarkable contribution.<br />
So while this is a time of remembrance and a time for gratitude<br />
for those who have gone before, a time to balance pride w-ith<br />
considerations of the past, and also, I believe, a time when we<br />
have to contemplate the challenges of the present and of the<br />
future. Particularly I think that is true as this 1985 is<br />
International Youth Year.<br />
There are many of our young people today in Australia who have<br />
reasoned cause to doubt our commitment to giving them a sense of<br />
security and fulfillment in the Australian future.<br />
This is a great country with its unlimited resources, I believe,<br />
and we have the capacity to make that commitment to them, to<br />
make it real. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
So I would ask, as Prime Minister of Australia, that today<br />
on our national day we should all pledge ourselves to making<br />
that commitment a reality in the future so that their<br />
aspirations shall be met and that in the years ahead they<br />
shall have equal cause with us for pride in this great country. </p>
