<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Small Business Chris Bowen today announced a new $2 million Queensland Natural Disaster Assistance program to help small businesses impacted by recent natural disasters to access expert advice and assistance so they can recover and grow.</p>
<p>The program  -  part of the Australian Government's Small Business Advisory Services initiative  -  will provide vital help to hard-working small business men and women impacted by ex-Tropical Cyclone Oswald.</p>
<p>The Queensland Natural Disaster Assistance program will help local small businesses recover from the recent devastating natural disaster by increasing access to expert advice and tailored business services.</p>
<p>Small businesses are the backbone of local communities and we know that many have been impacted, either directly or indirectly, by flooding and other natural disasters.</p>
<p>This program is about making sure these businesses are able to bounce back and continue to be vital parts of their communities and the local economy.</p>
<p>The program will provide funding to not-for-profit advisory organisations like Business Enterprise Centres or Registered Business Organisations, which in turn will offer expert low cost business advice, including referral services to other available support that meet the needs of Queensland businesses.</p>
<p>The program will provide total funding of $2 million over two years, for around ten business advisory projects that will receive around $100,000 per annum.</p>
<p>Applications received from eligible applicants for grant funding will be assessed on their merits in a competitive process. This program will be delivered by AusIndustry.</p>
<p>A similar program  -  the Small Business Advisory Services National Disaster Assistance program  -  ran in 2011 and helped around 3,700 businesses in about a 12 month period.</p>
<p>Businesses or advisory organisations looking to register their interest for assistance should contact the AusIndustry hotline on 13 28 46 or through <a href="http://www.ausindustry.gov.au">www.ausindustry.gov.au</a>.</p>
