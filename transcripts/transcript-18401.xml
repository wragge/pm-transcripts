    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Today Kevin Rudd has tendered his resignation as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr Rudd was a strong and effective advocate for Australia's interests overseas.During his period of service as Foreign Minister there were many achievements. He strongly pursued Australia's interests in the world.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that the concerns Mr Rudd has publicly expressed this evening were never personally raised with me, nor did he contact me to discuss his resignation prior to his decision.I plan to hold a press conference tomorrow to make a further statement.</p>
