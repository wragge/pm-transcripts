PRIINMISET E<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELITVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL, DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
WORKPLACE AUSTRALIA CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 27 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
Let me at the very outset congratulate the organisers of<br />
this important Conference.<br />
It is apparent that you are endeavouring to get to grips, in<br />
a serious and genuine way, with an issue of vital importance<br />
to the Australian economy and I applaud you for that.<br />
It is my hope that the lessons learned here will spread out<br />
to all enterprises seeking workplace reform and that, by<br />
extension, the benefits of reform will be felt and<br />
appreciated throughout the community.<br />
The issues under discussion here go to the heart of my<br />
Government's reform program.<br />
Creating a more productive and internationally competitive<br />
economy the ultimate goal of our policies depends<br />
critically crn fostering more efficient workplaces around the<br />
country. I believe we! have made significant progress but I<br />
recognise that we have still got a long way to go.<br />
Because we 2are engaged not in some piecemeal or halfhearted<br />
exercise, bUt in nothing less than a thoroughgoing<br />
transformation of the institutions of the Australian economy<br />
and the attitudes of the Australian people to their work.<br />
To illustrate the magnitude of that transformation, I<br />
thought it wrould be relevant tonight if I provided you with<br />
some personal reflections on the changes in the industrial<br />
relations scene over the last two decades.<br />
Certainly if' I look back over that period I see the proof of<br />
a massive and fundamental transformation. </p>
<p>In 1980, when I concluded my term as President of the<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions and decided to enter<br />
Federal Parliament, the Australian workplace, and the<br />
industrial relations system in general, were still broadly<br />
dominated by the institutions and attitudes that had<br />
characterised the relationship between employers and<br />
employees in this country for decades in some cases, since<br />
Federation; in other cases, since the birth of trade<br />
unionism in this country.<br />
It was an essentially adversarial relationship, in which<br />
each side of an industrial negotiation would interpret<br />
success in that negotiation by the amount of concessions it<br />
had extracted from the other side.<br />
Inevitably, legitimate campaigns for improved wages and<br />
working conditions became poisoned by these deeply ingrained<br />
attitudes of competition and confrontation. It was, too<br />
often, what is now called a zero sum game: the gains of one<br />
side were measured by, and achieved through, the losses of<br />
the other.<br />
At the same time, the structures of industrial relations<br />
compounded these attitudinal problems. The venerable but<br />
archaic structures of craft-based unionism, the Byzantine<br />
divisions of jurisdiction arising from Australia's Federal<br />
structure, and, where they existed, the antiquated employer<br />
organisations, were all relics inherited from a former era.<br />
Their relevance to and efficiency in a modern economy was<br />
questionable:. And if this were not enough, the Federal Government itself<br />
was set on a deliberate campaign of exacerbating these<br />
problems and exploiting them for short-term political gain.<br />
I do not mean these comments in a solely partisan way<br />
although it is true, utterly true, that the conservative<br />
parties of this nation have never deviated from a philosophy<br />
of deliberate industrial relations confrontation; nor do<br />
they deviate from it today.<br />
My point is more fundamental. The Federal Government is the<br />
largest employer in the economy, the manager of the national<br />
economy, and the creator of the legislative environment in<br />
which industrial relations are conducted.<br />
If such a body is determined to play the arsonist, as the<br />
Federal Government so clearly was in the early 1980s, then<br />
the whole economy can be consumed in the flames. And the<br />
recession of 1982-83 was indeed a very destructive bushfire.<br />
So both in its attitudes and in its structures, the<br />
Australian industrial relations system at the start of the<br />
last decade was simply not equipped to cope with the<br />
legitimate expectations of the Australian people. A modern<br />
economy, undergoing a revolution in technology, and facing<br />
the emerging challenges of a dynamic region deserved better. </p>
<p>Today, we can say that a better system is being built.<br />
There have been four major elements at work.<br />
First, and most importantly, there is a new maturity on the<br />
part of all employers, employees, their organisations and<br />
government in Australia.<br />
I do not pretend that individuals and groups are no longer<br />
motivated by self-interest. But I do say that there is a<br />
sharper awareness that the unbridled, adversarial, pursuit<br />
of self-interest does not yield the desired benefits; indeed<br />
that in the long run it is counter-productive and<br />
unsustainable. And there is an increasing awareness that different groups<br />
and individuals in fact share many aims that can be advanced<br />
by cooperation rather than confrontation.<br />
This is no mere point of sociological speculation. It is a<br />
truth, that has been embodied in the Accord between the<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labor Government,<br />
first formulated in 1983.<br />
The Accord has achieved what for Australia previously was an<br />
unattainable double: sustained real wage restraint combined<br />
with dramatic improvements in the social wage.<br />
Under the Accord, wage restraint means higher profits,<br />
opening the door to higher investment and at an<br />
unprecedented rate of growth more jobs.<br />
Social wage increases have taken the form of, for example,<br />
massive improvements in the level of assistance afforded to<br />
low income families. At the same time, wage-tax trade of fs<br />
and superannuation increases have, under the Accord,<br />
increased the overall fairness of Australian society, and<br />
provided greater flexibility in the choice of outcomes of<br />
industrial negotiations.<br />
And from the employers' point of view, put quite simply, the<br />
community through the social wage has picked up part of what<br />
would otherwise have been their wages bill. That is good<br />
for employers it is good for the community.<br />
In this achievement it is necessary to pay unstinting<br />
tribute to trade union leaders who decided, in 1983 and<br />
since, not to exercise industrial muscle to achieve<br />
immediate wages goals in other words, not to plunge us<br />
back into the high inflation, high unemployment nightmare of<br />
the early 1980s.<br />
As a result, the current recession is totally different in<br />
character from that which Australians endured in 1982-83.<br />
People are certainly experiencing hardship I have never<br />
sought to deny that. But I always make this fundamental<br />
point: the hardship today won't be for nought as it was at<br />
the start of the last decade. </p>
<p>This time around, we are getting inflation under control.<br />
Inflation today is low and falling with an underlying rate<br />
of 5.4 per cent. So the pain now will be a gain later an<br />
enduring gain for the national economy as a whole.<br />
A related manifestation of the new maturity in Australian<br />
industrial relations is the dramatic reduction in industrial<br />
disputation. The average days lost through strikes is<br />
currently significantly less than half the level of the<br />
Fraser Government years. That is not some point of idle<br />
statistical curiosity but the proof of a fundamental shift<br />
in attitudes of flexibility rather than rigid<br />
intransigence.<br />
The second characteristic of our improved industrial<br />
relations is related to the first. The new maturity<br />
displayed by all sides has allowed a realistic and effective<br />
process of tripartite planning to achieve industry-wide and<br />
economy-wide goals of fundamental importance.<br />
The Steel Plan rescued the Australian steel industry from<br />
virtual shut-down and has allowed Australia to become an<br />
active and competitive exporter of steel products.<br />
In the Passenger Motor Vehicle industry and in textiles,<br />
clothing and footwear, we have been able to achieve<br />
considerable tariff reductions for the overall benefit of<br />
the Australian economy. The restructuring this has forced on<br />
the industries with pain for particular producers and<br />
employees has been eased by tripartite consultation<br />
leading to effective retraining and improved work practices.<br />
And in industries where more recently the Federal Government<br />
is tackling the essential issues of micro-economic reform<br />
on the waterfront, coastal shipping, and land transport<br />
progress is being made not through confrontation but through<br />
careful preparation and consultation with all the parties<br />
who will be affected by change.<br />
The third characteristic is that the inherited and<br />
antiquated structures of our industrial relations system are<br />
being overhauled.<br />
Rigid and outdated awards are being restructured into modern<br />
schemes that reflect the training and skills of the<br />
workforce and the requirements of a technologically<br />
advanced, competitive economy.<br />
Spectacular improvements have been seen in the metal<br />
industry, where the number of job classifications has been<br />
reduced from more than 300 to 14 broad bands. The<br />
Australian shipping award has been reformed to allow reduced<br />
crew levels, improved career paths, broadbanded job<br />
classifications and better training programs. </p>
<p>Throughout the economy, award restructuring will deliver to<br />
employers increased productivity, better industrial<br />
relations and a more highly skilled and adaptable workforce.<br />
Employees will achieve greater job variety, better pay,<br />
incentives to enhance their skills and new career paths.<br />
And it has to be understood that none of this is possible<br />
without the co-operation and commitment of managers,<br />
unionists and employees.<br />
At the same time we are rationalising the structures of<br />
unions themselves. Recent legislative amendments increase<br />
the minimum size of union membership for registration, while<br />
also providing for speedier, more effective amalgamation<br />
procedures. A modern union structure rationalised along<br />
industry lines reduces the number of unions with which an<br />
employer would need to negotiate and minimises the<br />
possibility of futile demarcation disputes.<br />
The ACTU Executive has supported the Government's efforts to<br />
rationalise union coverage and has made union<br />
rationalisation through amalgamation a major objective of<br />
its strategy for the 1990s. So far this financial year 41<br />
unions have taken action to rationalise their coverage, with<br />
of these amalgamations successfully completed.<br />
An example of progress to date is the amalgamation of the<br />
Amalgamated Metal Workers' Union with the Association of<br />
Draughting, Supervising and Technical Employees to form the<br />
Metals and Engineering Workers' Union. In the health sector,<br />
the Hospital Employees' Federation of Australia has<br />
amalgamated with the Health and Research Employees<br />
Association of Australia to form the Health Services Union<br />
of Australia.<br />
Five unions in the banking, insurance and wool-broking<br />
sector are proceeding with a proposed union amalgamation<br />
that will substantially rationalise union coverage within<br />
the sector. It is anticipated that the pace of reform will<br />
accelerate now that the legislation is in place and with<br />
continued government assistance to facilitate the legal<br />
processes. Approximately 80 unions are expected to be<br />
affected by the recent amendments.<br />
We are also moving to rationalise State and Federal<br />
industrial relations systems, including through the dual<br />
appointment of senior members of the State Industrial<br />
Tribunals to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.<br />
This will allow disputes to be referred from one tribunal to<br />
another and -will enable joint sittings.<br />
Clearly there is much more than can be done here. The<br />
process of Federal-State rationalisation that I initiated<br />
through the Special Premiers Conference last year may<br />
produce a complete referral of State industrial relations<br />
powers. This would be a decisive and effective solution to a<br />
deep-seated -problem and it is certainly an outcome I would<br />
be happy to consider. I note that some States, though not<br />
all, favour * a referral of their powers in this field. </p>
<p>A fourth broad characteristic of the emerging Australian<br />
workplace is the widespread acceptance of the relevance and<br />
the importance of education and training.<br />
A clever country is one whose international competitiveness<br />
depends not just on the physical resources of the country<br />
but on its human resources. A strong skills base means a<br />
workforce that is capable of innovation, of adaption to new<br />
technologies, of opening new industries; it means an economy<br />
capable of earning export income through the quality of its<br />
ideas and its commitment to intellectual excellence.<br />
We are becoming a more clever country. School retention<br />
rates have risen dramatically; the Training Guarantee is<br />
lifting industry investment in training; and new Cooperative<br />
Research Centres are being developed in the universities and<br />
research laboratories of the nation.<br />
And let me make this vital point. Becoming a clever country<br />
doesn't happen by government fiat; job skills are not<br />
something that can be bought off the shelf. What it requires<br />
ultimately is that each of us take responsibility for doing<br />
our own work smarter and better. It will only be when our<br />
workplaces are imbued with that kind of determination that<br />
we will be a truly clever country.<br />
This conference is one valuable means to that goal.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
You will all be aware that the Government is working to<br />
produce a significant statement on economic and industry<br />
policy. I will be delivering the statement to Federal<br />
Parliament on 12 March.<br />
Incidently, I believe it to be desirable that I should<br />
address, briefly, expectations about the 12 March statement.<br />
In it, I will make broad comments about our economic<br />
strategy and I will announce some new measures to facilitate<br />
the kinds of further change we need to make to enhance our<br />
economic prospects. I will address the issues and the<br />
challenges involved in equipping Australia to become an<br />
efficient, competitive economy in an increasingly<br />
competitive world.<br />
The statement will not be some slick and immediate answer to<br />
the pain of the recession. But it will be directed to<br />
ensuring that we capture, in permanent form, the gains that<br />
can come from this period particularly lower inflation<br />
rates comparable with our competitors, and, within that<br />
context, an environment for sustainably lower interest<br />
rates. Naturally I cannot go in any detail to the substance of the<br />
statement. </p>
<p>But I want to make this point, of relevance to this<br />
conference. It should be apparent from all I have said this evening that<br />
I believe Australia has turned an historic corner in<br />
industrial relations.<br />
With the adoption of a more cooperative approach to<br />
industrial relations, Australia has opened the door to the<br />
kinds of positive developments I have outlined tonight a<br />
new maturity in the conduct of industrial relations, a<br />
renewed capacity for tripartite planning, an overhaul of the<br />
inherited institutions that determine the shape of the<br />
workplace; and a new emphasis on education and skills<br />
training. As someone who spent the majority of my pre-Parliamentary<br />
career in industrial relations, I know the magnitude of the<br />
change that has been wrought.<br />
It is, quite simply, not the same system as the one in which<br />
I was a practitioner.<br />
To this extent, we are already proceeding down the right<br />
path. We do not need a U-turn. Our determination must be<br />
to ensure that we are continuing to get the right answers in<br />
place for the future.<br />
I am confident we will work our way through this difficult<br />
period. I am grateful for the practical contribution you<br />
are making, through this conference and through your<br />
commitment to workplace reform, to the attainment of the<br />
broad national goals we all seek. </p>
