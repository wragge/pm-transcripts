<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you happy to be in New Zealand, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Always happy to be in New Zealand.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>And we're thrilled to have him here too by the way.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Yes. It's a beautiful spot this.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what's New Zealand got to teach Australia at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Oh, I think we have a lot to teach each other. We have a lot of shared</p>
<p> history but most importantly we have a shared future as two societies</p>
<p> quite distinctive but having an enormous amount in common. We always</p>
<p> work together very closely. We have a common future in APEC. CER has</p>
<p> been a great success and I think a boom for both countries and I just</p>
<p> find it a naturally close association.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How critical is it for you to see APEC be successful this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, I think long-term APEC offers a great future for all of the</p>
<p> societies that are part of it. And although there were some disappointments</p>
<p> at the Kuala Lumpur meeting, there were a lot of successes, particularly</p>
<p> in relation to remaking the world's financial architecture. And</p>
<p> New Zealand, of course, will be in the chair this year. I'm very</p>
<p> keen to work with Mrs Shipley and I know that Australia will want</p>
<p> to do all it can to make it a very successful meeting and I'm</p>
<p> sure it will be.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what do you think you'll learn about the GST now that</p>
<p> you'll see it up close over the next few days?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, the message I get about the GST out of New Zealand is that it</p>
<p> stopped being an issue years ago and that it's been an absolutely</p>
<p> outstanding success, as it will be in Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, will you be raising the question of East Timor with</p>
<p> Mrs Shipley and would there be any suggestion that you would like</p>
<p> to see New Zealand involved in any joint aid operations or otherwise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure it will come up because it's a very important</p>
<p> regional issue and New Zealand and Australia always work together</p>
<p> in relation to important regional issues. Naturally Australia has,</p>
<p> by dint of history and geography, has an even greater connection with</p>
<p> the area than New Zealand but it's a regional issue. And just</p>
<p> as we work together in relation to Bougainville then the same thing</p>
<p> applies. But I also see particular responsibilities for Australia</p>
<p> given our history and our proximity to the area involved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, do you believe that New Zealand should be involved in</p>
<p> any joint peacekeeping in East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>I think it's early days. I'm very much looking forward to</p>
<p> hearing the briefing from the Prime Minister. Obviously Australia</p>
<p> is very close to Timor and have insights that we will listen to and</p>
<p> take into account. I think it's premature to say what involvement</p>
<p> is required but certainly if peacekeeping is required then that's</p>
<p> something New Zealanders always wanted to contribute. But I think</p>
<p> it's premature to get to that point first.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you feel you're under any pressure from Australia to have</p>
<p> the Auckland APEC be successful?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Not pressure, we have mutual interest in these things. I think the</p>
<p> great success of CER is that it's really an open market of two</p>
<p> countries as free traders by nature. APEC presents huge opportunities</p>
<p> and I've been very grateful to Prime Minister Howard and his</p>
<p> willingness to share both technical and logistical assistance with</p>
<p> New Zealand as we plan for our year. And we have a mutual interest</p>
<p> in being successful and I'm sure we will be.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's the main topic on your agenda for these talks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>I think the APEC issue and seeing that the events of this year are</p>
<p> hugely successful is in our mutual interest. I'm looking forward</p>
<p> to seeing that we take the chance to plan to see that our events and</p>
<p> the events that are going to happen in Australia over the next 18</p>
<p> months or two years, that if there any ways we can boost tourism into</p>
<p> the Australasian region that we take the opportunities to do that</p>
<p> because so many visitors now come to both countries and there may</p>
<p> well be ways we can work together. From own point of view, other than</p>
<p> the bilateral and the CER issues, I'm very interested in hearing</p>
<p> Prime Minister Howard's views on the drug issue. Australia has</p>
<p> been dealing with a very significant increase in heroin recently.</p>
<p> It's something my own government is looking at and I'm looking</p>
<p> forward personally to having a chance to talk to him and get his insights</p>
<p> into how that worked on that issue. So it's a good chance to</p>
<p> deal with domestic issues that we can learn and share with each other</p>
<p> as well as the bilateral issues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the drug issue, Prime Minister, last night in Melbourne two heroin</p>
<p> addicts died of overdoses and 16 addicts had overdoses, do you believe</p>
<p> that now there's time to look more seriously at alternatives</p>
<p> because it's fairly clear that current matters aren't working?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, if you mean by that has my attitude on a heroin trial changed,</p>
<p> well, the answer is no, it hasn't. And I will, over the weeks</p>
<p> ahead, be saying more about this issue and explaining in more detail</p>
<p> why I don't believe a heroin trial is the answer to an admittedly</p>
<p> very difficult problem. Heroin trials in other countries have not</p>
<p> been successful. I invite those who are so enthusiastically advocating</p>
<p> heroin trials in Australia to have a look at the Swedish experience,</p>
<p> to have a look at the Merseyside experience in the United Kingdom,</p>
<p> to have a look at the limited Swiss experience, to have a look at</p>
<p> what is occurring in the United States where that approach has not</p>
<p> been taken. It is a difficult problem and no approach carries all</p>
<p> the answers. And to rather simplistically say every day, well, there</p>
<p> were such and such a number of overdoses therefore you have to embrace,</p>
<p> without much thought, some other approach is not necessarily an answer.</p>
<p> I mean, I am always ready to listen to alternatives but the alternative</p>
<p> of a heroin trial, which has been tried in other countries, is not</p>
<p> one that appeals to me and I can say that the Federal Government is</p>
<p> not disposed to alter its stance on that. We have put an unprecedented</p>
<p> level of resources into fighting drugs on three fronts Â– law</p>
<p> enforcement, treatment and education. Now, the benefits of that Tough</p>
<p> on Drugs strategy are now beginning to flow through but it's</p>
<p> altogether too early to make a judgement because it's only in</p>
<p> the last 12 months or less that the benefits of those additional resources</p>
<p> have begun to flow through. But it is a menace and the idea that in</p>
<p> any way we should suggest that it's acceptable in our society</p>
<p> is not something that I would ever embrace and I think I speak for</p>
<p> millions of Australian parents who do not see the right signal being</p>
<p> sent through the introduction of a heroin trial. So my view has not</p>
<p> changed on that and I will, over the weeks ahead, be saying quite</p>
<p> a bit more about the reasons why my view hasn't changed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be looking to Mr Howard for some advice on how to deal with</p>
<p> difficult MPs that cause you a few problems...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other but I'm sure</p>
<p> we're both capable of managing our own caucuses perfectly satisfactorily</p>
<p> as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've got some advice, you've had to deal with some...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Oh, no, look, I'm absolutely certain that Mrs Shipley can handle</p>
<p> the domestic political situation and I'm looking forward, of</p>
<p> course, as well as talking to her about matters of mutual political</p>
<p> interest between the two countries, one always on gatherings such</p>
<p> as this, one always exchanges notes about domestic politics but I</p>
<p> don't presume to give any advice about the management of New</p>
<p> Zealand political parties. I think anybody who becomes Prime Minister</p>
<p> of a nation has demonstrated very clearly his or her capacity to handle</p>
<p> the domestic politics of that nation without outside advice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, do you have any advice to the Prime Minister on a GST</p>
<p> on food? You'd be aware of the debate in Australia. Would you</p>
<p> be advising him to hold the line and apply it as broadly as possible?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Well, I don't advise the Prime Minister of Australia but clearly</p>
<p> this is an opportunity for us to share information. I've had</p>
<p> a chance to talk to a number of Australian ministers who have come</p>
<p> here to talk about how it works in New Zealand. We've been very</p>
<p> frank with them. I mean, it's a great success in New Zealand.</p>
<p> There's not a single political party of any significance that</p>
<p> is proposing the removal of GST and I think that speaks for itself.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And how was the landing coming in here to Queenstown?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It was a fairly hairy way...</p>
<p>PM:</p>
<p>Oh but, you know, the RAAF pilots are terrific - never miss a beat</p>
<p> when you're with the RAAF.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Jeff Kennett says that immigration numbers in Australia</p>
<p> should be doubled. Given most of our migrants come from New Zealand,</p>
<p> is that something you would consider?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, we're always happy to have people from New Zealand in Australia.</p>
<p> They're always very, very welcome. I think the balance of the</p>
<p> Australian migration programme at the moment is right. We have changed</p>
<p> it since we came to power. We've put a greater emphasis on business</p>
<p> migration. I don't see a case for a dramatic increase at the</p>
<p> moment but it's always been part and parcel of our policy that</p>
<p> we would adjust it over time according to economic and other circumstances.</p>
<p> We have an annual review of migration, that's been the pattern</p>
<p> for years under both Labor and Liberal governments in Australia. There'll</p>
<p> be another submission put by the Minister to the Cabinet fairly soon</p>
<p> and we'll make a decision about next year's intake. But</p>
<p> I don't see a case at the moment for any dramatic change. I think</p>
<p> we have got the mix right. But I'm very happy to have a debate</p>
<p> about this issue in Australia. I always have been. And if people want</p>
<p> to contribute ideas on it, Mr Kennett included, I'm happy for</p>
<p> that. But right at the moment the Australian Government, which of</p>
<p> course makes the final decision on these matters, we think it's</p>
<p> quite a good and a well-balanced programme and a dramatic change next</p>
<p> year is simply not going to happen.</p>
