1 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN THE 7.30 REPORT<br />
E O E<br />
O'BRIEN: John Howard, we'll come back to the media ownership issue in a few moments.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sure we will. I'd be disappointed if we didn't.<br />
O'BRI[ EN:<br />
I knew you would be. Blanket extinguishment of native title, now out of the question<br />
quite clearly in your mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, I don't think is the right way to go. It would create huge uncertainty. It would<br />
potentially cost this country an enormous amount of money and it would inflame a<br />
very difficult debate. The great advantage of my approach is that it totally restores to<br />
farmers the capacity to run and manage their properties without interference from<br />
native title claimants.<br />
O'BRIEN: But you've had endless dialogue with the farmers and with the Queensland Premier.<br />
They seem far from convinced right now. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sorry that's not right. And not all of them are like that. I've had a very useful<br />
dialogue and I continue a very useful dialogue with the National Farmers' Federation.<br />
Now, I'm not going to verbal the federation, I'm not going to say what its view is. It<br />
can speak for itself, and quite rightly because the National Farmers' Federation were<br />
misled in 1993. They are very wary of anything at the present time but I believe that as<br />
pastoralists and farmers understand what is involved in my plan, they receive the<br />
security and reassurance of it, they know that they can run their properties without<br />
interference from native title claimants and they also understand that if we can get<br />
something that is seen by the community as fair and balanced, that will deliver a quick<br />
change rather than a protracted bitter change that might at the end of the day be<br />
subject to constitutional challenge and then you'd be back where we started from.<br />
O'BRIEN: Given the way in which divisions were so stark on this issue, I'm sure you would<br />
understand why there are still many farmers and for that matter aboriginal leaders who<br />
are sceptical that you can deliver the guarantees that you say you are going to deliver<br />
to farmers on the one hand certainty, while at the same time respecting native title.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I can. There's always the case that there had to be some wind-back from Wik,<br />
and I made that plain to the Aboriginal leaders when I first met them a couple of<br />
months ago. There was no way that the Wik pendulum didn't have to come back<br />
towards the centre because Wik delivered far more to the Aborigines than they<br />
themselves expected and what I have tried to do is whilst respecting Native Title, to<br />
veer back closer to the centre so that I'm able to say to the farmers, yes, you can run<br />
your properties without being interfered with, but I'm not going to engage in blanket<br />
extinguishment. One of the problems of blanket extinguishment is that if you wipe out<br />
every potential title on pastoral land then you could be up for a very large<br />
compensation, but then the other problem is that you'd have to use the race power of<br />
the constitution. And although there is legal advice saying that's okay and there's<br />
some court authority for it, I'm not certain that the current High Court wouldn't say<br />
that a detrimental use of the race power was unconstitutional. Now, these are the<br />
sorts of shoals that you would have to negotiate, quite apart from a parliamentary<br />
shoal, if you went down the blanket extinguishment route, but if you go down my<br />
route you don't have that problem yet you deliver the certainty.<br />
O'BRIEN: You were very much at pains before the election and since to say that there'd be no<br />
special interests attracting your patronage in government. Now, you were very strong<br />
this afternoon in saying that farmers would be the last group that you would desert.<br />
You would never desert the farmers.... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes that's a..<br />
O'BRIEN: Almost that the farmers would come first...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's common language to say look it's the last person I'd desert.., what you are really<br />
saying is that you are not going to let them down. It doesn't mean to say you don't<br />
take other people into account. Farmers have done...<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
But the farmers' priority is ahead of Aboriginals<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think the farmers are entitled to want a decent deal out of this whole thing, because<br />
they were told by the former government that they didn't have to worry. They were<br />
told by the preamble of the Native Title Act that they didn't have to worry, and I think<br />
that has got to be delivered on, that commitment, but in a way that doesn't disrespect<br />
Native Title, and I make no apology for the fact that my package will advantage<br />
farmers from where they are now, because where they are now is unfair and<br />
unreasonable and unstable and they are entitled to have their interests looked after.<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
I'm told that there are at least five members at today's backbench committee who will<br />
still accept nothing less than blanket extinguishment which I assume means that they'll<br />
cross the floor. Would it bother you if they did?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there were 21 people present, so if that's right I didn't do too badly 16 out of<br />
21. Look, I think it is premature to talk about people crossing the floor. I'd like to<br />
know what the Labor Party is going to do, what the Democrats are going to do on this<br />
legislation. They can make up their own minds...<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
But what room is there in your mind for compromise in the way of amendments to get<br />
the Labor Party and the Democrats and the Greens on side? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very very little room, no room at all for significant amendments. Tiny-ly at the margin<br />
in relation to the detail yes, but if there is any attempt made to sort of water down the<br />
guarantees and protections that we've put in for farmers that enable them to run their<br />
properties, then the answer is no. If there is any attempt to sort of reintroduce the<br />
complicated right to negotiate procedure which has gummed up the works of the<br />
mining industry in Australia, the answer is no. If on the other hand there are some tiny<br />
changes at the margin that don't act in a detrimental way to those goals then of course<br />
I'll look at them, but I've given a lot of thought to this, I've invested a lot of personal<br />
energy and capital into this. It is a fair plan, it is a balanced plan, I've fought very hard<br />
to get it accepted and I'll go on fighting hard to get it accepted because I believe in it,<br />
and I'm not going to have it tricked around by people who are going to try and gum up<br />
the process again.<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
Well, I guess the question very much comes into focus if you can't get this past the<br />
Senate. Since it is so important to you will you consider a double dissolution.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I will consider what I am going to do if it doesn't go through the Senate when<br />
that eventuality arises.<br />
O'BRIEN: Certainly at this point you're not going to rule out a double dissolution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look Kerry I will give a whole lot of consideration to a * whole lot of things related to<br />
this and I've got a very clear view in my own mind about what I am going to do in<br />
relation to this...<br />
O'BRIEN: Please share it...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, not tonight. . Other subject.<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
But you would agree I'm sure that if it did come to a double dissolution on this issue,<br />
it would be an enormously divisive issue in this country? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Kerry, I have fought very hard to prevent division on this, and that is why I have<br />
unhappily seen myself in conflict with some people on my own side of politics. It's not<br />
something I enjoyed and I've done that in the name of unity, not in the name of<br />
division. I'm the last person who wants to cause division on this, but I say to you and<br />
to the Australian people, this thing has got to be fixed, it has got to be fixed quickly<br />
and it has got to be fixed unambiguously. My plan is the way to do it and I'm<br />
determined to drive that plan through.<br />
O'BRIEN: Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, made a very strong speech today against Pauline<br />
Hanson. Do you agree with his comments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the ones that I've seen to the affect that if you have, for example, no foreign<br />
investment policy in this country, that will destroy thousands of jobs, yes it will. I<br />
don't know what Pauline Hanson's policies are. I don't think anybody does really.<br />
But if she is against foreign investment then she is against the employment of tens of<br />
thousands of Australians. Because if we didn't have foreign investment in this country<br />
we would have a lower standard of living, we would have fewer jobs, fewer industries,<br />
we would not have developed as much as we have. It's easy to score, you know,<br />
cheap shots against foreign investment but every developed country including Australia<br />
owes a great debt to foreign investment because without it we would have to accept a<br />
much lower living standard.<br />
O'BRIEN: You've given the impression in the past that you've been very careful about what<br />
you've chosen to criticise in Pauline Hanson and what you haven't. Alexander<br />
Downer today described her views as offensive and he says it's critical to fight and<br />
destroy the ideas that she's promoting. Do you agree with those expressions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well what I've done in the past Kerry is not to elevate the woman...<br />
O'BRIEN: Well she's been elevated now.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well yeah, I saw a very interesting comment from Michelle Grattan, one of the most<br />
respected members of the Press Gallery in Canberra, on this today and she suggested<br />
that Pauline Hanson had been over indulged with media coverage and perhaps Howard<br />
was right in having said that at the end of last year. I thought it was very interesting </p>
<p>from somebody of Michelle's seniority and balance she doesn't always say nice things<br />
about me but...<br />
O'BRIEN: But that may or may not be true.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well anyway, well I think... . but I think it's a point...<br />
O'BRIEN: The fact is you've now got that problem sitting squarely in your lap.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it's a point worth making. Look, my situation is that if I see a stupid policy<br />
prescription that is going to hurt Australia, I'll attack it. When Pauline Hanson first<br />
made her maiden speech I did repudiate her claim about Aboriginal disadvantage. I did<br />
repudiate her claim about the country being swamped by Asians. On the other hand I<br />
acknowledge that there are a lot of people in this country, and myself included, who<br />
resent being constantly told that our history is a matter of unmitigated shame and<br />
disgrace and that we are a crowd of racists. Because we are not a crowd of racists, we<br />
are a very tolerant society that has welcomed hundreds of thousands, indeed, millions<br />
of people of different races into our ranks and absorbed them in a very harmonious<br />
fashion. O'BRIEN: But do you find her views offensive?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it depends which ones you're talking about. If she's... well no, look, I'm not<br />
mincing words on this because it's very hard to know what she stands for. But if<br />
Pauline Hanson is saying foreign investment is stupid then she's wrong. If she wants<br />
to have...<br />
O'BRIIEN: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If she wants to have a discriminatory immigration policy then I'm against that. </p>
<p>O'BRIEN: Is it offensive?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A discriminatory immigration policy is offensive, yes.<br />
O'BRIEN: The South Australian Premier, John Olsen, came back from South-East Asia last week<br />
warning that the backlash against Australia there was serious as a result of Pauline<br />
Hanson. Do you now agree with that, that Australia is still hurting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, well can I say that is quite contrary to the experience that I've had visiting<br />
those countries. I was in China quite recently, a highly successful visit. And I did not<br />
find that and that was not the message that was conveyed to me by the Australian<br />
Embassy, it was not the message that was conveyed to me by the Consulate in<br />
Shanghai, it was not the message I got. Now he may have talked to a different group<br />
of people.<br />
O'BRI[ EN:<br />
Like business people for instance...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I spoke to a lot of business people. I, in fact, had 15 senior Australian business<br />
people with me in China. They talked to their counterparts and none of them reported<br />
that. Now John may have had a different experience. I can only report as Prime<br />
Minister, my experience.<br />
O'BRIEN: The issue of the Fairfax media group and the cross-media rules any regrets about<br />
those rather extraordinary comments you made yesterday that nobody was running the<br />
company at the moment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I went on to say and that was left out the Laurence Street interview that I was<br />
not criticising the management. The point I was making was, and it's evident by<br />
comments numerous comments have been made by financial writers about instability<br />
of the share register, it's because of the character of the law at the present time. It's<br />
not a criticism of the management. I think... </p>
<p>O'BRIEEN:<br />
But you did say nobody is running the company at the moment.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that is a paraphrase of saying there's no dominant shareholder, yes.<br />
O'BRIEEN: It's one thing for media commentators to analyse these things, it's quite another isn't it<br />
for a Prime Minister to single out an individual company for those kinds of quite<br />
critical comments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, it's not a critical comment. It would only be a critical comment...<br />
O'BRIEN: The Chairman of Fairfax, Sir Laurence Street, thinks it was. The Chief Executive<br />
thinks it was.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, well I don't agree with Sir Laurence. I don't agree with him. And I went on to<br />
say in that interview that I wasn't being in anyway critical of the management. I'm not<br />
critical of the management of Fairfax, not at all, I haven't been.<br />
O'BRIEN: Kerry Packer supported you strongly before the last election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but he voted Labor in 1987 and as far as I know he might end up voting Labor at<br />
the next election. So let me just say...<br />
O'BRIEN: Pretty clear how he voted at the last one...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It probably doesn't matter how he votes, I mean... </p>
<p>O'BRIEN: Well, you now seem ready to change media laws in a way that many, many people,<br />
those same market analysts that you talk about see as virtually handing Fairfax to<br />
Kerry Packer which of course he's wanted for years.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the present laws...<br />
O'BRIEN: No connection between Kerry Packer's support for you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Absolutely none. I point out that in 1987 when Kerry Packer openly consorted with<br />
Bob Hawke, openly said that he was going to support the Labor Party, ridiculed the<br />
Opposition which I then lead, I then in 1987 was publicly critical of the cross-media<br />
prohibitions that have been brought in by Paul Keating.<br />
O'BRI-EN:<br />
Well Kerry Packer broadly seemed to have got what he wanted then and he seems to<br />
be about to get what he wants now.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well in 1987 the 1987 changes were done, in my view, to spite the Fairfax company<br />
and also to spite the old Herald and Weekly Times. Look, I am against a law which is<br />
outdated. Rupert Murdoch, Paul Keating, Kerry Packer, a whole lot of people over<br />
the years have said that in this day and age of convergence, to have cross-media<br />
prohibition is anachronistic. Now whether the Government ultimately decides to<br />
change those is a matter that Cabinet is yet to decide. But I have made no secret of the<br />
fact that I regard those laws as outdated. There are other considerations that the<br />
Government has got to take into account I'm not going to go into them tonight<br />
before we decide whether or not to make the change. But this idea that it's the result<br />
of some deal is wrong. And this idea that there's some sort virtue in having a law that,<br />
no matter what the modernity of the media is, says that if you own a television station<br />
in Sydney you can't own a newspaper Sydney, is a completely outdated law.<br />
O'BRIEN: There are those who say that your comments in what you're foreshadowing as<br />
legislation could almost be taken straight from Kerry Packer's own submission to your<br />
internal government review. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean, people will say what they can. I don't particularly mind that. I of course<br />
reject the implication that they are designed to particularly deliver on any kind of<br />
understanding because there was none. There is something strange about a law which<br />
says that because you own a certain level of television you can't have a newspaper<br />
when somebody on the other side of the world can bounce a television signal anywhere<br />
into Australia irrespective of cross-border prohibitions. I mean, the whole thing has<br />
been overtaken by technology.<br />
O'BRIEN: But the fact is if you apply what it sounds like you're going to apply and Kerry Packer<br />
does end up with Fairfax you will be reducing, you will presiding over a policy that<br />
reduces the diversity of media ownership in this country in terms of the major owners<br />
of this country from...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well yes, and that of course assumes that the major owners determine the diversity of<br />
media opinion. I mean media opinion in Australia now is dominated by a lot of<br />
considerations. For example, I made the comment yesterday that I thought many<br />
talkback people now...<br />
O'BRIEN: Yes, I was intrigued by that...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's true.<br />
O'BRIEN: because who hires them? The proprietors. Who chooses? The proprietors.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the ABC, the ABC can hire people...<br />
O'BRIEN:<br />
Not as many as we used to be able to.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I happen to hold the view Kerry that the media organisation that has the most<br />
concentrated clout in this country is the ABC. And the reason that I hold that view is </p>
<p>that it reaches into all parts of Australia and it also has a narrower spectrum of opinion<br />
on particular issues than much of the commercial media.<br />
O'BRIEN: With less efficiency, with less effectiveness, with less reach, I would suggest after this<br />
next budget than before.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well... but still greater than the commercial radio stations. And any measure will tell<br />
you that the concentrated clout of the ABC into the four corners of this country is<br />
greater than that of any other television station.<br />
O'BRIEN: I'm going to have to end that there I'm afraid because we're well out of time. We can<br />
hopefully pursue this after the budget. John Howard, thanks very much for talking<br />
with us.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. ends </p>
