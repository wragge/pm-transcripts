THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 16 JANUARY, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: there were several<br />
appointments which the Cabinet made this morning. Three of them<br />
required Executive Council action which took place at half past one<br />
today. Mr George Warwick Smith who was previously Secretary of the<br />
old Department of the Interior has been appointed as a Special Trade<br />
Representative to represent Austra ' lian interests in the forthcoming<br />
multi-lateral trade negotiations under GATT. Dr Cairns is issuing<br />
a separate statement about Mr George Warwick Smith's position.<br />
He will have the personal status of Ambassador.<br />
Mr Kenneth Jones has been appointed Secretary of the Department<br />
of Education. He has been First Assistant Secretary of the Department<br />
of Education and Science since it was established in 1964.<br />
Mr Maurice Timbs has been appointed Secretary of the new<br />
Department of Services and Property. I-don't think that you<br />
gentlemen should refer to it so often as the Department of Property.<br />
Many people have said that it was amazing the first new department<br />
created by a Socialist Government in Australia was the Department of<br />
Property. It's the Department of Services and Property. Mr Timbs<br />
is at present Executive Commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission.<br />
He has held a number of Public Service positions since 1936. He is<br />
also Director of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust and the<br />
Australian Opera Company and holds several other voluntary outside<br />
offices. An Interim Hospitals and Health Services Commission is being<br />
appointed. The Chairman will be Dr Sidney Sachs, who is at present<br />
the Director of Health Services Research and Planning in the N. S. W.<br />
Department of Health and the N. S. W. Hospitals Commission.<br />
There were several administrative proposals and decisions for<br />
legislation. Firstly, in the educational field pre-school<br />
teachers. It was decided to take emergency action to encourage<br />
well-qualified students to enter pre-school teacher education from<br />
the beginning of the present academic year. Special pre-school<br />
teacher education scholarships for both men and women will be<br />
available to all students in recognised pre-school or child care<br />
teacher training courses. Both new entrants to courses in 1973<br />
and existing students who have made satisfactory progress will be<br />
eligible for the awards. The awards will carry the maximum benefits<br />
applicable to Commonwealth Advanced Education scholarships but there<br />
will be no means test. Under these arrangements the new awards<br />
will be comparable to the awards the Commonwealth grants to teachers<br />
training for the Commonwealth-Teaching Service and will also be more<br />
closely related to the benefits available to students training for<br />
employment in State Government primary and secondary schools.<br />
The benefits for 1973 will be payment of compulsory tuition and<br />
service fees plus a living allowance of $ 800 for students living at </p>
<p>home and $ 1,300 for students obliged to live away from home.<br />
Next, isolated children. The Cabinet decided that from the<br />
beginning of the 1973 school year new measures be introduced to<br />
assist in the education of children who, because of the geographic<br />
isolation of their homes, do not have reasonable daily access to a<br />
Government school providing courses at the appropriate level.<br />
We shall provide for such children, at both primary and secondary<br />
level, boarding allowances of $ 350 per year free of means test and<br />
up to an additional $ 350 subject to a means test on family income.<br />
Assistance up to similar levels will also be available for approved<br />
educational expenditure to eligible students who are studying at<br />
home by correspondence. For cases of particular hardship, where<br />
children are living away from home and are receiving boarding<br />
allowances application may be made for assistance with uniforms<br />
and text book~ s. The maximum amount available for any student will be<br />
the maximvm amount at Present available fcr students with Aboriginal<br />
secondary scholarships, i. e. $ 1,004.<br />
The Government proposes to review these measures in light of<br />
a survey which the Department of Education will commence this year<br />
in consultation with the States. The aim of the Department's study<br />
will be to assess more thoroughly the effectiveness of -the measures<br />
which I have mentioned in assisting parents of isolated children to<br />
overcome the educational disadvantages experienced by their children.<br />
The Government sees one of the basic issues in dealing with the<br />
educational disadvantages of these children as being the provision of<br />
better school facilities and better hostel facilities. The Schools<br />
Commission, when established, will be asked to investigate where<br />
these needs lie.<br />
Thirdly, dental therapists. My election policy speech included<br />
a commitment to introduce a five-year program to provide free dental<br />
services to all Australian school children. This commitment was based<br />
on the use of dental therapists. Cabinet decided today to authorise<br />
Dr Everingham, the Minister for Health, to make arrangements with<br />
New Zealand with a view to training perhaps 100 Australian men and<br />
women as dental therapists this year. There are just not the<br />
facilities available in Australia. We hope there are in New Zealand<br />
where such use of dental therapists has been carried on for more<br />
than 50 years.<br />
Then there-were several matters in the welfare field.<br />
Repatriation. We approved amendments to the Act to achieve the following<br />
reforms: There will be increases of $ 3.10 a week in the special<br />
rate pension; $ 2.00 in the general rate; $ 2.25 in the intermediate<br />
rate and $ 1.50 in the War Widow's pension. Equivalent increases will<br />
be made for seamen who served in the war. The increases will apply<br />
from the first full pension period after the election day, the 2nd of<br />
December. The increase in the special rate pension will mean<br />
that it will equal the Commonwealth minimum wage which is the undertaking<br />
the party made. The increase in * the general rate is a start<br />
towards fulfilling our election commitment to raise this rate to<br />
per cent of the minimum wage.<br />
We approved an increase of $ 1.50 for Service pensions, i. e.<br />
burnt-out pensions; again from the first full period after the 2nd of<br />
December. </p>
<p>We also agreed to the continued recognition of a child<br />
of a Service pensioner, for service pension purposes, irrespective<br />
of the child's age for as long as the child continues to undertake<br />
full-time education.<br />
We authorised amendment of the Act to provide the Repatriation<br />
Funeral Benefit to be increased, from $ 50 to S100.<br />
We approved the introduction of legislation enabling war pensions<br />
to be continued until completion of full-time education to dependent<br />
children who are'not receiving maintenance or living allowances or<br />
salary from Commonwealth sources that equals or exceeds the allowances<br />
payable under a Commonwealth Scholarship.<br />
We approved preparation of amendments to enable the legal personal<br />
representatives of a deceased ex-serviceman whose claim has been<br />
processed to Repatriation Commission level but no further, to proceed<br />
with an appeal to an Entitlement Appeal Tribunal or an Assessment<br />
Appeal Tribunal to enable payment of arrears of service pensions to<br />
the estate of an applicant for service pension who dies before the<br />
granting of the pension, and to recognise de facto wives and certain<br />
children who are at present not recognised under Repatriation<br />
legislation but, of course, are recognised under Social Services<br />
legislation. We decided to appoint immediately an Interim Departmental<br />
Committee to investigate and report upon Commonwealth office space<br />
in major cities. It will consist of representatives of the Urban<br />
and Regional Development Department which will chair it, and the<br />
Prime minister's Department, Treasury, Services and Property, Works,<br />
Public Service Board, Transport, and Environment and Conservation.<br />
The Committee will bring up-to-date a report which was made to the<br />
previous Government in 1968, and one of its fields of investigation<br />
will be the question of the new Commonwealth building proposed<br />
hitherto for Spring Street, Melbourne. This project will be<br />
reconsidered. Now those decisions were made this morning. I may take a little<br />
longer to give you the ones this afternoon. They are in the housing<br />
field. We decided to confer with the States to see what additional<br />
funds they can spend in providing Housing Commission houses up to<br />
the end of next June. The money will be made available on condition<br />
that the houses are let, not sold, and that they are made available<br />
to needy families. The general situation has been that in 1969<br />
to 1971 there were 18,000 Housing Commission houses built each year.<br />
Last financial year it dropped to 15,000; this year it is already<br />
at the rate of only 12,000. In particular, the situation is that in<br />
New South Wales there is 42 per cent of the outstanding applications in<br />
the whole of Australia but the State only receives 35 per cent of the<br />
funds. In South Australia 20 per cent of the outstanding applications,<br />
the State only receives 12 per cent of the funds.<br />
We have decided to amend the War Service Homes Act, not only<br />
as we announced at the beginning of last month to cover members of<br />
the forces, including National servicemen who complete their full<br />
period, we will now alter the Act to make War Service Homes advances<br />
available for members of the nursing services, members of the women's<br />
services whether single or married without dependents and members<br />
of the welfare organisations attached to the Defence services. We </p>
<p>will increase the War Service Homes Act maximum advance to $ 12,000<br />
and we will remove the limitation that you can get a minimum deposit<br />
of 5 per cent only if the homes are worth $ 4,000 or less. The<br />
situation is, of course, that at the present time the maximum War<br />
Service Homes advance represents only 57 per cent of the average cost<br />
of house and land in Australia.<br />
There is a couple of other announcements I can make.<br />
Following letters which I sent early last month to the Premiers<br />
of New South Wales and Victoria, arrangements have been made for a<br />
meeting to take place between Commonwealth and State Ministers at<br />
Albury on Thursday of next week. The purpose of the meeting is to<br />
discuss a program of joint co-operative development of the Albury-<br />
Wodonga area. Mr Uren and I will attend on behalf of the<br />
Commonwealth. The meeting will take place on the New South Wales<br />
side of'the border in the Albury Civic Hall. Wodonga also offered<br />
its services so we are having lunch there. We are asking the<br />
Shire President and the Mayor of Albury.<br />
To celebrate the 5th anniversary of Nauru's independence,<br />
Senator Willesee and his wife will represent me and my wife.<br />
They will arrive in Nauru on 30th January and remain for three days.<br />
The Government attaches considerable importance to developing further<br />
constructive, friendly and helpful relationships with the countries<br />
of the South Pacific, and Senator Willesee's visit to this anniversary<br />
of independence is intended to demonstrate this interest early in the<br />
life of the new Government. This will obviously be one of the<br />
subjects that Mr Kirk and I will be discussing next week in<br />
New Zealand, whose successive Governments have shown very valuable<br />
initiatives in political, economic and social co-operation between<br />
all the States and territories of the South Pacific.<br />
Now are there any questions?<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister: In a very short period of time you and<br />
several of your Ministers have managed to ruffle more than a few<br />
feathers in official Washington. What is the message<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You look very cool<br />
Q. I don't come from official Washington, Sir. But what is the<br />
message that you are trying to transmit to Washington concerning the<br />
future of Australia-U. S. relationships and is the strain over Vietnam<br />
very deep, and is it irreparable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, the Australian Government was elected with a<br />
mandate to oppose the continuation of the war in Vietnam and to oppose<br />
Australia's participation in it. This is the only point of<br />
disagreement between the United States Administration and the<br />
Australian Government. In all other fields there are many<br />
opportunities great opportunities for co-operation between<br />
the United States and Australia. Our part of the world particularly<br />
will benefit from such fruitful, constructive peaceful co-operation.<br />
Q. Is there if I could just follow up my colleague in<br />
Washington, a man of the State Depar tment, in answer to a request<br />
sent this along today. He said that there is a sense in Washington </p>
<p>that Whitlam is not a Nixon type: there are far-reaching changes<br />
in Australian policy caused by Whitlam's election which officials<br />
here acknowledge will require some long and cosy chats between the<br />
two sides in the future. While Whitlam was here before coming to<br />
power he was not received at the White House though he asked for<br />
an appointment. So, my question after all that is, do you and the<br />
President see eye to eye on major issues? Are you of similar<br />
personalities or are your personalities so different that you will<br />
not be able to get along in the future?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: I don't believe there is any reason why any<br />
Australian Prime Minister can't get along with any United States<br />
President. I see no reason why the present Prime Minister can't<br />
get on with the present President. I have been foremost among<br />
Australian political leaders in publicly praising President Nixon's<br />
initiatives to bring about a detente with the People's Republic<br />
of China and with the Soviet Union, and I hope that he is able to<br />
fulfil before his second inauguration his promise to end the war<br />
between America and North Vietnam.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister: Now, as far as Vietnam is concerned,<br />
maybe you have already answered a lot of the questions I am<br />
interested in the solution in Vietnam now that peace may be<br />
attained again. What is the position of your Government? Do you<br />
think it is in the interests of Australia to have Vietnam reunited<br />
under North Vietnamese auspices or, in other words, under a<br />
communist government, and what do you think might be the<br />
consequences for, as you would call it, this area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's not for outsiders to determine what sort of<br />
government the people of Vietnam should have. The division between<br />
North and South Vietnam is an artificial one. The present parallel<br />
was provisionally determined 18 years ago after the end of the<br />
Korean War and the defeat of the French. It was only meant to<br />
be a temporary border. We should not expect that the'division<br />
should continue as long as the division of Germany or Korea.<br />
There was an earlier division in 1945 at a parallel 1 degree south<br />
of the present one. But we believe that outsiders should allow<br />
the people of Vietnam who have a long history of patriotism<br />
against outside intervention, whether for good or bad purposes,<br />
we believe they should be allowed to determine their political<br />
futur~ e, and outsiders shouldn't say whether the regime in Hanoi<br />
or the regime in Saigon should rule the whole country.<br />
The interest of the Australian Government is that, as soon as<br />
possible, there should be an end to hostilities in that countryan<br />
end to the supplies from so many outside countries to the<br />
warring factions in that country and that Australia should stand<br />
ready with other countries to help rehabilitate that countrythe<br />
whole of that country.<br />
Q. Do you think the conflict will be ended in Vietnam if the<br />
Americans stop the war?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe..-. I hope that not only will there be<br />
an end of military activities and supplies by the United States<br />
but an end of military supplies by the People's Republic of China<br />
and the Soviet Union. I believe that the cessation of such supplies<br />
will make the country more rapidly tranquil, give some hope for its<br />
rehabilitation. </p>
<p>Q. Mr Prime Minister, following that light is very<br />
bright... PRIME MINISTER: Well, I have it in my eyes all the time.<br />
Q. I know... Dr Cairns in the last week has been making<br />
statements suggesting that Australia is going to recognise<br />
North Vietnam.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, he hasn't.<br />
Q. But, he has. I'm sorry. You mean to say all the press<br />
reports quoting Dr Cairns have been wrong?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He has not said that. He has said that the<br />
recognition of North Vietnam is inevitable. He has expressly<br />
said that he wouldn't say wouldn't guess when that would be.<br />
Q. If the recognition of North Vietnam is, to quote him, a<br />
matter of fact...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Inevitable well, isn't it?<br />
0. How does this then reconcile with your own statement on the<br />
future of a single Vietnam rather than a divided one which was,<br />
from my interpretation, what you were just expounding?<br />
PRIME MINISTERt Now, it's again... I am not asserting that there<br />
should be a single Vietnam. I am asserting that the type of government<br />
that the people of Vietnam should have is a matter which they<br />
should decide. I'll reassert that the country has been artificially<br />
divided in 1945 by British and Chaing-Kai-Shek occupation respectively<br />
and then later after 1954, north of that, under the present regime.<br />
But I'm not asserting that there should be one country. I would<br />
think that reasonable, but it's not for me to say that there should<br />
be. Looking at history, I would think this is likely.<br />
Q. But Dr Cairns statement does indicate two countries rather<br />
than one. How does this reconcile in view of the Australian<br />
attitude towards what ought to be happening in Vietnam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now the Australian attitude is that what ought to be<br />
happening in Vietnam should be determined by the people of Vietnam<br />
without outside intervention or encouragement. My guess would be<br />
that sooner or later there would be one government for the whole<br />
country. I can't speculate how soon that will take place. I<br />
would hope that it won't take as long as it has taken in the case of<br />
Germany and Korea.<br />
0. Could we suggest then that perhaps Dr Cairns has been a little<br />
bit premature in his statements of recognition of North Vietnam being<br />
inevitable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If we are-to help in the rehabilitation of this<br />
country there will have to be representation in North Vietnam<br />
as well as in South Vietnam. I've not used the term recognition.<br />
The division of this country was imposed from outside. It is an<br />
artificial one. But as long as it persists, then outsiders to play<br />
an effective part in rehabilitation, will have to be represented<br />
in both halves. </p>
<p>Q. And what then can we interpret as Australia's role in the<br />
rehabilitation of North Vietnam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: To co-operate with any other country which is<br />
prepared to help in rehabilitation.<br />
Q. And if no other country is prepared?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, of course there are other countries prepared<br />
to rehabilitate. Japan has said so, the United States has said so.<br />
0. What is Australia's role in the rehabilitation of North Vietnam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Through international arrangements. As you know,<br />
Japan already has people there to see how she can help to rehabilitate<br />
North Vietnam.<br />
Q. Could I ask you about Lake Pedder. Mr Reece seems to indicate<br />
that the book is closed on Lake Pedder. Dr Cass seems to think<br />
that there should be a Federal Government inquiry. What is the<br />
Federal Government's position on Lake Pedder?.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wait till the Government considers it. It didn't<br />
consider it today.<br />
Q. Supplementary to the question on North Vietnam. Do you<br />
consider Dr Cairns' statements regarding North Vietnam in any way<br />
contravened your statement at your last press conference that you,<br />
in future, would be the only person in the Government to make<br />
statements on foreign policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, you read what he said. He said in effect,<br />
that recognition I think the word was he used. I would have thought<br />
the more appropriate one was representation in North Vietnam<br />
is inevitable. Well, of course it is. If we have faith, as I<br />
certainly do that hostilities will come to an end, then there will<br />
have to be representation in North Vietnam as well as South Vietnam<br />
to help in the rehabilitation of the country. It's on that basis<br />
that Australian representation continues at such expense and in such<br />
number in Saigon. And it's for that reason that the civilian aid for<br />
South Vietnam continues unabated as far as the Government is concerned.<br />
Q. I'm sorry, Sir. I was in fact seeking a clarification of your<br />
statement at your last press conference that in future you would<br />
be the only member of the Government to make statements on foreign<br />
policy. PRIME MINISTER: That's true.<br />
Q. Do you not feel that Dr Cairns statement on North Vietnam...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. What do you define as future statements on foreign policy<br />
then if that isn't one foreign policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PIRI MtEhMIiNnITkE R: y ou gentlemen ought to be reasonable. </p>
<p>You're saying, I take it, that if there's a debate on foreign<br />
policy or on any subject in the Parliament the only person<br />
the only Minister who can speak on it will be the Minister<br />
within whose ministerial responsibility that subject falls.<br />
Might I make that very reasonable parallel.<br />
Q PRIME MINISTER: Just because you live in Australia doesn't<br />
mean you don't represent a great international paper.<br />
Q. Thank you very much, Sir. The New South Wales Law Reform<br />
Commission has pointed out that quite a lot of the residual powers<br />
in the British Parliament with respect to Australia affect the<br />
States. PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. Would Senator Murphy in London be representing or have a<br />
mandate of any kind for the State Solicitors-General or Attorneys-<br />
General as well as for the Commonwealth on this question on<br />
residual powers as they affect the States? And, Sir, secondly,<br />
on the judicial committee of the Privy Council: do the States have<br />
the power to prevent or impede, do you think, your intention to<br />
make the judicial committee of the Privy Council synonomous<br />
roughly with the High Court of Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Senator Murphy is representing the Government of*<br />
Australia. He's not representing, he's not been asked to represent,<br />
he's not sought to represent the State Governments of Australia.<br />
You have mentioned two matters where he is to have talks with<br />
British Ministers. One is to end the archaic position where the<br />
British Parliament can still make laws covering this national<br />
Parliament of Australia but also, of course, the State Parliaments<br />
in Australia. There is one quite notorious case in the latter:-<br />
coastal ships trading between one port in a State and another port<br />
in that State are covered by British laws, and it may come as a<br />
surprise to you but it did arise in a court not so long ago where one<br />
of these 60-milers, the Colliers which trade between Newcastle and<br />
Port Jackson foundered on the way and several people lost their<br />
lives, and it was conceded that the New South Wales Workers'<br />
Compensation Act didn't cover them. The legislation which covered<br />
them was the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and that meant that<br />
the only compensation the families could get would be to divide the<br />
number of victims into a sum calculated on the tonnage of the ship,<br />
and it's still not possible for any State Government in Australia<br />
to pass a law concerning matters of maritime commerce between two<br />
ports in the one State. The Commonwealth can do it between ports in<br />
different States but within the one State the British Parliament<br />
alone can do it. Now, again, you ask about appeals to the Privy<br />
Council. Most members of the British Commonwealth have abolished<br />
appeals to the Privy Council.<br />
It's a basis of democracy that judges should be appointed<br />
by the Government. That they should sit and citizens in a country<br />
should be able to appeal to courts in that country. Now the<br />
objectionable feature of the Privy Council is that the members<br />
of the judicial committee are appointed by the British Government.<br />
It sits in Britain and its judgments take the form of advice to<br />
The Queen of the United Kingdom. She happens also to be Queen of </p>
<p>Australia, but she doesn't get their decision in the form of advice<br />
to her as Queen of Australia, but in the form of advice to<br />
The Queen of the United Kingdom. Now, the Party's policy has been<br />
and was in my policy speech that we should aim to have the<br />
Privy Council, when it hears appeals from Australian courts,<br />
constituted by Australian judges sitting in Australia, and that's<br />
one of the things that Senator Murphy will be discussing. It is<br />
not possible for the State Parliaments to abolish appeals to the<br />
Privy Council. That would need the approval of the Queen on the<br />
advice of the British Government. I notice there's some speculation<br />
that this has something to do about the monarchy. Now the only<br />
issue here is the despatch and acceptance of credentials of<br />
ambassadors. The attitude that the Government takes is this:<br />
Australia is a monarchy The monarch is usually resident overseas.<br />
In those circumstances the Governor-General should be a viceroy.<br />
He should be able to discharge the whole of the functions of the<br />
monarch when the monarch is not within the jurisdiction, and we<br />
believe it is anomalous that if an ambassador of a foreign country<br />
is credentialled to the Australian Government, his credentials<br />
have to be approved by The Queen in England. And we regard it as<br />
objectionable if an Australian ambassador is being credentialled to<br />
another country The Queen issues his Commission, even when she is<br />
not resident in Australia, although of course, I sign it at her<br />
command. Q. Do the States have any power though to prevent you from ha ving<br />
the judicial committee of the Privy Council made synonomous with<br />
the High Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think they have any power to do it. They<br />
may make representations to the British Government. I hope that in<br />
these circumstances the British Government would agree with the<br />
Australian Government. Ladies and gentlemen, the constitutional<br />
situation is that the Australian States are still British colonies.<br />
That's why the Governors apparently still fly the Union Jack.<br />
Q. Mr Whitlam, can I come back to Alan Barnes question?<br />
We have had a number of reports from Washington which indicate that<br />
President Nixon has been somewhat confused, that three senior<br />
Ministers of your Government can speak as they have about the<br />
bombing of North Vietnam, yet not be speaking for the Government.<br />
Can I ask you if you have had any communication with either the<br />
White House or the State Department to make it clear that, as YOU<br />
told us last week, you don't endorse everything they've said. And<br />
on Dr Cairns' pronouncements since then you've told us that you<br />
think the choice of the word " recognition" to North Vietnam was rather<br />
unfortunate: have you communicated with Washington at all about<br />
this to make it clear that your Government is talking simply about<br />
representation in terms of rehabilitation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been no communications at all on this<br />
subject between Washington and Canberra. I don't believe that you<br />
should believe every report you see. There were some people that<br />
were urging me to make some statement about a report of evidence<br />
given before the appropriate U. S. Senate committee which was<br />
inquiring into the nomination of a new Deputy Secretary of Defence.<br />
It was represented here that the nominee had refused to be drawn<br />
on the question whether America might use nuclear weapons against<br />
Hanoi. The actual reports show that that was a very garbled report<br />
indeed. No inquiry was made from here. I was quite satisfied the </p>
<p>itiatter would be cleared up and I believe Washington would have<br />
=; cted with the same understanding and decorum. I have deliberately<br />
refrained myself from using the term " recognition" as regards<br />
North Vietnam and South Vietnam because it is a matter of dispute<br />
as to the juridical status of the regimes in Hanoi and Saigon.<br />
7 don't want to express an opinion on them, but I am prepared to<br />
u. se the word " representation" because this is something that does<br />
happen. For instance, Indonesia and India have representation in<br />
Hanoi. Britain has a Consul in Hanoi.<br />
Q. Are you satisfied that the White House and the State Department<br />
understand the position of your Government as opposed to the position<br />
which has been taken by people like Mr Cameron, Dr Cairns and<br />
Mr Uren?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well there's been nothing more that any of those<br />
colleagues have said since the last press conference.<br />
Q. Well, there has been Dr Cairns...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but I've already dealt with that.<br />
Frankly, gentlemen, you're scrambling if you want to see what<br />
Dr Cairns said in a radio interview as a pronouncement on foreign<br />
policy. He said that recognition of North Vietnam was inevitable<br />
sooner or later, and of course it is.<br />
Q. Let me say, Sir, that the most important matter in Europe is<br />
what happens about the Australian relations with France and<br />
Western Europe, and relations with America, do they matter that<br />
much anyhow?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, Australia wants to be on good terms with all<br />
countries and not least the United States and France.<br />
Q. Any news about the nuclear tests?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, the only significant difference of opinion<br />
between Australia and France is the possible continuation of French<br />
nuclear testing in our hemisphere.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, I have prepared four questions how<br />
many am I permitted to ask?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, let's see how the first two go.<br />
Q. The first question concerns Australia's relations to the<br />
German Democratic Republic and is divided into two parts:<br />
What was the response of the Government in East Berlin to the<br />
recognition; what sort of representation is contemplated ini<br />
East Berlin respectively in Canberra, and when was the first<br />
Australian diplomatic mission to leave for East Berlin?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Our Ambassador to East Germany the German<br />
Democratic Republic will be resident in Another country. This<br />
form of representation will be acceptable to the German Democratic<br />
Republic. I cannot say when there will be G. D. R. representation<br />
in Australia. I can find.., if you want to ask me I can give<br />
you a more precise answer afterwards. I don't think it will be </p>
<p>11.<br />
long delayed. There have been, as you know, some officials in<br />
Sydney for some time.<br />
Q. Well, I now come to part of question number 1. Does the<br />
Australian Government contemplate to ask East Germany for war<br />
compensations as other western countries which have recognised the<br />
Democratic German Republic recently have?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's never been considered. I don't think we've<br />
sought reparation from West Germany either, but thanks for the<br />
suggestion, I'll consider it.<br />
Q. The second question concerns the relations between Australia<br />
and the Federal Republic of Germany. Divided again into two parts<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, wait a minute, one part..<br />
Q. One part. Well that would be the more difficult part. Have<br />
you, Mr Prime Minister, considered to seek the support of<br />
Chancellor Willie Brandt for your fight against the French nuclear<br />
tests? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think there's another overseas Jack, you<br />
represent an overseas...<br />
Q. Yes, two quick and unrelated questions,<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In answer to the first part of the third question<br />
Might I say that the present matter in which Australia is concerned<br />
in relation to the French nuclear tests turns on the fact that these<br />
tests can harm countries in the track of the winds, and accordingly<br />
Australia believes that she has a legitimate cause of complaint<br />
before the International Court of Justice. Mr recollection is that...<br />
No, well, that's enough for this one.<br />
Q. Two quick and unrelated questions I promise. Did you feel<br />
yourself slighted in Washington or did you think that Nixon was<br />
not quite up with the trend of Australiant politics, and the unrelated<br />
question the other one.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, the answer to the first is no<br />
Q. You weren't slighted?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, never.<br />
Q. Did you think he was up with the trend of Australian politics?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't express an opinion on that. He is now. I<br />
don't know whether he was before. Look, there's been no slighting at<br />
all. This was a fabrication of Roy MacCartney last January and people<br />
who work for the Sydney Morning Hera'ld know the circumstances in<br />
which he felt spurred to fabricate that story.<br />
Q. You've made-your position perfectly clear in South Africa on<br />
sport. Have you got any decided views on trade with South Africa?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PNRoI. M EMTIhNIeT EgR: e neral principle is that trade with all </p>
<p>12.<br />
countries including divided countries is prima facie desirable.<br />
The only limitation we put to that is where there are international<br />
decisions made as there have been as regards Zimbabwe, which we<br />
loyally observe.<br />
Q. I have one quick and unrelated question. When may we expect<br />
the Government to honour its pre-election commitment to the<br />
publication of detailed economic forecasts by the Federal Treasury<br />
a comtmitment which you reaffirmed shortly before the elections<br />
will you be pursuing this matter as a question of urgency with the<br />
Treasurer, Mr Crean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This matter is being pursued. It is likely that<br />
the quarterly bulletin that the Treasury issues will come out more<br />
regularly. There may be more frequent Treasury forecasts published.<br />
Q. Will it come out in more detail the quarterly bulletin?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think this is being considered, this is a<br />
possibility. Q. On Francis James. In view of reports of elaborate security<br />
surrounding his departure from China and entry to Hong Kong, is it<br />
reasonable to assume that the Australian Government has asked him<br />
to go quietly at this stage since we have the Embassy only about<br />
three days established?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The Australian representatives have made it<br />
plain to Mr James that if he wants privacy, they will help him enjoy<br />
privacy. If he wants to speak to the press, he is completely free<br />
to speak to the press. The Australian Government has expressed no<br />
opinion on whether he should make statements or not. Gentlemen:<br />
this is one subject on which I've made no statements at all despite<br />
a great deal of blaggarding and pressure since my visit to China,<br />
and it might be appropriate for me to say that I have appreciated<br />
the co-operation and the honour of those journalists who accompanied<br />
me to China. They knew that I had a message. They accepted that<br />
it would be in the interests of Mr James and his family that there<br />
should be no publicity attached to this matter. All of us, all<br />
these journalists, I'm glad to say, as well as my own colleagues and<br />
I, had taken up the position of Mr James in that fortnight when we<br />
were in China in the middle of 1971. When I was coming on the train<br />
from Wongjo to the border the Chinese official who had accompanied<br />
us throughout told me that he had three messages I could give to<br />
Mr James' family. First, that he was in China. Two, that he had<br />
violated China's laws. Three, that his case was under consideration.<br />
I got to Tokyo that night and wrote and sent those messages by<br />
letter to Mrs James. When I got back to Australia-just over a week<br />
later I telephoned her about them. I told her that I thought it<br />
would be in the interests of Mr James himself and of her family<br />
that this should not be publicised. I told her I would be making<br />
no statement concerning him without clearing it with her, and I've<br />
remained silent to this day about it because I believed<br />
and the events of last March bore it out that the more publicity<br />
there was, the more drama there was about this, the more likely it was<br />
that there would be a hitch in his leaving China.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, a question on the Constitution. You appear<br />
to be working with a patched-up State Federal relationship which<br />
constitutionally obviously isn't working at the moment. It seems </p>
<p>to be pulling apart perhaps rather than pulling together.<br />
Prime Minister, when do you intend really getting to the core<br />
of the matter, and Sir, do you perhaps see that the importance<br />
oi the States is perhaps waning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If one compares the present situation with 1900<br />
and the 1890' s when State politicians drew up the Australian<br />
Constitution, then one obviously would have to concede that the<br />
position of the States vis-a-vis the Commonwealth is much less<br />
significant, but it is inevitable in view of the financial realities<br />
in Australia and in view of international arrangements which are<br />
now so much a feature of everything that companies and individuals<br />
and governments do, that the Commonwealthr should be predominant.<br />
It was ' only on the eve of the last war that the Commonwealth's budget<br />
exceeded the budget of New South Wales in size. Now the<br />
Commonwealth's budget is very much as large as all State budgets<br />
combined and most of the State revenues come from the Commonwealth.<br />
Now the big thing that has to be done is to equate the functions<br />
and the finances and there ha-s already been correspondence with all<br />
the Premiers since the elections to bring about a better balance.<br />
In effect, the Commonwealth wants to ensure that it plays a full<br />
part in planning and spending the revenues which it has to find<br />
particularly in those functions which it's now beyond the<br />
possibility of any State Government whatever its political complexion<br />
to provide in contemporary terms. In particular I suppose one has<br />
to say education, health, transport and the whole conditions in which<br />
people buy and use land are now beyond the capacity of the States<br />
to provide good government.<br />
Q. Would you say we're working under an outdated federalism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, of course we are. There's another feature in<br />
this. The States have created a great number of semi-government and<br />
local government authorities and particularly in the capital field<br />
these authorities have as big a burden every year as the States.<br />
And the worst governed areas of Australia, Sydney and Melbourne,<br />
suffer because in the constitutional arrangements in Australia<br />
these State creations, the semi-government and local government<br />
authorities have no voice and no vote. So if we are updating<br />
Australian federalism one has to include the people who are elected<br />
as aldermen and councillors throughout Australia.<br />
Q. Mr Whitlam, I just want to refer to New Guinea as Mr Somare<br />
is coming here tonight.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's why I have to knock off early, because I<br />
have to go and meet him.<br />
Q. While Mr Morrison was in New Guinea he said that New Guinea<br />
would be independent in 1974. Is it the Australian Government's<br />
policy that New Guinea should be independent in 1974?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well this is a matter to be worked out in<br />
consultation between Papua New Guinea and Australia. There are<br />
international obligations reasserted only last November by the<br />
General Assembly of the United Nations that we should be planning<br />
for this purpose. I mean both Governments have a say in this.<br />
Australia can't be compelled to remain an imperial power if she<br />
doesn't want to. But I think this is a matter which we can discuss<br />
at the press conference which Iguess will take place after<br />
Mr Morrison and Mr Somare and I have had talks tomorrow. </p>
