FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 1-33/ 1968<br />
NEW YEAR MESSAGE TO THE NATION<br />
From the Prime Minister, Mr. JohnGorton<br />
This is the first time I have had the privilege, as Prime<br />
Minister# of wishing you all a happy, prosperous and successful New.<br />
Year. This the last year of the sixties can be all these things for us,<br />
but at the same time, it will be a " crossroads" year for Australia.<br />
Our environment, our resources, out~ high standards of<br />
living and our many other advantages can give us the good things of life;<br />
but 1969 will confront us with many changes and many challenges on the<br />
international scene! What will be the outcome of the Paris talks on<br />
Vietnam what will be the United States' attitude to Asia and the Pacific<br />
under its new Admir. stration. what is to be the basis for defence and<br />
stability in our part of the world after Britain completes her withdrawal?<br />
Tjhese are imponderables that face us in 1969. You can<br />
rest assured that your Government will be making policies and deciding<br />
priorities based on an honest assessment of what we believe is best for<br />
Australia. At home we must press on with the urgent task of national<br />
development so that we grow stronger and more self-reliant as each month<br />
goes by. We must continue to people our continant, to save and invest<br />
our money and attract the capital we still need to finance our growth.<br />
We must continue to diversify our industries and increase<br />
our exports. We must nourish our world markets of long standing and<br />
develop new ones, particularly in South East Asia where the future holds<br />
a bright promise for the emerging nations and for Australia.<br />
We must carry on the work we began last year of giving<br />
increased help to the aged and the chronically ill and those citizens who<br />
are still in need so that 1969 will hold better things for them and bring a<br />
new dignity to their lives.<br />
We have done reasonably well in the year past, but let us<br />
not be satisfied. There is much to do and I am heartened by the fact<br />
that we tackle the future with a burgeoning belief in our nationalism and a<br />
growing faith in ourselves as Australians.<br />
A Happy New Year to you all. I will be doing my best to see<br />
that it is.<br />
CANBERRA 31 December 1968 </p>
