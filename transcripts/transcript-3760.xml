ADDRESS Y THiE PRIME ' IllISTER<br />
11 IEi1 O N. E. G. ' iiTLVI, 1l., P. " 1<br />
TO T! E APIA CLU3, SYD'EY<br />
SUNDAY 1 JUNE 1975<br />
IT IS JUST OVER A YEAR SINCE I ATTENDED A GALA DINNER<br />
IN SYDNEY OF THE APIA CLUB. IN AGAIN PAYING TRIBUTE TO APIA, I AGAIN PAY<br />
TRIBUTE TO THE ENTIRE ITALIAN COMMUNITY, TO THE ENTIRE MIGRANT COMMUNITY,<br />
TO ITALY HERSELF, TO EUROPE AND OUR EUROPEAN CONNECTION. NOT ONLY DOES<br />
APIA PROVIDE A VITAL FOCUS FOR THE ITALIAN COMMUNITY THE LARGEST<br />
SINGLE GROUP OF NON-BRITISH MIGRANTS IN AUSTRALIA IT PROVIDES A<br />
LIVING SYMBOL OF AUSTRALIA'S LINKS WITH EUROPE. MORE THAN ANY OTHER<br />
SINGLE ORGANISATION YOUR CLUB HAS COME TO REFLECT THE STRENGTH, THE<br />
IMPORTANCE, THE DURABILITY OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ITALY, HER<br />
MAINFOLD LINKS WITH THE OLD , CRLD AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE COME TO US<br />
FROM THE OLD WORLD," I REJOICE ON THE PARTICULAR OCCASION THAT BRINGS US<br />
TOGETHER TODAY. IT IS AN HONOUR TO BE WITH YOU TO OBSERVE THE 19TH<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE PROCLAMATION OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC. 2 JUNE 19l6<br />
SAW THE FINAL STEPS IN THE RESTORATION OF ITALIAN DEMOCRACY. ITALIANS<br />
VOTED IN A REFERENDUM FOR A REPUBLIC; AT THE SAME TIME THEY HELD THE<br />
FIRST ELECTIONS FOR A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, WITH THE OVERTHROW OF<br />
FASCISM ITALY REBUILT HER DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WITH SPEED AND VIGOUR. </p>
<p>/ 7 2-<br />
I FOR ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THE WESTERN NATIONS H/ VE<br />
FACED SINCE THE SECOND WÂ½ fORLD WAR FOR ALL THE GREAT ECONOMIC,<br />
SOCIAL AND MILITARY CRISES THE CONTINENT HAS ENDURED THE<br />
FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN ITALIAN DEIOCRACY HAVE SURVIVED. CN<br />
THOSE FOUNDATIONS WAS BUILT THE GREAT POST-WAR MIGRATION PROGRAM<br />
TO AUSTRALIA ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLANNED MOVEMENTS OF POPULATION<br />
IN ALL HISTORY. THE HSTORY OF ITALIAN MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA IS FAMILIAR<br />
TO ALL OF US, THERE ARE FEW COUNTRIES WITH WHICH AUSTRALIA HAS<br />
HAD A LONGER CONTACT, THESE CONTACTS GO BACK MUCH FURTHER THAN<br />
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MODERN REPUBLIC; FURTHER EVEN THAN THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENrT OF APIA: WE KINOW THERE WAS AiJ ITALIAN ON THE<br />
ENDEAVoL. V,-HEN CAPTAIN COOK CAME TO AUSTRALIA; WE KNOW THERE WAS<br />
AN ITALIAN IN THE FIRST FLEET. DURING THE 19TH CENTURY MIGRANTS<br />
ARRIVED IN AUSTPALIA IN SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBERS; PARTICULARLY<br />
AFTER THE IMPETUS OF THE GOLD DISCOVERIES OF THE 1350' S.<br />
RAFFAELLO CARBONI WAS ONE OF THE MINERS' LEADERS AT THE EUREKA<br />
STOCKADE IN 1854. GiISEPPE GARIBALDI, THE GREAT FIGHTER FOR<br />
ITALIAN UNIFICATION, ONE OF THE BUILDERS OF THE MODERN ITALIAN<br />
DEMOCRACY WHOSE ANNIVERSARY WE OBSERVE TODAY, WEIGHED ANCHOR IN<br />
THE BRIG CARMEN OFF TASMANIA IN 1352. SINCE THOSE EARLY BEGINNINGS<br />
THE ITALIAN COMMUNITY HAS GROWN TO BE THE BIGGEST, THE MOST VIGOROUS,<br />
THE MOST VALUABLE OF ALL NON-BRITISH NATIONAL GROUPS IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>9-<br />
f'bRE THAN 3WXW AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS WERE BORN IN ITALY,<br />
ACCORDING TO THE BEST ESTIMATES, THERE ARE VORE THAN A MILLION<br />
AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN DESCENT. IT IS EASILY FORGOTTEN THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE WO) RLD S GREAT MULTI-NATIONAL COMM~ UNITIES,<br />
' PE HAVE HAD ENORMOUS BENEFITS FROM THE INFLOW OF<br />
EUROPEAN MIGRANTS. THE LEAST OF THOSE BENEFITS IS THE<br />
REMINDER OF OUR LINKS WITH OTHER NATIONS AND THE INTERDEPENDENCE<br />
. OF ALL NATIONS IN SOLVING OUR CO~ tAN PROBLEMS. AUSTRALIA'S<br />
GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION HAS PLACED US FAR FROM THE ANCIENT CENTRES<br />
OF POWER AND IDEAS. IT WAS NEVER MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IT IS<br />
TODAY FOR AUSTRALIANS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CONTACTS WITH OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES AND DEVELOP CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THE NATIONS OF THE<br />
OLD WORLD THE NATIONS OF EUROPE. TH-AT WAS THE ESSENTIAL<br />
PURPOSE OF MY VISIT To EUROPE LAST DECEMIBER AND JANUARY. YOU<br />
WILL REMEMBER THERE WAS SOME MILD CRITICISM OF THAT MISSION IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AT THE TIME. THIS IS NOT THE OCCASION FOR POLITICAL<br />
SELF-JUSTIFICATION, BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT NO ONE IN THIS ROOM,<br />
NO ONE WITH ANY AWARENESS OF AUSTRALIA'S PROPER ROLE IN TH-E WORLD,<br />
NO ONE WITH ANY FEELING FOR THE DE. PTH AN4D RANGE OF OUR CONTACTS WITH<br />
THE NATIONS OF PEOPLES OF EUROPE, COULD DOUBT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT<br />
MISSION, AND, IF I MAY SAY SO, THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT IT ACHIEVED. </p>
<p>I HAD THE VERY GREAT PLEASURE OF VISITING ITALY,<br />
NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME AS PRIME MINISTER, BUT THE SECOND.<br />
LIAM PROUD TO SAY THAT ROME IS THE ONLY CAPITAL ON THE EUROPEAN<br />
CONTINENT WHICH I HAVE VISITED TWICE SINCE MY GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
ELECTED. IN JANUARY I MET PRESIDENT LEONE AND HAD TALKS WITH<br />
, SENIOR MINISTERS INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER i'bRO AND FOREIGN MINISTER<br />
'* RUMOR. WE REVIEWED THE BUOYANT TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN ITALY<br />
SAND AUSTRALIA. ITALY IS ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS<br />
OUR TWELFTH MOST IMPORTANT EXPORT MARKET AND OUR EIGHTH MOST IMPORTANT<br />
SOURCE OF IMPORTS. MY GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED TO ENSURE THAT THERE<br />
IS A CONTINUING AND HEALTHY TRADE 3SETWEEN US. LAST YEAR THE<br />
THEN MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS TRADE ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF THE<br />
ITALO-AUSTRALIAN TRADE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF COMtERCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN ITALY AND AUSTRALIA, THE COMMITTEE<br />
WAS FORMED BY A GROUP OF ITALIAN AND AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSMEN TO<br />
PROMOTE COOPERATION AND STREAMLINE PROCESSES BETWEEN THE BUSINESS<br />
COiMUNITIES OF BOTH COUNTRIES, J'<br />

<p>AGAIN, WHILE IN ROME, I SIGNED A CULTURAL AGREEMENT<br />
BETWiEEN ITALY AND AUSTRALIA AS A TANGIBLE EXPRESSION OF THE<br />
CULTURAL AND HUMAN CONTACTS BUILT UP OVER A GUARTER OF A CENTURY.<br />
THE AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY RECOGNISES THE CONTRIBUTION WHICH THE<br />
ITALIAN COMMIUNITY HAS MADE TO THE QUALITY AND DIVERSITY OF LIFE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. AND SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF-BILATERAL<br />
RELATIONS IN THE SOCIAL, CULTUJRAL, ARTISTIC, SCIENTIFIC AND<br />
SPORTING FIELDS. IGIVE ONE EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF COOPERATI. ON<br />
WE CAN EXPECT. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT AUSTRALIA AND ITALY<br />
WILL EXCHANGE TEACHERS TO FACILITATE THE INTEGRATION OF ITALIAN<br />
CHILDREN INTO THE AUSTRALIAN CO IMUNITY, WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR<br />
CULTURAL TIES WITH THEIR BIRTHPLACE.<br />
SIGNIFICANT AND SYMBOLIC AS THESE THINGS ARE,<br />
THE REAL IMPORTANCE OF MY VISIT TO ITALY AND OTHER NATIONS OF<br />
EUROPE WAS IN THE OPPORT-UNITY WE HAD TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON<br />
COMMON PROBLEMS, ON WORLD PROBLEMS. IN A SPEECH I GAVE IN<br />
ROME ON 8 JANUARY .1975 1 SAID THIS: </p>
<p>1~<br />
j " I DOUBT IF THERE HAS EVER BEEN A TIME<br />
WHEN CONSULTATION AID CO-OPERATION BETW! EEN<br />
NATIONAL LEADERS WAS URGENT OR<br />
IMPORTANT. AUSTRALIA AND ITALY HAVE GREAT<br />
CULTURAL AND SOCIAL TRADITIONS IN COPON:<br />
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, WE SHARE WITH ALL<br />
COUNTRIES OF THE WESTERN WORLD GREAT SOCIAL<br />
AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. INFLATION AND<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT POSE A GRAV/ E AND GROWING<br />
THREAT TO DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND SOCIAL<br />
ORDER AND COHESION. IF WESTERN NATIONS<br />
ARE TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS WITHOUT A<br />
RECOURSE TO AUTHORITARIANISM OR A<br />
RELAPSE INTO ANARCHY, THEY WILL DO SO<br />
ONLY BY RESTORING FAITH IN THE DEMOCRATIC<br />
SYSTEM. IT IS TIME FOR GOVERNMENTS, FOR<br />
POLITICIANS, FOR ALL FREE POLITICAL PARTIES<br />
TO RENEW THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE FORMS AND<br />
VALUES OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIECTY. THERE IS NO<br />
MORE URGENT TASK FOR MODERN STATESMEN THAN<br />
TO LEAD, TO INSPIRE, TO NOURISH THIS COVMITNENT.<br />
THE BREAKDOWN OF DEMOCRlACY IN ONE COUNTRY,<br />
ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY IN ONE COUNTRY, MUST BE<br />
RECOGNISED AS AN ATTACH ON DEMCRACY EVERYWHERE.<br />
I BELIEVE THE LEADERS AND PEOPLES<br />
OF ITALY AND AUSTRALIA. ThID NATIONS WITH<br />
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS, CAN PLAY A PART IN<br />
REBUILDING THE WORLD'IS FAITH IN THE FLEXIBILITY<br />
AND STRENGTH OF DEMO1CRACY." i as118~ </p>
<p>7<br />
/ 7-THAT IS OUR URGENT TASK, THAT WAS THE RELED/ ANCE<br />
OF MY MISSION TO EUROPE. THAT IS THE LESSON TO B13KEE PT IN<br />
MIND WHEN WE CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF POST-WAR DEMOCRACY IN<br />
ITALY. DEMOCRACY IS STRONGEST WHEN IT PROVIDES ITS<br />
. CITIZENS WITH THE MEANS TO A FULL LIFE AND A MEASURE OF<br />
MATERIAL SECURITY AND SPIRITUAL FULFILMENT. FOR TOO LONG<br />
IN AUSTRALIA MIGRANTS LACKED THESE ESSENTIAL THINGS, THE<br />
SLABOR PARTY WAS THE FIRST TO IDENTIFY MIGRANTS AS ONE OF THE<br />
PRIME DISADVANTAGED GROUPS IN AUST. RALIAN SOCIETY, CUR<br />
POLICY SINCE WE CAME TO GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TO RECTIFY A LONG<br />
TRADITIONr OF INJUSTICE AND DEPRIVATION, TO GIVE MIGRANTS THE<br />
SAME REWARDS AND OPPORTUNITIES AS OTHER AUSTRALIANS.<br />
WE NO LONGER CONCENTRATE ON BRINGING VAST NUMIBERS<br />
OF NEW SETTLERS TO AUSTRALIA. ARE NOT INTERESTED IN NUMBERS<br />
FOR THEIR OWN SAKE. THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE IN OUR<br />
FUTURE IS TO ENSURE THAT MIGRANTS ALREADY IN AUSTRALIA LEAD<br />
SECURE AND HAPPY LIVES. AUSTRALIA'S MIGRANT INTAKE IS NOW LARGELY<br />
DETERMINED BY MIGRANTS THEMSELVES, THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE<br />
GIVEN PRIORITY IN THE SELECTION OF MIGRANTS TO THE REUNION OF<br />
FAMILIES, NO TESTS OF ACCEPTABILITY BEYOND THOSE OF SOUND<br />
HEALTH AND GOOD CHARACTER ARE APPLIED TO THOSE ,' vHO WISH TO<br />
JOIN THEIR FAMILIES IN AUSTRALIA. 1,/ 8 </p>
<p>WE BELIEVE THE PEOPLE ' MOST LIKELY TO SETTLE HAPPILY IN<br />
AUSTRALIA ARE THOSE WHO COME HERE TO JOIN MEMBERS OF<br />
THEIR OWN FAMILY. CUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE<br />
PROGRAMS HAVE VASTLY IMPROVED THE LIVING STANDARDS OF<br />
MIGRANT PEOPLE, AND JUST AS IMPORTANT, HAVE HELPED TO<br />
INVOLVE THEM MORE CLOSELY IN COMMUNITY DECISIONS AND<br />
PLANNING, PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE<br />
! PLAN, COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES AND REDS IMPORTANT AS<br />
i THEY ARE FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS ARE OF PARTICULAR BENEFIT TO<br />
MIGRANTS BECAUSE OF THE ENCOURAGEMENT THEY GIVE FOR<br />
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS AND GOVERNMENT<br />
ACTION. IT IS TIME GOVERNMENTS GAVE MORE TANGIBLE<br />
RECOGNITION TO THOSE WHO HAVE DONE MUCH TO BUILD) AUSTRALIAN<br />
SOCIETY, THE ITALIANS WHO CAME TO AUSTRALIA CONTRIBUTED<br />
GREATLY TO OUR WAY OF LIFE. AUSTRALIANS OWE A LASTING DEBT<br />
TO THE ITALIAN CANEGROWERS IN [ ORTH QUEENSLAND, THE ITALIAN<br />
GOLDMINERS IN W'ESTERN AUSTRALIA, THE ITALIAN TOBACCO GROWERS<br />
IN VICTORIA AND W'ESTERN AUSTRALIA, THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE<br />
GROWERS OF VICTORIA AND iEW SOUTH !" I'ALES, THE SNOWY ' MOUNTAINS<br />
SCHEME WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE WORK OF ITALIAN<br />
RIGGERS AND ENGINEERS, THE ITALIAN COMMUNITY HAS HAD A<br />
REAL INFLUENCE IN THE SMALL BUSINESS FIELD AS WELL AS<br />
IN LARGER ENTERPRISES SUCH AS THE TRANSFIELD CORPORATION.<br />
[ RY GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT TO RECOGNISE THIS CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO AUSTRALIAN LIFE AND PROSPERITY BY THE APPOINTMEiNT-OF / 9 </p>
<p>DR. EVASIO COSTANZO TO THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL, CLAUDE PLCORSO<br />
TO THE UNIVERSITIES COMMlISSION, AND NOT LEAST, YOUR CLUB PRESIDENTd<br />
e fj 3BAYUTTI, TO THE BOARD OF QANTAS.<br />
ONE OF THE GREAT REWARDS OF MY 23 YEARS IN PUBLIC<br />
LIFE HAS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AND MIX WITH MEMBERS OF THE<br />
AusTRALIAN ITALIAN COMMUNITY. IHAVE MADE MANY DEEP AND LASTING<br />
FRIENDSHIPS; I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS IN HOSPITABLE SURROUNDINGS<br />
AMONG ITALIAN PEOPLE. I HOPE THE TIME WILL COME WHEN OUR GREAT<br />
MIGRANT COInlNITIES WILL NO LONGER SEEM SEPARATE OR DISTINCT GROUPS<br />
BUT INTEGRAL PARTS OF SOCIETY; WHEN HAVING AN ITALIAN NAME WILL<br />
SEEM NO MORE REMARKABLE THAN HAVING AN ENGLISH OR AN IRISH NAME. WE<br />
HAVE OF COURSE MOVED A LONG WAY IN GENERAL SOCIAL ATTITUDES<br />
IN THE SPIRIT OF TOLEANCE AND ACCEPTANCE SINCE THAT GREAT MASS<br />
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE BEGAN WITH THE PROCLN ATION OF AN ITALIAN<br />
REPUBLIC 29 YEARS AGO. WE STILL HAVE FURTHER TO MOVE. FOR MY<br />
PART I NEVER FORGET AND I SAID AS MUCH IN ROME THAT ALMOST<br />
EVERYTHING THAT IS BASIC TO AUSTRALIAN LIFE THE ORIGINS OF OUR<br />
CULTURE AND CIVILISATION, OUR ART, OUR SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL VALUES,<br />
MUCH OF OUR LANGUAGE CAME-TO US FROM ITALY. IT IS A LONG HISTORIC<br />
PROCESS. IT IS STILL CONTINUING. IT IS NOURISHED BY ORGANISATIONS<br />
SUCH AS APIA AND BY THE VIGOUR, THE CHARM, THE INDUSTRIOUS SPIRIT,<br />
THE GREATNESS OF THE ITALIAN PEOPLE, </p>
