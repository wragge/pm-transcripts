ELECTORAL TALK<br />
The drought now affecting the rural community in many parts<br />
of Australia is emerging as one of Australia's. biggest<br />
farming problems.<br />
Across the rich agricultural and pastoral areas of Australia<br />
the severe drought conditions are daily growing more important.<br />
In Victoria for instance, very large parts of the State are<br />
affected by the drought, while in South Australia all of the<br />
local government authority areas are severely affected.<br />
In Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania there are<br />
also serious problems.<br />
The prolonged and widespread drought has caused considerable<br />
and direct hardship to thousands of Australian families on<br />
the land. It is also certainly having a flow-on effect in<br />
cities in all states where food prices have moved up and some<br />
produces are in short supply.<br />
The Gover-e-t has recognized the hardship the drought has<br />
caused to Australia's beef and dairy industries in particular.<br />
It has conpcun. ded the already difficult positions of dairymen<br />
and cattle-en.<br />
The Government has moved quickly to assist.<br />
For a long time the Commonwealth has been involved in supporting<br />
the drought relief measures of the states.<br />
The principal of Commonwealth support has been traditionally<br />
in the transport subsidy of fodder or stock to or from drought<br />
areas, and in concessional loans for needy producers from the<br />
states where finance is not otherwise available.<br />
Early this month the Government announced that this relief would<br />
be taken a step further. We decided to underwrite the costs of<br />
carting water to drought areas to ensure the survival of stock.<br />
This is a new form of assistance. It has been welcomed by farmers.<br />
Additionally, the Government has decided to provide up to one<br />
dollar a head for cattle and up to 15 cents a head for sheep<br />
to state and local government authorities involved in the<br />
slaughter and disposal of unsaleable stock in drought areas. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
More importantly perhaps, the Government has also decided<br />
to allow eligible producers a slaughter compensation of up<br />
to $ 10 a head for cattle.<br />
As recently announced by Ian Sinclair, Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, the Government has also set up a Standing Committee<br />
of Comonwealth public servants to monitor the current<br />
drought situation.<br />
Other measures are under examination including support for the<br />
purchase of feed grains.<br />
This Committee will examine the efficiency of drought assistance<br />
measures and also report to the Government on other avenues<br />
of further assistance.<br />
There is no question that these four Government initiatives<br />
alone will go a significant way in helping farmers through<br />
an extraordinarily difficult time.<br />
Possible Government support for the purchase of feed grains<br />
as I have indicated is oneof the areas being looked at.<br />
The Government has also shown a commonsense and flexible<br />
attitude to the way in which finance is provided to state<br />
governments to administer these programmes.<br />
In Victoria for instance, the Commonwealth has suggested<br />
that an alternative method of finance could be considered<br />
as that S-ate's support was not expected to reach the required<br />
level of basic expenditure.<br />
There has for many years been a base amount which the states<br />
would s-end and then all programmes would be fully financed<br />
by the Ccmcrwealth after the states had reached that basic<br />
expendi-t-re am-ount.<br />
In Victoria's case the basic expenditure was $ 3 million.<br />
Any dollar ever and above that sum would be totally provided by<br />
the Comnon-eal th.<br />
There was some criticism of this traditional approach from<br />
Victoria and from New South Wales and therefore I offered an<br />
alternative to the states if they want to pick it up and<br />
that is that we would match dollar for dollar total expenditure<br />
from the very first dollar that was spent. I have not yet<br />
heard whether the states would prefer that alternative approach.<br />
The Govern-ent has shown it's concern for the plight of the rural<br />
community i: n many ways. Our initiatives on drought relief<br />
measures are an example of our continuing recognition of the<br />
importance of Australia's rural community. They are also a<br />
recognition of the damage being done to that community by drought.<br />
This evening I also want to mention the recently announced<br />
Government decision to set up an enquiry into the relationship<br />
between education and training.<br />
The comirtee of enquiry will look at the whole field of post<br />
secondary education. It will also look at the broader problem<br />
of the relationship between education and the labour market. </p>
<p>The Government is particularly concerned that education become<br />
relevant to a person's later life. It is concerned that the<br />
resources devoted to education should be used to maximum effect<br />
and that unneces'sary duplication be avoided.<br />
This enquiry the first of its kind for more than 10 years<br />
will take a medium and long term view of all the implications<br />
of our changing structure of education and retraining programmes.<br />
The Government believes that education opportunities should be<br />
widespread. We believe that greater education and occupational<br />
choices should be provided. We also strongly believe that<br />
community participation in education should be encouraged and<br />
standards raised.<br />
It is against this background that the committee will conduct<br />
its research.<br />
This enquiry will probably be the most important and far-reaching<br />
in this field ever established in this country. It will be<br />
a wide ranging and significant enquiry that will benefit<br />
Australians for many years in the future. </p>
