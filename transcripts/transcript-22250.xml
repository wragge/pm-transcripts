    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to turn the first sod on a major project to upgrade a 54 kilometre section of Main Road 92 between Nowra and Nerriga.</p>
<p>The Australian Government places a high priority on strengthening growth and opportunities in regional Australia.  That is why the Australian Government is providing $34 million towards the $80 million cost of upgrading Main Road 92.</p>
<p>  This project is of enormous significance to the people in the Shoalhaven and Illawarra regions of New South Wales and will deliver many benefits for local communities.</p>
<p>The upgrading of Main Road 92 will improve links to Canberra and Queanbeyan and to many other regional centres across southern New South Wales including Gunning, Goulburn and Braidwood.  It will also deliver lower freight costs, reduced travel times and improved road safety.</p>
<p>This will provide a major catalyst for regional economic growth.  Hundreds of new jobs are expected to be generated, not only from the road works themselves but from the expansion of other sectors which will benefit from the improved links.</p>
<p>An upgraded road will open up new and more efficient freight routes and provide improved access to Port Kembla.  There will be increased tourism opportunities, with easier access to the coast from the inland regions of New South Wales.</p>
<p>  The Australian Government has a strong commitment to regional development and to working in partnership with communities, governments and the private sector to foster the development of self-reliant communities and regions.</p>
<p> This road is just one of many being funded under the Australian Government's $12.7 billion AusLink programme.  This five-year programme represents a major commitment to improved planning and accelerated development of Australia's land transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>  I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the Shoalhaven City Council and the NSW Government to this important project.  </p>
