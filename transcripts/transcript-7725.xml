TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, WILLS ELECTORATE OFFICE, MELBOURNE,<br />
24 AUGUST 1989<br />

PM: The airlines will not succumb and so arrangements<br />

skeleton service and this is being done with the combination<br />
of the international airlines and the RAAF.<br />
JOURNALIST: This looks like being a protracted dispute<br />
then?<br />
PM: Well I hope not but we are not going to give in on this<br />
because it's not just a question of the pilots. As I've<br />
said quite clearly and there's no need to elaborate on it<br />
what's at issue is the whole welfare of Australia, the<br />
whole economy, the whole wages system. If the pilots were<br />
to win this, the whole wage system would break down and the<br />
economy would be wrecked and I'm not going to tolerate that.<br />
