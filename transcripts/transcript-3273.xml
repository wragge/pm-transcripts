1974 ELECTIONS<br />
STomorrow's election will be the biggest ever held in Australia.<br />
There are three ballot papers and record numbers of candidates.<br />
In most States, and especially in New South Wales, the Senate<br />
ballot paper is unusually long.<br />
T All this will make voting arduous for many people.<br />
It will test their care and their patience. I frankly acknowledge,<br />
as I did at the outset of this campaign, the formidable task that<br />
voters will face.<br />
I need hardly stress that the size of the Senate ballot paper<br />
is quite outside the Governmient's control. Record numbers of<br />
Australians have exercised their democratic right to contest<br />
the Senate election. Under the electoral law, voters must<br />
number every square on the ballot paper if their votes are to<br />
be counted. In these circumstances it is all the more important to<br />
exercise' care at the polling booth. This is an election of<br />
supreme importance. We cannot afford a wasted vote.<br />
SI appeal to voters to take their time when voting. Do not<br />
be unduly hurried or hustled. Check that you have numbered every<br />
square in sequence, that no numbers have been repeated or left out.<br />
0 Follow your how-to-vote card exactly.<br />
If you make a mistake it is your right to obtain another<br />
ballot paper and fill it in again. If in doubt about anything,<br />
seek advice from an officer at the polling station.<br />
The Electoral office has responded splendidly to the challenge<br />
presented by this election. It is providing a record number of<br />
booths at the polling stations.<br />
I am satisfied that these arrangements will fully meet the nedc<br />
of voters and keep delays to a minimum.<br />
Every voter has a legal right to vote in the privacy of a booth.<br />
There will be ample booths for this purpose. / 2 </p>
<p>if, however, a voter wishes to avoid any delay in queueing<br />
for the use of a booth, he may conmaete his ballot paper anywv. here<br />
in the precincts of the polling station. in doing so he should<br />
be guided by the wishes of electoral officers.<br />
it is important at all timLes to exercise patience and care.<br />
Let us make every vote count. Let this great exercise in<br />
democracy reflect the wishes of a diligent, intelligent and<br />
responsible electorate.<br />
