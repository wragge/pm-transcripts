P. M. No. 2311961<br />
ATTORNEY-GENERAL RETURNING<br />
Statement by~ the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Commonwealth Attorney-General ( Sir Garfield<br />
Barwick) left London by air on Wednesday on his return<br />
journey to Australia. He took a leading part in the two cases in the<br />
Privy Council in which hotel-keepers in Melbourne and<br />
Brisbane challenged the validity of the licence fees imposed<br />
by State law. The States of Victoria and Queensland, supported<br />
by the Commonwealth and by the other four States, succeeded in<br />
establishing, as a preliminary point, that the question raised<br />
by the hotel-keepers could not be entertained by the Privy<br />
Council except upon a certificate by the High Court of<br />
Australia, under section 74 of the Constitution, which the<br />
appellants had not sought to obtain. The majority decision of<br />
the High Court in favour of the States therefore stands.<br />
The Privy Coincil's decision made an important<br />
clarification of the constitutional position of the High<br />
Court, and extended, in line with legal thought in Australia,<br />
the constitutional cases in which an appeal to the Privy<br />
Council will not be available without a certificate from the<br />
High Court. The Attorney-General will interrupt his journey<br />
to make brief calls at Karachi, New Delhi, Bangkok, Kuala<br />
Lumpur and Singapore. He is expected to reach Sydney at the<br />
end of next week.<br />
CANBERRA,<br />
llth May, 1961. </p>
