ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE AUSTRALIA DAY FAIR: ADELAIDE<br />
I am delighted to be able to open this Australia Day Fair.<br />
When Governor Phillip raised the Union Jack at Camp Cove 189<br />
years ago, I am sure he could not have imagined the irmmense<br />
progress that Australia would make in the relatively short time<br />
span of 189 years. For the first few years following the historic<br />
flag raising, the early settlers celebrated the occasion as<br />
" Anniversary Day". Not that there was much cause for celebration.<br />
Things were tough, crops were hard to cultivate and stcocks were,<br />
for the first years at least, meagre. But the first Australians<br />
came through it, and since those days Australians have faced<br />
great challenges together and overcome them.<br />
Men and women from all the world's nations have come to live<br />
in Australia seeking in their own way to build a better life for<br />
themselves and their children. In the last thirty years, more<br />
than three million migrants have come to Australia, attracted by<br />
the opportunities which Australia offers, Australia's freedom<br />
and its equality.<br />
This Fair was inaugurated by the Good Neighbour Council in 1975<br />
to invite South Australians to acknowledge and participate in<br />
the commemoration of Australia Day. The Fair demonstrates that<br />
Australia is a multicultural community and has benefited immensely<br />
from the mixture of cultures. Ethnic arts and craft displays<br />
take their place in this Fair alongside surf life savingr displays,<br />
emergency fire fighting displays, demonstrations, marching girls,<br />
gymnastics and folk dancing from many countries. Ethnic cultures<br />
have added a new dimension of diversity and richness to the<br />
traditions of those other migrants, the English, Scots and Irish.<br />
What is emerging from this is a distinctive Australian culture<br />
which is derived from the best all cultures can offer.<br />
Fortunately, the days of Anglo-Saxon conformity are over, and I<br />
believe that we are all better off as a nation and as individuals<br />
because of this. One can love Australia and participate effectively<br />
in Australian life as is obvious today while retaining an<br />
affection and preserving the heritage of one's culture an.-d origin.<br />
The number of people who refuse to recognise this are rapidly<br />
diminishing and this is as it should be. / Today </p>
<p>2<br />
Today we are a nation of 13.5 million people and one quarter of<br />
our people were either born overseas or are the children of migrants.<br />
Without the contribution made by migrants, we would be limited in<br />
both our achievements and our aspirations, limited in our capacity<br />
to grasp the promise Australia holds out. We would be poorer<br />
economically, demographically and culturally. A great contribution<br />
has been made by ethnic groups to Australia' s culture, and Australia<br />
should, in turn, make a contribution to enhancing and preserving<br />
the culture of the countries from which migrants came.<br />
This Fair is a particularly appropriate place to announce that the<br />
Australian Government will be contributing $ 100,000 to the appeal<br />
for the preservation of the Acropolis, which UNESCO is undertaking<br />
in conjunction with the Greek Government. The Acropolis is one of<br />
the most magnificent achievements of human civilisation. To this<br />
day it is still looked to as the foundation and inspiration of our<br />
architecture, and it must be the greatest symbol of the Greek<br />
civilisation which contributed so fundamentally to western civilisation.<br />
The Acropolis, having been pillaged by the citizens of numerous<br />
nations in the past, some under the pretext that they were protecting<br />
its treasures, has now been attacked by a more modern enemy<br />
atmospheric pollution. Pollution has been eroding the marble<br />
surfaces and other stones, and there is an urgent need for restoration<br />
work. The monies from the appeal will be used to carry out this<br />
work. Our contribution to the appeal is a token of Australia's<br />
regard both for the architectural splendour of the Acropolis and for<br />
the contribution made by Greeks to Australian society. It is a<br />
demonstration of our recognition that Australia is a vital multicultural<br />
society, and of our concern with the fanner homelands of<br />
all Australian citizens.<br />
Today, while we are celebrating Australia Day as a holiday, I<br />
believe we should all reflect on Australia's past, her present<br />
and her future. We should reflect on the values that make us proud<br />
of Australia and led us to make Australia our home. We should<br />
reflect on what we have done to strengthen these values and what<br />
we may have done to weaken them. We should reflect on whether we<br />
have just taken our values for granted and not thought at all.<br />
Then we should reflect on what we are going to do about making<br />
Australia the better place of which we all dream. </p>
