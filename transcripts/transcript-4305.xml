ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER AT CITIZENSHIP CEREMONY, TOWN HALL,<br />
SYDNEY<br />
It is a great pleasure f or me to be here today to witness your<br />
citizenship ceremony. I am sure that this is an important moment<br />
in your lives, and it is a proud moment for Australia. Around<br />
the country, at fifty or more ceremonies timed to coincide with<br />
Australia Day, our national day, 3,000 people from a score of<br />
different nationalities, will be becoming Australian citizens.<br />
The granting of citizenship and its acceptance are acts of<br />
mutual respect and confidence. The grant of citizenship shows<br />
Australia's confidence in the ability of the people becoming<br />
citizens to make a valuable contribution to the nation. The<br />
acceptance of citizenship is a mark of the confidence men and<br />
women from other nations have in Australia, and their wish to<br />
identify their destiny with Australia. Citizenship does not<br />
require forsaking earlier affections and ties. A perscon can<br />
love Australia fully and participate productively and responsively<br />
in Australia's national life while retaining his affection for the<br />
country of his birth, treasuring its memories, its culture and<br />
its language. The people who mistakenly believed new citizens<br />
could only embrace Australia by denying their country of birth,<br />
and who were intolerant of those who refused to accept this point<br />
of view, are fortunately fast dwindling in numbers and even more<br />
rapidly in significance. Both Australia and our new settlers<br />
have benefited greatly from their association.<br />
In the last 30 years, more than 3 million people from all the<br />
worlds countries have migrated to Australia, seeking to make a<br />
better life for themselves and their children. They have been<br />
attracted by the opportunities Australia offers, Australia's<br />
freedom and its equality. People like yourselves have made an<br />
enormous contribution to Australia's development enriching<br />
Australia both materially and culturally. Since the great<br />
migration programmes were initiated in the mid-1940s, new<br />
settlers have enabled Australia to aspire to and achieve things<br />
which would not otherwise have been possible. Australia could<br />
not have made the economic progress she has, could not have<br />
undertaken the massive development works, enlarged so greatly<br />
her commerce, industry and agriculture, without the hard work<br />
of migrants from all countries. In terms of population, without<br />
the inflow of migrants, Australia would today be a nation of only<br />
ten million people occupying a country the size of the United<br />
States. We are in fact a nation of 13.5 million people, and<br />
one quarter of our people have either been born overseas or are<br />
the children of migrants. / But </p>
<p>-2<br />
But the economic and demographic contributions migrants have made<br />
are by no means their sole or even their most important contributions<br />
to our society.<br />
Migrants and their children have excelled in every sphere of cultural,<br />
scientific, intellectual and artistic life. Ethnic cultures have<br />
added a new dimension of diversity and richness to the traditions<br />
of those other migrants, the English, Scots and Irish. To focus<br />
totally on the positive side of migration for the migrant and for<br />
Australia, how'ever, is to present an incomplete picture.<br />
Migration has its costs for the migrant as you will all know. The<br />
fact that one moves from one society to another imposes great pressures<br />
on the individual even though he moves by his own free will in<br />
pursuit of his aspirations for a better life. The psychological and<br />
social tensions produced by migration are great, language difficulties<br />
are often severe and there are always initial economic difficulties to<br />
be faced without the support provided by family and well known friends.<br />
Going from one land to another with a different culture, history and<br />
often a different language is an act of courage venture into the<br />
unknown. This is part of the reason we have placed so much emphasis<br />
on family reunion so that migrants can join relatives who have<br />
already charted a path through Australian society.<br />
Invariably, the migration experience involves a complex and difficult<br />
period of adjustment. There is a great deal that needs to be done to<br />
assist migrants to overcome the difficulties of the migration<br />
experience, and we are establishing the structures with which this<br />
can be more effectively done. We are acting to get greater coordination<br />
by all departments of the Commonwealth Government providing<br />
assistance to migrants. The formation of the new Ethnic Affairs<br />
Unit in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is intended<br />
to advance policies designed to secure the integration of migrants<br />
for functional departments and authorities -to implement. Most<br />
departments have some responsibility with respect ID migrant affairs,<br />
and we are placing special emphasis on meeting the needs of migrants.<br />
Particular attention has been given to extend the interpreting and<br />
translating services available to newcomers to this country who<br />
have difficulty in speaking English. We are seeking to enhance<br />
the resources of ethnic communities so that they can extend the<br />
services they provide to migrants. At the moment, we are beginning<br />
an imaginative experiment with ethnic resource centres in Melbourne<br />
and Sydney which should give us greater insight into the mix of<br />
Government and commnunity involvement necessary for the most<br />
sensitive and effective assistance to migrants.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australia welcomed you when you came here,<br />
you have sustained yourselves through the difficult period of<br />
adjusting to a new society. It is a very real honour now to be<br />
able to welcome you as fellow citizens. </p>
