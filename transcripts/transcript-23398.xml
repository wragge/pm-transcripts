    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will develop a Defence White Paper to be released next year which will underpin a costed, affordable plan to achieve Australia’s defence and national security objectives.</p>
<p>The White Paper will align defence policy with military strategy and deliver an affordable Australian Defence Force structure.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to returning Defence spending to two per cent of Australia’s Gross Domestic Product in the next decade as our budgetary position improves.</p>
<p>The Defence White Paper will assist in developing a costed acquisition programme and a 10-year Defence Capability Plan and an updated Defence Industry Policy Statement.</p>
<p>It will be informed by the Government’s Commission of Audit and a first-principles review of the Department of Defence that will be undertaken during 2014.</p>
<p>The Defence White Paper will also consider the merits of an enhanced Defence presence in northern Australia.</p>
<p>It will draw on parallel work being done on the Northern Australia White Paper, which the Government is developing in partnership with Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>In developing the White Paper, the Department of Defence will consult with industry, the public, Australia’s allies and regional partners.</p>
<p>The White Paper’s development will be supported by the Expert Panel announced previously by the Minister for Defence.</p>
<p>This Panel will provide input at all stages of the process, to challenge any key assumptions and ensure strong public consultation during the development of the White Paper.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to building a strong, capable and sustainable Australian Defence Force that will ensure our security and support our strategic interests into the future.</p>
