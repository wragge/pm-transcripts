<p>CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALAN GRIFFITHS' DINNER FOR<br />
WESTERN SUBURBS COMMUNITY LEADERS<br />
MOONEE PONDS 21 AUGUST 1989<br />
Alan Griffiths, commitment to the people of Melbourne's<br />
western suburbs is nowhere better demonstrated than in his<br />
support for the establishment of a new University on this<br />
side of the city.<br />
The decades of conservative government in Canberra and in<br />
Melbourne through most of the 1950s, 60s and 70s were<br />
decades of neglect for the western suburbs.<br />
neglect in the provision of the basic services and<br />
social infrastructure that people in the better off<br />
suburbs take for granted.<br />
This neglect was specially marked in the provision of<br />
education services.<br />
For too long, children of the western suburbs were denied<br />
the vital educational opportunities they deserve.<br />
You have probably heard me narrate, with pride, the story of<br />
what I consider one of this government's greatest<br />
achievements. It's an achievement measured in better lives and brighter<br />
futures.<br />
We want to ensure that all young people, regardless of where<br />
they live or how well off their parents are, have the<br />
opportunity to complete a full 12 years of education.<br />
When we came to office in March 1983 we found that<br />
tragically, under the Liberals, only about one out of every<br />
three school children was staying on to Year 12.<br />
What a waste that figure represented a waste of human<br />
resources, a waste of young lives, a wasteful denial of the<br />
aspirations that Australian kids are entitled to have for a<br />
decent education and a good start in life. </p>
<p>And worse, that waste was accompanied by an imbalance,<br />
within the Australian community, regarding the educational<br />
achievement of our school kids.<br />
Within Melbourne, in 1983 the retention rate for students in<br />
state high schools in the Western Metropolitan area was<br />
lower than the overall Metropolitan rate, and the Eastern<br />
Metropolitan figure was higher.<br />
We were determined to rectify that waste and that imbalance,<br />
and we have.<br />
The changes we made have dramatically lifted the number of<br />
kids who are getting this vital chance in life of finishing<br />
secondary school.<br />
Now, about 58 per cent of students finish their schooling.<br />
Within Melbourne, all sections of the city have better<br />
retention rates and the imbalance of six years ago has been<br />
wiped out. In fact, the Western Metropolitan figure is now<br />
slightly higher than the overall figure for Melbourne.<br />
So that dramatic turnaround is one of Labor's greatest<br />
achievements in office.<br />
But unfortunately there are still educational imbalances<br />
within this city especially at the tertiary level.<br />
In Andrew Peacock's electorate of Kooyong, about a quarter<br />
of the population 23 per cent have tertiary<br />
qualifications while in this electorate of Maribyrnong less<br />
than 9 per cent have them. In some electorates in the<br />
western suburbs the figure is even lower.<br />
That hasn't happened because people here are any less well<br />
endowed at birth with intellect, or any less determined to<br />
succeed in life.<br />
It isn't because tertiary training is less valued in the<br />
western suburbs.<br />
It's because of lack of opportunity.<br />
In particular there has been no university in this part of<br />
the city to open the doors to new levels of academic<br />
endeavour and to set new standards of academic excellence.<br />
Now we haven't been idle in expanding tertiary educational<br />
opportunities in the western suburbs.<br />
We have provided almost $ 13 million for the construction of<br />
Broadmeadows College of TAFE, and we are contributing a<br />
further $ 3 million for a new computing complex at the<br />
College where construction is expected to start next year. </p>
<p>3.<br />
We created the Western Institute in 1986, with the<br />
co-operation of the Victorian Government, providing the<br />
western suburbs with tertiary opportunities ranging from<br />
basic trades and technical courses through to diplomas and<br />
degrees. At the Footscray Institute of Technology, we have increased<br />
student numbers through to 1991.<br />
And tonight, we can look with pride on the fact that thanks<br />
to the work of Alan Griffiths, and many other people, my<br />
Government and John Cain's Government have agreed to provide<br />
new resources for a fifth university in Victoria to<br />
rectify the neglect of those past decades of conservative<br />
neglect. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology RMIT the<br />
Western Institute and the Footscray Institute of Technology<br />
are to combine to give the western suburbs access to a world<br />
class University of Technology with enhanced funding for<br />
both research and research teaching.<br />
It will be a place that will attract the best minds and<br />
serve as a target for local kids who want to get the best<br />
qualifications in higher education.<br />
We have already committed more than $ 375 million to the new<br />
university, including $ 55 million for capital development up<br />
to 1991.<br />
Now I am very pleased to inform you of our most recent<br />
progress towards this goal.<br />
Already, the State Government has made development of this<br />
university its number one priority in planning for Victorian<br />
higher education growth in the future. Commonwealth<br />
commitments for growth and capital in 1992 will be announced<br />
shortly but we do know there is overwhelming community<br />
support for the project and we too are prepared to accord<br />
the highest priority for capital funding to the campus at<br />
St Albans.<br />
My colleague, John Dawkins, has recently written to the<br />
State Minister for Post-secondary Education, Evan Walker,<br />
outlining the financial commitments we have decided to make<br />
to the new university.<br />
John Dawkins' letter spelt out that additional funds will<br />
flow to the new university for growth in places in the West.<br />
We also want to see a steady development of the research<br />
capacity of the new university. We will be helping to bring<br />
this about both through operating grants and through the<br />
significant new money for research that I announced recently<br />
as part of our new Science and Technology package. </p>
<p>So this is the very concrete assistance we're providing to<br />
ensure that, like the rest of Melbourne, the Western suburbs<br />
have access to a world class university.<br />
In an era of fiscal restraint, this decision shows again<br />
that Labor in Canberra and at the State level is getting<br />
it right. We're expanding educational opportunities and<br />
building a fairer society.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is a pleasure to be here in this part of Melbourne so<br />
soon after Williamstown's success in the competition for the<br />
frigate contract.<br />
Over the last few years Williamstown has undergone a<br />
complete transformation.<br />
A few years ago let's be frank the Williamstown Naval<br />
Dockyards' record of industrial problems, exacerbated by<br />
restrictive work practices and poor management, left a lot<br />
to be desired.<br />
There was a very real chance that after some 140 years as a<br />
major focus of port activity, Williamstown was about to<br />
become an industrial ghost town. But the last two years saw<br />
a dramatic turn around.<br />
The region is now one of the fastest growing areas in<br />
Melbourne and it is no exaggeration to say that Wiliamstown<br />
is a leading centre for marine technology.<br />
This transformation didn't happen by accident.<br />
It happened because employers and employees made the<br />
conscious decision to make it happen.<br />
As a result of reducing -demarcation disputes, improving<br />
productivity and enhancing work skills through on-site<br />
training, Wiliamstown Dockyards has become a model of<br />
industrial restructuing.<br />
So it was no surprise that Williamstown, along with a<br />
consortium in Newcastle, put together tenders for the<br />
frigate project which was of world standard.<br />
Both here and in Newcastle, the workforce, the employers and<br />
the State Government presented Canberra with a united<br />
determination to make a success of our largest defence<br />
project ever.<br />
And the real winner is Australia, because the fact that we<br />
could have two shipyards capable of undertaking this huge<br />
project proves in the most dramatic fashion that the whole<br />
Australian economy has undergone a transformation of<br />
similarly dramatic dimensions as Williamstown's own<br />
turnaround. </p>
<p>Under the Accord between the Federal Government and the<br />
trade union movement, and more generally through our<br />
capacity as a community to work together for our mutual<br />
economic advantage, we are seeing the emergence of an<br />
industrial culture committed to quality, competitiveness and<br />
productivity. I want to pay unqualified tribute to the men and women of<br />
the Australian workforce whose wisdom and commitment,<br />
matched by a new attitude on behalf of employers, has made<br />
this possible.<br />
Australians now understand that the practices of<br />
uncompetitiveness and the habits of confrontationism<br />
fostered by the conservatives for most of the post-war<br />
decades must be abandoned.<br />
Wage earners have understood that wage restraint creates<br />
jobs some one and a half million since 1983 and makes us<br />
more internationally competitive.<br />
Employers and employees have understood that greater work<br />
effectiveness creates a greater economic capacity to pay<br />
wages. Industries that were sheltered behind the walls of<br />
protectionism have understood that long-term success lies<br />
with freer trade.<br />
At the level of the Federal Government there has been an<br />
equally marked transformation.<br />
The contrast between the seventh Budget of the Hawke<br />
Government and the seventh Budget of the Fraser Government<br />
provides dramatic proof of that assertion.<br />
Their seventh Budget was brought down in 1982 It will go<br />
down in history as the last of the pork barrel budgets. Its<br />
only strategy was the strategy of cynicism.<br />
The results of that lack of leadership were very clear and<br />
they were very painful:<br />
the worst recession Australia had known since the Great<br />
Depression; double digit unemployment and double digit inflation a<br />
unique, and tragic, testimony to economic mismanagement;<br />
and a massive prospective Budget deficit of more than<br />
$ 9 billion. </p>
<p>We have now turned that recession around. We have begun the<br />
vital process of making Australia a more flexible and<br />
competitive country. We have abandoned the Liberals'<br />
industrial confrontationism and put in its place a process<br />
of consultation and co-operation. And we have taken their<br />
prospective Budget deficit of more than $ 9 billion and<br />
turned it into a Budget surplus of more than $ 9 billion.<br />
Our seventh Budget showed our determination not to sacrifice<br />
our long term economic strategy a strategy that offers the<br />
only prospect for economic salvation for this nation on<br />
the altar of short term political expediency.<br />
With our seventh Budget we are on about securing the long<br />
term future of the Australian economy. With the Liberals'<br />
seventh Budget they were on about securing the short term<br />
future of themselves.<br />
we are succeeding at our task. They failed at theirs.<br />
They failed in their doomed attempt to hoodwink the<br />
electorate and they failed to tackle the real issues facing<br />
the economy.<br />
I don't want to spend a lot of time this evening outlining<br />
the broad macro-economic strategy of the Budget. That has<br />
already been well explained in the Budget and has, I<br />
believe, been well received by the community.<br />
What hasn't been fully understood yet is the sweeping nature<br />
of the changes to retirement policies that formed one of the<br />
highlights of the Budget.<br />
In terms of their impact on the individual well-being of<br />
Australian families, today and for decades into the future,<br />
these changes are of unparalleled signifiance.<br />
They prove once again that while this Government is getting<br />
on with the fundamental economic problems facing this<br />
country, we have not forgotten the cardinal rule that<br />
Government is about people.<br />
our social justice policies policies aimed at ensuring<br />
that the least well off members of the community have the<br />
assistance to which they are entitled is one of our<br />
proudest achievements in the traditional mould of Labor<br />
Governments. Brian Howe summed it up precisely when he said recently of<br />
our approach to spending on welfare: it's an " active,<br />
positive one that provides opportunities for people to leave<br />
the social security system, and a safety net for those<br />
unable to do so."<br />
We are spending today nearly $ 9 billion more on social<br />
justice than was being spent in 1982/ 83 an increase as a<br />
proportion of total public spending excluding public debt<br />
interest, from about 50 per cent to some 58 per cent this<br />
year. </p>
<p>That is a very substantial increase, especially given the<br />
dramatic reduction that has taken place in the number of<br />
people receiving unemployment benefits.<br />
Medicare, child care, public housing, care for the elderly,<br />
the unemployed and the sick are all important recipients of<br />
this spending.<br />
In this Budget we provide new assistance to the aged,<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, to homeless youth,<br />
to fee relief for child care not giveaway measures but<br />
steady, affordable help focussed on the areas of need in the<br />
community. Our policies on retirement income continue our determination<br />
to focus on the real issues affecting the prosperity of<br />
individual Australians.<br />
When we came to office, what we inherited in this field<br />
according to Ross Gittins of the Sydney Morning Herald,<br />
" couldn't be called a retirement incomes system. It was<br />
just a mess".<br />
There was simply no logic to a system where the millionaires<br />
were receiving the age pension, while for blue collar<br />
workers superannuation was a virtually unattainable dream.<br />
Now, taxpayers are paying the pension only to those elderly<br />
people who need it not to the millionaires.<br />
The result of that targetting, of course, means that needy<br />
people receive more assistance than they would otherwise.<br />
In this Budget we acheived our longstanding commitment to<br />
lift the age pension to 25 per cent of Average Weekly<br />
Earnings. At the same time, we have transformed superannuation from an<br />
unattainable dream to a practical reality within the reach<br />
of virtually every Australian employee.<br />
Right now about 65 per cent of workers are covered by award<br />
based superannuation, and by the end of the year this will<br />
rise to about 80 per cent.<br />
Why is it important that the Budget focussed on<br />
superannuation? It is because it is essential from the point of view both of<br />
individual families and of the whole economy that wherever<br />
possible people are encouraged to save for their retirement.<br />
Otherwise in a few years time, when. the baby boom generation<br />
starts to retire, there will be a huge burden placed on<br />
future taxpayers in the form of massive demand for pensions. </p>
<p>We hear a lot from the opposition about savings. You may<br />
recall that when Andrew Peacock was travelling around the<br />
country on his mock election campaign that he produced this<br />
half-baked scheme of inflation adjustment of interest. It<br />
really was a classic Peacock example of searching for a bit<br />
of meat to add to the feathers.<br />
Now Paul Keating and I have explained on a number of<br />
occasions why such a scheme would be a disaster. But you<br />
don't have to take our word for it. only last week<br />
Brian Loton, head of Australia's largest company, BHP,<br />
announced his verdict on the scheme: he said, " if you want<br />
to see indexation at work, go to Brazil."<br />
This Government is not in the Peacock game of half-baked<br />
gimmicks that make problems worse rather than cure them.<br />
Our commitment to superannuation is a commitment to real<br />
savings a long-term strategy to overc * ome Australia's<br />
long-term propensity to consume rather than to save.<br />
To provide incentives for people to save for their<br />
retirement, the Government will implement a three-stage<br />
reform of the social security and taxation systems.<br />
The first stage, announced in April 1989, will ensure that<br />
by next July, 80 per cent of all pensioners will not be<br />
required to pay income tax.<br />
Under the second stage, the Government will, in the<br />
following year, 1991, for the first time ever, index<br />
annually the pension income test free area so that it is not<br />
eroded by inflation.<br />
The third stage of reform, from 1995, will be the removal of<br />
all pensioners from the tax system, so that pensioners with<br />
income above the free area will be subject only to the<br />
pension income test.<br />
As part of the wage system for next financial year, we will<br />
consider the gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent<br />
award based occupational superannuation.<br />
Among other changes, we have also introduced rules to ensure<br />
that when people change jobs, they don't lose the super that<br />
has been paid on their behalf.<br />
And at the same time we have encouraged people to preserve<br />
their superannuation benefits until they actually retire.<br />
The limit on tax deductions for super contributions for the<br />
self employed will be increased, and workers on low or<br />
modest incomes with relatively small employer-funded<br />
superannuation will be able to top-up those funds and claim<br />
tax deductions.<br />
So these historic reforms will substantially assist current<br />
pensioners with income above the pension free area, and<br />
provide a major boost to incentives for those currently in<br />
the workforce to save for their retirement. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I referred before to the seventh budget of the doomed Fraser<br />
Government in 1982. It was their last budget.<br />
I want to express my complete confidence that our seventh<br />
budget, that Paul Keating brought down last week, will not<br />
be our last budget.<br />
The Liberals' seventh budget looked only to the next<br />
election, and as an inevitable result the Liberals were<br />
repudiated by the electorate.<br />
In our seventh budget we are looking beyond the election,<br />
setting in place the elements of our strategy for our next<br />
term of office and, if you like, beyond.<br />
Dramatic changes are underway within the economy the<br />
changes represented by the Williamstown dockyards; the<br />
changes represented by the establishment of a new university<br />
here in the western suburbs; the changes represented by our<br />
historic reforms to super and to age pensions.<br />
I want to reaffirm tonight our utmost commitment to<br />
continue, with energy and determination, this great task of<br />
reform on which we have embarked.<br />
That is a task whose successful completion will, I believe,<br />
be Labor's best guarantee of continued electoral success<br />
into the 1990s and Australia's best guarantee of greater<br />
prosperity and fairness. </p>
