TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE VICTORIA BARRACKS, MELBOURNE,<br />
JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: As you know the Cabinet has had a meeting here today in the War<br />
Cabinet room, on this the 50th anniversary of John Curtin's death and<br />
I have made remarks earlier about that. But it is an occasion which<br />
I think the Cabinet is pleased to have had on this anniversary and also<br />
we used the time to make a number of decisions and I have given you<br />
a press statement about one of them. But I am happy to take<br />
questions about any of them.<br />
J: Prime Minister you have clearly changed your assessment, of<br />
John Curtin, after five years ago you described him in a different way<br />
than you have today. What has changed that?<br />
PM: I haven't changed my assessment at all and I described him seven<br />
years ago, at the John Curtin Lecture in Perth, in similar terms as<br />
I have described him today.<br />
J: So he is no longer a trier Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well I am not here to answer silly questions by you, Glen [ Milne], and<br />
I have made my position about John Curtin clear. At the time it suited<br />
the then Prime Minister to make a political issue out of it for his own<br />
preservation and misrepresent my remarks. Curtin's position in<br />
Australia's history is guaranteed, completely guaranteed, as it ought to<br />
be.<br />
J: Do you think he is Australia's greatest Prime Minister Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well it is very hard to rank people about who were the greatest people.<br />
But certainly the only time Australia was threatened he was there to<br />
answer the call. He provided leadership. As I said this morning, he<br />
was pragmatic, decisive. He was a person who, I think, understood </p>
<p>what needed to be done and got around to doing it and in that sense<br />
the nation will always owe him a debt. He was the one who piloted us<br />
through the period of our greatest peril successfully and the strain of it<br />
probably killed him.<br />
J: Would he have necessarily made a good Prime Minister in peacetime,<br />
Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well I think so because he had the skills of leadership. I mean he<br />
was, above everything else as I said, passionate and decisive and his<br />
whole life was dedicated to civil issues. So I think Curtin is a person<br />
who could have made a transition. He made, in fact, the transition to<br />
the wartime leadership. It is not fair to see him, simply, as a wartime<br />
leader. I am quite certain that in the peace he would have been an<br />
enthusiast in the reconstruction of Australia.<br />
J: Have you been guilty of underplaying his achievements though?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think he is very warmly regarded and, I think,<br />
seriously regarded certainly by, what one may term, the Labor<br />
constituency. But I think more generally in the country because I think<br />
those of us who are now active in public life and the media, our<br />
parents and our families appreciated John Curtin and I think that<br />
flowed over to what we have learned of him and about him. So, I think,<br />
it is more than just simply the Labor Party or the Labor fraternity. It is<br />
actually quite a wide spread thing. Probably the most appreciated of<br />
the wartime and post-war Prime Ministers.<br />
J: Mr Keating what do you think about John Howard's comments on the<br />
Aboriginal flag?<br />
PM: Well there as mean-spirited as all his other comments are about<br />
minorities. You know someone summed it up a few weeks ago when<br />
John Howard was talking about this commentator said well<br />
John Howard was speaking a few years ago about One Australia, he<br />
meant One Wollstonecraft and they don't fly the Aboriginal flag in<br />
Wollstonecraft generally. I mean, that is his view of Australia. It is a<br />
dated view. As I have said of him, often, he is out of his age and he is<br />
out of his depth and I think Mr Viner's remarks today only make that<br />
point clear from the perspective of someone in the Liberal Party who<br />
has kept touch with the aspirations of Aboriginal and Islander people.<br />
J: What do you think recognition of that flag will mean?<br />
PM: Well it recognises it for what it is. That is it is the flag that Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people gives a status as recognising them'<br />
and their aspirations and the official recognition of it is to recognise<br />
only that. It is no more than a recognition of what is so. To guarantee<br />
its status. But I noticed, I mean Mr Howard he had a statement, I think,<br />
yesterday, I have come across, and this is typical of him. He said </p>
<p>3<br />
" flags have special places in the affections of the Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander people. This was evidenced by the very positive<br />
response to Cathy Freeman's gesture." In other words, he is now<br />
invoking her use of it saying that she was entitled to be proud of it, but<br />
by the way he won't recognise it. It is just the same as saying " you<br />
want a republic, I might give you the chance to vote on one, but I am<br />
actually for the Monarchy myself'. I mean he never stands for<br />
anything. He is utterly indecisive.<br />
J: But he says it downgrades the Australian flag?<br />
PM: Well that means that every other official flag has some diminishing<br />
status on the Australian flag which, of course, it doesn't have.<br />
The Australian flag is pre-eminent in this country amongst flags.<br />
J: Did you anticipate there would be criticism when you made your<br />
decisions?<br />
PM: No and, of course, can I say that the report this was one of the early<br />
recommendations in the report was shown to Mr Howard before it<br />
was published. He never took exception to any of it apparently. It has<br />
been there now for a couple of months. No-one else has said a word<br />
about it.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Oh, again, you know the sort of I think the notion that the place is still a<br />
sort of Anglo-Saxon monolith and any symbols that do anything about<br />
the monolith, you know, he generally objects to.<br />
J: But the Council for Aboriginal. Reconciliation recommended in order to<br />
change the-fia6 the Government should seek bipartisan support for it.<br />
Do you think it might have been a better tack to consult with the<br />
Coalition beforehand?<br />
PM: But there was bipartisan support for it. It was presented. The report,<br />
which went to all of the aspirations of Aboriginal people, had been a<br />
process of consultation with both parties. Mr Howard had been briefed<br />
before it was even published. I received it in the Mural Hall at<br />
Parliament House. When? 2 1/ 2 months ago, 3 months ago.<br />
Did anybody come and say from the Coalition this is a<br />
recommendation that we object to? Nobody did. That is only a<br />
post-event rational isation by them.<br />
J: The Council also recommended several other things like changing the<br />
preamble to the Constitution and reserving seats in Parliament for<br />
Aboriginal people. What do you say of those allegations? </p>
<p>PM: Well the fact that the Government has adopted this recommendation is<br />
not a signal that the Government is going to adopt holus bolus the<br />
recommendation or do it now. I mean at appropriate times we will<br />
consider the various recommendations and make decisions about<br />
them. But not on all of them now.<br />
J: Mr Keating what do you think this says about John Howard's attitude<br />
towards the Aboriginal people?<br />
PM: Well I think he doesn't understand the importance of when we talk<br />
about inclusion, about Australians coming together and being together,<br />
that when we think of our identity as a unique people in the world it<br />
must be about the inclusion and a basis of reconciliation with<br />
Aboriginal and Islander people. It must be about that as well as other<br />
things. He has never had the premium on that. He has never thought<br />
it was important. That is why his predecessor, but one, John Hewson<br />
said that the passage of the Mabo legislation was a day of shame.<br />
I mean the Liberal Party of this epoch and not the ones of past, but of<br />
this epoch, haven't seen the importance of Australia being at one with<br />
its indigenous population and coming to terms with them and<br />
reconciling differences with them. And this is another reason why I<br />
believe Mr Howard does belong to a period of Australian politics which<br />
is past. Everything he says reflects these things.<br />
J: You don't think he was trying to tap into any community hostility about<br />
the Aboriginal flag, do you?<br />
PM: I think the Coalition will say the things that they think are calculated to<br />
give them greatest immediate political effect. You know, no remark<br />
like this would be made without references to the Federal Secretariat<br />
or the pollsters or the rest. It is a constantly poll-driven approach by<br />
the Coalition and, therefore, it is all about what it means this week in<br />
terms of garnering public support without saying what does it mean for<br />
the country in the long rung.<br />
J: Will this forest statement cause many timber industries to close?<br />
PM: Well what it is about is forming a basis of negotiation for a regional<br />
forest agreements which is the only basis on which we will have a<br />
sustainable timber industry. That is if we have got representative<br />
reserve systems in place, whereby we can then have a sustainable<br />
forest products industry. This is the only way to have it and I think that<br />
is why we have had the commitment of most of the stakeholders in<br />
this. This is the way forward. We got the States to agree to the forest<br />
policy statement and to regional agreements. But we need the criteria<br />
and we have now adopted the criteria which will, I think as a<br />
consequence, set the scene for the establishment of a world class<br />
forest conservation reserve system and this I think will give protection<br />
to the high conservation value native forests and at the same time give<br />
us a basis for a sustainable industry. </p>
<p>J: Just on the current account speech last night. Can we take it from the<br />
speech that you don't think see the current account putting any<br />
pressure on interest rates?<br />
PM: Well I think the important thing is not what I say, it is what the market<br />
says. I mean what has happened long bonds in the last week have<br />
gone up from about 8.8, or 8.9, to 9.2 and there has been an even<br />
smaller change I think in terms of short term interest rates. So I think<br />
the market is giving us a fairly clear signal from that and reflecting on<br />
the forecasts which the Government made earlier in the year when<br />
Ralph Willis, the Treasurer, came out and said that the current<br />
account would be greater in this year 1994/ 95, that is the year just<br />
finished. In February was the week that John Howard came to office<br />
and everyone said " oh, this has given Mr Howard fillip. The<br />
Government announcing this." Well what you are seeing is some of<br />
the numbers coming in and I think we made clear last night that within<br />
that forecast there had to be a couple of large numbers otherwise, in a<br />
sense, the Government's sense of that forecast wouldn't have been<br />
met. Now, in other words, we were expecting some heavy numbers<br />
through this forecast period. So, too, I think was the market and the<br />
reaction of the market has been commensurate with its expectations.<br />
J: Prime Minister can we be sure that that monthly peak has been<br />
reached?<br />
PM: No you can't be sure. But I think what we can be sure of is that the<br />
current account deficit will decline as the growth in the economy<br />
coming off last year has subsided, so too will the current account<br />
deficit. That 5 or 6 per cent economic growth, which was producing. a<br />
lot of import demand as that has come back, so too will the current<br />
account. But the other important thing is the Government has put into<br />
place the remedial policy changes on savings on the Budget swinging<br />
in the next couple of years $ 20 billion back into surplus, about<br />
4 per cent of GDP, there are a couple of per cent of GDP on savings.<br />
We have got a good 5 or 6 per cent of GDP on savings to meet a<br />
2 1/ 2 percentage point problem.<br />
J: What is the timeframe though. I mean when do you see this impact?<br />
PM: I think we will see that coming together in the, you know, balance of<br />
the 90s the second half of the 90s. But that is a savings change. But<br />
not the slowing. I think the slowing in the current account will come<br />
with the next twelve months.<br />
J: Your visit to Yarralumla on Monday. Did that have any implications in<br />
terms of the timing of the decision for the next Governor-General and<br />
the choice? </p>
<p>PM: Not particularly. No I just had a general chat with the<br />
Governor-General about a range of things.<br />
J: You have said before that you don't have a short list in mind or a<br />
timeframe. Is that still the situation?<br />
PM: I haven't had. But I am starting to refine my thoughts about it.<br />
J: Is Mr Hayden's departure time flexible or is February a cutting off<br />
point?<br />
PM: No, but we said at the time, Her Majesty, I recommended and she<br />
accepted that the Governor General's time be extended to around<br />
February, or to February in 1996 and that is basically still the position.<br />
J: Prime Minister do you think the time is right for Australia to have its<br />
first woman Governor-General?<br />
PM: Well I think the time is right for a person to be appointed who will fulfil<br />
the role and responsibility adequately, who understands the sentiment<br />
in the country and the fact that the country is now in a very, has been<br />
for a decade, in a very large transition. I think they are the<br />
requirements rather than gender requirements.<br />
J: When do you expect to make the decision?<br />
PM: Well there is normally about a six month lead time on the process of<br />
consultation and I have got no reason to depart from that. So it is not<br />
that far away.<br />
J: Mr Keating do you reckon Martin Ferguson would be the best<br />
candidate for Batman?<br />
PM: I have got no idea whether Martin has expressed any interest in<br />
changing his role in life from the trade unions to the Federal<br />
Parliament. Were he ever to do that, he would be a very valuable<br />
member of any Labor Caucus because of his considerable contribution<br />
to the labour movement and his experience, but that is a matter for<br />
him.<br />
J: Are we close to a resolution on the appointment of General Mantiri?<br />
PM: Well it is not a matter of a resolution. I mean the prerogative is with<br />
the Government of Indonesia to nominate who they think can best<br />
represent that country and that Government in Australia. I think that<br />
the intention has been to provide to Australia a high ranking person.<br />
One who in this case whose rank comes from his military experience<br />
and in proposing someone of high rank in their society, they believe<br />
this is therefore giving both Indonesia and Australia the opportunity of<br />
having their interests represented well and giving us the opportunity to </p>
<p>have an influence in that country we might not have with a less high<br />
ranking person. The fact, though, that the appointment has raised<br />
objections in Australia, in particular quarters, in respect of some of the<br />
things the General has said in respect of the events in Dili some years<br />
ago, you know I think would be now well and truly reflected in<br />
Indonesia. But this matter is a matter for the Government of Indonesia<br />
to reflect upon.<br />
J: There have been some reports out of Jakarta that the Australian<br />
Government didn't put its disapproval forcefully enough, early enough.<br />
Is that the case?<br />
PM: Well I don't think it is a matter of the Government putting its<br />
disapproval. I mean we rejected the remarks which General Mantiri<br />
had made about Dili. What we have not done is rejected his<br />
appointment. This is a matter for the Government of Indonesia.<br />
Though now, of course, they will have recorded the dissension in<br />
Australia that such an appointment will meet and if there is to be any<br />
reflection on this it is for them to reflect upon.<br />
J: Is it going to make it very difficult then though if he does stay on?<br />
PM: Well again I mean he would be their representative, not ours. So it is<br />
for them.<br />
J: Is it your expectation though Prime Minister that the appointment will<br />
go forward?<br />
PM: At this stage, if you are asking me has Australia rejected the<br />
appointment. It hasn't and not at any stage. But I mean given the<br />
weight of coverage which it has had in Australia, there is no doubt that<br />
President Soeharto and the Government of Indonesia would have had<br />
that communicd t-d to them and if they are determined upon<br />
General Mantiri representing them, that is as it will be. But it is a<br />
matter for them.<br />
Could I just finish on one of the points I mentioned last night, this<br />
question of tariffs because it seems not a lot of it was reported. Just to<br />
say, again, to repeat what I said about John Howard. In an absence of<br />
policy statements, the one solid policy thing they have said is that they<br />
still believe, they are still hankering after the idea of Australia with a<br />
tariff wall around it. John Howard is saying I will give you the economy<br />
of the future with a tariff wall around it. Now I can only put this down to<br />
the fact that the influence of Mr Stannard in his office, leading the<br />
Australian Business Monthly charge against tariff reductions, putting<br />
this obscurantist view that if we put a barrier up we will be alright<br />
safely behind it. For the Opposition Leader to be dallying with these<br />
sort of policies in 1995, after we have been through the GATT and as<br />
we go through APEC is, I think, remarkable and it is remarkable only to<br />
reinforce the point, again, that John Howard is out of his age and out </p>
<p>of his depth. That he still believes he is a 70s politician with<br />
views, seeing the 1950s as the model and this is just as true here to<br />
have John Moore and someone on his staff speaking and developing<br />
policy in these terms, I think bodes very ill for the conservative side of<br />
politics and whatever commitments they ever had to economic<br />
rationality. And where we are talking about competition policy,<br />
I noticed Mr Moore saying we have got to advance micro-economic<br />
reform before we reduce tariffs. He doesn't seem to understand that<br />
the very reduction in tariffs induces competition in the economy which<br />
produces productivity and then brings on micro-economic change.<br />
He wants to put the cart before the horse and the horse before the cart<br />
is tariff reductions and competition in product markets which then lead<br />
to micro-economic change. I mean you know nothing could say more<br />
adequately, how inadequate the current Opposition is for Government<br />
than these expressions over the last couple of days.<br />
J: Some of your own backbenchers, though, of course are calling for a<br />
more aggressive stance on trade and industry. Is there anything in<br />
that?<br />
PM: Well I mean the Government has always sought to facilitate industrial<br />
change and we are doing it now with world best practice. We are<br />
looking at which ways we might be able to improve product innovation<br />
in Australia. But we are doing it in a sense in a generic way and I think<br />
this is where the debate has changed and it has changed in the<br />
Labor Party, I am happy to say, over the years away from particular<br />
sectors with particular plans. But here we are threading together a<br />
Pacific Rim trading arrangement through APEC with lower level of<br />
protections so we can get into markets around the region while the<br />
current Opposition in this country are saying " no, no, stop we want to<br />
go back, we want to go backwards".<br />
J: The Governor General you mentioned the new Governor-General<br />
would be a person who supported the changes of the past decade,<br />
presumably they would also be one who would be supporting the<br />
change to a republic?<br />
PM: Not presumably at all. I mean the Governor-General, whoever that<br />
person may be in the future, will be somebody who is the Vice Regal<br />
figure in this country. But still needing to understand what social and<br />
economic changes have taken place in Australia. I mean I think that<br />
just is simply a basic requirement for the job.<br />
ends </p>
