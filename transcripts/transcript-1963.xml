FOR PRESS: PM. No. 96, 1968<br />
OVERSEAS TAK( EOVERS OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMPANIES<br />
joint Press S3tatement by the Prime Minister and the-<br />
Treasurer<br />
The Government has given consideration to some of the<br />
problems raised as a consequence of attempts by overseas interests to take over<br />
control of Australian companies by market purchases of shaz ( perhaps<br />
in the name of nominees), " first-come first-served" offers for the purchase<br />
of shares, and other such measures designed to avoid the need for<br />
discussion with the company concerned.<br />
The general view strongly held by the Government is that<br />
the shareholders of an Australian company should have the right to amend<br />
the company's Articles of Association for the purpose of ensuring that<br />
control of the company, exercised through the voting power of the shareholders,<br />
remains in Australian hands.<br />
Under the present listing requirements of the Australian<br />
Associated Stock Exchanges, a company is not admitted to the Stock Exchange<br />
lists unless the company's Articles provide for equal voting rights for all<br />
shares of the one class.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Treasurer today discussed tole<br />
matter with Mr C. T. Looker, President of the Australian Associated<br />
Stock Exchanges and informed him of the Government's views. Mr Looker<br />
has undertaken to discuss with members of the Australian Associated Stock<br />
Exchanges an amendment of the provision mentioned.<br />
The provision in question relates only to the voting rights<br />
attaching to a company's shares. The Gvrmn's concern is with control<br />
of Australian companies and with the ability of shareholders of Australian<br />
companies to decide for themselves whether their Articles should contain<br />
provisions restricting the voting rights of shares acquired by overseas<br />
residents. The proposal discussed with Mr Looker will not, if adopted by<br />
the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges, operate to impose restrictions<br />
on overseas ownership of shares in Australian companies or in any way,<br />
inhibit the free transferability of such shares.<br />
