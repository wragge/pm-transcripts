L-h ilwl--ij AUSTHALIA, L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH PREPAnED FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, MRl HAWKE,<br />
AT THE INAUGURAL PRESENTATION OF AWARD FOR THE BEST DEPARTMENTAL<br />
ANNUAL REPORT<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION<br />
23 MAY 1983<br />
I AM SURE IT'S A GOOD OMEN THAT RELATIVELY EARLY<br />
IN THE LIFE OF MY GOVERNMENT, I SHOULD HAVE THE PLEASURE<br />
OF MAKING THE INAUGURAL PRESENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION'S AWARD FOR THE BEST<br />
ANNUAL REPORT PRODUCED BY A COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENT,<br />
IT IS A CONCEPT VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH MY<br />
GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO A WIDER AND FULLER SHARING OF<br />
INFORMATION WITH THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
NEVERTHELESS THERE'S A CERTAIN IRONY ABOUT THE<br />
FACT THAT DEPARTMENTAL ANNUAL REPORTS SHOULD BE DEEMED WORTHY<br />
OF A PRIZE IN 1983 MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS AFTER FEDERATION,<br />
IT IS ALMOST AS IF, TO QUOTE DR JOHNSON IN<br />
ANOTHER CONTEXT: " THE SURPRISING THING IS NOT THAT IT IS<br />
DONE WELL, BUT THAT IT IS DONE AT ALL." -QLLLYl-l\ l </p>
<p>IT IS REALLY OUITE ASTONISHING TO iEFLECT HOW<br />
RECENTLY THE PRODUCTION OF AI ANNUAL REPORT HAS BECOME<br />
THE NORMAL PRACTICE FOR MANY GOVERNtMENT DLPARTMENTS,<br />
IN 1976, LESS THAN TEN YEARS AGO, THE ROYAL COMMiISSION<br />
ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION FOUND IT NECESSARY<br />
TO EXTOL THE VIRTUES OF THE ' DEVELOPING PRACTICE' AMONG<br />
DEPARTM. ENTS OF FREPARING SUCH REPORTS,<br />
f'Y OWN DEPARTMENT'S FIRST ANNUAL REPORT WAS<br />
PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT IN 1979 A MIERE SEVENTY-THREE<br />
YEARS AFTER PRIME MINISTER DEAK! N REQUESTED IT,<br />
HOWEVER, THE PRACTICE NOW SEEMS TO BE FIRMLY<br />
ENTRENCHED, AND I WELCOME IT, BOTH AS A PRACTICAL APPLICATION<br />
OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES<br />
OF THE PEOPLE, AND AS AN AID TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS<br />
WHO WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE GOVERNED,<br />
IN TALKING OF ACCOUNTABILITY, IT MUST BE REMEMBERED<br />
THAT WHILE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE SERVICES TO AND HAVE DIRECT<br />
DEALINGS WITH THE PUBLIC, THEY ARE DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY<br />
ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR MINISTERS,<br />
BEFORE WE CAME INTO OFFICE, I THINK I MADE IT FAIRLY<br />
CLEAR HOW I EXPECTED ACCOUNTABILITY TO MINISTERS TO OPERATE,<br />
BUT I BELIEVE IT IS WORTH REINFORCING, PARTICULARLY IN THIS<br />
FORUM, WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID ON THIS POINT, s 1/ 3 </p>
<p>AS A OVER;; n. ENT, WE, L/: PECT LOYALTY FROi THE<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE IN PUTTING OUR POLICIES INTO EFFECT,<br />
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DO NOT SEEK<br />
HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT ADVICE IN DEVELOPING THOSE POLICIES.<br />
I SHOULD BE VERY DISTURBED TO THINK THAT ANY PUBLIC<br />
SERVANT WOULD HESITATE IN GIVING ME OR . Y MINISTERS A<br />
FRANK AND FORTHRIGHT OPINION ON A PROPOSAL,<br />
THE CONSTRUCTIVE AND CREATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS<br />
THAT WE WANT TO CULTIVATE WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE WOULD BE<br />
IRREPARABLY STUNTED WERE PUBLIC SERVANTS TO FEEL THE NEED<br />
TO TEMPER THEIR ADVICE BY ANY CONSIDERATION OF ITS<br />
UNPALATABILITY OR UNPOPULARITY.<br />
WE NO LONGER EXECUTE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS.<br />
BY THE SAME TOKEN IF ADVICE IS NOT ACCEPTED,<br />
MINISTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE POLICY THEY DECIDE<br />
ON WILL BE LOYALLY AND DILIGENTLY PURSUED BY THEIR DEPARTMENTS.<br />
THAT IS THE WHOLE BASIS OF AN INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL<br />
SERVICE. I UNDERSTAND THAT, IN MAKING ITS SELECTION FOR THIS<br />
AWARD, THE JUDGING PANEL WAS ASKED TO GIVE SPECIAL ATTENTION<br />
TO THE USE OF ANNUAL REPORTS AS A VEHICLE FOR MAKING AVAILABLE<br />
MATERIAL THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE MADE PUBLIC AS A<br />
MATTER OF COURSE, A,<br />

<p>I HOPE THIS ASPECT I I) PLAY AN IM'PORTANT PARF IN<br />
THEIR DELiBERATIONS, RECAUSE IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS INTEGRAL,<br />
TO THE GOVERNMENI I S COMMI TMENT TO A MORE OPEN AND kESPONS I BLE<br />
STYLE OF GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
ONE ASPECT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WDER COMMI TM. NT TO<br />
OPEN GOVERNMENT WAS ILLUSTRATED RECENTLY IN RELATION TO THE<br />
NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT,<br />
BEFORE AND DURING THE SUMMiIT, iNFORMATION WAS !., ADE<br />
FREELY AVAILABLE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC PROjECTIO. S AND ASSUMPTIONS<br />
ON WHICH DISCUSSION WAS TO BE FOCUSED.<br />
AT THE TIME OF THE MEETING, THE PROCEEDINGS ',' ERE<br />
WIDELY BROADCAST; AND THE RECORD OF THE WHOLE OF THE SUMMIT<br />
DELIBERATIONS IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE, IN PRINT AND ON TAPES,<br />
TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO BUY THEM OR TO BORROW THEM FROM<br />
A LIBRARY, MAY COLLEAGUES AND I WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE<br />
WAY THE PUBLIC SERVANTS WE WORKED WITH BEFORE AND DURING THE<br />
SUMMIT EMBRACED THE PRINCIPLES OF OPENNESS, KNOWLEDGE<br />
ACQUISITION AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING WE WISHED TO ESTABLISH,<br />
I HOPE THAT THEIR ENTHUSIASTIC AND EFFECTIVE<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR WISHES IN RESPECT OF COMMUNICATION ABOUT<br />
THE SUMMIT WILL FORESHADOW A NEW SPIRIT IN THE FLOW OF<br />
INFORMATION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT, THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
AND THE COMMUNITY,<br />

iNFOi. AT ION ABOUT LOVERiMEi; T OPLRATIONS ! S I'OT<br />
AFTER ALL., SOME KIND OF ' FAVOUR' TO BE BESTOWED BY A<br />
BENEVOLENT GOVERNMENT OR TO BE EXTORTED FROM A RELUCTANT<br />
BUREAUCRACY, IT IS., QUITE SIMPLY, A PUBLIC RIGHT,<br />
THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA HAVE A RIGHT TO INFORM<br />
THEMSELVES FULLY SUBJECT TO THE NORMAL PROTECTIONS<br />
ABOUT THE WAY THOSE THEY HAVE ELECTED TO GOVERN THEM<br />
DISCHARGE THAT RESPONSIBILITY,<br />
WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, ARE COMMITTED TO SEEING THAT<br />
THIS RIGHT IS RESPECTED; AND TO PROMOTING PROGRAMS AND<br />
ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HONOUR OUR OBLIGATIONS IN THIS RESPECT,<br />
BY ENCOURAGING STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE IN THE PRODUCTION<br />
OF ANNUAL REPORTS THE MIINIMUM STARTING POINT FOR A PUBLIC<br />
INFORMATION EFFORT BY ANY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS ECHOING THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST STANDARD IN THIS<br />
VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF ADMINISTRATION,<br />
I CONGRATULATE THE INSTITUTE ON ITS INITIATIVE IN<br />
INSTITUTING THIS AWARD, AND I CONGRATULATE THE WINNING<br />
DEPARTMENT ON ITS ACHIEVEMENT, </p>
