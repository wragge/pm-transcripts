Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced more than 900 new high quality apartments will be built in Darwin for single Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel in the next two years.</p>
<p>The announcement is part of a $4 billion contract to build 3,000 new apartments at 14 defence bases across Australia.</p>
<p>The Australian Labor Government is investing in the Northern Territory to provide the new, high quality accommodation for our defence personnel.</p>
<p>Northern Territory based company, Sitzler Pty Ltd, has been appointed to build more than 230 apartments at HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin and more than 680 apartments at Robertson Barracks in Palmerston.</p>
<p>This is a further step in fulfilling the Australian Government's 2010 election commitment to improve Defence housing.</p>
<p>It will also help further relieve pressure on the Darwin housing market. </p>
<p>This accommodation will be a great asset for our Defence bases and ultimately to our Defence Force.</p>
<p>The new housing will provide hundreds of Australian service men and women with a place to call home.</p>
<p>It will also provide a boost to the construction industry in the Northern Territory with many new employment job opportunities.</p>
<p>An additional 100 jobs, including sub contractors and permanent staff, will be provided through this project.</p>
<p>Construction starts on the 1st of September at Robertson Barracks and in November at Larrakeyah Barracks, with both projects to be completed in early 2013.</p>
<p>The new contract will see work commence on Phase 2 of Project Single Living Environment and Accommodation Precinct (Single LEAP). </p>
