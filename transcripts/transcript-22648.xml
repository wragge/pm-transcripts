    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Your reaction to Shane Warne's retirement Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thank him for the massive contribution he's made to Australian cricket.  He's the greatest slow bowler this country has had and the greatest slow bowler the world has seen and he's done amazing things for the art of leg break bowling and he's made a huge contribution to both maintaining and further stimulating interest in cricket in this and many other countries and I wish him well and I look forward to seeing him play in the next two Tests.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How would you describe his contribution to Australian cricket?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Massive, his record speaks for itself.  He'll clearly be the first person ever to take 700 Test wickets and the greatest single thing he did was after a long period of time when fast bowlers dominated the scene was to revive the ancient art of leg spin bowling and for those who love cricket that was an enormous contribution in itself.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's talk that Glenn McGrath may go as well. It would obviously be a big change for Australian cricket.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can't speculate about any of this. It's for the people concerned to talk about their own futures.  Glenn has made a huge contribution and he's a wonderful bowler and a wonderful man and I wish he and Jane and their children good things for Christmas.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be there to see Warnie's 700th wicket?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hope to go to some of the Test in Melbourne and my current intention is to see every day of the Sydney Test.  Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
