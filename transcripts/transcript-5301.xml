PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 19 MARCH, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY MIKE PETERSEN, CHANNEL 7,<br />
CANBERRA Question Prime minister, for the moment it seems we have averted another<br />
crisis. But how far is the Government prepared to go to see<br />
that Mr. Laidely and others like him survive in their business?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We are prepared to go a very long way indeed to see that small<br />
business, individuals, have economic freedom in this country.<br />
This is what it is all about. We have had a situation where under<br />
the auspices of the Commission,. and in a sense well, we<br />
condemned that as something that ought not to have happened<br />
but under the auspices of the Commission agreements were reached<br />
in which AMOCO said it was not going to supply petrol and<br />
the Transport Workers' Union certainly did not want Mr. Laidely<br />
to get supplies. If we are going to have a situation in Australia<br />
where large business and large and powerful trade unions can<br />
come to an agreement explicit or implicit that a certain<br />
person is not to be supplied products, it might be oil one day<br />
it might be groceries the next, then something very previous<br />
and important to Australia is lost. The Government is not<br />
prepared to see it lost.<br />
Question How far are you prepared to go in the event that another petrol<br />
strike happens?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We will uphold the law. We will support the law. We will<br />
strengthen the law, if it is necessary to support-the right of<br />
small businesses in this country. Nobody wants confrontation.<br />
We do not want confrontation. But it was people who were wanting<br />
to shut off Mr. Laidely's lifeline that led to confrontation<br />
in the first instance. Then a situation arose as a result of<br />
that where people must have said: " well, it's easier to<br />
sacrifice Mr. Laidely than to have an argument about a principle".<br />
So' far as the Government is concerned, we are prepared-to have<br />
an argument about that principle because it is about a principle<br />
that'is of fundamental importance to the kind of country this is.<br />
Let's take it another step. If you are going to say a trade<br />
union can say where Mr. Laidely can get his product, or whether<br />
he can get it, you would have a trade union saying to you what<br />
you can put on this television screen and what you must not put<br />
on this television screen. That would not be a power that you<br />
would accept very willingly. You would fight it I believe, very<br />
hard, and so you ought. But the Government is in the forefront<br />
of this battle and has to be. Because when you have large and<br />
powerful bureaucracies of different kinds a private one, the<br />
corporation, a * trade union which is another bureaucracy of<br />
a kind then, it is the Government that has the responsibility / 2 </p>
<p>PETERSEN2 Prime Minister ( continued.)<br />
to defend the interests of people, small businesses, that<br />
may not be able to stand without Government support.<br />
