    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Good morning Neil.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Have you spoken to Tony Abbott about this incident?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>I called Tony last night and left a message, we’ve texted.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure that he was okay and that the police were investigating the assault.</p>
<p>This is a disgraceful incident and I condemn this assault on Tony.</p>
<p>Any violence coming into our political life is absolutely to be condemned.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Are we, sorry –</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Yes, you go on.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Well, are we at the stage where we’ve got to look at extra protection for people at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Well, that’s a matter that the police will assess. I spoke to the Federal Police Commissioner last night to make sure that the police were on top of this and, of course, they are.</p>
<p>I know that the Commissioner was going to call Tony shortly after he spoke to me.</p>
<p>I understand that Tony has given a statement to the Tasmania Police and that they’re looking at the CCTV.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr Abbott sent me a message this morning, he thanked me for my message and he said: “Yes, I spoke to Tas Police last night and they’ll review the CCTV footage of the area to see what can be done”.</p>
<p>So it’s very important, as I said to him, that the assailant is identified and charged.</p>
<p>Look, we absolutely condemn this Neil, but I just want to say that we have a great tradition of engaging in political debate in Australia respectfully, sometimes with strong views expressed but without violence. That’s one of our great accomplishments.</p>
<p>Now there have been, this is one of a number, a relatively small number of incidents, but any one is one too many. I want to say that all of us should continue to focus on discussing this important issue of same sex marriage, making a decision and doing so with respect of each other’s views.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>It doesn’t, nor does, sort of, in what, one attack like this doesn’t undermine the whole ‘yes’ case surely, does it? It doesn’t demean everybody who has a certain view, ‘yes’ or ‘no’?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Of course it doesn’t. It doesn’t but one incident like this is one too many. It must be condemned and we don’t want to see any more of it.</p>
<p>But we do have to recognize that of course there are 24 million Australians, there are 16 million people have got survey forms and overwhelmingly the discussion is going on in a very civilized and respectful manner.</p>
<p>I was doing a ‘Politics in the Pub’ here in Caloundra in Queensland where I am now, last night. This issue came up and there were different views expressed. Everybody, the people who were for ‘yes’ listened to the case for ‘no’, and the people who for ‘no’ listened to the case for ‘yes’ and they did so respectfully.</p>
<p>That’s what all Australians should do.</p>
<p>So we should have zero tolerance for disrespectful conduct and absolutely zero tolerance for violence of this kind.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Is there a need for calm? It almost sounds as if you’re calling for some calm. I’ve got video of people on the streets, ‘no’ campaigners being abused and threatened by ‘yes’ supporters. This is coming up regularly, I’m afraid. It hasn’t erupted badly but it’s threatening to.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Neil, everyone should exercise calm and restraint.</p>
<p>People should recognise that they are not helping their case by engaging in violent language, abusive language, let alone physically violent conduct as we saw, as Tony suffered from last night.</p>
<p>They don’t help their case and they certainly are not showing respect for others.</p>
<p>I just say as I’ve said many times, if you want people to respect your point of view, you’ve got to be prepared to respect theirs. And our whole success as the most successful multicultural society in the world is built on a foundation of mutual respect and that is what we should continue to reinforce and defend and promote.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Has there been any breach of the laws that you’ve drawn up to keep this debate civilized?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Well, Tony has said that he was head-butted, that’s a common assault.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>That is straight up. That’s why I was keen to ensure that the police were involved as quickly as possible. He has now made a statement. He advised me they’re reviewing the CCTV. And I hope that person who assaulted him is identified and charged and brought before the Courts in the usual way.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Yeah but we’re getting a lot of abuse on the streets - not physical violence, abuse - that presumably is a breach of that law?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Well, assault is physical assault. Verbal abuse can be a breach of the law depending on the context Neil, but I just underline that respect is the key. Mutual respect.</p>
<p>Now part of the, one of the realities is as you know, is that the media will take an incident here and an incident there and give it enormous prominence and can create a misleading impression.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly Australians are engaged in this discussion with great respect. </p>
<p>And as I say in the Caloundra RSL last night where we had our ‘Politics in the Pub’ session, there were several hundred people there - we spoke mostly about energy I might say, overwhelmingly - but there were a few questions and answers on same-sex marriage. Different views were expressed and the proponents of each side listened respectfully to the views of the others and that is the Australian way and that is what we should maintain.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Prime Minister, I know you’re in a hurry. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Just a final point – is it legitimate for the businesses and the AFL and all the people like this to be campaigning as they are? Do you think? Are you comfortable with that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Well it is a matter for them. It is their choice. I mean, I’m not going to tell the AFL or any other organisation how to run their affairs. I mean they’re entitled express a point of view.</p>
<p>The AFL has always had a, and you would understand this better than me being in Melbourne, but the AFL has always had a very forward leaning approach on social issues, you know, whether it is multiculturalism, whether it is reconciliation, whether it is ensuring that we have the whole Dreamtime at the ‘G – all of the initiatives they have taken, they have been a very socially progressive organisation and they’ve taken a strong stand on the same-sex marriage issue for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Thanks for your time. You still confident the ‘yes’ vote will get up?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>I believe it will. Lucy and I will be voting ‘yes’. And we encourage others to do so, but as I said, absolutely respect the views of those who will be voting ‘no’.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL: </strong>Thank you for your time. </p>
