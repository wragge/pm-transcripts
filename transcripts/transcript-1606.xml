Spivak: This is Lawrence Spivak inviting you to Meet the Press. Our guest today<br />
on Meet the Press is the Prime Minister of Australia, Harold E. Holt. The<br />
Prime Minister recently completed a state tour through Singapore, Thailand,<br />
Cambodia and Taiwan. He came to the United States to confer with President<br />
Johnson. ' le will have the first questions now from James Robinson of NBC News.<br />
Robinson: Mr. Prime Minister, Australia has frequently voiced concern about a<br />
power vacuum being created east of the Suez, but more specifically Southeast<br />
Asia, by the coming withdrawal of British military in that area. While here in<br />
the United States have you sought or received assurances from this Government<br />
that the US would move into that void?<br />
PM: You mentioned the coming withdrawal. I think we need to correct that<br />
premise. The United Kingdom Government has taken no firm decision on this.<br />
Indeed, I have been assured by Prime Minister V,' ilson that no final decision<br />
will be taken at least until we have had a chance of talking this over together.<br />
But the United States has, as you know, commitments all aound the arc of Asia<br />
and the Pacific running from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, South Vietnam, Thailand, and<br />
there is this one area of Malaysia in Singapore which it has regarded, quite<br />
properly, as a Commonwealth and primarily a British interest. And British<br />
intentions east of Suez therefore are of concern to the United States as indeed<br />
they are to my country.<br />
Robinson: Do they view the same concern that your country does, specifically, if the<br />
British, which they have indicated time and time again because of monetary<br />
commitments, they would have to perhaps withdraw their forces from Malaysia<br />
and cut down the forces, which they have already done in Hong Kong?<br />
PM: what is certain is that the United Kingdom intends to reduce<br />
substantially its forces in that region. It has taken no final decisions as to<br />
complete withdrawal. And we do take the view, in your country and mine, that<br />
a British presence in the area is desirable not merely for military reasons,<br />
it is a moderating, stabilizing influence in the area. The countries there want<br />
them to stay, and we hope that they will continue to stay.<br />
Robinson: Does your Government have the military wherewithal now to bolster<br />
its forces further in the Southeast Asian area?<br />
PM: Well, we are a small country, as you know, in terms of population about<br />
one-seventeenth the size of yours. v: e are currently devoting 5 per cent of our<br />
gross national product to defense expenditures, and we have a force in this<br />
2/ </p>
<p>area with the British forces; and we have some thousands of troops with yours<br />
in Vietnamn. -t e are currently building up the strength of our forces, and we<br />
do review from time to time what we are capable of doing in this area.<br />
Robinson: Mr. Prime Minister, you have already increased your forces, or<br />
recently increased your forces up to 6, 000 in Vietnam. If that war steps up<br />
in intensity would you also share a greater proportion of the burden of fighting?<br />
P. M: ' V,-ell, I repeat, we do review from time to time, usually at the time when<br />
we are framngo the budget, when we decide just what wie can afford to spend on<br />
defence in a year, the extent of our contribution in these various areas. V. e:<br />
have other commitments, of course. We have the defence of Papua and New<br />
Guinea to concern ourselves with, and we are making, I repeat, this<br />
contribution in Malaysia and the 65ingapore area. But we have representatives<br />
from the three Services engaged in Vietnam. The only country other than the<br />
United States to do so. And we pay our way with our own troops, unlike some<br />
of the other friendly forces participating there.<br />
Spivak: Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. We will be back with Meet the Press<br />
and more questions for our guest, the Prime Minister of Australia, but first<br />
this message.<br />
Announcer: Now back to Meet the Press. Please remember questions of the panel<br />
members do not necessarily reflect their own point of view. Here is our<br />
moderator, Lawrence Spivak.<br />
Spivak: Resuming our interview, our guest today on Meet the Press is the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, Harold E. Holt. We will continue the questions now<br />
with Mr. Shipley.<br />
Shipley: Mr. Prime Minister, with your troops fighting in South Vietnam you are<br />
rather identified with American policy in that area. How has this affected your<br />
relations with your other Asian neighbors with whom you have just visited?<br />
PIM: I found a warm friendliness for Australia wherever we went, and this<br />
applied both in Cambodia and Laos which officially are neutral countries, and<br />
indeed, Cambodia tends to look in the direction of the Socialist camp, as you<br />
know. Of course in Taiwan and Korea, Australia was welcomed no less<br />
warmly, indeed possibly even more so because we were the first to join you<br />
in resisting aggression in Korea with the Koreans themselves, and we have<br />
had good relations with Taiwan, with whom we recently established an Embassy.<br />
Shipley: You iniust have had a few scratchy moments with Prince Sihanouk. 1Viould<br />
you mind telling us about your exchange of views with him?<br />
PM'. 1 W! ell, I have a very good exchange of views with Prince Sihanouk, and I<br />
feel that I have learned to understand more deeply and clearly the motives<br />
which direct his country's policy. He has taken over as leader a country<br />
wihich over the centuries has been subject to harassment by its neighbours;<br />
he is trying to preserve a culture and tradition; and he does not believe in<br />
foreign intervention in any country, least of all his own.<br />
Shipley: You must have asked him then about the use of his country, and<br />
particularly Prince Sihanouk trail, to bringing forces down from North<br />
Vietnam into South Vietnam. ' W. hat did he have to say about that?<br />
PIM: Yes, we discussed that. He acknowledged that people were driven across<br />
the border occasionally. He did not wiant them there: he did not encourage<br />
them to stay there. He tended to discount the use of the Sihanouk trail. I<br />
think from my subsequent inquiries rather more so than the facts as we know<br />
3/ </p>
<p>them were justified. But everybody that I have talked to about this admits that<br />
it is a very difficult trail for his limited forces to police, and perhaps he<br />
feels why should he have his own people come under attack when it is not his<br />
problem, as he sees it.<br />
Moyers: Mr. Prime Minister, a top general in Hanoi recently indicated that if<br />
we reached the state of negotiations the fighting is likely to be continued<br />
simultaneously with the negotiations themselves. Do you see this as a real<br />
possibility and what do we do if that happens?<br />
PM: I think it is very difficult to predict what we do in the circumstances<br />
which cannot be clearly foreseen at this point of time. I have always believed<br />
myself that a military victory would be incomplete: we would have to have a<br />
political settlement.<br />
Moyers: VWhat do you think the terms of such a political settlement might be?<br />
PIM: V/ 7eli, terms that would be acceptable to the powers which met at Manila<br />
would include the right of South Vietnam to resolve its own affairs,, decide on<br />
the form of Government it wanted, and to be free from aggression, terrorism<br />
and infiltration from the North.<br />
Moyers: Do you see the eventual reconciliation of North and South Vietnam<br />
through elections?<br />
PM:-I think that is something which would be very far ahead for both of them:<br />
But the South Vietnamese themselves acknowledge that at some point of time<br />
an opportunity should exist for the people of the two areas to decide whether<br />
they did want a unification.<br />
Fry e: Mr. Prime Minister, how much do you think the Soviet Union has gained<br />
by its backing of the Arabs in the Middle Eiast?<br />
PM I do not know that anybody has gained very much out of this very tragic<br />
situation. And I think we can take some encouragement from the way in which<br />
the Soviet Union has really, as I have interpreted events, tried to avoid<br />
enlarging the dangers, and indeed, has been prepared to work with other great<br />
powers in limiting their consequences.<br />
Frye: How extensively is it willing to work for a genuine peace? Do you see<br />
anything of the nature of a mideast Tashkent emerging?<br />
PM: I am not clear about that. But I do think the recent history of the Soviet<br />
has shown a disposition to live more cooperatively with the free world as we<br />
would describe it with trade and other matters of international conse* quence.<br />
Frye: Well, let me turn just for auiinute then to the UN role in that area. The<br />
UN, the removal of the UN's Peace Army has been criticized on the ground<br />
that it is like taking down an umbrella the moment it starts to rain. On the<br />
other hand, of course, to have kept it there would have been to override<br />
Egypt's sovereignty. Do you think it is desirable or possible for the US to<br />
develop in practice the power to impose the will of the world community on<br />
a nation state?<br />
P. M: If the major powers are prepared to give full backing to the United Nations,<br />
and this has been the great disadvantage in these matters over recent years,<br />
it has been hard to get unanimity amongst the major powers, then there is<br />
a real prospect, I believe. And it would also depend to some degree on how<br />
far the great powers are prepared to assist economically and from the defence<br />
point of view in sustaining such a settlement. e 4/ </p>
<p>Spivak: Mr. Prime Minister, a great many Americans believe that the war in<br />
Vietnam is going to be a long one. From your vantage point closer to the<br />
area will you give us your estimate of how long you think the war will last?<br />
PM: VJell, in Malaysia, where we had a somewhat similar consideration, but<br />
a very much less complex situation, and fewer people involved, it took us the<br />
better part of fifteen years. By us, the British and other Commonwealth<br />
forces. I do not foresee anything of that length of time in South Vietnam. But<br />
until the North Vietnamese are convinced themselves that there is not that<br />
much to be gained from persisting, then the fighting will continue. I, being an<br />
optimist by temperament, think there is a possibility, just as there has been<br />
in other postwar situations of the Communists moving quickly once they<br />
decide the game is not worth the candle.<br />
Spivak: Well, do you think the war can be shortened if we continue the bombing,<br />
or that it is more likely tobe shortened if we stop the bombing?<br />
PM: I am strongly in support of the continuance of the bombing. I refuse to<br />
believe that the bombing is not having an important effect. I do not feel that<br />
a country which is mounting aggression, which is supplying its own forces from<br />
its national territory, should be immune from attack. I regard as unrealistic<br />
the argument that there would be negotiation if the bombing would only cease.<br />
were told earlier there would be a negotiation if the Americans withdrew<br />
their troops from the area. And a country that is looking for negotiations, it<br />
can find through the various diplomatic channels ways of achieving this. I do<br />
not myself believe that the North Vietnamese are yet in a mood for negotiation.<br />
Robinson: Mr. Prime Minister, moving from Vietnam back to the more peaceful<br />
land of Australia, your country by geography is Asian. By race it is white.<br />
And you continue a pure white immigration policy, excluding Asians, your<br />
neighbours, from immigrating into Australia. VWill that not boomerang<br />
against your country?<br />
PM: Again your premise needs qualification. You would probably be surprised<br />
to know that there are 12, 000 Asian students in our schools and universities;<br />
That some 30, 000 people have been admitted since the war who would not have<br />
been eligible under the regulations which applied before the war; that some<br />
thousands of people of Asian origin have taken out full naturalization in<br />
Australia. No, we have liberalized the arrangements quite a good deal. And<br />
the governments of the area recognize the value for them or secure, stable<br />
and relatively homogeneous Australia.<br />
Robinson: Well, I have met many Southeast Asians in my long tenure in Southeast<br />
Asia who had a lot of antagonisms against your country, and more specifically<br />
against your government, and even more specifically against that on your<br />
racial immigration laws. Are you sayin4 that you are going to moderate those<br />
even more and more as time goes on?<br />
PM: I have said we have moderated them, and time and circumstance our<br />
circumstances include a rapidly growing trade with Asia compared with the<br />
1950' s when 15 per cent of our export trade was east of Suez, it is 43 per cent<br />
today. Japan has become the biggest customer in the world for Australian<br />
goods. These things have a bearing on all this. But: might I emphasise that<br />
not one representative of an Asian government has ever raised with me in my<br />
many travels around the area the question of our immigration policy.<br />
Shipley: Mr. Prime Minister, when our President was recently a visitor in your<br />
country there was a certain amount of paint splashing and running about the<br />
streets. 1What has been the political effect in Australia of your support of the<br />
American policy in Vietnam? </p>
<p>Pi%: 7 ! ell, you know your paint splashing reference, it was a very isolated<br />
reference. The President had the most marvellous reception in my country<br />
that any visiting dignitary has ever received. And I know he was greatly<br />
heartened by it. V-.-ie fought the last election on the issue of Vietnam and the<br />
participation there for the first time in our history of draftees called into the<br />
Services. And wie had a record majority victory, despite this as a central<br />
issue. Most Australians have accepted this verdict, and I would say there has<br />
been a considerable abatement of any active public demronstration or protest<br />
against the policy.<br />
' Nhpley: W1". ould you say that Australia goes all the way with LBJ then?<br />
PM!, In relation to Vietnam I have said I go all the way with LBJ, and most<br />
Australians are going all the way with me on these issues.<br />
Moyers: You have been to Southeast Asia three times, Mr. Prime Minister, in the<br />
last 14 months. Have you noticed any changes, particularly in regard to<br />
economic and political development between trips?<br />
PMA: When I was here the last time you may remember I said that one of th-e<br />
great dividends which had already been secured from American participation<br />
in Vietnam was the growing economic, social and political strength of the<br />
countries sheltered by the American shield. My recent visit confirmed this<br />
more strongly for me, particularly in Taiwan and in Korea, where both countries<br />
have. the greater growth for their national product which ranks among the<br />
highest wie found anywhere in the vworld.<br />
Moyers: What is Australia's specific stake in South Vietnam, Mr. Prime Minister?<br />
Do you feel threatened by the North Vietnamese, or behind them, the Chinese7i<br />
PIM: 747ell, what was Australia's stake in its participation in ' W-orld W~ ar I and<br />
' ivo rld War 11? Australians believe that countries should be able to live free from<br />
aggression. ie were first by you, I repeat, in Korea; we were early with you<br />
in Vietnam, helping to resist the aggressor and preserve the independence of<br />
a small country. Now that is the kind of world in which we want to live. But<br />
apart from that, we believe that if this threat of aggression can be removed from~<br />
the countries of the area that they will progress, they will throw off these<br />
historic shackles of the past the evidence in Japan, in Korea and Taiwan and<br />
Thailand, and others in the area, Malaysia, these countries are all showing what<br />
can be done once this threat has been removed from them.<br />
Frye; There is a theory that if the United States had failed to stand firm in<br />
Vietnam, the attempt at a coup in Indonesia might have succeeded. Do you know<br />
of any intelligence information to support this theory?<br />
PMk: No, but I support the viewi myself. I have little doubt in my mind that had<br />
Amnerica not intervened in South Vietnam, just had it not intervened in Korea, we<br />
t would not have even had a struggle in South Vietnam. That we would not have<br />
produced in Indonesia the strength of'the support for the generals against those<br />
who instituted the coup, and against the Communist Party whicci led to the<br />
overthrow of the Communist Party.<br />
Frye: The policies of Sihanouk and Sukarno have some considerable similarity.<br />
Sihanouk, too, has tried to appease the Communists. Has hLe had rude awakening<br />
as a result of this most recent Communist guerilla activity in his owin country?<br />
PM: -) ell, I think there is a similarity in that both of them have tried to revive<br />
a sense of national identity, a lively consciousness of belonging to a particular<br />
country. But Sukcarno is a revolutionary of a rather turbulent and dramatic order.<br />
9 6/ </p>
<p>I would not put Sihanouk in that category. He is a man who has far more<br />
concern for economic development and the progress of his country than<br />
Sukarno ever had. He is troubled currently by some Communist activity<br />
there, but I think this is significant because he had tried to live in friendship<br />
with them.<br />
Frye: Is it an incipient Vietnam?<br />
PM: No, I would not say that. It is on a much smaller scale, and he has<br />
got it very much under control.<br />
Spivak: Mr. Prime Minister, our allies in E~ urope have given us virtually no<br />
support, certainly very liene support in Vietnam. From what you said a<br />
minute ago in answer to another question, do you believe that Vietnam should<br />
be considered or must be considered a European as well as an Asian problem?<br />
PM: I think it is an important interest for E~ urope, and the fact that the<br />
Secretary General of the United Nations felt moved recently to say that this<br />
could lead to a third world war surely makes of vital interest for the western<br />
countries. I think it a great misfortune that so few leading figures from the<br />
west and this goes for the United Kin rdom as well have not been in the area.<br />
They have not sensed, as your President has, or many of your senior American<br />
citizens who visited the place, what the potentialities are, what the movement<br />
is, the excitement of growth and development occurring there. If they did I<br />
think they would be more sympathetically disposed.<br />
Robinson: Mr. Prime Minister, as you said, you have just recently set up an<br />
Embassy in Taiwan. Could you explain to us that Australia has been one of<br />
the leading countries shipping grains to Communist China, which has sustained<br />
that regime in many instances in power?<br />
PM: Oh, I would not put it as high as that. China can get wheat from many<br />
wheat-exporting countries. We think that the sales of our wheat to China mean<br />
more to our economy and the contribution we can make than, relatively speaking,<br />
it does to China. But that is putting the more materialistic view of things. I<br />
have said publicly in this country quite strongly that there must be eventually<br />
an accommodation with China: it is unrealistic to view the future otherwise.<br />
And if we are to establish some point of contact, some bridges of cooperation,<br />
some friendship, nothing is more effective than trade. You can have cultural<br />
exchanges, sporting exchanges, visits by journalists and others, but trade<br />
provides better than anything else a mutuality of interests. And I think it<br />
would be encouraged.<br />
Spivak: Gentlemen, we have less than three minutes.<br />
Shipley: Mr. Prime Minister, you said in response to Mr. Spivak's question that<br />
you thought the war in Vietnam might begin to come to an end when Mr.<br />
Ho Chi Minh thought the candle was not worth the game. What sort of<br />
influences are likely to persuade him to that conclusion?<br />
PM: Wiell, I myself attach a good deal of importance to the sustained bombing<br />
which has been particularly effective over the last couple of months. The<br />
military pressures, also I think are having a cumulative effect: the number of<br />
defectors is increasing. The very degree of the terrorist campaign against<br />
the cadres in the villages, the revolutionary development cadres which the<br />
South Vietnamese people have set going there, this shows that the Communists<br />
are feeling the pressures from this. Amd these things tend to be cumulative.<br />
If there are shortages of food and necessities of life, I cannot be told that<br />
morale is not eventually affected by these things. 6/ </p>
<p>Moyers: On the subject of Mainland China, Mr. Prime inister, do. you believe<br />
the time has come to admit the Communist Chinese into the United Nations?<br />
P. M: No, we do not, until Communist China has given evidence of a<br />
willingness to adopt the rules of the game in the United Nations, and until<br />
we have worked out a satisfactory arrangement in respect of Taiwan, no<br />
settlement with mainland China would be acceptable to us which did not also<br />
take care of the people of Taiwan. Wie supported the United States and Other<br />
countries which concluded at the most recent discussion of this that the time<br />
was certainly not right for their admission.<br />
Frye: -V* hat do you think are China's intentions in Hong Kong?<br />
PM: I do not believe that they want to press this to a point which threatens<br />
the security and stability of Hong Kong. Hong Kong is too valuable an outlet<br />
for Chinese trade, Chinese commerce. It means a great deal in foreign<br />
exchange to the Chinese, who are short of this. No, they might cause some<br />
mischief, but I do not think theywill press it to real trouble.<br />
Spivak: We have thirty seconds for an answer and a question.<br />
Robinson: Mr. Prime Minister, do you see any reason for continuing the Southeast<br />
Asia Treaty Organization?<br />
PIM: Yes, I do, even if some members have not been as wholehearted in<br />
their support: there are others who are very much concerned with cooperating<br />
together in the area to resist Communist expansion and they should be<br />
encouraged to continue this.<br />
Spivak: I am sorry to interrupt, but our time is up.<br />
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for being with us today on Meet<br />
the Press. </p>
