CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNITED NATION'S FUNDS FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G. Whitlam, today announced<br />
that Australia will contribute $ 10,000 to the United Nations Educational<br />
and Training Programme for Southern Africa, and $ 5,000 each to the United<br />
Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the United Nations Fund for Namibia.<br />
Mr Whitlam said this was the first time Australia had contributed<br />
to these Funds, which were established to assist the educational development<br />
and other aspirations of the people of Southern Africa.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he had long felt that Australia should assist the<br />
people of Southern Africa by taking an active role in United Nations activities<br />
undertaken on their behalf and by making financial contributions to the Funds<br />
established for this purpose.<br />
Mr Thitlam. said that Australia would be one of the first countries<br />
to make a contribution to the United Nations Fund for Namibia, which was<br />
established in December 1970. This Fund was established to support a<br />
programme designed to help Namibians prepare for independence.<br />
The United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa was established in<br />
December 1965. Grants made by the Fund are used to provide legal assistance<br />
to persons prosecuted under the discriminatory legislation of South Africa,<br />
relief and education to such persons and their dependents and relief for<br />
refugees from South Africa. The United Nations Educational and Training<br />
Programme for Southern Africa was established in December 1967. </p>
