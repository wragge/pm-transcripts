<p>Our Party went to the last election with a plan to build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia.</p>
<p>Today, my job is to report to you on our progress and to set out our next steps in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Our plan means backing hard working Australians to get ahead and to fulfil their dreams.</p>
<p>Our plan is not about us; itâs about you.</p>
<p>Itâs about you having more control over your pay packet, more control over your bills and more choice over child care, health care and planning for your own retirement.</p>
<p>Itâs about keeping you safe: because thatâs more important than anything.</p>
<p>From âMenziesâ forgotten peopleâ, to the âHoward battlersâ and âTonyâs tradiesâ â we have always been the party that âturned on the lightsâ; that stood âfor all of usâ; and that seeks âhope, reward and opportunityâ for everyone.</p>
<p>Today, I can report to you that our plan is working.</p>
<p>Our plan to grow the economy with lower tax, less red tape, more trade, better infrastructure and stronger borders is working.</p>
<p>Since you elected this government, almost 290,000 new jobs have been created.</p>
<p>Economic growth is now stronger than in most developed nations â and stronger than during the last year of the Rudd Gillard Government.</p>
<p>Company registrations are at record highs because people are ready to have a go when they know that government is on their side.</p>
<p>Export volumes are up, as is residential housing construction and retail sales.</p>
<p>And business confidence continues to strengthen.</p>
<p>Our economy and our country are stronger â despite economic headwinds from the end of the mining investment boom and the low iron ore price.</p>
<p>People might have been a little bit uncertain about us; they always are about new governments â but now they know that we are serious: that our country really is under new management and that Australia really is open for business.</p>
<p>The carbon tax is gone â and everyone is benefiting from lower power prices.</p>
<p>The mining tax is gone â and Australia is once again seen as a good place to invest.</p>
<p>New projects worth over a trillion dollars have received environmental approval â and there is no longer a green veto on development.</p>
<p>50,000 pages of regulation have been scrapped â saving businesses and individuals over $2 billion a year â with much more to come in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Free Trade Agreements with China, Japan and Korea are already creating opportunities for tens of thousands of Australian businesses â and new markets mean new jobs.</p>
<p>Projected long-term debt and deficits have been halved because of the difficult, but necessary decisions we made in Joe Hockeyâs first Budget.</p>
<p>The largest Commonwealth-funded infrastructure programme in Australian history is now underway.Â </p>
<p>We are delivering WestConnex, the Pacific Highway duplication, the Bruce Highway upgrade, the North-South spine in Adelaide, the Midland Highway in Tasmania and major roads throughout Western Australia.</p>
<p>Here in Victoria, there is $3 billion in a locked box waiting for a state government that wants to build the East West Link.</p>
<p>The NBN has passed one million premises and Malcolm Turnbull is turning, another Labor disaster into an asset for Australia.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Budget is finally on a credible path back to surplus â with the deficit projected to fall by half a per cent of GDP every year.Â </p>
<p>Already, we have made over $50 billion in savings to help repair the Budget â and the last sitting fortnight has been the most productive since the election.</p>
<p>The parliament has passed legislation to make the age pension more sustainable â with more assistance to 170,000 pensioners with modest assets.</p>
<p>The parliament has passed the instant asset write-off for small business.</p>
<p>The parliament has passed changes to renewable energy to make power more affordable and investment more secure.</p>
<p>The parliament has passed changes to fuel excise and the parliament has passed changes to the PBS.</p>
<p>Weâre making the hard decisions so we can make the necessary investments in our countryâs future.</p>
<p>For the first time, Northern Australia has a plan for its economic development â including for new dams â because we can't make the most of Australia unless we make the most of our Great North.Â </p>
<p>We arenât just improving Australiaâs economic security â we are improving our national security as well because a nationâs economic security and its national security go hand in hand.Â </p>
<p>This government has steadfastly met the challenges of the past 22 months.</p>
<p>Weâve been resolute, determined and have kept the faith.</p>
<p>Weâve stopped the boats â a task that Labor said couldnât be done â and secured our borders for the first time since the Howard Government.Â </p>
<p>When 39 Australians were shot out of the sky over Ukraine, our police and armed forces brought our dead home from a war zone.Â </p>
<p>Our people were superb â and I couldnât be more proud.Â </p>
<p>Today, I single out one â my deputy and Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop who criss-crossed the world in the name of justice.</p>
<p>Overnight, we saw again horrors in France, Tunisia and Kuwait.</p>
<p>We are meeting the challenge of the Daesh death cult and the Australians it brainwashes.Â </p>
<p>Abroad, Australian armed forces are working with a worldwide coalition against a group as evil as any in human history.</p>
<p>At home, we have provided more resources and more powers to our security and intelligence agencies â because they need whatever it takes to keep you safe.</p>
<p>This week, we sent a clear message to those Australians who think they can fight overseas with impunity.Â <br />
Think again.</p>
<p>We will strip Australian citizenship from terrorists who are dual nationals â because terrorists shouldnât be walking our streets looking to make our citizens their trophies</p>
<p>Our country is confronting the evil of terrorism â and we are also facing up to the evil of domestic violence.Â <br />
If there is any place that should be a safe haven â itâs the family home.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for domestic violence.Â </p>
<p>Former Police Commissioner Ken Lay, and Rosie Batty, are heading up our advisory panel and youâll soon hear more about how weâll tackle this national scourge.</p>
<p>Letâs start by making domestic violence orders national, so violent men canât chase their families across the country.</p>
<p>And letâs expect the perpetrators â and not the victims â to be the ones to leave home.Â Â </p>
<p>Ken Lay is also helping us to beat the scourge of ice â the most dangerous drug of addiction yet seen.<br />
No one should be lost in a world of fear and fantasy in the best country on earth.</p>
<p>In just a few daysâ time, Australia will have completed 24 consecutive years of economic growth â only the Netherlands has had a longer run of economic growth.</p>
<p>But we cannot be a country that lives off yesterdayâs achievements; we canât take growth for granted.</p>
<p>The foundation of the next quarter century of prosperity wonât be bigger government, higher taxes or more debt and deficits.</p>
<p>It will be unleashing the entrepreneurs of our country, particularly our small businesses to have a go.</p>
<p>Since the days of the early settlers, through the gold rushes, the wars and successive waves of immigration, Australians have always been willing to work hard, lend a hand to neighbours, make sacrifices for children and look over the horizon to a better future.Â </p>
<p>Thatâs the Australian way and theyâre the Australians that we want to back.</p>
<p>Every day we are making further progress.</p>
<p>We are working to re-establish a tough cop on the beat in the construction industry to deliver billions of dollars in productivity benefits.</p>
<p>Weâll soon release the Agriculture White Paper and â again â thereâll be more money for dams because you canât grow things without water.</p>
<p>Weâll soon respond to the Harper Competition Review and the Murray Review into the Financial System â because we want all parts of our economy growing strongly.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, weâll release Australiaâs first ever 15 year plan for infrastructure to get more bulldozers on the ground and cranes in the sky.</p>
<p>Work is underway eliminating thousands of mobile phone black spots in regional areas.</p>
<p>Thousands of young people have already been in the Green Army in hundreds of projects to clean up our lands and waterways â and thereâll be tens of thousands more.</p>
<p>We want to support hard working Australians â especially parents who want work or who want more work.</p>
<p>Our Budget childcare measures should encourage more than 240,000 families to earn more, including almost 38,000 jobless families.Â </p>
<p>Low and middle income families using childcare will be $1,500 a year better off even before they earn more.<br />
I have said what we will do â let me also tell you what we wonât do.</p>
<p>We wonât increase taxes on superannuation or increase the restrictions on superannuation because your retirement savings belong to you and not the government.</p>
<p>We wonât change the rules on negative gearing because Australians have made decisions based on the rules as they stand â and the last time a government fiddled with negative gearing it caused a crisis in the rental market.</p>
<p>And we wonât be putting a tax on electricity because there are smarter ways of reducing emissions than whacking everyone with a new carbon tax.<br />
For over seventy years, the Liberal Party has built modern Australia â not on ideology, but on backing hard working Australians â people prepared to have a go.</p>
<p>If youâre a young Australian looking for a good job and working for a deposit on your first home â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If youâre a small business person who wants to employ people â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If youâre a young parent trying to balance work and family â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If youâre a migrant who came the right way to build a better life for your children â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If you want to spend less time stuck in traffic to get to work or to pick up your kids â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If youâre working more to get ahead and to provide the best opportunities for your children â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If you believe superannuation is your money and want certainty in retirement â weâre for you.</p>
<p>If youâre on the land despite the ravages of drought â weâre for you.</p>
<p>I should ask: whoâs Labor for these days?</p>
<p>I guess the âKilling Seasonâ answered that: theyâre for themselves.</p>
<p>Theyâre the party that promised to be like John Howard, but werenât.</p>
<p>Theyâre the party that promised us they wouldnât restart the boats, but did.</p>
<p>Theyâre the party that promised surpluses, but delivered record debt and deficits.</p>
<p>Theyâre the party that said no carbon tax, but gave us one anyway.</p>
<p>The guilty party has not changed.</p>
<p>Almost two years into this term, they still want a carbon tax; they still have no policies to stop the boats and theyâre still addicted to taxes and spending.</p>
<p>The choice is clear.</p>
<p>Theyâre for boats, weâre for none.</p>
<p>Theyâre for a carbon tax, weâre for lower tax.</p>
<p>Theyâre for taxes, weâre for jobs.</p>
<p>They do union bidding.</p>
<p>We stand for all of us.</p>
<p>Now I have to confess, I did sneak a peak at that ABC series The Killing Season.Â </p>
<p>The one thing that Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard could agree on was: you canât trust Bill Shorten.</p>
<p>If Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd donât trust Bill Shorten, why should you?</p>
<p>If the workers of the AWU couldnât trust Bill Shorten, why should you?</p>
<p>Only the Liberal party and our National Party colleagues can be trusted to build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia.</p>
<p>Itâs built by people who believe in our country and who believe that our best days are ahead of us.</p>
<p>When the history books are written, they will recognise my friend, and our Deputy Prime Minister, Warren<br />
Truss as one of the great leaders of this government.</p>
<p>I can report to you that our Coalition is strong. I can report to you that our party organisation, so well led by President Richard Alston is strong.</p>
<p>Our secretariat, led by Brian Loughnane and supported by our state directors, is the most professional political organisation in the country.</p>
<p>But our greatest strength is not our leadership, itâs our membership.</p>
<p>Our party has been built by hundreds of thousands of men and women from all walks of life, from every nook and cranny under the Southern Cross.</p>
<p>We believe in family, in community and that our nationâs greatest achievements come when our people are encouraged to have a go.</p>
<p>We reflect the length and breadth of Australian life: young and old, rich and poor, farmer and suburbanite, indigenous and immigrant, tradies and nurses.</p>
<p>Our party does not demand blind obedience.Â  We respect differences â because discussing them is how we come closer to wisdom.</p>
<p>We are a party that honours our history â itâs the foundation we build on.Â  Itâs why we are proud to be the heirs of Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon, Fraser and Howard.Â </p>
<p>In honouring our history, we remember the good government that Malcolm Fraser led.Â </p>
<p>He turned on the lights and weâre grateful.</p>
<p>But, today weâre focused on the future.</p>
<p>Weâre making our country safer and more prosperous for everyone.</p>
<p>Weâre the optimists of Australian life.</p>
<p>Weâre yearning and striving to build a better Australia, leaving our children more than we ever hoped for.</p>
<p>Thatâs our task; thatâs our mission and, for our countryâs sake, we will succeed.</p>
