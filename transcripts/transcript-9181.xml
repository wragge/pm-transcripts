TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ORIENTAL HOTEL, BANGKOK, THURSDAY, 7 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J* Prime Minister, are you pleased to have been given the Order of the<br />
White Elephant?<br />
PM: Well I think it is a tribute to Australia that the King of Thailand should<br />
have bestowed upon the Prime Minister of Australia an order which is<br />
their highest civilian order.<br />
J: What does it mean to you personally?<br />
PM: I take it as a compliment that His Majesty the King of Thailand and the<br />
Thai Government regard those things which I'm undertaking here as<br />
being of significance and of sufficient importance to warrant such an<br />
award.<br />
J: Did the King talk at all about the bridge and the significance of<br />
tomorrow?<br />
PM: The King was very taken with the bridge, saying that he regards it as<br />
an historic occasion; that it will be his first visit from the country in a<br />
quarter of a century. His first visit ever to Laos, and the bridge is of<br />
course the occasion for it happening. He said, to use his own<br />
expression, it was a very historic occasion.<br />
ends. </p>
