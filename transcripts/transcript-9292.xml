PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUTOMOTIVE, FOOD, METALS AND ENGINEERING UNION CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY, 27 JULY 1994<br />
Let me begin by saying how good it is to be with the members of one of<br />
Australia's great unions, the AFMEU.<br />
As a Labor Prime Minister, I very much welcome this opportunity to speak with<br />
you today for yours is a union that has led the way in workplace reform.<br />
You have played a vital role in preparing the Australian workforce for a new<br />
century.<br />
You were the first union to put in place skills-based career structures.<br />
You were at the forefront in implementing occupational superannuation.<br />
You were at the forefront of restructuring unions.<br />
I understand that you will soon be making another attempt to amalgamate with<br />
the PKIU.<br />
From what I hear the PKIU is ready to take a positive approach to the issue,<br />
and that's encouraging for all concerned.<br />
We are now less than six years away from a new century.<br />
Clearly, what we do for the remainder of this decade will determine the sort of<br />
Australia that enters the twenty-first century.<br />
This Government has been out there driving the changes that will make sure<br />
Australia remains a great place to live and bring up kids.<br />
Over the past year, we have undertaken more activity than probably any other<br />
Federal Government be it securing the Mabo legislation, getting agreement to<br />
implement the Hilmer Report, building up APEC, or introducing the raft of<br />
initiatives contained in the White Paper. </p>
<p>We have sought to build structures both inside and outside Australia that will<br />
deliver long term gains for all Australians.<br />
If, as a nation, we can remain comfortable with change keep change our<br />
friend then change won't be forced upon us.<br />
If we can anticipate and prepare for change, then we will have greater control<br />
over our future.<br />
It will be our future and not an imposed future.<br />
As you well know, with an increasingly global marketplace, the waves of<br />
change are growing larger each day and they're coming more frequently.<br />
That can seem very daunting at times.<br />
It can leave many people unsure about the future.<br />
What all Australians must learn to do is surf the wave of change.<br />
That calls for new skills, new capabilities in our working people.<br />
It calls for new thinking, new attitudes and a renewed commitment to doing the<br />
right thing by those who will come after us.<br />
That goes for employers and governments just as much as it goes for workers.<br />
As we prepare for a new century, we must prepare for it in a way that only a<br />
Labor movement can.<br />
That means we keep on board our sense of fairness, decency and<br />
compassion. This is what Working Nation is all about.<br />
The policies we put in place in Working Nation are Labor policies to the core.<br />
Only a Labor Government could have cared sufficiently to make the changes<br />
that will ensure ours is a fair, decent and prosperous Australian community.<br />
Consciously or unconsciously, and I'm not sure anyone has worked Alexander<br />
Downer out on this one, the Liberal's prescription is for two Australian societies<br />
one for the haves, the other for the have-nots.<br />
What's more, the conservatives are frightened of change.<br />
And when they reluctantly choose to embrace it, it's a change backwards<br />
rather than forwards. </p>
<p>Only a Labor Government could have had the imagination that created the<br />
programs in Working Nation.<br />
And only a Labor Government could have the commitment to see those<br />
programs through.<br />
Where were the Tories in all this?<br />
All they could muster were a few miserable and misplaced comments about<br />
cutting the deficit.<br />
And we all know what that really means.<br />
That's Toryspeak for cutting more Australians out of the picture.<br />
Working Nation is designed to ensure that unemployed people share in the<br />
economic recovery.<br />
But it will only come about with the support of all Australians including the<br />
employers and unions.<br />
In order to expand the opportunities available to young Australians and to<br />
provide Australian industry with the skills needed in a modern economy, we<br />
have committed funding to support an additional 50,000 entry-level training<br />
places by the end of 1995-96.<br />
These additional places will be created in training programs such as<br />
apprenticeships and traineeships, in institutional pathways and in labour<br />
market programs with a significant training component.<br />
To prevent the very young falling into long term unemployment, the Youth<br />
Training Initiative combined with individual case management, will help ensure<br />
newly unemployed young people gain access to a suitable education, training<br />
or work experience opportunity.<br />
Over a four year period from 4 July 1994, we will spend a total of $ 10.3 billion<br />
on employment and training initiatives.<br />
Under Working Nation, there will be some 645,000 labour market and entry<br />
level training commencements a year by 1995-96.<br />
Under the J. obCompact, we will assist over 550,000 people who have been<br />
unemployed for 18 months or more over the next four years at a total cost of<br />
$ 4.6 billion.<br />
During the 1995-96 financial year we expect to place some 160,000 people in<br />
the Job Compact, with around 100,000 in subsidised jobs under either Jobstart<br />
or the National Training Wage, and 35,000 in New Work Opportunities. </p>
<p>A training wage will provide an important option for employers and another<br />
avenue of choice for young workers and unemployed people.<br />
The training wage will be particularly valuable for those without existing entrylevel<br />
skills or qualifications.<br />
And it will only apply where the training is structured, portable and certified.<br />
By 1995-96 there will also be some 360,000 labour market program places<br />
available for non-Compact unemployed people a year.<br />
And Government funding will provide support for some 94,000 apprentices and<br />
trainees. Of course, all this won't happen overnight and it won't happen without the<br />
support of unions like the AFMEU.<br />
With your backing we can deliver the outcomes of Working Nation.<br />
Where would we or, more importantly, where would long term unemployed<br />
people have been under the Liberals?<br />
Even the warm and fuzzy version of Fightback would have cut $ 790 million<br />
from support for unemployed people.<br />
Fightback 2 wanted to delay the savings by 12 months.<br />
That would have meant they'd be introducing their cuts about now!<br />
Fightback would have reduced spending on labour market programs by more<br />
than 25 per cent that's the equivalent of 150,000 places.<br />
Under the Coalition's AUSTRAIN proposal, unemrrpjpye~ d people would have<br />
been paid as little as 7per cent of the award wage but ( with no obligation on<br />
the employer to provide any training.<br />
Would the Coalition have been capable of implementing an enterprise<br />
bargaining system that protected workers but was also good for the economy?<br />
Would the Coalition have been able to map out an Accord with the union<br />
movement that would have as its minimum goal 500,000 new jobs in the three<br />
years to 1996?<br />
Would the Coalition have delivered an agreement with the union movement to<br />
support a package providing two Safety Net Adjustments of $ 8.00 a week, one<br />
in this year and one next year?<br />
Would the Coalition have agreed to work with the union movement to look at<br />
new ways to assist families? </p>
<p>It is through the Accord that we are cementing low inflation as a feature of the<br />
Australian economy low inflation critical to creating more jobs and rising<br />
standards of living over the long term.<br />
We've been able to make progress on enterprise bargaining because of the<br />
support from the union movement in the broad and the AFMEU in particular.<br />
It has been the Metals Industry that has led award restructuring, workplace<br />
reform and enterprise bargaining.<br />
Since 1991, we've seen around 700 finalised enterprise agreements in the<br />
Metals industry covering around 160,000 employees and accounting for close<br />
to 40 per cent of all enterprise agreements.<br />
And while much of the reform has been in the medium to large enterprises, I<br />
understand the AFMEU is discussing with the MTIA how enterprise bargaining<br />
can flow through to the smaller enterprises.<br />
Enterprise bargaining has become the primary focus for wage fixing and a vital<br />
catalyst for workplace reform.<br />
And that's why we want to see 80 per cent of employees in the Federal award<br />
sector covered by direct bargains by the end of 1996.<br />
It's also why we've set up a new program that will help unions and business<br />
alike to negotiate workplace agreements.<br />
We've ratified a number of ILO conventions and changed the way the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission functions.<br />
We now have an industrial relations framework that will deliver the labour<br />
market flexibility and productivity growth that is essential for strong and<br />
sustainable growth.<br />
The whole thrust of these labour market and education and training reforms is<br />
to ensure unions have an organic role in the labour marketplace.<br />
These reforms are backed up by a superannuation system that will ensure all<br />
Australians, and not just the wealthy few, have greater security in their<br />
retirement. We've also introduced a child care rebate, a home child care allowance and a<br />
parenting allowance.<br />
And last November we cut taxes.<br />
But we didn't stop there. </p>
<p>Would the Coalition have been capable of introducing industry policy initiatives<br />
that will build competitive firms and create more growth and more jobs?<br />
Working Nation recognised that industry policy can't be developed in isolation<br />
that industry policy depends as much for its success on macro-economic,<br />
industrial relations and trade policy, as it does on specific industry<br />
development and support measures.<br />
Industry policy is about encouraging the development of those characteristics<br />
critical to success in the global marketplace.<br />
It's about creating secure and rewarding jobs in flexible high productivity<br />
workplaces. The raft of Working Nation industry initiatives are good for industry, good for<br />
employment, and good for Australia.<br />
Improving small firm access to finance and increasing research and<br />
development incentives will enable small firms to grow and employ more<br />
people. Giving industry better access to the government purchasing market will also<br />
lead to more jobs.<br />
And because it is new business new products and new services that are at<br />
the forefront of global economic growth, we're embarking on a major campaign<br />
to promote the fundamental need for innovation in everything a firm does.<br />
And that includes seeking out the ideas of those who are down there on the<br />
workplace floor.<br />
It's about tapping into the imagination of all workers.<br />
We want to drive the industry innovation debate over the coming years.<br />
The policies we are embarked on are Labor to their core.<br />
The task we now face is to drive home the White Paper changes over the<br />
coming 12 months.<br />
We want to make the policies outcomes.<br />
It's a big ask, but it's one both I, and my Government, are committed to<br />
achieving. Unions, such as the AFMEU, have a big role to play in meeting this challenge.<br />
And I see the AFMEU playing a leadership role in developing flexible high<br />
productivity workplaces. </p>
<p>7<br />
You have already taken major strides in the right direction.<br />
And your continued support for change will ensure that this Labor Government<br />
delivers the sorts of outcomes that only a Labor Government can.<br />
Thank you. </p>
