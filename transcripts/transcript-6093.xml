.8. PRMME MINSTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 April 1983<br />
one of thle most important results of the National Economic<br />
Summ~ rit Conference was that during the period of wage restraint<br />
increases in dividends and non-wage incomres such as directors'<br />
fees should also be subject to restraint.<br />
Accordingly, I have written to the leaders of many publtic<br />
companies in Australia seeking their support for restr~ a. it<br />
in this area.<br />
Through this statement I would like to extend the rcqucst<br />
to every company in Australia.<br />
A central theme of the Surixit was the common recognition<br />
that economic recovery will require res; traint in expectations<br />
and claims from all. sections of the comirunity, excepL the<br />
irmpoverished.<br />
More specifically, Summit participants agreed thaxt if restraint<br />
was to be exercised, then it would bc universal.<br />
It is important that non-wage incomes do not increase fas ter<br />
than movements in wages.<br />
Employers' representatives at the Summiit recognised that during<br />
the period of wage restraint, dividend increases should also<br />
be restrained.<br />
They agreed to recommend this course to their organisations.<br />
It was also agreed that the Gover~ nm1ent recommwend restraint in<br />
non-wage incomes to all public cormpanies.<br />
The Summit recognised that for many companies the recessio-n<br />
had led to reduced dividends, and restoration of reasonable<br />
profitability was some way off.<br />
Ncvertheless, I would hope that in the spirit of shared<br />
restraint so evident at the Summit, priority in applying<br />
fund!; in the course of recove~ ry would be given to restoring<br />
and expanding job opportunities, ahea&amp; of improvincj dividends.<br />
The Governinent is conscious that restoration of adeqjuate<br />
girowth in the economy will not b~ e ea~ sil~ y or cquickly ilhic" ed,<br />
antdh at recovery will. require consistent application ofa<br />
range of policies. </p>
<p>All of us at the Summuit were agreed, however, that viable<br />
and eqiuitable arrangemzents for secur-ing mutual restraint in<br />
irncomnes were quite central.<br />
It is with thi~ s sense of the importance of what we are<br />
undertaking that I am seeking the support of the whole of<br />
the busineos comxiunity in this matter.<br />
I and my Ministers atre also engaged in discussions with the<br />
ACTU to ensure that the spirit and intent of the-Sununit is<br />
adhered t~ o in remupect of wage incomes in line with the prices<br />
and incomes accord. .3<br />
