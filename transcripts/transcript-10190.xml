F PRIME MINISTER<br />
6 December 1996 TRANSCRIEPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT ST PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much. Mr John Ralph; to Your Grace, Archbishop George Pell;<br />
to you deans, thank you for the very illuminating and informative guide and<br />
tour of inspection of the almost fully restored and renovated St Patrick's<br />
Cathedral. To Mr Ryan, the Chairman of the appeals committee and to all of<br />
those other very generous citizens of Melbourne and supporters of the appeal,<br />
can I say how impressed I am with the Cathedral. I don't think I've seen<br />
anywhere in the world a more magnificent stained glass window than that,<br />
certainly nowhere else in Austr~ alia, and I can understand the commitment and<br />
dedication of Melbourne's Catholic community but also the broader community<br />
to this project.<br />
I am very happy this morig to announce that the Federal Government will<br />
contribute $ 1 million towards the restoration appcaI. I do believe very strongly<br />
that buildings such as St Patrick's Cathedral, they are of course primarily<br />
spiritual centres, and St Patrick has been at the centre of spiritual life for<br />
Catholics and for the Christian religion generally for almost a century since its<br />
consecration in 1897. It's also been a great cultural centre for Melbourne and<br />
very much part of this city for all the years that it has stood, but buildings such<br />
as St Patrick's are also part of Australia's heritage and as we come to celebrate<br />
the Centenary of Federation, it is important that we make provision in both the<br />
material marking of the Centenary of Federation and also the other ways i<br />
which we mark the history of Australia since Federation in 1901, we do make<br />
provision for the place of church buildings and the place of the Christian<br />
religion in the development of Australia. </p>

I mean, for instance I have ensured that one of the Commonwealth members of<br />
the cormmittee to celebrate the Centenary of Australia is Archbishop Peter<br />
Hollingworth the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane and I do think preserving<br />
and restoring some of the richer of our cathedrals it is part of the heritage not<br />
only the religious heritage but also part of the built and monumental heritage of<br />
Australia, and this really is a magnificent cathedral and it speaks volumes for<br />
the loving care and craftsmanship of the people that have been associated with<br />
its restoration, and I was touched when I spoke to Michael, the gentleman<br />
responsible for the restoration of that beautiful Archbishop's chair, and being<br />
here today of course is a re minder of the various tributaries to the Catholic<br />
tradition In Australia.<br />
There is of course that very deep and strong Irish tributary which has played<br />
such a major part not only in shaping and influencing the Catholic Church in<br />
Australia but also shaping and influencing the Australian way of life. There are<br />
few people in Australia who are not in some way touched by the very deep and<br />
rich Irish heritage of this country. And as the years went by I am reminded of<br />
the enormous contribution the other great Catholic tfibutary the people of<br />
Italy who have made a great contribution, an enormous contribution,<br />
particularly the post World War HI story of Catholicism in Australia and also of<br />
Australia generally. And the people of Eastern Europe, from Poland of course,<br />
the birthplace of the present Pope and head of the world wide Catholic Church,<br />
a building like this is a reminder of the various tributaries to the Catholic<br />
experience and the Catholic faith in Australia and the contribution that it has<br />
made. So I am delighted to be here. I am delighted in a material way, as well<br />
as other ways, to associate the Federal Governmnent with this magnificent<br />
restoration. To you Your Grace, I wish you only still fairly recently enthroned your<br />
enthronement occurred about the same time as mine I think! I think it was<br />
separated by a couple of weeks. The process was a little different, and you will<br />
have a tenure of the office perhaps, I think it could, in the normal course of<br />
events be longer than mine, although I'll try hard to match it, but it is a delight<br />
to be your guest-I wish all of the parishioners of St Patrick's the very best of<br />
good fortune. I thank the Catholic community of Melbourne for the way in<br />
which they have contributed so richly to the life of this city and to the life of<br />
Australia and I hope in a small way this contribution helps the appeal and I<br />
hope you will see it as a symbol of the honour that the Australian community<br />
does to the Catholic Church and to the Catholic community for the contribution<br />
that it has made to our nation.<br />
Thank you. </p>
