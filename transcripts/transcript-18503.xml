The Prime Minister and First Ministers today committed to working together towards reducing the regulatory burden on the not-for-profit sector.</p>
<p>The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to the terms of reference, work plan and initial milestones for a new Not-for-profit Reform Working Group.</p>
<p>The working group will develop and recommend options for reform of the sector and help progress our not-for-profit reform agenda.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has committed to working together with the States and Territories on an effective national approach to not-for-profit regulation.</p>
<p>Streamlining and consolidating regulations will reduce red tape and compliance costs and enhance transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>This will help not-for-profit organisations focus on the important work they do in delivering services and supporting vulnerable members of the Australian community.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has already taken important steps to strengthen the sector. </p>
<p>As part of the 2011-12 Budget, we announced a number of regulatory reforms at the Commonwealth level, including the establishment of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) and the development of a statutory definition of charity.</p>
<p>Further information about the Commonwealth Government's not-for-profit reform agenda and copies of the Working Group's terms of reference and work plan are available at <a href="http://www.treasury.gov.au">www.treasury.gov.au</a>. </p>
