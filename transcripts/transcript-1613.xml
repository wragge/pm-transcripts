FOR PRESS P. M. No. 64/ 1967<br />
NEW SOUTH VWALES AND QUEENSLAND FLOODS<br />
COMMONVI EALTH SSISTA NCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Following the recent floods in Southern Queensland<br />
and Northern New South V: ales, the Premiers of the two States have<br />
requested Commonwealth financial assistance for the relief of personal<br />
hardship and distress. A lthough relief schemes following events of this<br />
nature are a matter for the States, it has been the practice of the<br />
Commonwealth Government, in recognition of the need on humanitarian<br />
grounds to take special action for the quick alleviation of individual cases<br />
of hardship and distress, to assist the State Governments on a dollar for<br />
dollar basis in the financing of these relief schemes.<br />
Accordingly, I have informed the Premier of Queensland<br />
and the Premier of New South Wales that the Commonwealth will participate<br />
with their Governments on a dollar for dollar basis in the relief of personal<br />
hardship and distress occasioned by these floods.<br />
