    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>In fact he joins me on the line now. Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning. How are you Howard? There's still a bit of an</p>
<p>   echo. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>(Inaudible)...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The echo is back.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right we will immediately..., it must be something about Canberra</p>
<p>   to Western Australia that everything that we say to you and you</p>
<p>   say to us comes back.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we always look after Western Australia extremely well.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now the question people said........</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>[inaudible]there's a lot of echo.</p>
<p>SATTLER: </p>
<p>But the question that was asked of me this morning when I said</p>
<p>   we've got the segment coming up is how long is he planning</p>
<p>   to participate in these?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A long time.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Not just till the election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because whenever the election's held, I am quietly confident,</p>
<p>   I'm not arrogant or complacent, I'm quietly confident</p>
<p>   and I'll be very happy to come back after the election and</p>
<p>   do it on a regular basis. It's not just pre-election flash</p>
<p>   in the pan.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It was only a sceptic that said that to me.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Dear me. Well they shouldn't be sceptical.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. Now given some of the statements that are made by politicians</p>
<p>   from the major parties in the past 24 hours, the trade deficit yesterday,</p>
<p>   is the electorate entitled to be sceptical that either of the major</p>
<p>   parties are capable of successfully managing the economy of this</p>
<p>   country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they're certainly entitled to be sceptical about the</p>
<p>   Labor Party or indeed any other party on offer managing the economy.</p>
<p>   Just three quarters of an hour ago we had some economic news which</p>
<p>   showed the Australian economy has grown by 5%. I repeat, 5% over</p>
<p>   the last 12 months. And apart from the current account deficit,</p>
<p>   every single major economic indicator is running about as strongly</p>
<p>   as you could have it running. We've got the lowest interest</p>
<p>   rates in 30 years, we've got the lowest inflation in the western</p>
<p>   world, we've got strong business investment, we've turned</p>
<p>   a $10.5 billion deficit into a $2.7 billion surplus and overall</p>
<p>   the economy is really performing well and we have given it security</p>
<p>   and safety amidst all of this Asian economic turmoil. Now I don't</p>
<p>   deny, the echo's gone, and I hope all the listeners are still</p>
<p>   there, we have given it a great deal of stability despite the Asian</p>
<p>   economic turbulence. The current account deficit is naturally going</p>
<p>   in a way we don't want because....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I was coming to that. $7.5 billion......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The reason that that is happening is because our exports to Asia</p>
<p>   are slowing down and we knew that would happen and that is all the</p>
<p>   more reason that the other things that we have got right should</p>
<p>   have been got right. I mean just imagine how vulnerable our current</p>
<p>   account would now be if we kept Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   deficit. Just imagine if Mr Beazley's economic policies had</p>
<p>   been implemented. Our current account deficit and therefore the</p>
<p>   entire Australian economy would be a lot more vulnerable than what</p>
<p>   it now is. When you've got a current account deficit under</p>
<p>   pressure you need a Budget surplus. When you've got a current</p>
<p>   account deficit under pressure because of a loss of exports you</p>
<p>   need the economic management that we've given over the last</p>
<p>   couple of years. Not the reverse that was urged upon us.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But the trade deficit of $7.5 billion this time round, surely that's</p>
<p>   going to get worse as the Asian economic crisis really bites in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, youÂve got to keep it in perspective. It's not</p>
<p>   so much the dollar amount, it's the proportion it represents</p>
<p>   of wealth.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, don't try and confuse us here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not trying to confuse you but obviously a dollar 50 years</p>
<p>   ago had a different value than a dollar today, didn't it?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It sure did.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there you are, I mean that's the point, you've proved</p>
<p>   it. You've got to look at the proportions....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I am not here to help you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I know you are not. You are here to interrogate me and that's</p>
<p>   fair enough. But I am just trying to, you know, I am just making</p>
<p>   the point.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But surely the deficit will get worse before it gets better.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am not going to make predictions about it. I acknowledge,</p>
<p>   as the Treasurer did yesterday, that because of the Asian economic</p>
<p>   downturn it's had an impact but you've got to look at</p>
<p>   all of the solid indicators on every other front. And I say again</p>
<p>   that if we had not got those indicators solid then our position</p>
<p>   on the external account would have been a lot more vulnerable. This</p>
<p>   is not a time for returning to the tax and spend policies of the</p>
<p>   Labor Party. This is not a time to risk the Labor Party with its</p>
<p>   big spending policies that will push up interest rates again.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you happy that Gareth Evans is the Shadow Treasurer given his</p>
<p>   statements yesterday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am not only happy he is the Shadow Treasurer but I am also</p>
<p>   happy that his leader Mr Beazley is the Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p>   because.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But he didn't make the blunder that....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I tell you what, he made an interesting comment this morning</p>
<p>   which I am just about to refer to. At 11:00am this morning I looked</p>
<p>   at the wire and it had Mr Beazley talking about upward pressure</p>
<p>   on interest rates. And right on cue, eight minutes later, the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Bank of Australia announced a reduction of 0.35 per cent on its</p>
<p>   three, four and five year fixed rate home loans. In other words,</p>
<p>   the Leader of the Opposition is saying in one breath, there are</p>
<p>   market pressures pushing interest rates up and the market is giving</p>
<p>   the thumbs down to his prediction eight minutes later and saying</p>
<p>   they are cutting the rates.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Have you got some friends at the Commonwealth Bank have you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well I know a lot of people everywhere. I have, I've got</p>
<p>   friends all over Australia but I can say that within eight minutes</p>
<p>   of that very negative uninformed ignorant prediction by the Leader</p>
<p>   Opposition, the Commonwealth Bank says that it's cutting its</p>
<p>   interest rates. Now I am not going to dwell on the reduction in</p>
<p>   interest rates, I am simply going to dwell on the fact that so far</p>
<p>   from the market believing Mr Beazley, the market is going in exactly</p>
<p>   the opposite direction.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How fortuitous.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't....this is a market matter. I mean eight minutes</p>
<p>   later, right on cue, the Commonwealth Bank drops interest rates</p>
<p>   eight minutes after Mr Beazley said our policies were putting upward</p>
<p>   pressure on interest rates. The average home owner, Howard, is $300</p>
<p>   to $330 a month better off, better off as a result of the interest</p>
<p>   rate reductions that have happened under my Government and those</p>
<p>   interest rate reductions are a direct result of the policies that</p>
<p>   we have pursued.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, now John Howard is not one who is given to personal</p>
<p>   attacks on people but you described the views of Pauline Hanson</p>
<p>   after a speech last night as deranged, erratic and ignorant. That's</p>
<p>   pretty personal isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's factual.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But it's personal.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not personal in a sense that I am attacking her character.</p>
<p>   It's personal in a sense that what she said in her speech was</p>
<p>   wrong and uninformed and it was so wrong and that it warranted the</p>
<p>   criticism that I made. I mean let me tell you what was wrong, I</p>
<p>   mean, she first of all described what is an unenforceable non-legally</p>
<p>   binding declaration as a treaty. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>This is the one on the rights of Indigenous People?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, on the rights of Indigenous People. Secondly, she accused</p>
<p>   my Government of really conspiring to keep this secret. In fact,</p>
<p>   my Government has adopted a very open process toward treaty making.</p>
<p>   Thirdly, she suggested that we were supporting a policy that was</p>
<p>   going to lead to taxpayer funded Aboriginal states in Australia.</p>
<p>   Now can I just say that is ignorant. That is uninformed. It is wrong</p>
<p>   and it is ignorant. Now what I have said in relation to Mrs Hanson</p>
<p>   is that I won't scream abuse at her supporters. I will not</p>
<p>   talk excessively about her, only if she says something that is wrong</p>
<p>   or uninformed. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But what does article 31 mean when it states that Indigenous People</p>
<p>   have the right to autonomy or self-government over their own affairs.</p>
<p>   I mean what does that mean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, we haven't agreed to that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So we are not going to sign it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I certainly am not going to agree to something that produces</p>
<p>   that, I can make it plain right now. I mean we have already made</p>
<p>   it plain months ago that we have a lot of reservations, a lot of</p>
<p>   reservations about her policy, about elements of this declaration.</p>
<p>   I mean it doesn't need, it doesn't need Mrs Hanson to</p>
<p>   come along, exaggerate the situation, mislead the Australian public</p>
<p>   about the behaviour of my Government. I mean I make it perfectly</p>
<p>   clear, we are not going to agree to anything that infringes Australian</p>
<p>   sovereignty.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So you agree with her that we shouldn't sign something that</p>
<p>   says that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I...well it's a question of whether she agrees with me.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well she said we shouldn't sign something like that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look Howard, I have made it perfectly clear, and my Government</p>
<p>   has made it clear, that we are not going to agree to anything, anywhere</p>
<p>   that infringes Australian sovereignty, full stop. And the idea of</p>
<p>   there being a policy drive by my Government to have taxpayer funded</p>
<p>   Aboriginal states within Australia, I mean that is what she said.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Who do you regard as indigenous people in this country, who are</p>
<p>   they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But aren't they you and me too? Because the Oxford dictionary</p>
<p>   she said, said that indigenous means you are born in this country.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, can I tell you that I am more interested in a common definition</p>
<p>   that embraces all of us and that is the definition that we are all</p>
<p>   Australian.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you've agreed to talk with our listeners as</p>
<p>   well, so if you don't mind we will take a short break, pay</p>
<p>   a couple of bills, and we will be back taking some calls. </p>
<p>Just one question Prime Minister before we get to our first caller.</p>
<p>   I notice that you have, or they are reporting, that you personally</p>
<p>   intervened to ask Spain to reject Christopher Skase's bid to</p>
<p>   stay in Majorca. How come you've got involved?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well because I share the resentment of the Australian public and</p>
<p>   I represent that resentment as Prime Minister at what Christopher</p>
<p>   Skase has been able to do. And I want him brought back to this country</p>
<p>   to face the laws of Australia. And I say that on behalf of a lot</p>
<p>   of people who have suffered as a consequence of his behaviour and</p>
<p>   my Government will do all it can to see that he is brought home.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So have you spoken with the Prime Minister.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>No, I've written to the Prime Minister of Spain. I did that</p>
<p>   last week as part of a concerted Government effort to get this man</p>
<p>   back to face justice in Australia. </p>
<p>SATTLER: </p>
<p>Has there been any response?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Not yet but I would imagine that my letter will have some effect</p>
<p>   on the attitude of the Spanish Government. I mean, it remains the</p>
<p>   case that we're trying to get him back and we are going to</p>
<p>   use all of the legal means that are at our disposal to do so. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you think he is a con-man?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a matter for the Australian courts to decide. I must restrain</p>
<p>   myself in these matters but he has ....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'm talking about his health actually.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, don't... you understand there are legal processes</p>
<p>   at...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'd like to be as sick as him.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to say anything that will any way undermine the</p>
<p>   legal case against him.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But he reckons your Government is trying to kill him.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Please don't provoke me.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You're not trying to kill him are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What's your next question?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, well our next question comes from Lindsay on the open</p>
<p>   line. Hi Lindsay, the Prime Minister's listening.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Lindsay.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>My question is with your statement the other day, or when you made</p>
<p>   it a few years ago. The Ânever ever' statement of the</p>
<p>   GST. I'm sort of what you'd probably call a swinging voter.</p>
<p>   I think what Mr Beazley and Mr Keating did with the L-A-W bit was</p>
<p>   just as bad. But I think there's a lot of people like me who</p>
<p>   can't, now, can't tell the difference between either party</p>
<p>   because you lie... you don't exactly come and tell the truth.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, hang on, there's a huge difference. Mr Beazley and Mr</p>
<p>   Keating made that L-A-W commitment. Then there was an election,</p>
<p>   and then they did the exact opposite.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>But so did you didn't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no. I haven't. Because what I'm now doing is saying</p>
<p>   I've changed my mind and I'm going to have an election</p>
<p>   to give the Australian public an opportunity to say whether they</p>
<p>   endorse our policy or not. And if they don't like the fact</p>
<p>   that I've changed my mind and I'm now supporting tax reform</p>
<p>   in a comprehensive way, then they can vote against me. I'm</p>
<p>   not getting in on one pretence and doing the opposite. I am in fact</p>
<p>   saying to the Australian people, I now have a different position</p>
<p>   on this issue, I believe that reform of this character is necessary</p>
<p>   for Australia's future. Having gone to the people on a certain</p>
<p>   basis last time, I'm going to put my new position to the public</p>
<p>   at the next election. Now, they have an opportunity to pass judgement.</p>
<p>   Now, I don't regard that as in any way dishonourable or dishonest.</p>
<p>   I believe that to be as transparent as any political leader can</p>
<p>   ever be. I mean, otherwise you'll have a situation where you</p>
<p>   could never ever change your mind on anything.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, perhaps you shouldn't use those words.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, all right, if we are going to conduct national politics</p>
<p>   on the basis of a grammar or syntax lesson, rather than on the basis</p>
<p>   of people communicating policies before an election, implementing</p>
<p>   them after the election and if they change their mind going to another</p>
<p>   election before they have changed policies, I mean, we've really</p>
<p>   got to conduct public affairs on that basis rather than on a pedantic</p>
<p>   grammatical basis.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, we'll move on. Our next caller's Clem. Hello</p>
<p>   Clem.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello Howard. Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes Clem.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'm inquiring about the pensions. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Now, the basic wage went up a few weeks ago, and the pensions now</p>
<p>   have dropped behind. When are we going to be brought up to scratch?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Clem, that's not right. There was an increase a couple</p>
<p>   of months ago, a special increase of about $5.80 in the pension.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And that was a result of the decision of my Government to link</p>
<p>   the pension to increases in average male earnings, average male</p>
<p>   ordinary time earnings is the technical expression. Now that, we</p>
<p>   don't have a basic wage as such, but I know what you are talking</p>
<p>   about and in a sense that linkage is as close as you can get to</p>
<p>   what we used to call the basic wage in Australia. And I think you'll</p>
<p>   find that, at the moment, that the ordinary inflation rate or consumer</p>
<p>   price index is actually not moving at all, but because we decided</p>
<p>   to link pension increases with this basic wage as you might call</p>
<p>   it, or male ordinary time earnings, we were able to lift the pension</p>
<p>   by a special amount of $5.80.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And Prime Minister, with the new indirect tax, which I'm pretty</p>
<p>   sure you are going to propose, if it does cost pensioners more to</p>
<p>   live, to go and buy their basic items, will you lift the pension</p>
<p>   or make them exempt?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can give a firm statement that if there is any change in the</p>
<p>   tax system, people on the pension will be fully protected in relation</p>
<p>   to any increases.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Compensated?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fully compensated, protected, guarded, recompensed, whatever expression</p>
<p>   you want to use. We're not going to change the tax system in</p>
<p>   a way that disadvantages low income earners, but we do want to get</p>
<p>   more fairness into the system overall. We're certainly not</p>
<p>   going to put a Goods and Services Tax on top of the existing taxes.</p>
<p>   If we were to introduce such a tax it would obviously replace some</p>
<p>   existing indirect taxes and overall the system would be, along with</p>
<p>   personal income tax reductions, a lot fairer.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, just a few more minutes to go here, and Beverly wants to</p>
<p>   talk with you. Hi Beverly.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hi Howard, and good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Beverly.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about multi-nationals</p>
<p>   and then I'll hang up and listen to your answer.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Is it true that a minimum of $200 billion profit leaves Australia</p>
<p>   each year, and that multinationals pay little or no tax on this</p>
<p>   money, and that Australia is now 90% foreign owned?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know where you've got those figures from</p>
<p>   but multi-national companies are obliged to pay tax in accordance</p>
<p>   with Australian law, and multi-national companies of course employ</p>
<p>   many hundreds of thousands of Australians and provide them with</p>
<p>   them with jobs and invest in our industries and those industries</p>
<p>   pay tax and the people who employ them pay tax. Particular examples</p>
<p>   of abuse of the tax system by a multi-national company or indeed</p>
<p>   an Australian company when brought to my attention or the Treasurer's</p>
<p>   attention, are dealt with.</p>
