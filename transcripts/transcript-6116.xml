PRIME MINISTER<br />
The attached letter was sent to the Tasmnanian Premier,<br />
Mr Gray on May 17, 1983. </p>
<p>Dear I-Ir Gray<br />
As you are aware, by the end of May the High Court<br />
is likely to have commenced its hearing on matters<br />
affecting the future of the Gordon below Franklin dam.<br />
For the sake of the workforce related to that project<br />
and the well--being of the Tasmanian community in general,<br />
it seems sensible to tpreoare for any contingency that<br />
can possibly arise out of the Hligh Court decision the<br />
most critical being the need to develop interim<br />
measures to protect the work-Eorce which will possibly<br />
be affected by the decision.<br />
I understand that at the political or Government-to-<br />
Government level, you could be reluctant at present<br />
to enter int~ o negotiations, as it may appear to be a<br />
concession in anticipation of-an adverse result to<br />
your position.<br />
While understanding a possible reluctance on your part,<br />
I consider it advisable to try and cover all conLingericies<br />
that could flow from the High Court decision. The most<br />
urgent contingency is to prepare for the implementation<br />
of transitionary work programs in order that they take<br />
effect as soon as possible if a decision is brought<br />
down in our favour.<br />
Accordingly, we would appreciate you agreeing to<br />
allowing without prejudice discussions to comzmence<br />
at a Departmental level between the relevant State and<br />
Federal counterparts.<br />
Those discussions, amiongst other matters, would need<br />
to examine alternative* power -generating programs<br />
and socially and economically Justifiable works<br />
programs designed to cover the transitionary period.<br />
Such discussions may need to involve conmmunity groups,<br />
employers, unions and representatives of West Coast<br />
municipalities. .2/ </p>
<p>I cons acecr the' mn L7ter urc-ent, LIs every outcom1e must<br />
be covered to protect th' 2 Tasrnianian workforce.<br />
I would appreciate your early response. Yours sincerely Hawke)<br />
The Hon R. T. Gray, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
HOBART TAS 7000 </p>
