PRIME MINISTER WEDNESDAY 12 MARCH 1980<br />
-From the Press Office SUMMARY OF AM<br />
Later on this morning Sir John Moore will hold meetings with parties<br />
in the oil dispute to try to find a solution. One crucial aspect<br />
is not in fact an'industrial matter but a civil one, the injunction<br />
gained by Mr. Leon Laidley against the TWU in the Federal Court.<br />
This raises the question can Sir John Moore arbitrate above the<br />
authority of the Federal Court. Peter Jefferson spoke to a specialist<br />
in company law from Monash University, Professor Robert Bax. Even if<br />
though the industrial dispute is settled this may not resolve Mr.<br />
Laidley's particular action and if he is intent on proceeding with<br />
that particular action he will be able to do so. Professor Bax says<br />
that ultimately the dispute is in the hands of Mr. Laidley and he<br />
can really continue it indefinitely until the injunction has been<br />
carried through and the court action has been finalised. So despite<br />
the action of Sir John Moore the action could continue indefinitely.<br />
Mr. Laidley refused an interview but said that he still believes<br />
he is right and won't be withdrawing the injunction.<br />
The Prime Minister bought into the TWU dispute last night when he<br />
made it quite clear that he regards it as an issue of union power<br />
versus the law. Addressing the Directors Institute in Sydney, Mr.<br />
Fraser also criticised the role of the NSW Government in industrial<br />
disputes and hinted strongly that a law* and order election is on the cards.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Current the Transport Workers Union dispute threatens to bring NSW<br />
and maybe Australia to a standstill. This dispute is not about<br />
wages; it's not about a fight between unions, or between Federal<br />
and State branches of a union; it's purely a fight within one State<br />
union. Here we have a citizen of Australia, not trying to deny<br />
anyone business, not trying to say a non unionist should do his work;<br />
not saying that another union should do the work, but merely saying<br />
that his own employee, that a person who is still a member of the<br />
same State union-' should do the work. But the union~ says no<br />
somebody else a member of the union, should do the work. And as a<br />
consequence the State looks like being paralysed. The dispute is<br />
the height of absurdity. Too often I think in this State encouragement<br />
has been given to the belief that some State unions will achieve<br />
support from the State Government if they are tough enough or<br />
militant enough. And there is evidence of this on more than one<br />
occasion. But that leads to another point of great importance<br />
the role of trade unions and the role of law in industrial matters.<br />
Some unions have incomes of millions of dollars a year. They have<br />
great power. Many of them have much more power than any company or<br />
corporation. But nobody suggpests that companies should be allowed<br />
to operate outside the law, however much some companies might like it.<br />
When Mr. Walker prosecutes a director of some company, nobody suggests<br />
that he should not . be fined or at times go to gaol if the verdict is<br />
guilty. The company director must operate within company law and<br />
people expect that the law will be upheld. People don't say that<br />
the problem ought to be resolved merely by reconciliation. They<br />
simply say that the law has been broken and there is a penalty. Why<br />
then when we come to industrial relations, which damages the interests<br />
of a great deal more people than any company ever could, do some<br />
people suggest that there should be no law at all. that laws only<br />
provoke, that the only solution has got to be by negotiation. That<br />
is not a credible position for Australia or for any Government. We<br />
have seen in the history of trade unionism that when unions possess </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
unrestrained powers often they use those powers to gain what they<br />
want for themselves while ignoring the interests of the wider<br />
Australian community. We need to have law to establish the framework<br />
within which unions operate. We also have to have law that can and<br />
will be upheld. At the moment there is an unhealthy balance between<br />
some people and groups possessing indisputable political, economic<br />
and union power and the bulk of Australians to whom both of those<br />
are denied.<br />
Sean Dorney reports from Port Moresby on the fall of Mr. Somare<br />
and the new government of Sir Julius Chan. Sir Julius Chan said<br />
he wanted to establish first a dialogue between the new government<br />
and the Government of Australia and it was necessary to understand<br />
each other. He said there was no need to change unless there was<br />
a need for change.<br />
Cleaning up after America's worst nuclear accident has created more<br />
controversy in Pennsylvania. This week major steps are being taken<br />
to de-contaminate the crippled reactor. Geoff McMullen reports<br />
from Washington.<br />
Mr. Mugabe has announced his new cabinet. As well as including<br />
members of his own Zanu PF party, he's also appointed 4 Patriotic<br />
Front members and two white ministers. Ken Begg spoke to the<br />
Diplomatic Editor of the Guardian newspaper for his assessment.<br />
When asked if this ship of State was likely to be one that was<br />
acceptable to Mrs. Thatcher but also to Mr. Fraser, the editor of<br />
the Guardian replied that this was a case when Australia was in<br />
the best sense of the word the ' Godfather'. He said" Malcolm Fraser,<br />
the conservative Prime Minister of Australia and Michael Manley<br />
the Socialist Prime Minister of Jamaica talking to each other on<br />
the phone for a period of weeks before the Commonwealth summit in<br />
Lusaka last August. I confirmed this with both men in Lusaka when<br />
the Summit was over. Yes they talked a great deal. Yes they<br />
had in fact plann'ed the operation which then took place for<br />
when Maggie Thatcher arrived as a British Conservative Prime<br />
Minister she found a blueprint prepared for her by these two very<br />
energetic men. So it was a Fraser-Manley plan and they got into<br />
that Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Chairman of the Conference, Dr.<br />
Julius Nyerere, head of the front line states and they... put in<br />
Nigeria. There you have the team that put together the Lusaka<br />
formula. And now we've had in the election and the forming of<br />
this cabinet the testing of that formula. It's stood the test.<br />
It's come through. The right man in my view has won because he's a<br />
strong man and what he says goes and from what I saw of the Australian<br />
team in operation, not only in Lusaka then but more recently they<br />
have been on the spot * for ei4ht weeks a very top team, an able<br />
team the eyes and ears of Malcolm Fraser in Salisbury monitoring<br />
the whole thing.-I would say Australia has given them a fair wind<br />
and they will respond. Australia has made a powerful friend in<br />
Southern Africa. Australia has taken a calculated risk in launching<br />
something but at the same time it's delivered the thing that the<br />
Queen in her message in the same week a message for Commonwealth<br />
Day, has said, which is the finest gift we could Southern Africa,<br />
which is peace with dignity". Patrick Keatley.<br />
From Moscow David Willis reports that the Soviet Union apart from<br />
stepping up its military activities in Afghanistan has issued a<br />
flurry of statements on Asian affairs, warning the Philippines and<br />
Indonesia not to rove closer to China and professing to be pleased with </p>
<p>t~ ho developments here in Australia. The Kremlin is watching with<br />
great suspicion the current tour of ASEAN countries by the Chinese<br />
Foreign Minister. Tass has also pounced with considerable delight<br />
on two news stories coming from Australia. One appeared in the<br />
Australian Financial Review saying, according to Tass that the<br />
Fraser Government had rejected an American proposal to reconstruct<br />
the naval base at Cockburn Sound in Western Australia to allow US<br />
nuclear powered aircraft carriers to call there. Tass says that<br />
this showed the impact of mounting protests by the Australian public<br />
saying that Canberra was simply a lackey of the United States.<br />
The Fraser Government's denial of the Financial Review story has not<br />
been mentioned by Tass. Tass has also released a re port . on a<br />
statement issued by a group of Australian sportsmen which opposes a<br />
boycott of the Moscow Olympics in July. According to Tass the<br />
statement said that boycotting the Olympics was something akin to<br />
boycotting the. United Nations. Tass quoted marathon runner, Bill<br />
Scott as saying that he would defy any Australian Government boycott.<br />
The statement itself Tass claimed, indicated that the Fraser<br />
Government's solidarity with the US in supporting a boycott is not<br />
agreed to inside the country.<br />
There is to be two Labor Parties in Queensland operating out of<br />
separate offices with neither recognising the other at least<br />
until the question of intervention can be finalised one way or the<br />
other. Mr.-. Hayden flew into Brisbane yesterday after suspended<br />
administrative committee members led by Mr. Hauenschild had gone<br />
back on a compromise agreement reached over the weekend. Mr. Hayden<br />
said alternative offices were to be set up and they'd run in%<br />
opposition to the suspended committee, which is still in control of<br />
the Breakfast Creek party headquarters. Even Ed Casey who has been<br />
closely aligned with the ' old guard' or junta is surprised by Mr.<br />
Hauenschild's rejection and he has called for a complete reconsideration.<br />
In Brisbane Mr. Hayden is speaking with Jane<br />
Singleton.<br />
Mr. Hayden<br />
Mr. Casey is absolutely stunned at the decision of the junta to<br />
reject the negotiated understandings -* hat arose at a meeting in<br />
Sydney on Saturday.<br />
Question Mr. Casey was there.<br />
Mr. Hayden<br />
Like me. Like everyone else he went away under the clear impression<br />
that the representatives of the Queensland ruling group or ( inaud)<br />
previously ruling the . party.. were happy with the decisions. And with<br />
good reason they achieved some substantial concessions. Some I<br />
wasn't too happy about.<br />
Question<br />
Their compromising is unstulck. So what happens now?<br />
Mr. Hayden<br />
Well we have no recourse now but to follow the determination of the<br />
Federal Executive in its resolution that provides for a number of<br />
things the setting up of an interim committee, that if people </p>
<p>iAvited to serve on it don't accept appointments the appointment<br />
16f other people to talk with people who will serve on that committee<br />
to take steps to set up an office for the official structure of the<br />
Australian Labor Party and in fact get things going. We have the<br />
support of the Branches, the junta doesn't have the support of the<br />
Branches. Question Mr. Hauenschild still claims however that his branch of the Party<br />
is the one and only branch. What is to be done about it?<br />
Mr. Hayden<br />
Well I'm not going to waste time as to who is the good, the pure<br />
and the virtuous, we are the official structure of the Partythat's<br />
well established and we'll set up offices in Brisbane. We've<br />
had offers. We have quite sufficient money to run the Party. We<br />
have the support of the Branches. That's the important thing.<br />
Question So you're going to have what amounts to two groups claiming they<br />
are the ALP in Queensland.<br />
Mr. Hayden<br />
Oh there'll be a significance difference between the two groups.<br />
One, that is the one that is recognised by the National Executive<br />
and affiliated to it. We'll be the one which will prosper and<br />
they'll have public respect. It will be the one which will have<br />
the support of the branches and a growing number of trade unions<br />
The other will be the one that has brought so much discredit and<br />
you know that so much dissatisfaction within the Labor Party.<br />
Question Do you think Mr Hauenschild might be waiting for Mr. Hawke to<br />
return in the hope that he might sort it out as he is against<br />
intervention?<br />
Mr. Hayden<br />
Well I have no idea. But I don't think that Mr. Hawke would be<br />
keen to become involved. Mr. Hawke is purely identified with the junta<br />
people in. Queensland and therefore t * o talk about any outsider -becoming<br />
involved * in the problem here would imply that it would have to<br />
be someone mutually acceptable and someone not recognised as being<br />
committed to one side or the other. Now that would rule Mr. Hawke<br />
out and a lot of other -people.<br />
Talks are to'be held in Perth between aboriginals and the Western<br />
Australian Government to try to resolve-the Noonkanbah dispute.<br />
