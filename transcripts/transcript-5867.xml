CHECK AGAINST DELIVER1Y<br />
1,, A US RA LtA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY 18 JULY 1982<br />
SPEECH TO THE QUEENSLAND STATE COUNCIL<br />
it is a great pleasure for me to be in Queensland again.<br />
This state has made an enormous contribution to.<br />
Australia and the Liberal Party has played a major part<br />
in building this state up. Queensland is in the<br />
forefront in many different fields.<br />
SAs host of th e Commonwealth Games, Queenslanders have<br />
made a tremendous effort to ensure that the Games will<br />
be a success, and all Australians can be proud of<br />
buildings such as this sports complex which will not<br />
only contribute to the success of the Games but * will<br />
improve the sporting facilities of the Brisbane area. I<br />
am very much looking forward to being in Brisbane during<br />
the Commonwealth Games. Queensland has also become a<br />
growing cultural force in Australia. The impressive<br />
youth orchestra, festival ' 82 and Brisbane's excellent<br />
new cultural centre are examples of how this state is<br />
earning a world-wide reputation in the arts.<br />
But there is no doubt that Queensland is best known for<br />
the contribut ion it has made to Australia's economic<br />
development. On the latest three monthly figures, it<br />
has the lowest: unemployment rate of any state in<br />
Australia, it has the highest rate of employment growth,<br />
and over 25% of all investment in Australia is committed<br />
to Queensland. That record has been achieved by<br />
encouraging private enterprise in a way which should be<br />
an example to the rest of Australia by welcoming<br />
investment, and by vigorously developing the state's<br />
natural economic advantages.<br />
The Queensland Government was the first Australian<br />
Government to abolish probate duty, and that abolition<br />
did a great deal to attract investment to this State<br />
from the sout-i. In contrast, the Cain Labor Government<br />
of Victoria is the first State to reintroduce probate<br />
duty. Mr Cain's probate duty will be levied at a rate<br />
of 39 cents in the dollar. Nobody in their right mind<br />
will start a new business in Victoria. People who want<br />
their businesses to grow,<br />
will transfer them to Queensland or elsewhere and there<br />
will be fewer jobs. Retired people will come to<br />
Queensland in even greater numbers. There will be empty<br />
houses all over the state, * the building industry will be<br />
hard hit and with the exodus from Victoria, prices of homes<br />
are bound to fall. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
In 1975, fol. lowing three years of Mr Whitlam's<br />
Government, more people left Australia than arrived, the<br />
only year s4. nce 1945 when this occurred. Mr Cain should<br />
be congratu: lated he is going to achieve a net exodus<br />
from Victoria in less than 3 years. Mr Cain's action is<br />
a typical example of Labor damaging an economy in<br />
pursuit of socialist dogma.<br />
Today I would like to say something about economic<br />
problems around the world, how they are affecting<br />
Australia and the needless difficulties which are<br />
sometimes created within our own community. And in the<br />
light of the recent Labor Conference and the divisions<br />
that racked the Labor Party last week, I also want to<br />
say something about the dangers of a Labor Government,<br />
and the effect socialism would have on Australia, and<br />
how we as Liberals are best equipped to meet Australia's<br />
economic challenges.<br />
In recent years responsible economic policies have<br />
brought considerable economic success to all<br />
Australians, success which we had almost begun to take<br />
for granted. For several years we have had a higher<br />
growth rate than the 0. E. C. D. average, we have had a<br />
lower inflation rate than the 0. E. C. D. average, our<br />
unemployment rate, although too high, was below the<br />
O. E. C. D. average in 1981, and employment grew by over<br />
375,000 in the three years to the end of 1981. That was<br />
a record Australians could be proud of but we must now<br />
realise it will be a difficult record to retain.<br />
World economic conditions have deteriorated in a way<br />
no-one anticipated and with this continued<br />
deterioration, Australian economic conditions have also<br />
changed. Internationally, industrial production in the<br />
March quarter has fallen or stagnated in six of the<br />
seven major world economies, and the American motor<br />
industry, to take an example, is only operating at half<br />
its capacity. World trade has contracted for the first<br />
time in 20 years last year, and real interest rates are<br />
at historically high levels.<br />
We have been told repeatedly that economic recovery will<br />
come in six months. I suppose if you say that often<br />
enough you are bound eventually to be right, but I will<br />
believe it when I see it. While we wait for the<br />
recovery we must understand that the world recession is<br />
now hitting Australia hard. Australia is the 13th<br />
largest industrial trading nation in the world and<br />
therefore the decline in world trade, and the slump in<br />
commodity prices was certain to have a very real impact<br />
on our economy, including on the Queensland economy. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Those who think we are immune from world conditions fall<br />
to ' understand the nature of the Australian economy.<br />
Between 1979/ 80 and 1981/ 82 copper prices have fallen<br />
from $ 1955 to $ 1231 per tonne, iron and steel prices<br />
from $ 211 to $ 163 per tonne, aluminium prices from $ 1410<br />
to $ 1072 per tonne, beef prices from $ 2267 to S1609 per<br />
tonne, wheat prices from $ 147 to $ 138 per tonne and<br />
sugar price! s from $ 377 to S266 per tonne. Declining<br />
export markets have also affected investment in<br />
Australia. The growth in investment reached a 30 year record just a<br />
year ago, but that growth has now virtually ceased.<br />
And while investment still remains at a relatively high<br />
level it has done so because a number of investment<br />
projects have yet to reach completion. Substantial new<br />
investment decisions are unlikely while world economic<br />
conditions remain stagnant.<br />
But it is not only world economic conditions which are<br />
responsible for the current difficulties in the<br />
Australian economy. We have not been helping ourselves<br />
as well as we might have. Rising production costs in<br />
Australia " nave pushed our inflation rate above the<br />
O. E. C. D. average. In the 12 months to the end of March,<br />
Australia': s inflation rate was two percentage points<br />
above the D. E. C. D. average. A significant cause of all<br />
this is we have been paying ourselves higher wages at a<br />
time when our income as a nation has been falling and we<br />
don't have to be economists to see the consequences of<br />
that. While our export earnings have fallen,' real<br />
average weekly earnings have risen over the last two<br />
years by $ 22. The damage to our competitiveness caused<br />
by high wage settlements has been compounded by much<br />
more moderate wage settlements overseas, where 5% and 6%<br />
increases have not been uncommon, compared to increases<br />
of between 15% and 20% in Australia when shorter working<br />
hours are taken into account.<br />
Against this background of world recession and high<br />
domestic wage settlements, it is not surprising that<br />
activity levels are being reduced in Australia, that<br />
employment growth has diminished, and that unemployment<br />
is rising. In the face of these difficulties it is<br />
essential that we maintain responsible and constructive<br />
economic policies and that we do not allow the nation to<br />
fall into the grip of a socialist Government.<br />
The recent national conference of the ALP has reminded<br />
us all of the dangers of a Labor Government, you only<br />
have to look at their specific policies to see what they<br />
would do t~ o Australia. Labour now has a new uranium<br />
policy which a number of people are saying is more </p>
<p>-4-<br />
moderate. How can they say that when the ALP leader,<br />
Mr Hayden, said a week ago that any sugccestion that<br />
Labor had abandoned its opposition to uranium mining was<br />
a " travesty of the facts"? He added that Labor's<br />
policy unEquivocally supports the objective of an end to<br />
the uranium industry. For years Labor has wanted to<br />
shut the uranium industry down. Nowhere does Labor's<br />
policy say that existing contracts can be worked out.<br />
Mr Hogg, who was responsible for amending Labor's<br />
uranium policy has said that he does not think the<br />
conditions laid down in the policy can be met by uranium<br />
miners " arid that will be a problem for the miners, not<br />
for the Government". If Labor had an opportunity to<br />
shut the . ndustry down it would do it. Thousands of<br />
jobs would be lost, and about $ 4 billion would be lost<br />
in export revenue. That sort of economic<br />
irrespons-''. ili-ty is so typical of the Labor party.<br />
In the debate on the uranium industry the Deputy Premier<br />
of NSW freely admitted that Labor's uranium policy and<br />
its other economic policies would undermine<br />
international confidence in Australia, he said that<br />
Labor's policies would lose us our triple rating and<br />
he boasted that they ought to. He wants socialism,<br />
regardless of the cost.<br />
You will have noticed the debate in the ALP on capital.<br />
gains tax. The new policy commits Labor to the<br />
strengthening of section 26( a) of the income amendment<br />
act, whatever that may mean. Senator Evans, who drafted<br />
the Labor policy, has given us an answer. He has a<br />
secret draft of a re-written section 26( a). We are<br />
entitled -to believe that will be a capital gains tax by<br />
stealth. The ALP has clearly covered up its real policy<br />
because it knows it will be unacceptable to the<br />
electorate.<br />
As Queenslanders, you will be concerned to learn of<br />
Labor's plan to introduce a resources tax. We are, not<br />
told what that tax will be, and Mr Willis, the Shadow<br />
Treasurer has said that the tax would be discussed with<br />
business once they got into government. Those who<br />
depend on the mining indus try for their livelihood, as<br />
many Queen-slanders do, would certainly be taking a great<br />
risk if they gave any support to the ALP with such a<br />
policy. Labor claims its resources tax would be offset<br />
by getting rid of state taxes on mining. Would anyone<br />
seriously believe that your Treasurer Liew Edwards would<br />
give up a state tax for the dubious pleasure of allowing<br />
the introduction of a Commonwealth tax? What is certain<br />
is that the mining industry would end up with both<br />
taxes. </p>
<p>At a time of economic downturn when the growth in<br />
investment:-is stagnating, Labor's finance spokesman has<br />
said that Labor would remove investment allowances, they<br />
would take away the tax concessions for the film<br />
industry, which has done so much for Australia's world<br />
image, and they would abolish drought relief<br />
measures, and they obviously want to abolish the<br />
nitrogenous fertiliser and superphosphate subsidies.<br />
Labor is committed to a prices and incomes policy and a<br />
social wage, whatever that may mean. It is undefined, a<br />
minefield of confusion, and key unionists have made it<br />
plain they would only support the policy under<br />
conditions which no responsible government could agree<br />
to. So-called prices and incomes policies have been<br />
tried aga-; and again in various countries since the<br />
war. They have never worked because they do not address<br />
the real causes of economic malaise.<br />
These ar e just some examples of the socialism that Labor<br />
would clearly impose on Australians. Labor is committed<br />
to " the redistribution of income, wealth and economic<br />
power", to increased public sector investment, to an<br />
expansion of public enterprise, to an expanded<br />
interventionist role by government. There is no<br />
commitment: in any of this to private enterprise, no<br />
belief in the importance of the individual because<br />
socialism believes in neither, socialism has a<br />
completely false view of what motivates people.<br />
Australians don't want socialism and never have done.<br />
But then the Labor . party has no faith in Australia, our<br />
way of life, and our institutions. The Labor party<br />
doesn't like our flag according to a resolution passed<br />
at the last. national conference, yet that flag is a<br />
symbol of national unity and countless Australians have<br />
a passionate belief in it. Dr Evatt, a former Labor<br />
leader, described the flag as " the most beautiful flag<br />
in the world". Many people would share that view. The<br />
Labor Party doesn't like the monarchy according to a<br />
resolution passed at the conference before last. It is<br />
committed to turning Australia into a republic.<br />
The Labor party doesn't * like the constitution and wants<br />
a new one for 1988. What could be more divisive than<br />
that. The Labor Party doesn't like the Senate which it<br />
would, in effect, emasculate. The Labor Party doesn't<br />
like the states, it is committed to a centralist policy<br />
which means more and more decisions would be made in<br />
Canberra. Furthermore, the Labor Party is a party hopelessly split<br />
into factions. Senator Gietzelt has compared the<br />
current factionalism with that of the 1950' s which split </p>
<p>the ALP and it is the socialist left faction which is<br />
predominart Mr Hayden owes hi~ s re-election to the<br />
support of the left, to the support of Mr Halfpenny and<br />
Mr Carmichael of the a union whose policies<br />
would tear down the fabric of Australian society. No<br />
leader has; been so obligated, so captive, so committed<br />
to left wing groups. He will now owe them a great<br />
debt and the narrowness of his victory means that to<br />
remain there Mr Hayden cannot afford to make the left<br />
unhappy. Liberalisri has a vastly different view of the way ahead<br />
for Australia. It is vital for Australians to realise<br />
more fully how important it is to work together. We<br />
need to understand to a much greater extent that as<br />
Australians we have complementary interests. That is<br />
particularly true in industrial relations, where we must<br />
take every opportunity to establish a more co-operative<br />
climate. Some days ago a task force, which included<br />
representatives of the the seagoing maritime<br />
unions, and the Australian shipowners, signed a proposal<br />
based on the Crawford Report into the Australian<br />
shipping industry, designed to improve industrial<br />
relations in the shipping industry, and to allow<br />
Australian ships to compete on similar terms with flag<br />
carriers of Australia's~ major trading partners. This<br />
report, which will now be considered by the<br />
Government, provides an example of what can be achieved<br />
when unions, management and governments are willing to<br />
co-operate, willing to work together.<br />
The effects of disputes at Australian ports, in<br />
particular our coal loading ports, is a lesson of what<br />
can happen if we do not co-operate with one another. We<br />
are not being seen as a reliable supplier of coal by the<br />
Japanese and the South Koreans because our ports are so<br />
often in a state of disruption. Now that is partly<br />
because not enough has been invested in infrastructure.<br />
But it is also because industrial relations have been so<br />
bad. For the first time in many years, Queensland coal<br />
industry employees accepted a wage package without<br />
industrial action, and this is a hopeful sign of a<br />
better industrial climate.<br />
The problems of coal deliveries are very real to<br />
Queenslariders although the problems in N. S. W. are<br />
considerably worse. The Commonwealth Government is<br />
working with the governments of Queensland and New South<br />
Wales on the difficulties of the coal industry including<br />
the probl. ems at ports. These problems are now too<br />
serious t~ o start apportioning blame. We must sit down<br />
together and find solutions. </p>
<p>The Trioartite Conference between the A. C. TAJ., C. A. T.,<br />
and the Government a couple of weeks ago was another<br />
' example of the co-operative spirit that is needed. All<br />
parties at that conference recognised that we need to<br />
work together because we have common interests. There<br />
was a measure of agreement about the economic problems<br />
facing Australia. A tripartite working party will try<br />
to reach agreement on a common statement on the economy<br />
to the wage case hearing in August. Clearly, with<br />
resolve, the C. A. I. and the Government can<br />
work togE-ther. This is only a start, but it is a basis<br />
on which to help build a better industrial climate.<br />
The Government itself is also well aware of the need to<br />
pursue pcolicies which will help minimise the impact of<br />
global rEcession on the Australian economy and to ensure<br />
that whert the world economic recovery does come we are<br />
in a position to take advantage of it. We must tailor<br />
our specific policies to assist those who need help<br />
most. We did this with the housing package, whose impact is<br />
only now beginning to be felt. From this month, recent<br />
first home buyers can claim up to $ 700 a year more<br />
than $ 13 a week as a tax rebate to offset the cost of<br />
interest on their home loans. And the new home deposit<br />
assistance scheme is now operating, helping people belo~ w<br />
a certain level of income to put together the deposit on<br />
that important first home. There is a new tax rebate on<br />
health fund contributions. To encourage people to<br />
insure themselves, the Government will pay back almost a<br />
third of the basic medical and/ or hospital contribution.<br />
Through -policies and programs of this kind, the<br />
Government is responding to the needs of the average<br />
Australian, and doing so in a way which helps people to<br />
take initiatives of their own and to improve their<br />
circumstances for their own and their families'<br />
benefits. Tomorrow I will be announcing the Government's response<br />
to the major I. A. C reports on general reductions in<br />
protection, export incentives, and budgetary assistance<br />
to industrv. The decisions we have made are going to be<br />
greatly important for all Australian industries.<br />
Australia can also make its voice heard internationally.<br />
Earlier this year the Government proposed a three point<br />
t / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
plan for regenerating world trade. The value of these<br />
proposals has been widely recognised, and they will<br />
receive closer examination at the G. A. T. T. Ministerial<br />
Meeting later in the year. I believe that if countries<br />
adopted these proposals together, they would provide a<br />
real impetus for regenerating global growth, and<br />
bringing down inflation. They could help enormously in<br />
getting us back to the situation of the 1950' s and<br />
1960' s when world trade was a major engine of economic<br />
growth, years in which the volume of world trade<br />
expanded at an annual rate of providing increased<br />
employment, and leading to growth rates which could<br />
double real incomes every 20 years or less.<br />
It is these sorts of policies, not socialism, which will<br />
help to build up living standards around the world, and<br />
create a better future for our children. </p>
