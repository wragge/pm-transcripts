Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that clean-up and recovery grants of up to $15,000 will be provided to communities in New South Wales inundated by recent floods.</p>
<p>Eligible primary producers and small businesses in the local government areas (LGAs) of Moree, Narrabri and Gwydir will have access to grants of up to $15,000.</p>
<p>The grants will be jointly funded by the Australian and NSW governments under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>This is in addition to the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) of $1000 per adult and $400 per child that will be made available through Centrelink to people who have been impacted by flooding in those areas.</p>
<p>The grants recognise the important role that small businesses and primary producers play in delivering services and supporting community recovery following a disaster.</p>
<p>The Australian Government continues to work closely with the NSW Government to deliver assistance to flood affected communities.</p>
<p>More information about disaster grants and assistance, including advice on how to apply, is available from the Disaster Assist website at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.  </p>
