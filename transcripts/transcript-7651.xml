TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITHl JOHN SNOW, ITN TVLONDON<br />
20 JUNE 1989<br />
E &amp; O0EPROOF<br />
SNOWz No-one imagined that Hong Kong would be a<br />
particularly high priority on anyone's agenda, but it is<br />
certainly for the British Government and China, for youyou<br />
have a certain number of dissidents in your Embassy in<br />
Beijing. Do you sense at all that the West is already a bit<br />
inclined to go back on its horror and just get back onto<br />
working terms with the Chinese?<br />
PM: No, its not correctly put, as simply as that. I<br />
believe that and I base this on discussions I have already<br />
had in Paris, and assessments that I am getting from other<br />
parts of the world that what the West is saying is that we<br />
in no way qualify the expressions of abhorrence and<br />
repugnance at what happened on the 4th of June and what is<br />
continuing in terms of creating an atmosphere and the<br />
practice of repression. But there is a view, which I share,<br />
that it would be an act of irresponsibility to the people of<br />
China as well as to the people of the region and the rest of<br />
the world if we were to act simply in a way which would<br />
drive China inwards upon itself. Therefore we have to walk,<br />
in my judgement, this careful line between leaving no<br />
impression with the leadership of China other than that we<br />
totally reject and repudiate what they have done and what<br />
they are doing. But at the same time leaving them with the<br />
knowledge that what the world wants to see is a continuation<br />
of economic reform within China. Now we can't have that<br />
wish that economic reform continue, and adjure from an<br />
involvement in the processes of economic reform. It is my<br />
judgement that economic reform must inevitably carry with it<br />
in some point in the future significant political reform.<br />
That wasn something that was fully understood by my friend<br />
Zhoa Ziyang, with whom I've had lengthy discussions on these<br />
issues going back over several years. And so we, as I say,<br />
have that fine line to walk. It will require delicate<br />
judgement, responsible judgement. I think, as I understand<br />
it, that view that I've expressed will be the view of the<br />
West. </p>
<p>SNOW: You sense then that.... of the Japanese will come<br />
with you in that?<br />
PM; I haven't yet had the opportunity of talking to the<br />
leadership in Japan. I think that they will not,<br />
significantly at least, want to move out of kilter with what<br />
the West will be doing. They of course have significant<br />
economic interests but I don't think it would be in the<br />
interests of Japan to get out in front and take what might<br />
been seen an opportunistic position. I hope that the sort<br />
of balance of considerations that I have outlined will be<br />
the ones which will guide all the nations that have already<br />
interests in any of China.<br />
SNOW: In practical terms, I mean we've already got the West<br />
saying no arms supplies, no sale. But for example if<br />
they came to you wanting grain, would you sell it?<br />
PM: We've got arrangements with them, not only in the area<br />
of grain, but we have existing agreements covering many<br />
sectors of their economy and particularly in areas which<br />
involve the welfare -and they obviously involve the welfare<br />
of ordinary people -grain they can't feed themselves, yet<br />
then it would seem to me that they should be fed it<br />
requires a balance, it requires that where we do continue to<br />
try and involve ourselves in their processes of reform, that<br />
they be in no doubt at all about what we say as to what<br />
they've done politically and where they should go<br />
politically.. SNOW: Now obviously what this has turned up, for the<br />
British Government in particular, is the problem of Hong<br />
Kong and the right to eventual abode here in Britain should<br />
the worst ever happen. Is there any way in which you can<br />
help in this? Do you think that perhaps at the next<br />
commonwealth Prime ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur it<br />
would be possible, say, to offer a Commonwealth position<br />
where perhaps a number of countries would come forward<br />
offering rights of abode?<br />
PM: i think we all have some responsibilities in these<br />
areas. We of course are able to speak on this issue with<br />
the cleanest of hands. If you look at the question of the<br />
settlement of refugees from Vietnam, on a per capita basis<br />
Australia has the best record in the world. We've accepted<br />
a 118,000 refugees from Vietnam since 1975, which I repeat,<br />
on a per capita basis is mare than anyone else including the<br />
United States. So we have exhibited a preparedness and a<br />
competence to accept responsibilities in this area. Of<br />
course, the major initial responsibility is with the United<br />
Kingdom. And I think others if the United Kingdom itself,<br />
particularly, adopts a properly compassionate role will<br />
not find itself without friends. </p>
<p>SNOW: Has it, in your view, adopted a properly<br />
compassionate role?<br />
PM: I don't think they've made their final decisions on<br />
this matter. I've only at this point had the opportunity of<br />
having the briefest of discussions when I was met at the<br />
airport by them with Sir Geoffrey Howe. I believe that your<br />
country is in the process of coming to its decision and it<br />
would be presumptuous for me at this stage, before those<br />
decisions have been made, to make judgements.<br />
SNOW: But Mrs Thatcher has made it pretty clear that we<br />
cannot be expected to offer all 3.25 million Hong Kong<br />
people the right of a vote.<br />
PM: I doubt very much whether you will be faced with a<br />
situation where the 3.25 million will be making that<br />
request. SNOW: can I ask you then about Kuala Lumpur?<br />
PM: Of course you can.<br />
SNOW: Clearly Hong Kong will be at issue there, but<br />
PM: I wish you wouldn't keep putting Hong Kong as the<br />
number one issue China is the number one issue, Hong Kong<br />
is a residual of China and so China will certainly be an<br />
issue.<br />
SNOW: Well China will be an issue, but of course the<br />
residual issue at the Commonwealth conference is almost<br />
eternally southern Africa. Do you see perhaps..<br />
PM: of course it isn'* t a residual issue -with respect, you<br />
haven't got it right again. South Africa -to the<br />
commonwealth it will never be a residual issue.<br />
SNOW: it's an eternal issue though isn't it?<br />
PM:. Yes, you said eternal, but then you said residual.<br />
SNOW: Either way, an issue. It is going to be South<br />
Africa. Do you think that with the changes in the<br />
leadership in South Africa with the demise of the<br />
Botha government that we're possibly moving into a new era<br />
of unease, maybe we'll even find a greater unity inside the<br />
a unity that may even include Mrs Thatcher? </p>
<p>PM: Let me say this John, I certainly hope that with the<br />
new leadership there that there will be a more responsive<br />
attitude than has been reflected in the intransigent<br />
position that Botha and those around him exhibited. But one<br />
of the great tragedies is where the Commonwealth held out<br />
its hand through the eminent persons group, it was<br />
repudiated and I make the point about that because I don't<br />
think it's been properly understood. That initiative which<br />
was mine, and which was adopted by the Commonwealth, we were<br />
not seeking, as we've put it, to b ' ring South Africa to its<br />
knees, but to bring it to the negotiating table. No-one,<br />
particularly myself, sees any merit in sanctions for the<br />
sake of simply imposing sanctions an instrument to try and<br />
bring South Africa to the negotiating table. I think that<br />
what's happened, since we have in the last few years been<br />
concentrating on this issue, we are getting further evidence<br />
of the impact of the sanctions that have been imposed. The<br />
world by the Governor of the Federal Bank in South<br />
Africa has acknowledged the impact of the sanctions,<br />
particularly in the financial area. I would hope that the<br />
new leadership would firstly understand what we are about.<br />
And essentially what we are about is this as I say, to<br />
bring them to the table, not with a view to eliminating the<br />
white population, white investment, white enterprise in<br />
South Africa. The reality which must be grasped by the new<br />
leadership in South Africa is a simple one and an<br />
irrefutable one. It is that the leadership of the ONC is a<br />
front line status. That leadership still wants to see a<br />
democratic, racially free South Africa within which there is<br />
a continuing effective white presence and certainly<br />
continuing white economic presence because that South Africa<br />
of the future will be the richer if that white presence<br />
continues. But the danger that they are increasingly facing<br />
is this that the younger generation, the blacks. They are<br />
taking a much more militant, aggressive view. They are<br />
questioning their own fathers, their own leaders., saying<br />
" what are you doing". Now, South Africa must grasp this<br />
chance while it exists the attitude that we want you to be<br />
there, we want your presence, we want your involvement<br />
that's the real issue.<br />
SNOW: Let me ask you finally about how you see that meeting<br />
going ahead. You go there as a elder statesman, so does Mrs<br />
Thatcher. It's always said that you're one of the few<br />
people who manage to stand up to her in a meeting and get<br />
her to listen to a different point of view. Can you<br />
characterise how these sessions go and do you think that<br />
this one perhaps will be a less divisive one? </p>
<p>PM: These sessions you have to divide them. There are<br />
the public sessions and then there are the discussions<br />
that we have in the smaller groups. And certainly that's<br />
been true when we have dealt with the issue of South Africa<br />
going back to the Bahamas in 1985 and then to Vancouver in<br />
1987. In terms of the relations in particular with Margaret<br />
Thatcher, it has been quite true that we've had a different<br />
position. I don't question the integrity of Mrs Thatcher's<br />
abhorrence of apartheid. The difference-has been about<br />
means and I think that we have a position and Mrs Thatcher<br />
respects my integrity and intelligence on these issues and<br />
so I hope that in Kuala Lumpur that we will be able, again<br />
from the basis of a mutual respect for one another's<br />
integrity, to examine what's happened since we last met<br />
intelligently to appraise the impact of the action that has<br />
been taken not only by ourselves but by others, including<br />
the United States, and to assess the statements of the<br />
critically important meters within South Africa like the<br />
Reserve Bank and say now does that lead us to the conclusion<br />
that with the continuation or some adjustment of these<br />
pressure we may be able to bring the leadership of South<br />
Africa to the negotiating table. so I think that the<br />
relationship in this regard, particularly between Mrs<br />
Thatcher and myself is one, as I say, of intelligent,<br />
responsible people who share an abhorrence of apatheid and<br />
and what we need to try and get is a convergence on action.<br />
I think one of the things that is going to be significant in<br />
this respect is that in the United States, I think we have<br />
now a position where the administration there has got to<br />
have a closer working relationship with the Congress. we do<br />
have a Congress there which is inclined towards action and<br />
so we may get a greater degree of support from there. I<br />
hope we can develop a more positive attitude on the part of<br />
the Europeans and if we can do that then the Commonwealth<br />
and the rest of the world together should be able to, with<br />
some optimism and what we've got to understand when we<br />
talk about these things is if we look at the world at the<br />
latter part of 1989 and compare it to the world two years<br />
ago, there's been so much much change. There have been<br />
achievements that two. years ago wouldn't have been thought<br />
possible , Namibia, Angola, Afghanistan,<br />
Indo-China. So, we shouldn't go into these things<br />
with asense of pessimism that nothing can be changed.<br />
SNOW: Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
FN: Thank you John.<br />
