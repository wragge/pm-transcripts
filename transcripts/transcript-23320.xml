    <content><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I spoke to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to convey Australia's condolences on the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and offer our assistance with the search for the missing aircraft.</p>
<p>On behalf of Australia, I offered two RAAF P-3C maritime surveillance aircraft to help with the search for the missing aircraft.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Najib has accepted this offer.</p>
<p>
The first Orion will depart for the search area this evening from Darwin. A second P-3C will be dispatched as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The P-3C Orion is a long-range maritime surveillance aircraft ideally suited to this task.</p>
<p>On behalf of Australia, I again offer my deepest sympathies to the families of the passengers and crew on board the Malaysian Airlines flight.<br />
