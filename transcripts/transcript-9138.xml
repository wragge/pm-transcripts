TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MPR<br />
DOORSTOP, RICHMOND, TASMANIA<br />
26 FEBRUARY$ 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minster, does Mrs Kelly enjoy your unqualified support<br />
PM: I thought you were going to ask me about the things that really matter,<br />
like the success we had yesterday. The Commonwealth and the<br />
States together and one of the most, I think, far reaching decisions<br />
thatprobably this country has seen. That Is, to open up these great<br />
huge Government business enterprises like water and electricity to the<br />
same competitive Influences as the rest of the economy. And I am<br />
very pleased that yesterday was a demonstration of the fact that so<br />
much cooperation has been in evidence at the commonwealth heads<br />
of government meetings, because there is a view before each one, you<br />
know, there is going to be the general line that tends to be run in the<br />
media: " well there won't be any agreement here", but invariably there<br />
is. And we have now got a national rail corporation, a national training<br />
authority, Hilmer endorsed, so it was a very productive dlays work and<br />
can-I say that the Commonwealth Government was very happy at the<br />
outcome. it will mean a lot for consumers. I think that over time, as<br />
you can see with telephones, putting a competitor into Telecom has<br />
reduced telephone tariffs. This Is going to be just the same over time<br />
in these other big bulk trading commodities like electricity and water,<br />
which are not just Important to consumers, but of course, absolutely<br />
critical to business as we go on to become a more competitive country.<br />
J: Are you talking about private power companies, private water<br />
companies eventually emerging?<br />
PM: Well, what we will see is a separation of power generation from<br />
distribution. So, you will have power stations tendering to provide their<br />
power. But instead of being locked up away from the Trade Practices<br />
Act and simply immune under state legislation they will be open to the<br />
same competitive influences as the rest of the private economy. </p>
<p>TEL: 26. Feb. 94 14: 22 No. 002 P. 02/ 04<br />

J: So, cheaper power, cheaper water?<br />
PM: It will end up cheaper power, cheaper power for consumers, cheaper<br />
power for business, whicI s I think especially critical given that we are<br />
sitting on a coal seam all the way down the East Coast of Australia.<br />
We have a great natural advantage in electricity, and of course, in<br />
water and the other products. So, it was a very far reaching decision.<br />
Now, we have got to put flesh on the bones of the decision, we have<br />
got to work it up to the next COAG Meeting, work up the<br />
Commonwealth legislation joIntly with the States, and State legislation.<br />
J: Jeff Kennett, though, is still saying that IR is the rock on which all<br />
this could fall.<br />
PM: Well that's a bit of ideology on the part of the Liberal Party. And what<br />
we say to them Is this In tact, they dropped their agenda item<br />
yesterday anyway the Government has now laid the foundations for a<br />
most flexible labour market. Any enterprising business can enter into a<br />
nw ind ustrial -relations agreement or anyone covered by a federal<br />
award can vary the award without recourse to a union. Now, all that<br />
really means is that it is up now to the employers to take these things<br />
up and run with them. But they will always take them up when these<br />
product markets are changing. I mean, if there is competition say<br />
with Telecom it meant that the Telecom management and workforce<br />
had to make the place more efficient. So, the labour market reform<br />
generally follows, or the labour market changes, generally follow the<br />
changes In the product markets. But you can't get the changes unless<br />
you do things like yesterday.<br />
SSo you can guarantee to business then, that the IR changes aren't<br />
going to mean two categories of citizens: the unions and the rest?<br />
PM: No; no. Because one of the rocks upon which this democracy of ours<br />
is built is the right of free association. But be that as it may, an<br />
employer under these changes can still make a new agreement with<br />
the employees without reference to a union, Now, really what the<br />
Liberals want are to cut peoples wages. And with profits as high as<br />
they are in the economy now, in the stock market and in business, the<br />
notion of going around and cutting people on $ 350.00 a week back is<br />
something this Government won't wear. So, when you hear Liberal<br />
Premiers talking abo -ut I R change~ sti is simply code for cutting back<br />
ordinary people on low income wages. Now, if profits were broken and<br />
the place had no prospects of growing these issues sort themselves<br />
out in a low growth economy. But profits are high, as high as any<br />
period in our history, and the stock market is back to where it was<br />
before the stock market crash of 1987. So, to go around now saying,<br />
" well look, we can only have change providing we can cut these little<br />
people back on $ 350 bucks a week", is not the change we need. It is </p>
<p>TEL: 26. Feb. 94 14: 22 No. 002 P. 03/ 04<br />

mean spirited, it is unnecessary. What we need are the big changes<br />
and it was the big changes we went after yesterday, and got.<br />
J: One of the problems is that there is so much political noise around as<br />
a result of Mrs Kelly and the -sport grants, the sort of good news you<br />
are giving us tdc-ay is getting lost.<br />
PM: Well I think it is up to you guys to put the right priority on things.<br />
Where is the weight? I mean, what happened yesterday will stick to<br />
the country for the next ten, twenty, thirty, forty years. These other<br />
little matters disappear within weeks. They are just one of the political<br />
dust storms that come through.<br />
J: Mrs Kelly and her problems seem to be sticking to the Government.<br />
PM: Well it is a matter of the weight. I mean, even the Liberal Party don't<br />
say there Is anything other than their lack of appreciation, let's put it<br />
that way, for Mrs Kelly's choices. That's what it boils down to. Well,<br />
tough for them.<br />
J: Do you think the jury is still out untill this committee report comes<br />
down?<br />
PM: Well we will see. We have got a committee and we have set it up, so<br />
there we are, we will wait and see what it says.<br />
J Kelly's future hinge on a positive response from that?<br />
PM: Well we will just wait and see what it says.<br />
J: Do you think Mrs Kelly the prospect of resigning during the week?<br />
PM: -Well we will wait and see what it says. And I will see her Monday.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the Government concerned about federal court action<br />
which could delay the start of Pay TV?<br />
PM: No, I mean, that is one out of the blue. I must say that is not one I<br />
have caught up with. I am quite sure in the hub-bub over Pay<br />
television, that is, In the jockeying, commercial jockeying of both the<br />
people who have got licences and the people who have got product,<br />
will see obviously quite a lot of huff ing and puffing in courts, but this is<br />
natural whenever you are going to see something which is virtually<br />
going to change the choices of Australian television viewers, there is<br />
always going to be competition for a thing like that.<br />
J: Is their any indication of Telecom being involved in that legal action? </p>
<p>TEL: 26. Feb. 94 14: 22 No. 002 P. 04/ 04<br />

PM: I have got no Idea, Telecom runs itself as a private business and it<br />
has got to look after itself.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you believe that Tasmanians have received the best<br />
value from the $ 312 million in Gordon below Franklin Dam<br />
compensation?<br />
PM: Well I don't think I am in a position to make a judgement about that.<br />
That is up to the State Government, they have got to be accountable to<br />
the Tasmanian electorate, for the expenditure of very valuable dollars<br />
from the Commonwealth. These are things which will come once, they<br />
won't come again, and no doubt the opposition here will make clear<br />
what it thinks are the valuable decisions and what are not.<br />
J: A senior Tasmanian economist has said that it is a wonder that the<br />
Federal Government doesn't try and retrieve the funds. Is that an<br />
option?<br />
PM; I have never seen that remark at all. But can I just say about<br />
Tasmania generally. I think it is worth reporting that Tasmania has<br />
picked up the competitive breezes in Australia. This morning I was at<br />
a fish canning plant which is exporting. Not so many months ago I was<br />
in Ulverstone at a potato factory, which Is exporting, Pacific Dunlop's<br />
Potato Plant, and so the agriculture industries of Tasmania, particularly<br />
small industries with small growers, are picking up product and<br />
exporting it around the world. So, in a sense Tasmania is becoming a<br />
bit of a model for the rest of the country in seeing the opportunities of<br />
the new competitiveness of Australia and the Innovation which can<br />
come from sensible management and good relations between product<br />
suppliers and the workforce. And again, here in Richmond, I mean the<br />
restoration of an important colonial town, one which adds a lot of<br />
tourist lustre to this part of Tasmania, and one which is, of course,<br />
helping keep the economy of Tasmania moving. So, tourism, niche<br />
markets, food markets, but building on Australia's huge<br />
competitiveness and exports of the kind we saw this morning is the<br />
way for Australia, and I think In some of these industries Tasmania is<br />
actually leading the way.<br />
J have you heard anything about the Hobart Aquatic Centre..?<br />
PM: No, I haven't.<br />
