    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australian businesses are taking advantage of the Rudd Government's $100 million Apprentice Kickstart bonus, with over 14,000 apprentices signed up before the initiative is set to end on 28 February 2010.</p>
<p>Apprentice commencements have taken off in February, with 4317 eligible Kickstart apprentices being signed up in the last two weeks alone.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Minister for Employment Participation Mark Arbib today encouraged businesses to make sure they don't miss out on the extra $3,350 on offer.</p>
<p>Under Kickstart, the Rudd Government has more than tripled the commencement bonus for employers in the first year, from $1500 to $4850.</p>
<p>Employers receive $2350 when they employ a 15 to 19 year-old apprentice in an eligible trade and then receive a further $2500 after the apprentice completes nine months.</p>
<p>The Kickstart bonus is available to employers of apprentices in the fields that have been hardest hit by skills shortages - identified on the National Skills Needs List.</p>
<p>These include butchers, bakers, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, electrical trades and hairdressing.</p>
<p>The bonus is available until 28 February 2010 and aims to sign up 21,000 young apprentices.</p>
<p>Member for Ballarat, Catherine King welcomed the figures, saying that Ballarat-based businesses had taken on over 100 Kickstart apprentices since the start of the initiative.</p>
<p>Apprentice Kickstart is providing a down-payment on the skills Australia needs as well as helping to tackle youth unemployment.</p>
<p>The economic downturn particularly hurt apprenticeships, with commencements dropping by about 10,000 in the past year. This bonus will fast-forward hiring decisions - to bring apprentice numbers back up to the levels before the global recession.</p>
