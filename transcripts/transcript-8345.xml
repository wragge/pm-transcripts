" CHANGE IS NOT OPTIONAL"<br />
AN ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
JOHN CURTIN MEMORIAL LECTURE<br />
CURTIN UNIVERSITY<br />
PERTH 5 OCTOBER 1991<br />
Mr Vice-Chancellor, distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. When I last had the honour of delivering the John Curtin<br />
Memorial Lecture in September 1983 I said that there<br />
were certain rare occasions in a lifetime which were bound,<br />
by their associations, to be especially moving and<br />
memorable. Tonight, how much more deeply must those emotions be felt<br />
not only by me personally, but by all of us here who have a<br />
sense of history at a time when we celebrate the fiftieth<br />
anniversary of the formation of the Curtin Labor Government,<br />
and celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the formation of<br />
the Australian Labor Party and do so in the University<br />
which bears his name.<br />
We celebrate these key events in Australia's history in a<br />
year in which all our perceptions of human history must<br />
surely be heightened and sharpened under the impact of the<br />
extraordinary events now unfolding before us.<br />
When we consider the events of those two years, 1941 and<br />
1991, bridging fifty of the most terrible and tumultuous<br />
years in human history; and when we consider their impact on<br />
Australia and the world, it is impossible, at least for<br />
anyone of my generation, not to feel a sense of excitement,<br />
exhilaration even, tinged with a sense of awe, and<br />
impossible not to feel, above all, a sense of liberation and<br />
hope for the opportunities and challenges which these events<br />
hold for the future.<br />
But for those of us of the Australian Labor Party, there is<br />
something uniquely satisfying in commemorating both the<br />
centenary of our party, and the advent of the great Curtin<br />
Government fifty years ago, in this pivotal year of 1991. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I use the word " uniquely" in its precise and correct sense.<br />
For I make two assertions:<br />
First, no political party in the world has had its course<br />
shaped more profoundly, more directly by the impact of the<br />
landmark events in world history since 1914 with 1941 the<br />
watershed year, and 1991 a year of culmination.<br />
And second, no political party expresses more fully, in its<br />
own history, and in the history of a single nation, the<br />
struggle for, and the triumph of, the fundamental principle<br />
which lies at the heart of the meaning of 1991 for so many<br />
peoples around the world today the commitment to elective<br />
democracy. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
These are large claims. Yet I believe that the study of<br />
Labor's history justifies them from the first commitment<br />
made by the Australian trade unions to parliamentary<br />
democracy one hundred years ago; and, within the framework<br />
of that commitment, the development of the Platform,<br />
objectives and structures of the Party, under the impact of<br />
World War One, the Russian Revolution, the Great Depression,<br />
the rise of Nazidom, the outbreak of the Second World War,<br />
Hitler's invasion of Russia, Pearl Harbour, the Fall of<br />
Singapore, the Revolution in China, the Korean War, Vietnam<br />
and the pervasiveness of the impact of the Cold War. I<br />
believe that the study of the Party's history warrants the<br />
assertion that the Australian Labor Party has been uniquely<br />
shaped by its response to these crucial world events.<br />
At the same time, this international dimension to Labor's<br />
development make all the more remarkable its central<br />
achievement: that it remains the authentic Australian<br />
political institution, that institution which, above all<br />
others, reflects and expresses the Australian character and<br />
the Australian way of democracy.<br />
From that perspective, we can see that the truly remarkable<br />
fact about the Labor Party's history is not its turbulence,<br />
or its failures and we have had our share; not its<br />
inconsistencies and no organisation as complex and diverse<br />
as ours could exist without them in abundance. What stands<br />
out is the Labor Party's capacity for change and renewal in<br />
a world of immiense change, throughout a century of<br />
unprecedented change; and yet, at the same time, the<br />
consistency with which it has held to the fundamental<br />
principle: the pursuit of its program through parliamentary<br />
democracy. That capacity has been the key to its strength.<br />
Even more, it has been the key to the strength of the<br />
Australian democracy itself.<br />
Never was that capacity so vital for Australia literally<br />
" vital", for it was a matter of the nation's life as in<br />
the critical year of 1941. </p>
<p>3.<br />
And no Australian has, in his own life and career, more<br />
thoroughly embodied that capacity for change than John<br />
Curtin. Given this association, given our remembrance of this man<br />
Curtin, this man for the times, who led the nation through<br />
times of immense change, my theme tonight virtually sets<br />
itself. It could scarcely be other than the theme of change, in our<br />
own times of immeasurable change, and the challenges it<br />
brings unavoidably in its wake.<br />
I put these propositions:<br />
In the world in which we now live, change is not<br />
optional. Refusal to change has not been an option for Australia,<br />
for the Australian economy, for the Australian<br />
Government, or for the Australian Labor Party.<br />
It is not optional for Australia, as it seeks its<br />
proper place in our region and the world, and as it<br />
transforms itself into an internationally competitive<br />
economy. It is not optional for the Australian Government, given<br />
its duty of leadership towards the achievement of these<br />
goals. And it is not optional for the Australian Labor Party,<br />
in its determination to maintain its historic role as<br />
the powerhouse for change in this nation.<br />
It has always been the fact, but never more true than now,<br />
that there are only two choices:<br />
either we make change ourselves or have changes<br />
imposed on us by the rest of the world;<br />
either to achieve change ourselves, by ourselves,<br />
setting our own objectives and using our own<br />
methods, or have change thrust upon us.<br />
Could there ever have been any doubt which choice this<br />
Australian Labor Government would make?<br />
So I illustrate my theme of change, and support my<br />
propositions about change, by reference to Curtin's own<br />
career. The remarkable events which brought the Curtin Government to<br />
power on 7 October 1941 represented one of the dramatic<br />
points of climax in Australian political and parliamentary<br />
history. </p>
<p>But for Curtin himself, 7 October represented the end of a<br />
long period of preparation, not only personal preparation,<br />
but a long hard struggle to prepare the Labor Party to take<br />
charge of Australia in war-time.<br />
It is difficult now to convey the immensity of the task,<br />
because it involved profound and sometimes heart-breaking<br />
changes of attitudes in the nation itself, in the Labor<br />
Party, and, not least, in his own attitudes.<br />
This last factor is one of the keys to Curtin's greatness:<br />
his capacity to change, even when change involved his own<br />
deepest feelings, if he believed the change was essential to<br />
the future of the Labor Party or the safety of the nation.<br />
He demonstrated this capacity time and again in 1931, in<br />
1937, in 1940, in 1941, and,' for him, most wrenching of all,<br />
in 1942, when he exhausted himself to achieve Labor's<br />
historic reversal of its attitude against conscription in<br />
war-time.<br />
In 1931, for example, he had taken the leading role, as a<br />
Western Australian delegate to the Federal Conference, in<br />
expelling the Lang forces in New South Wales for their<br />
sabotage of the Scullin Government and their opposition to<br />
the Premiers Plan. He accepted this duty, even though he<br />
was as trenchant a critic of the Premiers Plan as a means of<br />
dealing with the Great Depression as Jack Lang or anybody<br />
else. By 1937, he had become absolutely convinced that the<br />
international situation, in both Europe and the Pacific,<br />
demanded that the Labor Party abandon the isolationist,<br />
neo-pacifist, position it had taken in the wake of the<br />
horrors of the First World War, and the conscription split<br />
of 1916. This was Curtin's theme at Conference after<br />
Conference, especially in New South Wales, where the fight<br />
for Labor unity and the fight for Australia's security<br />
became, for him, an indivisible cause and commitment.<br />
Curtin made a landmark speech in the House of<br />
Representatives on Australian defence during the Estimates<br />
debate on 5 November 1936. Its theme was: " A greater<br />
degree of self-reliance in Australia's defence is<br />
essential". Three years before the outbreak of war in<br />
Europe and five years before Pearl Harbour, his speech was<br />
uncannily accurate as a prediction of the situation in which<br />
Australia was to find itself. But the point I make here is<br />
that the speech demonstrated Curtin's capacity to run<br />
against prevailing orthodoxies, including Labor orthodoxies.<br />
He told the House of Representatives: " The dependence of<br />
Australia upon the competence, let alone the readiness, of<br />
British statesmen to send forces to our aid is too dangerous<br />
a hazard upon which to found Australia's defence policy."<br />
The UAP Member for Barton, Mr Albert Lane, interjected:<br />
" Great Britain has never failed us." </p>
<p>Curtin replied: " History has had no experience of the<br />
situation I am visualising."<br />
Albert Lane again interjected: " It is all imagination."<br />
Curtin: " No, it represents a reasonable examination of the<br />
possibilities of the situation. Great wars in which<br />
Australia's security is to be imperilled would not be<br />
European wars. They will be wars in the South Pacific."<br />
It has to be remembered that, in 1936, the attitude implicit<br />
in Albert Lane's interjections represented the dominant<br />
Australian attitude, and not just on the part of the<br />
conservative Establishment. The more significant,<br />
therefore, and for most of his hearers, the more unsettling,<br />
was Curtin's declaration:<br />
We should look upon the people of the United States of<br />
America, our neighbour across the Pacific Ocean, with a<br />
degree of fraternity, disregarding altogether the<br />
direct trade relations which their circumstances and<br />
ours have produced, as men and women who speak our<br />
language and who are of the same common origin. We<br />
should not be engaged in saying, as apparently we have<br />
been saying in the past, that we do not care a dump for<br />
them and in making difficulties for them.<br />
How novel, how radical such sentiments were in the Australia<br />
of 1936 can be measured by the fact that even at the end of<br />
1941, after Pearl Harbour, Curtin's famous call to the<br />
United States, " without any inhibitions of any kind.... free<br />
of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the<br />
United Kingdom" could raise angry criticism in Australia and<br />
deep resentment in London.<br />
But the central message of Curtin's speech in November 1936<br />
was directed towards the Labor Party. It was the signal for<br />
the beginning of an immense change from the basically<br />
pacifist and decidedly isolationist attitudes which<br />
dominated the Party at all levels, as a result of the<br />
Conscription Split and the human tragedy of the 1914-18 War.<br />
But to achieve that change called for all Curtin's powers of<br />
persuasion and perseverance.<br />
Even as late as Easter 1940, when the Nazi-Soviet Non-<br />
Aggression Pact had produced the Fourth Partition of Poland,<br />
the rape of Finland and the Soviet annexation of Latvia,<br />
Lithuania and Estonia, this sentiment was strong enough to<br />
produce from the New South Wales Annual Conference the<br />
notorious " Hands Of f Russia" resolution, which declared that<br />
" the Australian people have nothing to gain from a<br />
continuance of this war". </p>
<p>But after the fall of France in June 1940, with Hitler's<br />
full might poised against Britain, the combined Labor<br />
leadership political and union reaffirmed its total<br />
support for the war effort, short of forming a national<br />
government under Menzies.<br />
Curtin defended his co-operation with Menzies: " We are<br />
opposed to the Government of the country, not to the country<br />
it governs. We did not win the 1937 election, so we had to<br />
do our best to see that the country had requisite defences."<br />
Curtin staked his future on a speech to a meeting of 150<br />
union delegates at the Sydney Trades Hall in 8 August 1940:<br />
" You and I are faced wi th an early judgement by<br />
the electors. I merely ask for unity The job<br />
is sticky and getting harder. It would be<br />
cowardly for me to slide out."<br />
The heart of Curtin's speech was his summary of his attitude<br />
to the war in Europe and Australia's place in it:<br />
" The Nazis in Germany decimated the trade unions.<br />
Fascism in Italy began with foul murders and with<br />
the thrusting of castor oil down the throats of<br />
trade unionists. Those two philosophies are now<br />
in alliance against everything that Labor in Great<br />
Britain and the Dominions stands for. I remind<br />
you that almost the only places in the world in<br />
which a Labor minority can raise its head and be<br />
articulate today are Australia and Great<br />
Britain.... I refuse to allow Australia to be a<br />
prey to Nazism and Fascism."<br />
Menzies called the elections for 21 September 1940. The<br />
results were a remarkable vindication for Curtin, but he<br />
nearly paid a disastrous personal price for party unity.<br />
Neglecting his own seat of Fremantle for the sake of his<br />
national responsibilities, he was saved by a handful of<br />
votes from our soldiers in North Africa.<br />
But the election result rendered Menzies dependent on the<br />
votes of two Victorian independents. This was the<br />
Parliament which a year later, in October 1941, was to<br />
create and sustain the Curtin wartime Government until<br />
Labor's landslide victory of 1943.<br />
Australia's growing danger throughout 1941 intensified the<br />
pressures on Menzies not from Labor, but from the<br />
Coalition. " I was surrounded", Menzies was later to say,<br />
" by doubtful supporters and appalling halfwits". As Paul<br />
Hasluck, another great Western Australian, wrote in his<br />
masterwork The Government and the People 1939-41: </p>
<p>" The United Australia Party itself had been<br />
disintegrating for at least three years past. The<br />
internal loyalty of the party had been damaged by<br />
a variety of causes and party discipline weakened<br />
over a long period of time, while the party had<br />
accumulated within itself the poison of personal<br />
disappointments and animosities. Far from binding<br />
the party more tightly together, the coming of the<br />
war had removed the opportunities it might<br />
otherwise have had for internal reconstruction."<br />
The contrast with Curtin's leadership could not have been<br />
greater.<br />
Menzies resigned on 29 August 1941 and the Leader of the<br />
Country Party, Arthur Fadden, was installed in the Prime<br />
Ministership. The Fadden Government lasted 40 days.<br />
Fadden himself used to say: " Like Noah's flood, I reigned<br />
for 40 days and 40 nights". So I suppose Menzies could have<br />
said, appropriately enough: " Apres moi, le deluge".<br />
During the debate on the Budget on 3 October, the two<br />
Independents, Coles and Wilson, convinced that the Coalition<br />
was incapable of leading Australia in war-time, voted with<br />
Labor to bring down the Fadden Government and make Curtin<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
Curtin pledged: " We will carry on the war wholeheartedly<br />
and with no inhibitions of any sort or description."<br />
The rest is history Pearl Harbour; the forging of the<br />
American-Australian Alliance and the Curtin-Macarthur<br />
partnership; the fall of Singapore; the struggle of will<br />
with Churchill to bring the Australian divisions home from<br />
the Middle East and prevent their diversion to Burma;<br />
Curtin's lonely vigil while our best troops made the<br />
perilous crossing of the Indian Ocean; the sweeping<br />
victories of the Japanese forces; the mobilisation of<br />
civilian and industrial Australia; the searing debate in the<br />
Labor Party over conscription; then from the end of 1942,<br />
after one year in office, the long slow turning of the tide<br />
of war.<br />
I have said on many occasions that the most important truth<br />
of all about Curtin and Curtin's leadership, was that even<br />
in the darkest and most demanding days of the war, he never<br />
lost sight of Labor's peacetime objectives at home and<br />
abroad.<br />
But he based his vision on a world and nation undergoing<br />
enormous change. </p>
<p>Internationally, Curtin recognised the fundamental changes<br />
which had occurred in the balance of forces in the world and<br />
in Australia's strategic situation. one of his greatest<br />
achievements was to forge the relationship with the United<br />
States, which all subsequent governments have seen as a<br />
keystone of Australia's security.<br />
Envisioning the post-war reconstruction of Australia, he<br />
foresaw the need for basic change in attitudes, in the<br />
nation itself, and in the Labor Movement.<br />
In the last years of the War in the last years of his life<br />
he began the preparation for change to peace, just as in<br />
1936, he had begun preparing the Labor Party for war.<br />
He summed up his approach at the Federal Labor Conference in<br />
Canberra in November 1943:<br />
" I have said that the world can never be the same in<br />
the years to come as it was before the war.<br />
Australia's capacity to govern involves adaptability to<br />
resolve new problems and meet new conditions. What<br />
was good 20 years ago may not be good enough now."<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I use that quotation and the approach it represents as a<br />
bridge between the challenges facing Australia 50 years ago,<br />
and Curtin's response, on one hand, and, on the other, the<br />
challenges we face now and the response we need to make<br />
today. And today, more than ever, in adapting to new<br />
problems and conditions, what may have been good enough<br />
twenty years ago is almost certainly not good enough now.<br />
And I repeat my main theme: either we change ourselves or<br />
have changes imposed on us by the rest of the world.<br />
The first thing is for us all to realise that this tough,<br />
increasingly competitive world of five and a half billion<br />
people does not owe, and will not give, seventeen million<br />
Australians an easy prosperity. The days of our being able<br />
to hitch a free ride in a world clamouring, and prepared to<br />
pay high prices, for our rural and mineral products, are<br />
behind us. From this fact flows everything else.<br />
The challenge for the foreseeable future, is to produce more<br />
than we spend. The rest of the world will not allow us to<br />
continue indefinitely to live beyond our means by borrowing<br />
from them.<br />
Our rural and mineral products will remain important into<br />
the future. But the challenge is to add to them. That is,<br />
we must export more manufactured goods and services and<br />
substitute more quality Australian production for imports.<br />
The challenge is therefore to make the decisions and adopt<br />
the practices and attitudes which will enable this and<br />
succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals. </p>
<p>Those are the challenges. How we are prepared together to<br />
meet them will determine the standards we can enjoy and the<br />
kind of Australia we will pass on to our children.<br />
And so in that context, I want to deal with the main area of<br />
change where, as a Government and as a Party, we have<br />
adopted policies which of necessity involved new approaches,<br />
new responses, new attitudes and, in key areas, sharp<br />
departures from old orthodoxies. That is the area of<br />
economic management, in the widest meaning of that term.<br />
In 1983, we inherited an economy in recession. The early<br />
years of this Government were therefore naturally dominated<br />
by the need to restore growth and reduce unemployment. The<br />
goals for which we had received so convincing a mandate in<br />
March 1983 were national reconciliation, national recovery<br />
and national reconstruction. The National Economic Summit<br />
of April 1983, and the First Accord laid the foundations for<br />
their fulfilment. The change in industrial attitudes from<br />
confrontation to cooperation took priority on our agenda.<br />
The pressing need for fundamental changes in other areas of<br />
economic management policy was not then so sharply apparent.<br />
But, during those first years of Government, the signs<br />
emerged: sharp falls in the value of the Australian dollar,<br />
a worsening current account deficit and the associated<br />
build-up of foreign debt. By the middle of the 1980s, the<br />
need for fundamental and lasting change in the very<br />
structure of the Australian economy had become overwhelming.<br />
As our Government moved to respond, it became clear that<br />
Australia had reached a fork in the road: down one track<br />
lay great challenges, coupled with the prospect of renewed<br />
vigour in our economy; down the other, an apparently easier<br />
ride, but one that would have seen a permanent fall in<br />
living standards, not only relative to our traditional<br />
standards of comparison in Europe, but relative to our<br />
rapidly growing neighbours in Asia.<br />
There was only one choice for a Government committed to<br />
bettering the lot of the Australian people, and in<br />
particular, its working men and women and their families.<br />
And we made that choice. We embarked on a program of reform<br />
and restructuring unprecedented in Australia's history.<br />
But even in our first year, there was one great change that<br />
we made to breach the walls of orthodoxy one that marked<br />
the first step on the long road towards opening up the<br />
Australian economy. It was our decision, in December 1983,<br />
to float the dollar. </p>
<p>In March, as soon as we assumed office, we had had to deal<br />
immediately with an exchange rate crisis. The problems of<br />
speculation against the fixed rate of the dollar recurred<br />
later in the year. It was clear that those episodes would<br />
continually recur and would severely limit our capacity to<br />
achieve policy objectives. Accordingly, we took the<br />
decision, in company with many other developed economies, to<br />
float our currency and free our institutions to trade with<br />
minimal interference on international financial markets.<br />
This decision broke a long tradition of a fixed exchange<br />
rate, against sterling, and against the US dollar and, most<br />
recently, against a basket of other currencies. It was<br />
controversial. It was resisted and criticised in many<br />
quarters. Many saw it as ma ' king Australia hostage to the<br />
vagaries of the financial markets.<br />
But it was a decision that was as unavoidable as it was<br />
correct. The international currency speculators had<br />
regularly demonstrated their capacity to make profits by<br />
building pressure against the rate the Reserve Bank was<br />
defending. We made the difficult judgment that this longestablished,<br />
purported sheet anchor of a fixed rate, had, in<br />
fact, become a major source of instability and an<br />
unacceptable limitation on policy flexibility.<br />
That judgment has proved correct. Our ability to manage our<br />
external situation to provide the time necessary to achieve<br />
essential structural reform, while maintaining reasonable<br />
employment growth derives from the closer integration of<br />
Australia with international capital markets that floating<br />
our currency made possible.<br />
No wise government would be reckless about predicting the<br />
future in regard to the levels of Australia's overseas debt.<br />
However, stabilising it as a ratio of GDP has been one of<br />
our central policy objectives. Nor would I want to argue,<br />
in the face of the clear facts, that all this borrowing has<br />
been prudent. But in the midst of the more hysterical<br />
commentary, it is easy to lose sight of the substantial<br />
build-up of Australian equity overseas and restructuring at<br />
home that this borrowing has financed.<br />
This year's Budget forecasts foreshadow a stabilising of the<br />
ratio of this debt to GDP a landmark in the continuing<br />
process of adjustment in which we are engaged, and an<br />
enormous set-back for the prophets of doom.<br />
But, returning to my central theme of change, let me go back<br />
to the crisis of the middle of the 1980s, and I use that<br />
dramatic and perhaps overused word ' crisis' with<br />
deliberation. For the questions that confronted us then, as<br />
the dollar fell and the current account deficit rose both,<br />
apparently, without limit were fundamentally questions of<br />
national confidence: could Australia survive, compete and<br />
prosper in this rapidly changing world? </p>
<p>11.<br />
We were determined that Australia's answer would be Yka.<br />
But we realised that it would require a root-and-branch reexamination<br />
of many, long-standing features of our national<br />
life, and of the assumptions underpinning them.<br />
The results of this re-examination have been far-reaching<br />
and are by no means complete.<br />
But let me mention three examples: the role of the public<br />
sector; policies towards industry; and the wages system<br />
Our first task was to institute a thorough review of the use<br />
Australians were making of our national resources. This was<br />
the essence of our response.<br />
As a Government, this exercise would not have been credible,<br />
had we not begun with the public sector.<br />
We worked throughout the remaining years of the 1980s to<br />
eliminate the public sector deficit. In doing so, we<br />
demonstrated that traditional Labor objectives could be<br />
achieved, within a balanced budget framework, by a carefully<br />
designed combination of targeted assistance and increased<br />
equity in the tax system. This break with the conventional<br />
wisdom that a balanced budget, or even worse yet, as the<br />
post-war orthodoxy had it, a surplus, could only be achieved<br />
at the expense of traditional Labor values, was resisted in<br />
some quarters. But the break with old orthodoxy was<br />
crucial. Reductions in Government's call on national<br />
savings have a direct impact on the current account,<br />
allowing a much higher level of domestic investment for a<br />
given deficit.<br />
We also looked at the stock of publicly owned assets. In<br />
many areas, the pattern of public ownership was longestablished<br />
and the reasons for it long since overtaken by<br />
developments in the economy. It has been critically<br />
important that we be prepared to acknowledge the<br />
anachronisms in many areas of public ownership, both to give<br />
Government necessary budgetary flexibility and to improve<br />
the performance of the companies and the sectors of the<br />
economy in which they operate.<br />
I believe the recent Commonwealth Bank float demonstrates<br />
the benefits this reappraisal has brought. It has been<br />
extremely successful with many Australian workers welcoming<br />
the opportunity to invest directly in one of our great<br />
national institutions, while the Bank itself has been<br />
strengthened by its excellent reception on the share market.<br />
In our policies towards industry, the change has been no<br />
less dramatic. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Tariff protection had been one of the abiding features of<br />
the Australian economy since Federation. It had become an<br />
article of faith. Tariffs protected Australian industry by<br />
making foreign goods more expensive here; and the supposed<br />
virtues of this protection became deeply embedded in the<br />
very psyche of the nation.<br />
Right from the start, this Government deliberately and<br />
determinedly set about pulling down the tariff walls. By<br />
1992, our existing programs will have slashed the nominal<br />
rate of assistance to the manufacturing sector by over onethird,<br />
from 13 to 8 per cent, and the effective rate from 22<br />
to 12 per cent.<br />
We have not done this, as some would have you believe,<br />
because we have been converted, to paraphrase Keynes, to the<br />
views of some long-defunct economist. We have done this<br />
because we believe that the facts of Australian economic<br />
history clearly support two fundamental propositions.<br />
First, that industries protected by tariffs do not develop<br />
and become internationally competitive, but rather become<br />
isolated and fall further behind world standards, creating a<br />
demand for even higher tariffs. Second, that tariffs burden<br />
our export industries, reducing their competitiveness and,<br />
by inflating costs, make the development of new export<br />
industries more difficult.<br />
In short, tariffs reduce the capacity of the Australian<br />
economy to advance living standards.<br />
Now, of course, that process of change, one of the most<br />
radical changes in our nation's history, has involved<br />
dismantling some of our most cherished orthodoxies, held for<br />
generations by much of industry employers as much as<br />
unions. But we are convinced that the tariff walls are an<br />
obstruction against achieving the fundamental objectives of<br />
a Labor Government. So we are removing them.<br />
At the same time, we have seen immense changes in our wages<br />
system, both in retrospect and in prospect.<br />
In retrospect, the great change in the industrial wing of<br />
the Labor movement can be seen as pivotal. Wide acceptance<br />
within the movement of the proposition that workers'<br />
interests can, in appropriate circumstances, be better<br />
safeguarded by cooperation than by confrontation has<br />
underpinned much of our success. In many industries, the<br />
union movement has not merely facilitated change it has<br />
set the agenda. On training and re-training and in<br />
reforming awards to make them relevant to contemporary<br />
industrial conditions, the union movement has been in the<br />
vanguard. </p>
<p>13.<br />
And now, with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission<br />
in the midst of its critical review of the National Wage<br />
Case principles, we confront the prospect of perhaps the<br />
greatest changes in our wages system we have seen. The<br />
sharply increased emphasis on workplace bargaining against<br />
demonstrated productivity benchmarks will fundamentally<br />
alter industrial relations in Australia. One indication of<br />
the extent of this change has been the questioning by the<br />
Commission itself the foundation stone of the wages system<br />
of its own future role.<br />
Those who may have believed, in 1983, that its attachment to<br />
the trade union movement would be a millstone around the<br />
neck of the new Labor Government have been utterly<br />
confounded. Confounded, because the industrial wing of our<br />
great movement has shown the courage that Curtin showed in<br />
changing and adapting, in spite of the pain and the<br />
difficulty, to further the fundamental objectives, both of<br />
the Party and of the nation he loved so deeply and served so<br />
splendidly. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
This Labor Government has never been in doubt about the kind<br />
of Australia we wish to build an Australia with a modern,<br />
diversified, competitive and export-oriented economy; an<br />
Australia vigorously engaged with the world economy, and<br />
enmeshed in particular with the dynamism of Asia and the<br />
Pacific; an Australia committed to maintaining and enhancing<br />
the quality of life, social justice and the preservation of<br />
our natural environment; a self-reliant Australia, not<br />
merely fitting in with the world as we find it, but helping<br />
to shape it and capable of taking on the best the world has<br />
to offer and winning.<br />
This process of modernisation, of adaptation to the changing<br />
world economy, is not something that has some future cut-off<br />
point. It must be a continuing process.<br />
There is no point at which we can say change and reform have<br />
finished because there is no point at which the world will<br />
stop changing.<br />
And this is the essential point. We live in a world of<br />
unprecedented, indeed breathtaking, change. And, of course,<br />
the profound interest and excitement of the events in Europe<br />
should not distract us from the central fact of our future:<br />
that our own region is a crucible for change. We can no<br />
longer afford the easy simplicities, the costly<br />
complacencies of the fifties and sixties and seventies. I<br />
say " costly" because we are now paying the price for the<br />
neglect of those decades. Our task now is to make sure that<br />
future generations are not called upon to pay a similar<br />
price for any neglect or complacency on our part, in this<br />
make-or-break decade. </p>
<p>14.<br />
I put one last proposition and I put it in all earnestness<br />
to every member of the Australian Labor Party, especially<br />
those who are disposed to criticise our program of change<br />
and reform as representing some kind of unwarranted or<br />
unauthorised departure from Labor principles and tradition.<br />
Of course, harsher language is sometimes used, not<br />
altogether unlike that used against Curtin during the<br />
Conscription debate in 1942 and which actually brought him<br />
to the point of offering his resignation to Caucus: the<br />
charge that he would end up by leading from the other side.<br />
I ask such critics today just to consider this:<br />
Suppose Australia had not had the great good fortune to have<br />
had a Labor Government for the past eight and a half years,<br />
through the choice of the people in four successive<br />
elections. And suppose that Labor Government had not<br />
accepted the need for change, and forced the pace of change.<br />
And, thinking this proposition through if Labor, which<br />
would then have been reduced to long opposition, had clung<br />
to old shibboleths and refused to change, in these years<br />
which, in the very heartland of international communism,<br />
have culminated in the shattering of the shibboleths of<br />
seventy-five years, and the shuddering collapse of central<br />
command planning what would then have been the situation?<br />
I say this: the Australian Labor Party would have run the<br />
very real risk of being doomed, not just to permanent<br />
opposition, but to permanent irrelevance and impotence.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Earlier, I quoted part of John Curtin's speech to the<br />
Federal Labor Conference, in November 1943, in which he<br />
emphasised the need for change in our national habits and<br />
attitudes, and way of thinking about things and our way of<br />
doing things. John Curtin had no doubt how that was to be<br />
achieved. He had no doubt that the Australian Labor Party<br />
alone had the capacity to change itself and thereby change<br />
the nation. He concluded his speech to Federal Conference<br />
in November 1943:<br />
The Labor Party has a great tradition in organising<br />
co-operation for the welfare of the mass of the people.<br />
It is peculiarly fitted by knowledge, experience, and<br />
the confidence of the people, to lead them towards the<br />
wider horizons of co-operation now appearing before<br />
mankind. If the Labor Party is to maintain its place<br />
in the vanguard of the march of human progress, it must<br />
not fail to do its part in this momentous opportunity<br />
to bring nearer to achievement the fellowship and<br />
welfare of all peace-loving peoples.<br />
That was John Curtin's declaration of faith in Labor's<br />
historic role. His words ring down five decades, and never<br />
with greater resonance than today. </p>
