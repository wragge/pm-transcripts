    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS 15 SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
Several months ago I was asked by one of the earlier<br />
trustees to have lunch before the Rugby League Grand Final<br />
and watch the game. I accepted that invitation.<br />
It now appears that that has involved Mrs Hills, wife<br />
of the Chairman of the Trustees, foregoing her seat at<br />
the lunch.<br />
As a result, I have sent the following telegram to Mr Hills<br />
because I would not dream of displacing Mrs Hills or anyone<br />
else at the lunch:<br />
" I understand from press reports that your kind invitation<br />
for me to have lunch with you before the Grand Final<br />
tomorrow involves your wife giving up her seat.<br />
" I would like to thank you very much for your courtesy<br />
but I would not dream for one moment of displacing<br />
Mrs Hills, or anyone else, on what must be Sydney's<br />
most exciting day of Rugby.<br />
" Therefore, I must decline your invitation, but I would hope<br />
to have the privilege of lunching with the Trust on<br />
some future occasion before a League game."<br />
However, since I understand my Parliamentary Gold Pass entitles<br />
me to attend the Match and since I had arranged to be in Sydney<br />
specifically for the Match, I am intending to go with one of<br />
my colleagues, and I look forward to seeing the game. </p>
