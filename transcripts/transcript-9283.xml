SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESENTATION OF CHEQUE FOR WET TROPICS TREE PLANTING<br />
SCHEME AND OPENING OF THE KAMERUNGA ENVIRONMENTAL PARK<br />
CAIRNS, WEDNESDAY, 20 JULY 1994<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Its a pleasure to be here today in such a beautiful location to demonstrate my<br />
Government's support for such a worthwhile shceme as the Wet Tropics tree<br />
Planting Scheme and to officially open one of the fruits of the scheme's<br />
labour, the Kamerunga Environmental Park.<br />
As many of you will know, the Wet Tropics Tree Planting Scheme has been<br />
operating successfully since 1989 when it was established as part of The Wet<br />
Tropics Structural Adjustment Package. Commonwealth funding for the<br />
scheme has totalled some $ 6.3 million. When you consider the benefits both<br />
in terms of the employment generated and the environmental improvements,<br />
to my way of thinking, that has been money well spent.<br />
To date the scheme has operated successfully in four shires, Hinchinbrook,<br />
Eacham, Douglas and Mulgrave. Through the development of infrastructure,<br />
ii~ luding f6ur nurseries', and expertise in nursery operations and tree<br />
planting, the scheme has done a superb job in reducing soil erosion,<br />
improving water quality and replacing lost rainforest habitat. These<br />
achievements are a credit to the commitment and energy of all those who<br />
have participated in the scheme.<br />
But the scheme will not stop there. Like any dynamic program, the scheme is<br />
experiencing exciting changes, changes that will see the scheme restructured<br />
into a community-based employment company, providing training and work<br />
experience opportunities for long-term unemployed people.<br />
I have to say that the scheme's track record in environmental repair and<br />
management and the enormous amount of expertise that it has developed<br />
gives me great confidence in its ability to provide on-the-job training and'<br />
supervision as part of the Commonwealth's Labour Market programs </p>
<p>especially the regional environment employment program announced as part<br />
of the announcing the White Paper on employment.<br />
I also have great confidence in its ability to operate independently of<br />
recurrent Commonwealth funding from the 1996-97 financial year.<br />
As an illustration of my Government's confidence in the scheme, I am here<br />
today to present the first instalment of a total of $ 3 million that the Federal<br />
Government has committed to assist the scheme in its transition to<br />
independence.<br />
As part of the new arrangements, the management of the Wet Tropics Tree<br />
Planting Scheme will be transferred to the North Queensland Afforestation<br />
Program joint board. This will see seven councils Thuringowa, Cardwell,<br />
Johnstone, Cook, Mareeba, Atherton and Herberton -join the original four<br />
participating shires to manage the scheme. The joint board is well placed to<br />
manage the scheme. It was established in 1992 specifically to pursue and<br />
coordinate tree planting throughout the region, for both environmental and<br />
commercial purposes.<br />
The board will now have responsibility for the future restructuring, operation<br />
and success of the scheme. The Government trusts that the new<br />
arrangements will see a continuation of the cooperative approach that has so<br />
far characterised the scheme's operations in employment, environmental<br />
successes and training.<br />
I'd like to congratulate all participating councils in the scheme for having<br />
taken such positive action in addressing the environmental challenges of your<br />
region and through this, doing so much for the region's unemployed. It would<br />
be difficult to find two more deserving activities than creating jobs and<br />
reversing environmental degradation.<br />
But as you all know I am not only here today to hand over a cheque. I am<br />
also here to officially open the Kamerunga Environmental Park, a perfect<br />
example of the kind of work being done by the Wet Tropics Tree Planting<br />
Scheme. This glorious 54 hectare park which you can see all around you,<br />
extends for more than 2 kilometres on both banks of the Barron River. It is<br />
here that the Mulgrave unit of the scheme joined forces with the Queensland<br />
National Parks and Wildlife Service and others to involve community groups<br />
in'preserving, restoring and reconstructing the naturally occurring vegetation<br />
along this part of the river.<br />
I've been told that when they first began work, the river foreshores were in a<br />
terrible state. Rubbish had to be removed, exotic plants controlled, noxious<br />
weeds removed and the area where sand had been mined, filled and levelled.<br />
Since that time, more than 30,000 trees have been planted to restore the<br />
river foreshore, and paths and picnic areas have been developed. </p>
<p>From what I have seen today, I can say that the original aims of the project<br />
providing a mixed forest demonstration plot and education site, enhancing the<br />
public amenity of the area, and improving the scenic value of the park<br />
have been well and truly met.<br />
The restructuring of the Wet Tropics Tree Planting Scheme will enable the<br />
valuable work of replacing lost rainforest habitats to continue. It will also<br />
provide opportunities for additional projects to be undertaken by local<br />
councils and other Commonwealth and State agencies, adding to the<br />
scheme's potential to create long term employment in the region.<br />
The scheme has built up a significant store of expertise and has become a<br />
very popular initiative. Restructuring now offers great potential for meeting<br />
environmental, labour market and industry development objectives in the<br />
region. In ' Working Nation' the Government spelt out its plans for providing<br />
support for the regional coordination of labour market initiatives. The Wet<br />
Tropics Tree Planting Scheme has the potential to be a model for other<br />
regions. I am very pleased to launch this new phase of the Wet Tropics Tree Planting<br />
Scheme and have great pleasure in handing over this cheque for 1/ 2 million<br />
to Mike Berwick, the chairman of the North Queensland Afforestation<br />
Program Joint Board.<br />
I am also very happy to declare the Kamerunga Environmental Park open. </p>
