PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 2 UUT17<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
Question: You said today you saw this draft for the first time today.<br />
When did you become aware of its existence?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I've been aware of the existence of a draft sometime ago,<br />
but I deliberately didn't see it.<br />
Question: Didn't you say this morning that you didn't know of such a<br />
draft? I'm sorry I haven't got the exact words...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I said I haven't seen any letter at any time.<br />
Question:<br />
Where does ( inaudible). Mr. Robinson actually wrote it?<br />
Where has it been said that Mr. Robinson wrote it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think the copy was destroyed and it was re-written from shorthand<br />
notes this morning.<br />
Question: Wasn't that how it was destroyed or by whom?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You would have to ask other people that because I never had<br />
a copy in my possession.<br />
Question: Isn't that splitting hairs a bit to say that you hadn't seen<br />
the draft?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I didn't say draft, I didn't see any letter at any time.<br />
and there never was a letter. Nothing was ever signed or<br />
sent. 21 AUGUST 1978 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question: What did you want it f or?<br />
Prime minister:<br />
Because I had always been puzzled as to why Eric Robinson<br />
had a very clear recollection of events of which I had<br />
absolutely none and what he said amongst Ministers, that<br />
what had been said in the office on the 17th, was the<br />
fact of the phone call, but not the substance, that would<br />
obviously give me an explanation in my own mind in relation<br />
to that, because if a Minister comes in and says he's had<br />
a talk with his Permanent Head, that's in no way remarkable.<br />
If he says he hasn't spoken to his Permanent Head for<br />
three months, that would be remarkable. In addition, a<br />
conversation can become remarkable because of its nature,<br />
its content or its motive and the full nature and content and<br />
the motive attributed to it by the Judge, later became<br />
apparent in relation to that particular conversation, a very<br />
( inaudible) much later time. At the most it could have<br />
resulted in one or two sentences additional to my statement<br />
in Parliament. Nothing else than that not altering the<br />
substance but offering as a possible explanation because<br />
I haven't challenged Eric's recollection, ( inaudible)<br />
my awareness of the matter was Senator Durack came to me<br />
about these matters with concern, . as Attorney-General, at a<br />
much later point.<br />
Question: In the statement that you put out today with the categoric<br />
denial, followed I believe talks with Ministerial colleagues<br />
today. Could this statement not have come out on the same<br />
day as the Bulletin last week which would have prevented the<br />
issue dragging on for three or four days?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It should have, but there is a certain principle of confidentiality<br />
of discussions between ministers and especially so if it<br />
involves in part discussion with a full Ministry, and I happen<br />
to regard that principle of confidentiality as one of very<br />
great importance to the proper workings of Government, but its<br />
over the weekend and discussion-with the Deputy Prime Minister<br />
and Eric Robinson and other Ministers that came to the view<br />
that that principle ought to be breached on this occasion.<br />
Question: If I could push the point there? Presumably your reservations<br />
about making public confidential talks in Ministerial meetings<br />
was raised with the Ministers today. Could not this meeting have<br />
taken place on the same day as the Bulletin was circulated.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
They were discussions.. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Question: Allegations have been very damaging, which have taken<br />
( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let's say you made allegations. Sometimes the judgement<br />
made in Canberra of what's happening in Australia is not<br />
the judgement made by people outside. I've made that<br />
point on a number of occasions. The judgements were made<br />
last week that the principle should not be breached at<br />
that time because it was also believed that the com ' ments,<br />
statements, made by Eric Robinson in the Parliament and<br />
by myself, answered the thrust and the intention of the<br />
Bulletin article, as I still believe they do and as I<br />
know Eric Robinson believes they do.<br />
Question: Why has it then been decided to breach the standing regulations<br />
as you might say, and put out the statement now. What has<br />
occured? Prime Minister:<br />
A continuation of public interest, or media interest, obviously.<br />
Question: It seems odd, looking at this, that Mr. Robinson, iuhose recollection<br />
of most these matters seems to be fairly clear, has produced,<br />
or seen to produce at this Ministerial meeting, a recollection<br />
which is fairly different from that qiven in his evidence.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think you ought--to look at his evidence.. in total. For example,<br />
there is one part in Page 1685 which I know is immediately<br />
followed by another, but one part that said I was only aware<br />
how the name came to be changed when Mr. Pearson gave his<br />
evidence, and the detail to the Royal Commission.<br />
Question: He says specifically that he was aware of the name change and<br />
he aware that Withers told you about the name change on<br />
January 17<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'm well aware of what's in the evidence but it was when certain<br />
matters were related to Ministers, which were very specific,<br />
it is the fact and not the substance that could have offered<br />
an explanation in my own mind as to why I had no recollection<br />
of it, and that's why I was interested in it. 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Question: Talking about the principle of confidentiality, when Mr. Howard<br />
moved to stop speculation on television licenses he<br />
breached a principle of not commenting at all on the Budget.<br />
Isn't that the same sort of principle?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think these .: two are exactly the same but<br />
making a comment on that was delayed a number of days also.<br />
Question: Do you think this sort of note either adds anything to<br />
the press, anything from Mr. Robinson's desk?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't want to comment on the note in relation to the<br />
evidence. I've said on a number of occasions that I accept<br />
Eric Robinson's evidence in relation to that ( inaudible).<br />
Question: Why did... ( inaudible) send it to you on the day that he<br />
did it? Does it not suggest that after re-reading it,<br />
he decided that at least ( inaudible) were in conflict with<br />
the evidence?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think you'd have to ask him that. It was suggested at<br />
the time, and as far as I know suggested before anything<br />
was drafted, that the evidence ought to be checked; the<br />
transcript ought to be checked, and I certainly concurred<br />
with that very much so.<br />
Question: You have no knowledge of why it was not sent to you by<br />
Mr. Robinson?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, he made a decision not to send it to me. One reason<br />
why, it had been said that he should check and I think its<br />
also known that he checked the generality of this with his<br />
legal advisers. But he was advised that he should check<br />
against the transcript and I concurred and certainly agreed<br />
with that. I don't think there was any question of anything<br />
being drafted and signed forthwith.<br />
Question: Were you there when he drafted this first version? </p>
<p>Prime minister:<br />
I was in the same building, I certainly wasn't in the<br />
I wasn't in the room with him, and I didn't know what<br />
he was dictating obviously.<br />
Question: You categorically denied that you requested Mr. Robinson<br />
to cast doubts on his evidence. Can you deny the entire<br />
Bulletin article?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think that the only element of the Bulletin article which<br />
carried credibility is that there was a note. But I think<br />
the purpose, the intent, and the thrust of it, is totally<br />
and absolutely distorted and made so grotesque that it bears<br />
no relationship to the original, to the facts of the<br />
matter. Question: Isn't there a very real risk, in asking anyone. to ( inaudible)<br />
whether they are sure of their recollection, that you are<br />
inviting people to cast doubt on that recollection. It's<br />
just a fact of life ( inaudible). Are you sure of your<br />
recollection. Isn't there a danger of that being construed<br />
as an attempt, as a request, to change that recollection?<br />
Prime minister:<br />
It was a question in relation to that of recollection on<br />
the 7th or 8th. If you're sure of what you're saying now,<br />
not of what was said in relation to the evidence of the<br />
Royal Commission.<br />
Question: Mr. Robinson volunteered this ( inaudible)?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, the records show that he raised the subject.<br />
Question: At a full Ministry meeting? Right and when did you talk<br />
about... Prime Minister:<br />
No, he raised the subject of his evidence and the nature of<br />
of what was said on the 17th. He raised that. There was no<br />
question about it at alT until after he had raised it.<br />
( end tape).<br />
( Rest of interview from SMH draft) / 6 </p>
<p>THIS SECTION OF TRANSCRIPT FROM THE S. M. H.<br />
6.<br />
QUESTION<br />
And later, not at that full meeting, but later you spoke to him<br />
about the possibility of a note?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It was either at that meeting, or at a meeting of five, six<br />
or seven people. There were no bilateral conversations on the<br />
point at all.<br />
QUESTION Just one point if I may. The transcript of Eric Robinson's<br />
evidence page 1731 says: the question was: But I thought<br />
you said that Senator Withers raised the change of name.<br />
Answer: yes. What did he say about that? Answer: He informed<br />
the Prime Minister in my presence of his role in the change of<br />
name. Doesn't that cut across the draft of the letter where he is not<br />
aware of the specific content of the telephone call?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
But hten he spoke to Mr Pearson read the next line<br />
that he had spoken to Mr Pearson. You've got to read it in<br />
total. QUESTION That evidence there on page 1731 appears to cut across the<br />
last paragraph in the draft letter.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well, I'm not commenting on that because I didn't draft either<br />
of them. / 7 </p>
<p>( TAKEN FROM SMH TRANSCRIPT) -7-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued):<br />
Again, if you go to page 1685 referring to the statement:<br />
" I was only aware how the name came to be changed when<br />
Mr. Pearson gave his evidence in detail to this Royal<br />
Commission". Question: He appears to contradict himself.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
But if you take the question and answer immediately after<br />
that.... . there are a number of points.. page 1687 " 1 don't<br />
recall any detail other than that Senator withers in my<br />
presence told the Prime Minister of his phone call with<br />
Mr. Pearson. I don't recall anything else."<br />
Question: This apparent conflict in Eric Robinson's evidence is why<br />
you wanted it checked, I gather?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, I said before I was alwasy puzzled why he had such a<br />
clear recollection when I had none. But I don't challenge<br />
this recollection. I made the point that it was only the<br />
fact of the call and not the substance, or its nature, or<br />
its purpose, or its-motive, it's not remarkable.<br />
Question:<br />
What I mean is the point you just made about before he<br />
drafted the letter, he was advised to check the transcript.<br />
This is why you wanted it checked, presumably?-<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Obviously, It wasn't related to drafting. It was obviously<br />
before anything was signed that it had to be done.<br />
Question: who suggested that-somebody else?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Somebody else suggested it and I concurred. In fact everyone<br />
who was present concurred. </p>
<p>( Taken from SMH Transcript) -8-<br />
Question:<br />
Why, Mr. Fraser, did you ask Mr. Robinson if he was sure of<br />
his recollection to write you a note when he had already<br />
given evidence before a Royal Commission.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I was referring to the recollection as he was relating to<br />
ministers at that time. I've already indicated my interest in<br />
the matter that if it was conversation of substance I would<br />
have expected to remember it. As I have no recollection of it<br />
it was merely a Minister referring to a phone call, a<br />
Minister to a Permanent Head, that's most unremarkable.<br />
I made the point earlier, it's much more remarkable if a<br />
Minister comes in and says he hasn't been speaking...<br />
Question: It appears that Mr. Robinson in his evidence said that he was<br />
aware of Senator Withers' involvement in the name change<br />
which seems to imply that he was aware of the nature<br />
and substance of that phone call.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, I can only go back and suggest you read the totality<br />
of the evidence. I can't answer questions about somebody<br />
else's evidence.<br />
Question: If you did not leamnthen from Mr. Robinson what was the<br />
substance of the phone call by Senator Withers, did Senator<br />
Withers himself tell you that he had made the call.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I've got no recollection, as I said in Parliament, of this. I<br />
became aware of this matter when Senator Durack brought it to<br />
my attention in April. When he brought it to my attention he<br />
was concerned in his own mind in relation to it. I've got a<br />
clear recollection of the time and the circumstances of that.<br />
Question: When were you first aware of the conflict of Mr. Robinson's<br />
evidence, because there does seem . to be a pretty clear conflict<br />
between page 1731 and page 1685.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
To the extent that there is or isn't when I first read it. But<br />
I'm not commenting on the evidence in terms of substance. The<br />
evidence is there and I don't seek and I never have, to challenge<br />
it or to quibble with it any sense, shape or form.<br />
