FOR PRESS 10 OCTOBER, 1978<br />
DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL<br />
Mr. Speaker, as all Honourable Members will know the death<br />
occurred on 29 September, 1978 of his Holiness Pope John Pal.<br />
I move" that the House notes the death on 29 September, 1978<br />
of his Holiness Pooe John Paul, and expresses its profound<br />
regret at his passing."<br />
It was with deep shock that we heard eleven days ago of the<br />
death of Pope John Paul. Elected to the Papacy on 26 August,<br />
his reign was tragically brief no Pontiff in modern times<br />
had so short a tenure. In that lies a very human tragedy, : hat<br />
of a man chosen for his Church's highest office but who al.; st<br />
in the same hour was taken from it. Yet, even in such a<br />
short time, Pope John Paul had been able to make a strong<br />
impression, winning widespread affection .; ith his simple,<br />
self-effacing style.<br />
Pope John Paul . was ordained in 1935, and he thereafter rose<br />
to Bishop, Archbishop, Cardinal and finally Pope. During<br />
this period he displayed a capacity for reasonableness<br />
and moderation. He also eschewed ostentation and much of<br />
the pomp and ceremony of ecclesiastical office.<br />
On being elected Pope, he chose to have a simple ceremony,<br />
for his installation, in St. Peter's Square.<br />
Pope John Paul's entire ecclesiastical life was spent in<br />
Northern Italy but his was no narrow experience. As Archbishop<br />
of Venice his Diocese included not only this historic and<br />
beautiful city, but also the highly industrialised area<br />
of Mestre.<br />
One of his strengths which was undoubtedly a factor in his being<br />
chosen to succeed Pope Paul VI was his involvement in past. ral<br />
work, including the daily round of visits to the sick, to<br />
schools, factories and seminaries.<br />
Another factor ray have been his outgoing warmheartedness.<br />
Pope John Paul combined an unassuming manner with infectic<br />
good humour. Although Pope John Paul had' displayed an att~ chment<br />
to orthodoxy, he was prepared to travel down the road of reform ope<br />
by the second Vaican Council.<br />
He showed deep concern for the poor and the under-privileged.<br />
He saw the need for social change and sy7 boiised this by his<br />
own personal actions. / 2<br />

<p>-2-<br />
He was a man of decision tempered by good-humoured tolerance,<br />
a man of austerity but with considerable personal charm, a<br />
literate man but one able to communicate simply and<br />
directly to all peoples. His untimely death will be a<br />
loss to both his Church and to mankind.<br />
