    <content><![CDATA[<p>A further $50 million and about 280 jobs will flow to the Hunter region</p>
<p> as a result of the decision I announced today to base the Airborne</p>
<p> Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft Australia is acquiring</p>
<p> at RAAF Williamtown. It is the main operating and training base for</p>
<p> RAAF air defence units, including the FA-18 squadrons.</p>
<p>The Government announced project approval in December 1997 and included</p>
<p> provision for six or seven aircraft (depending on final source selection)</p>
<p> and associated support systems and facilities.</p>
<p>Basing of the AEW&amp;C aircraft at RAAF Williamtown will mean significant</p>
<p> opportunities for local business in the Hunter region. The Government</p>
<p> anticipates expenditure of approximately $50 million on new infrastructure,</p>
<p> such as facilities and taxiways at RAAF Williamtown. A significant</p>
<p> proportion of the logistics support activities will be undertaken</p>
<p> by civilian contractors. Approximately 200 extra RAAF personnel and</p>
<p> 80 contractors will be at RAAF Williamtown to operate and maintain</p>
<p> the aircraft.</p>
<p>Combined with the decision announced in December 1997 to base the</p>
<p> new Lead-In-Fighter at RAAF Williamtown, the basing of AEW&amp;C aircraft</p>
<p> will boost hi-tech industry and employment in the Newcastle area.</p>
<p>Three teams, headed by US defence companies Boeing, Lockheed Martin</p>
<p> and Raytheon, are competing for the AEW&amp;C project. A final decision</p>
<p> on the system to be acquired will be made by mid-year. First aircraft</p>
<p> deliveries will probably be around 2004.</p>
<p> 15 April 1999</p>
