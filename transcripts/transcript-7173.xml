Jj AUSTRALIA~ g<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 MAY 1987<br />
I am pleased to announce there will be three Royal Visits in 1988<br />
to Australia as part of our Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh have accepted my invitation.<br />
on behalf of the Government and people of Australia to visit for<br />
approximately three weeks in late April and early may. The tour<br />
is expected to include visits to western Australia, Tasmania,<br />
Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT.<br />
Her Majesty has kindly agreed to perform the opening ceremony at<br />
the new Parliament House in Canberra during her visit as well as<br />
opening World Expo ' 88 in Brisbane on 30 April.<br />
In addition tc The Queen's visit, visits by the The Prince and<br />
Princess of Wales and The Duke and Duchess of York are also<br />
planned. The Prince and Princess of Wales will be in Australia in late<br />
January and early February and highlights of their visit will be<br />
the Australia Day celebrations and the International wool Cloth<br />
of the Year Awards and Fashion Show in Sydney.<br />
I expect that it will be possible for The Queen, The Duke of<br />
Edinburgh and The Prince and Princess of Wales between them to<br />
visit all States and Territories during their visits.'<br />
Possible dates for the visit by The Duke and Duchess of York are<br />
mid-September to early October. The Duke of York, as The Queen's<br />
personal representative, will be the Reviewing officer at the<br />
International Naval Review in Sydney on 1 October 1988.<br />
1988 will be a landmark in the history of Australia and our<br />
Bicentenary will be celebrated by Australians in all States and<br />
Territories with a year-long program of festive and commemorative<br />
events. It is especially appropriate that our Royal Visitors share in<br />
these celebrations and I know I speak for all Australians when I<br />
say that they will be given an especially warm and sincere<br />
welcome. I </p>
