Following the appointment of the third Howard ministry, I have decided on a number of changes in senior appointments.<br />
Having received a report from the secretary of my department, as required by legislation, I propose to make a number of new appointments of departmental secretaries.  A list of secretaries is attached.  All changes will take effect from 18 January 2002 and appointment terms will vary from three to five years.<br />
I welcome all secretaries to their new positions.  Mr Mark Paterson, currently the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will accept appointment as Secretary of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources.  Mr Paterson will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to that important position.  Ms Jane Halton, currently an Executive Co-ordinator in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, will become Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing.  Mr Mark Sullivan will take up the position of Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services<br />
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will be discussing with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer of the Commission to replace Mr Sullivan.<br />
In addition to the appointment of secretaries, I propose to recommend to   His Excellency the Governor-General in Council that he appoint Mr Andrew Podger as Public Service Commissioner for a period of three years.<br />
Mr Steve Sedgwick, currently the Secretary of the Department of Education, Science and Training, will be appointed to a very senior position, details of which are being finalised and will be announced before 18 January 2002.<br />
Mr Russell Higgins has asked to be granted special leave from duty so that he can provide full-time care to his wife who is seriously ill.  Mr Higgins will be appointed to a new position of Associate Secretary in the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources in order to retain his services within the government. </p>
