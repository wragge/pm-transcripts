    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome the visit of Prince Harry to Australia next month.</p>
<p>Whilst Prince Harry visited Australia privately in his gap year in 2003, this will be his first official visit to Australia.</p>
<p>Australians have great warmth towards members of the royal family.</p>
<p>Members of the royal family have enjoyed being in Australia and that pleasure is amply reciprocated by the Australian people.</p>
<p>As a member of the armed forces, Prince Harry has continued a long tradition of duty and service. His work and advocacy for numerous charitable organisations has also been an important focus of his public life.</p>
<p>During his visit next month, Prince Harry will attend the International Fleet Review in Sydney to mark the centenary of the first entry of the Royal Australian Navyâs Fleet into Sydney.</p>
<p>Further details of the Princeâs visit will be released closer to the visit.</p>
<p>I look forward to joining Prince Harry during his time in Australia.</p>
<p>He will be an honoured visitor to our country and we look forward to welcoming him.</p>
<p>23 September 2013</p>
