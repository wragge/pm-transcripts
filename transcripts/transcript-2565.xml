FOR PRESS PM. No. 38/ 1972<br />
ADMISSION OF BANGLA. DESH TO THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon, CII, MP<br />
I am pleased that Bangladesh has joined the<br />
Commonwealth. Australian support for Bangladesh's membership<br />
was given publicly when we recognised Bangladesh in January.<br />
I am glad that it has now proved possible to complete<br />
successfully the necessary consultations w.% ith other members<br />
of the Commonwealth. One immediate result will be that our Ambassador<br />
in Dacca will become a High Commissioner and the embassy a<br />
High Commission. Bangladesh's first head of mission in<br />
Australia, who is expected to reach Canberra shortly, will<br />
also carry the title of High Commissioner from the outset.<br />
I have sent a message of congratulations to the<br />
Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur RahIman. The<br />
text of my message is as follows<br />
" On behalf of the Australian Government, I send<br />
you my warmest congratulations on Bangladesh's<br />
becoming a member of the Commonwealth. We shall<br />
welcome being joined by representatives of Bangladesh<br />
at future Commonwealth meetings. We look forward to<br />
mutually beneficial co-operation in the many diverse<br />
fields of activity for which the Commonwealth association<br />
provides."<br />
