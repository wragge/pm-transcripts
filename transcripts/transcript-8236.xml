TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE HON JOHN BROWN,<br />
RADIO 2UE 17 DECEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
BROWN: I've been joined in the studio by the Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, Bob Hawke. Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: G'day John.<br />
BROWN: Good to see you here.<br />
PM: Good to be here mate.<br />
BROWN: Looking hale and hearty.<br />
PM: Feeling well.<br />
BROWN: Golf handicap of 16.<br />
PM: Yes mate. Still prepared to try and get your money<br />
BROWN: You've been getting it too regularly mate. I'm a<br />
bit worried about this. I'll have to stop giving you<br />
lessons. Well you're now the longest-serving Labor Prime<br />
Minister and the second longest-serving Prime Minister in<br />
Australian history, second only to Sir Bob Menzies, having<br />
replaced Malcolm Fraser as the second longest-serving Prime<br />
Minister. You of course were brought up in Western<br />
Australia. You attended the Perth Modern School together<br />
with John Stone, Billy Snedden, Garrick Agnew and other<br />
luminaries ort the Australian scene. Your father was a<br />
Congregational minister and a chaplain through the war. And<br />
I guess to a great extent your view of our returned soldiers<br />
was fashioned by your experiences with your dad and the<br />
repat hospitals.<br />
PM: Yes, dad was an army chaplain, as you say. And then<br />
after the war he went back into the church and was parttime<br />
chaplainL at the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in<br />
Perth and thetn he became full-time chaplain there. He did<br />
that for over 20 years. So I got to know at first hand<br />
through dad, the concerns of the veterans themselves, but<br />
also the sense of obligation as a community we should have<br />
towards them. It became instilled into me very early.<br />
BROWN: Well one of the highlights of your Prime Ministry<br />
given that background must have been the trip to Gallipoli<br />
this year Prime Minister. </p>
<p>PM: It's impossible to describe John the impact that had on<br />
me and I think on everyone that went there. As soon as you<br />
see the place you realise the impossibility of the mission<br />
that was given the troops and the gallantry, the sheer<br />
heroism of them going in and staying there for that period<br />
of time. I actually went down and got into the trenches,<br />
walked along the trenches and I had the advantage of having<br />
a military bloke with me who's an historian in this area.<br />
You're just overwhelmed by the, as I say, the gallantry and<br />
the heroism. You could see why this did shape, it shaped<br />
the Australian nation. We'd only been one nation for<br />
years then. We'd just been previously these six battling<br />
colonies. We'd become one nation on January 1, 1901. This<br />
was what shaped a sense of Australia. I was just moved<br />
beyond measure by it.<br />
BROWN: I think we all had that feeling back here in<br />
Australia, listening to the radio reports, particularly<br />
those from Brian White, the late Brian White.<br />
PM: Yes, marvellous.<br />
BROWN: -this station of course. He was on that trip<br />
with you.<br />
PM: Yes, he was.<br />
BROWN: And also the television cover, as vague as it seemed<br />
to be in the morning light listening to those<br />
PM: One of the great things about that early morning<br />
service I think that touched me more than anything was you<br />
had already -there in place, they'd been there overnight,<br />
young Australian tourists, teenagers and 20 year olds.<br />
There they were, eager, and then up came these old veterans,<br />
the average age of over 90, just making their way up past<br />
these young Australians. The bonding that took place<br />
between them, the just outpouring of affection from the<br />
youngsters for the old veterans and the way which the<br />
veterans responded to them, it was like all the generations<br />
of this century coming together and recognising what the<br />
young owed to the old and the way in which the old were<br />
proud of the young. It was very moving.<br />
BROWN: They were a wonderful bunch of old diggers weren't<br />
they. They're all of them in their 90s and<br />
PM: Yes, amazing.<br />
BROWN: I think there's been a couple of them have died<br />
since. PM: Yes, there has been.<br />
BROWN: I mean when you think about blokes like Jack Ryan.<br />
PM: Jack Ryan is a remarkable fellow. </p>
<p>BROWN: He's the joie de vivre of the<br />
PM: Old flirt. He flirted with Hazel from the time he met<br />
her. Incorrigible, the old Jack. He's a lovely man. Of<br />
course we were able to get him his new little chihuahua and<br />
he loves that little dog.<br />
BROWN: What, since he's come back?<br />
PM: Yes, he'd had one before and it had gone so we<br />
organised this new one. He just is a remarkable character<br />
Jack Ryan. Very very fine man.<br />
BROWN: And I suppose in lots of ways he's representative of<br />
the spirit of ANZAC.<br />
PM: Yes. Well when you see the physical conditions John<br />
under which those blokes had to exist, then without that<br />
laconic sense of Australian humour and mateship I don't<br />
think they could've survived. They would've gone mad.<br />
Because it was not just the pressure of fire from the Turks<br />
in the superior position above them where they were able to<br />
pick them off day and night. But it was the lice, fleas,<br />
and the physical conditions were just unbelievable. Men<br />
lost 20, 30, 40, 50 pounds. It was just unbelievable.<br />
BROWN: Your uncle had been a Labor Premier in West<br />
Australia had he not? I guess that's where your political<br />
beliefs were fashioned, from your family background and your<br />
uncle' s influence.<br />
PM: Yes, and my parents. My uncle was a Labor Member of<br />
Parliament. He used to come to our place in Perth at least<br />
once a week for a meal and it was certainly how a lot of my<br />
political thinking shaped there. But also very much by my<br />
dad and mum. They weren't sort of Party members or anything<br />
like that. But their philosophy was clearly one of what you<br />
should be about in life is trying to help others and the<br />
sense of commitment and obligation that you have if you've<br />
got talents and time and so on that that ought to be used to<br />
try and make the community a better place and help those<br />
less fortunate than yourself. So it was a combination of my<br />
dad and mum and my uncle that shaped my philosophy.<br />
BROWN: I remember sitting in your office in Canberra one<br />
Sunday morning a couple of years ago and we were putting<br />
together those advertisements for Buy Australia. The<br />
ubiquitous Singo was sitting there and he said to you, now<br />
look Prime Minister, he said, I know you've got awards from<br />
around the world. He said you've got awards from the<br />
International Labor Organisation in Vienna, you've got an<br />
award from the Government and the people of Israel, you're<br />
the recipient of the Commander in the Order of Australia<br />
which makes you the highest level of Australia<br />
PM: Companion, mate. Companion. </p>
<p>BROWN: Companion sorry, Companion in the Order of<br />
Australia. You've had all sorts of adulation. You've been<br />
Father of the. Year. You've been Australian Prime Minister<br />
for all these years. He said to you that day, I reckon<br />
you'd swap all of those things if once you could've worn the<br />
green and gol~ d and competed for Australia in a sporting<br />
event. Was that a true statement?<br />
PM: It was a true question but I wouldn't have. I mean if<br />
I couldn't have done these things I would have loved to have<br />
played cricket for Australia. But I wouldn't swap anything<br />
for the indescribable honour of being the Prime Minister of<br />
the best country in the world. That's what this country is.<br />
And to be Prime Minister of it is, you wouldn't swap<br />
anything for that. Nothing.<br />
BROWN: Not Even a baggie cap?<br />
PM: Not even a baggie cap. Not even a baggie cap.<br />
BROWN: Well I suppose<br />
PM: Not even Dean Jones' baggie cap.<br />
BROWN: Well I suppose in a very real sense you've played<br />
for Australia every day for the last 25 years or so in<br />
public life.<br />
PM: been in public life now for over 30 years. I went<br />
to the ACTU in 1958 and became sort of well-known as the<br />
advocate and research officer. In 1959 I was conducting all<br />
the cases and then in the present in 1970. So I've been<br />
there in publ. ic life for about 30 years now. It's been a<br />
great experietnce.<br />
BROWN: Now l. isten, we' re in a real capitalist world here.<br />
We're going t~ o take a break and-<br />
PM: Got to nmake a quid mate.<br />
BROWN: Got t~ o get a quid for the station.<br />
( commercial break)<br />
BROWN: Prime! Minister, you must have had high spots and low<br />
spots in your career as Prime Minister. Tell me, what have<br />
been the high Spots? Let's go to the good stuff first.<br />
PM: Well thet high spots. One of the higher spots you've<br />
already referred to the visit to Gallipoli. It is really in<br />
one sense just on a plateau by itself. There is nothing<br />
that can quit~ e match that. Without being exhaustive about<br />
it, I mean the conference, the Special Premiers' Conference<br />
we just had in Brisbane a while ago, it's not a sexy thing.<br />
You know it doesn't jump out and say wasn't that marvellous.<br />
But in terms of the future of this country that was a<br />
highlight because for the first time we had a Prime Minister<br />
sitting down with the Premiers of every State, and Chief </p>
<p>Ministers of the Territories. They all agreed with me that<br />
we had to work together to make this a better country, make<br />
the governments of Australia better. We've set down a<br />
process and -things are happening which will mean that your<br />
listeners, the ordinary citizens of this country are going<br />
to get a better delivery of services because we're going to<br />
have the good sense to work together and not against one<br />
another. That was for me a very very important highlight.<br />
I also, you can't point to a particular time when this<br />
happened, but to be able to change the education<br />
participation rates in this country was a great thing for<br />
me. When we came to office you only had one in three of our<br />
kids staying on in school and we committed ourselves to<br />
changing that. We've turned that right round now so it's<br />
two out of three of our kids. When I go to the schools and<br />
into the education system and see now that it's not a<br />
question of money, wealth or privileges as to whether kids<br />
stay on but -they are all now moving to stay on in the<br />
education system. If they've got the talents then to be<br />
trained further in the tertiary system or the technical<br />
system or the apprenticeship system. That for me in a long<br />
term sense is probably the thing that I get the most<br />
pleasure out of John.<br />
BROWN: But * 1 can recall in your early days as Prime<br />
Minister being very proud of the fact that a lot of the<br />
divisions in the community had receded, in fact disappeared,<br />
and that we weren't at one another's throats.<br />
PM: recalling that summit in ' 83 when I thought we were<br />
as a nation -just dissipating ourselves by fighting one<br />
another. You had unions fighting employers, everyone seemed<br />
to be at one another's throats. So calling that summit and<br />
getting the employers, the governments, the trade unions,<br />
community welfare organisations, local government, getting<br />
them all together, they'd never before met. They committed<br />
themselves to trying to work together rather than fight one<br />
another. That was very much a highlight for me. It's<br />
worked. I mean we now have in this country 60% less<br />
industrial diLsputes than we had when I came to office.<br />
That's a highlight for me. I think Australians do work<br />
together better than they did before. I certainly<br />
appreciated what you were saying before at the beginning of<br />
your program this morning, that we've got to understand that<br />
we've got an enormous number of advantages in this country.<br />
We've had to slow things down. I know that people, some<br />
people, are hurting and it's a matter of sorrow for me. But<br />
really we're going to come back very, very much stronger as<br />
we go through 91. If we remember that we depend upon one<br />
another and we've got to help one another, continue that<br />
spirit of the Summit then I think we've got an enormous<br />
future as a nation.<br />
BROWN: I won't get on to sport yet cause that's a different<br />
thing. Tell me about a few of the low spots, you must have<br />
had some low spots. </p>
<p>PM: I have had some low spots. I think for me the<br />
continuing lowest I mean it's not just one time but it<br />
continues, in a sense, to be a low spot for me, was the way<br />
in which a great positive achievement by this country, and<br />
not just by me and the Government, but a great positive<br />
achievement by this country has been made into a negative.<br />
I refer to the question of children in poverty. When we<br />
came to office we had a situation where the Government, the<br />
Federal Gover-nment, was not doing very much of significance<br />
for low income families and children and this worried me.<br />
We did a number of particular things. Then as I went up to<br />
the 1987 election I'd prepared with people involved, Brian<br />
Howe and others, we got this idea that we would, as a<br />
Government, r-eally pay an enormous amount of money to low<br />
income familiLes so that there'd be no financial need for any<br />
child in this country to live in poverty. We made it a<br />
highlight of the 1987 election and we've poured, by the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement, we've poured, each year over a<br />
billion dollars directed right into the lowest income<br />
families in this country. In the speech that I delivered<br />
here in Sydney in the Opera House, in explaining what we're<br />
going to do, I'd set it all out in the major written<br />
attachment to the speech, and said we would create a<br />
situation where there would be no financial need for any<br />
child to live in poverty. In the written speech I said our<br />
goal will be that no child will live in poverty by 1990.<br />
Now I've been hounded and the Government's been hounded with<br />
that,' of course, there are children living in poverty now<br />
but no-one acknowledges the fact that we delivered on our<br />
promise that there'd be no financial need. We have<br />
delivered what we did with the money, well over a billion<br />
dollars a year, to those in need. The welfare organisations<br />
have acknowledged that this is more than, not only has ever<br />
been done in this country, but there's no country in the<br />
world which matches what we've done in meeting that<br />
financial corrmitment to look after kids in low income<br />
families. Now of course you can't deal with the situation<br />
where the kids leave home and the money is not used by the<br />
parents to look after the kids. I mean, unless you're going<br />
to live in a totally Draconian society, a totally command<br />
economy, you can't deal with that. We've delivered<br />
something that's never been done anywhere else. A massive<br />
delivery of money to the families of low income people where<br />
the kids are. Yet that<br />
BROWN: In a home environment.<br />
PM: In a home environment. That achievement which is<br />
recognised by those in the welfare sector as unmatched in<br />
the history of this country, unmatched in any other country,<br />
that great achievement just gets lost in this cry about no<br />
child live in poverty in 1990. That's a continuing hurt for<br />
me. BROWN: Yes, well I guess it's a measure of the way that the<br />
things can be twisted around. But I suppose you still must<br />
smart and hurt at the spectre of homeless kids </p>
<p>PM: Sure.<br />
BROWN: As yo) u explained, there's really not much you can do<br />
to assist those kids that aren't living in the home<br />
environment. You can assist families<br />
PM: Although in respect of creating funds with the States<br />
for shelters, we've put an enormous amount of money, another<br />
million just the year before last which we put into<br />
that. More money than has ever been put before into<br />
providing funds for shelter for the homeless you can do that<br />
but in any society there are always going to be some who<br />
fall through those safety nets you create. I just think<br />
it's terribly sad, you know, that there's this political<br />
opportunism that says, well you know just bang, bang, bang<br />
no child should live in poverty, and ignoring the fact that<br />
in regard to the specific promise that we made and that as<br />
a community ere are benefiting from that we write all<br />
ourselves down by not acknowledging and I think that's sad.<br />
BROWN: Stil. the Press tends to run away with things. I<br />
remember having a conversation with you a couple of weeks<br />
ago, you were telling me about a visit you had to Melbourne<br />
one Friday arid a couple of nice stories and then the story<br />
that appeared on the Sunday's press. Tell us that story.<br />
PM: Well, I went down to Melbourne to do two things of<br />
very, very considerable significance. In the morning we<br />
went out to the western suburbs of Melbourne to open this<br />
new unit of the Western University. First time it had a<br />
university in Melbourne in the western suburbs and this was<br />
one unit of it. It meant that the kids out, and not just<br />
the kids but the adults that wanted to go on in tertiary<br />
studies, were now having the opportunity of doing it out in<br />
the western suburbs rather than going to where the<br />
universities always were in the more affluent sections.<br />
That was terribly important and then in the afternoon I went<br />
and opened a tyre factory. Pacific Dunlop group were<br />
opening it. It will be the most modern, state-of-the-art<br />
tyre factory, with big tyres these are for trucks. The<br />
most modern, state-of-the-art factory in the world, will<br />
have better productivity than anywhere, will be exporting a<br />
very significant proportion of its total production. So the<br />
Press were there at the university they were there at this<br />
factory which is competitive, beat anything in the world,<br />
adding to Australia's exports. They followed me around, we<br />
had a press conference and I was asked about that fellow the<br />
ex-diplomat who said he was going to go<br />
BROWN: Go to Iraq as an envoy.<br />
PM: He was going to go to Iraq and in the end didn't go.<br />
He'd made a quite incorrect statement about Australia's<br />
involvement and I'd corrected him. I hadn't gotten into any<br />
vicious attack but had corrected him and said what he said<br />
was wrong.<br />
BROWN: You didn't call him a silly old bugger. </p>
<p>PM: No, I didn't. Whatever I thought about him I didn't<br />
say that. I just factually corrected him. So what was all<br />
the Press story about. Not about the university in the<br />
western suburbs. Not about Australia's new most modern in<br />
the world State-of-the-art tyre factory but about Hawke<br />
having a proper go and a warranted go at this fellow who was<br />
telling untruths about Australia's involvement in the Gulf.<br />
Now that sort: of thing I find sad.<br />
BROWN: But wasn't there, the same weekend, a story about<br />
you being at Frank Lowy's birthday party?<br />
PM: Yes that: was a good one. That was a good one. I was<br />
flying down there that day. I think it was a Friday. I was<br />
flying down there. I was looking at the Sydney Morning<br />
Herald and I read through it and I got up to the financial<br />
page and I was reading that and then I saw this caricature<br />
of Frank Lowy who is a friend of mine, has been for zonks of<br />
years, well before he became rich and famous.<br />
BROWN: He was a mate of mine when he had a smallgoods run.<br />
PM: Yes he had a smallgoods, yes that's right. So I said<br />
what's this about. So I read it and it said last Saturday<br />
night there wras big party to celebrate the 60th birthday of<br />
Frank Lowy. There were many celebrity people there from the<br />
world of politics and business including Bob Hawke who,<br />
according to all accounts, this was the phrase, who<br />
according to all accounts made a highly emotional speech.<br />
BROWN: Highly emotional speech.<br />
PM: The only problem with that is that Bob Hawke didn't<br />
speak. I was; there, I didn't speak. But there was this<br />
phrase, according to all accounts. I mean, what do you do?<br />
BROWN: Look we'll come back to this in just a moment.<br />
0 We've got a few advertisers here who want the ears of our<br />
listeners. PM: Good on them.<br />
( Commercial break)<br />
BROWN: Prime! Minister, you're sitting in here with me and<br />
we're delighted to have you. On the line we've got<br />
Commodore Don Chalmers of the HMAS Darwin who's steaming<br />
down the east: coast on the way home from their service in<br />
the Gulf. We've arranged for you to speak to the Commodore.<br />
PM: That's crreat.<br />
BROWN: Your conversation with the Commodore and also with<br />
Captain Russ Shalders, who's also there, will be relayed to<br />
all the crew on the Darwin. I might tell you that there are<br />
fathers of' the sailors travelling round from Darwin with<br />
the lads on the Darwin. Good morning Commodore. Good </p>
<p>morning Commodore Don Chalmers. Hello have we got him there<br />
somewhere. Hello. Hello Commodore. I think we've lost him<br />
somewhere. We'll have to try and get the line back. Well<br />
we'll carry on with something else at the moment.<br />
PM: It's exciting. I hope we do have the chance of talking<br />
to him John.<br />
BROWN: We've lost the line somewhere. It's the magic of<br />
modern radio.. But we'll get them back there somewhere. We<br />
were talking about high spots and low spots. I guess<br />
talking about: Iraq it might be a question to ask you.<br />
People seem 1: o think, in their mistaken view, that making a<br />
decision that: you had to make about sending our sailors to<br />
Iraq is made as a political decision. You know, I've<br />
realised tha: the extraordinary impact this must have on<br />
your mind. The extraordinary impact that prime ministers in<br />
other times have had to shoulder that responsibility of<br />
making decisions about the lives of young men and women. I<br />
mean, exactly what sort of an impact does that sort of<br />
decision make on you?<br />
PM: It' s immeasurable. I mean, it's hard to describe. I<br />
mean,' I just sat there by myself when I knew we were going<br />
to have to come to this and just sat closeted by myself<br />
thinking about it. Paradoxically, as I said, it was perhaps<br />
the most serious decision I've taken as Prime Minister but<br />
in the end one of the easiest because it was crystal clear<br />
in my mind, as I thought through it, what Australia's<br />
obligations were in this regard. I knew we had to be part<br />
of this process. I knew there was the risk of actual<br />
conflict. Risk of action in which people could be injured<br />
or even could die but we've come to a new time in world<br />
affairs where we have to be prepared to keep the world order<br />
in a condition where aggression will not be paid.<br />
BROWN: Yes, I guess it must be an incredible responsibility<br />
to have to undertake as, of course, prime ministers and<br />
leaders of countries have done in the past. Roosevelt in<br />
the United States, Churchill, John Curtin in Australia. I<br />
suppose in the micro sense you've had to undertake to<br />
yourself the same responsibility. I know that it must bear<br />
very heavily on your mind. So there must be some joy in<br />
seeing these kids come back socially.<br />
PM: It,' s marvellous.<br />
BROWN: Seeing the hostages return. So we now have<br />
Commodore Doni Chalmers on the line and your message will be<br />
relayed to the fleet, not just to the Darwin. Good day<br />
Commodore. Hlow are you?<br />
CHALMERS: I'm very well. How are you?<br />
BROWN: Well I've got the Prime Minister sitting here. He'd<br />
like to talk to you.<br />
CHALMERS: Thanks very much. </p>
<p>PM: Don, could I just say, personally, and on behalf of the<br />
Government, most importantly on behalf of the people of<br />
Australia, to you and the crews firstly how proud we are of<br />
the job you've done. You've been involved in a very, very<br />
large number of intercepts and actions which have been<br />
involved in making the sanctions works. So we're first of<br />
all very, very proud of you. We thank you for what you've<br />
done and we welcome you back to Australia so that you will<br />
be able to have Christmas and the New Year with your loved<br />
ones. I'm looking forward very much to coming out on the<br />
ship when you arrive off Sydney on the 21st so I can say<br />
directly to you and the men thank you for a job well done.<br />
CHALMERS: Thank you very much indeed for those kind words.<br />
We certainly look forward to seeing you on our return to<br />
Sydney. I think, in you saying how proud you are of what<br />
we've done I must add that we, here, are particularly proud<br />
of what our men have done. All Australia can be proud of<br />
them. They've been particularly adaptable, they've<br />
improvised and most of all they've met absolutely every<br />
challenge that's been thrown at them.<br />
PM: All the reports I've had, Don, confirm absolutely what<br />
you've said. It's not only the reports I get from our own<br />
service commanders but from what I hear from other forces,<br />
Australians, as always, have lived up to the challenge and<br />
they've performed mightily. Now of course the ships that<br />
are moving in that have moved in to replace you are going<br />
into a position where there could be an even greater risk.<br />
But I know firstly that you, and they, will hope that that<br />
doesn't arise because neither the Government, the people,<br />
nor the forces of Australia want war but if conflict does<br />
arise I know that, as in the past, they will do this country<br />
proud. I never cease to have a great sense of pride about<br />
the way in which this small country has always accepted its<br />
share of responsibility. We are a nation that wants peace,<br />
loves peace but if it's necessary to fight to preserve peace<br />
then we're there. </p>
<p>CHALMERS: That's certainly true and I know that they're<br />
pretty well prepared to go into the Gulf and do what has to<br />
be done, if it has to be done, in the same way that we were.<br />
As you well know we left at very short notice, not really<br />
knowing what we were going towards and there's no doubt that<br />
these two ships that I'm bringing back now were in very good<br />
condition to fac*. e anything and indeed the ships themselves<br />
were too. Theiir serviceability was quite fantastic. When<br />
we arrived up in the Gulf all our mission critical systems<br />
were up and when we left they were still up. So not only<br />
have the men done well but the hardware we've got's done<br />
pretty well too.<br />
PM: Well I'm vary pleased to hear that, Don, because as<br />
everyone knows iLt was relatively short notice and that's, I<br />
think, a very considerable reflection upon the quality of<br />
our Navy that W43 are in a shape that when a crisis does<br />
occur that in a very short time we can put ourselves in a<br />
position to discharge the obligations that arise. Don, tell<br />
me all the reports I get are that the morale of the crews is<br />
high. Is that true?<br />
CHALMERS: That's very true. morale's very high. We are, I<br />
guess, pleased -to be coming home for Christmas, for some<br />
short leave and some, and then maintenance for the ships,<br />
maintenance for ourselves and then back for another work-up<br />
and ready for a third deployment if that's required.<br />
PM: Yes well of course I guess you, like myself, hope that<br />
that's not necessary but I know that that's precisely what<br />
you'll do if it's necessary,<br />
BROWN: Now Don, it's John Brown here. Now I can tell you<br />
that the morale of those lads will be lifted when they see<br />
the reception they're going to get when they come back into<br />
Sydney on Friday morning. They can look forward to that<br />
with great anticipation, I'll tell you.<br />
CHALMERS: We c4artainly Will. I mean the support we've had<br />
while we've beein away has been fantastic. You know, not<br />
only from our families who, I guess, we take for granted.<br />
We expect them -to support us but the people of Australia,<br />
the thousands of school children that have written to us,<br />
it's really been absolutely fantastic. This sort of welcome<br />
home certainly changed from the last time we had forces<br />
overseas. BROWN: Well it's been a thrill for our listeners to be able<br />
to correspond with you directly like that and thanks for<br />
coming on the line.<br />
CHALMERS: Thaniks very much.<br />
BROWN: Thank you. Well that was Commodore John Chalmers on<br />
the Darwin steaming down the east coast on the way back<br />
after a triumphal visit on Australia's behalf to the Gulf of<br />
Oman, being part of that United Nations and world effort<br />
against the oppression of Saddam Hussein. Just getting back </p>
<p>to you, Prime Minister. I know you're a very affectionate<br />
man and a man who's extremely emotional on lots of things.<br />
There have been criticisms directed at you for the fact that<br />
you do show ycour emotions and I can recall two very dear<br />
friends of min~ e, two of the roughest, toughest blokes I<br />
know, Keithy H.~ olman who had 24 tests against England in<br />
Rugby League and Johnny Raper who'e an even tougher bloke<br />
than and they both said now listen you tell Hawkey<br />
nothing wrong with crying, I cried every time I ran out<br />
on the field for Australia. Raper says he cries every time<br />
he thinks about putting on an Australian jumper. So I don't<br />
think the criticisms have been valid and I think most people<br />
have been pretty happy to see that we've got a Prime<br />
Minister that is prepared to exhibit his emotions on some of<br />
these issues.<br />
PM: Well I think you're made the way you are. It's been in<br />
a sense at timtes embarrassing I guess, that this happens.<br />
But that's the way I am and I can't undo it and I don't want<br />
to undo it<br />
BROWN: Neither you should.<br />
PM: And I don't feel, you know, in the end embarrassed by<br />
it, John, though at times I suppose you wished it didn't<br />
happen. But t: hat, as I say, that'. the way I am and I think<br />
there's a lot of nonsense talked about it's manly not to<br />
show emotions. I think this is nonsense. I don't think<br />
really one should be ashamed if you feel deeply and it moves<br />
you at times to tears about a particular issue. Well, you<br />
know, that's it. I mean if you feel that way, that's the<br />
way it is.<br />
BROWN: Well t: hink about it, your daughter's illness, I mean<br />
a father would be less than human if he wasn't upset, not<br />
only about the problem but also enormously proud of the way<br />
the way in which she's coped with that<br />
PM: Magnificont.<br />
BROWN: And then Tienanmen Square. I mean having those<br />
Chinese students with you. I mean you'd be less than a man<br />
if you didn't feel emotional about that.<br />
PM: Yes in that particular instance too just before I went<br />
out there I just received this cable and it was just<br />
unbelievable, you know, the description of what had been<br />
happening there of the, you know, piling up the bodies and<br />
just crushing them to death and setting them on fire. I<br />
mean, God, just mind boggling.<br />
BROWN: Less than human behaviour. We've got to go and earn<br />
another quid f~ or the station but we'll be back in just a<br />
moment with the Prime Minister.<br />
BROWN: Prime Minister, sport is an obsession that you and i<br />
both share and I guess you must take a great deal of pride<br />
in what's happened with sport since you've been Prime </p>
<p>Minister. Q) uite apart from the fact that the budget's gone<br />
from $ 6M to $ 60M, there's a lovely story in the Press today<br />
about John Newcombe out yesterday with some crippled kids in<br />
wheelchairs, teaching them to play tennis and you might<br />
recall that before I became your Minister for Sport the<br />
budget for the handicapped was zilch. Now it's a couple of<br />
million dollars. It's lovely to see these things. Now I'll<br />
ask you thes questions in the context of Sydney's bid for<br />
the Olympic Games. I mean no doubt the Commonwealth will be<br />
having a good look at this, they don't want to be backing<br />
losers or chasing rainbows. What are your feeling at the<br />
moment? PM: Well I've had a discussion with Nick Greiner' and he's<br />
writing to ine in fact the letter may have arrived I<br />
don't know b~ ut he'll be writing to me setting out what they<br />
need in money terms and also talking about trying to make<br />
land available for the Newington area, they're talking about<br />
there for<br />
BROWN: accommodation, yes.<br />
PM: There May be some problems about that, not in attitude<br />
on our part but unexploded ordnance, we've got to have a<br />
look at that sort of thing because it's been used for these<br />
purposes for about 100 years. But I said to Nick, we'll be<br />
cooperative, they may want some up-front money they said and<br />
if they didn't succeed in their bid, well then they'd give<br />
the money back. So I'm going to look at his letter and<br />
we'll look at it very positively because you know, we<br />
supported the Melbourne bid before, we would've been happy<br />
to see them get it, they didn't, and if Sydney can go ahead<br />
with a realistic bid and I would think they can then it<br />
would be great for Australia if we could got it, absolutely<br />
great. The, year 2000 would be very special and I know<br />
you'll be around and I certainly hope to be, John. But you<br />
look at what Sydney's got, I mean, there's not many cities<br />
in the world who've got what this great city can offer.<br />
BROWN: You put the seal on Sydney's greatness as a modern<br />
city get those Games. I think we're a hell of a big<br />
chance. PM: You know, we've been talking about it. It is the case<br />
that Berlin has had it now on a number of occasions,<br />
Germany's had it on a number of occasions. So there'd be<br />
some attitude that, you know, they've been around. Now<br />
Beijing, apparently there's some question about their<br />
capacity, the infrastructure and so on quite apart from<br />
what attitudes will be lingering over from last year.<br />
There's no doubt that the Southern Hemisphere deserves to<br />
get it. I mean it is incredible that in 100 years the<br />
Southern Hemnisphere has had it once. it just is unfair.<br />
When you look at the symbols, you know the five circles..<br />
it's unfair.<br />
BROWN: Yes~, true. of course Australia's record in the<br />
Olympic Games has been one in </p>
<p>PM: one in three countris evary one..<br />
BROWN: An extraordinary record of success for a young<br />
country. It's; wonderful. Now just on one final subject<br />
before you go. I'm not ambushing you on this. But on this<br />
program some 12 months or so ago you made the announcement<br />
that Greg Norman would be doing some ads for us following<br />
Paul Hogan and Lawey questioned you about whether the money<br />
could become aLvailable and I think all Australia's waiting<br />
for Greg to be~ out there being the flag-bearer for<br />
Australia. I know Greg is waiting with anxious anticipation<br />
of going out there being the next Hogan. What's happening<br />
there? You know the Tourist Commission has a bit of money.<br />
PM4: I think you'll find that in a very short period that<br />
they'll be getting what they need to use one of our great<br />
drawcards and I think you'll be very happy in the near<br />
future.<br />
BROWN: I'll. tell you what a God Greg is in Japan. At Palm<br />
Meadows Golf Course which you know very well the big<br />
thing that the Japanese want to photograph is Greg Norman's<br />
looker in the club house. with a camera.* I mean he<br />
really is status. We've got to go. Thanks for coming<br />
in, it's been a delight to have you here, Australia's second<br />
longest servinig Prime Minister, someone who's done Australia<br />
extremely proud over your period. The polls aren't greatly<br />
in your favour at the moment but that's a transitory thing<br />
and no doubt you'll be back firing on all fours. Thank you<br />
for coming in.<br />
PM: Thanks John and thank you very much and may I take this<br />
opportunity of wishing your listeners a very, very, merry<br />
Christmas and a happy new year.<br />
BROWN: Thanks, Prime Minister.<br />
