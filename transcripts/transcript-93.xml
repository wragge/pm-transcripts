REPCRT TO THE NATION<br />
TALK ON GTV9 BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE R. G. MENZIES, QOCO, MVP.<br />
AUGUST, 1959.<br />
I am delighted to have the opportunity of saying something<br />
to you about this last journey of mine around the world. I know<br />
there are people who think that every visit around the world or<br />
anywhere else by a politician is a species of holiday jaunt. I<br />
can assure you that they are not. Mine was in fact the businest<br />
journey I have ever had. I had almost no leisure time but I<br />
found it much more exciting because in the course of my journey<br />
around the world, I had quite close intimate discussions with<br />
about ten heads of government in the various countries in the<br />
world.. And although, of course, it won't be possible to speak<br />
of all of them I do anticipate that before this little programme<br />
is over, I will have the opportunity of saying something to you<br />
about some of them.<br />
JOHN FOSTER DULLES.<br />
I knew John Foster Dulles very well indeed. We were<br />
very closely associated in the negotiations for -the ANZUS treaty;<br />
in the early discussions about the Suez crisis and of course,<br />
later on. In that event, it was my duty, as I felt it, to<br />
disagree with him. Up to that point, we had been in complete<br />
unity. But the great thing about John Foster Dulles not always<br />
understood during his life was that he was a patriot, a man of<br />
the highest ideals and a man of the highest courage. It was<br />
always possible to disagree with him; sometimes one might feel<br />
bound to disagree with him, because we all have our own views.<br />
But it was never possible to doubt that he was a man of great<br />
quality. He was of enormous service to his own country, though<br />
not always recognised for that service. He was of enormous<br />
service to the free world, though a very contentious figure. I<br />
believe that he has made an enduring mark in the modern world,<br />
in circumstances of great difficulty.<br />
QUESTION: And you've met his successor, Mr. Herter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I did. In the course of my life, as you<br />
know, I have met a great number of people, but I had never met<br />
Mr. Herter before, and therefore I was very interested to do it.<br />
He flew in from Geneva, I think, only that morning, but he was<br />
good enough to give me an interview within half an hour of his<br />
arrival. I found him a man of immense personal attraction. He<br />
has charm-he obviously has a high intellectual background; he<br />
has experience. And I think that, provided he gets the necessary<br />
backing, he is quite likely to prove to be a very, very<br />
distinguished Secretary of State in the United States. I liked<br />
him. I came away happy about his point of view and what he was<br />
doing. I took the liberty as I usually do, with may characteristic<br />
impudence to give him a little moral backing in what he<br />
was doing at Geneva. I think he is a good man and I think we may<br />
be very, very happy about him.<br />
QUESTION: And you had talks with the President.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I did. The President was extraordinarily<br />
good to me about it, because he had invited us to have lunch with<br />
him on the day which turned out to be the day of the funeral of<br />
John Foster Dulles and so he gave me a very long interview that<br />
morning. I had not seen him for two years. I ha~ d seen a bit of<br />
him, of course, over the last three or four years before that.<br />
I was delighted to find that he was in such health and<br />
spirits that I could hardly believe it. He has had illnesses;<br />
we have all been given somewhat gloomy reports about it. I<br />
assure you that he sat there as a man in a very vigorous health<br />
and certainly in a very vigorous condition of mind. He left me </p>
<p>0 0 </p>
<p>in no doubt as to what his views were on anything that cropped up.<br />
In other words, I found him a revived and vigorous man. And that,<br />
I think, is a very good thing, and a very good thing because the<br />
responsibilities that rest on the President of the United States<br />
are tremendous. He has a duty of leadership, a duty which he owes<br />
not only to the people of the United States, but to a lot of<br />
other people. That I perhaps remember more vividly than<br />
anything else. The point of view in Bonn, the point of view in<br />
Paris was considerably influenced by the view in Washington.<br />
QUESTION: President Eisenhower seems diffident about the idea of<br />
a Summit Confference.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I, of course, have no right to be speaking<br />
for him, you know. But I think that on the whole, his attitude<br />
can be summed up in this way or it could have been:. " I am<br />
always prepared to attend a conference anywhere if it will help<br />
to preserve or to restore the peace. But I am not prepared to have<br />
a Summit Conference unless I see some guarantee of success some<br />
practical thing done by the Soviet Union as an indication that<br />
goodwill is intended and a settlement is desired." That has been<br />
his attitude. As you know, he is a man of very high ideals and<br />
a most earnest seeker after peace. His view in the long run,<br />
particularly in the events of the last two years, did not commend<br />
itself very much to me, because I thought that the problem had<br />
reached a point of urgency.<br />
Anyhow, the President has now taken a very important step.<br />
He has not yet said " I am for a Summit Conference"; nor, let it<br />
be made clear, is he going to see Khrushchev, or is Khrushchev<br />
seeing him, as representatives of the free world on the one side,<br />
and of the Soviet Union on the other. What the President has<br />
made very clear is that he will speak for his own country and<br />
of course, as a very distinguished man, for himself; that he does<br />
not regard himself as negotiating. Well, that I think is a point<br />
of view that is quite understandable. But I have ] Lived long<br />
enough in the world to believe that if the President of the United<br />
States and the President of the Soviet Union not the " President"<br />
but the master of the Soviet Union get together for a few days<br />
of easy informal conversation walking around the garden, or<br />
sitting at the table after dinner, then much could well come of it,<br />
because if the ice is broken then the road to the Summit<br />
Conference of a more elaborate kind will have been opened.<br />
And so I find in the development that has occurred in the<br />
American attitude great room for hope. I have, myselflively<br />
expectations of The President, of course, is a determined<br />
man, but I thought I detected in Washington in -the high quarters<br />
in Washington, a growing feeling that we must get to grips with<br />
these matters by getting into the closest and most; frequent<br />
personal contact with people on the other side i~ f I might use<br />
that expression on the other side of the whole conflict of the<br />
world of ideas, on the other side of the Iron Curtain.<br />
And therefore, not to make too long a story of it, I-was<br />
delighted to find the American President in such good form, so<br />
lively, so eager; and I am sure that we will all have the benefit<br />
of it.<br />
QUESTION: Finally, could you sum up your own attitude towards the<br />
Summit Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, perhaps what I have just been saying about<br />
the position of the American President reflects some light on<br />
my own view. I believe I have always believed that if you are<br />
going to discuss some complex concrete matter, say an international<br />
trade discussion, or something of that kind, there must<br />
be an enormous amount of preliminary work detail. work. Things<br />
have to be put down on paper. Documents have to be abstracted<br />
and put together. All sorts of work must be done. And, until </p>
<p>0 </p>
<p>a couple of years ago, I thought that this probably was the rule<br />
that applied to a Summit meeting. I confess I have changed my<br />
mind, because in the last two years, we have seen such a<br />
tremendous acceleration of the Soviet propaganda about a peace<br />
offensive as if only the Communists wanted peace, and we didn't.<br />
A terrible thought that the Communists should be able to<br />
represent themselves, and themselves alone, as wanting peace,<br />
when everybody knows that all the wars and rumours of war since<br />
the great war, have been as a result of their actions.<br />
And therefore, I believe, it is time,,-more than time to<br />
have a democratic peace offensive. We are not to be on the<br />
defensive. We are to assume the initiative. And the right way to<br />
assume the initiative is to say, " Very well, we will talk with<br />
you anywhere and at any time." Let's have Summit meetings. Don't<br />
let's have them necessarily surrounded by brass bands and<br />
publicity or even television. Let's have private conversations<br />
designed to arrive at thos preliminary, personal understandings<br />
which may lead to concrete results in a series of discussions<br />
thereafter. Now, that exhibits why I believe in this business,<br />
I do not think we have anything to lose how could we? but I<br />
think we have everything to gain, by making it quiLte clear that<br />
we are for peace and that we are prepared to talk anywhere and at<br />
any time in order to obtain it.<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. MACMILLAN<br />
QUESTION: You discussed many questions with Mr. Macmillan.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. We had, of course, problems of the ordinary<br />
kind between the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries,<br />
including Australia. Then, of course, we had, in an overwhelming<br />
degree, the problems associated with a Summit Conference, of<br />
which Mr. Macmillan himself and his ministers were powerful<br />
advocates. We had no formal conference. It was one of those<br />
occasions when you could have informal discussions to a probably<br />
far greater degree than if a number of people were there; and so<br />
I saw a great deal of Mr. Macmillan, who is, of course, a very<br />
old friend of mine and who has the happiest recollections of his<br />
visit to Australia. With him, I had talks about our mutual<br />
relations to the European Common Market, a highly important but<br />
somewhat technical matter. We had discussions about other matters<br />
of common concern. But above all things, we were pursuing our<br />
discussions about the world position and particularly the<br />
European position, because it was in relation to Berlin that the<br />
Geneva conference was occurring.<br />
We had a good deal to say about that, of course, not only<br />
on Be-rlin but on the whole question of world settlemaent-and on<br />
this, Mr. Macmillan has shown, as he showed when he went to Moscow<br />
without much warning, without much preliminary preparation, that<br />
he is all for arriving at peace by conference. We discussed that<br />
a great deal, and in point of fact, I went, o at his invitation to<br />
a Cabinet meeting at No. 10, and there we discussed the same<br />
matter. I was given the courtesy of taking a hand in the talks;<br />
and therefore, when I subsequently went to Europe, I was rather<br />
well informed as to what the state of mind in London, at any rate,<br />
of the Government, was. All these things proved to me to be<br />
extraordinarily interesting. I felt, and I know from subsequent<br />
correspondence with Mr. Macmillan, that he felt that as two old<br />
friends and two people of responsibility his, of course, much<br />
greater than mine we had secured mutual advantage, and, I think,<br />
some comfort, from being able to talk to each other without the<br />
intervention of other people or other circumstances.<br />
QUESTION: We've been inside No. 10 with you. This wasn't your<br />
first visit of course. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Not my first visit by any means. Oddly enough,-<br />
though I am as you can see, quite a boy I attended a meeting of<br />
Prime Minislers for the first time in 1935. I was not Prime<br />
Minister then, but I deputised for the late Mr. Lyons. Since then,<br />
I have sat in that historic room with, I think, every succeeding<br />
Prime Minister of Great Britain. Of course, the outstanding one<br />
is this marvellous man ( Sir Winston Churchill). It is not saying<br />
anything derogatory about anybody else to say that he IS<br />
No. 10 Downing Street. He is the greatest memory that anybody<br />
could have. I sat there with him early in the war and, of course,<br />
later on after the war when he became Prime Minister once more.<br />
I was delighted this time -I may say, I never go to London without<br />
going down to see him, either at Chartwell or wherever he may be,<br />
and we have talks as old friends. And this time you may be<br />
interested to know that I found him quite remarkable. He is<br />
like you and me; he is ten years older than he was ten years ago.<br />
That is something that happens to all of us; and therefore he was<br />
not the old robustious leader that we became accustomed to. But<br />
his mind is clear. I went to a dinner at the Australian Club<br />
seven hundred men at it in London, and he sat between myself on<br />
the right and the American Ambassador on his left. And all I can<br />
tell you is that he was a great deal livelier than I was. He was<br />
in superb form. He discussed pseudo-political matters with me<br />
in a rather bright and witty fashion; and on the other side, I<br />
could hear him conducting a most learned discussion on racehorses<br />
with Ambassador Whitney. That is something that appeals to us<br />
all versatility and vigor, prolonged so magnificently.. shall1<br />
never forget him.<br />
BERLIN. We have all been saying of recent days that we hope that<br />
the balloon won't go up over Berlin. Personally, I don't think<br />
it will. Berlin's significance, of course, to us of what I will<br />
call the western world, is tremendous. If Berlin passed into the<br />
hands of East Germany, which is today a Soviet satellite country,<br />
then I think that the blow to the pride of Germany would be<br />
enormous; the blow to the whole western alliance in Europe would<br />
be tremendous. I believe that it would give rise to an attitude of<br />
arrogance and aggression from which aything could come. Therefore,<br />
Berlin has been at the centre of the discussions at Geneva, As<br />
you know, Berlin has become not only a city, but a symbol of a<br />
conflict which everybody wants to see resolved, but resolved on<br />
terms of justice to European nations.<br />
Now, of course I had discussions about these things in<br />
Bonn with Chancellor Aaenauer. He is a very remarkable man,<br />
He is about 83, 84+; so full of vigor that he is already talking<br />
about the next election. I think that is magnificent. I knew<br />
him pretty well. In 1956, I had visited Germany specially. I had<br />
some days with him and we became very friendly. He has a nice<br />
sense of humour, and like me, he likes having his own way, if he<br />
can, so we got on pretty well.<br />
He has, of course, done a remarkable job. I know that<br />
people argue now and think that he is becoming old and difficult<br />
and all that kind of thing. The great recovery of Western<br />
Germany since the war is to be credited to Adenauer, more than<br />
to any other single human being. He has been a magnificent<br />
leader, full of courage and, I think, full of understanding of the<br />
European problem. He has got to very good terms with President<br />
De Gaulle. He himself feels that relations between the Germans<br />
and the French have been vastly improved.<br />
He was extraordinarily good to me. He had a little<br />
trouble on his hands, because, you remember, he was going to<br />
become President and then decided to remain Chancellor. And under<br />
those circumstances, I thought I might be lucky to get an hour<br />
with him; but he gave me about five or six and nothing could have<br />
been more interesting than our discussions. He has reservations </p>
<p>about a Summit meeting, largely of the same kind as thoso enter-.<br />
tamned by President Eisenhower. He feels, and I am sure he is<br />
right, that it would not be good to see Europe indefinitely<br />
divided in an economic sense between the Common Market to which<br />
Germany belongs, and to the Little Free Trade Area led by the<br />
United Kingdom and he looked forward to some reconciliation<br />
between these two bodies. But one thing I did notice about him,<br />
and it is worth a great deal of thought on the part of many<br />
people: He is firmly convinced, or he was when I saw him that<br />
the British people, and presumably the British Government, is<br />
inveterately and bitterly hostile to Germany and to himself in<br />
particular. He followed this line so much that first of all I tried<br />
to discover why he should have any distrust of Great Britain;<br />
why he should have this feeling that was so obvious. After an<br />
hour, it appeared that he felt that some appeasement might be in<br />
the air; that something might be done which would prejudice the<br />
re-unification of Germany. I tried to get at that. We elicited<br />
various things, not one of which I thought was crucial. But it<br />
turns out he believes that the British have this hostility which<br />
I have described. Well, I was so struck by this competely<br />
confirmed attitude of mind that I chided him a little and said,<br />
" You know, you are quite wrong. I think you must have been<br />
confining your reading to one or two newspapers of a critical<br />
kind." I rather think he had, but he certainly had this<br />
impression. I took the liberty of saying, " Look, firstly it is<br />
not in the tradition of the British people to maintain hatreds<br />
indefinitely. They never have and they never will. Secondly,<br />
I know something about opinion; certainly about top level opinion<br />
in Great Britain, and I tell you that there is warm admiration<br />
for what West Germany has done since the war the enormous<br />
recovery and a very great admiration for what you, Mr.<br />
Chancellor, have done by providing leadership in that process of<br />
events.*" Well, I hope our discussions did some good. One never<br />
can tell. I certainly felt that I, myself, had been a good deal<br />
illuminated in my mind by discovering what was going on in all<br />
this process of discussion from the German point of view, and so<br />
I left very well informed, I think, on that matter, and I hope<br />
I was able subsequently to convey to Mr. Macmillan some of my<br />
impressions in a helpful way.<br />
GENERAL DE GAULLE.<br />
Well, that last picture you were looking at sho~ wed you the<br />
President himself myself on one side and the Prime Minister of<br />
France on the other, walking out from the Elysee, the President's<br />
palace, into the back garden.<br />
Of course I was tremendously interested, because I had<br />
known him during the war in 1941 when he was not perhaps the<br />
easiest man in the world to negotiate with. He had what we might<br />
describe as a rather dour characteristic about him immensely<br />
tall, rather dour; magnificently determined on the ultimate<br />
liberation of his country; a man who found no reason to suppose<br />
that you ought to have any jesting or lightness when you are in<br />
the middle of a great struggle. In that respect, of course, he<br />
was so unlike the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who<br />
always had time for a jest and struck his blows no less heavily<br />
because of the jest.<br />
So I was tremendously interested to see how De Gaulle<br />
had gone in the intervening years years, do not forget, in which<br />
he was grievously frustrated. Here he was, the whole spirit of<br />
the delivery of France, of the Croix de Lorraine; and after<br />
France had been liberated, after government was restored, he had<br />
to live in his place in the country, seeing a new government<br />
every six months or every nine months not a very happy state of </p>
<p>affairs for him. But now he is back. He is the all-powerful;<br />
he is the President, with width and depth of authority that no<br />
previous President of France has ever had. He ha~ s not just sat<br />
down and glorified himself with all this power., He has behaved<br />
with most tremendous energy. Just let me give you one example.<br />
Two years ago in Lond, having discussions about the<br />
European Common Market everybody said with great truth, that<br />
Germany was the dominating factor and that France, so to speak,<br />
was the weak member, because France's economy was in a battered<br />
condition galloping inflation going one, all sorts of currency<br />
problems, the usual inability to get in the taxes, a lack of<br />
adequate industrial development. And then came De Gaulle. With<br />
his wide prestige and with the most superbly able advice, the<br />
Programmxe has been put into operation in France which has had the<br />
result of making France one of the king pins if you can have<br />
more than one king pin in the European Common Market. In Bonn,<br />
Chancellor Adenauer spoke to me all the time about the resurgence<br />
of France. I heard it in Lond. And for this great credit must<br />
be given to the prestige, the patriotism and the authority of this<br />
very remarkable Frenchman,<br />
THE NETHERLANDS.<br />
QUESTION: There has been speculation that the new government of<br />
the Netherlands might mean a change in policy on West Now Guinea<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has undoubtedly been a great deal of<br />
speculation, because we did not know what would happen to the<br />
point of view of the Dutch Government after their elections.<br />
Prime Minister Drees, the previous Prime Minister, was a great<br />
believer in what I will call the Dutch policy on West New Guinea.<br />
His party, the Labor Party, was thought not to be quite so keen<br />
on it as he was and there was some speculation as to what would<br />
occur when he went out because he made it clear that hie would<br />
not be resuming. And therefore, I was tremendously interested<br />
to see the new Prime Minister, Mr. De Quay, who used to be a<br />
Professor of Psychology and who was then Queen's Commissioner in<br />
Brabant; and I was interested to find out from him and his<br />
colleagues whether there might be some change in their approach.<br />
The answer was quite clear and unhesitating: " No change. Our<br />
policy on this matter will be precisely the same as the policy of<br />
our predecessors." Later on, when I left The Hague and flew to Zurich, I<br />
saw Mr. Luns, Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, and he<br />
confirmed the proposition that the policy was a continuing policy<br />
and that it need not be thought to be modified in any way. That<br />
means, of course, so far as Australia is concerned, we continue<br />
with our attitude and we continue with the little measures of<br />
administrative contact with the Dutch that we have been<br />
developing quite publicly over the last few years.<br />
INDIA AND NEHRU.<br />
I was very interested, of course, to see Mr. Nehru. We<br />
are very old friends. We are believe it or not the two senior<br />
Prime Ministers in the entire British Commonwealth, and we have<br />
sat almost side by side at conferences at No. 10 Downing Street<br />
for ten years, and therefore I am always pleased to see him and<br />
always pleased to get from him his point of view. His worries<br />
were enormous of course. There was this wretched business in<br />
Kerala about which he had subsequently taken some pretty strong<br />
action. And there had been the alleged rebellions and the most<br />
positively brutal massacres in Tibet, with a lot of reffugees.<br />
That was a great problem.<br />
Very interesting if " interesting" is not too foolish<br />
a word to think about this problem of refugees. Do you know </p>
<p>7.<br />
that we forget that after partition of the subcontinent of India,<br />
there were 18 million refugees who moved from onE) country to the<br />
other. Eighteen million tremendous poverty, tremendous squalor<br />
in many places there were marks of it all over India and<br />
Pakistan. Similarly, up in the north when the Tibet outbreak<br />
occurred9 there were many Tibetans who came acrossi and there<br />
again is one aspect that one might not realise. He pointed out<br />
to me that to settle refugees who were accustomed to living in<br />
a high, cold country like Tibet was very difficult. You could not<br />
put them down into a hot country and expect them to endure. And<br />
therefore, settlement has to be in the more mountainous areas of<br />
India; and it is upon the mountainous areas, along what is called<br />
the McMahon line, that constant discussion has occurred between<br />
the Chinese Communists and Mr. Nehru's government. So this is<br />
not all fun and games, not all milk and honey. There are great<br />
points of difference7and Mr. Nehru was, as always, able to discuss<br />
them with great realism and with great clarity. He was able to<br />
tell me some very interesting things about development in<br />
Communist China and I certainly came away with the impression that<br />
it would be very foolish and this is an impression I had had a<br />
long time for anyone to imagine that Mr. Nehru is an apologist<br />
for the Chinese administration. He merely takes what he believes<br />
to be a realistic view of the matter.<br />
One other thing I will mention, and no more. In both<br />
India and Pakistan, there was enormous pleasure at the prospect<br />
of settling the Indus Waters problem. I think it will be settled.<br />
We are all providing some money towards settling it and if it is<br />
settled then, I believe one of the greatest causes of difference<br />
between India and Pakistan will have disappeared and if that<br />
happens, we will all be delighted.<br />
SINGAPORE. I was looking forward to seeing Dr. Lee ( leader of the new<br />
Singapore Government) and to seeing his ministers, I regard<br />
elections in a country like Singapore as a great triumph for<br />
modern British policy. All these places that were once simple<br />
complete colonies are moving towards their independence, and when,<br />
as in the case of Singapore, a popular election occurs and a<br />
ministry is produced as a result, it deserves not our hostility<br />
or our fear, but our sympathy and understanding. It is the choice<br />
of its country. I had, of course heard all sorts of extravagant<br />
rumours about the Lee administration being a sort. of Communist or<br />
fellow-traveller administration. I don't believe it. I entirely<br />
accept Dr. Lee's repeated statements that he is not either a<br />
Communist or a Communist symapathiser but that on. the contrary he<br />
regards it as a very important duty lo keep his country out of<br />
the Communist orbit. He is a Socialist... yes... but there are many<br />
Socialists in the British countries in the world. We have them<br />
in our own country. I am not a Socialist. I would not, perhaps<br />
have voted for him. I do not know. But he is there and I formed<br />
a very warm opinion of him.<br />
You must not think of people like that as if they were<br />
backward in some fashion. Dear me, Dr. Lee himself is a double<br />
first at Cambridge. He is a man of scholarship. He has a young<br />
and enthusiastic team. Thirty-seven-and-a-half is the average<br />
age of' the Singapore Government.<br />
A big population on a small island a 1lI cn+ 4<br />
increasing by 6o, 000 a year, wifh aat. tLonal 25 000 a year<br />
additional Peoplp cooi-, iiig employment and all thai on an island<br />
in whlich agricultural development is out of the question and the<br />
future depends on industrial development.<br />
It is not the kind of problem that any one of us would be<br />
in a hurry to undertake. The Singapore Government, quite plainly,<br />
has considerable hope, if not expectation do not think<br />
expectation at the moment but considerable hope of joining up </p>
<p>0 </p>
<p>with the Federation of Malaya, because they feel that under those<br />
circumistances, movement of population and perhaps the use of<br />
resources might be considerably increased. Anyhow, that is their<br />
problem; but I just say for myself and for my own people, that<br />
we want then to succeed; we want them to remain a community within<br />
the British Commonwealth; and therefore they are entitled to our<br />
sympathetic understanding not our patronage; they won't like<br />
that, but to our sympathetic understanding-in everything they do.<br />
QUESTION: To suna up, can you say what are the world danger spots<br />
and what are the hopes for peace?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose I could answer that question in a<br />
rather abrupt way perhaps, because first of all, Berlin: Will<br />
there be a settlement about Berlin? Will it become necessary to<br />
have either violence or the threat of violence in Berlin? I am<br />
hoping not, but so far very little progress has been made. There<br />
is Berlin. That means Germany and the whole future of Europe.<br />
There is the Middle East. It is out of the news a little<br />
at the tine but we must never forget that the seeds of trouble<br />
are always Zhere great conflicts in the Middle East, sometimes<br />
concealed; and where there are conflicts, the Comunists usually<br />
have some faculty for securing some kind of profit.<br />
Next there is the trouble spot at the moment in Laos,<br />
Now Laos Cambodia and South Vietnam, Thailand all extremely<br />
vulnerable. If the Vietminh of the north of the old French Indo-<br />
China became aggressive, and in particular, if they have the backing<br />
of Commiunist China I do not want to exaggerate the dangers there,<br />
but they are genuinely there and we will all hope that something<br />
will be done through the United Nations or in co-operation with it<br />
to restrain the fervour of some of the actions, the revolutionary<br />
actions, now occurring in Laos.<br />
And then, of course, for months now disappeared out of<br />
sight, there is the problem of Formosa, the Mats-as, Quemaoy, the<br />
off-shor islands of China all those problems which seem to blow<br />
up about once a year with threats, and then subside a little.<br />
But the fact that they subside does not mean that they have<br />
disappeared. It was a very great privilege for Lie, and a great<br />
opportunity for me, in the presence of so many points of difficulty,<br />
to be able to have so many interesting and fruitful discussions<br />
of which I have been able to give you only a hint, wi-th so many<br />
of the world's leading and most responsible men.<br />
I think I ought to say that I am very greateful to you<br />
for listening to me, as presumably you have as patiently as you<br />
have, if in fact you have been patient. Bu thank you very much.<br />
With the compliments of-<br />
