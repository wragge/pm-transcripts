EXTRACTS FROM SPEECH. BY PRIME MINISTER TO CHELSEA<br />
PENSIONERS' CLUB 15 JUNE 1984<br />
Thank you very very much for having arranged this<br />
meeting, but even more-than that thank you very much indeed<br />
for the warmth. of your welcome. I do appreciate it very much<br />
because as-you know we have been very-much in the news, that<br />
is my Government and pensioners-. And* I do appreciate very<br />
much to have this opportunity so soon after the Parliament<br />
has risen to come and meet such a large-gathering of<br />
pensioners and talking with-you about some of the issues<br />
which I know are of great interest to you. I want to take<br />
you fully into my-confidence and tell you-just what our<br />
thinking has been,' what concerns we've had-in our minds as<br />
to what are the thi-ngs that we can do iand~ what are. the best<br />
ways of doing those things-to look after the interests of<br />
that very important sector of the Australian community, that<br />
is the elderly who are now out of the workforce, who have<br />
made through their lives an enormous contribution through<br />
their working lives to create the sort of Australia that<br />
we've got now to create for us a great country and one in<br />
which the younger people are-now having the opportunity to<br />
build further upon what you've handed on to them. And<br />
there's no sector of the Australian community in regard to<br />
whom I have a greater sense of commitment than yours.<br />
And we've been very-much in the news the Government and<br />
the elderly because we've had to be directing our attention<br />
to the best way of meeting our commitment to you.<br />
Now I want to say directly to you that what we're about, what<br />
we've been about, is this question of how we can best lift<br />
the levels of pensions for those who need it most. What we've<br />
been about is to try and see how we can combine the considerations<br />
of equity-and fairness with the facts of the constraints which<br />
exist upon our Government in terms of the amount of money that's<br />
available to do the things which you want us to do. In other<br />
words no'Government, mine or any that's been before or any<br />
that'vill be coming after, has got unlimited revenue. Because<br />
the only revenue that we've got available to us as a Government<br />
is what we collect by way of tax. And so we've got to try<br />
and make sure that in looking after your interests that we<br />
make the decisions which are going to mean that we can provide<br />
the help to those who need it.<br />
So we addressed ourselves last year and into this year to<br />
this question of whether there was some relatively small<br />
section of the elderly who were perhaps getting assistance ./ 2 </p>
<p>P. M. cont.: where they really didn't need it so that we<br />
would be able to have more available for those who did need<br />
it. In other words, given the fact that the elderly section<br />
of our population is growing as a larger proportion of the<br />
Australian population, it simply isn't possible to have a<br />
situation where there'is a pension for everybody. irrespective<br />
of how very wealthy they may be. Some people may think that<br />
you should just give a pension to everyone, whether they<br />
are millionaires and whether they've got millions of dollars<br />
worth of property. Well I just say frankly that we can't<br />
do that, we're not going to do that. What we're going to<br />
do is try and organise our resources in a way which means<br />
we can do as much as we can for the great majority of<br />
the pensioner aged community who need help.<br />
So what we want to do, and I'm coming to a little bit more<br />
detail, to just what it means to you, what we want to do is<br />
to raise the value of the pension in real terms for the<br />
majority of : those who need it. And that is what the concept<br />
of the assets test has been about.<br />
Now what I want to say to you quite straightforwardly when<br />
I said from the very first day I became Prime Minister and<br />
head of this Government, I said to the people of Australia<br />
we won't go through office without making some mistakes.<br />
I want to say quite frankly, I've said it in the Parliament<br />
and I say it here, that when we first approached this question<br />
of the assets test we didn.' t make a first class job of it.<br />
We tried our intentions were totally correct to work<br />
out a way of seeing how we could in the fairest way not<br />
pay the full pension to those who didn't really needlit.<br />
And the first form of assets test was not the best way<br />
of doing it because there were too many uncertainties in it<br />
and people really weren't too sure whether they were going<br />
to be affected.<br />
So in February of this year when I got the feeling that there<br />
was this uncertainty in the community, I straightforwardly<br />
faced up to that, that we hadn't got it right the first time<br />
I said well we're not going ahead with something that we<br />
think isn't right. So I referred the question with the<br />
agreement of Cabinet, I referred the question to a representative<br />
committee headed by Professor Gruen. There were representatives<br />
of pensioner groups on it, of welfare organisations, Sir William<br />
Keys, the President of the RSL, agreed to serve on it we<br />
got a representative committee and it was very helpful to us.<br />
They pointed out the weaknesses and the uncertainties in the<br />
first way we'd gone about it or were proposing to go about it.<br />
They suggested another scheme which agAin in the end we didn't<br />
think we could accept entirely because it included in the<br />
concept of an assets test as to whether to get the full pension<br />
or not, it included the pensioner's home. Now we did have<br />
the view not only in respect of Sydney, where house values / 3 </p>
<p>arejhigher, we had the feeling that pensioners<br />
had a psychological attachment to the home. They didn't<br />
like the idea of counting their home among their assets.<br />
So we dedided that we would leave the home out. The home<br />
is not going to be counted in the assets test and I'm sure<br />
that you'd agree that that's the right thing to do.<br />
So what we've done is to come up now with a test which<br />
is going to affect very few people. There are approximately<br />
just over 2 million pensioners in Australia. Now the best<br />
calculations that our departments-directly involved, that's<br />
the Department of Social Security and the Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs, the best calculation that they can give<br />
us is that the number of people that will be be affected<br />
out of over 2 million pensioners will be about 40,000.<br />
That's about 40,000 people with. very very large accumulations<br />
of assets. And we think that that's fair because by not<br />
paying the full pension to those people it means that we're<br />
going to be in a position to do more for you, the great bulk<br />
of pensioners who need help.<br />
Now I'm prepared to face up to any audience in Australia<br />
anywhere and argue the correctness-and the justice of that<br />
case. I'doi't think there's going to be very many Australians<br />
who are going to say that it's not a fair thing for the very<br />
very wealthy, well-placedgroup we're not attacking them, we<br />
haven't got anything against them in any sense but I don't<br />
think anyon&amp;'. s going to say that it's not fair thatto make<br />
more available to help those who need it, that perhaps 40,000<br />
or 2% of the very wealthy are not going to get the part-pension<br />
or full pension. That's what it's about.<br />
The details of it I'll give you a broad outline<br />
of what's involved and how really there will be very<br />
little burden or intrusion on your life. First let me<br />
say this that in calculation of the asset your home, you<br />
don't have to worry yourself about the house at all. And<br />
then for those of you who are married couples with a house<br />
you are entitled to $ 100,000 worth of assets before you would<br />
be touched by the assets test at all.<br />
And for a single pensioner you'could have-your . house<br />
plus 70,000 of other assets.<br />
I would just like to add to that that we recognise that to<br />
some of those pensioners who doi'. t own their own home then<br />
they need to be taken a little bit more account of because<br />
there are some who haven't got their own homes, they rent<br />
a place, or they are living with their relatives: or they<br />
are in a nursing home they can have another $ 50,000 of<br />
assets, In other words a married couple who don't own<br />
their own home can have $ 150,000 assets or if they are<br />
affected a single pensioner $ 120,000 of assets. So you<br />
can see, and don't you agree, it's very very fair. </p>
<p>P. M. cont: The other thing is that-we don't want to<br />
be intrusive, we don't want to create a situation where you<br />
feel that you're going to have someone from the Department<br />
coming and prying into your affairs, We want to make it<br />
as least intrusive as we can so what we'gre done to help that<br />
is to say, well look in regard to the things in your house<br />
which represent your personal effects, your linen and all<br />
your furniture and so on, without having to go through and<br />
try and work it out, we've said letLs say~ that there's<br />
$ 10,000. You don't have to count those things. It: s only<br />
if you happen to think that you are ina situation as a married<br />
couple that you've got assets beyond your house of $ 100,000,<br />
if you think you're there then there's a way in which with<br />
a minimum of intrusion you will be able. to declare. and the'<br />
people in the Department will obviously in the great majority<br />
of. cases will say, well that's the end of it, there's no<br />
intrusion.<br />
And very early in the piece the great majority of pensioners,<br />
I think, will know without filling in any forms, that they<br />
are not going to be affected..<br />
Having said that about the test let me go on and say this<br />
to you that in the Budget which we'll be bringing down in<br />
August we'll be moving then to do more for you in the pensions<br />
area. We will do as you know there's the adjustments coming<br />
up for the change in the CPI, that adjustment will be made<br />
but I can say to you now-, I can't give you the details because<br />
we can't say before the Budget, I can assure you that we'll be<br />
moving in the Budget to do more than just giving you the<br />
adjustment for the CPI, there'll be more in the Budget than<br />
just that. And for those who may not own their own homes or who<br />
are renters there will be some additional and supplementary<br />
assistance for them.<br />
So my friends I think you will see that what my Government's<br />
been aboutis abbut oquity and fairness for the great majority,<br />
the overwhelming majority of pensioners. We want to do what<br />
we can to give you a better deal, You deserve it because<br />
of the contribution you have made to this country and I<br />
admit that we didn't get it quite right in the first place.<br />
I think you'll respect us more for acknowledging that and<br />
making sure we got it right in the end. I'm sure you'll agree<br />
that we have...<br />
And may I say Particularly how pleased I am to be here in your<br />
presence with David Charles, the Member for. Isaacs. I want<br />
to say to you that he's been a great Member for you. ini:<br />
representing not merely your interests but the interests of<br />
the electorate and this area generally. </p>
