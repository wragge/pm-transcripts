<p> I have written to Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President</p>
<p> asking him to release the two CARE workers who are not combatants,</p>
<p> they are humanitarian people who have been concerned about relieving</p>
<p> suffering humanity, not taking sides in a military conflict.</p>
<p>The letter was delivered to the President yesterday and I have asked</p>
<p> the former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, and the Chairman</p>
<p> of CARE Australia to return to Belgrade. In my letter I have asked</p>
<p> Slobodan Milosevic whether he will personally receive Mr Fraser in</p>
<p> relation to the representations we are making about the release of</p>
<p> Mr Pratt and Mr Wallace.</p>
<p>I hope they can be released. They should be released. We remain concerned</p>
<p> as a Government that they continue in detention and as I have said</p>
<p> repeatedly we are lending and bending every effort we can to secure</p>
<p> their release. And I say to their families, keep in good spirit, I</p>
<p> know it is very difficult for you in this stressful situation. The</p>
<p> Australian Government is doing all it can. Mr Fraser is leaving Australia</p>
<p> today and will be in Europe tomorrow and I hope that it will be possible</p>
<p> as the Australian Government's special envoy in relation to this</p>
<p> matter for him to see the President.</p>
