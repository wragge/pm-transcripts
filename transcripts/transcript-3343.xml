PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 294<br />
August 1974<br />
PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL REPORT ON PROPOSED INCREASES<br />
IN INTERSTATE FREIGHT RATES BY<br />
MAYNE NICKLESS LIMITED<br />
I have received the attached report dated 2 August<br />
of the Prices Justification Tribunal on proposals by<br />
Mayne Nickless Limited to increase interstate freight rates<br />
by 18 per cent.<br />
The Tribunal considers that an increase of only<br />
12 per cent would be justified, operating no earlier than<br />
August. In its submission, the company . relied principally on<br />
increased costs arising from the Consent Award of $ 25.40<br />
increase per week in the wages of drivers operative from<br />
the beginning of the first pay period commencing on or<br />
after 8 July. After close examination and reference to recent<br />
contested awards, the Tribunal was not satisfied that increases<br />
in wages beyond $ 16.00 per week could be regarded as a<br />
justifiable reason for raising prices. I note, however,<br />
that the Tribunal accepted cost increases resulting from the<br />
wage increases awarded in the National Wage Case.<br />
As foreshadowed by the Treasurer in his statement<br />
in the House of Representatives on inflation on 23 July,<br />
the Tribunal has been invited by the Government to scrutinise<br />
with care price claims that are based on wage costs in excess<br />
of awards. The Government is pleased that the Tribunal has<br />
acted in accord with the spirit of the Government's invitation.<br />
Those making " sweetheart" agreements have now been clearly<br />
warned. I fully agree with the Tribunal that " this is a<br />
burden which should properly be borne by those who agreed to<br />
the increases in wages rather than by requiring the community<br />
at large to carry the entire amount."<br />
