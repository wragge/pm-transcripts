    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST: Tony Abbot would like to debate you on the ETS. Will you debate Mr Abbott?</p>
<p>PM: You know, here we are in Australia, one of the hottest and driest continents on Earth. Climate change is the great challenge of our generation.</p>
<p>Despite our differences, Mr Howard had a policy on climate change, as did Mr Turnbull. It was called an emissions trading scheme. I have a policy on climate change. It's called an emissions trading scheme.</p>
<p>Mr Abbott, the current leader of the Liberal Party, does not have any policy on climate change. I'd suggest that the current Leader of the Opposition calms down, puts in the hard yards and actually develops a policy on climate change.</p>
