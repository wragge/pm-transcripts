FOR PR SSS: PM. NO. 74/ 1969<br />
HIGH COURT JUDGMENT ON STAMP DUTY<br />
EXCHANG3 OF CORR ESPONDENC3 BETWEEN PRIME MINISTSR<br />
AND SIR HSNRY BOLTS<br />
Following are texts of the letters exchanged between the P ime Minister, Mr.<br />
John Gorton, and the Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, in regard to the High<br />
Court judgment on stamp duty: 2R September, 1969<br />
" The Righ: Honourable John G. Gorton, M. P.,<br />
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.<br />
Dear Mr. Gorton,<br />
I %; riteto you on behalf of all the State Premiers, who have met<br />
together in Melbourne today to consider the implications of the recent<br />
High Court decision inThe Stat? of NWestern Australia v Hamersley<br />
Iron Pty. Ltd.<br />
W'e have had the benefit of a careful consideration of the judgments<br />
and their implications by our Solicitors-General and Under ' Treasurers<br />
and their advice to us in the light of that considration.<br />
This advice confirms our fears that the terms of the judgments are<br />
such that, if the d-. cision prevails, the lhgislation in all S ates in<br />
relation to stamp duty on receipts must be considered to be beyond<br />
State legislative pov; er, at least in respect of the r eceipt of money for<br />
the sale of goods, In practical terms this places at immediate risk<br />
revenue amounting to some 7C to 73 million dollars in a full year for all<br />
States, and this is at a time when all States are already experiencing<br />
acute budgetary problems.<br />
The S: ate of West-rn Australia is making application to the High<br />
Court of Australia for a certificate granting leave to appeal to the Privy<br />
Council in the I-IHamersley case. It is expected that this application<br />
will be heard in Melbourne on Octo'ver 7th, 19.9, or soon aftervwards. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The States will all seek to appear on the application to intimate to<br />
the High Court that their support Westem Australia and that, if a<br />
certificate is granted, they will seek leave to intervene in the Privy<br />
Council hearing.<br />
On behalf of all the Premiers I now ask that you should, on behalf<br />
of your Government, authorise the Solicitor-General for WVestern<br />
Australia to intimate to the High Court that the Commonwealth also<br />
supports the application of WVestern Australia.<br />
We have discussed the matter of subsequent action which may be<br />
n'cessary but it "' ould be premature to raise this V: ith you until the<br />
outcome of th application is known. Hovfev r, the Premiers " werc<br />
gratified to know that you v. ould b? pr-parc-i to me-t them at short<br />
notice to discuss the situation.<br />
The immediate problem hovwever is the application to the High Court<br />
and I '' ould be glad to have your decision on the request v'e have put in<br />
the previous paragraph as a matter of urgency. Yours sincerely,<br />
HENRY BOLrE,<br />
Premier and Treasurer.<br />
29th Sptember, 1969<br />
" Dear Sir Henry,<br />
I refer to your letter of 28th September, written on behalf of all the<br />
State Premiers, about the recent High Court decision in the State of<br />
Western Australia v Harmersley Iron Pty. Ltd. The view taken by the<br />
Commonwealth Government in this matter is:-<br />
1. The Commonwealth has abolished appeals from the<br />
High Court to the Privy Council in all Federal matters<br />
except '" inter se" cases.<br />
2. It is therefore still legally possible for the H.. gh Court<br />
to allov, appeal to the Privy Council in " inter se" matters<br />
if it so desires. And the r.: lcent jud'ment of the High<br />
Court in the Stamp Duty case is an " inter se" matter. / 3 </p>
<p>The judgment raises questions of great importance to<br />
the States, and to their Budgets and capacity to raise<br />
taxation. For that reason it also raises matters of great<br />
importance to the Commonwealth.<br />
4. The Commonwealth believes the question should be<br />
settled as quickly as possible so that the Stat. es may<br />
know exactly where they stand and so that discussions<br />
betvween the Commonwealth and the S: ates v'hich will<br />
be necessary if the High Court's judgment prevails<br />
may begin as soon as possible.<br />
Every S. ate Government is seeking leave to appeal, under<br />
the provisions of Section 74 of the Constitution and<br />
because of this, and because of the importance of this<br />
matter to all State Governments and th-Commonwealth,<br />
we agree that it is proper for th.: States to make the<br />
application and wvill a" ait the outcome : ith great<br />
interest. Yours sincerely,<br />
J. G. GORTON<br />
The Hon. Sir Henry Bolte, M. L. A.,<br />
Premier of Victoria.<br />
