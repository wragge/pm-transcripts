    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Mr Peter Fogarty to my colleague, Eoin</p>
<p>   Cameron the Member for Stirling, ladies and gentleman.</p>
<p>I'm quite excited about this company because it's a wonderful</p>
<p>   demonstration of a number of very positive things about modern Australia.</p>
<p>   The first and most exciting thing about this company is its multi-racial</p>
<p>   workforce. As I moved around I met people from so many different</p>
<p>   countries particularly but not only from the countries of Asia.</p>
<p>   And I take this opportunity in the presence of such a multi-racial</p>
<p>   workforce which is doing such a tremendous job to say to those people</p>
<p>   who've come from other countries, particularly but not only</p>
<p>   from Asia, how very welcome you are here and how much I as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister regard you all as part and parcel of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   This country is as much your country as it is mine and that you</p>
<p>   are making a magnificent contribution to Australia. You are bringing</p>
<p>   skills and you are bringing a diversity and a richness to modern</p>
<p>   Australian life that all of your fellow Australians appreciate very</p>
<p>   very warmly.</p>
<p>So the first thing that does really strike me is the great diversity.</p>
<p>   And you should feel so welcome and feel that your contribution to</p>
<p>   this company, but more importantly, your contribution to our Australia</p>
<p>   is very very warmly appreciated and very widely respected. </p>
<p>This company has been a tremendous modern success. It's demonstrated</p>
<p>   that Australian ingenuity, Australian inventive capacity and Australian</p>
<p>   research energy is the equal if not the better than any in the rest</p>
<p>   of the world. Given the size of this company, what it has achieved</p>
<p>   has been quite remarkable and the fact that you are able, Mr Fogarty,</p>
<p>   to properly boast that so many of those transactions on your material</p>
<p>   at any given time of the day or any given day of the year is a remarkable</p>
<p>   tribute to the way in which from here in Australia the quality and</p>
<p>   the skill of Australian achievement has spread all around the world.</p>
<p>Now that has happened because the company is run on modern lines.</p>
<p>   It's a very modern, clean welcoming work environment and that's</p>
<p>   very important. There is an obvious rapport between the management</p>
<p>   and the staff. You are all part of one team, there's not them</p>
<p>   and us, it's just all of us together trying to achieve a goal</p>
<p>   for the company and trying to achieve a goal for Australia. And</p>
<p>   I'm glad that some of the Government policies already in place</p>
<p>   have played a part in the success that has been achieved by this</p>
<p>   company, the export orders it has won for Australia and the penetration</p>
<p>   to the four corners of the earth of Australian technology and Australian</p>
<p>   achievement and the fruits of Australian research and development.</p>
<p>But I've got even better news for you ladies and gentleman</p>
<p>   and that is that the tax reform plan of the Government is going</p>
<p>   to make companies like this even more successful because the greatest</p>
<p>   beneficiary of our tax reform plan on the business front are companies</p>
<p>   that export. And one of the great things about our plan is that</p>
<p>   it's going to take about $4.5 billion off the cost of exporting</p>
<p>   goods and services around the world. And when I say that the plan</p>
<p>   is good for Australia I mean by that that it will make Australia</p>
<p>   more competitive because it will reduce the cost of doing business</p>
<p>   in Australia. And I'm quite certain that your accountants and</p>
<p>   your financial controllers are already calculating the advantages</p>
<p>   of being able to recover all of the taxes paid on their business</p>
<p>   inputs in preparing for export out of Australia the goods and services</p>
<p>   that this company produces. Because under our plan exports will</p>
<p>   not carry any goods and services tax at all. And that will give</p>
<p>   us a competitive advantage in winning markets around the world that</p>
<p>   we don't have at the present time. And people sometimes say</p>
<p>   to me can we have an export market development grant for this or</p>
<p>   that activity. This plan is a $4.5 billion export market development</p>
<p>   grant every year of every year for every company in Australia that</p>
<p>   exports. </p>
<p>Now we all know that the future of Australia lies in exports. We</p>
<p>   are a small country, we're happy country, we're a stable</p>
<p>   country. It's the best place in the world to live. But we are</p>
<p>   still by world standards quite small and we've got to always</p>
<p>   be competitive. And that means that we've got to make sure</p>
<p>   our domestic costs are as low as possible, consistent with maintaining</p>
<p>   the good standard of living that Australian workers are entitled</p>
<p>   to. So that means we've always got to sell well abroad and</p>
<p>   anything you can do to reduce the costs of exports is good for Australia.</p>
<p>   So our proposals are a long-term plan for the future of Australia.</p>
<p>   We all have to worry about the medium to longer term. We can dwell</p>
<p>   on the past, if we want to we can derive some nostalgia and warmth</p>
<p>   from the past. We of course live with the present but we've</p>
<p>   always got to plan for the future. And this country's economic</p>
<p>   future lies in maximising the assets it has and this wonderfully</p>
<p>   diverse skilled workforce that works together so well is a great</p>
<p>   resource. The technology you have in this company is a great resource.</p>
<p>   The management cooperation between the management and the workforce</p>
<p>   is a great resource. The assistance you now get from government</p>
<p>   is a great resource. But there can be more assistance and a pro-export,</p>
<p>   pro-lower business cost taxation plan will also be an enormous resource.</p>
<p>When I go around the country saying this plan is good for Australia,</p>
<p>   it's good for Australia because it's going to make all</p>
<p>   our companies and our industries more competitive because it's</p>
<p>   going to reduce their business costs and make it cheaper for them</p>
<p>   to export and that means more jobs. More gatherings like this, larger</p>
<p>   gatherings such as this and a greater share of the export markets</p>
<p>   of the world.</p>
<p>And last and most important thing I want to say is that it is always</p>
<p>   uplifting and inspiring to visit a workplace, to see success, to</p>
<p>   see people of different ethnic backgrounds working harmoniously</p>
<p>   together as Australians - as Australians - and to see the cooperation</p>
<p>   and the camaraderie between the management of the company and the</p>
<p>   people who work in the company. It is the most exhilarating experience</p>
<p>   about being Prime Minister of Australia to have these opportunities.</p>
<p>   They are endless cameos of the success of modern Australia and they</p>
<p>   are a great experience and a source of great encouragement and joy</p>
<p>   to me and I thank the management for inviting me and I thank all</p>
<p>   of you for having me here. I thank you for the contribution that</p>
<p>   you make to our country. I wish the company and I wish all who work</p>
<p>   here and their families the very best of good fortune and health</p>
<p>   and happiness in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
