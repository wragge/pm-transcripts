APPROPRIATION BILL<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
17 APRIL 1975<br />
JUST OVER FIVE MONTHS AGO, ON 12 NOVEMBER 1974, 1<br />
ANNOUNCED TO THE HOUSE A SERIES OF ECONOMIC MEASURES WHICH<br />
SUPPLEMENTED ACTION ALREADY TAKEN IN THE BUDGET. THE<br />
MEASURES HAD FOUR OBJECTIVES:-<br />
FIRSTLY, TO MAINTAIN CONSUMER DEMAND THROUGH<br />
A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN PERSONAL INCOME TAXa<br />
SECONDLY, TO ATTACK INFLATION BY REDUCING THE<br />
PRESSURE FOR WAGE INCREASES THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX TAKE-HOME PAY THIS YEARS<br />
THIRDLY, TO ENHANCE BUSINESS PROFITABILITY BY A<br />
REDUCTION IN COMPANY TAX AND OTHER MEASURES.<br />
FOURT'HLY, TO SUPPORT PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES WHERE<br />
SPECIAL PROBLEMS WERE EMERGING,<br />
ANNOUNCING THESE MEASURES IWARNED THAT IT WOULD<br />
TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME FOR THE MEASURES TO TAKE THEIR FULL<br />
EFFECT AND THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THE FIGURES' UNEMPLOYMENT*<br />
THE COST OF LIVING INDEX -' WOULD NOT BE GOOD, WE ARE NOW<br />
BEGINNING TO SEE THE UP-TURN WHICH WE HAVE SOUGHT SO EARNESTLY. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
APART FROM THEIR DOMESTIC SIGNIFICANCE THE FIGURES<br />
SERVE TO REMIND US OF THE OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTIC OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S PRESENT ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES THEY ARE<br />
INTERNATIONAL, THEY ARE WORLD-WIDE IN CHARACTER AND<br />
WORLD-WIDE IN INCIDENCEY GOVERNMENB IN COMPARABLE COUNTRIES<br />
ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE TWIN PROBLEMS OF HIGH'UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
AND RAPID INFLATIONj MOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE ADOPTED MEASURES<br />
SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, ALL<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS-NO SINGLE OR SIMPLE SOLUTION FOR<br />
OUR COMMON PROBLEMSK NO GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MORE ENERGETIC<br />
IN THE QUEST FOR A SOLUTION OR MORE FLEXIBLE IN ITS<br />
APPROACH THAN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTi<br />
THE EXTRAORDINARY SPEED WITH WHICH ECONOMIC<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN ALL MODERN MIXED ECONOMIES REQUIRES<br />
AN ALTOGETHER NEW DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN ECONOMIC<br />
DECISION-MAKING WE DO NOT INTEND TO BE SCARED OFF FRQM<br />
MAKING NEEDED AND PROPER CHANGES BY CHEAP CHARGES OF<br />
INCONSISTENCYy ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES HERE AND THROUGHOUT<br />
THE WORLD ARE NOW SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGE NEVER EXPERIENCED<br />
IN OUR LIFETIMES/ THE BUSINESS CYCLE WHICH USED TO TAKE<br />
FIVE TO. SEV. EN YEARS FOR ITS COMPLETION NOW APPEARS TO TAKE<br />
ABOUT TWO YEARSA THIS IMPOSES UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURES ON<br />
GOVERNMENTS AND REQUIRES VERY GREAT FLEXIBILITY IN POLICY<br />
PLANNING,. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
IN THIS SITUATION ONE HAS TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL IN<br />
MAKING PREDICTIONS BASED ON THE LATEST SET OF ECONOMIC<br />
INDICATORS, WE MUST BEWARE OF FALSE DAWNS.<br />
NONETHELESS, THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR SOME CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM,<br />
THE SITUATION AT PRESENT IS THAT SOME OF THE MORE SERIOUS<br />
ASPECTS OF DECLINE IN ACTIVITY ARE NOW BEHIND US. CREDIT<br />
IS FREELY AYAILABLE AND THE DEMAND FOR FUNDS, PARTICULARLY<br />
FOR'HOUSING, IS HIGH, IMPORTS ARE NO LONGER EXCESSIVE<br />
AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SITUATION PARTICULARLY ON<br />
CURRENT ACCOUNT IS STRENGTHENING. WE ARE SEEING THE<br />
FIRST REAL SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN EMPLOYMENT. WITH THE<br />
LARGE PERSONAL TAX CUTS, INCLUDING THE HOUSING INTEREST<br />
DEDUCTIBILITY SCHEME NOW BEING REFLECTED IN PAY PACKETS,<br />
DISPOSABLE INCOMES ARE RISING STRONGLY.<br />
THIS FOUNDATION FOR RECOVERY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY<br />
NEW MEASURES TAKEN SINCE THE BUDGET. INEVITABLY THE RiTIMATES<br />
OF EXPENDITURE AND RECEIPTS CONTAINED IN THE BUDGET HAVE<br />
BEEN AMENDED. WE MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR THAT, JUST AS'WE MAKE<br />
NO APOLOGY FOR THE POST-BUDGET MEASURES THEMSELVES, THE<br />
INCREASED ESTIMATED DEFICIT IS THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF<br />
THOSE MEASURES. THE BUDGET ITSELF WAS CRITICISED LAST<br />
SEPTEMBER AS BEING TOO EXPANSIONARY. WITH HINDSIGHT, WE<br />
CAN SEE THAT IT WAS NOT EXPANSIONARY ENOUGH. </p>
<p>THAT DEFICIENCY HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN CORRECTED. THE<br />
DEFICIT IS NOW ESTIMATED AS MOST LIKELY TO BE OF THE<br />
ORDER OF $ 2,300 MILLION WITH A DOMESTIC DEFICIT OF ABOUT<br />
$ 1,660 MILLION. THAT DEFICIT HAS TO BE PUT IN THE<br />
PERSPECTIVE OF THE SEPARATE ITEMS WHICH COMPOSE IT. THE<br />
CRY NOW IS THAT GOVERNMENT SPENDING MUST BE CUT. THE<br />
FACT IS THAT THE REALLY BIG ITEMS WHERE SPENDING HAS BEEN<br />
INCREASED. MOST, COMPARED WITH THE BUDGET ESTIMATE, ARE<br />
PRECISELY THOSE WHICH ARE CONTRIBUTING MOST TO THE<br />
RECOVERY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
LET US LOOK AT THE DETAILS. LET THE OPPOSITION<br />
DECLARE THAT IT WOULD CUT SPENDING ON THESE ITEMS. HIGHFLOWN<br />
GENERALISATIONS ABOUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING ARE NOT<br />
ENOUGH. SPENDING ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE IS UP<br />
$ 210 MILLION ON THE BUDGET ESTIMATE. WOULD THE OPPOSITION<br />
* DENY THE CORRECTNESS OF OUR PENSIONS INCREASE BOTH IN<br />
HUMAN TERMS AND ECONOMIC TERMS? SPENDING ON HOUSING IS UP<br />
$ 234 MILLIONS. DOES THE OPPOSITION CLAIM THAT THIS IS<br />
ILL-DIRECTED EITHER SOCIALLY OR ECONOMICALLY? 115/ 8 </p>
<p>ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY IS UP $ 377 MILLION ON<br />
THE BUDGET ESTIMATE. DOES THE COUNTRY PARTY DEPLORE<br />
OUR ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRIES OR THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
DENOUNCE OUR ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY?<br />
PAYMENTS TO THE STATES AND FOR NATURAL DISASTER<br />
RELIEF ARE UP $ 224 MILLION ON THE BUDGET ESTIMATE.<br />
IS THIS, INCLUDING DARWIN RELIEF, AN. AREA WHERE THE<br />
OPPOSITION WOULD CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING?<br />
EDUCATION IS UP $ 103 MILLION, IS THIS WHERE THE<br />
CUT SHOULD BE MADE?<br />
DEFENCE SPENDING IS UP $ 142 MILLION. SHOULD WE<br />
HAVE PARED HERE? 6/. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THERE IS OF COURSE ONE AREA OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING<br />
-READILY IDENTIFIABLE, READILY MARKED FOR THE AXE. THAT<br />
IS THE SPENDING INVOLVED IN THE NEW PROGRAMS INSTITUTED BY<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THOSE<br />
AUSTRALIANS WHO HAVE THE LEAST POLITICAL LEVERAGE, THEY<br />
ARE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE POLITICALLY DISPENSABLE BECAUSE<br />
THEIR BENEFICIARIES ARE POLITICALLY EXPENDABLE, THERE IS<br />
A READY-MADE LIST OF EXPENDABLE PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS<br />
IMPERILLED BY THE HG1H COURT CHALLENGE ON THE<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN<br />
AND THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEME, ALL THESE<br />
PROGRAMS BENEFIT THE RELATIVELY INARTICULATE OR<br />
UNDER-PRIVILEGED IN OUR COMMUNITY, THEY HAVE A SOCIAL AND<br />
HUMAN VALUE FAR BEYOND THEIR FINANCIAL COST, IN ITSELF<br />
RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE GREAT TRADITIONAL AREAS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT SPENDING, To CUT THEM WOULD HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT<br />
ECONOMIC EFFECT BUT IT WOULD MAKE A GESTURE IN THE<br />
DIRECTION OF THOSE DEMANDING CUTS IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING,<br />
THAT LOBBY IS VOCAL AND WELL ORGANISED; THE AUSTRALIANS<br />
WHO BENEFIT UNDER THESE PROGRAMS ARE NEITHER, I SUGGEST<br />
IT IS UPON THESE PROGRAMS AND UPON THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM<br />
THEM THAT THE-OPPOSITION WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THE<br />
GREAT AXE FALL, </p>
<p>-7-<br />
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER RECEIPTS ARE<br />
DOWN BY $ 307 MILLION ON THE BUDGET ESTIMATES. WHY?<br />
BECAUSE OF TAX CUTS ADDITIONAL TO THOSE MADE IN THE<br />
BUDGET. WE HAVE FOREGONE A FURTHER $ 230 MILLION NET<br />
IN REVENUE FROM PERSONAL TAXATION AND $ 105 MILLION IN<br />
COMPANY TAXATION. DOES THE OPPOSITION 1 EJECT THESE<br />
CONCESSIONS?* SHOULD WE HAVE INCREASED TAXATION TO<br />
REDUCE THE DEFICIT? SHOULD WE HAVE INCREASED TAXATION<br />
TO SATISFY THE DOGMA-THAT DEFICIT BUDGETING IS' INTRINSICALILY<br />
IRRESPONSIBLE? IF OPPOSITION SPOKESMEN WILL SPECIFY ONE AREA WHERE<br />
A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN SPENDING SHOULD HAVE BEEN<br />
MADE EITHER ON THE GROUNDS OF ECONOMIC PRUDENCE OR SOCIAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY THEN WE MIGHT TAKE MORE SER IOUSLY THEIR<br />
FOR REDUCED GOVERNMENT SPENDING,. YET. PRATHER THAN<br />
DO THIS THEIR COMPLAINTS ON SPECIFIC ISSU ES IMPLY NOT 4<br />
REDUCED'GOVERNMENT SPENDING BUT INCREASED GOVERNMENT<br />
SPENDING. WHAT ELSE* IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEMANDS BY<br />
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION FOR INCREASED DEFENCE SPENDING.<br />
OR BY THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY PARTY FOR EVEN MORE<br />
GENEROUS ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY THAN WE ARE ALREADY<br />
PROVIDING. THE FACT IS THAT THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE<br />
INCREASED EXPENDITURE OR FOREGONE REVENUE ARE ALL SOCIALLY<br />
ESSENTIAL AND IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY WERE MADE<br />
ECONOMICALLY CORRECT. THEf EXPANSION UPON THE SEPTEMBER<br />
BUDGET HAS BEEN THE CORRECT COURSE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
UNDER WHICH IT WAS UNDERTAKEN. 188/. </p>
<p>WE HAVE THUS ACHIEVED NOT FULL RECOVERY BUT THE<br />
CHANCE FOR FULL REVOVERY, THE OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN<br />
HARD-WON, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT LIKE ALL RESPONSIBLE<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN COMPARABLE COUNTRIES HAS HAD TO MAKE DIFFICULT<br />
DECISIONS AND THERE WILL BE A CONTINUING NEED FOR MORE<br />
DIFFICULT DECISIONS; BUT THE IMPORTANTTHING IS THAT THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY ALL AUSTRALIANS HAVE EARNED SHOULD NOT BE LOST.<br />
THE FACT REMAINS THAT IN 1975 THE REAL DANGER OF A RESURGENCE<br />
OF THE RATE OF INFLATION AND THE REAL DANGER OF A DOWN-TURN<br />
IN EMPLOYMENT WOULD COME FROM WAGE DEMANDS, GREATER THAN<br />
THE ABILITY OF THE ECONQMY TO ABSORB, THIS IS THE REAL<br />
MESSAGE THAT THE TREASURER AND I HAVE TRIED TO CONVEY TO<br />
EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS1 THE WHOLE OBJECT OF<br />
THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX CUTS, OF OUR SUPPORT FOR WAGE<br />
INDEXATION AND THE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE<br />
ACHIEVED IN THE PROVISION OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, PUBLIC<br />
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNITY SERVICES HAS BEEN TO SUSTAIN ANDI<br />
RAISE THE REAL STANDARD OF LIVING OF FAMILIES BEYOND THAT<br />
PROVIDED BY THE PAY-PACKET ALONE, OUR'OBJECT IS TO REDUCE<br />
. THE NEED FOR VAST WAGE INCREASES WHICH INDIVIDUALS AND<br />
FAMILIES FEEL OBLIGED TO DEMAND IN ORDER TO CHASE RISING.<br />
PRICES AND'MAINTAIN THEIR LIVING STANDARDS. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS THE MORE ENTITLED TO<br />
EXPECT CO-OPERATION INSOFAR AS WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN<br />
OUR EFFORTS TO RAISE REAL STANDARDS AND REAL EARNINGS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN-EMPLOYEES, THAT IS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS. ,19/, </p>
<p>-9-<br />
INCOMES OF WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS HAVE GROWN<br />
CONSISTENTLY FASTER THAN THE COST OF LIVING SINCE<br />
DECEMBER 1972. BETWEEN THE DECEMBER QUARTER 1972 AND<br />
THE DECEMBER QUARTER 1974:-<br />
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX INCREASED BY<br />
31.6 PER CENT,<br />
AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS INCREASED BY<br />
46.8 PER CENT TO $ 146.90,<br />
SAVERAGE MINIMUM WEEKLY AWARD WAGE RATES<br />
FOR MALES INCREASED BY 53 PER CENT TO<br />
$ 104 PER WEEK,<br />
AVERAGE MINIMUM WEEKLY AWARD WAGE RATES<br />
FOR FEMALES INCREASED BY 75 PER CENT TO<br />
$ 91 PER WEEK.<br />
REAL AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS, BEFORE TAX,'<br />
INCREASED BY 11.5 PER CENT. 0<br />
REAL AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS, AFTER TAX,<br />
INCREASED BY 7.3 PER CENT. </p>
<p>THESE FIGURES FURTHER POINT TO THE BASIC STRENGTH<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AND THE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE<br />
-OF OUR NATIONAL POLICIES IN MEETING THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD ECONOMY. ISHALL GIVE SOME* KEY<br />
COMPARISONS: -WHEREAS IN AUSTRALIA.. REAL AVERAGE WEEKLY<br />
EARNINGS BEFORE TAX-INCREASED BY 11.5 PER CENT<br />
JN THE TWO YEARS DECEMBER 1972 DECEMBER 1974,<br />
IN THE U. S. THERE WAS A DECLINE OF 5.8 PER CENT&amp;<br />
-IN THE CALENDAR YEAR 1974, AUSTRALIAN GROSS<br />
DOMESTIC* PRODUCT GREW BY 1.7 PER CENT IN REAL<br />
TERMS COMPARED WITH THE PRECEDING CALENDAR<br />
YEAR 1973. IN THE SAME PERIOD THERE WAS A<br />
DECLINE IN THE U. S. OF 2.2 PER CENT; IN JAPAN<br />
OF 3.7 PER CENT AND IN GREAT BRITAIN OF 0.2 PER CENT.<br />
IN WEST GERMANY THERE WAS A' MARGINAL INCREASE OF'<br />
0.4 PER CENT.-IN THE OECD NATIONS AS A WHOLE<br />
THERE WAS A DECLINE OF 0.3 PER CENT IN REAL<br />
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.<br />
THERE IS NO SUGGESTION IN ALL THIS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS COMPLACENT, BUT THE FIGURES DO SUGGEST THAT<br />
CONFIDENCE IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY IS WELL FOUNDED. THE<br />
KEY TO ECONOMIC REVIVAL THI. S YEAR IS THE'REVIVAL OF<br />
CONFIDENCE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE MEASURES TAKEN BY<br />
THE GOVERNMENT. IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS ESTABLISH A GOOD<br />
BASIS FOR THAT CONFIDENCE. 11/. </p>
<p>-1-<br />
IN'SEPTEMBER, NOVEMBER AND JANUARY, WE TOOK MEASURES<br />
APPROPRIATE FOR EXISTING AND EMERGING CONDITIONS. WE<br />
SHALL CONTINUE THAT APPROACH, THE APPROACH OF A<br />
RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVE TO THE<br />
NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY, RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF ALL<br />
SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, RESPONSIBLE IN MAKING THE<br />
DECISIONS TO. MEET THOSE NEEDS, </p>
