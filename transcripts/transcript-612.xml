COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT TUTE CONCLUSION OF TH COMMONI\ JEALTH<br />
PR. IME MINISTERS CONFERENCE I IIN , O'iDON ON 19<br />
SEPTEMBERv, 162<br />
The meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was concluded<br />
today. This was the first occasio i on which Sierra Leone,<br />
Tanganyika, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have been represented,<br />
as independent countries, at a Commonwealth meeting, and tha<br />
presence of their Prime Ministers, together representing 15 million<br />
people who have achieved independence since the last Commonwealth<br />
meeting in 1961, was welcomed by the other Commonwealth Governments.<br />
During the course of the meeting the Prime Ministers were<br />
informed that Uganda, with a population of nearly 7 million, will<br />
attain independence in October, 1962, and they agreed that Uganda<br />
should then be admitted to membership of the Commonwealth.<br />
They also noted with satisfaction the great progress made<br />
towards the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia by 31st<br />
August, 1963. This would enable the State of Singapore, the<br />
Territories of North Borneo and Sarawak and, it is hoped, the<br />
State of Brunei, with a combined population of about 3 million,<br />
to achieve independence as part of the enlarged Federation.<br />
They were informed that Tanganyika would adopt a republican<br />
form of constitution in December, 1962, and they agreed that Tanganyika<br />
should thereafter remain a member of the Commonwealth as a<br />
republic. In the course of their discussions, the Prime Ministers<br />
have taken the opportunity to hold their customary review of<br />
internationalaffairs and have exchanged views on the political<br />
situation in various parts of the world. They took note, in<br />
particular, of the proposals relating to the Congo which were<br />
recently put forward by the Acting Secretary-General of the United<br />
Nations, and they expressed the hope that these would prove to be<br />
the basis for a speedy and constructive settlement,<br />
The Prime Ministers agreed that the need for disarmament<br />
had been intensified by the steady development of ever more powerful<br />
weapons. They reaffirmed the principles laid down in their<br />
statement on disarmament of 17th March, 1961, and expressed their<br />
conviction that the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee at<br />
Geneva should continue its efforts towards a treaty for general<br />
and complete disarmament in accordance with these principles.<br />
They noted that discussions on the cessation of nuclear weapons<br />
tests had also been taking place in Geneva and expressed the hope<br />
that these efforts would be successful in bringing into being an<br />
effective treaty to eradicate this source of fear and danger to<br />
mankind. The primary object of this meeting was, however, to review<br />
the progress made in the negotiations in Brussels about the conditions<br />
on which Britain might join the European Economic Community,<br />
and to examine the nature and prospects of safeguards for the trade<br />
of other Commonwealth countries. The greater part of the meeting<br />
has been devoted to the discussion of this complex question.<br />
Although this discussion has disclosed many differences of viewpoint<br />
and many uncertainties, all the exchanges have been conducted in<br />
the frank and friendly atmosphere which characterises Commonwealth ./ 2 </p>
<p>meetings. This has reaffirmed the common determination to strengthe1<br />
the links between the countries of the Comnonwealth.<br />
The Prime Ministers declared that, in all the countries of<br />
the Commonwealth, the constant objective of policy is to promote<br />
peace and economic progress throughout the world and thus to help<br />
to create conditions in which mankind can flourish in freedom,<br />
unfettered by poverty, ignorance or disease. In furtherance of<br />
this purpose, all Commonwealth Governments are resolved to do their<br />
utmost to foster the harmonious development and steady expansion of<br />
world trade, They note with concern that trade and industry in the<br />
developing countries, as well as in some of the more developed<br />
countries which are large producers of primary products for export,<br />
have been adversely affected by widely fluctuating commodity prices<br />
and a progressive worsening of the terms of trade. They see this<br />
as a problem which calls for progressive policies in relation to<br />
international trade and finance so that demand for the products of<br />
those countries can be sustained and increased, and larger and<br />
more dependable trade outlets assured to them,<br />
To meet the needs of the developing countries they will<br />
support policies designed to raise the living standards of the<br />
peoples of these countries and to help them to achieve the<br />
economic, social and cultural progress to which they aspire, To<br />
this end they consider that improved opportunities and conditions<br />
for trade are even more important than financial aid, They<br />
recognise the need for the developing countries to have eas r access<br />
to outside markets for the products of their industries as they<br />
become established and the desirability of this being reflocted in<br />
the policies of the more developed countries.<br />
To meet the needs of the producers of agricultural<br />
commodities, Commonwealth Gcvernments will support policies and<br />
initiatives designed to maintain and expand world trade in those<br />
commodities and to improve the organisation of the world market in<br />
a manner fair alike to producers and to consumers. They will<br />
support a fresh and vigorous approach to the negotiation of international<br />
commodity agreements to this end. In any such approach<br />
principles of price, production and trade access aiould need to be<br />
applied, on a commodity by commodity basis, so as to encourage<br />
maximum consumption without over-stimulating production and to<br />
offer to efficient producing countries adequate access and stable<br />
prices at a fair and reascnabl] leve.. They believe that, in the<br />
disposal of any surplus of agricultural products, opportunity<br />
should be taken, to the fullest extent compatible with the legitimate<br />
interests of traditional suppliers, to meet the needs of those<br />
peoples of the world who are in want.<br />
The Prime Ministers expressed the readiness of their<br />
Governments to join in comprehensive international efforts by<br />
all available means to expand world trade in both primary products<br />
and manufactures. They recognised the important contribution<br />
which the European Economic Community and other regional groups<br />
could make in such efforts. They hoped that the general objectives<br />
set out above would be shared by the rccmbors of the European Economic<br />
Community. They also took note, in this connection, that legislation<br />
was at present before the United States Congress which could<br />
materially assist in this aim,<br />
The Prime Ministers were informed of and considered the<br />
stage reached in Britain's negotiations with the European Economic<br />
Community, and discussed the arrangements which might be made to<br />
meet the special needs of other Cormmonwoelth countries if Britain<br />
joined the Community. 0* 0 * J C.*/ 3 </p>
<p>British Ministers. st out the broad political and<br />
economic considerations which had led the British Government<br />
to initiate the negotiations in Brussels' They emphasised that,<br />
in the view of the British Government, Britain's accession to the<br />
Community on satisfactory terms would have the result of<br />
strengthening the po. sition of Britain, of the Commonwealth and<br />
of Europe, They explained in detail the position so far reached<br />
in the negotiations in Brussel. and emphasised the principal<br />
points among the many provisional arrangements which had been<br />
worked out. In the first place, an offer of association on<br />
advantageous economic terms was open to Commonwealth countries<br />
in Africa and the Caribbean and the majority of British independent<br />
territories. Should certain of the countries not become<br />
associated, the provisional agreement reached in Brussels offered<br />
further discussion in the course of the negotiations with a view<br />
to the possible conclusion of other arrangements.<br />
Secondly, the Community were prepared to negotiate as<br />
soon as possible trade agreements with India, Pakistan and Ceylon<br />
which would have the declared objective of developing mutual trade<br />
to maintain and, as much as possible, to increase the level of<br />
their foreign currency receipts and in general facilitate the<br />
implementation of their development plans.<br />
Thirdly, as regards temperate products, the enlarged<br />
Community would make, at the time of British accession, two<br />
important declarations. One would express their intention to<br />
initiate discussions on international commodity agreements for<br />
temperate foodstuffs on a world basis. It would recognise the<br />
greatly increased responsibilities of the enlarged Community by<br />
reason of its predominant position amongst world importers.<br />
The second declaration would relate to the price policy of the<br />
Community. While taking appropriate measures to raise the individual<br />
earnings of those engaged in agriculture in the Community,<br />
the Community would do its utmost to contribute to a harmonious<br />
development of world trade providing for a satisfactory level<br />
of trade between the Community and third countries, including<br />
Commuonwealth countries.<br />
British Ministers considered that the policy which the<br />
enlarged Community intended to pursue would offer reasonable<br />
opportunities in its markets for exports of temperate agricultural<br />
products. The representatives of other Commonwealth Governments<br />
wdlcomed this opportunity for personal consulation on this issue<br />
and for supplementing the exchanges of information and consultation<br />
which had already taken place between Ministers and officials.<br />
They took note of the considerations which had influenced the<br />
British Government in deciding to accede to the iLropcan Economic<br />
Community if satisfactory terms could be secured. They recognised<br />
that, after full and continuing consultation with the other<br />
countries of the Commonwealth and in the light of the further<br />
negotiations to be held with the members of the Community, the<br />
responsibility for the final decision would rest with the British<br />
Government. The representatives of the other Commonwealth countries<br />
freely acknowledged the strenuous efforts which the British Government<br />
have made to ensure on the part of the Six a full understanding<br />
of the safeguards required, if Britain's entry into the<br />
Common Market is not to be on such terms and conditions as to<br />
impair their vital interests. Tiey expressed their hope that<br />

the members of the European Economic Community will wish to<br />
preserve and encourage a strong and growing Commonwealth, in<br />
furtherance of their own ideals of an expanding and peaceful world<br />
order. At the same time, the representatives of various<br />
Cormmonwealth Governments expressed anxieties about the possible<br />
effects of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community.<br />
They trusted that, shculd there be closer association between<br />
Britdin and Europe, it would not be allowed, as it developed, to<br />
weaken the cohesion of the Commonwealth or its influence for<br />
peace and progress in the world. They drew attention to the<br />
difficulties to which these developments could give rise in<br />
relation to their trade both with Britain and with other countries.<br />
They explained the economic points of special concern to their<br />
respective countries and the extent to which their interests had<br />
not so far been met in the Brussels negotiations.<br />
Some independent African countries considered that<br />
association with the Community under Part IV of the Treaty of<br />
Rome would not be acceptable to them., On the other hand, the<br />
Government of Sierra Leone wished to consider further their<br />
attitude towards association, after consultation with other<br />
African territories which are not members of the Commonwealth.<br />
In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago will be willing to accept<br />
association, and Jamaica will wish to consider their attitude<br />
further. The Prime Ministers were informed that the Federation<br />
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is willing to accept association, and<br />
they were also informed that, after appropriate consultations, it<br />
seemed likely that the majority of the British dependent territories<br />
eligible for association would wish to accept it.<br />
The representative of India, Pakistan and Ceylon urged<br />
that, if Britain entered the Community, the trade agreements which<br />
the enlarged Community had offered to negotiate with their Governments<br />
should be concluded as soon as possible and that, meanwhile,<br />
no change should be made in their existing trade arrangements with<br />
Britain, They expressed their apprehension that if the treatment<br />
of their products in the United Kingdom was altered before wider<br />
trading arrangements had been worked out for the enlarged Community,<br />
their foreign exchange earnings and investment in export industries<br />
would be adversely affected at a critical stage in the implementation<br />
of their development plans.<br />
Importance was attached to the need for securing<br />
adequate safeguards to protect the essential interests of Commonwealth<br />
producers of temperate foodstuffs and other agricultural<br />
products, including tropical products, as well as certain raw<br />
materials for which zero tariffs had been requested. The<br />
importance for some Commonwealth countries of trade in a broad<br />
range of manufactured and processed goods was also emphasised.<br />
The Prime Ministers took note that the negotiations in<br />
Brussels were incomplete and that a number of important questions<br />
had still to be negotiated. Only when the full terms were known<br />
would it be possible to form a final judgment.<br />
It was agreed that, when the negotiations were resumed,<br />
British Ministers would take full account of the views, both<br />
general and particular, which had been expressed on behalf of<br />
other Commonwealth Governments at this mooting and would continue<br />
their efforts to safeguard essential Commonwealth interests,<br />
The British Government undertook to continue to arrange<br />
for the closest consultation with other Commonwroalth Governments<br />
during the remainder of their negotiations with the European<br />
Economic Community. _ UI </p>
