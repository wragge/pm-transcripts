Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the Minister for Innovation Kim Carr today welcomed the launch of the Australian-made Holden Cruze at the company's Elizabeth Plant in South Australia.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is very proud to have supported the production of this low emission car through a $149 million investment from the Government's New Car Plan for a Greener Future. </p>
<p>This investment brings real benefits for Australian consumers and the national economy, both now and into the years ahead.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Aussie model of the Holden Cruze was a very tangible sign that the automotive industry was alive and well in Australia.</p>
<p>Today's launch also makes the turbo diesel version of the Cruze Australia's most fuel efficient locally-built vehicle.</p>
<p>Clean manufacturing and innovation lie at the heart of the Government's agenda for a fairer, richer and greener Australia, built on a broad-based and sustainable national economy.</p>
<p>Innovation Minister Kim Carr said Australia is one of only 13 countries in the world capable of building a car from design to production.</p>
<p>âThe level of confidence in this industry is high,â Minister Carr said.</p>
<p>âParticipants in the Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS) such as Holden are estimating that by the end of 2015 they will have invested over $4 billion in capital and innovation.</p>
<p>âThere is a good future for the 60,000 workers directly employed in the sector.</p>
<p>âLast year Holden was able to reinstate a second shift at Elizabeth in order to produce the Cruze, along with the Series II Commodore.</p>
<p>Minister Carr said that while the Government has closed off the Green Car Innovation Fund to help pay for flood reconstruction, it is committed to all the other elements of the $5.4 billionNew Car Plan for a Greener Future.</p>
<p>âAustralia's advanced manufacturing skills and infrastructure are vital to our economy and vital to the livelihoods of thousands of workers,â Senator Carr said.</p>
