P.. Mo No U7/ 1962<br />
DEATH OF MR. R. JAMES M. P.<br />
Statement by_ the _ Prme Minister the Rt,_ H onL R. Menzies<br />
Rowley James was one of the most colourful<br />
Members of the Federal Parliament in my time.<br />
He was a great battler for coal and the<br />
coalminer. He lived among his people and spoke for<br />
them at all times with great vigour. It must have<br />
been a source of great satisfaction to him that his son<br />
now represents hi-old seat. Though he was a hard<br />
fighter, he enjoyed popularity on both sides of Parliamont,<br />
I extend warm sympathy to his family,<br />
CANBERRA,<br />
4th July, 1962. </p>
