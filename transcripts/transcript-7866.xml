PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 DECEMBER 1989<br />
Following the visit to Newcastle yesterday by the Prime<br />
Minister and the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen to<br />
assess the situation following the earthquake, the Acting<br />
Prime Minister announced today arrangements for Commonwealth<br />
assistance, including financial assistance, to Newcastle.<br />
Mr Bowen noted that the Natural Disasters Organisation ( NDO)<br />
had worked quickly and effectively with the State and local<br />
authorities in Newcastle in the immediate aftermath of the<br />
earthquake and that all requests made to the NDO had been<br />
met. He said that the Commonwealth Government Counter Disaster<br />
Task Force ( CDTF) met this afternoon to take stock of the<br />
situation in Newcastle and to consider future arrangements.<br />
The CDTF is chaired by a senior official of the Department<br />
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and brings together a wide<br />
range of Commonwealth Departments involved in responding to<br />
a natural disaster. It provides the connecting link between<br />
the NDO and the Government in the immediate emergency phase<br />
and a mechanism for co-ordination of assistance for<br />
rehabilitation. Mr Bowen said that the Commonwealth Government fully<br />
recognised the need for longer term assistance in the<br />
rehabilitation of Newcastle and pledged that the<br />
Commonwealth would play its part. Financial assistance<br />
would be provided under the terms of the Commonwealth's<br />
Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements ( NDRA) program.<br />
Details of these arrangements are set out in the attachment.<br />
These arrangements provide for Commonwealth assistance in<br />
support of State grants on eligible measures for the relief<br />
-o f-personal -hard ship -and -distress. The Commonwealth will<br />
meet at least fifty per cent of New South Wales' outlays on<br />
personal hardship and distress. Other measures eligible for<br />
assistance under the NDRA include concessional loans to<br />
small businesses, to needy persons and to voluntary<br />
non-profit bodies. In addition there is provision for<br />
assistance in the restoration of public assets. </p>
<p>Mr Bowen also announced that the Commonwealth Government is<br />
prepared to match a New South Wales State government<br />
contribution up to $ 250,000 to the Relief Fund established<br />
by the Lord Mayor of Newcastle. Moreover Mr Bowen said<br />
that donations of $ 2 or more to such a fund for the relief<br />
of persons affected by the earthquake would be tax<br />
deductible. Precise arrangements for the Fund will be the<br />
subject of further. discussion.<br />
Mr Bowen said that special arrangements would be made to<br />
ensure that social security benefits, pensions and family<br />
payments would continue to reach recipients. He also noted<br />
that there was provision for persons severely affected by a<br />
natural disaster to receive special benefits.<br />
The Prime Minister will be meeting the Premier of New South<br />
Wales, Mr Greiner, next week to discuss the situation in<br />
Newcastle. </p>
<p>DETAILS OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF<br />
ARRANGEMENTS 1. Commonwealth assistance for natural disaster relief is<br />
currently incorporated within the Natural Disaster<br />
Relief Arrangements ( NDRA) program which is<br />
administered by the Department of Finance.<br />
2. Under the NDRA, the Commonwealth financially assists<br />
the States and the Territories to meet the<br />
unpredictable, and sometimes large costs of providing<br />
natural--disaster--reiief and--restoration. The States<br />
have the primary responsibility under the Constitution<br />
for the administration, provision and financing of<br />
natural disaster relief.<br />
3. Disasters currently covered by the arrangements are<br />
bushfires, cyclones, earthquakes, floods and storms.<br />
4. The terms and conditions of assistance and the<br />
administrative arrangements under the present NDRA<br />
framework, effective from 1 July 1985, are set out in<br />
a document, signed by the Minister for Finance in July<br />
each year to apply for that financial year. The<br />
document is to be updated and revised each year.<br />
Under the arrangements, the Commonwealth reimburses at<br />
least 50% of State outlays on eligible measures for<br />
the relief of personal hardship and distress. In<br />
respect of other eligible relief and restoration<br />
measures, the Commonwealth provides financial<br />
assistance when a State's total outlays on those<br />
measures in a financial year exceeds its assessed<br />
financial capacity, as represented by an annual base<br />
amount.<br />
6. The base amounts are set at 0.225% of State annual<br />
general government revenue and grants two years<br />
earlier ( the latest available data). Commonwealth<br />
assistance is on a for basis in respect of outlays<br />
by a State above its base amount for amounts up to<br />
above the base amount and $ 3 Commonwealth to $ 1 State<br />
thereafter.<br />
7. Under the NDRA, the States have responsibility for<br />
selecting, within agreed guidelines, the specific<br />
measures to be eligible for assistance. The<br />
arrangements provide for the Commonwealth to be<br />
informed of all relief measures and for the Minister<br />
for Finance to decide, in consultation with the<br />
relevant State Minis-ter,.. on. the eligibility of a<br />
relief measure which might be considered inconsistent<br />
with the guidelines. </p>
<p>8. Under the current NDRA, it is the States which advise<br />
on the occurrence of eligible natural disasters andthe<br />
introduction and withdrawal of eligible relief<br />
measures.<br />
9. In adopting eligible relief measures, a State is<br />
required to broadly observe the following guidelines:<br />
Assistance is not to supplant,.. or . operate as a<br />
disincentive for, self-help by way of either<br />
commercial insurance or appropriate strategies<br />
of disaster mitigation.<br />
( ii) So far as practicable, assistance is to be<br />
designed to achieve an efficient allocation of<br />
resources.<br />
( iii) Other than for personal hardship relief<br />
measures, concessional-interest loans are<br />
generally to be preferred to non-repayable<br />
grants.<br />
Categories of State relief measures which are<br />
currently eligible for Commonwealth assistance under<br />
the NDRA are:<br />
grants for relief of personal hardship and<br />
distress, such as the provision of emergency<br />
food, clothing and accommodation;<br />
concessional loans to farmers or operators of<br />
small businesses, whose assets ( including fodder)<br />
have been significantly damaged and who have no<br />
reasonable access to commercial finance but who<br />
have reasonable prospects of long term viability;<br />
concessional loans to needy persons or voluntary<br />
non-profit bodies whose assets have been<br />
significantly damaged and who have no reasonable<br />
access to commercial finance;<br />
grants for the restoration of essential public<br />
assets, owned by eligible public undertakings;<br />
and<br />
S certain subsidies.<br />
