<p>AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.<br />STRATEGIC ROAD CONSTRUCTION.<br />On 1st Decemiber, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />said-" The important strategic route joining Western. Queenstnd and<br />the North-South road is rapidly nearing completion. The road will be<br />trafficable for at least nine months of the year, hut if seasons are<br />favorable, it will he traversible for the whole twelve months."<br />On 5th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />" War Cabinet to-day gave consideration to the question of the<br />construction of roads of strategic and operational impoirtance. It was<br />decided to proceed with all-weather strategic roads as follows:<br />Northern Command ( Queensland), œ 616,000; Eastern Command ( New<br />South Wales), œ 15,000; Western Goummand ( Western Australia),<br />œ 17,000. Cabinet's decision will be * referred to the Co-ordinator-<br />General of. Works ( Sir Harry Brown), who will confer with the States<br />and submit proposals for the apportionment of the financial -responsibility<br />between the Commonwealth and States, while the States'<br />construction authorities will be consulted-regarding construction<br />details." ( For earlier references, please see No. 8, page 22.)<br />GLEADALL BOMB.<br />On 6th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said -he had interested himself<br />in a number of new bombs invented by Staff-Sergeant L. R. Gleadall,<br />of Brisbane. Demonstrations had been c arried out that day. He said<br />the inventions obviously possessed great merit and would fulfil the need<br />for weapons which sections of fighting forces had been seeking. He was<br />anxious that they be tested as soon as possible with a view to putting<br />them into production. NO EXPORT OF RIFLES.<br />On 10th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />I " No rifles have been exported to other countries since I have been<br />Minister for the Army-exc-ept to the Australian Imperial Force.<br />Now, all the rifles that are beiug turned out are being used by our<br />troops."<br />MILITIA TRANSFERS TO AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE.<br />On 12th December, 1941, Mr. Forde referred to criticism of the<br />decision to. retain in the Australian Military Forces, men who were<br />desirous of enlisting for overseas service. He said that, by the calling-up<br />of all units for full-time duty, the training of men who were already<br />in Militia units would be carried on without a break and eventually<br />they would be trained as portions of formed units. Their training<br />would not be disrupted, and there would be but a deferment of the<br />processes of medical examination, enlistment, and transfer to the<br />Australian Imperial * Force recruit training depots, all of whida</p>
<p>normally occupied considerable time and expenditure. Men who had<br />notified their desire to serve overseas were being placed on special lists<br />which would be held by units, and the men would be shown as having<br />been posted to the Australian Imperial Force reserve. When the<br />occasion warranted, the men could be readily transferred to Australian<br />Imperial Force reinforcements. The action taken was based on a<br />recommnendation by the Government's military advisers in view of the<br />gravity of the international situation, and was deemed to be in the<br />best interests of the defence of the country, which overruled all personal<br />considerations. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.<br />On 13th December, 1941, the Minister for War Organization of<br />Industry ( Mr. Dedman) said that the Government's aim was to ensure<br />that universities trained students in the tasks most urgently needed.<br />Those completing courses essential to the war effort would not be subject<br />to military service, bitt those doing unessential courses would be called<br />up. ( For earlier references, please see No. 5, page 24.)<br />CHRISTMAS DINNER.<br />On 13th December, 1941, Mr. Forde announced that a special<br />Christmas dinner would be provided for Australian troops who were<br />in camps, forts or garrisons on that day. A substantial increase had<br />been approved in the messing allowance for troops on Christmas Day<br />so that arrangements could be made for the special meal. Hospital<br />cases and convalescent men in Australia, the Middle East and Malaya<br />would receive an individual Red Cross Christmas parcel.<br />SEASONAL WORKERS.<br />On 13th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said that men who had been<br />granted leave fromn military training for harvest operations and those<br />whose training ' had previously been deferred for essential work in<br />connexion with timber, flax, textile and the colliery industries, would be<br />rendering the utmost service to the war effort by remaining at their<br />civilian occupations until, and unless, called for.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 8.)<br />USE OF MILITIA OVERSEAS.<br />On 15th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />" The Government has no intention of sending members of the<br />Australian Militia Forces to any points outside Australia except to<br />Commonwealth territories or terriitories under the control of the<br />Commonwealth Government. There is no necessity to do so. Members<br />of the Militia Forces are enlisted for the'defence of Australia.<br />Australian Imperial Force men are recruited for overseas* service.<br />Members of the Militia Forces will be trained ' and used exclusively<br />for the defence of Australia and its territories. They cannot he used<br />for any other purpose except by an amendment of the Australian<br />Defence Act-which the Government does not intend to make, because<br />there is no necessity."</p>
<p>EXEMPTIONS FROM SERVICE.<br />On 16th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />A review was recently made of those exemiptions granted to Class<br />I military trainees ( single men up to 35) employed in industries not<br />directly associated with the war effort. In the past very, few men in<br />certain trades have been called up but now that it has been decided<br />to place the Militia on a war footing, it follows that m-ore skilled<br />tradesmen will be called upon. That is unavoidable if efficiency in<br />the Army is to be brought to its highest level. The review has been<br />necessary because many units requiring tradesmen have been maintained<br />previously in cadre form, but are now being brought to full strength.<br />The list of reserved occupations order is still, and will continue to be,<br />rigidly applied and instructions have been issued that not only men<br />entitled to exemptions, but those whose training had been deferred<br />by order of the Adjutant-General, to enable production of urgently<br />required materials and equipment, will not be called up unless required<br />to serve in their usual capacity in the forces. It is possible that many<br />itien who have just been called up in Class 1 have gone over to war<br />industries since they registered, and had been called up on particulars<br />p~ rev'iously furnished. If it were known that they were in war<br />industries they should not have becn called up. 1 emphasized that every<br />mnan wvhosqe age or condition, regardless of his occupation, brought hint<br />within Class 2 or Class;. 3 as defined by the proclamation of December 11,<br />1941. is required to register." SEASIDE AREAS.<br />On 15th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said that in any areas where<br />there were forts or military establishments, strict regulations, guards<br />and fences would prevent the public entering these places and he had<br />no dloubt that residents would closely observe any blackout, lighting<br />restriction or other necessary restrictions.<br />PRISONERS OF WAR.<br />RED CROSS FACILITIES.<br />On 2nd Decenmber, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />vannounced that he had authorized a contribittion of œ 750 to be.<br />dcspatehed through the Australian Red Cross to the British Red Cross<br />to provide further educational and recreational facilities for<br />A ustralian prisoners in enemy countries.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 23; No. 5, page 13.)<br />APPLES AND PEARS.<br />ACQUISITION PLAN ADOPTED.<br />On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister assisting the Minister for-<br />Commerce ( Senator Fraser) said-<br />" The Government has decided to acquire the apple and pear crop<br />af the coming season and dispose of it on behalf of the growers. At the.<br />8276-2</p>
<p>seame time, the Government has decided upon certain reforms both in<br />the scheme itself and in its administration. The Government was<br />greatly influenced by the unanimous report of the Joint Parliamentary<br />Committee which investigaited the industry, and the best means of<br />supporting it during the war. The Government has been impressed by<br />the fact that, although the committee found faults in both -the scheme<br />and its administration, nevertheless the committee recommended continuance<br />of acquisition as the best form of government intervention.<br />Therefore, in spite of all difficulties and disadvantages, the Government<br />has decided upon a scheme of acquisition. The Government expects<br />that next year's plans will operate with much more satisfaction to<br />Australia than the schemes of either of the previous years. Unless the<br />Government finds reasons of governmental importance to the contrary<br />at Lany time, it will adopt as a general guide--and will require the<br />Marketing Board to adopt as a guide-the report and recommendations<br />of the committee.<br />" The ' Government earnestly hopes that, whilst affording reasonable<br />compensation to producers for their fruit, the scheme -will also prove<br />more beneficial to consumers. Every effort will be made to see that<br />there is a wider and more efficient distribution of fruit. It is proposed<br />that acquisition will commence on 1st January, 1942. In the meantime,<br />details of the new plan will be worked out and necessary instructions<br />given to the Maeteting Board in regard to its operation."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 9, page 9.)<br />INDUSTRIAL MATTERS.<br />DILUTION OF LABOUR REGULATIONS.<br />On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Ward)<br />announced that an amendment bad been made to the National Security<br />( Engineering Trades Dilution) Regulations to provide for the payment<br />of full tradesmen's rates to all engineering trades apprentices in their<br />fifth year of service. Under an amendment to these regulations made in<br />October, 1941, it was provided that full tradesmen's rates should be<br />paid to fifth-year apprentices of employers who were employing added<br />engineering tradesmen. It was found in practice that the effect of<br />this provision was to discourage employers from employing added<br />tradesmen, as the employment of even one added tradesman would 1<br />involve them in the payment of full tradesmen's rates to all their fifthrear:.<br />apprentices. This was having an adverse effect on the placement<br />of trainees turned out under the Commonwealth Technical Training<br />Scheme. Under the regulations as now amended, all employers of<br />fifth-year engineering apprentices will be placed on the same basis,<br />and there will be no financial inducement to employeirs to refrain from<br />co-operating in the engineering trades dilution scheme.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 14; No. 3, page 11; No.<br />page 17; No. 6, page 9.)</p>
<p>COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.<br />REGULATIONS ALTERED.<br />On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Ward)<br />said-" I tender my thanks to the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) andi the<br />Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) for their valuable assistance in giving<br />effect to plans for improving the industrial arbitration system.-The<br />Government has had under consideration for some time amendments<br />to the National Security ( Coal Mining Industry Employment) Regulations<br />to provide for more expeditious handling of disputes as they<br />arise in order to ensure that production in this very important war<br />industry shall be continuous. Many stoppages have occurred and much<br />dissatisfaction has manifested itself due to delays in hearing matters<br />and arriving at decisions. Experience showed that amendments of the<br />existing regulations were necessary and as a result of conferences<br />between Mr. Curtin, Dr. Evatt and myself, amendments were to-day<br />approved to give effect to the following:-<br />Extension of the powers of Local Reference Boards to enable<br />them to settle any disputes as to local matters, that is, matters which<br />specially affect employees in the locality in which a Board is established.<br />The present power of a Local Reference Board extends only to<br />settlement lby conciliation. Thc proposed provision will enable the<br />Local Reference Board to hear and determine such matters. Matters<br />which are not local shall be dealt with by the Central Reference Board.<br />Provision is also made to provide for the appointment of a Conciliation<br />Commissioner to be Acting Chairman of the Central Reference<br />Board during the illness, or absence from any other cause, of the<br />Chairman, providing that a Judge of the Arbitration Court is not<br />available for appointment as Acting Chairman."<br />REGULATIONS AMENDED<br />On 16th December, 1941, the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) said-<br />" The Minister for Labour ( Mr. Ward) has discovered that, in a<br />niumber of cases, the proceedings of Local Reference Boards under the<br />National Security ( Coal-mining Industry Employment) Regulations<br />have been delayed. Those regulations were recently amended to prevent<br />appeals from decisions of Local Reference Boards, except where the<br />board was exceeding its jurisdiction by dealing with a matter of'<br />general import in the industry. At the same time, provision was made<br />in the regulations to compel the chairman of the Local Reference Board<br />to hold up the hearing and to refer to the Central Reference Board, at<br />the instance of any member of the board; representative of employers;<br />representative of employees, any question as to whether a matter was<br />one of local or general application.<br />" In Mr. Ward's view, this power to compel has been exercised far<br />too frequently and, in the future, it is proposed that it will he in the<br />( liscret-nn of the chairman of a Local Reference Board as to whether</p>
<p>any such question should be referred to the Central Referene Board,<br />which will then have power to determine whether it or the Local<br />Reference Board should deal with the matter. During the present<br />period of crisis, Mr. Ward will take every step necessary to prevent<br />industrial tribunals from being delayed in the hearing and determination<br />of industrial disputes. Mr. Ward considers that the amendment<br />which has been made to the regulations to make the power of chairmen<br />of Local Reference Boards discretionary only, will be a factor in<br />preventing delay.<br />A further amendment has been made to the National Security<br />( Industrial Peace) Regulations to ensure that the settlement of the<br />recent dispute in the coal-mining industry with respect to annual leave,<br />which was given by the Conciliation Commissioner ( Mr. D. B.<br />Morrison), would not be disturbed. The amending regulation will give<br />to Mr. Morrison's decision the same effect as if it had been an award of<br />the Central Reference Board and his decision will not, therefore, be<br />liable tobe upset by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court."*<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 14; No. 2, page 14; No. 7,<br />page 18; No. 8, pages 14-15.)<br />ACQUISITION OF STOCKS.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Supply ( Mr. Beasley)<br />announced regulations for the compulsory acquisition of all coal stocks<br />in New South Wales, and for the fixing of prices of coal throughout<br />Australia as from 15th December, 194-1. The Coal -Commissioner will<br />have power to-<br />Terminate all existing contracts for the supply of coal to<br />other States.<br />Acquire by compulsion all coal at New South Wales pits<br />for export to other States.<br />Fix all future prices for the purchase and resale of coal.<br />Limit rates of profit from all coal-mines or group of mines.<br />Insist that colliery waggons be made available for the<br />carriage of coal from any pit, even if it is not the pit<br />of the owner of the colliery waggons.<br />Fix prices for coal for consumption within New South<br />Wales.<br />Grade all coal into classes such as gas and tail coal, and,<br />supply interstate buyers with coal of special quality<br />instead of coal from certain mines.<br />Pay for all coal compulsorily acquired at the average<br />colliery prices ruling on 1st December, 1940, plus any<br />authorized increases granted by the Prices Commissioner.<br />Compel collieries to render accounts of interstate sales<br />each month, so that prices can be adjusted where<br />necessary.</p>
<p>COMMISSION APPOINTED.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />The Government has approved of the formation of the Coal<br />Commission to control the supply, production, distribution and all other<br />matters affecting coal. Members of the commission will be: Mr.<br />Norman Mighell ( chairman), Mr. T. Armstrong ( representing the<br />owners) and Mr. B. Cunningham ( representing the miners).<br />" Arrangements have been made for the commission to survey the<br />existing regulations with a view to recommending such alterations<br />which it considers necessary to enable it to carry out effectively in the<br />broadest sense the functions assigned to it. The matter will receive<br />of the caotmetmoIinss ion is such maass rtdob induce conl fideonccree from hatltle sptuarties. ugn<br />have received assurances of support and co-operation from the miners,<br />and I look forward to the maximum Output and best use of coal to<br />play its part in the maximum war effort."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 5, page<br />ENEMY ALIENS.<br />EDUCATION OF INTERNED -CHILDREN.<br />On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />said-The education of children of overseas internees who have been<br />permitted to accompany their parents into internment is proceeding.<br />Kindergarten and dining huts, equipped with diet kitchens for young<br />children, and a school building for elder children, are at present in<br />course of construction and will be used by children recently arrived iu<br />Australia. Adult internees are also encouraged to participate in<br />educational activities and some hundreds are studying a wide range<br />of subjects. Over 250 have prepared themselves for the University of<br />Melbourne Leaving Certificate examination. All expenses in connexion<br />with overseas internees and their children are borne by the Governments<br />originally responsible for their internament."<br />PROPERTY REGULATIONS AMENDED.<br />F On 3rd December, 1941, the Treasurer ( Mr. ' Chifley) said that a<br />new Regulation under the National Security ( Enemy Property)<br />Regulations had been gazetted to provide that no alteration to the<br />memorandum or articles of association of an Australian company, in<br />which more than 20 per cent. of the shares were held by enemy subject<br />shareholders, shall become effective until approved by the Controller<br />of Enemy Property. The Regulation was designed principally to protect<br />the interests of shareholders in Australian companies where such<br />shareholders were the subjects of a friendly or Allied power whose<br />country was in enemy hands. All occupied countries were deemed to be<br />" tenemy territory for purposes of the National Security ( Enemy<br />Property) Regulations and technically, residents therein were enemy</p>
<p>subjects It was felt, however, that the interests of these people in<br />Australian companies, where such interests were sufficient to affect a<br />company's policy, should not be prejudiced because of their inability.<br />owing to war conditions, to exercise their rights in the normal manner.<br />The new Regulation safeguarded those rights.<br />LAND TRANSFER REGULATIONS.<br />On 16th December, 1941, the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt)<br />announced that by an amendment of the National Security ( Land<br />Transfer) Regulations former subjects of Finland, Hungary, Rumania<br />and Japan, who were naturalized British subjects, were regarded as<br />naturalized persons of enemy origin. The sale of land to such persons,<br />and other land transactions with such persons, was prohibited exceptf<br />with the prior consent of the Attorney-General. Subjects of the<br />countries mentioned who were not naturalized were enemy aliens and<br />the sale of land to them,. and other land transactions with them,<br />was absolutely prohibited. TRANSPORT.<br />REGULATIONS MADE.<br />On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for Transport ( Mr. Lawson)<br />gazetted regulations providing for the control of rail transport by the<br />Commonwealth to ensure the best possible use of the facilities in<br />emergency. A committee, to be known as the War Railways Committee.<br />will be formed to advise and assist the Minister in the administration<br />of the regulations. It will consist of the chief executive officers of the<br />Commonwealth and State railways systems. The chairman will be<br />appointed by the Minister. The regulations provide the necessary<br />power to conduct the essential services for defence and civil purposes<br />without restriction.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 14; No. 5, page 12.)<br />VOLUNTEER DEFENCE CORPS.<br />EQUIPMENT ISTRIBUTION.<br />On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde) I<br />said-"' Sufficient mortars have been distributed among the various centres<br />in which the Volunteer Defence -Corps is operating to ensure a full<br />issue. The rate of rifle issue is being maintained at the highest<br />possible; level. Any increase will depend largely on the numbers<br />obtained -by impressment. A growing factory output will ensure<br />supplies of light machine guns. Sub-machine guns will also be distributed.<br />Approximately 11,000 uniforms have been distributed and<br />more are being issued as rapidly as possible; production is rising and<br />a full issue is not far distant."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 6, page 23.)</p>
<p>FULL-TIME DUTY PERSONNEL.<br />On 5th December, 1941, the Prime Minister. ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />Approval was given by War Cabinet to-day to the employment of<br />full-time duty personnel with the Volunteer Defence Corps. It was<br />decided that, for the proper administration of the corps, full-time duty<br />personnel should be employed, totalling 29 captains, 73 lieutenants and<br />175 warrant and non-commissioned officers. The work of organization<br />and administration has been carried out voluntarily, and in their spare<br />time, * by members but, with the increased volume of work now to be<br />handled and the vital part the corps may be called upon to play in<br />Autralia's defence, it is no longer possible to depend on purely<br />vla ry services. The appointment of full-time duty personnel will<br />permit of the proper issue of, and accounting for, uniforms, equipment<br />and training stores and will assist commanding officers in the training<br />of units and the keeping of records and compilation of data required in<br />connexion with the employment of the corps on mobilization."<br />CALL-UP FOR SERVICE.<br />On 13th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-<br />" Portions of the Volunteer Defence Corps will be called up for<br />coast-watching and for defence of aerodromes. They will receive the<br />same rates of pay as the Militia Forces. Arrangements are in progress<br />for the calling-tip of these men. They will be drawn as far as possible<br />from the areas in which their services will be used."<br />FAR EASTERN POSITION.<br />WAR CABINET MEETING.<br />On 4th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />" War Cabinet, in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff, reviewed<br />the preparedness of the Navy, Army and Air Force for any emergency.<br />The precautionary steps that have been taken to meet any contingency<br />that may arise were examined and . authority given for further<br />essential measures, if and when, they should become necessary."<br />AUSTRALIAN WAR EFFORT AND CAPACITY.<br />APPOINTM1ENTS MADE.<br />On 15th Decembet, 1941, the Minister for War Organization of<br />Industry ( Mr. Dedman) announced further appointments of his<br />department, Professor Ronald Walker of the University; of Hobart to be<br />Chief Economic Adviser to the Department, the Chief Inspector, Personnel,<br />Postmaster-General's Department ( Mr. G. T. Chippindall) to<br />be Deputy-Director, Department of War Organization of -Industry.</p>
<p>APPOINTMENT OF SCIENTISTS.<br />On 11th December, 1941, Mr. Dedman said that two scientists were<br />to be selected, having regard to their knowledge of industry and science,<br />to spend about three months studying the position relative to the<br />utilization of the scientific resources of the country in the war effort,<br />by consultation with a few leaders in charge of war activities. These<br />men would then submit to the Prime Minister proposals for making<br />fuller use of such scientific help as was available in the country, and<br />was unused. AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS.<br />RESPIRATORS FOR CIVIL POPULATION.<br />On 5th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />War Cabinet to-day discussed the matter of provision of respirators<br />for use by the civil population of Australia in the event of gas<br />attacks. It was decided to place an order in the United Kingdom for<br />the supply of 1,000,000 respirator containers and that the Australian<br />Department of Munitions commence, at the earliest possible date, the<br />manufacture of the face-pieces for these containers at the rate of<br />40,000 a week. Arrangements will be mnade by the Department of Home<br />Security for the storage of containers and face-pieces and their assembly<br />snd issue when required. The Department of Munitions will collsborate<br />on the technical side of these matters and War Cabinet will later<br />deal with the question of local production of the complete units. It<br />is estimated that the provision of 1,000,000 units will cost œ 300,000."'<br />COMPENSATION FOR VOLUNTEERS.<br />On 16th December, 1941, the Minister for Home Security ( Mr.<br />Lazzarini) announced National Security ( Civil Defence Volunteers'<br />Compensation) Regulations providing a scheme of compensation and/ or<br />pension for Civil Defence Volunteers who were members of civil<br />defence organizations approved by the Minister, who would administer<br />the regulations. Members who sustained personal injuries in the course<br />of training would beneifit under the scheme and allowances for<br />dependants were provided. All claims would be handled by the<br />Repatriation Commission.

The machine<br />will be requisitioned, if required in an emergency, during the two<br />months of the period of return that has been approved."<br />WOMEN DOCTORS APPROVED.<br />On 5th December, 1941, Mr. Curtin said-<br />" War Cabinet to-day gave approval to the employment in the<br />Royal Australian Air Force medical service of women doctors, not<br />exceeding a total of eight. They will be paid the rates of pay and<br />allowances applicable to male doctors holding the corresponding rank.<br />The duties of the new appointees will include clinical pathology at<br />hospitals and general work at stations where members of the Women's<br />Auxiliary Australian Air Force are accommodated. Cabinet's decision<br />was prompted by the difficulty being experienced in meeting the medical<br />officer requirements of the services."<br />LEAVE CANCELLED.<br />OA 5th December, 1941, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford) said<br />that leave for Royal Australian Air Force personnel at Darwin had<br />been cancelled for the present. This action had been taken some time<br />ago when the Far Eastern position began to deteriorate.<br />AIR-ARMY GO-OPERATION.<br />On 10th December, 1941, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)<br />I said that the school of army co-operation, providing a basis for closer<br />collaboration between the Air Force and the Army, to be established in<br />Canberra early in the new year, would be under the control of Wing-<br />Commander S. de B. Griffiths, Commanding Officer, Royal Australian<br />Air Force Station, Canberra, pending the arrival in Australia of a<br />Royal Air Force air-army co-operation expert. Squad ron-Leader G.

<p>AWARDS FOR GALLANTRY.<br />On l3th December, 1941, Mr. Drakeford received advice that<br />Squadron-Leader C. Rawlinson had been awarded a bar to his Distinguished<br />Flying Gross, and Flight-Lieutenant D. A. Coke and Flying-<br />Officer F. Fischer had won the Distinguished Flying Cross for outstanding<br />bravery in the Libyan campaign.<br />On 17th December, 1941, Mr. Drakeford said-<br />" Flight-Lieutenant C. R. Caldwel], who is serving in a Royal<br />Australian Air Force squadron operating in Libya, has been simultaneously<br />awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and bar for outstanding<br />bravery. MOVEMENTS OF PERSONNEL.<br />On 15th December, 1941, Mr. Drakeford said the Government did<br />not intend to disclose, at this stage, its intentions regarding the future<br />of the Royal Australian Air Force personnel serving outside the<br />Pacific as to do* so would be gratuitously to supply the enemy with<br />valuable operational information.<br />REINFORCEMENTS IN MALAYA.<br />On 15th December, 1941, Mr. Drakeford said-<br />Everything possible is being done-to maintain and, if necessary,<br />reinforce our air strength in the Malayan battle zone. Any action<br />taken by the Government to supply reinforcements for sectors outside<br />the sphere of Australian operations is, and will continue to be, consistent<br />with the protection of vital homie points from which our fighting forces<br />receive their supplies of war materials and from which flow the commodities<br />essential to the life of the community."<br />IMPORTS.<br />RESTRICTIONS ON STERLING GOODS.<br />On 6th Decemb * er, 1941, the Minister for Trade and Customs<br />( Senator Keane) announced the introduction, as from 8th December,<br />1941, of restrictions on the importation of a wide range of goods from<br />the United Kingdom and all other countries of the sterling area except<br />New Zealand and British and French Pacific Islands. Mainly the<br />goods are regarded as being unnece . ssary during wartime. In the case<br />of raw cotton and. tobacco leaf it has been found necessary to apply<br />the import licensing principles to all sterling areas.<br />HIS HIGHNESS THE RAJAH OF SARAWAK.<br />Ohi 10th December, 1941, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />Evatt) announced that His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak ( Sir<br />Charles Vyner Brooke,, had arrived at Brisbane that day.<br />He had been requested by His Highness that the visit should be<br />regarded entirely as a private one. In that circumstance, no undue<br />publicity should be given to the visit.</p>
<p>AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.<br />AUSTRALIAN DESIGNED RIVETING GUN.<br />On 10th December, 1941, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)<br />said that Flight-Sergeant E. A. Lee, of Royal Australian Air Force<br />Head-quarters, had designed a new and improved type of automatic<br />riveting gun used in the construction of metal aeroplanes and _ parts<br />which was being produced by Royal Australian Air Force trainees at<br />No. 1 Engineering School, Ascot Vale ( Victoria). The Lee riveting<br />gun was more efficient, easier to handle and much faster in operation<br />than the imported Chobert gun, and could be made at a fraction of the<br />cost. It was estimated that the Australian gun could be manufactured<br />by the Royal Australian Air Force for a few shillings, compared with<br />approximately œ 4 if produced privately, and œ 50 if imported.<br />AUSTRALIAN-MADE BOMB RACKS.<br />On 13th December, 1941, Mr. Drakeford announced that universal<br />bomb racks, capable of holding all types of bombs used by Royal<br />Australian Air Force machines, were now being manufactured in<br />Australia. The Pacific conflict would make it increasingly difficult to<br />import bomb racks from Britain.<br />MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.<br />CHECK ON ENLISTMENTS.<br />On 11th December, 1941, the Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin)<br />said that conferences -had recently been held between the Prime Minister<br />( Mr. Curtin), the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde) and representatives<br />of the Amalgamated Engineering Union to establish a more<br />satisfactory basis for the employment of technicians in munitions<br />factories, having regard to the essential requirements of the Army. A<br />review of this question, which was at present proceeding, would check<br />any wastage or inefficiency in the allotment of skilled workers to the<br />services. WAR CABINET.<br />On 11th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />I have to-day appointed the Minister for War Organization of<br />Industry ( Mr. Dedman) to be a member of the War Cabinet."<br />TEXTILE TRADE.<br />COTTON GOODS " FROZEN<br />On 11th December, 1941, the Minister for Supply ( Mr. Beasley)<br />said that because of excessive buying recently, existing stocks of engine<br />cotton cleaning waste, cotton cloths, stockinette and sundry cleaning<br />cloths had been frozen from that day. Future sales would be<br />prohibited to people holding more than one month's supply based on<br />1940 usage. People with less may buy up to 1 ton or 14 days 1940<br />usage, whichever was the lesser.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 9.)</p>
<p>VOCATIONAL TRAI NI NG.<br />REPORT TO CABINET.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr. Frost)<br />said that the Cabinet sub-committee, comprising the Minister for<br />Health and Social Services ( Mr. Holloway), the Minister for Labour<br />( Mr. Ward) and the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr. Frost), recently<br />appointed to consider proposals regarding general repatriation benefits<br />for members of the forces would report to Cabinet shortly. Questions<br />referred for consideration were preference for returned soldiers and<br />vocational training for those members eligible under the present<br />Repatriation Act. In view of the changed Pacific situation, the further<br />question arose as to the scope of the act. At present it provided,<br />so far as general benefits were concerned, for those ' who enlisted for<br />service abroad, but events might lead to an amendment of the act to<br />cover members of the Australian Military Forces enlisted, or called up,<br />for home defence only.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 10; No. 6, page 6.)<br />DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION.<br />RUMORS DISCOUNTED.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Information ( Senator<br />Ashley) appealed to the public to take no notice of rumors and to regard<br />only official statements as authoritative. These would be issued as early<br />as possible, and as frequently as was thought necessary. The Government's<br />considered policy was promptly to release news which affected<br />the operations of the forces whether it was good or bad.<br />RELATIONS WITH AMERICA.<br />DEMAND FOR AUSTRALIAN NEWS.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Information ( Senator<br />Ashley) said that one of the results of the new Pacific situation was the<br />tremendous increase of American interest in Australia. The Department<br />of Information was doing everything possible to meet this new<br />demand for news and information from Australia. In particular, the<br />broadcasting division was transmitting on short-wave each evening to<br />America a ten-minute news bulletin.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 13.)<br />PRICES.<br />FIRM DECLARED<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Keane)<br />said that all services performed by the Parisian Laundry Proprietary<br />Limited, 118-120 Oxford-street, Woollahra ( New South Wales), had<br />been brought under strict price control by a declaration. Action had<br />been taken because the firm increased the prices charged on a large</p>
<p>section of its business after it had been advised by the New South<br />Wales Deputy Prices Commissioner that it would be necessary to make<br />application and justify any increases before putting them into effect.<br />All firms should realize that instructions from Deputy Prices Commissioners<br />should be strictly followed or immediate steps be taken by<br />the trader concerned to discuss any difficulties with the Deputy Prices<br />Commissioner. ( For earlier references, please see No. 6, page 14; No. 7, pages 21-22; No. 9,<br />page 3.)<br />SOCIAL SECURITY.<br />PENSIONERS IN EMPLOYMENT.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Social Services ( Mr.<br />Holloway) said-<br />Any old-age penlsioner who enters employment should immediately<br />inform the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions at the capital city in<br />which he resides. By so doing, overpayments of pensions may be prevented<br />and the difficulties invariably attendant upon refunds will be<br />obviated. If the work proved beyond the pensioner's capacity or ceases<br />for any other reason, no difficulties will be raised in restoring pension<br />payments from an appropriate date."<br />BARLEY POOL.<br />1941-42 CROP FIRST ADVANCE.<br />On 15th December, 1941, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Scully)<br />said that the Government ' had approved of advances totalling about<br />œ 1,000,000 to barley-growers as the first advance to be made on barley<br />of the 1941-42 crop. The money would be made available by the<br />Commonwealth Bank, which would also provide œ. 700,000 for expenses<br />incurred iii the administration of the pool. All advances were less<br />an average freight of 34d. a bushel. The Australian Barley Fool Board<br />was conferring with the Commronwealth Bank regarding machinery<br />measures necessary for payment. It was anticipated that these<br />arrangements would be completed to enable payment to be made<br />towards the end of this month. Production this year had been a record<br />and, in view of the serious limitation of export, it was estimated that a<br />substantial loss would result from this year's pool.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 13.)<br />OWEN SUB-MACHINE GUN.<br />NUMBER MANUFACTURED.<br />On 16th December, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)<br />said-A substantial number of Owen guns have already been manufactured.<br />I have received a photograph showing a long line of these<br />new sub-machine guns."<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 8, page 13.)</p>

RKWRIGILT, BA-RON G-OWRIE, the<br />Governor-General aforesaid, acting with the advice of the Federal<br />Executive Council and in the exercise of all powers me thereunto<br />enabling, do hereby declare and proclaim that a state of war with the<br />Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of<br />Rumania exists and-has existed in the Commonwealth of Australia and<br />its Territories as from the eighth day of December, One thousand nine<br />hundred and forty-one at five o'clock in the a-fternoon reckoned<br />according to the standard time in the Australian -Capital Territory:<br />OF ALL WHICH His Majesty's loving subjects and all others<br />whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice<br />and to govern themselves accordingly.<br />Given under my Hand and the Seal of the Commonwealth of<br />Australia this eighth day of December in the year of our<br />Lord One thousand nine hundred and forty-one and in the<br />fifth year of His Majesty's reign.<br />By His Excellency's Command, JOEHN OURTIN Prime Minister.<br />GOD SAVE THlE KING!<br />WAR WITH JAPAN.<br />PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br />( On 7th December, 1941, Japan attacked United States territory.)<br />On 8th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-<br />" The thread by which peace was hanging has -been snapped,<br />notwithstanding all the discussions and negotiations which the~<br />democracies persisted with in the hope that peace would be maintained.<br />Japan has gonc -to war and it is necessary to point out that, prior tc<br />formal declaration of war, Japan wantonly assailed British and United<br />States interests and places.<br />For weeks past, peace in the Pacific has been hanging by a thread.<br />The question was: Would Japan snap the thread? For no other<br />country which could have made war in the Pacific desired war. Since<br />February of. this year the problem of the Pacific has been one of<br />constant anxiety to the Government of Australia and to the governments<br />of the democracies.<br />Hit without warning brings its own retaliation. Men and women<br />of Australia: The stern truth is that Japan commenced. a war in the<br />Pacific in which our security and our vital int-. ests are at stake. I ask</p>
<p>the people of Australia to give the best that they can in the service of<br />this country. The fighting forces are a t battle stations. Every otheir<br />man and woman should be at some place of usefulness.<br />" The Australian Government has taken immediate steps this<br />morning, according to plan, to do everything necessary. for the defence<br />of Australian, British and United States interests. Thb Service<br />Ministers and the Service Chiefs have acted promptly, as have other<br />departments connected with internal Security. No time was lost<br />from the moment, early this morning when the news was received, in<br />taking all necessary measures.<br />This is the gravest hour of our history. We have a heavy<br />responsibility. I ask every Australian, man -and woman, to go about<br />their allotted task with full vigor and courage."~<br />PROCLAMATION.<br />Commonwealth of By This Excellency the Governor-General<br />Australia to wit. in and-over the Commonwealth of<br />Gowuni Australia.<br />Governor-General.<br />IALEXANDER GORE ARKWRIGHT, BARON GOWRIE, the<br />SGovernor-General aforesaid, acting with the advice of the Federal<br />Executive Council and in the exercise of all poweirs me thereunto<br />enabling, do hereby decla-re and proclaim that a state of war with the<br />Japanese Empire exists and has existed in the -Commonwealth of<br />Australia . and its Territories as from the eighth day of December, One<br />thousand nine hundred and forty-one at five o'clock in the afternoon<br />reckoned -according to the standard time in the Australian Capital<br />Territory: OF ALL WHICH His Majesty's loving subjects and all others<br />whom these P-resents may concern are hereby required to take notice<br />and to govern themselves accordingly.<br />Given under my Hand and the Seal -of the Commonwealth of<br />Australia this ninth day of December in the year of Our<br />Lord One thousand nine hundred -and forty-one and in the<br />-fifth year of His Majesty's reign.<br />By His Excellency's Command, JOHN OCURTIN Prime Minister.<br />GOD SAVE THE KNI<br />NATIONAL BROADCAST BY PRIME MINISTER.<br />On 8th December, 1941, in a national broadcast, Mr. Curtin said:<br />Men and women of Australia,,<br />We are at war with Japan. That has happened because, in the<br />first instance, Japanese naval and air forces launched an unprovoked<br />attack on British and United States territory; because our vital<br />interests are imperilled and because the rights of free people in the<br />whole Pacific are assailed. As a result, the Australian Government</p>
<p>this afternoon took the necessary steps which will mean that a<br />state of war exists between Australia and Japan. To-morrow, in<br />common with the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands<br />East Indies Governments, the Australian Government will<br />formally and solemnly declare the state of war it has striven so sincerely<br />and strenuously to avoid.<br />Throughout the whole affair, and despite discouragement, the<br />Australian Government and its representatives abroad struggled hard<br />to prevent a breakdown of discussions. Australia encouraged the<br />United States to retain the diplomatic initiative on behalf of the<br />democratic Powers. We did not want war in the Pacific. The<br />Australian Government has repeatedly made it clear-as have the<br />Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and the<br />Netherlands East Indies-that if war came to the Pacific it. would be<br />of Japan's making. Japan has now made war.<br />" I point out that the hands of the democracies are clean. The<br />discussions and negotiations which have taken place between Japan<br />and the democracies were not merely empty bandying of words on<br />the democracies' part. Since last February it has been the constant<br />aim and endeavour of the democracies to keep peace in the Pacific.<br />It has been a problem fraught with grave difficulties but, in the<br />view of the democracies, it was a problem that was capable of being<br />overcome. Accordingly, the best brains of the democracies were<br />brought to bear on the problem. It will stand on record that the<br />President of the United States himself, the American Secretary of<br />State ( Mr. Cordell Hull), the British and the Dominion Governments<br />worked untiringly and unceasingly. Yet, when the President of the<br />United States had decided to communicate direct to the Japanese<br />Emperor a personal appeal for Imperial intervention on the side<br />of peace, the war Government of Japan struck. That war Government,<br />set on aggression and lusting for power in the . same fashion<br />as its Axis partners, anticipated thie undoubted weight of the<br />President's plea and shattered the century-old friendship between<br />the two countries.<br />For the first time in the history of the Pacific, armed conflict<br />stalks abroad. No other country but Japan desired war in the<br />Pacific. The guilt for plunging this hemisphere into actual warfare is,<br />therefore, upon Japan. The recapitulation of events I have given you<br />is necessary so that we in Australia may correctly assess the issues<br />involved. The stern truth is that war has been forced upon us, not<br />because of stubborn resistance on the part of the democracies to every<br />demand that Japan made, but because Japan chose the method of<br />armed might to settle differences which every other country involved<br />was ready and willing to settle by negotiation and arbitration. Japan,<br />by so doing, chose the Hitler method. While its diplomatic representatives<br />were actually at the White House; while all the democratic<br />Powers regarded the conversations as continuing; Japan ignored the<br />convention of a formal declaration of war and struck like an assassasin<br />in the night.</p>
<p>For, as the dawn broke this morning, at places as far apart as<br />Honolulu, Nauru, Ocean Island, Guam, Singapore' and British Malaya,<br />guns from Japanese warships; bombs from Japanese aircraft; shots<br />from Japanese military forces struck death to United States citizens<br />and members of its defence forces; to the peaceful subjects of Great<br />Britain and to her men on ships and on the land. The Pacific Ocean<br />was reddened with the blood of Japanese victims. These wanton<br />killings will be followed by attacks on the Netherlands East Indies;<br />on the Commonwealth of Australia; on the Dominion of New Zealand;<br />if Japan can get its brutal way.<br />Australia, therefore, being a nation that believes in a way of<br />life whichb has freedom and liberty as its corner stones goes to the<br />battle stations in defence of the free way of living. Our course is<br />clear, our cause is just-as has been the case ever since September,<br />1939, when we stood in the path of IHitlerism and declared that we<br />would stand out to the end against ruthless an ' d wanton aggression.<br />I say, then, to the people of Australia: Give of your best in the<br />service of the nation. There is a place and part for all of us. Each<br />must take his or her place in the service of the nation, for the nation<br />itself is in peril. This is our darkest hour. Let that be fully realized.<br />Our efforts in the -past two years must be as nothing compared with<br />the efforts we must now put forward.<br />" I can give you the assurance that the Australian Government is<br />fully prepared. It has ' been in readiness for whatever eventuality, and<br />last Friday the initial steps were taken and fully car. ried out. From<br />early this morning the Service Ministers of the Cabinet and the Chiefs<br />of the fighting Services have done everything that has to -be done by<br />them. The War Cabinet met and put into effect the plan devised for<br />our protection. This afternoon, the full Cabinet met and I am able<br />to announce to you prompt decisions on a : wide variety of mattersall<br />of them vital to the new war organization that confronts us.<br />All leave for members of the fighting Forces has been cancelled.<br />An extension of the present partial mobilization of Navy, Army and<br />Air Forces is being prepared. The Minister for Home Security will,<br />to-morrow, confer with Army authorities on air' raid precautions.<br />Regulations will be issued to prohibit the consumption of petrol for<br />purposes of pleasure. A conference will. be held ' by the Minister for<br />Supply, with oil companies on ' the storage of fuel and the security of<br />that storage. Arrangements will be made for all work on services that<br />are essential nationally to be continued on public holidays in future,<br />while, in this connexion, all transport services will be concentrated<br />upon necessary purposes. The Minister for Labour will leave for<br />Darwin immediately to organize the labour supply there. An<br />examination will . be made to ascertain what retail establishments<br />should continue to trade after 6 p. m.-so, as to conserve light, coal,<br />transport services.</p>
<p>" These are some of the things decided upon quickly, but in no<br />atmosphere of panic. There are other things that the Government<br />has done. These, by their nature, are secret. But, in total, what has<br />been done to-day adds up to complete provision for the safety of the<br />nation. " Tb-morrow, the War Cabinet will meet again, as will the Australian<br />War -Council, when the Leader of the Opposition and his<br />colleagues will -be fully appraised of every phase of the position. The<br />Parliament of the -Commonwealth will assemble on Tuesday of next<br />week. " One thing remains, and on it depends our very lives. That thing<br />is the co-operation, the strength, and the will-power of you, the people.<br />Without it we are, indeed, lost. Men and women of Australia: The<br />call is to you, for your courage; your physical and mental ability; your<br />inflexible determination that we, as a nation of free people, shall<br />survive. My appeal to you is in the name of Australia, for Australia<br />is the stake in this conflict. The thread of peace has snapped-only<br />the valour of our fighting Forces, hacked by the very uttermost of<br />which we are capable in factory and workshop, can knit that thread<br />again into security'. -Let there be no idle hand. The road of service<br />is ahead. Let us all tread it firmly, victoriously.<br />We here, in this spacious land where, for more than 150 years,<br />peace and security have prevailed, are now called upon to meet the<br />external aggressor. -The enemy presses from without. I have said<br />that our forces! are at their battle stations. They are not alone. lIt<br />is true that Japan is not alone. But, as I speak to you to-night, the<br />United States; Great Britain and her colonies and dominions, which<br />include the Commonwealth of Australia -and the Dominion of New<br />Zealand; the great federation of Russian republics; the Netherlands<br />East Indies and. China, are associated in the common cause of prcserving<br />for free men and free women not only their inheritance, but<br />every hope they have of decency and dignity and liberty.<br />We Australians have imperishable traditions. We shall maintain<br />them. We shall vindicate them. We shall hold this country and<br />keep it as a citadel for the British-speaking race and as a place where<br />civilization will-persist.<br />" Men and women of Australia: It is my duty to sound a toosin t<br />I proclaim a call unto you. I do it in the words of Swinhurne--<br />"' Come -forth, be born and live,.<br />Thou that hast help to give,<br />And light to mnake man's day of manhood fair,<br />With flight outfiying the sphered sun,<br />Hasten thine hour<br />And halt not till thy work ' be done.'"</p>
<p>STATE OF WAR.<br />On 9th December, 1941, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />Evatt) said-<br />" Instructions have been sent to the Charge d'Affaires ( Mr. Officer),<br />Australian Legation, Tokio, to inform the Imperial Japanese Government<br />that a state of war exists and has existed between His Majesty's<br />Government in the Commonwealth of Australia and the Imperial<br />Japanese Government, as from 5 o'clock in the afternoon, 8th December,<br />1941. I have also received a formal call this afternoon from the<br />Japanese Minister to Australia ( Mr. Kawal) and have submitted to<br />him a communication which related the notification which has been<br />sent to the Imperial Japanese Government."<br />MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.<br />On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />Evatt), in communicating formally to the United States Government<br />the declaration of war by the Commonwealth of Australia against<br />Japan, conveyed the following message to President Roosevelt on<br />behalf of the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) and the Commonwealth<br />Government. I desire to express our profound appreciation of the initiative,<br />courage and patience displayed by the President and Secretary of State<br />in their endeavours to prevent war in the Pacific and in their objective<br />of outlawing force as on instrument of national policy.<br />" For the time being the attempt to maintain Pacific peace oii a<br />basis of law and justice has been checked by the sudden and treacherous<br />attack of the Japanese forces while diplomiatic negotiations were<br />actually proceeding. The Commonwealth is hionoured to be associated<br />with the United States in resisting the aggressors until they are finally<br />overthrown and until the principles for which the President has so<br />frequently declared are established, not only in the Pacific, but everywhere<br />in the world."<br />In reply, President Roosevelt sent the following message to Dr.<br />Evstt, to be conveyed to Mr. Cumtin:<br />" Please send my best wishes to the Government and the people of<br />Australia. We did our utmost to keep the peace in the Pacific but<br />our enemies had decided on aggression beforehand. This is now a<br />world war in the true secse. We are in it wvith you and you will not<br />find uts wanting. I need not tell the Australians to keep a stout heart.<br />I know that you will. We will win."</p>
<p>PARLIAMENT APPROVES.<br />On 16th December, 1941, the House of Representatives, on the<br />motion of Mr. Curtin, and the Senate, on the motion of the Minister<br />for the Interior ( Senator Collings), approved the following resolution<br />unanimously. " That this House approves of the action of His Majesty's Government<br />in the Commonwealth in ha * g advised the issue of proclamations<br />declaring the existence of a state f~ war with Japan, Finland, Hungary<br />and Rumania. Further, this Ho se hereby pledges itself to take every<br />step deemed necessary to defend this Commonwealth and its territories,<br />to carry on hostilities in association -with our allies, and to achieve<br />final victory over our enemies."~<br />WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.<br />1941-42 CROP FIRST ADVANCE.<br />On 15th December, 1941, the Minister for Commerce Scully)<br />said that the Government had approved of the first advance on wheat<br />of the 1941-42 crop at the rate of 3s. a bushel, less freight, for bagged<br />wheat, and 2s. 10d. a bushel, less freight, for bulk wheat. This would<br />involve œ 21,000,000. The Government had arranged with the Commonwealth<br />Bank for the provision of the necessary funds. The Australian<br />Wheat Board was conferring with the Commonwealth Bank regarding<br />the machinery measures necessary for payment and it was anticipated<br />that these arrangements would he completed to enable payment to be<br />made towards the end of this month. About 142,000,000 bushels would<br />be acquired this season, of which 80,000,000 bushels would be bulk<br />and 62,000,000 bushels bagged. The crop was the first to feel the<br />real impact of war. Market prospects were not good, the only certain<br />outlet during the next twelve months being that for 32,000,000 bushels<br />which would be required in Australia. Because it appeared that a<br />second advance from sales would not be justified for a considerable<br />period the Government had fixed the initial advance at the utmost that<br />could be paid.<br />( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 11; No. 4, page 13, No. 6, page<br />By Author~ ty L F.
