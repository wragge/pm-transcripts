TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE CARLTON, RADIO 2GB, 23<br />
MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
CARLTON: Prime minister, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning Mike.<br />
CARLTON: Are you surprised at the passion that this is<br />
gene rating?<br />
PM: No, not particularly. That's something that in a sense<br />
had to be expected and had to be dealt with. I mean you<br />
don't make decisions on the basis of passionate feelings<br />
because if you did that you'd never make any decisions<br />
because just about any area of politics these days where<br />
important decisions are involved, there will be some group<br />
who have got passionate feelings the other way. You'd never<br />
make any decisions if you go at them that way.<br />
CARLTON: It does have the potential though for quite a<br />
serious split in the Party doesn't it? A lot of the Right<br />
here in New South Wales think they've been sold out.<br />
PM: Well of course it's causing problems in the Patty. I<br />
was not unaware of that and I guess in the six years that<br />
I've been Prime Minister I've tried to keep my ears and<br />
antenna finely tuned to political reactions. You're damned<br />
stupid if you dont. But in the end you've got to make the<br />
decisions which you think are correct and that's what I've<br />
done. In my case for instance, I started off with a<br />
presumption, Mike, on economic grounds and aviation<br />
principals that the Badgery's Creek was the right<br />
decision. I went through this process starting from that<br />
presumption and fairly strongly from that, but the more that<br />
I probed, the more information I asked for, the more<br />
statistics that were gathered in relation to the various<br />
assumptions that one has to make as to what's the right<br />
decision, the more I and my advisers I might say were<br />
moved inexorably from a Badgery Creek fast tracking approach<br />
to this combined approach of the third runway and starting<br />
to prepare Badgery's.<br />
CARLTON: Is that partly because Badgery's Creek would have<br />
just been hugely expensive, billions of dollars? </p>
<p>PM: Well, that's one of the elements and some the expense<br />
of that by some may have been overstated, but it is the fact<br />
that if you were to pursue the Badgery's Creek option as the<br />
immediate fast track option, then there is no doubt that<br />
that would have been considerably more expensive. The<br />
question really turned upon the series of assumptions you<br />
had to make as to when an upgraded Mascot, that is a Mascot<br />
with a third runway, what series of assumptions you made as<br />
when that upgraded facility would itself reach saturation<br />
point. Now the presumption that I tended to make early in<br />
my consideration of it was that point would be reached<br />
sometime perhaps near the mid 1990s. In other words you<br />
could be faced with a situation I thought where you could<br />
build the third runway and by the time it was actually<br />
built, you would be nudging up against the capacity<br />
constraints. So the essence of the decision you had to make<br />
was to look at the series of assumptions that are involved<br />
in when an upgraded Mascot reached saturation point, the<br />
further that point was out, the more economic sense<br />
overwhelmingly it made to go ahead with the third runway.<br />
CARLTON: So you're simply saying there's a lot of life in<br />
Mascot left with a third runway?<br />
PM: Yes, and if in fact there hadn't been, there would have<br />
been absolutely no point in proceeding with it. You just<br />
don't go and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build<br />
a third runway on the basis that when, in a matter of just a<br />
very short period of time it's up against saturation. But<br />
all the evidence that came together and which persuaded me<br />
and those advising me and other Ministers, including Paul,<br />
it was clear that that point was much further out.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. Is there a chance of the decision being<br />
overturned by the full Caucus?<br />
PM: I don't believe so. I mean, obviously some of my<br />
colleagues have very strong feelings about this and may I<br />
say, in respect to them, that it's not just a matter, the<br />
understandable concern about their seats that some of them<br />
have, but I say with respect to them that on the information<br />
that they've had they probably feel as well that on economic<br />
grounds it's not the right decision. It's not just that<br />
Peter Baldwin and these people had an emotional personal<br />
interest, and the interests of their constituents, I mean I<br />
think they probably believe that the sort of considerations<br />
I've put to them they are not aware of all the<br />
statistics probably.<br />
CARLTON: Do you expect a move to have it overturned in the<br />
Caucus? </p>
<p>PM: Whether it there'd be an actual move to have it<br />
overturned, I think obviously when we go to Caucus and<br />
report on the'matter there will be an opposing view put. I.<br />
guess if they thought they had the numbers to overturn it<br />
they might try and that, but I would be confident that<br />
in this matter rationality would prevail. Let me say this<br />
Mike by the way too, that the considerations that are<br />
involved are not all bad for the people around the area. I<br />
mean the fact is, let me say, that for those affected by the<br />
east-west runway, and that's the majority of the seats<br />
concerned, there will in fact be an overwhelming reduction<br />
in aircraft movements because with the opening up of the<br />
third runway, which will give you two parallel north-south<br />
operations, by definition the possible use of the east-west<br />
runway is<br />
CARLTON: Yes.<br />
PM: We will in fact make a decision that the only<br />
circumstances in which that east-west runway will be used in<br />
the very limited number of adverse weather conditions. In<br />
fact, given the statistics, that means that when it's<br />
operational you will have a reduction from some 72,000<br />
movements on the east-west runway down to just over 2,000.<br />
An absolutely massive reduction, so that the majority in<br />
fact of the people in the electorates around there will have<br />
just a massive reduction in noise. It is true, let me say,<br />
it is true that for a couple of the electorates, that's<br />
Sydney and Grayndler, there will be some increase. I don't<br />
avoid that.<br />
CARLTON: They're safe seats so it doesn't really affect you<br />
does it?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon?<br />
CARLTON: They're safe seats though aren't they?<br />
PM: They're not regarded as safe seats in these<br />
circumstances and that's part of the concern.<br />
CARLTON: Alright<br />
PM: And more in regard to these east-west runs is regarded<br />
as one where these rational facts will prevail. People have<br />
a concern that there's so much emotion invested in the<br />
argument, that people won't respond to facts. Well, we'll<br />
see about that.<br />
CARLTON: Are you planning a Cabinet reshuffle at all? It<br />
looks like Mr Punch will be moved I suppose, does it?<br />
PM: No, I've been very straight forward about this, there's<br />
no reason to be otherwise. I just asked as you read </p>
<p>-4-<br />
( PM cont): about, you know, something like a quarter to two<br />
in the morning yesterday after we'd finished the<br />
consideration of Cabinet I asked Gary to come in and we<br />
had a very amicable discussion. It was agreed that he<br />
should consider his position, I mean not that I would<br />
be determined in my decision by his feeling, but the<br />
sensible, decent thing to do was to say to him ' well look,<br />
do you want to think about your position in this portfolio'<br />
and he appreciated the way in which I raised it. He said<br />
he'd like to think about it, he'll come back to me and tell<br />
me what he thinks and I will make a decision, not only just<br />
in terms of what his thinking is but mine. So there's<br />
nothing ( interrupted) about that.<br />
CARLTON: I was just thinking of a couple of other elements<br />
as well. I mean Senator Walsh the other day indicated he'd<br />
like another job perhaps, that he's tired. You're going to<br />
have to move Mr Punch probably. Have you considered a wider<br />
Cabinet reshuffle?<br />
PM: No I have not. There's no way in which Senator Walsh<br />
will be shifted. I mean, again I've been completely open<br />
and frank with the public about that and I'm prepared to<br />
just quickly to make the point again. It is a fact that<br />
Peter came and saw me. He said he was rather tired and it<br />
is an emotionally wearing portfolio as you know Mike. It's<br />
the Mr No. Peter is, you know, a profoundly decent man, he<br />
doesn't like having to say no to a lot of the things that<br />
we've had to say no to, or cutting back on some of the<br />
things we've had to cut back. He doesn't get any personal<br />
pleasure out of that, but he's had to do it and that imposes<br />
an enormous amount of strain. He talked to me about it, but<br />
as a result of those conversations he said ' well certainly<br />
I'm going to stay on'<br />
CARLTON: You will go to the next<br />
PM4: shifting from that portfolio.<br />
CARLTON: You will go to the next election with the Ministry<br />
substantially the same as it is now?<br />
PM: Yes indeed.<br />
CARLTON: There's rumblings, a lot of rumblings at the<br />
moment about an election in July. Would you rule that out?<br />
PM: Look, this desperate, shallow Howard is ru nning around,<br />
and every time he opens his mouth he's incapable of saying<br />
it as it is. Now for reasons best known to himself and<br />
which are fairly clear though, I guess, he's trying to say a<br />
July election because he's trying to create some impression<br />
that the tax cuts that we've promised now for a very long </p>
<p>( PM cont): time on the basis of our consistently worked out<br />
policies, including policies in the area of tax, we've<br />
consistently said, from way back in last year, they'll be<br />
coming in from July 1.<br />
CARLTON: Alright.<br />
PM: So that decision is based upon our clearly and<br />
consistently formulated policies. This policy-less fellow<br />
who can't get out a policy on anything, the bloke who told<br />
us early last year that all his policies, including tax<br />
policy, would be out by August of 1988 and still hasn't got<br />
his policy out, still won't tell the people what it is,<br />
where he's going to cut their expenditures in education,<br />
defence, health and so on to pay for additional tax cuts.<br />
Still can't do that. He's got to try and cover and say ' oh<br />
well, the Government is bringing their tax cuts out then<br />
because they're going to have an election in July'. Wrong<br />
again. He can't ever get it right. One of the reasons he<br />
can't get it right is because he can't get his own policy<br />
position. He failed to deliver on the promises he's made,<br />
that he would have his own tax policies ready by August of<br />
last year. So what does he do? Tries to divert attention<br />
by saying there's going to be an election in July? Every<br />
time he opens his mouth he's wrong, he's wrong on this.<br />
CARLTON: I'm going to ask you again, are you ruling out a<br />
July election then?<br />
PM: I'm ruling out a July election.<br />
CARLTON: Flatly, no chance?<br />
PM: Flatly, no chance.<br />
CARLTON: I've got to follow it along then, is it going to<br />
be later on this year?<br />
PM: Look, I have nothing to add to what I've said. If<br />
there's one area where I've been totally consistent in<br />
regard to elections, the next election, is this. I have<br />
said, I repeat to you, that the period that one would talk<br />
about would be from the end of this year, the latter part of<br />
this year until approximately the middle of 1990. I repeat,<br />
I don't feel myself in an 1989 election mode.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, can I throw a personal question at you?<br />
You've probably had enough of those in the recent days, but<br />
you're campaigning up in the Hunter region aren't you,<br />
Singleton, around there?<br />
PM: When you say campaigning. I am up in Singleton, I'm<br />
talking to you from a motel room in Singleton. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
CARLTON: Alright, you're meeting the people, is what I'm<br />
getting at?<br />
PM: Yes, but I'm just making a point. It's not a semantic<br />
point when I say I'm not campaigning. I mean, that means<br />
that when I've been in Singleton or elsewhere in the months<br />
after the last election, I'm campaigning. Part of my<br />
interest in politics, part of the thing that I get the most<br />
joy about is moving around the country ( interrupted) that's<br />
what I'm doing at the moment.<br />
CARLTON: This is what I want to ask you about, simply this.<br />
The statement you made on the Clive Robertson interview that<br />
you'd been unfaithful to Mrs Hawke, how has it been received<br />
in this meeting of the people that you've done in the last<br />
couple of days?<br />
PM: All I can say just let me make one point as to the<br />
statement I made on that program I had no idea as to what<br />
I was going to be asked, I was asked a question, I answered<br />
it honestly, directly, not for any political purpose at all<br />
because when I get asked a question about life, well my<br />
record shows that I answer them as they come. It wasn't<br />
made for any reason other than that. What's the reaction?<br />
All I can say is that the people that I meet both in numbers<br />
and attitude are as enthusiastic as they have ever been.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, Prime Minister thanks very much.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Mike.<br />
