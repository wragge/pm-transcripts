ASIAN TOUR 1967<br />
STATEMENT TO THE PRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. H AROLD HOLT, AT MASCOT AIRPORT, SYDNEY APRIL, 1967<br />
Tony Eggleton has explained that I feel my first respcosibility,<br />
so far as any detailed report is concerned, is to make my report to the<br />
Parliament. I have given an assurance that If Parliament is in session, it<br />
should be the first to hear matters of substantial political importance, but I<br />
am able, I feel, to m~ ake some broad comments to you, and-hope this will be<br />
of some assistance in the task you have.<br />
First, I would say that this has been one of the most<br />
rewarding and valuable official journeys I can ever recall having made. It<br />
exceeded my best expectations in meeting the purposes for which I set out.<br />
I don't really think it could have gone better from my point of view or, for<br />
that matter, from Australia's point of view.<br />
Tisl was, in the case of each of the four countries visited,<br />
the first time an Australian Prime Minister had been there. This fact was<br />
very much appreciated. You will have gathered from the press accounts that<br />
wherever we went we were greeted with not only friendliness but a warmth of<br />
friendliness which was very gratifying and encouraging. Those who had feared<br />
that our foreign policies might have antagonised the countries of Asia, I think,<br />
would have taken some comfort from what we encountered.<br />
I didn't, in any country visited, experience a hostile banner,<br />
a hostile voice, a sour look, whether at the official level or amongst the<br />
people we met or those we saw as we moved about the cities and the countryside.<br />
So I think it can be quite confidently accepted that there is a wealth of<br />
friendliness for Australia in that area of the world.<br />
It became clear to me that Australia had become accepted<br />
as a member of the Asian and Pacific community, that we were not on the<br />
outside looking in. We were regarded as one of the countries of the area<br />
involved in its problems and, at the same time, able to make our own useful<br />
contribution to it. The Press tell me that they were very well received wherever<br />
they went. It was a mark of the warmth of friendliness which Cambodia, and<br />
Prince Sihanouk In particular, feels towards Australia in that the press were<br />
allowed to enter there in that substantial body which accompanied me. There<br />
is an official policy denying entry to Cambodia for journalists from countries<br />
which are held to pursue differing polcies in respect of Viet Nam, but our<br />
pressmen were made welcome. They attended official functions hosted by<br />
the Head of Government, the Head of State and they tell me that wherever they<br />
went they were particularly well received.<br />
As far as every area of governmental Interest economic,<br />
political and security is concerned I am sure this visit has contributed<br />
very valuably to Australian purposes in all these directions. One of the<br />
discoveries for me and there were many discoveries on this journey was<br />
the strength of South Korea, the extraordinary industrial growth there, the<br />
bright trade prospects they see with Australia. </p>
<p>-2<br />
This was true also of Taiwan. Both these countries have<br />
very high economic growth rates; both see a rapidly-growing trade with<br />
Australia. Both, for example, intend to set up an iron and steel lu1dustry,<br />
and will be looking to Australia for the iron ore required by these industries.<br />
However, I won't go into too much detail on those matters because I shall<br />
be elaborating on them in Parliament.<br />
I tri ad to project an Australian attitude of fairness and<br />
friendliness, but the views we put we hold to firmly. I expressed them<br />
forthrightly and with frankness but in a spirit of friendliness and they were<br />
well received in that spirit wherever we went.<br />
I am sure that my own knowledge of the countries visited,<br />
and that of the official party which accompanied me has been greatly<br />
improved. We have a deeper understanding, a more realistic understanding<br />
of the problems of the countries concerned. It was an educational tour<br />
in a sense. That education has led to a better knowledge; the better<br />
knowledge has produced a deeper understanding, and out of that understanding<br />
there has developed a warmer and more enduring friendship for us.<br />
So altogether I feel that the journey has been very well<br />
worthwhile and that Australian interests have been promoted as a<br />
consequence of it. Thank you. </p>
