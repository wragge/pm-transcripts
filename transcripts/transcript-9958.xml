Ray Groom has been a good Premier of Tasmania. </p>
<p>His decision announced today, to relinquish that position was his own. He will carry with him the good wishes of Tasmanians and Liberals all around Australia. </p>
<p>Mr Groom and I served together for a period of time as fellow Ministers in the Fraser Government. Hie made a highly successful transition to State politics and led the Liberal Party to a very strong victory in the 1992 Tasmanian elections. </p>
<p>His government has been one of integrity and commitment to the future<br />
welfare of all Tasmanians. </p>
<p>On a personal note, I wish Ray, his wife Gillian and their children the very best for the future. </p>
<p>15 March 1996 </p>
