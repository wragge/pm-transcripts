BACKGROUND: In a statement released to the Press on 22 June, 1971,<br />
the Prime Minister said: " It should be remembered that in July 1964<br />
the Prime Minister of South Vietnam, then Major-General<br />
Nguyen Khanh, in a published letter addressed to the Heads<br />
of State of 34 countries, including Australia, had appealed<br />
for ' all the support you deem possible and opportune in<br />
order to help us successfully fight the communist aggression.'<br />
And as I have pointed out on another occasion,<br />
the Prime Minister of South Vietnam, Mr Tran Van Huong,<br />
in December 1964 in discussion with the Australian Minister<br />
for Air, then visiting Vietnam, and the Australian Ambassador,<br />
asked for an increased Australian military contribution.<br />
Mr Huong said the situation was now such that<br />
large scale assistance was urgently needed from all free<br />
nations ' in every form but particularly military'.<br />
On 29 April there was an exchange of letters<br />
between the Australian Ambassador and the Prime Minister<br />
of South Vietnam. In these letters, the Australian Government<br />
offered to send a battalion if one were requested, and the<br />
South Vietnamese Government accepted this offer and made<br />
its request in terms conforming with the requirements of the<br />
South-East Asia Treaty. </p>
