I,<br />
NIOTES FOR UOlliEIV'S H1ORNIhG TEA<br />
1. COMMIITTED TO IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERYONE,<br />
INCLUDING WOMEN, BUT GIVEN THAT WOMEN HAVE TENDED TO BE<br />
NEGLECTED, NECESSARY TO MAKE SPECIAL EFFORT TO ENSURE AS<br />
MUCH IMPROVEMENT AS POSSIBLE IN AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE TIME.<br />
2a APPOINTED ADVISOR ON WOMEN'S AFFAIRS. WIFE OFTEN<br />
COMMENTS THAT I SHOULD HAVE ONE ON MEN'S AFFAIRS, BUT POINT<br />
IS MEN HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED EN MASSE FOR CENTURIES AND<br />
WOMEN NEED SPECIAL VOICE. BACKING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S<br />
YEAR, NOT BECAUSE A GIMMICK BUT BECAUSE EXCELLENT WAY TO<br />
FOCUS ATTENTION ON BROAD SPECTRUM OF WOMEN S CONCERNS.<br />
3, HAVE PAID MORE rHAN LIPSERVICE TO I. WN, Y. $ 2 MILLION<br />
SET ASIDE. CONFERENCES BEING PLANNED ON WOMEN'S HEALTH,<br />
WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT AND WOMEN AND THE MEDIA PLUS MEXICO<br />
CONFERENCE AND CHOGM WIVES MEETING. MAY NOT LIKE BADGE<br />
BUT WILL HAVE SEEN IT ON STAMPS. MY SECRETARIAL STAFF<br />
AND PRESS OFFICE HAVE LIBERALLY DECORATED WITH " WOMEN<br />
ARE ON THE MOVE", " WOMEN ARE TRANSMOGRIFYING" AND " WOMEN'S<br />
PLACE IS EVERYWHERE" STICKERS$<br />
4. WOMEN'S PLACE IS CERTAINLY ON A NUMBER OF THE COMMISSIONS<br />
AND ADVISORY BODIES MY GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED<br />
ELIZABETH EVATT, ENID CAMPBELL, HILDA ROLFE, AND WOMEN IN<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE MARIE COLEMAN AND JEAN BATTERSBY. WOMEN IN<br />
THE HOUSE THE LOVELY JOAN CHILD, SENATORS MELZER AND COLEMAN<br />
AS WELL AS LIBERAL SENATORS GUILFOYLE AND MARTIN. TREMENDOUS<br />
CONTRIBUTION, o, . o/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
STILL GREAT CHALLENGE TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE TALENTS<br />
AVAILABLE. COMIMITTEE ON JOB DISCRIMINATION, FOR A START.<br />
HOW TO BRING ABOUT EQUAL PAY W ITHOUT PUTTING WOMEN OUT OF<br />
WORK. HOW TO MODERNISE WITHOUT MAKING PREVIOUSLY ESSENTIAL<br />
PROCESS WORKERS REDUNDANT? AWARE OF THE PROBLEM: ITS WHY SO<br />
MANY WAOMEN ANXIOUS TO GET A [ JEAT GRANT, WOMEN BEING<br />
EMPLOYED ON SOME OF THE RED GRANTS AND QUITE PROPERLY.<br />
THEN THERE ARE ALL THE VOLUNTARY WORKERS AND VOLUNTARY<br />
ENTHUSIASTS WHO MAY NOT CHOOSE TO GO OUT TO WORK BUT ARE<br />
NEVERTHELESS INVOLVED IN VITAL COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES DESIGNED<br />
TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT WHETHER THE OLD,<br />
THE VERY YOUNG, THE HANDICAPPED, YOUNG PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS1f<br />
FAMILIES WqITH PROBLIEMS THE VERY GROUPS UNABLE TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THEMSEL/ ES AND ABOUT WHOM my GOVERNMENT CARES, AND MY<br />
GOVERNMENT Z3REALISES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP<br />
VOLUNTARY ' ND ZHARITA3LE ORGANISATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS KIND<br />
OF WORK B; UT ALSO TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITHOUT<br />
CONTROL SO Th. A-i THE WORK CAN GO ON MORE EFFICIENTLY BUT WITHOUT<br />
LOSING THAT FERSONAL CONTACT WHICH IS VITAL.<br />
7. JUST THIS WEEK I VISITED THE Low HEAD GERIATRIC HOSPITAL<br />
AND SAW AT FIRST HAND THE EXCELLENCE OF THE ATTENTION GIVEN<br />
TO THESE OLD PEOPLE. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS I HAVE OPENED<br />
THREE OLD PEOPLES HOMES BUILT SINCE my GOVERNMENT INCREASED<br />
SUBSIDY PAYABLE TO ORGANISATIONS TO $ 4j FOR $ 1I FROM $ 2 FOR $ 1,<br />
TASMANIA HAS RECEIVED NEARLY $ 3 MILLION FOR SUCH ACCOMMODATION.<br />
WE REALISE THE NEED TO HOUSE OLD PEOPLE WITH AS MUCH<br />
INDIVIDUAL INDEPENDENCE AND COMFORT AS NECESSARY AND WE<br />
HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
8. THEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE THERE IS THE WHOLE<br />
RANGEOF CHLDHOOD SERVICES WHICH BENEFIT BT OHR N<br />
CHILDREN, i( ifi BEAZLEY POINTED OUT THAT 5,000 KINDERGARTEN<br />
PLACES ARE BEING PROVIDED IN TASMANIA NOT BY THE SCHOOLS<br />
COMMISSIONJ BUT BY THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION. AND I WANT<br />
TO KNOCK THE RUMOUR THAT IT FORESHADOWS A FEDERAL TAKEOVER<br />
OF PRESCHOOL EDUCATION. IT MEANS PURELY AND SIMPLY THAT<br />
MORE PLACES ARE AVAILABLE FOR KINDERGARTEN AGE CHILDREN.<br />
UNDER VARIOUS ACTS. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
PROVIDED 4) 298,000 FOR THE CITY OF LAUNCESTON TO PURCHASE LAND<br />
ANID CONSTRUCT A CHILD CARE CENTRE FOR 55 CHILDREN FROM<br />
YEARS, AND THE QUEEN VICTORIA HOSPITAL CRECHE HAS<br />
RECEIVED A $ 21,718 FOR STAFF SUBSIDY AND $ 6,127 ON A NEEDS<br />
BASIS. AT LILYDALE, A SINGLE UNIT PRESCHOOL WILL RECEIVE<br />
A $ 47,850 GRANT, AND ANOTHER AT YOUNGTOWN WILL GET $ 48,950,<br />
RAVENSWOOD PRIMARY WILL GET $ 111,000 FOR A DOUBLE UNIT<br />
PRESCHOOL. AN ADDITIONAL $ 119,000 GOES TO SUMMERDALE FOR<br />
SIMILAR UNITS. THEN THE TASMANIAN CHILD CARE ORGANISATION<br />
IS TO GET $ 10, 500 FOR THE FIRST YEAR'S OPERATION FOR<br />
LAUNCESTON FAMILY DAY CARE, PLUS A $ 13,000 RECURRENT<br />
PER CAPITA GRANT AND $ 1,700 FOR EQUIPMENT.<br />
AFTER THE PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON YESTERDAY, TWO WOMEN MADE<br />
A POINT OF THANKING ME FOR WHAT my GOVERNMENT HAS DONE FOR<br />
HANDICAPPED AND RETARDED CHILDREN. BUT OF COURSE WE DON' T GET<br />
MUCH PUBLICITY FOR THE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP IN THESE<br />
AREAS. k AS LONG AS PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES REALISE, THAT IS<br />
WHAT MATTERS MOST, BECAUSE YOU CARE MOST. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
IN 1973/ 74 WE MADE $ 179,368 AVAILABLE TO<br />
TASMANIA FOR SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT. THAT FIGURE ROSE LAST<br />
YEAR ON THE BASIS OF A $ 4 FOR $ 1 SUBSIDY FOR CAPITAL COSTS<br />
AND $ 1 FOR $ 1 FOR ELIGIBLE STAFF SERVICES TO NON-PROFIT<br />
ORGANISATIONS INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES,<br />
SIMILAR GRANTS COME UNDER ASSISTANCE FOR<br />
HANDICAPPED PERSONS INCLUDING A $ 4 FOR $ 1 RENTAL SUBSIDY<br />
TO ORGANISATIONS PROVIDING CENTRES, EQUIPMENT AND<br />
RESIDENTIAL HOLIDAY ACCOMMODATION FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN<br />
AND ADULTS, </p>
