THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO NATIONAL WITH PRU GOWARD<br />
E O E<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Well John Howard, welcome to the programme.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
You are well on your way to getting rid of that deficit, but what would you say was<br />
your ideology though, for deciding wvhat you would cut and what you wouldn't cut?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We wanted to deliver to the people and to the cause as we committed to ourselves to<br />
in the election campaign. Families with children, small business seeing smnall business,<br />
strengthen the small business sector as the true vehicle of reducing unemployment.<br />
You won't get unemployment down in this country in a lasting way until you get small<br />
business booming and all of our policies are directed towards doing that. That is why<br />
the passage of the industrial relations bill, the removal of the anti-employment unfair<br />
dismissal law which is a key element of that industrial relations bill that is why that<br />
legislation is so important. But I am very proud that this first Howard Budget has<br />
delivered to low to middle income families. They are the people, they are the heart of<br />
the constituency that we spoke to, the mainstream of the Australian community. I'm<br />
very proud, beyond belief, that this budget has delivered on our promise to those<br />
people.* Faoxm 21/ 8/ 96 12: 38 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from you went into the hostel when you go into the nursing home. Now, what has<br />
happened is the nursing homes have become starved of capital, they are not growing,<br />
many of them are becoming quite dilapidated, and unless you get more capital in to<br />
them and this was a very carefully thought through policy, I think it is a very good<br />
long range policy change...<br />
GO WARD;<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but there are a lot of people who are in a position to make a contribution to...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
What about somebody who doesn't own their own home, who<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there will obviously continue to be allowance and arrangements for people in<br />
necessitous circumstances. It's not going to deny a nursing home bed. In fact, it Will<br />
increase the capacity of the nursing home system to look after people who can't make<br />
any kind of contribution, At the moment they're starved of capital and absent growing<br />
government subsidies, the only way you can get a bit of capital into the system is to<br />
impose an entry charge. Now, I don't like doing it but it's necessary, it's defensible<br />
and it treats people exactly as they are now treated if they go into a hostel and you end<br />
this absurd situation where co-located nursing homes and hostels have an entry charge<br />
for the hostel but not for the nursing homes.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
I appreciate that. Now, the politics of this. Would you anticipate an interest rate cut?<br />
Do you think it's worth it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I hope we get some further cut in interest rates but I don't, nor does the<br />
Treasurer direct these things, that's a matter for the monetory authorities. But the<br />
budget last night did far more to set up an interest rate cut than the budget that was<br />
being urged on us by Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans. I mean if you really don't want<br />
an interest rate cut, do what they've been teling us to do over the last couple of<br />
months. GO WARD:<br />
Does Mal Colston's conversion to Independent mean to you that the budget is likely to<br />
get through? 21/ 08/ 96 12: 38 Pg: S </p>
<p>Fax from21/ 08/ 96 12: 38 Pg: 4<br />
GO WARD:<br />
There are hidden hurts for families there, aren't there? I mean, if you're...-<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, families are huge winners out of this budget.<br />
GOWARD: Unless they are in a government subsidised child care centre in which case they lose<br />
perhaps the lot.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They don't lose the lot, that is ridiculous. They still get the child care subsidy. They<br />
still get the...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
No, the subsidies..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no, they themselves still get the free subsidy. The free subsidy's not touched.<br />
Let me make that clear. I mean, what we are doing is we are taking away the<br />
operational subsidy for community based child care centres, such subsidies don't exist<br />
for private centres, we're not taking them away for family day care centres, that<br />
operational subsidy stays, we're not taking them away for occasional care or after care<br />
centres, but there is a very strong argument coming from the child care sector that to<br />
have an operating subsidy for the community based ones, which now include large<br />
numbers of people who are quite high income earners, but not have an operational<br />
subsidy while there is not operation subsidy for the private centres is quite inequitable,<br />
and it's a good policy change to withdraw that. But I emphasise that the &amp; ast growing<br />
family day care centre network is not affected by this change.<br />
GO WARD;<br />
All right. You've imposed an up-front contribution for people going into nursing<br />
homes which last night was reported to be as high as $ 26,000, isn't that just impossible<br />
for a lot of old people? -They have-to sell their homes...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
For a lot of people what we are doing is no more than what occurs now if you're going<br />
to a hostel. It's very important for people to understand that at the moment you have<br />
the situation that if somebody goes into a hostel there's an up-front charge, but even if<br />
it's part of the same complex and you go from a hostel into a nursing home there is a<br />
refund of the fee of the unexpended portion of the entry charge you made or paid when<br />
6 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Some of them and not all of the programs of the past government are being scuttled,<br />
but what we are doing is reducing the number down to about four. We are introducing<br />
an apprenticeship and training approach which will be simpler, it will tie the training<br />
process to outcomes, it will, through this new privatised case management approach, it<br />
will give people an incentive to find work for the people they're looking after. And the<br />
way society operates, if you give people an incentive you normally get a better result.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But if, as you say, at the end of the year the unemployment is only marginally increased<br />
it means for the whole year there are no labour market programs, nothing to do, no<br />
retraining, they sit around. I mean, it's a waste of peoples' lives.<br />
PRI[ ME MINISTER:<br />
But Pru, is a waste of a persons life to say to them : look, we'll kid you that something<br />
will be better after we've put you through this training program, when in reality it's<br />
not. The thing that those people want is the opportunity of a real job. If you have a<br />
more practical training and apprenticeship system you're more likely to provide that.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Do you think you'll keep the youth vote? You've made it very hard for them and their<br />
families, whether they're going into a job, maybe, and they don't become independent<br />
until they're 25 or whether they're going to paid,...<br />
PRIME IMISTER:<br />
That is in relation to Austudy the<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But it also applies to new staff for job start.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but look the...<br />
GOWARD: Do you think you'll keep the youth vote?<br />
PRIME NMSTER:<br />
I think the youth vote, like any other vote, will be a vote that will make its mind up at<br />
the end of our first term. I don't take it for granted. I don't take the family vote for<br />
granted. I don't take anybody for granted. Farxf t21/ 88/ 96 12: 38 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from COWARD:<br />
But do you agree that the tragedy for the budget and for all of us really, is that for all<br />
these cuts there isn't a cut in the unemployment rate this year?<br />
PRIME M[ NISTER:<br />
Well Pru, the forecast is for a modest improvement. But you know, we all know, that<br />
improvement on the unemployment front occurs but gradually. And the main<br />
determinant of unemployment improvement in this country will be the structures of the<br />
labour market, the incentives that are there because of an improved structure for<br />
employers to take on more staff. And until you fix those structures.. I1m ean, while<br />
ever we have an unfair dismissal law that literally frightens small businessmen out of<br />
taking on more staff and that is not an exaggeration, it is a truth which has been<br />
confirmed to me as recently as the last couple of weeks as I've gone around Australia<br />
until we get rid of that and we can't get rid of it until the Senate passes the law<br />
you're going to have a constraint on small business employment. And it can't be<br />
dismissed, It's no good people saying, oh well, you know, let's get back to the<br />
budget. But you asked me why aren't we having faster gains on the unemployment<br />
front, that's one of the reasons.<br />
GOWARD: All right. ACOSS is concern'ed about the unemployed. Now the labour market<br />
programs have taken a very big hit. But for a middle-aged guy with poor English there<br />
is nothing now for him to retrain with.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But if you look at all of the labour market programs Pru, all of them, you will see that<br />
many of them are a great waste of money. The former government established...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Well that's just economics.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well no, it's not just economics and if you are spending hundreds and millions of<br />
dollars and you're getting eight out of ten people passing through certain programs<br />
ending back on the unemployment list as soon as the program is over, that's not just<br />
bad economics, it's plain. a failure of commonsense. You don't continue to devote<br />
resources to that.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But some of those programs... Fa rom21/ 88/ 96 12: 38 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax rom21/ 08/ 96 12: 38 Pg: 6<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I hope that there's real meaning in what he said yesterday when he said that he<br />
accepts that the Government has an electoral mandate in certain areas, I hope it does<br />
and we'll just have to wait and see. He's become an Independant, we certainly hope<br />
that he'll support us on some things. I don't expect him to support us on everything.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
It was tricky politics wasn't it. I mean, you've broken a sort of an arrangement--.<br />
PIME MINSTER:<br />
Well, hang on, hang on. You know what happened in 1990. In 1990, we having<br />
agreed to re-elect unopposed the Labor Party Senate President, Kerry Sibtaa, right at<br />
the last minute the Labor Party came to us and said the deal is off chum, we don't like<br />
your nominee as Deputy President that nominee was Noel Crichton-B~ rown we're<br />
going to install our nominee. And do you know who their nomidnee was, Mal Colston.<br />
So don't anybody lecture us about broken arrangements in the Senate.<br />
A lot of Liberals here didn't like the Noel Crichton-Brown...<br />
PRIM NI~ STER:<br />
Yeah, but it doesn't alter the fact he was the nominated person. if there's a principle,<br />
it was torn up by Evans and Faulkner in 1990.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
John Howard, thank you for your time this morning. It's quite a selling job.<br />
PRIME MMiITERL<br />
Thank you.<br />
GOWARD. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia. </p>
