    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS* PM No. 128/1966</p>
<p>NEW YEAR MESSAGE</p>
<p>FROM THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT.<br />This is the first time it has been my privilege, to<br />offer as Prime Minister, New Year good wishes to the people of Australia.<br />I do so now confident that 1967 will prove to be a year of happiness and<br />prosperity for the great majority of my fellow Australians.<br />We find our country well placed for prosperous<br />expansion. In the coming years we should be reaping, to a growing<br />extent, the rewards of recent discoveries and of technological advance.<br />A rising world population will call increasingly on our capacity to produce<br />foodstuffs and other raw materilals. Improving efficiency will enable us<br />to place Australian products on a widening range of world markets.<br />We are a small nation measured by population but the<br />vigour and quality of our people our strength of national character, our<br />political and economic stability all enhance our significance as a nation in<br />the eyes of others. The darkest cloud on our scene is the conflict in Vietnam.<br />but even here the year just closing has brought notable improvement in the<br />situation. We have been stirred by the gallantry and devotion of our<br />fighting men. We shall all fervently hope that 1967 will bring a just and<br />honourable peace. We look forward to continuing our Australian contribution<br />to the Councils of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. We<br />are resolved to play a growing part in the affairs of Asia and the Pacific.<br />The good wishes I express from myself and my Government<br />are more than words. They are themselves a declaration of our dedication<br />and determination to apply ourselves successfully to those tasks which will<br />assure the security, the happiness and the prosperity of our people.<br />CANBERRA December 1966.</p>
