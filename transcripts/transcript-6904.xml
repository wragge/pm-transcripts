TRANSCRIPT OF BRIEFING BY THE PRIME MINISTER 14 MAY 1986<br />
ON VIP FLIGHT TO TOKYO<br />
PM: Well, essentially the visit to Japan is to consolidate the<br />
good relations at the leadership level that has already been<br />
created since 1983. I'll be taking the opportunity to re-emphasise<br />
our concern about the crisis in the international trade area as<br />
far as agriculture is concerned and in that context to tap into<br />
thoughts of another one of the seven major industrial countries.<br />
And in that sense we see this visit as a quite logical extension<br />
of the visit we have just made to America and Europe. Obviously<br />
the centrepiece of the visit to Japan will be the discussions<br />
tomorrow morning with Prime Minister Nakasone and I will also<br />
be meeting with four leading Cabinet ministers and that is<br />
Foreign Minister Abe, Finance minister Takeshita, Miti Minis Uer<br />
Watanabe and Agriculture Minister Hata.<br />
Now quite clearly the prime focus of these discussions will be<br />
economic and in the terms that I have mentioned. But I will also<br />
be taking the opportunity to discuss a wide ranging number of<br />
issues in the international political and security fields. Without<br />
being exhaustive about that we will be talking about the, and<br />
certainly I will be wanting to hear from Prime Minister Nakasone,<br />
about the strategic situation in North Asia. And one particular<br />
area that I would be wanting to talk with him in the light of the<br />
latter part of get an assessment from Prime Ministe-r<br />
Nakasone of developments in the Philippines. I will be informing<br />
him of our desire to increase assistance there and I will take this<br />
opportunity of trying to commence by specific discussions as to<br />
how, with others, we may be able to ensure that aid which goes to<br />
the Philippines is most effectively co-ordinated.<br />
Now clearly as I was saying the initial focus of the economic<br />
discussions will be on the recent Tokyo Summit conclusions.<br />
I would be interested to hear from Prime Minister Nakasone his<br />
assessment of the Summit for international exchange,<br />
rates and for the whole MTN range of issues. And in that latter<br />
respect I have particular interest on Australia's behalf as-* to<br />
the question of the timing of the new round and to the prospectswithin<br />
that round for agricultural and trade issues to be given<br />
a prominent place. And we will be making it clear to Prime Minister<br />
Nakasone that we believe that the September GATT ministerial<br />
meeting should ideally represent the launch of the round.<br />
As far as bilateral issues are concerned I believe they are in<br />
fairly good shape. The trading relationship we don't expect<br />
those to dominate discussions. Rather I hope we will be able to<br />
spend a considerable amount on the opportunities now emerging<br />
for developing the economic relationship which in the past has<br />
been dominated by trade and agricultal and mineral products.<br />
I think that the opportunities for those new directions are<br />
indicated by the substance of the Maekawa Report that was commissioned<br />
as you know by Prime Minister Nakasone. And they suggest that there<br />
is considerable scope for broadening the economic relationship<br />
between our countries. There is an increasing complementarity I<br />
believe between the two economies and with the recent depreciation, </p>
<p>2.<br />
substantial depreciation of the Yen against the Australian dollar<br />
and with the improved market access opportunity that exists, the<br />
opportunities for increased industrial co-operation I think a new<br />
range therefore of the basis for our economic relationship are<br />
emerging. And I think the sorts of things that we have been doing<br />
Australia particularly in the deregulation of the financial area<br />
to give an added basis for . some optimism in that respect.<br />
In saying those things I don't want to appear by implication to<br />
be downgrading trade and agricultural and mining products.<br />
Well that in general terms covers what I hope to be dealing with<br />
in this period in Japan. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you more optimistic or pessimistic after the<br />
Tokyo Summit about the prospects for the September meeting?<br />
PM: Well I think on balance you have got reason to be somewhat<br />
more optimistic because for the first time in the Summit they<br />
did address themselves and for some considerable period of time<br />
to the question of agriculture. There was a recognition of the<br />
need for the new round to get underway. I would think on balance<br />
we are entitled to expect what is in the Summit will be using<br />
their endeavours to try and get an early start to the MTN round.<br />
And I will certainly be repeating to Prime Minister Nakasone what<br />
I said in America and Europe about the accordance of agriculture<br />
in the development of those at that round.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your concern about the aid being effectively<br />
co-ordinated<br />
PM: It is just that we said right at the beginning that it makes<br />
sense, obviously by definition, if ourselves, the Americans, the<br />
Japanese are going to be involved in trying to assist the new<br />
regime to tackle the basic social and economic problems that<br />
exist there, that it makes sense if it is possible to try and<br />
co-ordinate as far as possible the sort of things that we do.<br />
Now I am not implying by that that we are going to be able to<br />
establish some actual mechanism, some framework to achieve those<br />
results but I think it is the sort of thing that sensibly is<br />
capable of discussion at the level of leadership and then perhaps<br />
subsequently at the level of officials.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you prepared to give a comment on the balance of<br />
payments figures released yesterday?<br />
PM: You will be.-seeing that I will be saying in my speech in Japan<br />
that they are disturbing figures. But I believe that we can adapt<br />
our policy framework to ensure that the benefits of the depreciation,<br />
substantial depreciation that has occurred will flow into the<br />
economy. I will be addressing that at some in the speech.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you say how you will adapt it in the speech?<br />
PM: No, I won't be going into detail.-'<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this suggesting some major change?<br />
PM.: No, No, it is not suggesting some major change.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you mean by adapting policy?<br />
PM: Well, clearly we have got a situation where the level of growth<br />
that has occurred has been sucking in a very high level of imports,~<br />
and the sort of policies that we are pursuing will be directed to<br />
ensure that we don't continue to have an unsustainable level of<br />
imports. Now that will mean, and I am not saying anything new here,<br />
we have indicated that the rate of growth that we have had in the<br />
first three years will have to be somewhat subdued in this next<br />
financial year for that reason. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: So you don't think these figures were one-off?<br />
PM: I think that we have seen the worst of the figures.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you talking about fiscal or monetary policy<br />
particularly or signalling any<br />
PM: Oh look, let's retract it. The trouble with you is I suppose.<br />
you should be more careful'in your use of words. I am not trying<br />
to imply anything more than I spelt out to you now. It reinforced<br />
to me to ensure that the level of activity is not at an unsustainable<br />
high level. I mean you can't go on having an imbalance in your<br />
imports and exports at that sort of level.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you want some spending cuts?<br />
PM: That would always be nice. We won't be having a comprehensive<br />
May Statement of the type you have seen in the past. It maybe<br />
possible in respect of some * measures to get a full year benefit.<br />
But there won't be a similar sort of May Statement.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are the implications for wages policy from the<br />
lastest figures? Do you think you are going to require any fine<br />
tuning or re-adjustment<br />
PM: I think we will wait and see the outcome of the decision 6f the<br />
Arbitration Commission. But we will look at the whole range of<br />
policies as we go through but I don't see any need at this point<br />
to re-assess the policy which has been successful in the past in<br />
producing very, very considerable wage restraint. There is no<br />
comparable period in Australia's history when you have had economic<br />
growth averaging as it has at 5% plus over the last three. years<br />
where you have had associated with that such a low level of wages<br />
growth. So you have got to observe the success of the policies that<br />
have been in place. It would be silly to jettison policies which<br />
have produced a level of wage restraint far beyond anything.<br />
Australia has experienced in the past in comparable periods of<br />
growth. </p>
