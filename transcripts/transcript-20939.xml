    <content><![CDATA[<p>I announce today that the Australian Government is committing $7 million to 73 projects under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy.</p>
<p>  The Strategy is designed to support communities to develop practical and innovative solutions to local circumstances.  With the approval of these new projects, the Strategy has now funded 614 family and community projects.</p>
<p>It is my belief that families and communities are the backbone of a strong and healthy Australia with well functioning families the best safety net ever devised.  Strong communities always have a core of highly motivated people, many of them volunteers. Encouraging this enthusiasm within families and communities will achieve more success than the Government imposing its own views and solutions.</p>
<p> A fundamental aim of the Strategy is to undertake early intervention and prevention work that is responsive to communities' needs, with a strong focus on early childhood and parenting support.</p>
<p>Indigenous communities from across Australia have developed a great many of the projects funded today.  These projects vary in their range and scope, from providing a men's meeting place in Wujal Wujal to early intervention for children at risk in Tiwi Island to youth mentoring in Blacktown, Wyong and Tamworth.  What all these projects have in common is that they demonstrate the commitment of the Australian Government to supporting indigenous communities to develop solutions for their own circumstances.</p>
<p>  There are many more excellent projects that the Government is supporting.</p>
<p>  The Lake Macquarie Men's Sheds and Sustainable Employment Programme will receive $120,000 to provide practical activities for unemployed men to learn new skills.  The Programme will utilise these new skills through providing local employment opportunities in building and maintaining public housing estates.</p>
<p>The Unity of First People of Australia Ltd will receive $210,000 to implement the Diabetes Management and Care Programme in three remote indigenous communities in Western Australia. This programme is dedicated to curbing the incidence of diabetes amongst indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>The Latrobe City Council will receive $283,900 to introduce the Strengthening Seven Small Communities Project. The project will work with seven small rural townships in the Gippsland area of Victoria to develop self-help programmes aimed at tackling disadvantage and social isolation.</p>
<p>The Logan School to Work Programme Inc will receive $109,580 to provide practical assistance and personal support to young students who are pregnant or parenting to continue their education.</p>
<p>  It is only through such a partnership that families and communities can grow in strength.</p>
<p>A complete list of the projects that are receiving funding is attached.</p>
