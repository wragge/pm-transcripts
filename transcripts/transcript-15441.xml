    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister John Howard and NSW Premier Morris Iemma have agreed to additional assistance to help communities, small business owners and primary producers recover from the devastating damage caused by the floods in New South Wales. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Premier Iemma announced the establishment of two $500,000 Community Recovery Funds with equal contributions from the State and Commonwealth. </p>
<p>These funds will be used to address the needs of affected local communities in the Hunter region and the Central Coast, including:</p>
<p>   * Grants to community service organisations providing recovery services;<br />
   * Tourism and small business initiatives;<br />
   * Economic development initiatives; and<br />
   * Heritage and cultural site activities.</p>
<p>To assist small business owners and farmers, the Prime Minister and Premier have also agreed to jointly fund recovery grants of up to $15,000 for eligible small businesses and primary producers.  </p>
<p>These grants will assist with urgent clean-up costs such as the hire of equipment to remove debris, essential repairs to fittings and other basic restoration tasks.</p>
<p>"The Commonwealth and NSW Governments understand that these people need urgent financial assistance and not just talk to help them through this very difficult period," Prime Minister Howard said.</p>
<p>"We have a shared commitment to a quick and smooth approval process for the grants."</p>
<p>Mr Iemma said the assistance is over and above the support the Commonwealth and NSW Governments provide under standard Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.</p>
<p>"The Hunter and Central Coast communities have borne the brunt of the most severe weather conditions in recent memory and it's appropriate that there is a co-ordinated effort to help them on the road to recovery."</p>
