FOR MEDIA 20 JUNE 1979<br />
INVITATION FOR JAPANESE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION<br />
TO VISIT AUSTRALIA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, announced today his intention<br />
to issue an invitation to the Japanese Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. YMasayoshi Ohira, for members of the Japanese Diet -to<br />
visi t Australia each year.<br />
The i" nvitation is designed to reciprocate a similar scheme<br />
hosted by the Japanese Government in which members of the<br />
Austr-alian Government Parties and Opposition, in separate<br />
delegations, have visited Japan each year.<br />
The proposed new scheme would be administered by the<br />
Dezaritment of Foreign Affairs.<br />
Mr. Fraser said this scheme would be a valuable addition to<br />
the two existing arrangements under which Japanese Diet<br />
members are invited to visit Australia. Under the first<br />
scheme the Australian Parliament invites a mixed group of<br />
eight Japanese Diet members to Australia for 14 days every<br />
two years. The Japanese Diet reciprocates in the alternate<br />
years. Under the second scheme, the Government each year invites<br />
two foreign Parliamentary delegations of eight members to<br />
visit Australia for 10 to 14 days. Each country's turn<br />
to send a delegation occurs only infrequently because of the<br />
lar-ge number of countries covered by the scheme.<br />
Background The regular exchange of Parliamentary delegations is<br />
im-' c'-4-ant in fostering a better first hand understanding<br />
amongst Japanese legislators of Australian conditions, problems,<br />
and policies. The Government places particular emphasis on<br />
relations with Japan which will play a crucial part in<br />
preserving the future stability and development in our region.<br />
