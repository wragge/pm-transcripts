    <content><![CDATA[<p>Motorists will be able to travel toll-free along the $890 million Scoresby Freeway linking Ringwood, Dandenong and Frankston from mid-2008.</p>
<p>Construction should begin in 2002, subject to Victoria advancing the planning processes.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and Victorian Governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding confirming the Federal Government’s requirement that each government contribute to the construction of the Scoresby Freeway on a 50:50 basis.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Commonwealth will be contributing $445m.</p>
<p>In the May Budget the Commonwealth allocated $220m over five years towards the construction of the freeway. The balance of Commonwealth funds of around $225m will be provided over the financial years 2005-06 to 2007-08.</p>
<p>Labor in Victoria has engaged in political posturing over the Scoresby Freeway, involving meaningless pledges and “cardboard promises” that have only served to confuse the public and create uncertainty.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that Labor went into the last State election opposing the Scoresby Freeway.</p>
<p>The Scoresby Freeway between Ringwood and Frankston will deliver major national economic benefits and will be a catalyst for industrial and commercial development.</p>
<p>The new freeway will provide better links from major industrial areas along the Scoresby Corridor to ports, airports and other major freight routes. More than 350,000 jobs – representing 28 per cent of Melbourne’s total workforce – are located in the Scoresby Transport Corridor.</p>
