    <content><![CDATA[<p>The allegations of racism levelled at me and the Liberal Party by the New South WalesÂ Secretary of the ALP, Mr John Della Bosca, were completely baseless.</p>
<p>They were the desperate smears of a man and a Party who have nothing relevant to sayÂ about the bread and butter issues of concern to mainstream Australia.</p>
<p>Mr Della Bosca's outburst was typical of the McCarthyist tactics of the Keating era and toÂ which I drew attention in my speech to the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party twoÂ weeks ago.</p>
<p>There can be no earthly justification for what he said.</p>
<p>That the Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, should leave Mr Della Bosca's remarks unrebukedÂ displays both hypocrisy and weakness.</p>
<p>Accordingly to Mr Beazley, I have an obligation to comment in detail on the maiden speechÂ of an independent member of Parliament, yet he as Labor leader carries no responsibility forÂ what the General Secretary of the largest branch in his own Party says at the annualÂ conference of that branch.</p>
<p>It is hard to conceive of a greater double standard.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real explanation is that Mr Della Bosca was the ventriloquist's dummy.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, I have confirmed the non-discriminatory character of Australia'sÂ immigration policy. On several occasions, I have said that as a group Aborigines are theÂ most disadvantaged of all Australians.</p>
<p>The crowning hypocrisy is that these smears have come from the General Secretary of theÂ NSW Labor Party which has just concluded a preference deal for the Lindsay by-electionÂ with Australians Against Further Immigration. It was his association with this group whichÂ was one of the reasons why the federal Member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, wasÂ expelled from the Labor Party last year.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley has a clear duty to either repudiate Mr Della Bosca's comments or attempt toÂ justify them.</p>
