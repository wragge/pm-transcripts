SINGAPORE<br />
E ZOThur-sday 27 March 19977<br />
Thank you Ver much MW Kwak Leng loo, to Mr Craig Bell, to other distinguished<br />
guests, ladies and gentlemen. Can I thank both the Council 4d the Federation for<br />
providing me with this excellent forum on the first day of m4 visit to Singapore and<br />
on the first day of a very importantjourney as Ptime Minist o Asrai to two very<br />
important countries in our region. I<br />
This fonvm is to say somnething about the relaionship betwe Australa and<br />
Singapore and to put that relationship in the broader context If our regional<br />
involvement and also in the broader contex of our joint conillituent to the cause of<br />
economic progress of private enterprise and of czonornrc refofm and trade<br />
liberalisation. I first visited Singapore long before I entered Parliament. In 1964 1 first camne to your<br />
country. A very different country from what it is now. And I visited it long before 1,<br />
of course, had any association with the Parliamentary political life of Australia.<br />
I was shown around Singapore by a student who bad spent a ~ g part of her years<br />
imtnediately out of school at Sydney University. She was a f ' nd of aL Close Cousin of<br />
mine. And that little story is in some senses a metaphor for trrelationship that exits<br />
at a people to people level betwveen so many Australians and sp manry Singaporeans.<br />
It was infa ct the first foreign country that I went to. I didn't f y over it, or evcn just<br />
through it, on the way elsewhere. And I did spend some time ~ iralthough, of<br />
course, La going on elsewhert. r<br />
Over that period that bAs gone by s ince then 33 years Shunapre has transformed<br />
hersef and bas become within the world one of the outstandiug examples of what can<br />
be achieved if you really pursu policies based on openness a trade liberalisation-<br />

Australia's ties with Singapore are very deep. TheyI are very' long. They are etched in<br />
historical experiences, economic co-operation and a geography in an economic and<br />
political fixture that brings us together as part of the fastst growing area,<br />
economically, of the worcl. The contribution that Australia 4as made to the security<br />
of Singapore and this part of the world in years gone by is well known and is properly<br />
honoured by all Australians. We are at present partners in AjPEC and I watched with<br />
some admiation the hosting of the inaugural World Trade O~ anisation meeting here<br />
in Singapore, by your Prime Minister, at the end of last year.<br />
I come here today, ladies and gentlemen as the Leader of a iu new Australian<br />
Government which is absolutely committed to the deepest pcjssible involvement of<br />
our couty ina the affairs of the Asia-Pacific region. I say not as some kind of<br />
ritalistic repeating of a foreign affairs trade mantra but as a # eeply held view of mine<br />
that the politica and economic destiny of Australia is very glach tied up with us<br />
successfuly being a full time player in the Asia-Pacific regoi Te growt oa our<br />
trade to this region, the increasing two-way economic flows ~ f investment and trade<br />
between countries such as Australia and Singapore are test ents to the importance of<br />
the region to Australias futue.<br />
The APEC groupii4 of nations is in many ways oneoftemsexrrdny<br />
groupings of ziafior~ s that the world has seen. It brings togc some very large<br />
economics, in &amp; 4ct the two largest and most powerful econo ' es in the worldith<br />
United States and 1lpan. It brings the most populous nation cfthe world in China,' it<br />
brings nations such as Australia and Now Zealand which ham a deep regional<br />
economic and political future tied up with this part of the wor d but equally strong and<br />
unambiguous ties with Europe and North Amerima It brings e grea t economic<br />
success storics sucl# as Singapre and it brings tha remakabie ahievement of anation<br />
such as Indonesia, which over the last 25-30 years has seen sme 3,000 islands hang<br />
together in very effective political unison.<br />
pSeoo, pitl eiss ao fq iutsit em eexmtrbaeorr dniantaioryn sg trhoeu ppirnogs paencdt tiht aist tah rgoruoguhp intrga dteh<br />
being of those popu~ ations can be greatly enhanced. And I<br />
opportunity of saying how committed my G-overnment is to<br />
Achieving those APEC goals will involve adjustmient by all o<br />
Australia is no exception to tha.<br />
The process of domestic economic and political adjustment to<br />
globalisation is not an easy one it does require political skills<br />
level and a capacity to explain often to sceptical domestic popi<br />
of trade fibemlisation. Your country in its way, Singapore, hal<br />
example of ' having done that and Australia looks with some en<br />
tha Singapre has chalked up in thw area. Lholds out to the<br />
iberalisation the well<br />

1 also speak to you today as thc Leader of. 4 GoyCcrunnt in 4ustralia which is very<br />
heavily committed to a program of sensible economic changp and reform. Reforming<br />
and changing anr economy is never an easy task and in the 1190' s, which are in some<br />
ways a little more sceptical towards the cause of economic rformn than were the<br />
19901S) it is a particularly challenging task.<br />
We act ourselves when we were elected to Goverum a nurraber of important<br />
economic and~ c political goals. We set ourselves the task of fl.' cal consolidation. We<br />
inherited an underlying budget deficit of about 10 billion Ai~ stralian dollars. And we<br />
set ourselves the task of achieving an anderlyig balan~ ce ove; a period of over some<br />
three years.<br />
We are making vezy solid progress down that path but it is nq an easy dorestic<br />
political challenge.<br />
we also sct ourselves the challenge of significant industrial rilations reform.<br />
Awrtralia has many mtengths as an economy-It is a stable, open, profoundly<br />
democratic society with a very predictable and absolutely in" rraptible legal<br />
But it has also unfortunately had a rather arthritic old fashiom' out of date industrial<br />
relations system. Arnd, although, over the last 10 or 15 years has shed some of the<br />
undesirable features of that system, the progress and the pro" s has not been nearly<br />
rapid enough, And one of the thiings of which I am paticul4 proud is that over the<br />
past 12 months we have dramafically bastened the process of dustrial relations<br />
reform. -And as a result of the Australian Government's new ! Tork Place Relations<br />
Act we are now drivyig towards an industrial relations system which is based upon a<br />
numbe of fundamcntal principles.<br />
The first of those is that we should encourage to the maximum extent possible the<br />
maliing of agreements between employers and employees at the individual work place<br />
leveL Because, it is through that process that you cmn best enhance optimum<br />
productivity outcomes in each individual enterprise.<br />
We are also strongly committed to the principle of voluntary association. Under the<br />
Work Place Relations Act Australians are guaranteed the righ to join or not to join a<br />
trade union without any fear of sanction or discrimination according to the choice that<br />
is taken. We have re-established the rule of law within Australia in relation to certain<br />
forms of industrial behaviour and industrial conduct and in a very general sense we<br />
are driving towards an industrial relations system which puts tle greatest possible<br />
emnphasis on contractual udsadngs and undertakings between employers and<br />
employees. I<br />
The response to that legislation has been very strong and very positive and I tbink it<br />
will help to build even further on the deserved internatonal repplation of Auwal~ ia as<br />
being a stable, reliable, c-ohesive couhtry in which to invest. Wp have also embarked<br />
on a progam of conomic change and economic reform in other areas where the<br />
proess of change has not been rapd enough. And I have in mind in areas of<br />
communications wher on the first of July this ycar we will have an essentially<br />
deregulated comnctons system within Australia. </p>

I think also, Of changes that we have in mind in relation to the waterfront and Ihe<br />
forts in Australia which in the past have sometime contribute to the occasional bad<br />
international newspaper notice so far as Australia's economic performawnce is<br />
concerned. We are embarking vpon an intelligent program of privalisatiort. We have secured<br />
Parliamentary approval to a sale of one third of Telstra which is Australia's uational<br />
telecommuvications company. Incidentally, out of the procceds of that one third we<br />
will be investing over one billion dollars in the establishment of the natural heritage<br />
trust of Australia which will fund the largest ever capital investment in Australia's<br />
history in the environmental renewal and regeneration of Australia.<br />
Over the pust couple of weeks we have announced a number of very signiiant<br />
changes and reforms which will directly boost small business in Australia. We still<br />
have in Australia an unemrployme~ nt wae at the unacceptably high level of 8.5% with a<br />
youth unemployment level of around 27%. 1 believe, and my Government believes,<br />
that revitalising and giving incentives to the small business community of Australia<br />
will do much over time to reduce the level of unemployment in AustraUla<br />
We have dramilti ally liberalised the capital gains tax regime for smnall business in<br />
Australia. We have brought in more sensible rules for einployee dismxissal in<br />
appropnaeu circumstances and we also ame providing sigaificant Governnt funds to<br />
encourage the start up of the small and medium sized firms with an emphasis on high<br />
technology. Now I mentioned some of those things. ladits and gentlemen, not so much to give a<br />
dttailcd litany of what has been done by my Government over the past 12 months.<br />
But rather to give an indication of some of the priorities that we have sud they arc<br />
priorities based upon the belief that I think has driven successive governments herm in<br />
Singapore and tOm is through a strong and vigorous private sector you have the best<br />
hope of providing jobs, you have the best hope of providing continued economlic<br />
growth. You need intelligent policy settings. It is the role of a responsible Govrnmnvt to<br />
provide a table maqrucconornic environment. It's also the role of a responsible<br />
Government to effectively educate the citizens of the nation it governs. It's also our<br />
role to provide decent infrastructure.<br />
Bcyond tha and having set the climate and established the rules, as your Prime<br />
Minste said to me N~ hs morning, it isrally up to theprivate sc or to zewpond to that<br />
very positive climate. And I know that the Chamber and the Coxncil in their own<br />
ways are doing very important thing to provide tWa stable and predictable economic<br />
climate for business investment and business exchaniges. Not only heme in Skqgpor<br />
and in Austra but between ouir two societies. </p>

The relationship between Australian and Sinlgapore which is dependant on m~ any<br />
things, and riot leasn the people to people links, is a dynamic relationship and one that<br />
is constantly being renewed. Last year my predecessor, Paul Keating, signed the new<br />
partnershiP Agreemuent with the Prime Minister of Singapore and I am very happy to<br />
say that the goals and aspirations of that new partnership wec warmly endorsed by my<br />
Government And one of the stable constant elements in3 the relationship between our<br />
two countries is tha there is an essentially bipartisan approach between successive<br />
Australian governments towards the relationship.<br />
I don't pretend that as a result of the change of government in Australia nothing at all<br />
has changed so far as foreign policy is concerned. Obviously at diffcrent govornment,<br />
a new government, does things differently and has a different emphasis but the<br />
essential thrust which has now been a bipartisan constant of Australia's foreign policy<br />
over 25-30 years and that thrust is towards an ever increasing cornuzimct to the<br />
Asia-Pacific regionj<br />
It is sometimes forgotten that the foundation stone of the association between<br />
Australia and Asia economicaly was laid by John McEwen who helped write the<br />
Axisiralia-Japan free trade agreement in 1957. The people to people links that was<br />
sporned by the great Colombo Plan started not long after World War HI is, of course,<br />
something of which mn~ y people in Singapore and cisewbere in the region arm very<br />
conscious. And over the years Prime Minsters and Trade Ministers, of both sides of Austraa<br />
politics, have made a particular contribution, And today I am happy to say that the<br />
Prne Minister of Singapore and I ann unce a new aviation agreement that is going<br />
to dramatically increase the flow of traffic between Australia and Singapore and<br />
beyond. It will resuilt in somethiing like a 37.5% increase in the number of passengers<br />
carried by air between our two countries. It will inrae by 100% the available<br />
freight carriage out of Australa into Singapore. And given the importance thai my<br />
Government places on the Supermarket to Asia strtegy which involves, amongst<br />
other things, the capacity for Australia to export effectively into the region fresh food<br />
that new capacity will mnake a very important contribution.<br />
That is but one of many examples that continue to occur of the deepening links<br />
between~ our two societies. We do live in a world which has been rewiered very<br />
different by the end of the Cold War, the collapse of commrrunism in Eastern Europe<br />
and all the other changes that followed that development. In many ways the world in<br />
which we live has had taken away from it some of the predictable antagonisms that<br />
govern the foreign relations of most countries from the end of World War 1I. And<br />
some have thought that has introduced a new volatlity jt0 the conduct of our affairs<br />
and not least into the conduct of the affairs of the region.<br />
But beyond that we live in a world of enormous opporwuifty and it is impossible to be<br />
a political participant in dhe affairs of the Asia-Pacific region without feeling some<br />
sene of excitement a&amp; W real hope about what can be achieved. When I met the<br />
leaders of the othe meniber of the APEC community in Manilla towards the end of<br />
last year I felt that I was in a small way, but in a very important way, par of a proces </p>

which if everybody held their nerve about it lifted up the hopes and the aspiratons of<br />
millions of people who lived within those conimunities. if we cmn achieve that ideal<br />
of greater trade liberalisation, if we can miatch the aspirations of those goals, if we can<br />
continue to carry our domestic political constituencies with us in the cause of trade<br />
liberalisation then I do believe that the hopes that many people placed in that<br />
organisation will not be disappointed. Because economic prosperity and economic<br />
co-operation between nations has in the past been proved to be the foundation of<br />
peaceful co-operation. And the stability of this part of the world and the stability of<br />
the political association, for example, between Australia and Singapore owes as great<br />
deal to the economic maturity of both of those societies.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australia is a very open and tolerant society. We are proud of<br />
the fact that, amongst other things, in the late 1970' s we took more Indo-Chinese<br />
refugees on a per capita basis than any other nation in the world. We ame immensely<br />
proud of the contribution thAt Australians of Asian descnt, whether of Chinese or<br />
Indian, or from any other part of Asia, we are immensely proud of the contribution<br />
that those Australians are making to the future of oujr country.<br />
The people of Singapore whether they come as visitors or as students, or ais business<br />
men and women, or as migrants are very welcome in Australia. The bonds that keep<br />
our two countries close together are personal bonds, they are political bonds, they are<br />
ties of history, they are ties of common commitment against tyranny and oppression<br />
and they ane also ties of hope about the economic future of our two societies.<br />
I come here as the head of a Government that has great goodwill towards the people<br />
of Singapore as the head of the Government that has a very strong commitment to the<br />
deepest possible involvement in Australia in the affairs of the Asia-Pacific region. I<br />
believe tha the best yeas of the association in prosperity and in political partnership<br />
between Australia and Singapore lie before us-<br />
Thank you. </p>
