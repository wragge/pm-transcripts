    <content><![CDATA[<p>As the Australian mission in Uruzgan Province comes to an end, it’s more important than ever to support our troops and their families.</p>
<p>We cannot ask our young men and women to put themselves in harm’s way for our country without giving them the best possible care on their return.  This is especially true for those who have returned with physical and mental scars.</p>
<p>After today’s ceremony to mark the closure of the Australian‑led Provincial Reconstruction Team, two cricket kits were presented: one for the Australian troops and one for their local Afghan partners. It’s my hope that there might soon be an opportunity for a cricket match between Australian troops and Afghanistan troops to take place in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Also gifted were two bats signed by members of the Australian XI.  Defence will be donating these bats to charities providing support to wounded members of the ADF and their families: Soldier On and Mates4Mates.</p>
<p>Soldier On and Mates4Mates will be able to use these commemorative bats to raise funds for their work.</p>
<p>Supporting these charities, along with the RSL and Legacy, is a good way to acknowledge the work of our armed forces.</p>
