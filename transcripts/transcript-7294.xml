CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED, UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF CLUB* 88 AT WORLD EXPO 88<br />
BRISBANE 29 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
Sir Edward Williams,<br />
Sir Liew Edwards,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
We are now some two months into our Bicentennial year and<br />
have already shared such memorable events as the<br />
' Australia Live' telecast, the start of the year-long<br />
journey around the continent by the Australiah Bicentennial<br />
Exhibition, and the Australia Day celebrationt on Sydney<br />
Harbor which were without doubt the most spectacular ever<br />
witnessed in this country.<br />
A full year of special activities is set to unfold for the<br />
remainder of 1988. Some, the result of years of careful<br />
planning, have a high public profile, international<br />
participation and will attract world wide attention. Others<br />
are organised at a community level and are built simply on<br />
the enthusiasm and commitment to Australia of its citizens.<br />
One event on the Bicentennial calendar stands out because it<br />
exhibits all of these characteristics. It is a major<br />
internationbA event involving many years of careful<br />
planning; i~ t has attracted some 50 government and<br />
corporate participants; but with ticket sales far in excess<br />
of predictions it has also obviously struck a powerful chord<br />
at the community level.<br />
I am, of course, referring to World Expo 88 in Brisbane.<br />
World Expo 88 will be an undoubted highlight of the<br />
Bicentenary, and I am proud to be associated with it.<br />
I share the confidence of the organisers and commentators<br />
alike that ~ world Expo 88 will be an outstanding success.<br />
my government will continue to support Expo 88 through<br />
the office of the Commissioner-General, Sir Edward Williams,<br />
and his staff, and through our participation as an<br />
exhibitor. 004671 </p>
<p>I pay tribute to Sir Liew Edwards, and his staff, for their<br />
dedication to the task of nurturing this project from its<br />
early, difficult, times. Today we see a very advanced site<br />
with participants fitting out their pavilions with, what<br />
promises to be the world's most exciting exhibits.<br />
Expo 88 is not a trade fair but a world fair. It is a<br />
unique gathering of nations brought together to review human<br />
achievement, an unparalleled opportunity for nations to meet<br />
and participate in cultural and technological exchanges.<br />
The opening of Club 88 marks yet another stage in Expo's<br />
development; it symbolises the confidence we all<br />
organisers and participants share in World Expo 88.<br />
With the Business Visitor Program in place, and with so many<br />
governments and corporate participants committed to attend,<br />
Expo 88 offers an excellent opportunity for Australians to<br />
establish business and personal contacts of lasting<br />
significance. Club 88 offers excellent private facilities,<br />
on location, to further these contacts.<br />
Club 88 will provide high quality facilities for members to<br />
entertain their guests, and membership carries with it the<br />
opportunity to participate in major ceremonies and official<br />
functions.<br />
Club 88 is an excellent example of Australian enterprise,<br />
but it does not stand in isolation; it is part of Expo 88<br />
and it complements the other facilities and activities being<br />
planned. It is part of the overall picture; just as Expo 88<br />
itself is part of our nation's overall Bicentennial<br />
celebrations. Ladies and gentlem en<br />
The Bicentenary is more than a celebration; 1988 is also a<br />
year of reflection.<br />
Australia in 1988 is a dynamic, modern nation, a nation with<br />
much to be proud of but with much still to achieve. we are<br />
a young nation in an ancient land; a land w~ hose history<br />
reaches back-' beyond 1788 through some 40,000 years of<br />
Aboriginal culture.<br />
The Bicentenary provides an opportunity for us to consider<br />
what we have achieved as a nation, and what form of<br />
individual contribution each of us might make toward<br />
Australia's future.<br />
This ceremony prompts us to reflect on the achievement of<br />
those who have worked to bring us World Expo 88, and to<br />
consider what efforts we as individuals might make to<br />
emulate this contribution to Australia's development.<br />
I commend Club 88 to you, and have great pleasure in<br />
declaring it open. 004672 </p>
<p>SENATOR MARGARET REYNOLDS, MINISTER ASSISTING<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN<br />
LAUNCH OF THE NATIONAL AGENDA FOR WOMEN<br />
MONDAY, 29 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
BONDI JUNCTION PLAZA,<br />
SYDNEY<br />
4.. 004673 </p>
<p>This is a day of great significance for the women of<br />
Australia. It not only marks women's progress in having<br />
their voices heard, but also signifies the progress of<br />
Governments in introducing social reform.<br />
This is the first time a Government has reached out and<br />
responded to the expressed needs of Australian women<br />
and established a set of strategies to provide them with<br />
greater opportunities in the future. It is the first<br />
time a Government has developed a detailed, practical<br />
and comprehensive long-term plan to improve the status<br />
of women.<br />
Australian women have come a long way since 1902, when<br />
we won the right to vote in Federal elections. We and<br />
our New Zealand sisters were at the forefront of the<br />
suffragette movement. We were the first women to receive<br />
the right to vote, and were to take the battle to other<br />
countries.<br />
Despite our early achievements, however, it has only<br />
been in the past 15 years that dramatic steps forward<br />
have been taken. Between 1969 and 1974, the concept of<br />
equal pay for work of equal value became enshrined into 004674<br />
pp.<br />
. Y t) </p>
<p>central wage-fixing. In 1973 unmarried mothers and<br />
deserted de facto wives were for the first time provided<br />
with some income support in the form of a Supporting<br />
Parents' Benefit. The Whitlam Government also introduced<br />
a system of Commonwealth subsidised child-care.<br />
In the past 15 years women's participation in the<br />
workforce has increased from 40% in 1972 t6 49% in 1987.<br />
of all Australian women aged 15 and over are now in<br />
some form of employment. The retention of girls to Year<br />
12 has escalated from 36% in 1972 to 50% in 1987. This<br />
has coincided with a growing awareness of the importance<br />
to girls of a full and balanced secondary education.<br />
Advances for women have been made in every field of<br />
employment and education. Many initiatives have been<br />
taken which provide a framework in which women can make<br />
free choices and achieve economic independence.<br />
Change has not come as quickly as many of u Ãµ would have<br />
liked, however, nor as rapidly as it should have. And<br />
while our status has improved substantially, it would be<br />
unwise to think no more efforts are needed. We cannot<br />
afford to be complacent.<br />
The National Agenda for Women is the prime mechanism for<br />
ensuring that the great surge forward in social and 004675 </p>
<p>economic reform for women maintains its momentum.<br />
My predecessor, Susan Ryan, played an important part in<br />
realising so many of these reforms. She was an active<br />
and founding member of the Women's Electoral Lobby,<br />
which took part in the struggle of the late 60s and<br />
early 70s to achieve recognition from society that women<br />
should be treated as equal across all spectrums of<br />
society. Both the Sex Discrimination and Affirmative<br />
Action Acts came about largely because of her energies<br />
in pushing social reforms through Parliament.<br />
Senator Ryan was a major force in developing the<br />
National Agenda for Women. She led the Australia-wide<br />
consultations in 1986 that involved more than 25,000<br />
women from all walks of life,-spending much of that year<br />
talking to women in the community about the importance<br />
of their contribution to the Government's proposed<br />
Agenda. The consultations ran for six months. A ndmber of women<br />
Members and Senators, including myself, took part<br />
and organised meetings and conferences. The National<br />
Women's Consultative Council also assisted in the<br />
consultations. Meetings, small and large, were held all<br />
around the country, in capital cities and in smaller<br />
towns. S :: 004676 004G76 </p>
<p>More than one hundred consultation reports and proposals<br />
were received. Some women made individual contributions.<br />
Two major conferences were held. One was organised by<br />
the Women's Electoral Lobby and attended by<br />
approximately 500 women from 159 organisations. The<br />
other was organised by the Federation of Ethnic<br />
Communities' Councils of Australia and brought together<br />
200 women from more than 30 ethnic backgrounds.<br />
A questionnaire was distributed to encourage maximum<br />
participation from women who may not havd been able to<br />
participate in conferences and meetings or to make<br />
submissions. The report of the consultations was tabled in Parliament<br />
last year by the Prime Minister. Titled Setting the<br />
Agenda, it remains a valuable picture of what Australian<br />
women see as their future priorities.<br />
Education, 6mployment, women at home, child care, income<br />
security, violence against women and children, dignity,<br />
and health emerged as the major issues of concern.<br />
There was also widespread recognition of the needs of<br />
groups of women who have characteristics which often<br />
mean they face additional disadvantages in relation to 004677 </p>
<p>Strait Islander women, women of non-English speaking<br />
backgrounds, women with a disability, sole parents,<br />
young women, older women and women living in regional<br />
Australia all have special needs and confront additional<br />
difficulties in accessing services or in participating<br />
to the full in Australian society.<br />
The Government has already acted to respond to the<br />
particular needs of certain groups of women. Our<br />
response to Women's Business, the report on Aboriginal<br />
women, will be completed in the next few weeks. We have<br />
appointed a consultant to prepare a response to the<br />
Survey of Rural Women in Australia that was launched by<br />
the Prime Minister a few weeks ago.<br />
Today the Prime Minister is launching our National<br />
Agenda for Women, the Government's response to the<br />
report of those consultations.<br />
The National Agenda for Women represents a key element<br />
4..<br />
in the Government's ongoing program to achieve equality<br />
for all Australians.<br />
Its significance cannot be overstated, but it is only<br />
the beginning.<br />
In my capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister 004678 </p>
<p>on the Status of Women, I will work with my ministerial<br />
colleagues to ensure that the policies and programs that<br />
make up the National Agenda will be introduced and that<br />
those already in place will continue to be developed.<br />
How will we know if the National Agenda is being<br />
effective? The Government has developed a series of<br />
indicative measures to monitor progress relating to this<br />
Agenda. They have been devised to:<br />
illustrate the changing position of women in key areas<br />
of concern;<br />
establish the impact of economic and social progress<br />
on women in a form th~ at is clear and easy to understand;<br />
identify clearly the policy issues which are being<br />
addressed and to highlight those in need of further<br />
attention; monitor the Government's progress to asbist in<br />
achieving the National Agenda commitments towards the<br />
year 2000; and<br />
heighten public awareness of women's ecbnomic status.<br />
Most of them will illustrate the position of women<br />
relative to men.<br />
Ongoing responsibility for implementation of the Agenda 004 6719 </p>
<p>will be through annual reports to Cabinet by the<br />
combined heads of Commonwealth Government Departments.<br />
Every Commonwealth department has a women's unit or an<br />
officer who is responsible for advising the Government<br />
on the impact of the policies and progratls of the<br />
portfolio on women. By this means the Agenda will be<br />
monitored within each Department.<br />
The Office of the Status of Women will pl. ay an important<br />
part in implementing the Agenda, and will provide advice<br />
to the Prime Minister and myself on the implementation<br />
and impact of Agenda policies.<br />
The Women's Budget Statement is published annually by<br />
the Office. It will, in the future, report on progress<br />
in implementing-the strategies included in the Agenda,<br />
and provide updated indicators of the status of<br />
Australian women.<br />
It is vital that consultation with women continues. The<br />
National Women's Consultative Council is the<br />
Government's major formal link with womeh in the<br />
community. The Council represents 15 major women's<br />
organisations, covering all States and Territories. Its<br />
convenor, Mrs Edith Hall, is here with us today. 004680 </p>
<p>Only through consultation can the future needs of women<br />
be absorbed into the Agenda. The National Agenda for<br />
Women is not fixed. It will respond to changing social<br />
needs. Many obstacles still remain, both institutional and<br />
attitudinal, which prevent women from exekcising real<br />
choice and from participating to the full in Australian<br />
society. The Government does not pretend to have a magic wand to<br />
resolve every need of Australian women. But it can help<br />
to create an environment which is more receptive to the<br />
needs of women, more willing to recognise and<br />
acknowledge their skills, and more able t6 accommodate<br />
their full and equal participation in society.<br />
The National Agenda provides programs and policies that<br />
will enable women to move ahead. Different groups of<br />
women have different needs the Government's<br />
consultations with both rural and Aboriginal women have<br />
indicated their particular concerns. And as women's<br />
lives change, their needs and priorities will change.<br />
This Agenda with its five-year action plans and detailed<br />
strategies is evidence that the Government is serious<br />
about sociar and economic reform. It is committed to 0046 81 </p>
<p>social justice and looks forward to ongoing<br />
communication with Australian women to achieve the<br />
reality of genuine equality for men and women. 004682 </p>
