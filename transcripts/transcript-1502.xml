FOR PRESS P. M. No. 25/ 1967<br />
REACTION TO TSMANIAN BUSHFIRES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The loss and suffering from the bushfires in Tasmania has<br />
produced a spontaneous sympathetic and helpful response in many parts<br />
of the world. Messages and gifts continued to arrive during the weekend.<br />
The gift of $ 50, 000 from the British Government was a<br />
warm-hearted and generous donation. In addition, there have been so<br />
many enquiries . from people in London wanting to make private donations<br />
that funds have been opened at both Australia House and Tasmania House.<br />
The New Zealand Government has already announced a gi-ft of $ 25, CCC for<br />
the Tasmanian Relief Fund.<br />
In addition to last vieekt messages from The Queen, Princess<br />
Alexandra, who is to visit Australia shortly, has expressed her sincere<br />
sympathy to all those Tasmanians who have experienced loss of any kind.<br />
Among other messages delivered this weekend was the<br />
following from President Johnson<br />
" I have been Saddened to hear of the tragic loss of<br />
life and property in Tasmania resulting from the disastrous<br />
bushfires raging there. I speak for all Americans when I<br />
express to you our profound sympathy for the people of Tasmania<br />
and all Australians who have suffered as a result of this misfortune.<br />
Countries to express their sympathy to the Tasmanian<br />
bushf ire vict ims include Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia, India,<br />
Israel, Portugal and Sweden.<br />
All Australians, and Tasmanians in particular, will be<br />
touched by the warmth of sympathy and ready expression of help.*<br />
While I shall be acknowledging these messages officially,<br />
I would like to say publicly how much the Australian Government appreciates<br />
these gestures. Officers of my Department have spent the weekend examining<br />
ways in which the Commonwealth can be of most help to Tasmania. Plans<br />
for Commonwealth assistance will be discussed at the Premiers' Conference<br />
in Canberra this week,<br />
CANBERRA, 12th February, 1967. </p>
