FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 14/ 1966<br />
REFERENDUM~<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, said today that<br />
Cabinet had further considered the course to be followed in<br />
relation to the holding of a referendum on the two proposals to<br />
amend the Constitution which were passed by both Houses of<br />
Parliament towards the end of last year.<br />
The major purpose of the first of these proposals<br />
was to remove the requirement in the Constitution that any<br />
increase in the number of Members of the House of Representatives<br />
would automatically produce an increase in the number of Senators<br />
to the extent of half the increase in the number of Members of<br />
the House of Representatives. The second proposal was to<br />
remove the provision which prevents aboriginal natives from<br />
being counted when the population is reckoned. Before these<br />
proposals could become law, they would have to be approved by<br />
a referendum of the people. The referendum was to be held on a<br />
date to be determined by the Government not less than two months,<br />
nor more than six months, after the Bills containing the proposals<br />
were passed by both Houses of Parliament that is, before the<br />
2nd June, 1966. Mr. Holt said Cabinet had decided to inform the<br />
Parliament-that the Government would recommend to the Governorin-<br />
Council that he does not issue a writ for the holding of a<br />
referendum this year in relation to either of these proposals.<br />
The decision of Cabinet will be conveyed to the Chief Electoral<br />
Officer of the Commonwealth, who in the absence of this notification,<br />
would proceed as required to the posting to some six<br />
million voters of the arguments for and against the proposals.<br />
In explanation of the Government's decision, Mr.<br />
Holt said this. " We have given a great deal of thought to the<br />
course to be followed in relation to these proposals. We remain<br />
strongly in support of both of them. But ours is a new Government<br />
which will, in the normal course of events, be conducting a<br />
general election later this year. We have taken office at a time<br />
when the Australian Government finds itself heavily occupied with<br />
a great many important and pressing matters arising both at home<br />
and abroad. We see ahead of us a crowded and unusually active<br />
political year. We feel that, in addition to performing an<br />
increasing volume of administrative tasks, we should, as a new<br />
e / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Government, make a thorough review of current policies. In the<br />
swiftly-moving world of today, some changes may well appear to us<br />
to have become desirable. We wish to be able to concentrate on<br />
all these matters without the interruption and distraction that an<br />
active referendum campaign of several weeks would create.<br />
" We believe an intensive referendum campaign of this<br />
dimension would be necessary if the Australian public is to be<br />
made fully aware of the need for the first proposal in relation to<br />
the Parliament, and to counter uninformed opinion and misleading<br />
propaganda already evident, which have adversely affected public<br />
support for this proposal.<br />
" There is no urgency about the proposal becoming law<br />
this year, because no action is intended arising from it in the<br />
course of the remainder of the life of this Parliament. On the<br />
other hand, we believe that the proposal will be better understood,<br />
and more widely supported, if it is presented after the general<br />
elections in the context of a programme of specified increase in<br />
the number of Members of the House of Representatives without there<br />
having to be an increase of Senators. This increase would be<br />
linked with redistribution proposals to be presented in the life<br />
of the same Parliament for the purpose of remedying the present<br />
unsatisfactory and inequitable distribution of population in<br />
existing electorates. Some metropolitan electorates, for example,<br />
currently include less than 40,000 voters: others are stretched<br />
well beyond the 100,000 mark.<br />
" The Government, when informing the Parliament on its<br />
resumption early in March, of its intention to defer the holding<br />
of the referendum proposals, will also indicate that it intends,<br />
early in the life of the next Parliament, to introduce the<br />
necessary legislation to enable a referendum to be held on the<br />
proposal to break the nexus, and it will, at the same time, give<br />
a general indication of its intentions in relation to redistribution<br />
proposals should the referendum prove successful.<br />
" The Government will further indicate that the proposal<br />
relating to aborigines would be presented at the same time as<br />
the " nexus" proposal. This proposal about aborigines has been<br />
supported by all political parties, and, indeed, no-one has come<br />
forward to present a " Negative" case in opposition to it. Any<br />
delay in passing the referendum in relation to the counting of<br />
9jborigines will have no adverse practical result because, in fact,<br />
the Commonwealth Statistician does count the aboriginal natives<br />
in the community and makes the figure public. The provision in the<br />
1 </p>
<p>Constitution does not amount to an impediment against this<br />
counting, nor does it prevent aborigines voting. Many of them<br />
do. We believe the provision should be taken out of the<br />
Constitutiin because it is outmoded and misleading, and gives<br />
cause for criticism both inside and outside Australia by<br />
people unaware of the actual situation.<br />
" IRather than incur the additional expense of<br />
holding two separate referenda to cover the proposals, the<br />
Government intends to hold them together as soon as practicable<br />
in the life of the incoming Parliament after the next election.<br />
" Throughout its discussions, the Cabinet has been<br />
sensitive to the fact that the Parliament has supported in<br />
both Houses the referendum legislation which the Menzies<br />
Government presented to it. We believe, however, that the<br />
Parliament will recognise the reasons which have influenced<br />
us, and will approve our decision to defer the proposals for<br />
the time being. Wie are convinced that what we are now putting<br />
forward is not only the sensible course in current circumstances,<br />
but will strengthen, rather than weaken, the prospect of success<br />
for both proposals."<br />
CANBERRA, February, 1966. </p>
