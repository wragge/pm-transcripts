J&gt; AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS JANUARY 30. 1976<br />
NATIONAL WAGE CASE<br />
At its meeting this morning Cabinet considered the gravity of tiie possible<br />
consequences for the economy flowing from the 5.6 per cent increase in the<br />
Consumer Price Index for the December quarter, announced earlier this week.<br />
In particular, Ministers expressed their grave concern about the possible<br />
implications of this increase, inherited from the previous Government, for<br />
proceedings in the National Wage Case, due to open before the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commissinn next Tuesday, 3 February.<br />
This confronts the Government with a very difficult decision.<br />
The Government has expressed its support, under current economic circumsta:' ces,<br />
for the wage indexation principles laid down by the Commission last year.<br />
The first of the Wage Indexation Principles enumerated by the Commission<br />
last year states:<br />
" The Commission will adjust its award wages and salaries each<br />
quarter in relation to the most recent movement of the six<br />
capitals CPI unless it is persuaded to the contrary by those seeking<br />
to oppose the adjustment." ( Emphasis added)<br />
Because of the difficult economic circumstances, particularly inflation . Lnd<br />
unemployment, the Government finds it necessary to argue that instead of<br />
granting the increase of 6.4 per cent which would result from fully passing<br />
on the CPI increase for the last two quarters, the Commission should at this<br />
time determine upon a figure of about half that order..<br />
An increase of that magnitude in money wages at this time would have quite<br />
calamitous consequences for the economy. It would be in the interests of nobody.<br />
The ultimate goal for Government, employers and employees must be renewed<br />
econom~ ic growth, more jobs and fewer people out of work.<br />
The econcr~ y is in, a very serious condition. A sharp rise in wage costs such<br />
as would be involved in fully carrying through the latest CPI increase into<br />
wage rates would produce a sharp shock to business confidence, wvould<br />
reinforce expectations of continuing high inflation, and would retard the<br />
process of reducing unemployment. / 2 </p>
<p>There is a very clear and close nexus between inflation and unemployment.<br />
Until inflation and inflationary expectations are reduced, there can be<br />
no prospect of lasting economic recovery; that in turn means that there can<br />
be no prospect of improving real wages and providing jobs for all Australians.<br />
Under the most favourable circumstances, it would not be possible to halt<br />
inflation overnight on the contrary, the struggle , to rein it back will<br />
at best be a long one and a hard one.<br />
What I now say is that if a very large wage increase is now to be injected<br />
into the situation, the task of the Government and the Australian community<br />
as a whole will be made infinitely harder.<br />
We have concluded that in present circumstances the Commonwealth Government<br />
would be breaking faith with the Australian people's wish to control<br />
inflation if it were not to argue against a full adjustment of wages and<br />
salaries according to the movements in the CPI for the last two quarters.<br />
It is for the Commission to rule upon the applications it will have before<br />
it next week.<br />
It will of course be open-to other participants in the Commission hearings to<br />
argue their own views in accordance with the principles laid down by the<br />
Commission. For our part, we believe that any such argumentation must have<br />
regard first and foremost to the effects of the final outcome upon the<br />
outlook for economic recovery and the availability of jobs for all Australians." </p>
