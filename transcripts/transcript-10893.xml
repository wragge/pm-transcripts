<p>Good Evening.</p>
<p>Tonight I want to talk to you about a plan that will help all Australians.</p>
<p>The economic troubles in Asia have brought home to all of us just</p>
<p> how important it is to have a strong and competitive Australian economy.</p>
<p>The Government has already got rid of the budget deficit we inherited,</p>
<p> delivered the lowest interest rates in 30 years and created 300,000</p>
<p> new jobs.</p>
<p>The next step is to fix the tax system, which has been holding us</p>
<p> back.</p>
<p>It's unfair, discourages hard work and penalises our exporters</p>
<p> at the very time when Australia must sell more abroad to do well.</p>
<p> We need a clean break with the past and the tax plan announced today</p>
<p> will create a new fairer tax system for the 21st century.</p>
<p>To start with, we will cut personal income tax by over $13 billion</p>
<p> a year. The tax free threshold will rise to $6,000 and all except</p>
<p> the top tax rate will come down.</p>
<p>Over 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay a top rate of only 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar or less and this means a person's income could</p>
<p> rise from $20,000 to $50,000 a year without that person going into</p>
<p> a higher tax bracket, and that's a huge incentive.</p>
<p>There are extra benefits for families.</p>
<p>Under our plan typical Australian families with either one or both</p>
<p> parents in the workforce will be $40 to $50 a week better off even</p>
<p> after GST.</p>
<p>A single income family with one child under five will have the first</p>
<p> $13,000 of income completely tax free. Benefits for childcare will</p>
<p> be improved and there will be no GST on childcare.</p>
<p>I have always believed passionately that Australians should be encouraged</p>
<p> to take out private health insurance. It provides doctor of choice,</p>
<p> and takes pressure off the public hospitals.</p>
<p>Tonight I announce that from January next year there will be a 30</p>
<p> per cent tax rebate or benefit for private health insurance. For more</p>
<p> than 80 per cent of taxpayers this will be at least equal to or better</p>
<p> than full tax deductibility. It will be worth around $600 a year for</p>
<p> a health policy costing $2,000.</p>
<p>This incentive will be available to everyone.</p>
<p>We will replace ten hidden, indirect taxes with one ten per cent goods</p>
<p> and services tax.</p>
<p>The GST will not be an extra tax on top of existing taxes. The wholesale</p>
<p> sales tax will be swept away and with it nine state and territory</p>
<p> taxes such as those on bank accounts, stamp duties on mortgages, and</p>
<p> bed taxes.</p>
<p>Health, education, childcare, hospitals, nursing homes and hostels,</p>
<p> local government rates, water and sewerage rates and charitable activities</p>
<p> will all be free of the GST.</p>
<p>The GST rate will be locked in at 10 per cent because the law will</p>
<p> be changed to stop the rate being increased by anyone without the</p>
<p> full agreement of all State and Territory Governments, as well as</p>
<p> the Federal Government and both Houses of the Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>Many goods will fall in price. A family car, for example, will now</p>
<p> be taxed at</p>
<p> 10 per cent, not the old wholesale rate of 22 per cent. But a luxury</p>
<p> car tax will stay.</p>
<p>All up, the increase in the cost of living has been estimated at just</p>
<p> under two per cent. And there will be new special powers to stop unscrupulous</p>
<p> people exploiting the changes.</p>
<p>The new tax system will start on July the 1st of July,</p>
<p> 2000. And we will catch more of the cash economy Â at least $3</p>
<p> billion over 3 years. And remember that without the GST that would</p>
<p> not be possible.</p>
<p> Pensioners and low income earners will be more than fully protected.</p>
<p>Pensions and allowances will rise by four per cent when the new plan</p>
<p> starts so that they are well ahead of any increase in the cost of</p>
<p> living.</p>
<p>The age pension will rise by up to $15.50 a fortnight for singles</p>
<p> and $25.50 a fortnight for couples.</p>
<p>On top of that single pensioners and self-funded retirees will receive</p>
<p> an extra tax rebate of $250 a year while for couples the extra rebate</p>
<p> will be $350.</p>
<p>Also people over 60 with investment income will receive a one off</p>
<p> income tested savings bonus of up to $1,000. For self funded retirees</p>
<p> of pensionable age, the savings bonus will be up to $3,000. There</p>
<p> will be an extra benefit for retired people with shares. And provisional</p>
<p> tax will be totally abolished.</p>
<p>The typical part pensioner couple with $10,000 of investment income</p>
<p> will be $23 a week better off, after the GST, and better off still,</p>
<p> if they have private health insurance.</p>
<p>The bush will get a major boost.</p>
<p>Fuel excise will be reduced by about $3.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>There will be a diesel fuel credit reducing the cost of diesel fuel</p>
<p> used in heavy road and rail transport by 25 cents a litre. The excise</p>
<p> on diesel fuel used off road by farmers and other business will be</p>
<p> fully rebated. Hospitals and others, such as ferry and marine operators,</p>
<p> will benefit.</p>
<p>For all businesses the cost of petrol will fall by about seven cents</p>
<p> a litre. The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary</p>
<p> motorist.</p>
<p>Small business will gain significantly.</p>
<p>$10 billion of taxes on business will be removed. Costs for exporters</p>
<p> will fall by</p>
<p> $4.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>The new plan will improve cashflow for most businesses and there will</p>
<p> be a special fund of $500 million to reduce any start up costs.</p>
<p>Ours is a unique country, with immense resources, a diverse, well-educated</p>
<p> people and almost limitless possibilities.</p>
<p>It deserves a better and fairer tax system for the next century. Our</p>
<p> plan will help give the nation that future.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
