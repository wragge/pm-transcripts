DARWIN RELIEF: NAURU CHEQUE FOR DARWIN RELIEF<br />
President Hammer de Roburt of Nauru has presented a<br />
cheque for $ A100p, 000( to the Australian Government for Darwin<br />
relief purposes. President de Roburt made the presentation yesterday to<br />
Australia's representative in Nauru, following a ministerial<br />
statement to Parliament.<br />
The President's statement said: " The House will be<br />
aware of the shocking disaster caused by a cyclone which struck<br />
the city of Darwin early on Christmas Day.<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of the<br />
Republic I have sent a message of sympathy to the Governor<br />
General. Since then more revelations of the magnitude of the<br />
disaster have been coming in and it is now clear that seldom,<br />
if ever, has Australia been stricken by a catastrophe of such<br />
intensity. Many people have lost their lives many others are<br />
missing and thousands are homeless and have had to be evacuated<br />
from the city.<br />
The consequences in termins of material damage and broken<br />
lives are incalculable and the Cabinet hasodecided that the<br />
Republic should offer material assistance in addition to our<br />
heartfelt sympathy."<br />
Nauru has also offered the use of its Government aircraft<br />
for evacuation purposes.<br />
