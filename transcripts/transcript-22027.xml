    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will allocate $320 million under AusLink, over the next three-and-a-half years, to upgrade the section of the Ipswich Motorway east of Goodna to six lanes.</p>
<p>The widening to six lanes of the Wacol to Darra section of the motorway will include the construction of new interchanges at Progress Road and the Centenary Highway.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to planning for a Northern Option corridor, the Goodna bypass, between Dinmore and Gailes.  Three options are considered potentially feasible by engineering consultants Maunsells Australia Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is therefore allocating an additional $10 million to undertake studies to further explore these three options for the Goodna bypass.  These studies will include route selection, geo-technical investigations and environmental assessments.  Details of the route options are attached.</p>
<p>Today's announcement boosts funds allocated to the Ipswich motorway corridor to $556 million.  It builds on the Australian Government's earlier commitment of $160 million for a new interchange at the Ipswich and Logan Motorway junction and $66 million in funding for a range of interim safety works and planning along the Ipswich Motorway corridor.</p>
<p>Through this investment, the Australian Government is making a significant contribution to addressing congestion, safety and noise on one of south-east Queensland's busiest corridors.</p>
<p>Overall, the Australian Government is investing $627 million on the Ipswich Motorway and key urban Brisbane corridors through the AusLink programme.</p>
<p>Transport infrastructure investment of this magnitude is made possible because of the Australian Government's strong economic management.  This has enabled a $12.7 billion AusLink contribution to better roads and railways in Australia during the five years to 2009.</p>
