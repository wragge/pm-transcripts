<p>I look forward to working with the new Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles.</p>
<p>I will seek to work with Mr Giles and his new team in the interests of all Territorians.</p>
<p>The news that Australia has our first ever indigenous head of Government is also to be welcomed.</p>
<p>I wish Terry Mills well in the future.</p>
