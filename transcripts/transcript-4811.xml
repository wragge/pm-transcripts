    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 11 SEPTEMBER, 1978<br />
The Prime Minister sent the following message today<br />
to the Premier of N. S. W.:<br />
" My Dear Premier:<br />
Thank you for your Telex of 1 September 1978 proposing the<br />
establishment of a National Inquiry into the consequences<br />
of new technology upon industries and employment.<br />
I am informed that on the same day, Mr. Hills also wrote<br />
to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations<br />
proposing that the industrial relations aspects of<br />
automation and technological change should be considered<br />
by the Labour Ministers at their meeting last Friday.<br />
My Government recognises that there can be significant<br />
economic and social consequences from the introduction of<br />
new technology. Equally, there can be important consequences<br />
if it is not introduced. Our concern to ensure these<br />
matters were given appropriate recognition and consideration*. in<br />
the formulation and implementation of Commonwealth Government<br />
policy is evidenced by the creation of a Department of<br />
Productivity in November, 1976.<br />
As you know, the Government has also established an<br />
inter-departnental committee to consider and report back to it,<br />
as a matter of urgency, on the impact and implications of<br />
new technology in industry. Mr. Street would have been<br />
referring to this at the Ministers of Labour Meeting but,<br />
in the light of Mr. Hills request, the matter was formally<br />
included on the agenda.<br />
My Government would wish to await the report of the<br />
Committee as set up before making any decision concerning<br />
any broad based national inquiry into the consequences<br />
of new technology upon industries and employment. However,<br />
I need hardly add that it will take particular note of<br />
views which may be expressed by the States."<br />
