OPUnD( OF NEW THEUR BLOCK<br />
R. C. R. CONBRD 7 NM 1990<br />
Ladies and gentlomen<br />
The planning for this now theatre block at the Concord<br />
Repatriation Hospital began in 1983 an important year of<br />
cous for my Government as well as for the Concord<br />
Repatriation Hospital. I am very pleased to be here as<br />
Prime Minister to mark the successful culmination of the<br />
project. I firmly believe that the Auatralian community would want<br />
any Australian Government to recognise in practical ways<br />
like this the debt which Australia owes to its veterans.<br />
X may this despite the fact that today, 18 years after the<br />
withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam, 50 years since<br />
our troops were engaged in World War II, and 73 years since<br />
the landing at Anzac Cove, there are some in the ex-service<br />
cmunity who express concerns about whether the<br />
repatriation system is in jeopardy.<br />
Some wonder whether cars and compassion for veterans is<br />
waning with the passage of time, an more and more young<br />
Australians, not having first or even second-hand experience<br />
of war, take on responsibility for veterans' care.<br />
I went to address those concerns today and in so doing place<br />
on record my Government's position on the future care of<br />
veterans. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I an talking to you, of course, in the midst of an election<br />
campaign. But I do not intend to talk politics today. I<br />
would like to think that the question of our debt so a<br />
country to our veterans is beyond Party politico. What I<br />
wish to do, therefore, in to speak only in a positive waY<br />
about our commitments as a Government, oommitments to the<br />
veteran which I believe would reflect the wish of all<br />
Australians. 1; h </p>
<p>Australia in a secure country for today's generation in<br />
large part because of the sacrifice made in the past by our<br />
veterans.* Of course we must never slacken in our efforts to<br />
remind young Australians of the achievements of our service<br />
and ma-service men and woman. And we must always keep alive<br />
the fundamental values for which they were prepared to die.<br />
But I strongly believe that these ae messages which will be<br />
quickly anid readily recognised and understood by young<br />
people. If attendance by young people at Anizac Day ceremonis<br />
throughout Australia, and visits to Australian war graves<br />
overseas are any measure, there seem if anything to be a<br />
rasurgence of intezvot. And the number of people visiting<br />
the Australian War Memorial each year, many of them of a<br />
generation not exposed to war, is not dwindling.<br />
It is in large pert for Its educational potential that I<br />
agreed without hesitation to send a group of Gallipoli<br />
veterans, accompanied by a small party of war widows and,<br />
importantly, Junior Legatees, bark to Turkey for this year' u<br />
Anniversary of the landing at Anzxac Cove.<br />
As well as honoring that fine group of Australian vaterans<br />
and I'm delighted to may that we have emus of them, along<br />
with their tour leader, 3i11 Hall, with us hare today the<br />
visit to the Gallipoli Peninsula will enable the Junior<br />
Legatee group to pass on first hand observations to their<br />
contporaries. I do believe that projecta such an the Gallipoli pilgrimae<br />
and other Initiatives enjoy widespread comunity support.<br />
Australians, I = m sure, also support our decision to index:<br />
all major pensions and allowances for veterans so that their<br />
real value is not eroded. The same is true of the<br />
Increases, over anid above indexation, to bring the rate of<br />
service pension to 25 per cant of average weekly earnings.<br />
The overall real increase in funding for veterans of p" r<br />
cant each year of this decade represents a comitment made<br />
by the Governmeant on behal f of the community as a whole.<br />
Ladies w4i gentlemen,<br />
In Veterans Affairs, as in all other areas of Government<br />
activity, there in a place for continuity ar" there is a<br />
place for change.<br />
I cnow that continuity in the administration of Veterans'<br />
programs in an issue about which the Veteran-' commity<br />
feels strongly. I wish to repeat, therefore, what I said<br />
last year when opening a new ward block at Heidelberg<br />
Hospital1 my Government is absolutely committed to<br />
maintaining a separate Department of Veterans' Affairs,<br />
answerable to its own Minister. () 4 </p>
<p>Further, on behalf of the Government, I guarantee the<br />
retention of a full time Repatriation Commission with at Lo<br />
least three Commisioners ame of whom is nominated by the<br />
OR-service Commnity and the retention of a Veterans' 0)<br />
Review Board which incl. udes service members. * Ie u)<br />
As to change, we must assa Government recognise that the<br />
issues confronting veterans are not static. The needs of 1<br />
veterans now are not those that applied at wars' end. We r<br />
will therefore continue to look to the Repatriation n<br />
Commission to provide advice on the most effective means of t)<br />
responding to the changing needs of our veterans an they<br />
grow old and to ensure that necessary changes e canivassed<br />
with, and clearly explained to, those affected. I<br />
We mest look ahead, and aly Minister for Veteranis' Affairs,<br />
Ben Humphreys, has been doing just that. T at<br />
Already in the pipeline for consideration in the<br />
Government'sa next term Is a number of reports which Ben has I<br />
oumnimsioned These include a maj or review of the Veterans' t.<br />
Affairs Health Program, an evaluation of the accessibility<br />
of services to aged veterans and war wds, an inquiry into<br />
merchant mariners and allied veterans and a review of the<br />
free limbs scheme administered by the Department.<br />
Each of these review. covers a vital area of interest to the a<br />
veterans community.<br />
However, at the top of our agenda for our Fourth term will p<br />
be a determination to build on the prograss my Government t<br />
has Initiated which are designed to ensure that aged<br />
veterans end war widows are able to live with dignity in I<br />
their own h me for as long as possible. L<br />
Programs such ts " Outreach", the pilot OVtarann'<br />
Independence Support Initiative", health promotionI<br />
activities dealing with eafety, nutrition and fitness, end<br />
the very popular Joint Ventures scheme are concrete<br />
reflections of this philosophy.<br />
In this context there in within the veterans' community one IC<br />
group which carries a burden, uncomplainingly, and with 3<br />
little recognition. I speak of the wives of our veterans<br />
who receive the Extreme Disablement Adjustment introduced by<br />
my Government last year. In many cases, these women<br />
constitute the difference between a veteran living at home<br />
or requiring hostel, nursing home or hospital care.<br />
Theirs is a personal sacrifice. willingly made, and It in I<br />
also a community service. In order to recognis that<br />
sacrif ice, I wish to announce today that the Government will r<br />
henceforth automatically provide these wives with the War<br />
Widows pension on the death of the veteran. They will not<br />
have to prove an entitlement; it will be theirs re a right. t<br />
This will bring EDA widows Into line with our TPI widows.<br />
It will ensure consistency between the two groups. </p>
<p>La-dies and gentlemen,<br />
Obviously there is little point in pursuing the goal Of<br />
keeping veterans in their own homes if that home is<br />
unsuitable. I am proud of our innovation as a Government in<br />
providing new facilities to veterans through the December<br />
1987 Change. to the Defence Gervice Home Loans Scheme.* These<br />
reforms Introduced a number of flew4bilities Mn benefits<br />
not available to veteran. who received subsidised loans from<br />
the Government prior to December 1987.<br />
We can n~ ov carry the innovation further, and I am pleased to<br />
Inform you that my next Government will move to provide<br />
loans portability to the large number of veteans, war<br />
widows end serving membera who held loans in December 1987.<br />
That means that a veteran salling his home and buying<br />
another will nov not lose the subsidised loan.<br />
In addition we will extend this scheme to enable OSH loans<br />
to be used for entry into Retirement villages. We recognise<br />
that, with our veterans Increasingly in need of the kind of<br />
care and lifestyle that retirement counities an offer,<br />
this in an important new Area of demand. Veterans<br />
considering the Retirement Village option will therefore<br />
have a greater range of choice than ha. previously been<br />
availeble. I am aware that theme initiatives have been Zatters of high<br />
priority within the major ex-service organimations. I wish<br />
to give credit to those organinatione for the work which<br />
they do for veterans, not least of it in co-operatively<br />
helping Government identify and target areas of need.<br />
L-adies and gentlemen,<br />
It in appropriate at Concord Hospital today that I address<br />
some concerns which I know exsist about the integration of<br />
Repatriation Hospitals into the State Hospital system.<br />
And at this point I pay tribute to Mary Hason, our<br />
candidate In Lowe, who has been working hard to present<br />
local views on this matter.<br />
MY Government is comitted to ensuring that the veteran has<br />
access to care at the highest level in the local community.<br />
We believe, in line with professional medical opinion, that<br />
treatment in the local ciuity is what most elderly<br />
patients se, and what offers the beat results.<br />
That is the major reason behind our decision to integrate<br />
Raptriation Hospitals into the state systems. Integration<br />
will ensure that veterans continue to have eccese to the<br />
best medical staff and equipmtent, at the same time providing<br />
them with a greater choice, Inriluding placement in hospitals<br />
closer to their homes. 1; () 43 </p>
<p>We are offering an enhantced schem which recognIos that<br />
most veterans do not now, " n will not in the near future,<br />
vant to travel considerable distances, away from. their<br />
families and friends, to a ceztralised hospital. To<br />
facilitate high quality, responsive local treatment we have<br />
therefore proposed for discussion, a system which amounts to<br />
a private health care scheme for veterans.<br />
And let me say that I believe that anybody who ozamine. the<br />
integration question seriously will acknowledge that<br />
integration in inevitable and ia crucial f or the viability<br />
of thin and other Repatriation General Hospitals.<br />
For ezample, Concord nov only treats 30 percent of Now South<br />
Wales veterans and has 35 percent -unity patients. The<br />
hospital is under increasing pressure from many veterans to<br />
ease the requirement to be treated here.<br />
But this in not a develomnt which should or need be<br />
rushed. Just when integration occurs will depend on the<br />
patioular local circumstances facing veterans and the<br />
hospital, and will be settled by discussion. We are<br />
committed to full consultation at every atep. I well<br />
understand how important this is to the veterans community<br />
and to hospital staff.<br />
Both Ben Humphreys and, I have guaranteed on a number of<br />
occasions that<br />
no Repatriation General Hospital will be transferred to<br />
a State until a eatisfeortory agreement has been reached<br />
on matters such as priority of access and quality of<br />
health care for veterans and war widows, and unless the<br />
interests of hospital staff have been adequately<br />
safeguardedy en<br />
no final decision will be taken if the RBL has<br />
reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed<br />
arrangements.<br />
Ats I said at Heidelberg last Apil there is nothing<br />
equivocal about these guarantees and no secret agenda<br />
underlies the initiatives. I stand firmly behind the<br />
guarantees. And let me add that our commitment to no diminishment in<br />
quality of care is important not only to patients and their<br />
families but also to those who work within the system and<br />
who are naturally interested in job security. The need<br />
throughout the health system is for more hospitals and not<br />
fewer, and integration is capable of opening doors to better<br />
career prospects for staff.<br />

<p>Ladies anid gentle n<br />
I referred earlier to the Australian war Memorial an a vital<br />
mnama of keeping our young people aware of the sacrif ice of<br />
veterans end awae too of the horrendous cost of wars and<br />
the continuing need for strong deence.<br />
eWorm Closing today I wish to announce that we will, over<br />
the nMat two years in Government, provide the Memorial with<br />
funids for the first stage of a new technology pavilion which<br />
will enable some of its larger pieces currently in storage<br />
to be put on display. We will invest $ 5 million to cover<br />
the cost of this first stag.<br />
Ben Huzphraya has also re-allocated resources to provide a<br />
subtantial increase to the Memorial staff. Together, these<br />
two initiatives will ensure that the War Memorial retains<br />
its status as a national symbol of the sacrif ices made by<br />
veterans for this nation' s freedom and for its future.<br />
Ladies arid gentle n<br />
The various propos als which I have announced today are<br />
estimated to cost 018.6 million over the next three years.<br />
This is not Merely a wishful intention; it is a fully<br />
funded commitent. And of curse it is additional to the<br />
ongoing proograms end projecats which we are undertaking.<br />
The $ 31 million proj ect which I have the honour of openina<br />
today Is but the latest projeoct in an Australia-wide program<br />
which has, since 1983, seen more than 0100 million upent on<br />
new or refurbished buildings and new medical equipment at<br />
Repatriation Hospitals.<br />
It stands as tangible proof of the way in which the<br />
Government, with community support, continues to hanour the<br />
debt owed to those who fought for this great country. It Is<br />
the rebuttal in bricks and mortar of any suggestion that we<br />
would ever run down facilities for veterans, We shall never<br />
do so.<br />
Ladies and gentlea<br />
I have much pleasure in declaring these new facilities open. </p>
