    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd: Thank you to everyone who took the time to participate in my blog on climate change. </p>
<p>I am delighted with the response and enjoyed watching the debate unfold.</p>
<p>The responses have included some valuable and useful ideas, ranging from food production concepts, water management, renewable energy, education requirements, jobs, skilling, economic impacts and incentives.</p>
<p>While some on this blog have raised their doubts about the science of climate change, that is not the view of this Government  -  we accept the science.</p>
<p>Addressing the impacts of climate change requires action globally, nationally and locally.</p>
<p>I was struck by a number of suggestions on the importance of education and information. </p>
<p>In particular, the posting from âMal07' on 22 July:</p>
<p>âWe need increased awareness on the part of individual Australians, we need commitment from them to take personal action, we need behaviour change and a respect for the energy we consume and a reduction in energy waste and needless emissions...</p>
<p>Education must be the answer....</p>
<p>[we need] People teaching Australian's how to reduce energy consumption and emissions in simple everyday ways. People who can visit homes and assess and advise families how to maintain their standard of living whilst reducing their impact...â</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
<p>Households are often overwhelmed by the amount of information available describing the best actions to save energy and water and to reduce their carbon footprints. It can be difficult to decide what action to take.</p>
<p>That is why the Government, through the Green Loans Program, is providing householders with access to free, comprehensive Home Sustainability Assessments to reduce their energy and water bills, increase the comfort of their home and help reduce carbon pollution.</p>
<p>These independent assessments will be conducted by a qualified expert assessor and provide advice from the smallest behaviour change to major investments such as a solar hot water system or solar panels. </p>
<p>The Government is also developing a web portal which we will launch soon. </p>
<p>This website will be the entry point for Australians to find out what they can do to reduce their individual impact on the environment and help them find out what Government programs are available to assist them  -  such as the free Home Sustainability Assessments.</p>
<p>I hope this website will provide Australians with the information and tools necessary to take action.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all of you who took the time to share your views on this incredibly important issue.</p>
