OPENING OF<br />
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John Gorton, MP AUGUST 1968<br />
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
You, Sir Grenfell, have told us something of the<br />
history of libraries, and in particular of the history of this building in<br />
which we today find ourselves. While you were telling us about it, I muld<br />
not but thinik how fortunate you were to have been driven out by the ferrets<br />
of the Treasury from the burrow in which you once found yourself, if the<br />
end result of that was that you find yourself in this if I may so describe it<br />
warren. I know that at one stage, you described or Sir Robert<br />
Menzies described the storage places in which the books of the National<br />
Library were placed as " elegant igloos", those being those Nissen huts<br />
scattered around the place. No-one, Sir, would have the temerity to<br />
describe this as an " elegant igloo". Rather, I think, the proper name for<br />
it might be Xanadu, because you will remember it was in Xanadu that<br />
Kubla Khan " a stately pleasure dome decreed", and this perhaps might be<br />
a fair description of what ought to be a stately building, a national library.<br />
Many hearts and hands and minds have worked<br />
effectively and devotedly over the years to bring to completion this building<br />
in which we now find ourselves Only on the rarest occasions does<br />
some accomplishment such as this result from anything other than the<br />
devotion of many people, and the contributions of many thoughts and of<br />
many minds. I think that as the years go by, and the decades go by<br />
in our nation, and as they go by give more growth, give more colour,<br />
give more depth to our national story, this building having already gained<br />
the recognition that it has, will be counted in the world as one of the world's<br />
great libraries. You have given thanks, Sir, to those who have worked<br />
so effectively to bring to fruition this projact, but what you have not done<br />
and what I propose to do is to say hc~ w much credit is due to you and to your<br />
enthusiastic work as Chairman of the Council of the National Library of<br />
Australia. I have some knowledge of this, having worked with you in other<br />
directions, and know how much devotion you have given to this task, even if,<br />
if I may say so, the standard of poetry of which you gave us an example<br />
has not got quite the finish of the building in which it is stored. 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The early libraries of the world, Mvr Chairman, as I understand,<br />
tended to be temples in which holy books were kept and where the priests<br />
were the guardians of the books, and no doubt, like most librarians, refused<br />
to allow the books to leave, on the very good grounds that if they did leaye,<br />
it was unlikely they would be brought back.<br />
VWe here have passed on from that, but there still is in the concept<br />
of a library, something of that original -assessment in that in a building there<br />
ftestored books which are not merely dogma, but books which in the sense<br />
in which they encompass the thoughts and wisdoms of the past could be<br />
regarded as having some great significance, if not some holy significance,<br />
in the present. I have spoken of you, M r Chairman, and those who have worked<br />
with you in bringing this to completion, but I also want to speak a little of<br />
those who make it operate, of those who will see that it will work for the<br />
end for which it is designed. This is where we rely on the staff of libraries<br />
not the directors of libraries but the staff of libraries who catalogue the<br />
books, who index the subject matter, who supply a research service and<br />
give easy access to any area of study which is required by somebody who<br />
comes to a library. It is these people, working quietly and devotedly in<br />
their chosen tasks who alone make a building such as this, and the books<br />
in a building such as this, fulfil a proper, effective and efficient task.<br />
Without them, there would be so many books here that not only c ould the<br />
mind of a would-be scholar not encompass them, but the hanids of a<br />
would-be scholar could not find them. This is the task of those who run<br />
this library I think, Sir, that in its practical application, the Library here<br />
serves and will serve the nation through a central government, the<br />
Australian Government, the most important government, working in<br />
conjunction with State Libraries of State Governments throughout the length<br />
and breadth of this nation.<br />
It will serve our Territories. It will serve our Missions abroad,<br />
and it will provide one main strand in the network of library services which<br />
covers the whole of the world.<br />
I think the nations of the world will draw closer and have drawn<br />
closer as communications have improved. No longer is it enough, as it<br />
once was, to live in a closed community of ideas. It is necessary that<br />
there should be an exchange of ideas to the greatest possible extent among<br />
the greatest possible number of people, and libraries such as this in various<br />
countries are the best means by which this can take place.<br />
just over one hundred years ago, another man opening another<br />
library said great library contains the diary of the human race"<br />
This library, as part of a world-wide library service, will keep that diary<br />
up to date for us to study the world's Todays, as well as its iyesterdays,<br />
and by being able to study its Todays and its Yesterdays, perhaps enable us<br />
to be the more wise in seeking to shape the world's Tomorrows. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The insistent pressures of growth and the enlarging executive<br />
functions of the national library made its separation from the Parliamentary<br />
Library sensible and necessary and part of the orderly progression of<br />
events. Here today, we mark that final act of separation.<br />
But it hasn't created two separate worlds of scholarship, this<br />
separation. There will still be the closest and most intimate relationship<br />
between the two libraries, and that will in each case give strength to the other.<br />
We are keeping before us, as sixty years ago the joint Library<br />
Committee established by Sir Edmund Barton kept before it as an idea] l that<br />
such a library as this shall be worthy of the Australian nation, shall be the<br />
home of literature, a part of the world and a part of all time.<br />
Eight years ago, Sir Robert Menzies, the seventeenth Prime<br />
Minister, presented the National Library Bill which supported the Paton<br />
Committee' s recommendation for this library. Less than six years later,<br />
Sir Robert laid the foundation stone of this library, this relatively inexpensive<br />
library, I think you said, Sir, costing no more than $ 8 million without books.'<br />
Now, on the 15th August, 1968, there is given to me, the nineteenth<br />
Prime Minister, the great and enduring honour of being asked to open that<br />
Library for which so many other people have woriked for so long, and<br />
which those of you who have eyes to see will agree with mie, is what I have<br />
sought to describe it as today.<br />
With just one more quotation, Sir, I propose soon to declare this<br />
Library open, but I did want to say something about books, or ratLr to say<br />
what some other great man had said about books or rather, some gre-at<br />
man had said about books. That is Joseph Conrad, whom I quote:<br />
" Of all inanimate objects, of all man' s creations, books are the<br />
nearest to us, for they contain our vey thoughts, our ambitions, our<br />
indignations, our illusions, our fidelity to truth, and our persistent<br />
leaning toward error, But most of all they resemble us in their<br />
precarious hold on life".<br />
This building, and those who attend these books will see that the hold on life<br />
is not precarious and that the influence on life is that which those who read<br />
these books choose that it shall be. That is one of the great achievements of<br />
today and one reasou wblI have such pleasure in declaring this National<br />
Library open. </p>
