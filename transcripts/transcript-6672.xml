EMBARGOED UNTIL 2 P. M.<br />
JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
THE PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
21 JULY 1985<br />
The Commonwealth Government has made a special grant of<br />
million to the South Australian Government to assist in<br />
staging the first Australian Formula One Grand Prix in<br />
Adelaide in November.<br />
The Commonwealth contribution will underpin an extensive<br />
capital works project which the South Australian Government<br />
has undertaken to ensure the Grand Prix is a success. It<br />
will be the first of seven annual World Championship Formula<br />
one events which the South Australian Government has.:<br />
contracted to stage between 1985 and 1991.<br />
Mr Hawke said the series would bring unprecedented<br />
international exposure for Australia and would provide<br />
significant economic benefits, particularly for South<br />
Australia. The Grand Prix will stimulate the promotion and<br />
development of tourism in Australia and will provide<br />
specific benefits to the community in the form of employment<br />
and business opportunities.<br />
Mr Hawke said the staging of the Grand Prix in Adelaide<br />
would enable Australia to build on an already proud and<br />
successful record in hosting major international sporting<br />
events. It was a tribute to the efforts of the Bannon Government<br />
that Australia had, for the first time, won the privilege of<br />
being included in this unique and prestigious world<br />
championship series.<br />
Mr Bannon-said the Grand Prix would attract an estimated<br />
100,000 people to Adelaide and South Australia, many of them<br />
from overseas. Television coverage of Formula One racing<br />
attracted audiences of up to 700 million people in some<br />
countries. </p>
<p>He said the Federal Government had recognised the<br />
contribution which South Australia was making to the<br />
national tourism effort by staging the Grand Prix.<br />
The Australian Formula One Grand Prix is to be raced through<br />
the streets of Adelaide from October 31 November 3. The<br />
Adelaide circuit is 3.78 kilometres with a main straight of<br />
one kilometre where cars are expected to reach around<br />
330 km/ h.<br />
The circuit has been examined and evaluated by three of the<br />
four world champion racing drivers who will compete in the<br />
event, Alan Jones, Niki Lauda and Keke Rosberg. All have<br />
described it as the best street circuit in the world.<br />
The Grand Prix itself is the focal point of a week of<br />
celebrations and activities in and around Adelaide which<br />
will include a large amusement park, attempts on feats<br />
recorded in the Guiness Book of Records, a videodome show, a<br />
laser display, an aerial spectacular including the RAAF<br />
Roulettes, a Grand Prix footrace, a massive outdoor concert<br />
and a classic sports car parade. </p>
