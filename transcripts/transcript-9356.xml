PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
AND HIS EXCELLENCY MR GOH CHOK TONG, DOORSTOP,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, TUESDAY, 13 SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PJK: Well, the Prime Minister and I have had a chance of a discussion now<br />
for over an hour and I wanted to take this opportunity again to say how<br />
pleased I am to see him in Australia with a number of Ministers. The<br />
relationship between Australia and Singapore grows more important as<br />
the years go by and I was making the point to the Prime Minister, now<br />
that Australia has really opened up its economy by reducing tariffs,<br />
removing exchange controls, by investing abroad where the whole<br />
culture of Australian business is now to go out rather than remain in,<br />
the linkage with Singapore which is itself, of course, a very famous<br />
trading entity is naturally a closer one. So, our interest is to improve<br />
that closeness and the Prime Minister proposed this morning, and I've<br />
agreed to develop a Singapore-Australia Business Council which we<br />
think can help put partnerships together for developments and<br />
investments by Australians in Singapore and Singaporeans in<br />
Australia. And as well, do things together in third countries and here<br />
the Prime Minister also proposed that we the Governments of<br />
Australia and Singapore through our development organisations<br />
invest in a fund which would do feasibility studies for joint participation<br />
by our industrial companies in third markets. Because the thing about<br />
Singapore is it's now highly developed in many fields in Australia,<br />
businesses at the top of their market share, and it makes no sense to<br />
be trying to expand businesses in some cases in saturated market<br />
environments. So, the obvious thing is to look at the tremendous<br />
potential of third markets and we think that Singapore and Australia<br />
can do just that. So, what we call strategic linkages, we are going to<br />
seek to do that.<br />
We had a long discussion about APEC and our respective positions<br />
going to the Bogor meeting. I think it is fair to say Prime Minister Goh<br />
and I have a fairly close view on how we think APEC should develop </p>
<p>and included in that view is our very strong belief that we should give<br />
President Soeharto every support in making the meeting a success.<br />
Not just for him and for Indonesia, but for the region as a whole.<br />
We've also discussed our defence relations and I am delighted with<br />
the fact that they are progressing very reasonably, in fact quickly.<br />
We'll soon start flying training for the Singaporean Airforce in Pearce<br />
in Western Australia and we are speaking of further collaboration in<br />
army training and as well as that in general exercises. So, I think, we<br />
are both very happy at that development.<br />
We discussed the proposal for closer integration of AFTA and<br />
Australasia and that is something, I think, we see on the medium to<br />
longer term agenda and, I think, we are both happy to see that<br />
progress. The other thing we discussed at some length is the possibility of<br />
tourism and tourism opportunities in Australia for Singaporean<br />
investors, but also and most especially and importantly for the people<br />
of Singapore, and particularly young people. To see young people<br />
come to Australia and get to know the place and to be able to enjoy it<br />
and to have facilities here that they can come to rather than simply find<br />
themselves lost in the tourism market. That they have actually tied<br />
facilities. So, we have discussed that and, I think, we intend to try and<br />
do something about that and make it work and, I think, that is a really<br />
encouraging thing for us to be doing. We have got our respective<br />
airlines with Qantas and Ansett and Singapore Airlines already flying<br />
with some frequency in and out of Singapore and it means, I think,<br />
where Singaporeans are very strong in real estate, we can actually do<br />
a lot here, I think, together in the tourism industry and particularly with<br />
our young people.<br />
At any rate, I would be pleased if the Prime Minister would say some<br />
things to you and I'm sure he'll agree we will take some questions.<br />
GOH: Yes, as you can see we have had very good, substantive discussions.<br />
Prime Minister Keating has very ably summarised the main points<br />
which we've agreed on. We have a very warm, friendly and solid<br />
relationship. Not just between Australian and Singapore, but also on<br />
the personal level between ourselves and between our Ministers.<br />
The future looks good for us to work together in the many areas which<br />
Prime Minister Keating has just outlined. I would be pleased to answer<br />
any questions that you may have or you could ask questions too of the<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
J: this fund that you are referring to how much are you talking<br />
about? </p>
<p>GOH: We are thinking of putting in AUS$ 1 million each and the fund will also<br />
require participation by the companies concerned. It will be a three<br />
way sharing 50 per cent by the joint venture company and 25 per<br />
cent from Australia and 25 per cent from Singapore. It will serve as a<br />
very concrete symbol of co-operation between Australian and<br />
Singapore to encourage our business sectors to work together in third<br />
countries.<br />
J: Prime Minister Goh, you've arrived here just as the damaging shipping<br />
strike has ended. In your perspective as being the head of one of the<br />
major shipping nations in Asia, can Australia really compete when<br />
we've still got these sorts of industrial problems?<br />
GOH: Well, if your industrial problems continue then, of course, Australia<br />
would find it more difficult to compete, but the Australians understand<br />
the problem and, I think, the problems that you have will be solved. It's<br />
got to be solved, otherwise you are going to be left in the back waters.<br />
It will be solved.<br />
PJK: I think it is worth adding Prime Minister, this is the first, we've only had<br />
two of these generalised water front stoppages in our history and this<br />
was a short one and it was essentially about the future of the<br />
Australian National Line. But I think, the image of Australia abroad in<br />
terms of its industrial relations should square with the general facts<br />
and that is, say compared to a decade ago, industrial disputes are a<br />
third of what they were. You cannot run a country with an inflation rate<br />
of around 1 per cent unless the work force are productive and cooperative<br />
and that's, of course, what we have here. But, people also<br />
have a general interest in trying to mark out territory for themselves<br />
and this was a strategic matter for the water front unions, but I think,<br />
can I say I'm very glad they have gone back to work, but more<br />
importantly, part of that has been the general new culture of Australia,<br />
I think, which has sort of encouraged them to understand that this is<br />
not the 1970s and they can't behave as though it is.<br />
J: Mr Keating, given the increased defence links that you just talked<br />
about, do you see any possibility for conflict given Singapore's arms<br />
trade with places like Burma in the region?<br />
PJK: No. I think that Singapore and Australia have been partners in<br />
defence now way back to the Second World War and beforehand, and<br />
since, with the 5-Power defence agreement, and we do many things<br />
together for the intrinsic worth of lifting the proficiency and joint<br />
operations of our respective defence forces, and the policies of the<br />
government of Singapore in respect of it's relations with other<br />
countries in the region is a matter for Singapore. I mean, our point is,<br />
what is our relationship with Singapore? And everything in our<br />
relationship with Singapore augers well for this defence relationship to<br />
grow. </p>
<p>GOH: And may I add that we have a responsible arms sales policy.<br />
J: Prime Minister Goh, do you... given the momentum now towards APEC,<br />
does this leave Dr Mahathir's EAEC proposal out in the cold? If so,<br />
how do you think he is going to extricate himself from that at the Bogor<br />
meeting?<br />
GOH: I have just met Dr Mahathir in Langkawi before I came here. He<br />
believes in EAEC much more than APEC that's on public record, I'm<br />
not revealing a secret and I think Dr Mahathir would still like to see<br />
EAEC move one or two steps forward, and Singapore's position has<br />
always been that we support EAEC provided it is kept consistent<br />
provided that it doesn't undermine ASEAN and it is compatible with<br />
APEC. To us, APEC is a very important organisation, and the EAEC<br />
must not in any way affect the progress of APEC.<br />
J: Prime Minister Goh, given that, would you support any moves at the<br />
Bogor summit to set specific start and finish dates for free trade in the<br />
region?<br />
GOH: We should try and aim for that, but we should also be sensitive to the<br />
other concerns, or concerns of the other countries. So we will<br />
approach this with some elasticity in mind. It can be a range of dates,<br />
starting from 2005 and ending 2020 for countries in various categories.<br />
But we should aim for some dates.<br />
PJK: I have made the points to my colleagues in this country, Prime<br />
Minister, that the important thing is the start dates. The finish dates<br />
tend to be something that local industries very quickly pick up the<br />
changed environment and they arrive much more quickly than the<br />
nominal end-points set by governments it's really about getting a<br />
beginning.<br />
J: In the light of that, Prime Minister, how early do you think you might be<br />
able to get s start date? What's your best estimate?<br />
PJK: Well, the big start is going to be the GATT ratifications. I mean, that's<br />
when we start to see the barrier falling, and that is going to be 1<br />
January ' 95. I think that's the... I'm sure the Prime Minister will have<br />
heard from President Soeharto that one of his objectives is he thinks<br />
one of the most useful that in the first instance, the very first instance<br />
that APEC can do is that the APEC members declare that they are for<br />
ratifying, quickly, the GATT undertakings.<br />
J: Do you believe January' 95 is a date that might be able to be agreed at<br />
Bogor? </p>
<p>PJK: I think that January ' 95 will certainly be the... a commitment by APEC<br />
members, I think, to GATT ratifications, and that will start the protective<br />
devices falling. I think we might leave it at that Prime Minister.<br />
J: Prime Minister are you pleased with Senator Evans's move to the<br />
Lower House?<br />
PJK: Well, that's a domestic, purely a domestic issue, and I'm not here to go<br />
around the world for sport, so thank you Prime Minister.<br />
GOH: Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
