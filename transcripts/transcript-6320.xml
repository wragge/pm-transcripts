FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT THE RETURN<br />
BANQUET FOR PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG AT THE JIANLUO HOTEL. AT 7. 00 PM ON<br />
FRIDAY 10 FEBRUARY:<br />
MR PREMIER, MR VICE-PREMIER<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GER TEMEN,<br />
WE ARE HONOURED BY YOUR PRESENCE TONIGH-T, AND BID YOU WELCOME.<br />
OUR TALKSP MR PREMIER, HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE AND THOROUGH. , THE<br />
UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED IS IMPORTANT TO BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
THE SOUND RELATIONS NOW EXISTING BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES REST<br />
ON A CLEAR APPRECIATION OF THE STRONG COMMON INTERESTS W4E SHARE<br />
AND ON RESPECT FOR DIFFERENCE WHERE IT OCCURS.<br />
WHEN YOU WERE IN AUSTRAL. IA, MR PREMIER, AND AGAIN DURING OUR CURRENT<br />
TALKS, YOU SPOKE OF CHINA'S '' OPEN-DOOR'' POLICY TO THE REST OF THE<br />
WORLD. YOU SAW4 IT AS CONTRIBUTING NOT ONLY TO CHINA'S ECONOMIC<br />
MODERNISATION, BUT ALSO TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD'S UNDERSTANDING OF<br />
CHINA.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS MAINTAINING A-KEEN INTEREST IN YOUR MODERNISATION<br />
EFFORTS. WE SHAL. L MAKE WH4ATEVER CONTRIBUTION WE CAN IN THE SPIRIT OF<br />
FRIENDLY CO-OPERATION AND MUTUAL BENEFIT.<br />
MR PREMIER, WE HAVE AGRLTED-THAT OUR TRADE SHOULD BE INCREASED<br />
IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED A ' CHINA ACTION PLAN' SPECIFICALLY TO<br />
ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE.<br />
AS WELL, I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT, NEXT JUtME, THE FIRST<br />
CONFERENCE OF THE CHINA-AUSTRALIA SENIOR EXECUTIVES FORUM WILL TAKE<br />
PLACE IN PEKING. THIS IS A FURTHER STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSE<br />
WORKING RELATIONS BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS LEADERS AND CHINESE<br />
ENTERPRISE AND AUGURS WELL FOR THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ECONOM IC<br />
AND TRADING LINKS BETWEEN US.<br />
THE FORGING OF SUCH LINKS IS CONTRIBUTING IMPORTANTLY TO THE GROWTH<br />
OF SOUND UNDERSTANDING AND CO-OPERATIVE ENDEAVOUR BETWEEN OUR<br />
COUNTRIES. I BELIEVE THERE ARE GOOD PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH OF CHINA'S SHARE OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN M1ARKET IN MANY SECTORS. WE WELCOME YOUR DOING SO AND<br />
WILL HELP AS A GOVERNMENT WHERE WE CAN.<br />
AUSTRALIA, AS YOU KNOW, EXP ORTS; FOODSTUFFS AND R41W MATERIALS WHICH<br />
ARE CONTRIBUTING TO A STEADILY INCREASING LIVING STANDARD FOR THE<br />
CHINESE PEOPLE. </p>
<p>THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN US YESTERDAY, MR PREMIER, TO ESTABLISH A JOINT<br />
WORKING PARTY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE MIXED TRADE COMMISSION TO<br />
CONSIDER THE SCOPE FOR AUSTRALIAN SUPPLY CF PROCESSED ORE PIG IRON<br />
AND ROUGH STEEL TO CHINA'S STEEL MILLS, IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE<br />
FOR THE SCALE A ND QUALITY OF TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO<br />
COUNTRIES. IN THIS INITIATIVE, WE SEE REFLECTED AN APPRECIATION OF<br />
THE REAL BENEFITS WE CAN EACH DERIVE FROM RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
STRUCTURAL COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF: BOTH<br />
OUR COUNTRIES. THE PROPOSAL WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO TAKE FORWARD,<br />
MR PREMIER, INVOLVES INVESTMENT IN EACH OTHER'S INDUSTRIES AND MUTUAL<br />
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THERE WILL BE GREAT POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR TH4E<br />
AUSTRALIAN STEEL INDUSTRY AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S<br />
COASTAL STEEL INDUSTRY.<br />
A PROMISING BEGINNING IS ALSO BEING MADE WITH AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS<br />
OF EXPERTISE AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY. IN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY, THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES, THE DESIGN OF MULTI-PROJECT CHIPS, COMPUTER<br />
SOFTWARE, BIOMEDICAL INSTRUMENTATION, DIECASTING AND WELDING, AND<br />
PLASTIC MOULDIN3 TECHNIQUES, TO NAME BUT A FEW AREAS, AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TECHNOLOGY COMPETES FAVOURABLY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN THE<br />
FIELD OF MINING TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSPORTATION WE ALSO. HAVE MUCH TO<br />
OFFER CHINA.<br />
IN OUR TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION PROGRAM WE HAVE SOUGHT TO GIVE<br />
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS TO THE TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY. SOME FOURTEEN<br />
PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIELDS OF FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY,<br />
MEDICAL EDUCATION AND COMPUTER MODELLING AND ASSESSMENT ARE<br />
ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED. I AM VERY PLEASED AS WELL THAT A MEMORANDUM<br />
OF UNDERSTANDING ON ANOTHER, THE TIANJIN BLOOD TRANSFUSION<br />
PROJECT, HAS BEEN SIGNED DURING THE COURSE OF MY VISIT.<br />
AGRICULTURAL EXCHANGE AND RESEARCH ARE ANOTHER EXCELLENT FIELD<br />
FOR COOPERATION.<br />
OFFICIALS ARE NOW DISCUSSING AN AGRICULTURAL UMBRELLA AGREEMENT<br />
WHICH I NOPE WILL BE READY FOR SIGNATURE DURING A VISIT LATER THIS<br />
YEAR BY MY COLLEAGUE fMRYERIN, THE AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRY. MOREOVER, THE. DIRECTOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL<br />
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH WILL ALSO SHORTLY COME TO CHINA, AT THE<br />
INVITATION OF YOUR MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE HE KANG, TO DISCUSS<br />
AREAS OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IN WHICH WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.<br />
THIS WORK COULD BE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO CHINA AND AUSTRALIA, BUT<br />
COULD ALSO RESULT IN A BOOST TO FOOD PRODUCTION IN OTHER COUNTRIES<br />
OF OUR REGION.<br />
THE LIST OF EXCHANGES IN MANY AREAS BETW4EEN OUR TWO1 COUNTRIES IS<br />
A LONG ONE AND IS GROWING.<br />
IT INCLUDES CULTURAL GROUPS, HIG-LEVEL LEGAL DELEGATION, AND<br />
DELEGATIONS INVOLVED IN ANTARCTIC RESEARCH, JOURNALISM, TRADE,<br />
AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, TO NAME JUST A FEW.<br />
PEOPLE TO PEOPLE EXCHANGES ARE ALSO EXTENSIVE. AUSTRALIANS, RELATIVE<br />
TO OUR TOTAL POPULATION, ARE THE MOST FREQUENT FOREIGN VISITORS<br />
TO CHINA. </p>
<p>IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, SOME 1,500 CHINESE CITIZENS VISITED AUSTRAIA<br />
IN 1983. LAST YEAR, TJ. O, THERE 14ERE ALMOST 300 CHINESE STUDENTS<br />
STUDYING IN-AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTIONS.<br />
IN 1983, ONE IN TWENTY AUSTRALIAN VISITED THE EXH4IBITIONS OF XIAN<br />
FIGURES A UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO THE HISTORY OF CHINA.<br />
MR PREMIER, AUSTRALIAN ARE NOW MORE CONSCIOUS THAN EVER 13EFORE THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA IS A COUNTRY 0F THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND OUR DESTINY<br />
LIES IN THAT REGION.<br />
OUR POLICY IS TO WORK STEADILY TO REDUCE TENSION, TO BREAK DOWN<br />
BARRIERS, WHETHER POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC, AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL OUR<br />
PEOPLES BENEFIT FROM THE DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH OUR REGION<br />
HAS SUCH A GREAT POTENTIAL.<br />
I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR TWO COUNTRIES CONTINUING TO WORK CLOSELY<br />
TOGETHER IN SUPPORT OF THESE OBJECTIVES.<br />
AS A FURTHER REFLECTION OF THE GROWTH IN AUSTRALIA/ CHINA<br />
RELATIONS, I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE TONIGHT THAT WE ARE TO<br />
ESTABLISH A CONSULATE-GENERAL IN SHANGHAI TO PROCEED WITH 1THE<br />
PLANNING OF A NEW AUSTRALIAN CHANCERY IN PEKING.<br />
MR PREMIER, I ALSO WISH TO ANNOUNCE TONIGH4T TWO OTHER DEV. ELOPMENTS<br />
W4HICH I KNOW WILL HAVE POPULAR APPEAL IN BO0TH CHIN4A AND AUSTPALIA.<br />
THESE ARE SPORTS EVENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE AUSTRALIACHINA<br />
COUNCIL AND NHICH WILL ALSO BE SPONSORED BY AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMPANIES.<br />
THE FIRST WILL BE VISIT TO AUSTRALIA, IMMEDIATELY AF: TER THE<br />
OLYMPIC GAMES THIS YEAR, OF TOP CHINESE SPORTSMEN IN THREE AREAS:<br />
TOP CALSS GYMNASTS<br />
FAMOUS TABLE-TENNIS PLAYERS, AND<br />
MARTIAL ARTS EXPERTS.<br />
I KNOW. AUSTRALIANS WILL GIVE THESE PERFORMANCES A WARM WELCOME.<br />
WE ALSO PROPOSE TO ESTADLISH AN ' AUSTRALIA-CHINA SOCCER CUP''<br />
TO BE COMPETED FOR REGULARLY.<br />
THE FIRST CONTEST WILL BE LATER IN 1984 WHEN AN AUSTRALIAN SOCCER<br />
TEAM WILL VISIT CHINA. I BELIEVE THIS I-ILL CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
TO BUILDING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF CHIN4A AND THE PEOPLE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
TOAST CUNDERLINE ONE)<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
I PROPOSE A TOAST TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF THE PEOPLE'S<br />
REPUBLIC OF CHINA, TO THE HEALTH AND W4ELL-BEING OF PPESIDEN4T<br />
LI XIANNIAN, PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG AND OTHER CHINESE LEADERS AND TO<br />
FRIENDSHIP AND INCREASING CO-OPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. </p>
