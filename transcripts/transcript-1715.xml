EMBARGO--NOT FOR RELEASE BEFORE 7 PM ( EST),<br />
FOR PRESS: 7 O 16 PM. No. 12C/ 1967<br />
DROUGHT ASSISTANCE FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
Following Is the text of a telegram which was sent today<br />
by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt, to the Premier of South Australia,<br />
Mr Donald Dunstan: " In your letters of 1st and 8th November about<br />
drought assistance arrangements, you told me of your plans<br />
regarding the rate of interest which your State Intends to<br />
charge on loans for carry-on, restocking etc.; you asked<br />
about the availability of the grants component of the<br />
Commonwealth funds to cover such local employment works<br />
as may be found necessary; and also for rebate on the cost<br />
of rail traffic needed to Import oats from Western Australia<br />
for seed and essential feed purposes to be met out of drought<br />
relief grants from the Commonwealth.<br />
I am pleased to advise that the proposed arrangements<br />
concerning Interest to be charged by South Australia on<br />
loans are acceptable to the Commonwealth.<br />
We are also willing to treat as eligible for grant<br />
assistance under drought assistance arrangements grants made<br />
by your Gcvernment to local authorities and government<br />
Instrumentalities to provide necessary relief work In drought<br />
areas. S2uch grants should, of course, be limited to cases where<br />
the drought Is clearly the cause of the unemployn-ent.<br />
The Commonwealth would also be prepared to<br />
provide reimbursement for rebates of up to 75 per cent, on<br />
proposed movement from Merredin to Port Adelaide of oats<br />
for seed and fodder."<br />
