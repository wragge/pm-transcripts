SECOND READING SPEECH<br />
by<br />
THE PRIM'E MINISTER. THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENT!, TIVES. CANBERRA. TUESDAY. 10TH OCTOBER. 1961<br />
RAILWAY AGREEM~ ENT ( WESTERN AUSTRALIA) BILL. 1961.<br />
This Bill seeks the approval of the Parliament to an Agreement botween<br />
the Commorwealth and the Western Australian Governments relating to reconstruction<br />
of the Kalgoorlie/ Fremantle/ Kwinana line of the Western Australian railways,<br />
In the course of a statement I made last February about the<br />
Government's economic measures, I indicated our interest in certain major<br />
projects in the States as projects which could make a significant contribution<br />
to national growth and development, particularly in the promotion of increased<br />
export earnings. I said then that the Government had several large undertakings<br />
under consideration; that we were prepared to assist in their detailed planning;<br />
and that we would, at an appropriate time, consider the provision of financial<br />
assistance to facilitate their execution. One of the undertakings I mentioned<br />
was a railway project in WJestern Australia which would aid the establishment of<br />
an iron and steel industry in that State and in respect of which the Government<br />
of Western Australia had sought Commonwealth financial assistance.<br />
We subseauently embarked on a close examination of this railway<br />
project in consultation with both the Government of Western Australia and the<br />
Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. We satisfied ourselves that construction of the<br />
railway had a vital place in that Company's plans for a major expansion of the<br />
steel industry. Indeed, we ascertained that, if the railway were not built,<br />
the prospects of an expansion of steel production which would substantially<br />
assist in bringing about a major contribution to our export earnings would be<br />
adversely affected. It was against that background that we entered into<br />
discussions with the Government of Western kustralia, the outcome of which is<br />
reflected in the Agreement of which the approval of Parliament is now sought.<br />
Conditional upon the construction of a standard gauge railway for the<br />
carriage of iron ore, an agreement was concluded late last year between the<br />
Western Australian Government and the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd, for the<br />
establishment of an integrated iron and steel industry allied with the<br />
development of the iron ore deposits at Koolyanobbing.<br />
In that Agreement the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. undertook, by the end<br />
of 1968, to set up at Kwinana a blast furnace with a capacity of 450,000 tons<br />
per annum of pig iron, and to establish within the following ten years a steel<br />
making plant and additional rolling mill facilities to produce 330,000 tons per<br />
annum. of finished steel products. Part of the scheme for establishing the steel<br />
industry was and is the development of the rich and extensive ore deposits at<br />
Koolyanobbing and Bungalbin, situated about 33 miles north-east of Southern<br />
Cross. The ore requirements for the steel works at kSwinana, and for shipment<br />
from Western Australia to other steel works, will be in the region of two<br />
million tons per annum.<br />
The existing narrow gauge railway would be quite incapable of carrying<br />
economically tonnages of this magnitude, and, to be able to cope with the likely<br />
traffic, would need to be substantially reconstructed. Because of the capacity<br />
of a standard gauge line to carry the heavier loads and cope with the speeds of<br />
modern trains, and because of the fact that, for the tonnages which would beinvolved,<br />
the standard gauge line would make the enterprise economically sound<br />
and attractive, it became essential to reconstruct the track on standard gauge<br />
rather than on the existing 31611 gauge.<br />
The Government of Western Australia therefore proposed reconstruction<br />
to standard gauge of the railway between Southern Cross, on the main east-west<br />
railway, and Kwinana, south of Fremantle, plus construction of a spur line from<br />
Southern Cross to Koolyanobbing, for the purpose of carriage of ore from the<br />
Koolyanobbing deposit to the site of the steel works. Such reconstruction, if<br />
done by itself, would have left the section of the main line between Kalgoorlie. </p>
<p>and Southern Cross on narrow gauge. In order to avoid yet another break of gaU&amp;<br />
on the east-. wast railway system, therefore, the State Government proposed that<br />
the section between Kalgoorlie and Southern Cross should also be reconstr'Ucted<br />
to standard gauge as a part of the overall project.<br />
The proposals of the Western Australian Government were closely<br />
examined by the Commonwealth in all their aspects. Very substantial funds are<br />
involved, the cost of the railway works at current cost levels being estimated<br />
at Å 41,200, 000. The analysis which has been made of the estimted expenditure<br />
and operating results of the line shows that, based on the carrying of 2<br />
million tons per annum. of iron ore and on general traffic at exidsting levels,<br />
the new line should be a thoroughly sound economic proposition. Indeed, it is<br />
to be expected that the new line will attract additional general traffic, and to<br />
the extent that it does so the economics of the railway should be correspondingly<br />
still further improved.<br />
The construction of the line is in itself a project of the first<br />
imnortance, but oven more important is the part which the project as a whole<br />
will play in the development of Australia's resources, the increasing of export;<br />
and/ or the saving of imports. It will bring to Western Australia a major heavy<br />
industry, certainlr 1te most important industrial undertaking in the history of<br />
that State, and indeed among the most significant projects of this kind<br />
undertaken in the Commonwealth in recent years. The ijestern Australian proposal<br />
is an essential part of a general expansion in steel making capacity planned by<br />
the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. for the purpose of producing a substantial quantity<br />
of steel for export, and thus will make a most valuable contribution to the<br />
export potential of this country.<br />
Moreover, the establishment of a basic steel industry in Western<br />
Australia will inevitably bring in its train a number of ancilIlarj industries.<br />
These will contribute further to the general economic expansion of th. State and<br />
will do a greait deal to promote the industrial balance which is so important to<br />
this part of Australia. It is not en exaggeration to say that the undertaking<br />
will represent just about the most remarkable new advance in the development of<br />
Western Australia since the discovery of gold.<br />
Having all these important considerations in mind, the Government<br />
concluded that the proposed railway undertaking merited the assistance of the<br />
Commonwealth in financing it. It was obvious that, because of the very large<br />
cost of the project, the State Government would be unable to go ahead with it<br />
without financial assistance. We. therefore, commenced negotiations with the<br />
*-estern Australian Government and were nuickly successful in reaching agreement<br />
with that Government on the work to be done, the manner in which it wou~ ld be<br />
performed, and terms undor which it would be financed.<br />
I come now to a brief description of the contents of the Agreement<br />
itself. With regard first to the method of financing, the undertaking has, as<br />
1 have indicated, olements related both to development and to rail<br />
standardisation. In its industrial developmental aspects it has in it features<br />
veÃ±' y similar to the proposal for the reconstruction of the Queensland railway<br />
from Collinsville to Mt. Isa. Insofar as it is a standardisation project, it<br />
resembles the Victorian and South Australian Rail tandardisation projects in<br />
whiich the Commonwealth has participated. It was difficult to differentiate<br />
precisely between the proportions of the costs which should be attributed to<br />
each of these elements. e discussed the matter at some length and reached<br />
agreement with the State Government that as a matter of broad judgment the cost<br />
might be divided into two equal parts one half of which could be regarded as<br />
representing the developmental element and the other the rail standardisation<br />
element in the project.<br />
This is not to say that particular components of the overall project<br />
are to be treated as developmental components and others as standardization<br />
oomponents. The arrangement is rather that all expenditure on the project as a<br />
whole, irrespective of the particular nature of that experditure, will be<br />
treated as comprising equal parts of developmental and standardization<br />
expenditure. </p>
<p>For the dE. l'eJopwral portion the Commonwealth will provide 70% of the<br />
funds initially required and the State The money provided by the<br />
Commonwealth will be repaid by the State from its Consolidated Revenue over a<br />
period of 20~ years commencing from the completion of the project, with interest<br />
at the long term bond rate ruling at the time the advances are made. Interest<br />
accruing during the construction period may be capitalised if the State desires.<br />
These provisions follow closely the now accepted arrangements in the case of the<br />
Mt. Isa Railway. For the standardisation portion the Commonwealth wil-l provide the iwhice<br />
of the finance initially required, and the -State will repay friom its Consolidated<br />
Revenue, over a period of 50 years, 30% of the amount provided during each<br />
financial year together with interest at the long term bond rate ruling at the<br />
end of each such yeaar on the outstanding amount from time to time These terms<br />
follow those in the Victorian and South Australian Rail btandardisation<br />
Agreements except that some special sinking fund provisions in the South<br />
Australian Agreement ( but not the Victorian) will not apply in this case.<br />
The overall effect of these arrangements is that the Commorwealth<br />
will provide 85% of the total initial finance ( 70% of the developmental part and<br />
100% of the standardisation part) and that the State will provide 15% of the<br />
total initial finance ( 30% of the developmental part). On the basis of an<br />
estimated cost of E4J, 200, O0fl the estimated amounts to be found by the<br />
Commorwealth and by the State in the first instance are Å 35million and<br />
Å 6,200,000 respectively.<br />
The effect of the provisions relating to repayment by the State is<br />
that the State will eventually meet 65% of the total cost ( 100% of the<br />
1evelopmental element and 30% of the standardisation element). The proportion<br />
of the overall cost to be finally met by the Commonwealth will be 35% ( 70% of<br />
the standardisation element), On the basis of an estimated overall cos: t of<br />
Å. 41,200, mOO, the respective figures are State E26,800,000, Commonwealth<br />
Provision is made in the Agreement for the furnishing of estimates of<br />
funds required each year and for annual statements showing the expenditure<br />
incurred on the project from time to time, together with a revised estimate of<br />
the amount required to complete the work.<br />
The usual provisions are made for the keeping of accounts and records<br />
and for the audit of accounts by the Auditor-General for the State.<br />
The work to be done under the A~ greement is set out in some detail in<br />
schedules annexed to the Agreement. Briefly, what is proposed is a new<br />
standard gauge line parallel to the existing track from Kalgoorlie to East<br />
Northam, with a new line from Southern Cross to the site of the ircn ore leases<br />
at Koolyanobbing. The existing 31611 gauge track between Kalgoorlie and<br />
Coolgardie will be retained, as a third rail, in addition to the W811 guge<br />
to permit the working of the existing 3t' 6" line between Kalgoorlie and Esperance.<br />
From East Northam the line willI take a new route vin Toodyay and the Avon River<br />
Valley to Midland. This deviation from the existing route is necessary to<br />
provide the required grades for the heavy trains which will be operating and<br />
which could not be operated over the present route.<br />
The line will then follow the existing track to Perth and Fremantle<br />
and on to Kwinana. There are associated works necessary in and a-round the<br />
metropolitan area and sowe narrow gauge works, especially between East Northam<br />
and Midland, which are needed for the maintenance of services on the State's<br />
narrow gauge system. There are also some ancillary works made necessary by<br />
the provision of the new standard gauge line, including new station buildings,<br />
workshop facilities, marshalling yards and the like. Standards for the<br />
construction are also set out in a schedule to the Agreement. There is<br />
provision for variation of the schedules if the Commorwealth and the State<br />
agree that variations are necessary for the more effective fulfilment of the<br />
objectives of the Agreement. </p>
<p>Rolling stock to be provided is also set out in a schedule. it<br />
consists of the rolling stock necessary to lift twu million bono por annum of<br />
iron ore, together with rolling stock needed to carry general traffic at the<br />
present level. The estimates for rolling stock include a component representing<br />
the minimum requirements for general traffic which generally constitutes the<br />
extent of the intention of the Agreement for that particular type of rolling<br />
stock. The Agreement provides, however, that -the objectives in regard to the<br />
general traffic rolling stock may be varied by agreement following a review to<br />
be carried out about the end of the year 1966. It is intended that this review<br />
shall take into account the quantity of rolling stock which tlh,-State : T'ly have<br />
available for conversion to standard gauge at -uhat date and any other fa-ct -2' s<br />
which may be relevant at that particuL' time.<br />
The work entailed is to be carried out by th5 Western Australian<br />
Government, the intention being that it will be completed by 31st December, 1968..-,<br />
In the interest of the more efficient and expeditious completion of the project,<br />
it is provided that, except where special circumstances may dictate otherwise,<br />
thu work will be carried out by the letting of contracts after public tenders<br />
have been called.<br />
The A~ greement provides for close collaboration and agreemeaft between<br />
the State and the Commonwealth for the programming, planning and carrying out of<br />
the work. Expenditure on work done under the Agreement is subject to<br />
authority of the Minister for Shipping and Transport. There are several<br />
miscellaneous provisions. In the unlikely event of any dispute arising, it is<br />
provided that the matter in dispute shall be determined by the Commonwealth<br />
Treasurer. Another clause provides that the parties affirm the principle that<br />
their respective railway authorities shall collaborate with each other in the<br />
matter of standards of design and construction of rolling stock and also its<br />
operation to the end that an efficient co-ordinated service over the Commonwealth<br />
and estern Australian railways will be achieved and intersystem traffic be<br />
facilitated. This provision is an important one. The Commonwealth and<br />
' estern Australian Governments are making a substantial investment in this<br />
railway and both Governments are anxious to ensure that the maximum possible<br />
benefits are obtained from the new line when it comes into operation. The<br />
Commonwealth and Western Australian Railways will both benefit from the<br />
interstate general traffic operating over their respective systems, and it is<br />
obviously desirable that they should make such arrangements as will ensure that<br />
this traffic moves with the minimum of delay, and that the travelling public and<br />
shippers of goods will receive the best and most efficient service that can be<br />
provided. I am sure that this great railway project will have the whole-hearted<br />
support of Honourable Members on both sides of the House. It will have farreaching<br />
effects of the most beneficial kind on the development of Australia<br />
and of Western Australia,( which is an important part of Australia) in particular.<br />
Indeed, it can truly be said to mark an important milestone in our advance as an<br />
industrial nation. I have great pleasure in commerding the Bill. to the House. </p>
