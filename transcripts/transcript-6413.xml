PRIME MINISTER<br />
P'OR MEDIA211 JUNE 1984<br />
Dr Dennis Murphy played a significant role in the revival of<br />
A. ED. P. fortunes nationally and in Queensland.<br />
He was a distinguished scholar who translated his commitment<br />
to the Labor movement into action.<br />
I extend my deepest sympathies and those of the Government<br />
to Dr Murphy's family.<br />
He enjoyed the respect of all sections of the Labor movement<br />
who will mourn his untimely passing. </p>
