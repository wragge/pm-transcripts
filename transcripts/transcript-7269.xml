CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CAPTAINS DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE-31 DECEMBER, 1987<br />
1 am delighted to respond to Captain Portal's toast.<br />
In doing so, I note that Spain was the first country to<br />
accept the Australian Government's invitation to take part<br />
in the Tall Ships Australia 1988 event.<br />
I note also that the Captain's ship, Juan Sebastian Do<br />
Elcano is no stranger to Australian waters; she visite'd<br />
Au-stralia on her maiden voyage in 1928.<br />
years later, we welcome her back for Australia's<br />
aicentenary.<br />
Tall Ships Australia 1988 honours Australia's maritime past.<br />
The modern Australian story is written upon the sea.<br />
And it it, first of all, a story of sailing ships.<br />
It begins with the epic voyages of exploration by the<br />
Portugese, Spanish, Dutch, French, British.<br />
Then, from the time of the first European settlement 200<br />
years ago, sail determined our survival.<br />
Sailing ships carried vital supplies to the infant colony.<br />
For most of the first century sailing ships brought<br />
immigrants across the ocean to these shores.<br />
Sail played a vital role in trade as fast clippers carried<br />
our wheat and wool to faraway markets.<br />
steam replaced sail. The telegraph provided fast<br />
communication. oow' 1 I </p>
<p>but the sea remained our vital link with the rest<br />
world.<br />
Arid today, as a nation which lives by trade,. the sea temal<br />
our life-line.<br />
Nothing could symbolise so dramatically or more<br />
beautifully Australia's past, present, and future than the<br />
presence of these magnificent ships.<br />
Long after the Bicentenary celebrations have finished we in<br />
Australia will remember with pride that the people and<br />
Governments of Ecuador, the Federal Republic of Germany,<br />
France, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Now<br />
Zealand, Oman, Poland, The Principality of Andorra, Spain,<br />
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of<br />
America and Uruguay accepted our invitation to send ships to<br />
take part in this great event.<br />
we especially welcome the young people who form so large a<br />
proportion of the crews.<br />
I understand that fifty percent of the crew of every shipin<br />
the Tall Ships race must be between the ages of 16 and<br />
Young people all over the world have risen magnificently to<br />
the challenge of Tall Ships.<br />
For example, in the Netherlands, 9000 young women and men<br />
applied to sail the Abel Tasman to Australia.<br />
cogauath oung crews on their endurance of the<br />
many difficulties tat must have confronted them during<br />
their voyages to Australia.<br />
I know that the visiting trainees will be entertained by<br />
young Australians, during their stay.<br />
And one of the great things about this event is that it<br />
brings the young pople ' of many nations together in a spirit<br />
of friendship and goodwill.<br />
I am pleased to say that young Australians have also taken<br />
up the challenge to crew the visiting vessels.<br />
Twelve young Australians sailed on the Young Endeavour,<br />
Britain's Bi centennial gift to Australia.<br />
But those twelve were chosen from over 7000 young<br />
Australians who applied to sail on the Young Endeavour.<br />
It is clear that our young people, too, respond to the<br />
challenge of the sea. 0 0371i </p>
<p>t betits a peoplv who are, ovorwhelmino1y, a natiQn<br />
Castal dwellers.<br />
e have this vast continent for our home.<br />
Yet three-quarters of our people live within fifty miles of<br />
the oceans, even after 200 years of European settlement.<br />
I congratulate the Australian Bicentennial Authority on the<br />
conception and organisation of this fine event.<br />
And on behalf of the Government and people of Australia I<br />
thank all those participating in it and so contributing<br />
memories which will give lasting pleasure to millions of<br />
people around the world, whether they see it first hand or<br />
on television. Yours is a truly magnificent contribution to<br />
our celebration. </p>
