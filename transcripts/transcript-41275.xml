    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>HIS EXCELLENCY MR RIVLIN, PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL:</strong></p>
<p>You are most welcome. We are already, in the name of all the people of Israel, I can say to you that they are so pleased that you are here and we are welcoming you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Mr President, thank you and your welcome has been so warm. We thank you for it.</p>
<p>We share so much history but above all we share the same values.</p>
<p>And the values of freedom and democracy were those for which the Australian Light Horse fought and won 100 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>And that enabled, as we discussed in Beersheba yesterday, that enabled the creation of the State of Israel.</p>
<p>It was a step along the road and we are proud to have played a part in ensuring the extraordinary achievement, the fulfilment of history here in Israel.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be here.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL:</strong></p>
<p>The step towards Beersheba was the first step towards Jerusalem, to free Jerusalem and to unite Jerusalem – that’s what our friends have done 100 years ago and we are so pleased to have you here with us after 100 years.</p>
<p>We are looking forward for the next 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>And many more centuries.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
