TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, HOTEL MEURICE, PARIS, 19 JUNE<br />
1989 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST:. Prime Minister imports are obviously still<br />
increasing dramatically. Should there be a further interest<br />
rate rise?<br />
PM: I'm not saying there should be a further interest rate<br />
0 rise. I repeat what I've said consistently, that all<br />
settings of policy will be kept as tight as is necessary to<br />
deal with the situation. Just making a general comment on<br />
the figures. The figures come in at about the mid range of<br />
the market expectations. To this point the reaction to the<br />
market on the exchange has been not in a downward direction.<br />
It's important to note I think, that the import figure Is<br />
dominated by the increase in machinery about a 23% Increase<br />
in machinery $ 250M in the last month and as we've been<br />
saying while these are imposing strains upon the accounts,<br />
nevertheless we'll be seeing the later beneficial effect of<br />
those figures in a strength in economic Infrastructure. But<br />
it makes quite clear that we have to keep all policy settings<br />
tight and they will be kept tight.<br />
JOURNALIST: When would you anticipate a significant positive<br />
downward movement in the May indicators?<br />
PM: It's hard to say. We've been saying earlier on this<br />
year that we hoped In the third quarter that we'd see that<br />
impact and that remains my hope.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the settings are tightening up Mr<br />
Hawke, particularly monetary policy? You've said before you<br />
see no need for rates to go up further. Do you adhere to<br />
that position?<br />
PM: I repeat what I've said before.. They'll be kept as<br />
tight as is necessary. we will watch the impact of policies<br />
In a constant way, as we always have. I trust that the<br />
policy settings are tight. What you've got to remember Is<br />
that we haven't been sitting on our hands. In the Premiers'<br />
Conference we slashed another $ 2.7B, almost $ 3B off the funds<br />
available to the States. So that has represented a<br />
significant tightening of policy in the fiscal area.<br />
Moentary settings are tight and as you know in the area of<br />
wages policy, very tight indeed, with an expected outcome of<br />
about 6 1/ 2 per cent. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: So monetary settings are tightening up?<br />
PM: The questlon has been put three different ways. I'm not<br />
giving another different answer to the ones I've given.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you see any scope f or helping home<br />
owners with their loan repayments in the Budget context?<br />
PM: What I've said before is what I repeat here and that is<br />
that there have been a number of proposals that have appeared<br />
in the public arena on this Issue and we are prepared to<br />
analyse those considerations but that does not mean that<br />
there Is any decision that's Imminent. But it does make<br />
sense where Proposals are put to excamine them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Increase in sales tax on luxury goods to try<br />
to dampen demand?<br />
PM: Well that's a proposal that has been talked about. So<br />
any of these proposals that have been raised, and they have<br />
been raised fairly extensively within the Party ranks, some<br />
people in Government seem to have made the suggestion, a<br />
number of commentators in the markets have talked about these<br />
things. Now a sensible government will look at all these<br />
sorts of proposals, examine them, look at their various<br />
implications, now that's been done.<br />
JOURNALIST: So Mr Hawke what comfort can you offer<br />
home buyers who are now facing a crisis in terms of their<br />
mortgage repayments because of the Government's policy<br />
settings? PM: The first thing I would say is to repeat what must be<br />
repeated arnd that Is that these policies have not been put in<br />
place capriciously. They've been put there because the<br />
economy is operating at too strong a level. It's quite clear<br />
O from today's figuire that we can't continue to have an economy<br />
operating at the level which brings in this sort of Imports.<br />
Now if the community can say, ' oh well you're sloppy in the<br />
fiscal area, you're sloppy in the wages area and you're just<br />
hitting us with tight monetary policies', then that would be<br />
a legitimate criticism. Fiscal policy Is tighter now than It<br />
has even been, reflected in the very significant surplus,<br />
reflected in the zero public sector * borrowing requirement,<br />
reflected in-the fact that we, a. a result of these things.<br />
are paying off debt at the Commonwealth level. in the area<br />
of wages policy, historically never tighter, never been a<br />
situation where you've had such high levels of economic<br />
activity and such low levels of wage increase. So the tight<br />
monetary settings are in that overall tightness of policy and<br />
what follows from that is that If you didn't have tight<br />
monetary policy like this then the impact upon the very<br />
people that you're talking about and that I'm concerned with </p>
<p>would be significantly greater. Now the rich in the<br />
community, the well off, would be able to accommodate<br />
themselves to a situation where we just capriciously said,<br />
' oh well we'll generally lower interest rates'. Because we<br />
all know what would happen then. The dollar would plunge,<br />
interest rates would go through the roof, the economy would<br />
collapse. So it's these people who admittedly, and that I'm<br />
very concerned about are suffering now would suffer much<br />
more. So we'll have to keep policies tight for as long as<br />
with this combination of other policies we can get a gentle<br />
let down in the level of economic activity. I repeat to the<br />
people that you properly mention in your question. I repeat<br />
what I've said to them. That as soon as it is responsibiily<br />
possible then the rates will come down.<br />
JOURNALIST: the areas of sending signals. Far example<br />
privatisation. Does it look like the Government's running<br />
out of options unless you can move in that area as well.<br />
PM: You're not really suggesting that privatisation is an<br />
answer to the problems of the high level of economic<br />
activity. I mean it's an important issue, it's an important<br />
issue, but it's an irrelevant issue to the question of the<br />
level of economic activity.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke this is still the highest figure on<br />
record. Were you personally worried when you saw them or<br />
heard about them this morning?<br />
PM: Well I think it's covered by what I just said earlier<br />
Niki, that the figures came within about the mid range of<br />
expectations. I would've been more worried It it had been<br />
over $ 2B. it does seem on the evidence that's available to<br />
me Just before I cam down to this press conference that the<br />
market hasn't reacted adversely. If anything the dollar has<br />
gone up somewhat.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke about" the hail f-Senate-elect ion.<br />
Your comments the other day about the half-Senate<br />
PM: I've been fascinated by the way<br />
JOURNALIST: You've set the hares running about<br />
PM: They've set the hares running. I mean you've been<br />
infected you people here by the Paris atmoshpere. 1-had a<br />
look, I asked my people to get out what I said earlier on<br />
this. I Just remind you of what I said and I have no reason<br />
to depart from this. Nothing I've said really does depart<br />
from it. This was the 19th January, my daughters birthday.<br />
Now let me see what I had to say. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOURNALIST: r* i'<br />
PM: I'm indebted to you for your assistance but I'd rather<br />
have me saying actually, directly, what I said rather Milton,<br />
than some Interpretation of it or attempt to go to what I<br />
said. " It is the case that you could have the House of<br />
Representatives going up until November of 1990. But that<br />
means you would have to have a half-Senate election by the<br />
middle of the year and then a House of Representatives<br />
election. It would be a pretty bold Prime Minister who would<br />
try and pull that one off and I'm bold and agressive but I<br />
don't think I'm that silly. So that really means that the<br />
outer limit is about May of next year"<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you that silly yet?<br />
PM: Never been that silly, not likely to be that silly now.<br />
It is the fact that the sort of thing that excited me so much<br />
over the last couple of days is technically and legally a<br />
possibility. That's a fact. I can't and won't attempt to<br />
change those facts. But I have no difference in my<br />
assessment and assumption of what would be politically<br />
prudent than that statement which I delivered on the 19th of<br />
January. JOURNALIST: Does that mean there won't be a half-Senate<br />
election? PM: It looks like it doesn't it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: You really have to concentrate on the trip now. You<br />
can't sort of wind It up now, ' Hawke's thinking about a funny<br />
sort of election timetable'. Now I've made it very clear so<br />
now try and concentrate your attention on the trip because<br />
there's some very important issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Before we get back to the trip Prime Minister,<br />
if the f igures keep coming in at this level do you think<br />
there's any need for a further tightening of fiscal policy In<br />
the Budget, further spending cuts?<br />
PM: There'll be obviously a review of that situation. You<br />
will have seen that Paul said in his statement on the BOP<br />
figures that we will now go into the fourth year in a row of<br />
reduced real Government outlays and so that will require a<br />
very careful scrutiny of program.. But we're not looking at<br />
any massive cute. But the most fascinating thing in this<br />
area isn't it now I read in the cuttings this morning is the<br />
collapse of all the hoohar from Mr Peacock and the Liberals.<br />
The * re we were getting from Dr Hewson and the rest of them the<br />
story that we were going to have massive expenditure cuts. </p>
<p>The significant difference from the Hawke Government policy<br />
and he seems to be battling to stir up the courage to talk<br />
about another billion dollars worth of cuts. There is no<br />
suggestion on what's come out of the weekend of conservative<br />
politics that they are any closer to getting themselves<br />
together. All they seem to be doing is still fighting pretty<br />
vigourously amongst themselves. A sight which Is very<br />
pleasing to see from the other side of the world. pleasing<br />
JOURNALIST: How much margin is there for cuts?<br />
PM: Very, very much less margin than has been in the past<br />
for the very simple reason that you've never had a government<br />
which has but as much as this one. Get your perspective<br />
right. What we've had now is three successive years of real<br />
reductions in Commonwealth outlays. A second year or<br />
surplus. This has never been done before with the zero<br />
public sector borrowing requirement. Now you can't, just by<br />
similar definition, you don't need to be well versed In<br />
economics to know the facts that if you've been cutting and<br />
cutting and cutting and if you've done what's never been done<br />
before, three years of real reductions in outlays, by<br />
definition there Is not very much room left for much more If<br />
you're going to continue to provide a reasonable level of<br />
services that the Australian community properly expects.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke taxation is the other side of fiscal<br />
policy. Would you see any prospect for increases In taxes as<br />
a way of tightening fiscal policy?<br />
PM: I've already directed an answer to a question in that<br />
area here this morning. I've been asked a question which<br />
said is there a possibility of some increases in taxes and if<br />
you read the transcript you'll see what my answer to that Is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke if you did increase sales taxes on<br />
luxury goods would that hurt our trade position, imported<br />
goods? PM: I'm not going to that hypotethical question. I mean let<br />
me simply say that any decisions that we made would be<br />
consistent with our proper stance on international economic<br />
policy. JOURNALjIST: Mr Hawke earlier this year you cut $ 700M from<br />
State and Federal Government spending programs. Do you think<br />
you could aim for a billion in the Budget reasonably?<br />
PM: No I've got nothing to add to what I've said on<br />
ends </p>
