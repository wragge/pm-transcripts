PRIME MiNISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 July 1983<br />
I have this afternoon received a letter from Mr. Young<br />
tendering his resignation from the Ministry. I have with<br />
regret considered it necessary to accept his resignation.<br />
The circumstances involved in his decision go to matters<br />
which will be dealt with by the Hope Royal Commission. I<br />
refer particularly to Clause 17 of the issues to be<br />
resolved in respect of para of the Commission's Terms<br />
of Reference i. e. " was there any unauthorised or improper<br />
disclosure by any and what Minister of the information made<br />
available to the NIS Committee concerning the relationship<br />
between Combe and Ivanov before 11 May?"<br />
I am also seeking an opinion from the Attorney-General as to<br />
whether an offence may have been committed under the Crimes<br />
Act. It is perfectly clear that I am therefore at this point<br />
unable to answer any questions on this matter.<br />
I need hardly say that the resignation of Mr. Young who<br />
is a close friend and valued colleague over many years and<br />
my necessary acceptance of that resignation, is for me a<br />
matter of profound personal sadness. </p>
