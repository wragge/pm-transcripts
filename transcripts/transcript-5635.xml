WAGE DETERMINATIO N AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
STATEMENT FROM THE PREMIERS' 1 CONFERENCE<br />
The Premiers' Conference meeting in Canberra today expressed<br />
strong support for Australia's established system of wage<br />
fixation involving Commonwealth-and State tribunals.<br />
It was the responsibility of all Governments and all parties<br />
involved to make the system work.<br />
The Commonwealth and State tribunals provide an avenue through<br />
which wage and other claims can be appropriately processed and<br />
in which due-regard is given -to equity and fairness and by which<br />
protection is provided to the lowest paid workers.<br />
There is a system in place already. It will work if it is<br />
allowed to and if it is supported by all parties. Until such<br />
time as a national wage case is concluded, an industry claim<br />
needs to be brought forward quickly to enable principles to be.<br />
determined following the abandonment of waqe indexation.<br />
The Conference asked the ACTU and the CAI to consult about the<br />
orderly handling of claims to come before the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission. In doing this they should have regard<br />
to the need to resolve some of the sharper pressures presently<br />
in the system, notably the need to establish conditions that<br />
would contribute to maintenance of living standards while<br />
ensuring the interests of the less industrially strong were<br />
appropriately safe-guarded.<br />
The Commonwealth informed the conference that the CAI had<br />
expressed the view yesterday that the Metal Industry Award<br />
could be broughtforward speedily for listing and hearing before<br />
the Commission. This could clarify principles on * which indus~ try<br />
cases would be based. It would also be a clear demonstration<br />
that the current system is working and can contribute to an<br />
orderly and equitable resolution of disputes.<br />
The Governments committed themselves to seeking common principles<br />
so that there can be orderly processing of claims and consistency<br />
of treatment in both Commonwealth and State tribunals. They<br />
agreed that they would ask the presidents of their various<br />
tribunals to meet as-soon as possible in order to assist in -this<br />
process. </p>
<p>r They also committed themselves to working for the establishment<br />
of agreed principles which can be put to a national wage case.<br />
All Governments have asked their Ministers for Labour to meE~ t<br />
in an endeavour to resolve this matter.<br />
It was also agreed that there was an urgent need to establish<br />
machinery to resolve demarcation disputes more effectively<br />
and expeditiously.<br />
The Premiers'-Conference indicated that the major parties,<br />
the employers and the trade unions, must accept significant<br />
responsibility for the orderly settlement of disputes within<br />
the f ramdwork established by Governments and called upon the<br />
parties to contribute to achieving that end.<br />
Governments recognise that they all have obligationd to see<br />
that the benefits of economic growth are distributed throughout<br />
the Australian community and that the large and powerful, be<br />
they corporate or union, should not be in a position to gain]<br />
unfair or-unreasonable advantage. They also recognise that<br />
ther,-e are limits to the growth of wages possible in any one<br />
year. Claims for wage increases need to be balanced against<br />
other calls on resources such as those from welfare<br />
beneficiaries and the need for investment funds by businesses.<br />
All Governments supported the concept of a wide-ranging<br />
national enquiry into wage determination and industrial relations,<br />
but recognised that this was a longer-term exercise. It did not<br />
detract from the need for all parties to work to ensure the<br />
present system operated effectively and equitably.<br />
