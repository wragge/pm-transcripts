<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks again for joining us. They were nasty comments</p>
<p> I thought from women over all with the report card for the Government.</p>
<p> I'm not sure if the previous Government would have got a better</p>
<p> one.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They were fairly predictable given the attitudes of the women on these</p>
<p> issues. What we've sought to do over the last three years is</p>
<p> to give women choice to treat them as individuals. Not to try and</p>
<p> stereotype a form of behaviour. To recognise that more than anything</p>
<p> else the two things that modern women want are respect and choice</p>
<p> and if you give them those two things it is not for governments to</p>
<p> mandate or tell women how to use the respect they deserve and the</p>
<p> choice they ought to enjoy.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>How seriously do you treat these kinds of Â‘International days</p>
<p> of...'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well some of them more seriously than others. People are interested</p>
<p> in achievable outcomes these days. They are less interested in empty</p>
<p> symbolism. They are more interested in achievable outcomes. I don't</p>
<p> think domestic violence as Eva Cox said, is a - she calls it safe</p>
<p> - I know she wasn't trying to be clever in saying that but I</p>
<p> believe it still remains for a lot of women a very important issue</p>
<p> and it is one of those issues that does unite the disparate groups</p>
<p> of women within the community. You'll have women's groups</p>
<p> that have different ideas on just about everything else but when it</p>
<p> comes to something like the physical safety of women they're</p>
<p> not surprisingly quite united. I think it is an important issue and</p>
<p> I think it still remains an area where considerable work needs to</p>
<p> be done.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>A quick question on another social issue that you've been asked</p>
<p> a lot of questions of lately, but Jeffrey Kennett's asked you</p>
<p> to put ahead the interests of an addict over your own personal views</p>
<p> and reconsider this opposition to a heroin trial. Have you got a closed</p>
<p> mind on this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not, in this issue, imposing my own view over the interests</p>
<p> of addicts within the community. It's interesting you ask me</p>
<p> that question. Only last night one of my South Australian colleagues</p>
<p> handed me a submission put together by a group of people made up of</p>
<p> addicts, led by a woman who lost her daughter last year to a heroin</p>
<p> overdose, and they are passionately arguing that I should not alter</p>
<p> my position on a heroin trial. And these are people who have been</p>
<p> directly affected. And this idea that I've embarked upon some</p>
<p> personal moral crusade and I'm just opposing a heroin trial because</p>
<p> of some personal moral view couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
<p> Of course heroin is a scourge, and of course it's a difficult</p>
<p> issue, and of course there's a variety of views on it within</p>
<p> the community and that's what makes it so perplexing. You can</p>
<p> meet parents who've lost their children through a heroin overdose</p>
<p> asking for a heroin trial and the next day you can meet parents who've</p>
<p> suffered a similar tragedy with their children pleading with you not</p>
<p> to have a heroin trial.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But do you still have an open mind on the issue or....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look my view has not changed. I mean what's.....this is another</p>
<p> new paradigm that unless you're prepared to change your view</p>
<p> you have a closed mind. I mean you can maintain a sensible position,</p>
<p> and not out of a closed mind but because you actually think that it's</p>
<p> in the public interest to maintain that view.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now on Friday you had lunch with Les Murray. Have you got any rhyming</p>
<p> couplets for me?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are making progress. He's a great writer. I'm indicating</p>
<p> to him the sorts of things the Government would like in the preamble.</p>
<p> And I've....</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Give us a couple of examples.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no no no no. Well I want the whole thing when it's finished</p>
<p> to be revealed at once and not dribbled out bit by bit.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But Parliamentarians all around the place here are pacing the floor</p>
<p> with little phrases, popping up lines....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think that's terrific.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Is this getting you excited this process?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think the public would like a new preamble and this is something</p>
<p> where I believe the whole community could come together. You don't</p>
<p> have to be a republican to want a new preamble.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>It gets you more excited than the concept of a republic?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it certainly does because I don't think that really is going</p>
<p> to change the character of the country all that much and you know</p>
<p> my views on that. But we're keeping our commitment. We said we'd</p>
<p> have a convention. We had a convention. We said we'd put the</p>
<p> view that emerged from the convention to the public and we are doing</p>
<p> that. I don't know what more that I can do than to simply honour</p>
<p> the promises that I made on that subject to the Australian people.</p>
<p> They'll decide it, not me. In the meantime, having a new preamble</p>
<p> is something that can bring everybody together and I'm hopeful</p>
<p> that when Les has finished his work in response to what I've</p>
<p> put to him we'll have something that most Australians can support.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well from one literary figure to another, from Les to David Malouf</p>
<p> - I understand helped draft the reconciliation words and again the</p>
<p> form of words is important. Are you really opposed to the entirety</p>
<p> of what they have suggest....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not. I am not opposed to the entirety of....</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Can you tell me what....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, look I am not. I am not going to conduct what ought to be</p>
<p> a private dialogue with the Council for Reconciliation publicly. There</p>
<p> is nothing achieved by that. We still have a long way to go in relation</p>
<p> to that issue but I am trying, my colleagues are trying. I can't</p>
<p> guarantee that we are going to succeed but there's goodwill there.</p>
<p> But obviously nothing is achieved by dissembling and nothing is achieved</p>
<p> by pretending that we are making progress in certain areas where that's</p>
<p> not being achieved. I simply say to the Council that there is goodwill</p>
<p> on the Government's part and we are going to keep trying.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>You say there's goodwill but, I mean, Gatjil Djekurra, your own</p>
<p> appointment to ATSIC says that relations have never been worse between....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, look I have answered the question and, I mean, that really is</p>
<p> a waste of a question.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>To move onto some of the subjects before Parliament, this week you</p>
<p> bring in your Bill to ultimately fully privatise Telstra. How important</p>
<p> is Senator Colston's health to this process?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it is decent to talk about somebody's</p>
<p> health in that kind of way. I wish him well as I would wish any Member</p>
<p> of Parliament well who has a serious illness. We would like the support</p>
<p> of the Senate. We put this policy to the Australian people in October</p>
<p> of last year, we asked them to pay some regard to the fact that the</p>
<p> Australian people returned us to Government, we think they ought to</p>
<p> pay a lot of regard to that.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But if Senator Colston's health....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not....</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>.....if he's too ill to attend Parliament that will....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to hypothesise, Matt. I can only say that we want that</p>
<p> legislation, we have a mandate for that legislation, we'll have</p>
<p> a better more competitive Telstra and we'll have more individual</p>
<p> Australian shareholders if we can privatise Telstra first....further</p>
<p> privatise it first to a further 16 per cent, 49 per cent and then</p>
<p> ultimately subject to the community service safeguards, 100 per cent.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine says that the common....sorry, I have misquoted</p>
<p> him here, but he is saying that the common interest should be more</p>
<p> important than the interests of shareholders, that the community interests</p>
<p> should be more important. Do you agree with that or do you think....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, there's nothing incompatible with that and what I have said.</p>
<p> There's a community interest in more Australians owning shares.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Okay. Moving on to the Ralph report. How keen are you to see a 30</p>
<p> per cent corporate tax rate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think everybody would like to see taxes as low as possible.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>30 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Everybody would like to see taxes as low as possible.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>You are not buying in on this debate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, we have got a report. There are a lot of arguments in favour</p>
<p> of having a uniformly lower rate, equally people are arguing if you've</p>
<p> had a depreciation allowance, for example, for a long time then it's</p>
<p> a serious dislocation to take it away. We want to hear the arguments</p>
<p> and that is what's going to happen.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well, the latest study by Price Waterhouse Coopers says that the mining</p>
<p> industry in Australia would become the least competitive amongst our....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Matt, these are things we'll take into account but you</p>
<p> are not going to get a Government decision out of me this morning.</p>
<p> And all I can do is repeat what I said a few seconds ago and that</p>
<p> is we'll hear all the arguments and in the end the Government</p>
<p> will have to make a decision.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>New South Wales election's on soon. Sydney airport is still looking</p>
<p> a bit like a disaster with these near misses and breaches of curfews....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh now, Matt, really. We must be responsible. I mean to say it's</p>
<p> a disaster....</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well, it's a political hot potato....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have one of the best aviation safety records in the world. We do,</p>
<p> without qualification. We are an outstandingly safe environment for</p>
<p> civil aviation. We have great safety records and we are the envy of</p>
<p> most countries around the world. So I think we have to keep a sense</p>
<p> of proportion.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Why then is Air Services Australia saying basically that it's</p>
<p> all too hard, give it back to the corporation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are issues there that are being debated but I am not going</p>
<p> to go into them publicly. Some of them are issues for Cabinet to resolve</p>
<p> but I want the Australian flying public to understand that we still</p>
<p> have incredibly safe procedures in this country and we are, aviation</p>
<p> wise, a very safe country.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And you still have full confidence in Dick Smith do you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now, the Abbott/Costello trial finished last week and interestingly</p>
<p> the judge there said that politicians, if anything, had more to gain</p>
<p> from protecting their public image, that this kind of defamation hurts</p>
<p> them, if anything, probably more than the ordinary citizen. Do you</p>
<p> agree with that view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Matt, I am not going to buy into what was a piece of private</p>
<p> litigation although it received an enormous amount of publicity. That</p>
<p> was a matter where quite understandably my two colleagues and their</p>
<p> wives felt very strongly. The reputation of people whether they are</p>
<p> in public life or not is very important to them and I understand people's</p>
<p> feelings. Reputations are precious to all of us. Now, beyond that</p>
<p> I don't have any comment. It's not right, it's a private</p>
<p> matter and both Peter and Tony have said after their initial reaction</p>
<p> that they didn't want to say any more. I am certainly not going</p>
<p> to disrespect their wishes.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And a final question, Prime Minister, do you think your counterpart</p>
<p> in the Opposition, Mr Beazley's got a rival in Laurie Brereton?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I am not going to buy into that except to say that having</p>
<p> been around in politics for 25 years I would say what Laurie Brereton</p>
<p> has done over the last few weeks has got far less to do with foreign</p>
<p> policy making and a lot more to do with profile making.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p> [ends]</p>
<p>   SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS</p>
<p> WITH MATT PEACOCK, ABC RADIO</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, it's still not clear yet but certainly the citizens</p>
<p> of Avalon didn't want Baywatch. What's your view on that</p>
<p> decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if ultimately that opportunity for more jobs and new investment,</p>
<p> and I guess a further exposure of you know, a part of our society</p>
<p> and a part of our beautiful beaches to the world is lost, I think</p>
<p> it will be a very poor show and it will be something of a metaphor</p>
<p> of the difficult public attitudes we still have in this country towards</p>
<p> job creation.</p>
<p>We can't simultaneously say that an unemployment rate of 7.5%</p>
<p> is too high yet behave in an unwelcoming way towards opportunities</p>
<p> that would generate more jobs. We just can't have it both ways.</p>
<p> And if it is the ultimate result that this production returns to the</p>
<p> United States by going to Hawaii and having been made unwelcome in</p>
<p> Australia, well that will be something of a metaphor for the explanation</p>
<p> as to why the American unemployment rate is 4.5% and ours is still</p>
<p> 7.5%. It's not only governments that have responsibilities in</p>
<p> these areas, the whole community does, and if community attitudes</p>
<p> still remain difficult and stubborn on some of these issues then it</p>
<p> makes the Government's job that much harder.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But you can understand people fighting to protect their little private</p>
<p> sort of beach.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look everybody has those interests and I understand that perfectly</p>
<p> well. But you can also understand my position and the Government's</p>
<p> position. We are constantly told to find new ways, new policies, new</p>
<p> opportunities to create jobs. Our unfair dismissal law is blocked</p>
<p> in the Senate. People are threatening to vote against our proposal</p>
<p> to entrench youth wages, and communities appear unwilling to embrace</p>
<p> new job opportunities. Now this is a responsibility for all of us.</p>
<p> We've all got this responsibility to reduce unemployment. And</p>
<p> I repeat, if we lose it and I know it's only a small thing in</p>
<p> a sense in its own right, it will be a metaphor for the reason why</p>
<p> America's unemployment rate is three percentage points lower</p>
<p> than ours.</p>
