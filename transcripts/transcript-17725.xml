CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY</p>
<p>In particular, thank you to Secretary Clinton, whose career as a woman in public life has been such an emblem of inspiration and courage. </p>
<p>Hillary, you've been an example to women all over the world.  I want to echo your own words in 2008.</p>
<p>You applied them to others but I believe they apply to you.  Your bravest and most remarkable achievement is what you have made unremarkable ... female leadership.</p>
<p>You've made it unremarkable that women lead.</p>
<p>It is a great good fortune to be here today.</p>
<p>I say that because I do believe that women like Secretary Clinton and I are fortunate. </p>
<p>While we have worked for the positions we hold, we owe the opportunity to so many women of courage who came before us.</p>
<p>From pioneer women in politics like Susan B Anthony in your country and Jessie Street in mine right down to today. </p>
<p>And not only in the century since International Women's Day but throughout history. </p>
<p>Every brave mother who ever raised a strong daughter helped us get here.</p>
<p>Those women worked for more than political rights and they worked for more than the opportunity for women to hold high office. </p>
<p>Those women worked to improve all aspects of all women's lives.  And we believe today in the same things those women believed in always: in our rights.  Our equality.</p>
<p>Not just the right to vote, but the right to equal work and equal pay, the right to proper services, the right to physical safety.</p>
<p>Perhaps the right of greatest ultimate importance, the right to education. </p>
<p>I am passionate about education.  I believe deeply in education's transformative power. </p>
<p>Education is the key to all our opportunities.  It is the great tool for self improvement and social progress.</p>
<p>Whatever else women and girls may encounter in life, a sound foundation of excellent, rigorous education ought to be their entitlement. </p>
<p>Education is the one thing no one can ever take away from us.</p>
<p>And education takes courage as well.</p>
<p>It always takes moral courage to learn to read. </p>
<p>For any teacher, any child, it is an adventure.  And reading is an adventure that never ends. </p>
<p>I saw that courage in the young women whose high school President Obama and I visited yesterday at Wakefield, Virginia... just as I saw that courage in the little girls whose primary school  I visited last week at home in Canberra.</p>
<p>But in too many parts of our world today, girls learning to read need real physical courage as well. </p>
<p>This is the great symbol of global courage: women's fight for the right to read. </p>
<p>And I want a world that is safe for the girl who reads.  A world where the girl who reads doesn't need physical courage and neither does her teacher. </p>
<p>Wherever they are.</p>
<p>In an Indonesian school which provides a basic modern education in that most populous Islamic country where support from the Australian Government is so vital.</p>
<p>In a school in Uruzgan province in Afghanistan, with female literacy of less than one per cent but now with the freedom for girls to learn to read where Australia is providing $36 million over four years through Save the Children to improve education and health for women and children.</p>
<p>So today we remember the courage of women in the last hundred years who worked for all of us to have the rights we share.</p>
<p>We salute the courage of women here today who have worked so hard to make the most of the rights they have.</p>
<p>And we promise to be just as courageous in working for rights for all women and girls tomorrow, here and around the world. </p>
