J^ U; THAILA.^ MNISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 1 April 1979<br />
US ARTICLE ON HYDROGEN BOMB<br />
To-day's edition of the Sunday Observer . states that<br />
" Classified information on how to make a hydrogen bomb has been<br />
circulating in ' Melbourne". It also reports that " the information,<br />
in the form of a 40 page article, including diagrams; wa:<br />
deposited in a Melbourne bank vault after it was given to the<br />
Sunday Observer". The Sunday Observer acted responsibly and c. elivered<br />
that newspaper's copy of the article to the Government.<br />
The Government has confirmed that the copy received<br />
from the Sunday Observer is the article that a United States<br />
magazine was recently restrained by injunction of a F] ede:-al<br />
Court from publishing in the United States.<br />
It is understood that the U. S. Secretary Energy<br />
Mr Schlesinger in an affidavit filed in the proceedi. ngs in the<br />
U. S. Court stated that publishing the article would irreparably<br />
impair the national security of the United States by making<br />
available to foreign nations secret, restricted data pertaining<br />
to the design and operational characteristics of a thermr)-nuclear<br />
weapon. Mr Schlesinger also said that the information in the<br />
article would enable countries, which do not now have a thermonuclear<br />
capac: i. ty, t. o 1 l. op such weaponsj in a Jhori. l,( r Li. i.: than<br />
W.# l. d otherwise be pos. sible. </p>
<p>S iThe Sunday Observer claims that at l. est one other<br />
copy of the article is known to be in Australia<br />
Our technical advisers agree with the asse:; sment of<br />
the United States authorities and Australia shares thhe U. S.<br />
Government's concern.<br />
Against that background, the Government is satisfied<br />
that publication of the article might well be useful to assist<br />
the acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional countries.<br />
Australia is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and<br />
is committed to pursuing nuclear arms controland non-proliferation<br />
objectives as a member of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva.<br />
The Government's position is clear and unequivocal.<br />
Consistent with the principles which I outlined in my<br />
statement to the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in<br />
New York on 5 June 1978, an essential element in nucl. ear arms contro<br />
is preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional<br />
countries. This involves the security of all Austral. ians and<br />
indeed of all the world. Proliferation triggers furTher<br />
proliferation causing instability and risk for all.<br />
Publication of the article will, in the judgment<br />
of the Government, be prejudicial to the safety or defence of the<br />
Commonwealth. It is my duty to make the people of Australia<br />
aware of this judgment. A . general obj. c. ction to secrecy in the area<br />
of nuclear weapons provides no justification for publication of this<br />
material. . Any person who may have possession of a copy of the<br />
article and who may be contemplating its publication must understan,<br />
clearly that dissemination of this material can only 1b projudi(; ci<br />
to Australia. </p>
