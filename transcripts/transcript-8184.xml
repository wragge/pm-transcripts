PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, VICTORIAN UNIVERSITY OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY, MELTON, 2 NOVEMER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how Important do you believe<br />
education reform is?<br />
PM: It's the most important single reform that any<br />
society can undertake. As I was saying in my speech<br />
here, you cia characterise a society as to whether it's<br />
truly democratic by the measure of the equality of<br />
opportunity -to education. That was one of the great<br />
disasters of Australian society before we camne to office.<br />
As I said, only one in three of our kids stayed on in the<br />
education system and these great conservatives who after<br />
seven years in office had increased the retention rate by<br />
I've doubled it in my period of office. There's now<br />
two out of three of our kids staying on and we've<br />
reflected that in vastly increased expenditures for TAFE<br />
and in the educational area because unless you have a<br />
situation where kids, whatever the income level of their<br />
Parents or wherever they live, unless they've all got an<br />
equality of opportunity then you haven't got a democratic<br />
society. JOURNALIST: Well if this is so important why was it not<br />
then on the agenda of the Special Premiers' Conference?<br />
PM: It was.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Dawkins says that the PremierB<br />
rejected<br />
PM: Well it just goes to show that if you ask a question<br />
you should always be sure of your facts. It was on the<br />
agenda and it's listed on those items which will be the<br />
subject of review and report to the Premiers' Conference<br />
next year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well Mr Dawkins says that the Premiers have<br />
picked on him by<br />
PM: Well I'm not getting into that. I've told you the<br />
answer to the question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the old subject of opinion<br />
polls, the latest one shows a substantial erosion of<br />
support for Labor, particularly among blue collar<br />
workers. What comment do you have on that? </p>
<p>PM: Well as I've said before I wouldn't like to go to a<br />
poll now because there is some hurt in the community from<br />
some hard things we've got to do. But let me make this<br />
point. You talk about blue collar workers. It you<br />
wanted a perfect illustration of the difference between<br />
Labor and the conservatives you've got it here. You're<br />
right in the middle of it. For most of the post war<br />
period, the overwhelming proportion in post war period,<br />
certainly from 1949 on, they had control of this country.<br />
The federal level and certainly at the level of Victoria<br />
here. And what was their legacy In education? A<br />
pathetic level by international standards, as I've sala,<br />
where only one in three of the kids stayed on in school.<br />
It you were a kid who came from well to do parents or if<br />
you lived in the right part of town, you had no problem<br />
about access to education. But If you came from<br />
relatively Low income families and you lived in the<br />
western suburbs your chances were near to zilch. Now<br />
we've transformed that and I treat with contempt the<br />
people who i-ay we haven't got concern for our roots and<br />
for the ordinary people. This is living proof of all the<br />
years of conservatism and the western suburbs have<br />
nothing, they were treated with contempt when it came to<br />
educational opportunity. I committed myself when I came<br />
to Uovernment with my Party in power that we were going<br />
to change that. We've changed it here in Melbourne,<br />
we've changed it in Sydney and this Australian society<br />
is now characterised not by privilege in education that<br />
you had before we came but now it's characterised by<br />
equality of opportunity.<br />
JOURNALST1: Mr Hawke, do you think that the Kirner<br />
Government will have to lift its game dramatically in<br />
Victoria if you are to hold office?<br />
PM: well obviously Joan and her colleagues realise that<br />
they have beien very seriously hurt by the events of the<br />
past year in Victoria. It's hurt them and it's flowed on<br />
and it's hurt us. But that's no secret to Joan and I<br />
believe in the relatively short period that's she been<br />
Premier she has made a tremendous start. Let me say I've<br />
just come from a two day Premiers' conference in Brisbane<br />
and the respect in which she was held by her colleagues<br />
right across the board was most remarkable. She is, I<br />
think, outstanding and she has the determination and<br />
obviously to the extent that she fights back and improves<br />
her position here in Victoria, that will be of assistance<br />
to us.<br />
STUDENT: Mr Hawke, would you ever consider increasing<br />
Austudy helping the students<br />
PM: Would I ever consider it? I've been doing it for<br />
seven years. I do more than consider it, I've done it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you increase </p>
<p>PM: I'm not: here for an argument.<br />
JOURNALIST: There are increasing signs from overseas<br />
that there's this greater and greater expectation that<br />
the crisis in the Gulf is moving to a climax. Is that<br />
this Government's assessment and is there anything that<br />
can be considered to get the hostages out?<br />
PM: Well you've got two sets of questions there. Let me<br />
go to the first one. Now obviously I am privy to a fair<br />
bit 0Ã± private intelligence and so on and I can't share<br />
that but I can say this, that I don't think there's<br />
anyone in the world, anyone, who can say with certainty<br />
what the future course of events is in the Gulf. I think<br />
you can say these things. There is a determination on<br />
the part of most nations of the world who have united<br />
under the unanimous resolutions of the Security Council<br />
of the United Nations that the annexation of Kuwait by<br />
Saddam Hussein shall not be allowed to stand. Tflat<br />
determination remains very, very firm. And it's being<br />
backed by an increasing presence of resources there in<br />
the Gulf. The second point I think flows from that, that<br />
I think it must be becoming increasingly apparent that<br />
Saddam Hussein that he will not be allowed to retain<br />
Kuwait, that his forceful annexation of Kuwait will not<br />
be acceptable to the international community in general<br />
and Including most importantly to his Arab neighbours.<br />
So I would hope that an Intelligent assessment of those<br />
facts should lead to a withdrawal an unconditional<br />
withdrawal by Saddam Hussein. But as I've said before on<br />
all the evidence, you're not dealing with someone who is<br />
totally rational in his calculations. But I would hope<br />
that the Increasing build up of evidence that he cannot<br />
sustain and will not be allowed to sustain that position<br />
will lead him~ to a peaceful withdrawal. I can say<br />
thirdly this point, that I know that the leadership in<br />
the United States does not want war. It is serious when<br />
it says it doesn't want war, that it wants a peaceful<br />
resolution of this matter. And that certainly is the<br />
position of mny Government. Now in regard to the<br />
hostages, which was the second part of your question, you<br />
will have noticed that the European governments have<br />
unanimously made the point that they believe it is not<br />
helpful for t~ he semi-official moves by particular nations<br />
to send people in there and try to negotiate the release<br />
of some hostages. What happens Is that some get released<br />
and others are left and it tends to confuse the<br />
determination of the rest of the world to bring about an<br />
end to this mfatter. Now having said that, I want it<br />
understood that as far as we're concerned, these two<br />
things are important. Firstly, that we are unremitting<br />
in the work by our official representatives there, our<br />
diplomatic people in protecting the interests of the<br />
hostages and working for their release. There is not a<br />
day goes by in which our officials are not working to<br />
that end. Secondly, I say this, that if in fact some<br />
individuals seek to go there and work for the release<br />
then we woulti hope if they do that, that they may have </p>
<p>4<br />
some success. But it is, I believe, a correct judgement<br />
by European nations that at the official level the way it<br />
should be done is in the way it is being done, behind the<br />
scenes ceaselessly but that the attempt to give some<br />
credibility to Saddam Hussein by having senior people<br />
meeting and negotiating with them is not, in the overall<br />
sense, helpful.<br />
STUDENT: Bob, how are we going to go in the cricket,<br />
mate? Are we going to beat them this year?<br />
PM: Yes, too right mate. TOO right.<br />
ends </p>
