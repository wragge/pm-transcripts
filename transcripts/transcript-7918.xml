TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JANA WENDT, A CURRENT<br />
AFFAIR, 21 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, thank you very much for your time this<br />
evening. PM: Pleasure, Jana.<br />
WENDT: Now for some time the Opposition has been telling<br />
us that the dole system is being rorted, you and your<br />
Government have been saying all is well. Why are you<br />
clamping down?<br />
PM: No we haven't. The fact is, Jana, that over the<br />
period we've been in office we have significantly<br />
tightened the eligibility criteria and the testing<br />
criteria so that there has been a very, very significant<br />
reduction in the number of people taking unemployment<br />
benefits, not simply because of the increase in jobs<br />
available, but also because of the increasing in testing<br />
and as we go along we're finding ways of improving that.<br />
But this is historic. I mean, it's not just increasing<br />
the toughness of the testing. It's really abolishing the<br />
unemployment benefit and it's all now in terms of<br />
allowances for training.<br />
WENDT: But Mr Hawke, the Opposition has been saying it's<br />
being rorted, your people, Mr Howard's been saying it's<br />
all fine up until this point.<br />
PM: We haven't been saying it's all fine because we've<br />
been changing it. We've toughened the procedures<br />
successively since we've been in and we've seen how there<br />
are further ways of improving it, but it's not just a<br />
question of making it tougher. This change is much more<br />
significant than that. It really is to get rid of the<br />
concept of unemployment benefit altogether and simply<br />
say, Jana, that what we're about is to totally<br />
concentrate the outgoings from Government, not as a<br />
benefit, but as a training and job search arrangement.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, as I said in my introduction, it looks<br />
like you're following the Opposition.<br />
PM: Well, it may look like it to the Opposition, but I<br />
can tell you what, after the mess they've made of this </p>
<p>country in the whole area of employment and unemployment,<br />
they'd be the last people we'd be looking to for an<br />
example. WENDT: Mr Hawke, you've offered us a lot of dollars<br />
today. What is the value of those dollars if they are<br />
lost in a sea of inflation and high interest rates?<br />
PM: Well, they won't be lost in a sea of inflation and<br />
high interest rates. The Treasurer has given the<br />
inflation indicator and just, to put that in perspective<br />
Jana, remember that the Treasury that's independent of<br />
us the Treasury, statement at the end of December as to<br />
the underlying inflation rate-was 5.7 percent. So<br />
what Paul is saying, on behalf of the Government, is<br />
totally consistent with that and, after all, you would<br />
expect now that the banking industry itself is saying<br />
that interest rates are going to come down, it's not just<br />
me and Keating. The banking industry is saying inflation<br />
is coming down, demand is coming off. So with an<br />
underlying inflation rate of 5.7 identified by the<br />
Treasury and demand coming off and interest rates coming<br />
down, the six percent is a sound figure.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, your Government's record on predicting<br />
inflation rates is not good is it?<br />
PM: Well, it's not too bad. We've been a little bit<br />
under, but let me say this in terms of outcomes which I<br />
guess is the important thing. Just look at what we've<br />
done. We inherited an inflation rate of 11 percent and<br />
we've brought it right down<br />
WENDT: I appreciate that, but you and your Treasurer<br />
predicted that inflation would now be at around four and<br />
a half. It's in fact, regrettably, it's around eight.<br />
Now that's not a good record, is it?<br />
PM: Well, Jana, let me say that in respect of the Budget<br />
time, Budget time estimate looks as though it's just<br />
about going to be on track. But the other thing is that<br />
if you go back over a slightly longer period, it is true<br />
that we and all economists in this country, public and<br />
private, underestimated to some extent the level of<br />
demand. We all underestimated it and with demand being<br />
higher than we all expected, certainly inflation was<br />
somewhat higher.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, that's tantamount to saying ' we were<br />
wrong' isn't it?<br />
PM: It's not tantamount to. I'm saying and I've said<br />
it before, this is not the first time and I've said<br />
that all economists, including the official Government<br />
economists, somewhat underestimated demand, but that was<br />
at the beginning of last year, but what I'm saying now is<br />
that the policies that we have brought in, Jana, to </p>
<p>soften demand, to ease demand, it's been universally<br />
recognised they're working.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, election time is a time of reckoning<br />
and so<br />
PM: Yes, sure.<br />
WENDT: And so those people who are thinking of casting a<br />
vote will look at you and say, well they've been wrong<br />
all the way down the track about the inflation forecast,<br />
why should we believe them now?<br />
PM: No, I don't think they will. I think they will ask<br />
what the outcomes have been. They will recognise they've<br />
been a little bit higher than people expected and<br />
anticipated, but they will say that the underlying<br />
inflation rate is going down. And that's not simply my<br />
Judgement, that's the independent Treasury judgement,<br />
that the underlying inflation rate is going down as a<br />
result of the policies we've brought in and the<br />
alternative, Jana, as you know, will be a blowout in<br />
inflation and interest rates because our opponents have<br />
this enormous $ 6 billion credibility gap fiscally and a<br />
wages blowout, which, both of which must mean an<br />
inflation and interest rate blowout. Now they're going<br />
to say, now which is the better? Is it the one where<br />
Keating today has fully funded any new proposals that<br />
we'll be putting, fully funded, against our opponents<br />
who've got a $ 6 billion gap? Where's the money coming<br />
from?<br />
WENDT: Well, I suggest to you that some people might<br />
think that you are following the Opposition's lead, that<br />
you're trying to catch up. But if you don't mind, if you<br />
could stay with us, we'd like to take a break.<br />
PM: Sure. </p>
<p>4<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, there is a great mass of people, middle<br />
Australia, who are living on the edge. Are you proud of the<br />
fact that the Hawkce years have produced this whole group of<br />
people who are finding it so tough to survive?<br />
PM: If that was the only thing that had come out of the<br />
seven years I would be worried. But of course that's part<br />
of a situation in which, there, I've asked for restraint.<br />
Restraint has been exercised. And as a result of the<br />
restraint we have these things. Job creation five times<br />
faster than it was before. We have, instead of one in three<br />
of our kids staying on in school, two in three. We have a<br />
fair health system. Now these things you can't conjure up<br />
out of the air. They've got to come because the community<br />
is prepared to exercise restraint. They say is it better to<br />
restructure your education system, to have more jobs, to<br />
retrain your kids, have then in the education system. If<br />
you're going to do all those things which make Australia an<br />
infinitely better place, then we just can't have unlimited<br />
increases in our personal positions.<br />
WENDT: But in that case it must be enormously frustrating<br />
for you personally to know that these people are suffering<br />
and it is the result of the Hawke years.<br />
PM: But it is as a result of the deal that I asked them to<br />
do. I mean I said when I came in in ' 83, 1 said do you want<br />
Australia going on fighting one another, those with some<br />
power to grab some more, get it whether you're a worker or<br />
an employer and fight and produce the worst recession we had<br />
in 50 years. That was what I inherited. r said are you<br />
prepared to do it differently, to have negotiations which<br />
mean that the measure of your improvement won't just come<br />
through your increase in wages, in money wages, but that we<br />
will have tax cuts. When I came to power the top tax rate<br />
was 60 cents in the dollar and the bottom was 30. We've<br />
reduced that to 47 and 21. Instead of the kids not going to<br />
0 school they're going to school. We're building more<br />
university places. we're restructuring our industry. But<br />
nothing in this world which is tough in terms of<br />
restructuring and changing nothing like that comes<br />
easy. I mean I could've, as Prime Minister, if I'd accepted<br />
Jana, each of the recommendations that had been made by the<br />
Independent Tribunal, my salary as Prime Minister would've<br />
been very, very, very much higher than it is. But I've said<br />
for myself and others you've just got to exercise restraint.<br />
Just don't grab money-wage increases. Ask yourself is<br />
Australia a better country because we've now got twice as<br />
many of our kids staying on in school, because we've got<br />
another 1.6 million of our fellow Australians employed,<br />
because we've got everybody covered by Medicare, is it a<br />
fundamentally better country now? My answer is yes it is. </p>
<p>WENDT: Mr Hawke, there is a body of opinion that says that<br />
you have lost track, that you've lost touch with those<br />
people who are suffering. Without wanting to go too far<br />
with this, do you think that it's important that you as<br />
Prime Minister for instancet that you know the price of a<br />
loaf of bread?<br />
PM: Well I wouldn't think it's important that I know the<br />
price of a loaf of bread. I mean I can test, Jana, every<br />
day I can test when I move around, when I'm not sitting<br />
there in Canberra, when I'm moving around I can test whether<br />
people think I've got some feeling for them. I mean just<br />
today, let's be right up to date. I went to the Leagues<br />
club there in the Eastern Suburbs. Now I think your cameras<br />
will probably pick it up on tape and sound. I had a number<br />
of old ladies coming up to me, pensioners, and they said<br />
thank you Mr Hawke, we've never been better of f than we've<br />
been. Now they were not my words. That simply reflects one<br />
thing. When I came to office the pension as a proportion of<br />
average weekly earnings was 22.7. No0w, in April when they<br />
get this next increase, it will be over 25%. It will be the<br />
highest proportion or average weekly earnings in<br />
WENDT: Despite what you say<br />
PM: I'm simply making the point clear. I don't want to<br />
interrupt but I'm simply making the point that I know that<br />
the things that we've done, that we've got the kids in<br />
school that weren't there before. I know that we've been<br />
concerned with the people who need help and that we're doing<br />
the things to make it a better society.<br />
WENDT: But despite what you say, and you acknowledge this I<br />
believe, that there is widespread disillusionment with you<br />
and the Opposition, what responsibility do you take for the<br />
cycnicism that exists in the electorate today?<br />
PM: Well I suppose every politician, every Prime Minster<br />
could be a better communicator. I've tried all my life to<br />
talk with and listen to people. I think I'm a good<br />
listener. I've tried to be all my life. And I guess I've<br />
got to accept some responsibility. But I also know that<br />
I've been prepared to take the tough decisions. I mean it<br />
would've been easy, relatively, to take sloppy decisions<br />
which at the time might have been more popular. I mean it<br />
would've been easier to do an Andrew Peacock in regard to<br />
the pilots for instance and say let them have their 30%. It<br />
hasn't been too pleasant for me to be subjected to all the<br />
innuendo to which I've been subject. And you know a lot of<br />
it. I mean it's been frightful the sort of things that have<br />
been said. But I simply knew, Jana, that if I let the<br />
pilots get away with their 30% claim, the Australian economy<br />
was finished. </p>
<p>6<br />
WENDT: Prime Minister, the pilots do have a lot of support<br />
in the community.<br />
PM: Not a lot.<br />
WENDT: We are running out of time and I regret that, but<br />
PH: can come back some time.<br />
WENDT: I'm sure you can. What do you do if you lose?<br />
PH: I would, it's purely hypothetical, I don't think I<br />
will, but I would not have any personal sense of loss. I've<br />
been Prime Minister for seven years, thoroughly enjoyed it<br />
and hope live been a good Prime Minister. But I've had a<br />
public life before as Prime Minister and there's a lot for<br />
me to do afterwards. But I would have the most profound<br />
indescribable sense of loss for my country. Because it's<br />
not that they'd lose Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. That's<br />
not the point. But this mob opposite me who hate one<br />
another I mean the depths of the hatreds between them is<br />
immeasurable have not produced any policy on health after<br />
seven years. Who have a policy which is going to take<br />
billions of dollars from the ordinary people of Australia<br />
for roads, education, hospitals and put it in the pockets of<br />
the very rich and privileged by abolishing the capital gains<br />
tax. Are going to return the workplace into confrontation.<br />
I mean I'd hate to see my country in the last decade be<br />
returned to that. That's what I would find, devastating.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke I thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thanks very much indped Jana.<br />
