    <content><![CDATA[<p>Improving management of our groundwater resources is growing in importance across Australia.  Today I am pleased to announce that one such West Australian project has secured funding under the Australian Government Water Fund's Water Smart Australia Programme.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will provide $782,000 towards a $2.35 million investment to improve recycling of stormwater and reduce ocean outfall in and around the Town of Cottesloe.</p>
<p>The restoration of the Cottesloe groundwater aquifer is a direct partnership between the Australian Government and the Town of Cottesloe.</p>
<p> The Cottesloe project will filter stormwater that will then be used to replenish the Cottesloe groundwater aquifer.  Ten stormwater ocean outfalls will be removed and underground stormwater treatment, storage and recharge tanks will be installed.  In addition to these measures, a public education programme will aim to reduce private groundwater use, decrease the installation of new private bores and reduce stormwater pollutants.</p>
<p>The project will reduce the risk of seawater intrusion and the aquifer collapsing and will minimise pollutants entering the aquifer by cleaning polluted stormwater.  Importantly it will reduce stormwater ocean outfalls by an estimated 180 megalitres every year and will achieve more sustainable household and garden water consumption through reuse of stormwater.</p>
<p>The management of the groundwater aquifer is not generally a council responsibility.  States and Territories are addressing their commitment to groundwater management through the National Water Initiative.</p>
<p>I congratulate everyone involved in this project.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Water Fund is open to States and Territories that have signed on to the National Water Initiative, as well as companies, local governments and community groups that can contribute to the sustainable and efficient conservation of our precious water resources through investments in innovative projects.</p>
<p>The National Water Commission, an independent statutory body in my portfolio charged with driving the national reform agenda and administering the Australian Government's Water Smart Australia Programme, called for a further round of water projects on World Water Day.  I encourage all organisations that can contribute innovative, on-ground, water conservation solutions that will generate substantial improvements in water resource management, water supply, the efficient use of water or improve the health of our rivers and water quality to contact the National Water Commission on (02) 6102 6088 to obtain further information on the Australian Government's Water Fund.  Information is also available on the National Water Commission website at <a href="http://www.nwc.gov.au">www.nwc.gov.au</a>.  </p>
