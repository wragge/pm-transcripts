FOR MEDIA 18 May 1984<br />
Plans to stage the first Australia Games in Melbourne next<br />
January were announced jointly today by the Prime Minister,<br />
. Mr Bob Hawke, and the Premier of Victoria, Mr. John Cain.<br />
The Games are expected to cost just over $ 2 million.<br />
Mr. Hawke said the Australian Government, in honouring its<br />
1983 election commitment, would provide $ 800,000 and the<br />
Victorian Government had agreed to a grant of $ 375,000.<br />
balance of the funds would be raised by the Australia<br />
. Games Foundation f rom marketing and television sponsorship.<br />
The 1985 Australia Gamnes will coincide with Victoria' s-<br />
150th birthday celebrations.<br />
N' Mr. Hawke said the Australia Gamnes would provide a much needed<br />
national focus for sport in Australia and facilitate regular<br />
high-level competition for Australia's top athletes in their<br />
own country.<br />
He said the Games would act as the major catalyst in<br />
promoting the benefits of increased participation and<br />
involvement in sport and would encourage States to upgrade and<br />
provide sporting facilities of international standard.<br />
The valuable experience gained from staging the Australia<br />
Games would improve Australia's chances of hosting other<br />
major international sporting events.<br />
Mr. Hawke said he hoped other States would follow Victoria's<br />
lead and offer to stage the Games in future years, with a<br />
m uajor effort in 1988, the bicentennial year. z </p>
