COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF IN QUEENSLAND<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 5 May 1970]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-Honourable members are<br />
aware that the State of Queensland has been<br />
affected by serious drought conditions for<br />
several years. They will also be aware that<br />
the Commonwealth has been providing substantial<br />
drought relief -assistance. Under<br />
present arrangements, the Commonwealth<br />
has agreed for 1969-70 to meet on a $ 1 for<br />
$ 1 basis expenditure on eligible drought<br />
relief measures up to $ 4m and to meet the<br />
full cost in excess of $ 4m, and it is currently<br />
estimated that the Commonwealth<br />
will need to provide some $ l5m under these<br />
arrangements in 1969-70. That would bring<br />
total Commonwealth drought relief assistance<br />
to Queensland since 1965-66 to over<br />
$ 32m. Honourable members will also know<br />
that the Premier of Queensland recently<br />
proposed certain modifications of existing<br />
relief measures. Following Cabinet consideration<br />
of the Premier's proposals, I have<br />
now informed the Premier that the Commonwealth<br />
is prepared to reimburse the<br />
State for carry-on and re-stocking loans<br />
made to graziers to enable Queensland to<br />
extend the existing limits on those loans.<br />
The Commonwealth has always adopted<br />
a flexible attitude to the limits of drought<br />
loans. Our main concern has been that<br />
normal commercial sources of finance<br />
should first be exhausted and that in making<br />
a loan the State authorities should satisfy<br />
-themselves that the applicant has a reasonable<br />
chance of recovery. It will be for the<br />
156811~ 70 State to determine the new limits, and the<br />
rate of monthly payments of loans, in the<br />
light of the circumstances of individual<br />
graziers. I have also informed the Premier<br />
that the Commonwealth is agreeable to his<br />
proposal for graziers who have received<br />
drought relief carry-on or re-stocking loans<br />
under the 1969 drought relief arrangements<br />
to have their loans, including any unpaid<br />
sums under the earlier 1965 arrangements,<br />
consolidated as at 30th June 1970. 1 understand<br />
that the State's objective is to give<br />
further relief to graziers by extending the<br />
period during which interest will be<br />
capitalised and no redemption payments<br />
will be required.<br />
The Commonwealth has also agreed that<br />
rebates on the transport of stock for restocking<br />
purposes, which at present apply<br />
only to breeding stock, should be extended<br />
to cover all stock transported for re-stocking<br />
up to a property's normal capacitywhether<br />
this involves stock purchased or<br />
stock returning from agistment-provided<br />
that the stock are held for a minimum<br />
period on the ' grazier's property before<br />
being elfigible for rebate. In addition, because<br />
of the widespread effects of the drought<br />
on Queensland pastoral areas and the fact<br />
that New South Wales could be a major<br />
source of stock for re-stocking when the<br />
drought is over, the Commonwealth has<br />
indicated its willingness to reimburse the<br />
Queensland Government for expenditure<br />
on freight rebates on stock purchases in </p>
<p>New South Wales for re-stocking and on<br />
returning from agistment in that State.<br />
The existing measures provide for additional<br />
carry-on loans to assist droughtaffected<br />
graziers with the payment of crown<br />
rentals and local authority rates in 1969-<br />
We have now agreed to further assistance<br />
in this regard in the form of grants<br />
to the State to enable it to meet half the<br />
cost of rates payable in 1970 by graziers<br />
who have experienced drought for more<br />
than 2 years in the 2 droughts of 1965-67<br />
and 1969-70 and who are demonstrably in<br />
need of such assistance. Even before allowing for the additional<br />
cost in 1969-70 of the agreed extensions<br />
to drought relief measures to which I have<br />
referred, the Commonwealth contribution<br />
towards drought relief measures in Queensland<br />
this year would be easily the largest<br />
amount ever provided to any State for<br />
drought relief in a single year. The Government<br />
believes that the additional measures<br />
which I have now announced will make a<br />
further substantial contribution to the relief<br />
of those farmers and graziers in Queensland<br />
who continue to be affected by<br />
drought.<br />
