    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that housing and health conditions in remote</p>
<p> indigenous communities are to be improved with a doubling in funding</p>
<p> for the successful ATSIC/Army project.</p>
<p>The scheme has been an outstanding success in the communities that</p>
<p> have so far received assistance.</p>
<p>Army personnel are involved in building housing, roads and airstrips</p>
<p> while also reducing the risk of disease by constructing drainage and</p>
<p> sewerage facilities. Rubbish tips are also being provided to improve</p>
<p> sanitary conditions.</p>
<p>The scheme initially involved $10 million in funding, provided equally</p>
<p> by the Department of Health and Family Services and the Aboriginal</p>
<p> and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Family Services will contribute another</p>
<p> $5 million towards the project while ATSIC is being invited to contribute</p>
<p> the same amount.</p>
<p>I witnessed first-hand the success of the scheme during a visit to</p>
<p> Elcho Island earlier this year.</p>
<p>Of the first seven initial projects, four are located in the Northern</p>
<p> Territory, and one each in Queensland, South Australia and Western</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>Work will shortly begin on identifying additional remote needy communities</p>
<p> for assistance.</p>
<p>Emphasis will again be on providing Army personnel and equipment who</p>
<p> can train local people to maintain the improved infrastructure facilities,</p>
<p> so that the value of the asset will be preserved, and the benefits</p>
<p> of improved health will be sustained.</p>
<p>Today's announcement is in keeping with my Government's</p>
<p> determination to improve health, housing and education facilities</p>
<p> for indigenous Australians, to address the severe socio-economic disadvantage</p>
<p> they suffer.</p>
<p>In addition we will spend a further $15 million under the Government's</p>
<p> Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives programme to improve education</p>
<p> standards for indigenous children.</p>
<p>We will concentrate spending on practical measures such as providing</p>
<p> school buses, houses for teachers, new computers and a range of literacy</p>
<p> and other curriculum programs (projects attached).</p>
<p>In 1998-99 $168 million will be spent on indigenous-specific health</p>
<p> programmes, representing a real increase of 37 per cent since 1995-96.</p>
<p>Extra funding was provided in the 1996-97 Budget over three years</p>
<p> for the establishment of 35 new or expanded health services, with</p>
<p> priority given to rural and remote communities.</p>
<p>In addition $387 million will be spent in 1998-99 on indigenous-specific</p>
<p> housing and infrastructure programmes.</p>
