Each year, Commonwealth Day provides an opportunity to highlight the</p>
<p> valuable role the Commonwealth continues to play in bringing together</p>
<p> nations across the globe. The theme for this year's Commonwealth</p>
<p> Day, Sport Brings Us Together, is very appropriate.</p>
<p>  Sport is an investment in the future - not just in tomorrow's</p>
<p> athletes but in ensuring all our young people get the social, health</p>
<p> and economic benefits from participating in sports. As nations we</p>
<p> gain from the sense of identity and social cohesion that sport can</p>
<p> foster.</p>
<p>  The Commonwealth has a proud tradition in sport - at the elite level</p>
<p> and as part of its community development work. As a strong sporting</p>
<p> nation, Australia has long been an active supporter of Commonwealth</p>
<p> sport - and is the Commonwealth's major sports donor.</p>
<p>  At last year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh,</p>
<p> I pledged a package of assistance worth over $1 million per year to</p>
<p> ensure Commonwealth sport continues to prosper.</p>
<p>  We are extending the highly successful Protea Sport programme in South</p>
<p> Africa which assists community development and reconciliation in townships.</p>
<p> We have extended support for junior sports development in the Caribbean.</p>
<p> In the South Pacific, we have a programme designed to enable the region</p>
<p> to take advantage of Sydney's hosting of the 2000 Olympics. Subject</p>
<p> to a positive review, the programme will be extended to 2006.</p>
<p>  In a year when the region is facing significant challenges, the 1998</p>
<p> Commonwealth Games will bring us together in the Malaysian capital</p>
<p> of Kuala Lumpur. I have no doubt the games will be a great success</p>
<p> and help the process of restoring confidence.</p>
<p>  Australia's commitment to ensuring the Commonwealth Games remains</p>
<p> a competition of international stature and wide interest is reflected</p>
<p> in Melbourne's bid to host the 2006 Games. World class facilities</p>
<p> and the strong public support for sport in Melbourne will enhance</p>
<p> the Games' status and profile.</p>
