AID FOR KARACHI WATER SUPPLY<br />
Australia is to give aid worth $ 250,000<br />
Stowards the maintenance and expansion of the Karachi<br />
water supply.<br />
SAnnouncing this today, the Minister Assisting<br />
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, said<br />
tie aid would be in the form of new equipment for the<br />
factory where concrete pipes are made for the city's<br />
water supply. It would also provide for an Australian<br />
Sexpert to spend several months in Pakistan to supervise<br />
the installation of the new equipment.<br />
SThe pipe-making factory and its existing equipment,<br />
made by Rocla Industries of Victoria, were given<br />
to Pakistan by Australia under the Colombo Plan in the<br />
early 1950' s.<br />
The Karachi water supply was built between<br />
1960 and 1964 and the Australian equipment has been used<br />
to provide pipes for the system of canals, mains, tunnels<br />
and siphons which carry water to Karachi from the Indus<br />
River seventy miles away.<br />
The new equipment will be used to make pipes<br />
to replace corroded sections of the existing lines and to<br />
extend the reticulation system to meet the needs of Karachi's<br />
growing population. </p>
