PRIME MISNIATEA<br />
FOR PRESS 25 OCTOBER 1978<br />
AUSTRALIAN BALLET DEVELOPMENT FUND<br />
The Prime Minister announced today it had been decided that<br />
contributions by the State of Victoria to the Australian<br />
Ballet Development Fund would now qualify for matching<br />
contributions by the Commonwealth.<br />
When the original announcement of Commonwealth support for the<br />
Fund was made, the Government offered to contribute up to<br />
$ 500,000 to the Australian Ballet Development Fund on the<br />
basis of $ 1 for each $ 1 contributed by State Governments<br />
other than Victoria. This decision was taken as an inducement<br />
to the other States to contribute to the Fund and because<br />
of the substantial benefits which Victoria would derive from<br />
having the Ballet centred in Melbourne.<br />
Following representations on the matter, the Commonwealth has<br />
decided to include contributions from Victoria within the<br />
matching subsidy arrangements. This will apply if<br />
contributions to the Fund by the other States do not total<br />
$ 500,000. However, the maximum Commonwealth contribution<br />
of $ 500,000 will remain unaltered.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Government hoped the revised<br />
funding arrangements would help ensure rapid progress in<br />
building suitable headquarters for the Australian Ballet<br />
and the Australian Ballet School. 000---</p>
