TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF MANUFACTURING PLANT OF MERCK SHARPE AND<br />
DOHIVE PTY LTD, SOUTH GRANVILLE, SYDNEY, 23 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much Paul Bell, Managing Director of MSD, Jim Beattie, Lee<br />
Ausbumr, Lesley Russell, Jim Gazilas, other distinguished members of the<br />
management and ladies and gentlemen the employees of Merck, Sharpe and<br />
Dohmo Australia.<br />
It Is a great pleasure for me to be Involved with this. Not simply because it is so<br />
proximate to my awn constituency here in Sydney and part of the general area<br />
of Sydney where I am from and which I have represented now in the House of<br />
Representatives for over a quarter of a century, but more particularly what has<br />
happened here and is happening here is the very essence of what I have been<br />
seeking to do and trying to bring about In the House of Representatives, In the<br />
Government over the last 12 years.<br />
I think It is entirely true, as Paul Bell said, there was a time when the investment<br />
in this business had ceased and It was to be, as he put It, ' mothballed' or run<br />
down and where it would soon be merchandising or wholesaling, distributing<br />
products made by other arms of the company abroad. And, to see such a<br />
change from that to one where we are seeing a very large Investment, a world<br />
class production facility and packaging facility and distribution and a very strong<br />
change and commitment on the part of the employees to the business is the<br />
kind ol model that Australia needs and the model which will, of course, change<br />
our industriaJ culture and Improve our levels of wealth, our capacity to employ<br />
people. their rates of pay and, of course, our relationship with the rest of the<br />
world. I was partIcularly pleased In the briefing I had a few moments ago to see<br />
that exports had risen to about $ 125 million a year now, rising towards a<br />
forecaint $ 250 million a year In a few years from now from virtually nothing not<br />
that long ago. And, it Is part of that sea change in Australia looking out rather<br />
than looking in. </p>
<p>Now, what has obviously happened here is that there was a real conversation<br />
betwee3n this industry the pharmaceutical Industry and the Government in<br />
the 1 SSOs and, I think, Governments have got to make key decisions about<br />
whether they want particular industries or whether they don't, what they can do<br />
to try mnd make the environment more conducive to them staying and investing.<br />
And, In a major policy change in the 1980s across a range of areas, we<br />
improved the atmospherics for the pharmaceutical industry in Australia. I<br />
suppose the most well understood part of that by those people In the Industry<br />
and probably members of the public is the factor Tf scheme which was one of<br />
the things which underpinned the future of the industry.<br />
Now, governments can do those things, but if companies don't take them up<br />
well, riot much Is likely to happen. But, I think, that at Merck, Sharpe and<br />
Dohme they have seen a willingness on the part of the Government to say ' yes,<br />
we want this Industry and it can make a contribution to our national product and<br />
to our exports' and the company said ' in that case, we will see what we can do,<br />
get a strategic plan together, a corporate plan and make some Investments and<br />
try to make it all happen.' As a consequence we have seen this very large<br />
investment here $ 75 million the most modem developments in the<br />
production of pharmaceutical products and what I can see around the plant,<br />
tremendous camaraderie and esprit de corp between all of you who work for the<br />
business and those who manage it.<br />
I suppose, this Is part of the sea change in Australia too. It is no accident that<br />
we have an Inflation rate of just under 2 per cent. That Is there because of cooperation<br />
from the workplace and because of some wisdom on the part of<br />
employers not seeking to charge what the market will bear. These things have<br />
changed the culture of industrial relations in Australia and there Is a commitment<br />
and I hear Paul Bell say about a number of unions committing themselves to the<br />
business here. I think there were 13 originally, there are now five and there has<br />
been that commitment and, I think, when one looks at a lot of other societies<br />
which have succeeded in production and in exports and probably Japan<br />
obviouIsly comeS to mind, the management of great companies in that country<br />
always seem to get this conducive relationship with the workforce. I suppose<br />
this Is one of the points of difference we have with the Coalition in this country.<br />
We say let's get people committed in a group way, to group objectives and let's<br />
all travel In the same direction together rather than singling people off for<br />
Individual wage contracts. If they pipe up they lose their job, If they don't sign<br />
up for particular things they lose their jobs. That is not the environment, I think,<br />
which produces the kind of outcome that you really need In a group sense to<br />
make a business work, that is, a commitment right across the business and not<br />
simply people taking employment contracts out of fear or out of pressure or out<br />
of something else. The way to get the change and to improve the productivity </p>
<p>and the culture of the business Is to get that commitment from the employees<br />
and the management to work together.<br />
I was delighted when I was taken around and just shown parts of the plant to<br />
hear a number of the people demonstrating it to me say ' Well, some of our Ideas<br />
are In there'. In other words good Ideas are appreciated rather than good ideas<br />
being, In a sense, rejected because they haven't come from the top down. I<br />
mean, there has been a sea change in Australian management. There was a<br />
time when the boss saw the workers for a cup of tea and a scone on Christmas<br />
Eve and that was that end of It or a beer maybe, then they charged off and all<br />
came back to their being their grumpy self for the new year. Now, that has<br />
changed and, I think, where ever you see managers enlighten people, who want<br />
a goodJ relationship with their employees, people of good will can get It and, I<br />
think, ' this business proves that too.<br />
I'll just say one thing about the factor P scheme, I have been urged by Paul Bell<br />
to continue to support it and part of the value of coming to a plant like this is to<br />
see it in action. I think, we are providing something like $ 1 billion worth of<br />
assistance and in return 17 companies have committed themselves to<br />
undertake nearly $ 8 billion in additional exports. Now, when one looks at the<br />
nature of the products here, there Is not just the added value and this is the sort<br />
of added value that Australia can use, but there are also products that actually<br />
make you feel good about producing, you are producing something that Is going<br />
to help somebody and you are doing something socially useful as well as<br />
something as productive and economically sensible.<br />
So, this is, In a sense, part of the model that we see for Australia, being driven<br />
by thei thing that Is our great comparative advantage-that is our education<br />
systern. Because if you ask many Australians what Is Australia's comparative<br />
advantage? they will say Well, it Is our minerals or it is our wool', but I would<br />
say It is our education. As you know, 10 years ago only three kids in<br />
completed secondary school, this year it is eight In 10, and we are streaming<br />
per cant of those through universities and we are now building vocational<br />
education to sit beside the universities so that we can have a very high<br />
participation rate in school and a competent tertiary and vocational education<br />
system which will feed businesses of this kind. Then, with our Incentives for<br />
research and development I am delighted that we are actually seeing primary<br />
research in pharmaceuticals undertaken here in Australa and here particularly<br />
by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme.<br />
So, congratulations to the Company. I mean, it Is always a tough task master<br />
being the local subsidiary of an International parent company, singing for your<br />
supper, trying to get a commitment by the international board to capital. It is<br />
one thing committing it yourself, but when you have got to get someone else to<br />
commit it, it is pretty hard and you have got to have a good story to tell and I </p>
<p>4<br />
hope that the story that Paul Bell and his colleagues have been able to tell<br />
Merck In the United States is a story of Australia. The story of a modem,<br />
sophisticated country with a strong base in education, that Is Interested in doing<br />
productive things and doing them well and shipping to the part of the world<br />
where we know we can be very competitive.<br />
So, when you hear the term added value, this is what we mean and you see It In<br />
these modem surroundings. And to see that commitment and, obviously, the<br />
very good will that exists between all of you Is a real pleasure for me Indeed. It<br />
Is with even greater pleasure that I now declare these facilities open and to<br />
draw the curtain on the plaque. Thank you Indeed.<br />
