PRIME INISTE<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING<br />
WORK FOR AUSTRALIA LODGE FUNCTION<br />
I have written to a number of individuals and<br />
organisations who assisted the " Work for Australia" Task<br />
Force, inviting them to an informal gathering at The<br />
Lodge next Sunday.<br />
The task force, initiated by Mr Bill Kelty and Mr Lindsay<br />
Fox,_ was established last year to encourage empl-byers to<br />
take on young Australians and to explore ways of better<br />
co-ordinating employment programs.<br />
I want to take this opportunity to thank those who served<br />
on the task force as well as those from all over<br />
Australia who assisted in its deliberations.<br />
By talking in an informal atmosphere with those involved<br />
I hope to acquaint myself as much as possible with the<br />
ideas which have emerged from their work in the week in<br />
which the Government will receive two major reports on<br />
jobs and regional Australia.<br />
The Government's Discussion Paper Restoring Full<br />
Employment will be delivered on December 15. The<br />
following day the chairman of the Regional Task Force, Mr<br />
Kelty, will deliver his report and I expect many of the<br />
issues raised in that report will be relevant to the<br />
broader task of job c-reation.<br />
The aim of the regional development task force, broadly<br />
speaking, has been to discover how best we can create<br />
jobs and widen opportunity for the people of regional<br />
Australia; how we can strengthen their economies and in<br />
so doing strengthen the national economy; how we can give<br />
the regions of Australia a stake in Australia's future.<br />
The function at The Lodge will be a unique opportunity to<br />
discuss with a wide range of dedicated individuals the<br />
issue which will be the primary focus of Government<br />
attention and policy in the New Year.<br />
