28 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
FOLLOWING PREMIERS' MEETING ON NATIVE TITLE<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, can I first say on the anniversary of the Port Arthur tragedy on<br />
the 28th of April last year, naturally the thoughts of the entire nation are very much<br />
with those people who were left devastated by that unm-itigated tragedy, for the<br />
commnunity around Port Arthur and more generally for the people of Tasmania.<br />
Memorials have been built to all those who died. Collectively as a nation the greatest<br />
memorial to those who lost their lives so tragically and so unwillingly on the 28th of<br />
April last year, perhaps the greatest memorial for them would be a renewed<br />
determaination by all of the Australian people to shun all forms of violence within our<br />
midst, whether it is violence in the home, violence against the more vulnerable in our<br />
community including women and children and violence on the playing field, violence in<br />
the pub, violence in any walk of life and if there could be a collective resolve by the<br />
Austalian community to forsake the culture of violence within our midst it would be a<br />
more fitting memorial than any I can conceive to those people who died in such tragic<br />
circumstances a year ago this afternoon.<br />
I might mention, ladies and gentlemen, that so far under the gun buy back campaign,<br />
the campaign that's been under way now for some time, that 383 175 firearms have<br />
been handed in, that over $ 190 million has been paid out in compensation. In Victoria,<br />
the largest number of guns has been handed in and that is 164 000 with about $ 77<br />
million handed out in compensation. That process is of course still going on.<br />
We had a meeting of Premiers this morning that meeting has now ended to discuss<br />
the Commonwealth's response to the decision of the High Court in the decision of the<br />
Wik case. It was a good meeting. Progress was made. It was conducted in a very<br />
positive and constructive atmosphere in which everybody recognised that this was a<br />
particularly difficult issue. There is a desire to find a solution that delivers, certainty to<br />
the pastoral community of Australia which that community is entitled to have and was<br />
28V04/ 97 17: 43 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from 28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 Pg: 2<br />
entitled to expect at all times but also to respect the existence of native title and to<br />
deliver a just outcome for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
There was a detailed discussion about the Commonwealth's ten point plan. What I<br />
intend to do now is to discuss that plan with the members of the Governmnent<br />
Backbench Commnittee and subject to approval through the due processes of the<br />
Government I would propose at an early date to draft legislation to give effect to that<br />
ten point plan and that legislation will of course be drafted in close consultation with<br />
the states because it intimately involves the use of state mechanisms. I will also closely<br />
consult the Aboriginal people regarding the drafing of that legislation and I, and my<br />
officials, will hold further talks with indigenous representatives over the next couple of<br />
weeks. It is fair to say that some of the states still have some reservations. It is also fair to say<br />
that there was a recognition today that the plan I put forward went a long way towards<br />
meeting the legitimate concerns of the pastoral community. As far as I am concerned,<br />
at all times I have been interested in achieving a practical, workable outcome. I am<br />
interested in practical solutions, not rhetorical mirages. The proposal I have put<br />
forward is one that ought to be supported by the Parliament. It removes in my view all<br />
of the reasonable concerns of the pastoral community of Australia. Importantly, it will<br />
allow any pastoral leaseholder in this country to carry on all of the activities defined as<br />
pnimary production in the Income Tax Act, and that is a very wide definition indeed,<br />
they always are in the Tax Act, and that of course goes far beyond pastoral activities<br />
that are customarily sanctioned under pastoral leases and those activities will be able to<br />
be carried on without any let or hindrance from either native title claimants or indeed<br />
any other section of the Australian community.<br />
It's a fair outcome because it guarantees that titleholders, whether they are indigenous<br />
titleholders or other titleholders, will be treated in a completely fair and equal fashion.<br />
There will be no detrimental treatment of one group in the community compared with<br />
another. There were some concerns raised by the States today regarding one or two<br />
aspects of the package. Some of those concerns were reasonable. Others in my view,<br />
on Anrther examination are probably not reasonable objections. I will discuss again the<br />
whole package with the indigenous corrununity. I remain hopefual that it is a package<br />
that can get the broad assent of the major stakeholders. In the end of course the<br />
Government has to decide, has the responsibility of deciding what path it is going to go<br />
down. I am convinced that the ten point plan of mtind is the fairest, best, most<br />
practicable way of delivering certainty and security to firmners and justice to the<br />
Aboriginal community.<br />
There are many features of extinguishmnent which I don't think people have properly<br />
understood. Extinguishment may look a simple, eas option. It has a number of<br />
drawbacks. One of them is the potential cost of the compensation involved. It could<br />
deliver an enormous deal to the Australian taxpayer. I have no idea what it would run<br />
into but if you extinguished all native title in one sweep over every pastoral leasehold<br />
in Australia, the potential of that is very high indeed. I am unconvinced that sucb<br />
action would be completely immune from Hfigh Court challenge. Any extinguishment<br />
of native title, so I am told, would have to take place using the race power of the<br />
Commonwealth Constitution. The Hfigh Court is currently constituted, it could well </p>
<p>Fax from 28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 Pg: 3<br />
decided that the race power as currently phrased does not support a detrimental act in<br />
relation to one particular race within the Australian community. To effectively<br />
extinguish native title the Government would have to pass legislation which<br />
extinguished the title rights alone of one section of the Australian community. That<br />
has political implications and I guess philosophical implications as well as the other<br />
implications that are mentioned.<br />
Now, I can't rule out any options at the end of the road in relation to this very difficult<br />
issue. I clearly believe that my model is the better way, the fairer way, the way more<br />
likely to deliver an early sense of security and stability than the alternatives that have<br />
been urged on me.<br />
The Aboriginal community must understand that the Wik decision went far beyond the<br />
expectations of the rest of the Australian community. And indeed if they are<br />
completely candid, their own expectations. It was the general belief of the Australian<br />
community until the High Court brought down its judgment in December of last year<br />
that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished native title. Paul Keating said that, the<br />
recital of the Native Title Act said that, it was acknowledged by Aboriginal leaders, it<br />
was in fact one of the bases of one of the $ 1.5 billion land fund that was established to<br />
compensate people who were not entitled under Mabo to make native title claims.<br />
So) the backdrop of this is that, yes we need an outcome that is fair and respects native<br />
title. We also need an outcome that respects the fact that pastoralists are entitled to<br />
feel cheated by the Wik decision, The value of my approach is that it balances that<br />
sense on their part which I think is legitimate with the desire on my part to respect the<br />
existence of native title. And I think what the 10 point plan does is to recognise these<br />
competing interests and that is why I think it is the approach that overwhelmingly<br />
deserves the support of the Australian community and that is why I have put it<br />
forward. Are their any questions?<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Borbidge has just said that on his understanding of today's meeting it is only<br />
Queensland that is now holding out against your ten point plan. Is that your<br />
understanding? PRIM MNISTER:<br />
WeIl I don't know what he said publicly. I understand the feeling in Queensland and I<br />
have to said to Queenslanders, my plan will give you security.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard did you compromise at all on your ten point plan in the meeting and if so<br />
in what areas? 3 </p>
<p>Faxf rm : 28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 PS: 4<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not on major principles, anymore than in talking to the Aboriginal community did I<br />
comnpromse on major principles. I haven't put this forward as some kind of ambit<br />
claim. I spent an enormous amount of time and energy thinking about this issue and<br />
I've developed this plan which I think gives to pastoralists in Quleensland and<br />
elsewhere complete security, without offending the basic principles of native title, and<br />
that's an important balance to be struck in the Australian community.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the states have to pick up any compensation that may come from their activity or<br />
their.. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Compensation was raised and we have agreed to get some advice on how it might<br />
operate and I've said that I don't expect the States to pick up all of the compensation<br />
but equally I'm not prepared to write a blank cheque for the Conunonwealth to pick it<br />
up either. It's a question of probably sharing it in proportions yet to be determined.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you expect the land fund to be used for that purpose?<br />
PRIME MINISTER**<br />
I want to have a look again at the circumstances under which the land fund was<br />
established. I don't want to make a statement on the run in relation to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, you to predict even in the broadest terms the extent to which Common<br />
law native title rights and pastoral leases could co-exist in practice under your plan.<br />
Will there be a broad ability for a common law right to Native Title...-<br />
PRIME AMISTER:<br />
W1ll there be a what?<br />
JOURNALIST: Will they have them on a broad basis in Australia. Will there be a broad ability for coexistence<br />
of those two rights?<br />
PRIM MIMLTER;<br />
I'm not quite sume I understand, I'm not being offensive, Im quite sure I understand<br />
your point. </p>
<p>Fax from : 28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 Pg:<br />
JOURNALIST: The point is your plan has been called in some quarters effective extinguishment that<br />
it sets the hurdles so high that there wouldn't be in practice much of a chance for a<br />
common law native title right to...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there's nothing under my plan that prevents people demonstrating establishing<br />
native title, but what my plan does do is to guarantee that a pastoralist can get on with<br />
his business and guarantee that somebody can run and manage their pastoral property<br />
which they have been doing for decades and that is the objective that they have.<br />
JOURNALIST: But in forming the plan did you envisage that there would be co-existing native title<br />
rights in very many circumstances?<br />
PRIME MINISTER,<br />
Well, I can envisage some circumstances in which current co-existence arrangements<br />
continue. As I understand the way the amendments would operate, if you don't now<br />
have some kind of physical connection with the land your chances of establishing<br />
native title even under some interpretations of the current native title act, your chances<br />
wouldn't be all that great.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you explain the impact of your plan on the current right to negotiate process in<br />
relation to development on pastoral leases e~ g mining?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;-<br />
Well it significantly alters the right to negotiate and I don't apologise for that. The<br />
existing right to negotiate has constituted a very very significant brake on economic<br />
development in this country and changes to the right to negotiate were needed even<br />
before the Wik decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: How long ago did you decide that legislative extinguishment was not on? At what<br />
stge in t proess?<br />
PRIME MMlTER:<br />
Well I haven't said that. I'm just. pointing out that my approach is superior for the<br />
reasons that I've enumerated, but I've said before I concluded my opening remarks,<br />
but I haven't completely ruled out extinguishment, I'm just explfining to you that it is </p>
<p>28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 Pg: 6<br />
a bit of mirage to imagine that the lure of extinguishment is going to deliver a better<br />
result than what I've put forward. See what I'm putting forward is more likely to be<br />
delivered earlier than extinguishment. It does respect the principle of native title, it<br />
does deliver security to pastoralists and therefore I think it is much better. I mean, I<br />
amr backing it because it is better. It's better for pastoralsts, it is better for Aborigines,<br />
and it is better for the whole community and that's why I'm backing it, it is as simple<br />
as that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why are you not ruling out extinguishment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you never rule out anything until you get to the last moment,<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this contingent upon what happens in the Senate?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Look I'm just simply saying to you I don't rule it out but my preference is very very<br />
clear. JOURNALIST: What would actually force you to again look at the extinguishment option?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Hypothetical. JOURINALIST: and possibly accepting...<br />
PRVIME MINISTER:<br />
Hypothetical and I'm not answering<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the cost to the revenue Mr Howard of this extension of the definition of<br />
pastoral activities to the income tax definition? 6<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fa rom28/ 84/ 97 17: 43 Pg: 7<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It'll have no impact. It doesn't effect your assessable income. It effects your capacity<br />
to do things without having to get the permission of native title claimants.<br />
JOURNALIST: Surely you must have some on the definition of what you are doing on the property.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. It might enhance it, but it won't be to its detriment. Catherine Job.<br />
JOURNALIST: Thank you. Do you expect to get Mr Borbidge's agreement in the long run or in the<br />
end will you have to go ahead without Queensland's agreement and can you?<br />
PR] ME MINISTER:<br />
I will continue to talk on a regular basis to Mr Borbidge and I believe that<br />
Queenslanders will see that my plan gives them the certainty they think extinguishment<br />
will deliver without some of the costs. That's why they ought to support it. I mean, I<br />
would say to all Queensland pastoralists, the security you want can be delivered under<br />
my plan. My plan has advantages which the alternatives don't.<br />
JOURNALIST: To what extent does your plan, without extinguishing Native Title, raise the prospect<br />
of compensation..<br />
PR3M NIOSTER:<br />
Compensation has got to be payable, no matter what happens. We understand that. I<br />
mean people have got to understand a few simple things about this issue and that is<br />
that once the courts of Australia have found that a common law title right exists, if that<br />
title is in any way resumed or extinguished by direct legislative or executive act or by<br />
operation of law, then some compensation properly assessed is payable, and nobody<br />
has disputed that. At no stage through the whole of this debate has there been any<br />
denia by any of the Premiers or any denial by the Commonwealth about the fact that<br />
compensation is payable. I mean this idea that you can sort of snuffle out a title and<br />
not pay anything is just not on. You can't do that. And that applies whether you<br />
extinguish or you do something else. Now, why therefore wouldn't you go down the<br />
path that I'm advocating. It's far more sensible. It's more likely in a praetical sense to<br />
achieve the result that you want. But I mean, let's fiace it, the court has said that title<br />
xists and absent some kind of retrospective amendment to the constitution, you can't<br />
take that away. 7.<br />

JOURNALIST: What's your best estimate on how much it will cost...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have no idea, and this is one of the difficulties of this. I have no idea. Nobody has<br />
any idea. It could be big, it could end up being small. I don't know.<br />
Could you also tell us whether your 10 point plan means any over-riding of the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
As I'm advised at the present time, my 10 point plan is RDA compatible, I think is the<br />
language, or RDA consistent, or RDA sensitive. I think RDA compatible, but I have<br />
said that I would not be reluctant to amend the Racial Discrimination Act in some<br />
relevantly minor way if that were necessary to facilitate a settlement of this issue.<br />
Remember that Keating did that, and there's nothing sacrosanct about the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act, There is something sacrosanct about racial equality, but not the<br />
Act which for the time being you express that aspiration through.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister at what stage do you intend to begin negotiating with the other parties<br />
in the Senate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've been negotiating with them. I mean for example I spent four hours with the<br />
President of the National Farmers Federation yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the Senate.<br />
PRIME MINISNTER.-<br />
In the Senate?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes. The Labor Party, the Greens, the Democrats. 20/ 04/ 97 17: 43 P9: 8 </p>
<p>Fa rom28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 PS: 9<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well TVr Carr was there today. He's the most successful Labor man in Australia at the<br />
moment isn't he?<br />
JOURNALIST:-Well given that Premier Borbidge says that one of the points you made to him last<br />
Thursday was the difficulty of getting extinguishment through the Senate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will be talking to the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party after I've<br />
spoken to my own party room about the matter. The normal thing is you talk to the<br />
Premiers, you talk to the<br />
JOURNALIST: But before the legislation is written?<br />
PRIME. MINISTER:<br />
I'd be happy to talk to them. I think I'd probably be happy to talk to them before the<br />
legislation is written although I notice that last night my opposite number said that<br />
what I had to do was produce a piece of legislation.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the time-framne?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:.<br />
As soon as possible, I think the time . We've had a lot of discussion. We've had<br />
an enormous amount of negotiation and an enormous amount of rhetoric, and I want<br />
as quickly as possible, subject to due processes, I want as quickly as possible to get a<br />
bit of legislation on the table that conforms with the 10 principles so that people can<br />
have a look at it and see if they're satisfied. I don't expect anybody to sign off on this<br />
thing completely until they've seen the final form of the legislation.<br />
JOVRNALIST: Would you like to outline for us what the 10 points are Mr Howard. We've been<br />
having this very long debate about it, but we've never actually heard you describe what<br />
the 10 point plan is.<br />
PRIME MV1STER.-<br />
Weil if I can remember all of thm and 10 is a lot to remember, the first one consists<br />
and one of my helpers who is here might give me a copy while I talk Grahame? The<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fa rom28/ 04/ 97 17: 43 Pg:<br />
first one says that you validate everything that's been issued between the first of<br />
January 1994 and the 23rd of December 1996, that was the date of the Wik decision.<br />
The second principle is that you confirm that Native Title has been extinguished by<br />
what I've called exclusive tenures. And that is freehold, commercial and residential<br />
and certain agricultural leases, where quite clearly it was the intent when the<br />
instruiment was granted, or the deed was made by the Crown that there should be<br />
exclusive possession then obviously they should be extinguished. That is in line with<br />
the law. And then there's a provision in relation to towns and cities and municipal<br />
services. This is very technical and complicated Laura don't you want a copy of it<br />
instead? JOURNALISTS: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We can probably get one out to you firly soon. I've just got to get a few things<br />
cleaned up and then we'll get it out to you.<br />
JOURNALIST; In the meantime, if your 10 point plan is in fact accepted, what impact will it have on<br />
the hundreds and thousands the several hundred claims that are already in before the<br />
Native Title Tribunal.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Those claims will be dealt with in accordance with the amendments that are already in<br />
the Parliament. And those amendments require a tougher registration test and under<br />
those amendments whenever the right to negotiate is triggered, in relation to any of<br />
those claim, then the claim will have to run the gauntlet of the tougher registration<br />
test. But that's already provided for in the bill that Senator Minchin has so ably got<br />
into the Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: So this 10 point plan<br />
PRIME MINITER:<br />
This 10 point plan is consistent with those amendments. It doesn't over-ride it, it is<br />
consistent and compatible with those amendments.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given Mr Borbidge's position today, what do you expect will be the<br />
reaction of the Federal Queensland National Party members who have been so vocal in<br />
their calls for Bill extinguishment. ' 1-<br />

PRIMAE MINSTER.:<br />
I believe that when everybody hears my plan and understands it, I don't believe that<br />
any reasonable person could doubt that this is the best way to go.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, does that mean you believe you can hold all your numbers in the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh Michelle let's not start talking about votes in the Senate.<br />
JOURNALIST: They're pretty important.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well yeah, but it's the other ones I want.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Howard, given the aboriginal negotiators concerns about your right to negotiate<br />
and your threshold test under your 10 point plan, what makes you think that they<br />
won't drag it back into the courts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER-.<br />
Well nobody, no matter what you do in this, can be accompanied by a guarantee that<br />
people won't take you to court. No matter what you do.<br />
JOURNALIST: They so that goes right to the heart of the issue.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not quite sure about the logic of that proposition. There's no way that you<br />
can ever deliver any kind of change in this area that is immune to a court challenge. I<br />
mean you can't in our kind of society say that people can never go to court. I believe<br />
that my approach is less vulnerable to court challenge than any alternative.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister will you proceed to legislate whether or not you get Queensland on<br />
board at the end of the day?<br />

PRIME MIISE<br />
Oh let's not take it beyond what I've said. I intend to do what I've said I'm going to<br />
do and I am hopeflul that I will have widespread support in the Party.<br />
JOUR~ NALIST;<br />
And you can do it without Queensland being on board?<br />
PRIME NI4STER:<br />
I believe that I'll have widespread support in the Party for what I am proposing to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) Senate parties, the ALP and the Democrats, would you consider<br />
amendments to your plan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER. L<br />
I won't consider amendments that alter the principles of the 10 point plan, no. But<br />
people must understand that this is not an ambit claim. I'm not asking people to<br />
accept it sight unseen. But people should understand that I'm not putting forward this<br />
plan to have it hacked away by some kind of Senate committee. I'm putting it forward<br />
because I think it is a bona fide compromise. Obviously if people have got<br />
amendments that don't violate the principles of the plan then we'll have a look at those,<br />
of course we will.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you meet Mr Hashimoto this evening, will you be pressing Australia's position<br />
of opposition to binding global greenhouse reduction targets. And will you be citing<br />
the latest ABARE studies on the economic impacts on Australia and also a study of the<br />
impacts on Japan?<br />
] PRIME MINISTER:'<br />
Yes yes. I think consideration surrounding the climate change imposed one of the<br />
more significant medium term economic threats to this country that we have had for a<br />
long time. This is a situation where Australia is atypical. Australia is a highly<br />
developed net exporter of energy. There are few other countries in the world that have<br />
the same description as that. Our interests in this area are very different from those of<br />
the United States and the European Union. We should never have got aboard this<br />
particular truck in the first place at the Rio Conference, and those that put us aboard<br />
t truck didn't understand the national interest. And the economic implications of<br />
remaining on that truck are quite serious for Australia. I will push the principle of<br />
differentiation on every available occasion before every available world leader in evety<br />
forum that I can find. Because this is very much a case of Australia alone having to<br />
.12 </p>
<p>Fax from stick up for Australian interests and we shouldn't mince any words about it or doubt<br />
the serious threat that adoption of this poses to Australia's economic flhture.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard do you think there's the possibility of a double dissolution in some of your<br />
talks with the stakeholders if you couldn't get you plan through the Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I think in these sorts of discussions the full gamnut of political possibilities is always<br />
canvassed, JOURNA~ IST:<br />
So that is a possibility?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the answer is the answer I've just given.<br />
JOURNALIST: You expressed the hope at the start of the conference, that Australia might foresake<br />
the culture of violence as part of the Port Arthur legacy. How optimistic are you<br />
about that, and I know you've already done we've had the gun reforms and you've<br />
done a number of things on violence on the screen. Do you have any more thoughts<br />
on how the government can take a lead in that ( inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think all governments can continue to do as much as they can in relation to<br />
domestic violence. I have to say I take some exception to the comments made by Mrs<br />
Fay Lo Po at the weekend regarding our approach to domestic violence. We in fact<br />
put more resource into progranmmes combating domestic violence than the previous<br />
government. I'm not poking a stick at the previous government but her attack was<br />
quite wrong and quite ignorant. We are very strongly committed to effective programs<br />
to combat domestic violence but it really lies very much in educating children from a<br />
very early age that physical violence is not a solution to argument, not a solution to<br />
dispute. It also means that every possible support should be given to sporting<br />
organisations who seek to stamp out violence on the field. And I applaud the attempts~<br />
of those who administer football in Australia and I applaud their attempts to stamp our<br />
violence on the field. I think it does set an appalling example and it is very Imnportant<br />
that governments voice their support, but it really is not only a question of money and<br />
that was the other mistake that the lady from New South Wales made at the weekend.<br />
She sounded as though she thought money was all you had to provide in order to get<br />
rid of domestic violence. It really involves trying to inculcate within the community an<br />
abhorrence of violence as a solution to diffierences of opinion and disputation between<br />
individuals and that's a very big ask and I'm not suggesting that a Prime Ministerial .; 13<br />
Fa om28/ 84/ 97 17: 43 Pg: 13 </p>
<p>Fax from declaration alone is going to sort of solve the problem. I wouldn't be so presumptuous<br />
to suggest that but I do think we should understand as a community that we too<br />
readily embrace, even if by neglect and indifference, violence is a solution to problems<br />
and it's not just for domestic violence but of course that's one of the more ugly<br />
