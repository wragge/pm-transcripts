PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 364<br />
12 November, 1974<br />
AUSTRALIAN~ AMERICAN FESTIVAL 1976<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced plans<br />
for a nationwide Australian American Festival in 1976. Mr.<br />
Whitlam said he had accepted an invitation to be the joint<br />
patron of the festival with the United States Ambassador to<br />
Australia, Mr. Marshall Green.<br />
The festival would co-incide with celebrations in the<br />
United States to mark the bicentenary' of American independence.<br />
The Sydney program would be held from 27 March to 24<br />
April 1976. No dates had yet been set for the program being<br />
prepared for Melbourne and other capital cities.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Australian American Association<br />
had conceived the idea of a national Australian American<br />
Festival and had received prompt co-operation from many<br />
quarters including cultural groups, sporting bodies, retail<br />
and business houses, art galleries, organisations and trusts<br />
and many prominent citizens.<br />
" The festival will heavily underline the ever-strengthening<br />
bonds that exist between the two nations", Mr. Whitlam said.<br />
" It will comprise three segments Heritage, Festival<br />
and Horizons. The Heritage section will concentrate on the<br />
historical association of Australia and America."<br />
" Displays, art and other exhibitions, special theatrical<br />
and orchestral performances, travel promotions, a street parade<br />
and sporting events will be included in the Festival segment".<br />
Mr. Whitlam, said the Horizons segment would draw attention<br />
to present-day relationships between the two countries and<br />
give an insight into future relationships.<br />
" I commend the Australian American Association for the<br />
part it has played over the years in strengthening the ties<br />
between our countries and initiating the 1976 festival with<br />
which I am honored to be associated," Mr. Whitlamr said.<br />
