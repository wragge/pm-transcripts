PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, lIP<br />
THE INAUGURAL SIR EDWARD " WEARY" DUNLOP ASIALINK LECTURE<br />
MELBOURNE, 8 DECEMBER 1993<br />
It is a great privilege to be asked to deliver this<br />
address I cannot imagine a greater privilege.<br />
" Weary" Dunlop was an Australian of phenomenal<br />
achievement. If his work as a surgeon and teacher were all that<br />
distinguished his life, an annual lecture and much more<br />
to preserve his memory, would be warranted.<br />
If the sole criterion was his contribution as architect<br />
and overseer of schemes for the betterment of his country<br />
and the welfare of its people, he would rank among the<br />
great Australians.<br />
If he was known only as a pioneer of Australia's<br />
friendship with the countries of Asia, we would be<br />
justified in honouring his life's work this way.<br />
Talking about his work in Asia in one of his last<br />
interviews he remarked that he was " a bit ahead of<br />
Keating." I unequivocally dips my lid. It is a galvanising thing<br />
to know that we are, in some way, building on the work of<br />
Weary Dunlop.<br />
Would that we all shared his vision.<br />
Would that we all might have half his courage, half his<br />
reason, half his powers of leadership.<br />
These among others were the qualities which lifted Weary<br />
Dunlop into the ranks of the imnmortals.<br />
In my days at school we read about the epic feats of<br />
Sturt and Eyre and Stuart, the heroic philanthropy of<br />
Caroline Chisholm, the remarkable feats of Mawson in<br />
Antarctica, and the Anzacs at Gallipoli and we wondered<br />
how men and women could be so brave, resourceful and<br />
resilient. These were giants. </p>
<p>We should have also been reading about Weary Dunlop<br />
even so soon after the war we should have been reading<br />
about him.<br />
And our children should be reading about him now.<br />
For to read about Weary Dunlop in World War II, to read<br />
his diaries, to hear him interviewed in the last years of<br />
his life is to hear a story every bit as awe-inspiring<br />
as any in our past. It is perhaps the most inspiring<br />
story in our history.<br />
As many of you probably know, the story began in the<br />
bush. Ernest Edward Dunlop was a son of the soil,<br />
raised at a place called Sheepwash Creek in north-eastern<br />
Victoria. He was educated at State schools in Stewarton<br />
and Benalla, and I would hazard a guess that the heroes<br />
of his basic education were the same as those of my<br />
generation. Gallipoli loomed large. Four members of his family had<br />
gone to the First World War.<br />
The Australia of Dunlop's youth, of course, was very<br />
different. A new nation, Australia looked at the world<br />
through the prism of empire. Our economy, our foreign<br />
relations, our defence were all dependent on Britain.<br />
Our people were overwhelmingly of British and Irish<br />
extraction. This Australia was an outpost of the British empire,<br />
separated from the civilisation we held to be the highest<br />
by what we saw as an amorphous and potentially hostile<br />
mass of humanity to our near north but which we called<br />
the Far East.<br />
" White Australia" kept the potential threat at bay<br />
" White Australia" and the might of the British Empire.<br />
It stood to reason that Australians looked to Britain for<br />
their cultural, if not their spiritual, values. Not<br />
because they were less Australian, it seems to me, but<br />
because to share in the British heritage was one of the<br />
most agreeable things about being Australian.<br />
It conferred considerable advantages on us among them<br />
the chance for young men of promise to further their<br />
education and careers in an agreeably ancient yet<br />
familiar culture.<br />
Weary Dunlop was in London doing post-graduate study when<br />
the Second World War broke out. As he said himself, he<br />
couldn't wait to get into the Army, and somehow he<br />
contrived to this country's everlasting benefit to<br />
get into the Australian Army. </p>
<p>He served in the Australian Army Medical Corps with the<br />
Second AIF in Palestine, Egypt, Greece and Crete.<br />
By the time he sailed for the war in south-east Asia, he<br />
had already experienced more than an average share of<br />
hardship and danger; including service with the Sixth<br />
Australian Division during the siege of Tobruk; and he<br />
had already demonstrated his great physical strength and<br />
his capacity to apply his wonderful skills under<br />
conditions of extreme stress including his skills of<br />
leadership. He arrived in Java in February 1942. Singapore the<br />
bastion of Britain's Far East defences and Australia's<br />
security had fallen to the Japanese. Three weeks<br />
later, Weary Dunlop and his unit were captured at<br />
Bandung. The prisoners very soon were made aware that they were in<br />
the hands of a ruthless enemy. Almost as quickly they<br />
became aware that in Weary Dunlop they had a leader of<br />
equivalent bravery.<br />
As the hospital in Bandung was being broken up and the<br />
sick and wounded forced to march, Dunlop protested,<br />
pointing to one man who, as he described him, was " blind<br />
with a shattered face, amputated hands and a broken leg".<br />
When the Japanese commander indicated to his guard that<br />
the man was to be bayoneted, Weary Dunlop, to use his own<br />
word, " interposed" his body.<br />
In the next three years, Weary Dunlop ceaselessly<br />
" interposed" his body between hope and despair, reason<br />
and insanity, pride and humiliation life and death. He<br />
was the principal reason for the survival of thousands of<br />
men. Enduring the same hardships the illness, the<br />
torture, the terror and squalor he was leader, doctor<br />
and inspiration.<br />
As one of his fellow prisoners wrote later:<br />
When despair and death reached for us, he stood<br />
fast, his only thought our well-being. Faced with<br />
guards who had the power of life and death, ignoble<br />
tyrants who hated us, he was a lighthouse of sanity<br />
in a universe of madness and suffering.<br />
Nothing I can say tonight could possibly describe the<br />
horrors inflicted on Australian, British and allied<br />
prisoners of war on the Burma-Thailand Railway or the<br />
estimated 200,000 labourers from Thailand, Burma,<br />
Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam who were press ganged<br />
into service.<br />
As one who went through it said the survivors often did<br />
not talk about it simply because it was " indescribable". </p>
<p>The best account by far, of course, was written by Weary<br />
himself. The detailed diaries he kept were themselves an<br />
amazing testament to his strength and devotion to duty.<br />
And that it was forty years before he got around to<br />
publishing them is equally a testament to his humility<br />
and no doubt to his determination to get on with life.<br />
Weary Dunlop's great qualities were universal physical<br />
strength, intelligence and insight, courage, persistence<br />
and, above all, boundless love for his fellow man.<br />
Yet much in his character and the values he brought to<br />
the appalling human trial on the Burma-Thailand railway<br />
we recognise as unmistakably Australian. And he was<br />
unmistakably Australian.<br />
It was the military history of his own country which<br />
inspired him, indeed the military history of his own<br />
district and his own family. He went to war in London<br />
dressed in the uniform of the First AIF, and it was as if<br />
he was filled with the same spirit.<br />
There is the same familiarity in his pragmatism and the<br />
astounding capacity for improvisation he displayed in the<br />
camps of Thailand from the saline drips he devised for<br />
cholera victims to his tax on fellow officers to raise<br />
revenue for food and medical supplies.<br />
As his diaries reveal, he took to the struggle not just<br />
stoic courage but, in the best Australian tradition, an<br />
unfailing sense of humour and irony.<br />
In terrible necessity he saw the need for discipline but<br />
he also knew that authority should be earned.<br />
He recognised that the key to survival in adversity was<br />
willingness to share the hardship, that reliance on each<br />
other was essential. He knew the value of mateship.<br />
Strong as he was, he did not despise the weakness of<br />
others. He knew that if not all were of equal capacity,<br />
all were equal in suffering and all equally deserving<br />
help.<br />
We do not have to believe that these are uniquely<br />
Australian insights into human nature, or uniquely<br />
Australian qualities, to see in them a continuation of<br />
the values associated with the Australian legend<br />
including the legend of Anzac. We can see in Weary<br />
Dunlop, and Australians' admiration of him, an<br />
affirmation of our values, an embodiment of our best<br />
traditions. But the legend did not stop him. He did not live the<br />
remainder of his life in defence of the past, but in<br />
doing all he could to ensure that Australia had a future. </p>
<p>Although he had every reason to do so, he did not let the<br />
evil he experienced destroy his faith in the capacity of<br />
human beings for good.<br />
The war did not close his mind to human possibility, it<br />
opened it.<br />
He did not live weighed down with hatred for Japan, nor<br />
buoyed by satisfaction with his own heritage and culture.<br />
Weary Dunlop was tortured, beaten, three times sentenced<br />
to execution. He spent every day attempting to save the<br />
victims of insane cruelty. He wrote in his diary on May<br />
9 1943 that the sight of men " broken into emaciated,<br />
pitiful wrecks, bloated with beriberi, terribly reduced<br />
with pellagra, dysentery and malaria and covered with<br />
disgusting sores" produced in him a " searing hatred" of<br />
the Japanese.<br />
Yet he overcame his hatred. He opened his heart and<br />
his household to his old enemies, and widened his<br />
perspective even so far, I understand, as to adopt<br />
elements of their philosophy and culture.<br />
He did not see his experience in Asia as confirmation of<br />
Australia's old prejudice towards these countries, but as<br />
proof of our necessity to understand and engage with them<br />
not as colonisers but as colleagues.<br />
The war convinced him that our future depended on<br />
learning to live in Asia, and he never doubted that we<br />
could do this and be enriched by it, and still carry on<br />
those best traditions which he exemplified.<br />
As one fellow POW, Tom Uren, said; " Weary Dunlop<br />
continued to grow as a human being all his life".<br />
That is one more reason why the story of Weary Dunlop<br />
should be known to all Australians.<br />
He embraced change, he encouraged it, he believed in the<br />
possible for all his love of Australia ( and indeed of<br />
Britain) he imagined a different Australia.<br />
I cannot even begin to do justice to Weary Dunlop's<br />
activity after the war. To read the startling entry in<br />
Who's Who, rather like the Diaries, is to wonder if in<br />
fact we are all made of the same clay.<br />
He was pre-eminently a surgeon. The first Surgeon<br />
appointed to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after the war,<br />
Honorary Surgeon to the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear<br />
Hospital, Consultant Surgeon to the Peter MacCallum<br />
Clinic, special surgeon to the Repatriation Department,<br />
the second Australian to become Vice President of the<br />
International Society of Surgeons, and in 1969 leader of<br />
the Australian surgical team in Vietnam. </p>
<p>He pioneered surgery in the oesophagus, mouth and throat;<br />
but as Les Tanner, whose larynx Weary Dunlop removed,<br />
pointed out this year, he was among the last of the " allover"<br />
surgeons meaning he could operate on your toe or<br />
your head and everything in between.<br />
And of course he was an " all-over" man; a patron,<br />
vice-president, committeeman and member of countless<br />
organisations in the public interest beyond the scope of<br />
medicine not least among them the association of ex-<br />
POWs and their relatives.<br />
He was a pioneer, of course, of the Colombo Plan, an<br />
adviser to Thailand, Sri Lanka and India. He lectured in<br />
countries throughout the region. He was President of the<br />
Australian-Asian Society.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
In a speech in Seattle a couple of weeks ago President<br />
Clinton summed up the change in the countries of Asia<br />
and in our perceptions of them by saying that the<br />
" dominoes have become dynamos"<br />
Weary Dunlop recognised the potential for this long ago.<br />
In 1954 he said:<br />
The people in these emerging nations are going<br />
toward what they want. They have their star to win,<br />
and they let nothing stand in their way. It uplifts<br />
you to find that spirit.<br />
In 1993, we in Australia are coming to terms with the<br />
reality of their astounding success.<br />
Not that Asia has dawned on us all of a sudden. It is<br />
often forgotten that Australia's relations with the<br />
region go back to the very beginning of post-colonial<br />
Asia from our support for Indonesia's independence<br />
movement through our participation in the defence of<br />
Malaysia during confrontation, to our involvement in the<br />
Colombo Plan.<br />
Far-sighted people like Weary Dunlop and Richard Casey<br />
and a handful of others knew where Australia's interests<br />
lay and worked hard to build up the trading,<br />
institutional and cultural links as the countries of Asia<br />
grew. From soon after the end of the war with Japan, Australia<br />
played a vital role in the economic reconstruction of its<br />
former enemy by providing the necessary raw materials and<br />
minerals. Thus the ground was laid for the enormously<br />
beneficial trade relationship we now have with Japan. </p>
<p>Some deep personal friendships and inistitutional and<br />
commercial associations were forged which underpin the<br />
close government relations and people-to-people contacts<br />
we have today.<br />
And I might say that we have to a very large degree<br />
repeated this experience with the industrial miracle in<br />
the Republic of Korea.<br />
In the last decade, the growth of our trade and other<br />
ties with Asia, including South-East Asia has<br />
dramatically adcelerated.<br />
A decade ago, 46 per cent of our exports went to Asia.<br />
That figure has now reached 60 per cent. Over the same<br />
decade our exports to South-East Asia have grown by 400<br />
per cent.<br />
We have seen a remarkable expansion in people-to-people<br />
relationships. In 1980 just over 315,000 Australians<br />
visited Asian countries. In 1992 the number had grown to<br />
780, 000.<br />
110,000 people from Asian countries visited Australia in<br />
1979. In 1992-93 the figure was 1.2 million 650,000 of<br />
them from Japan.<br />
I've already made several references to " Asia" tonight.<br />
It is a convenient term but, of course, it is also a<br />
misleading one. It should not blind us to the great<br />
cultural, social and other differences within the region.<br />
It is a term we use in full knowledge of this diversity.<br />
In this general regard, I think we can say that we have<br />
seen substantial advances in the process of cultural<br />
understanding. One measure of this, among many, is language learning.<br />
In 1982, 15 per cent of Australian Year 12 students<br />
learning languages other than English were learning Asian<br />
languages. Today that figure has nearly doubled.<br />
Another recent development is Australian Television<br />
International which is now projecting images of Australia<br />
to 15 countries of the region and fostering an<br />
understanding of Australia that goes way beyond the old<br />
stereotypes. I might say that this service also provides an<br />
unparalleled opportunity for Australian business to reach<br />
an increasingly sophisticated market through a quality<br />
English language medium.<br />
The sponsors of this lecture, Asialink, are another<br />
example of the efftorts being made to heighten cultural<br />
understanding. </p>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Asialink for<br />
the work they are doing and in particular tonight<br />
commend them for the establishment of the Dunlop Asia<br />
Awards Fund. I should also commend the Buckland<br />
Foundation -for their initial contribution of $ 50,000.<br />
And I take the opportunity to announce that the<br />
Commonwealth Government will at least match it.<br />
The Dunlop Fellowships will go some way towards creating<br />
a generation of Australians who look to Asia for<br />
stimulus, much as earlier generations looked to Britain<br />
and Europe.<br />
As I said, we are witnessing continuing development, a<br />
steady progress, not a sudden revolution. Yet in the<br />
past two years, there is no doubt that progress has been<br />
suddenly more rapid, our activity suddenly more intense;<br />
and, I believe, comprehension of the opportunities and<br />
imperatives which the region represents has become<br />
suddenly more general among Australians.<br />
We have seen developments of considerable substance far<br />
more developments and far more substance, I venture to<br />
say, than we have ever achieved in such a short time<br />
before. We have established a Ministerial Forum with<br />
Indonesia, a structure which has enabled us to<br />
increase co-operation across a whole range of<br />
government business.<br />
We have helped to create the ASEAN Regional Forum, a<br />
new institution for the discussion of security<br />
issues in an area formerly suspicious of<br />
multilateral approaches to security.<br />
We have seen the successful conclusion of the<br />
Cambodian peace effort in which Indonesia and<br />
Australia played such an important catalytic role.<br />
Our relationship with Japan has developed new<br />
dimensions and depth of co-operation. I have had<br />
three separate meetings with the Japanese Prime<br />
Minister in that period.<br />
Most importantly, APEC has continued to develop, and<br />
we saw last month in Seattle the remarkable meeting<br />
without any officials present of a group of<br />
leaders representing forty per cent of the world's<br />
population and fifty per cent of its production to<br />
discuss the challenges facing the region.<br />
The role of leaders in these developments is vital,<br />
because through their actions they inevitably set the<br />
direction and symbolise national choices.<br />
I have made it a priority to do what I can to set a<br />
pattern of contact with the leaders of our region. </p>
<p>I am pleased to say tonight that at the invitation of<br />
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai I shall visit Thailand next<br />
year. During that visit I will have the opportunity to<br />
pay my respect to over 1300 of Weary Dunlop's Australian<br />
comrades who are buried at Kanchanaburi Cemetry. I hope<br />
also to be present at the opening of the Australian built<br />
and funded Friendship Bridge over the Mekong River<br />
between Thailand and Laos.<br />
Forging a new presence in our region has not been plain<br />
sailing, of course, nor will it ever be. Countries have<br />
different interests to pursue and different ways of<br />
pursuing them.<br />
I want to say something very briefly about the current<br />
difficulty we are experiencing in the relationship with<br />
the Government of Malaysia.<br />
The difficulty began because of the reply I gave to a<br />
question from a journalist at a doorstop press conference<br />
in Seattle.<br />
That answer, as I have said, was not intended to cause<br />
offence and I regret that offence has been taken.<br />
For more than 30 years we have had a close and mutually<br />
beneficial relationship with Malaysia. More than 100,000<br />
Malaysian students have been educated here; we have a<br />
very balanced trade relationship; 85,000 Australians were<br />
born in Malaysia.<br />
We have always been committed to the security and<br />
development of Malaysia and the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangement is a demonstration of the fact that we are<br />
committed in the most fundamental way.<br />
The Australian Government wants to preserve the interests<br />
we share and the friendship between our two countries and<br />
our two peoples. We want to work in harmony with the<br />
Malaysian Government.<br />
But any relationship of substance and value requires<br />
commitment from both sides. For our part we are<br />
committed. We are willing to put in the effort necessary<br />
to keep the channels of communication open.<br />
We have been putting in that effort at Ministerial level<br />
with the visits of Senators Cook and Ray to Malaysia<br />
within the last two days and with the contact today<br />
between our two foreign ministers.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
There is now, I am sure, widespread recognition not only<br />
that our future lies in the Asia-Pacific, but that we can<br />
play a dynamic and rewarding role in the regional<br />
community. </p>
<p>Eighteen months ago when I gave an address to the<br />
Asia-Australia Institute in Sydney, there were still some<br />
loud protests decrying our ambitions. We heard them<br />
sporadically throughout the year. It was as if we were<br />
advocating the abolition of Shakespeare and cricket.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Soon after I took office as Prime Minister I made this<br />
point in my first major speech on Australia's foreign<br />
policy. I said and I think it bears repeating now that we go<br />
to Asia " as we are"<br />
Not with the ghost of empire about us. Not as a<br />
vicar of Europe or as a US deputy. But<br />
unambivalently. Sure of who we are and what we<br />
stand for. If we are to be taken seriously,<br />
believed, trusted, that is the only way to go.<br />
Claims that the Government is attempting to turn<br />
Australia into an " Asian country" are based on a<br />
misunderstanding both of my own approach and the<br />
direction of government policy.<br />
This is something I want to be understood very clearly<br />
because it is at the core of my view of Australia and of<br />
the Government's approach to relations with our<br />
neighbourhood. Put simply, Australia is not and can never be an " Asian<br />
nation" any more than we can or want to be European<br />
or North American or African.<br />
We can only be Australian and can only relate to our<br />
friends and neighbours as Australian.<br />
This is not an expression of self-satisfaction. Nor is<br />
it an assertion of our mores over those of any other<br />
country. But we want to draw on all the distinctive strengths of<br />
our history and our contemporary democratic, pluralist<br />
culture the rich and ancient culture of indigenous<br />
Australians, the energy, bravery and resilience of our<br />
early European settlers and the institutions they<br />
created, and all the creativity and drive which comes<br />
from the people of 150 nations who now make their home in<br />
Australia. And we want, in particular, to draw on the talents and<br />
experience of those immigrants now almost half our<br />
total intake who come here from Asia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen </p>
<p>In perhaps the most profound change of our history, the<br />
monocultural Australia of Weary Dunlop's youth has become<br />
a multicultural Australia; and the multicultural mix<br />
includes a large number of people from Asian countries<br />
who just a generation ago were excluded as a matter of<br />
policy. In a change hardly less profound, the Australian economy<br />
has been transformed into one which is much more diverse,<br />
much more competitive, much less regulated and much more<br />
capable of succeeding in the modern world.<br />
Accompanying this process, and essential to it, a new<br />
business culture is emerging with the emphasis on<br />
cleverness, comparative advantage, excellence and<br />
exports. It is no accident that exports have risen from<br />
14 per cent of GDP in 1982 to 20 per cent in 1992.<br />
At the same time, we have seen an extraordinary<br />
revolution in the culture of Australian workplaces, from<br />
perennial and habitual conflict to co-operation and<br />
creativity. In many ways, as a consequence of these changes, we are<br />
now seeing the greatest change of all the integration<br />
of Australia into its own region.<br />
The past ten years have given me the greatest faith in<br />
the willingness and capacity of Australians to respond to<br />
the need for change. Properly managed, change should not<br />
be a problem for us. Our values and institutions are<br />
strong enough our people sufficiently resourceful.<br />
Resourceful enough to make me think that, if anything, we<br />
should set ourselves more challenges than we have been<br />
prepared to in the past.<br />
Far from representing a threat to Australia's democratic<br />
and cultural traditions, I am convinced that our capacity<br />
for change is enlarged by living up to them. In fact I<br />
am convinced the only way to successfully manage change<br />
is by pulling the threads of our common values and our<br />
common interest together.<br />
We will not, for instance, make ourselves more<br />
competitive by leaving marginalised large sections of the<br />
population whether they are Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islanders or the unemployed.<br />
I might say inter alia that that is why the Government<br />
took up the challenge of Mabo: difficult and temporarily<br />
divisive as the issue has been, the long term interests<br />
of Australia can only be served by delivering to<br />
indigenous Australians recognition of the truth and the<br />
basis for justice. </p>
<p>Australia will be stronger f or tackling this 200 year old<br />
problem. We will be stronger for knowing that we have<br />
taken up the challenge; stronger for the unity it will<br />
ultimately bring; stronger for the international respect<br />
and, who knows, greater self-esteem it will bring.<br />
The need to make us a stronger, more cohesive, more<br />
inclusive nation not to say one which is more<br />
productive and efficient is also why we have taken on<br />
the task of regional development. And why we are<br />
conducting the most intensive investigation in our<br />
history of the causes of unemployment and the means of<br />
creating jobs. Our standard of living, our decent<br />
values, do not have to be lost in the course of<br />
international or regional competitiveness.<br />
Unemployment will not make us more competitive any more<br />
thhan will: running down our health services, or cutting<br />
away our social security net, or making access to<br />
education less egalitarian, or undermining in any way the<br />
policy manifestations of our tradition of the fair go.<br />
If we want change we have to guarantee these things<br />
above all, we have to find ways to solve the problem of<br />
unemployment. Paradoxical as it may sound to the more simple-minded<br />
economic rationalists, the cause of competitiveness is<br />
best served by a spirit of co-operation. To learn the<br />
lesson of cooperation and the value of pooling our<br />
strength we need only go to Weary Dunlop's diaries. But<br />
we should not have to go to them. That lesson has always<br />
been the same we will be much stronger for having a<br />
sense of common purpose, of shared national goals.<br />
There can be no greater national goal than helping to<br />
create a vibrant Asia-Pacific community, thriving on its<br />
economic dynamism and its cultural and ethnic diversity.<br />
A community whose members acknowledge and appreciate each<br />
other's differences while sharing a sense of common<br />
economic and security interests, and a common destiny. A<br />
community with a small " I2cas I have always said. A<br />
community with a shared sense of possibility, a shared<br />
idea of the future.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Until recently, the diversity of the Asia-Pacific was<br />
overlaid by the fault-lines of the Cold War and by wars<br />
which pitted neighbours against each other and cut across<br />
common interests and complementarities.<br />
Now the outlook is very different. Now it is reasonable<br />
to imagine a great self-creating, self-defining regional<br />
community of nations. Now it is possible as never before<br />
to see the complementarities that exist in the region and<br />
the opportunities for co-operation. </p>
<p>That is what the leaders of the region saw in Seattle.<br />
That is why APEC is so important. APEC is a framework<br />
for a new Asia-Pacific era. It recognises the benefits<br />
of diversity in the region. It gives expression to the<br />
sense of community which has emerged unplanned by<br />
governments. And it offers a way to maintain the<br />
momentum of co-operation and to ensure that we make the<br />
most of the opportunities now within our grasp.<br />
For Australia, APEC is the expression of our greatest<br />
challenge. We want to engage with the region: to learn<br />
from it, react with it, give something to it.<br />
APEC is no abstraction. It is not the preserve of<br />
politics and business.<br />
It is important to every Australian and to future<br />
generations of Australians.<br />
Because APEC will make it easier for Australian companies<br />
to do business in the region, APEC can underpin growth in<br />
the regional economy and in the Australian economy and<br />
thus create employment worthwhile, fulfilling<br />
employment. Our economic integration with the region, like our<br />
integration with the global economy, is an essential<br />
prerequisite of economic growth and our standard of<br />
living. It is a guarantee that Australians of the next generation<br />
the Australians of the Pacific Century will live in a<br />
country at the leading edge, where the innovation and<br />
opportunities are.<br />
At the Seattle meeting it was agreed to develop a common<br />
non-binding set of investment principles, as a first step<br />
towards an eventual investment agreement.<br />
The meeting agreed to work on improving regional cooperation<br />
in areas such as standards which will reduce<br />
the costs of business, remove obstacles to exports and<br />
encourage trade flows.<br />
Recognising that continuing prosperity in the region must<br />
be driven by the private sector, the meeting agreed to<br />
establish a Pacific Business Forum; and recognising also<br />
that small and medium businesses are the source of much<br />
of the region's dynamism, they agreed that such<br />
businesses will be brought into APEC discussions.<br />
The meeting agreed to establish an APEC education program<br />
which will foster people-to-people and cultural links.<br />
The program will develop regional co-operation and higher<br />
education, promote study of key regional economic issues,<br />
improve workers' skills, enhance labour mobility and<br />
foster mutual understanding of regional diversity. </p>
<p>All these initiatives widen the horizon for Australia.<br />
Business, trade and employment opportunities present<br />
themselves. A world of great cultural richness and<br />
diversity is open to us a world in which Australia,<br />
calling on its traditional and newly evolving strengths,<br />
can play a creative and rewarding part and, in so doing,<br />
deliver prosperity and security to the Australians of the<br />
21st century.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I said earlier in this address that I believe the life of<br />
Weary Dunlop should be required reading for every young<br />
Australian. In his story there is an irresistible greatness, an<br />
irresistible lesson for our times.<br />
The greatness stemmed from those universal qualities of<br />
courage and resourcefulness and love for humanity which<br />
he had in such astonishing abundance.<br />
The lesson is that we should be open to change. The<br />
lesson is that we can be true to ourselves and yet open<br />
to others, that we can be bold and confident without<br />
being parochial and intolerant. The lesson is that,<br />
relying on each other, we can take on the most daunting<br />
challenges and succeed. </p>
