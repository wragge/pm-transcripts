STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY US PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVES<br />
I am pleased to announce that the United States Secretary of<br />
Defence, Richard B Cheney, and the Secretary of Education<br />
Lamar Alexander will visit Australia in May as guests of the<br />
Australian Government. They will be coming as President<br />
Bush's personal representatives to celebrate Australian-<br />
American Friendship Week and will participate in the Battle<br />
of the Coral Sea 50th anniversary commemorations.<br />
As a mark of the importance of these celebrations I too will<br />
be participating in several of the key events including the<br />
entry of Royal Australian and US Navy ships into Sydney<br />
Harbour on 1 May and a special wreath-laying ceremony at sea<br />
off Townsville on 10 May.<br />
The Battle of the Coral Sea was not only one of the most<br />
significant battles in the Pacific theatre but has become a<br />
symbol of Australia's enduring relationship with the United<br />
States. The visits by Secretaries Cheney and Alexander<br />
further serve to strengthen the bonds of friendship and<br />
alliance that were forged between our countries during those<br />
perilous years.<br />
