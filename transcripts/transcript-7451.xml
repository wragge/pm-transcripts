EMBARGO UNTIL 6 PM<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 JANUARY 1989<br />
I have today sent the following message to His Excellency<br />
Mr Noboru Takeshita, Prime Minister of Japan:<br />
" At this time of great sadness for the Japanese nation, I<br />
wish to extend to you personally, and through you to the<br />
people of Japan, the sympathy of the Government and people<br />
of Australia.<br />
The long Showa era which has now drawn to a close has seen<br />
the transformation of Japan into a major economic power with<br />
increasing influence in world affairs. The Emperor, symbol<br />
and focus of the nation, played a crucial role as Japan<br />
emerged from the ashes of war to establish itself as a force<br />
for stability in our region.<br />
Throughout his long life the Emperor was held in the highest<br />
esteem by his people. Now, as Japan enters a period of<br />
mourning and prepares for a new age, our thoughts are with<br />
you. I would especially ask that my condolences be passed<br />
to members of the Imperial family." </p>
