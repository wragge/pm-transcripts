    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGO UNTIL 6 PM FOR MEDIA 7 JANUARY 1989</p>
<p>I have today sent the following message to His Excellency Mr Noboru Takeshita, Prime Minister of Japan:</p>
<p>" At this time of great sadness for the Japanese nation, I wish to extend to you personally, and through you to the people of Japan, the sympathy of the Government and people of Australia.</p>
<p>The long Showa era which has now drawn to a close has seen the transformation of Japan into a major economic power with increasing influence in world affairs.</p>
<p>The Emperor, symbol and focus of the nation, played a crucial role as Japan emerged from the ashes of war to establish itself as a force for stability in our region.</p>
<p>Throughout his long life the Emperor was held in the highest esteem by his people.</p>
<p>Now, as Japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a new age, our thoughts are with you. I would especially ask that my condolences be passed to members of the Imperial family."</p>
