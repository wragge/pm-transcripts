CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF A SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE LAUNCH OF " PERSONAL ACTION GUIDE FOR THE EARTH"<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE 5 JULY 1989<br />
For anyone concerned about the future wellbeing of the<br />
environment, the roll call of contemporary environmental<br />
problems is daunting: Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez, the<br />
Amazon basin, acid rain, the depletion of the ozone layer,<br />
the greenhouse effect.<br />
In our own country, land degradation, soil erosion, the loss<br />
of tree cover, salinisation, the pollution of our harbours<br />
and bays loom as issues that demand our attention and<br />
action.<br />
Our ancestors on this planet may have thought the earth and<br />
sky were limitless in what they could give and take. We<br />
know that the truth is a good deal harsher.<br />
But however complex and deepseated may be the causes of<br />
these environmental threats we face, despair is not the<br />
answer.<br />
We need to recognise that we have a common responsibility<br />
for resolving these issues.<br />
If we work together in a sensible way, we still have ample<br />
time to achieve an ecologically sustainable world economy,<br />
in which legitimate demands for growth and conservation can<br />
both be met.<br />
If one nation pollutes the air or the oceans, or squanders<br />
its irreplaceable legacy of plants and animals, that<br />
represents a loss not just for that nation, but for all of<br />
us. We can't solve these problems by ourselves but we must<br />
solve them together.<br />
It's a responsibility that Governments, industries and<br />
individuals must shoulder together. </p>
<p>This policy of environmentally sustainable development was<br />
first addressed comprehensively by the United Nations' world<br />
Commission on Environment and Development, known also as the<br />
Brundtland Commission. Established in 1983., the Commission<br />
was asked to address the question of how such development<br />
could be achieved by both the developing and the developed<br />
world. The main thrust of its final report, published as our Common<br />
Future, was that environmentally sound development72riT nt<br />
mean no development, and that environmentally destructive<br />
development can only undermine the future of an economy.<br />
My Government strongly supports these arguments.<br />
The Federal Government already has a proud record of action<br />
to save the Australian environment from economically<br />
inappropriate development.<br />
we ensured the Franklin Dam was not built so that the<br />
grandeur of the Tasmanian wild rivers was not sacrificed to<br />
an unnecessary hydro-electricity project.<br />
we decided the Wesley Vale pulp mill should not go ahead as<br />
proposed not because we didn't want to see the economic<br />
advantages it promised, but because we were not prepared to<br />
achieve those advantages at the cost of unacceptable<br />
environmental damage.<br />
we have extended the Kakadu National Park and Great Barrier<br />
Reef Marine Park, and achieved World Heritage Listing for<br />
Kakadu Stage II, Queensland rainforests and Tasmanian<br />
forests, ensuring their natural qualities will be preserved<br />
for all time.<br />
We have recently provided nearly $ 8 million for research<br />
into the Greenhouse Effect.<br />
we are now engaged on a new effort to save the last<br />
wilderness continent Antarctica.<br />
Australia has refused to sign the Antarctic Minerals<br />
Convention because we did not believe that mining or oil<br />
drilling is consistent with protection of the Antarctic<br />
environment. we are seeking instead a comprehensive Antarctic environment<br />
protection convention and the creation of an International<br />
Antarctic Wilderness Reserve.<br />
On my recent overseas trip I secured the support of France<br />
in this endeavour. Germany and Hungary said they will<br />
consider our proposal carefully. India has already<br />
expressed its support. There are indications of a<br />
favourable response from Stockholm, Brussels and Rome. It<br />
is my profound belief that there is going to be an<br />
acceleration of world opinion on this issue which will come<br />
in behind the position that the Australian Government is<br />
adopting. </p>
<p>Later this month I will be releasing a statement on the<br />
environment which will announce new initiatives to harness<br />
Government action to save the environment.<br />
So this Government has every reason to be proud of its<br />
environmental achievements.<br />
But change cannot be achieved by governments alone.<br />
Governments need the support of the community of<br />
individuals who, by their myriad separate actions, are also<br />
doing what they can to protect our environmental heritage.<br />
That is where this Guide comes in. Its title tells it all:<br />
it is a guide for personal action to save the earth.<br />
The suggestions for action made in the Guide range from<br />
small changes to our habits at home and at work; through<br />
using our powers as consumers to alter the practices of<br />
manufacturers; to lobbying governments to take measures to<br />
combat bad planning and pollution.<br />
All of these actions are important for achieving the goal of<br />
an ecologically sustainable future. Not everyone will find<br />
all the suggestions appropriate, but most of us will find<br />
many that are. Many will save money as well as helping to<br />
save the environment.<br />
The booklet also lists an extensive range of organisations<br />
that can give more practical advice on what is suggested.<br />
I pay tribute to the Commission for the Future for producing<br />
this booklet.<br />
When my Government established the Commission for the Future<br />
in 1986, we gave it a charter to act as a focus for raising<br />
the community's understanding of science and technology and<br />
how they affect our lives.<br />
Its aim was to inform all Australians about the options<br />
available for us to choose for the future.<br />
By producing the " Personal Action Guide for the Earth" the<br />
Commission is fulfilling that charter by showing us what we<br />
as individuals can do to create a future which is<br />
environmentally sustainable.<br />
I note with pleasure that the booklet practises what it<br />
preaches it is printed on 100% recycled paper. The<br />
Government is already looking at ways in which we, as a<br />
Government, can move to greater use of recycled paper.<br />
There is no doubt that this booklet will generate a great<br />
deal of comment in the media and in the community generally. </p>
<p>I p The issues that are involved now in the consideration of the<br />
environment are, I believe, becoming increasingly apparent<br />
to all people in our community. No longer can it be said<br />
that concern about the environment is the preserve of those<br />
who have in the past been described as the fanatics, those<br />
who are way out of the mainstream.<br />
It's increasingly obvious, in this country and overseas,<br />
that concern with these issues now crosses political<br />
boundaries; it crosses age boundaries; it crosses<br />
socio-economic boundaries. Because, very simply, what<br />
people increasingly understand is that we are talking about<br />
whether we are going to be able to pass on to our children,<br />
and to their children, a world which is safe and<br />
sustainable.<br />
And when we understand that those are the issues, then of<br />
course it becomes quite apparent that the concern for these<br />
matters crosses all boundaries. It's in that sense that I<br />
think everyone is increasingly coming to the understanding<br />
that this is a matter not just for governments it is for<br />
governments-not just for industries it certainly is for<br />
industries but it is also a matter for each and every one<br />
of us.<br />
If we all just do two or three little things to help protect<br />
our environment things that we hadn't done before and if<br />
that impact is multiplied by the millions of people in this<br />
country, and if we get the same concept going around the<br />
world, then we will have done something that we should do:<br />
we will be creating and passing on a better and a safer<br />
world. </p>
