PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 1 DECEMBER 1989<br />
I am pleased to announce today a series of initiatives to<br />
improve access to Federal Government services for people<br />
living in rural and regional centres and isolated areas<br />
across Australia.<br />
The review of our policy designed to improve the quality<br />
of life for people in non-metropolitan Australia contains<br />
a number of new three-year programs.<br />
These include<br />
$ 4.5 million to provide support for long term carers<br />
of disabled people in rural areas;<br />
a $ 3.4 million rural women's health strategy<br />
incorporating funding for mobile breast cancer<br />
screening units in all States and Territories,<br />
improved family planning services, better<br />
information and counselling on women's health and an<br />
enhanced domestic violence education campaign;<br />
a $ 1.5 million extension of funding for geriatric<br />
assessment units in rural areas to try to ensure<br />
that elderly people in more isolated areas are<br />
receiving the sort of home or institutional care<br />
they need;<br />
a $ 900,000 expansion of the Countrylink information.<br />
program to reach more isolated areas. Countrylink<br />
consists of a 008 telephone service, country show<br />
displays, information stands at places such as local<br />
stores or Council offices, and the publication of,<br />
The Rural Book;<br />
a $ 1.85 million program to trial new ways to provide<br />
people in smaller towns with face-to-face advice on<br />
Federal Government services. These trials will test<br />
various means for providing a one stop shop'<br />
approach for access to Government services;<br />
a $ 500,000 extension to country visits by the<br />
National Acoustics Laboratory to assist the hearingimpaired; </p>
<p>S the establishment of outposted rehabilitation<br />
services at a cost of $ 1.9 million in remote<br />
communities such as Roxby Downs and the Pilbara;<br />
S trials of a new multi-purpose approach to providing<br />
supported accommodation for people in crisis;<br />
S a $ 1.7 million expansion of the Rural Youth<br />
Servicing program to enable an extended school<br />
liaison program by Youth Access Centres,<br />
introduction of mobile youth services and greater<br />
use of community agencies in providing advice to<br />
disadvantaged young people in rural areas; and<br />
S a $ 4.9 million expansion of the program providing<br />
hostel accomodation for rural school students.<br />
The new health initiatives constitute a further response<br />
to the findings of a 1986 Rural Women's Survey conducted<br />
with the assistance of the Country Women's Association.<br />
Australians living in remote areas face special<br />
difficulties not encountered by city people. There will<br />
be a review of the current system of tax zone rebates<br />
which provide relief to taxpayers in remote and isolated<br />
areas. The review will consider anomalies in zone<br />
boundaries and special zone rebate arrangements, as well<br />
as problems with social security testing arrangements<br />
affecting people in isolated areas. The Zone Rebate<br />
Review will be co-ordinated by the Treasury, with the<br />
involvement of the Department of Social Security in<br />
relation to social security income testing arrangements.<br />
The Review will consult with the Prime Minister's Country<br />
Task Force.<br />
A total of $ 3.5 million will target business potential in<br />
rural and regional centres under the New Enterprise<br />
Incentive Scheme ( NEIS) which will provide an additional<br />
200 places for aspiring business people. NEIS combines<br />
assistance to the unemployed with a boost to the<br />
development of new enterprises which, when successful,<br />
have the capability to employ many more people.<br />
Community and Government consultation is an important<br />
element in the Federal Government's philosophy of<br />
providing equal access to services for all Australians.<br />
As well as the work of the Prime Minister's Country Task<br />
Force, there have been special surveys and conferences,<br />
and many Government Departments have advisory and<br />
consultative mechanisms in place. </p>
