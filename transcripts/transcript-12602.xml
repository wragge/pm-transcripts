<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how important is this China visit to the relationship between Australia and China?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it';s important. We have a very good relationship with China. It';s grown enormously over the last few years, it';s diversified, it';s on a solid basis of mutual respect. We understand that we have differences but we also respect the fact that if you focus on the things that we have in common you can build a relationship and I think it';s made great strides over the last few years. It';s also important in a symbolic way to mark the fact that it';s thirty years since we extended diplomatic relations to China. And a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then and the world has changed enormously and we are now partners again in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You said this morning that the gas contract was relevant to the long-term future prospects of the relationship. What did you mean by that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what I mean is that if we can win the bid, and it';s going to be very tough, we live in a competitive environment. If we can win the bid I think that will help to inaugurate a new phase in the relationship. That';s what I meant by that remark.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Back home in Australia the Catholic Commission for Justice has put out a report based on documents they';ve got under FOI that says that 264 examples have been detected of self-harm among children in detention centres.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know nothing of it so I won';t make any comment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know nothing of it and I';m not going to make a comment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] focused on aging populations. While you';re here are you going to be looking for any hints as to how we can boost the fertility rate back home?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think ever country has to look to its own challenges in its own way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Deputy Secretary of  DFAT told a committee today that Australia has an unofficial policy of ignoring the Dalai Lama.  Is that your understanding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven';t heard of that so there';s nothing artificial. I met the Dalai Lama when he was last in Australia. As you can see I';m in China and he';s in Australia. Look he';s a spiritual leader. I respect him but you don';t have to meet every single spiritual leader that visits your country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What does Australia have to offer on the gas contract that others like Indonesia don';t?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think that';s probably something that I';ll talk about in more detail. But the one thing though that we have that none of the others have got and that is stability, predictability, twelve years of flawless delivery on contracts on time, on budget, in full, as promised.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you say a lot of water has flown under the bridge, Li Peng is critical on Tiananmen Square and what happened there. Have you got any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';m aware of the history of Chinese leaders. There';s no doubt they';re aware of  the history of Australian leaders. But I try to focus on the things that can be productive to our two countries. I remember that after Italian the dialects of Chinese are the most widely spoken in Australia now amongst foreign languages. Now that';s got to tell us something. It';s got to tell us that there are great people to people links.</p>
