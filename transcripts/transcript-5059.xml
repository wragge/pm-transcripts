AU) ST It A A_, I<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 JUNE 1979<br />
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has taken decisions on the question<br />
of future petroleum exploration in the area of the Great Barrier<br />
Reef. The Royal Commissions into exploratory and production drilling<br />
for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef reported<br />
in Novem. ber 1974. All Commissioners Sir Gordon Wallace,<br />
the Chairman, Dr J. E. Smith, and Mr V. J. Moroney, the Members<br />
agreed that drilling " should not be permitted on any cay, island,<br />
or reef or national park or marine park when declared".<br />
Bo: i Dr Smith and Mr Moroney considered that drilling could be<br />
pem. itted in certain areas, provided recommended buffer zones<br />
ana safety precautions were strictly applied and supervised.<br />
Sir Gordon Wallace was of the view " that petroleum drilling<br />
should be postponed, and be planned and permitted only in the<br />
light, and with the aid, of full scientific knowledge of all the<br />
effects of oil pollution direct and indirect, short and long-term,<br />
on the coral and other marine life".<br />
The Commonwealth Government has given detailed consideration to these<br />
differing views and has decided that, in line with the recommendations<br />
of the Chairman of the Royal Commissions, there should be no<br />
further exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier Reef Region<br />
and that there should be no renewal of petroleum exploration<br />
permits in the Region until the results of both short and longer<br />
term research are known.<br />
This decision will give positive effect to the categoric and<br />
absolute guarantee I expressed in Parliament on 22 May when I<br />
made it clear that The Government will not permit any drilling<br />
on tFhe Great Barrier Reef, or any drilling or mining which could<br />
damage the Reef.<br />
On that occasion I indicated that AMSTAC the Australian Marine<br />
Science and Technologies Advisory Committee had been asked by the<br />
Government to submit advice to the Government on a programme of<br />
research on the reef environment for consideration in the Budget<br />
context. / 2 </p>
<p>AMSTAC which is under the-Chairmanship of Professor Birch,<br />
distinguished scientist is a standing Committee of the<br />
Australian Science and Technology Council.<br />
On 4 April this year, I wrote to Senator Webster, the Minister<br />
for Science and the Environment, and suggested that the Minister<br />
might present a submission to A4STAC on a possible programme of<br />
research into the ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. As a<br />
result of the Minister's submission, and on account of A1NSTAC's<br />
own expert knowledge, proposals relating to the research programme<br />
will shortly be available for consideration by the Government.<br />
I am confident that the resulting research programme will do much to<br />
minimize Australia's existing lack of knowledge with respect<br />
to the ecosystem of the Reef.<br />
An important feature of arrangements with respect to the<br />
Reef is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. This<br />
body has the resp-ansibility of recommnending areas within the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Region for declaration as parts of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.<br />
The Marine Park Authority, in its 1977-78 Annual Report<br />
foreshadowed the possible declaration of the Capricornia<br />
Section of the Great Barrier Reef Region as the first section<br />
of the Great Barrier Reef Maine Park.<br />
The Government aclknowledges that it has constitutional powers in<br />
this area. It has been engaged in discussions with the Queensland<br />
Go-Ternment against that background.<br />
It desirable that the declaration of the Marine Park should<br />
await the outcome of discussions with Queensland which flow from the<br />
1978 Premiers' Conference agreement that the powers of the States<br />
be extended to the territorial sea, including the sea-bed.<br />
Because of the proximity of the Reef to the Queensland coast,<br />
the question of appropriate jurisdiction over that national<br />
asset is of obvious reli:-vance in that context. To this end,<br />
I wrote to the Premier of Queensland on 19 December last year<br />
and suggested that there should be consultation between our<br />
respective Governments on development of the arrangements resulting<br />
from the Premiers' Conference agreements and also the establishment<br />
control, care and development of a Marine Park in the Great<br />
Barrier Reef Region.<br />
Consultations, both at the officials, and Ministerial level,<br />
have taken place most recently in Sydney on 17 May and I am<br />
confident of an early resolution of these complex questions.<br />
I am hopeful that ai, early announcement can be made of the<br />
declaration of the Capricorn Section of the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park.<br />
The Government's attitude and position on these issues is clear:<br />
the Government has stated repeatedly that it will not<br />
permit any drilling on the Great Barrier Reef or any<br />
mining or drilling which would damage the Reef.<br />
Let there be no confusion on this point no part of the Reef<br />
is going to be damaged by an activity that takes place on the<br />
Reef cr off the Reef. .1.. 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
The Government has adopted the recommendations of the<br />
Chairman of the Royal Commissions that petroleum drilling<br />
should be postponed pending the receipt of the results of<br />
short and longer-term research into the Reef<br />
The Government has asked AMSTAC to recommend a programme<br />
of research to the Government and will be considering<br />
that recommendation in the Budget context<br />
Discussions with Queensland on the inter-related questions<br />
of the Premiers' Conference agreements on the extension of<br />
State powers to the territorial seas and the management of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Region are at an advanced stage. </p>
