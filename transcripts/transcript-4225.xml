    <content><![CDATA[<p>Â An outstanding figure in world history has passed from the scene with the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao was the architect and inspiration for the rebuilding of the world's most populous nation after the ravages of invasion and war.</p>
<p>Australians will understand and share the sorrow felt in China at his passing.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I extend&amp; our deepest sympathy and our regret at the loss of their national leader.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao was in ill health when I visited China in June this year. To my great regret I was unable to meet him, but the renascent China I saw is his monument.</p>
<p>9 September 1976</p>
