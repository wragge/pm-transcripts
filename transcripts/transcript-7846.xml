TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON BOB<br />
BROWN, MINISTER FOR LAND TRANSPORT AND SHIPPING SUPPORT,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 5 DECEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Australia is faced with terrible carnage on its<br />
roads. The figures are quite dramatic when you<br />
understand that someone dies every three hours, someone<br />
is seriously injured every nineteen minutes and someone<br />
suffers minor injuries every six minutes. Road accidents<br />
are the major cause of death in people up to middle age<br />
and they account for 75% of the deaths of young men. We<br />
have got to come to an understanding that the present<br />
situation is simply not good enough. In that context the<br />
Government has considered a proposal that has come from<br />
Bob Brown, the relevant Minister, which has been under<br />
consideration for some period of time. We have been<br />
given to understand that there are two things that need<br />
to be done. Firstly, you have the situation where a<br />
number of black spots, if I can put it that way, that's<br />
the jargon, have been identified by local authorities<br />
around Australia which points at which fatal and serious<br />
accidents occur with more regularity than elsewhere. It's<br />
suggested that a figures of some $ 150M over a period of<br />
three years could eliminate those black spots and the<br />
Government has decided on a program of $ 110M from<br />
Commonwealth sources which would be $ 50M in the first<br />
year, 1991, $ 35M in the second year and $ 25M in the third<br />
year. These areas of responsibility are fundamentally of<br />
course, with the States. But we are prepared in this<br />
one-off three year program to substantially meet the cost<br />
that's involved in fixing these black spots. And we<br />
would expect that in those second two years we will put<br />
in $ 35 and $ 25M if the States would be prepared to pick<br />
up that balance. We will be putting that money in for<br />
that period of three years as an absolute commitment.<br />
But as I say, we would hope and expect that the States,<br />
in respect to those second two years, would pick up their<br />
share of that responsibility. The money that is to be<br />
made available will be conditional upon the States being<br />
prepared themselves to implement a set of what would then<br />
become national uniform measures. To do this on a coordinated<br />
basis, that would be to have national<br />
alcohol limit levels, a national licensing of heavy truck<br />
and bus drivers, national uniform speed limits, speed<br />
limiters for heavy vehicles, adoption of zero alcohol<br />
limits for young drivers, to increase enforcement to<br />
ensure that there is a one in four testing of drivers for </p>
<p>random breath testing for alcohol, to implement a<br />
graduated licensing system for young drivers, to<br />
introduce compulsory bicycle helmet wearing, to introduce<br />
daylight running lights for motorcyclists and to increase<br />
enforcement of seat belt and child restraint wearing.<br />
Each one of those points have been identified by the<br />
relevant authorities as issues which, if implemented,<br />
will have a significant effect of the reduction of road<br />
fatalities and road trauma resulting from road accidents<br />
and the provision of the Commonwealth money to States<br />
will be conditional upon them agreeing to take the<br />
relevant action to meet those requirements.<br />
Additionally, we will be making a sum of some $ 1OM<br />
available to support extra research into vehicle design<br />
and other strategic issues and public education programs<br />
aimed at changing public attitudes and behaviour on the<br />
roads which is relevant to the level of road accidents.<br />
As I say, as a nation we have to face up to the appalling<br />
cost to this nation which flows from the level of<br />
carnage, fatalities and accidents on the roads. The<br />
Office of Road Safety estimates that road accidents cost<br />
some $ 6B a year, of which the health system bears about<br />
Some 30,000 Australians are admitted to hospital<br />
each year as a result of road trauma. So given the<br />
magnitude of this issue, not merely the tragedy of deaths<br />
but the tragedy associated with massive trauma, for<br />
instance the estimate is that for every paraplegic it<br />
emerges from these accidents a cost through life of that<br />
on average is about $ 1M. So this is an issue of enormous<br />
importance and as a Commonwealth Government we are<br />
determined to make a contribution and a significant<br />
contribution on both fronts. That is significant<br />
financial assistance to fixing black spots which are the<br />
points of serious regular accidents and through the<br />
provision of this money, to get the cooperation of the<br />
States to address these other issues which are recognised<br />
as being important in reducing the too high road toll and<br />
road trauma results in this country. Bob, do you want to<br />
add anything?<br />
BROWN: I just want to emphasise Prime Minister, that<br />
while the Commonwealth Government quite clearly has<br />
committed itself to a continuing program of road<br />
construction, there are still very many centres around<br />
Australia which the Prime Minister has identified as<br />
black spots, where crashes are occurring daily and where<br />
people are being seriously injured and where people are<br />
dying. What we've done is to decide on this occasion<br />
that we will now supplement the $ 1.3B that we'll put into<br />
road construction this year with these additional funds<br />
so that together with State authorities and local<br />
authorities we'll identify where those black spots are<br />
and we'll lift them out of the system. We estimate that<br />
as a result of this program we'll be able to identify<br />
about a thousand of them around Australia where crashes<br />
and deaths have been occurring too greater frequency.<br />
There is a heightened level of community concern, as<br />
there should be, about the trauma on the roads. There </p>
<p>have been some dramatic improvements but they're not good<br />
enough. And I applaud the decision that the Prime<br />
Minister has encouraged from the Government to ensure<br />
that these funds would be provided and that we would<br />
recognise the very serious deficiencies that exist on<br />
many of our local roads, many of our State roads. We<br />
will assist State authorities and local authorities as<br />
well to overcome those problems, to correct the black<br />
spots, to stop the crashes and save lives.<br />
JOURNALIST: second and third year. Are you saying<br />
that you want the States to make up to $ 50M for each of<br />
those years<br />
PM: we belive that Michelle, that as this area is an<br />
area of State responsibility we can't nor would the<br />
States legitimately expect that we would pick up the<br />
responsibility for this black spots area. It has been<br />
identified as about $ 150M. That would be estimated at<br />
about $ 50M over three years. We will put the whole of<br />
the $ 50M in the first year. But in terms of the States<br />
moving to pick up what would be their total<br />
responsibility after three years, that they would pick up<br />
you know, $ 15M in the second year and $ 25M in the third.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Our money will be put in.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
BROWN: That will relate to probationary drivers. One of<br />
the problems at the present time I think people should<br />
generally understand is that those young drivers between<br />
17 and 25, they make up about 15% of the population but<br />
they account for 35% of the deaths. And of those 35% of<br />
the total deaths, 80% of them are young men. So what<br />
we're concerned and of course alcohol and that age<br />
group, for all age groups through the motoring<br />
population, alcohol is a very important element in it.<br />
Those who are on probation, those who have picked up<br />
their permit and are still in that period of time when<br />
they're required to be driving accompanied by and<br />
experienced driver, generally that will be a period of<br />
about two years. The limit on the blood alcohol content<br />
will be zero.<br />
JOURNALIST: What national speed limits are you seeking?<br />
BROWN: Well at the present time we've got some of the<br />
States which have applied the 100km an hour limit and<br />
others 110. As the Prime Minister has indicated, I will<br />
this week be in touch with the State Ministers to<br />
indicate when that meeting will be held before Christmas.<br />
And that's one of the issues that we will need to<br />
resolve. It is possible<br />
L </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you have any preferences?<br />
BROWN: My preference is for one which exists in NSW, but<br />
I understand the concern on the part of many of those<br />
State Transport Ministers that it be lower. In fact, in<br />
Victoria they've just reduced it and the reason for that<br />
is quite apparent. There is concern about the impact of<br />
speed but most of those crashes which are caused by speed<br />
are not those which are caused as a result of vehicles<br />
remaining within the legal speed limit. Those which are<br />
caused as a result of speed are when the vehicles become<br />
airborne over metres and wrap themselves around trees and<br />
telegraph poles and till those people are inside, and<br />
they're not travelling at 110 kms an hour, many of them<br />
travelling at 140, 150 l6Okms an hour. That's where we<br />
need much more effective, of course, traffic enforcement<br />
as well. But that will be resolved by the State<br />
Transport Ministers. I've got no doubt that they're<br />
-going to welcome this list of elements of that total<br />
package that we're presenting to them because not only<br />
have they very often been pursuing these objectives<br />
themselves, but they know that the community quite<br />
correctly has become intolerant to the point where the<br />
community will demand that those elements be adopted and<br />
the State Ministers will respond. I'm sure they will<br />
respond admirably. In fact they could well be looking<br />
forward when opportunity of this kind to precipitate the<br />
adoption of a package which is the most comprehensive<br />
package of the most important elements of those factors<br />
on the roads that are contributing to the road trauma.<br />
And with the cooperation of all of those State Transport<br />
Ministers and the two Territorial Ministers, this is<br />
going to represent a very substantial advance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do all States have to agree before the<br />
Federal Government will hand over the money or is it just<br />
on an individual basis?<br />
BROWN: No, each State will need itself to agree with<br />
that package prior to any of this money being allocated<br />
to their State. Now I don't think that that while<br />
that's been made a condition and a requirement I don't<br />
believe that it would have been necessary because I<br />
believe that the State transport ministers right across<br />
Australia are themselves, individually, and as<br />
representatives of their government, they are<br />
sufficiently responsive to the need for these things to<br />
be introduced right across Australia, that they would<br />
have welcomed it anyway. Here's the opportunity now for<br />
us to precipitate it, to get uniform agreement to get<br />
things put into place and I've got no doubt that there<br />
will be absolute cooperation.<br />
JOURNALIST: clarify, if any States disagree, will<br />
you still proceed with the money to the other States? </p>
<p>BROWN: Not to the other States, yes, but not to<br />
that State which, I don't there won't be, there won't<br />
be any State which doesn't agree.<br />
PM: OK, are we, have we got any further questions?<br />
JOURNALIST: As in NSW you're on P-plates for the<br />
first year of your licence, that's what you are talking<br />
about is it?<br />
BROWN: That will be the probationary period, but as a<br />
result of when we get, we will get the transport<br />
ministers together and in the process of identifying and<br />
clarifying some of those discrepancies, often very<br />
marginal discrepancies that exist between the States, we<br />
will be seeking to ensure uniformity. I think everyone<br />
understands that with six States and two Territories and<br />
one Commonwealth Government, that's often very difficult.<br />
But they do respond and they're responding admirably and<br />
better and better all the time as they will with that<br />
program and that package.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
BROWN: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: That probation period may be extended?<br />
BROWN: Depending well if they choose to extend it, if<br />
they choose to extend it it could well be extended.<br />
JOURNALIST: black spots I mean there are<br />
pieces of rural roads that are infrequently used that are<br />
quite dangerous as a proportion of accidents can be<br />
to the usage?<br />
BROWN: We would expect the particular spots themselves<br />
to be identified first of all by local authorities and<br />
then secondly by the State transport authorities and most<br />
likely from their regional office. They will then be<br />
submitted through, they'll come through to an assessment<br />
panel which will consist with appropriate representation<br />
from the three levels of government. We will be<br />
expecting, in the first place, that the benefit cost<br />
ratio in terms of the return for the money that's, that<br />
that the elimination of that black spot would cost, the<br />
ratio would be at least two to one so there's a positive<br />
economic benefit in it, but it would also of course be<br />
dependent on the number of crashes and fatalities and<br />
injuries that have been associated with that spot. To<br />
some extent, of course, that will be a subjective<br />
judgement, but the subjective judgement will be on the<br />
part of a group of people that will be representative of<br />
three levels of government, not just ourselves, but the<br />
others as well. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: One area of a lack of uniformity that you<br />
haven't addressed is the age at which people may in fact<br />
drive. Does that indicate that there's little evidence<br />
to show<br />
BROWN: No, in fact the evidence, of course, indicates<br />
that the more chronological maturity on the part of the<br />
person, the more likely it is that they will act<br />
responsibly when they're in charge of a vehicle and that<br />
many of these questions of detail concerning uniformity,<br />
of course, have been addressed and have been pursued<br />
through ATAC, the combined transport ministers<br />
conference, and they're the people that I'll be bringing<br />
together before Christmas and the March ATAC meeting that<br />
was intended for next year will also be brought forward<br />
into the early part of next year because we want to make<br />
sure that we're addressing each of these problems<br />
adequately. JOURNALIST: That issue is not the condition of this<br />
particular package?<br />
PM: No it's not, no it's not.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes, you see at the present where this relates not<br />
only to motor cars and trucks, the heavy articulated<br />
trucks back to the fixed structure trucks, but also to<br />
motor cycles. I think people generally understand now<br />
that, for example, a relatively young man can go out in a<br />
relatively small truck and pick up a 5A licence and<br />
tomorrow he can be out on the road with some of those<br />
very large articulated trucks without either the<br />
experience or the age or the level of responsibility<br />
which are necessary for him adequately to control that<br />
vehicle. Now the same sort of thing applies with motor<br />
cars as well and it's been suggested, and we will work<br />
out the details together with the State transport<br />
ministers, many of these now have been pursued.<br />
Questions of the appropriate age at which the permit<br />
should be available, the question of the age at which the<br />
licence should be available and, in order to ensure that<br />
there is a growing capacity on the part of the individual<br />
rider or driver to adequately control the vehicle which<br />
they're riding or driving, there will be then graduation<br />
built into it. The best example, of course, that can and<br />
will relate to motor cycles and motor, family type motor<br />
cars as well, but the best example relates to trucks, so<br />
that depending upon the age, the qualifications, the<br />
experience, the level of responsibility, so the<br />
individuals drivers' right to handle increasingly large,<br />
more difficult to control vehicles will be graduated<br />
through the licence system.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>BROWN: The reason is that when you have 160 kms an hour<br />
on a road which is able or capable of taking that speed,<br />
that you have all of the traffic moving together. What<br />
you say is perfectly correct, they do have a very good<br />
accident record until one crash occurs. And when they're<br />
travelling at that speed, then of course they all pile up<br />
behind. So it does have its pluses, it also has its<br />
minuses and the State transport ministers in Australia,<br />
as was indicated with one of the earlier questions have<br />
decided that the appropriate maximum speeds in Australia<br />
should be 100 or 110. Now that's not a great, that's not<br />
a big margin, it would, of course, be better if we could<br />
get some consistent coordinated approach right across<br />
Australia. JOURNALIST: that the road system is taking too much<br />
freight<br />
BROWN: On the eastern seaboard road transport takes<br />
about one third of the freight. On the east-west freight<br />
routes across Australia rail transport takes about two<br />
thirds. The question of the adequate balance between<br />
that of course I suppose again is a matter of some<br />
subjective judgement. But I think we would all<br />
understand that road transport is better suited to some<br />
forms of freight movement, more diverse door-to-door type<br />
movement. The rail transport is better suited to the<br />
long distance bulkier heavy freight. What we want to do<br />
and what we're attempting to do of course is to ensure<br />
that both of those modes of transport are able to compete<br />
with one another to the most appropriate type of freight<br />
-that they should be carrying and in the process of doing<br />
that of course building up what we hope is a pretty<br />
comprehensive type of approach to the whole question of<br />
developing a total land transport system and network.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke<br />
PM: Is this of f this issue now?<br />
JOURNALIST:.. PM: Ok, if we can just have a few questions of f this<br />
issue and then I've got a Cabinet meeting to go to.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's related to this issue. Dr Blewett said<br />
today that the cost to Australia of tobacco related<br />
disease $ 2.5 billion and Mr Brown has said road<br />
accidents $ 6 billion health any<br />
thought to limiting either alcohol advertisements or some<br />
form.. PM: Well the question of limits on advertising has only<br />
to this point arisen in regard to cigarette advertising<br />
and not to alcohol. And on the question of the<br />
advertising in regard to speed and so on, one of the<br />
decisions we've taken today is for a $ 10 million fund<br />
provision by the Commonwealth for education in regards to </p>
<p>road safety. That goes with a question of attitudes and<br />
behaviour on the roads and I would imagine that that<br />
element that you've referred to would be part of that<br />
education program.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you received any new ideas in the<br />
Cabinet meeting today for future policy ideas?<br />
PM: I want to get to that meeting. That hasn't started<br />
yet. That's why this is going to be a rather shorter<br />
press conference than usual. You'll have the opportunity<br />
of talking to me on Thursday. But I don't mind two or<br />
three questions now but I want to get back to that<br />
important meeting.<br />
JOURNALIST: on alcohol advertising Mr Hawke. Do you<br />
see any merit at all in<br />
. PM: If someone wants to put that up it's something I<br />
Sguess you'd look at<br />
JOURNALIST: Hasn't Gerry Hand put that up?<br />
PM: I've seen Gerry talking about it. He hasn't<br />
proposed the Bill.<br />
JOURNALIST: Wasn't that one of the formal<br />
recommendations of the National Crime Authority<br />
PM: I don't recall on that point. I mean I have all<br />
I'm indicating is if there is some proposal in that area<br />
to us there hasn't been at this stage we will look at<br />
it. JOURNALIST: What's your own view?<br />
PM: I haven't developed a view. I happily supported the<br />
decision of the Cabinet today. I was happy enough to do<br />
that as an occasional cigar smoker I might say. As a<br />
non-consumer of alcohol I guess I would have an even more<br />
open mind on that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I did indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think alcohol is a major problem?<br />
PM: Of course it's a major problem in society. You'd<br />
have to be a monumental dumbwit to argue that<br />
proposition. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I've answered that. I mean if someone wants to put<br />
up a proposition about advertising in regards to alcohol<br />
I'd be quite happy for it to be on the table. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you like to comment on the<br />
Labor Council leaked Do you support the call for<br />
PM: Let me first of all say it is not a Labor Council<br />
document. It was some draft proposition by a couple of<br />
junior people in the NSW Labor Council. I simply made<br />
the point the other day which I repeat now that if you<br />
want to look at the position of the NSW Labor Council<br />
then logic demands that you see what the position of the<br />
Labor Council in NSW is. And the position of the NSW<br />
Labor Council was evidenced in their participation in the<br />
ACTU Executive meeting last week. So don't let's have<br />
any propositions that this is a NSW Labor Council<br />
position. It is not. draft document prepared by a<br />
couple of people who in my judgement don't know what<br />
they're talking about. Now on the question of<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you know who they are?<br />
S PM: I've read their names. Whether I've met I don't<br />
know whether I've ever met them. They certainly don't<br />
stick in my mind if I have. I see there's been some<br />
suggestion or query as to whether I contacted Mr Easson.<br />
I didn't contact Mr Easson. He rang me I might say<br />
yesterday morning. I think really that the continued<br />
employment of these people is a matter for the Labor<br />
Council. I must say that if they really believe these<br />
things that they put, the Labor Council doesn't really<br />
in their appropriate area of employment. That's a<br />
matter for the Labor Council, not for me. I'm not going<br />
to tell them what to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No. Didn't you just hear what I said. I said it's<br />
a matter for the Labor Council Milton. I am just saying<br />
that obviously people have rights to opinions. I'm<br />
simply saying that if they believe the things they've<br />
written I don't think that the Labor Council, which has<br />
an entirely different position, totally different<br />
position, a contradictory position... It hardly seems to<br />
me that that's a congenial place for them from their own<br />
point of view. But I'm not getting But that's a<br />
matter for the Labor Council. I'm totally comfortable<br />
with the position of the NSW Labor Council and of the<br />
ACTU. I mean it's like, I mean I guess I could find<br />
somewhere if I suggested that someone might do some<br />
searching I could find a document written by it's even<br />
more likely in the next few weeks I suggest that I could<br />
find some documents being written by some people within<br />
the Liberal Party and the National Party in Queensland,<br />
because there's a lot of disaffection there. But because<br />
there might be a document floating around written by some<br />
particular junior officer of the National Party or the<br />
Liberal Party, I don't think that that would necessarily<br />
reflect the position of the branch as such or of the<br />
Parties nationally. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The ACT Government situation I was<br />
wondering whether you would support moves for a new<br />
election at all possible<br />
PM: It's a matter to which I have given zilch<br />
consideration. ends </p>
