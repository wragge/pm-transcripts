TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THERION P J MEATING NMP<br />
DOORSTOP, AUSI-345 SOUYK CHNA SEA, 24 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Miristcr, are you hoping to get an endorsement fromn Singapore for a Heads<br />
of Ciovernment Summit meeting In Jakarta?<br />
PM I've had a very eniwouraging reply, and as you know. Singapore has flioc i<br />
nomninated as thv bcaidquarters for the institution of APEC. So I will be telling<br />
PrimeC Minister Goh of my discussions with Prime Minister Miyazawa of Japan,<br />
and the fact that I think that the whole initiative is gaining somne momentumi and<br />
that they may discuss the issue further with their-A SEAN partncrs.<br />
7: I guess it would be impottant to havc a memiber of ASEAN Come out with a more<br />
firm commitment towairds a Heads of Government aspect uf APEC?<br />
PM-Therell be fttrther discussions with ASEAN and of course President Soeharto will<br />
be seeing Prime Minister Miyazawa this very week. So it will be reasotiably well<br />
discussed. Is it rno~ ing along faster than you expected?~<br />
PM. Again, we haven't " et a deadline on it but it will be a bctter institution and better<br />
for Australia to be in an organisation that's got real political power.<br />
i You must be happy with the sort of momemnu of things being developing of its<br />
own accord.)<br />
PM: That's one Issue. but I'm very happy with the Japin leg of the trip in particular. T<br />
think that I'v'e established an even closer workin$ relationship with Prime Minister<br />
Miyazawa and other leaders in Japan. And we've consolidated many of the issues<br />
between us, trade issues and regional issues, and f look forward to be able to do<br />
the samne thin$ in Singapore with Prime Minister Goh and other Singaporean<br />
leaders, and to advance some of the issues between us here as well.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
I Do' yoki think it's entirely proper f0r the heads of foreign corporations to becomle<br />
directly, inolved in Autralittn political issues'<br />
P M. I've been in politics for a quarter of i century, nearly, and it's nev-er restrained any<br />
of them<br />
I Y'ou'd have to discount some of their comments, thoueh, as commercially<br />
PM. That', for companies to make their decisions about. It's not for me to particularly<br />
be vetfing or commenting on their remarks.<br />
3. There's one extremely important comment that we ried to get from Y'ou of course,<br />
and that i--yso ur prediction for the Grand Finals this weekend. Let's start wvith the<br />
most important onie, West Coast ' VelSMS GeelOtig,<br />
PMA. That's Lin easy ( 7oritest for me, I'm on Geelong, I think Geelong will take that out.<br />
it's a good side Oeelong, it's done. well right through the competition and I'd like to<br />
see it do well and win the flag.<br />
1: In Sydncy?<br />
PM: In Sydney, much as my Canterbury-Bankstown background will permit me I think<br />
I'd haive to be barreteking for St George against Brisbane. So we'll see what<br />
happens, but of course we'll be back probably just too late for all that.<br />
J: Is that a political or a league judgement?<br />
PMI It's a tribal judgement. tribal.<br />
J. Thank you Keating-san.<br />
