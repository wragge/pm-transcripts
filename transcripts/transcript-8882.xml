COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS<br />
MELBOURNE, 8-9 JUNE 1993<br />
COMMUNIQUE<br />
INTRODUCTION The Council of Australian Governments held its second meeting in<br />
Melbourne. The Council comprises the Prime Minister, Premiers and<br />
Chief Ministers and the President of the Australian Local Government<br />
Association. MABO The Council had a lengthy discussion of the issues which need to be<br />
resolved in formulating an appropriate response to the High Court<br />
decision in the Mabo Case which recognises a form of native title to land.<br />
No course of action was agreed by this meeting and member<br />
governments will be considering their positions further.<br />
MICRO-ECONOMIC REFORM<br />
The Council discussed a range of micro-economic reform issues. It noted<br />
that progress is being made in the area of micro-economic reform<br />
including reform in the electricity, water and transport areas. The<br />
Council agreed that the momentum for reform needs to be maintained in<br />
the interests of improving the competitiveness of Australia in the<br />
international economy. It therefore agreed that a working group of<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territory senior officials ( chaired by the<br />
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet) should report to the next<br />
meeting of the Council of Australian Governments with an agenda for<br />
further micro-economic reform to be undertaken at a national level.<br />
ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY REFORM<br />
Since the National Grid Management Council ( NGMC) was established in<br />
July 1991, relevant Heads of Government have extensively considered<br />
the arrangements necessary to give effect to their decision to implement<br />
a competitive electricity supply industry in eastern and southern<br />
Australia. On this occasion they discussed two NGMC reports one on<br />
the structure of the transmission network across eastern and southern </p>
<p>Australia and one on the NGMC's recent work including proposals for a<br />
detailed timetable of the steps which need to be . taken to commence a<br />
competitive market.<br />
The Prime Minister, the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria,<br />
Queensland and South Australia and the Chief Minister of the Australian<br />
Capital Territory agreed to have the necessary structural changes put in<br />
place to allow a competitive electricity market to commence as<br />
recommended by the NGMC from 1 July 1995.<br />
These structural changes will includd-the establishment of an interstate<br />
electricity transmission network with those States which are already<br />
inter-connected, together with Queensland, working towards<br />
implementation by 1 July 1 995 of the Multiple Network Corporation<br />
( MNC) structural option outlined in the NGMC's report. Under this<br />
proposal, the transmission elements of relevant existing electricity utilities<br />
are to be separated out from generation and placed in separate<br />
corporations. South Australia is considering the use of a subsidiary<br />
structure pending the resolution of cost issues associated with separating<br />
transmission from its vertically integrated authority. Resolution of those<br />
issues would enable the adoption of the MINC model.<br />
Tasmania reserves its position pending the outcome of its current<br />
electricity industry review.<br />
In making this commitment the Council noted that the establishment of<br />
an interstate electricity market and the implementation of the MNC model<br />
requires the settling of a number of important and sensitive issues<br />
including market trading arrangements, grid pricing and regulatory<br />
framework, budgetary impact on the States, the resolution of tax<br />
compensation issues and reform arrangements for the Snowy Mountains<br />
Scheme. It was agreed that there be a progress report on these, and a range of<br />
operational matters under examination by the NGMC, to the next Council<br />
of Australian Governments meeting. Heads of Government endorsed the<br />
NGMC's commitment to consult closely with key stakeholders in carrying<br />
through its work.<br />
Heads of Government also agreed to the further examination, during the<br />
_____ establishment of the MNC structure, of whether the network structure for<br />
governments to work towards should be a national network corporation<br />
or another option.<br />
The conclusions of a response to the NGMC's reports prepared by senior<br />
officials for Heads of Government which were endorsed are attached<br />
( Attachment together with the NGMC's timetable of events leading<br />
up to a 1 July 1995 commencement of a competitive electricity market. </p>
<p>WATER RESOURCE POLICY<br />
As requested at its December 1992 meeting, the Council received a<br />
report from officials on the current state of play in both urban and rural<br />
water use. The report noted that, while progress has been made in<br />
reforming pricing, allocation and other aspects of the industry, there are<br />
still significant economic and environmental benefits to be derived from<br />
adoption of a range of measures to overcome impediments to reform.<br />
The Council has therefore asked a working group of officials, with an<br />
independent chair, to develop and report on a strategic framework for<br />
efficient and sustainable reform of the water industry, which, at the same<br />
time, takes account of the technical and policy diversity that exists<br />
across the States and Territories. The report is also to address the future<br />
roles of the Council of Australian Governments and Ministerial Councils in<br />
the reform process, other mechanisms and a proposed timetable for<br />
implementation. The report is to be completed in time for consideration<br />
by Heads of Government at the next meeting of the Council.<br />
FREE AND FAIR TRADE IN NATURAL GAS<br />
The Council received a report from the Australian and New Zealand<br />
Minerals and Energy Council on removal of governmental impediments to<br />
free and fair trade in natural gas. The report noted that, while Australia<br />
has abundant reserves of natural gas, on present indications additional<br />
interstate sales of gas will be required in the near term. Heads of<br />
Government agreed to co-operate in the development of policies and<br />
arrangements covering the gas industry which are pro-competitive,<br />
facilitate the development of gas markets on commercial criteria and<br />
remove impediments to free and fair trade in gas.<br />
To this end, the Council has called for a further report from officials for<br />
its next meeting on progress towards a pro-competitive framework for<br />
the natural gas industry, within and between jurisdictions. In this<br />
connection, officials have been asked specifically to review existing<br />
regulatory arrangements, within and between jurisdictions, including<br />
those applying to third-party access to gas pipelines.<br />
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY<br />
The Council noted that the Commonwealth had consulted with the States<br />
and Territories on the implications of Australia ratifying the International<br />
Convention'on* Biological Diversity, in accordance with the<br />
Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment. It agreed that the </p>
<p>substantive obligations arising from the Convention could be met with<br />
only minor changes to the current policy and program frameworks of<br />
Australian governments. The Council'' supported the Commonwealth<br />
proceeding immediately to ratify the Convention.<br />
REVIEW OF MINISTERIAL COUNCILS<br />
Heads of Government have acted decisively to apply discipline and<br />
streamlining to governmental activities by halving the number of<br />
Ministerial Councils. Heads of Government-have also agreed to a range<br />
of efficiency and effectiveness measures in relation to the operations of<br />
those Councils that remain.<br />
The Council of Australian Governments has taken the decision to halve<br />
the existing 45 Ministerial Councils to 21 following a review of the<br />
scope, distribution and number of Councils. Details are provided at<br />
Attachment B.<br />
The reduction is to be carried out and support structures appropriately<br />
reviewed by January 1994.<br />
The decision will reduce costs associated with providing administrative<br />
support for such Councils and costs associated with Ministerial and<br />
officer travel and accommodation at meetings.<br />
This rationalisation will also improve the quality of policy development<br />
emanating from these Councils. Bringing together interrelated functions<br />
and activities in this way will result in more integrated policy<br />
development and will enable Ministerial Councils to take a strategic view<br />
of the issues beyond the interests of a particular group.<br />
The reduction in the number of Councils is to be achieved by the<br />
combination of a number of existing Councils after consideration of<br />
portfolio arrangements across jurisdictions, common membership,<br />
existing back-to-back meeting arrangements and overlap of<br />
responsibilities. Although in many instances existing Councils will be combined, this will<br />
not mean that constituent Councils will necessarily lose their identity<br />
______ entirely. In several cases, legislation requires that some combining-<br />
Councils retain a separate identity.<br />
The Council further endorsed recommendations to improve the efficient<br />
operation of Ministerial Councils specifically relating to the powers,<br />
scope, organisation, formation, chairing, meeting arrangements, agenda<br />
prioritising and confidentiality of Ministerial Councils. In this regard the </p>
<p>Council agreed that meetings of Min~ sterial Councils would only take<br />
place in the capital cities of Australia and Alice Springs.<br />
Heads of Government reaffirmed that Ministerial Councils play a vital role<br />
in the facilitation of consultation and cooperation between Governments,<br />
and noted that when Ministers have the authority of their respective<br />
Governments, then Councils determine matters to finality in their area of<br />
concern quickly and efficiently.<br />
CONCESSIONS/ FRINGE BENEFITS<br />
The Council noted the work to date of the Commonwealth-State working<br />
group set up at the December 1992 Council of Australian Governments<br />
meeting to review the allocation of functional responsibilities in the area<br />
of fringe benefits and concessions and identify and cost options for<br />
reform. From 1 April 1993, the Commonwealth abolished the separate fringe<br />
benefits income and assets tests for the Pensioner Health Benefits ( PHB)<br />
card, extending the card to an additional group of part-pensioners and<br />
older long term beneficiaries. States and Territories agreed to extend<br />
their concessions to this group for the period 1 April to 30 June 1993,<br />
on the basis of a Commonwealth commitment to meet their full additional<br />
costs over this period. An initial payment of $ 1 7.5m was made to States<br />
and Territories on 1 April 1993. The Commonwealth has agreed to<br />
provide an additional payment of 8m for local government's direct<br />
costs. The Council further agreed that a decision on the amount of<br />
additional payment to the States and Territories for the June quarter will<br />
be deferred until the 5 July financial Premiers' Conference.<br />
The Council agreed that further work should continue on options for<br />
longer term arrangements in this area and referred this matter for<br />
decision at the 5 July financial Premiers' Conference. To cover the<br />
interim period until the decision is made on long-term arrangements, the<br />
Commonwealth agreed to continue interim compensation to States,<br />
Territories and local governments for a period of one month, with this<br />
funding to be paid retrospectively and to be taken into account in the<br />
longer-term 1993-94 funding arrangements.<br />
COMMONWEALTH-STATE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
The Council noted that the range and nature of government functions has<br />
evolved rapidly in recent times and is continuing to do so. Policy interrelationships<br />
have become more important, leading to a sharing of<br />
responsibilities, among the various levels of government. In this process,<br />
however, the respective roles of governments have become increasingly </p>
<p>blurred impacting on the efficient and'effective delivery of government<br />
services. Consistent with the program of micro-economic reform which should<br />
encompass all sectors of the Australian economy and our continuing<br />
need to become more competitive internationally, the Council accepts<br />
that there is an obligation on governments to ensure that their joint<br />
working arrangements are as efficient and effective as possible. At the<br />
same time, increasing efficiency and removing unnecessary overlap and<br />
duplication of service provision will improve clarity and accountability and<br />
enable governments to deliver better-outcomes to their citizens.<br />
Recognising the progress that has already been made in clarifying roles<br />
and responsibilities, the Council agreed that it would be useful to take<br />
broad stock of the intergovernmental arrangements in functional areas<br />
involving shared responsibilities and to identify priority areas where<br />
progress can be made.<br />
The Council agreed to establish a Working Group to identify those<br />
functional areas which exhibit inefficiencies in existing intergovernmental<br />
arrangements and where there is scope for clarification of the roles and<br />
responsibilities. The Working Group is to be comprised of a<br />
representative from the Commonwealth and each State and Territory<br />
Government. Where appropriate, representatives from the Australian<br />
Local Government Association will also attend. It will report to the next<br />
-meeting of the Council of Australian Governments which will consider<br />
what further work should be undertaken.<br />
The criteria to be used by the Working Group in this process are at<br />
Attachment C.<br />
CENTENARY OF FEDERATION<br />
The Council agreed to establish a broadly based National Advisory<br />
Committee to develop an options paper identifying goals and strategies<br />
for the centenary of federation in accordance with the attached terms of<br />
reference ( Attachment D).<br />
It further agreed that, after discussions with other Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers and with the Prime Minister aimed at achieving. a broadly<br />
representative Committee, each Premier and Chief Minister will nominate<br />
a representative to the Committee. The Commonwealth will chair the<br />
Committee, and will appoint such further persons to the Committee as<br />
might be needed to ensure that the Committee as a whole is broadly<br />
representative of the community. </p>
<p>.7-<br />
REPUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE<br />
The Council noted that the Republic Advisory and its consultations are<br />
limited to clarifying the minimum constitutional change necessary for a<br />
republic. In particular, the Council noted that the work of the Committee<br />
was intended as a first step in an extended process of informed<br />
community debate which will allow full expression of the range of views<br />
held by Australians on this matter. It was agreed that the States and<br />
Territories would be consulted by the Commonwealth in further<br />
consideration of this issue.<br />
FUNCTIONAL FOODS<br />
The Council agreed that Governments should facilitate efforts by the<br />
Australian food industry to capitalise on growth in export markets. They<br />
noted that there is potential for growth in markets for functional foods, a<br />
class of foods that have been derived from existing foods and<br />
reformulated to perform a specific function relating to human health. To<br />
this end the Council agreed that the current restrictions specified in the<br />
Australian Food Standards Code, which inhibit the development of<br />
functional foods, need to be reviewed as a matter of priority. The<br />
Council noted that the National Food Authority is conducting a standard<br />
by standard review and agreed that review of those standards relating to<br />
functional foods should be expedited.<br />
UNIFORMITY OF PUBLIC HOLIDAYS<br />
Heads of Government have acted to overcome the wasteful situation<br />
where parts of Australia are closed down while other parts remain open<br />
because of the lack of uniformity in the observance of public holidays.<br />
It has been agreed that there should be uniform Australian Public<br />
Holidays and the dates on which Public Holidays are observed should be<br />
certain. Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day will be observed on<br />
December, 26 December and 1 January respectively; Australia Day will<br />
be observed on 26 January; ANZAC Day. on 25 April; and Good riday,<br />
Easter Saturday and Easter Monday will continue to be observed on the<br />
days set according to formulae traditionally followed for these public<br />
holidays in Australia.<br />
Heads of Government have agreed that a Working Group of officials will<br />
be set up to ensure uniformity for substituted Public Holidays when<br />
Public Holidays fall on a weekend. The Working Group will also examine </p>
<p>the observance of Labour Day and make a recommendation on an<br />
appropriate date for its uniform observance. The Working Group will<br />
report back to the next meeting of the-Council.<br />
The Council has no intention of reducing the number of public holidays.<br />
Rather, the objective is to achieve uniformity in the observance of public<br />
holidays. This is an important micro-economic reform with the potential<br />
to avoid the costs and disruption for business that occurs under the<br />
present arrangements. </p>
<p>ATTACHMENT A<br />
ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY REFORM<br />
In relation to reform of the electricity industry relevant Heads of<br />
Government: 1. Announced a firm commitment to have the necessary<br />
structural changes in place to allow implementation of a<br />
competitive electricity market -from 1 July 1995.<br />
2. Confirmed their commitment to the establishment of an<br />
interstate transmission network, separate from generation<br />
and distribution interests, noting that the achievement of<br />
this will require the settling of important and sensitive<br />
issues, including:<br />
market trading, grid pricing and regulatory<br />
arrangements; the budgetary impact on the States;<br />
the resolution of tax compensation issues; and<br />
resolution of reform arrangements for the Snowy<br />
Mountains Schemie.<br />
3. Agreed that establishment of the interstate transmission<br />
network be through adoption of the Multiple Network<br />
Corporation model outlined in the NGMC report.<br />
4. Agreed that jurisdictions in southern and eastern Australia<br />
will work to have the Multiple Network Corporation structure<br />
in place by 1 July 1995, consistent with the NGMC<br />
timetable for the introduction of a competitive electricity<br />
market ( in relation to 1, 3 and 4 Tasmania indicated that it is<br />
reviewing the appropriate structure of its electricity supply<br />
______ industry. and will report to COAG once a decision has * been<br />
made) ( in relation to 3 and 4, South Australia indicated it is<br />
considering the use of a subsidiary structure pending the<br />
resolution of cost issues associated with separating<br />
transmission from its vertically integrated authority. </p>
<p>Resolution of those issues would enable the adoption of the<br />
Multiple Network Corporation model.).<br />
Committed to further examine, during the course of the<br />
establishment of the Multiple Network Corporation structure,<br />
of whether the network structure for Governments to work<br />
toward should be a National Network Corporation or another<br />
option.<br />
6. Reconfirmed the objective of competitive generation as<br />
envisaged in the Nationa[-Grid -Protocol, noting that this will<br />
involve merit order despa~ tch of individual generators to<br />
ensure that the most cost-effective generation is despatched<br />
and to enable private sector generation to compete on equal<br />
terms.<br />
7. Called for a report from the NGMC at the next meeting of<br />
the Council of Australian Governments on the following<br />
major issues associated with implementation of electricity<br />
reform: the implementation of network pricing and market<br />
trading arrangements to underpin competition in<br />
electricity trading;<br />
appropriate regulatory arrangements, noting that the<br />
Hilmer inquiry into competition policy will report<br />
during this period;<br />
progress in the establishment of a high-voltage<br />
transmission link between NSW and Queensland<br />
( Northlink); and<br />
demand management opportunities.<br />
8. Asked the NGMC to address further major issues, including:<br />
methodologies to ensure a consistent and commercial<br />
approach to the valuation of transmission assets; and<br />
the, implementation of effective system control.<br />
arrangements for the integrated network, independent<br />
of the generation sector, that meet the needs of<br />
generators, distributors and major customers.<br />
9. Noted that the NGMC will need to further consult widely and<br />
visibly with major stakeholders. </p>
<p>3-<br />
Agreed that the parameters for the 1994 review of the<br />
NGMC be agreed at the next meeting of the Council of<br />
Australian Governments.::<br />
11. Requested the senior officials working group to report back<br />
to the next meeting of the Council of Australian<br />
Governments on:<br />
whether a Memorandum of Understanding is required<br />
between Heads of Government to advance the<br />
establishment of an interstate transmission network<br />
and, if so, what itf should contain;<br />
progress in the resolution of the tax compensation<br />
matter;<br />
-progress in resolution of reform arrangements for the<br />
Snowy Mountains Scheme; and<br />
reform actions taken within the States to facilitate the<br />
introduction of a competitive electricity market. </p>

<p>ATTACHMENT C<br />
COMMONWEALTH-STATE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
A Working Group has been established to identify those functional areas<br />
which exhibit inefficiencies in existing inter-governmental arrangements<br />
and where there is scope for clarification of roles and responsibilities.<br />
In identifying those areas that may be considered to merit priority<br />
attention, relevant issues include:---<br />
problems of duplication and overlap;<br />
inefficiencies in delivery of services to clients;<br />
incentives to cost-shifting between governments; and<br />
lack of transparency and clear accountability and<br />
unnecessary duplication in program monitoring.<br />
The Council will consider, at its next meeting, what further work should<br />
be undertaken. In areas where it is agreed that changes might be<br />
considered, the focus would be on the following objectives:-<br />
delivering better outcomes for citizens;<br />
increasing the focus on client outcomes rather than program<br />
inputs; removing unnecessary duplication of effort and improving<br />
efficiency and effectiveness overall;<br />
clarifying the policy and program objectives of the different<br />
levels of government;<br />
achieving administrative arrangements that are cost effective<br />
and clearly setting out the different governmental roles and<br />
funding responsibilities;<br />
clarifying, lines of accountability and increasing transparency<br />
of individual governmental roles in shared responsibility<br />
areas; and<br />
providing greater certainty in funding arrangements for the<br />
level of government delivering programs. </p>

NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEEf ON THE CELEBRATION OF THE<br />
CENTENARY OF FEDERATION<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE<br />
The purpose is to obtain an options paper for consideration by the<br />
Council of Australian Governments which identifies possible goals for the<br />
celebration of the centenary of federation, the strategies by which those<br />
goals might be achieved, and the involvement of various levels of<br />
government, interest groups and the-community at large.<br />
In formulating the paper, the Committee should set out goals and<br />
strategies for centenary-related activities in the years leading up to, and<br />
including the centenary, and draw on the views of the community<br />
through wide ranging consultations.<br />
The Committee should consider activities which will commemorate the<br />
events being celebrated, consistent with the significance of the<br />
achievement of federation. It should however take as an over-riding<br />
objective the building of a better sense of national identity and purpose<br />
for the next century and should give emphasis to activities that will have<br />
enduring and worthwhile results that go beyond simply marking the<br />
occurrence of the centenary.<br />
Particular matters to which the Committee should have regard include:<br />
1 The achievement of nationhood by the Australian colonies,<br />
including the events leading up to the enactment of the<br />
federal constitution.<br />
2. The national achievements of the first hundred years of<br />
federation.<br />
3. Ways in which an enhanced sense of national unity, purpose<br />
