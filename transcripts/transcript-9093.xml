STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KE. ATING, MP<br />
MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS<br />
Following the resignation of John Dawkins as Treasurer and the election of Gary Johns to the<br />
Ministry, I have decided to recommend to the Governor-General a number of changes to<br />
ministerial and administrative arrangemuents.<br />
A copy of the new ministry list is attached, showing the detail of the changes. I am pleased<br />
to announce that Ralph Willis is to become Treasurer. He has made an outstanding<br />
contribution to the Labor Government since it took office in 1983 and he comes to his new<br />
position as a Minister of wide experience and demonstrated capacity.<br />
Other changes to be made by the Governor-General will be the appointment of Kim Beazley<br />
as Minister for Finance and Simon Crean as Minister for Employment, Education and<br />
Training. Senator Collins will be Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and David<br />
Beddall, Minister for Resources.<br />
I will also be recommending to the Governor-General some adjustment of departmental<br />
arrangements. The Department of Transport and Communications will be renamed as the<br />
Department of Transport and a separate Department of Communications will be established.<br />
Laurie Brereton will be Minister for Transport ( as well as remaining Minister for Industrial<br />
Relations) and Michael Lee becomes Minister for Communications and remains Minister for<br />
Tourism. The Secretary to the Department of Communications will be Mr Neville Stevens,<br />
the former Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development.<br />
The rccord of achievement in Transport and Communications in recent years includes new<br />
industry structures for aviation; the development of a third runway at Kingsford Smith<br />
Airport; reform of the shipping and waterfront sectors; progress towards a national rail<br />
freight system and uniformn national road regulation; new regulatory arrangements for<br />
telecommunications, broadcasting and radio communications. and the introduction of<br />
comperition in telecommunications; and sale of communications licences for more than a<br />
billion dollars. The new arrangements will build on and enhance these achievements, which<br />
are alrcady contributing substantially to Australia's improved international competitiveness.<br />
The Department of Health. Housing, Local Government and Community Services is to be<br />
renamed as the Department of Human Services and Health. and Brian Howe will become the<br />
Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services. </p>
<p>Reflecting my commitment that there should be direct representation of women's issues in<br />
the Cabinet, Ros Kelly will become the minister assisting me for the status of women. She<br />
will be assisted in her normal portfolio duties by the appointment of Janice Crosio as a<br />
parliamentary secretary in that portfolio. Con Sciacca will replace her as parliamentary<br />
secretary in the Arts and Administrative Services portfolio.<br />
I am very pleased to welcome Gary Johns to the Ministry. He will become Assistant<br />
Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service<br />
Matters. Paul Elliott will replace Mr Johns as parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer.<br />
There will be an Executive Council meeting and swearing-in ceremony at Government House<br />
at 2.30 this afternoon.<br />
