CHECK AGAINS.. DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELI1VERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS TO FEDERAL CHAMBER OF<br />
AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES<br />
CANBERRA 6 MAY 1991<br />
These are times of great change in your industry and in<br />
the economy generally. In such times it is important that<br />
communication between industry and Government be frank,<br />
informed and totally open. Certainly from my Government's<br />
point of view, our door is always open to you and for the<br />
same reason I'm grateful for your invitation to address this<br />
dinner and to outline to you my perspective on the many<br />
issues facing us.<br />
Not the least: important of these is the new chapter that has<br />
been opened In Australia's economic history with the<br />
watershed tariff reductions I announced on 12 March.<br />
In my statement, I put to the people of Australia several<br />
fundamental propositions. I made the point that the world<br />
does not owe, and will not give, the Australian people a<br />
free ride. A~ s a nation we must face the challenges of<br />
improving the productive capacity of our economy so that it<br />
will be more internationally competitive.<br />
For years, the Australian economy sought to deny those<br />
truths, preferring instead to closet its manufacturing<br />
sector behind high tariff walls, insulating it from the<br />
challenges and the opportunities of the international market<br />
place. The so-called " assistance" offered by tariffs to industry<br />
turned out to be no assistance at all : it was no assistance<br />
to be confined to the smaller domestic market; no assistance<br />
to efficient industries to pay higher input cuts; no<br />
assistance to be isolated from new technology and new work<br />
and management practices.<br />
At the end of the day, it was no assistance to the community<br />
as a whole who footed the bill for tariffs through higher<br />
taxes; who paid again in the form of higher consumer prices;<br />
and who ended up with an economy less efficient that it<br />
could otherwise have been. </p>
<p>My Government has tackled this problem consistently and with<br />
determination. And the results already registered are an<br />
impressive demonstration of the effectiveness of tariff cuts<br />
as a means of expanding the manufacturing sector and<br />
boosting manufactured exports:<br />
most of our merchandise exports 83% in 1988-89 are<br />
goods that do not ' enjoy' any tariff assistance at all;<br />
most of our very substantial growth in manufactured<br />
exports 118 points of the total 148 per cent since<br />
1983-84 has come from the unassisted sectors of<br />
industry; since we took office we have slashed tariffs by over a<br />
third and, since 1985, employment, output and exports<br />
from the manufacturing sector have all grown at a rate<br />
faster than the OECD average.<br />
It was on the basis of evidence such as this that the<br />
Statement I made on March 12, in conjunction with<br />
Senator Button and the Treasurer, provided for further<br />
tariff cuts as the basis for taking Australian industry,<br />
including the automotive industries, successfully into the<br />
next century.<br />
With these latest cuts, we will, by the end of the decade,<br />
have brought the average nominal rate of assistance to the<br />
manufacturing sector down from 13 per cent to 3 per cent;<br />
and the average effective rate from 22 per cent to 5 per<br />
cent. Specifically in the automotive sector, this latest decision<br />
will continue the thrust of the Button car plan by providing<br />
policy certainty through to the end of the decade.<br />
PMV tariffs will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 in<br />
annual steps of 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent in 2000.<br />
That is the measure of our determination to ensure the<br />
increasing competitiveness of Australian industry and the<br />
increasing internationalisation of our economy.<br />
At the same time, new arrangements under the duty free<br />
entitlements, export facilitation and minimum volume<br />
requirements will continue to further the Government's<br />
objectives of seeking an industry more internationally<br />
oriented and better focussed on viable production for the<br />
domestic market.<br />
We recognise that results cannot be achieved overnight. But<br />
we are determined to capitalise on the reforms and<br />
restructuring that have already taken place.<br />
At the same time, we will continue to work with industries<br />
and trade unions to ensure the transition is as smooth as<br />
possible. </p>
<p>The tripartite relationship that we have created for the car<br />
industry since 1983 is a good example of the benefits of<br />
this kind of cooperation.<br />
Under the Button car plan, production has already been<br />
rationalised, so that the number of models produced has<br />
decreased from 13 to eight, and average production runs have<br />
risen from 28,000 to 45,000. Exports have improved<br />
dramatically with total automotive industry exports rising<br />
from $ 370 million dollars in 1984 to Just under a billion<br />
dollars in 1990.<br />
Today, the Australian car industry is exporting cars to the<br />
United States and car parts to Germany and Japan that's a<br />
significant achievement and I applaud it.<br />
So while there will be significant pressure on car markers<br />
as a result of these new tariff cuts, this needs to be put<br />
in its proper perspective.<br />
According to the Industry Commission, the share of the<br />
domestic market supplied by domestic producers has been<br />
essentially static over the last 15 years. Australia's<br />
vehicle fleet: is ageing.<br />
The Commission's conclusion was clear: " the high price of<br />
new vehicles in Australia, as a result of the very<br />
significant price raising assistance provided to the<br />
domestic industry, has been an important factor" in causing<br />
the static sales by domestic producers.<br />
By the same token, as the price of new vehicles falls with<br />
the reduction in industry assistance, domestic producers can<br />
expect to benefit from a more dynamic market.<br />
Certainly, sales figures this financial year are<br />
disappointingly low, and lower than expected.<br />
But the fundamental point must be that the prospects for car<br />
making in Australia are sound both in the short term, as<br />
demand rebounds from its current trough, and in the longer<br />
term as the industry adapts to the more competitive<br />
environment being created.<br />
And let me stress too that the March Statement was never<br />
intended to stand alone; rather it is supported by, and has<br />
to be judged with, the range of other reform initiatives we<br />
have underway.<br />
In particular, it must be seen in the context of the<br />
Government's overall economic management and in the context<br />
of our continuing micro-economic reform momentum. </p>
<p>As I have said on other occasions, I expect the economy to<br />
start to recover this year. Since January 1990, the<br />
official cash rate has been reduced by 6h percentage points<br />
to 11 Disposable income was boosted by tax-cuts in<br />
January. Businesses will soon begin to rebuild stocks, and<br />
the housing industry is poised to move into its cyclical<br />
upswing. However, this recovery will be very different from the<br />
recovery from the 1982-83 recession. We will emerge from<br />
this recession freed of many of the structural problems<br />
which have impaired previous recoveries. Since we came to<br />
office we have deregulated financial and exchange rate<br />
markets, introduced tax reforms and restored the share of<br />
profits in national income, to name just a few of our<br />
achievements. We are continuing to implement policies<br />
designed to increase productivity and flexibility in the<br />
economy. And, not least, we will have a lower inflation rate and<br />
current account deficit.<br />
Most forecasters now expect inflation close to zero in the<br />
March quarter and less than 5 per cent over the next few<br />
years. Importantly, inflationary expectations have fallen<br />
significantly. We have seen a swift adjustment in longer<br />
term inflation expectations in financial markets, affirmed<br />
by the decline in the 10 year Treasury bond to under 11%,<br />
its lowest level for more than 10 years. Business decisions<br />
and wage claims are now being based on lower inflationary<br />
expectations. Lower inflation will help to improve our efficiency, foster<br />
a better functioning price system, lower interest rates and<br />
induce better saving and investment decisions. It will also<br />
reduce the remaining distortions in the tax system, enhance<br />
the quality of information available for business decisions<br />
and allow a more equitable distribution of income and<br />
wealth. The improvement in the current account has been encouraging.<br />
The current account deficit for the first nine months of<br />
this financial year was 24% lower than the same period last<br />
year. There has been a merchandise trade surplus for 10 of<br />
the last 12 months.<br />
This means that while we still make considerable interest<br />
payments on our overseas debt, we are now adding less to our<br />
monthly stock of debt.<br />
So as growth returns to the economy, we will emerge with a<br />
fundamentally stronger economy, better placed to compete in<br />
the international market, better placed to provide the means<br />
to achieve our wider social objectives. </p>
<p>Recent developments on the Australian waterfront show our<br />
capacity, as Australians working together, to make progress<br />
towards this goal.<br />
What we have seen in recent days on the waterfront is the<br />
process of negotiation yielding positive results results<br />
that represent not a win for any particular party to those<br />
talks so much as a win for Australian competitiveness.<br />
This afternoon-Commissioner Sweeney conducted a private<br />
conference of the parties and has released a statement<br />
setting down 23 and 24 May as the dates on which the matters<br />
will be brought back to the Commission.<br />
The reform process is continuing unabated and the deadlines<br />
that we have set for the waterfront will be met.<br />
It is a result that could not have been achieved with the<br />
Opposition's confrontationist approach. This way, we have<br />
got progress without the chaos of full-scale industrial<br />
warfare. Those who would recommend confrontationist tactics really do<br />
bear the onus of explaining how that approach could possibly<br />
yield better results than sitting down at the negotiating<br />
table and hammering out an agreement that sticks.<br />
Because the labour market lies at the very core of our<br />
economy and because changes in it affect the lives of<br />
everyone of us, the evolutionary change we are presently<br />
witnessing there is naturally causing some concern in the<br />
community. The Government is pursuing the development of a more<br />
flexible approach to the National Wage Case decision so as<br />
to accommodate the pace and breadth of microeconomic reform<br />
we consider essential. In this, the Accord will continue to<br />
be, as it has been for the last eight years, central in<br />
providing unprecedented stability in the wages system and<br />
avenues for fundamental reform to awards and work practices.<br />
Federal Cabinet discussed this issue only this morning and<br />
our conclusion is that while we believe the AIRC will have<br />
an important and continuing role, both the Government and<br />
the Commission must each consider more precisely what this<br />
role will be in the more decentralised wages system of the<br />
future. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
In the new atmosphere of competitiveness and productivity<br />
that is being created, the ultimate responsibility for<br />
success lies with individual firms. </p>
<p>You don't need me to remind you of the criticisms that the<br />
Industry Commission has levelled at the automotive<br />
industry's work and management practices, its industrial<br />
relations record, and its inadequate performance in training<br />
and in quality.<br />
These issues need to be addressed, urgently, by individual<br />
firms if they are to survive in this new atmosphere.<br />
International best practice needs to be the target not<br />
merely honoured as a worthwhile concept but assiduously<br />
pursued as a real and ultimate goal.<br />
Without it without better management, product design and<br />
workplace practice the Australian car industry can never<br />
be competitive.<br />
With it, you will have a strong base from which you can<br />
compete with the best, exploit new markets, develop new<br />
products and at the same time respond to the changing<br />
requirements placed on industry by the community. For<br />
example, an increased commitment by industry to adopting<br />
world standards in product design and production will<br />
ultimately be of commercial advantage to you as well as<br />
helping the community achieve better road safety and lower<br />
greenhouse gas emissions.<br />
I don't pretend that the future of the automotive industry<br />
is devoid of complex issues awaiting resolution.<br />
But I do know, on the basis of what is now a long and close<br />
working relationship with you in Government, that the kinds<br />
of changes currently underway are producing the only<br />
framework in which the industry could prosper.<br />
I believe you will prosper.<br />
But I am certain this can only happen if we keep our eyes on<br />
the goal of creating that framework a framework of<br />
increased competitiveness and productivity for the whole<br />
Australian economy.<br />
In concluding, I want to pay particular tribute to Ivan<br />
Deveson, who has made an outstanding contribution to your<br />
industry over the past decade, and who has been a<br />
significant partner with the Government in the development<br />
of the policy framework I have discussed this evening.<br />
He has not always been in agreement with everything the<br />
Federal Government has said or done, but he has been<br />
reliably frank and constructive in what he has said and done<br />
as we work through these issues together.<br />
I offer him my congratulations and I have been asked to<br />
announce that the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries<br />
has decided to award Ivan Deveson life membership. </p>
