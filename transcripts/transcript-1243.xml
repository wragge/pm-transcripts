FOR PRESS tY P. M. No. 8/ 1966<br />
PRIME MINISTER TO VISIT QUEENSLAND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
It has been my intention to make an early visit<br />
to Queensland as Prime Minister and I propose to do this next<br />
week. I shall take advantage of the opportunity to participate<br />
in the Dawson byelection. I will be flying to Brisbane from Canberra on<br />
Wednesday 16th, and it was my intention to make a call on the<br />
Premier, r. Frank Nicklin. He has now been good enough to<br />
arrange to meet me at the airport.<br />
I shall then go on to Mackay where I will speak<br />
in support of the Country Party candidate on Wednesday<br />
evening. The following day I will make an official vis<br />
to Rockhampton and will stop oTf in Brisbane to record a<br />
" Meet the Press" television interview.<br />
I will fly back to Canberra in the late afternoon<br />
of Thursday, 17th.<br />
