FORESTS PROCESS<br />
In response to stakeholders' requests for more time to fully consult with the<br />
Government on its forest plan the public consultation period on the forests<br />
process will be extended for two weeks until 3 November.<br />
The Government is committed to a genuine consultation process and to<br />
thoroughly addressing any concerns raised prior to final decisions being<br />
made. The Government is also confident that the final decisions on this important<br />
issue, now to be made in November, will be broadly supported by the<br />
community. CANBERRA 18 October 1995 </p>
