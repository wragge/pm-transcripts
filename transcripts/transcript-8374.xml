TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE CONDUCTED BY THE HON GEORGE<br />
BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE HON<br />
PAUL KEATING MP PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
2 JANUARY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
President: Prime Minister: Could I now invite the President to make<br />
some introductory remarks and then I'll<br />
follow him.<br />
My remarks Mr Prime Minister will be very<br />
brief and I simply want to once again thank<br />
you, thank all of our official hosts and<br />
thank the people of Australia for the<br />
warmth of the reception on this visit. We<br />
have enjoyed it, it has been a busy time, I<br />
hope that we have made progress on the<br />
issues, for we may have differences, I<br />
should say issue, because I think there is<br />
only one area of difficulty and we have<br />
talked about that very frankly with you<br />
Sir, with the Opposition, with agriculture<br />
leaders and I feel it has been very<br />
fruitful in terms of the US on all of this.<br />
But otherwise I would simply say to you, we<br />
are very pleased to be here and thank you<br />
for your hospitality and I would be glad to<br />
take my share of the questions.<br />
Mr President can I thank you for those<br />
remarks and say what an honour it has been<br />
for me to represent the Government and<br />
people of Australia in welcoming you and<br />
Mrs Bush to Australia and having you here.<br />
You have had a warm reception from the<br />
Australian public which I think has been<br />
evident to everybody and we have been most<br />
pleased about that and it is true that we<br />
have had broad discussions which I think<br />
have increased </p>
<p>Journalist:<br />
President: the bonds of friendship between our two<br />
countries, and certainly given me as Prime<br />
Minister a chance, an opportunity to get to<br />
know the President and his views and -to<br />
also make a couple of what we think are<br />
important points to him. And that was the<br />
importance that Australia places on having<br />
the United States engaged in a political<br />
and economic framework in the Asia-Pacific<br />
and the importance of having won the CoLd<br />
War and in setting up an institutional<br />
framework of a Bretton Woods style but in<br />
trade. And we see this best being accommodated<br />
with the GATT, a successful conclusion to<br />
the GATT round, as a framework for the reentry<br />
of countries re-entering the world<br />
economy for the first time in either half a<br />
century or most of a century. So on those<br />
very broad fronts we have had extensive<br />
discussions as the President said on the<br />
other issues we dealt with them in a<br />
working like way and he has very kindly met<br />
our farm representatives and I think we<br />
have a reasonable understanding of our<br />
positions on those issues.<br />
So could I now invite questions.<br />
Alan Sunderland, SBS Television. My<br />
question is in relation to the EEP. I<br />
understand following your discussions with<br />
farmers you have agreed to have some sort<br />
of consultative process operating in future<br />
before decisions are made. How exactly do<br />
you envisage that consultative mechanism<br />
will work and do you envisage that it will<br />
have the effect in future of stopping EEP<br />
areas that have in the past affected<br />
Australia? Well we discussed having some consultative<br />
arrangement and I suggested it would be<br />
very useful to the farm leaders if they<br />
come, they have been to the States several<br />
of them, if they come again and consult on<br />
this EEP. There were some factual<br />
differences presented at the meeting by our<br />
expert and by them and so I think we ought<br />
to just try to eliminate differences where<br />
possible. And I made very clear to them,<br />
and I'd like to say it once more, that the<br />
EEP legislation was not aimed at Australia.<br />
It was aimed to try to get the EC, who are<br />
subsidising 10 times as much as the United<br />
States, to come into line and to get on<br />
board on a sound GATT agreement. So we </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: will see how that works out but we didn't<br />
set up any procedures in any exact threepoint<br />
program for eliminating differences<br />
that we might have. The answer though,<br />
that they do agree with me on, and I'm sure<br />
the Prime Minister does is to get a<br />
successful conclusion to the GATT round and<br />
I told him that we are pledged to that end,<br />
and I know they have tried, these farm<br />
leaders have travelled to Europe and they<br />
have been to England and, I believe, France<br />
and Germany and so they are fully engaged<br />
with private sector. I think now it is<br />
important given the Dunkel Report that I as<br />
President, the Prime Minister as Prime<br />
Minister, engage to the fullest to try to<br />
get the one answer to EEP that's going to<br />
make the most sense and that is a<br />
successful conclusion of the GATT round on<br />
agriculture. Mr President, last week your Commerce<br />
Secretary Bob Mosbacher said that Japan was<br />
partly responsible for the recession in the<br />
United States. Was he reflecting official<br />
policy in saying that?<br />
Well Mr Mosbacher always reflects official<br />
views except when I disagree with him and<br />
that is very, very seldom and on this one I<br />
haven't heard his statement so I would only<br />
want to see it in full context. But look,<br />
we have got tremendous imbalance with<br />
Japan, tremendous, and one of the reasons<br />
we are going there is to see if we can't<br />
find ways to sort that matter out. But we<br />
are enduring sluggish times and not<br />
enjoying them very much and Prime Minister<br />
has impressed on me that Australia is<br />
having difficult economic times and the<br />
answer to all of this, whether it is in<br />
Japan-US or Australia-US it is to get<br />
these economies going through expanded<br />
trade and so I want to know in context what<br />
Bob said but any time you have an<br />
extraordinarily big trade imbalance I think<br />
you would say that that would be<br />
contributing to a lack of economic growth.<br />
And so if that is what he said, I certainly<br />
couldn't find a way to differ with him.<br />
Don Woolford, Australian Associated Press<br />
Mr Bush are you able to give a commitment<br />
that irrespective of what might happen in<br />
other sectors of the Eurogray rounds the<br />
United States Government will accept<br />
nothing less in agricultural trade than has<br />
been proposed by Arthur Dunkel and Mr </p>
<p>President: Prime Minister: Keating how satisfied you are with Mr<br />
Bush's response both to our EEP submissions<br />
and to our concerns that NAFTA could under<br />
some circumstances develop into a tri-polar<br />
trading block?<br />
Let me answer, we see some very positive<br />
elements in the Dunkel paper. We certainly<br />
don't want to accept less if that was your<br />
question and there is some things there<br />
that we would like to see improved. But I<br />
do think that there has been a lot of good<br />
work done there and we will be working<br />
closely with the Europeans to try to get<br />
agreement, and I'd leave it right there<br />
because I don't want to indicate that we<br />
think that we've gotten everything that the<br />
United States wants nor do we think that<br />
the Cairns Group has gotten everything that<br />
the Cairns Group wants out of the Dunkel<br />
paper. All we're saying is its a good<br />
position from which to finalise the<br />
agricultural part of trade and the rest of<br />
it too. We have got some difficulties with<br />
some parts, agriculture we see has moved<br />
fairly well.<br />
Can I add to that, I think that the thing<br />
which is most comforting to Australia I<br />
think in answering the question, I make<br />
three points. The first is it is a matter<br />
of great comfort to us that we have an<br />
internationalist as President of the United<br />
States, someone who has committed himself<br />
to an open trading system, multilateral<br />
trading system, that resisted protectionist<br />
pressures and is committed to seeing the<br />
GATT round successfully concluded. Now as<br />
the President has said, there are elements<br />
of the GATT round that can't be, it's a<br />
package, some parts all countries would be<br />
more satisfied with than others but it is a<br />
package and it is a package about around<br />
I which we believe discussions can take<br />
place. If there is a successful conclusion<br />
of the GATT round many other things will<br />
change and including that would be, of<br />
course, mandatory windbacks under EEP which<br />
you asked me about and the President has<br />
agreed this morning that we will have an<br />
information exchange on EEP. That is, at<br />
least we will now more about the operation<br />
of EEP and as well as that we have asked<br />
him that where the US has not engaged in<br />
sales in markets where the European<br />
Commission is engaged in sales, that is in<br />
non-EEC markets would he examine those<br />
markets with a view to keeping the </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: President: subsidisation of EEP f rom them. He can'It<br />
obviously, at this point, give a clear<br />
commitment on the markets, but he has<br />
agreed to look and to examine them and we<br />
are very happy about that.<br />
So on the general point, we believe that<br />
the GATT offers the best opportunity on<br />
trade generally that the Dunkel package is<br />
just that, a package, and if adopted would<br />
lead to significant improvements in the<br />
trade and agriculture and including the<br />
impact on EEP.<br />
CNN. Mr Bush, what do you see as the<br />
consequences if Europe does not buy into<br />
Dunkel' s proposal?<br />
Well, I see that it would be very, very bad<br />
if we don't get a successful conclusion to<br />
the GATT round and we have not discussed<br />
here in Australia fall-back positions, we<br />
are not prepared to give up on the<br />
successful conclusion of the GATT round but<br />
without trying to predict disaster I can<br />
simply say I think it would be a very bad<br />
thing because I think you would see more<br />
protection, more selfishness in the trading<br />
system that would inevitably shrink markets<br />
and cost countries jobs and so we must go<br />
forward and we must try to get a successful<br />
conclusion. I feel more strongly about that since I've<br />
had the benefit of several long<br />
conversations with this Prime Minister, who<br />
is very knowledgeable on these<br />
international financial matters, and also<br />
with the agricultural sector in this<br />
country. I really had my, I'Im more highly<br />
attuned even than I was to the importance<br />
of getting this done so I don'It want to<br />
worse case it but I can just say that it<br />
would be totally unsatisfactory to see that<br />
GATT round fail to come to satisfactory<br />
conclusions. Do you see the possibility Sir, of three<br />
world trading blocs as the Prime Minister<br />
has discussed?<br />
Well, we don't want any trading blocs that<br />
don't include Australia and I went out of<br />
my way to say that as we're negotiating for7<br />
free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada<br />
for example, I want our Australian friends<br />
to know that that would not be detrimenta.<br />
to our free trade with them and one of the </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: President: things the Prime Minister and I discussed,<br />
and I'll clearly defer to him on this, : Ls<br />
the fact that we don't want to see Asia and<br />
Australia kind of pushed aside into some<br />
separate bloc so you might have an European<br />
Ntroardthi, n g Sobulothc , anadn CAmareirbibceaann tarnadd inagn bAlsoica, n'<br />
bloc. That is not the way you get more<br />
jobs. The way you do that is to have broad<br />
expanded trade between them so I don't want<br />
to predict and suggest that this would be<br />
an outcome, but it would be an outcome that<br />
we certainly would not find satisfactory.<br />
Jeremy Thompson, The Canberra Times<br />
The United Nations seems to be dragging its<br />
feet a little bit on the Cambodian peace<br />
plan, there is no concrete plan in place,<br />
no budget being put forward. Have you been<br />
asked or do you intend to urge in the<br />
United Nations that more speed be taken on<br />
these matters? Certainly Mr Hun Sinn,<br />
Prime Minister of Cambodia, is extremely<br />
concerned about this matter.<br />
Well I wasn't asked to accelerate anything<br />
on this visit. I was told by the<br />
Australian leadership of the importance of<br />
this. We feel that way. Secretary Baker,<br />
as you know, has been involved in it and we<br />
strongly support this concept that the UN<br />
acting in this peace keeping role but I<br />
wasn't asked to take on a specific<br />
assignment in that regard. But it is<br />
important with agreement having come this<br />
far that it be followed up on now, that it<br />
not be allowed to fall apart.<br />
Mr President, Democratic leaders and<br />
Congress this week said that the success or<br />
failure of the trade mission will depend on<br />
whether you obtain any major concessions<br />
from Japan. Do you agree, and at this<br />
point are you at all hopeful that you will<br />
be hopeful to obtain any major concessions.<br />
In the first place, I don't take much stock<br />
in what the Democratic leaders and what the<br />
Congress say, setting up goals for a trip<br />
or knocking them down, I'm just not<br />
inclined to run the foreign policy of the<br />
United States in that regard. It's been<br />
happening for three years and they're<br />
entitled to their opinion but that won't<br />
influence how I conduct myself on this trip<br />
and I certainly am not going to accept<br />
their standards for success or failure of a<br />
mission. Having said all that, I want to </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: President: see us get more jobs created in the United<br />
States, eventually by concessions made or<br />
by positions taken in Japan. I think it is<br />
very important and we need more access to<br />
their markets, we need to have more content<br />
in autos that are made in the United<br />
States, have US content there, have a fair<br />
shot at it, but I don't think that I should<br />
let the agenda be set by some political<br />
challenge in an election year. That is not<br />
the way one conducts sound foreign policy.<br />
I saw all kinds of crazy, well if he<br />
doesn't get this or that were going to<br />
throw in this legislation. We know<br />
political posturing when we see it, and I<br />
know what's good policy and it is to stay<br />
involved internationally and it is to<br />
create more jobs at home, not by trying to<br />
protect and pull back into some<br />
isolationistic fear but by expanding<br />
markets and that is what this trip is<br />
about. offer concessions that you consider<br />
inadequate. Are you prepared to<br />
It's too hypothetical a question, let me<br />
cut it off right there, I cannot go in'to<br />
hypothetical we haven't even gotten to<br />
Japan yet. We're still in Australia<br />
remember!<br />
Kim Griggs, Knight Ridder Financial News<br />
Mr President you refer to the sluggishness<br />
of the US economy, do you feel the recent<br />
cut and discount rate to 3.5% is sufficient<br />
to stimulate your economy and if you think<br />
extra measures are needed when would you<br />
expect to announce these?<br />
No question that it will have a stimulatory<br />
affect. It takes a while for that to get<br />
through something as complex as is the US<br />
economy but it has been very, very well<br />
received at home and I think that it is<br />
well known at home that I plan additional<br />
stimulatory measures to be announced in the<br />
State of the Union Message which comes at<br />
the end of this month and they will not be<br />
counter-productive, they will not be on the<br />
cheap politically, something that has a<br />
nice political ring to it but then would be<br />
counter-productive in terms of interest<br />
rates but I do think that the US economy<br />
could use a sound fiscal stimulation and I<br />
will be proposing that kind of a program in<br />
our State of the Union Message. But yes,<br />
this is very, very important. </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: President: ABC News. President Bush, doesn't this<br />
whole flap in Australia about agricultural<br />
subsidies in the United States, which you<br />
indicated you are not in a position at this<br />
time to abolish, undermine your<br />
credibility, Sir, when you get to Japan<br />
wearing the mantle of a free trader asking<br />
for concessions there?<br />
No, because nobody is pure. We have<br />
differences with Australia on this. I<br />
don't want to necessarily bring them up : Ln<br />
front my Australian congenial host here,<br />
but I had a chance to tell him the things<br />
I'd like to see Australia do, which we<br />
might feel could be a little less<br />
protection. He was very clear and very<br />
forceful in telling me his. I don't<br />
consider it a flap, incidentally, when you<br />
discuss an issue where you have<br />
differences. I think it's very important<br />
that the American people and the President<br />
understand how the agriculturalists in this<br />
country look at this Export Enhancement<br />
Program. And so I don't think it's<br />
contradictory at all. We've never said<br />
we're totally pure. We are working for<br />
freer and fairer trade. And certainly the<br />
Japanese should be working for freer and<br />
fairer trade. And if one country could<br />
hold up its hand and say we have never had<br />
any protection of any kind and<br />
subsidisation of any kind, that country,<br />
then, should be holier than thou, be able<br />
to make the point. We are going there into<br />
Japan and asking for equity, fairness, fair<br />
play. And so I don't think a discussion, a<br />
healthy discussion of an export program<br />
that is causing great concern in this<br />
country is either a flap or diminishes my<br />
credibility as I go into a market where we<br />
are getting real problems in terms of<br />
access.<br />
Dennis Grant, Mr Bush, from the Australian<br />
7 Network. We of course welcome you,<br />
perhaps with the observation that it only<br />
took 25 years for the White House to find a<br />
map of where we live since the last time a<br />
President visited. Following on from that<br />
question, isn't there just<br />
I'm not sure that I got that point. </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Prime Minister:<br />
President: Journalist: President: Journalist: President: Journalist: President: Prime Minist~ er: Twenty five years since we last saw an<br />
American President here.<br />
Oh, President.<br />
Held like you here more often, I think he's<br />
trying to say.<br />
Sorry, I misunderstood.<br />
Wondered if you lost the map, perhaps.<br />
Oh, I see.<br />
So, fo llowing on f rom that last question,<br />
is there not just the faintest whiff of<br />
hypocrisy here that you are demanding of<br />
the Japanese that they lower their barriers<br />
so that you can sell more motor vehicles * to<br />
them, but you impose and extend barriers on<br />
our meat and sugar in particular?<br />
No, I don't think SO. We were<br />
extraordinarily helpful in opening the<br />
Japanese markets on meat. And indeed the<br />
agricultural leaders I met with today<br />
thanked me for that. Similarly for citrus.<br />
So, besides that, I love coming to<br />
Australia so I take your point that if<br />
somebody takes that as a matter of neglect,<br />
that's too bad because this relationship is<br />
very very strong. But I'm glad to be here<br />
now and I was glad to be here as Vice<br />
President, glad to be here earlier on as a<br />
private citizen, and undoubtedly will come<br />
back. Mr President, President Miyazawa in honour<br />
of your trip, a few days in advance of your<br />
trip anyway is urging his auto makers ' to<br />
buy more US auto cars and urging consumers<br />
to buy more American cars. Do you consider<br />
that already a success for your mission, or<br />
do you think the Japanese still need to do<br />
more? Well I want to f ind out exactly what all<br />
this means, how it's going to be<br />
translated. But clearly we welcome<br />
statements of that nature. I think that's<br />
very very good, very heartening. But I<br />
have not had a chance to sit down with Mr<br />
Miyazawa and talk about that in some<br />
detail. Perhaps a couple of more questions. One on<br />
this side Michelle ( Grattan). </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: President: Prime Minis-ter:<br />
President: Journalist: Michelle Grattan, The Age. President Bush,<br />
could you just clarify this matter of<br />
consultations for us. The farmers seem<br />
very convinced you have given an<br />
undertaking to have consultations before<br />
subsidised sales. That doesn't seem -to<br />
square with what you said early in this<br />
press conference. If that's not right, you<br />
haven't gone as far as that. How does your<br />
undertaking about consultations differ from<br />
those given by your predecessor?<br />
Well I'm not sure if I understand I'm<br />
not sure what they said publicly. What<br />
they said is they, the farmers would like<br />
to come over and consult and I said come<br />
on, let's go, this would be good. And I'd<br />
like to have some American farmers there as<br />
well as Government officials. It wasn'It<br />
tied in, as far as I know, to any specific<br />
pending action under the export program.<br />
and not in relation to any future<br />
actions? They asked that there be consultation on a<br />
whole array of things. I think we're<br />
getting it mixed up a little bit with<br />
I think it's a mix up between information<br />
and the Government and also with thiLs<br />
private sector group. These farmers were<br />
there not as Government officials but<br />
wanting to come over and talk to our<br />
agricultural experts and to our farmers<br />
themselves about this whole program, and I<br />
said come on, we would welcome you. But<br />
that's where that one was left. Now the<br />
other one, I've not been able to make I<br />
think the Prime Minister let me put it<br />
this way I subscribe to the way hie<br />
phrased it.<br />
Change of pace, if I may, Sir. John<br />
Cocheran from NBC. There's a new movie<br />
called JFK which has not wafted its way<br />
down here yet, but it casts some<br />
dispersions on the findings of the Warren<br />
Commission's reports, and also it raises<br />
some questions about possibly the CIA's<br />
role in this. You're a past CIA director7.<br />
I wonder, I know you possibly haven't seen<br />
the movie, are you concerned about movies<br />
like this which may trouble people who<br />
weren'It even born at the time of John<br />
Kennedy's assassination? </p>
<p>President: Journalist: President: Journalist: President: Prime Minister:<br />
Journalist: President: Well I don't know much about the movie. I<br />
haven't seen it. And there is all kinds of<br />
conspiratorial theories floating around on<br />
everything. Elvis Presley is rumoured to<br />
be alive and well some place. And I can't<br />
say that somebody won'It go out and make a<br />
movie about that. I have seen no evidence<br />
that gives me any reason to believe that<br />
the Warren Commission was wrong. None<br />
whatsoever. And so if it is helpful to<br />
reassure the American people in this way by<br />
saying that, fine. But I don't, it<br />
wouldn't lead me to suggesting that Mr<br />
Stone be censored or something of that<br />
nature.<br />
As a former CIA director, did you ever go<br />
back in the CIA's findings during that<br />
period to satisfy any of your curiosity?<br />
About this subject?<br />
Yes. No I didn't have any curiosity because I<br />
believed that the Warren Commission, which<br />
acted what time was that finding? When<br />
was the Warren Commission finding? Was it<br />
' 63, which was about twelve years before I<br />
was out at the Agency I saw no reason to<br />
question it. Still see no reason to<br />
question it.<br />
One more, this gentleman here.<br />
AFP. You say to the Prime Minister again<br />
today to maintain a military presence in<br />
the region at an appropriate level. People<br />
in the region are not so sure. What does<br />
appropriate mean and for instance, is the<br />
ANZUS Treaty in fact dead?<br />
Well the appropriate level of security<br />
depends on conditions at the time. What I<br />
was addressing myself to was the fact that<br />
some felt that at the closing of Subic,<br />
that we would withdraw and pull away back<br />
from any possible security commitments.<br />
And I think one has to know, I can't tell<br />
you what that means in terms of keeping our<br />
security interests alive here, or keeping a<br />
military presence here. It depends on<br />
events, it depends obviously on deployments<br />
of various naval groups. But all I wanted<br />
to do was reassure the people of this area<br />
that we are not, because of the closing of<br />
Subic, that we are not pulling back from </p>
<p>Journalist: President: Journalist: President: Prime Minister: future security considerations. We are a<br />
Pacific power, we think, we know we are a<br />
Pacific trading power, and we are going to<br />
stay involved with the security concerns of<br />
our friends. I can't tell you exactly what<br />
that means in terms of troops, where<br />
they'll be, vessels, where they'll be.<br />
That depends on the situation that might<br />
exist at the time. We had a very different<br />
security deployment in the Middle East a<br />
year ago than we have today. And so things<br />
can change dramatically. But all I'm just<br />
doing is giving proper assurances that our<br />
military as well as our economic interests<br />
are still housed in the Pacific to a large<br />
degree. Do you still need the ANZUS treaty with the<br />
countries of the region?<br />
Do I what?<br />
Do you still need the ANZUS treaty?<br />
Well we still need the treaty that exists,<br />
that we refer to as ANZUS. As you know<br />
there's been some difficulties with that.<br />
There's no point in going into that now as<br />
much as this is the last question. But,<br />
nevertheless, the concept of the ANZUS is<br />
very very important to us.<br />
Important to both of us. That will do us.<br />
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you<br />
Mr President.<br />
President: Thank you very much.<br />
Minister. Thank you Prime<br />
