PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT18 AUGUST 1978<br />
INTERVIEW ON SIDE STEPS OF<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
Question: Can you categorically deny the story the<br />
allegations in the Bulletin?<br />
Prime Minister: Let me make a couple of points quite plain.<br />
Discussions that take place between Ministers in the Ministry<br />
are discussions which it has been my practice not to talk<br />
about. And let me also make two other points. In the<br />
Parliament, any question of pressure on Eric Robinson in relation<br />
to any aspect of testimony, past or present, has been<br />
denied categorically. And any question of a change of<br />
testimony has been denied categorically. Eric Robinson<br />
has confirmed that and I have confirmed that and I believe<br />
so did the Speaker. That answers the substance of<br />
the allegations completely. 000---</p>
