    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government has decided to provide additional assistance to those seriously affected by the floods.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) will be made available to those people adversely affected by the storms and associated flooding that commenced in the Mackay and Whitsunday region on 13 January and continued on to affect many areas of Queensland. </p>
<p>Those eligible will be able to receive a one off payment of $1000 for adults and $400 for each child to help relieve their hardship.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue working with the Queensland Government and local community organisations to support people affected by the recent storms and floods.</p>
<p>The workers and many volunteers in and around the affected areas must be commended for their efforts to date.</p>
<p>There will be much work to do over the coming weeks and months for these communities to fully recover.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will provide financial assistance to people whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or significantly damaged, as well as those who have been seriously injured and hospitalised for more than 48 hours as a direct result of the floods.</p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support being provided by the Australian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>Through these arrangements with the states, the Australian  Government  assists with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery operations in large scale disasters.</p>
<p>The Australian Government today also approved further financial assistance to help small businesses and farmers through the enhanced component of the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) after a request from the Queensland Premier Anna Bligh.</p>
<p> This additional assistance will provide registered small and home-based businesses, including farmers, who have experienced severe damage from floods, a grant of up to $10,000 or up to $25,000 in exceptional circumstances, depending on the extent or cost of losses.</p>
<p> For further information on assistance available for personal hardship, contact the Queensland Department of Community Services on 1800 440 074.</p>
<p>For information on the AGDRP call the Australian Government Flood Assistance Hotline on 180 2333 or visit your local Centrelink office.</p>
