PRIME MIN15TER 31/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P. 3. KEATING MP<br />
ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL<br />
Today I will be chairing the 41st meeting of the Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council since it was formed nine years<br />
ago. Looking back on those years I think few would question<br />
that the kind of thinking which the organisation has<br />
encouraged in Australia has fundamentally changed our<br />
economic debate. In 1983 it was 8 dramatic departure to<br />
discuss theb economy, as we did in the Economic Summit, in<br />
terms of a three or four year scenario. Today, three or<br />
four year scenarios are part of the budget process, and most<br />
importantly are at the centre of One Nation. The community<br />
now expects political leaders to be able to relate policies<br />
and medium term outcomes and defend their scenarios, in a<br />
way which timply did not occur in past decades.<br />
There is no doubt that the work of EPAC has contributed tothis<br />
extens3ion of our political and economic time frames.<br />
In its studies of the current account, growth prospects, the<br />
labour market, investment and other key economic variable3<br />
over the years the work of EPAC has broadened and<br />
strengthened our national economic debate. Over nine years<br />
it has produced 160 papers, including nearly 50 council<br />
papers and as many discussions papers covering most of the<br />
difficult issues we need to address in managing the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
We owe a debt of gratitude to Geoff Miller, the director of<br />
the staff from the foundation of EPAC to September 85, and<br />
to Don Challen, who succeeded him as acting director until<br />
the middle of 1986. I know everyone who worked with him with<br />
recall with admiration the work of Fred Argy, the director<br />
for over five years until his retirement last August if we<br />
can describe Fred's busy schedule these days as<br />
' 1retirement". And I want to commend Richard Whitelaw, the<br />
current acting director, for his capable administration of<br />
the staff since Fred left. </p>
<p>2<br />
EPAC and its staff have much to be proud of, but like any<br />
other institution of government it benefits from periodic<br />
reassessment. The Council meetings claim the time of a<br />
great many busy people from state governments, from business<br />
and unions, and there have been suggestions that the time is<br />
not always well spent. We sometimes discuss staff studies<br />
which could just as well be read in our own offices. We<br />
often find ourselves discussing short term issues, like the<br />
current state of the economy, when we should be focusing on<br />
medium term issues, and structural rather than cyclical<br />
problems. Because the meetings are scheduled well ahead, we<br />
often find there is no special problem to consult upon when<br />
we do meet, or no EPAC meeting scheduled when we have a<br />
problem which might benefit from wider consultation.<br />
To enable the EPAC secretariat and the Council to<br />
concentrate on medium term issues I propose that the Council<br />
should have one scheduled meeting early in each year. This<br />
will enable Council members to discuss concerns about the<br />
medium terin problems facing the Australian economy, and draw<br />
up a work program for the staff to explore the issues.<br />
Normally these studies would be published, as they have been<br />
in the past, and EPAC would also continue to encourage the<br />
discussion of working papers in academic and specialist<br />
seminars before the final study was put together. The full<br />
Council need not meet to examine these studies as they are<br />
completed -instead the Council should deputise a steering<br />
committee ' to oversee the work program of the staff and the<br />
publication of' reports.<br />
