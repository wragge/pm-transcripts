<p><strong>Journalist: </strong>Sydney appears to be dropping back</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> It's easily the prettiest city and the most attractive and the best technical bid, so why would it drop back?</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>Beijing appears to be the favourite? </p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> I'm not sure that's true. I don't think... Sydney. as a city, is a place for athletes and this is going to be a decision taken about athletes and athletics and sports. Sydney is by far the most superior place and I expect it to get up.</p>
<p>Ends. </p>
