    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have sent the following message of condolence to the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Samoa on the death of the Hon Tofilau De Eti Alesana, the former</p>
<p> Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister, Mr Downer, will represent Australia at the funeral</p>
<p> on Monday,</p>
<p>22 March 1999.</p>
<p>"I was greatly saddened to learn of the death this morning of</p>
<p> the Honourable Tofilau Dr Eti Alesana, the former Prime Minister of</p>
<p> Samoa and a widely respected elder statesman of the Pacific region.</p>
<p>His wise leadership of his country earned him both a very high regard</p>
<p> and affection from his people. He was a profoundly religious man,</p>
<p> and the courage and determination which characterised his leadership</p>
<p> of Samoa stayed with him to the end of his long battle with illness.</p>
<p>Tofilau's good judgement and advice were an important source</p>
<p> of stability also for the Pacific community. He was a good friend</p>
<p> of Australia and I will miss his effective contributions at the South</p>
<p> Pacific Forum.</p>
<p>His absence will be deeply felt amongst his own people and all those</p>
<p> in the Pacific who had dealings with him.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government and people I express my sympathy</p>
<p> to Tofilau's widow and family and to the people of Samoa.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p> John Howard"</p>
<p> 21 March 1999</p>
