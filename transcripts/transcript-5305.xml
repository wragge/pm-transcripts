    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Australia's oldest major export industry has just come"* heuDth<br />
a pointless, futile strike, which lasted eleven weeks.<br />
The wool industry has been disrupted around Australia and around<br />
the world because of the way in which a claim by the<br />
Storemen and Packers' Union was handled in the Arbitration<br />
Commission, and because the union refused to accept the final<br />
decision made by the Full Bench of the Commission.<br />
The Government had hoped the normal arbitral processes would<br />
bring the dispute to an end. The Government became involved<br />
after it was clear that one large union was employing the<br />
tactic of dividing the industry so that only sections of it<br />
felt the brunt of a national strike. Within a week of the<br />
Government's involvement, the strike was over. The industry<br />
is now actively engaged in catching up with its delayed<br />
shipments and lost orders.<br />
For the men involved there has been an enormous loss of wages.<br />
In Melbourne and Sydney, members of the Storemen and Packers'<br />
Union lost a total of 45 working days, as well as the<br />
opportunity to work at overtime or penalty rates during weekends.<br />
For these 400 workers, it will take about 10 years for them<br />
to make up their lost pay. For another 1,400 members of the<br />
Storemen and Packers' Union the loss of wages because of<br />
shorter stoppages was less, but it is nevertheless heavy. In the<br />
meantime, union officials continue to be paid.<br />
The wool dispute is a reminder that it is always worthwhile<br />
to take a stand on principle against the bullying of trade<br />
union officials.<br />
In New South Wales, the life of the community is under the<br />
threat of industrial action in the oil industry from the<br />
Transport Workers' Union. There is chronic industrial trouble<br />
in New South Wales, arising not only from the activities of<br />
trade union leaders, but also from the weakness of the<br />
Wran Labor Government.<br />
Mr. Wran has demonstrated to the trade unions that if they<br />
bring pressure, he will give in. His industrial policy is simple:<br />
it is to buy time by surrendering to trade unions without paying<br />
any heed whatsoever to the consequences, either for the rest of<br />
the country or for the future. He puts public relations<br />
before principle. / 2<br />

This climate of industrial permissiveness which Mr. Wran<br />
has created in New South Wales is one which affects the<br />
whole country, as trade union leaders move in other States<br />
to match the-gains they have made in New South Wales.<br />
In New South Wales the issue in the current dispute is that<br />
of the rights of an individual. Mr. Leon Laidely is a<br />
self-made man running a small business who has been caught<br />
between a large oil corporation and a large union. They<br />
reached an agreement which cut of f his supplies.<br />
If two corporations had agreed to refuse to supply a third<br />
party,-it would be outside the law. Should not the same<br />
principle apply when the agreement is between a big<br />
company and a big union?<br />
It is unfortunate for Mr. Laidely that he operates in a State<br />
where the Premier puts publicity ahead of good Government.<br />
The State Government has power to take action to ensure<br />
proper trading conditions for small businessmen like<br />
Mr. Laidely. Mr. Wran could have acted. He chose not to.<br />
The Government has succeeded in bringing together all the<br />
parties to this dispute, including Mr. Laidely, in thle desire<br />
to see a settlement which takes into account the interests<br />
of all parties and not just the Transport Workers' Union<br />
and the oil companies.<br />
The Government has a duty to uphold the rights of individuals<br />
and a duty to maintain an effective industrial relations<br />
framework. It is always possible to solve disputes by giving strikers<br />
what they ask for. Because of wider and fundamental<br />
implications for the Australian economy, disputes must be<br />
endedi irn a responrj apid es; mi prr<br />
The price of peace today should not be more industrial strife,<br />
higher inflation and greater unemployment tomorrow.<br />
