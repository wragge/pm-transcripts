PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PREMIER JOHN<br />
CAIN, NATIONAL TENNIS CENTRE, MELBOURNE 28 JANUARY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I am very pleased to be ablebbc~ here with the Premier<br />
of Victoria, my friend John Cain, to announce that the<br />
Federal Government has made the decision to allocate $ 125<br />
million should Melbourne be successful in its bid for<br />
the 1996 Olympics. We will make this money available,<br />
it will be indexed according to the CPI, so that we will<br />
then be joining with the Victorian Government to create<br />
a world standard sporting complex at Albert Park which<br />
will cater for many sports, including basketball, volleyball,<br />
table tennis, swimming, diving, synchronised swimming.<br />
It will be a world standard complex which will not only<br />
provide facilities for the Olympic Games, but of course<br />
will be of on-going benefit not only to the people of<br />
Victoria but Australia. It will be available for further<br />
international sporting events as well as for the people<br />
of Victoria on a continuing basis. I'm satisfied from<br />
my conversations with Mr Samaranch that Melbourne's in<br />
with a very very good chance John. I have conveyed to<br />
Mr Samaranch that the Australian Government is iully behind<br />
this bid. It has the total support of the Government<br />
and the people of Australia. I think Melbourne deserves<br />
to win.<br />
CAIN: I want to support and thank the Prime Minister<br />
for the generous offer that has been made. I welcome<br />
it. The Prime Minister himself and his Government have<br />
been very strong supporters of Melbourne's bid all the<br />
way through and I think it's properly been characterised<br />
as Australia's bid, not just Melbourne. That's one of<br />
our strengths I believe. For the Federal Government to<br />
be prepared to commit $ 125 million, dedicated to that<br />
new stadium at Albert Park is welcome news indeed. That<br />
will be a first class centre, replacing a very tired and<br />
worn out place down there where currently there is a wide<br />
range of sports played. And it will be identified with<br />
the Commonwealth's contribution. The Commonwealth I believe<br />
has when I look at the results in New Zealand the Institute<br />
of Sport is I think starting to give us the kind of results<br />
we've been looking for. Another Commonwealth initiative<br />
and supported by this Government so well. So we're delighted.<br />
Thank you very much Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Pleasure. </p>
<p>CAIN: I believe that we are in we're in the six as<br />
you all know but I believe with a first class chance.<br />
This assurance of support from the national Government<br />
I believe further enhances our very good prospects.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Cain, were you surprised that Mr Samaranch<br />
endorsed Melbourne so strongly<br />
CAIN: Well those who are around the Olympic movement<br />
have expressed to me their surprise. They know the way<br />
these things are played better than I do. I'm delighted<br />
of course, as we all are, with the very strong words that<br />
he spoke. He's been here just a short while. Yes it's<br />
good news indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Cain, if we don't get the Olympics what<br />
then happens about the Albert Park<br />
CAIN: Albert Park has been on the list for some three<br />
and a half years. But as I said, those present buildings<br />
and facilities are tired and worn out. They go back to<br />
the immediate post-war days. There have been a number<br />
of proposals put for revamping Albert Park. It will take<br />
place. Not as quickly and not with the same resources<br />
as would be the case if we are successful. But Albert<br />
Park has to be done at some time but it would not embrace<br />
the stadium of the kind 15,000 at basketball, I think<br />
10,000 at the swimming contemplation. It would not<br />
be as large as that but certainly it has to be done and<br />
we have to provide a first class swimming facility at<br />
some stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, facing an election in a couple<br />
of months it doesn't hurt to announce $ 125 million worth<br />
of spending in Melbourne and Victoria, does it?<br />
PM: I guess it doesn't but it was obviously not done<br />
for that reason. You're loading the cynicism on a bit.<br />
It is the fact that Mr Samaranch is here. The eyes of<br />
the world are focussed on Australia now and the sooner<br />
that Mr Samaranch and the Olympic Committee are able to<br />
know that the full financial support of the Commonwealth<br />
Government, together with the State Government and the<br />
Melbourne City Council is focussed on this bid the better.<br />
It would've been a bit silly to be leaving it till September<br />
wouldn't it?<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when are you going to announce<br />
an election date?<br />
PM: Not today Josephine.<br />
JOURNALIST: I just thought you might tell me.<br />
PM: Not even for you mate. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, your comments about today's Sunday<br />
Herald poll, rise in the popularity of Mr Howard<br />
Mr Peacock?<br />
PM: Well, they're just they were hurdy gurdy Mr<br />
Peacock's turn in the leadership for this six months<br />
and now the question is will it be Mr Howard before or<br />
after the election I mean they're just in and out, in<br />
and out, one after the other. And the poll was fascinating.<br />
When Mr Howard is in he is desperately unpopular and Mr<br />
Peacock becomes popular. Shove Mr Peacock reverse,<br />
he becomes unpopular and Howard by comparison starts to<br />
look good. I mean all it shows is the absolute dearth<br />
of talent they've got. They just swap one for the other<br />
and when the one that's in is down and the one that's<br />
out is up<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, we must all be very pleased with<br />
the results of Australia in New Zealand at the moment,<br />
but what support can the Federal Government offer the<br />
athletes who come back from those Games? We had the..<br />
in the Olympic Games where they came back and all those<br />
athletes were out of work, couldn't find jobs. What sort<br />
of support<br />
PM: Don't you read the newspapers and see the Budget<br />
decisions?<br />
JOURNALIST: But I mean what sort of<br />
PM: Why? I mean you're making comparisons between now<br />
and after the last Olympics. I mean what I suggest is<br />
that you catch up with the decisions that have been taken,<br />
made now probably a year ago I think. Decisions that<br />
have been taken that address that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, back on elections. Do you think<br />
that the Opposition's bungling of the health policy has<br />
helped you<br />
PM: Well obviously it must be a plus. Not just the bungling<br />
but we have now out of the mouths of the Opposition spokesman<br />
himself, Mr Shack, the statement that they are no good<br />
on health. He said we have got a bad record. Now we've<br />
been saying that and we've been right. But when they<br />
say it themselves, there it is. He said we've got a bad<br />
track record. And they're no better. If anything, they're<br />
getting worse. They're now saying we've had seven years<br />
in opposition and we can't produce a policy. We've told<br />
you lies, because you know chapter and verse where they've<br />
got up and said the details are completed, the costings<br />
are made, all we've got to do is announce it. Now they've<br />
been deceptive, they've been incompetent and they are<br />
irrelevant to the needs of Australia. For this mob to<br />
be getting up and to be talking about they are concerned<br />
for the families of Australia and they can't provide a<br />
health policy, is a devastating indictment of them. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you think Mr Peacock has abandoned Mr<br />
Shack? PM: I'd say Mr Shack seems to have abandoned Mr Peacock.<br />
I mean that's what opposition policy is about in this<br />
place. They're all the time abandoning one another.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I ask a sporting question?<br />
PM: It's been open to you if you wanted to before. I<br />
don't JOURNALIST: As a betting man who's going to win the final<br />
today? PM: My money would be on Mr Lendl.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why?<br />
P PM: Because of my feeling that he's going to win, which<br />
is based upon the fact he's been here for a long time,<br />
he's had a rather longer in-house preparation if I can<br />
put it that way. But it wouldn't surprise me if it went<br />
the other way. Being a betting man I wouldn't bet a lot<br />
of money on it but if I had to bet it would be on Mr Lendl.<br />
JOURNALIST: At a time when Australia present its<br />
best face in terms of its ability to organise major international<br />
sporting events, are you concerned, considering recent<br />
shambles involving the motor cycle grand prix WVicVN ovexseas<br />
quite ridiculous.<br />
PM: Does it? I haven't had a lot of reports coming back<br />
from overseas that the overseas people feel that it looks<br />
ridiculous. I mean I haven't had that being reported<br />
to me. But I<br />
JOURNALIST: consider try and sort it out?<br />
PM: No, this is a matter that is not within my jurisdiction.<br />
We've got enough which is constitutionally within my jurisdiction<br />
where I do have to make decisions without capriciously<br />
and gratuitously intervening where it's not my role.<br />
JOURNALIST: some discussions about the participation<br />
of South African players at the Open tennis here, with<br />
a view towards the Olympics. Can you give us your views<br />
on that, whether or not<br />
PM: The position is quite simple as far as the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia and the Commonwealth of Nations is concerned.<br />
We have the Gleneagles agreement and under that agreement<br />
which we adhere to and implement, people who are representing<br />
South Africa are not encouraged but are allowed to participate.<br />
Where they're not representing their country then they<br />
can be there. I think that what we should be saying about<br />
South Africa at the moment is what the Commonwealth Heads </p>
<p>of Government said in Kuala Lumnpur last year, and that<br />
is that we should positively welcome the signs that are<br />
to some extent evident in South Africa that there may<br />
be some move towards change. But this is not the time,<br />
precisely not the time to ease up the pressures that the<br />
world have upon Routh Africa because we want to see a<br />
position as soon as possible in South Africa where it<br />
moves to an end to the abhorrent system of apartheid and<br />
to a democratic multi-racial society. It is quite clear<br />
because it has come out of the mouths of the South Africans<br />
themselves that the sporting and economic sanctions that<br />
have been applied to South Africa have played a part in<br />
the changes that are beginning to appear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Cain, with regard to the Albert Park complex,<br />
there are no provisions for a velodrome. Would Mr Hawke<br />
be prepared to go another $ 10 million to pop in a velodrome<br />
for the bike riders?<br />
CAIN: The velodrome used to be part of the Showground's<br />
complex and is a separate facility from the facility at<br />
Albert Park. The velodrome is taken care of. You understand<br />
that there's about $ 480 million that we can best calculate<br />
that will be spent of capital funds by us on all the facilities.<br />
The $ 125 million from the Commonwealth is a substantial<br />
contribution to that. The velodrome is in the 480. The<br />
exact cost of that I can't tell you. I can find out for<br />
you. The velodrome is separate and quite distinct from<br />
Albert Park.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much do you stand to gain financially<br />
from CAIN: Well the best advice we can get is that with all<br />
the economic activity that comes from the Games, the jobs<br />
that are created, $ 7.8 billion in 1989 dollars was the<br />
figure we were given. In terms of goodwill already as<br />
being a candidate city it's enormous I believe. Just<br />
being, having a world stage presence as a candidate city,<br />
staging the Games I think it brings enormous spin-offs<br />
that can't be quantified. We're flat out to get it.<br />
JOURNALIST: We have 70% of the facilities needed to hold<br />
the Olympics. You don't think we'll be over-complexed?<br />
CAIN: No I don't. We wouldn't have gone into this unless<br />
we were satisfied<br />
PM: inaudible<br />
CAIN: That's the strength we have I believe. It's demonstrable<br />
that the facilities that are already in existence and<br />
will be improved and those that will be provided will<br />
be used in the future. If you look at the details of<br />
the release you will see that there's an Olympic mode<br />
so far as the Albert Park is concerned. There's an ongoing<br />
mode where the public use is considerable. Just like </p>
<p>this place. As the book on this place says, you and I<br />
and everybody else can have a game of tennis here for<br />
all but two weeks of the year. That'll be the same with<br />
those facilities.<br />
JOURNALIST: any further requests to the Federal Government<br />
for money?<br />
CAIN: There's constant requests. We take them as they<br />
come in their order, don't we Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Let me just make this point about the Commonwealth<br />
participation. We're not only providing $ 125 million<br />
but with a range of Commonwealth services that will be<br />
provided in the quarantine area and protective areas.<br />
An estimate of that is probably worth about another $ 100<br />
million. So we're in there boots and all.<br />
CAIN: Probably there in I can assure you.<br />
