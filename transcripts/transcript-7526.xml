PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, CYPRUS COMMUNITY CLUB OF NSW, SYDNEY<br />
12 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when do you hope to have these<br />
immigration policies up and running?<br />
PM: Which immigration policies?<br />
JOURNALIST: These new ones that you mentioned today, these<br />
multicultural PM: I didn't mention any new immigration policy. What I<br />
said was there was a National Agenda for multicultural<br />
Policies and we've established the Committee which has<br />
brought in the preliminary report. That's now being further<br />
analysed and we'll give further consideration to that<br />
program during this year with the full involvement of the<br />
representatives of the various ethnic communities in the<br />
country.<br />
JOURNALIST: In Canberra today Dr Hewson says that the<br />
opposition when in government will introduce a consumption<br />
tax. What's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: There's two things that are interesting, three things<br />
are interesting about Dr Hewson's intereview this morning.<br />
Firstly, the promise yet again that they're going to detail,<br />
give details of the cuts in expenditure. As soon as we've<br />
brought down our April statement he unequivocally committed<br />
the opposition to bringing down details of their cuts. Now<br />
we've all been longing and waiting to hear what it is<br />
they're going to cut. Is it education, roads, defence? The<br />
obligation is on them now to tell the Australian community<br />
where those cuts are going to come. That's the first<br />
interesting point. The second you raised that he's<br />
obviously made it clear to the Australian people that a<br />
consumption tax is on the agenda as far as the Liberals are<br />
concerned. The third is obviously the gulf that exists<br />
between various factions in the Opposition. He's saying<br />
there'll be the cuts but there are other noises that are<br />
being made, we won't necessarily tell you at all what we're<br />
going to do. We'll let you go up to an election without any<br />
details of what we stand for as opposition. The final<br />
comment therefore to make about all those things when you<br />
consider the points I've made is what Dr Hewson is talking<br />
about is fairy land stuff, what they would do in government. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
They haven't got the guts, the competence, the wit, the<br />
intelligence to get a policy together and they've had<br />
six years. They're still as far away as ever and that's why<br />
he's talking totally hypothetically, totally fairy land.<br />
They will not be getting into government.<br />
