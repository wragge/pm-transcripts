PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
The following is the text of a message from the Prime<br />
Minister sent to HE Mr Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister<br />
of the Republic of Turkey.<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of<br />
Australia I wish to express to you my condolences<br />
over the recent mine disaster near Kozlu.<br />
News of this terrible disaster has deeply shocked<br />
the Australian people and has brought particular<br />
sadness to our large Turkish population. We<br />
sincerely hope that it may yet be possible to find<br />
more survivors.<br />
I pass on to you and the relatives of the victims<br />
the deepest sympathy of the Australia people.<br />
