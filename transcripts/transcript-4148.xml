PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS9 JUNE 1976<br />
U. S. BICENTENNIAL GIFT OF KOALA BEARS<br />
Australia will present six Koala Bears to the people<br />
of America as part of our programme for the celebrationof<br />
the U. S. Bicentennial.<br />
The bears which have been bred in captivity at the Lone<br />
Pine Sanctuary in Brisbane, will be housed at the<br />
renowned San Diego Zoo in California, where they will<br />
be seen by 3,500,000 people who visit the Zoo each year.<br />
An initial gift of Koalas was made to the zoo in the<br />
early 1950' s but with the passage of time the colony<br />
was now reduced to three aged female Bears.<br />
The San Diego climate is well suited to the Bears<br />
and there are plenty of eucalyptus trees to provide food.<br />
The San Diego Zoo has an excellent record of caring<br />
for its colony of Koalas.<br />
Present keepers pla-ns-are for the bears to travel with their<br />
by Qantas aircraft late in July.<br />
