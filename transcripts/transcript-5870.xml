FAREWELL DINNER FOR SIR ZELMAN COWEN<br />
It is a great pleasure for all of us to be with you and<br />
Lady Cowen this evening. I know that Australians everywhere<br />
join with us in congratulating you on the successful way in<br />
which you have carried out the duties of Governor-General<br />
and in thanking you for the contribution you have made to<br />
the public life of our country during your term of office.<br />
Your Excellency, you camne to the office of Governor-General<br />
with a distinguished record as an academic, a Vice-Chancellor<br />
of two universities, and as~ a lawyer, and with an unusual<br />
breadth of experience.<br />
By looking through a list of your publications it is easy<br />
to see what a broad range of interests you have. You have<br />
written a number of'notable biographies including a biography<br />
of the first. Australian born Governor -General, Sir Isaac Isaacs3,<br />
and papers ont issues as wide-ranging as the law, education,<br />
Commonwealth and international affairs. And I note<br />
you have written one paper with the rather unusual title<br />
of " From the Trial of Lady Chatterly to the Trial of Oz".<br />
Your broad initerests and your background as a notable<br />
constitutional lawyer have enabled you to serve as Governor-<br />
General not o~ nly with distinction, but with aknowledge and<br />
true understanding of the importance of the office of<br />
Governor-General. It is an office which is of great<br />
significance to Australians. As the Queen's representative,<br />
the Governor--General must perform the duties of the Crown<br />
with impartiality, and with dedication to the community.<br />
The Queen has set an example to all her representatives<br />
in that. re -spect. I think you, Your Excellency, have followed<br />
her example iLn a way which has helped ensure that Australians<br />
will retain -their faith and support for our constitution and<br />
for the continuation of the role of the Crown in our constitution.<br />
It should also be said that your determination to remain above<br />
national debates has won you the respect and admiration of<br />
people from both sides of politics. You yourself, Sir,<br />
said only yesterday that to describe the Office of Governor-<br />
General as a rubber stamp was ani " uninformed and f~ oolish<br />
statement". I agree wholeheartedly with you. The constitution<br />
provides the ultimate protection of the liberties and rights<br />
of individual Australians. There are many ways in which the<br />
Governor-General by deliberate decision of our forefathers is<br />
the custodia~ n of those rights. * Tvrthermore,' as President of the<br />
Executive Council he can have an influence on the thinking<br />
of Ministers and play a part in making sure they discharge<br />
their responsibilities in'the best interests of the community. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
But the role of Governor-General extends beyond the<br />
constitutional and ceremonial duties of the office. It is the<br />
mark of a notable Governor-General that he has been able to<br />
influence the community intellectually as a catalyst of ideas<br />
and thought.<br />
Your Excellency, your many speeches on a wide number of subjects<br />
have done-just that. They have been stimulating, thought<br />
provoking and widely appreciated by the community. You have<br />
shown intellectual leadership and an ability to generate<br />
new ideas, and that has always been done with a national<br />
perspective, thereby drawing Australians together as<br />
a nation.<br />
I would also like to mention the very arduous programme<br />
of public engagements you have undertaken. You have<br />
travelled very widely around Australia, and have had a great<br />
deal of contact with a large number of Australians. You<br />
have brought the office of Governor-General to people in<br />
every corner of the continent, and even to the Cocos and<br />
Christmas Islands. I am sure that the community has been<br />
grateful for the way you have involved yourself in its day to<br />
day life and that the Office of Governor-General has<br />
benefited as a result.<br />
All these things have added up to one very important achievement.<br />
That is you have helped to bring together Australians as a<br />
nation, to help them look on themselves as part of a nation,<br />
not as separate, parochial communities and to ' Aielp people of<br />
different ideologies or opinions realise that they have,<br />
in the end, one great cause, and that is Australia. You<br />
said in your Australia Day Message in 1978 that the<br />
Governor-General had the task of serving the Queen and the<br />
nation " as a symbol of unity of all the people". In achieving<br />
that, you have served the nation well.<br />
I would also like to say what a great contribution Lady Cowen<br />
has made to the office of Governor-General and Australia by<br />
her active involvement in a number of areas, in particular<br />
in welfare, and she has made a significant personal<br />
contribution to public life in Australia.<br />
Your Excellency, earlier this year you said th~ at Australians<br />
must " concentrate our minds powerfully on what it is that<br />
keeps us together". You, Sir, have done a great deal to<br />
help us do that. On behalf of all Australians I wish<br />
you well in your new position as provost of Oriel College,<br />
Oxford. It is aposition I know you will find challenging<br />
and stimulating. 000-</p>
