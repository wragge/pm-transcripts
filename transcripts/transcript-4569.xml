SYDNEY CAMPAIGN RALLY, ST MARY'S 29 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
As the Election Campaign enters into its second last weeki the<br />
choice facing Australians is clear. The Government's policies<br />
arc restoring Australia to ful~ l economic recovery, through our<br />
great nation's growth and development; through development of<br />
our natural resources; through growth of our industries and<br />
through incentives to individual Australians to use their<br />
abilities to the full.<br />
But while we stand for the growth and development of Australia,<br />
Labor offers nothing but the growth and development of big<br />
government, and the death of incentive. Wle offer a strategy for<br />
economic recovery which is succeeding. We have halved Labor's<br />
inflation inflation is now down to about 9% and falling. It<br />
should be down to between 6/ 7% by mid ] 978. We have achieved<br />
this because of our restraint of Government spending and odr policy<br />
for wage moderation.<br />
Now interest rates are falling. Wle have brought about the first<br />
consistent downward movement in government interest rates in more<br />
than four years, and I am confident with present government<br />
policies continuing that interest rates could fall up to 2% within<br />
the next twelve months. This will have a significant effect on the<br />
housing industry.<br />
On an average new building society loan of $ 26,000 a two percent reduction<br />
in interest is a saving of $ 520 a year that is ten dollars a week<br />
for young people starting their new home. Wle are encouraging investment<br />
and providing incentive to Australians to work hard and earn more.<br />
Our taxation concesssions to business and mining have boosted private<br />
investment. Our foreign investment guidelines protect Australia's<br />
vital interests, but are flexible enough, and clear enough to attract<br />
greatly increased sum of foreign capital. This private investment<br />
revival is already well under way.<br />
In the September quarter, there was a strong increase of 6.6% ( seasonally<br />
adjusted) in private capital spending. The statistician's survey of<br />
expected capital spending in the present half year to December, shows<br />
a growth of fourteen percent. We must maintain the policies which<br />
encouraged this recovery, and which will allow it to gather pace.<br />
Our tax cuts for individuals relieve pressure for wage increases and<br />
boost consumrer demand. Our historic tax reforms tax indexation and 7 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
reform of the tzx scales have benefitted all taxpayers at all<br />
levels of income. Contrary to PMr Vhitlam' s loud poettos u<br />
tax reforms have. not redistributed su:-, s fromr one section of the<br />
community to another, except that 225,00) low income earners, including<br />
tens of thousands of pensioners, widows, students, and others will<br />
no longer have to pay tax.<br />
There has however been a fund1amental distribution from the Government's<br />
coffers to the private sector. Next financial year, under our reforms,<br />
which are now law, taxpayers will pay some $ 4,000 million less tax<br />
than under the old Hayden tax scales. Our tax reforms provide a. new<br />
incentive to work by putting 902 of taxpayers on the same marginal<br />
rate. Under the Hayden tax scale of 1975, once a person's income reached<br />
$] 0,000 a year he paid tax of 45 cents from each extra dollar of<br />
earnings. If Mr. Hayden's tax rates were still in force, a person<br />
on average weekly earnings would be losing 45 cents in tax from each<br />
' extra dollar of earnings.<br />
Compare this with our new standard rate system of tax. Taxpayers on<br />
$] 0,000 a year will pay a marginal rate of only 32 cents, and they<br />
can increase their income up to $] 16,000 a year without moving on to a<br />
higher marginal rate of tax.<br />
The tangible results of the success of these policies is there to see.<br />
Yesterday I announced the details of $ 6,000 million development<br />
projects which are either underway or ready to go. These projects<br />
will bring work to Australia. Mr. Whitlam. is rather foolishly<br />
trying to deny, that these projects exist.<br />
On Sunday, he said that the North West Shelf was worth only half of the<br />
six billion dollars of investment to which I had been referring and the<br />
rest somehow did not really exist. He must now be sorely regretting<br />
this gaffe.<br />
In fact, the three billion dollar North West Shelf Development is not<br />
even part of the six billion dollars of development. It's additional to<br />
the six billion dollars as are many other projects worth billions of<br />
dollars, which may well proceed in the medium to long term. It is<br />
through our policies of growth and development that we will overcome<br />
the unemployment problem imposed on Australia. Labor increased unemployment<br />
by ] 157%, almost 200,000 people, in one year. And Labor did not<br />
just increase unemployment. It was not just that new entrants to the<br />
workforce could not find jobs, the total number of people in work<br />
actually fell.<br />
We have reversed this treAd. Over the two years to August 1977, total<br />
employment rose by ] 80,000. One vital reason for this is that<br />
we are prepared to give Australian industry the protection it needs. Laboi<br />
slashed tariffs across the board, even though they were advised that this<br />
-would throw tens of thousands out of work..<br />
On 27 June 1973, Mr. Whitlam directed that a report be prepared on<br />
increasing imports into Australia. He wanted that report within 3 weeks.<br />
On 15 July he received the report. Only three-days later, he implemented<br />
a 25% across the board tariff cut. He didn't even show the report to<br />
his Cabinet, and he waited weeks before tabling it in the Parliament. .3/ </p>
<p>He waited until the Budget session and tried to lose it amongst the mass<br />
of other Budget papers. And no wonder. The report clearly stated<br />
that a 25% across the board tariff cut would cost tens of thousands<br />
of Australian jobs. It went through industry after industry showing<br />
how unemployment would be caused. But Whitlam went ahead anyway.<br />
He was the only Prime Minister in Australian history to make unemployment<br />
a deliberate act of policy.<br />
Mr. Whitlam has learnt nothing. As recently as July he told the<br />
. natlonal Press Club:<br />
" There is no doubt that Australian industry is excessively protecte<br />
protected that is the basic trouble with our manufacturing<br />
industry in Australia."<br />
The fact is that Mr. Whitlain was, and remains, the unemployment expert!<br />
This Government has reversed Labor's disastrous tariff policies.<br />
Our policies have protected Australian industry while at the<br />
same time having significant success in the fight against inflation.<br />
We have increased protection for industries with a total employment<br />
6 over a quarter of a million Australians, major industries, such<br />
as motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, textiles, plywood and<br />
irany others.<br />
Decisions have been taken to protect the textiles, clothing and footwear<br />
industries for three years. And Ian Macphee, the Minister for<br />
Productivity, is undertaking a cooperative study with all involved<br />
in those industries, management and unions, to see how efficiency<br />
and productivity can be increased during that period.<br />
It was in the light of the disastrous recommendations set out in the<br />
I. A. C. draft report on clothing, textiles and footwear, and the<br />
failure of that and other I. A. C. reports to comply with the Government's<br />
policy objectives, that we decided to change the law governing the<br />
I . A. C.<br />
We introduced legislation into Parliament to require the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission to take into account, in making its recommendations,<br />
employment in industries seeking protection.<br />
The I. A. C. will explicitly have to report on the assistance necessary<br />
to maintain present levels of activity in each industry which they<br />
examine, how each industry's structure might be improved, and the<br />
effects of its recommendations on employment in decentralised locations. </p>
<p>Under this government goods required by the Commonwealth<br />
a re purchased from Australian man u fa ctL. uror s this is in<br />
sharp contrast to the Labor government which bought in the<br />
cheapstmakets versas. e have introduced investment<br />
allowances to enable Australian industry to modlernise the<br />
equipment to reduce costs.<br />
All these policies arr designed to boost Australian industryand<br />
thus boost jobs for Australians. Our training and<br />
job assistance schemes are helping young people in particular<br />
to learn new skills and already well over 120,000 people<br />
have been or are being helped by these schemes.<br />
We have decided that no strict finanacial constraints will be<br />
placed on these programmes. No one eligible for any of these<br />
programmes will be turned away. And I should say that from<br />
February unemployment will fall and keep on steadily falling.<br />
The tax cuts which will commence on 1 Feburary just two months<br />
away will increase household income and spending power<br />
injecting an extra $ 26.7 million a week into the economy.<br />
Because this injection takes place at a time when inflation i. s<br />
declining steeply, the tax cuts will have a positive<br />
impact on jobs. They will lift consumer spending and because<br />
inflation is lower, Australian manufacturers will be in a<br />
much better position to compete with imports in meeting the<br />
risingdemand. Our factories will get larger-orders and start working at higher<br />
levels of capacity. As that development gets under way, there<br />
willbe a demand for more employees. Investment expenditure<br />
will continue to grow in response to this more optimistic outlook.<br />
The February tax cuts are an integral part of the Government's<br />
plan for continued, steady economic recovery. Labor offers<br />
no alternative to our policies. Labor has no coherent economic<br />
s trategy. Labor cannot even decide who the principal economic<br />
; 7pokesmenshould be. Just last month Mr Hurford said he<br />
would be charged with economic management by a Labor government.<br />
Now Mr Hayden is claiming that he will be " the Minister in charge<br />
of economic management". Mr Whitlam also says that Mr Willis<br />
is partly responsible for economic management. D-Lr Hawke<br />
insists in having his say. And of course Mr Whitlam himself<br />
still stumibles into this area from time to time.<br />
The conflicts and antics that have erupted between this unhappy<br />
quintet during the past weeks would have provided considerable<br />
entertainmentas sheer burlesque Were it not for the fact that<br />
what they have been arguing over is our taxes, our well being,<br />
our financial survival.<br />
Labor would recall Parliament to repeal the tax reforms so vital<br />
t o economic recovery and the creation of new jobs and it is now<br />
clear they would do more. They would abolish tax indexation too,<br />
burdeningthe average family man with higher taxes $ 6 a week<br />
higher taxes, over $ 300 a year higher taxes. Yet they have<br />
spentover a week trying to hide their confusion on this vital </p>
<p>subject. Last Sunday week, Mir Whitiam said tax indexation<br />
would be postponed. By Monday, 1r Wh-itlam and Mr Willis<br />
agreed that Labor would bring in full tax indexation by July.<br />
By Wednesday morning Mr Hayden was saying Labor could not<br />
commit itself beyond half tax indexation. And Mr Hurford<br />
said he could not say what the Party's policy was, as he had<br />
not read about it in the papers. By Wednesday evening, Ir Hayden<br />
and Mr Hurford were disowning even half indexation.<br />
By Sunday, , r Whitlam said he agreed with whatever Mr Hurford<br />
had said. Apparently by that he meant the last thing<br />
Mr Hurford said, whatever that was. Today, we saw<br />
another act of Labor adhocery.<br />
Mr Hurford the Shadow Treasurer, or whatever he is of the<br />
Labor Party... you know, that party of social concern<br />
realised Labor's tax schemes would harm 225,000 low income<br />
earnersincluding tens of thousands of pensioners. So he put<br />
forward another tax plan because the Labor Party is concerned<br />
with helping those in need so he said. Labor is so concerned<br />
with those in need that until we pointed out how our taxation<br />
reforms helped them, Labor ignored the disadvantaged completely.<br />
But what does Mr Hurford's after-thought do for those in need?<br />
Exactly nothing.<br />
It does not reduce taxes for low income earners by a single cent.<br />
Because our tax cuts are already law. Mr Hurford wants<br />
increases in tax for everyone, except those with incomes<br />
under $ 3,750. Even for. them, he only proposes an ad hoc scheme<br />
whichwill last for just five months in 1978-79. After that,<br />
these pensioners and others would be worse off, than under<br />
our existing legislation.<br />
The confusion and division amongst Labor spokesmen on how they<br />
would take thousands of millions of dollars more tax from Australia<br />
is only matched by their complete disarray on wages policy.<br />
In his policy speech MrWhitlam made the deliberately cryptic<br />
remark that Labor would restore integrity to wage<br />
indexation guidelines. For the next week, Australians witnessed<br />
the spectacle of Mr Whitlam and Mr Hayden slugging it out<br />
as to the true meaning of this secret formula. Mr Hayden<br />
would say on one radio programme Labor's policy was for full<br />
indexation up to average weekly earnings., while on another<br />
programme, Mr Whitlam would be saying he wanted full wage<br />
indexation for everyone. This was all too much for Mr Hawke<br />
whopointed out with brutal frankness that from a Labor government<br />
the unions would accept nothing less than full wage indexation<br />
regardless of the consequences for unemployment of such an extreme<br />
policy. </p>
<p>In a final effort to resolve the situation, the various Labor<br />
Party factions represented by Mrl ilaw,-e, Mr Ilur ford, Mr Hayden<br />
Mr Combe and Mr Willis conferred by telephone apparently<br />
Mr Whitlam. was excluded because his opinion was not<br />
considered important enough As a result of that conference,<br />
Mr Hawke appointed himself spokesman and outlined what he<br />
termed the " absolute consensus" of the five sp~ okesmen.<br />
The degree of consensus reached can be measured by the fact that<br />
M~ r Hawke then proceeded to contradict himself three times<br />
within the space of one page stattcmi~ ent. First, he said<br />
Labor would have wage indexation up to average weekly earnings.<br />
Second, he said Labor mightL not advocate indexation above that<br />
level. Third, by the end of the statement, he was asserting<br />
that " a Labor government would be arguing quite clearly<br />
before the Arbitration Commission that its general principle<br />
was for full and automatic indexation for everyone."*<br />
Wages policy is an essential element of economic policy yet<br />
thereis now total confusion on what Labor's policy is.<br />
Labor's mish-mash of conflicting policies on tax and wage<br />
indexationi, indicates how little they have thought through<br />
any of their economic policies. This is clear when their<br />
varicus unemployment schemes are examined in any detail.<br />
only the present members of the Labor Party would seriously<br />
put forward a plan to rip huge sums in taxes from ordinary<br />
Australians and use them to pay big companies.<br />
What a betrayal of the working men and women of Australia.<br />
Let's look at what some of tChe big companies would get.<br />
Mr Uren's pet hate, Utah would get a windfall of $ 2 million..<br />
Others to do well would include:<br />
CRA $ 10 million<br />
BHP $ 33 million<br />
HIM 4.5 million<br />
CSR 8 million<br />
Bank of NSW $ 11 million<br />
Ford 7 million<br />
ACI $ 11 million<br />
Dunlop $ 11-13 million<br />
General Motors $ 10 million<br />
Labor simply did not think this scheme through.<br />
A survey last week or large employers showed that not one<br />
could forecast any in~ crease in their own employment levels<br />
if relieved of payroll tax.<br />
Yet Labor should not be surprised. The Premier of South Australia,<br />
Mr Dunstan, made it clear in September that a payroll remission<br />
scheme does not work. / 7 </p>
<p>He has tried it in South Australia with no result.<br />
Unlike the Labor Party , the gov,. rnment has maintained<br />
consistent responsible policies to restore Australia to economriic<br />
health. We have a unitced Cabinet, a strong backbench, and most<br />
important of all, the ideas arid the policies to take Australia<br />
forwardstrongly into the eightieS. Many of these policies<br />
were referred to in my Policy Speech last week.<br />
Ishall mention just a few of particular relevance to this city.<br />
We are concerned at the low standards of urban public transportand<br />
we are expanding our programme of financial assistance to<br />
improve city train and bus services. Our new five-year prog<br />
national water resources programme will help to improve urban'<br />
and rural water supplies. Our promise to abolish Federal<br />
estate and gift duties will save thousands of families distress<br />
and financial hardship. We are going to give telephone<br />
subscribersa new deal by reducing chiarges for off-peak<br />
long distance calls to about 40 percent of normal rates.<br />
The Minister, Eric Robinson,' has initiated an examination<br />
by Telecom into the extension of local call access to capital<br />
cities from nearby areas such as the Penrith area, and comparable<br />
areas near Melbourne and Brisbane.<br />
There are. many more initiatives which I commend to you they<br />
are all set out with detailed costing, in the Policy Speech<br />
and supplementary statement published with. it. ' They form in<br />
total a creative programnme of policies, within a responsible<br />
financial framework.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we have made great proftressin the last<br />
two years, in restoring Australia to economic health, in<br />
reviving initiative and enterprise, in protecting those<br />
genuinelyin need, in getting our great nation moving again.<br />
If-' s* been hard work but we are now seeing the tangible<br />
results of that work. Australia is about to enter into a new era<br />
of growth and prosperity. The fundamental question which<br />
this election will decide is whether we will build on the<br />
achievementswhich we have made, or whether Labor will be allowed<br />
tothrow it away.<br />
On December 10 1 am confident thatAustralians will recognise<br />
that we have been doing the job we were elected to do, and<br />
we'll be doing the job for Australia for another three years. </p>
