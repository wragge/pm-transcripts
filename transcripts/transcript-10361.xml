26 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
OPENING ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN RECONCILIATION<br />
CONVENTION MELBOURNE<br />
E&amp; O E<br />
Thank you very much. To Patrick Dodson, the Chairman of the Council, to Your<br />
Excellency, the Governor of Victoria, Sir James Gobbo; the Premier of Victoria, Mr<br />
Jeff Kennett; Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition; Senator Kernot; other<br />
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Can I say how very pleased I am to be here today to formally open this convention and<br />
let me also thank the Kuhin people for the warmth and generosity of their welcome.<br />
This Convention is a unifying event. It is an occasion for positive commitment to the<br />
ffiture and a common avowal of the destiny we all share as Australians. It is an<br />
occasion also for frank speaking and there has been some today quite appropriately<br />
and in the same spirit I intend to speak frankly although I hope on all occasions<br />
respectfully. Since the inception of the Council in 1991, the Coalition Parties have committed<br />
themselves to the reconciliation process and today, on behalf of the Liberal and<br />
National parties, I reaffirm that commitment.<br />
At the heart of this reconciliation process among Australians lies three fundamental<br />
objectives: * the first is a shared commnitment to raise the living standards and broadening the<br />
opportunities available to the most disadvantaged group in Australian society and<br />
that is indigenous Australians and that must be done as part of a broader<br />
commitment to providing equality of opportunity to all Australians </p>
<p>a second objective is a realistic acknowledgment of the inter-related histories of the<br />
various elements of Australian society;<br />
and a third is a mutual acceptance of the importance of working together to respect<br />
and appreciate our differences and to ensure that they do not prevent us from<br />
sharing the fuiture.<br />
In meeting these challenges, the reconciliation process must focus on the fuiture in a<br />
positive and principled way. Specific strategies need to be devised, specific priorities<br />
need to be identified and specific practical programmes need to be agreed and<br />
implemented. This process quite properly will generate debate and in some areas<br />
genuine differences of opinion amongst people of goodwill about competing priorities.<br />
I hope that all who participate in this convention can find important areas of common<br />
ground on the best way of achieving the broad goals to which the reconciliation<br />
process is committed.<br />
As Patrick has reminded us the Convention has been preceded by over 100 formal<br />
meetings attended by more than 10,000 people. Many of these meetings have focussed<br />
on what people in their own communities can do to advance the cause of<br />
reconciliation. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of true reconciliation.<br />
Governments and leaders alone cannot make reconciliation happen simply through<br />
legislation, decrees, declarations or rhetoric. True reconciliation must come from the<br />
hearts and minds of the Australian people, in the respect they have for differences, in<br />
the attitudes they encourage in their children, and in their recognition of the common<br />
destiny we share together as Australians.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I am an optimist about the process of national reconciliation in<br />
Australia. I am an optimist about reconciliation because I believe in the decency, tolerance,<br />
generosity and common sense of the Australian people.<br />
I am an optimist because I know that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
are committed to preserving their unique culture at the same time as reaching out to<br />
non-indigenous Australians to build a shared future.<br />
I am an optimist because I believe that the Australian people respect the right to a ' fair<br />
go' for all irrespective of colour, background or belief, and I am an optimist because I<br />
believe that these attributes have made Australia one of the fairest, most egalitarian and<br />
tolerant societies in the world.<br />
But this optimism, my friends, about the reconciliation process cannot be blind. We<br />
must be realistic in acknowledging some of the threats to reconciliation.<br />
Reconciliation will not work if it puts a higher value on symbolic gestures and<br />
overblown promises rather than the practical needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people in areas like health, housing, education and employment. </p>
<p>It will not work if it is premised solely on a sense of national guilt and shame. Rather<br />
we should acknowledge past injustices and focus our energies on addressing the root<br />
causes of current and future disadvantage among our indigenous people.<br />
Nor will the reconciliation process work effectively if one of its central purposes<br />
becomes the establishment of different systems of accountability and lawful conduct<br />
among Australians on the basis of their race or any other factor.<br />
The reconciliation process will only work effectively if it involves and inspires all<br />
Australians. Reconciliation is not helped if its critics are able to claim that resources directed<br />
towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are disadvantaged have not<br />
been well or wisely used.<br />
However much some may wish to believe otherwise, there is evidence that some<br />
programmes designed to address indigenous disadvantaged have, in fact, encouraged<br />
dependency rather than individual initiative and personal responsibility.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen there can be little doubt that the reconciliation process has been<br />
hindered by the divisiveness and misinformation generated by certain extremist views<br />
in our community.<br />
It cannot seriously be argued that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not,<br />
as a group, profoundly disadvantaged.<br />
To suggest otherwise is to ignore reality, substitute fiction for fact and<br />
unrepresentative anecdotes for credible statistical proof.<br />
Equally, the cause of reconciliation is also damaged by those who are intolerant or<br />
misleading for the opposite purpose.<br />
Calls for disruption of the Sydney Olympic Games and trade boycotts of Australia,<br />
baseless allegations about a return to White Australia policies and charges of racism<br />
relentlessly directed against those who disagree with a particular point of view have all<br />
been very counter-productive.<br />
We need to reject extremist views on all sides. Australia's future will be best served<br />
by openness, tolerance, fairness and confidence in our Australian values. It will not be<br />
built on heavy-handed threats, cheap sloganeering or empty populism whatever its<br />
source. We need, my friends, to re-embrace the three great goals of the reconciliation process<br />
to which I have referred.<br />
First, we need a renewed national focus on the true causes of Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander disadvantage.<br />
For my Government, this is the cornerstone of the reconciliation process. </p>
<p>It is why we have given such priority to programmes that directly target indigenous<br />
disadvantage in health, housing, education and employment.<br />
It is why we are focussing Government resources on these areas in a way that will<br />
achieve the best outcome.<br />
Our aim is for indigenous Australians to have greater control over their own lives and<br />
their own communities.<br />
This will be achieved through sensitivity to the cultural needs of indigenous people and<br />
the ending of their cycle of dependency.<br />
We have breathed new life into the COAG agreement on National Commitment to<br />
Improved Outcomes in the Delivery of Programmes and Services for Indigenous<br />
people. Bilateral health agreements are now in place in all but two States and bilateral<br />
indigenous housing agreements are well advanced in most States.<br />
We have boosted funding for indigenous business development and, through the new<br />
Indigenous Business Incentive Programmes, we will be assisting economic<br />
independence in the indigenous community.<br />
Through a Commonwealth Government initiative, we have brought the Army, ATSIC<br />
and the Department of Health and Family Services together in a pilot program to<br />
address water supply and broader environmental health needs.<br />
In a period of necessary and tight fiscal restraint, to which all areas of Government<br />
spending have been subjected, we have either quarantined the areas of greatest need in<br />
indigenous communities, or actually increased fuinding.<br />
In overall terms we are committed to spend over $ 428 million more on indigenous<br />
specific programs in our first four years than was spent during the previous four years.<br />
What we have sought to do is to target this expenditure at the areas of greatest need.<br />
This practical, on-the-ground approach will remain a primary focus of our policy<br />
making. This is because we believe it will bring about true social justice for<br />
indigenous Australians.<br />
Second, all Australians indigenous and otherwise need to acknowledge realistically<br />
the interaction of our histories.<br />
Our purpose in doing so should not be to apportion blame and guilt for past wrongs,<br />
but to commit to a practical programme of action that will remove the enduring<br />
legacies of disadvantage. </p>
<p>At the same time, we need to acknowledge openly that the treatment accorded to<br />
many indigenous Australians over a significant period of European settlement<br />
represents the most blemished chapter in our history.<br />
Clearly, there were injustices done and no-one should obscure or minimise them. We<br />
need to acknowledge as a nation what European settlement has meant for the first<br />
Australians, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and in particular the<br />
assault on their traditions and the discrimination and violence they endured over many<br />
decades. This week the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission<br />
inquiry into The Separation of A boriginal and Torres Sitrail Islander Children from?<br />
their Families will be tabled in Parliament. Like all such reports, it will be subjected<br />
to proper analysis and scrutiny.<br />
It will neither be uncritically accepted nor summarily swept aside.<br />
However, let me make this clear. Personally, I feel deep sorrow for those of my<br />
fellow Australians who suffered injustices under the practices of past generations<br />
towards indigenous people. Equally, I am sorry for the hurt and trauma many people<br />
here today may continue to feel as a consequence of those practices.<br />
In facing the realities of the past, however, we must not join those who would portray<br />
Australia's history since 1788 as little more than a disgraceful record of imperialism,<br />
exploitation and racism.<br />
Such a portrayal is a gross distortion and deliberately neglects the overall story of great<br />
Australian achievement that is there in our history to be told, and such an approach<br />
will be repudiated by the overwhelming majority of Australians who are proud of what<br />
this country has achieved although inevitably acknowledging the blemishes in its past<br />
history. Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past<br />
actions and policies over which they had no control.<br />
However, we must acknowledge past wrongs, understand that they still cause a great<br />
deal of personal distress and resolve to improve areas of indigenous disadvantage both<br />
now and into the future.<br />
The third broad objective of the reconciliation process on which attention should be refocussed<br />
is the need to work together to ensure that our differences do not prevent us<br />
from sharing in a common future.<br />
All Australians, irrespective of their background or colour or belief or religion, share a<br />
common destiny.<br />
We all have rights and obligations as Australians. </p>
<p>These rights include the right to individual self-fulfilment and cultural freedom without<br />
discrimination and intimidation. They include the right of all Australians to dignity and<br />
self-respect.<br />
We cannot share a common destiny if these rights are available to some Australians,<br />
but rnot all.<br />
Likewise, we cannot share a common destiny together as Australians if different<br />
groups in our society have different standards of conduct and different systems of<br />
accountability. I know that the goals of the reconciliation process have been subjected to tension and<br />
strain as a result of the current debate on Native Title issues.<br />
You will all be aware that I have spent a great deal of time in trying to find a just, fair<br />
and workable outcome to the in response to the decision of the High Court of<br />
Australia in the Wik case. In working towards that solution, my Government's<br />
primary goal has been to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the rights of<br />
indigenous people and the rights of other Australians, in particular those in the pastoral<br />
and mining industries.<br />
I have heard what has been said here today, I can only remark that the myths that were<br />
abroad in Longreach have been repeated although on the opposite side of the argument<br />
in some of the observations that have been made here today. I need to remind you in<br />
asking you to consider and to understand the approach of my Government for the Wik<br />
decision. The recitals that were contained in the Native Title Act 1993, the declarations that<br />
were made about the impact of pastoral leases on Native Title by my predecessor, the<br />
Labor Prime Minister of Australia, and by a number of leaders in the indigenous<br />
community of Australia who are present in this auditorium.<br />
I also need in the name of truth and in the name of a frank discussion of this issue to<br />
repudiate the claim that my ten point plan involves a massive hand-out of freehold title<br />
at taxpayer expense. That is an absolute myth, it is absolutely contrary to the fact and<br />
I absolutely repudiate it.<br />
I believe that the plan which I have put forward provides an equitable balance between<br />
respect for the principles of Native Title, as laid down in the Mabo decision, and the<br />
very legitimate interests of pastoralists and others in securing certainty in carrying on<br />
and planning their activities.<br />
I understand the heat and passions that this issue has generated on both sides of the<br />
debate and I believe that a fair and equitable outcome and I believe that my ten point<br />
plan provides the only basis of a proper approach.<br />
I want to conclude my remarks today in the same tone as I began with a vigorous<br />
reaffirmation of my Government's commitment to a successful and ongoing process of<br />
national reconciliation which is developed in a climate of mutual trust and confidence. </p>
<p>This is a process which draws on Australians from all walks of life and all kinds of<br />
backgrounds. What brings them together is a faith in the power of Australian values<br />
the values of decency, tolerance, fairness and down-to-earth common sense.<br />
What inspires the process of national reconciliation, and what gives it its enduring<br />
strength, is the conviction that we can, and must, develop our future together as<br />
Australians with mutual respect for, and appreciation of our differences and with a<br />
unifying commitment to promoting Australia's national interests.<br />
That is what this Convention is all about. It is about our future together as<br />
Australians, and the kind of country we will hand on to our children.<br />
I wish Pat Dodson, his fellow members of the Reconciliation Council and all others<br />
involved in this Convention my very best wishes for a successful, positive and<br />
purposeful outcome over the next three days.<br />
I have great pleasure in formally declaring this Convention open.<br />
Thank you. </p>
