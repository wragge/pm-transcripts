WASHINGTON<br />
EXCHANGE OF REMARKS BETWEEN PRESIDENT<br />
JOHNSON AND THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN<br />
GORTON IN THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE<br />
JU16 27 MAY 1968<br />
THE PRESIDENT<br />
Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Gorton, Secretary and Mrs. Rusk,<br />
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, it is a very great pleasure for Mrs.<br />
Johnson and I to welcome you and your most charming wife to our country.<br />
We have very little to offer in the way of surprises. Mrs. Gorton is a<br />
native of New England. We have some New England weather for her this<br />
morning. But she already knows all of our secrets anyway. Even if she<br />
did not, you, yourself, Mr; Prime Minister, are the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia and the Australians and the Americans have so much in common<br />
that we seem to understand each other almost on sight anyway.<br />
Our people have been moulded by the same forces. Both<br />
of our continents are vast. Both of our histories are young. Both of our<br />
Governments are free. All of our people were drawn from many lands.<br />
We both enjoy an abundance which, for most of the world, is yet just a<br />
dream. We share a common vision. We see a world where might<br />
does not make right. We strive for a world where nations can live together<br />
in peace and freedom under the rule of law. We have been fighting for this<br />
dream for a long time now. Twenty-five years ago we fought side by side<br />
from the Middle East to the South Pacific. Today we are fighting side by<br />
side in the rice fields in Vietnam.<br />
I do not know how close we may be to success in our<br />
common and our historic cause. But I do know that you, Mr. Prime<br />
Minister, come here at a moment of very historic importance. Cur<br />
American aim is now, as it has been from the beginning, to achieve<br />
peace with honour, a peace which will permit the people of Asia and the<br />
South Pacific to work out their own destiny in their own way. We have<br />
never sought anything else, and we will not accept anything else. I<br />
believe that Australia shares that aim, and I look forward with a great<br />
deal of anticipation to our conversations about this and about many<br />
other common concerns. Mr. Prime Minister, you and your countrymen are always<br />
welcome in Washington. I think you will soon find that although you are<br />
half a world away from Australia, you are still very much at home.<br />
Thank you very much. / 2 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />
Mr. President, Mrs. Johnson, Secretary Rusk and Mrs. Rusk, Distinguished<br />
Guests:-Thank you, Mr. President, on behalf of all Australians, for<br />
the honour which, through me, you do my country. We value this the more<br />
since it comes from a power which is not only great, but which, since the<br />
end of the last world war, has assumed all the burdens and responsibilities<br />
of being great. You helped reconstruct Europe. In large measure, you<br />
financed the constructive work of the United Nations. You have without<br />
stint given blood and treasure to protect small nations from subjugation<br />
by force or by threat. And you seek to raise the living standards of people<br />
in every corner of the world. For this your country has received scant<br />
thanks yet at one time, through sole possession of atomic power, you<br />
could have imposed your will upon the world and did not. You could have<br />
chosen to conquer, but chose to set free. You could have looked inward,<br />
but instead you chose to look out. If the United Nations has not bro ught<br />
that end to war which its founders sought, if the world is still torn by<br />
strife as it is, that is the fault of others, not of yours.<br />
You have assumed, Sir, as I said, many burdens, and today<br />
one dominates our minds, Even as we stand here, out men fight in Vietnam~ r<br />
together, as they fought in other wars, to protect smiall nnrinnn from<br />
overthrow by force of Governrnenrs elered by rhe people. Even as we<br />
stand here, diplomats in Paris seek to discover whether there is hope of<br />
ending that fighting and securing a peace just, lasting and honourable<br />
giving to the people of South Vietnam a chance thernselves . to choose<br />
their future path without fear or threat.<br />
You, Mr. President, bore the lonely weight of decision to<br />
continue to resist force with force. You, Mr. President, by your recent<br />
gesture, brought the North Vietnamese to talk. You, Mr. President,-<br />
relinquished chance of further office to give those talks such chance lof<br />
success as they may have. And for that we admire and salute you. * It is<br />
that struggle which engrosses us today, but when it is decided, that<br />
solution will be one step only in the solution of other problems to which<br />
men and nations are born, which have arisen in the past, which exist now,<br />
and which will arise in the future in a world in transition.<br />
So the Revolutionary War decided whether America would<br />
or would not be independent. The War between the States decided whether<br />
the union would continue or fragment. The Second World War decided<br />
whether the world would be subject to fascist tyranny. just as those<br />
decisions engrossed the hearts and consciences of those then living, and<br />
decided a particular matter but did not provide solutions for future confli zt<br />
or for progress, so will the outcome of the war in Vietnam decide that<br />
matter but not those questions for decision arising in the years ahead.<br />
As Australians see it, those problems, although worldwide,<br />
are likely to be most acute in Asia. We see there an area which needs<br />
an economic and technical base such as Europe already has. We see there<br />
an area where development and progress are essential if the peoples of<br />
those divergent nations are to support and defend something dynamic and<br />
developing not something stagnant. We see there an area crying for<br />
technical skills, a more experienced administration, a more equitable<br />
sharing of an increasing incom-e and we see there an area subject, above<br />

all, to the threat of subversion, terrorism, and aggression. In some<br />
way, Sir, because of internal division, parts of Asia are reminiscent of<br />
the Balkans before World War I and in some ways they may pose the<br />
same dangers, dangers aggravated by the eagerness of agitators to exploit<br />
divisions. Perhaps, Mr. President, though I don't think so, we<br />
Australians see this out of perspective because it is here that we,<br />
contiguous to Asia part of the South East Asian region live and breathe<br />
and have our present and our future. It is here that we feel that we can<br />
best contribute to stability and to progress and to preserving its political<br />
freedom which seeks economic freedom as its concomitant. It is here<br />
that we can play our part. But we cannot effectively play it alone. As<br />
for ourselves we are not a great power, thou~ gh we are destined so to<br />
be. In our nation are new frontiers and boundless opportunities for those<br />
who will risk in order to win; for those who will work in order to build;<br />
for those who will endure initial hardship to gain distant goals. We shall<br />
grow in numbers and in industrial power, and further develop the use of<br />
our natural resources, and in growing, Mr. President, will grapple with<br />
existing problems and prepare for those which wait in the corridors of<br />
the future. But for the present, we, who for two centuries were shielded<br />
by the British Navy, have as our major shield the ANZUS pact, and behind<br />
that, and because of that, we can the sooner grow to that stature we shall<br />
reach, we shall the sooner reach a po sition to repulse * any attack the futur e<br />
may hold from any quarter, and by any means. We can the sooner grow<br />
in capacity to offer more economic and technical assistance to the<br />
Governments and peoples of our region. I do not mean that we do not now<br />
play our part in defence, as we do in aid, or in seeking to foster trade<br />
which may be more important than aid. But I do mean that becausc of your<br />
assistance, because of the ANZUS Treaty and what it implies, we cant<br />
divert to building a future strength, resources which would otherwise: be<br />
now diverted to defence, to the future detriment of defence, and to thp<br />
future diminution of our ability to render as much help in the region as<br />
we would wish. This is to us the virtue of the ANZUS pact. And allied<br />
to it is the sure knowledge that you while providing that shield recognize<br />
that behind it we, as we build our country, are free to make and will make<br />
our own foreign policy decisions subject only to our treaty obligations.<br />
Sir, I have not been here before in my present off ice, yet<br />
I f eel I come not as a stranger. On too many fields of battle we have<br />
stood together fighting for the concept of freedom, fighting against<br />
aggression. On too many occasions we have co-operated in the economic<br />
plans to help the worldrs underprivileged advance their standards of living.<br />
There is too much common heritage of a system under which Government<br />
is chosen by a majority, dismissed by a majority, protect minority rights,<br />
yet refuse to be coerced by organized minority demonstrations. There are<br />
too many bonds for any Australian Prime Minister even to feel that here he<br />
is a stranger. And so as in the past, so may it be in the future. Looking<br />
down the vista of the years, I hope that you in your greatness now, and we<br />
in our present strength and our greatness to come, will together give<br />
protection, stability, advancement, encouragement, will help to foster,<br />
along with and depending on the people who live in that region a new<br />
world in Asia to redress the balance of the old. If this can be done, if<br />
we can do this together successfully, the price to be now paid will, in the<br />
future, be thought by humanity small.<br />
Thank you, Sir. </p>
