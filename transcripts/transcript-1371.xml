FOUNDATION STONE CEIYDONY AT TO.. JNSVILLE<br />
UNIVERSITY, TOWNSVILLE, Q'LD. 29TH JULY, 1966.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. ' Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Mr Chancellor, Mr Premier, Mr Vice-Chancellor,<br />
Members of the Advisory Council, Dr Back, and Members of the<br />
Staff, Mr lMayor, Other Distinguished Guests Mr Prieatly comes<br />
into this at some stage of the address and Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />
I feel very appreciative and indeed moved,<br />
Mr Chancellor and Mr Vice-Chancellor, by the kind things you have<br />
said about me personally and my participation in this very happy<br />
function. It could hardly fall to the lot of a Prime Minister of<br />
Australia to have a happier day for his official tasks than I am<br />
experiencing here in Townsville on this particular day. This<br />
morning I have the opportunity to lay a foundation stone for the<br />
first university in the tropical north of Australia, then I go on<br />
this afternoon and help to launch the establishment of a great<br />
military base here which will add to the security, strength and<br />
the diversity of life in this part of the world. This combination<br />
is for me a very felicitous one and made the more so by the fact<br />
that we meet in typically Australian surroundings on a glorious<br />
sunny day quite tp to the travel brochure which so rarely lives up<br />
to expectations. Here in Townsville you have delivered the goods,<br />
and with M', rs Holt I am delighted to be here for the purpose of this<br />
function. I start vwith something of a disadvantage. It is<br />
quite obvious to any of you looking at the platform that I am a<br />
very new Prime Minister and therefore I am underdressed for the<br />
occasion. ( Laughter) WIhen I look at the Premier, this resplendent<br />
creature, I am only grateful that he didn't bring this out for the<br />
last Premiers' Conference. I would have found him quite irresistible<br />
had he done so. But the Mayor has shown his consideration for me<br />
rather than leave me isolated in civic uniform. He has foregone<br />
his own robes of office and sat with me here in this rather dreary<br />
outfit which marks the normal attire of the man of affairs in these<br />
quickly moving times. But what a wonderful thing to see growing around us<br />
not just a university but one which by its distinction of<br />
architecture, its modernity, its appropriateness in the glorious<br />
setting in which it finds itself will be a show-place in the life<br />
of Australia in the future. It is a proud thing for Townsville,<br />
it is a proud thing for all of us to be able to share the experiece<br />
of today, and the contribution which this university will make to<br />
the life of the northern part of Australia, and then reaching out<br />
to Australia as a whol-, can only be speculated upon at this stage.<br />
But no-one doubts that it will be a significant contribution for<br />
Australia, and I personally do not doubt that it will be making a<br />
valuable contribution to the well-being of the people in Asia and<br />
South-East Asia generally.<br />
Here we have a seat of learning that will be facing<br />
problems that possess some novelty in academic circles. There are<br />
problems which are special and peculiar to a tropical area. There<br />
is a proximity here to our north. ern neighbours which will make this<br />
university a focus of interest for them. There is the close<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
association you will be having here with the Council for Scientific<br />
and Industrial Research, and I understand a School of Advanced<br />
Studies is to be established here alongside you also. Now this<br />
combination of activities cannot fail to contribute notably to the<br />
well-being, to the advancement of the north of Australia, and<br />
having put our hands to the job, it is well it should be done<br />
so handsomely as the planning of the university would indicate to<br />
you. It is not, of course, so very long ago that the<br />
Commonwealth Government was almost a stranger to activities of<br />
this sort. Under the Constitution, education has been a matter<br />
in the province of the State Government, but as the years have<br />
gone on, the electorate which has proved so demanding in other<br />
directions has also turned its attention to education. Indeed,<br />
I suppose education is one of the most sensitive areas of government<br />
at the present time, both in the Federal and the State sphere.<br />
Certainly it is a subject matter w/ hich we cannot ignore if for no...<br />
other reason that the burden on government budgets these days has<br />
become heavy indeed. As I said in lielbourne only a week a. o, we<br />
are almost at our wits' end wihich is perhaps the right sort of<br />
phrase to use in relation to a problem of education at our wits'<br />
end to know how we are going to finance the pro; gramme recommended<br />
to us in the next triennium.<br />
But what has been called the education explosion<br />
has manifested itself as far as arree concerned in expenditure in<br />
this last Budget year of 130' i and that is just about double what<br />
the bill was three years ago. From what w-e Coe of developments<br />
ahead, it is quite clear that the Commonwealth will be making a<br />
very large contribution in the future as will the States. Indeed<br />
when you mentioned, I. 1r Vice-Chancellor, that in a not so very<br />
remote point of time you could get your education for fourpence<br />
a -eek, I ,-ondered whether progress had been entirely advantageous<br />
fron the point of view of governments.<br />
~ ie have a small population in this vast continent<br />
of ours. f! ear e building it as rapidly as no can with our<br />
irigration programmLe and with such encouragement as we can offer<br />
to those capable of forming families to go about that task in an<br />
enterprising way, but we still have by standards of our neighbours<br />
to the north a very small population i. n a very large area of land.<br />
And yet increasing responsibilities are being requested of us and<br />
we face up to those in a spirit of acceptance. We feel Australia<br />
can make a contribution to a better . orld order in this area of<br />
the world in which ve find ourselves.<br />
One of the consequences flowing neces arily from<br />
this is a need to have people of quality. If we have a few<br />
people, then they must be good people, they must be -ell trained<br />
people, people with a sense of responsibility, people who possess<br />
the characteristics which we regard as the high-uater marks of the<br />
Australian temperament. It is through institutions such as these<br />
that we can lead our people on to better standards, that -o can<br />
encourage them to make a more valuable and far-reaching contribution<br />
to the area in which we have our being.<br />
And so, Ir Chancellor and Iir Vice-Chancellor, you<br />
have the good . ishes of us all in the future development, the<br />
future success of this institution. I couldn't feel happier that<br />
it has been placed in a to'., n which is making its oun presence<br />
felt significantly in the gro; wth of Australia. Townsville / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
epitoises Australian growth at its best diversity of activity<br />
in a splendid Australiansetting; it has almost all the assets a<br />
community could hope to find around it in climate, in charm of<br />
appearance, in diversity of activity, And now to enrich and<br />
further diversify the life of the community, you will have a<br />
large university population, you will have an added Service<br />
population which contributes its own measure of colour and<br />
ceremony to the life of the community.<br />
You, r I'ayor, I think, can look forward with<br />
satisfaction to the Townsville of the future, and all here feel<br />
confident that in the better Australia of the years ahead,<br />
institutions such as this University of Townsville will be<br />
making for the more notable Australia of the future.<br />
And so e w: ish you well. e from the Common: ealth<br />
and I am sure you, Mr Nicklin for your part will be doing our<br />
best year by year to meet the increasing financial demarnds you<br />
will be making upon us. At least will know that our funds<br />
have been spent in a cause which w. ill produce for us richer<br />
dividends than almost anything else that Comonruealth and State<br />
funds could be devoted to. You will find in us a willingness<br />
to help. For your part, if you ma. ke the most of the opportunities<br />
which arise hero, you will be providing residential accomodation<br />
and servicing students from this whole northern area. The very<br />
demands for these services have already far exceeded the<br />
projections comteraplated for them when these were made in 1963,<br />
and e can anticipate that with the general growth of prosperity<br />
in this area and greater industrialisation in so many directions,<br />
population will grow and the requirements for university<br />
education will grow. A successful future, therefore, for this<br />
university, and in order that the building can proceed without<br />
any danger of falling around us, I have to lay a stone which<br />
apparoitly is going to enable further construction to proceed.<br />
And so, ' Ir Chancellor, if you will lead me to my<br />
task, I will perform this important duty. </p>
