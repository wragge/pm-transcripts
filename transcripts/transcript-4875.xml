PRESS CONFERENCE ON<br />
INTEREST RATES<br />
Tape begins as follows:<br />
Prime Minister<br />
but we are expecting also that for overdrafts over<br />
$ 100,000 they mightn't all come down by the same amount.<br />
But there will be general expectations that the average of<br />
the reductions would also equal a half percent. It ought<br />
to be noted that in that area, competition over the last<br />
two or three months, as we are advised by the banks, has<br />
already forced reduction of about .2 percent so that in a<br />
sense has led to moves now being announced officially by<br />
the trading banks of Australia. This is further confirmation that<br />
the Government's policies are working. They are going<br />
to continue to work and our objective will be to see a steady,<br />
continued and sustainable reduction in interest rates. And<br />
I think this is very pleasing news and indicates that we are by and<br />
large on track in this area.<br />
Question<br />
What effect do you think these reductions will have?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's a further mark in reducing inflation. We've indicated<br />
on a number of occasions the effect that reduced interest<br />
rates have on businesses; reduces the cost of money to them<br />
and as reductions become more pronounced over time, the<br />
advantages to industry, to farms, is obviously going to be<br />
significant. There is encouragement after so many years in<br />
which interest rates have tended to move in the. wrong' direction<br />
to know that the efforts to get rates down is now starting<br />
to bear fruit across the generality of overdrafts.<br />
Question ( Peter Harvey)<br />
( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it is worth noting that the housing area did come down<br />
earlier this year by half a percent. Quite obviously with<br />
the continuation of the Government's policy that in the<br />
future we will be looking for further reductions in the<br />
housing area. This matter has been discussed in recent times<br />
but it is hoped that these moves should take place and be<br />
established and then that will be further assessed.<br />
Question ( Peter Harvey)<br />
moves will apply pressure though, surely? t../ 2<br />
PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT1 NOVEMBER ' 1978' </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Of course it will and I think that also in a gentle way<br />
applies some pressure on Premiers who are often have a<br />
closer relationship to their building societies of course,<br />
than we do. I would hope that<br />
the Premiers would be looking at what they could do to<br />
help with the general moves down, very earnestly, as a<br />
result of this.<br />
Question Can we expect another reduction in the fairly near future?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'm not going to put a time scale on it. Let me just say<br />
that the policy is working and under the policies that we<br />
have in place we would expect that the movement would be<br />
steady and sustained and quite obviously, a further reduction<br />
in the housing area would also be extraordinarly beneficial.<br />
Question would you expect that this move now will significantly<br />
stimulate the employment situation?<br />
Prime minister<br />
What happens in economy is a result of the effect of policies<br />
over time. You are not going to get to one particular point,<br />
one particular event, one particular day-and suddenly say<br />
look, this is meant to be the breakthrough<br />
because I don't think an economy works like-that. You need<br />
to have in mind the changes that have been taking place in<br />
the Australian economy over the last two or three years<br />
One of the things I've noticed which heartens me greatly;<br />
the reactions from people and industry over recent months<br />
has been much much more optimistic for the future. Now it's<br />
still patchy but a number of industries are looking<br />
forward to the future with greater confidence, with better ' orders<br />
Many are getting into export markets and there is the kind of<br />
example General Motors that's been quoted that's put on many<br />
hundreds of people over recent months,-expectations of<br />
putting on more over the next few months, another 500 or 600 by<br />
about April and that's a major industry. But in a number of<br />
smaller industries we've found them getting back into export<br />
markets. The sporting goods manufacturers are again seeking<br />
export orders. Many firms, use the example of colour television<br />
sets to Hong Kong, women's underwear to Japan made in Australia,<br />
furniture to Sweden, Australian-made saddles are being sold<br />
in Denmark and Germany and Etirope, Southeast Asia and none of<br />
this could happen if there wasn't a reasonable cost base in<br />
Australia and if Australian industries weren't competitive, if<br />
they weren't producing a quality product. Now two years ago<br />
we didn't find this sort of activity, we didn't find this sort<br />
of interest, this determination to get up and do things. It is<br />
now becoming evident, through Australian manufacturing industry.<br />
We know unfortunately that of all the indicators employment is<br />
going to be the last indicator to respond. But the feeling / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( continued)<br />
going around the manufacturing sector is one of much<br />
more enthusiasm and I think it will be present for some<br />
time. Question Do you think the trading banks wanted to do this or have they<br />
relucantly acted because of...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think they've reacted to the market forces as much as<br />
anything else, because I made the point that over the last<br />
two or three months overdrafts over $ 100,000 have come down<br />
as we have been advised, by an average of .2 percent and<br />
that's been quiet and unobtrusive. If people have been watching<br />
the marketplace I think they would have been aware that the<br />
deposit rate for large deposits, that's over $ 50,000, has<br />
come down over the last three or four weeks and these are<br />
moves that the banks have initiated on their own. You've got the<br />
market situations I think and Government policy also because<br />
that can help to establish the market situations, have put them<br />
in the position in which the responsible thing to do is to<br />
make this move in lowering interest rates.<br />
Question<br />
The banks were saying only two or three weeks ago that they<br />
thought the time was not right for a move down and they<br />
mentioned ( inaudible) Was there a deal done,..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, there was no deal in relation to that. At the very time<br />
in which that particular statement was made the banks had<br />
already started to move their deposit rate down on large<br />
deposits, which seemed to be somewhat in conflict with the<br />
public statement. As I indicated, the interest charged on<br />
larger overdrafts had started to come down two or three<br />
months ago.<br />
Question How would you account for that apparently conflicting position?<br />
Prime* Minister<br />
I think you would have to ask somebody else that.<br />
Question Why. was the loan announcement made last night, which is two<br />
weeks before the opening of the loan. It is normally made a<br />
week before the opening of the loan. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because there wasn't going to be a cash loan in addition<br />
to the conversion loan and the sooner the market began to<br />
know that the better.<br />
Question There have been instances in the past where there have been<br />
cash loans and the announcement hasn't been made that early?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The rates advised were the rates proposed to us by Bank and<br />
Treasury advisers in this particular matter. Eric might like<br />
to add to it, but this came to us in the normal way and<br />
the Premiers were advised. I don't think there is anything<br />
unusual in relation to that.<br />
There was nothing abnormal in the procedure taken on this<br />
occasion at all? The Premiers were telexed in the same way<br />
loan council and it was thought desirable that this information<br />
there wasn't going to be a cash loan. ( Inaudible) there was<br />
nothing extraordinarily unusual in the procedure.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
This is another area where if you watch the markets you would<br />
have been able to see that the Reserve Bank had been operating<br />
in the market to bear down on interest rates ever since the<br />
so-called indigestion period, in inverted commas, when the last<br />
loan had concluded.<br />
Question The market was decidedly edgy, from my reading . of iti-and this<br />
was generally regarded in the markets as an attempt to settle<br />
it down. They didn't expect the announcement a w.. eek earlier<br />
than normal. Would you like to comment on that?<br />
Prime* Minister<br />
I wasn't aware of any edginess. I don't know how you make<br />
that sort of judgement.<br />
Question Well, there was a certain amount of selling pressure developing<br />
in the market.<br />
Prime Minist'er<br />
Yes, and if you look what had happened in the United States<br />
and the index there and in other markets overseas, If you look<br />
also at the implications for the European monetar system,<br />
which as I understand it will enlarge the market or the access<br />
in market for those in Britian for example who might want to<br />
buy Australian dollars to invest in the Australian market, there<br />
are a number of events occuring overseas that have -implications. </p>
<p>Prime Minister*( continued)<br />
This is I specifically asked a question in relation to<br />
the stock market and that's the sort of answer, again, I<br />
was given.<br />
Question Would you expect an increase in the volume of lending by<br />
the banks following this reduction?<br />
Prime minister<br />
The bank lending has been at fairly high levels, I understand<br />
it, over recent weeks. I think it's the cost of living as<br />
much as the volume...<br />
Question<br />
Would you expect an increase in the volume of loans?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I wouldn't have thought particularly.<br />
Question Isn't there limit on that agreed between banks and the<br />
Reserve Bank?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, but it is not an arbitrary limit.<br />
Question Is that limit still going to stay the same.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is a general guideline but it's you know you don't<br />
hit the same level each particular week. It's a general trend<br />
line. Question That's not going to change for a year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There has been no advice to change. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Question Do you expect this reduction in interest rates to affect<br />
in any way the amount of money coming in from overseas.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I wouldn't have thought so.<br />
I would have thought that the major determinent of that<br />
is our rate of inflation compared with other peoples.<br />
Question Have you had any contact yet with any of the Premiers and<br />
did they hope that or expect that the building societies<br />
will follow...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I haven't had any contact with the Premiers yet. I will be.<br />
I wouldn't go anticipating further moves imminently. I wouldn't<br />
want to leave that impression or I wouldn't want you to draw<br />
that conclusion but I did make the point that Premiers are<br />
in a position to influence building society rates. Some<br />
Premiers more so than others because they have the statutory<br />
relationship. State Government to building societies differs<br />
between the states.<br />
Question But you wouldn't expect such moves in the next say three<br />
months? Prime Minister<br />
Good heavens, I'm not putting a time scale on it.<br />
Question How does this change affect your target for bringing down<br />
infrastructure by 2 percent this year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
well, some rates will have come down very nearly by that amount.<br />
It's I think I've got some rates here, not all but I think<br />
again if you look at the words I used, because this-is not uncommon,<br />
the words I used were chosen carefully -XASD 1.25; Commonwealth<br />
Bonds 20 years 1.7, 10 years 1.6; finance company, commercial<br />
mortgages 2 percent; industrial debentures 1.5 percent; some<br />
of the moves down, a number A~ diverse areas are now quite<br />
substantial. Question ( Inaudible) t ./ 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Prime Minister<br />
September, ' 77.<br />
Question I think your actual words were what cost to ordinary people...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Some important rates could come down by up to 2 percent.<br />
Question I think there is another quote about what people housing<br />
payments. Prime Minister<br />
I gave an example of what a 2 percent reduction would mean for<br />
housing. Question ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Half a percent. But the two percent wasn't specifically<br />
related to housing.<br />
Question That was an example you gave, wasn't it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
yes. Question Do you expect to meet your monetary target for M3<br />
of 6 to 8percent by reducing further interest rates?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have been given advice today that there is no reason why<br />
monetary targets should not be met.<br />
Question Was that based on a belief that there were seasonal factors<br />
operating out and pushing money supply up?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are always seasonal factors. One of the factors that<br />
is operating from now on are various tax changes. </p>
<p>8<br />
Question Do you see the tax changes taking a great deal of money out<br />
of money supply?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are a factor but that's only one of many factors that<br />
operate. 000---</p>
