AUSTALIA<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 12 MARC-H 1982<br />
CIVIC RECEPTION, BENALLA<br />
I would like to thank you very much indeed for that welcome.<br />
I think we can for an ecumenical movement at least for today<br />
and maybe it: would be better if it could last for longer than<br />
a day. But, it would seem to me that a large part of what<br />
we are seeing right here is what Australia is all about.<br />
I think we really do believe that this is one of the best<br />
countries in the world to live in. I believe it is one of<br />
the best countries in th6 world to bring children up in.<br />
There were a number of kids outside a little earlier this<br />
afternoon as Tamie and I came in.<br />
It really is a wonderful thing to see a community that is doing<br />
so much for itself in partnership i~ f you like, with whatever<br />
state and Federal governments can do. The real motivating<br />
force for the kind of enthusiasm that you have exhibitied<br />
Mr Mayor, and for the obvious progress that Benalla ' has<br />
experienced comes from people who live within that community<br />
and the government cannot create that, it has to be something<br />
in the minds3 and hearts of people themselves.<br />
I just think because he is departing a political ' scene, I<br />
would like o say that I am glad to see Tom McEwan here.. Ile<br />
has been member for this area for what, 21 years and this is<br />
the last time that he is standing for this electorate and<br />
he will not be standing again on this occasion, and it has been<br />
represented in this State over a very long time.<br />
I am glad you me ntioned textiles industry and this morning<br />
we were at B3ruck mills in Wangaratta and we know the importance<br />
of the textile industry to many country towns and communities<br />
right throug hout Australia. it is not only that, I don't<br />
really believe I could imagine Australia without a textile<br />
industry, so what we wanted to do was to take some decisions<br />
that would open industry to a touch of internati -onal competition,<br />
but also we wanted a decision that would encourage more investment<br />
in the industries in Australia so that they would buy modern<br />
machinery, modern equipment, become competitive. That indeed<br />
is what a significant numbei of firms in -the textile, appare.<br />
and footWEac industries are now doing as a result of decisions<br />
we took about 18 months. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Where I was this morning in Wangaratta at Bruck<br />
Mills I was told that they are -trying to crash into some export<br />
markets and you might think they are going to go to Europe<br />
you might think they are going to go the United States, but<br />
they are OPE! ning offices in Singapore and Hong Kong. That<br />
is the kind of imagination and initiative and confidence that<br />
we want to see from Australia's industries. I think we know<br />
that that kind of thing would not have happened with t he motor<br />
industries without decisions which seek to balance the competing<br />
interests ol' different groups, different people within the<br />
community. Quite obviously we had very much in mind not only<br />
the maintenance of an industry, but the impact of that industry<br />
on employment, on country towns and communities and on the<br />
well-being of Australia. I have been very glad to see how the<br />
industry has indeed been prospering since that decision was<br />
in fact made.<br />
I appreciate Mr Mayor very much this Civic reception which<br />
you are attending for Tamie and to myself. From across the bridge when<br />
we saw this magnificent art gallery, we almost thought that<br />
we were loodng at the Sydney Opera ' House. If the cost<br />
structure was similar and you are free of debt, you certainly<br />
need no more help from the Commonwealth. We are looking forward<br />
to seeing tfte collection you have in this Gallery in a few<br />
moments time.<br />
The Mayor has said everything about Benalla. lie has made it<br />
vcry plain that the city is moving ahead, but everyone here<br />
knows that it is in the centre o-K a vastly important<br />
rural area and people may not know that rural areas in this<br />
state have been expanding their production at a greater rate<br />
than in any other state. I don't know if I could say<br />
that tactfully in Queensland or Western Australia because the<br />
Premier of Queensland might not like that being said. It happens<br />
to be true. So many things have happened in Victoria over the<br />
years that I think we have tended to take what happens in the<br />
state very much for granted. We forget that there are great<br />
resource developments in Loy Yang which have gone on, what<br />
over 60 years, that the largest construction project in<br />
Australia h7. appens to be taking place in Loy Yang right at<br />
this moment. in the development of adequate power for this State.<br />
I cannot dE! velop that point Mr Mayor, or I will cease to be<br />
ecumenical. Family inco~ mes, household income in this State is higher than<br />
in any others. Savings in this state are higher than any of<br />
the others. While we know there are problems at the moment<br />
facing people at the moment who want to buy a home, over the<br />
years home ownership has been higher in this state than in<br />
any other s; tate. These are all objectives which I amn sure<br />
all Victcri-ans would want to maintain in the years ahead because<br />
again it gets back to what thi~ s country is all. about, the kind<br />
of lives that families and children, that people, whatever<br />
they want to do are able to do in the State Victoria or in<br />
the wider Australia. </p>
<p>-3<br />
I believe tftiat all of you must be enormL1ously proud of what<br />
has happened, of what you have been achieving in Benalla.<br />
This is-in a. sense just a small part of what is happening<br />
right across Australia because the sort of things that you<br />
are so proud of here, that you are doing so well to improve<br />
life in and around Benalla is happenIng in many other parts<br />
of the country, in this State and in other states of the<br />
Commonwealt4. That again is what Australia is all about.<br />
I sometimes think it would be interesting if we could'preserve,<br />
and maybe you have already done it, in Benalla and every country<br />
town and in a few places in the city of Melbourne, In Sydney<br />
and whatever, the kind of home people might have moved in<br />
in 1946 or 1947 with the kind of equipment that went into<br />
that home and then the kind of home -that gets built in 1982 or<br />
1983 with the kind of equipment that young Australians expect<br />
to be in that home, probably in many cases from the day they<br />
first move into that home.<br />
I can remember, it is meant to be an all--electric state and<br />
we bought a farm in Western Victoria having been told that<br />
the SEC would be there in two or three years. About 25 years<br />
the SEC arrived. They do a wonderful job once they come.<br />
There was a Coolguardie safe. I wonder how many people<br />
here, none of those kids outside would know what a Coolguardie<br />
safe, but I wonder how many people here know what a Coolguardie<br />
safe is? I suppose, well there are some who do and then<br />
we manage to get by fair means or foul a small electrolux<br />
kerosene refrigerator and we thought that paradise had arrived<br />
especially as it came before one particular Christmas.<br />
That just is a very small way in which things have changed.<br />
I think would not hurt to have it on record for those<br />
kids outside, and for people who cannot possibly remember<br />
what it was like, what average homes were like, 30, 35 years<br />
ago or whatever, or even 20 years ago so they can see the<br />
contributicn that their parents have made over the * years to<br />
building up the standard of life, the quality of life, the<br />
quality of pepole's homes in this country.<br />
Indeed, I guess you would only have to look at a model of<br />
Benalla at the same time in 1946 it probably would not be<br />
one half, cne quarter, one tenth of the place that it is today.<br />
What has happened in the intervening. time is a tribute to<br />
the kind of work and efforts that many-mayors, many councillors<br />
and many citizens and private people have put into building<br />
something better over the years.<br />
Most of us have such a good life in this country that we reall. y<br />
do take it for granted and we don't understand the changes that<br />
have been made, that it has sometimes come at cost, but that<br />
those changes over the years are enormous and significant and<br />
the important thing is that those changes are significant in<br />
terms of the way ordinary, average decent Australians are ablE!<br />
to lead out. their lives, in this country because that really<br />
is what -it is all about.<br />
Mr Mayor, thank you very much indeed for hospitality and your<br />
gonerosity to Tamite and myself. </p>
