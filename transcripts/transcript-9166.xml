PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
ECONOISIT ROUNDTABLE<br />
CANBERRA, 24 MARCH 1994<br />
Let me begin by thanking the Economist and everyone<br />
associated with this conference.<br />
It is a very useful magazine, the Economist. These days<br />
I particularly like reading the last couple of pages<br />
the economic indicators.<br />
I like reading them because today they show how well this<br />
country is doing relative to the rest of the world.<br />
There it was on March 12 Australia leading the world in<br />
GDP growth, and leading the world as far as the<br />
Enonomist's forecasters were concerned.<br />
And along with the growth, low inflation.<br />
I thought it might be interesting to compare these<br />
figures with those of a decade ago.<br />
In 1983 the Economist had just started running these two<br />
useful pages of indicators. And here in Australia we had<br />
just floated the dollar.<br />
In the week we floated it, 17 December 1983, the<br />
Rconomist's indicators revealed our GDP growth for the<br />
year was the lowest in the world. Not the highest<br />
the lowest. Minus 3.9.<br />
And Australia's inflation rate was not among the lowest<br />
in the world, it was among the highest. For the year the<br />
CPI was 9.2% the third highest. The US was 2.9%,<br />
Germany 2.6% ' r--oday Australia's inflation rate is lower<br />
than both those countries.<br />
So between those two sets of figures, separated by ten<br />
years or so, there lies a tale.<br />
And, whatever else this conference has done, I hope it<br />
has told that tale. </p>
<p>2<br />
If your conference has stimulated thought, questioned a<br />
few orthodoxies, opened people up to new information,<br />
ideas and opinion it will prove useful in the short run.<br />
It will be significant in the ing~ run if it re-shapes<br />
thinking about Australia and its place in the world: I<br />
think my own hope would be that the Conference has helped<br />
perceptions of Australia catch up with the realities.<br />
We tend to take for granted that people here and abroad<br />
fully comprehend the massive structural and cultural<br />
change which has occurred in Australia in the past<br />
decade. The truth is a lot of Australians are not really aware of<br />
what is taking place here. They are not fully aware of<br />
what they themselves have achieved.<br />
When you are driven by reforming zeal you tend to forgo<br />
the luxury of reflecting on your work.<br />
And in the 1980s as now Australia wag driven by the<br />
need to break from the downward spiral of economic<br />
fortune which a quarter century of conservative<br />
government orthodoxy had got us into.<br />
We are only now beginning to see what we have done. And<br />
we are beginning to see it because the effects are<br />
beginning to flow.<br />
As that process continues, I think the dimensions of this<br />
national transformation will increasingly become apparent<br />
to Australians.<br />
And I think that this awareness will itself be a fillip<br />
to Australia's progress.<br />
I believe there is a great story to be told about<br />
contemporary Australia. And as Australians'<br />
consciousness of it increases, so I believe will their<br />
enthusiasm and sense of national purpose.<br />
Now of course I hope to see the same consciousness about<br />
modern Australia developing in other parts of the world.<br />
What we have in Australia in the 1990s is the best<br />
conjunction of growth and low inflation for 30 years.<br />
We have a productivity culture to help us maintain that<br />
happy circumstance.<br />
We have an export culture that we didn't have before.<br />
In Asia and the Pacific we have the export markets, and<br />
increasingly the necessary structures to grow and service<br />
them. </p>
<p>We have exports now representing 20 per cent of GDP. An<br />
export base which is much more diverse than it was a<br />
decade ago, with exports of elaborately transformed<br />
manufactures growing at 16 per cent per annum since the<br />
mid eighties and exports of services also growing<br />
rapidly. Above all, we have the confidence which can only come<br />
with success itself.<br />
There is nothing harder to move than an orthodoxy. No<br />
amount of arguing with it will make much difference.<br />
The orthodoxy about Australia used to be that we could<br />
not be a manufacturing nation and an exporter of<br />
commodities. The truth was we could be and we now are.<br />
The orthodoxy used to be that we couldn't develop a<br />
cooperative productivity-based industrial culture. The<br />
truth is we could and we have.<br />
The orthodoxy was that we couldn't do business in Asia.<br />
The truth is, today that is where we do most of our<br />
business. The orthodoxy was that we could never be a truly<br />
competitive nation. The truth is we could and today we<br />
are. The old orthodoxy obtained as much at home as it did<br />
abroad. Today in Australia the new reality is<br />
progressively dislodging the old way of thinking, and<br />
there are promising indications that the same thing is<br />
happening abroad.<br />
And where this is not the case, it most certainly should<br />
be. For in addition to those fundamentals we now have firmly<br />
in place, we have the added advantages of a skilled<br />
workforce, massive participation rates in schools, a<br />
strong shift to private research and development, highly<br />
developed infrastructure, and a society and a political<br />
system as stable as any in the world.<br />
Now, I have no doubt that in the course of the Conference<br />
there will have been objections raised to perceived or<br />
real disincentives to trade and investment in Australia.<br />
In reply let me begin by saying that we do not believe<br />
our job is over; or that the schemes we have in place are<br />
perfect and not in need of tuning and reforming from time<br />
to time.<br />
In the broad, we are pleased with what we have done. </p>
<p>But nothing suggests to us that we can for a moment rest<br />
on our laurels. Everything in the modern global economy<br />
suggests that no nation can.<br />
So, where there are difficulties our mind is open. We<br />
know you don't get to solve large problems by being<br />
closed off to criticism we didn't make ourselves<br />
competitive by closing ourselves off, we did it by<br />
opening ourselves up.<br />
Having said that, I should restate the Australian<br />
Government's view that we are not about the economic<br />
imperative transcending the social imperative.<br />
We are not interested in Australia in creating a low-wage<br />
low rent society.<br />
We do not for a moment believe the nonsense put around by<br />
some people in the 1980s and even by some people today<br />
that our competitiveness depends on imitating the wage<br />
regimes of developing countries.<br />
Our objective is a high wage economy built on education<br />
and productivity, coupled with an affordable but<br />
sophisticated social net.<br />
No doubt investors will see some advantages in the<br />
developing countries, but Australia will more than match<br />
them in skills, productivity, stability and certainty.<br />
Similarly, if an overseas investor tells us that our<br />
taxation system is too complicated that for example,<br />
the fringe benefits tax or neraZin other provisions make<br />
life difficult for them, we will look at the problem.<br />
But we will not lose sight of the first principle, which<br />
is that the tax system should be fair and effective.<br />
And we might be inclined to say to such an investor:<br />
whatever you may see yourself as losing on the little<br />
roundabouts, you will more than make up for on the big<br />
swing of economic and political stability, a massive<br />
profit share, a first class universal health system,<br />
schools, hospitals, social services which in general have<br />
few peers in the world and with a revenue share in GDP<br />
the lowest in the developed world.<br />
A small public sector but an effective one.<br />
In short, this is a good place in which to live and to<br />
work. It should be plainly understood that Australia has<br />
rejected the socially regressive forms of economic<br />
rationalism in favour of structural reform allied to<br />
inclusive social policies. </p>
<p>The results of this mix gave Australia one of the highest<br />
growth rates in the OECD over the last decade, the<br />
highest rate of employment and one of the lowest rates of<br />
inflation.-<br />
The model here in the nineties is a modern socialdemocratic<br />
one.<br />
And I might say it seems to me that if you surveyed the<br />
successful countries of the modern era even if only<br />
through the Economist'sa economic indicators you will<br />
find that this model has been the successful one<br />
everywhere. " Model" in a sense is the wrong word. Because what<br />
characterises the philosophy is flexibility, pragmatism,<br />
responsiveness, an absence of ideological rigidity.<br />
It is a " model" which balances the imperative to take<br />
bold steps and often difficult ones with the<br />
imperative to take the people along with you.<br />
Manifestly, it is a model not just for social and<br />
economic justice, but for social and economic cohesion<br />
and strength.<br />
That is why, incidentally, the Government is determined<br />
to see that the benefits now flowing from the recovery,<br />
and from the great changes made in the 1980s, flow right<br />
through the country into services, into regional<br />
development, into the unemployed.<br />
From the Government's point of view this has to be a<br />
recovery that is both deep and broad.<br />
It can be a recovery, I believe, which will complete the<br />
transformation of Australia and set us up in the front<br />
rank of countries in the 21st century.<br />
That will depend on the successful completion of a number<br />
of other tasks. First among them is the problem of the<br />
long term unemployed.<br />
on 28 April we will bring down a White Paper on<br />
Employment the first since the end of the Second World<br />
War.<br />
With its implementation, we expect to get the bulk of the<br />
long term unemployed back in touch with the labour<br />
market. In doing so we will not only alleviate what is a major<br />
human problem now, but avoid a major social problem<br />
later.<br />
And at the same time we will exploit an otherwise wasted<br />
human resource and substantially increase the skill level<br />
of our workforce. </p>
<p>That is a major challenge for us in the next few years<br />
creating a more skilled and flexible workforce, and<br />
thereby, industries which are more competitive and<br />
responsive. So we will be investing heavily in education and<br />
training.<br />
We are also very much aware that this federation of<br />
states is not always as efficient as it should be<br />
indeed, for a long time, in many areas it has been<br />
dreadfully inefficient.<br />
In recent months we have taken some dramatic steps<br />
towards creating a much more efficient and competitive<br />
Commonwealth by creating a more cooperative one.<br />
One more committed to common national goals.<br />
In a real sense, what we are doing is applying to the<br />
Commonwealth the same principles as the best companies<br />
apply. And I would take the analogy further than the simple<br />
mechanics of efficiency.<br />
As companies need a sense of purpose about them, so do<br />
countries. As companies need an unambiguous corporate<br />
identity, so do countries.<br />
That is why the Government has been concerned with issues<br />
relating to our identity and nationhood.<br />
The circumstances of our history have left us with a<br />
residue of ambiguity and anachronism which in this decade<br />
the Government would like to see swept away swept away<br />
without cost to our best traditions, but with great gain<br />
to our collective confidence and effort.<br />
In a broadly similar vein we have set about at last<br />
bringing in to the national mainstream the indigenous<br />
people of Australia.<br />
I gather one speaker at least has expressed concern about<br />
the Mabo legislation the Government introduced last year.<br />
This was perhaps the most complex and difficult<br />
legislation in Australia's history, and also the most<br />
overdue. We introduced it above all because justice<br />
demanded that we do it.<br />
We also did it in the knowledge that success will mean a<br />
more cohesive country and a people with more confidence<br />
and self-esteem.<br />
We did it not to create uncertainty but certainty the<br />
certainty which comes from a national system to determine<br />
native title. </p>
<p>We would be only too happy to explain how the legislation<br />
does this to Mr Masuda and any potential investors in our<br />
mining and pastoral industries.<br />
I would only say now that this is good and necessary<br />
legislation and investors must recognise it as fact of<br />
our national life.<br />
I say to them and to our own States that the legislation<br />
has already brought certainty and with their cooperation<br />
it can bring even more.<br />
The dire consequences predicted in some quarters have not<br />
eventuated, and show no sign of doing so.<br />
I have no doubt that in the long run the Mabo legislation<br />
will be seen as a force for a better investment climate,<br />
as well as a better country.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
On all these matters there are sceptics out there I know<br />
and cynics, and naysayers and obscurantists of all<br />
kinds. But their ranks are thinning.<br />
We are very confident. As I said at the beginning there<br />
is nothing like seeing the story unfold and recognising<br />
your part in it to lift the spirits and firm up the<br />
faith. If nothing else, I hope that at this gathering the<br />
faithful have multiplied and that they will now go<br />
forth and tell the world.<br />
Thank you </p>
