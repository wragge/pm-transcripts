SPEECH BY THE PhIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. HENZIES AT THE OPENING OF THE McCAUGHEY<br />
INSTITUTE, C6REE, on SATURDAY, 19TH NOVEMBER,<br />
Sir, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
This platform has been placed with the most<br />
diabolical cunning. ( Laughter) The speaker can talk to you,<br />
and not one of you can look him in the eye" And this gives us,<br />
I think, a most unfair advantage.<br />
But, at the same time, I am very grateful to my old<br />
friend, Sir Hen-Manning, for what he said about my wife and<br />
myself, and I don't propose to make you look me in the eye for<br />
any longer than I need to, because Sir Henry Manning has<br />
really " done me" in the eye today,<br />
Last night at Coonong I said to him, with that boyish<br />
innocence that characterises me ( Laughter) " Harry, what" I<br />
call him " Harry"; I've known him for about a hundred years<br />
( Laughter) " Harry, tell me about this business. Jhat really<br />
should I be saying tomorrow?". And he told me all that last<br />
night. ( Laughter) Then, unblushingly, he gets up and tells it<br />
all to you; and leaves me without a feather to fly with.<br />
( Laughter) So, I can perhaps summarise what I want to say to<br />
explain the genuine pleasure that I have in being here, on<br />
what I regard as a most historic occasion. I don't regard this<br />
as some local event, though 1-cal events are very important.<br />
This is a national event occurring this afternoon.<br />
Because this tremendous enterprise is not only, and<br />
we all remember it with respect, a memorial to two brave men,<br />
it goes further than that as the years go by. It is a<br />
memorial to the generous and intelligent interest of a famous<br />
family; it is a memorial to all the people who have worked to<br />
create it, because most of it has been created over a period of<br />
years; it is a memorial to the profound instinct that we have<br />
in Australia, an instinct not easily dislodged, the instinct to<br />
realise that our strength is still in the soil, and our<br />
national woalth is still to be found in its products.<br />
This place sooms to me to be strategically, as one<br />
might say, magnificently placed, because wiork is going to be<br />
done in management, in fodder conservation, in breeding, in<br />
irrigation, in dry farming. 1.11 these various aspects of<br />
rural production will have concentrated upon them in this place<br />
not only the work of the theorists, but the practical<br />
application of the people who take up the works evolved in<br />
terms of theory. And it is strategically placed because, I<br />
venture to say, that within shooting distance of it, it will<br />
encounter practically all those types of farming, and all<br />
those types of problems.<br />
Younger men who are here today, of course, are<br />
familiar with the growing interest in research for the<br />
improvement of the products of the land. I'm old enough to<br />
remember at a place not so far from here, as the crow flies,<br />
up in the north-west of Victoria, up on the fringes of the<br />
Malleo when I was a si'all boy about the age of one of these<br />
handsome creatures down here I remember the agricultural<br />
expert coming up, it was a wheat farming area, and having a<br />
meeting out on a farm, of a number of the local farmers, and<br />
talking to them about using superJ<br />
It seems hard to believe that now. But there it was,<br />
when I was ten, or something like that, I heard this man talking<br />
about Supgrhposphates. I had to enquire afterwards, what on<br />
earth that mtanta </p>
<p>K 2.<br />
He mot a very sceptical audience. " Oh, this is a<br />
new fangled thing." " I've never done this before". " The old<br />
man didn't do it before". And they had to be persuaded. The<br />
better farmers in the district decided that they wiould make a<br />
compromise: they wouldn't put a hundredweight on that seemed<br />
grossly extravagant but they would try half a hundredweight.<br />
And they found, when the next season came in, that they wore<br />
two or three bushels up on the average of their particular<br />
area. So, it grew by practice and experience.<br />
That seems very elementary to us now. But the truth<br />
is that it is only in the lifetime of people like myself that<br />
wo have wakened up to the significance of genuinely<br />
scientific research. That, of course, is one of the great<br />
things that is going to ensure the future of Australia.<br />
If we were stagnant in production, if we were<br />
stagnant in quality, this country just couldn't receive<br />
additional population, as it does today. It wouldn't know what<br />
to do with them. It couldn't sustain great secondary<br />
industries as it does today; it couldn't maintain its volume<br />
of exports, and therefore look after our balance of payments<br />
if it were not for this constant drive for increased production<br />
and improved quality.<br />
This was seen with clear vision by those who created<br />
this Institute in their generosity of heart and in their<br />
generosity of mind, which is not less important. They saw<br />
these things. And the result is what we see about us today,<br />
and what we can, with the eye of imagination, I think, see in<br />
the future. I seem to be becoming a little research-minded myself,<br />
because yesterday morning I was opening a metallurgical<br />
engineering building at Lucas Heights, which is the nuclear<br />
power research station, conducted by the Commnonwealth, with a<br />
very distinguished band of scientific people.<br />
I ventured to say to them I thought it was a risky<br />
thing to say, but I get a bit of pleasure out of saying risky<br />
things that I wasn't too sold myself on space research. I<br />
don't mind other people doing it, I think that is all right, I<br />
don't mind the Russians firing up Sputniks and following them<br />
by other things with other names, and going " beep beep" in the<br />
midnight air I've no intrinsic objection to that. And I'm<br />
assured by competent people that much good may come of it,<br />
some day. But we, as a country of ten million people, have<br />
limited resources, and I believe that we must concentrate our<br />
resources, so far as they are available for research on the<br />
most useful, practical ends for developing this country and<br />
the lives of the people who live in it. Other great and rich<br />
countries can afford these other rather luxurious adventures.<br />
But we, in Australia, ought to be spending more, and more, and<br />
more money on research. It increases, I'm happy to say, year<br />
by year. But I want to see it, myself, primarily directed to<br />
satisfying human needs because it seemed to me a poor thing if<br />
we were to subtract a great deal of the national revenue in<br />
order to be able to say, " i4ell we've put up a satellite" 5 when<br />
in point of fact we have so many unsolved problems in<br />
Australia. If we are -oing to solve these problems we won't<br />
solve them just by money because although money is an essential<br />
commodity, money itself doesn't do the work. eJmo ust attract </p>
<p>more and more people into the scientific service of th-,<br />
country, not all, with great respect, nuclear physicists<br />
chemists, bio-chemists, biologists. All the people who can<br />
achieve so much in the future as indeed they have achieved so<br />
much in the past.<br />
I hope nobody here will ever forget that although my<br />
distinguished friend, Mr. Khrushchev, may claim that his<br />
country sent up the first satellite, and was the first to<br />
administer a rude blow to the moon, it is the countries of the<br />
western world who have been responsible for the bio-chemical<br />
improvements, for the anti-biotic drugs, for the prolongation<br />
of life, for actively combating disease, for doing all these<br />
things that have meant so much to men and women and children all<br />
over the world. ( Applause)<br />
As I said once, there are millions of people in the<br />
world who looked out and saw Sputnik going across the sky, who<br />
wouldn't have been alive to see Sputnik if it hadn't been for<br />
the superb scientific work of JWestern scientists. ( Applause)<br />
So let us remember that; let us understand as you<br />
do, so well, without being told by me in a hot sun let us<br />
remember all the time that we are not here looking at<br />
something that is hi-falutin' or theoretical or irrelevant.<br />
This research institute will take its place in Australia as one<br />
of the great constructive efforts to solve our national<br />
problems. ( Applauso) Every man connected with it, every<br />
woman connected with it, is entitled to our respect. They<br />
certainly have mine, They arc entitled to our gratitude. They<br />
certainly have mine.<br />
So, far from thinking that I confer a favour on<br />
anybody by coming down here today, Irogard it as a very great<br />
privilege to have been asked to come down here, becauseo as I<br />
end now by saying, what I said at the beginning, this is an<br />
event of first class national importance.<br />
Therefore, Sir, I suppose retrospectively, because it<br />
seems to have boon going for a little while, I declare the<br />
Institute open, and I will now unveil a plaque which I haven't<br />
seen; I don't know how to unveil it, but I'll. do my best,<br />
( Applause) </p>
