TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, NATIONAL PRESS<br />
CLUB, CANBERRA, 21 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Tracy Lois, Austereo News. Prime Minister<br />
the Chamber of Commerce says today's national account<br />
figures show we're heading for a recession and whichever<br />
Party's in Government on Monday they'll have to move<br />
immediately to bring down interest rates. Andrew Peacock<br />
says if it's him he'll make an announcement on Sunday to<br />
ensure the market moves on Monday. Will you be doing<br />
more than just ringing Bernie?<br />
PM: Well, let me refer to the national accounts and from<br />
that into interest rates, the two issues which you<br />
properly interlinked in your question. Of course, in the<br />
national accounts we see the confirmation now of the<br />
policies that Paul Keating and I, on behalf of the<br />
Government have been talking about. The reason of course<br />
why we had to have high interest rates was that in the<br />
previous year you had that gap of between the eight<br />
percent increase in consumption and the four percent<br />
increase in production and that led to a massive increase<br />
in imports which was unsustainable. And so we had to<br />
have high interest rates to reduce that level of<br />
activity. What the national accounts show now that that<br />
gap has been eliminated, total spending grew by<br />
percent over the year to the December quarter while<br />
growth in production was 4.2 percent. So that gap has<br />
been eliminated and what we're seeing is a situation in<br />
which you've got now an increase in net exports. So what<br />
weire seeing is not a move to recession, there's a<br />
reduction in consumption which there had to be and our<br />
activity is now being channelled into net exports which<br />
is precisely what we need to have. And that of course<br />
will1 enable us to move to a reduction in interest rates.<br />
Let me make the point that my comment about the reduction<br />
in interest rates is not simply my statement or the<br />
statement of Paul Keating, although Paul Keating in his<br />
release today with the national accounts has made for the<br />
reasons I've put, the judgement that the fall of interest<br />
rates will follow. But in a sense it's more important, I<br />
think, to look at what's been said recently by people<br />
within the banking industry and most particularly I'd<br />
like to share with you the thoughts of the Reuters screen<br />
last night. But just let me refer to a couple of the<br />
observations from the banks recently and the Sunday Age </p>
<p>recently. They said economists broadly agree that the<br />
conditions already exist or are forming for an easing of<br />
rates. March the 15th, when the labour force statistics<br />
came out, the Commonwealth Bank said the slowdown in<br />
employment over the last two years provides further<br />
evidence of the slowing in the economy which should allow<br />
for some further easing of monetary policy in the near<br />
future. Yesterday, the publication of the latest retail<br />
trade figures, the Commonwealth Bank said the January<br />
retail figures confirm the softer trend in consumer<br />
demand which should prompt a further step easing in<br />
monetary policy. And on the Reuters screen last night,<br />
in the context of what had happened in Japan, traders<br />
this is on the Reuters screen traders said credit<br />
markets ended the day firmer in anticipation of a further<br />
easing in monetary policy in the next few weeks assuming<br />
the Hawke Labor Government is re-elected at Saturday's<br />
federal election. The Reuters screen is right because<br />
what they are saying, what they are saying is OK, Hawke<br />
and Keating and the Labor Government have had the<br />
policies, they've suffered some flak. We were prepared<br />
to take the necessary hard decisions, but the national<br />
accounts reveal that those decisions are working. There<br />
is no need to fear a recession in any sense because we've<br />
had 4.2 percent growth in GDP over the whole of 1989, but<br />
the conditions have been filled, filled now for a<br />
reduction in interest rates. I confirm what my Treasurer<br />
said and that is that we'll be in touch with the<br />
authorities within a week or so of being re-elected and<br />
it is my judgement that, given the evidence of the easing<br />
in the economy, that I see very good prospects for a<br />
further easing in commercial rates and that expected fall<br />
on top of the earlier fall in commercial rates should<br />
feed through to mortgage rate reductions. Now I'll try<br />
not to make the rest of my answers as long as that, but<br />
you did get to national accounts and interest rates and I<br />
needed to go to all the facts. Thank you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Bob Bowden, SBS Television Prime Minister.<br />
You ' ye stated during the campaign that the pace of reform<br />
Australia can expect over the next few years will be<br />
quickened if you are re-elected on Saturday. I wonder if<br />
you'd explain how you expect to achieve that, given that<br />
on some evidence the Government's appetite for reform<br />
appears to have diminished and would you nominate the<br />
areas you see as the highest priority as part of that<br />
re-form process.<br />
PM: Well I, when I answered that question earlier I made<br />
the point, Bob, that in fact why I believe that there<br />
would be an acceleration in the rate of reform was that<br />
because we had, in fact, overcome the first hurdle. And<br />
that was that it's very difficult, when you've had an<br />
economy cosetted as this was for such a long period, and<br />
remember the stastistic, for 30 of the 33 years for<br />
of the 33 years before we came to Government<br />
conservatives in power, no micro economic reform at all.<br />
The easy assumptions of the lucky country, that it was </p>
<p>all going to fall into Australia's lap from a grateful<br />
world that loved us for some peculiar reason, that we<br />
didn't have to do anything. All the old attitudes would<br />
remain. Now we in seven years have done more to turn<br />
around those attitudes and institutions than has ever<br />
happened before. Remember in this place in December I<br />
issued the challenge to the conservatives, come up and<br />
point out any period in all your 30 years when you came<br />
within a bull's roar of our pace of economic reform<br />
deafening silence because they haven't. Now what we've<br />
done is had to tackle in these first years employers,<br />
trade unions, State governments and other institutions in<br />
this country who had been brought up in this atmosphere<br />
of conservative apathy and gutlessness. And now we have<br />
the situation where, in this last week, you can have<br />
users and employers in the waterfront coming out and<br />
applauding my Government for the reforms that it's<br />
brought about on the waterfront and saying, faced with<br />
the choice between our approaches which are going to<br />
involve 3,000 of the older waterside workers going out,<br />
thousand younger people being recruited, getting rid of<br />
the concept of pool employment which we inherited from<br />
the conservatives and having employer oriented<br />
employment, bringing about very significant improvements<br />
in productivity. On the, in the maritime industry, as a<br />
result of what we've done Australian manning levels by<br />
' 92 at the average of the OECD. Now what I'm saying is<br />
that to get to this position where these changes have<br />
taken place, reflected yesterday in the Metal Trades<br />
Award, this country had gone on for decades, for<br />
generations with an award, the centrally important award<br />
in our manufacturing industry, still going on with 360<br />
different classifications dating back to the beginning of<br />
this century. As a result of what we've done, getting<br />
the unions to face up to the challenge of change, getting<br />
the employers to face up to the challenge of change,<br />
that's gone. And instead of 360 ossified, irrelevant,<br />
counterproductive classifications, now 14 classifications<br />
which will facilitate training, retraining and the proper<br />
application of modern processes. But to get there just<br />
imagine the hurdles we had to overcome. So the point of<br />
my answer to your very important question is we've got<br />
over that. We've got now a receptive, cooperative trade<br />
union movement. We've got a much more enlightened band<br />
of employers, collectively and individually and<br />
government, State governments also. So I believe that<br />
bucause we got over that hurdle and seeing now the<br />
example, for instance, of the waterfront, the maritime<br />
industry, what's happened in the metal trades. I mean,<br />
if you can reform the Metal Trades Award then you're<br />
going to have a much easier road now to surge through<br />
with reform and all the rest of the award structure. So<br />
it's because the hard battle of changing attitudes has<br />
been won that I think we're going to be able to continue.<br />
You asked what were the most important areas. I think<br />
transport generally will continue to be very important,<br />
Bob, and I think with Ross Garnaut who referred not only<br />
to transport, he also identified as a very important </p>
<p>area, power generation. Now, so these things need to be<br />
looked at by the Industries Commission. We'll refer<br />
these things to them, but I think we've now created the<br />
environment, the attitudes for change, the preparedness<br />
on the part of Australian workers and management to<br />
understand that if we're going to meet the challenge of<br />
the future, then they've got to be prepared to abandon<br />
past practices and that's going to make it easier in the<br />
future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Laurie Oakes, Nine Network, Prime Minister.<br />
Why did you say yesterday it was reasonable to predict a<br />
two percent fall in interest rates in a relatively short<br />
time if you won the election? Why did you say that and<br />
then back away from it and why did Paul Keating claim you<br />
didn't say it.<br />
PM: Well, I had to confess, I had to confess that I got<br />
somewhat side-tracked by John Howard parenthesis. I had<br />
seen the report where John Howard had referred to the<br />
possibility of two percent reduction and I indicated<br />
that, you know, that may seem reasonable but I wanted to<br />
make it clear and it was pointed out to me that I may<br />
have left that impression, I didn't want to leave it and<br />
I shouldn't have got carried away by the John Howard<br />
parenthesis. Because I have been very careful, right<br />
throughout this campaign, to point out two basic things.<br />
And that's what I've continued to do and what I've done<br />
today. That is that if you're going to get reductions in<br />
interest rates which can be sustained, then you have to<br />
have the fundamentals of economic policy right. And<br />
fortunately today what we've seen is the further<br />
confirmation that those policies are right. We've<br />
eliminated that great gap between consumption and<br />
production and that means that the conditions are right<br />
as has been said within the banking industry and the<br />
Reuters screen and so on that don't knock the Reuters<br />
screen, it's very important, very important and they've<br />
said, they've said that the rates can come down. So<br />
you've got to have the policies that are right. That's<br />
the first thing and it's working. The second, I repeat,<br />
and perhaps I should have been more astringent yesterday,<br />
I don't walk away from that, that the decision will in<br />
fact be made within the banking industry. What we will<br />
do and do it with a great deal of vigour and do it early<br />
on our re-election is to say to the central bank that it<br />
i-s-the strong view of Government that all the evidence is<br />
there now to justify a further reduction in rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Jim Middleton, ABC Television News. On page<br />
three of your speech, you talk about fighting to realise<br />
a vision for an Australia, an export oriented economy.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: In line with that you recently gave $ 12<br />
million to the Kodak Company. Now the Kodak Company has<br />
announced a competition in which they are giving away $ 12 </p>
<p>million, an intriguing similarity I think you will agree.<br />
What does giving $ 12 million to Australian punters do for<br />
an export oriented economy? Shouldn't you reconsider the<br />
decision? PM: Well, good try, Jim, but the two things are not<br />
connected as I'll point out to you and it's quite simple<br />
to understand I give you the facts. Kodak's promotion<br />
is purely related to its film retailing operations. The<br />
bounty is solely related, solely related to Kodak's<br />
manufacturing operations, both for the domestic and<br />
export markets. And the terms of the bounty, the terms<br />
of the bounty dictate that there be no cross subsidy from<br />
Kodak's manufacturing operations to any of its retailing<br />
or processing operations. Now Kodak's always run film<br />
promotions in the past and will continue to do so no<br />
doubt into the future, well after the bounty finishes.<br />
And we have the situation where Commonwealth bounties go<br />
to, and other types of assistance, go to hundreds of<br />
Australian companies but that doesn't give us a right to<br />
involve ourselves in any way in their promotional<br />
activities. And we go back to the basis of the decision<br />
in regard to Kodak. Very simple. We had there a company<br />
which was the second largest exporter of elaborately<br />
transformed manufactured goods and as a result of the<br />
decision that we've taken, we will have a position where<br />
they are going to see exports more than double on an<br />
annual basis, from just under $ 100 million currently.<br />
And we calculatedly made the decision that it we<br />
weren't entirely happy with the decision and I said that<br />
at the time, but we had to make up our minds whether we<br />
were going to see the loss of this major export capacity<br />
or not. We made the decision that we shouldn't lose it<br />
and, as I say, in the terms of the bounty arrangement it<br />
is clearly spelt out that there shall be no cross subsidy<br />
from the manufacturing operations which are in question<br />
to any of its retail processing operations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Paul Lyneham from the 7.30 Report, Prime<br />
Minister. This morning the Treasurer's Office told me<br />
that the Commonwealth net debt overseas is $ 9.25 billion.<br />
Yesterday in your interview where you didn't say interest<br />
rates would go down by two percent, you also said,<br />
talking of the $ 17 billion surplus you've accrued over<br />
the last three years, the Budget surplus, you said ' we<br />
have used that' and this is your own official transcript<br />
' we have used that to pay off every cent of Commonwealth<br />
Government overseas debt'. Isn' t that what would be<br />
known in some quarters as a bit of a porky and secondly,<br />
on what will likely be the key issue of the campaign, are<br />
you concerned about the appearance of elitist enclaves of<br />
rich white Anglo Saxons in Vaucluse and Toorak?<br />
PM: I may say something about that last little bait you<br />
threw out, I'll think about that one. But on the<br />
question of debt the position is quite clear that on the<br />
latest figures that I've seen that when you take into<br />
account in regard to the Commonwealth Government its debt </p>
<p>and its assets we are net creditors to the tune of $ 4.4<br />
billion. And I don't resile from that at all. That's<br />
the position. If you put against our liabilities our<br />
assets, in international terms we are creditors to the<br />
tune of $ 4.4 billion. But as you go to the question of<br />
debt,' let me, let me just expand briefly on that. We<br />
have addressed this issue constructively throughout the<br />
campaign which is the opposite of what's in fact been<br />
done by our opponents. We have in place a coherent,<br />
inter-related strategy to deal with the debt problem of<br />
Australia. It's in three parts essentially. The first<br />
is, and it's absolutely essential that you have it, we<br />
have a wages policy which can ensure the continued growth<br />
of a competitive Australian manufacturing industry and<br />
the continued growth of services. We've had 54 percent<br />
growth in manufactured exports in the last four years,<br />
that sort of thing will continue. These latest national<br />
accounts confirm the fact of the move to a stronger net<br />
export position. Against that wages policy that we've<br />
got to enable that outcome, our opponents have a position<br />
where they will guarantee a wages explosion. Secondly in<br />
regard to dealing with the debt problem, we have a<br />
surplus $ 17 billion surplus you referred to, over the<br />
last three years, and that's being used to pay off debt.<br />
Against that you have the fiscal irresponsibility of our<br />
opponents which would blow the surplus. And thirdly we<br />
have a national savings plan statistics,<br />
straightforward, when we came to office in superannuation<br />
funds $ 17 billion, now $ 100 billion, calculated by the<br />
end of this decade under our policies to grow to over<br />
$ 600 billion. That will mean that we will be developing<br />
the savings of Australia in a way which will reduce the<br />
call by Australian enterprises on overseas capital.<br />
Against that again, in superannuation, the Opposition<br />
promises the smashing of the award based superannuation<br />
system. So the facts are there in regard to our own<br />
position and, generally speaking in regard to debt, we<br />
have the policies to deal with it and our opponents have<br />
not. Now about these enclaves in, I just caught the word<br />
enclaves, in Vaucluse and Toorak, I just didn't quite<br />
catch the way which you put it. Is it a serious<br />
question? If it is, please repeat it.<br />
JOURNALIST: something about an enclave<br />
PM: Well I may be getting a question, I don't know, on<br />
the question of the Multi-Function Polis but I will limit<br />
myself to your concept of enclaves by saying this. That,<br />
as you put it geographically, I inherited with my<br />
colleagues in 1983, a Government, a country which was a<br />
country of enclaves in terms of opportunity. And the<br />
most glaring example and the most damning indictment of<br />
the Conservatives in that respect was in the area of<br />
education. There can be no more damning indictment of a<br />
government than that it goes out of office after seven<br />
years virtually leaving the retention rate in our<br />
education system unchanged. That is the proportion of<br />
kids staying on in school. It moved up from 34% to 36%. </p>
<p>They walked out of office with only one in three of our<br />
kids staying on in school. That was the enclave of<br />
Australia that I hated because you had imposed upon the<br />
education map of Australia a pattern of enclaves. There<br />
was no doubt whatsoever that the kids from the wealthy<br />
suburbs were going on in the education system as they<br />
should, they have every right to, but they had no more<br />
right, no more right than the kids from the poor to the<br />
middle class suburbs. But that was the pattern of<br />
privilege, the pattern of enclaves as far as the<br />
education map of this country was concerned and we have<br />
changed that. In seven years not no change but now it is<br />
nearly two in three of our kids and so that pattern of<br />
education, the map of Australia has changed. Instead of<br />
the enclaves of opportunity, now the kids are streaming<br />
on in the education system from all the suburbs. So we<br />
did inherit an Australia of enclaves in just about the<br />
most important and fundamental sense you can talk about.<br />
Because what is more fundamental than that basic building<br />
block of the education of your kids, and it was an<br />
Australia of privileged enclaves. Not any more after<br />
seven years of Labor Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dennis Grant, Prime Minister, from the Seven<br />
Network. The clear winner in this election campaign so<br />
far seems to be cynicism, but perhaps followed by apathy.<br />
You raised this yourself in your speech when you urged<br />
the cynics to think again because as you said the stakes<br />
are high. I wonder if politicians are not alone at fault<br />
here, that maybe we in the media have to cop some blame<br />
as well. I think that is maybe because we take politics<br />
in this country as a spectator sport rather than a<br />
participation game. What can be done do you think by the<br />
media and the politicians to reignite hope and perhaps<br />
regain some confidence?<br />
PM: I regard this as a very significant question. I<br />
think the last part you mixed up another issue. You<br />
mixed up, you were talking about cynicism and apathy in<br />
the first part and then you brought in confidence. But<br />
let me deal with the first part of the question where you<br />
were talking about cynicism and apathy. I have had time<br />
to read Laurie Oakes' article this morning in The<br />
Bulletin and Laurie's thesis there basically is that<br />
those who say that there is boredom in this campaign he<br />
repudiates that and I must say that I tend to go along<br />
wi-th the Oakes' interpretation rather than the more<br />
general one of this being a boring campaign. I don't<br />
reject the proposition that there is perhaps more<br />
cynicism in the electorate about the major parties. I<br />
accept that there is evidence to sustain that<br />
proposition, although I don't think that the evidence of<br />
a higher vote for the Democrats and the Greens generally,<br />
is just to be ascribed to cynicism about the major<br />
parties, Dennis. Because I am sure that if you look at<br />
politics around the world one thing just strikes you<br />
right between the eyes is that there has been a growth<br />
everywhere of interest in environmental matters. So </p>
<p>people do want to give evidence of that being their major<br />
concern and that is why I think you are going to have<br />
more people voting for Democrats and the Greens than<br />
before. But I don't walk away from the thrust of your<br />
question that there probably is some more cynicism about<br />
than there was before. I'm glad you gratuitously suggest<br />
that it is not just the politicians' fault, that the<br />
media has got some responsibility. I had a talk with one<br />
editor and a journalist during this campaign when this<br />
issue was raised. I asked them a question when they came<br />
up and talked about cynicism. I said would you tell me<br />
when you wrote in your paper an article about the hard,<br />
unremitting work that politicians do. You talk about how<br />
we misbehave ourselves in the House, and we do behave<br />
rather poorly at times, myself included accepted, but how<br />
many times, I asked them, have you written a story about<br />
the work that politicians do in the committees, on both<br />
sides I am not talking just about Government. Hard,<br />
tough work they do in committees, either of their own<br />
Government parties or of the opposition or joint<br />
parliamentary committees. How often do you write about<br />
that? How often do you write about the hard undramatic<br />
and unrewarding work in the electorate of politicians?<br />
And I know that politicians of both sides work bloody<br />
hard out of their electoral offices, meeting the needs of<br />
their representatives. Well I ask you today how many<br />
articles have you written about that work that they do in<br />
the parliamentary system, and they do out of the<br />
electorates. There was a sort of sheepish grin of<br />
acknowledgement nothing. Now if all you are going to<br />
get in the media is the cheap shot and where the shot<br />
should be put at it, ok of course it should be done. But<br />
if all you are going to get about the parliamentary<br />
system is the cheap shot and no exposition about the<br />
tough unremitting work that goes on outside the actual<br />
chamber of parliament and in the committee system, within<br />
each house and between both houses and the hard work they<br />
do in the electorate, I guess the electorate is going to<br />
get a pretty cynical view of politicians. Now let me<br />
finalise that by saying I accept that all of us in the<br />
political arena have got room to lift our game, from the<br />
Prime Minister through to lowliest back-bencher, we have<br />
all got the capacity and the room to lift our game. But<br />
I do think that you have very fairly gone to the point<br />
that the media may have something of an obligation too to<br />
show that a hell of a lot of hard work is done for which<br />
pcriiticians get no credit at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: David Barnett from The Bulletin, Prime<br />
Minister. While you have been Prime Minister on the<br />
foreign debt again the gross foreign debt has gone up<br />
from $ 38 billion to $ 150 billion. Given that your<br />
economic strategies remain basically the same, wages<br />
policy which was just referred to, tight fiscal policy, a<br />
tight money policy, one that's sustainable for very<br />
long. Is there any reason to think that at the end of<br />
three more years the foreign debt shouldn't be around </p>
<p>I V 9<br />
$ 210 to $ 220 billion? If that is not a good figure, what<br />
would your figure be?<br />
PM: Well basically your figures aren't, I'm not avoiding<br />
the thrust of your question, but you are using gross<br />
figures and everyone who writes about this acknowledges<br />
that it is the net figures that are appropriate and I<br />
will give you the net figures. There has a been a<br />
substantial move in the net figures, it has been from 23<br />
to 118. They are the relevant figures and we are not in<br />
argument about that though. Now let me explain what have<br />
been three factors basically involved in the growth of<br />
the debt. Firstly, of course, with the devaluation of<br />
the Australian dollar which occurred early in our period<br />
in office, by definition there was a revaluation of the<br />
Australian debt and that had its impact upon raising the<br />
figure firstly. Secondly, we had the very significant<br />
decline in the terms of trade in ' 85/ 86 and that had its<br />
impact. And thirdly, we have had the massive surge in<br />
investment in recent years which has given us investment<br />
0 as the highest proportion of gross domestic product in<br />
our history. Those are the three factors which have been<br />
involved in the lift in debt. It is very interesting to<br />
notice David though that if you are talking about trends,<br />
and certainly as a proportion of GDP, that virtually the<br />
position has been stabilised since the middle of the<br />
1980s. Debt as a proportion of GDP peaked in about<br />
September of ' 86 at about 34% of GDP, it is now about<br />
33%. What we have seen in the period in the latter part<br />
of ' 80s is two conflicting elements which have operated<br />
to keep the proportion of debt to GDP pretty stable.<br />
Firstly, you've had, as far as the Commonwealth<br />
Government is concerned, the running down of our debt and<br />
that surplus of $ 17 billion that I have talked about and<br />
the activity of the Government to turn around the net<br />
public sector borrowing requirement which was turned<br />
around by eight and a quarter percentage points. So you<br />
have had that massive impact from what we can do directly<br />
p tcoo mmruendiutcye. theB utp ubalsi cw e dheamvaen d beuepno n dtohien g rtehsaotu rycoeus ohfa vet healso<br />
as I say had this massive surge in investment. Now that<br />
investment that has been taking place and which is<br />
reflected in the debt figures is not something which is<br />
all bad. I mean if you look and let's take the most<br />
conservative element of the access economic figure the<br />
billion of investment which they identified which is<br />
al-ready under construction or committed. They say that<br />
that will be bringing in about $ 5 billion additional<br />
foreign income in the years ahead. So as we have been<br />
playing our part to reduce the demand on the community<br />
savings, the business sector has been very significantly<br />
increasing investment which is going to have its pay-off<br />
in the years ahead. The other element that needs to be<br />
taken into account David when you are thinking about this<br />
is of course something which fortunately the Reserve Bank<br />
went to in some detail in an article the other day and<br />
this is something that Paul and I have talked about quite<br />
a bit which hasn't been picked up so much and that is the </p>
<p>massive increase in Australian equity investment abroad.<br />
When we came to office that figure stood at $ 7 billion.<br />
That has now increased up to a point where it is now<br />
nearly $ 50 billion. It is an increase of over<br />
billion in Australian equity investment abroad. In other<br />
words if that hadn't taken place David, the foreign debt<br />
now wouldn't be 33%, it would be 22%. But because of the<br />
encouragement that Australia has given, this Government,<br />
that investment abroad has taken place and that is giving<br />
Australian companies access to foreign markets and to<br />
foreign technology which is going to be so vital to<br />
Australia's future. It is earning us some $ 3 billion in<br />
income as well. So I am not avoiding David the fact that<br />
we need to be concerned about foreign debt but I am<br />
saying that it's essentially been stabilised in the<br />
latter part of the ' 80s. And if you look at the<br />
components of it there are very positive elements for our<br />
future. But the final point I make in terms of the<br />
election is this. The Australian people have to ask<br />
themselves which of the two parties have the policies to<br />
deal with this issue and I have gone over this before so<br />
just let me very quickly recap them. We have the<br />
policies in terms of, one, a wages policy which will<br />
continue to create a more competitive Australian<br />
manufacturing and services sector which can increase the<br />
range and breadth of our exports and reduce that profile<br />
of exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Against<br />
that the Opposition has no wages policy, they have a<br />
certain prescription for a wages explosion. Secondly, in<br />
regard to fiscal rectitude, we have done what they never<br />
could do. Never once in all their years in office could<br />
they get a surplus. We have, $ 17 billion and we will<br />
keep the surplus intact, but they will dissipate the<br />
surplus. And thirdly, we have got a massive national<br />
savings program through superannuation, they will blow<br />
it. Those are the questions that have to be asked when<br />
you talk about the debt.<br />
JOURNALIST: Bruce Juddery from Australian Business Mr<br />
Hawke. I'm afraid it has got to be a double bunger.<br />
PM: Bruce, I always expect at least a double bunger from<br />
you, mate.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm being generous to you today.<br />
PM-. Thank you, thank you.<br />
JOURNALIST: On page seven of your speech, Prime<br />
Minister, when you are indulging in product<br />
differentiation with the Opposition, you make the point<br />
that young people don't want more uranium mining, uranium<br />
industry in Australia, and so on and so forth, they<br />
shouldn't vote for the other lot. Am I not correct in<br />
believing that the Labor Party has an enquiry into the<br />
subject of uranium mining and enrichment and the jury is<br />
still out. I am wondering what Mr Kerin, for instance,<br />
who is strongly in favour of uranium mining, Senator </p>
<p>Button who also wants uranium enrichment here, they put<br />
in submissions along those lines. Even Gerry Hand went<br />
out of his way in his submission to say that the<br />
Aborigines don't object to uranium mining. I am<br />
wondering who you might turn of f with that particular<br />
suggestion. The second bung. Is the MFP, Multi-Function<br />
Polis, dead? And who do you blame if it is? Do you<br />
blame Mr Peacock for wrecking the potential<br />
bipartisanship with anybody who was going to put money<br />
into investment for 20 years duration would require, or<br />
do you blame Will Bailey of the ANZ Bank who was Chairman<br />
of the national committee here, and who has deliberately<br />
kept the wraps on the whole process of evaluation for the<br />
last year, and refused to publish some of the more<br />
interesting and imaginative proposals of his team because<br />
he believes that they should belong to the rich companies<br />
which have already invested in the Multi-Function Polis<br />
Australia Research Limited.<br />
PM: Thank you Bruce for those important questions. The<br />
first one, yes there is an inquiry going on within the<br />
ALP on uranium mining. But that is not the jury, I mean<br />
that is in a committee. The decision will be made by the<br />
Party and it is my assessment that for and I am<br />
expressing my view that for a combination of economic<br />
and other reasons that the Party will not be in favour of<br />
any further mining. And I think on economic grounds it<br />
is probably a very strong case for that quite apart from<br />
other considerations. Now let me go to the second part<br />
of your question. The Multi-Function Polis. Now you<br />
asked really is the Multi-Function Polis dead. Well I<br />
guess you would have to say that if the Coalition were to<br />
win the election, as it stands now, the Multi-Function<br />
Polis would be dead. Although one has to ask a question<br />
even there, I guess, when you look at how the decision<br />
was arrived at. Now let me remind you Bruce, what<br />
happened in regard to the position of the Opposition on<br />
this. Here we were going along through an election<br />
campaign, Multi-Function Polis, no. No issue. The<br />
position of the Opposition, quite clear. Let me quote<br />
it. Here it was in the Sydney Morning Herald the week<br />
before Andrew Peacock. This I quote, when<br />
they were asked policy, his exact words, " the<br />
proposal is unique for Australia and deserves extensive<br />
consideration". Got it. That was the position of the<br />
Opposition stated publicly in the Sydney Morning Herald<br />
tt1M previous week. I repeat it. " The proposal is unique<br />
for Australia and deserves extensive consideration"<br />
What was the statement by the Minister involved, the<br />
Shadow Minister involved, Mr Howard? Very clear. I<br />
quote him, " I don't think we should bury the concept in a<br />
sea of hostility before we know anything about it". Now<br />
there you are. Last week. Not bad is it. Unique to<br />
Australia, deserves extensive consideration, and the<br />
Minister involved, the Shadow Minister involved,<br />
shouldn't be buried in a sea of hostility before we know<br />
something about it. Now something happened on the way to<br />
the forum. What was it? There was Mr Peacock with his </p>
<p>travelling press crew, and I'm told, I wouldn't describe<br />
these as leaks, I mean it's just these sort of<br />
intercommunication channels that exist in these matters.<br />
But I am told nary a word to those travelling with him on<br />
the Thursday. But something happened. The faxes went<br />
out on the Thursday. Thursday night. So much so that<br />
Senator Stone was able to say on Thursday night it's<br />
dead. He told us, and he told you then on the Friday,<br />
that he didn't make up his mind until the Friday. Didn't<br />
tell the travelling press with him, but shoved something<br />
into the media boxes. Mr Howard wasn't consulted. Now I<br />
go to these things just because your question is, is it<br />
dead. Well it doesn't seem to me that the position of<br />
the Opposition has really been thoroughly discussed.<br />
Pretty hard to come to that conclusion isn't it. Where<br />
was the discussion in their Shadow Cabinet? And how did<br />
it happen? Did they get a bit of research shoved under<br />
their nose and suggest well this might be something that<br />
is worth throwing in? Mr Howard wasn't involved. So I<br />
have got to say that if Mr Peacock were to win the<br />
election, a totally hypothetical position as far as I am<br />
concerned, and if he were to remain Leader of the Liberal<br />
Party, which is also somewhat hypothetical, then you<br />
couldn't even say in those circumstances that the MFP is<br />
dead. Because there hasn't been this consultation, and<br />
most importantly because the basis upon which he purports<br />
to put his position is totally flawed. Let me examine<br />
that aspect of it. He has said that he is against<br />
enclaves, he's against enclaves. Well let me read to<br />
you, December ' 87, and here is a statement of principles<br />
agreed by the Commonwealth and State Governments. The<br />
following principles should guide Australian<br />
participation in the joint feasibility study of the<br />
Multi-Function Polis. Principles for, let me read it,<br />
develop the MFP as an entity which is not an enclave but<br />
is linked with the remainder of the Australian economy<br />
and provides a leading edge testbed and technology<br />
transfer. So here he comes out and says, I am against<br />
enclaves, when it is laid down, has been since December<br />
' 87, that the concept of an enclave must be out.<br />
Secondly, he says that he relies on the report. Well you<br />
say that Will Bailey was keeping things under wraps.<br />
Very interesting to note that September last year the<br />
Opposition Leader provided with the opportunity to be<br />
fully briefed, no keeping under the wraps, provided the<br />
opportunity to be fully briefed, he declined to accept<br />
that, and says that he reaches his position now. In<br />
defiance of all that his Party has said before, in<br />
defiance of what Mr Howard has said on his reading of<br />
this document. Now, I bet my bottom dollar that he<br />
hasn't read the whole lot of it, but let me go to what<br />
the consultancy report says. To just destroy the basis<br />
of his proposal. What it says is very It says it<br />
should be said that this is not a final conclusion on<br />
feasibility. Overall feasibility will be determined by<br />
the Australian and Japanese Governments which will<br />
receive a report from the Joint Steering Committee by the<br />
of June 1990. They say, this report concludes that </p>
<p>the Multi-Function Polis is a compelling concept. This<br />
is what he is relying on to throw it out. They are<br />
saying it is a compelling concept. And then let me go to<br />
what they say in regards to the economics of it. He is<br />
quoted from economic statistics. What do they say about<br />
the economic analysis. He says, " that analysis must be<br />
regarded as a first attempt to understand the<br />
Multi-Function Polis in terms of the Australian national<br />
economy. Its conclusions are necessarily tentative and<br />
heavily qualified". And yet he tries to out the<br />
proposition on that basis. Finally, and let me just go<br />
to the total hypocrisy of the Peacock position. I mean<br />
you have already seen it is hypocritical because he<br />
bases it on an objection to an enclave and from December<br />
1987 that has been ruled out. He bases his position on a<br />
report which provides him with no basis, but look at what<br />
they had to say in their policy statement. Have a go at<br />
us, page 19. Labor's foreign policy has too often been<br />
driven by domestic political considerations. Now you<br />
have a massive full-on insult to our major trading<br />
partner by rejecting the MFP out of hand, because that is<br />
not driven by domestic political considerations at all.<br />
But in it page 20, what they say needs to be<br />
done. We need to revitalise our economic relationship<br />
with Japan to a new framework of co-operative trade<br />
marketing research opportunity. I mean have you ever<br />
seen such an opportunistic action by a leader of a<br />
political party, I would like to know what it is. You<br />
have four adventuristic, opportunistic, domestic,<br />
political reasons thrown out the window, something which<br />
your own Party has said is unique, unique opportunity for<br />
Australia, should be thoroughly looked at, shouldn't be<br />
sunk in a sea of hostility, and there you go and do this.<br />
I think the facts speak overwhelmingly for themselves,<br />
and I conclude my answer by saying this. No, the<br />
Multi-Function Polis is not dead because fortunately<br />
Mr Peacock will not be in a position, he has shown he is<br />
not worthy to be Prime Minister of this country. He has<br />
shown it before this week, but if ever an issue and its<br />
handling showed that he was not fit to be Prime Minister<br />
of this country, this has been it. The future of this<br />
country depends absolutely on attracting to this country<br />
the very best technology we can from overseas, from<br />
Japan, from the United States, from Europe. Bringing<br />
here and marrying in Australia the best technology that<br />
we can with an increasingly well trained Australian<br />
workforce. Not in an enclave, because we never would do<br />
that. And any Leader who would jeopardise the capacity<br />
of this country to attract such technology, is not<br />
deserving of the support of this community. So we will<br />
proceed with the analysis, with the feasibility study,<br />
and if those reports show that the concept can be<br />
proceeded with in a way which is consistent with<br />
Australia's best interest, its sovereignity and its<br />
integrity and its needs, then it will go ahead.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) a part of that saying a<br />
passage had been included without your authorisation. </p>
<p>14<br />
I'd like to know how a letter signed by the Prime<br />
Minister comes to have something included without his<br />
authorisation. Don't you insist on reading things in<br />
their final form before signing them. And if you didn't<br />
in this case, why not? What is the value of a Prime<br />
Minister's signature on anything if, when there is a bit<br />
of controversy he can turn around and say, I didn't say<br />
that bit? And if something if published with your<br />
signature, and you're responsible for that publication,<br />
notwithstanding the letter from the person in the<br />
Victorian Attorney-General's Office, shouldn't the buck<br />
stop with you and with no-one else?<br />
PM: I accept that the responsibility for that letter<br />
going out in the end must stop with me. Of course I<br />
can't deny that. But I must say that I regret very<br />
deeply the fact that the person concerned, without my<br />
authority, included that sentence. I don't know what<br />
more I can do than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Milton Cockburn) Prime Minister, will you<br />
match the Liberal Party's promise that they will hand<br />
back each year the proceeds of bracket creep?<br />
PM: Well I am in the position where I can match my<br />
commitment, Milton, by looking at the record. And of<br />
course the fact is, as has been demonstrated by<br />
independent sources just within the last week, that under<br />
the decisions that I, with my colleagues, have made in<br />
Government, the Australian people have got back more by<br />
the tax deductions that we have implemented than they<br />
would have got simply by the application of bracket<br />
creep. Putting that the other way, in seven years we<br />
have more than given back bracket creep. But may I just<br />
make this point quickly in regard to taxation and the<br />
expectations of the community as to what sort of deal<br />
they get out of us or the Opposition. Just let me remind<br />
the Australian electorate at this late stage of the<br />
campaign what is proposed in terms of the Coalition for<br />
their taxation policy in their next term if they were<br />
elected. They propose to adjust the taxation scheme by<br />
bringing in what they are pleased to call a flatter<br />
two-tiered system. What will that mean? What's the<br />
revelation of their concept of equity in tax. Let me<br />
tell you, and through you, let me tell the people of<br />
Australia. Under their proposal, someone on $ 17,000 a<br />
year annual income, would get the princely reduction of<br />
a week. If you are on average weekly earnings of<br />
about $ 28,000, you would get a reduction of $ 4.73 a week.<br />
And if you were the Prime Minister, you would get a<br />
reduction of $ 104 a week. Average weekly earnings<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I said this to Mr Peacock<br />
yesterday, so in fairness I should say it to you today.<br />
My question was quite specific in regards to promise.<br />
PM: Yes, I have done that. But I was getting a bonus<br />
in, and I won't be as rude. I think you should do that. </p>
<p>It is perfectly even-handed. Perfectly even-handed. And<br />
I am very naughty, I thought I had answered the question.<br />
The answer is, of course, yes. Because I have done it<br />
for seven years and I will do it for the next seven<br />
years. More than do it for the next seven years. But I<br />
was getting in a bonus, Milton, and saying that what they<br />
are proposing in regard to their taxation policy was a<br />
concept that it is fair taxation to give himself as Prime<br />
Minister more than $ 100 a week tax reduction while he<br />
gave the average bloke $ 4 a week. That doesn't fit with<br />
mine. The answer to your question is yes.<br />
BARTON: That's where we run out of time.<br />
PM: Can we have one more?<br />
BARTON: No.<br />
