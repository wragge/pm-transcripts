TRANSCRIPT PRIME MINISTER WITH JEREMIY COHDEAJX, RADIO STATION 5DN ADELAIDE<br />
WEDNESDAY, 27 NOVEMIBER, 1985<br />
Cordeaux: What do you think of the approval ratings In the Bulletin today?<br />
John Howard slumping by Was that a surprise?<br />
PM: Well It's pretty hard to be objective in these things<br />
Jeremy, but I can say it Is not a surpri~ se because the perf'ormance of the<br />
current leader of the Opposition in Parliament since he's been there have<br />
been pathetiC and he has been part of an opposition now which has degeneraLed<br />
Into the worst factional fighting seen In any party in Australia at the<br />
Federal level I think for 30 years or more.<br />
Cordeaux: I mean a surprise to the extent that the interest rates<br />
In Australia are so high, most people with a mortgage you've got to cop that.<br />
? tM: Well you see Jeremy, the Interesting thing about the people<br />
of Australia is that they have the capacity of looking at things on the<br />
whole, they understand that we are now in our 3rd year of growth, the economy<br />
Is growing, we've got record rates of employment growth and we're in a<br />
situation where there's external pressures on our dollar and It's been<br />
necessary to firm up monetary policy to protect the dollar we've d9ne<br />
that and good old Mr and Mrs Australia out there, they haven't got their<br />
economic degrees and so on, but they have a pretty sensible understanding<br />
of the totality of what's going on, and they like It.<br />
C: But I was just thInking If you were In opposition, you would<br />
be bucketing the [ Liberal Party, If they were In government, you would be<br />
puttin% In the~ buoLts.<br />
PM: That's like saying If your Aunt had a different anatomical<br />
construction she'd be you Uncle, I mean that's nonsense because when we<br />
were in Opposition we were able to attack the government because they were<br />
producing the worst economic recession In the history of this country<br />
well since 1929. Now that's the reality and we were able effectively to<br />
attack and when I became leader I was able to, with my colleagues, knock<br />
them over because what they were doing economically was appalling, they're<br />
not able to do it now because what we're doing Is to turn the economy around.<br />
We've got record rates of growth, record rates of employment growth, so<br />
to say ' if' the roles were reversed is nonsense.<br />
C: Put It this way, they are not making the most of the situation<br />
with regard to the Interest rates and the value well what's happening<br />
to the Australian dollar?<br />
.2/ </p>
<p>PM: The Australian dollar is firming up, it's now I haven't<br />
seen this mornings rates, but yesterday It was back up to 69, it had been<br />
down 30 or so below that, its coming up and Its coming up, In response to<br />
our policies. If you have to have a firm monetary policy which means higher<br />
interest rates to protect your dollar and In the process your dollar comea<br />
back up again, that shows that your policies are being effective. Now what<br />
I'm sayIng which, with respect~ you're not grasping Imediately, Is that<br />
the Australian people, your audience, are able to understand that when yu<br />
make a Judgment about a total Australian economy you look at all the factorb,<br />
and you look at the factors which mean that we are now going into our third<br />
year under thIs government at 516 economic growth, which has -meant the highest<br />
rate of employment growth in this country that means that their kids,<br />
the kids of your listeners are now getting the opportunity at Jobu that<br />
they didn't have before and that they're doing this within containable levels<br />
of Inflation and they're seeing Improvements In the education system, they<br />
are seeing the situation where the rest of the world is saying, look, Australia<br />
Is doing brilliantly we've had the head of the OECD, the International<br />
organisation, out here and referring to our policies saying the outcomes<br />
are brilliant. Now they have the capacity, your ordinary listeners, as<br />
well as the specialist commentators come out here and look at Australia<br />
as a whole and say, this Is a brilliant performance.<br />
C: Would you say that the Australian dollar's performance is<br />
brilliant and surely that has got to be a vote of International no confidence<br />
In your government.<br />
PM: Well Jeremy I'm sorry I haven't got the'time to give you<br />
a sort of outline of what economics Is about, but If you say that the decline<br />
in the dollar Is a vote of International conriderice Ini Lhe government,<br />
wP11 C: No-confidence in the government I said.<br />
PM: Well a vote of no-confidence In the government well that<br />
means . what does that mean, that in the last week they'Ive now voted in<br />
confidence because It has gone up. Look, I'm sorry we have to have<br />
C: Well give me a quick lesson<br />
PM: I think that Is a bit what the situation In regard<br />
to the dollar is t~ hat we, when we came in In 1983, said we were going to<br />
abandon what had been a Fixed exchange rate, that meant that the authorities<br />
flad to come In and operate on the money market to maintain the exc. hange<br />
rate at the level that it had been fixed by the authorities. Now we aid<br />
that is silly, It's best to have a floating exchange rate where the market,<br />
the operators In the market, exporters Importers speculators if you like,<br />
have not got to operate against the government, they've got to operate against<br />
one another. Now we had a situation there where the current account balancesi<br />
of Australia had over a period or time, we believe, built up in an unsatisfactory<br />
way against us because of a previous over valuing of the dollar under previous<br />
governments, a situation where the structure o1' our Industry hadn't been<br />
competitive and when * the market forces were then left free to make Judgmien~ t<br />
they brought the value of the dollar down for those reasons.<br />
.3/ </p>
<p>3. C: So that was Inevitable?<br />
PM4: Once you free the dollar up, once you float a dollar, volatility<br />
is Inevitable. Now wait a minute. If you want to raise an Intricate subject<br />
dont delude yourself, if you raise an Intricate subject that you can have<br />
an answer that occupies 30 seconds I mean It's your idea to say that you<br />
want a lesson on one of the most Intricate subjects in the world, and then<br />
you want a 30 second edition.<br />
C: Let me just say this. When people see their mortgage ratea<br />
going up and up and up, I mean basically people probably don't want a lesson<br />
In economics, they just want to understan( J why It's happerning arid Is it<br />
going to 3top.<br />
PM: Let me say this to you. I explained as there was pressure<br />
on the dollar and it went downwards, we didn't want the dollar to just be<br />
going down in free fall. Therefore, It was necessary to firm up monetary<br />
policy, that made your Interest rates go up, it made the Australian<br />
having Australian holdings more attractive and In the event with this tightenlig<br />
up of monetary policy, that has halted the decline that was taking place<br />
In the dollar. We thought It had gone too far. Now you do that to achieve<br />
the purpose or maintaining the exchange rate at a level that is not going<br />
down too low. That has been achieved. Part of the process what did<br />
you say?<br />
C: Wouldn't you say It Is too low now?<br />
PM: Of course you wouldn't say it was too low now.<br />
C: Well what is acceptable<br />
PM: Look If you wanted to sayY0 m, g) ori ng to have a particular<br />
level and that's the acceptable level, you don't float the exchange rate<br />
and you Impose all the additional pressures on Intereut rates. I mean the<br />
proposition that you would by saying look we'll pick out let's say for example,<br />
740, for some magical unexplained reason 740 Is the rate at which we will<br />
hold it now if we're going to do that, In a non-floating situation, the<br />
pressures on your interest rates would be enormous because the government<br />
wouid then De in having to manipulate the money markets In a way which you'd<br />
have to push Interest rates up far beyond where they are now, and you would<br />
really have people complaining about the-levels of Interest rates.<br />
C: Just tell the average Australian mortgage holder whether<br />
Interest rates In your opinion are going to remain fairly * tat√± c" the<br />
way they are, they're going to come down, they're going to go up, make A<br />
forecast for me.<br />
PM: No I will not make a forecast for you and you're totally<br />
irresponsibie in asking the Prime Minister or a Treasurer In a fairly volatile<br />
situation to say that. I mean Its the height of Irresponsibility, I mean<br />
you really ought to know better than that, because If the Prime Miniater<br />
or the Treasurer were to say, look Interest rates tire going to move this<br />
way at such and such a tIme, that of Itself becomes a factor in the Market,<br />
and you really ought to know that it's both irresponsible for you tW ask<br />
and you certainly ought to know me well enough, to know that I wouldn't<br />
do It. What 1 will say Is this, to the people of South Australia who have<br />
some interest in this matter at the moment that If they had the misfortune </p>
<p>to have the Liberals in this situation, Mr Howard is saying that he would<br />
lift the interest rate ceiling which we've got on mortgage rates, they would<br />
be paying with every increase of 1% in the housing mortgage rate, would<br />
be another $ 30 a month, that's what Mr Howard says ought to happen he<br />
believes that you ought to lift that, of course Lhere is a vast confusion<br />
difference and confrontation between Mr Olsen and Mr Howard because Mr Olsen<br />
says, no no no, you shouldn't do that, so depending on which Liberal they<br />
believe, they could be facing a very, very much higher burden of interest<br />
rates in this country than they are under this government which has said<br />
while we will have a firm monetary policy as Is appropriate In the circumstances<br />
and which I believe is generally judged to be appropriate in regard to housing<br />
interest rates we're not going to lift that ceiling.<br />
C: One of the things that the Liberals here have said is that<br />
they would like people to own their own housing trust homes, and it has<br />
now been said that's illegal, that's not on. I understand that when<br />
John Olsen first floated this Idea, he said okay well that agreement is<br />
going to have to be renegotiated to accommodate that, legally. Well why<br />
not use this as a test case and try to provide trust renters with ownership<br />
right across Australia.<br />
PM: Minds greater than Mr Olsen's, have been dealing with this<br />
subject for a fair while1including people of his own political persuasion,<br />
The Commonwealth State Housing Agreement is the product of negotiations<br />
between the Commonwealth and all State Governments, including the Queensland<br />
State Government National Party and the Liberal Party in Tasmania, Mr Grey's<br />
government, and this has been negotiated and signed, it's a legally binding<br />
document, across the political spectrum because it is recognised as being<br />
the most appropriate way in which funds can be channelled from the Commonwealth<br />
into the States to ensure that you provide the maximum amount that is<br />
economically possible into low cost public housing. I think it is worth<br />
raising the question, If so many minds right across the political spectrum<br />
have worked out that this is the best way of handling this matter and have<br />
signed a legally binding agreement, just a reasonable question, do you think<br />
Mr Olsen in the desperation of a political campaign in South Australia is<br />
more likely to know best, or is it not the case that this is another example<br />
of the opportunism of Mr Olsen who some five weeks ago described as outrageous<br />
outrageous he said and moved an urgency motion in the House against Mr Bannon's<br />
interest subsidy plan, and now has jumped around and said no no, that's<br />
the right thing to do. Now this man of opportunism who really doesn't bring<br />
to bear a historically vast knowledge of matters economic is it likely<br />
he is going to know best on this.<br />
C: Well would you preclude anybody, any one single person<br />
coming up with an idea that will make thesystem better?<br />
PM: No I wouldn't. What I do say is that we draw upon the best<br />
knowledge that there is, not only in the Commonwealth but in the States<br />
and across the political spectrum in a context where people aren't fighting<br />
a desperate political campaign and devoting themselves to the issue. I'm<br />
saying that Mr Olsen has discredited himself as a serious operator in this<br />
area a man who gets up 5 weeks ago and says that something to do with<br />
housing is outrageous and 5 weeks later as a matter of political expediency<br />
says no, that's a good idea, you don't Lake him seriously.<br />
.7IG7 i0!<br />
i MIN' 05i </p>
<p>C: But you can see somebody saying to himself, well why would<br />
Mr Hawke or Mr B~ annon or a La3bor Government stand between me and owning<br />
this house at a discounted price. If you've got to renegotiate the agreement,<br />
rene~ otiate it.<br />
PM: In the renegotiation of the Agreement what would nappen<br />
i3 tUaL the~ flow of funds upon which the whole operation Is predicated between<br />
Commonwealth and States would be Interrupted if you have now a ' entirely<br />
new concept introduced. If you'd like, let me say, to have Mr Olsen explain<br />
why hi~ s predecessors In governmento or his political persuasion, and the<br />
people or the same political persuasion in the other states have in fact<br />
operated under this system for so long and why It Is just now, why is It<br />
just now in this political campaign where he switches and changes and does<br />
everything that Is oportunistic that he's hit on something that Is right<br />
and better which has never been accepted by any of his polItical colleagues<br />
before. Ask him that, why has It just happened now.<br />
C: If It's a good Idea let's do It. Liberal or Labor, If it<br />
is good for people In homes and lets them Into home ownership, why for political<br />
reasons knock the idea.<br />
PM: It is not a question or letting In the home ownership, under<br />
the agreements now, there are provisions for people being able to acquire<br />
homes at the market rate if you<br />
C: Why not at better than market rate?<br />
PH: Because you are having a totally artificial what you<br />
are saying is that you're going to be able to buy a discounted operation<br />
Interfere with the forces of the market through such an agreement that Is<br />
operated so. It is just a non again, If you want to have a long dissertation,<br />
on the housing economics, we can have it If you like,..<br />
C: But surely Prime Minister, the economies of scale the way<br />
public Dousing Is built, the economies of scale automatically mean that<br />
people should be able to buy those houses cheaper.<br />
PM: It's not a question by Introducing discounting values for<br />
housing built under this scheme, that's got nothing to do with the economies<br />
of scale, the purposes of the Commonwealth Housing Agreement are to funnel<br />
funds between the Commonwealth and the States in a way In which ensures<br />
that there Is a given amount which Is about a 50% increase under my Government<br />
I might say, over what was there before under the Liberals, an increase<br />
in funds to be allocated to public housing. You don't you're not really<br />
deluding yourself out by them coming Into that and saying, now we'll introducV<br />
into that a discounted rate of selling to tenants, that that does 3omethlng7<br />
about increasing the volume of the houses available are you?<br />
C: No. I'm saying public housing will be cheaper, therefore<br />
that cost saving could be passed onto PF-0: piecLive buyers.<br />
.6/ </p>
<p>PM: But it is reflected. It you are operating now through the<br />
various state housing commission systems as you do, with the Commonwealth,<br />
you are In fact getting to low Income people the benefits of that special<br />
provision of funding as it Is. They are going to be able to rent the houses<br />
cheaper than they would otherwise be able to do. You are then Introducing<br />
an entirely new concept if you're going to say now we're going to discount<br />
the sale price, you're going to be doing that, you're going to be introducing<br />
another element into public funding which means you're going to have less<br />
funds available for other social priority purposes. This proposition Jeremy,<br />
that ' oh yes, we'll do that', you've got an Inexhaustable public bucket<br />
of money, 1 would have thought you and certainly Mr Olsen, If he knows anything<br />
abouL public finance would know It's stupid. If you that, If you're going<br />
to cut revenue by introducing another element there, that's less you've<br />
got to do something else. You're suggesting that if he does that, if he<br />
introduces the1d0iscount, does this, reduces the funds available, that he's<br />
still going tooeverything else In the social welfare area because If he's<br />
going to, that means he's got to increase his taxes, money doesn't grow<br />
on trees, if he reduces the amount of money available to him by doing that,<br />
tLhe hie's got to cut out on something else or increase taxes, and that's<br />
a simple political arithmetic of it.<br />
Caller: Mr Hawke, I would like to know your policy on small business.<br />
We own a small business in partnership and we're having quite a bit of trouble<br />
with discrimination agalnst us with multi-nationals.<br />
PM; Can you give me some details of this discrimination?<br />
Caller: They &amp; et benefits that we can't get.<br />
PM: What's the business, and what are the benefits. They are<br />
11oL poInt. ess questions I'm putting to you because they may well be illegal<br />
under the Trade Practices Act, so if you-can give me the details of those<br />
discriminations that you're experiencing I could take them down and see<br />
whether in fact they are against the provisions of the Trade Practices Act.<br />
Caller: We own a small waste disposal business and a lot of the<br />
multi-natlonals have got keys there Is only one main tipping area In<br />
Adelaide, and a lot of mu) tl-nationals can get keys to the dump where we<br />
can't, for dumping after hours. Now If one of our customers ring up and<br />
want dumping done that night if there Is a fire or something like that,<br />
we can't get into the dump to do so, whereas the multi-nationals can.<br />
PM: Who are the multi-nationals that you're talking about?<br />
Caller: I would rather not say because there's only one dump and<br />
we could be discrJminated against even more.<br />
PM: I'm just rather interested to know that in the waste disposal<br />
business in Adelaide that multi-nationals are operating.<br />
Caller: There are, quite a few.<br />
PM: Nobody knows who you are, can you tell me wno the multinationals<br />
are that are operating In waste dumping.<br />
Caller: I'd rather not say.<br />
' 54/ </p>
<p>7. C: Naming the company is not going to&amp; anything other than just<br />
give the PM some more informiation.<br />
PM: If you've got a real problem, I need to know the facts and<br />
I know you're talking about waste disposal and that there are multi-nationals<br />
who can get keys that you can't. Now If you can tell me who these muitinationals<br />
are, well we might be able to see if something Illegal Is happening.<br />
Caller: Well it Is Cleanaway that runs the dump Cleanaway, belongs<br />
to Brambles, I'm not sure and then there Is another one that belongs to<br />
I can't think who they belong to but they belong to multi-nationals.<br />
PM: If you were to write into Jeremy and give Jeremy the details<br />
of what you're talking about, and the companies that are Involved in the<br />
practice, I could undertake 1 would have the Issue referred to our relevant<br />
sections of the department which deal with the Trade Practices provision and<br />
the supervision of proper competitive practices and i1r In fact, there's<br />
something being done that constitutes Improper trading practices, then we'll<br />
see what we can do to help. I think you'll appreciate we need to have more<br />
dctaI13. C: Quickly before I take another call PM, what's your reaction<br />
* to the ACTU dumping of the BLF, what do think Is going to happen to the<br />
union now?<br />
PM: Well I welcome unreservedly the decision of the ACTU, it's<br />
the right decision, these people for some period of time the BLF have disqualified<br />
themselves T believe, from membership or the great tradition<br />
of Australian trade unionism and now I think that before I go on to<br />
say that, you must appreciate there Is a case before the Arbitration Commission<br />
where we're seeking the declaration from the Commission for the next step<br />
that when we as a government can then deregister, what thIs meis Is that<br />
if that process goes ahead, and I say the ' if' depends not on our Intention<br />
we have to wait for the declaration from the Conunisslon, we will immediately<br />
move If that declaration is given as 1 believe it will that means that<br />
other unions will be then free to pick up people on the sites and enrol<br />
them in their unions. Now it's time, and that's why we passed the legislation,<br />
it's time that the Australian community Is cleansed from the thuggery and<br />
the evil of the BLF.<br />
C: And it is a clear warning I take It that you are sounding<br />
to other unions, that there are rules and there are ways and means, legal<br />
ways. PM: Let's be fair to the rest of the trade union movement.<br />
There Is no other union like the BLF.<br />
Cal~ ler: I would like the government to take some pressureoff pensioner's<br />
who are trying to save money to buy a home, we are in housing trust, as<br />
1 heard you talking about housing trust homes awhile ago, we don't necessarily<br />
want to buy a housing trust ho~ e, but we would like to one day have a home<br />
of own. But the system is so that pensioners who earn money when they're<br />
working can only have up $ 20 a week extra coming In on top of their pension.<br />
I don't think it is very fair because we have rio aasets, no caravan, no<br />
boat, and we are trying to keep our head above water and we're just getting<br />
pushed into the gutter all the time because afterall, the money that we<br />
earnt when we're working, we're entitled to have, and we definitely can't<br />
save on pensions. My parents being older are entitled to pensions, to age<br />
pensions. : 7 e </p>
<p>PM1: Ruth, you would have noticed In the recent announcements<br />
that have been made by the Treasurer in regard to the whole tax package<br />
there have been significant Increases in the what had previously been<br />
there allowed as additional elements before you sacrificed part or your<br />
pension, and that was a deliberate reform or the tax package to increase<br />
the amounts of eligible income that social welfare beneficiaries could receive,<br />
it's to remove or substantially reduce what In the language of the social<br />
welfare industries call poverty traps, and that was I must say has been<br />
very warmly welcomed by workers In the social welfare because they recognise<br />
these sort or problems that you are referring to, that there was very great<br />
difficulties for people who were on pensions or social welfare, they earnt<br />
a little bit of extra Income and they could run Into marginal tax rates<br />
of 100% or more. And so that's why wc have increased the amounts In this<br />
announcement by the Treasurer to goa considerable way to try a meet thils<br />
sort of problem that you're talking abou.<br />
C: PM, a lot has been made in the lead-up, well In the election<br />
campaign, the advertising, about you elect a Liberal government and the<br />
Labor government in Canberra Is not going to smile too kdndly upon your attempts<br />
as a Liberal government to get the submarine contract. You have, and I'm<br />
quoting from a telex now, that the Prime Minister has given a further<br />
assurance that decisions about the submarine project would be made only<br />
on the merits of the case presented by each state, and would have nothing<br />
to do with the politics Involved. Would you like to develop that a little<br />
bit? PM1: Well all our decisions are made on merits, what I have said<br />
In regard to S. A. IS this. That S. A. Is really only In the' ring as a result<br />
of the efforts of one man, and that's Mr Bannon who virtually single handedly<br />
has mounted a campaign, and a very impressive campaign, to put before the<br />
Federal Government the merits and virtues or the South Australian case for<br />
a major place in the Australian construction or our next submarines. He t<br />
has acquainted himself with the technicalities of this issue in an absolutely<br />
outstanding way, he's acquainted himself with the capacities of S. A. to<br />
do the job, Internationally he's undertaking a study of what's Involved,<br />
and if it were not for John Bannon, South Australia would not be up at the<br />
starters gun if I can use the language of the Grand Prix now let me<br />
finish. Now what I'm saying is, that he is better equiped than anyone to I.<br />
put the case and South Australia is up there and In the ring because of<br />
him, and he has a capacity on the issue, an access to us which is secorid<br />
to none, and when the project definition studies are completed that's<br />
the phase we're In now then SA will be very, very well placed to be<br />
considered on Its merits and It will be that much better placed becauseV<br />
of the work of John Bannon in given the experj~ nce he's acquired, obviously<br />
a continuity of representation is going to be~ zouth Australia's benefit.<br />
C: But If you say the only consideration will be on the merits,<br />
you really do take It that they're clearly out of the political arena,<br />
regardless of the sentiment involved. </p>
<p>PM: Merits are there, facts exist, and the facts have 1o be<br />
communicated, there has to be a constant puLIng or fat<br />
C: You mean a Liberal government couldn't put those facts as<br />
effectively. PM: I'm saying they have not to this point, involved themselves<br />
obviously as a Premier Is going to do, but I'm saying he's done it<br />
outstandingly well, he's Involved himself and he's Impressed everyone with<br />
whom he's dealt. Mr Beazley, myselr and those who have to deal with decisions<br />
on the merits have been outstandingly Impressed In the way In which<br />
Mr Bannon has assembled the case, has brought the racts together, 5o that<br />
we now have an opportunity or looking at this Issue In the light of the<br />
assembled facts. Now we're going to have to do that against the background<br />
as I say of the project definition study, which is being under-Luken at this<br />
time and you can't make a decision In advance of that. But no state could<br />
be better placed to have its factual case considered when those project<br />
definition studies are completed than could SA as a result of the work or<br />
Mr Bannon.<br />
Caller: I'm one of those very disillusioned with the government.<br />
When the next election comes up I don't think I will vote one way or the<br />
other because I spoke to Jeremy yesterday and I said nobody gives a damn<br />
about us. Well the point Is, I'm on a pension, I have been for uume year-so<br />
and T was able to retain a job for a couple of months, a very menial position,<br />
and I have to walk ten minutes to the bus each morning In the dark, I was<br />
allowed to earn $ 1500, and they took $ 256 tax which left me $ 1100 or something,<br />
It still wasn't the $ 1500 but that was my gross, so I gave that up and then<br />
I thought I would Set the $ 256 back but not only did they take that but<br />
they sent me account for another $ 75. It's just too much isn't it*.<br />
PM: Well I've just answered a previous question on this, In<br />
this sort of area. The facts are these that in the overall review we<br />
are doing of tax and the relation between tax and social welfare benefits,<br />
that we have done two things, made two decisions which are relevant to what<br />
you are talking about. Firstly, that we are increasing the amounts that<br />
can be earnt so that you don't get the Impact of what we call these poverty<br />
traps where you get very MIgh marginal rates of tax being imposed as you<br />
earn these amounts beyond your pension; and secondly, that we are Increasing,<br />
reasonable substantially, the tax threshold below which you won't pay arty<br />
tax at all, so that you'll find as these changes come In as part of the<br />
overall tax package, the situation that you are talking about, will be quite<br />
significantly improved.<br />
C: You can see where May, $ 75 from a lady who gets up 6 o'clock<br />
In the morning to go and get a few extra dollars, there are people who are<br />
making millions and getting away with blue murder.<br />
PM: And I understand that where we moved to ensure greater equity<br />
In the whole area of pensions by ensuring that those who had millions or<br />
dollars of assets weren't getting the pension. So that people like May,<br />
they could get more. We received from a number of people Including a lot<br />
of misguided people, opposition because we were directly attacking that<br />
sort of an equity. The point that May goes to is a relevant one, and I<br />
remind her that the basic taxation system which operates Ii this country that<br />
has been built up over the last 36 years about 31 of thout have been<br />
Liberal governments, they've established the basic framework in thI3 country,<br />
and we're now gradually being able to bring more equity into It, and that's<br />
precisely what we're about in these changes that I have just referred to<br />
that we will reduce those poverty traps that I referred to and Unait are<br />
M% WPJFPTA7TMQ r7'. 1 </p>
<p>afrecting May, and increase the threshold Delow which people will not be<br />
payin8 tax.<br />
Caller: PM I would like to ask what your government Is planning<br />
to do about those young people who are not going to be taken up by traineeships<br />
In 1985/ 86 and beyond. Now given that your government is looking at<br />
creating 10,000 tralneeships for young people who are severely disadvantaged<br />
In the employment market, as a youth worker I work with young people who<br />
probably are not going to get a look in on the traineeships because they're<br />
so severely disadvantaged in terms or their employability, that they really<br />
aren't looked at by employers In any way that is favourable at all. In<br />
this state In 1985/ 86, the service provision for young people under the<br />
community support scheme will be reduced from anything from 20-100% in individual<br />
projects. I would ike to hear what you have to say about funding for<br />
CYSS programs, particularly in this state, but throughout Australia.<br />
PM1: Well 1 have to put It In national terms and what applies<br />
nationally will be reflected proportionately here in SA. But what we've<br />
done Is we've received a great deal of approbative comment from people In<br />
the CYSS, not only to substantla l~ y increase funds but we've put them on<br />
longer term funding Oasis so that the problem that existed In the past,<br />
which I certainly was concerned about, has been substantially reduced<br />
that is that they got funding for a twelve month period, they had no<br />
certainty as to whether that was going on and that made planning difficult<br />
and of course great uncertainty In terms of the people to be benefited<br />
from the operation of CYSS schemes. Now the funding has been put onto<br />
a longer, I think 3 year basis, so that CYS5 projects will have that very<br />
substantial uncertainty removed, so that taking together the Increase In<br />
funding and the turning over of it to a longer term basis, we believe we've<br />
very substantially assisted in that area. And certainly those that are<br />
involved have expressed their satisraction to us. Gould I just go a bit<br />
beyond the CYSS aspect of your question as Important as that is. We have<br />
tried to have a totally intergrated approach to this question of the problems<br />
of young people, and the tralneeships Is only just one part, albeit a very<br />
important part, of what we're doing. We are as well consolidating a number<br />
of other employment schemes which Involve the community and bringing them<br />
together with the increased funding capacity so that the community and<br />
community organisatlons can be better assisted to help with the problems<br />
or the sort of young people that you're talking about. More generally<br />
we are going to ensure that within the whole education training sy5Lem by<br />
rationalising the youth incomes support payments that. there Is going tobe<br />
as much Incentive for young people, including disadvantaged young people,<br />
to stay in the education stream rather than going out onto the unemployment<br />
benefits. It has been, I believe, a stupidity that has allowed to hiave<br />
emerged over the years that thiere's more Incentive for young people and<br />
to their families, to allow young people to go onto unemployment benerits<br />
rather than just stay in the education system. So that within two or three<br />
years we will. have eliminated that gap and there will be no further Incentive<br />
for young people to do that there will be the incentive for them to stay<br />
In various training and education systems. So that in thia integrated<br />
way we believe that as we go towards the end of this decade, we will have<br />
done a very great deal to change the face of the youth unemployment training<br />
problem. 1 II..<br />

1/. . S rr.-wP. a r </p>
<p>Caller: Firstly let me say I'm 20 and I've got no complaints.<br />
I just wanted to say that I agree with the non-fringe benefits thing that<br />
is going on, because my husband works and he takes a rritz, cheese and<br />
lettuce sandwich to work every day, and don't see why his taxes should have<br />
to pay for other businessmen to have a nice lunch.<br />
PM: Good on you Karen, you're absolutely right. You're In exalted<br />
company. Could I just read to you what the Federal President of the Liberal 7<br />
Party, MrValdelr,, had to say because he talks about this as a disease. He<br />
said, I think again to reverse the whole disease, if you like to call it<br />
a fringe benefits, which had developed over a decade or more. This is what<br />
he had to say in July or this year, he called It a disease, and said that<br />
Mr Keating who'stackling this was trying to do It In one stroke and he said<br />
what was being tackled to do this wasa fair and just thing In this country.<br />
The longer we leave doing it the harder it Is going to be. The great tragedy<br />
or course, Karen, is that while the President or the Liberal Party refers<br />
to this disease as it has been, condemns It and says something should be<br />
done about it, of course of political opponents have been as opportunistic<br />
as they always are, and say oh well, that's no we think It i3 a fair<br />
thing for the Karens of this world and the great majority of ordinary people<br />
to pay for the tax free lunches of a few.<br />
Caller: The way I think of It Is these businessmen ply other people<br />
with food just to make a deal then they can't be very good businessmen in<br />
the first place.<br />
PM: That's not a bad point Karen I mean I just have a laugh<br />
to myself when I hear them say that this business lunch was Important to<br />
do this deal, the deal was worth millions of dollars, if a deal was worth<br />
millions and millions of dollars and if Its not that Important that you<br />
can't finish it up without having the Karens and the ordinary tax payers<br />
of this world pay for a free lunch, well then you're a funny sort of businessmen.<br />
You're absolutely right.<br />
C: Seeing that this subject has come up. You know that the<br />
restaurantuers and the hospitaJlty industry generally is mounting a fairly<br />
stiff campaign against John Bannon on this, and the assertion 1.5 basically<br />
that If John Bannon Is not elected it will be a kick In the pants to bob<br />
Hawke and his fringe benefit tax. Would you accept It as a kick In the<br />
pants if John looses the election?<br />
PM., Well it won't happen and I'd he will win the election<br />
and win It well. And so It is quite an absurd thing to say. A much more<br />
realistic proposition is that I should put it to you and to the Liberal<br />
Party, when Mr Bannon wins the election, will you take that au an enidursement<br />
of our tax package?<br />
.12/ </p>
<p>12.<br />
C; Well obviously John Bannon is now distan~ cing himself and<br />
saying I don't agree with what's happening with regard to loss of jobs.<br />
PM: What's the loss of jobs?<br />
C: Well they are saying it Is about<br />
PM. Well just let me give you the facts, I mean I know you've<br />
talked about this restaurant business and the implications. It Is . to tally<br />
unwarranted on the evidence, totally unwarranted and misleading cam paign.<br />
Let me give you the facts. These are the official statistical facts about<br />
what's beeni happening the period since this was announced. Now, this Is<br />
from the Commonwealth Employment Service. Vacancy notifications in the<br />
hospItality Industry rose by 20%, that's from 8,078 to 9,726 between September<br />
when the tail measur-eu were announced and October this year. Over 12 months<br />
to October, vacancies rose by 21%. The total 0or 300 vacancies recorded<br />
In November 1985 was the second highest on record and 50% over the<br />
corresponding count for November 198A4.<br />
C: So what do you make or that?<br />
PM: Well what I make of that is a total that destroys<br />
the proposition that we've had a 30% reduction In jobs. These are the notifications<br />
of vacancies In the Industry. The two months this year since the announced<br />
taxation changes vacancies were 37% higher than for the same two months<br />
of' last year. It was Interesting, there was a comment just the last couple<br />
of days when there was supposed to be this great organisation for this<br />
enormous demonstration outside Parlilament House Canberra. The President<br />
of the Queensland lroresslonal Catering Employees Association was reported<br />
as saying ' that a hundred rather than five hundred restaurant workers would<br />
march on Parliament today, their plans were scaled down oecause the workers<br />
were toc, busyl. If they really believe that the mass of ordinary South<br />
Australians are going to be taken In by this than I believe they are<br />
insulting the intelligence or their voters because the great mass of people,<br />
like Karen, they pay their taxes, they take their lunch to work, they've<br />
goi no rorts and they find It offensive that over the years they've had<br />
to pay more taxes so that the prIveltged few can have their lunches paid<br />
for by the ordinary taxpayers of this country.<br />
C: Are you going to do a deal with Democrats?<br />
PM: Let me make It quite clear what Paul Keating and I have<br />
aid about this question. We have said that the Substance and basis, the<br />
main thrust of the taxation package Is not going to be changed. We are<br />
prepared to talk with the Democrats, there may be some areas of fine tuning...<br />
C: Not phasing in, but fine tuning?<br />
PM: No, some areas of fine tuning that we have to get the<br />
legislation through the Senate.<br />
C: But you are prepared to make some compromise, even If It's<br />
fine tuning.-rw<br />
PM: Yes, but not to~ basic substance of the package. </p>
<p>C: What would you regard as fine tuning.<br />
P14; I think It is appropriate that the Treasurer and the Democrats,<br />
are allowed to talk about that rather than me supervising It publicly from<br />
the sidelines on air. But I repeat to you Jeremy, that the basis of that<br />
tax package Is not negotiable. The main principles and thrust of it are<br />
not negotiable. We hope from what the Democrats have said that, and I believe<br />
this to be the case, that they take the view~ that the-government is entitled<br />
to have Its package through. Now If they want to as I say, discuss with<br />
Paul some elements which don'It go to those basic principles, and that means<br />
their support will forthcoming or otherwise it might'n be, well then<br />
obviously, sensibly as a government you've got to listen to what they have<br />
to cay 0 Pml it's good to see you.<br />
PM: Jeremy, it's been good to be with you again, I appreciate<br />
it very much, and I would also like to thank listeners for their calls.<br />
