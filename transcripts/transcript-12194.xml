I am pleased to announce a $38m plan by the Federal Coalition to support investment and jobs in Tasmania.<br />
A stronger Tasmanian economy and a higher standard of living for its people is the centrepiece of our plan for Tasmania.<br />
We will be funding new measures to :   make it easier for tourists to come to Tasmania;    improve important roads and upgrade tourism infrastructure;    significantly improve telecommunications; and  further boost Tasmania';s credentials in education.<br />
A complete list of measures is attached.  These initiatives represent a real plan to boost economic growth and jobs in Tasmania.<br />
These measures build on the Coalition';s strong track record in promoting growth and jobs in Tasmania.  Initiatives such as $110m in support through the Regional Forest Agreement, $150m through the Natural Heritage Trust, $20m for the Abt Railway and introduction of the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme have all played a valuable role in Tasmania';s development.<br />
The ALP stands condemned for offering a package of smoke and mirrors that provides no real support for Tasmania.  The ALP offers no real support for investment and jobs.  The ALP has no plan for Tasmania. </p>
