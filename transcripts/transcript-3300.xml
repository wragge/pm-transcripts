Press Statement No. 272<br />
14 June 1974<br />
WIFE OF PRIME MINISTER TO LAUNCH NEW ANL SHIP<br />
( Statement by the Australian Minister for Transport, the<br />
Honourable C. K. Jones, M. P.)<br />
The Australian Minister for Transport, Mr C. K. Jones,<br />
said today that Mrs Margaret Whitlam, the wife of the Prime<br />
Minister, would launch the Australian National Line's new vessel,<br />
Australian Emblem, in Japan on 9 August.<br />
The launching of the 23,000 tonne vehicle/ deck container<br />
vessel would take place at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries Shipyard<br />
in Kobe, and was scheduled to enter the Australian/ Japan trade in<br />
December this year.<br />
Mr Jones said that the new ship would join the Eastern<br />
Searoad Service, an integrated container service, comprising the<br />
Australian National Line, Flinders Shipping Company Limited,<br />
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, IK' Line) and a consortia of three<br />
other Japanese Lines, Nippon Yuesn Kabushiki Kaisha<br />
Mitsui-O. S. K. Lines Limited and Shinnihon Steamship Co.<br />
Limited Line).*<br />
This large, fast vessel was the first of the E. SS.<br />
second generation and had been designed to meet the requirements<br />
of the trade between the two countries particularly in respect<br />
of refrigerated cargo.<br />
" The vessel's design is a further development of the<br />
concepts well known to the Australian National Line. It embodiesthe<br />
vehicle deck and cellular container concepts. This ensures<br />
fast handling and turnabout times. This feature has particularly<br />
attracted shippers to the Eastern Searoad Service," Mr Jones said.<br />
The vessel had an overall length of 223 metres, a beam<br />
of 30 metres and a draft of' 10.36 metres. It also had a capacity<br />
of 1410 x 5.9m containers.<br />
Another vessel of the same type on order for the Flinders<br />
Shipping Company Limited, an Australian Flag Company, was scheduled<br />
to join the E. S. S. Service in mid-1975. The cost of both vessels<br />
was $ 209~ each. </p>
