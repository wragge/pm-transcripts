FOR MEDIA Monday, 28 March 1983<br />
The Prime Minister has written today to the Premier of<br />
Western Australia, Mr Burke, indicating the Government's<br />
concern at the damage and loss of life caused by widespread<br />
flooding in the Shires of Kimberley West and Halls Creek<br />
in the North-West of the State.<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to the Premier's proposal to<br />
implement flood relief measures under the Natural<br />
Disaster Relief Arrangements providing grants for relief<br />
of personal hardship and distress, grants for the<br />
restoration of public assets and, if necessary, concessional<br />
loans to pastoralists.<br />
The Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements incorporate a<br />
range of standard relief measures which State Governments<br />
may invoke in response to major natural disasters in the<br />
knowledge that Commonwealth assistance will be forthcoming<br />
on a $ 3 Commonwealth to $ 1 State basis, once the State has<br />
met its base expenditure under the Arrangements.<br />
Mr Hawke also advised the Premier that the Commonwealth is<br />
prepared to give prompt and sympathetic consideration to any<br />
request for additional relief measures, should this prove<br />
necessary following an inspection of the affected areas<br />
by the State Minister for Emergency Services. </p>
