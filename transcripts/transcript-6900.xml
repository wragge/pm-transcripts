,, AUSTRALIA~<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 MAY 1986<br />
I received an urgent message last night, 1 May, from the Papua<br />
New Guinea Prime minister, Mr Paias Wingti, seeking assistance<br />
from the Australian Government in the provision of a Hercules<br />
aircraft to transport urgently needed chemicals, protective<br />
clothing and equipment for the treatment of coffee fungus rot<br />
which has been identified in the Baiyer River area of the Western<br />
Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The disease is threatening the<br />
$ 300m a year coffee industry, a most important element in the PNG<br />
economy.<br />
The minister for Defence has approved the availability of a C130<br />
Hercules for this purpose. The aircraft is on standby at RAAF<br />
Richmond Air Base and will depart for Papua New Guinea as soon as<br />
the chemicals and materials identified by PNG authorities have<br />
been procured. It is hoped the aircraft will depart this<br />
afternoon direct to Mount Hagen.<br />
The Natural Disasters Organisation has responded quickly in<br />
co-ordinating assistance required to meet this request from the<br />
PNG Government.<br />
I am pleased that the Government is able to assist the PNG<br />
Government in their efforts to eradicate the coffee rust disease.<br />
I have conveyed to Mr Wingti my personal wishes for the PNG<br />
Government's early success in eradicating the disease. </p>
