SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, 2<br />
THE HON, E. C. WHITLA1l, 0l. C,, M. P.,<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF AUSTRALIA<br />
FESTI\' AL OF CREATIVE ARTS AND SCIENCES,<br />
LAKESIDE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, CANBERRA,<br />
7 MARCH 1975 4<br />
OCCASIONS SUCH AS THIS ARE AMONG THE REWARDS, IF NOT THE<br />
LUXURIES, OF POLITICAL LIFE, WHERE ELSE BUT IN POLITICS<br />
W'OULD ONE FIND MORE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS, MORE REFINED<br />
COMPANY, A GATHERING OF SUCH DIVERSE TALENTS AND RARE<br />
MI1NDS, AN ATMOSPHERE OF SUCH LIVELY DEDICATION TO ALL THAT<br />
IS BEST AND MOST CULTIVATED IN OUR SOCIETY? THIS IS A<br />
UNIQUE FESTIVAL BRINGING TOGETHER THE ARTS AND THE<br />
SCIENCES AND BRINGING THEM BOTH TO A WIDE AUDIENCE. '~ E<br />
HAVE HAD ARTS FESTIVALS BEFORE, WE HAV/ E HAD SCIENTIFIC<br />
EXHIBITIONS BEFORE; BUT I CANNOT REMEMBJER AN OCCASION<br />
WHEN THE TWO WERE COMBINED SO SUCCESSFULLY, SO LOGICALLY<br />
AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PLANNING FOR AUSTRALIA 75. IT<br />
IS A TRIBUTE TO THE ORGANISERS; AN HISTORIC EVENT IN TH~ E<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NATIONAL CAPITAL; A DEMONSTPATION OF<br />
THE HIGHEST ATTAINMENTS OF A NATION'IS CULTURE AND THE<br />
HIGHEST VALUES OF OUR CIVILIZATION, i @/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
NOT LONG AGO A FRIEND SENT flE A COPY OF THE LATE<br />
DR. JOHN BRONOWSKI ' S BOOK THE ASCENT OF MIAN. SOME OF<br />
YOU WILL REMEMBER THE RECENT TELEVISION SERIES EASED UPON<br />
IT; I'M NOT SURE IF THE BOOK WAS BASED ON THE FILM OR THE<br />
FILM ON THE BOOK FILMS AND BOOKS ARE PLEASURES ALL TO<br />
RARE FOR ME. NEVERTHELESS, I CAME ACROSS THJS<br />
STATEMENT: " MAN IS UNIQUE, NOT IECAUSE HE DOES SCIENCE,<br />
AND HE IS UNIQUE NOT BECAUSE HE DOES ART, BUT BECAUSE<br />
SCIENCE AND ART ARE EQUALLY THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS<br />
MARVELLOUS PLASTICITY OF MIND." i THAT SEEMED A FITTING<br />
TEXT FOR THIS FESTIVAL. PERHAPS I MIGHT EXTEND IT BY<br />
SAYING THAT MAN IS UNIQUE IN PERCEIVING THE CONNECTION<br />
BETWEEN ART AND SCIENCE, IN RECOGNISING THEIR INDEPENDENCE,<br />
THEIR EQUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE GOOD LIFE.<br />
THAT IS WHAT YOUR FESTIVAL IS HELPING~ TO DO.<br />
THE BEST ART AND THE PURIEST SCIENCE REFLECT THE SAME<br />
ATTITUDES OF MIND CREATIVITY, IMAGINATION, A DISINTERESTEDLOVE<br />
OF BEAUTY AND TRUTH, BERTRAND PUSSELL OBSERVED<br />
THAT PURE MATHEMATICS, PROPERLY VIEWED, POSSESSED THE<br />
SAME AUSTERE BEAUTY OF THE BEST MUSIC, WITHOUT ITS<br />
GORGEOUS TRAPPINGS. UNDOUBTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN RARE<br />
INDIVIDUALS V! ITH BOTH SCIENTIFIC AND ARTISTIC GIFTS.<br />
ONE THINKS OF LEONARDO, OF DARWIN, OF EINSTEIN AND AGAIN<br />
OF RUSSELL. C. P. SNOW WAS THE FIRST POPULAR WRITER IN OUR<br />
OWN" GENERATION TO SEEK A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE HUMANE AND<br />
SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. </p>
<p>CERTAINLY IT IS TIME WE ABANDONED THE IDEA THAT SCIENCE<br />
AND THE ARTS ARE HOSTILE,. OR EVEN NECESSARILY DISTINCT, A<br />
GREAT DEAL OF MODERN ART HAS A TECHNOLOGICAL EASE. THE<br />
CINEMA IS A PRODUCT OF CHEMISTRY AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING;<br />
TELEVISION SPRINGS FROM ADVANCED ELECTRONICS; THE THEATRICAL<br />
ARTS DEPEND MIORE AND MORE ON THEIR SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY<br />
OF STAGECRAFT AND PRODUCTION; LITERATURE RELIES ON MO11DERN<br />
TECHNIQUES OF PRINTING.<br />
W-HAT I HOPE THIS FESTIVAL WILL DO IS CONVINCE US THA<br />
A SOCIETY WITHOUT A RESPECT FOR ART IS AS BARREN AND<br />
DANGEROUS AS A SOCIETY WITHOUT A RESPECT FOR SCIENCE. THE<br />
PRE-SCIENTIFIC AGE IN EUROPE WAS NO LESS BARBAROUS FOR ITS<br />
ARTISTIC GLORIES. a NTO UNTIL THE DAWNING OF THE AFE OF SCIENCE,<br />
WITH THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND SCIENTIFIC<br />
DISCIPLINE, WAS MAN READY TO TEMPER HIS DESTRUCTIVE URGES,<br />
HIS MEDIEVAL FANATICISM, WITH REASON AND TOLERANCE. AND<br />
THE CONVERSE IS EQUALLY TRUE, HAV'E SEEN EXAMPLES<br />
OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETIES ',! ITH CRIPPLIW3RESTRAINTS<br />
ON THE ARTIST IS FREEDOM. I HAVE BEEN CRITICISED IN' RECENT<br />
MONTHS FOR MY FONDNESS FOR ANCIENT G-REECE, THE Uf-. IQUE GLORY<br />
OF GREEK CIVILIZATION W. AS ITS EQUP! L RESPECT FOR SCIENCE AND<br />
THE ARTS; THE TWO WERE HELD IN A PERPETUAL BALANCE, THE GREEK<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS WAS AS ENDURING AS<br />
TIS CONTRIBUTION TO POETRY AND DRAMA, AND THAT WAS 140 MERE<br />
CO-INCIDENCE: THERE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A QUALITY IN THE<br />
INTELLECTUAL SPIRIT AND TEMPER OF ' THENS THAT INSPIRED BOTH ART<br />
AND SCIENCE WITH A COMMON PURPOSE,<br />
04JE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TIME IS THE<br />
DEPENDENCE OF ART AND SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOUR ON GOVERNMENT<br />
SUPPORT ON PUBLIC FUNDS. </p>
<p>-LI~<br />
I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT; IT IS PROBABLY INEVITABLE, EVEN<br />
DESIRABLE, PROVIDED ARTISTS AND SCIENTISTS MAINTAIN THEIR<br />
INDEPENDENCE OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY, OUR CURRENT BUDGET<br />
FOR THE ARTS is $ 20 MILLION A YEAR, OUR OUTLAYS FOR SCIENCE<br />
COVER AN ENORMOUS RANGE OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES.<br />
EXPENDITURE ON THE C. S. I. R. OI AND THE ATOMIC ENERGY<br />
COMMISSION ALONE AMOUNTS TO SOME $ 110 MILLION IN A FULL YEAR.<br />
IN ADDITION, MUCH OF OUR EXPENDITURE-ON TERTIARY EDUCATION IS<br />
DIRECTED TO ISCIENTIFIC AND ARTISTIC OR CULTURAL PROJECTS.<br />
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN GOVERNMENTS WERE MORE<br />
INVOLVED IN SCIENCE AND THE ARTS. ( THE GREEKS, INCIDENTALLY,<br />
WERE EXPERTS IN ALL THREE.) THERE HAc, NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN<br />
SCIENCE AND THE ARTS ACTIVITIES SO PERVASIVE, SO POPULAR, SO<br />
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR WAY OF LIFE WERE LESS ABLE TO SUPPORT<br />
THEMSELVES. THE FACT IS THAT IN THEIR PUREST FORM THEY HAVE NOTHING<br />
TO DO WITH PROFIT-MAKING, THOUGH BOTH CAN BE APPLIED FOR<br />
COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. AND I MUSTSAY I PREFER THAT OUJR<br />
INVESTMENT IN THESE FIELDS SHOULD BE A COMMUNITY INVESTMENT,<br />
THAT THESE BASIC AREAS OF RESEARCH AND CREATIVITY SHOULD BE<br />
PROTECTED FROM ANY SUSPICION OF PRIVATE GAIN OR OFFICIAL<br />
PATRONAGE. ONLY GOVERNMENTS CAN PROVIDE THE FUNDS FOR AN OPERA<br />
HOUSE: ONLY GOVERNMENTS CAN PROVIDE THE FUNDS FOR A NUCLEAR<br />
REACTOR, A THEATRE, A TELESCOPE OR AN ORCHESTRA. MODERN<br />
ENLIGHTENED GOVERNMENTS ACCEPT THESE THINGS AS BEING JUST AS<br />
MUCH PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AS EDUCATION OR HEALTH. m </p>
<p>IN OUR POLICIES FOR THE ARTS IN PARTICULAR<br />
WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE DISBURSED<br />
THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENCIES. WE HAVE LEGISLATION<br />
CURRENTLY BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT TO ESTABLISH THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS AS AN INDEPENDENT<br />
STATUTORY AUTHORITY. IT IS ALREADY ADMINISTERING ITS<br />
POLICIES THROUGH AUTONOMOUS BOARDS WITH COMPLETE<br />
INDEPENDENCE OF* GOVERNMENT OR MINISTERIAL INFLUENCE.<br />
ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO<br />
ESTABLISH IN CANBERRA THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY.<br />
IT WILL DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A NATIONAL COLLECTION OF<br />
WORKS OF ART AND PROVIDE AN ART FOCUS FOR THE WHOLE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY. THE GALLERY WILL BE A STATUTORY<br />
AUTHORITY. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY AND THE. A. B. C. OPERATE<br />
WITH SIMILAR INDEPENDENCE. THESE ARE SOUND PRINCIPLES<br />
AND No GOVERNMENT WOULD WANT TO CHANGE THEM.<br />
THE ARTS BY THEIR NATURE ARE A PUBLIC t ACTIVITY,.<br />
THEY ARE MEANT TO BE SEEN AND HEARD. SCIENCE IS<br />
MORE RETIRING, MORE CLOISTERED MORE ESOTERIC. ONE.<br />
OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOUR FESTIVAL IS THAT<br />
THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIANS WILL COME TO '-EE MORE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT AND<br />
INQUIRY. WE HAVE A GREAT RECORD, BUT FAR TOO LITTLE<br />
IS KNOWN. CAN RECALL THREE OCCASIONS AS PRIME MINISTER<br />
WHEN I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR OF OPENING, OR BEING PRESENT<br />
AT THE OPENING, OF NEW SCIENTIFIC FACILITIES AND ALL<br />
OF THEM'WERE SYMBOLIC OF AUSTRALIA'S RENOWNED AND<br />
IMPORTANT WORK IN THEIR FIELDS. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THERE WAS A NUCLEAR FACILITY AT THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL<br />
UNIVERSITY; OUR WORK IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS IS OF GREAT<br />
IMPORTANCE. THERE WAS THE NEW OPTICAL TELESCOPE AT<br />
SIDING SPRINGS, AND THE DEEP SPACE TRACKING STATION AT<br />
TIDBINBILLA. WE ARE AMONG THE LEADING NATIONS IN ASTRONOMY,<br />
PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF RADIO ASTRONOMY, AND WE ARE AN<br />
IMPORTANT LINK IN WORLD-WIDE SPACE TRACKING NETWORKS$<br />
THESE, PERHAPS, ARE THE MORE SPECTACULAR AND POPULAR ASPECTS<br />
OF SCIENCE' I DO NOT FORGET THE QUIET, DEDICATED, VALUABLECONTRIBUTIONS<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS To ANTARCTIC RESEARCH,<br />
TO GEOLOGY, TO BIOLOGY, TO MEDICINE, TO PHYSICS. THIS<br />
FESTIVAL WILL BRING MANY ASPECTS OF OUR SCIENTIFIC EFFORT TO<br />
A WIDE AND INTERESTED AUDIENCE.<br />
IT WOULD BE A PITY IS I MADE THIS OCCASION SEEM TOO0<br />
ACADEMIC OR SOLEMN. IT IS, AFTER ALL, A EESI. ALESSENTIALLY<br />
A TIME FOR ENJOYMENT, THERE ARE MANY<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHEER FUN AND RECREATION, I AM GLAD IT IS<br />
TO BE A BIENNIAL EVENT, AND I AM PARTICULARLY GLAD THAT THE<br />
FIRST IS BEING HELD IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL, SYMBOLISING THE<br />
CREATIVITY AND ACHIEVEMENT OF THE WHOLE NATION. I AM NOT AN<br />
ARTIST OR A SCIENTIST, BUT AT LEAST I CAN ENJOY AUSTRALIA<br />
AS A CENTRALIST. I CONGRATULATE THE FESTIVAL BOARD FOR THEIR<br />
DEDICATED PLANNING AND PREPARATION,-AUSTRALIA 75 WILL<br />
ENHANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE AND OUR ENJOYMENT OF THE ARTS$<br />
JUST AS IMPORTANT, IT WILL BRING THESE ETERMAL DISCIPLINES<br />
TOGETHER, REVEALING THEIR COMMON PURPOSE IN THE GREAT WEB OF<br />
BEAUTY, KNOWLEDGE AND CONTEMPLATION,<br />
IHAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE IN DECLARING OPEN AUSTRALIA<br />
THE FESTIVAL OF CREATIVE ARTS AND SCIENCES, IN CANBERRA. </p>
