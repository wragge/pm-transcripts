CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF RAAF BASE TINDAL<br />
KATHERINE 31 MARCH 1989<br />
Administrator, Chief Minister,<br />
High Commissioners,<br />
New Zealand Minister of Defence, Bob Tizard,<br />
Parliamentary -colleagues,<br />
Chief of the Air Staff,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Forty-seven years ago, Australians were facing the gravest<br />
dangers and the greatest challenges of our history.<br />
Nineteen forty-two was in many ways our most perilous year.<br />
our very survival was threatened by military attack and<br />
invasion.<br />
After Pearl Harbour, with the stunning advances of the<br />
Japanese armed forces through South-East Asia and the<br />
Pacific, and with the bulk of Australia's own armies engaged<br />
in the struggle in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East,<br />
Australia's vulnerability indeed, our virtual<br />
defencelessness was exposed as never before.<br />
on February 15, 1942, the fortress of Singapore that<br />
Australian defence planners had relied upon as our principal<br />
guarantor of safety, fell to the Japanese.<br />
Four days later, for the first time in our history,<br />
Australian soil was struck by an enemy as Japanese air<br />
forces attacked Darwin.<br />
Amidst the confusion and horror of that attack, the<br />
defenders of Darwin displayed many individual acts of<br />
heroism.<br />
But perhaps none better illustrates the determination and<br />
the grit of the Australian armed forces than the actions of<br />
Wing Commander Archie Tindal.<br />
On the morning of 19 February, as the Darwin RAAF Base was<br />
under attack, Wing Commander Tindal manned a machine gun<br />
mounted on top of a trench, and kept up a steady rate of<br />
fire as the air strike continued. </p>
<p>2.<br />
When he was killed by a cannon shell he became the first<br />
member of the RAAF to be killed in combat on the Australian<br />
mainland. It is in his memory, and in recognition of his courage, that<br />
the Base is named. I have just presented a painting<br />
depicting Tindal's gallantry which will hang in the entrance<br />
of the Headquarters Building.<br />
I note also with pleasure that his sister, Mrs Elizabeth<br />
Mitchell, is with us today to mark this ceremony.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
There are many lessons to be learned from the events of<br />
1942. It was a dark year but the fact is that in the long months<br />
and years following that first attack on Darwin we did<br />
eventually repulse the enemy from our shores and from our<br />
region.<br />
We did it with the incomparable leadership and<br />
self-sacrifice of Prime Minister John Curtin.<br />
We did it with the valour of our fighting men who after a<br />
brilliant record of service against the European Axis<br />
nations, were brought home to defend Australia in the<br />
Pacific theatre.<br />
We did it with the generous and courageous assistance of our<br />
allies, especially the Americans who stood shoulder to<br />
shoulder with us in the worst of the fighting.<br />
The grim lessons of the Second World War brought home to<br />
Australians the vulnerability of our nation to attack and<br />
external threat.<br />
We learnt also that Australia cannot abrogate its<br />
responsibility to provide for its own security: ultimately<br />
we Australians are responsible for our own destiny.<br />
With today's ceremony, we are proving that those realities<br />
of our strategic situation, so dramatically highlighted in<br />
1942, have been well and truly understood and are, at last,<br />
being acted upon.<br />
For the first time, as a result of the Government's 1987<br />
Defence White Paper, Australia's defence policy now places<br />
full and proper emphasis on the development and maintenance<br />
of a self-reliant defence capability.<br />
In addition, our alliance arrangements and our firm<br />
friendships with countries in the region provide the<br />
framework within which we can not only deter aggression<br />
against Australia but also promote the security of our<br />
region and, ultimately, of the globe. </p>
<p>Fundamental to all this is the maintenance of a modern and<br />
effective defence force.<br />
In planning for defence self-reliance, the Government's<br />
defence policy has focused on the need to develop and<br />
maintain a credible force able to mount operations in<br />
Australia's area of direct military interest.<br />
In particular, the White Paper clearly emphasised the<br />
crucial need to protect our northern approaches.<br />
That is what RAAF Base Tindal is all about.<br />
So with this ceremony we are marking the inauguration of one<br />
of the most important defence bases Australia has developed<br />
in many decades.<br />
RAAF Base Tindal is the permanent base for a squadron of<br />
F/ A-18 aircraft a major component of Australia's Tactical<br />
Fighter Force and the most powerful operational unit in our<br />
far North.<br />
Tindal provides tangible proof of the technological strength<br />
and the strategic orientation on which Australia's defence<br />
planning will be based into the 21st century.<br />
more particularly, it is concrete evidence of the key role<br />
which the RAAF will continue to play in preserving our<br />
national security in the North.<br />
It is, accordingly, appropriate that this major RAAF<br />
facility be officially commissioned into service today, the<br />
anniversary of the establishment of the Australian Air Force<br />
as it was then called on 31 March 1921.<br />
For the Air Force, Tindal is the central and most important<br />
component of an arc of air bases being developed across<br />
northern Australia. To the west lies the bare-base RAAF<br />
Base Curtin at Derby which I opened last year. Further west<br />
is the airfield at Learmonth. To the east, in addition to<br />
our defence facilities at Townsville, plans are well<br />
advanced for the construction of a bare-base airfield on<br />
Cape York Peninsula.<br />
In addition to these bases, work is proceeding as a matter<br />
of high priority on the development of an Over-the-Horizon<br />
Radar network to cover our northern approaches.<br />
This surveillance capacity, combined with the substantial<br />
airpower which the RAAF will be able to provide from Tindal<br />
and through the other bare-bases in the North, will comprise<br />
a key element of Australia's ability to protect our<br />
security: the ability to monitor, identify and, if<br />
necessary, intercept air and sea traffic across thousands of<br />
kilometres of coastline. </p>
<p>In short, the development of RAAF Base Tindal as the<br />
northern home-base for a fighter squadron is a major<br />
expression of the Government's defence policy and our<br />
commitment to placing greater emphasis on our defence<br />
capabilities in Northern Australia.<br />
Earlier last year, as I am sure most of you are aware, our<br />
remaining Mirage fighters based at Butterworth in Malaysia<br />
were returned to Australia. Their participation in Five<br />
Power air defence exercises will be replaced by annual<br />
deployments of F/ A-18 Hornets from Australia to Malaysia and<br />
Singapore for periods of not less than 16 weeks.<br />
The first such deployment occurred last in September for the<br />
largest air defence exercise in the history of the Five<br />
Power Defence Arrangements. During such exercises the<br />
aircraft are operationally assigned to the Five Power<br />
Integrated Air Defence System.<br />
All aircraft of the RAAF tactical fighter force are of<br />
course available to contribute to the activities of the<br />
Integrated Air Defence System. Our policy is to give all<br />
elements of our fighter force experience with our Five Power<br />
partners. Indeed, 3 Squadron based at Williamtown, is<br />
currently deployed to Singapore on such training.<br />
But 75 Squadron based here at Tindal is particularly<br />
important in providing Australia's capability to meet our<br />
commitments to the Integrated Air Defence System, because<br />
from here they are only a few hours flying time from South<br />
East Asia.<br />
In assigning 75 squadron to the Integrated Air Defence<br />
System we are demonstrating the strength and durability of<br />
Australia's commitment to the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangements, and to the security of our neighbourhood.<br />
The value of Tindal in underpinning our Five Power<br />
commitments shows how the Government's policy of expanding<br />
our defence capabilities in Australia's north and west helps<br />
us to play a larger role in South East Asia.<br />
Bases like Tindal, and the expanding Naval presence in the<br />
West, allow the Australian Defence Forces to deploy more<br />
forces more quickly to South East Asia, in support of our<br />
friends and allies there, than we have ever been able to do<br />
before. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The significance of this new base should not be estimated<br />
solely in strategic terms. The contribution it will make to<br />
the economic development of Northern Australia is a second,<br />
and very important, element of Tindal's role. </p>
<p>Since October 1984, when I officiated at a ceremony to<br />
commemorate the commencement of works on this site, the<br />
Commonwealth has spent $ 230 million in the Katherine area to<br />
complete stage 1 of the project. This figure does not<br />
include the value of the Hornet aircraft, their spares and<br />
other associated equipment, which will be based at Tindal.<br />
Stage 2 of the Tindal Base, to replace interim facilities<br />
and to extend some stage 1 works, has been approved by the<br />
Parliamentary Works Committee and will be funded by the<br />
Government. Planning for stage 3 is well advanced.<br />
Tindal will also provide a significant injection of funds<br />
into the local economy. If account is taken of the flow on<br />
effect of the RAAF presence, approximately $ 11 million will<br />
be spent each year in the Katherine area and some<br />
$ 14 million in the Northern Territory as a whole.<br />
The stationing of large numbers of Defence personnel and<br />
their dependants in the Katherine area must, of course, have<br />
a significant impact on the local community.<br />
The Country Task Force of Government MPs visited Katherine<br />
in 1987 and identified the need for additional civilian<br />
infrastructure to support the dramatically increased<br />
population here. The Federal Government will do what we can<br />
to support Local and Territory Government initiatives to<br />
address these needs arising from the establishment of the<br />
Tindal Base.<br />
The close cooperation achieved between the Federal<br />
Government, the Northern Territory and Local Governments and<br />
the local communities has been a key ingredient in the<br />
successful establishment of RAAF Base Tindal.<br />
I also offer my congratulations to the many unions involved,<br />
the contractors, the RAAF, and the coordinating authority<br />
which drew all these efforts together Australian<br />
Construction Services.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have spoken today about the crucial strategic and economic<br />
role which RAAF Base Tindal will play over the coming years.<br />
Tindal's success in fulfilling those roles will depend<br />
ultimately on the dedication and commitment of the<br />
individual men and women who make up the RAAF.<br />
It's important to remember that fact and to understand the<br />
many difficulties which service life places on those<br />
individuals and their families.<br />
The Government remains firm in its commitment to give full<br />
priority to addressing the special needs and concerns of our<br />
service men and women. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring Royal Australian Air<br />
Force Base Tindal open.<br />
In doing so I extend my best wishes to all those who will<br />
operate this base and I express my complete confidence in<br />
your abilities to fulfill the heavy responsibilities that<br />
await you. I </p>
