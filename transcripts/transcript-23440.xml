    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has approved the acquisition of an additional 58 F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>The fifth generation F-35 is the most advanced fighter in production anywhere in the world and will make a vital contribution to our national security.</p>
<p>Together with the Super Hornet and Growler electronic warfare aircraft, the F-35 aircraft will ensure Australia maintains a regional air combat edge. The F-35 will also provide a major boost to the ADFâs intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.</p>
<p>The first F-35 aircraft will arrive in Australia in 2018 and enter service with the Royal Australian Air Force in 2020.</p>
<p>Australia has been working with the United States as a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter programme since the Coalition joined in 2002. Acquiring F-35 aircraft will reinforce the ADFâs ability to operate seamlessly with US forces and Australiaâs capacity to continue supporting our shared strategic interests under the US alliance.</p>
<p>The acquisition of F-35 aircraft will bring significant economic benefits to Australia, including in regional areas and for the local defence industry with more jobs and production for many locally-based skilled and technical manufacturers.</p>
<p>The total capital cost of $12.4 billion for this acquisition includes the cost of associated facilities, weapons and training.</p>
<p>Around $1.6 billion in new facilities and infrastructure will be constructed, including at RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales and RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>As a result of the Howard Governmentâs decision to join during the development phase, Australian defence industry has been awarded over $355 million in work and stands to win well in excess of $1.5 billion in JSF-related production and support work over the life of the programme â creating long-term advanced manufacturing and engineering jobs.</p>
<p>The F-35 will replace the F/A-18A/B Classic Hornet aircraft. For over three decades, the Classic Hornet has been the backbone of Australiaâs air combat capability. These aircraft have delivered exceptional service to Australiaâs security but will be withdrawn from service by 2022.</p>
<p>The new 58 F-35 aircraft, in addition to the 14 already approved in 2009, will provide the RAAF with a total of 72 aircraft to form three operational squadrons and one training squadron.</p>
<p>The Government will also consider the option of acquiring an additional squadron of F-35 aircraft to replace the Super Hornets in the future.</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to building a strong, capable and sustainable Australian Defence Force.</p>
