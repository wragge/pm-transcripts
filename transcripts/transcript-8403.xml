PRIME MINISTER J12/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
HONORARY AWARD TO GREEK PRIME MINISTER<br />
I wish to record my delight at the appointment of the Prime<br />
Minister of Greece, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, as an<br />
Honorary Companion in the Order of Australia ( AC) for<br />
eminent service to Australian-Greek relations.<br />
Mr Mitsotakis has had a long and honourable career in Greek<br />
politics, first becoming a member of the Greek Parliament i~ n<br />
1946. He was appointed Prime Minister in April 1990.<br />
Mr Mitsotakis has demonstrated over a long period of time<br />
strong personal commitment to furthering the bonds which<br />
exist between our two countries. Such bonds are further<br />
strengthened by the family, cultural and economic links<br />
which have been developed by both the people of Greece and<br />
the many thousands of Australians of Greek background.<br />
In taking such a personal interest in the recent<br />
commemoration of the Battle of Crete and Greece,<br />
Mr Mitsotakis has contributed to a strengthening of the<br />
special relationship between Australia and Greece which was<br />
forged in th~ e comradeship of the Second World War.<br />
This award serves to underline the importance and strength<br />
of these ties, which I and Mr Mitsotakis are committed to<br />
maintaining and developing further in the years ahead. I<br />
warmly congratulate Mr Mitsotakis, and look forward to<br />
working with him in the future.<br />
6 February 1992 </p>
