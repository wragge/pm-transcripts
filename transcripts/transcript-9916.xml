PRIME MINISTER 3/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MESSAGE OF CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
GREECE I have sent a message of congratulations in the following terms to<br />
Mr Constantine Sinutis, Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic, on his<br />
election to office.<br />
' May I extend to you personally, and on behalf of the Government and people<br />
ofAustralia, my warmest congratulations on your election as Prime Minister Of<br />
Greece. Greece itself and the 300,000 Australians who were born in Greece or are of<br />
Greek descent, have played a vital role in shaping the modern Australian<br />
nation. They are part of the essence of our society.<br />
These deep links between our people provide the firm foundation on which the<br />
relationship between our two governments rest. I believe there is more we can<br />
do to use these links to develop our relations and I look forward to working<br />
closely with you in this task<br />
In this regard, I hope very much that you will find it possible to visit Australia<br />
as a guest of the Australian Government at some early time. You would be a<br />
very welcome guest here.-<br />
You have my very best wishes, and those of all Australians, as you continue the<br />
process of change and reform on which you have embarked"<br />
CANBERRA January 1996 </p>
