PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 13 1982<br />
FAIRBAIRN AIRPORT DOORSTOP<br />
Question: Why has Andrew Grimwade resigned?<br />
Prime Minister: I<br />
I think you would need to direct that to him. I can<br />
only say what I have already said this morning which<br />
was that.-for some time it has been indicated to me<br />
there was pressure of work on him, that months ago<br />
he had indicated maybe.* a difficulty in continuing<br />
with all his public offices. He was originally<br />
appointed by a former government as you know in<br />
1973 and 1974 and I think he served that government well.<br />
Ic He has certainly served my government well over the<br />
years. I am sorry to see him step aside.<br />
Question: It seems to have been a very sudden decision. The<br />
bodies to which he belonged didn't really know.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't know that it is necessarily a sudden decision.<br />
Just because you don'. t know about it before it happens<br />
doesn't necessarily make it a sudden decision. 4 </p>
