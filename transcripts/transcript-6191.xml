lAJT 12) A LiA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA2 SEPTEMBER 1983<br />
I have today sent the following message to President Chun<br />
Doo Hwan of the Republic of Korea:<br />
BEGINS I wish to convey to you on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and people our shock and concern at the<br />
loss of Korean Airlines Flight 7.<br />
There are no circumstances in which the shooting<br />
down of an unarmed aircraft serving no military<br />
purpose can be justified.<br />
We are seeking an urgent explanation from the<br />
Soviet Foreign Ministry and the Soviet Ambassador<br />
to Australia.<br />
May I assure you of Australia's contined strong<br />
support for the right of the Republic<br />
of Korea to its place in tije international<br />
community and its rights in international law.<br />
ENDS. </p>
