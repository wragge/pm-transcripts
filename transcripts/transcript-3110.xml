RICE AID TO INDONESIA<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G.<br />
Whitlam, today announced that the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia,<br />
Mr R. W. Furlonger, had yesterday informed President Suharto that Australia<br />
would supply Indonesia with $ 2.5 million of rice to help alleviate the severe<br />
Sshortage in Indonesia caused by drought.<br />
Mr Whitlam said about 20,000 tons of rice would be purchased<br />
on the international market and supplied to Indonesia as soon as possible√∏<br />
He added Australia was assisting Indonesia in this way because the current<br />
adverse conditions in Australia meant that Australian producers would not<br />
be in a position to supply rice in the quantity needed until after the<br />
April 1973 harvest.<br />
Mr Whitlam said this gift was in addition to the 74,000 tons of<br />
Swheat and 5,000 tons of rice which Australia had already agreed to give to<br />
Indonesia. Mr Whitlam also revealed that he had sent a personal message to<br />
President Suharto through Mr Furlonger. </p>
