CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL-DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LUNCH FOR THE PRESIDENT OF. THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC<br />
CANBERRA 23 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
Mr President,<br />
It is with great pleasure, that I welcome you to Australia in<br />
this, our Bicentennial year.<br />
I welcome you especially in the name * of many hundreds of<br />
thousands of Australians who are of Greek origin, and who<br />
have made an invaluable contribution to the development of<br />
this country in our first two hundred years.<br />
Australia is a distinctively'multicultural nation, one that<br />
takes great pride in the fact that so many people from<br />
vastly different countries and cultures have chosen to make<br />
their homes here. We have been enriched immeasurably by the<br />
contributions of our diverse popul~ ation and this year in<br />
particular we pay tribute to our diversity and to the<br />
strength which we, as a society, have derived from it.<br />
Mr President,<br />
I welcome you to an Australia in which all Australians are<br />
encouraged, within the limits, of our laws and institutions,<br />
to take pride in the ethnic origins and history with which<br />
they identify.<br />
The right to maintain and develop one's culture, language<br />
and religion and, just as importantly, the responsibility<br />
to accept the rights of others to do the same lies at the<br />
very heart of multicultural philosophy.<br />
Multiculturalism offers each of us the opportunity to-have<br />
our traditions accepted, and our viewpoints heard: it asks<br />
each of us to accept that others, have equal rights.<br />
Greek Australians have made an outstanding contribution to<br />
the development of our varied and vibrant multicultural<br />
society. They have combined pride in their Greek past with<br />
an overriding commitment to the future of Australia. 37.1. 7 </p>
<p>The Greek Australian community has made its impact in a<br />
number of fields: the arts; the media; the law; sport; all<br />
levels of primary production and business, including fishing<br />
and ship building; and politics in particular, I am<br />
pleased to say, through the Australian Labor Party.<br />
But it is not only individuals of Greek descent who have<br />
made a contribution to this country. Greek community<br />
organisations such as the Greek Orthodox Church and local<br />
Greek associations and welfare bodies are respected and<br />
influential organisations that have done much to improve the<br />
quality of life in this country.<br />
One very publ'ic manifestation of Greekm-Australian culture is<br />
the various festivals held in the capital cities of<br />
Australia. In Melbourne, the annual Antipodes Festival, which I try to<br />
attend whenever I can, brings together the Greek Australian<br />
community in a celebration that draws tens of thousands of<br />
participants. There would be few greater sights in<br />
Melbourne than Lonsdale Street on the opening night of the<br />
Festival.<br />
Mr President,<br />
I have had the pleasure of working closely with Greek<br />
Australians throughout my public career. My own electorate<br />
of wills has a large Greek community with whom I maintain<br />
close contact. It is because of this familiarity that I can<br />
say with conviction that the Greek community holds a special<br />
place in Australia and in the hearts of all Australians.<br />
Outstanding features of the Greek Australian community are<br />
its commitment to hard work, to the principles of freedom<br />
and democracy, to strong family ties, to educating the<br />
younger generation and to caring for the elderly.<br />
Greek-Australians have played a central role in creating the<br />
competitive, fair and forward looking society which is<br />
Australia today.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Aus -tralians came to admire these values during world War II,<br />
when our two peoples fought, side by side on Greek soil. The<br />
heroism shown by your peoplein assisting Australian troops<br />
who, in their turn were helping the Greek nation, will never<br />
be forgotten. The Australian-Hellenic War Memo rial unveiled<br />
earlier this year by Mr Haralambopoulos will serve as a<br />
continuing reminder of that heroism.<br />
Australians also came to admire the struggle of the Greek<br />
people to assert democratic values during the dark years<br />
between 1967 and 1974. We know too, Mr President, the<br />
personal price that you paid during that struggle in defence<br />
of those great values.<br />
3718 </p>
<p>The people to people link between our two countries<br />
continues to be close.<br />
g Along with thousands of Australians who have made the<br />
pilgrimage to Greece to see the roots of Western<br />
civilisation and to experience the warmth of Greek<br />
hospitality, Hazel and I remember with great pleasure our<br />
visit to Greece in 1986.<br />
Mr President,<br />
e The common commitment of Greece and Australia to a peaceful,<br />
less threatening future has seen our two Governments working<br />
closely together on important international issues such as<br />
is nuclear weapons disarmament.<br />
Although our two peoples share much in common, our primary<br />
interests are in developments in our own regions. But on<br />
0 these matters too, we can offer each other much support. 4<br />
n we know that the Greek nation continues to be troubled by<br />
the fourteen year old division of Cyprus, and by the<br />
problems that flow from this. Australia has consistently<br />
supported moves to achieve the restoration of an<br />
independent, united, sovereign, non-aligned Cyprus. We hope<br />
that the talks between Mr Vassiliou and Mr Oenktash, on<br />
which they are about to report to the United Nation's<br />
Secretary General, will be fruitful.<br />
e Australia also recognises that the future of Greece lies in<br />
an its membership of the European Community, of which it is<br />
al currently President. As you know, we enjoy close links with<br />
the European Community. Already the European Community,<br />
taken as a whole, ranks as Australia's secohd largest export<br />
I market and as our largest source of imports.<br />
The development by 1992 of a single European market with<br />
320 million inhabitants -a market larger than any other in<br />
he Ithe industrialised world -will'have a strong impact on<br />
global economic and trading relationships.<br />
Australia is concerned that any such impact be a positive<br />
one. It would not be helpful if 1992 was to give-birth to<br />
an inward looking economic bloc. We also look to further<br />
I, progress being made in winding back inefficient agricultural<br />
he .~ subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy.<br />
s er If Europe is to continue to be a potent, dynamic economic<br />
ed force into the future, it must maintain an open economy<br />
after 1992. Strength comes from competition, it does not<br />
arise from introspection and retreat.<br />
Mr President,<br />
Australia is this year celebrating two hundred years of<br />
ce European settlement.<br />
r </p>
<p>Your visit in this important year, and the visits by many<br />
other world leaders, have added much to our celebrations.<br />
Special thanks should go to the Greek Australian<br />
Bicentennial Committee for planning and co-ordinating<br />
Greece's generous role in our Bicentenary.<br />
The Greek Pavilion at World Expo 88 in Brisbane and the<br />
participation of your naval training ship ' Aris' in our<br />
Bicentennial Naval Salute, were particularly welcome.<br />
Of course, the highlight of your country's involvement will<br />
be the exhibition of Macedonian antiquities which you will<br />
open tomorrow.<br />
The exhibition the largest of its kind ever to leave<br />
Greece spans 4,000 years from Neolithic times to the Roman<br />
Conquest in 197 BC.<br />
Included in the exhibition is the priceless gold myrtle<br />
wreath from the Tomb of King Philip II one of the richest<br />
treasures of antiquity. I am sure that this exhibition will<br />
delight and instruct thousands of Australians scholars,<br />
students and the general public.<br />
Mr President,<br />
As part of your visit to Australia, you will be journeying<br />
to Melbourne, which we proudly claim as the largest<br />
Greek-speaking city outside Greece itself.<br />
I can assure you Greek-Australian friendship will survive<br />
the rivalries which will undoubtedly develop between Athens<br />
and Melbourne over the hosting of the 1996 Olympic Games.<br />
whichever city hosts those Games, there will certainly be a<br />
proud Greek community, celebrating the seminal role of the<br />
Greek people in fostering the Games of both the ancient and<br />
modern Olympiads.<br />
Mr President,<br />
On behalf of all Australians, and not least our proud<br />
community of Greek-Australians, may I welcome you to<br />
Australia and wish you a happy and memorable visit.<br />
