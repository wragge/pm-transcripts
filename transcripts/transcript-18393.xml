In early 1942, our nation had been engaged in hostilities for two and a half years, but this was the moment the reality of war hit home.</p>
<p>February 19.</p>
<p>Our date of infamy.</p>
<p>Australia's Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>Today we stand “safe on freedom's vantage ground” and look back on those events with gratitude and respect.</p>
<p>Gratitude and respect that the passing of seven decades has only served to increase.</p>
<p>The Japanese Imperial force that attacked Darwin was much the same force that attacked Hawaii nine weeks earlier.</p>
<p>It was a massive armada of 242 planes and Darwin didn't stand a chance.</p>
<p>It took just five bombs to destroy the USS Peary.</p>
<p>She went down as a brave ship does  -  with all guns blazing, even as the water began to cover her deck.</p>
<p>The historian Peter Grose called it a “doomed yet magnificent reply” to the Japanese assault.</p>
<p>A feat that deserves an honoured place in the military history of the United States and in the story of our two nations.</p>
<p>The USS Peary holds that place, securely and lastingly.</p>
<p>A place her crew earned with their courage and with their lives.</p>
<p>Therefore the placement of this gun is no accident.</p>
<p>It points directly to the spot where the USS Peary rests on the floor of Darwin Harbour.</p>
<p>Not a wreck but a war grave.</p>
<p>As precious in its own way as the lawns and granite tablets beneath which their comrades rest in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Friends, these Americans died alongside many Australians.</p>
<p>They were among the first of thousands who would serve and die together in the 40 months of bitter warfare to come, bonded in a brotherhood of shared sacrifice.</p>
<p>As our personnel fought side by side, so did our nations.</p>
<p>And thus from these disastrous events came some lasting benefit:</p>
<p>The distant pre-war friendship between Australia and the United States became a firm and lasting alliance.</p>
<p>The course of Japanese history was turned towards democracy and peace.</p>
<p>And together our countries helped build, through the United Nations, a world order more just and secure than what had gone before.</p>
<p>These were prizes dearly bought.</p>
<p>So today we gather to ensure that the value of the sacrifice made in this city is never surrendered.</p>
<p>We commit ourselves to always “see and hold the good”</p>
<p>To honourably inhabit the freedom for which these brave Americans offered the gift of their lives.</p>
<p>Speaking in Australia at the height of the war, Eleanor Roosevelt said that “victory comes as a result of the full and free gift of all that we have within us.”</p>
<p>These gallant men gave all that they had  -  in full and free measure, as Americans always do.</p>
<p>They were far from American soil.</p>
<p>But they were not strangers.</p>
<p>Here they rest in Australia's embrace  -  at home with us and in peace  -  forever. </p>
