PRIME MINISTER<br />
4 December 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO AREA CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E O E I.<br />
Thank you very much Amanda. To Mr Holloway, to my other Parliamentary<br />
colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. I am gratefual for the opportunity to just say a few<br />
words to you of a general character about some of the Government's goals in the<br />
employment area, with particular reference to the great importance we attach to<br />
policies that affect regional and rural areas of Australia. I understand that Senator<br />
Vanstone would have already announced a number of policy directions in relation to<br />
the role of the Area Consultative Commnittees and I hope that those announcements<br />
have been greeted in a positive fashion because we do see a very important role for<br />
your comnmittees in implementing the new directions the Government has adopted in<br />
relation to labour market programs.<br />
All of us recognise the continued importance of trying to find better solutions to the<br />
challenge of high unemployment in Australia. It still remains, and I don't mind<br />
repeating it because it's a fact, it still remains the biggest social and economic<br />
challenge that Australia has. The fact that we have a youth unemployment rate of 27%<br />
throughout the nation rising to much higher levels in certain regional areas and certain<br />
outer metropolitan areas of the big cities represents a very big challenge to the<br />
Government and represents a very big challenge to the community. There will always<br />
be debate about the best way of responding to that difficulty and that is the stuff' of the<br />
whole political process. We have chosen to make a number of policy changes from the<br />
direction adopted by the previous Government. We are trying to put a great deal more<br />
emphasis on the role of small business in employing people. We have recently secured<br />
the passage of our Workplace Relations Bill through the Senate. We believe over<br />
time, and I have to stress over time, that that will produce a more flexible labour<br />
market that will increase employment opportunities.<br />
Now people will debate that and I respect that there is a political divide in the<br />
commnunity on that but the Parliament has finally resolved the issue in favour of a piece<br />
of legislation which, although it was not precisely in the original form presented by the </p>
<p>Fax from 64/ 12/ 96 16: 04 Pg: 2<br />
Government, it did incorporate a lot of amendments put for-ward by the Australian<br />
Democrats and some amendments I might stress that were picked up after discussion<br />
between the Minister and representatives of the trade union movement because not all<br />
of what was put to us by the trade union movement on that pielee of legislation was<br />
regarded as unacceptable. Quite a number of the amendments that were put forward<br />
by the trade union movement were accepted but it has now been resolved and its the<br />
responsibility of all of us to try and make the new system work and I believe if it is<br />
allowed to work it will produce better outcomes at the workplace level. It will<br />
importantly produce more flexibility. It will importantly preserve the present margin<br />
under the system for younger employees through the preservation of the junior wage<br />
structure which was marked down for abolition on the first of July next year and if that<br />
abolition had proceeded in the Government's judgement, the jobs of a lot of young<br />
people around Australia would have been put at risk. That is a very, very important<br />
element in the Government's approach and I think over time as it does work, it will be<br />
of very, very great value.<br />
I have recently established an employment committee of Federal Cabinet which I will<br />
chair and which includes all of the senior Ministers, including Senator Vanstone and<br />
Mr Kemp who are involved with employment and labour market issues, and the whole<br />
purpose of that commiittee was to focus the attention of the Government on a day to<br />
day basis, if you like on the problem of employment and the challenges that remained<br />
in the community to reduce unemployment. Once again, I don't believe for a moment<br />
that there are some magical, wand-waved solutions but if you can have a proper policy<br />
focus on it as the most important priority of all, it will make a significant difference.<br />
We believe that there are great employment benefits for regional Australia if the<br />
Natural Heritage Trust which of course is linked to our proposal to sell one third of<br />
Telstra can be realised. There will be A capital investment of a billion dollars over a<br />
period of time, the largest investment ever from a capital side in the environmental<br />
future of Australia and if we can get that up and running and I guess we will know in<br />
the next few days, I don't know as I speak whether the legislation will pass through the<br />
Senate. I mean, it's the delicious vagaries of Australia's political system and I suppose<br />
it is a reminder that all of us are ultimately controlled by the collective will of the<br />
Australian people and we really don't want it otherwise although it does sort of keep<br />
you at the edge of your seat, and if you're a Member of the House of Representatives<br />
you keep a weather eye on what your colleagues are doing in the Senate, but it's all a<br />
delightful part of the political process so we will know I hope in a few days but I<br />
certainly don't know as I speak, but that billion dollar investment will have very<br />
important employment consequences for regional Australia, in particular, more so for<br />
regional Australia than the cities, and I do hope very much that we can get it up and<br />
running. But the most important message that I would like to leave with you ladies and<br />
gentlemen is that community involvement and community consultation and the process<br />
of the Government listening to what the community says is what the Area Consultative<br />
Committees are all about and particularly as Chairmen of the various Area<br />
Consultative Committees around Australia is what your role is all about. I have often<br />
said that political leadership in this country consists on some occasions of standing in<br />
the middle of the road and daring people to run you over. On other occasions I think </p>
<p>Fax from 641/ 6 1: 4P'<br />
political leadership does consist in sitting down and listening to people before you've<br />
made up your mind what you're going to do. The trick of course is to choose the<br />
issues that are appropriate for the first treatment and also the issues that are<br />
appropriate for the second treatment. Sometimes when you adopt the first approach<br />
you're told that you don't listen and sometimes when you adopt the second approach<br />
you are told you don't lead so the trick of course is to get the right mix. Now very<br />
much the contribution that you can make to some of the new policy directions that the<br />
Minister has outlined and others will outline is very much in the second category.<br />
I don't pretend for a moment that the new labour market approach can work<br />
effectively without the co-operation of the community and that involves the cooperation<br />
of educators, of trainers, of union leaders, of people involved in small and<br />
large business. We all have a common commitment, whatever our political beliefs may<br />
be in better outcomes, particularly for young people and in lower levels of<br />
unemployment because if governments and communities can't solve those sort of<br />
problems then faith in the whole system is undermined and we don't pretend that we<br />
can sort of send directions from a federal government that will solve all those problems<br />
without your involvement. I want you to see the new initiatives and the new approach<br />
and I know for some of you it's very different. Some of you, you may not feel initially<br />
comfortable with the new approach but I do want you to see them as a bona fide<br />
attempt on the part of the Government, albeit in a somewhat different fashion to tackle<br />
problems which other governments have tried with varying degrees of success and I<br />
am not here to bag my predecessors. I am here to promote the different approach that<br />
the new Government is adopting and I hope you will accept from me, and I know I<br />
speak for Senator Vanstone and for the other Ministers who are involved accept from<br />
me that we do have a very strong commnitment to involving the community, a very<br />
strong commitment to consultation and to listening. We think the new system will<br />
work better. We do think the more market-oriented approach to job placement, the<br />
new competitive approach will open up fresh opportunities for people that are not now<br />
available and we would like you to give the system your co-operation. We would like<br />
you to give the system your input and your support and in conjunction with some of<br />
the other measures that I have alluded to today, I do hope that it will be seen and<br />
supported as a very positive contribution to tackling what remains Australia's biggest<br />
social and economic challenge.<br />
I again thank you very warmly for coming. I hope you find today's meeting productive<br />
and I hope you find the announcements that the Minister has made, and others will be<br />
made later in the meeting, announcements that you can support and enthusiastically<br />
participate in implementing. 04/ 12/ 96 16: 04 Pg: 3 </p>
