CHINESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TEST<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said today that<br />
the Australian Government had received confirmation that the<br />
Chinese Government had exploded a nuclear weapon device in the<br />
atmosphere over its territory yesterday.<br />
The Australian Government understood that the Chinese<br />
explosion had been somewhat less than a megaton in size, and<br />
that it appeared to have occurred at Lop Nor at about 4 p~ m.<br />
yesterday. Mr Whitlam said that it was a matter of deep concern<br />
to the Australian Government that the Chinese Government had<br />
conducted a further nuclear test which was likely to lead to the<br />
deposit of radio-active fallout not only within its own<br />
territory but over a wide area including, in the longer term,<br />
Australia.<br />
S Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with<br />
China in December 1972, the Australian Government had made known<br />
to Chinese leaders its opposition to Chinese nuclear weapon tests<br />
on a number of occasions. On 10 April 1973, the Government made<br />
a formal protest to the Chinese Government expressing Australia's<br />
strong opposition to the conduct of nuclear weapon tests and<br />
reaffirmed the Australian Government's view that atmospheric<br />
nuclear weapons testing was contrary to international law;<br />
during his visit to China in May 1973 Dr Cairns re-stated the<br />
Australian position to Premier Chou En-lai; he himself had<br />
issued a statement expressing deep concern following the last<br />
Chinese nuclear test on 27 June 1973; and soon afterwards formal<br />
o/ 2 </p>
<p>notes of protest had been delivered both to the Chinese<br />
Foreign Ministry in Peking and the Chinese Embassy in<br />
Australia. Most recently, he had vigorously re-stated the<br />
Australian position during his meeting with Chairman Mao<br />
Tse-tung on 2 November 1973.<br />
Since China did not accept the compulsory<br />
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and was<br />
not a party to the 1928 General Act for the Pacific Settlement<br />
of International Disputes, it was not feasible for Australia<br />
to initiate proceedings against China in the Court. Nevertheless9<br />
the Australian Government considered that the Chinese Government,<br />
as well as the French Government, had a clear obligation<br />
towards the international community to prevent the dangers of<br />
environmental pollution. The present Australian Government had<br />
consistently opposed nuclear weapon testing by all countries and<br />
would continue to work vigorously for a complete cessation of<br />
such testing. 0 I </p>
