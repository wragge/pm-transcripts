BENDIGO BY-ELECTION<br />
TV Message from the Prime Minister<br />
( Recorded 23 May_ 1969)<br />
On June the 7th you will elect a representative for<br />
Bendigo to the Federal Parliament. I ask you to elect Warren<br />
Cambridge, the Liberal Party candidate, to help me and my<br />
Government. He's Bendigo born and bred, active in community<br />
service and, of course, was Mayor of Bendigo last year. He knows<br />
Bendigo's special problems and can raise those problems where it<br />
counts as a member of the Government ' s team. But he also has a<br />
vision of Australia's future as we do a developing land, a growing<br />
land, a land where the ill and aged are cared for, a land which<br />
helps its neighbours and which builds its defences. For effective<br />
local representation and for the good of Australia's future bring<br />
Bendigo into the Government and send us Councillor Cambridge on<br />
June the 7th.<br />
Note: This message will be broadcast 12 times by BCV-8<br />
during the campaign. It will be used for the first<br />
time at 8. 15 p. m. on Monday, 26 May. </p>
