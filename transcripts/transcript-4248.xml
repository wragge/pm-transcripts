INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO C. S. I. R. O.<br />
The Government has decided to appoint an independent Committee<br />
of Inquiry to review the objectives, structure and programmes<br />
of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.<br />
over the last fifty years, C. S. I. R. O. has earned a high reputation<br />
within Australia and overseas. This has been achieved by<br />
conducting research programmes which have been predominantly of<br />
high quality and sound practicality.<br />
During these years, the executive and staff of C. S. I. R. O. have<br />
made significant contributions to fundamental and applied science<br />
and sought to link the two together.<br />
They have helped us to increase our knowledge of the physical<br />
and biological environment through which we move and on which we<br />
depend. They have'developed new technologies through the application of<br />
scientific principle to everyday problems.<br />
The last major review of C. S. I. R. O. was held almost thirty years<br />
go in 1948-49. Since then, science has become increasingly<br />
diversified and the Government has come to support science and<br />
technology in a multiplicity of ways.<br />
Inevitably, the role of C. S. I. R. O. has changed. It is appropriate<br />
at this time to engage in a rethinking of the objectives of C. S. I. R. O.<br />
for the future' to conduct an independent examination of the ways<br />
in which the Organisation's vigor, its ethos, and its capacity to<br />
deal with -the challenge of the future can be sustained. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry is Professor A. J. Birch,<br />
Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Australian<br />
National University. Professor Bir-. ch was the foundation dean of<br />

the Committee are Sir Cecil Looker, a former President of the<br />

present and future requirements of Australia of its functions<br />

2. the extent to which the current research programme objectives<br />
and the emphasis given them accord with the objectives<br />
recommended for the organisation<br />
3. existing arrangements and procedures for meeting recommended<br />
objectives and discharging recommended functions, with<br />
particular emphasis on:-<br />

for the employment of staff, and the role of<br />
consultative and advisory machinery. </p>
<p>t -3-<br />
( ii) the relationship of the organisation with Government agencies,<br />
industry, tertiary institutions, research institutes, and<br />
with users of research results.<br />
( iii) the methods for selecting, reviewing, reporting on, and<br />
re-ordering research programmes, including the effect of<br />
the differing sources of funds.<br />
( iv) the assessment of results achieved in the light of resources<br />
employed, the processes involved in the implementation of research<br />
results, and<br />
( vi) the role of the organisation in Australia's international<br />
scientific relationships.<br />
4. the extent to which and the means by which programmes of the<br />
organisation could attract revenue both to support the conduct<br />
of ongoing or intended research and also in return for results<br />
achieved in research. </p>
