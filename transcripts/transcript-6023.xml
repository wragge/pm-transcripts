MR HAWKE NEGLECTS HOMEWORK<br />
Mr Hawke often tells us of his great expertise in<br />
industrial relations. one would have thought he would<br />
know his facts. Given the importance he gives to a<br />
" prices and incomes policy", one would have expected<br />
him to do at least a little homework.<br />
Mr Hawke recently said in a national television broadcast that<br />
there was never a prices and incomes policy in Britain.<br />
But the facts demostrate that there was.<br />
Mrs Shirley Williams who ran the policy in Britain during<br />
the seventies has said that " in practice it ( was) quite<br />
a strict policy". She demonstrated clearly that Mr Hawke<br />
was plainly and simply wrong.<br />
Mrs Williams also made it cl~ ear that the British prices<br />
and incomes policy was only maintained by pretty<br />
draconian powers and penalities powers that are not<br />
available to an Australian government.. It caused<br />
companies to cut back on investment and damage their<br />
longterm interests with an inevitable destruction of jobs<br />
and job opportunities.<br />
But Mr Hawke still won't accept the facts. He's still<br />
twisting and turning with word games and excuses. He says<br />
III put it that there wa-s not a situation where there was<br />
in place policies in regard to all the elements of prices,<br />
dividends, rents and interest and I adhere to that<br />
as does every conunentator who has examined the s; ituation<br />
there. There were elements of a prices and incomes policy<br />
but part. of the problem was that the parts did not make<br />
' a whole".<br />
Mr Hawke still can't get it right. Don't take my word for<br />
it, take the word of Mrs Williams who says quite plainly<br />
" in practice it is quite a strict policy. The incomes<br />
policy side was voluntary but it was very much kept. On<br />
the prices side direct control of the retail mark-ups,<br />
the amount that the retail tradp could add on to any sale,<br />
and there was also a prices code for the private company.<br />
And companies had to get approval from thc. overnmenrt before<br />
they could increase their prices beyond a certain amouint." </p>
<p>2.<br />
A noted British commentator and economist, Samuel Brittain,<br />
summned it all up yesterday on Australian radio when he<br />
was asked what advice he would give to any Australian<br />
government contemplating such policies. He tersely said<br />
" forget it".<br />
We can't afford to take a risk with somebody who is as<br />
sloppy with his homework as Mr Hawke evidently is.<br />
Australia needs substance, reality. This is just another<br />
area where Mr Hawke's alleged credentidls, in the words of<br />
the Financial Review, " Won't stand close scrutiny"'. </p>
