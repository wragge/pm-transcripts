    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, I have called this news conference to</p>
<p> announce that the Australian Inland Railway Express System is taking</p>
<p> another significant step towards becoming reality. And if it does</p>
<p> become reality, will deliver thousands of new jobs, investment and</p>
<p> infrastructure to regional Australia. It'll provide high speed</p>
<p> rail links with potential for adding a natural gas pipeline. And if</p>
<p> it proves to be feasible it will extend from Melbourne to Darwin,</p>
<p> while also providing high speed links from Brisbane to Melbourne and</p>
<p> Sydney to Melbourne.</p>
<p>And I am delighted to say that Australian Transport and Energy Corridor</p>
<p> Pty Ltd (ATEC), which is chaired by Mr Everald Compton, who is on</p>
<p> the stage with me, which first proposed this project, has signed an</p>
<p> agreement with Abigroup whose Deputy Chairman, Mr Lloyd Lang, is with</p>
<p> us today, which subject to feasibility, will allow Abigroup to take</p>
<p> the project through to completion.</p>
<p>The next step is to provide, after about a year, a full feasibility</p>
<p> report to the five governments and seek approval to proceed to detailed</p>
<p> planning. It is anticipated that if the project proceeds it will be</p>
<p> finalised by the year 2004 and I congratulate the private sector interests</p>
<p> that have been active in being involved in this project from the time</p>
<p> it was conceived by the people who comprised ATEC. Such a project,</p>
<p> if it comes to fruition, is one of those things that comes once in</p>
<p> a generation. It would open up new industries and jobs throughout</p>
<p> regional Australia and it would contribute to a reduction in the cost</p>
<p> of living in regional Australia and it could signal the rebirth of</p>
<p> many communities throughout regional Australia and create tens of</p>
<p> thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>Importantly, Australians will have an opportunity to invest in this</p>
<p> remarkable venture in about two years time because if it goes ahead</p>
<p> a public company owning the railway will be floated allowing Australian</p>
<p> families to be part of this nation building project. The project will</p>
<p> build on the significance efforts the Coalition has already made via</p>
<p> such things as the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, and the $1.25</p>
<p> billion Natural Heritage Trust and the $500 million rural package</p>
<p> to support and help improve conditions in rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>I would like, in making this announcement, to pay particular tribute</p>
<p> to the energy of Mr Everald Compton who has been the Chairman of this</p>
<p> group and he has also been very energetically assisted by my colleague,</p>
<p> Mal Brough, who, of course, is the Member for Longman and part of</p>
<p> his electorate, I believe, is touched by the route of this railway.</p>
<p> I am also delighted that my old Liberal Party friend, Mr Lloyd Lang,</p>
<p> is here, he is the Deputy Chairman of Abigroup. His greatest contribution</p>
<p> to public and commercial life in Australia was in December of 1973</p>
<p> to be the Chairman of my pre-selection committee when I was chosen</p>
<p> by the Liberal Party to represent the seat of Bennelong at the 1974</p>
<p> elections.</p>
<p>So I am delighted to have these gentlemen present and, of course,</p>
<p> not least to welcome my colleague and friend, the Deputy Prime Minister,</p>
<p> Mr Fischer. I am sure the gentlemen would be very happy to answer</p>
<p> questions, and I will too, about the project and I dare say you might</p>
<p> want to ask me one or two other questions, I'd be very happy</p>
<p> to take those as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The proposal appears to leave open the question of the nature of the</p>
<p> line between Sydney and Canberra but it also appears to rule out the</p>
<p> introduction of VFT technology from Sydney to Melbourne. Given the</p>
<p> concern in Victoria about the acquisition of VFT technology in Victoria,</p>
<p> have you spoken to your Party colleagues in Victoria about this matter,</p>
<p> this apparent exclusion of VFT..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think it necessarily has that effect but perhaps,</p>
<p> Everald, you might have something to say about that.</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>Thank you Prime Minister. All infrastructure in Australia should be</p>
<p> supported including a thing like the VFT. It so happens that the Melbourne</p>
<p> to Darwin line makes no sense unless it's hooked into Sydney</p>
<p> as well and we plan to have a link from Temora across to Goulburn</p>
<p> where it will link with the proposed Sydney-Canberra Very Fast Train,</p>
<p> and therefore take the line into Sydney. Now that's being done,</p>
<p> essentially, for freight purposes so that Sydney is linked in with</p>
<p> the Melbourne to Darwin system. It will also mean that on our line</p>
<p> passenger trains will run. And they will probably take four hours</p>
<p> to get from Sydney to Melbourne whereas a very, very fast train might</p>
<p> take three. Now, all we are saying is that having built our line,</p>
<p> which will only cost $500 million to link Temora to Goulburn, we run</p>
<p> freight trains along it and we run passenger trains along it, but</p>
<p> we cheer anyone else who wants to run a train somewhere else.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any public money in this project Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there will - public money from the citizens. When the company</p>
<p> is floated there will be a lot of public money in it. At this stage,</p>
<p> the Federal Government's role is a facilitating role, an indication</p>
<p> as I've made in my news release, which I'm sure will be</p>
<p> given to you at the end of the news conference, that the Government's</p>
<p> providing a facilitating role, and of course we'll legislate</p>
<p> to ensure approvals. We're not, at this stage, indicating any</p>
<p> direct financial support. This has always been run as something that</p>
<p> is a project that can stand up on private sector principles.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what is the inference for the timing of today's announcement,</p>
<p> because looking at the map, the line appears to run through pretty</p>
<p> much every seat that One Nation...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a very cynical remark. The timing of it quite simply is</p>
<p> purely coincidental. Mr Brough has been working very hard on this,</p>
<p> all jokes aside, he's been working very hard on this and been</p>
<p> keeping Tim and I very regularly informed as time has gone by, and</p>
<p> I've been talking to Mr Compton. I had dinner with him at the</p>
<p> Lodge a few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, and he brought me up to date.</p>
<p> I mean, our position is that we will adopt a healthy and facilitating</p>
<p> role, consistent with our overall economic responsibilities in relation</p>
<p> to any infrastructure project that private sector interests want to</p>
<p> sponsor. We're not taking sides, we're not picking winners.</p>
<p> We're very keen to help on all fronts and it is purely coincidental</p>
<p> that this announcement should be made today.</p>
<p>TIM FISCHER:</p>
<p>Just on a technicality, from Tennant Creek to Darwin - the Prime Minister</p>
<p> spoke of the facilitation - from Tennant Creek to Darwin, both projects</p>
<p> - the Adelaide to Darwin, and this project, will in fact be sharing</p>
<p> the same set of rails on a common corridor basis.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And what's more, I never do a news conference on anything to</p>
<p> do with the railways without Tim being with me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How does this effect the economics of the already publicly subsidised</p>
<p> proposed Darwin to Alice railway.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it will. I don't think it effects it at all.</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>Could I first comment on the other question about where this railway</p>
<p> line's going. We started working on this 18 months ago, and it</p>
<p> follows and has been long planned to go through the great productive</p>
<p> areas of Australia. If you look at that map, you'll find that</p>
<p> all the great productive areas west of the Great Divide take that</p>
<p> line. Now, if it so happens it goes through certain electorates, so</p>
<p> be it, but we designed it to pick up freight, not to pick up votes</p>
<p> and I think that's where it is going. And it will develop inland</p>
<p> Australia. With regard to Adelaide to Darwin, again that's another</p>
<p> great infrastructure project which we should all support because we</p>
<p> haven't had a decent infrastructure project in this country since</p>
<p> the Snowy Mountains fifty years ago, and now we are going to get serious</p>
<p> again and get into that sort of development. We will help to make</p>
<p> the Adelaide to Darwin line viable, because we will pay the rent to</p>
<p> get on their line all the way up to their and we'll be running</p>
<p> be more trains than they will up that line and it will make it viable.</p>
<p> And we are going to a totally different freight area to the one that</p>
<p> they are going through, but thank Heavens there are two people trying</p>
<p> to point our freight towards the world. Every railway line ever built</p>
<p> in Australia, with nowhere, now we've got a couple pointing towards</p>
<p> the world with who we'd want to trade, so for Heaven's sake</p>
<p> don't knock either of them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are the real chances of this project actually going ahead? 50-50,</p>
<p> 75?</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>Well, as far as I'm concerned it will be built and I'll</p>
<p> take you on the train with me and we'll share a bottle of Grange</p>
<p> Hermitage.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've never seen such an enthusiastic press conference! You can</p>
<p> come to all of my news conferences Everald.</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>We will build the railway line.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What is the projected cost of the whole project of $500 million that's</p>
<p> required for the Temora link?</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>It will cost five-and-a-half billion dollars for a single track all</p>
<p> the way. There will obviously be a need for double tracks in certain</p>
<p> high density areas. The technology people tell me that in fact we</p>
<p> could survive on a single track between Melbourne and Darwin because</p>
<p> technology now allows two trains to race towards one another at 500</p>
<p> kilometres an hour and miss one another by half a kilometre, and so</p>
<p> you could do it on one track. So a single track will cost $5.5 billion,</p>
<p> a double track will cost $8.5 billion, which is about the amount of</p>
<p> money that Australians spent in casinos last year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But surely you are competing with Darwin to Alice in terms of investors</p>
<p> - that's the reality.</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>The money will come from both of them, because I just made the point</p>
<p> if Australians can invest $8.5 billion in a year, surely we can build</p>
<p> a couple of railway lines. So we're not dealing with any extraordinary</p>
<p> expenditure. I mean, $8.5 billion is just an eight and a five with</p>
<p> a few naughts after it. I mean...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will there be any foreign investment in this project?</p>
<p>EVERALD COMPTON:</p>
<p>There will be undoubtedly some foreign investment. We believe that</p>
<p> the majority of the investment will be Australian and we set out to</p>
<p> do that. If it happens that it's not that way well that will</p>
<p> be because Australian people and Australian institutions chose not</p>
<p> to invest in it, not because they didn't have the opportunity</p>
<p> to do it. And it the intention of Abigroup who've shown enormous</p>
<p> courage in getting behind, and vision, in getting behind this project</p>
<p> to ensure that we get the maximum possible investment. Abigroup is</p>
<p> totally Australian owned, and my company's totally Australian</p>
<p> owned, we're going to try and keep it that way for the length</p>
<p> of the project.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.. this point in the economy which is about four or five years hence....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>To whom are you addressing this question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister. How concerned are you about the short term to</p>
<p> the Australian economy given the situation in Japan at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is a general question. How concerned? Well, I am obviously concerned</p>
<p> about what is happening in Japan and self-evidently there is a need</p>
<p> for the Japanese Government to proceed very firmly and very resolutely</p>
<p> with addressing the structural problems in that country's banking</p>
<p> system. Now that has been apparent for some time and all the public</p>
<p> and private urgings which go between Australia and Tokyo are to that</p>
<p> effect. I've always been fundamentally optimistic about the Japanese</p>
<p> economy because it has strengths that few economies in the world have,</p>
<p> so my answer to your question is, of course you must have some level</p>
<p> of concern. Don't try and ask me and I'm not going to try</p>
<p> to put some percentage on it. But there is a need for structural reform</p>
<p> and that's been urged on Mr Hashimoto by President Clinton and</p>
<p> it's a view that we have expressed and will continue to express.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When would you expect a project like this in contrast with money printing</p>
<p> ideas that have been floated in the last few weeks, would you expect</p>
<p> a project like this to win back some One Nation supporters?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I'm not going to put it in the context of One Nation. This</p>
<p> project has been conceived quite in isolation from many political</p>
<p> developments. But there has always been within the Australian community,</p>
<p> because of the vastness of our Nation, a hunger for long term national</p>
<p> development projects. It's one of the deepest things in the emotion</p>
<p> of the Australian people. They talk about the Great Snowy River Scheme,</p>
<p> there is still in all of us a passion to open up and develop and full</p>
<p> access the great inland of our country. We have a particular affection</p>
<p> for that, we have almost a romance with the idea. And therefore a</p>
<p> project like this will have a huge emotional response. Obviously it's</p>
<p> got to be soundly based and it's got to be a commercial project,</p>
<p> and my view is that if people want to promote commercial projects</p>
<p> it's not the job of the Government to pick winners, it's</p>
<p> not the job of the Government to say "hey you can't do that</p>
<p> because it might have that affect on another project". That is</p>
<p> for the commercial forces to work out, but from a Government's</p>
<p> point of view, large national development projects, large infrastructure</p>
<p> projects touch the feeling of the Australian people in a very special</p>
<p> way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But won't the government be called upon ultimately to give special</p>
<p> tax breaks on a project of this size in the form of infrastructure</p>
<p> problems....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Paul, I'm not going to react in advance as to what may or may</p>
<p> not be put to the Government except to say that we will react in a</p>
<p> sensible way and we'll care for the national interest in the</p>
<p> way we're reacting to any requests.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So in relation to the national project you wouldn't rule out</p>
<p> giving special tax breaks which the Treasurer in the past has said</p>
<p> go against the thrust of the Government's reforms.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will give the same answer to that question that I gave to the last</p>
<p> one.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could you please advise us on the progress on your talks with Senator</p>
<p> Harradine and give us your odds on whether there's a chance that</p>
<p> the Wik Bill could pass through the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not going to give any odds. Senator Harradine spoke to me</p>
<p> last night and I spoke to him again a few moments ago. What he has</p>
<p> put to me so far still leaves a very big gap between what we would</p>
<p> regard as necessary and what he's put forward. I will be seeing</p>
<p> him again this afternoon, I'm very ready and willing to talk</p>
<p> to him at great length. It is an important issue and I will try all</p>
<p> I can consistent with what we believe to be in Australia's interest</p>
<p> to reach an agreement. But I haven't entered a bartering or a</p>
<p> bargaining session. We have already made huge compromises on this</p>
<p> matter. He's put forward a proposal which really does not represent</p>
<p> any significant alteration from the position he occupied before Easter,</p>
<p> but I have arranged to have further talks with him but it would not</p>
<p> be correct at all to say that what has been put forward represents</p>
<p> a large blink or even a medium sized blink. There is still a gap between</p>
<p> us and I'm willing to talk to him about it but I'm certainly</p>
<p> not going to put it any more strongly than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If there is no agreement Prime Minister...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look let us just go through..., I'm not going to play the</p>
<p> hypothetical.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But would it be in the national interest to have a speedy double dissolution</p>
<p> on this issue?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did the Partyroom have a post-mortem on the Queensland election and</p>
<p> if so what ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we had a very lengthy debate. It was vigorous, even willing,</p>
<p> and that's to be expected because ...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you get the (inaudible) from backbenchers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll start again. It was quite vigorous, even willing. The messages</p>
<p> were multitudinous and there was lot of advice given to the Government</p>
<p> and I welcome that. I thought it was a very good meeting. People were</p>
<p> concerned about the vote obtained by One Nation. That's understandable.</p>
<p> I reminded them that we are now living in a completely different political</p>
<p> environment than has obtained in the past: that politics is a lot</p>
<p> less tribal; you can expect greater volatility; people are no longer</p>
<p> rusted onto the parties of their parents, and therefore they are more</p>
<p> likely to be attracted by simplistic populous solutions. It's</p>
<p> quite clear that some of the attitudes taken by One Nation have touched</p>
<p> some ugly sentiments in the Australian community and we are all united</p>
<p> in our rejection of those and I refer, of course, to the extent to</p>
<p> which on occasions remarks are made which encourage feelings of racial</p>
<p> prejudice or bigotry.</p>
<p>I don't however believe, and nor do my colleagues believe, for</p>
<p> a moment that the great majority of people who voted for One Nation</p>
<p> hold those views at all. But it can often be the case that people</p>
<p> can vote for an organisation for an entirely separate set of reasons</p>
<p> than the objectives of some of the people involved in that organisation.</p>
<p>The best way to destroy One Nation is to reclaim the affections of</p>
<p> those who supported it, that's self-evident, and many of those</p>
<p> people are of course former Coalition voters. I pointed out to my</p>
<p> colleagues it was natural that after the enormous wall-to-wall publicity</p>
<p> One Nation has received over the last few weeks it was natural it</p>
<p> would enjoy a surge in opinion polls. I'd have been quite astonished</p>
<p> as a politician who's been around for 24 years if that hadn't</p>
<p> been the case. I might also remind you that five weeks ago today the</p>
<p> Newspoll showed the Coalition in almost as strong a position as it</p>
<p> was in March of 1996. Now that's some measure of the volatility</p>
<p> of the political climate in which we are living. We can't dismiss</p>
<p> it, but we mustn't in any way be overwhelmed by it. And if you</p>
<p> really want to give One Nation momentum you behave as though their</p>
<p> momentum to date has forced you to radically change course away from</p>
<p> something that you believe is correct. Now you have to have a combination</p>
<p> of responses. You have to make it perfectly clear that you won't</p>
<p> have any truck with extremist views and you won't have any coalitions.</p>
<p> And I have to say that the headline in The Australian this</p>
<p> morning suggesting however indirectly that I was going to be involved</p>
<p> in some coalition or arrangement with One Nation is something I reject</p>
<p> totally. I won't be, never. I'll only every be in Coalition</p>
<p> with one party and that's the National Party. The question of</p>
<p> dealing with Senators after a subsequent Senate election I'd</p>
<p> be like any other Government. The Labor party in Government talked</p>
<p> to a lot of people that didn't like and continued to do so. That</p>
<p> any suggestion that in some way we will give a wink or a nod to One</p>
<p> Nation is quite wrong. We're in the business of winning votes</p>
<p> for the Liberal Party and the National Party and denying support to</p>
<p> our natural enemies, the Australian Labor Party. And that's the</p>
<p> guiding principle of how we're going to behave.</p>
