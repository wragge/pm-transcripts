~ a~ aY RABAUL ( AIRPORT ARRWAL)<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
in r ely to Mi. John Kauti 9 JULY 1970<br />
Tolai, I come before you today at a time which should make us all sad and<br />
sorrowful for in this country, on this Peninsula, Tolai is divided against Tolai and<br />
brother's hand is raised against brother. And so people have been hurting each other<br />
instead o' sitting down together to try and reach agreement with each other by discussion,<br />
to try and find out what it is that most of the people want. Surely it would be better<br />
for all the Tolai if that were done rather than that people should be spoken badly of and<br />
should hurt each other. Would not that be better.... as it was?<br />
For myself, I can say this. And, Tolai, do you not want to hear.... For<br />
myself and for my Government I can say this. There has been disagreement on the<br />
question of a Multi-Racial Council. All we wish to do is to discover what it is that<br />
most of the Tolai want, and if most of the Tolai do not want a Multi-Racial Council,<br />
then there will not be one. But if most of the Tolai do want a Multi-Racial Council,<br />
then in the name of that democracy of which Mr. Kaputin spoke, there ought to be a<br />
Multi-Racial Council. I have said in Canberra, I have offered to Mr. Kaputin when<br />
he came to see me in Canberra..... " Let us discover what the people want. Let us<br />
have a referendum so we can see what their will is, and we will then follow their will<br />
as so expressed." Would it not be better for the Tolai to decide peacefully and amongst<br />
themselves, in a democratic way, what sort of council they want so that can be the sort<br />
of council they can have.<br />
The other thing which has been spoken of is self-government now, selfgovernment<br />
for New Britain, because the Tolai are not the only people on New Britain,<br />
self-government for the Tolai if most of the Tolai don't wan. t it is that what is<br />
suggested? Would it not be well for each man to sit down in his own home and think<br />
what it is he really wants and what advantages he can get from being a part of the<br />
Territory which just recently has moved a great way toward self-government.<br />
I am sure that the people of the Gazelle Peninsula would wish to share in the<br />
wealth coming from other parts of the Territory, would wish to get the benefits from<br />
the copper being discovered in Bougainville, would wish to get the benefits should oil<br />
be discovered in Papua, would wish to have the added economic advantage which being<br />
part of a unit means and which, as Mr. Kaputin said, is the essential basis for real<br />
political advancement. I believe the Tolai would want that. I ask each individual<br />
Tolai to sit down in his house and think whether that is not better for him.<br />
I know that these are problems which are worrying many Tolai. I know that<br />
there are land problems too which are worrying Tolai. I have asked the leaders of<br />
the Mataungan Association to meet me today and ta discuss these problems but they<br />
have refused to do so. Why? / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
So that there can be continued economic progress, continued political<br />
advancement, I ask the Tolai members of the Mataungan Association to ask their<br />
leaders to discuss these things with us, so that the Tolai themselves can resolve<br />
their problems and so that the problems between the Tolai and the rest of the<br />
Territory can also be solved peacefully by discussion and with Australia's<br />
blessing. Thank you. </p>
