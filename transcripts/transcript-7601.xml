PRIME MINISTER<br />
TAiCIIPT orwnocusro, " am= A 19 * AT 1939<br />
E 0 9 PROOF ONILY<br />
JOURNALIST:-Mr Hawks, are you concerned about your chances<br />
in Kingston.<br />
0 Pe1x4c: ellNeon, t wMee'mlble rr. e taiHne ' st hed onseea ta bterceamuesned ouwse ' vjeo b goatn d atnhe<br />
Government will be returned and he'll be returned with it.<br />
You see just because I go into an electorate, it doesn't<br />
mean that we're worried about it. I mean, since-I've been<br />
Prime Minister, which is over 6 years now, I think there's<br />
probably no Prime Minister who has travelled around the<br />
country more than I have. I mean I go into electorates<br />
where we have margins of 301, T go into electorates where vs<br />
have margins of 20, 10, 5 and there's about 51 here. The<br />
fact that I'm here doesn't mean that we've got any<br />
partioular worry about this seat.<br />
JOURNALIST: Janine Raines seems to be polling quite well.<br />
Are you concerned about the threat.<br />
PH: Well, I mean she says she is. I would have thought<br />
that the evidence of the Democrat's polling in the last two<br />
elections that have been on in Queensland and Tasmania would<br />
be leading inevitably to the conclusion that we are seeing<br />
the end of the Democrats In the Australian Senate and they<br />
won't keep themselven &amp; live uLn the flsuw. of flopwoontativoo.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawkep what are going to say to the electors<br />
here in Kingston about high interest rates and going higher<br />
and high bank profit. and going higher. What are you going<br />
to say in the mortgage belt about that.<br />
PX: Well, it's not just what I'll say In the mortgage belt.<br />
I don't have one umasage for the mortgage belt and one for<br />
another. JOURNALIST: But they would be.. </p>
<p>PM: Well, now look are we having a debate or you've asked a<br />
question and you want the answer, 01? Good. Now, the facts<br />
are very simple. We have said that we would keep monetary<br />
policy tight for as long as it's necessary to protect the<br />
Australian economy from the bringing in of a level of<br />
imports that we can't sustain. The simple fact is that the<br />
Australian economy is grawing too strongly. The -I don't<br />
want to burden you with a whole lot of statistics but<br />
there's one simple one which shows what is happening. In<br />
the last year our demand grew by 81, our production by 41,<br />
so we had to bring in half of that Increase in demand<br />
overseas. We are not earning enough to pay f or those<br />
imports and so if we are going to protect our future we have<br />
to lover the level of demand and the only way to do that at<br />
the moment is by having pretty tight monetary policy. The<br />
simple fact is that the interest, not only of people in the<br />
mortgage belt but all over Australia, would be much more<br />
poorly served, their interest would be deveutatedt if we<br />
didn't take steps now to restrain demand because then the<br />
Australian dollar would collapse and interest rates would go<br />
through the roof and the economy would collapse. And I'm<br />
not prepared to do that, even if it would appear at the<br />
moment to be the politically popular thing to do. We have<br />
never dodged taking the tou~ h economic decisions and we<br />
won't now and ultimately we 11 be respected by the electors,<br />
not only of Xingston, but around the country. Now the other<br />
part of your question was about bank profits. Now the<br />
question of what we do is to set general economic policy<br />
including monetary policy and the question of banks and<br />
their profits and rates that they charge is a matter between<br />
banks and their customers.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you accept that you can't<br />
win an election while interest rates remain high.<br />
PM: Well, how do you think we'd go in an election now<br />
we'd increase our majority.<br />
0 JOURNALIST; That's not what the polls are saying.<br />
PM: ani the contrary, you wait and see on the poll, the<br />
latest poll, after the election of Mr Peacock, the latest<br />
Morgan poll, vs would have been elected on Democrat<br />
preferences. And that, say I say, that poll was taken last<br />
Friday before the latest gory round of bloodletting.<br />
JCURNAIST: PM: Now why don't you ask your question a little bit loe<br />
belligerently I can hear you if you put it softly.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was Just trying to get over the top of..<br />
PK: No, well, you don't need to shout* that's all I'm<br />
saying. </p>
<p>JOURlNALIST: Alright, I'm just going to ask you quietly,<br />
when do you think interest rates will come down.<br />
PH: I an not predicting the future of interest rate. In any<br />
immediate sense because the very moment the Prime Minister<br />
or the Treasurer makes such a prediction that of itself can<br />
have an impact on what happens in the market I don't do<br />
that. JOUJRNALIST: Prime Minister, what would you say to people<br />
who wonder how high interest rates and high mortgage<br />
payments are going to stop businesses and big corporations<br />
borrowing capital overseas.<br />
PM: Well, let me make these points about borrowing. What<br />
we've done as a government, and now we've been joined by the<br />
State governments following yesterday, is to reduce very<br />
substantially the demands by government upon savings. What<br />
we did yesterday, in conjunction with a 360 million dollars<br />
reduction of our outlays announced in April, is to have a<br />
three billion dollar cut in the demand by the public sector<br />
upon the community savings. That is, the over one billion<br />
dollars of f our own authorities we'ye cut their borrowing<br />
by over a billion and one billion off the State government<br />
authorities and the one billion reduction in our own area.<br />
Now, with the State government grants and our own cuts, nov<br />
that's three billion dollars cut in the demand by the public<br />
sector. Now that will, in terms of the overall context of<br />
monetary policy, mean that there will be more room for a<br />
call by the private sector upon the Australian savings.<br />
There'll be less need to call upon saving. overseas. Now<br />
that JOtJRNnIST:.. PM: Now wait a minute that's what government can do to in<br />
fact produce the sort of context in which there is more room<br />
for the private sector and for private individuals. And<br />
0 that's what we've got to do reduce demand. We don't want<br />
to create a situation in which there is going to be an<br />
explosion of demand, we've got to have demand at a lower<br />
level than it is now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you decide to call an election because of<br />
the disarray in the Liberal Party.<br />
PH: Not at all. The only talk about an early election, as<br />
I said at a press conference yesterday, was by the deposed<br />
leader of the Liberal Party. When he saw that we were going<br />
to be delivering, on the promise that I'd made twelve months<br />
ago, for substantial tax cuts and that was what I'd<br />
promised more than twelve months ago and what I was<br />
delivering he then tried to divert attention from that and<br />
say well, all I was doing was having some sort of i mme diate<br />
pre-election gimmick, well, I was delivering on the promise </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) that I'd made. I didn't talk about an early<br />
election and Mr Howard did. For that reason also to divert<br />
attention from the pressures upon his own leadership. So<br />
there's never been any talk from me about an early election.<br />
So I'm not in a situation where I'm abandoning some plan and<br />
an I said yesterday, wben you talk about temptation, I now<br />
have a long history of resisting temptation, and I'm doing<br />
it again.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Janine Haines' somewhat cheeky<br />
billboard up at Reynella what did you think of that and do<br />
you agree with the premise of that, that the only reason<br />
you're down here is because you're fearful that you'll lose<br />
PH: Well, that means that I've really never been In<br />
Kingston before, when there's been no Janaine Haines. How<br />
many times have I been in this electorate before?<br />
( I think you've been here four tines.)<br />
PM: four times.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you ever been here for three days before.<br />
PH: Well, I'm not here for three days..<br />
JOURNALIST: You're in South Australia for three days..<br />
electioneering, is that what..<br />
PM: Why don't you sort of get your questionsB a little bit<br />
less belligerently and get them based upon fact. I an not<br />
here for three days..<br />
JOURNALIST: It's very hard to got questions with such long<br />
answers PM: Well, that's your last on.<br />
0 JOiUNALIST: But what did YOU think of the billboard<br />
somewhat cheeky?<br />
PM: No0, while Janine Haine. is putting up billboards we're<br />
putting up child care centres and we're raising the<br />
employment profile. we're creating 1.4 million new jobs<br />
that's what we're building that's what we're putting up<br />
and that's the contrast between the Labor Government<br />
creating a growing economy, growing employment, reduciny<br />
unemployment. Those are the things we put up and I don t<br />
mind, we'll she can put up as many billboards as she<br />
like. JOURNALIST: the more attention we draw to Kingston, the<br />
better your record will look.<br />
PM: The better that's right. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you support the uprising in China.<br />
PM: Do I support-the uprising? Well, I don't know that<br />
it's to be called properly an uprising. Let ms say that I<br />
believe that the authorities in China are to be complimented<br />
upon the way they are dealing with what is obviously a<br />
massive expression of concern for more political reform.<br />
The students who are being, obviously being supported by a<br />
wider cross-sect ion of people, are taking the opportunity of<br />
the new developments in China to express, peaceably, their<br />
views and quite obviously the authorities are dealing with<br />
this in a rational and peaceable manner and it seems to sop<br />
from the fairly considerable knowledge I have of China and<br />
the leadership and what's happening there, that this is<br />
a sensible thing that they are doing and that it's<br />
likely to lead to further opportunities for Involvement by<br />
more people in the political processes.<br />
JOUJRNALIST: But Mr Hawks, could the instability flowing<br />
from this effect Australia detrimentally.<br />
PM: No, I don't think there's any question of a detrimental<br />
effect on Australia and I can only see as far as the<br />
situation In China is concerned an improvement in the<br />
sense that I think any sort of movement which is going<br />
to open up the political processes to give more opportunity<br />
for an expression of view is a good thing and provided that<br />
the authorities can continue to cope with this in the<br />
peaceful way that they are, I think that must be good for<br />
China and people should understand the benefit<br />
( Tape break]<br />
fourthly, we ' vs had a very significant increase in real<br />
benefits for those most In need. For example# if you take<br />
in the area of children, there will in this coming year<br />
be spent over two billion dollars under the Family<br />
Assistance and Family Allowance Supplements Scheme to lift<br />
the real levels of income of those lower income families in<br />
the community most In need. Fourthly, to show the<br />
improvement we would refer to what's happened In the area of<br />
education. When we came to office only 361 of the kids<br />
were staying on In school now 561. Going to other end of<br />
the age spectrum to the aged. Under our predecessors, in<br />
particular under the time of Mr Howard -a 41 reduction in<br />
the real value of penzions. Under us;-a real increase of<br />
over So these are the sorts of things which show the<br />
real improvement in conditions for the Australian people and<br />
obviously now wait a minute..<br />
JOURNALIST: haven't got a grasp of the facts.. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, the Liberals are saying that in this<br />
imminent major statement you're making on the environment<br />
you should really address the issue of the Murray and<br />
especially, because of the importance to South Australia, do<br />
you think that will be looked at in what you're saying.<br />
PN: Yes# the whole question of soil degredation and water<br />
conservation to going to be one of the areas that will be<br />
involved in the statement and of course we've had very<br />
significant co-operation, as you will appreciate, between<br />
the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria and South<br />
Australia on the question of the River Murray. We've all<br />
spent a fair bit of money and there will be reference to<br />
these issues in the comprehensive statement that we'll be<br />
making. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will you be coming back to Kingston<br />
before the next election.<br />
PX: I would think that I'll be back before the next<br />
election it's a fair way off and I'll certainly be in<br />
South Australia and I can't imagine that Mr Dilney won't<br />
grab ms for something in that period. It's always good to<br />
be back here.<br />
