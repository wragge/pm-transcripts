I?<br />
AUSTRALIA Speech by<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
on<br />
The Constitutional Crisis and The Whitlam<br />
Government<br />
( From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 16 October 1975)<br />
Mr WHITLAM ( Werriwa-Prime Minister)<br />
( 10.24)-Mr Speaker, I move the resolution:<br />
Considering that this House is the House of the Australian<br />
Parliament from which the Government of Australia is<br />
chosen; Considering moreover that on 2 December 1972 the Austra<br />
lian Labor Party was elected byjudgment of the people to<br />
be the Government of Australia; that on 18 May 1974 the<br />
Australian Labor Party was re-elected by judgment of the<br />
people to be the Government of Australia; and that the Australian<br />
Labor Party continues to have a governing majority<br />
in this House;<br />
Recognising that the Constitution and the conventions of<br />
the Constitution vest in this House the control of the supply<br />
of money to the elected Government;<br />
Noting that this House on 27 August 1975 passed the Loan<br />
Bill 1975 and on 8 October 1975 passed the Appropriation<br />
Bill ( No. 1) 1975-76 and the Appropriation Bill ( No. 2)<br />
1975-76 which, amongst other things, appropriate moneys<br />
for the ordinaiy annual services of the Governiment;<br />
Noting also that on 15 October 1975, in total disregard of<br />
the practices and conventions observed in the Australian<br />
Parliament since Federation, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
announced the intention of the Opposition to delay those<br />
Bills, with the object of forcing an election of this House; that<br />
on 15 October 1975 the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate<br />
announced that the Opposition parties in the Senate<br />
would delay the Bills; and that on IS October 1975 the Senate,<br />
against the wishes of the Government, decided not to<br />
proceed further with consideration of the Loan Bill 1 975:<br />
Considering that the actions of the Senate and of the<br />
Leader of the Opposition will, if pursued, have the most<br />
serious consequences for Parliamentary democracy in<br />
Australia, will seriously damage the Government's efforts to<br />
counter the effect of world-wide inflation and unemployment,<br />
and will thereby. cause great hardship for the Australian<br />
people; 1. This House declares that it has fall confidence in the<br />
Australian Labor Party Government.<br />
2. This House affirms that the Constitution and the conventions<br />
of the Constitution vest in this House the control<br />
of the supply of moneys to the elected Government<br />
and that the threatened action of the Senate constitutes<br />
a gross violation of the roles of the respective Houses of<br />
the Parliament in relation to the appropriation of<br />
moneys.<br />
3. This House asserts the basic principle that a Government<br />
that continues to have a majority in the House of<br />
Representatives has a right to expect that it will be able<br />
to govern.<br />
4. This House condemns the threatened action of the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and of the non-&amp;. overnment<br />
parties in the Senate as being reprehensible and as<br />
constituting a grave threat to the principles of responsible<br />
government and of Parliamentary democracy in<br />
Australia.<br />
5. This House calls upon the Senate'to pass without delay<br />
the Loan Bill 1975, the Appropriation Bill ( No. 1)<br />
1975-76 and the Appropriation Bill ( No. 2) 1975-76.<br />
This motion brings to the formal notice of the<br />
House a situation of grave constitutional crisis<br />
without precedent in the Australian Parliament<br />
and the Australian nation-without modem<br />
precedent in the parliamentary democracies of<br />
the world. That situation arises from statements<br />
made outside this chamber by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) yesterday that<br />
the Opposition parties will use their numbers in<br />
the Senate to delay the Government's annual<br />
Appropriation Bills, which have been passed by<br />
this House.<br />
Subsequently the Leader of the Opposition in<br />
the Senate ( Senator Withers) moved, and the </p>
<p>Senate passed, an amendment to the Loan Bill<br />
1975 that the Bill be not further proceeded with.<br />
It is transparently clear from what he said that<br />
the Opposition proposes to take the unprecedented<br />
step of blocking the Budget of the<br />
democratically elected Government of Australia.<br />
In the face of the Leader of the Opposition's<br />
attempt to sabotage the foundation of our parliamentary<br />
system, this House must, in unmistakeable<br />
terms, make clear its rights. For the rights of<br />
this House are nothing less than the rights of the<br />
Australian people. This House must expose the<br />
political opportunism of the Opposition in the<br />
Senate for what it is. And what it means is constitutional<br />
revolution-the proposition that governments<br />
can be unmade by the Senate and not by<br />
the House of Representatives-the people's<br />
House. Let me recall the words of the Leader of the<br />
Opposition: The basic principle which I adhere to strongly is that a<br />
government that continues to have a majority in the House<br />
of Representatives has a right to expect that it will be able to<br />
govern. He has professed that principle again and<br />
again. He knows the course of honour, of<br />
decency, of democracy. Yesterday he espoused a<br />
course of action which can only mean that he is<br />
willing to overturn his principles and overturn<br />
the basis of our system. There is the really<br />
' reprehensible circumstance' today-a man who<br />
knows what is honourable, yet who does the<br />
thoroughly dishonourable-the exact definition<br />
of a man without honour, a man without principle.<br />
As another self-indulgent wool grower said<br />
in putting personal interests ahead of the<br />
nation's interest, video meliora proboque;<br />
deteriora sequor.<br />
The House of Representatives-the people's<br />
House-alone determines who shall govern<br />
Australia. Only 17 months ago, the people for<br />
the second time in less than 18 months, elected<br />
the Australian Labor Party to govern for a<br />
further 3 years. I state again the basic rule of our<br />
parliamentary system: Governments are made<br />
and unmade in the House of Representatives-in<br />
the people's House. The Senate cannot, does not,<br />
and must never determine who the government<br />
shall be.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition himself has<br />
asserted that basic principle again and again. In<br />
a very real sense he owes his present position to<br />
the assertion of that principle. He wasonly able<br />
to destroy his predecessor because the right<br />
honourable member for Bruce ( Mr Snedden)<br />
had fatally weakened himself by his attempt to<br />
subvert the principle iii April 1974 and his failure to pledge that he would never again be party to<br />
another attempt.<br />
By appearing as the champion of this basic<br />
parliamentary principle the present Leader of<br />
the Opposition drummed up support among Liberal<br />
senators who wanted security of tenure, and<br />
among the business community who wanted<br />
stability in politics more than they wanted a<br />
change of government. That was how he was<br />
able to destroy his leader-the second time he<br />
had destroyed a Liberal leader by posing as a<br />
man of principle. He enjoyed his honeymoon<br />
with the Australian people precisely because he<br />
professed the principle-the principle that the<br />
elected government had the right and responsibility<br />
to govern for its full term of 3 years. This is<br />
the man of principle, the man of honour, who<br />
stood up in this place on 9 March 1971 when he<br />
for the first, but not for the last time, destroyed<br />
his leader and said of the former Liberal Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, the present Independent<br />
member for Higgins ( Mr Gorton) and the next<br />
senator for the Australian Capital Territory:<br />
This man is unfit to be Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
His own reproach will be his own epitaph. And<br />
it will be my exquisite duty soon to ram this message<br />
home to the people of Australia, in terms<br />
that neither they nor the Leader of the Opposition<br />
will ever forget.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition announces with<br />
some pride that departments are running or will<br />
run short of funds. Of course they will run short<br />
of funds. The Leader of the Opposition is refusing<br />
to pass the Appropriation Bills in the Senate<br />
which provide for the ordinary annual services of<br />
the Government. He will be responsible for bills<br />
not being paid, for salaries not being paid, for<br />
utter financial chaos, and this will continue as<br />
long as the Leader of the Opposition refuses to<br />
allow the Senate to pass the Supply already authorised<br />
by this House, the people's House. And<br />
now, like a pyromaniac he dances around the<br />
fire. He will get burnt.<br />
Let us cut through the humbug. The Leader of<br />
the Opposition has been planning this action<br />
ever since he was elected. And all the nonsense<br />
about ' reprehensible circumstances or<br />
extraordinary circumstances' was so much eyewash,<br />
so much a smokescreen for his real intentions.<br />
Look at the terms of the Senate resolution<br />
yesterday-the reasons it gives for delaying Supply,<br />
for not proceeding further with the Budget.<br />
It mentions the Government's overseas loan raising<br />
efforts. There is nothing in that resolution<br />
which raises matters which were not fully known<br />
on 9 July when the House met to thrash this </p>
<p>whole matter out. Yet neither then nor subsequently<br />
has the Opposition in this House ever<br />
moved a motion of censure or no confidence<br />
upon the Government on this matter, any more<br />
than it has ever been able to bring any specific<br />
charge of illegality or misconduct by the Government<br />
or the Ministers in our negotiations. It is absolutely<br />
plain that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
determined upon his course from the outset, just<br />
as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,<br />
Senator Withers, let the cat out of the bag, last<br />
time, when he said:<br />
We embarked on a course some 12 months ago to bring<br />
about a House of Representatives election.<br />
That is, from the time that the people of<br />
Australia had the impertinence to reject the men<br />
born to rule and to elect a Labor Government.<br />
Over the period of 75 years since Federation<br />
there have been 20 occasions on which the<br />
annual Appropriation Bills have come before a<br />
Senate in which the Government did not have a<br />
majority of its own. There has been a similar<br />
number of occasions in respect of the Supplementary<br />
Appropriation Bills and also of the<br />
Supply Bills. Not one of these Bills has ever been<br />
rejected. They number in all 139. 1 seek leave to<br />
table a list of the Bills concerned.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Is leave granted?<br />
Mr Sinclair-Yes, leave is granted.<br />
Mr WHITLAM-On the other hand, numerous<br />
examples can be given of government<br />
measures other than annual Appropriation and<br />
Supply Bills that have been rejected by the Senate.<br />
In this 29th Parliament alone, in a bare 15<br />
months, 22 Bills have twice been rejected by the<br />
Senate and a further ten have been rejected once,<br />
deferred or unacceptably amended by the Senate.<br />
The contrast between the record of the Senate<br />
over 75 years in respect of Appropriation and<br />
Supply Bills with its treatment of other Bills<br />
points to only one conclusion. The conclusion<br />
must be drawn that the treatment by the Senate<br />
of Appropriation and Supply Bills has reflected a<br />
firm conviction that the. Bills for financing the<br />
annual services of government should not be<br />
rejected. The specious protestation by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition that it is not rejecting the Budget will<br />
fool no one. But it does at least serve to reveal<br />
that even he is conscious of the gross violation of<br />
constitutional principles involved. He shrinks<br />
from calling his action by its true name.<br />
There are compelling reasons why the Opposition<br />
cannot be allowed, in an unscrupulous<br />
grab for political power, to shatter the principles<br />
that have stood for 75 years. Appropriation and Supply Bills can originate only in this House and<br />
the Senate may not amend them for the ordinary<br />
annual services of the government. Responsible<br />
government on the Westminster model, upon<br />
which our system of government is founded,<br />
requires absolutely that the people's House-this<br />
House-through which the Government is<br />
chosen, should hold financial paramountcy over<br />
an upper House. The convention has been clearly<br />
established that the Senate, which has no power<br />
to originate or amend money Bills, shall not<br />
block or reject them either.<br />
The principle I assert is the principle for<br />
which, I am certain, everybody who has stood i~ n<br />
my place in this House would also have stood<br />
firm in the three-quarters of a century that we<br />
have had a National Parliament. Prime Minister<br />
Menzies did. Prime Minister Holt did. Prime<br />
Minister Gorton did and does. I repeat the principle:<br />
The Government is formed in this House<br />
and is answerable to this House and this House<br />
must control financial matters. This has been the<br />
situation in every English speaking democracy.<br />
No other democracy would permit a situation<br />
where an upper House could reject a Budget.<br />
In no other parliamentary democracy has the<br />
elected government been subject to the artificial<br />
pressures and intolerable stress to which this<br />
Government has been subject by the unconstitutional<br />
threat of an election every 6 months.<br />
And that threat has been sustainable only<br />
through the fortuitous, the accidental situation in<br />
the Senate-by the actions of a Senate. described<br />
by, the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr<br />
Killen) as a ' tainted Senate'.<br />
Last night on television the Leader of the Opposition<br />
made 2 remarkable assertions, breathtaking<br />
in their audacious distortion of the truth.<br />
He said that the people of Australia had given his<br />
coalition a majority of senators at the last Senate<br />
election. The truth is of course that at the last<br />
Senate election the People not only recorded<br />
200 000 more votes for the Australian Labor<br />
Party candidates-the. Government-than for all<br />
other Parties represented in the Senate combined,<br />
but elected 29 Labor senators and 29 Opposition<br />
senators and 2 Independents. Because 2<br />
State Premiers flouted another great constitutional<br />
convention, the Government now has<br />
only 27 senators. Yesterday's Senate vote was a<br />
complete distortion of what the people decided<br />
about the Senate in May last year. The second assertion<br />
last night by the Leader of the Opposition<br />
was that the scandalous appointment of a<br />
replacement for the late Senator Milliner by the<br />
Queensland Government was not relevant to </p>
<p>yesterday's decision. Senator Steele Hall nailed<br />
this once and for all when he said:<br />
Let it be remembered that the Opposition succeeded only<br />
because a Labor senator died. They did it over a dead man's<br />
corpse. If the Premier of Queensland had acted honourably<br />
and constitutionally by appointing a Labor<br />
supporter to hold Senator Milliner's place then<br />
the Opposition's amendment would have had as<br />
many senators voting against it as voting for it.<br />
Yesterday's spurious resolution in the Senate<br />
would have been negated.<br />
The political immorality of the Opposition is<br />
demonstrated further by the grossly improper incitement<br />
of non-Labor State governments to restrain<br />
the Governors of the States from exercising<br />
their duties under the Australian Constitution in<br />
relation to periodic Senate elections. On 24<br />
occasions the Governor-General has suggested<br />
to the Governors of the States the date which<br />
they should set for elections of senators for their<br />
States. On four of those occasions-May 1953,<br />
December 1964, November 1967 and 1970-an<br />
election for the House of Representatives was<br />
not held. On all 24 occasions the State Governors<br />
met the Governor-General's request. The years<br />
1975 or 1976 could see the first time in the 75<br />
years during which Australia has had a national<br />
Parliament, the first of the 25 occasions on which<br />
a Governor-General has put such requests to the<br />
State Governors, that a Premier advises a Governor<br />
to disregard constitutional practice, to fail in<br />
the duty which the Constitution imposes on a<br />
Governor. This outrage would be at the behest of<br />
the Federal Council of the Liberal Party last<br />
Sunday-the faceless men of the Liberal Party.<br />
At this time particularly when constitutional<br />
issues are at stake it ill behoves any representative<br />
of the Crown to cast aside the traditions of<br />
his office and throw in his lot with one or the<br />
other of the political parties in dispute on<br />
national issues. It is a matter of grave concern<br />
that a man in this position can be so careless of<br />
his responsibility, so unconscious of the<br />
precedent, so unthinking as to the danger as the<br />
Governor of Queensland showed himself<br />
yesterday. I have recently had occasion to quote many<br />
authorities on the perils of the course upoA which the Leader of the Opposition has embarked-not<br />
least Sir Robert Menzies who founded his Party.<br />
Let me now quote Quick and Garran, writing at<br />
the time of the founding of the Australian<br />
Parliament: The House or Representatives is not only the national<br />
chamber it is the democratic chamber it is the grand depository<br />
and embodiment or the liberal principles of government<br />
which pervade the entire constitutional fabric. It is the<br />
chamber in which the progressive instincts and popular aspirations<br />
or the people will be most likely to make themselves<br />
first felt by the Constitution, it is expressly<br />
intended to be such a House, and by its organisation and<br />
functions it is best fitted to be the area in which national<br />
progress will find room for development.<br />
And this, with a prescience, prophetic insight,<br />
that Quick and Garran would not have claimed<br />
for themselves, gets to the heart and the root of<br />
this present grave crisis. It is because this<br />
Government has attempted to make this Parliament<br />
the instrument for reform, for long overdue<br />
change, for progress, for the redistribution of<br />
wealth, for the uplifting of the underprivileged,<br />
for the reduction of the privileges of great wealth<br />
and deeply entrenched vested interests, an<br />
instrument towards equality of opportunity for<br />
all Australians, that our opponents and those<br />
vested interests have from the very beginning, as<br />
Senator Withers revealed, embarked on a course<br />
to destroy this Government at the earliest opportunity.<br />
But what they are really doing is destroying<br />
the very basis of parliamentary democracy in<br />
our country.<br />
The Senate resolution talks about ' submitting<br />
to the judgment of the people'. Precisely! This<br />
matter should be submitted to the judgment of<br />
the people. It will be submitted to the judgment<br />
of the people. The issue is the unconstitutional<br />
and undemocratic conduct of a chance majority<br />
in the Senate. The issue is the rejection by the<br />
Senate of a Budget designed to bring great<br />
benefits to this nation. It is the Senate which is on<br />
trial. It is the Senate which will have to submit to<br />
the judgment of the people. It is the Senate which<br />
has rejected the Budget. It is the Senate which<br />
must face the people. Again, in the indelible<br />
words of Senator Steele Hall, it is the Senate, the<br />
Liberal Party and the Liberal leader which, by<br />
the course they are now attempting, have sown<br />
the seeds of their own destruction.<br />
