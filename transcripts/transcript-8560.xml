PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH SUSAN MITCHELL, RADIO SAN, 29 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PRESENTER SUSAN MITCHELL.... Well, I did manage yesterday., I<br />
was lucky enough to get the Prime Minister of Australia. Paul<br />
Keating, to have a few words with me about himself and about his<br />
vision for Au5tralia. Because it Was at a public function there<br />
Is.. there might be just a bit of background noise and my voice<br />
isn't necessarily studio qualltW but his is loud and clear as<br />
you' I I hear now.<br />
Welcome to Adelaide, Prime Minister.<br />
PAUL KEATING. Thanks you, Susan.<br />
MITCHELL. Most Of the PIOPle that l've spoken whir l've said.<br />
" Well, now what's the question YOU Most was want mu to ask the<br />
Prime Minister?", thew say. " Ask him If he's for real",<br />
KEATING. What do they mean though?<br />
MITCHELL.... . Well, I think they want to know whether sometimes<br />
when you flick the Vaudeville switch, or you flick other<br />
switches. they want to know the real person that's behind all<br />
those kind of roles that you play I suppose.<br />
KEATING.. . Well. I mean my philosophy is that the place has for<br />
too many years been kidded along by the Political system. In<br />
other words a lot of People In public life knew bitter but<br />
wouldn't say. and they played the silly and : lvil gaine, being<br />
Silly and being civil at the tame.. Same time. and because the<br />
place had so much natural wealth it Sort of muddled through andi<br />
thosc sort of sins of oimission were Sort of forgiven. But when<br />
the world stopped wanting to paW us the prices we thought they<br />
owed us for the things we did in the normal course of events.<br />
like wheat and wool and all these other things. all the sins<br />
became obvIoi4S, and so It's a matter of whether one wants to be </p>
<p>2<br />
civIl and silly and not say, or be a whistle blower and try and<br />
change the place. and I believe that the thing to be is a<br />
changer. to change the place and to call the.. call the tune as<br />
it is.<br />
So. there's not much more to me than that really. I mean I.,<br />
I've done what I mean I work the swstem, the bureaucratic<br />
System, the political system to get the changes. It doesn't<br />
matter whether the' re in. you know, airlines or recent things xwe've<br />
done. pay television. I'm now working on technical and<br />
further education, a national system there. Whatever it might<br />
be at the time trying to break another log Jam. So it's.. I<br />
have some.. over the Wears, like anyone who's been in It a while.<br />
I've developed certain political skills and I trW and use them<br />
and I employ all the tricks of the trade in getting decisions up.<br />
Nothing more, nothing less,<br />
MITCHELL There's a commonly held belief among the Liberals<br />
that If they give you long enough you'll go too far, You know<br />
how you get carried away, they believe, with your rhetoric. and<br />
that Richo's not there to hold you back now.<br />
KEATING No, but RIcho never held me back. I mean I mena<br />
we're at the stage in life all of us where you call your own<br />
tunes. I mean I call.. I've heen calling my own shots for years.<br />
and I mean the Liberals Just sat on their tails for sort of<br />
thirty years and let the place become an Industrial museum.<br />
Anyone that does anything always runs past them. I mean anyone<br />
that wants to exert themselves at all runs past them, and it's<br />
always the case that anyone that does want to change the place<br />
and push It along, in our case make It more relevant in the<br />
world, will always run Into all of these sort of crustW<br />
Conservative characters who don't went to do anythingWell,<br />
that's fine but.. but the system.. the political system owes the<br />
Public something better and so I push and shove and try and get..<br />
get our way on policy and change. an it's mot been easy but<br />
again It's not.. who was It said. " Life was not meant to be<br />
easy" 7<br />
MITCHELL... .( laugh] Well, he certainly wasn't one of your<br />
mentors but one of Uour mentors did saw at some stage, " Don't<br />
forget. Paul, that you're here to hate the Liberals",<br />
KEATING No, no. No. that was Rex Connor who said, " No, no.<br />
We're here to bash Libs". Bash was the word he.. " You're here to<br />
bash Libs". And.. and he meant that for Sort of Sociological<br />
reasons and political reasons. I mean, look I couldn't care less<br />
about them. I mean largely they are largely Irrelevant to the<br />
process and have been for a long period of </p>
<p>time and anybody who wants to. Wou know, to drag the cart along<br />
to sort of get Changes knows that they have to drag them along as<br />
well, that they won't help. Vou know, they won't help, they're<br />
always In therm trying to do something to sort of slow the place<br />
back, and I suppose. you know. you* ve just got to regard that..<br />
You've got to regard that as just part of the sort of general<br />
inertia of the place, that you've got to tug the Show along end<br />
them as well.<br />
MITCHELL... ut whem you look at Dr Hewson acro5s the chamber I<br />
mean do you feel any genuine antagonism for him or is it..<br />
KEATING. Oh no. Look.. look, no. I mean he's here to do a<br />
pal.. he's there to do a political jot and that's fine. I mean I<br />
understand that, but hi doesn't understand about society. He's<br />
come to public life not prepared. This is a society that one<br />
seeks to operate for its betterment and improvement. He thinks<br />
soCiety finishes at the Sydney Harbor Bridge and it starts at<br />
Watsons 9aoj in Sydney. it finishes at the Sydney Harbor Bridge.<br />
anything west of that. Including. you know, Adelaide or, anywhere<br />
else, in a sense doesn't matter..<br />
MITCHELL,... Well, he has close ties with Adelaide. I mean his<br />
family live here.<br />
KEATING. Min. Well, I mean the thing is. you see, is this sort<br />
of view if you haven't got a million you' re a bludger. If you<br />
haven't made a million by the time you're sort of thirty five<br />
well there's something wrong with you. Like his federal director<br />
was saying yesterday. " if you're an the unemployment benefits for<br />
nine months that's the end of you. After that it's not a fair<br />
deal for the taxpayer". In other words if the economic system<br />
has made you unemployed you can go down to St Vincent do Paul's<br />
Society or the Smith Family and get yourself looked after that<br />
way because it'd be unfair to ask the taxpayer to look after you.<br />
I mean this Is the same spiteful view. They.. they're always<br />
trying to sort of penalise somebody, There's no generosity of<br />
spirit amongst them and that's what I find about the Liberal<br />
Party in generally. and also Dr Hewson, therm is no generosity of<br />
spirit. And If.. I1-but beyond that. I mean I don't have any<br />
more contempt for hin than I do hiS party.<br />
MIrCHELL.-. Is he a class traitor?<br />
KEATING. Well, I think so. I think anyone that comes from.. I<br />
Won't say a class traitor. let's not run that too far. He says<br />
to me, " Look there you are standing In a Zegna suit". and </p>
<p>I Say " Ye5. and SO are you. The difference is last night I put<br />
my hand up to give the workforce of Australia occupational<br />
superannuation for the lest., rest of their lives. Last night<br />
you voted t hem) down You put your hand up so they couldn't get<br />
it, That's the difference. It's not how we look. or what sort<br />
Of Suit we've got, or what sort of car we drive. What matters is<br />
where your vote is, where you heart Is, and my vote and my heart<br />
has been always with the great body of the population who happen<br />
to be working people". But that's not to say that people who've<br />
got a quid haven't got a right to Play their role in the system,<br />
and we've also supported them. you know. by such things as<br />
removing the double tax on dividends. which the Liberals never<br />
did. Cutting the top marginal rate fron sixty to forty nine.<br />
You know these are things.<br />
I mean our policies are policies for the whole of Australia, but<br />
sort of there they wire lust Wednesday might in the. in the<br />
Senate voting against a retirement incomes plce to gi1v e<br />
Australians when th~ ey are areient gewCSthe Current age<br />
pension. they voted no. We voted yes, and that's the difference<br />
between us.<br />
MITCHELL.... . Now. there's a rumour that there's going to be an<br />
eleven billion budget blowout.<br />
KEATING. . Well, they're always., I mean this time of year the<br />
estimates for the Commonwealth budget are notoriously unreliable<br />
but we've already published a starting point of ten point five<br />
and no doubt it'll be around that, It could be a little., little<br />
greater than that.<br />
MITCHELL.... And how does that make you feel?<br />
KEATING Well, If It wasn't that there'd be a lot of very..<br />
very., you know, very poor, people out therm because you see only<br />
for the fact we had these huge surpluses.,. you see I was the<br />
first person In Australia to produce as treasurer a budget<br />
surplus. the first ever. We ran those vast surpluses through the<br />
Wears, three or four years. and now because of a fall in<br />
receipts. fall in activity, a fall in company tax Collections.<br />
a pickup in unemployment benefits, the natural.. what's called<br />
the natural stuhilisers in the budget are now producing a deficit<br />
but that will swing back Into surplus when the economy picks up<br />
because thE Lund.. the underlying structure of the budget Is very<br />
good as a result of our work in the 1980s. So it's a cyc. it's<br />
a structural Surplus but a cyclical deficit. </p>
<p>Now l91 me just de.. decode that. It means when the good times<br />
Comne it goes back Into surplus but during the bad times It's in<br />
deficit as It should be to help all those people with<br />
unemploymen~ t benefits who the Liberals would chop off after nine<br />
mom ths. I mean they want to cure the def Ic it -by cutting~.<br />
aUI ng 9 " Look woo've got a wife and three kids have youTM<br />
" Been employed after nine months have you " Yes".<br />
" Sorry. Soup kitchen for you. Soup kitchen for you". That's Or<br />
Hewson's view.<br />
MITCHELL. What ever happened to the J curve?<br />
KEATING. Weli. It.. It worked Its head off, We've been<br />
exporting our head of f allI through the 1960S. We' ve now<br />
manufacturing., manufactured exports are three hundred percent<br />
greater than 1963 and the current account deficit is now down to<br />
two and a half Percent of GOP three from six, six and a half. So<br />
you know, there's been.. in fact if the export sectors now were<br />
not working for us manufacturing would be in much poorer shape<br />
than It is. That i s as domest ic demand's Sone down what ' s taken<br />
the productive place Is exports.<br />
I mean If! you look at the city of Adelaide a lot of firms which<br />
are now associated with.-with the car industry and manufacturing<br />
and those things are now finding export opportunities which they<br />
woulIdn' t heive f ound i n the earlIy I1980s.<br />
MITCHELL,.. They're saying that your emphasis om the flag and now<br />
the oath of allegiance to Australia rather, than the gueen,<br />
Liberals are saying this is a stunt.<br />
KEATING. Oh yeah, well. they always say that don't they. I<br />
mean If there's any.<br />
MITCHELL.~ In fact it's something close to your heart, isn't it?~<br />
KEATING.... It Is, because I think that it we are not.. I mean if<br />
we want to be clear about oursellves, that 15 be strong enough to<br />
say that we want to represent ourselves unambiguously we'll be<br />
strong enough to do things economicaI1w and politically but while<br />
ever we go around in a sort of twilight Zone not knowing whether<br />
we're Sort of someone else's creation or whether were sort of<br />
just an out. Outreach sort of camp f rom another show we' I I never<br />
have that sort of inner strength and confidence that other<br />
countries have got. </p>
<p>I noticed on the Sunday program on Channel Nine yesterday,<br />
Auberon Waugh, there was a program an Britain and the monarchy<br />
and It had Auberon Waugh, who's supposed to be a commentator of<br />
note In Britain, and someone asked him about Australia ard the<br />
remarks I'd made. he said. mOh yes, I think it's a terrible<br />
shame", he said, " that Australia's going to cut this., these<br />
links with Britain". And he said,. " Look. the Americans did and<br />
look what happened to them. They're an overfed fat, garrulous<br />
lot", he amid. The fact that they became the greatest nation on<br />
earth just totally mi. totally went over his shoulder, totally<br />
missed the point. Here he was sitting up saying. MIt's a pity<br />
the Americans turned us down because look what happened to them".<br />
What happened to them Is they became the greatest country an<br />
earth, ( laugh] SO, I mean but.. I mean how do you cope with<br />
these characters. Now the Liberal Party's sprinkled with them,<br />
they're all over the place.<br />
MITCHELL.... . Now. you also Say that it's really important that we<br />
break away from lingering stere. stereotypes of gormiess men<br />
with barbias and shrimps.<br />
KEATING. Mm. well. I think that the.. the great sublety of<br />
Australia.. I mean this Is.. this is the oldest continent on<br />
earth. and we are all caught by the resonances of Australia. all<br />
of our personalities are different than they would otherwise be<br />
were we not exposed to this country. and to.. and also, you know.<br />
the long.. Its history and the history of the Aoiginal pople<br />
and the Impact of that on our society and all the things that it<br />
Is to be Australian. and to have us.. to have all the serious and<br />
subtle things about Australia represented as putting a shrimp on<br />
the barbecue, as important as that may be to those who want, you<br />
know, fun in the sun and all the rest of it, is I think to<br />
undersell us. That IS the serious things about Australia, its.,<br />
Its sort of.. it*% true cultural base. the fact thiat. you know.<br />
we pick up Nobel prizes for literature and Prize and<br />
all sorts of thing.. and that, you know. we have a highly<br />
qualified scientific basis to the country, that In terms of dance<br />
and theatre, in composition, this country has really got big<br />
statements to make. and I think It's a pity we sell ourselves too<br />
short by saying to. you know, the Japanese. the Americans, or<br />
anybody else. " Well, if you Coma here you Can put a shrimp on a<br />
barbecue", as good as that IS, you know, the sort of Hogan image,<br />
what have you.<br />
I mean AuStralia is.. is.. this is.. this is a nation of people<br />
Changing all the time in an environment of a very old continent.<br />
but a continent. We don't share the continent with </p>
<p>anybody and it's a terribly Interesting place for other people to<br />
see and I think that the imagJe that Australia projects abroad<br />
should be an image which., which truly reflects the Subtletlil<br />
and qualities of Australia and not just sort ot,. you know.<br />
basically sort of Wobs with cans In their hand and say. MCome anid<br />
see one of our lor. a1 yobs". Well, who wants to do that?<br />
MITCHELL.... I1 was talking to your minister of tourism, Alan<br />
Griffiths, lost week and Saying that so far most of the images<br />
that the.. certainly t he Australian Tourism Commission have<br />
presented have been images of men and that it's about time that.<br />
you know, Instead of Paul Hogan and Greg Norman we had a woman up<br />
there. because let's face It if we're talking about Tourism there<br />
are a lot of women with money in their pocket who are interested<br />
In coming to Australia and seeing It and those images aren't<br />
necessarily going to attract them here.<br />
KEATING. Well, and a lot of women of accomplishment who.. who<br />
we would do well to have as part of Australia's Image and<br />
representational image abroad, and you know, I could do nothing<br />
but agree with you entirely.<br />
MITCHELL.... So we can look forward to a bit of a change in this<br />
directlIon? KEATING. . WelI I think we 5hou Id. Wherever., where.. I mean<br />
wherever we have the chance to do.. I mean I made the point<br />
during the week that Ambassador Taliwee ( ph spl from the United<br />
Nat ions ceme and received our second report on discrimination.<br />
anti-discrimination In reality against women. and she was making<br />
T he point that Australia's clone much more than most Countries,<br />
and in many respects Is second to none, But this is not known.<br />
not appreciated here. And not only 16 It not appreciated abroad<br />
generally, but not appreciated here that in terms of sort of<br />
opportunities for women. policy in respect of women. Australia<br />
has really been at the vanguard of change. And one hears that<br />
from anyone of international stature who knows about policies in<br />
respect of women around the world. and Opportunities for women,<br />
and.. whether they be. whether they be In things like<br />
participation rates In school or opportunities in terms of<br />
employment, or you know, government policies like child care, or<br />
the family allowance supplement. or preservation of occupational<br />
Superannuation. all of these things which this government has<br />
dome in the last ten years have been important to women and It's<br />
not known, not known abroad. and It's not that well known here. </p>
<p>MITCHELL.... Prime Minister, perhaps just finally, a lot of people<br />
are suffering In this country, which I'm sure Wou're aware of, a<br />
lot of people find It hard to get up in~ the morning and have any<br />
hope about the future, not only for themselves but for their<br />
chilIdren,<br />
KEATING.., Mm.<br />
MITCHELL. Could you perhaps say something from the heart to<br />
give them some hlope?<br />
KEATING.... Well, what I Can say from the heart and from the head<br />
Is that the new Australia will be an externally oriented<br />
relatively efficient trading country which has an economy made up<br />
of the Primary sector. manufactures, and services. It'll be a<br />
relatively sophisticated country tham the one we had in the<br />
or early 80s. that the 80s transition will be entirely Important<br />
to It, it'll have a low inflationarU future, it can stand<br />
therefore much gr-eater levels of growth and with am employment<br />
growth. But it'll.. the difference will be it* iI be sustainable,<br />
and instead of running a large current account deficit, which<br />
means the Government's got to pull the place back to low growth<br />
levels. it'll be able to grow on and maintain its trade while at<br />
the same time maintaining employment. But the interesting thing<br />
will be that the jobs will be Interesting, they won't be the dead<br />
and jobs that were around when I was a kid but more interest ing<br />
jobs for people in the higher orders of., you know. of<br />
manufacturing services and the like.<br />
So the future. I mean, Is very good but you see we're taking<br />
Australia now from the old Australia of the post war years to the<br />
new Australia, end in-. In the transition there is both cyclical<br />
and structural unemployment and business Is languishing but as we<br />
leg them up with growth, as there is.-as a recoverW comes<br />
through. as Is now doing. and employment will be lagged In that.<br />
there's no doubt about that, employment will be logged but it<br />
won't be logged for that long. As the economy grows and these<br />
people are Pulled up into employment then the vista through the<br />
0SO is the vista of a country looking up and out and not looking<br />
down and in as we would have been had we let John Howson, John<br />
Howard. or Malcolm Fraser run the game In the Bos.<br />
Now the rOession we could have done without avoidably. It would<br />
have been good to have avoided It but..<br />
MITCHELL.... . But you sald we hid to have it. </p>
<p>KEATING. Well, we had to have 8 Slow down. We cidnt have to<br />
have as recession, we had to have a Slow down because Wou<br />
couldn't keep Spending twice as much as you produce and putting<br />
it on.. an credit. which is what we were doing. But what we're<br />
going to have now Is a longer run period of growth with low<br />
inflation. more activity. and better jobs, more interesting jobs.<br />
and most particularly many jobs for women, and that will be the<br />
nature of the 90s. So in fact Australia's going to join the<br />
fastest growing part of the world, the Asia Pacific and be able<br />
to join it In full with full membership rather than join it as we<br />
would have in the early 80s as mendicants with no real future In<br />
the sort of higher growth, higher technology of the area. We'll<br />
now be able to join up with full membership which we wouldn't<br />
have been had we listened to the sort of marcs of the Liberal<br />
Party like He.. Howard. Hewson and others.<br />
MITCHELL So you're really saying. " Hang on in there"?<br />
KEATING. It's the most.. this IS the fundamental post war<br />
transition. Now there are problems in the transition but out the<br />
other side it's going to be nothing like the country.. It'll be a<br />
much better country than anything.. any Wou and I have livid<br />
through.<br />
MITCHELL,... Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time.<br />
KEATING.-.. Thank you.<br />
MITCHELL.... That was an interview that I did with the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia. Paul Keting and I think YOU probably get<br />
somec idea of what kcind of vision he has as we are in. he says,<br />
this transition from the old Australia to the new Australia. I'm<br />
sure you found it very Interesting.<br />
