PRIUM E MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Press Conference given by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Harold Holt on his arrival at<br />
Bangkok Airport, Thailand 26TH APRIL, 1966<br />
I would like to say how thankful I am to be able to<br />
take this opportunity to return so soon the visit which your Prime<br />
Minister has recently made to Australia.<br />
As you may hPve learne., the principal purpose of my<br />
visit has been to visit the various countries of South-East Asia<br />
where Australian servicemen are serving and I have just come from<br />
four days in South Vietnam where we have Army and Air Force<br />
servicemen in Saigon at both Bien Hoa and Vung Tau.<br />
. e also have certain civilian units serving in that<br />
country including a surgical unit,<br />
Quite recently we had taken a decision to treble<br />
Australia's representation of military forces in the Vietnam area<br />
and the first battalion of this task force marched through Sydney<br />
on the day I left Australia as a pro-embarkation march before coming<br />
to replace the battalion which has been on service in South<br />
Vietnam. It is only last Thursday that I left my own country,<br />
indeed on that morning I was answering questions in the House of<br />
Representatives. The following day, at the same time, I was with our<br />
troops in Saigon. Today we have been conducting together in Bien Hoa<br />
our Anzac Day service.<br />
Anzac Day for us is one of the most solemn and<br />
significant days in the national calendar as Australian and New<br />
Zealanders celebrate together the anniversary of their landing at<br />
Gallipoli 51 years ago, and your Excellency, this particular<br />
occasion has become a symbol in the minds of the countrymen of<br />
Australia and New Zealand of the need for each generation to fight<br />
its battle for the preservation of liberty, and we felt that there<br />
was special significance in our meeting together on this solemn<br />
day of commemoration at Bien Hoa where Australians an. New<br />
Zealand servicemen are again fighting in this later generation in<br />
the cause of freedom and personal liberty.<br />
WTe have flown from there ( Bien Hoa) to Ubca in your<br />
north where there is an Australian Air F.-rce unit stationed and<br />
after my visit here where I look forward to having talks with your<br />
Prime Minister, and other senior members of the Government and of<br />
meeting His Majesty which it will Live me great pleasure to do<br />
again now for the third time.<br />
Somn years ago I had the honour of escorting His<br />
Majesty and Her M'lajesty, The Queen, round the Australian Pavilion<br />
at Lausanne in Switzerland where we had an exhibition and then<br />
later they came to Australia and I was able to welcome them.<br />
Now I greatly look forward to returning that meeting<br />
in their own country. </p>
<p>After these talks I fly t-Nalaysia anu after<br />
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore I will be proceeding to Borneo.<br />
At each cf these places I shall be having talks with<br />
senior members of the Governmunt and at the same time visiting<br />
Australian servicemen. I think that what emerges from this visit is how close<br />
we have all become, how the problems and the dangers of the one<br />
have become the matters of concern for the other.<br />
I was heartened by what I learned in Saigon.<br />
I talked there to senior members of the Government of<br />
the United States administration, with our own Australian<br />
diplomatic service. I fuund thei all expressing confidence in the<br />
outcome of the military situation although they do have some<br />
concern over the current political difficulties, but at least<br />
they are convinced that the Viet Cong cannot win and that<br />
increasingly from now forward the military success will be with<br />
the forces supportin. the South Vietnamese Government, the<br />
Republic of Vietnam. One of the most heartening, and I think the most promising<br />
develqments, I think your Excellency, is the determination<br />
expressed by the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, by the<br />
United States administration and by cur own Australian authorities<br />
and other friendly forces, to combine with the military<br />
operations services of a positive and constructive kind to improve<br />
the well being of the peoples in the areas that they release.<br />
They have a programme of civic action which has been<br />
carefully planned and is being vigorously pursued.<br />
We visited yesterday one of the institutes where<br />
cadres of men are being trained to go into' villages in support of<br />
the defensive capacity of the villages, but at the same tine to<br />
give specialist service and training so that the economic strength<br />
of the village anm the well-being of the people can be materially<br />
improved and perhaps in this kind of combination of collaboration<br />
for purposes of security and welfare we have one of the really<br />
important answers to the people of Asia in general.<br />
e can all watch with interest what develops in this<br />
direction because success will be a great victory for those who<br />
value freedom.<br />
QUESTION: Recently you introduced conscription in Australia<br />
I am wondering if this might make it possible for you to have more<br />
troops free to come to Thailand in the near future?<br />
MR. HOLT: , ell, we have commitments in a number of directions;<br />
naturally there develops a cortain amount of pressure from various<br />
sources for us to increase our establishment in each of those<br />
places. I do not doubt that it would be desired that we should </p>
<p>3.<br />
have more people in Vietnam or more pcople in Borneo but you must<br />
remember that Australia is a country of less than 12,000,000<br />
people, that we are currently trying to develop a continent the<br />
size of the United States olo America and that we have this<br />
combination of tasks, the normal tasks of a modern Governnicnt,<br />
which are difficult enough, but added to those are the tasks of<br />
increasing our defonce establishment and of the development of<br />
projects which if carried through will add to our own capacity<br />
to extend further aid,. further military assistance to other<br />
people in need of it in this area of the world. </p>
