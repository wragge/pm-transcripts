FOR PRESS P. Mi. No. 5+/ 1967<br />
DEATH OF ADLAI STEVENSON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. Honr Sir Robert<br />
Menzies<br />
The death of Adlai Stevenson is a great<br />
loss not only to his own country but to the world.<br />
He added to his great ability a singular capacity for<br />
expression and an engaging personality which won him<br />
many friends. The Australian Government shares in the<br />
general sorrow that will be caused by his untimely<br />
death. CANBERRA, July, 1965. </p>
