TEL: EMBARGOED AGAINST DELVIBRY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON I' J KEATINGO Mp<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY, ADMIRALTY HOUSE, SYDNEY<br />
26 JANUARY 1994<br />
Ladies and Sentlemien<br />
It is traditional to make personal resolutions on the first day of the year. On the 26th day<br />
We Australians could do worse than to imake out natinnal resolu. tions our collective,<br />
Corporate resolutions.<br />
By thc-26th January, we have had our break from work most of us. Mercifully free from<br />
work and politics, we have had time to reflect.<br />
On the fthMs In the bush and the backyard we have communed a little with the couguy<br />
and our countrymecn and women. We have travelled the highways, seen a bit more of thi<br />
place, got the fedl of It again.<br />
We have watched Australians fuiously competing on land and sea and, who knows, seen<br />
in them some reflection of ourselves or something we would like to be.<br />
If we have 1xccn aniung the countlless thousands who use thc holidays to go to galleries,<br />
theatrcs, museums and festivals of all decciptions, the chances are we have ever so<br />
slightly re-adjusted our conception of what Australia memn and what it mea= to be<br />
Australian. And in general I suspect that, whatever we have done, the majority of us have returned to<br />
work rcncwcd in the belief that, on balance, there is no better place to live than this. Yet<br />
it is also true that many Australians will go back to work this year uncertain of the future.<br />
Many Australians will return unconvinced that we have made the most of what we have,<br />
or that we can shape our destiny.<br />
Thc truth is too many have reason to be unconvinced. And too many have no work to<br />
rcturn to.<br />
Ladics anid gentlicuz<br />
The vicw from here, across the harbour to the nation's birthplace, can only inspire<br />
confidciice. We can stand here and admiire the beauty of it, and all the symbols of our energy and<br />
griuwth, and justly say that Austraslians havc created a great, vigorous and rich society.<br />

But this view Is not available to all Australians. Thc view varies from suburb to suburb,<br />
town to town, workplace to workplace, farm to tarm across the continent. Too often the<br />
view takes in hardsh~ ip, discrimination, and waste.<br />
Thc view depends on the limits of opportunity it depends on the extent to which<br />
communities and individuals have weathered change and the recession, the degree to<br />
which they have it within their power to adapt and renew themselves.<br />
It depends on industry and investmecnt, on employment and educational opportunitice.<br />
It depend-s, thcrcforc, on the extent to which we all of us are prepared to say that, vast<br />
and varied as the continent is, this is one nation and all are part of it.<br />
It depends on the degree to which we are dcteined to balance the principles of freedom<br />
and individuality with the principles of fairnes, cure and responsibility. In that balanc, it<br />
seems to me, lies the principle of nationhood.<br />
This year the lesson has surely never been clearer.<br />
A3 thc New Year unfolded and we enjoyed all the traiditional pleasures of an Austra~ ian<br />
summer, not for the first time we were stopped short by the spectacle of our fellow<br />
Australians desperately defending lives and property.<br />
71oz bushfires in New South Wales, like the floods in Victoria a few months earlier, were<br />
a reminder that we live in a land which is plentiful and benign yet also cruel and<br />
unforgiving. B~ ut Australians have known that since the first months of scttlemient across there at<br />
Sydney Cove.<br />
Thc rcal lessons of the fires seem to me to lie in our response.<br />
Seeing the landscape ravaged by fire reminded us of our love for it.<br />
Seeing mcn and women fighting to save lives and homes and all the products of their<br />
labour remindcd us of the ties that bind Australians wherever they live.<br />
And seeing them triumph reminded us of what we can achieve when we are moved by<br />
thes affections and work together.<br />
In the end It was a triumph of expczience and commitment, of the things we know and the<br />
things we feel ahout Australia.<br />
Thc rcsponw, was magnificent. T'he hindrances to effot and cfficiency in the normal<br />
cours Of OUr affairs appeared to vanish.<br />
State rivalries were put aside.<br />
The bureaucratic black holes and red tape were replaced by dedication and urgency.<br />
Suddenly thcrc was nut a hint of cynicism in the media.<br />
And when it wus over, even as we counted the losscs, we knew the remarkable thin&amp; was<br />
how miuch had been saved.<br />
It waIs a victory. And our faith in ourselves was stronger.<br />
It scem~ s to mc that we can vcry usefully take the lessons into 1994 and beyond. </p>
<p>I I.. L-: 3<br />
We have been through a decude of change and through three yamS of economic recaion.<br />
We now have in economic recovery a broad strons recovery and, because of our<br />
effort,, before us liet an * era of immcnse opportunity.<br />
We have on our hands whAt we haven't had for over a quarter of a cenaury a strong low<br />
inflation recovery which gives us the potential to make the balance of the 19909 one of<br />
thc best periods of opportunity this century.<br />
But we should be in no doubt that this recovery was won by our own exertions.<br />
We got here by virtue of out collcctive will, out collective faitht, our colloctive ability to<br />
think and fight our way thiough it.<br />
What we make of our opportunities in the nineties will equally be a product of out<br />
collecive effort.<br />
And I think there is another lesson we cannot fail to see.<br />
As thim economic recovcry gathers strength we will beat sonie people begin to say in<br />
fact we are already hearing them ever so faintly let's not worry about the unemnployed,<br />
or the communities which are not doing so wel,.<br />
Lat's not pause to take them with us or we might lose momentum.<br />
We's leave them to take their chances in a reinvioratod market place.<br />
Every time we hca this said, we should remember the bushfircs.<br />
We can no more abandon the unemployed or strggling communities than we could have<br />
abandoned those in the path of the fires.<br />
Our sense of justice tells us that we cannot turn our backs on them, but so does common<br />
sense, the sense which tells us that an Injury to one group ofT Australians Is an injury to all,<br />
and that we are all strengthened when we act in concert.<br />
This must not be a recovery for some and not o thczs.<br />
It must not be a top-end-of-town recovery. It will not be for making paper fortunes at<br />
the cxpense of productive investment which will deliver wealth and jobs in the long term.<br />
The rccovery must reach into every community.<br />
It must give hope and opportunity to all Australians.<br />
It must give every Australian the chance to benefit and contribute.<br />
On this Australia Day 1994, on the most sober understanding of the realities, we might<br />
reasonably resolve to make this one of thc great ycars in our history.<br />
Wc might rcasoiiably think that 1994 can be the year on which a future generation might<br />
one day look back anid say tha~ t was thc year when the decision was taken: the year,<br />
wvhen, without ceremony or fanfare, or any campaign to drive thcm, in government and<br />
boardrooms, workplaces and communitics the people of Australia resolved not to waste<br />
the chance which this economic rccovery offers us.-<br />
It cain be the year, I'nm surc, when as a people and a nation we dcide that we will build on<br />
the hard work of the last decade: zo. ian. IJ4 NO. UU 2 </p>

that we will make surn the burden of change and the burden of recession which the<br />
country has borne will not be for nothinS oc for a few<br />
that we Will not squandcrT Our energy anld wealth in corporate greed, or secional<br />
interest, or bureaucratic Inefficiency of provinzcial rivalry<br />
that we will uot rztreat from the future, Or fear it. but take it on aW shape it in the<br />
image of our traditions, beliefs and affections for Austalia and all its peopl.<br />
It cAn be the year in which we recognisc as rarely before in our history, the common caus<br />
among us and pitch in for the future of Australia.<br />
Ladles and Sentlen<br />
Ou Australia Day we honour an Australian who by personal inspiration and effort Wa<br />
made an outstanding contribution to the life of the nation.<br />
It seems to me that the Award Of Australian of the Yea and Young Australian of the yeau<br />
illustatcl the point I have been malcing today,<br />
Thesc awards aire for great Individual achievement, but more often than not they go to<br />
men and womnen whose eforts have been directed towards helping and inspiring others<br />
We honour them on Australia Day because by their eXample they deepen our faith in<br />
Australia and Strengthen tbc ties betwtcn us.<br />
llank you. </p>
