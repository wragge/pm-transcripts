ALP NATIONAL SECRETARY<br />
I welcome the selection of Mr Gajry ray as the new national secretary of the<br />
Australian Labor Party<br />
As an assistant secretary, Gary Gray has displayed a high level of commitment to the<br />
party, and astute political organisational skills. He is known and highly regarded for<br />
his capacity to stay in touch with the views of ALP supporters at the branch level.<br />
As we commence this important fillh term of the Federal Labor Government, I look<br />
forward to working closely with Gary Gray, and benefiting from his commendable<br />
blend of professional commitmnt and Labor heart.<br />
I congratulate the outgoing national secretary, Bob Hogg, on his highly successful<br />
term in the party's top job. I thank him and wish him well.<br />
