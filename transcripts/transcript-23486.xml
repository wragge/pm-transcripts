    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Abbott, welcome to the show.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well itâs lovely to be with you. Thank you for having me on.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Prime Minister. How do you feel after youâve finally given birth to this Budget? You and Joe Hockey, itâs been your little baby for a little while, are you feeling ok about it now?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, look, I think itâs the right Budget for our country. Yes, itâs a tough Budget, but itâs also a visionary Budget because as well as necessary expenditure restraint, thereâs the worldâs biggest medical research fund and thereâs the biggest infrastructure fund in the Commonwealthâs history. The equivalent of 10 Snowy Mountains schemes in new infrastructure will be built over the next decade as a result of last nightâs Budget.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Now itâs actually quite good for Sydneyâs west, isnât it? Because they get the lion's share of an $11.6 billion infrastructure growth package, can you paint a picture of what the hell that means in laymenâs terms?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well what it means is that within a decade youâll have WestConnex well and truly built which will connect the west to the city, to the airport, to Port Botany. Youâll have NorthConnex built which means that the missing link in that terrible traffic jam on Pennant Hills Road will be fixed. Then, really importantly, weâve got all of that work associated with a future airport for Western Sydney done, youâve got Bringelly Road â the work will start within near within a couple of months, youâve got Elizabeth Drive upgraded and youâve got the Northern Road upgraded.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Are we going to have an airport, Prime Minister? Will we have our second airport in Sydney?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, the short answer is yes. There will be an airport for Western Sydney, but youâll get the roads first and then the airport. Weâre not going to dump an airport in Western Sydney without giving the people of Western Sydney the extra infrastructure that they need because letâs face it, Western Sydney has been neglected for far too long and I want to end the neglect because it is such a fantastic and dynamic part of our country and it deserves much more support from government.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, it seems to be a delicate balance that youâve tried to strike between austerity and stimulus and Nobel Prize winner for economics Joseph Stiglitz has been directly critical of your Governmentâs austerity measures. How do you respond to a man with such impeccable economic credentials?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well what weâre doing is weâre spending less on short-term consumption so we can spend more on long-term investment and the difficulty that we had was that we were blowing too much borrowed money. Iâm not against borrowing, but youâve got to borrow for the right things not the wrong things and borrowing to build new roads thatâs economic infrastructure for the future makes sense. Borrowing to pay the school kids bonus or the low income support payment that makes no sense and thatâs why things like this will be going as part of this Budget.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, Sophie here, I love talking politics; I was just wondering I donât have any kids and I like to drink a lot of wine.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Good, you sound like fun, yes.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>I am. How will this personally affect my life?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, the abolition of the carbon tax will certainly be good for you and if the economy strengthens in the long-term thatâs good for everyone, including single people who like to drink a lot of wine.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Awesome and now this is the last serious question Iâve got for you. How do you feel about Jay Z and Beyonceâs sister having a fight?</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Have you been across that Tony? I know youâve been locked away doing your homework.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Look, no, Iâve been a sort of a Budget hermit. You know, the most exciting thing I do is watch a couple of my colleagues have a cigar occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Is that Monica Lewinsky?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>This is Canberra, not Washington!</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Joe Hockey, he canât afford that!</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Tony Abbott, Iâm so sorry about that visual, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>And just very quickly, any tips? Weâve got three guys â Iâm one of them â and weâre wearing budgie smugglers and weâre going to put $750 worth of coins in it and then we have to go through an obstacle course and the person with the most amount of coins at the end wins $1,000 and Iâm playing for a home listener. Whatâs your tips to retaining coins in your budgie smugglers?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Donât wear budgie smugglers in Canberra because nothing fits.</p>
<p><strong>PRESENTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thatâs a fair point; theyâll tax you anyway so youâll end up with none.</p>
<p>Thanks so much Tony Abbott, really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No problems.</p>
