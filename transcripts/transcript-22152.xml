    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will provide $50 million for the expansion of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.</p>
<p> The funding will contribute towards a seven-storey extension of the Institute that will double the floor space available for medical research.</p>
<p>This will allow the Institute to significantly expand its research activities, particularly in the areas of cancer and infectious diseases.</p>
<p>   The Institute, established in 1915, is regarded as one of Australia's foremost medical research organisations.  It has an international reputation for the high quality of its basic and applied research.</p>
<p>  The Institute's prime areas of research include cancers such as leukaemia, lymphoma and breast cancer; immunology; auto-immune diseases such as juvenile diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis and infectious diseases such as malaria and influenza.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the Australian Government has provided $104 million to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research through the National Medical Research Council.  Today's commitment of a further $50 million this year builds on this commitment to the Institute's outstanding work.</p>
<p>   The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that Australia remains a world leader in health and medical research.</p>
<p>  The Australian Government provided about $460 million in health and medical research funding in 2005 through the National Health and Medical Research Council, more than double the funding provided in 1999.  </p>
