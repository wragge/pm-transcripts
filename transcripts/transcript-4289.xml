_.) AUSTVAI I A<br />
FOR PRESS10 DECEMBER 1976<br />
NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD<br />
The New South Wales Premier, Mr. Neville Wran, has<br />
communicated with the Prime Minister over the future<br />
of the Newcastle State Dockyard. His message and<br />
the Prime Minister's reply are attached. I </p>
<p>0. IL PRIME MINISTER C: ANBERRA<br />
My dear Premier, I refer to your telex message of 9 December<br />
about the future of shipbuilding at the State Dockyard<br />
at Newcastle and, in particular, the Heads of Agreeme-nt<br />
and the Industrial Relations Contract between your<br />
Government and the ACTU and shipbuilding unions at<br />
Newcastle. Your message states that you understand that<br />
the President of the ACTU will be meeting me shortly to<br />
discuss these matters. That is not correct. My<br />
discussions with Mr. Hawke on Monday next are to cover<br />
wages policy matters.<br />
The position is that the New South Wales<br />
Government, as the owner of the ' Newcastle State<br />
Dockyard and the employer of the union members in it,<br />
made approaches to the Commonwealth with the aim of<br />
keeping the Dockyard in operation. As a result of those<br />
approaches, and its consideration of the IAC Report and<br />
various other reports, the Commonwealth decided on the<br />
Heads of Agreement for an Industrial Relations Contract.<br />
In our discussion on 19 November I made it<br />
clear to you that the Heads of Agreement are firm and<br />
final and that the Commonwealth expected that you<br />
would negotiate the Industrial Relations Contract with<br />
the ACTU and the shipbuilding unions. You accepted -that.<br />
At no stage was it contemplated that the Commonwealth<br />
would be involved in the negotiations with the ACTU and<br />
unions. You agreed to respond before 17 December on<br />
the results of your negotiations, and on your<br />
Government's attitude to the other contractual<br />
arrangements necessary for the construction of the two<br />
ANL ships at Newcastle. o. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Nothing has happened to alter the position<br />
reached at our meeting on 19 November. It would<br />
therefore be inappropriate for me to discuss the Heads<br />
of Agreement or the Industrial Relations Contract with<br />
Mr. Hawke and I do not intend to do so. It is, I<br />
repeat, up to the New South Wales Government, as the<br />
owner of the Newcastle State Dockyard, to negotiate the<br />
Industrial Relations Contract.<br />
I look forward to receiving advice of your<br />
Government's position before 17 December, as agreed. o<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
( Malcolm Fraser)<br />
