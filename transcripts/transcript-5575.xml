PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, APRIL 28 1981<br />
STATEMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT<br />
-MR PEACOCK'S RESIGNATION<br />
The Member for Kooyong, in his letter of resi gnation and his<br />
public statements at the time, made a number of charges about<br />
the conduct of Government business, about the stability and<br />
direction of the Government, and about myself.<br />
Mr Speaker, there were one or two issues that he raised at<br />
the outset. Let me make a comment about them.<br />
The purpose of the Monetary Policy Committee of Cabinet is<br />
to consider matters relating to interest rates, banking policy<br />
and currency exchange rates. That is its only purpose. I agree<br />
with the Honourable Gentleman. After that report in the newspaper,<br />
he did raise the matter with me. I can remember making a comment<br />
toat-least. one_ of-my. col leagues about. it. I think it was before.<br />
I had pneumonia, but I think the Honourable Gentleman is in error<br />
in saying that he revived my memory of it early in the new year.<br />
It is also a matter that could have been raised in Cabinet<br />
itself. In the formation of this new Government, it was determined that<br />
the Wages Policy Committee would not be re-established because<br />
it. had--not met all that -often,,.. and that the proper..-forum for<br />
those-matters should be'Cabinet itself rather than a committee<br />
of Cabinet. That was why my Department put recommendations<br />
to me, which, as I believed on good grounds, ought to be<br />
accepted.<br />
Mr Speaker, the only other point at this moment that I would<br />
want to touch on two points, and very briefly.<br />
He mentioned the Public Service Arbitrator, and the incorporation<br />
of that within the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.<br />
The recommendations because they are recommendations and not<br />
decisions of the committee chaired by Sir Phillip Lynch,<br />
had not come to Cabinet, and indeed, it was only two or three<br />
cays ago that Cabinet determined the matter, and on the advice<br />
of the Minister for Industrial Relations, it is being left for<br />
further review. But no final decision had been made on that<br />
matter. It was a matter that would come to Cabinet. It was a<br />
matter which in the course of its wide ranging review, as<br />
Honourable Gentlemen will understand, Honourable Members will<br />
understand, will be brought before the.: Parliament later this<br />
week. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Mr Speaker, the Honourable Member for Kooyong knows full well,<br />
I spoke to him about the ICI matter there was very great<br />
concern because of the report in the Melbourne Herald that<br />
the 35 hour week issue was up, that the flood gates were up,<br />
and that something had to be done to stop a rash of decisions<br />
as a result of that newspaper report coming on top of the<br />
Altona decision. What was said then, what was said in the<br />
press statement issued by my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Industry and Commerce, who surely has a significant responsibility<br />
in relation to these matters, reflected a press statement<br />
issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and by<br />
Mr Garland several months ago in the earlier Government.<br />
There was nothing new in relation to it.<br />
Mr Speaker, it is the Honourable Member for Kooyong's concern<br />
in speaking to the House today to substantiate the charges he<br />
has made against the Government and against myself. It would<br />
have been much better, Mr Speaker, if he had spoken to me<br />
or to his Cabinet colleagues along the way.<br />
Only seven weeks ago, the Honourable Member said that,<br />
" for all that people write that there is enormous division<br />
between us, the reality is we work very effectively and very<br />
closely together". That.. wasin a newspaper report of March 8, 1981.<br />
I was pleased with that view of our relationsh-ip. It was expressed<br />
only last month, and I am puzzled, Mr Speaker, and saddened<br />
at what he has now done.<br />
Mr Speaker, on April 10, the former Minister's Senior<br />
~. Private _-Secretary, -spokeat a meeting -that . had..-been<br />
advertised as open to'. the Press. He made a wide ranging<br />
attack on the Government. He specifically attacked aspects<br />
of the Government's actions on industrial relations, and<br />
he accused certain people of a dishonest approach.<br />
I had no doubt that the principles of Cabinet Government<br />
required that~ Mr Simon should resign. Under our system of<br />
Cabinet... Government -no-Minister. could publicly.. attack Cabinet.--~<br />
and not resign. By . the same token, neither can a Minister's<br />
Senior Private Secretary attack Cabinet and Government policy,<br />
and remain in his position.<br />
As is my practice, I consulted my senior colleagues to<br />
test their view, and they agreed. I spoke to the former Minister.<br />
* I wanted him to understand clearly that it was not only my view,___-<br />
but-that of his colleagues, that Mr Simon should go.<br />
Mr Speaker, if a Minister holds a view which is contrary<br />
to that of all his colleagues, it is surely fair enough to<br />
expect him to check his own view to see whether it is appropriate,<br />
especially in a matter such as this. Mr Speaker, it says<br />
something about a Minister's attitude to Cal~ inet, and to Cabinet<br />
solidarity, if he requires that his own view should stand<br />
without the agreement of Cabinet as one against all the rest.<br />
In Mr Simon's case, where the implications of collective<br />
responsibility were so clear, and the former Minister was<br />
aware of. the strong view--of his senior colleagues, I cannot<br />
understand how he believed that. Mr Simon could stay. </p>
<p>3<br />
Mr Speaker, the Member for Kooyong has given as grounds for<br />
his resignation, that Cabinet is not consulted, but bypassed,<br />
that Ministers are not given sufficient co-operation and support,<br />
Let me start with consultation, and let me indicate how Cabinet<br />
does operate.<br />
Cabinet today operates precisely, according to the principles<br />
of Cabinet Government. </p>
<p>4<br />
If there is any difference between this-4nd previous Coalition<br />
Governments it would be that Ministers are consulted more and<br />
that they are more involved in the decision-making process.<br />
Non-Cabinet Ministers are normally encouraged to be present<br />
at Cabinet meetings if there is a matter of interest to them.<br />
There are regular full Cabinet meetings.<br />
Under former Coalition Governments non-Cabinet Ministers were<br />
usually present only when their own items were being dealt with.<br />
Let me also refer to the way in which revenue decisions are taken
in the Budget context. These decisions must obviously be<br />
taken by a small group. In many Governments they have been<br />
taken by two or three Ministers only. But under this Government<br />
they are now taken in the Co-ordination Committee, meeting with<br />
the-Treasurerand. with-the Minister for Finance.<br />
In addition, there is consultation with Cabinet and the Ministry<br />
about broad options, but before the Committee makes its final<br />
S decisions. Cabinet Government requires wide consultation and wide participation<br />
of Ministers in the Government's affairs. In the circumstances<br />
of modern Government this is achieved by the extensive use of<br />
Cabinet Committees. The Committee system is a well-established<br />
and an essential ingredient of Cabinet Government. It spreads<br />
the workload amongst Ministers and allows the system to cope<br />
efficiently with a massive volume of business.<br />
Leaving aside the Co-ordination Committee to which I will<br />
return.-the. general rule-is that Standing Committees-of the<br />
Cabinet take final decisions. Specialcommittees are also<br />
established from time to time. The Committeeof Review of Cmmnwealth<br />
Functions is a recent example and it has taken many, many<br />
decisions indeed but decisions of thatCommittee are<br />
recommendations to Cabinet. The committees do not normally take<br />
final decisions. They make recommendations which go to the full<br />
Cabinet. Now let me turn to the Co-ordination Committee, which normally<br />
takes--final decisions on policy issues-only in relation to the.<br />
revenue side of the Budget. Its fundamental role, as set out<br />
publicly in its terms of reference, is to provide a forum for<br />
senior Ministers to consider overall Government strategy. It is<br />
comparatively unusual for the Co-Ordination Committee to look<br />
beforehand at matters going to Cabinet. I have had a check made<br />
and this shows that well over 90 per cent of matters going to<br />
Cabinet have had no prior substantive discussion in the<br />
Co-ordination Committee. Sometimes the nature of the discussion<br />
is not worth these matters being discussed at all. But we ask<br />
the Minister to bring them forward the kind of discussion<br />
that a Prime Minister should have with senior colleagues. </p>
<p>The kinds of issues which do go first to the Co-ordination<br />
Committee are those in which a Minister would seek some discussion<br />
with senior colleagues before deciding what to propose to<br />
Cabinet, or in which there is a particular political or strategic<br />
significance on which some broad discussion might be held in<br />
the Co-ordination Committee before the matter is looked at<br />
in Cabinet.<br />
Since 1979, the membership of this Committee has comprised the<br />
five most senior Ministers; the leaders and deputy leaders of""<br />
the Coalition Parties and the Government Leader in the Senate.<br />
Other Ministers are co-opted to its meetings wherever possible.<br />
if there is substantive discussion on matters bearing on their..<br />
portfolios.* That is clearly why the Treasurer and the Finance<br />
Minister are often co-opted in the Budget context.<br />
The Co-ordination Commiittee also-assists me with advice on matt~ ers<br />
which are for my decision as Prime Minister. These are matters<br />
such as a letter to a Premier on a sensitive issue, or the handling<br />
of some representation, made to me on some policy or administrative<br />
matter which in the past may well have been determined unilaterally<br />
by the Prime Minister of the day. I find invaluable the<br />
Committee's advice in such cases.<br />
Let me refer to two other aspects of the Cabinet system.<br />
No Ministers belong to all the committees and further, Ministers<br />
are sometimes unable to attend meetings.<br />
Inyboth circumstances~ -however,' all ministers -are -bound by the=-<br />
decisions and this includes the Prime Minister. When I am overseas<br />
. or.. on leave, the business of. Cabinet Government must go on and.--<br />
many decisions are taken in my absence.<br />
Let me add that in the last two years, more than 400 final decisions<br />
have been taken by committees of which I am not a member. Yet<br />
I am quite properly bound by those decisions. I see the<br />
relevant papers of course, when they are circulated, and I may<br />
ask . that-a matter may be re-committed if I have some problem<br />
with it. Each and every other Minister has the same right, and<br />
on occasion that right is exercised.<br />
Against that background, I return to the charge that I have a<br />
determination to try to get my own way in Cabinet and that the<br />
system is manipulated to that end.<br />
I reject those charges totally. I reject them also on behalf<br />
of my, colleagues on whom they reflect. What does it say of<br />
my colleagues that I, as Prime Minister, can persuade them all to<br />
caucus for one particular view.-That charge is as offensive to them<br />
as it is offensive to me.<br />
The principles of Cabinet discussion, decision and responsibility<br />
have been re-asserted and strengthened since the Government came to<br />
office in 1975, by contrast with the way in which they had been<br />
downgraded in the previous three years. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
The objectives of extensive Cabinet consultation and the widest<br />
possible involvement-: of Ministers have been paralleled, as<br />
Members on the Government side would know, by the system of<br />
Party Committees and Party participation which I have<br />
encouraged and in many senses initiated. Legislation goes to<br />
Party Committees before going to the Party room. There is<br />
broader consultation on these matters than ever before as is<br />
especially known to Members who were here in earlier times'and. Athis<br />
has led to greater participation of Members of the Party who have<br />
an interest in a particular matter. There is a philosphy<br />
, behind that approach, one of involvement and of recognition of. the--..<br />
contribution that all* Party Members have to make. The<br />
Cabinet has been run on the same philosophy.-<br />
If the former Minister's description of the operations of the<br />
0 Cabinet were accurate, it would be plain that the Party room<br />
has been operating on one philosophy and the Cabinet on another<br />
and that is just not so. In considering what might have led the<br />
Honourable Member for Kooyong to make these particular charges,<br />
I wondered if it could be related to the number of occasions<br />
on which his colleagues in the Cabinet took a view different<br />
from his. I asked for some analysis to be madi and this has shown<br />
that of the total submissions put forward by the former Minister,<br />
in his Foreign Affairs and Industrial Relations portfolios,<br />
his own recommendations were accepted without any significant variation<br />
in almost 90 per cent of cases.<br />
Some of the cases where they were not accepted, or not in full,<br />
. were-simply questions of funding levels in the Budget context,....<br />
where no Minister would expect his bids to be accepted in full.<br />
Even so, the former Minister was able to convince Cabinet to lift<br />
Australia's foreign aid vote from $ 347 million to-<br />
$ 547 million and this has fully maintained the real value of the<br />
foreign aid vote and is an achievement at a time<br />
of general expenditure restraint.<br />
And, a Cabinet Minister must recognise that no Minister, and<br />
no Prime Minister, can expect to get his way on every decision,<br />
not even on every decision within his own portfolio.<br />
I commissioned a review in the latter part of 1978 in the course<br />
of which the views of all Ministers were canvassed. The recommendations<br />
brought--forward as a result were largely adopted by<br />
the Cabinet, including changes arising from suggestions by<br />
the Honourable Member for Kooyong.<br />
I submit again if the Honourable Member had concerns about the<br />
way the system was operating or about the handling of any<br />
of his individual submissions, then these concerns should have been<br />
raised with me or with Cabinet. Cabinet is a group of men<br />
and women and if they have a complaint about the way Cabinet<br />
is being run, that is the forum with which it should, indeed </p>
<p>7<br />
there is a duty, to so raise it in that forum. These concerns<br />
should not have been raised in the way they were, in a letter of<br />
irrevocable resignation. I also mention the fact-that in<br />
October last year the Member for Kooyong accepted a new commission<br />
in the Government and that is a significant factor indeed.<br />
If he had any concern as to his treatment as Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs, should he not have raised the matter then<br />
and said then" I want matters to be handled differently from<br />
that which they were when I was Foreign Minister?" He did<br />
not at that time raise any such concerns with me at all.<br />
This might be an appropriate time to say something about the<br />
issue of Pol Pot. The Member for Kooyong has spoken about<br />
it at length and let me emphasise one point which is of great<br />
significance and I believe Mr Speaker, that it is a point that<br />
would be shared by all-Honourable Members in this House. The<br />
only issue in relation to Pol Pot was the issue of timing.<br />
Because of the nature of the Pol Pot regime de-recognition at<br />
some point was inevitable. It was a brutal, it was perhaps the<br />
worst regime since the time of Hitler<br />
in the last world war and Cabinet had received a number of<br />
submissions from the Minister or Acting Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs suggesting that recognition be continued, that the policy<br />
be kept under review and that de-recognition be deferred, and over<br />
the months and the time before the period about which the<br />
Honourable gentleman spoke, that had come forward, that on those<br />
occasions Cabinet had accepted the recommendations. But at all<br />
times it was kept under continuing review.<br />
Although in July the Minister had admitted publicly that his<br />
own view may have changed, he had later indicated that the<br />
matter came to eabinet but because of its concern for<br />
co-operation with ASEAN, Cabinet re-affirmed the view they<br />
had earlier been recommended by the Honourable gentleman. But<br />
it was still a question of timing, not one of principle, it was<br />
-only a. question of timing and nobody in this House has a<br />
monoroly of moral repugnance, but we did believe we should<br />
offer further support to ASEAN countries.<br />
The matter was certainly discussed with Mr Lee during the<br />
Commonwealth Head: of Government Meeting at Delhi. And on the<br />
flight from Delhi to Singapore, the Singapore Prime Minister,<br />
the Honourable Member for Kooyong and myself discussed the<br />
matter. Mr Lee argued at length that recognition should be<br />
continued and I pointed out to him that his Delhi press<br />
conference left that far from clear and was open to either<br />
interpretations. I also told him that there was increasing<br />
public concern and that it was important not only that the<br />
Australian Government, but also that the Australian people<br />
should understand the general position of ASEAN because<br />
they live closer to the problems and closer to the dangers<br />
than do we in Australia. 4 </p>
<p>8<br />
But in Singapore, and the Honourable gentleman did not<br />
come down to Australia with me on that aircraft; he came on<br />
a commercial aircraft, and I stayed longer, in Singapore, the<br />
Singaporean Prime Minister indicated that he would issue a<br />
formal statement. I did arrange with the Prime Minister of<br />
Singapore for a copy to be cabled, and for distribution in<br />
Australia, because as I have indicated, it was important not only<br />
that Government, but also the people of Australia, understand<br />
the nature of that view. I did not know of the existence of<br />
certain correspondence between the Singaporean and the Australian<br />
Foreign Ministers. I still have only seen a draft of one of<br />
the letters because I am advised that no departments hold the<br />
correspondence. If I had known that Mr. Lee was going to<br />
quote from those letters I would obviously have sought to deter<br />
him from doing so. Let me repeat, the division between the<br />
Minister and Cabinet was never one of principle. It was one<br />
of timing, and I was surprised indeed, when the Cabinet<br />
determined on the llth of September for a general election and<br />
when Ministers agreed with that, including the'Member for<br />
Kooyong also agreeing with that date, and after the processes<br />
had irretrievably been set in train, to find that the Minister<br />
found his position in the Government untenable.<br />
I regret that the Minister seems to believe that there were<br />
commitments given in Singapore, in Delhi, because there were<br />
no such commitments and indeed let me assert without<br />
equivocation because of the nature of the Cabinet decision<br />
taken in July no commitment was necessary because / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
that decision left it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, to bring the matter<br />
before Cabinet at a time of his choosing. It did not need<br />
the concurrence of the Prime Minister or of any other Minister,<br />
and therefore to be told after the date of the election<br />
had been -determined and the processes set in train' that<br />
his position was untenable, was something that I found hard<br />
to understand. Because in discussing the date of the election,<br />
if there was a problem in relation to it, surely there was a<br />
duty upon him in Cabinet to mention that problem, to mention<br />
that difficulty, and it was never mentioned in Cabinet<br />
discussions at that particular time.<br />
Mr Speaker, something has been said about three options., and<br />
a commitment given in relation to a very brief press statement<br />
I issued on the date of Mr Simon's resignation. It was the<br />
minister for Primary Industry who exchanged that piece of<br />
paper with the Member for Kooyong for the piece of paper with<br />
Mr Simon's resignation on it. There was no commitment going<br />
beyond that, because, as I indicated later in a press conference,<br />
that report was inaccurate, specifically over the question of<br />
whether there was a statement of resignation or whether<br />
there were three options put. As the Minister ' for Primary<br />
Industry wrote down, the options were that he would resign<br />
over the failure to de-recognise Pol Pot, that the Government<br />
would change its policy, or that there was to be no change<br />
of policy, aid that nothing would be done until after the election,<br />
but that he would not take part in a new Government.<br />
Those of us who discussed this matter, including the Member<br />
for Kooyong, Mr Speaker, indicated that that third option was<br />
no option at all, that the path would be too dangerous for<br />
any government, because if that did happen to leak in the<br />
middle of a difficult election, then quite plainly, the<br />
position of a government and government parties, would be<br />
very damaging indeed. Soi-the-matter had to be -properly<br />
determined, and it was determined.<br />
Mr Speaker, it has been said in the, presence of one of my<br />
* colleagues by the person who wrote that story, -that that story--<br />
did not come from my office, or from anyone associated with me,<br />
and if there was any indication, Mr Speaker, in the Honourable<br />
* Member's-remarks-that it had, then the writer of-the story,<br />
and-the Honourable Gentleman who has preceded me, knows that<br />
imputation is incorrect.<br />
Mr Speaker, let me turn to the statement that Ministers are<br />
not given sufficient co-operation and support, that there is<br />
interference, and an undermining of Ministerial authority.<br />
Mr Speaker, there is a defence built into our system of<br />
government, against the emergence of presidential-type<br />
government, and that defence is the strong Cabinet system<br />
which operates. It is inevitable that in these days, that<br />
Prime Ministers become involved in a wide range of issues.<br />
No Prime Minister can refuse to take an interest in major issues<br />
affecting the Government, in main stream issues of concern to the<br />
Australian people, the Prime Minister plainly must be involved. </p>
<p>10<br />
I have had great involvement in economi-c'. matters, but I believe<br />
that neither the former nor the present Treasurer have found<br />
that involvement in any way excessive. And when we look<br />
at the overwhelming degree of-acceptance that Cabinet gave<br />
to the submissions of Kooyong when he was a Minister, that<br />
surely indicates in plain terms the measure of support that<br />
he was getting, both from the Cabinet and from myself.<br />
Indeed, I am sure the Honourable Member will recall that<br />
earlier this year when the question of responsibility for<br />
the public handing of industrial disputes, the general<br />
responsibility on behalf of the Government, I made it clear<br />
in Cabinet that the Minister for Industrial Relations should<br />
take the lead.<br />
Is that undermining.? Is that working overtly, or covertly<br />
to diminish the former Minister? Again, thinking back to the<br />
time when the Member for Kooyong was Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, I sought to make sure that Foreign Affairs concerns<br />
were adequately taken into account as I did in relation to<br />
the discussions about airfares and ASEAN.<br />
I can remember when the former Minister and I met with officials<br />
including Transport officials, to make sure that everything possible<br />
had been done to cover the Foreign Affairs' interests in these<br />
particular matters. My involvement here is the proper role of<br />
a Prime Minister working to make sure that the interests of all<br />
Ministers and all Departments are fully and properly considered.<br />
That, Mr Speaker, is not seeking to undermine, it is seeking<br />
to support and to protect the proper and legitimate interests<br />
of this nation. It makes no sense to suppose that a Prime Minister<br />
would seek to undermine the authority of any of his Ministers,<br />
for such a course of action would only undermine the authority<br />
of his own government.<br />
The Member for Kooyong made a significant charge when he said<br />
-that the-stability -and sense of direction of the Government<br />
had been cast aside. I find it strange, Mr Speaker, that the<br />
Honourable Gentleman makes such a charge now. How can a Ministe~ r<br />
sit in Cabinet, for year after year, holding such views and never<br />
raise those views in Cabinet itself? If any Minister felt that<br />
way, should not he tell me, should he not advise me his colleagues?<br />
I have introduced regular meetings of the full Ministry to enable<br />
Ministers to raise any matters that they wish, concerning the<br />
Government and its policies. opportunities have been deliberately<br />
provided. Why did the former Minister never raise these charges<br />
or complaints in Cabinet with me or with his colleagues?<br />
Let me add that if there were any truth in the claim that the<br />
stability of the Government had been cast aside, which there iLs<br />
not, then it would not have been I, nor any other present member<br />
of the Government, who would have cast that stability aside.<br />
Australia is plainly one of the most stable countries in the world.<br />
People know where they stand by contrast to the chaotic situation<br />
under Labor. There is renewed confidence throughout Australia.<br />
The direction of the Government has been continuously maintained<br />
every since we came to office in 1975. The disaster of Labor<br />
helped us to make our perception of our own direction clearer ta<br />
ever. </p>
<p>11<br />
Throughout the last five years, our first priority has<br />
been to restore the economy after Labor's madness. This was<br />
our pre-eminent responsibility for a strong economy as the<br />
precondition for almost any other objective. / 12 0' </p>
<p>-12-<br />
The most vital element in restoring the economy has been the<br />
attack on inflation. Everyone knows that this Government has<br />
maintained that direction unswervingly.<br />
We camne to office stressing the value of the individual, and the<br />
need for increasing opportunities for all Australians. We have<br />
always been a Government that cares about people for that is<br />
what Liberalism is all about.<br />
The Government's direction has always been that individuals are<br />
the best judges of how to spend their own earnings, that the<br />
disadvantaged and the needy must be provided for, that the tax<br />
burden must be reduced, that employment must be increased, that<br />
freedom of choice must be paramount.<br />
I believe that no Australian Government has been more dedicated to<br />
strengt-hening the -free-enterprise system than this Government,<br />
more determined to avoid waste and over-regulation by Government,<br />
more purposeful in strengthening the independence and responsibilities<br />
of--the States.--This -Government is committed to the widest possible<br />
use of the market.. as-the way-to give consumers the greatest<br />
influence over the allocation of resources.<br />
The Government has consistently stressed the importance of<br />
individual rights, an unyielding resistance to racism, discrimination<br />
and exploitation. There has never been a Government more<br />
determined to stand up for the individual agaitist powerful unions,<br />
against bureacracy, against racism, and discrimination.<br />
Through the Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and<br />
through our support for a Human Rights Commission, we have<br />
demonstrated-this commitment unambiguously. Our freedom of<br />
information legislation if too mild and cautious for some of our<br />
Members, is a.-significant start. It is this Government, not Labor__..<br />
for all its professions, that has been prepared to make that start.<br />
-I am proud of what we have been able to do in defending our<br />
magnificent national heritage against exploitative developments.<br />
and in protecting the environment. Through all our policies WE!<br />
have -acted to'protect -and to advance -the interests of those in-. 77'<br />
need, to make sure that expenditure restraint in other areas haLs<br />
been sufficient to guarantee adequate assistance to those who need<br />
it most.<br />
Massive increases have been possible by this approach in aid of<br />
the handicapped and disabled and the Government's expenditure now<br />
runs in that area to more than a billion dollars.<br />
What policies and actions could be more Liberal than these?<br />
There is still far to go in many areas, but the catalogue of our<br />
achievements is a good checklist of what a Liberal direction is<br />
all about.<br />
Let me turn to the directions which the Government takes in<br />
international affairs. This is an area in which I have always<br />
thought that the former Minister and I have co-operated significantly<br />
for Australia's advantage. I believe that our achievements bear<br />
out that claim. </p>
<p>13<br />
The Government established a new sense of purpose and<br />
direction in our relationship with South Pacific countries,<br />
an area which was largely ignored before 1975.<br />
The first-Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting<br />
was established on Australia's initiative. These Meetings<br />
have established a framiework of co-operation between<br />
Commonwealth and States within the region which was previously<br />
lacking.<br />
During his period as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Government<br />
helped to achieve greater relevance for the Commonwealth in<br />
dealing with human rights and threats to peace. At. Lusaka, we!<br />
supported the proper independence of Zimbabwe and the full,<br />
euality of all members of that state before the law. We were<br />
both conscious that if Australia's approach at that Conference!<br />
was not successful, then he and I together might well have beEn---<br />
somewhat isolated in our spectrum of politics within this<br />
country. But we went ahead together in spite of that, and<br />
enhanced Australia's reputation as a result.<br />
The then Foreign Minister was fully involved in all of these<br />
matters. By our actions, we made clear to the world the direction<br />
of Australia's concerns. Again, Australia was at the forefront<br />
in our realisation of the growing military might of the Soviet:<br />
Union, and in our awareness of its significance.<br />
In 1976 I spoke to this House on that subject. That speech was<br />
prepared in co-operation with Foreign Affairs. Here is an issue<br />
of incalcuable importance on whic h I worked closely with the<br />
former minister to make plain the direction of Australia' s<br />
policy. Since we came to office in 1975, the Government has consistently<br />
enhanced Australia's constructive role in world affairs and<br />
strengthene * d Australia's independent voice in the world. There<br />
was no undermining of his authority as Minister in any of this.<br />
Let me add that when the Member for Kooyong was Minister for<br />
I -thought it-proper that he shou-ld-accompany<br />
me whenever possible to major international conferences or visits<br />
overseas. That is not the practice of all Heads of Government,<br />
-as he well knows. But let me say again that far from undermining<br />
his authority, I-was-s-eeking-through-hispresence on these visits<br />
to provide for the fullest participation of the Foreign Minister<br />
and to enhance his and Australia's reputation. Not surprisingly,<br />
the direction of our policy in Foreign Af fairs benefited as a<br />
result. It seems to me that in the perspective of the issues of great<br />
and enduring importance to Australia on which we have worked<br />
together, personal feelings and difficulties should be treated<br />
as of little consequence. This Government has achieved great<br />
and significant objectives. The Honourable Member has been a.<br />
part of that.-How can it be that he has now turned aside? How<br />
can it be that the concerns he has enumerated today were not.<br />
raised with me or the Cabinet? How can it be that he chooses<br />
this place to damage a great political party, even if that is, not<br />
his intention, and good Government. / 14 </p>

The hopes and opportunities of millions of Australians depend<br />
to a very significant degree on what we all do in this place.<br />
They expect better from us than we sometimes provide. They h2Lve<br />
every right to expect more than has been provided in the last<br />
fortnight. It is not surprising that people are concerned,<br />
when issues which they rightly regard as minor and irrelevant<br />
or which they cannot understand are given a quite disproportionate<br />
weight. The well-being of this country, as history has<br />
demonstrated, depends upon the strength and cohesion of the<br />
Liberal Party and this Coalition Government.<br />
My concerns are for Australia and all Australians~ andwith<br />
security for all Australians the benefits that the applicatio-nof<br />
our Liberal philosophy can bring. Sometimes I am accused<br />
of being too blunt, but if this country is to be governed well,<br />
it is not always possible to avoid an argument. Firmness and<br />
determination--are often the-only answers to unreasonable<br />
actions. Plain speaking is necessary to defend Australia's<br />
markets against powerful trade groupings such as the European<br />
Community. I make no apology for having an intense pride in Australia and<br />
things Australian and I will always stand for that with whatever<br />
strength I and this Government can command.<br />
I do not apologise because Cabinet brought in the Air Force to<br />
protect people stranded through the actions of selfish militant<br />
unions in the Qantas dispute The Government will continue to<br />
take the firmest possible stand against the job-destroying<br />
hour week campaign. This Government is the protector of the<br />
people, the defender of individual rights and of the interests of<br />
the Australian community. I -am proud to lead a Liberal based<br />
Government which is prepared to act and stand up for the interests<br />
of Australia. One of the most pleasing things about Australia<br />
at the present time is that the philosophy of this Government has<br />
become so widely accepted throughout the community people are<br />
now recognising the benefits of more limited Government in lower<br />
taxes, in more jobs, higher growth, better incomes, lower inflation<br />
and more available resources to help those in need.<br />
This recognition is the true mark of the success of the course<br />
-we marked out in 1975. Our-direction-is clear, and all Australians_-_--<br />
will benefit further as a result.<br />
The Member for Kooyong has stated plainly and repeatedly, and.<br />
from the very first, that his s , tatement today will end the matter.<br />
-We all welcome that. I approach the future without rancour.<br />
My enduring concern is the great importance to Australia of the*<br />
stability of Government, the achievement of our common purposes<br />
and the implementation in policy of our Liberal philosophy.<br />
