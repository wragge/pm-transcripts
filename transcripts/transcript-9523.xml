TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH CHRISTOPHER CORDEAUX, RADIO 5DN, ADELAIDE,<br />
23 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
CC: Paul Keating is sitting opposite me, good morning.<br />
PM: Glad to be here.<br />
CC: Thank you very much for your time. I understand you are here for<br />
some fairly high powered stuff.<br />
PM: Yes I am here to, basically, start off this investment and strategies<br />
conference this morning, looking at the future of South Australia and<br />
what strengths it has and how we might advance them.<br />
CC: From our sample that we have here, the people who we contact<br />
through the telephone, we never see them mind you, but we hear<br />
them. I have the impression that the ordinary person is more<br />
interested in politics at the moment than he or she has possibly ever<br />
been before. It is becoming the next nouvelle thing, I think, is to be<br />
involved and to want to be more involved and to have actually looked<br />
up democracy and public servant in the dictionary and been surprised<br />
at the meaning of those words.<br />
PM: Look, I think, there is an enormously healthy public debate in Australia.<br />
For instance, the fact that you just made this point and you can be<br />
discussing on radio things about the economy or social policy or the<br />
environment or whatever it might be, this doesn't happen in the United<br />
States, it doesn't happen in Britain. You don't get the same general<br />
involvement by the community in public policy issues. So, there is an<br />
enormous conscientiousness about the Australian electorate.<br />
CC: Well, they are very interested in you at the moment.<br />
PM: Well, they are always interested in Prime Ministers.<br />
CC: But they are particularly interested in you, I think, you have one of<br />
those jobs. Did you ever go to Luna Park in the old days? </p>
<p>PM: I did, yes.<br />
CC: Remember those faces that stood there day after day having things<br />
thrown at them, that was their job.<br />
PM: I know.<br />
CC: I think they have kind of put you in a position a bit like that at the<br />
moment. I have suggested to people that they get a picture of you and<br />
a picture of the Leader of the Opposition, who ever that may be at the<br />
time, and put them both on the fridge and put underneath the question<br />
" Is this man headed for the 21 st century?" And, answer it privately for<br />
themselves every day. Now, I think that is the question don't you?<br />
PM: I think it is. The system basically runs itself. The job of Ministers and<br />
Prime Ministers is to nudge it along and change it. That is all it is<br />
about. I mean, to be sitting around, to be sitting in a government job<br />
with the white car and the rest, but not changing anything, well it is to<br />
just waste your life away and kid people that you are actually doing<br />
something for them. I think we have just got such an enormous<br />
opportunity, we are the only nation in the world that has a continent to<br />
itself, we are in a temperate part of the world, we are close now to the<br />
fastest growing markets in the world, we have got an opportunity we<br />
have never had before in our history and to not recognise the<br />
opportunity and not got for it is to really sell yourself short.<br />
CC: Well, I think, people do in fact perceive that at the moment and<br />
everyone who has asked has and who have been overseas recently<br />
particularly says that they are astonished at what a good place<br />
Australia is really compared to the situation in the rest of the world, but<br />
I think that entitles them to give more trouble to the people who are<br />
running it because if something is pretty good, you want it to be<br />
perfect. If it was totally out of control, you would think well, what the<br />
hell it doesn't matter. But the difference between how it felt to be on<br />
one of Magellan's ships and how it feels to be the captain of a cruise<br />
ship is significant isn't it?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
CC: And, I think a lot of people feel that these days when you talk about<br />
things like, those words that have become I think probably the worst<br />
cliches of the present era, which is development, growth, and<br />
employment and interest rates you can throw in as well, but it is like a<br />
cruise ship the answers are no more interesting than the question<br />
and contain no more information, the questions sometimes have more<br />
information in them than the answers that you actually get but can't<br />
we start talking about, when you talk about growth and development,<br />
about growth of human imagination, growth of optimism and<br />
development into developing the new ideas, I mean developers think<br />
they are doing new things. They are not, they are doing old, boring<br />
things. </p>
<p>PM: Old, boring things, exactly.<br />
CC: Well, we could lead the world.<br />
PM: This is why, Christopher, I have been speaking about our identity. I<br />
don't think you can feel confident about yourself as a country or about<br />
ourselves as individuals if our sense of ourselves and the creative<br />
spirit of ourselves isn't both there and being harnessed and being, if<br />
you like, used in a corporate way to identify us as a nation. It is all of<br />
those cultural, in a sense, spiritual things about the country which I<br />
think you are getting at.<br />
CC: Well, why don't we hear more about it?<br />
PM: Because we have got a whole set of media reference points about<br />
' now Prime Minister, can you give us a guarantee that interest rates<br />
won't run up tomorrow morning?' You say ' oh, well ok' and that is your<br />
point. Where the real question is is this a different sort of society? Is<br />
it getting a real sense of its own self importance and capacities? Are<br />
we trying to bring the most creative people forward and free rein to<br />
those who can add something new and in the making of something<br />
new can we make that linkage to these massive markets and societies<br />
and old societies around us and be part of them?<br />
CC: Like Indonesia for instance. Surely it is a bit old fashioned to be<br />
selling rifles isn't it?<br />
PM: Well, maybe it is old fashioned, maybe it's right, I don't know.<br />
CC: But there are some very good things that we could be selling<br />
Indonesia that will help all of us.<br />
PM: One of the things we are selling, obviously, is going to be health<br />
services, we are going to be selling them all sorts of internationally<br />
traded services, education, things like that.<br />
CC: Let's just take solar power for a second. We actually lead the world in<br />
that department and if more solar hot water systems, just as a simple<br />
example, were made 4,000 jobs I've heard, straight away. Something<br />
useful, doing something clean, doing something that people can<br />
actually be proud of. But instead of that, you hear this job<br />
development goes into things like making new cars or something.<br />
PM: As you know, we have had a number of break throughs in solar<br />
technology and solar power lends itself, particularly to these many<br />
islands in the Archipelago of Indonesia, where they don't have a<br />
national power transmission system. Where they have got to have<br />
local power which either runs on diesel or kerosene or something else.<br />
They are the sort of things we can do. But we also do a lot with water<br />
up in those countries, that is, the producing of water and its<br />
cleanliness. I think, we have got a fairly and I hope now, a proud </p>
<p>record with countries like Indonesia, but the main thing is<br />
understanding that these are very old societies and they have their<br />
own mores and traditions and while we have been given the great<br />
opportunity of inheriting this continent, we have to come to terms with<br />
them, they live next door to us.<br />
CC: It would be great to talk about that, just that one subject all day, but<br />
there is a whole list of things, everybody has given me a different<br />
question in here..<br />
PM: I can hear the fax machine, grinding away behind you.<br />
CC: There is a full board of questions out there, the one last thing that I<br />
would like to say is and I suppose everyone is saying this so there is<br />
not much point in saying it again, but that business over there with the<br />
BBC, I think probably people appreciate hearing..<br />
PM: Which was that?<br />
CC: It was a piece of parliament, is sounded more like a soccer game or<br />
something like that. There was a thing, I don't know which tribe it was<br />
or maybe it was all tribes of the north American Indians, had<br />
something call the speaking stick and when something had to be<br />
discussed, the person who held the stick was the only one who could<br />
speak at the time. If you wanted to speak you had to get the stick.<br />
Now, in the end things degenerated a little bit and eventually people<br />
possibly were even killed to get the stick from them, but nobody dared<br />
to speak without the stick. Now, maybe that would be a good idea.<br />
PM: Well, one thing is for sure, that this notion of trying to talk over people,<br />
if you have got something to say generally, if it has got some value, it<br />
will stand up. But, I mean, television in some respects has changed<br />
the way the House of Representatives works because now everybody<br />
thinks that they are on television and they want to get the tuppence<br />
worth in because they know it gets into a 30 second grab and that's<br />
that. But I don't think the BBC should be going on about it. The<br />
Hansard records of the House of Commons would make your hair<br />
stand on end. Our place is just so tame compared to that place.<br />
CC: I think people have been surprised since they have actually had<br />
access to it and I think actually that parliamentary station on the ABC<br />
tv and radio is going to suddenly turn up as a top rating station in the<br />
near future. People weren't aware it was there and they weren't aware<br />
of what it sounded like.<br />
PM: One thing about pay television, of course and those other things, you<br />
will have these, particularly fibre optic cables, you will be able to just<br />
have that channel permanently if you want it. If you wanted to be a<br />
glutton for punishment, but if you wanted it.<br />
CC: I think people think really that Parliament should be more like a court<br />
or a church. </p>
<p>PM: Absolutely.<br />
CC: Or something like that. This business of concerted almost organised<br />
crime in the back benches of just shouting people down.<br />
PM: It means if you are a Minister trying to answer questions<br />
extemporaneously you can hardly hear yourself think.<br />
CC: OK, we can probably hardly hear ourselves think with all the things,<br />
that people are actually saying waiting on the other end of the<br />
telephone lines around the place if we could hear them, so we had<br />
better go to those people.<br />
Q: Good morning, Mr Prime Minister. I have a question about the up front<br />
fees for students. I am the future of South Australia, I am a mature<br />
aged student doing a higher degree in indigenous education and the<br />
up front fees for me is going to mean I can't continue with that study, I<br />
can't influence my children, I can't be an active participant in my<br />
society with what I am getting from those studies and I would like to<br />
know how the Prime Minister can justify this unempowering so many<br />
people like me with these up front fees.<br />
PM: I think that first of all that the government does not support up front<br />
fees for domestic undergraduate students. First time entrance to<br />
university or a particular university course, I don't think, should be<br />
hindered by a student's financial circumstances. During our term of<br />
office we have overseen quite dramatic expansion in the number of<br />
higher education places and they have risen by about 65 per cent<br />
from 350, 000 in 1983 to nearly 600,000 today. So, in response to<br />
university wishes this Government has given institutions greater<br />
flexibility and responsibility in managing their own affairs including<br />
allowing charging of fees for post graduate students not receiving<br />
scholarships. But you are talking about up front fees for domestic<br />
under graduate students and we don't support up front fees for<br />
domestic under graduate students.<br />
Q: Good morning, Prime Minister. I am an ex-allied serviceman, I fought<br />
in the Pacific against the Japanese, became a POW on the Burma<br />
Railway for three and a half years and in 1950 came to Australia and<br />
became a naturalised Australian in 1954. My wife is an Australian, my<br />
children and grand children were born in this country. I would like to<br />
receive the same entitlements of an Australian ex-serviceman, but my<br />
most concern is for my wife who is Australian, who became a war<br />
widow after and received the same entitlement as wife from<br />
Australian ex-serviceman. I put my life on the line to defend this<br />
country against the Japanese, what is part of my life now, why can't I<br />
not receive the same treatment after all I am an Australian now?<br />
PM: Let me tell you this, I sympathise most sincerely with all of the people<br />
who served in the war as prisoners of war. It is one thing, not only the<br />
enormous sacrifice in combat, but being interred, to be locked away </p>
<p>and to be deprived is, I think, a singular burden which people have<br />
carried and, of course, many didn't survive it. They made, as we all<br />
say, the ultimate sacrifice. We do make special provisions in our<br />
treatment of veterans' entitlements, for those who were prisoners of<br />
war, but I think your position probably is that you are supported by The<br />
Netherlands, are you not in some sort of veterans' entitlement and you<br />
have come to Australia subsequently. You would find Australian<br />
service men and women around the world getting service pensions<br />
from here in other countries, by and large most of these things equate.<br />
They are very similar to one another and in some places we top them<br />
up as we do with some of the British pensions. But, I'm just not certain<br />
about The Netherlands.<br />
Q: Good morning Prime Minister and welcome to our State. I know it is<br />
easier for others to criticise and for the person running the country,<br />
I'm not here to criticise. My question is, would you know the reason<br />
behind the dumping of NSW's nuclear waste on South Australia?<br />
PM: The nuclear waste is mostly low level waste which is in the suburbs of<br />
Sydney. It is at the Lucas Heights establishment originally and it went<br />
to St Mary's which is, again, out in the western suburbs in a housing<br />
area. This waste is going to be transported to the Range Head site at<br />
Woomera where until the Commonwealth decides what the long term<br />
site will be for a national repository. That is, the plan of disposal of low<br />
level radio active waste. The Range Head site is owned by the<br />
Commonwealth, it as you know, has a history of being associated with<br />
weapons development and I can assure you that all safety procedures<br />
are going to be observed in the transportation and storage of it and the<br />
fact that it is geographically within the borders of South Australia<br />
means, in terms of any problem it might have, is very greatly<br />
diminished there than it is with other people in the suburbs of Sydney.<br />
CC: Dean Brown doesn't actually want it on his roads he says.<br />
PM: He said that, but he has also written to me asking me can he use the<br />
same repository for his nuclear waste.<br />
CC: What, yours?<br />
PM: Use ours. So, he is telling the public here this is a dreadful thing and<br />
then he is writing to me saying can I use the site too.<br />
CC: If I can just throw a question in here, this is something that has been<br />
on peoples minds because, I think, unfairness is one of the things that<br />
produces the biggest result in anyone from a child to an adult and you<br />
probably know that business a few years ago. Those three men who<br />
risked their lives to save an environmental disaster on the boat, the<br />
bow fell off a boat or something and there was the possibility of all this<br />
oil going into the sea of Western Australia. They were rewarded for<br />
their heroism with varying amounts of money and now the tax office<br />
wants to take half of that. Now, that seems terribly unfair to people in<br />
their minds. What is the thing about taxes, I mean, a lot of people </p>
<p>consider taxes are there basically as sticks to hit people with or carrots<br />
on the other hand to encourage them to do certain things, some<br />
people think that. How do you think about taxes?<br />
PM: I think they are something nations bear for the, I mean, we are all part<br />
of the social contract. The contract is that we expect to have health<br />
services and roads and telephones and the rest and there is a<br />
minimum level of taxation that keeps all that going and we try as<br />
Governments and a society to keep that balance about right. In the<br />
case of these people, I mean, I can well and truly understand their<br />
disquiet and disappointment about this. I didn't know about this<br />
Christopher, until you mentioned it. You can take a lottery win and its<br />
not taxed, it depends on whether it is income or paid as income or<br />
whether it was paid as an ex gratia payment or whether it was an<br />
award. I mean, I don't know enough about it, but if they received it for<br />
heroism..<br />
CC: Well, that's what it was, but the trouble is that it was part of their job it<br />
was seen as, but on a broader level surely while taxes are what you<br />
say they are obviously, isn't it possible to also use them as a device to<br />
encourage certain things in the economy and the society and<br />
discourage others and still get enough money to keep the roads being<br />
built?<br />
PM: I think so, well just take Australia. This is the lowest taxed country in<br />
the world, in the developed world. We are running this country with a<br />
share of revenue, that is all revenue to the size of our economy,<br />
revenue to GDP the economists call it, it is about 26 per cent.<br />
CC: What I'm saying is, couldn't it be used more like a controlling device<br />
rather than just a way of raising revenue?<br />
PM: I think it does have, for a start the income tax system is progressive, it<br />
means that those who earn the greatest incomes pay the most, the<br />
rates rise as your income rises, there is a user charge component say<br />
of petrol taxes, I mean they are not without their social import.<br />
CC: Some people think that a very influential control the taxes are<br />
having is the payroll tax is, in fact, having the effect of reducing the<br />
incentive to employ people and they also think it is unfair.<br />
PM: That may well be true although employment has been rocketing along.<br />
We have had 91,000 job growth last month, we have had 590,000 jobs<br />
now since the election and while there is no doubt a cost there, if you<br />
look at the overall level of wage cost, that is salaries and supplements<br />
and on costs which may include payroll tax, by and large the<br />
Australian wage bill is now we are regarded as basically a very<br />
competitive country and that is why so much investment from abroad is<br />
coming here.<br />
Q: Good morning. What I want to say is I'm on a disability pension and<br />
after I pay my rent I am left about $ 95 a week to live on and I have to I </p>
<p>go to a naturopath or physio and you have to pay full price for that.<br />
Isn't there some way you could just do something for people on<br />
disability pensions, so they can go to naturopaths or something like<br />
that and get it cheaper?<br />
PM: Naturopaths and some people in those fields, of course, are not<br />
covered by Medicare and they are not deductible and you don't get the<br />
per cent rebate or you don't get bulk billing so it becomes a cost.<br />
As you know, this Government has introduced rent assistance for<br />
people renting privately<br />
Q: Yes, I get all that.<br />
PM: I might add my opponents want to take it all away from me, of course.<br />
They think it is all too much Government spending. That is code for<br />
ripping that sort of stuff off people. I always wonder why they always<br />
want to hurt the people at the bottom end of the queue, but they do.<br />
Q: They were saying they want to bring in an inspection on cars over five<br />
years old and things like that, it only hits people with no money.<br />
PM: Anything that is a flat charge doesn't take account of capacity to pay.<br />
That is why most of the things the Commonwealth does with Medicare<br />
for instance, you don't pay a cent of the levy until you are over a<br />
certain level of income in the odd $ 20,000, it is why we try to protect<br />
those who are disabled or who are on age pensions with, for instance,<br />
with the pharmaceutical discounts et cetera. But when State<br />
governments levy charges like car registration fees and things they are<br />
just flat costs. It costs the same to register a car whether you are a<br />
millionaire or whether you are on a very low income.<br />
CC: A fax has just come in and this is the other question that is around, the<br />
republic. Everyone seems to have an opinion about that, it must be a<br />
good topic because everyone thinks something about it. I would like to<br />
ask you the question, which kind of republic do you consider the best<br />
for Australia Austria, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Argentina,<br />
Philippines or Irish republic or Canadian. I didn't know Canada was a<br />
republic but it says here they changed their flag and cut the size of the<br />
members of government, but kept their constitution in tact.<br />
PM: We are now currently, Christopher, in our Cabinet discussing some of<br />
the modalities of Australia moving to an Australian person as our head<br />
of state. I think we would like to see that accomplished in a way which<br />
doesn't fundamentally alter our current system of government.<br />
CC: So, what difference would it actually make?<br />
PM: Well, it gets back to the point I think you made earlier, that is we are<br />
gathering about ourselves much more confidence about our identity<br />
and who we are, pride in the fact that we can do things both culturally<br />
and economically we have got a relationship now with these old and<br />
large societies around us like Indonesia and China and turning up </p>
<p>saying ' look, we know all these years you thought that we were just a<br />
chip off the European block, but really we are here in our own right, but<br />
excuse me, by the way, we are borrowing the monarchy of another<br />
country, do you mind?'. They say ' come on, you can't be serious'. So I<br />
think, in the end and, of course, the other thing is I notice last week<br />
Prince Charles, while I was in Europe there was a report in the British<br />
press that he is leading a trade delegation to Islam representing, he<br />
said, he is going to spend more of his time promoting British business.<br />
Not Australian business, British business. Not Commonwealth<br />
business, Canadian business, Australian business British business.<br />
This makes the point again. Basically, the Governor-Generalship is<br />
the deputy's office of the Queen, it is out there on a sort of<br />
constitutional limb, it is hurting us in this region and we are saying not<br />
only that it is hurting us, it is actually diminishing our own sense of<br />
ourselves.<br />
CC: Wouldn't you have actually been offended if he had been promoting<br />
Australia, wouldn't you in fact be saying that it is none of his business,<br />
that we should be promoting ourselves, if in fact he had been..<br />
PM: No, I don't mind him promoting Australia, but it just makes the point<br />
that the Queen of Great Britain is essentially, her principal task is as<br />
Monarch of that great country and that is fine because she is Queen of<br />
Great Britain and she is their Queen just as I met the Dutch Queen in<br />
The Netherlands. But the thing is she is not our Queen, she is not an<br />
Australian. It is not an Australian monarchy.<br />
CC: It is some kind of nostalgia or something if a lot of people feel very,<br />
very connected to that and the passport and things, this latest bit I<br />
think people find I don't know how many people have even looked at<br />
their passport and seen the Queen mentioned in it, but the idea of<br />
taking her out of it seems to have upset a lot of people.<br />
PM: The thing is, let's keep on the substance and not the shadow. The<br />
substance is whether an Australian person is our head of state,<br />
whether we are grown up enough, enough about ourselves to have as<br />
our head of state an Australian person. That is the key point. All the<br />
other symbols, I think, are ancilary points.<br />
Q: Good morning. My question is a social policy question and it is related<br />
to principles of democracy and it is related to family law. Since 1975<br />
we have had no thought? divorce in this country, but we have seen a<br />
preponderance of court orders made in the preference for sole custody<br />
and this is in the majority of cases for children with little relationship<br />
with their fathers. We know that this is currently being debated in the<br />
Senate or about to be, but I would ask the Prime Minister what his<br />
position is on the value of families in Australian society and whether he<br />
sees that replacing the Office of the Status of Women with an Office of<br />
the Status of Family is a progressive step to make because I would<br />
suggest that the Government runs the risk at the moment of<br />
formulating social policies that have very much to do with the feminist<br />
movement. </p>
<p>PM: Cut that out, no. Just understand where we are coming from. I mean,<br />
I mentioned on the program earlier we have had 590,000 jobs since<br />
that last election and over two million since the Government came to<br />
office. That is jobs inside Australian families. That is increasing the<br />
income of families, in fact, household this is a very important number<br />
this household disposable income, that is the disposable income in<br />
an Australian household has risen by 40 per cent since the<br />
Government has been in office. That is after you have washed the<br />
inflation out of it, 40 per cent in real terms which is a staggering<br />
statistic. Now, that is about binding Australian families together, a<br />
priest I knew once said to me when poverty flips in, love flips out the<br />
door and I have always thought this has a lot of truth to it. I think,<br />
stability in family incomes and more employment in households are<br />
one of the things which helps hold them together. That is why our<br />
support for families goes to these things, our support for children. If<br />
you look at the Family Allowance Supplement or the additional family<br />
payments as it is now called, it is support for low to middle income<br />
families with children and it goes per child. So, it is about binding it<br />
together. But, you can't cavil at the change in the status of Australian<br />
women. The role and status of Australian women today is nothing to<br />
what it was 10 or 15 years ago and why shouldn't it be as it is now<br />
improved when women were disenfranchised from getting jobs in the<br />
workforce and interesting jobs and interesting lives. I mean, it was the<br />
worst kind of discrimination and I don't think repairing that<br />
discrimination means in some way disinforms the Australian<br />
Government's family policy. Whether it is the Family Allowance or the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement or the additional family payments or it is<br />
the general support for greater participation in education amongst<br />
children or it is employment in the household or it is Medicare, all<br />
these things are supportive of Australian families. I have got my<br />
opponents, John Howard is running around talking about his support<br />
for families, but he doesn't support family support. He is for families,<br />
but not family support. The Government is for family support. I think<br />
that is the key point.<br />
Let me just go to this point about fathers. I think it is terribly important<br />
for a child to keep that linkage to a father if there is a separation or a<br />
divorce. I think it is terribly important that that should happen. That<br />
that balance in the relationship should be maintained. One can never<br />
be judgemental about people and why they divorce and the fact that<br />
they can't keep their lives together, there are a lot of people who think<br />
of themselves and not their children too.<br />
CC: Yes, grandparents..<br />
PM: And I think people should think about it. There is quite a degree of<br />
selfishness in society, well listen, I'll toddle off, I'll walk out and I'll do<br />
this or I'll do that. Fine. But then the children are left behind and I<br />
think that if there is a greater commitment to children and to families<br />
and to actually working at marriages and holding them together, we<br />
would be all better off I think. Some effort and some commitment, but I </p>
<p>don't think governments can make that sort of a difference. I mean,<br />
you can ask of things of the Government by all means, but don't ask<br />
them to keep marriages together, don't ask them to keep peoples love<br />
for one another together or their concern for their children or their<br />
sense of responsibility to their children. That is something which is a<br />
community thing.<br />
a: Good morning. I would like to know and I do believe many others do, if<br />
this golden hand shake and the gold passes given to ex-Prime<br />
Ministers are subject to the same tax as what you, Christopher,<br />
mentioned just recently regarding the three seamen risked their lives.<br />
PM: Let me just say as far as I am concerned, I have long given up caring<br />
about these issues years ago, but everything that I receive, that is<br />
income, salary, allowances are all fully taxable. Now, there is a travel<br />
benefit for parliamentarians and ex-parliamentarians, but it is there so<br />
that people in positions such as my own can come to South Australia,<br />
can learn about particular things, can meet parts of society, that we<br />
are one country and it is a large country and if you rely upon the<br />
private resources of MPs to move themselves around the country, well<br />
obviously, they won't be moving very much. That is why that is there, it<br />
is not as some sort of a freebie because when most parliamentarians<br />
have been to Adelaide 20 times and Perth 20 times and Brisbane<br />
times, they are not particularly travelling around for the sport of it.<br />
They are doing it because there is a point to it. So, rest assured that<br />
all income of parliamentarians and ministers and allowances are fully<br />
taxed as everybody else is.<br />
CC: A lot of people seem to find it distressing that ex-politicians seem to,<br />
so often, even if by coincidence finish up in top overseas postings or<br />
those kind of what people call ' cushy jobs'. Maybe they are very<br />
difficult jobs and hard to fulfil, but people think they are cushy at least.<br />
PM: I don't think they are cushy and if someone has given 25 or 26 years of<br />
their life to public life or 20 years of their life, it is essentially a life<br />
given, it is the major part of ones working life given to the service of<br />
the public and they have lost the opportunity to continue a career in<br />
business or in the law or in some profession or teaching or where ever<br />
they come from. So because their specialisation is public policy,<br />
public affairs, in some cases international relations, they become first<br />
choices for some of these diplomatic appointments. But again, they<br />
are very few, they are mostly career appointments within the foreign<br />
service, mostly.<br />
CC: Well, maybe there is something there or maybe it is just one of those<br />
things that the media points out because none of us know anymore<br />
than the media tells us, really, about anything. Including our health,<br />
our future, anything and it is something that is definitely talked about a<br />
lot and it is pointed out as though it was a problem. Why should you<br />
finish up in Geneva if simply because you have done a job in the<br />
government? If you had done a job for BHP you wouldn't necessarily<br />
on retirement finish up in an overseas posting. </p>
<p>PM: No, but you would also walk away with the golden handshake, you<br />
would need the barrow out the front for.<br />
C C million dollars.<br />
PM: Walk away from the government, you don't do that. People are on<br />
salaries and they remain on salaries, they have severed all their<br />
working arrangements with the rest of society and really they do<br />
develop skills which are very useful in representational posts.<br />
CC: Well, what do you make of the things that the media does in fact pull<br />
out to put on the front page because that is all we ever get to discuss<br />
amongst ourselves is, in fact, what is put up there. Why doesn't the<br />
Government somehow have more of a public access facility attached<br />
the more people<br />
PM: ( inaudible)..<br />
CC: Yes, more people can talk more often to people like you.<br />
PM: I think one of the things about the fibre optic cable and the enormous<br />
opportunities of a digital fibre system is that it will be possible to get<br />
stacks of information from the Government about government services,<br />
about pensions, about benefits, about things the Prime Minister says,<br />
things that are in the Prime Minister's record of things said in the past,<br />
seeing what the Foreign Minister said in some place, you will be able<br />
to punch it up on the screen, all of this is going to be available. And as<br />
you said earlier, Christopher, there will be some dedicated channels<br />
also for television and what have you where you don't have to switch in<br />
and switch out of normal programming. This will make a difference,<br />
but it is a sad fact of life that the quality of broadsheets are down the<br />
bottom of the pecking order in world terms. You go abroad, you pick<br />
up whether it is the UK papers or the International Herald Tribune or<br />
any of the major internationals or the New York Times and you realise<br />
then how poorly we are being served by our broadsheets. Now,<br />
unless people travel they can't see that, but those of us who do travel<br />
can see it and you say one of the problems is we are not getting<br />
enough investment in human resources in the media, there is not<br />
enough investment by proprietors in people, journalists and there is<br />
not enough continuity or depth so it is all flim flam in the daily news,<br />
what passes for comment pieces is just poor second rate opinion or if<br />
you get in these closed markets like say South Australia has frankly<br />
one paper The Advertiser. Western Australia one. Queenlsand<br />
one. There is no choice.<br />
CC: That is something people are concerned about as well and it is another<br />
topic we could spend another hour on. But, the sorts of things that you<br />
are saying about the newspapers are the kinds of things that people<br />
are saying about Parliament and what goes in there too, is in fact that<br />
the issues are sometimes completely obscured by the ping-pong. </p>
<p>PM: By the ping-pong, that is right. That is why there is the difference<br />
between Parliament and the Government. The Government runs 24<br />
hours a day regardless of whether the House of Representatives is in<br />
session or not. That is the serious work of running the business the<br />
nation carries on and that is why those of us who have both the<br />
responsibility and the burden and some of the job of doing that focus<br />
on the issues of depth and substance. You go to Parliament so you<br />
take the flim flam questions, but this is the value of what I was talking<br />
about earlier, about radio. At least we can say these things. This<br />
wouldn't be being said in Britain or the United States<br />
CC: It certainly wouldn't be being said in some Asian countries either, we<br />
would all be in gaol now.<br />
PM: Or getting a reprimand anyway.<br />
CC: Thank you very much for your time.<br />
PM: It is a pleasure, I have enjoyed meeting you. Thank you very much<br />
indeed.<br />
