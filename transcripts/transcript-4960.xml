PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 2 ERAY17<br />
MR. HAYDEN INTERVIEWED ON INDO-CHINA SITUATION<br />
FROM ABC'S 7: 00 PM TELEVISION NEWS<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
It's quite clear that there has been a marked deterioration<br />
in the situation there. There are chilling prospects if<br />
this escalation were to get out of hand. I won't qo into<br />
the details unless you want me to. But Australians don't<br />
have to be alarmed in terms of them being directly implicated<br />
but we do have to be concerned because we do have<br />
responsibilities as part of the world brotherhood of mankind.<br />
Question: Is the Government taking the right approach, in your view?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
As far as I can judge, they are doing as much they can.<br />
Mr. Peacock is putting Australia's view wherever he can<br />
and trying to use whatever influence he has available. I regret<br />
that we haven't played a more positive and constructive<br />
role through Southeast Asia, especially in Vietnam, because<br />
if we had, we would have more clout in this situation. But I<br />
don't want to exaqgerate that just as I don't want to<br />
under-estimate the sort of influence we can exert in this<br />
sort of situation.<br />
Question: You said in Parliament that Australia didn't appear to be<br />
carrying out an even-handed policy towards Vietnam and<br />
China. Could you expand on that?<br />
Mr. Hayden:<br />
What I was pointinq out there was that in the initial<br />
comments made by the Prime Minister on this unfortunate<br />
conflict, it was reported in the newspapers that he was<br />
very heavily favouring China and almost exclusively blaminq<br />
Vietnam for the conflict. Now, I don't think it's as<br />
simple as that. I don't think it is as simple as that.<br />
I don't take sides one way or the other. There is no<br />
room for barricking in this it's too serious. I've tried<br />
to sort it out and both sides are makinq claims and<br />
counter-claims. What we've got to recognise is that Vietnam<br />
shouldn't be in Kampuchea and China shouldn't be in Vietnam;<br />
they are both wrong according to international law. We need.<br />
to, as much as we can, resolve this. 000---22 FEBRUARY 1979 </p>
