    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia will open a Consulate-General in Houston in the next 12 months in recognition of the significant two-way investment between Australia and the global energy capital.</p>
<p>Houston is the fourth largest city in the United States and home to more than 3,700 energy-related firms.</p>
<p>More than 50 Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Texas – second only to New York City – and the state exports $2.5 billion worth of goods to Australia.</p>
<p>Houston is the centre of Australian oil and gas investment in the United States. More than 100 Australian companies operate in Texas, including BHP Billiton – the largest foreign investor in US shale, Woodside, Santos, WorleyParsons, Macquarie Group, Pryme Oil and Gas, Lend Lease and Brambles.</p>
<p>Establishing a permanent Australian Government presence in Houston will allow Australia to maximise the two-way trade and investment opportunities of the US energy revolution.</p>
<p>Texas would be the world’s 13th largest economy in its own right and there are extensive opportunities to deepen defence, cultural and academic ties with Australia.</p>
<p>The Joint Strike fighter is produced at the Lockheed facilities in Dallas; the vibrant arts sector will be a natural partner for Australia’s cultural institutions; and there are already strong research ties between Australian and Texan academic institutions.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of Ms Nana Booker AM, Australia’s Honorary Consul for Texas for more than 14 years.</p>
<p>The opening of a Consulate-General in Houston is testament to the opportunities created by Ms Booker’s tireless efforts on behalf of Australia.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will visit the Texas Medical Centre, the world’s largest medical complex, to promote the exchange of research ties as the Australian Government sets up the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund.</p>
<p>The Texas Medical Centre is home to cutting edge cancer research and already has a close association with the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I look forward to the Consulate-General playing an important role in facilitating further trade and investment opportunities between Texas and Australia.</p>
