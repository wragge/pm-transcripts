    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>1 September 1986 </strong></p>
<p>It is with deep regret that I note the death on Saturday August 1986 of the Honourable Dame Annabelle Rankin, DBE, who over a period of many years served the people of Australia with great distinction.</p>
<p>Dame Annabelle was the first Queensland woman to enter the Federal Parliament, being a Senator for Queensland from 1946 until 1971. She was opposition Whip from 1947-49 and Government Whip from 1951-1966. She was Minister of Housing from 1966-1971.</p>
<p>On retiring from the Senate in 1971 Dame Annabelle was appointed as Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand, a position she held until 1974.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government I express our deepest sympathy to Dame Annabelle's next-of-kin.</p>
<p>A State Funeral Service will be held at 11.00am, Thursday 4 September 1986, at St John's Cathedral, Brisbane.</p>
