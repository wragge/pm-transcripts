7 March 1997 ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
TO ROTARY CLUB OF AUSTRALIA<br />
e o e<br />
Thank you very much Tony, to Malcolm, and to all the other very distinguished office<br />
bearers of the Rotary Club of North Sydney and all the other members of Rotary,<br />
bother here in Australia and around the world and can I say how very touched I am by<br />
this award. Those symbolic gestures in life a always in a sense more rewarding and<br />
have a lot more meaning than more material gestures. And to be recognised in this<br />
honouring way I am not a rotarian, although I have attended so many Rotary<br />
functions in my life as all of my Parliamentary colleagues present here, and I<br />
acknowledge their presence particularly Joe Hockey and Gillian Skinner who are the<br />
two local members for this area, federally and State. I feel as though I know and<br />
understand Rotary extremely well and I take the opportunity as Prime Minister to<br />
acknowledge the tremendous contribution that Rotary makes towards building a better<br />
Australia and building a happier more cooperative world.<br />
We'd never be able to keep Australia going without the help of literally hundreds of<br />
thousands, if not millions of Australians who volunteer their time and their energy and<br />
their effort to doing those things that no government, whatever its attitude may be, no<br />
government can ever do. Australia has a tremendous tradition of volunteerism. Being<br />
a volunteer and getting out and helping people in an unsung, very very selfless fashion<br />
has always been an important characteristic of being an Australian. We're very good<br />
at it, and although of course as you all know the Rotary movement started in the<br />
United States. The natural appeal of Rotary to Australians was very understandable.<br />
And the way in which so many Australians joined Rotary and through the years have<br />
cooperated in the local efforts of Rotary, have involved themselves in the international<br />
exchanges, the encouragement to community involvement and community self-help,<br />
the building of an understanding of what good citizenship is all about. The nurturing<br />
of the notion that our society is really a lot about mutual obligations. We have mutual<br />
obligations each to the other. We have rights but we also have responsibilities. As a<br />
society we also have an obligation to look after those within our midst who are less<br />
fortunate than we are and from time to time we have a right to say to people who are<br />
assisted that it's part of the mutual obligation of being a member of the Australian<br />
community that something is done in return for the effort that is extended to help them.<br />
And Rotary has been very much part of this and in the process hundreds of thousands<br />
of Australians have found a great deal of personal satisfaction in involving themselves </p>
<p>in the affairs of Rotary, in raising fuinds to help needy causes, in promoting very<br />
importantly international understanding. And I was reflecting as I drove here tonight<br />
from Gladesville just how many people, how many young people I know, including<br />
members of my extended family who have been the recipients of those great<br />
international student rotary exchanges which are one of the great ways in which young<br />
people have learned about other countries and the understanding that is so important,<br />
particularly in a world where communications and the globalisation of the world<br />
economy has demolished and removed the differences that used to exist.<br />
So in many ways Rotary is owed a great debt of gratitude by the Australian<br />
community, and I want on behalf of the Government to express my personal gratitude<br />
to all of those rotarians in Australia who over the years have done so much to build<br />
and nurture the spirit of Rotary and have made such a magnificent contribution to<br />
improving understanding here in Australia and for making it between peoples and<br />
between nations.<br />
I am very touched by the honour that you have paid me tonight. I do feel a quiet pride<br />
in the fact that it was possible in the wake of that awful tragedy to seize the<br />
opportunity and the moment to do something very positive to change at least in one<br />
area for all time the direction of our society.<br />
It was a very interesting as well as a very challenging exercise, and may I acknowledge<br />
thle assistance I received from both sides of politics; from the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
Mr Beazley; the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot; from the NSW<br />
Labor Premier Mr Carr; from Peter Collins, the Leader of the Opposition here in NSW<br />
and all of the other state Premiers. And I particularly acknowledge the contribution<br />
that was made by my deputy and the Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer whose<br />
constituency found the adjustment process more difficult for reasons I hope you all<br />
understand. If you were an urban Liberal Member or an urban Labor Member it was a<br />
little easier to put your hand up for gun control laws than if you were a rural member<br />
and I think that should be acknowledged and in that context I also especially<br />
acknowledge the leadership role taken and displayed by the Premier of Queensland, Mr<br />
Rob Borbidge.<br />
It was one of those occasions when a community wanted something done and a<br />
community wanted something done very decisively and those who hold public office in<br />
this country are often criticised for failing to match the moment or failing to seize the<br />
occasion. I think on this occasion the elected representatives of the Australian<br />
community whatever their politics overwhelmingly did the right thing by the Australian<br />
community and the significance of the event cannot be underestimated. I never<br />
accepted the inevitability that Australia should go down the American path so far as<br />
personal violence, particularly gun violence was concerned. I am a great admirer of<br />
many things American. That country has contributed enormously to the stability of the<br />
world and contributed enormously to the way of life that people in, what is loosely<br />
called the western world, enjoy. Like any other country which is a role model in some<br />
areas, it is not in other areas and the pattern of urban violence, the number of deaths<br />
from gunshot wounds in that country. The systemic violence that is found in so many<br />
parts of the United States is something that I certainly wanted to do all in my power to<br />
stop spreading to this country and I think in a small way what the governments and the </p>
<p>political parties of Australia were able to achieve in the wake of the Port Arthur<br />
disaster in a small way we have made a contribution to building a safer Australian<br />
community and what impressed me was the reaction across the board of people to<br />
what was done. I had people coming up to me in the streets and saying I didn't vote<br />
for you last time and I never will vote for you but I do agree with what you did in<br />
relation to gun control.<br />
I remember going to a test match, it was a Rugby Union test match between Australia<br />
and South Africa at the Sydney Sports Stadium in June of last year and I was invited<br />
onto the field to meet the teams and I was still in the infancy of my Prime Ministership<br />
so I didn't get boo-ed. It is a great Australian tradition after you've been in office for<br />
a couple of years to get boo-ed when you go onto the field. And I met the team, and I<br />
was very interested in the reaction of the crowd because the gun control issue was still<br />
raging very strongly and I was interested in the reaction of the crowd and the number<br />
of people who called out " hold the line on gun control laws" and afterwards at the<br />
reception, interestingly enough two or three members of the South African football<br />
team spoke to me about it because that is a country that is wracked by an enormous<br />
amount of violence and has tragically enough a murder rate that is amongst one of the<br />
worst in the world, and so it was a very interesting experience and it did remind and it<br />
did remind I think all of those who were involved in it of the capacity of people in<br />
public life if they act in concert and they act out a sense of commitment to the common<br />
good that you can achieve things, you can change directions and you can give to the<br />
community a sense of reassurance and I think it is particularly important and in a sense<br />
symbolic that this award and this event should take place on the eve of the<br />
international day for women which is tomorrow because amongst the strongest<br />
expressions of support that I received for what I did and what my government did was<br />
fromn women in Australia including a very large number of women who lived in rural<br />
Australia and the number of women.... Security from violence is a very important<br />
thing to all of us and it is a particularly important thing to women and to children and if<br />
we've made a small contribution to building a safer and more congenial and beckoning<br />
and more reassuring and dare I say it more relaxed and comfortable Australian<br />
community as a result of that then I am very very grateful indeed.<br />
But finally can I say that it wouldn't have been possible for us to have achieved what<br />
was achieved without the goodwill and the cooperation of other people in public life.<br />
It wasn't just achieved by me alone and I again acknowledge the contribution of others<br />
including people who are normally my political opponents.<br />
But to you gentlemen of the North Sydney Rotary Club and of the broader Rotary<br />
movement, again my very warm thanks both for the contribution that your magnificent<br />
organisation makes to the people of Australia and the Australian community and most<br />
especially for the personal compliment that you have paid me and the honour that you<br />
have done me tonight, I treasure it greatly and I regard it as a very special honour<br />
indeed. Thank you. </p>
