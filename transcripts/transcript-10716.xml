    <content><![CDATA[<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Day 13 of the wharf dispute and the Prime Minister, John Howard,</p>
<p>   says that the future of this country is being decided on the wharves</p>
<p>   now. It all goes back to the court today. The Federal Court prepares</p>
<p>   to hand down its decision on whether to reinstate the 1400 sacked</p>
<p>   Patrick Stevedore workers. The Prime Minister is on the line. Sir,</p>
<p>   good morning, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Jeremy, very nice to be with you again.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Do you have any sense of, I don't know, foreboding? How is</p>
<p>   the fight going in your opinion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a very important issue. It's about whether</p>
<p>   Australia will have a competitive waterfront in the future that</p>
<p>   will enable us to sell more abroad, employ more Australians at home</p>
<p>   and survive in a very difficult world trading environment. Perhaps</p>
<p>   one of the economic reports that came out this morning put its finger</p>
<p>   on what this is all about and that was a report from Access Economics.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, I saw it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Which said that Australia is now living in one of the most hostile</p>
<p>   international trading environments it's ever faced. Now what</p>
<p>   that means, in very simple terms is, that in order to survive in</p>
<p>   that hostile environment, Australia has to get everything right</p>
<p>   at home. Everything right at home. It means low interest rates.</p>
<p>   It means low inflation. It means a reformed taxation system, and</p>
<p>   it also means, very importantly, having a competitive waterfront.</p>
<p>   And there can't be any ifs, buts and maybes. And when you put</p>
<p>   all the sound and fury and noise and rhetoric and dust of the last</p>
<p>   few days aside, one thing stands absolutely unshaken, and that is</p>
<p>   the economic imperative of this country having an efficient waterfront.</p>
<p>   If we are to survive in that hostile world trading environment,</p>
<p>   if we are to sell what we need to survive, we've got to have</p>
<p>   an efficient waterfront. And manifestly we have not had so for the</p>
<p>   last 50 years.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You know they are talking about a divided country and they are</p>
<p>   calling on you to come in somehow and wave a wand and bring everybody</p>
<p>   together. But are you surprised that when you describe that big</p>
<p>   picture, I mean to me it is so simple and clear.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is what, may I say, the man and woman in the street sees</p>
<p>   it as. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Are you sure of that though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am. I don't believe the country is divided. I think</p>
<p>   there's, and it suits my critics, and it suits the critics</p>
<p>   of the Government and it suits the MUA's cause to say oh, shock,</p>
<p>   horror, everybody is at everybody's throats, it's divided,</p>
<p>   let's have another meeting. I mean we have been having meetings</p>
<p>   for years and years and years about the waterfront. The Hawke Government</p>
<p>   had meetings. The Prime Minister brought the pizzas into the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government centre in Sydney for 48 hours at meetings. What did that</p>
<p>   produce? It produced the expenditure of $420 million and no real</p>
<p>   improvement in the waterfront. We still have a crane rate of 18</p>
<p>   an hour versus that of 30 an hour from our Asian competitors. We</p>
<p>   still have rorts, we still have overmanning to the tune of 50 per</p>
<p>   cent. We still have a situation where you are dealing with people</p>
<p>   who are paid $74,000 to $80,000 a year, which is double the average</p>
<p>   wage of the people who are listening to this interview. So unless</p>
<p>   that sort of thing is stopped, unless that is changed, unless we</p>
<p>   get a productive waterfront. I have no objection to waterfront,</p>
<p>   waterside workers earning $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 even</p>
<p>   more, provided they are productive. Let me make it clear it is not</p>
<p>   about salary levels. It is about the level of the salary compared</p>
<p>   with the output.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>They talked about Australia getting up there to world's best</p>
<p>   practice. I can't see for the life of me why we can't</p>
<p>   be ahead of world's best practice. Why can't we, in fact,</p>
<p>   lead the world. It is only a question of saying well here is the</p>
<p>   most important thing for Australia, we must have the most, not just</p>
<p>   equal competitive that's on the wharves, but we must be the</p>
<p>   best.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course, and what the message that comes out of that Access</p>
<p>   Economics report clearly states is that unless we make ourselves</p>
<p>   not only equal to the best but ahead of the best operating at the</p>
<p>   present time, we are not going to get a reasonable share of markets</p>
<p>   in a very hostile trading environment. I mean I can't emphasise</p>
<p>   that too strongly. This is about our economic future, it is not</p>
<p>   about the right of people to belong to a union, that is not at issue.</p>
<p>   We guarantee the right of people to belong to a union if they want</p>
<p>   to, we are the first Government at a Federal level to bring in legislation</p>
<p>   totally outlawing discrimination as to whether or not a person is</p>
<p>   a member or not of a trade union. This is about whether we are to</p>
<p>   have a world class, world efficient waterfront that will underpin</p>
<p>   the behaviour of our exporters. Now we have at the moment a threat</p>
<p>   to our farmers, we have an American union outfit threatening retaliation</p>
<p>   against the farm produce of Australia's hardworking farmers,</p>
<p>   most of whom haven't seen in their lifetime $70,000 or $80,000</p>
<p>   a year income and are now facing, they are now facing the indignity</p>
<p>   and the humiliation and the further frustration of an international</p>
<p>   union of conspiracy to hit them and I think that is the ultimate</p>
<p>   in betrayal of the national interest. I mean if ever there is a</p>
<p>   group of people in Australia who deserve our understanding and our</p>
<p>   sympathy, it is the farmers of Australia and now as a spin-off from</p>
<p>   this dispute, you're having unions overseas, and we are invited</p>
<p>   to believe that they have had no encouragement at all from John</p>
<p>   Coombs and his friends, and I think most Australians will find that</p>
<p>   unbelievable, that these unions are now collaborating and conspiring</p>
<p>   to damage the economic interest of Australia.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well the ACCC say that they are going to come down heavily on the....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hope the full rigour of the law is used to support Australia's</p>
<p>   farmers and I want to make the point that the law here is being</p>
<p>   defied in a number of respects. The law is being defied at the moment</p>
<p>   in ports in Melbourne and in Sydney where you've got Supreme</p>
<p>   Court orders and those orders are being defied by the MUA and their</p>
<p>   friends, and they are being encouraged to defy those orders by Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley and by the Premier of New South Wales. I mean our view is</p>
<p>   that no matter who's involved, they have to obey the law and</p>
<p>   that applies to Patrick's, it applies to the unions, it applies</p>
<p>   to me, it applies to you. But at the moment as we speak you have</p>
<p>   a situation where the unions are defying the law and they are being</p>
<p>   encouraged in that defiance by the Leader of the Opposition and</p>
<p>   by the Premier of New South Wales.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Do you have any power to make sure that the police do, in fact,</p>
<p>   do their job in New South Wales. Can you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In our kind of democracy the responsibility of enforcing the domestic</p>
<p>   law of Australia is in the hands of the police. That's the</p>
<p>   way our system operates. Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Clearly in New South Wales, they've taken a very, very lenient</p>
<p>   line?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there is no doubt that the New South Wales Government is encouraging</p>
<p>   defiance of the law in that State.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Are you doing something about that Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm pointing it out, but bear in mind that the way our</p>
<p>   country is structured, it is the responsibility of the police to</p>
<p>   ensure that the law is not continuously defied and it is therefore</p>
<p>   very much the responsibility of State Government. Now what is being</p>
<p>   defied in Victoria, for example, is an order of the Supreme Court</p>
<p>   of Victoria, obtained, as I understand it, by the Victorian Port</p>
<p>   Authority and that is an agency of the Victorian Government. So</p>
<p>   you have a situation where there you have a State law being defied,</p>
<p>   you have an injunction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales being</p>
<p>   defied in New South Wales and you have this sort of fiction that</p>
<p>   in some way, well of course, it was directed against the MUA and</p>
<p>   because other people are involved they don't have to comply</p>
<p>   with it. I mean it beggars belief to us, the Australian public,</p>
<p>   to accept that the MUA is not right in the heart of the defiance</p>
<p>   that is now taking place in New South Wales, but they obviously</p>
<p>   don't feel that any kind of risk in that State because the</p>
<p>   Premier of New South Wales has gone down to the wharves in New South</p>
<p>   Wales and has cheered them on and has encouraged them in that defiance.</p>
<p>   Now whatever your views are, it is absolutely irresponsible of any</p>
<p>   political leader, in or out of Government, to encourage defiance</p>
<p>   of the law. I mean Patricks boss said on television last night that</p>
<p>   he would, subject to his right of appeal, of which any person has,</p>
<p>   he would abide by any orders of the courts. John Coombs didn't</p>
<p>   say that, Jennie George didn't say that, Kim Beazley hasn't</p>
<p>   said that, and Bob Carr hasn't said that.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But what in the end do you do if you can't get the things</p>
<p>   on and off the wharf and they obey the law selectively. As I said,</p>
<p>   I think when this whole thing was just beginning on the horizon,</p>
<p>   when you were in the studio the last time we spoke, I said well,</p>
<p>   why not do a Bob Hawke? Why not send in the army?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is not the job of the Australian army to enforce the civil law</p>
<p>   of Australia. That is the job of the police. The job of the army</p>
<p>   is not to enforce the civil law.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But at what point would you say, I, in the interests of this country</p>
<p>   must do something to open the wharves and keep them open. There</p>
<p>   must be a point.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It goes without saying that issue is under constant surveillance</p>
<p>   and it is the responsibility of the State governments and of the</p>
<p>   State police to prevent unlawful obstructions of people going about</p>
<p>   their lawful business. I mean, nobody is disputing the right of</p>
<p>   members of trade unions to engage in peaceful demonstrations, to</p>
<p>   engage in lawful, peaceful pickets. Nobody is disputing their right</p>
<p>   to do that but I do dispute their right to stop people going about</p>
<p>   their business and if a company has cargo which has been landed</p>
<p>   at a wharf and the customers of that company are crying out for</p>
<p>   that cargo and in some cases, when the cargo is medical supplies,</p>
<p>   the customers are patients who desperately need those medical supplies,</p>
<p>   perhaps for pain relief, it is plainly unlawful, wrong and against</p>
<p>   everything that this country believes in for the free flow of that</p>
<p>   cargo and the passage of those goods out of the wharves to be impeded.</p>
<p>Now I am not denying the right of the unions to demonstrate their</p>
<p>   point of view. They can demonstrate it as vigorously as they like.</p>
<p>   That is their democratic right but they have no right, according</p>
<p>   to ordinary principles of Australian justice or an ordinary understanding</p>
<p>   of a fair go, they had no right to impede other people's business,</p>
<p>   nor had they the right to stop other workers going about their lawful</p>
<p>   business. That is what is happening right at the moment and it is</p>
<p>   conduct which is being condoned by the Leader of the Federal Opposition,</p>
<p>   it is being condoned by the leadership of the ACTU and it is being</p>
<p>   condoned by the New South Wales Premier. Now the responsibility</p>
<p>   for enforcing the law rests with the police and with the State governments.</p>
<p>   They are State laws in the main that are being defied and breached</p>
<p>   and the civilian authority which has the responsibility to enforce</p>
<p>   the law of course are the police forces of the various States.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>What happens if Justice Tony North, who is very familiar with this</p>
<p>   area of activity, finds in favour of the wharfies and the 1400 sacked</p>
<p>   Patrick workers are told to go back. What happens then?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Whatever decision is made by the courts, the people have to abide</p>
<p>   by it. I can't say to one group in the community, you abide</p>
<p>   by the law, and to another group, you don't. I mean, that is</p>
<p>   what Mr Beazley is doing.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But you're not going to get another opportunity to .... about</p>
<p>   the reform...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If I could just finish. I think it is fair to say that as this</p>
<p>   dispute, this issue goes on, you are going to have a lot of court</p>
<p>   action and you are going to have some wins and losses on both sides.</p>
<p>   I would imagine that whatever the outcome of Mr Justice North's</p>
<p>   deliberations there would be an appeal and there will be, and I</p>
<p>   will hope that appeal were resolved quite speedily. It's a</p>
<p>   very important issue but...</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Just give me an idea of how firm you are on this?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. I mean, we are absolutely committed to having a reformed,</p>
<p>   revitalised, more efficient Australian waterfront and it's</p>
<p>   not because I am trying to destroy the MUA. I don't mind if</p>
<p>   the MUA continues and flourishes. I do want to end the MUA's</p>
<p>   monopoly and our changes to the Industrial Relations Act with the</p>
<p>   help of Cheryl Kernot made that possible. But my objective is to</p>
<p>   have a more competitive Australian waterfront because that will</p>
<p>   deliver more Australian jobs, attract more investment, and boost</p>
<p>   Australian exports in a very hostile, international trading environment.</p>
<p>   So we are very strongly committed. Our resolve is firm. We don't</p>
<p>   pretend it is easy and I never thought it would be easy but it is</p>
<p>   in the long term interests of all Australians to have a more competitive</p>
<p>   waterfront and when all the noise and dust and rhetoric dies away,</p>
<p>   that issue still remains, and that is unless we can lift ourselves</p>
<p>   not only to world's best practice but as you rightly say, beyond</p>
<p>   it, we do not have a hope of surviving effectively in a very hostile</p>
<p>   world trading environment. It makes me feel literally sick to think</p>
<p>   that people, any Australian would be contemplating giving any support</p>
<p>   of any kind to some kind of international boycott of Australian</p>
<p>   farm produce.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well if we want more employment, the way to get it is to get an</p>
<p>   absolutely super efficient waterfront. The benefits of that flow</p>
<p>   on to absolutely every occupation.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are a nation that needs to trade to survive. We have seen this</p>
<p>   huge downturn in Asia. Because of the domestic strength of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy, we have largely protected ourselves against it but nonetheless,</p>
<p>   we are in a much tougher international trading environment than</p>
<p>   ever before. That's the point of the Access survey that came</p>
<p>   out this morning. What is the response of the trade union movement?</p>
<p>   Virtually to applaud the very thought that there is going to be</p>
<p>   some kind of international search- and-destroy mission conducted</p>
<p>   against Australia's farmers.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we will move onto other things. Just quickly, one</p>
<p>   of the considerations or one of the concerns over the weekend, seems</p>
<p>   to be the way in which Patrick's manoeuvred the corporate structure.</p>
<p>   Now, does it concern you that some unscrupulous employer may, or</p>
<p>   for totally dishonourable and unreasonable reasons, employ the same</p>
<p>   sort of practice or manoeuvre?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would never pretend that every employer in Australia is a paragon</p>
<p>   of virtue any more than I assert that every employee is. As far</p>
<p>   as I am concerned, I am totally opposed to sharp practices by employers</p>
<p>   just as I am opposed to militant tactics by trade unionists.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you say that the Patrick's manoeuvre was a sharp practice?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If people believe it is, I mean, I have not had any evidence presented</p>
<p>   to me to suggest that it is, no. But I don't pretend to know</p>
<p>   everything about what a company does. I do know this, that for three</p>
<p>   years, for three years before these events unfolded, Patrick's had</p>
<p>   been endeavouring to get the Maritime Union of Australia to honour</p>
<p>   a number of arrangements and agreements that had been approved by</p>
<p>   Mr Coombs, the Federal Secretary of the Union, after lengthy negotiation</p>
<p>   with Patrick's. They have been trying for three years. I mean, this</p>
<p>   idea that somehow or other the answer to the problem is to have</p>
<p>   another meeting completely ignores the fact that the union and Patrick's</p>
<p>   have been having meetings for years.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>They should remember what Laurie Brereton said about the sale of</p>
<p>   ANL, that you couldn't give it away and the result of that</p>
<p>   was, I would think, the union ....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course. Everyone knows that the former Labor Government wanted</p>
<p>   to sell ANL and in the end they didn't because Bill Kelty said</p>
<p>   they couldn't. Mr Beazley comes along and he says, the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister should call a meeting of all of the parties. I mean that</p>
<p>   is just singing the song of the MUA. The MUA has been meeting Patrick's</p>
<p>   for three years and Patrick's has been saying to them again and</p>
<p>   again and again, in those discussions, and ultimately to the whole</p>
<p>   workforce, has been saying, look, unless we can lift the productivity</p>
<p>   of this outfit, unless you deliver your side of the bargain, unless</p>
<p>   in return for the wage increases that we have delivered and the</p>
<p>   improvements in conditions, you bring about an end to the work practices,</p>
<p>   the company is going to go on losing money. According to Mr Corrigan</p>
<p>   it has lost $56 million over a period of years. Now no company can</p>
<p>   go on losing that. </p>
<p>I mean, that money ultimately comes from individual Australians.</p>
<p>   It doesn't materialise out of thin, corporate air. It comes</p>
<p>   ultimately from other Australians. If it is borrowed from a bank,</p>
<p>   it comes from the funds of the banks' lenders or depositors.</p>
<p>   I mean, you are dealing here with black and white assets and you</p>
<p>   are dealing here with a situation that no company can be expected</p>
<p>   after years and years of negotiations just to put up with it indefinitely</p>
<p>   because they don't have bottomless pits for pockets.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister the question that was asked of me, and I think it</p>
<p>   is a damn good one, we talk about there being voluntary unionism</p>
<p>   in this country, and nobody is allowed to do the no-ticket-no-start</p>
<p>   routine, yet it was pointed out to me, you can't go to university.</p>
<p>   You have to be a member of the students union if you want to go</p>
<p>   to university.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have a policy at a federal level of endeavouring to outlaw</p>
<p>   that but because universities are under state law we don't</p>
<p>   have direct say in it unless we start using the financial route</p>
<p>   in order to bring that about and there are a lot of short comings</p>
<p>   about that which don't make it very attractive.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But it's wrong, isn't it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's wrong in principle and there are some State/Coalition</p>
<p>   Governments, I think the West Australian Government is a good example,</p>
<p>   that has taken action to change it and I applaud the Western Australian</p>
<p>   Government for what it has done in that respect but it is quite</p>
<p>   wrong in principle, yes.</p>
<p> CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, later on today I understand you will be making an</p>
<p>   announcement about additional funding for Medicare offices. We already</p>
<p>   know that Medicare offices, it was announced last week, it's</p>
<p>   going to be a sort of one stop shop. You are allocating extra funding,</p>
<p>   I understand?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, Dr Wooldridge will be announcing a very significant expansion</p>
<p>   of the Medicare easyclaim system. Now this is a self-service claiming</p>
<p>   procedure which has been installed in hundreds of pharmacies throughout</p>
<p>   Australia as an alternative to a Medicare office. It's largely</p>
<p>   been installed to date in rural and regional areas but in 1996...</p>
<p>   1997 there was some also put into outer metropolitan areas but we've</p>
<p>   now decided to invest a further $10 million and then we are going</p>
<p>   to open another 200 Medicare Easyclaim self-service facilities in</p>
<p>   the local pharmacies and Dr Wooldridge will be announcing details</p>
<p>   about locations etc. And that will bring to a total of 600, which</p>
<p>   is a very large number, of these facilities throughout Australia</p>
<p>   and they are very cheap and effective. They mean that within, although</p>
<p>   you can't pick up a cheque at the pharmacy, you can within</p>
<p>   a period of days get a cheque in the mail or have a deposit made</p>
<p>   to your bank account. </p>
<p>Now you can imagine that with a facility like this, you can have</p>
<p>   a lot more of them because they are not very expensive to establish.</p>
<p>   We have found it necessary in some of the major population areas</p>
<p>   in the city to rationalise the existing Medicare offices. Now these</p>
<p>   will become a major substitute but more importantly, in many areas</p>
<p>   of Australia, in the regional and rural areas of Australia that</p>
<p>   have never seen a Medicare office, this will give them a Medicare</p>
<p>   facility which is almost as good as a Medicare office in areas of</p>
<p>   Australia that have never, ever seen them. I think it will be a</p>
<p>   move that is very welcome. It will bring to 600, and there will</p>
<p>   be another 200 within that 600 figure, attributable to the announcement</p>
<p>   of another $10 million programme. And when you add that to the announcement</p>
<p>   that Dr Wooldridge made last week whereby people can simultaneously</p>
<p>   claim at either a Medicare office or the office of a private health</p>
<p>   insurance fund for their total claims, in other words both their</p>
