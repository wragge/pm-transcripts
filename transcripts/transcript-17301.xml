    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister is a strong advocate of APEC, and fully supports its leaders meetings.</p>
<p>The leaders meeting has been essential to delivering APEC's goals, and continues to be a key annual event in the region.</p>
<p>APEC has an enviable and long standing record of forging prosperity and security through its focus on free and open trade and investment.</p>
<p>It continues to play a pivotal role in the Asia-Pacific region, including supporting the region's recovery from the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>The Australian Government warmly welcomes proposals by ASEAN to more deeply engage the United States and Russia; but those proposals have no implications for the future or structure of APEC.</p>
