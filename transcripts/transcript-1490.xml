COIME RCE IN HONOUR OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, IiR. HIAOLD HOLT<br />
CHIRISTCIJIURCH, NE7 ZEALAND 4TH FEBRUARY, 1967<br />
Text of Speech by Mr. R. E. Smith, President of Chamber<br />
The Right Honourable the Prime Minister of New Zealand,<br />
the Right Honourable the Prime Minister of Australia Your Jorship<br />
the Mayor, Your Excellencies, our Distinguished Juests, and Ladies<br />
and Jentlemen: Eight years ago the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce<br />
celebrated its 100th Birthday. Over the history of our existence<br />
we have entertained many distinguished guests, and amongst us this<br />
evening are a numoer whom we would be happy to receive as guests<br />
in their own right our own Prime Minister, Mr. D. McNicol,<br />
Australian High Commissioner in INew Zealand, Ir. J. L. Hazlett<br />
New Zealand's High Comrmissioner in Australia, Sir .' iark Oliphant,<br />
a very distinguished Australian scientist, Mir. R. Maddres President<br />
of the Nlew Zealand Manufacturers Federation, and we have five<br />
Presidents of Chambers of Commerce from other parts of the South<br />
Island. To these and our other Distinguished ruests might I offer<br />
a very sincere welcome. e are glad to have you with us. But never<br />
before throughout our histor have we had the honour and privilege<br />
which we have this evenin o' welcomilb as our guest the rine<br />
Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia. On oehalf of our members<br />
and our Distinguished Juests, may I, Sir, offer to you and to Mrs.<br />
Holt our greeting, our respect, and our warm good fellowship.<br />
Australia had a birthday recently. It was its 179th<br />
Birthday and never before today has a Prime Minister of Australia<br />
visited the South Island of New Zealand. Consequently I have been<br />
authorised to officially welcome the Prime . linister and Mrs. Holt<br />
on behalf of the independent peoples of the South Island. Perhaps<br />
I should explain that I use the word " independent" in its<br />
descriptive and not its political sense. To mark the occasion I<br />
have been reouested to present you with a Certificate given under<br />
the Cla of the ' reat Moa which says: " i'hereas Harold Holt,<br />
having been born in all innocence beyond these southern shores,<br />
is nevertheless now, recognising that he is geo: raphically underprivileged,<br />
granted full status as an Honorary South Islander, with<br />
all the rights and purtenances that go with it." Perhaps I could<br />
extend our welcome a little further. I : ould welcome you as the<br />
Chief Minister of a member of a family of nations, the family of<br />
nations we belong to, and, like any other family, it has its varied<br />
personalities. One of our Scottish cousins was reported recently<br />
as saying that New Zealand should realise it is a big boy now and<br />
someone should prise its hands from its mother's apron strings.<br />
e11, it is true that families' interests vary as time progresses,<br />
but we also have to admit that mother, to use this description, has<br />
her own problems at the moment. Within this family I think it is<br />
generally and correctly acknowledged that Australia and New Zealand<br />
are brothers, and it is a fact that brothers, particularly if one is<br />
bi ger than another, tend to have separate and competing interests,<br />
but eventually I think they realise that there is a great deal to<br />
be gained by joint co-operation. Sometimes it takes a family crisis<br />
to oring this about. It's true, too, that brothers sometimes even<br />
speak different languages, like Strine and New Zealand.<br />
The Canterbury Chamber of Commerce is keenly aware of the<br />
part that it must play in this changing world, and as evidence of<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
this I would like to present to you, Sir, a survey of Christchurch<br />
and its farming environs which was initiated by this Chamber,<br />
financed and puolished with the joint co-operation of four<br />
organisations representing the businessmen, including farmers,<br />
of this Province, and prepared, you will be interested to note,<br />
Sir, by a leading firm of Consultants from Australia. believe,<br />
Sir that survey demonstrates the potentials and the advantages<br />
of this area that we know exist. . ie are cognisant, too Sir, that<br />
as outposts in the South lacific, Australia and New Zealand must<br />
have a closer association with their relations in the Pacific area,<br />
and particularly in South East Asia or, as I refer to call it,<br />
the near North. are -lad, Sir, that you and our own Prime<br />
Minister are aware, in the words of one of our local churchmen,<br />
the Reverend Allan Brash, th: t our children have a western heritage:<br />
and this is their ood fortune: they also h. ve an Asian future:<br />
this is their challen'e. This is a time of change and challenge,<br />
and we know that you save very great responsibilities. , e<br />
conrratulate you, Sir, on the qualities of leadership which you have<br />
amply displayed. ,7e oelieve that you have earned this period of<br />
rest amongst the peace and the ueauty of our mountains and lakes,<br />
but we are confident that you will return. Gentlemen and Ladies,<br />
would you please demonstrate the warmth of your welcome.<br />
( Acclamation.) </p>
