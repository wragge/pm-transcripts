FOR PRESS: PM io. 25/ 1971<br />
VICTORIAN FLOODS<br />
Stateme, t by the Prime Minister, Mr_ John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had replied to<br />
the Victorian Premier's request for Commonwealth financial assistance<br />
with relief and rest oration measures made necessary by the recent<br />
floods in that State.<br />
The Commonwealth Government, being naturally concerned<br />
at the extent of the floods and sympathetic to those afected, has already<br />
offered to join with the State, on a dollar for dollar basis, in financing<br />
schemes for the relief of personal hardship and distress in the affected<br />
areas. As to other relief or restoration measures, it is established<br />
Commonwealth policy that the financing of these is primarily the<br />
responsibility of State Governments. However, where the disaster is on such<br />
a scale that very large expenditures are required, the Commonwealth is<br />
normally prepared to assist.<br />
The Premier has been informed that the Commonwealth is<br />
prepared to meet all natural disaster relief expenditure ( other than the<br />
State's share of expenditure on relief of personal hardship and distress)<br />
on eligible relief measures in excess of 5 million in 1970-71. Assistance<br />
is thus being offered on a similar basis to that for Hew South Wales where<br />
the Commonwealth has offered to meet all natural disaster relief expenditure<br />
in excess of $ 5 million in 1970-71.<br />
