<p>E&amp;OEâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>â¦ the Ministerâs announcement today. Prime Minister, whatâs your response?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he came to see me this morning and said heâd decided that irrespective of what the Solicitor General might say, he wanted in the interests of the Government to pay the amount. And heâs behaved in a commendable fashion in doing that and I think people appreciate that he put aside any personal considerations. He doesnât know what is in the Solicitor Generalâs opinion, I donât either. Iâll still be interested to see what the Solicitor General has to say. He may conclude that there was a civil liability, he may conclude there wasnât. But irrespective of that Mr Reith has decided in the interests of the Government to bring the matter to finality by making a payment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What does that announcement mean for his future on the front bench as far as youâre concerned?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Mr Reith retains my full confidence.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you regard this as an admission of liability?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I donât. I regard this as the action of a man whoâs put the interests of the Government ahead of his own.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he receive advice from you this morning about what he should do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He reached his own decision. He reached his own decision and he came to see me and he said that he was going to do it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you believe he did the right thing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>$50,000 is a lot of money. You donât think that means heâs accepting blame?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well blame doesnât go according to amount. Well it doesnât. Thatâs not logical. Blame does not follow amount. It follows the circumstances. And youâve heard his case. He was not informed of the details. Heâs gone over all of that. I think people are familiar with the detail but heâs taken a decision and heâs put the interests of the Government ahead of his own. So that is commendable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that public pressure also prompt him to take this action? Should it have got to this pointâ¦?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, Iâm not going to conduct a seminar on the last few days. Heâs made a decision, his own decision. Heâs announced it. Thank you.</p>
