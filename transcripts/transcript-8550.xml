ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF WASTE MINIMISATION AND RECYCLING STRATEGY, DARLING<br />
HARBOUR, SYDNEY 22 JUNE 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The Government's Waste Minimisation and Recycling Strategy is<br />
more than it seems.<br />
This environment strategy is also an industrial strategy, and<br />
a social strategy.<br />
In this way it goes to the heart of some of the key questions<br />
facing Australia today.<br />
For instance, it is concerned with industrial modernity and<br />
efficiency. It will play a part In determining how<br />
significant our role will be in the modern world.<br />
Increasingly this can be said of all good environment<br />
policies: they are not regressive, as the critics used to like<br />
to say, and as some of the more uncouth ones still do.<br />
Strategies like this one do not advocate a more primitive way<br />
of life, but a more sophisticated one.<br />
They do not deny development, but they say it should be<br />
intelligent. They look forward not back indeed, in the long term, they<br />
can put us ahead of the international competition and keep us<br />
there. We are encouraging a more efficient use of resources which<br />
means less demand on our primary materials, and just as<br />
importantly, more emphasis on the productive or creative<br />
process. Firms which engage in successful waste minimisation schemes<br />
have focussed on best practice. They are more likely to be<br />
more efficient in other areas, and more likely to recognise<br />
opportunities to create new ways of doing things and new<br />
products. </p>
<p>2<br />
They are more open to change, and much more able to compete<br />
with the best firms internationally and domestically.<br />
A commitment to waste minimisation and recycling commits<br />
government and industry to technology in ways we have not been<br />
committed before.<br />
By way of example, in recent years Australia has become a<br />
world leader in-waste. water treatment and recycling for paper<br />
packaging. There have been some outstanding technological advances in the<br />
recycling of other materials: in paper for instance.<br />
The collection and recycling of waste paper has meant that:<br />
-the pulp resource base of the country has been increased,<br />
which has helped us to replace imports.<br />
-jobs have been generated, particularly in the labour<br />
intensive practice of recycling.<br />
-exports have been generated, both through greater<br />
production and in the development of expertise in recycling<br />
technology. Or take the classic example of slag from Australia's<br />
steelworks. There is hardly a more a striking symbol of industrial waste<br />
than a slag-heap.<br />
But slag is now recognised as potentially high quality cement<br />
or aggregate, and new processes are now being put in place to<br />
exploit what was once the stuff of universal monuments to the<br />
ugly side of industry.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
This strategy is another policy o<br />
imagination. It will help put Au<br />
realm of the creative.<br />
Imagination in the area of waste<br />
can mean new industries, new expo<br />
Waste minimisation and recycling<br />
environment with competitive, eff,<br />
and a culture of creativity and a<br />
This particular strategy, then, i<br />
compliments, our progress towards<br />
development in Australia.<br />
It does not stand alone, even on<br />
deals with. There is a breadth t'<br />
matters. f imagination, f= r<br />
stralian industry in the<br />
minimisation and recycling<br />
rt markets and new jobs.<br />
combines protection of the<br />
icient, expanding industries<br />
daptat ion.<br />
s a key development in, and<br />
ecologically sustainable<br />
the particular issues it<br />
o government actions on these </p>
<p>Our comprehensive Land Care program, involving $ 320 million<br />
over the decade of Land Care, is helping to make agriculture<br />
and farming sustainable and is reducing waste and pollution of<br />
water and air.<br />
In regard to protection of the ozone layer we have been ahead<br />
of the pack in eliminating CFC's. Ozone depletion is a<br />
particularly insidious result of waste generation. And our<br />
strong and ongoing policies on the greenhouse effect will also<br />
lead to a reduction of waste production and pollution.<br />
This waste minimisation and recycling strategy also goes to<br />
the heart of questions of annial PquIy.<br />
Environmental costs, after all, tend to be borne unequally<br />
across the community.<br />
The better of f can generally make sure they don't suffer from<br />
waste disposal problems. Poorer people often don't have the<br />
means to move away.<br />
A national strategy like this one positively discriminates in<br />
favour of those who, since the beginnings of<br />
industrialisation, have borne an unequal share of a national<br />
burden. It is a classic reform in the interests of the nation and in<br />
the interests of all Australians a classic L-ahnr reform.<br />
Though conceived in advance of the February One Nation<br />
statement, it projects both the same broad national goals and<br />
the same means of pursuing them.<br />
As I said, it is a strategy for the universal benefit of<br />
Australians. It also seeks to In-111ad all Australians.<br />
We want, and indeed the strategy depends upon, the active<br />
participation of industry and the community.<br />
It depends on partnerships between business and local, State<br />
and Territory governments.<br />
It sets out ways in which the bodies responsible for creating<br />
household, industrial and commercial wastes can minimise them,<br />
and recycle them when they are unavoidably generated.<br />
It follows that every Australian is responsible for seeing<br />
that the strategy succeeds. The most important partnership of<br />
all is between Australians and their country.<br />
If we all participate in recycling schemes, if we all seek out<br />
goods made from recycled materials, if we all take a care to<br />
minimise the amount of waste we produce, we will all share in<br />
the success. </p>
<p>We are seeking to change attitudes.<br />
If we change attitudes we can not only improve the environment<br />
and the economy and the quality of our lives, I think we can<br />
help create a regimen of care for each other and the land we<br />
live in.<br />
That, I think, is a majnr objective and ghmid~ a be a major<br />
objective of all government policies.<br />
Of course, in launching this strategy today, we should also<br />
recognise that what we do for the environment here we do for<br />
the environment globally.<br />
Those wastes we call greenhouse gases, for instance, present a<br />
challenge to the whole world. We share the world's<br />
responsibility to limit them.<br />
As a developed country we also have a responsibility to put<br />
ourselves at the leading edge of environmental problemsolving.<br />
As the developing countries industrialise the scale of the<br />
problem is bound to grow finding solutions, we can be sure,<br />
is a growth industry.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen we are accustomed to hear of the<br />
balance in nature, or the ecological balance, the delicate<br />
arrangement in nature which assures its continuation.<br />
An equally crucial arrangement, and the one we urgently have<br />
to find, is the integration between the environment and what<br />
we make of it.<br />
The integration of our respect for an environment unspoiled,<br />
our spiritual and physical need for such an environment, and<br />
our need for economic development.<br />
We do nPPA one as much as the other.<br />
We need economic development for our survival as a nation, for<br />
the maintenance of our standard of living and, with that, our<br />
values and institutions.<br />
We also need it, I believe, because it is in our nature to<br />
create and invent.<br />
But in the debate about achieving the right balance, in<br />
searching for the inevitable and necessary compromises which<br />
will enable us to grow without degrading the world we live in<br />
ultimately we come down on the side of the world.<br />
I mean not just that we come down on the side of ecological<br />
imperatives, like breathing clean air, or reducing greenhouse<br />
gas emissions. </p>
<p>I mean that we should come down of the side of conservation<br />
rather than degradation, care rather than neglect, beauty<br />
rather than ugliness.<br />
This strategy I think is notable for making those choices.<br />
And I think it is consistently the case in good environmental<br />
policy that it advances the level of our sophistication when<br />
we decide about these balances.<br />
When for instance, on balance, we decide against mines in<br />
Kakadu; or drilling on the Barrier Reef; or accepting a crude<br />
and environment-degrading pulp mill at Wesley Vale, when more<br />
intelligent applications of technology would make a better<br />
one. So I welcome environmental debate in this country I think it<br />
advances our level of civilisation.<br />
We have been notoriously destructive of the natural<br />
environment out of ignorance, carelessness and greed.<br />
Nor have we cared as much as we should for the aesthetics of<br />
the environments we have built.<br />
In a remarkably short time we have gone from being a country<br />
where space seemed limitless, and the environment incomparably<br />
beautiful and clean, to one in which landfill sites are<br />
becoming scarce and pollution of all kinds threatens the<br />
quality of many urban, rural and natural environments.<br />
It's good for us now to think carefully about how we can not<br />
only make amends, but lead the world in strategies for the<br />
future. What we have tended to take for granted in the past we must<br />
now take as responsibilities.<br />
And again, I think it will do us no harm to be thinking about<br />
the future and about the solutions the future will require.<br />
It will be good for us to think about the way we should be<br />
developing our cities, for instance.<br />
And it's good for us to be thinking along the national lines<br />
which environment policy demands.<br />
And as we go about finding national solutions I think we<br />
should take a great deal of heart from our recent<br />
achievements. Look back on the last ten years and you will see that we have<br />
done remarkably well in achieving that balance between<br />
development and the ecology ecologically sustainable<br />
development that I spoke of earlier.<br />
For we have increased our levels of production GDP has grown<br />
by more than a third. </p>
<p>And we have increased our manufacturing our exports of<br />
manufacturing and services now outstrip mining and<br />
agriculture.<br />
But we've also doubled the size of the protected wilderness<br />
area in Tasmania; trebled the size of Kakadu National Park and<br />
protected it by banning mining; protected the Wet Tropic area<br />
of Queensland; saved the Northern New South Wales rainforests;<br />
extended the Marine Park of the Great Barrier Reef region from<br />
14 per cent to 98 per cent.<br />
We've been international leaders in legislation to protect the<br />
ozone layer and led a world campaign to prevent mining in<br />
Antarctica. We've developed a comprehensive energy conservation program<br />
and a ten year program to protect endangered species.<br />
In the area of the environment, as in much of our social<br />
legislation, we are ahead of the world, and we should be proud<br />
of it, and encouraged by it.<br />
We certainly shouldn't be tempted. to wind back our commitment<br />
either because they are too hard, or as some would have us<br />
believe, because in these difficult economic times we can't<br />
afford them.<br />
The truth is we can't afford not to protect our environment,<br />
or to let future generations pay for our neglect and<br />
expediency, or to miss the opportunities which environmental<br />
imperatives offer to us industrially.<br />
In 1992 nearly a tonne of solid waste will be produced per<br />
person in Australia.<br />
This particularly ugly and potentially depressing fact has one<br />
thing going for it we know it can be changed.<br />
This strategy shows the Government has the will to change it.<br />
By many of its recent actions industry is showing it has the<br />
will to change it. By their responses the people of Australia<br />
also give every indication that they have the will.<br />
We will change it.<br />
Within the next few years that tonne of waste will be much<br />
reduced, and we'll develop both better technologies and better<br />
ways of living on this continent in doing it.<br />
Perhaps within a decade or less the tonne of waste will have<br />
become a tonne of confidence in ourselves, and a tonne of<br />
faith in the nation.<br />
Let me conclude by congratulating the people who by dint of<br />
good ideas and conscientious effort have come up with this<br />
plan for Australia. </p>
<p>7<br />
Ros Kelly, of course, deserves much of the credit and much of<br />
the congratulations particularly for the extensive<br />
discussions with industry which she held in 1990, and which<br />
went a long way toward establishing a common understanding in<br />
government and industry.<br />
I congratulate alU those who have been involved, and urge all<br />
Australians to take up the challenge.<br />
This is a major step towards a better Australia.<br />
And it is with great pleasure and pride that I now declare it<br />
launched. </p>
