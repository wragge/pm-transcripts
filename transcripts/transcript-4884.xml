The Commonwealth and. State Governments, Maeting as<br />
2oa-Colancil, today approved an entire-ly new borrowingprogra-<br />
m which will have a signific,-qt imipact oa Aiustralials<br />
developmrent. Th e Lo an Council, acting in. accordance with guidelines<br />
set at its meeting last June, approv,$; d the first projiects to<br />
fo Par-t-of this new program.,<br />
The projects approved cover al11 six States amd.<br />
-p~ idez-for a total borrowing programn of $ 1767 million over<br />
eight years, co-uencng with borrowYings of $ 1.5B mill-ion. th-. is<br />
f inancial year. This approval is the culrination more ithan_ t(, zo<br />
years of intensive study and discussion. ork com-, r-nced in<br />
Ztunp 197.6-on the exarrdnation of particular! financing needcs in<br />
the provision of infrastructure, especially for developme~ nt<br />
projects. This work arose out of a concern that future inajoideyelcp~<br />
et~ a projects, with financing requiremeants which coujld<br />
not be accommoated within nor~ mal " serai-governmenttt borrowing<br />
programns, might be* imnpeded unless a system of providin' I<br />
additiona-to normaal borrowing could bret developed. special<br />
At its meeting in June 19718, the Loan Council adoptedl<br />
arn-eventz for infrastructure finiancing which set out guidelines<br />
for consideration by it of proposals for special a-dditions to<br />
the normial annual " semi-governm~ ent" borrowing program~ s and<br />
froyez~ eas borrowing authorities.<br />
Under the guidelines, these special additions would<br />
bfoer Proqaals whicli could not be Teasonebly accommodated within.<br />
resourc-es normally available to the Governmrent and the authority;<br />
wh-ich provide services of kinds normally providcd by Governrl-nt<br />
or 3public-utility enterprises; and which have special<br />
significante for development. Factors which would properly<br />
be talken into account in considering proposals would include<br />
whetier the Proiect: .4/ 2: </p>
<p>-2<br />
contributead to the development of Australia's<br />
national resources;<br />
contributed to the balance of payments;<br />
helpead strengthen the structure of industry;<br />
contributed to ezrp1oymtent.<br />
These additional borrowi-ngs were thus desiq-ned to<br />
poide essential facilities which would encourage productive<br />
enterprises to counence or expand. In many instances, the.<br />
orovision of new infrastructux-e would speed up the daelopnmant<br />
of new e&gt;: port oriented natturz: l rosour-ce projects in<br />
decentra2iscd areas.<br />
Trhe Loan Council decided in June it would consiaer as~<br />
practicable later this year -the first batch of projec-Ira " A<br />
submitted by t-he States within these guidelines. ' The<br />
Commowealth BFudget was fraired in the knowledge that applications<br />
___ for such additional borrowings coz,-Dncing in 1978/ 79 would he<br />
considered by Loan Col-Lcil.<br />
___ The State Governmnrts proposed a total of 12 prje. s<br />
-for special boa-owing under the program andsnetn hs<br />
projects have been the subject of intensive examination and<br />

In assessing its attitude to the projects, the<br />
_______ Comonwealth has been particularly conscious of its overall<br />
economic mariagen-ent responisibilitie h edt nueZn<br />
that the level of special borrowings approved, both in total<br />
alinual reouircnrents, is consiste-nt -with the Commonwealth's<br />
fiscal and monetary policy objectives. There could be. no<br />
question of allowing the level of special borrowings -to<br />
omnpromise our steady progre. ss toward-s economic recovery.<br />
Subject to this overriding econormic pol-icy constrain*<br />

<p>ERARING ELECTRICITY PROJECT ( NSW)<br />
Brief Description A major new station at Eraring on Lake Macquarie of<br />
4 x 660 MW units, and associated mines and transmission lines,<br />
together with major expansions at two other stations ( Vales<br />
Point and Wallerawang) create a peak expenditure situation<br />
over the three years commencing 1978-79. Work for the first<br />
two units at Eraring has been in progress since 1977 and<br />
contracts have been let for some components of the other two<br />
units. Funding Arrangements A total of $ 682 million at June 1978 prices, will be<br />
required over the three years. $ 456 million of this is required<br />
for Eraring. The availability of funds from internal generation,<br />
depletion of reserves and normal loan allocations is anticipated<br />
to be $ 472 million, at June 1978 prices, leaving a shortfall<br />
of $ 210 million. Special additions are sought for this.<br />
Phasing Expenditure at June 1978 prices, in the three years<br />
commencing 1978-79 of $ 211, $ 238 and $ 233 million ( total<br />
program) and $ 87, $ 174 and $ 195 million ( Eraring). Very<br />
little flexibility exists in these timings. The special<br />
additions to borrowings will be required as follows<br />
1978-79 1979-80 1980-81<br />
Sm 55 80<br />
General Comments Project is needed for the provision of adequate<br />
electrical energy in New South Wales in the first half of the<br />
S 1980' s. Proposed developments in the coal industry and forest<br />
product industry might not proceed in the absence of clear<br />
indication of energy availability.<br />
Improvement of employment opportunities in a country<br />
region a peak of 1,100 workers will be employed during<br />
construction and some 1,700 will be required for operating the<br />
power stations and coal mines. </p>
<p>COAL LOADING FACILITIES ( NSW)<br />
Brief Description New coal loader and stockpiles for Port Kembla<br />
to more than double annual capacity to 15 million tonnes<br />
and to increase from 70,000 to 110,000 tonnes the size of<br />
ships that can be handled. Augmentation of Balmain loader<br />
and stockpiles to increase capacity from 2.8 to 4.5 million<br />
tonnes per annum and ship size from 40,000 to 55,000 tonnes.<br />
Tenders called for some parts of the works, others in<br />
advanced stages of planning.<br />
Funding Arrangements Expected cost at June 1978 prices of $ 89 million.<br />
other commitments of industry and Maritime Services Board<br />
necessitate financing in full by special additions.<br />
Phasing Special additions required in the three years<br />
commencing 1978/ 79 of $ 24, $ 32 and $ 33 million at June<br />
1978 prices. Delayed completion would be at the expense<br />
of economic development, employment and sales of export<br />
coal. General Comments Exports of coal from the West, South West and<br />
Southern Coal fields already exceed loader capacity.<br />
Mines cannot expand unless loaders are provided and the<br />
increased ship sizes able to be handled will aid market<br />
diversification. Will benefit balance of payments through<br />
increased export earnings.<br />
Benefits for non-metropolitan employment7 will<br />
aid decentralisation7 will contribute to New South Wales<br />
State revenues. </p>
<p>LOY YANG POWER STATION ( VIC)<br />
Brief Description The Loy Yang project is a major base-load power<br />
development comprising an open cut brown coal mine, two power<br />
stations, each with an installed capacity of 2000 MW, and<br />
associated works located near Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley<br />
( approximately 160 kilometres from Melbourne).<br />
Preliminary work on the project commenced on site<br />
early in 1977 and all major contracts for the first 2000 MW<br />
stage have been let.<br />
Funding Arrangements The project, to be constructed by the State Electricity<br />
Commission of Victoria, is estimated to cost $ 2,050 million at<br />
June 1978 prices. Special additions to the Commission's borrowing program<br />
totalling $ 343 million at June 1978 prices, are required to<br />
assist in financing the initial stages of the project.<br />
Phasing The special additions to borrowing would be required<br />
as follows: Sm 1978-79 1979-80 .1980-81 1981-82 1982-83<br />
88 37 119 64<br />
It is essential for construction work to continue<br />
0 as planned in order to ensure that the first generating capacity<br />
will be available for commission in 1983/ 84.<br />
General Comments The Loy Yang project is the main element in the<br />
State Electricity Commission's long-term expansion program<br />
for meeting Victoria's electricity needs.<br />
During construction of the project there will be<br />
some 1,500 people directly employed. On completion the<br />
project will directly employ an additional 1,000 persons in<br />
the Latrobe Valley. </p>
<p>WORLE TRADE CENTRE, MELBOURNE ( VIC)<br />
Brief Description The proposal covers the first stage of the World<br />
Trade Centre complex proposal for construction by the<br />
Melbourne Harbour Trust on the edge of the central business<br />
district of Melbourne. The first stage of the complex comprises<br />
the world trade centre itself, a trade mart and office<br />
accommodation for organisations and firms having a close link<br />
with overseas trade, including the Melbourne Harbor Trust.<br />
Tenders have been called for this stage of the project.<br />
Fundinp Arrangements The project will be constructed by the Melbourne<br />
Harbor Trust and a special addition of $ 55.9 million is sought<br />
to the Trust's borrowing program.<br />
A decision on the availability of funds is required<br />
to enable work to commence during the last quarter of 1978<br />
calendar year.<br />
0 Phasing The special addition to borrowing would. be made as<br />
follows: 1978-79 1979-8 1980-81 1981-82<br />
24 20 2<br />
As tenders have been called work could commence as<br />
soon as funds have been approved.<br />
0 General Comments Melbourne is Australia's leading export port.<br />
The proposed trade centre will be a focal point for the<br />
development of overseas markets and for information on<br />
commodity prices, freight and insurance. By promoting export<br />
opportunities for Australian industry it could make a positive<br />
contribution to Australia's balance of payments.<br />
During the construction period the project will<br />
provide employment for more than 1,000 people. In operation<br />
it is expected to increase the efficiency of port administration. </p>
<p>COAL EXPORT FACILITIES AT HAY POINT ( OLD)<br />
Brief Description Provision of new coal loading facilities at Hay Point,<br />
south of Mackay, to be operational by 1981 to meet planned coal<br />
export growth. On-shore facilities include rail unloading and<br />
stockpile area while off-shore facilities include trestle and<br />
conveyor, a berth and dredging.<br />
Proposed capacity is 12 million tonnes per annum with<br />
provision for future expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum.<br />
Funding Arrangements Estimated cost of facilities is $ 115 million at<br />
current prices.<br />
0 Proposed that private sector ( coal developers) will<br />
provide finance for the on-shore facilities by way of security<br />
deposit on shared basis, approximate cost $ 40 million.<br />
In addition private sector will meet the cost of other mining<br />
infrastructure ( township facilities, major railway improvements,<br />
power and water supply). This cannot be fully quantified at<br />
this stage but the cost of railway improvements alone for the<br />
first two mines ( which will use only half the proposed capacity)<br />
will be approximately $ 100 million.<br />
Proposed that State meet the cost of off-shore<br />
facilities, estimated cost of $ 75 million at current prices<br />
all by special additions.<br />
Phas inp_<br />
0 1979-80 $ 40 million, 1980-81-$ 35 million.<br />
Detailed planning and construction needs to commence<br />
by end 1978 to enable facilities to be ready for use by 1981<br />
when the first mining project is expected to begin shipments.<br />
General Comments The provision of the facilities will enable the<br />
development of major export coal projects in Queensland ( German,<br />
Creek and Oaky Creek). The projects will contribute significantly<br />
to Australia's balance of payments through increased export<br />
earnings. There would be additions to Queensland State<br />
revenues through payroll tax, royalties and rail freight.<br />
It is expected that townships of around 4,000-5,000<br />
people will developed for each mine. </p>
<p>POWER STATION PROJECTS ( QLD)<br />
Brief Description To cover projected growth in demand, additional<br />
electricity capacity will be required over the next five<br />
years, including completion of Gladstone power station<br />
by 1981 ( additional 550 MW).<br />
Completion of Wivenhoe pump storage<br />
hydro-electric project by end of<br />
1983 ( 500 MW), and<br />
Work on first set of new Tarong power<br />
station to be completed by 1985<br />
( total Tarong 1,400 MW).<br />
Funding Arrangements Total requirement is in excess of $ 1,200 million<br />
( at current costs), $ 130 million of which is required as a<br />
special addition balance to be funded internally including<br />
normal loan allocation.<br />
Phasing 1979-80 $ 70 million, and 1981-82 $ 60 million.<br />
Approval required now to enable planning of development<br />
and level of power tariffs.<br />
* General Comments The projects are needed to maintain power supply<br />
in the State at anticipated levels. The stations at Gladstone<br />
and Tarong will require the development of further coal mines;<br />
while Wiver. hoe will make use of available water resources.<br />
The development of industry in Queensland will be aided by the<br />
provision of adequate pover supplies. </p>
<p>REDOLIFF ( SA)<br />
Brief Description The project plans to use liquid hydrocarbons from<br />
the Cooper Basin in South Australia as feedstock for a<br />
petrochemical plant at Redcliff. The special addition to the<br />
Loan Council borrowing program is to provide a power station,<br />
pipelines for liquids and gas and other infrastructure to<br />
service a petrochemical complex at Redcliff. The current<br />
status is that Dow Chemical ( Aust) Ltd is ready to carry out<br />
detailed feasibility studies as soon as infrastructure is<br />
assured.<br />
Funding Arrangements Total investment in the Redcliff project is estimated<br />
at W95 million ( in 1978 prices).<br />
A private sector component of $ 649 million<br />
is to be financed by Dow and the Cooper<br />
Basin Producers.<br />
A public sector component for infrastructure<br />
of $ 256 million is to be funded by:<br />
South Australian Government $ 253.5 million<br />
Australian National Railways $ 2.8 million.<br />
A special addition of $ 186 million is<br />
required by South Australia as part of<br />
its contribution.<br />
Phasing The special addition to borrowings would be raised<br />
as follows: 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84<br />
Sm 11 70 96 4 4<br />
Genera] Comments The Redcliff project will allow the immediate exploitation<br />
of natural gas liquid reserves which might otherwise be lost<br />
flared). It will contribute positively to the balance of<br />
payments in export earnings and by substitution for products<br />
that would otherwise be imported caustic soda; vinyl<br />
chloride monomer). The project will provide siinificant regional benefits<br />
to South Australia. The Redeliff complex will provide direct employment for<br />
710 people; and it is estimated that the total increase of 1420<br />
jobs 1 : ill result. The project should create nearly 4500<br />
construction jobs during its peak phase. </p>
<p>DAMPIER-PERTH GAS PIPELINE ( WA)<br />
Brief Description The construction of a pipeline to bring natural<br />
gas from Dampier 1,500 kilometres to Perth, and for marketing<br />
the gas in the South West of the State. The project is a<br />
key component of the North West Shelf gas development which<br />
involves the production of natural gas for the Pilbara, Perth<br />
and South West of Western Australia and liquified natural gas<br />
for export. The Joint Venturers developing the North Rankin<br />
Gas Field are well advanced with their feasibility and design<br />
studies of the overall project and are scheduled to make a decision<br />
with the State in the latter part of 1979 whether or not to<br />
proceed. Funding Arrangements Private sector investment in the North West Shelf<br />
Gas Project is estimated at $ 3,000 million in 1978 prices.<br />
The public sector expenditure in the pipeline is estimated at<br />
$ 442.5 million ( June 1978 prices) of which $ 416 million is<br />
required as a special addition under the infrastructure financing<br />
guidelines. Phasing Latest timing estimates of expenditure of the<br />
$ 416 million special addition ( June 1978 prices) are $ 133 million<br />
in 1982/ 83, $ 263 million in1983/ 84, $ 17 million in 1984/ 85<br />
and $ 3 million in 1985/ 86.<br />
A decision on the availability of funds is required<br />
now to enable the Energy Commission and the Western Australian<br />
Government to firmly declare their ability to proceed and<br />
enable the developers to compile their feasibility and design<br />
studies and make a decision on the whole North-West shelf gas<br />
project by September 1979.<br />
General Comments The pipeline is an integral part of the proposed<br />
North-West Shelf gas development and will enable about half of<br />
the natural gas resources to be used for Australian consumption.<br />
The natural gas supply from Dampier to Perth/ South-West region<br />
will help broaden the industrial base of Western Australia.<br />
The project should assist the balance of payments by allowing<br />
imported fuel oil to be replaced by gas.<br />
The pipeline project will employ directly some 1000<br />
to 1500 people during the construction phase lasting 18 to<br />
24 months. </p>
<p>WORSLEY ALUMINA PROJE~ CT ( WA)<br />
Brief Description The establishment of a bauxite-alumina project in<br />
the South West of Western Australia with an initial alumina<br />
capacity of 1 million tonnes per year is proposed. Bauxite<br />
will be either railed or transported by conveyor to the<br />
refinery and water requirements for the first stage of the<br />
project will be piped from Vi~ e Wellington Dam. The special<br />
additions to borrowing programs are to provide the railway<br />
and water supply facilities.<br />
Funding Arrangements Assuming bauxite is railed to the refinery the<br />
private sector investment in the total development is estimated<br />
at $ 695 million ( June 1978 prices).<br />
Total public sector investment is estimated at<br />
million ( June 1978 prices) and special additions of<br />
$ 41.1 million ( June 1978 prices) are sought for the provision<br />
of water supply and rail facilities which will be funded entirely<br />
by the public sector.<br />
Phasing The proposed phasing of the borrowings is:<br />
1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82<br />
Sm9 20 12 1<br />
A decision on the availability of funds is required<br />
now to facilitate construction planning programmed to begin<br />
in January 1979.<br />
General Comments The infrastructure proposal is associated with a<br />
private investment project that will contribute to the<br />
development of national resources. The alumina project will<br />
generate export income.<br />
The construction of the Worsley refinery will provide<br />
100 construction jobs initially, rising to a maximum of 1600<br />
withan average of 1000 for the duration of the construction<br />
period. The operation of the project will require 164 persons<br />
employed at the mine site and 605 persons at the refinery. </p>
<p>THE PILBARA REGION POWER SUPPLY INTEGRATION ( WA)<br />
Brief Description Because of the rapid development of the Pilbara since<br />
the early 1960' s, electricity supplies in the region could not<br />
be provided by the State Government and individual mining<br />
companies developed their own electricity systems. The State<br />
Energy Commission is seeking to progressively assume its full<br />
normal role in the Pilbara region with the intention of ultimately<br />
supplying all customers, industrial, commercial and residential.<br />
The present fragmented approach to the provision of power in the<br />
region is wasteful of resources. Currently there are ninety<br />
one generating units spread over eleven separate medium sized<br />
systems operated by five different organisations.<br />
Funding Arrangements All capital. expenditure for the interconnections<br />
0 and additional plant will be raised by the State Energy<br />
Commission. In June 1978 prices $ 111 million will be needed<br />
and the total amount is sought in the form of special additions<br />
under the infrastructure financing guidelines.<br />
Phas ing The timing of expenditures is estimated to be<br />
million in 1979/ 80, $ 11 million in 1980/ 81, $ 15 million<br />
in 1981/ 82, $ 16 million in 1982/ 83 and 1983/ 84, $ 27 million<br />
in 1984/ 85 and $ 21 million in 1985/ 86. However this timing<br />
will depend on the pace of development in the region which is<br />
difficult to predict.<br />
It is essential. that integration take place prior<br />
to any further major expansion of the mining industry since<br />
power facilities normally take longer to construct than a<br />
mining expansion.<br />
General Comments The proposal will contribute to a rationalisation<br />
and more judicious use of resources. The existence of an<br />
integrated power supply will lower the relatively high costs<br />
of power involved in numerous small plants.<br />
The proposal should help decentralisation and by<br />
stimulating industrial demand lead to increased employment. </p>
<p>WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS ( TAS)<br />
Brief Description Special additions are required over the next five<br />
years to assist in the funding of peak capital expenditure<br />
required for augmentation of and construction of new water<br />
supplies in three separate areas of Tasmania. The projects<br />
are: The augmentation of supply to the Hobart<br />
metropolitan area by the Metropolitan<br />
Water Board;<br />
The construction of a regional supply<br />
scheme by the North West Regional Water<br />
Authority; and<br />
Augmentation of the North Esk Regional<br />
Water Supply by the Rivers and Water<br />
Supply Commission.<br />
Fundingz Arrangements Total capital expenditure on the three water schemes<br />
in the five year period commenci ng 1978/ 79 is estimated to be<br />
million at early 1978 prices. Allowing for amounts to be<br />
funded from ordinary loan sources, special additions of<br />
million are req~ uired.<br />
Phas ing The special additions to borrowings are required<br />
as follows: 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83<br />
Sm 10 8 8 5 4<br />
Project has a planned construction period of<br />
six years and was commenced about one year ago. Project ( 3)<br />
has beer. commenced and should be completed in 1980/ 81.<br />
Project has not yet been started.<br />
Any delays to the planned schedules of works relating<br />
to all three projects will result in further shortages of water<br />
and more severe rationing of domestic supplies.<br />
General Comments Each of the projects makes use of Tasmania' s abundant<br />
water resources and will contribute to industry development and<br />
thus to employment. The projects have indirect implications<br />
for Australia's balance of payments through the supply of water<br />
essential to industrial processes. </p>
<p>S HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER DEVELOPMENT ( TAS)<br />
Brief Description Special additions are sought over the next five<br />
years to assist in the funding of peak capital expenditure in<br />
the further development of Tasmania's hydro-electric power<br />
system. Two specific projects will be involved, namely the<br />
Pieman River Power Development and another, probably the<br />
Lower Gordon Power Development. The Pieman Scheme was commenced<br />
in 1975 and is now scheduled for completion in 1986.<br />
Construction of the Lower Gordon Scheme is scheduled to start<br />
in a substantial way in 1981/ 82.<br />
Funding Arrangements At January 1978 prices total estimated capital<br />
expenditure by the Commission for the five years commencing<br />
1978/ 79 will be $ 347 million. After allowing for contributions<br />
from internal funds and normal loan allocations, special<br />
additions of $ 75 million are reouired.<br />
Phas ing million per annum for the five years beginning<br />
in 1978/ 79. The decision is required now to enable the capital<br />
construction program to proceed as planned so that the power<br />
system will be able to meet the demands placed on it.<br />
General Comments Water is one of Tasmania's most widespread natural<br />
resources and the large scale production of relatively low<br />
cost hydro-electric power is a major factor in the development<br />
of the Tasmanian economy. Production of additional power is<br />
required to meet normal long-term growth as well as supplying<br />
needed increments for major industries.<br />
The Commission employs an outside construction force<br />
of 900 men, together with additional support staff of at least<br />
200. </p>
