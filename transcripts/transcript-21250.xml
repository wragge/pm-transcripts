  Today I am delighted to officially open the National Threat Assessment Centre (NTAC), marking its transition to 24 hours a day, seven days a week operations a full month ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>  Funded at more than $50 million over the next five years, the NTAC will bring together agencies involved in assessing terrorist threat intelligence in a single centre to provide a comprehensive whole-of-government service.</p>
<p>Australia';s intelligence agencies stand at the frontline of our national security effort.</p>
<p> Timely and efficient intelligence gathering is the most effective weapon against the potential terrorist threat to Australia.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce today an additional $232 million in funding for intelligence agencies, with further announcements on funding for Australia';s intelligence and national security capability in next week';s Budget.</p>
<p>The additional funding includes $131.4 million over four years for ASIO.</p>
<p>  This brings to $332.2 million the total increased funding committed to ASIO since September 2001, which represents a doubling of its budget over that time.  With staffing already around the levels of the Cold War period, by 2006-07 ASIO';s staff levels will have increased by nearly 80 per cent since September 2001.</p>
<p>  The government will also be providing additional funding of $100.6 million in this Budget to further strengthen the counter-terrorism capabilities of ASIS ($45.6 million), enhance the Department of Defence';s intelligence operations and analytical capacity ($47.4 million) and boost the capabilities of ONA ($7.6 million).</p>
<p>Today';s announcement is a further demonstration of the Australian Government';s commitment to bolstering the resources of the Australian intelligence community. The government will continue to ensure that our intelligence agencies are given the support necessary to carry out their vital work.</p>
