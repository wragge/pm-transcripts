EMBARGO: 8. 30 P. M.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF THE GOVERNORGENERAL'S<br />
DINNER, TUESDAY 9 JULY 74<br />
SIR PAUL HASLUCK'S LONG AND REMARKABLE CAREER<br />
HAS BEEN LANDMARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF " FIRSTS",<br />
TO OPEN A PARLIAMENT AND FAREWELL IT ON THE SAME DAY<br />
IS A RECORD LIKELY TO STAND FOR A VERY LONG TIME.<br />
THIS OCCASION IS ABOVE ALL A PARLIAMENTARY OCCASION.<br />
WE FAREWELL A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF 20 YEARS.<br />
THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL, HOWEVER, IS A CONSTITUENT PART<br />
OF A PARLIAMENT WHICH CONSISTS OF THE QUEEN, THE SENATE<br />
AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AS THE QUEEN'S<br />
REPRESENTATIVE IN AUSTRALIA, HIS EXCELLENCY IS PART<br />
OF THIS PARLIAMENT, So IT IS DOUBLY FITTING THAT<br />
THIS MEMORABLE DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE PARLIAMENT<br />
AND, I TRUST, A MEMORABLE DAY CROWNING A VERY<br />
MEMORABLE CAREER SHOULD END HERE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
AND A GREAT CAREER IT HAS BEEN INDEED<br />
A CAREER OF HIGH ACCOMPLISHMENT BY A MOST HIGHLY<br />
ACCOMPLISHED AUSTRALIAN, THE LIST IS EXTRAORDINARY<br />
JOURNALIST, AUTHOR, HISTORIAN, ACADEMIC, CIVIL<br />
SERVANT, DIPLOMATIST, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT,<br />
MINISTER OF THE CROWN, VICEROY-A CAREER<br />
REMARKABLE IN ITS DIVERSITY, YET EQUALLY REMARKABLE<br />
IN ITS CONSISTENCY, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A PRO-CONSUL<br />
OF MORE DIVERSE ATTAINMENT SINCE CICERO.<br />
THIS SHINING CAREER HAS ONE CLEAR, CONSISTENT THEME,<br />
THE SERVICE OF AUSTRALIA AND THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
IN ONE CAPACITY OR ANOTHER, HE HAS BEEN IN THE SERVICE<br />
OF THE CROWN AND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE<br />
FOR AN UNINTERRUPTED THIRTY-FIVE YEARS,<br />
IN THE BRIEF PERIODS WHEN HE WAS NOT HELPING TO MAKE<br />
AUSTRALIAN HISTORY, HE WAS TEACHING IT OR WRITING IT,<br />
AND NO LESS REMARKABLE, LADY HASLUCK,<br />
AN HISTORIAN IN HER OWN RIGHT, OF ELEGANCE AND<br />
CHARM IN HER WRITING AND HER PERSON ALIKE, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AROUND THIS ROOM ARE SCORES OF MEN AND<br />
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIS<br />
EXCELLENCY IN VARIOUS PERIODS OF HIS CAREER, WHO<br />
HAVE WORKED WITH HIM OR WORKED UNDER HIM.<br />
THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO WERE HIS PARLIAMENTARY<br />
COLLEAGUES, MANY OF THEM. HIS FORMER MINISTERIAL<br />
COLLEAGUES. THERE ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO SERVED<br />
HIM AS MINISTER, AND THERE ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS<br />
WHO WERE HIS COLLEAGUES WHEN HE TOO, WAS A PUBLIC<br />
SERVANT. I MIGHT BE FORGIVEN IF I SINGLE OUT<br />
FOR MENTION THOSE WHO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM ON<br />
A UNIQUE OCCASION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THIS NATION.<br />
HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO PRESENT CREDENTIALS<br />
TO THE FIRST SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED HATIONS, </p>
<p>His COLLEAGUES IN NEW YORK WERE MR. ARTHUR TANGE, fiR.<br />
JOHN MOORE, MR. ALAN RENOUF AND MISS JULIA DRAKE-BROCKMAN.<br />
SIR ARTHUR TANGE HAS BECOME SECRETARY OF THE DEFENCE DEPARTMENT,<br />
fiR, JUSTICE MOORE HAS BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION, MR. RENOUF HAS BECOME<br />
SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AND MISS<br />
DRAKE-BROCKMAN HAS BECOME MRS.' MOORE. OUR FIRST PERMANENT<br />
MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS IS ASSEMBLED HERE AGAIN TONIGHT<br />
TO FAREWELL ITS CHIEF,<br />
HIs EXCELLENCY HAD THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF COMING TO<br />
HEAD AS MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH<br />
HE HAD SERVED.<br />
THERE IS A NICE SYMMETRY ABOUT HIS EXECUTIVE CAREER.<br />
AS HE HIMSELF RECORDS IN THE PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME<br />
OF HIS WAR HISTORY, HIS PROMOTION TO THE MINISTRY WAS HASTENED<br />
BY THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION OF 1951; HIS LAST FORMAL DUTY WAS TO OPEN<br />
A PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS CREATED THROUGH A DOUBLE DISSOLUTION WHICH<br />
HE HIMSELF HAD GRANTED. HE DID NOT ATTAIN THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP,<br />
BUT WITHOUT IN ANY WAY DEROGATING FROM THE DISTINGUISHED CANDIDATES<br />
WHO SOUGHT THE LEADERSHIPOF THE LIBERAL PARTY AFTER THE TRAGIC<br />
EVENT OF DECEMBER 1967, IT IS NO SECRET TH. AT AT THE TIME I WOULD<br />
HAVE REGARDED PAUL HASLUCK AS THE MOST FORMIDABLE OPPONENT,<br />
I AM NOT SAYING THAT WE WOULD HAVE LOST THE ELECTIONS IN 1972,<br />
BUT PERHAPS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE WON, </p>
<p>HOWEVER THAT MAY BE, HE DID COME TO HEAD<br />
ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EXPEDITIOUS EXECUTIVE<br />
COUNCILS WE HAVE EVER HAD, IT WAS A HAPPY, HARMONIOUS,<br />
HEADY TRIUMVIRATE. FOR THOSE TWO WEEKS IN DECEMBER, 1972,<br />
THERE WAS TOTAL PRIVATE AND PUBLIC UNANIMITY AMONG ALL<br />
TWENTY-SEVEN MINISTRIES, AND IN THOSE DAYS WE STRUCK<br />
AN ACCORD WITH THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL WHICH HAS REMAINED<br />
UNMARREDI UNDIMINISHED, HIS GOVERNOR-GENERALSHIP, THE CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED AS GOVERNOR-GENERAL,<br />
CONFIRM CONCLUSIVELY, IF CONFIRMATION WERE NEEDED,<br />
THREE GREAT TRUTHS: THE ABSOLUTE FITNESS OF APPOINTING<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO AUSTRALIAIS HIGHEST POSITION, THE<br />
ABSOLUTE FITNESS OF POLITICIANS TO HOLD THAT OFFICE<br />
AND THE ABSOLUTE ABILITY OF OPPOSING POLITICIANS TO<br />
BURY PARTISANSHIP IN THE SERVICE OF THE NATION, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
SIR PAUL HASLUCK'S CAREER IS ITSELF A<br />
TRIBUTE TO THE BASIC STRENGTH AND STABILITY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM WHICH HE SERVED FOR<br />
SO LONG WITH SUCH FIDELITY, AT A TIME WHEN<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IS EVERYWHERE UNDERGOING<br />
TREMENDOUS STRESSES WHICH CHALLENGE ITS BASIC ASSUMPTIONS,<br />
WHICH CHALLENGE ITS VERY SURVIVAL, IT IS GOOD TO BE<br />
REMINDED OF THE TRUE SOURCES OF ITS STRENGTH AND<br />
TO HAVE IN THE PERSON AND CAREER OF OUR OWN GOVERNORGENERAL,<br />
A POWERFUL, LIVING REMINDER OF THE HUMAN<br />
QUALITIES BY WHICH ALONE THAT STRENGTH CAN BE<br />
MAINTAINED, </p>
