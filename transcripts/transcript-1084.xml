UNVEILING OF A PLA UE AT THE NEJ TELEPHONE EXCHANGE,<br />
BATHURST,, J96.<br />
Mr. Chairman, Your Worship the Mayor, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Iiuchetti<br />
and all those other people who were referred to just now by<br />
the Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Girls and Boys t<br />
Now that is fairly comprehensive. I thincz I would<br />
like to begin by telling you that my wife regrets her absence<br />
just as much as you do, but we managed and shae's a -%, oman of<br />
strong mind to force her into hospital about eight or nine<br />
days ago, and to keep her there. It's been a very remarkable<br />
achievement, and I trust ahe will be there for another few<br />
days and that she will come out completely recovered. She<br />
wanted to come, partly because she likes to come with me<br />
strange as it may seem ( Laughter) partly because she likes<br />
visiting places of this historic interest and importance and<br />
partly and this I say with infinite regret because I should<br />
dearly love to defeat him politically partly because she has<br />
a soft spot for Tony Luchetti. ( Laughter)<br />
Now this event is of double interest because it<br />
occurs in this city. I myself was at school in a place called<br />
Balla rat in the State o17 Victoria, an old gold mining city<br />
which, when gold had gone, became a prosperous community because<br />
it was set in the middle of a magnificently fertile district,<br />
Now you didn't actually have gold mining here but I think that<br />
the historical records would show that when the gol~ d came in<br />
from outlying places, the citizenry of Bathurst and perhaps the<br />
tavern-keepers in particular managed to let a little of the<br />
gold rub off on their fingers so that you have an old association<br />
with gold mining back in the fifties, and you, in turn, when<br />
all that had gone, or most of it had gone, found yourself a<br />
growing prosperous community because you had a lovely district,<br />
a lovely and fertile district set about you, So I feel there<br />
is something a little in common between an old Ballaratian and<br />
you ladies and gentlemen of Bathurst,<br />
It's a very interesting thing that this city has not<br />
just been uontent to rest on its laurels, hasn't been content<br />
Just to say, " Well, we are the third oldest city in the whole<br />
Commonwealth of Australia. We were established in the year<br />
of ' Taterloo. We are, ourselves, an historic monument as a<br />
town." 1 You haven't been content to do that because the<br />
growth is proceeding apace. I'm indebted to the Post office<br />
for an interesting figure I didn't come here to quote<br />
statistics, I can assure you but in the year in which that<br />
very great Australian and memorable Prime Minister, J. B. Chifley,<br />
became Prime Minister 194-5 there were 826 subscribers on<br />
the .3-athurst ' ikcchange. Nov that seems only the other day.<br />
It's a tribute to the strength of Ben Cbhifley's personality,<br />
the genuineness o-f his friendship that one remembers him<br />
always as if it were the day before yesterday, and it was<br />
194+ 5, Today there are 2,635 subscribers. That means over<br />
three times as many in that relatively short span of time.<br />
Now that argues it is one of the index figures, so to speak,<br />
that Bathurst continues to grow and that as it grows it will<br />
increasingly add to its historic significance a very real<br />
economic and civic significance as one of the great provincial<br />
cities in our country. And on all these grounds one is e/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
delighted to be here.<br />
I noticed in one of the documents that you have<br />
been producing for this great event that the first postal<br />
deliveries were made here in 1828 and that the postal services<br />
at that time were somewhat interrupted by bushr'angers led by<br />
the redoutable Ben Hall who, unlike Ned Kelly, had not yet<br />
become a popular hero. ( laughter) But bushrangers were<br />
troublesome, and you remember that a great number of people<br />
at that time, or some of them, in order to avoid or avert<br />
their depredations, used to cut banknotes in half and send<br />
half by post and half by other means so that they w-ouldn't<br />
be worth anything until the tw~ o halves had been put together.<br />
Well, the bushrangers went out of business shortly after more<br />
modern communications were established and indeed, I think<br />
that Gus Kelly would agree with me thal most of them have<br />
now retreated to the fastnesses of Sydney and Melbourne,<br />
( Laughter) There is one other thing I would like to say about<br />
the significance of Bathurst because I really do believe that<br />
this is a most significant place,. This is a commonplace to a<br />
lot of you but it may not have been recalled by some. Five<br />
of the great explorers in Australia made Bathurst their point<br />
of departure on their great historic excursions into the<br />
inland of Australia and down towards the south Evans, Oxley,<br />
Cunningham, Mitchell and 3turt,<br />
It is worthwhile recalling their names because there<br />
were great and courageous men, literally going out into the<br />
unknown and it does some honour to the Federal Parliament that<br />
there should be a constituency today, an electorate of Evans,<br />
one of Oxley, one of Cunningham, one of Mitchell and one of<br />
Sturt. They heve been commemorated in perpetuity in the<br />
Federal Parliament, the National Parliament of this country,<br />
and their association with this city is wrorth recalling because<br />
people like that represented the first real break-through<br />
into the hinterland in Australia just as 4ent'iorth and<br />
Blaxland who came over the mountains and came to here were<br />
the first people to break through what seemed to be the<br />
impassable barriers which confined the old original Sydney<br />
settlement, . Jell, we know perfectly well that but for the work<br />
of these people, but for t'aeir courage, but for their determination,<br />
this land might not have been opened up for many, many<br />
years and Australia would have remained a relatively poor<br />
country a rather precarious colony perched on the coast.<br />
All thai has changed. It is now a rich and well-balanced<br />
country, growing steadily in strength and in significance.<br />
And poised as you are here at the very beginning point of this<br />
tremendous drive into the inland of Australia, you must<br />
continue to be proud of your heritage and perhaps if I may<br />
say so, equally determined as we all must be, to ? e pioneers<br />
ourselves in the day in which we live, not to be afraid to<br />
take a chance, not to be afraid to go out on to something<br />
new because this is what our forefathers and your forefathers<br />
did in their time and in this place.<br />
Just one other thing I would like to say about<br />
Bathurst because again in that respect that reminds me of<br />
Ballarat. It is a city which has been endowed by those who<br />
wont before with a sense of beauty. I think that the City<br />
Square here is one of the most beautiful squares in Australia 9 e */ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
and I hope that it will always be kept so just as I recall<br />
with pride and pleasure the work done by he pioneers of<br />
Ballarat in gardens and in statuary, and in particular, every<br />
time I have come through Bathurst, sometimes on reputable<br />
missions, sometimes on political exercises ( Laughter), I<br />
have paused long enough to look with admiration at that<br />
lovely tower designed by that great architect and artist,<br />
John Moore. That is, I think, one of the lovely buildings<br />
in Australia because it has everything it has proportion,<br />
it has colour, the right kind of colour, it has setting and<br />
it exhibits th pride of a proud community.<br />
Now I haven't seen the design of the building<br />
that will go up here. I hope it won't be too hideous.<br />
( Laughter) All I know already is that it will be reasonably<br />
costly and that will give great pleasure to Tony Luchetti<br />
who wanted something costly not something trifling but<br />
whatever it turns out to be, it will be a matter o1 immnense<br />
advantage to this community, and it is a very interesting<br />
thing and gives me great pleasure to be able to recall some<br />
time that it was erected, begun, initiated in this 150th<br />
year of his historic place.<br />
Now I think I will now relieve you from the burden<br />
of listening to me by taking you into my confidence on one<br />
point. I have never been too clear this morning as to what<br />
I do, whether I unveil a foundation stone that is already<br />
laid or whether I lay a foundation stone and tap it and say,<br />
" I declare this well and truly laid." I usually take<br />
precautions on this matter by finding out in advance what<br />
I have to do and then do it, in case I forget to do it at the<br />
end of the speech. ( Laughter) So whatever it is, I now<br />
have great pleasure in do--! ng it. </p>
