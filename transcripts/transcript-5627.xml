PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 27 JULY, 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO ROYAL COMMONWEALTH SOCIETY, LONDON<br />
Delivered for the Prime Minister by the<br />
Australian High Commissioner in London,<br />
Mr. Garland<br />
Australians in general Will join me in congratulating his<br />
Royal Highness, Prince Charles, on the occasion of his marriage<br />
to Lady Diana Spencer. We took him to our hearts when he first<br />
came to school at Timbertop in 1966. Happily his visits to us<br />
since have been frequent. He assures us -that he enjoys Australia<br />
and we look forward to welcoming him and his Princess soon.<br />
It is indeed a healthy situation where there is, so clearly, rauch<br />
reciprocal warmth between Australians and their future sovere: Lgnas<br />
indeed there is with the present sovereign. It is however<br />
especially important this week to remember that the Queen is not<br />
just Queen of this country and of Australia, but also Head of<br />
the Commonwealth. The changes that have produced the modern<br />
Commonwealth have largely occurred during her reign and during<br />
this period of change she has stood as a symbol of continuity..<br />
But she has done more than that: she has brought wisdom, charm,<br />
and with the passing of time incomparable experience to her ro~ le.<br />
Indeed, the Queen has shown that the institution of the Monarchy.-<br />
ancient as it is has a capacity to unify peoples and nations in<br />
a way that is un ' ique in the modern world. She has made the<br />
Monarchy an effective and vital symbol of common humanity and<br />
shared values that'link the peoples of the modern * Commonwealth<br />
together. No Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting would be<br />
complete without her presence and we look forward vrery much to<br />
welcoming her at Melbourne. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Mr. President, this is an important year for the Commonwealth.<br />
Two years ago we met at Lusaka and made a major contribution t~ o<br />
resolving a difficult and dangerous problem, one that others had<br />
tried and failed to resolve. As a result, Robert Mugabe will be<br />
attending the Melbourne meeting this year as Prime Minister<br />
of Zimbabwe.<br />
In retrospect the Lusaka meeting stands as one of the Commonwealth's<br />
great successes. But it is worth recalling that before the event<br />
there was much gloom and doom around. Some even prophesised that<br />
the Commonwealth would break on the-rock of the Zimbabwe problem.<br />
Implicit in much of this pessimism was the suggestion that we<br />
should duck the issue, that we should not be " over ambitious"<br />
or have " delusions of grandeur"<br />
We did not heed that advice. We did not duck the issue and we<br />
were abmitious. We set out determined to make a serious contribution<br />
and we made one. As a result the Commonwealth emerged immeasurably<br />
stronger, more confident in itself and with an enhanced reputation<br />
in the eyes of others.<br />
I remind you of this not in order to score points over critics,<br />
but because I believe that the Lusaka experience contains two<br />
important lessons for us on the eve of the Commonwealth's next<br />
meeting at Melbourne. ' The first is that if the Commonwealth is<br />
to thrive, it has no choice but to engage the big issues of our<br />
time. We, its members, must not behave as if it is a side-show,<br />
restricting its efforts to peripheral mnatters. If we behave as<br />
a side-show we will be treated as one.<br />
The second, and complementary, lesson I draw from Lusaka is that<br />
we should not under-estimate the importance of our own will aln1d<br />
determination in thinking about what the Commonwealth can or cannot<br />
do. The scope for Commonwealth action is not pre-determined and<br />
fixed by some objective law. To a very considerable extent it<br />
depends on our own attitudes and commitments. Of course, there<br />
are objective limits to the role we can play, but we should not<br />
allow timidity or exaggerated modesty to circumscribe that role<br />
unnecessarily. Indeed, we should be alert to any opportunity<br />
to expand it.<br />
I make these points not only because I believe that the Commonweal. th<br />
has a future, but because there are urgent issues to be dealt with<br />
and it is important that everyone who can contribute to progress<br />
should do so. The-international community is not so well endowed<br />
with effective instrumentalities that it can afford to do without<br />
the contribution that the Commonwealth is capable of providing.<br />
This is particularly true, I believe, with respect to North-South<br />
issues. Progress on these has been languishing. over the last<br />
year, what is usually described as a dialogue has amounted to<br />
little more than acrimonious manoeuvering for position in terms<br />
of narrowly conceived self-interest. With few exceptions, there<br />
has been an absence of historical vision, of an enlightened<br />
and far-seeing sense of self-interest, of political will. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Yet the kind of world we and our children are going to live in for<br />
the rest of this century and beyond is going to depend crucially<br />
on whether there is success or failure in this area. It is forc<br />
this reason that Australia sets such store on achieving progress<br />
in restoring momentum to the process of global negotiations a<br />
process that is important both in its own right and as evidence<br />
of a positive, constructive attitude to relations between<br />
developed and developing countries.<br />
In contemplating North-South relations, it is usually the economic<br />
aspect 1which is stressed, and this is certainly very important.<br />
If we consider the two largest economies of the industrialised<br />
north, over 40 per cent of the United States' overseas trade and<br />
over 50 per cent of Japan' s is with the South. In these and the<br />
other industrialised countries, hundreds of thousands of jobs<br />
depend on that trade. Moreover, the most rapidly growing economies<br />
of the world those that provide the greatest opportunity for<br />
a rapid increase in trade are in the South. As far-as the<br />
developing countries are concerned, over 70 per cent of their<br />
trade is with the non-Communist industrialised countries, and<br />
they are also very dependent on the capital, technology and<br />
managerial skills of the North. Clearly economic interdependence<br />
is not just a slogan but a reality; and that reality means that<br />
a world divided into rich and-desperately poor countries can never<br />
be a stable, harmonious or morally acceptable world.<br />
If the economic aspect was all that was involved it would make the<br />
future of North-South relations a vitally important topic. But it<br />
is not all that is involved. Indeed, in the not so long run the<br />
political an~ d strategic dimensions of the relationship may be evenmore<br />
important.<br />
The North-South dialogue is really about the business of absorbing<br />
over a hundred new countries, countries which have come into<br />
existence with dramatic suddenness, into the international community.<br />
It is about adjusting existing processes and institutions in such a<br />
way that will accommodate the legitimate needs for status and<br />
influence of these countries, as well as provide them with the<br />
opportunity to further their material interests. It is about<br />
preventing the creation of a permanent and dangerously disaffected<br />
group of nations which feels that it has no stake in the existing<br />
order and no hope for the future.<br />
Nor can the issues be divorced from East-West tensions. The Soviet<br />
Union has a dismal and shameful record in providing development aid<br />
to the South, but strategically and militarily it i~ s constantly<br />
active in attempting to exploit frustration and instability.<br />
Sometimes it succeeds and sometimes it fails. But too much is at<br />
stake for the West to bet on a continuing high ratio of Soviet.<br />
failure. Given the distribution of the world's oil and other<br />
resources, and given also the location of. many of the key strategic<br />
" coepons in the world, a process of incremental gains by the<br />
Soviet Union would not have to go very far before it would alter the<br />
global balance. Fromn my own experience I am confident that most<br />
Third World governments recjard the Soviet Union as an unpalatable<br />
last resort so far as assistance is concerned. But I am also sure<br />
that if the situation appears hopeless and nothing else is<br />
forthcoming, many of them will turn to that last resort. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
I know that some think that the notion of a " South" or a*<br />
" Third World" is spurious. I believe that they are wrong. Despite<br />
great hetrogeneity and internal conflict there is a real sense<br />
of common identity and solidarity among these countries. While<br />
a bilateral approach to many problems is sensible, and indeed<br />
indispensable, it is a profound mistake to think that the<br />
whole question of North-South relations can be dissolved away into'<br />
a serious of bilateral issues.<br />
Again, I know that some argue that the solution to the problems<br />
of the South should be left to the operation of market forces and<br />
to the adoption of sound policies by the developing countries<br />
themselves. I believe that these are half truths. Certainly, as<br />
the experience of many of Australia's neighbours has demonstrated<br />
very convincingly, the market can provide many.. developing countries<br />
with the means of making rapid progress always assuming that<br />
the developed countries allow market forces to operate fairly.<br />
Certainly, too, sound domestic policies are an essential<br />
pre-requisite for progress in all cases. But what is essential. is<br />
not always sufficient. Quite clearly, for many developing countries<br />
more is needed if they are to hold together as viable social anid<br />
political units let alone break out of the cycle of poverty Lin<br />
which they are trapped and become active, contributing partners<br />
in the world economy. I<br />
The arcane and technical character which North-South discussions<br />
often assume must not be allowed to obscure the dramatic nature of<br />
what is at stake in the North-South dialogue. We are at a genuine<br />
turning point in modern history and statecraft of a high order is<br />
required to meet the challenge.<br />
I believe that the Commonwealth is capable of making a real<br />
contribution in this respect. At a time when the world is groping<br />
for appropriate processes and institutions to meet the need for<br />
North-South negotiations, the Commonwealth has the advantage<br />
of being already in place. We have already made the transition<br />
from a colonial to a post-colonial. world and our history has enabled<br />
us to learn many of the lessons of North-South dialogue well in<br />
advance of much of the rest of the world.<br />
Comparisons are usually invidious, but when one compares the<br />
atmosphere and procedures of the Commonwealth with those of otherinternational<br />
organisations, when one contemplates the friendly,<br />
informal and unpole mical way in which its affairs proceed, that<br />
over-worked word " unique" does not seem inappropriate.<br />
We shall be meeting in Melbourne at a time when the dialogue has<br />
been stalemated, but when some significant efforts to restore<br />
momentum and create a more positive atmosphere are under way. It<br />
seems to me that the words of the Declaration of the Ottawa Summit<br />
do represent a commitment in principle by the nations concernEd to<br />
participation in global negotiations, and-that is a significant<br />
step forward. The Mexican Summit at Cancun, which will follow<br />
immediately after the Melbourne meeting, represents another important<br />
effort to re-focus attention on North-South issues. </p>
<p>In these circumstances, and always bearing in mind the gravity<br />
and urgency of the issues, I believe it is incumbent upon-us<br />
to translate the Commonwealth's capacity into an effective<br />
contribution. As I see it we can do this in two ways. First, we<br />
can take such practical steps as are within our means to make<br />
progress on particular problems. It is true that there are somne areas<br />
where progress depends on action by the very large Western economifts.<br />
But it is also true that everything need not wait on their decision,<br />
that limited but significant steps can be taken by others. It is"<br />
not for me to pre-empt the deliberations of the Melbourne conference,<br />
but I hope that we shall explore the possibilities in this respect<br />
in a vigorous and positive spirit and that practical measures<br />
will result.<br />
Secondly, and in my mind of at least equal'importance, I think<br />
that the countries gathered at Melbourne who will, after all,<br />
represent a quarter of the world's population should find a way<br />
of declaring in the clearest and most forceful terms their<br />
conviction and determination that it is imperative that momentum<br />
be restored to the North-South dialogue. Some will call this<br />
rhetoric. Let them do so. Those who belittle the importance of<br />
rhetoric which embodies the serious purpose and conviction of<br />
countries understand little of politics. The Gettysburg Address<br />
was rhetoric. So was the Atlantic Charter and Churchill's<br />
wartime speeches. If we find the right words and if those words<br />
are an expression of real will, such a declaration will not be<br />
without effect.<br />
Mr. President, there are other important issues which will be<br />
discussed at Melbourne. One of those will certainly be the futureof<br />
Namibia. Commonwealth Governments recognise that responsibility for<br />
Namibia rests with the United Nations. In recent years, the Western<br />
members of the Security Council the members of the contact group<br />
have made a sustained effort, based on Security Council Resolution 435,<br />
to break the deadlock and bring Namibia to independence and full<br />
membership of the international community. That resolution, which<br />
remains the cornerstone of international efforts to resolve the<br />
crisis, has been accepted by all parties to the dispute. Yet after<br />
nearly three years of close consultation it remains on the<br />
drawing board.<br />
The blame for the delay in the implementation of the United Nation's<br />
plan lies fairly and squarely with the South African Government,<br />
which has temporised and procrastinated. I do not claim to be<br />
an authority on its motives, but fears have been expressed that<br />
an independent Namibia would come under direct or indirect Soviet<br />
influence. It is very relevant therefore to recall similar fears<br />
about Zimbabwe before it achieved its independence, and to contrast<br />
them with what has actually happened there since. The clear evidence<br />
in the case of Zimbabwe and elsewhere is that the rapid achievement<br />
of independence, by a process of negotiation that frustrates the<br />
intrusion of Soviet military force into th~ e situation, is the best<br />
way of preventing a country coming under Russian influence. Conversely,<br />
the longer the delay and the more the issue is allowed to fester,<br />
the more likely it is that the Soviet Union Will Succeed in gaining<br />
a IJu* r chase on the situa tion. I v~ ould, therefore, urge those<br />
Countries which have any inf]. uenCe on the Government of South Africa<br />
to bring homeo to it that its own self -inter-2sts Would be best served<br />
by rapid movement. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I certainly hope that the contact group will have achieved such<br />
movement ' between now and October. If it has not, however, I think it<br />
will be appropriate for the Commonwealth make clear its willingness<br />
to offer what assistance it can. The Commonwealth has, after all, a<br />
clear and substantial interest in the outcome. An independent<br />
Namibia would be eligible for membership of the Commonwealth and<br />
would be welcomed as such. All the African states most closely<br />
involved, apart from South Africa itself and Angola, are<br />
Commonwealth members. Two of the members of the contact group<br />
the United Kingdom and* Canada are also Commonwealth members.<br />
Given these circumstances, an offer to help in the face of<br />
continuing stalemate could not be construed as " meddling", but<br />
would be a clear expression of legitimate interest and concernL.<br />
Let me now turn to sporting contacts with South Africa. The<br />
Commonwealth's collective attitude has been clear on this question<br />
and its actions over recent years have been among its greatest:<br />
successes. It is important to understand the logic of the Commonwealth<br />
position. opposition to racial oppression is a fundamental<br />
Commonwealth principle, embodied clearly in the Declaration of'<br />
Commonwealth Principles adopted at the Heads of Government Meeting<br />
in 1971. Opposition td apartheid in South Africa clearly follows<br />
from a commitment to that principle. One of the areas afflicted by<br />
apartheid in South Africa is sport. Sport is important to<br />
South Africans. By denying the opportunity to participate in<br />
international sport, we affect them.<br />
It has therefore properly been a Commonwealth aim to sever<br />
sporting links with South Africa, an aim that was given explicit<br />
expressio~ n In the Gleneagles Declaration at the Commonwealth [ leads<br />
, of Government meeting in London in 1977.<br />
It is against this background that the current Springbok tour<br />
of New Zealand must be seen. Consistent with its adherence<br />
to the Gl. eneagles Declaration, the Government of New Zealand has<br />
expressed opposition to the tour. As the Government of a country<br />
with an honourable record on race relations it has made clear its<br />
abhorrence of apartheid.<br />
In the light of this episode, Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
cannot avoid discussion of the spirit and interpretation of<br />
Gleneagles at Melbourne. The issue of apartheid in sport is an<br />
emotive one. But precisely because of this, it is of the utmost<br />
importance that the matter be discussed dispassionately with the<br />
ultimate objective kept clearly in mind. That objective is to end<br />
the vile practice of apartheid in South Africa. It is an objective<br />
which will best be served by preservation of the Comnonwealth's<br />
great achievements in this area.<br />
The present tour is not a success for apartheid in sport. Ort<br />
the contrary it serves merely to emphasise how untenable and<br />
unacceptable it is. The only way in which apartheid could belatedly<br />
gain any benefit froin the current situiation would be for the tour to<br />
result in a damaging of the Commonealth, the organisation which is<br />
pi rhaps its m-tost effective enecmy. I.. e must not play into its handls by<br />
giving it such a victory. ./ 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
The Commonwealth has shown in the past, when potentially<br />
damaging issues have arisen that it can act with discretion and<br />
commonsense in ways that enhance the Commonwealth rather than<br />
weaken it.<br />
The Gleneagles Agreement itself was a consensus statement of<br />
vital Commonwealth principles, drawn up in private session with a<br />
real feeling of concern for the sensitivities of particular<br />
Commonwealth countries. There is no reason to believe that the<br />
Commonwealth will not approach the current issues with the same<br />
degree of sensitivity and concern and so enhance the common cause<br />
of mankind, to which we are all committed.<br />
Mr. President, a week after the royal wedding I shall be leaving<br />
for Vanuatu to attend the Annual South Pacific Forum Meeting, the<br />
third that I will have attended in the last four years. Australia<br />
attaches great importance to its near neighbours in the South West<br />
Pacific. My Government has increased Australian links with the<br />
region, and aid to it, very substantially.<br />
We are particularly pleased that all members of the Forum are<br />
also members of the Commonwealth, and that, in the form of the<br />
Regional Meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Government that<br />
were initiated in 1978, there now exists an additional forum in<br />
which they can meet other Commonwealth colleagues and discuss their<br />
problems. It is easy for larger and more established countries to<br />
forget the particular difficulties facing countries which are both<br />
very small and very new. But I can assure them that they will not be<br />
forgotten in Melbourne, and I think'that special attention should<br />
be given there to the particular problems of the isolated island<br />
states.<br />
Mr. President, from the issues I have covered and I have not<br />
attempted to be exhaustive it is clear that we shall not be short<br />
on important questions to discuss in October. Indeed, I am sure that<br />
there will be those who will be concerned to caution that we should<br />
not bite off more than we can chew, that we must be realistic.<br />
Well, I have no problem with a call for realism as long as its<br />
spiritual home is not the last ditch; as long as it does not amount<br />
to dismissing as unimportant what cannot be quantified or costed;<br />
and as long as it does not amount to another way of saying, " w: hat<br />
I have, I hold".<br />
True realism is as concerned with intangibles as with the<br />
tangibles with the aspirations and. ideals of people as well as<br />
their material needs, with what is changing and coming into existence<br />
as well as what is established. If the term is understood in this<br />
way then by all means let us approach Melbourne in a spirit<br />
of realism.<br />
In a talk he gave in Canberra during his recent visit, Secretary<br />
General Ramphal observed that this new Commonwealth we have all<br />
helped to fashion is at a high point of confidence. He spoke of<br />
its potential as a pace-setter of a new, modern and wholly<br />
respectable relationship; of its special relevance to the era<br />
of negotiations we have now entered. I endorse his words and I hope<br />
and believe that the Melbourne meeting will strengthen that: confidence<br />
still further and will consolidate the Commonwealth's claims to be<br />
an organisation which is not only valuable to its members, but which<br />
has an important contr. ibution to make to the progress of human<br />
society as a whole. / 8 </p>
<p>I 8<br />
Mr. President, in closing I should like to acknowledge a fact<br />
that all too frequently goes unacknowledged: that is that what<br />
the Commonwealth is today, and the potential it has, owes an<br />
enormous amount to Britain. This is true but in the sense that the<br />
wisdom of this country in adapting to the end of the age of<br />
imperialism made the successful evolution of the Commonwealth<br />
possible and in the sense that Britain's contribution to the<br />
contemporary Commonwealth is indispensable. Indeed, your role<br />
in world politics generally remains a very important one, and.<br />
I trust that you will continue to play it confidently and<br />
energetically. Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, may I<br />
ask you to join me in a toast to the Queen, to Prince Charles and<br />
his bride, and to the Commonwealth. 000---</p>
