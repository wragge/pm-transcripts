    <content><![CDATA[<p>In line with our election commitment, today I announce that the Government has commissioned a review of indigenous training and employment programmes.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to boosting job opportunities for indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Too often, employment and training programmes provide âtraining for trainingâs sakeâ without the practical skills that people need to fill the jobs that exist.</p>
<p>It is important that attention be given not just to skills training, but practical life education and ongoing mentoring to make sure jobs are lasting and careers are developed for indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>This review will provide recommendations to ensure indigenous training and employment services are targeted and administered to connect unemployed indigenous people with real and sustainable jobs.</p>
<p>It will consider ways that training and employment services can better link to the commitment of employers to provide sustainable employment opportunities for indigenous people and end the cycle of indigenous disadvantage.</p>
<p>Australians yearn to see practical and genuine improvement in the lives of Aboriginal people.</p>
<p>There is so much goodwill. The challenge, though, is to convert good intentions into practical change for the better.</p>
<p>The Review of Indigenous Training and Employment will be chaired by Mr Andrew Forrest with policy and administrative support from my Department.</p>
<p>My Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon. Alan Tudge MP, will guide and shape the Review process with Mr Forrest.</p>
<p>The Review will also work closely with the Governmentâs Indigenous Advisory Council and will report to me by 7 April 2014.</p>
<p>8 October 2013</p>
