FOR PRESS: J ll 1968 P. M. No. 65/ 1968<br />
DEATH OF SIR WALTER NASH<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister today paid the following tribute to the<br />
former New Zealand Prime Minister, Sir Walter Nash, who died yesterday<br />
( Tuesday):-" On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia<br />
I convey deep regret at the passing of so prominent a<br />
figure as Sir Walter Nash. Sir Walter was a notable New<br />
Zealand Statesman, well known and greatly respected in<br />
many countries. Successive Australian Prime Ministers<br />
and Ministers found Sir Walter a friendly man in discussion<br />
and a man of high principle and dedication to his country and<br />
the cause which he sponsored. I and my colleagues send<br />
deepest sympathy to the family."<br />
