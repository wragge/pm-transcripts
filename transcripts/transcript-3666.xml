AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE MEETING<br />
4 The Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr Whitlam, announced today that the Australian/ Japan<br />
Ministerial Committee will meet in Canberra on 2 and 3 May 1975.<br />
The meeting will be the third in a series of annual Ministerial<br />
* consultations between Australia and Japan. The first was held<br />
in Canberra in 1972, and the second took place in Tokyo in 1973.<br />
The Australian delegation will be led by the Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, who will also chair the<br />
meeting. Mr Whitlaxn said that as he would be absent at the<br />
Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Jamaica at the<br />
time the Committee would be meeting, he had asked Dr Cairns, who<br />
will be Acting Prime Minister at the time, to open the Committee<br />
officially on his behalf. In addition to Dr Cairns and Senator<br />
Willesee, other Australian Ministers taking part in the meeting<br />
will include the Minister for Overseas Trade ( 14r Crean), the<br />
minister for Minerals and Energy ( Mr Connor) and the Minister<br />
for Agriculture ( Senator Wriedt).<br />
The Japanese delegation will be led by the Foreign<br />
Minister, Mr Kuchi Miyazawa, who will be making his first visit<br />
to Australia since joining the Japanese Cabinet. Other Ministers<br />
in the Japanese delegation will include the Minister for<br />
International Trade and Industry ( Mr Toshio Komoto) and the<br />
Minister for Agriculture and Forestry ( Mr Shintaro Abe). The<br />
Japanese delegation is also expected to include two very senior<br />
officials from the Finance Ministry and Economic Planning Agency.<br />
The agenda will cover, following a keynote address by<br />
Dr Cairns, discussion of a broad range of issues, including<br />
international and national economic and financial matters, bilateral<br />
and multilateral trade questions and related topics of mutual<br />
interest. </p>
