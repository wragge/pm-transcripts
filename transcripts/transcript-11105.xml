<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, welcome home.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good day, how are you Neil?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'm well thank you. At least we gave the Yanks one back for the lamb</p>
<p> in the Davis Cup defeat.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was great, I saw the first day and Hewitt and Rafter were fantastic</p>
<p> and the surrounds of thousands of cheering Americans made me more</p>
<p> energetic in my support.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Tell me, did you get a bit annoyed when Bill Clinton left you standing</p>
<p> out in the rain all alone for a press conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't expect that he'd go to that news conference because he'd</p>
<p> have been on a hiding to nothing. The Australian press would have</p>
<p> peppered him with a whole lot of questions about lamb. I didn't expect</p>
<p> that he would join me. I asked him to but I didn't think he would.</p>
<p> Look the Americans did us in the eye over lamb and we made it very</p>
<p> plain that we were very unhappy. It was a domestic political consideration</p>
<p> and America is so big and strong and when it decides that it's going</p>
<p> to do something for a domestic political reason it really rolls over</p>
<p> everybody.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How did you get on with him, OK?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I get on with him quite well but I disagreed with him on this issue.</p>
<p> I think he's misunderstood just how strong is the feeling in Australia,</p>
<p> but at the end of the day he owed people domestically and that's why</p>
<p> he took the decision that he did, I mean there's no point in beating</p>
<p> about the bush. It's a lousy decision; it's quite indefensible on</p>
<p> trade grounds. It was induced entirely by domestic political considerations.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But we won - we beat them in the Davis Cup.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We did beat them in the David Cup and the other thing I should say</p>
<p> is that our trade to America overall rose by thirty four per cent</p>
<p> in 1998, but that is cold comfort to our very efficient lamb producers.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Now, poker machines. The Premier here has declared a cap of 27,500</p>
<p> in Victoria, is that still too many?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think we have far too many poker machines in Australia. I</p>
<p> don't have an overnight solution but .</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think Victoria has too many?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Australia has too many, therefore that includes Victoria, of</p>
<p> course it does. I mean everybody's in the same boat on this, well</p>
<p> look, but really.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But New South Wales has a hell of a lot more..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>..I'm the Prime Minister of the whole country, I do not want to get</p>
<p> - much as all as the Premier keeps throwing in this nonsense about</p>
<p> Sydney-centricity - I don't want to get into a slanging match between</p>
<p> Sydney and Melbourne or New South Wales and Victoria on this issue.</p>
<p> It is a broad national problem and I'm not particularly proud of the</p>
<p> fact that Australia has, with a population of just under 19 million</p>
<p> people, has 21 per cent of the world's poker machines. I mean I'm</p>
<p> proud of some of our records in most fields, but that is something</p>
<p> of which I'm quite ashamed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So you'd like to see them reduced across the board.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would like, I don't know how it's done, but I think we gamble too</p>
<p> much and that does cause social problems, and that may not be a popular</p>
<p> thing to say, but it happens to be true and just as political figures</p>
<p> are meant to take leads in relation to other social ills such as excessive</p>
<p> drinking and too much smoking, then obviously there is a concern in</p>
<p> this area. Now I don't have the solution to it at my fingertips.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well what about the suggestion that came up yesterday about a restriction</p>
<p> on gambling advertisers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's obviously something in that and I notice that Jeff Kennett</p>
<p> has had some comments to make about that and that's fine.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's pretty enticing stuff isn't it? I mean that's the nature of advertising.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, of course, of course it is. Now we as a community have resolved</p>
<p> to take very strong action in relation to advertising for cigarettes,</p>
<p> and nobody seems to object to that as a mode of government and community</p>
<p> intervention, and cigarette companies may, and I understand for commercial</p>
<p> reasons why they might do it, but the rest of the community supports</p>
<p> it, and that has over time made a difference. We're probably in advance</p>
<p> of many other countries with which we are normally compared in that</p>
<p> area. Now..</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So you think we should look at the (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we have to, I think the first thing to do is to recognise</p>
<p> that there is now indisputable evidence that some people's lives are</p>
<p> ruined and destroyed and there's a lot of human misery inflicted on</p>
<p> them and their families by excessive gambling. Now I don't care about</p>
<p> people who can afford to gamble, I don't care for a moment about people</p>
<p> who gamble in moderation. I do not want wowser-like to prohibit gambling</p>
<p> altogether, that's not my argument at all, but you would be absolutely</p>
<p> insensitive to reality if you didn't accept that this is a big social</p>
<p> problem for some people. It's a social problem for the community and</p>
<p> we have to find, co-operatively, a way of addressing it. Now that's</p>
<p> what I'm saying, I don't pretend for a moment that I have the solutions</p>
<p> at my fingertips.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well restricting advertising is one way, another area might be to</p>
<p> advertise more about the dangers of gambling.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is another way.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Could the Federal Government get - the States are in this difficult</p>
<p> position where they probably don't want to advertise all that much</p>
<p> about the dangers because they rely so much on the income.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's something for which they have a primary responsibility,</p>
<p> but I'm not saying that in a political sense of trying to fix them</p>
<p> with the only responsibility. But it is of course primarily a matter</p>
<p> within their regulatory remit and the Premier made that observation</p>
<p> yesterday. Now that doesn't mean to say that the Federal Government</p>
<p> doesn't have role, it doesn't mean to say that we shouldn't have a</p>
<p> view, in fact this Productivity Commission examination which has really</p>
<p> laid bare in a very stark and political way the facts about gambling</p>
<p> in Australia was initiated by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And you copped a bit of stick for it too.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We did, and I don't apologise for having initiated it. I think we've</p>
<p> done the community a service in revealing in quite a clinical fashion</p>
<p> the extent of the problem. You see in the past, most of the people</p>
<p> who talked about gambling tended to come from churches or the welfare</p>
<p> sector and people said : oh well they're just being, you know, do-gooders,</p>
<p> they're being wowsers, they're being this that and the other. Now</p>
<p> what you've got, on top of that you've now got the 'pointy heads'</p>
<p> if you like, coming to the same conclusion, and that's a fairly significant</p>
<p> alliance and I don't think it can be and I don't think it should be</p>
<p> ignored and it confirms the view that a number of us had and I think</p>
<p> the people in the community have now - it's not something that can</p>
<p> be fixed overnight and I'm not holding myself out as having any particular</p>
<p> capacity or any particular solutions but the responsibility of somebody</p>
<p> like myself is to recognise the social problem, express a point of</p>
<p> view about it and then work with relevant people to see what can sensibly</p>
<p> be done to ameliorate the problem.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And those are the sort of areas you'd look at are they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they are some of the areas, but I don't at this stage want to</p>
<p> say, well I'm going to do this, this, this and this and not do that,</p>
<p> that and that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What about the issue the States' reliance on gambling. Victoria in</p>
<p> particular, I mean fifteen per cent of the budget is gambling revenue.</p>
<p> Is that too much?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let's not sort of drift into a headline on "Howard says</p>
<p> this or that about Victoria's revenue raising".</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but I mean if it comes back to you if the revenue drops</p>
<p> (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know, but it's not just a revenue thing it is a social behavioural</p>
<p> thing and the devastation that is caused for some people by excessive</p>
<p> gambling upsets me a lot and it should upset the whole community and</p>
<p> just as we seek to help people who've got a drug problem then we ought</p>
<p> to help people who've got a gambling problem.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think it's in the same sort of category? Well the same sort</p>
<p> of level, the same sort of extent? The drug problem gets a lot of</p>
<p> attention.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the number of, the total number of heroin users in Australia</p>
<p> is I understand two per cent and the people who have a profound social</p>
<p> problem from gambling according to the Productivity Commission report</p>
<p> is something in the order of two to two-and-a- half per cent. So I</p>
<p> mean they are different issues and they have to be tackled in different</p>
<p> ways, but the point I'm simply making is that where you have a social</p>
<p> problem, governments have some responsibility to do what they can</p>
<p> to tackle it. Now I don't want to raise expectations that I've got</p>
<p> a solution but it's not good enough for somebody in my position just</p>
<p> to walk away and say oh well, people gamble out of choice and that's</p>
<p> it. People who'd . if you'd have said that about smoking thirty years</p>
<p> ago you would never have done anything to try and reduce the incidence,</p>
<p> particularly amongst young men and women.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take calls for the Prime Minister in a moment, 9696 1278, I</p>
<p> wanted to ask you about the health meeting on today Mr Howard. All</p>
<p> the States including your own members of your own political persuasion</p>
<p> are saying Medicare's badly broken, it's not working. You still stand</p>
<p> by it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't agree with them. I think there are defects in Australia's</p>
<p> health system but it's better than any in the world. And I'd rather</p>
<p> get a - a battler is better getting sick in Brunswick than the Bronx</p>
<p> and the reality is that this country's health system -for all its</p>
<p> flaws - is better than most and we stand by the Medicare system. That</p>
<p> doesn't mean to say it can't be improved, but it doesn't mean to say</p>
<p> that there are significant flaws, but..</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well there are all these ideas coming up for improvement, they're</p>
<p> pretty dramatic.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They're also very confusing and very contradictory. If you said to</p>
<p> me as of sixteen minutes to nine, now what is the attitude of the</p>
<p> State Governments, well I wouldn't really know because they are very</p>
<p> different. Now I want to, I'm always ready and happy to talk to State</p>
<p> Premiers, but I don't think it helps on an issue as important as this</p>
<p> for the ad-hoc generation of crisis headlines every few months. Over</p>
<p> the last fifteen months the Federal Government has made three very</p>
<p> important announcements for health, to strengthen our health system.</p>
<p> We've increased dramatically the funding for the States by three per</p>
<p> cent in real terms each year over five years. We've put $1.5 billion</p>
<p> or more into incentives for private health insurance and we have also</p>
<p> promised in the last Federal Budget to double spending on health and</p>
<p> medical research in this country.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But the states really are effectively saying that's all wasted because</p>
<p> it's not working. They're saying...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they're wrong in saying that. Nobody could possibly and seriously</p>
<p> argue that doubling expenditure on health and medical research in</p>
<p> this country is wasted. I mean I have had from every one of the great</p>
<p> medical institutes in Australia, particularly from those in Melbourne</p>
<p> which of course is in a sense the national centre, the national capital</p>
<p> of medical research in Australia and it has some world famous institutes.</p>
<p> I've had nothing but total support and praise for the Government's</p>
<p> commitment in that area.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If it is run down, the States run it down, I mean I've seen argument</p>
<p> from your Federal Minister that States have cut so much out of it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is true in a number of cases, yes, that is true. Now look</p>
<p> we don't like in a sense making those points but you have to understand</p>
<p> that no self respective federal government is going to sit by and</p>
<p> allow itself every few months to become the punching bag for alleged</p>
<p> deficiencies in state health services. Now, I accept that not all</p>
<p> is well. I accept that there are flaws there are deficiencies, there</p>
<p> are areas where improvements can be made. But I do not believe it</p>
<p> is accurate, nor do I believe it is helpful for there to be a campaign</p>
<p> of crisis inducement as far as the atmosphere surrounding health delivery</p>
<p> in this country is concerned because there is a lot about our health</p>
<p> system that is working extremely well. We have marvellous doctors,</p>
<p> terrific nurses and some terrific public and private facilities. I</p>
<p> think we have to take the temperature out of the debate, we have to</p>
<p> try as far as possible to extract it from the cross fire of political</p>
<p> exchange at both the federal and state levels and sensibly discuss</p>
<p> areas where improvements can be made. I want to make it very clear</p>
<p> we are not going to dismantle Medicare.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>That's what I was going to ask, there's no question of Medicare goes..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's no way we're going to dismantle Medicare. The Liberal party</p>
<p> at a federal level years ago had a different view about the operation</p>
<p> of Medicare. Before the change of Government in 1996 we made a very</p>
<p> careful examination of this and we committed ourselves in that campaign</p>
<p> to maintain Medicare. We said we'd seek to improve and strengthen</p>
<p> it and we didn't rule out changes that were consistent with the maintenance</p>
<p> of Medicare and we've made many..</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What about the Medicare levy? Is that high enough?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we don't have any plan to raise it. I can give no other answer</p>
<p> than that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a couple of quick calls, Merle hello, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil. I just wanted to make a quick comment about the</p>
<p> poker machines. They've been in NSW I think for anything up to 40</p>
<p> years.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>43 years.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well there you are. I'm a constant visitor to NSW Sydney, my sister</p>
<p> was very much addicted, I got swept in there, I think they're very</p>
<p> boring. But I believe there's not enough responsibility put on the</p>
<p> individual, no matter who it is in whatever walk of life. We always</p>
<p> seem to want to blame somebody else or something else but I think</p>
<p> that it is an individual choice and I mix with a lot of people and</p>
<p> nobody goes playing poker machines.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well I think you're mad to play poker machines.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Ever played one?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think once about 30 years ago. I think they are boring and I can't</p>
<p> understand how anybody would want to..I mean I am not a gambler but</p>
<p> I don't seek to impose that view on other people.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think you are a wowser Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't but I am a concerned citizen about the human misery that's</p>
<p> inflicted on some people.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Brian, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity to speak to you Mr Howard. You</p>
<p> referred to poker machines or gambling as a social problem.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Excessive gambling.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I see it as an economic problem especially for small business</p>
<p> because it's inarguable that every dollar that goes through a poker</p>
<p> machine is a dollar out of a retailers till and from personal experience</p>
<p> I've seen many many small businesses going under and it can be attributed</p>
<p> only to poker machines.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I know that's a widely held view and I guess intuitively I would</p>
<p> have held that view too although I'm bound to say in the interest</p>
<p> of objectivity that the Productivity Commission's report was not as</p>
<p> strong in finding that as you and I might have suspected. Now they</p>
<p> acknowledge that there was some impact but they weren't as strong</p>
<p> in that area as you and I might have expected but my intuition has</p>
<p> been and I guess is still the same as yours.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thanks Brian. Thank you for calling, we'll take a quick break and</p>
<p> come back with more with the Prime Minister in a moment.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is on the line from Newcastle. Mr Howard, some</p>
<p> of the first Kosovo refugees leave the country today. I'm told 1,000,</p>
<p> as many as 1,000 want to stay permanently. Is there a chance they'll</p>
<p> be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I guess we'll sort of look sensibly as far as we can at each</p>
<p> case. The general view was taken when we accepted them that they were</p>
<p> here for temporary safe haven purposes and we're reluctant to alter</p>
<p> that but in all of these things we'll try and behave in a sensitive</p>
<p> sensible fashion.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So it's a possibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well yes but I </p>
