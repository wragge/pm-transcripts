    <content><![CDATA[<p>The suggestion by the Queensland Premier that the Australian Government is not genuine in wanting to reach an agreement with the Queensland Government on land clearing is wrong.</p>
<p>The Australian Government wants a package that respects the rights of landholders, given they will be most affected by any agreement.</p>
<p>The landholder representative organisation AgForce has brought forward an alternative proposal on land clearing to the one proposed by the Queensland Government.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is currently in discussions with AgForce and we are prepared to exchange information to facilitate the consideration of their proposal.</p>
<p>We have asked AgForce to also talk to the Queensland Government about their alternative.</p>
<p>With a constructive approach between governments and stakeholders, I believe progress can be made on this important issue.</p>
<p>We remain committed to providing $75 million towards achieving a fair and balanced outcome and one which meets our greenhouse and biodiversity objectives, in cooperation with landholders.  </p>
