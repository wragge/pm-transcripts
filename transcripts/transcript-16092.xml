    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education officially launched National Literacy and Numeracy Week 2008 by announcing a $40 million literacy and numeracy initiative.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will invest $40.2 million in 29 literacy and numeracy pilot projects in schools across Australia.</p>
<p>These pilots will trial or expand initiatives that exemplify strategies to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes for those students most in need of support, in government and non-government schools.</p>
<p>Pilots were selected because they focus on reforms that will deliver sustained improvements in literacy and numeracy for students, particularly for low SES, Indigenous or disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>Government, Independent and Catholic education authorities were invited to submit proposals for pilot programs by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in June 2008.</p>
<p>This funding is available from 2008 and will support pilots for up to two years and negotiations with successful education authorities will be finalised this month.</p>
<p>Getting the basics right at school is fundamental to helping all Australian students reach their full potential.</p>
<p>These pilot programs will guide literacy and numeracy reform by developing and sharing an evidence-base of what works.</p>
<p>National Literacy and Numeracy Week is an Australian Government initiative that runs from 1-7 September which aims to raise community awareness of the importance of developing effective literacy and numeracy skills for all Australians.</p>
