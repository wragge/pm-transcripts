    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Ministerâs Christmas Tree will again support the Kmart Wishing Tree Appeal.Â </p>
<p>Right up until Christmas Eve, visitors and guests to the Prime Ministerâs office will be encouraged to bring a gift to place under the tree and help provide a happier Christmas for thousands of Australian children and families.</p>
<p>Over six million gifts have been donated since the Kmart Wishing Tree was established 27 years ago. Last year alone, nearly 500,000 gifts were distributed by the Salvation Army to all corners of the continent.</p>
<p>The target for 2014 is 500,000 gifts by Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>I hope that Senators, Members of Parliament, parliamentary staff, the Press Gallery, broader diplomatic corps in Canberra and visitors to Parliament House can play a part in reaching that total.</p>
