The Government has decided on the following arrangements in relation to tariffs and the motor<br />

The current schedule for PMV tariff phasing will continue through to 2000<br />

for the next 5 years.<br />
-there will be no differentiation for micro/ light vehicles and four wheel drive<br />
vehicles. Light commercial vehicles will remain at 5 per cent.<br />
The Government will legislate forthwith for the tariff to be reduced to l0 per cent on<br />
1 January 2005.<br />
There will be a review in 2005 which will take account of our APEC commuitments and<br />

A WTO-consistent program will be introduced to replace the Export Facilitation Scheme when<br />
it expires in 2000 and will run to 2005.<br />
The Duty Free Allowance will continue at 15 per cent.<br />
The Government will introduce a market access strategy including the establishment of a new<br />
Automotive Trade Council, the appointment of a specialist trade access negotiator and a<br />
market development package worth $ 20 million over four years.<br />
There will also be an environmental strategy, including measures to phase out the use of leaded<br />
fuel by 20 10 and the development of an industry code of environmental performance.<br />
