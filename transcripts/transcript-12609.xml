<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Richard.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>A nice day to have. Blue skies above us and good celebrations to have in the middle of town, so to speak.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it is. It';s quite a sparkling winter';s day in Canberra. I';m pleased about that because each of these events are important. Certainly the opening of Reconciliation Place, which I hope will provide a focal point, a gathering point for many people who want to emphasise the shared history of all Australians. This place contains a number of depictions – an acknowledgement of the contribution of indigenous people to our nation and other representations and depictions will be added as time goes by. But it is a genuine gesture to recognise the shared history, but also of course to recognise that there were a lot of sad things that occurred in our past and we shouldn';t hide those, but we should however emphasise the things that we have in common and the future that we all share together.</p>
<p> PERNOT:</p>
<p>Certainly. Prime Minister, I';ve had several calls from the Ngunnawal people who I believe will be having a smoking ceremony before it';s all underway. Some of them say that this smoking ceremony isn';t part of the Ngunnawal tradition. So there seems to be still division in the indigenous ranks themselves and that poses a problem, doesn';t it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';m not in the mood today to focus on division. I don';t know that I want to comment on that. The smoking ceremony is something that is used quite frequently before major events in Canberra and I have certainly understood it to be something that most indigenous people appreciate very much.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Can you tell me about this Centenary of Federation gift to us given by Canada? What';s the Speakers' Square?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it';s a square that sort of represents the shared history, or the shared values if you like, of Australia and Canada. It joins together some depictions of the constellations of the northern skies and southern skies, which of course bring together Canada and Australia. And I think it';s great that we have an opportunity of opening these three important areas. Commonwealth Place of course will be… it';s closer to the lake, will be a focal point for a lot of concerts and other gatherings and it';s also likely I understand to house the offices of Reconciliation Australia, which is the non-Government body formed to carry on the work of reconciliation between Aboriginal Australians and other Australians after the termination of the 10 year legislative remit, if I can put it that way, of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Sure. Is this Speakers' Square similar to what I know up in the Domain Prime Minister, the soap box type of thing? Is that the…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I guess in the end it will be what people make it.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Hopefully, and this is the freedom of the country isn';t it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well indeed.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>We';re able to get up and say what we feel.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly, and long may it remain that way.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Okay and that';s the significance of Reconciliation Place is it not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Reconciliation Place is a bit more than that. It';s an opportunity to… right in the centre of the symbolic life of the nation, right in the middle between the Gallery and the High Court, it occupies a very important place. And it says how important, how fundamental the indigenous people are to the history of this country. It reminds us of their difficulties and it reminds of their history. But importantly, it tells us that we have a shared history, and even more importantly, a shared future.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Indeed. Even when Captain Phillip as you know in your history Prime Minister arrived, he had a great association with the indigenous around Sydney Harbour. They helped him explore the territory and even helped him out with food sources. We certainly have a partnership. And today';s a day to celebrate and certainly not to bring up old wounds.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly it';s an occasion to be realistic. There were wrongs committed and we shouldn';t ignore that. And it is not ignored. But very importantly, we have a future together and that';s the purpose of this place.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>I do appreciate your time. Enjoy the day. It';s sunny skies. Did you get the walk in this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I did indeed. It was a bit cold. It was –2 but I still got it in.</p>
<p>PERNOT:</p>
<p>Okay. Nice to talk with you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
