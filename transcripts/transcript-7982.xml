TRAkNSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JaNA WENDT, a CURRENT<br />
AFFAIR, 21 MRCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, thank you very much for your time.<br />
PM: Pleasure, Jana.<br />
WENDT: Are we on the brink of a recession?<br />
PM: No. If you use the economists' analysis you have<br />
two quarters of negative growth. Last quarter, the one<br />
before this one just coming up today, 0.9 percent for the<br />
quarter growth, this one, minus 0.2, so we had one<br />
quarter and this quarter is a 0.9 statistical discrepancy<br />
which, when it's rectified could have you in positive<br />
movement. So technically, no, and in terms of the<br />
assessment of the market, no.<br />
WENDT: Would a recession be proof of the failure of your<br />
economic policies?<br />
PM: No. What I'm saying right up till now and which I<br />
continue to say is that we've had a problem of excessive<br />
growth that's why we had to have tight monetary policy<br />
WENDT: OK, but if the recession occurred, if we're in<br />
one now which as the Opposition is saying and as some of<br />
those economists are saying will that be proof of<br />
PM: No economist has said we' re in a recession yet.<br />
What is, is technically you have two quarters of negative<br />
growth, we haven't had that, we've had to slow the<br />
economy down, but what we've had now is a big movement<br />
into more exports and a reduction of imports precisely<br />
what we've got to do to reap what your listeners are<br />
concerned about and that's the external debt.<br />
WENDT: Prime Minister, I want to say what, what I'm<br />
asking you. If we were to strike a recession, would that<br />
be proof of a failure of your policies?<br />
PM: No, if we were to get two quarters of negative<br />
growth and that were sustained it would show, yes, there<br />
is a recession in the technical sense. But what I am </p>
<p>saying is we haven't got there. I don't believe we will<br />
and we've got to slow the economy down anyway. That's<br />
what people want, they want to see our external problem<br />
dealt with.<br />
WENDT: You've just seen a representative of small<br />
business say that around half of Australia's 750,000<br />
small businesses are in real trouble. Do you accept that<br />
that's a result, a direct result, of your policies?<br />
PM: I don't accept that that is accurate. What we've<br />
got is a position where those businesses, over this whole<br />
period of seven years, have shared in this enormous<br />
increase in employment, big increase in profits. They've<br />
been part of that and that, as they've been part of the<br />
growth, and as we've expanded too much as an economy in<br />
the last year, they've had to take their share of the<br />
slowing down. I mean, you can't have it both ways.<br />
WENDT: Yes, but Mr Hawke, it's more serious than that.<br />
You've just seen shop after shop after shop closing down.<br />
That's on an average street in an average suburb in<br />
Australia. PM: Well, the alternative would be this. If you really<br />
wanted to ruin this economy, what we could have done is<br />
to say alright, we'll have easy monetary policy, we'll<br />
just have an even greater binge on consumption. If we'd<br />
allowed that to happen, the economy would have done what<br />
it did at the end of the conservatives' reign. We would<br />
have had the worst recession in 50 years. Now I wasn't<br />
prepared to do that. I've had to take some tough<br />
decisions. WENDT: But are those closures the result of Hawke's<br />
economic policies?<br />
PM: The slowing down of activity is a deliberate<br />
outcome of the fact of a tightened monetary policy. The<br />
alternative was for the whole economy to collapse.<br />
WENDT: But for you, you call it a slowing down of<br />
economic activity and sure that's what it is. For those<br />
people, it's flesh and blood and money and<br />
PM: But what it would have been, it would have been more<br />
than that. It would have been more than that for more<br />
people. If we hadn't had tight monetary policy, then the<br />
economy would have collapsed completely, collapsed<br />
completely. Now what just let me tell you what the,<br />
what the market is saying about what's happened. I mean,<br />
this is the Reuters screen last night, just let me read<br />
this what they're saying is credit market at the end<br />
of the day in anticipation of a further easing in<br />
monetary policy in the next few weeks assuming, this is<br />
what the market said, assuming the Hawke Labor Government<br />
is re-elected at Saturday's federal election, the only </p>
<p>way we're going to get rates down is with the re-election<br />
of the Hawke Government.<br />
WENDT: OK, well you quote to me, I can quote to you. We<br />
approached, as we mentioned in the story, four major<br />
banks. PM: Yes.<br />
WENDT: One economist told us, yes, we are facing a<br />
recession. The other three told us we are in for a hard<br />
landing. PM: Well, that's not the, not the consensus of the<br />
economic profession generally because what they are<br />
saying, the overwhelming majority have said we are in for<br />
a soft landing and the markets are saying, and there it<br />
was that I've quoted from, they are expecting if the<br />
Hawke Government gets re-elected, a lowering of interest<br />
rates. And that's what will happen.<br />
WENDT: Election campaigns are about communicating to the<br />
people who'll be voting for you on Saturday or not voting<br />
for you. Do you think you can make this message plain<br />
that you are giving me to the people who've had to close,<br />
close their businesses?<br />
PM: Well, I hope so, Jana. I mean, it is a reasonably<br />
complex message but the simple fact is, if I can put it<br />
this way to your listeners and not use economic jargon,<br />
we were expanding that rapidly that we were consuming<br />
eight percent increase, we were producing four percent<br />
increase and that gap, we were importing and that was<br />
wiping up our external deficit. We had to slow things<br />
down and these last accounts that are out today show that<br />
we've got it back in to kilter. The increase in<br />
consumption is the same as the increase in production,<br />
but importantly the production now has been channelled<br />
into exports against imports. That's the turnaround.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, it's a happy picture that you paint,<br />
but it contradicts what people are telling us, what I'm<br />
sure you hear in the streets<br />
PM: But Jana, I'm sorry I'm not trying to say I never<br />
have and in my policy speech I made it clear I know<br />
that good Australians have suffered. A lot of them, a<br />
lot of them. Because we've had to slow things down. I'm<br />
not trying to say there are not people out there hurting,<br />
I know that are. But I had to take the tough decision<br />
either we did slow the economy down from its too rapid a<br />
growth, it was just going like that, either I took the<br />
tough which meant there was some pain or, if I hadn't<br />
done that, then we really went in to the sort of<br />
recession which the Liberals gave us just before I came<br />
into office. </p>
<p>WENDT: Are you accepting then that you have lost some<br />
people in delivering that message those people who have<br />
had to close the doors of their businesses you've lost<br />
them? PM: Well, I don't know, I guess some of them yes, I<br />
guess some of them. But I also think because I<br />
basically have faith in the Australian people I think<br />
that in the end that people are going to say, on the<br />
24th, OK, Hawkey's made it tough, I understand, a lot of<br />
them are going to say I understand why but they're not<br />
going to like it. But the simple fact is this, and this<br />
is what the market knows that's why they say rates will<br />
come down if Hawke's re-elected that Peacock policy is<br />
a wages explosion and blow the budget surplus, because<br />
he's got seven billion dollars in unfunded promises. If<br />
you have a wages explosion and you blow the budget<br />
surplus then, you do have a repetition of what they<br />
gave Australia in 82/ 83.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, did you back away yesterday from a<br />
suggestion that you'd be able to bring about a two per<br />
cent fall in<br />
PM: No, what I<br />
WENDT: interest rates, did you back away from it<br />
because you knew you couldn't deliver it?<br />
PM: No, what I said at the Press Club today was, I was<br />
asked about it, I said I got into a parenthesis about<br />
John Howard when I'd seen that John Howard has said two<br />
per cent. It would have been wiser on my part if I<br />
hadn't referred to John Howard. I've said consistently,<br />
and I say again now, that when we win we will be able to<br />
go to the Reserve Bank and say all the evidence is of the<br />
slowdown, there should be now a lowering, a further<br />
lowering of prime rates and then that goes into the other<br />
rates, the retail rates. And that's what I've said and,<br />
fortunately, all the industry and the market is saying<br />
that's what will happen provided and they're putting<br />
the proviso on it it will happen if the Hawke<br />
Government is re-elected.<br />
WENDT: Do you think that if people believe that you're<br />
painting an all too rosy picture<br />
PM: No, I'm not trying to do that.<br />
WENDT: Well that is the impression<br />
PM: Well, I mean I've just said..<br />
WENDT: that some people have.<br />
PM: Well, it's a wrong impression. Now look, I have put<br />
it straight to the Australian people. I've said, not<br />
only in this election campaign Jana, I've said it a </p>
<p>number of times and I take this opportunity now of<br />
saying, directly to your viewers that I'm not a masochist<br />
and I'm not a sadist. I don't want to hurt them. I've<br />
been thirty years in public life the whole of my adult<br />
life has been in public life working for Australia and<br />
Australians. I wouldn't want to hurt them, I would never<br />
hurt them deliberately. But I've created, with my<br />
Government, jobs at a rate that have never been created<br />
before five times faster than before and twice as fast<br />
as the rest of the world. That's what we've done we've<br />
got investment at record levels but we went that fast,<br />
that it was creating an external problem. And I've had<br />
to slow things down a bit. And I know, I mean, Jana,<br />
believe me I know, that some people have been hurt in<br />
that process. But the alternative would have been the<br />
collapse of the economy, and while my opponents are<br />
prepared to let that happen, I'm not.<br />
WENDT: Well Mr Hawke, I'm afraid we will have to leave<br />
it there. Thank you for your time tonight.<br />
PM: It's been a pleasure Jana, thank you very much.<br />
ends </p>
