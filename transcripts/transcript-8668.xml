1. Prime M$ nister, what'i your reaction, it I could, st to the MaatfichtL. vote in<br />
France?<br />
PM-I think, while a narrow mnajcuity, it'% a positive decision by the people of France.<br />
which is of coUrse one of the major continental Furopean countries And it will<br />
mean, T think. a more orderly sped, A more orderly transition to a unified Europe.<br />
So it's very significant Wndit should be signiflant also In the finanCial markets for'<br />
what is obviously a shorter termo upheaval of the last week or two, but in the long<br />
run, this will have long run implications for the financial community.<br />
i Was the decision rais. ed in discussions this morning with discussions with Mr<br />
Watanabe?<br />
PM. Yes. Ithink in Jlapan they would prefer to see this happen. They regard it as a<br />
positive thing, and again I think they share my view that it will see a more rapid<br />
and more orderly transition to a unified Europe.<br />
J: Should it also help to unlock the Uraguay Round?<br />
P\ 1M T think it will have good psychological influences worldwide, in Europe The<br />
Round is diffierent It has other connotations anid effects about it, but the Round is<br />
just as important orcourse as thuis decision by rthe F'rench. But it's got to be, I<br />
think, a bull point in markets and people generally concluding that progress is<br />
being made in the development of a unified European mark~ et, and this can<br />
probably have good influences on the GATT.<br />
I. Mr Keating, did you get any indication this morning about what the Japanese<br />
would like to ee the Blundesbank do on monetary policy!<br />

PM-No, I didn't. These things are all short term things and there's not a lot of point,<br />
particularly, in me discussing short term movements in interest rates and things.<br />
J. Comning to bilateral issues, this morning how did the talks go and what did you<br />
discuss?<br />
PM-I think the overwhelming impression one has is the relaxed nature and friendliness<br />
of discussions. I've just concluded quite a long mneeting with Mr Watanabe, the<br />
Minister for International Trade and Industry, and Mr Nod&amp;, from the Economic<br />
Planninig Agency which puts the Budget together. They are very keen to get their<br />
economy growing again, they are quite proud of their fiscal package, they think<br />
they've done the right thing at the right time, and so do 1, 1 agree, as you know rye<br />
made comments in Australia about that. There is a lot of flux in international trade<br />
and international trade angements, and they're interested in our views, and I<br />
think they're also interested in our cooperation and support which theyve just<br />
experienced in the last week or so in APEC again, and they see us as a solid and<br />
valuable friend.<br />
1: What discussions about APEC. Prime Mnister?<br />
PSI. There's an APEC meeting just corncluded. and again Australia and Japan have<br />
played amongst others a leading role in those negotiations and discussions. I think<br />
they attach considerable importance to APEC and to the role of countries in the<br />
Asia-Paciflc area.<br />
J: Did you raise any concerns about access for Australian products to Japan, Mr<br />
Keating?<br />
PM; Yes. I raised a couple of bilateral issues. The first was about the Japanese<br />
economy, economic influences around the wovid. And the second, about somne<br />
bilateral matters the kiFP for instance, for which I had a very positive response.<br />
further collaborative lhirigs in' Japan, the cooperation orMIT! arnd developing with<br />
us at consulate , iystem in Japan which can advance the distribution and access by<br />
Australian companies to the Japanese market. And Mr Watanabe gave me very<br />
strons assurances about the suppot-t of NGTI, and that's confirmed by our offcials.<br />
But also a good, valuable. 1; eneral discussion about international trade influences.<br />
mnultilateral issues NAFTA_. the Huh and Spoke% proposal of President Bush in<br />
Detroit, for bilateral trade arrangemients and what they mean. what Japan thinks of<br />
them, how we should respond to them. And T made it clear that Australia would<br />
not be part of any pact which damraged Japan's interests, and that we're seeking the<br />
general conclusion of the ( 1ATT Pound as the best way of getting the psychology<br />
right. So just as the French vote on Maastricht was important in getting<br />
psychology tight, a conclusion of the GATT Round will get i he psychology right<br />
On trade, and hopefully diminish whatever interests some Countries may have in<br />
making bilateral arransements<br />

<p>J Did they raise any concern about NArETA and the implivations that might have fo~ r<br />
PM: No, except to say that they are determined to see that it is GATT friendly, that it<br />
accords with GATT. and irt is truly a trade liberalising thing in GAIT terms, that<br />
it accords with GATT, well then I think any objections Japan may have will be<br />
diminished.<br />
I; What about the R~ ush proposal, what's their reiponse on that?<br />
PM, I think they want t know more about that and it will depend on the details It<br />
depends on whether or not we aire talking about bilateral ar-rangemnents between<br />
the United States and sonie countries. The problem is, what is not known about it<br />
at the monieni is that it may well be so that the Ulnited States can make a bilateral<br />
Rgreement on trade between itself and sonic cout; Iries, but At the end of the<br />
Spokes, while the Spokes may emanate rrom the hub of the United States it may<br />
not induce open trade airangemrcnts between those countries at the end of the<br />
Spokes That is, it may be suitable to the United States but whether it is generally<br />
beneficial lo a group ofi countries would be Of COUrse only obvious when the details<br />
If Any pArticular trade arrangement were revealed. So they are ' let's look and see'.<br />
J Have you done anything to seek clarification of what Mr Flush's proposal does<br />
involve, what its implications are for Australia?<br />
PM: The Amnericans have been thinking about this, Mr Baker has talked about it at<br />
some length, but again it comes in the flurry of an election campaign, it will only<br />
have Ntatus in the hands of a new administration, so the sensible think is to inquire<br />
but to wait and see.<br />
J Prime ' 14triiter, on bilateral issues, did you raisie the concern that Australian<br />
automotive car part manufacturers have about acce's09<br />
PM: Yes, I asked Mfr Watanabe for an assorance that in any third party arrangements to<br />
dimni~ sh trade imbhalances in Japan's ravour, that Australia was not a casualty of<br />
any third party arrangemente. in teiim% OfO011 trade. And that assurance was<br />
generally freely given.<br />
J Did you talk about the reports that the Japanese are keen to see an Asia-Pacific<br />
leaders sumimit and would that be part of APFC?<br />
PM Nn hitil I'll he iplkino tn the Primer Minivetr Ahnitt thiit ti Aflrnnon and ITl vv<br />

<p>PM-I've already had quite a positive leter from him about it, and ats you know there<br />

trade with Japait f mmiy in Australia. D~ id that come tip In any sense or in the<br />
contexl of eiirli'r dkri~ aicnn% 7<br />
PM. No it didnN~, and It was not for me to be raising that here. what matters here is the<br />
continuity in the relationship and focussing on the things that mnatter rather than<br />
any notes of discord in Australia.<br />
J-But John Dawkins raised in Washington, he said that you notice that in Japan, he<br />
criticised them in particular for their non tariff protection on trade. Did you<br />
mention that at all in your talks?<br />
PM-Nnn tariff harriers have been part of the debate for a decade or co, and thia wholo<br />
proccio of uniffication ic an iscuo in the agriculture arcaof the CATT, and it willbe<br />
one of tlie things that will need to, I* woidet vo ir we scitullny get a firm~<br />
conclusion on agriculture.<br />
When you gave your assurance that you wouldn't enter into any agreements that<br />
would hurt Japan, was that in the contexct of the Huoh a" i Sjx-, kea?<br />
