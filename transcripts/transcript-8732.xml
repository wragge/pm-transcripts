SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
" INTO ASIA" TRADE AND INVESTNIENT CONVENTION<br />
PERTH 17 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the " Into Asia" Trade and Investment<br />
Convention, and I congratulate the Western Australian Government and other supporters<br />
of the conference on the imaginative program you havc devised.<br />
Its appropriate indeed that you are rnccting in this State, because Western Australia in<br />
some respects has been leading us into Asia.<br />
With less than a tcnth of Australia's people, this state now accounts for nearly a third of<br />
Australia's total cxports.<br />
And today, 70 pcr cent of Western Australia's exports go to Asqia.<br />
We are familiar of course with the great wealth that continues to be generated by exports<br />
from Western Australia's mining and energy industries.<br />
[ ron orc from the Pilbara and natural gas from the North West Shelf will remain sinews of<br />
interdependence bctween Western Australia and North Asia.<br />
The State govcrnxncent recognises, however, in its " Into Asia" strategy that Western<br />
Australia's future prosperity depends not only on maintaining these traditional links of<br />
trade with Asia, but also on learning to exploit rclatively new arcas of compctitive<br />
advantage in the dynamic Asian market.<br />
This means expanding services and manufactures exports while continuing with<br />
commodity exports.<br />
As Western Australia has found new markcts in Asia, so too has Australia as a whole.<br />
Nearly two thirds of Australian exports now go to Asia, and Asian mnarkets; continue to<br />
lead all others in export growth.<br />
I would like to take a little time today' to discuss what this powerful and consistent trend<br />
means for our international trade policy and for the way we think of ourselves as<br />
Australians.<br />
e-/ 1O* d 900* ON Z: iT Z6" AON2. I :-11331 </p>
<p>During the 1980s, the dozen or so countries and territories of North-East Asia and South-<br />
' East Asia grew twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
During the 1990s, they seem likely to repeat that performance.<br />
At a time when the OECD has had to revise downward its growth forecasts for Europe, the<br />
United States and Japan, Australia's strengthening links with the more rapidly growing<br />
economies of Asia are of critical importance to our economic expansion in the 1990s.<br />
The North-East Asian economies are more complementary to Australia in resource<br />
endowment and trade composition than any other economies in the world.<br />
North-East Asia accounts for nearly half of Australia's exports.<br />
North-East Asia is a major source of tourists, investment and business migrants, and is the<br />
single most important market for Australia's cducation exports.<br />
While North Asia rcmains by far the single most important market for Australia,<br />
Australia's exports to the six countries comprising the Association of South-East Asian<br />
Nations ( ASEAkN) are now growing more quickly than our exports to any other part of<br />
world. The ASEAN countrie-s now account for more Australian exports than cither the United<br />
States or the European community.<br />
Even more striking. is thc fact that Austral ia's manufactures and service exports to South-<br />
East Asia are growing morc quickly than exports of primary commodities.<br />
As South-East Asian economics have modernised we and they have discovered greater<br />
and greater opportunities in trade.<br />
Indonesia probably best exemplifies the need for Austra lians to revise their image of<br />
South-East Asia.<br />
Despite the fact that it has already become our ninth largest export market and second<br />
largest in ASEAN, too many Australians still have an image of Indonesia as a poor and<br />
backward country which is somehow threatening to Australia's interests.<br />
My visit to Indonesia in April this year served various foreign policy objectives.<br />
But, just as importantly, wanted to underline new realities for the Australian public.<br />
I made a point of highlighting the cnormous strategic benefit Australia has obtained<br />
during the past 25 years through the success of the Soeharto Government in consolidating<br />
political stability and economic devclopment in the Indonesian Archipelago.<br />
Between 1966 and 1991, Indonesian's real GDP rose 450 per cent.<br />
In the late 1970s, Indonesia was the world's largest importer of rice. In 1984, Indonesia<br />
became self sufficient.<br />
The people of Indonesia are now better fed, housed, and educated than evcr bcfore. Infant<br />
mortality rates are approximately half of what they were.<br />
_ O/ ZO~ d 9OO* ON VZ: iT Z6* AON *. T1131 </p>
<p>In recognition of the dynamic economic relationship Australian and Indonesia now enjoy,<br />
President Soeharto and I agreed to establish a regular Ministerial Forum to discuss at a<br />
high level trade and economic matters of shared interest.<br />
Establishing this body reflects a ncw maturity and mutual confidence in the relationship.<br />
I am pleased to note that yesterday and today the first meeting of the Ministerial Forum is<br />
taking place in Jakarta with five Australian Cabinet Ministers participating.<br />
I am also pleased to note that one of your distinguished speakers yesterday was His<br />
Excellency Governor Soelarso of Indoncsia's East Java Province, whom I met during my<br />
visit to Surabaya last April.<br />
No visitor could help but be impressed by the vitality of economic dcvelopment in<br />
Surabaya and its environs.<br />
I congratulate the State of Western Australia for its foresight in establishing a sister<br />
relationship with East Java.<br />
A new study by the East-Asia Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade demonstrates that Australia has hcld its market share in South-East Asia during the<br />
past five years.<br />
if we continue to hold it for the rest of this decade and I am confident we can we will<br />
put an additional $ 12 billion onto our annual exports.<br />
So you can see that because of their rapid growth, South-East Asian markets will become<br />
increasingly important to Australia's prosperity.<br />
Now, of course, we won't get the growth and we won't get the exports unless we can<br />
continue to transform our culture, but if you want proof of our ability to transform<br />
ourselves in a decade ahead, you need only look at the way in which we have transformed<br />
ourselves in the decade behind.<br />
We have transformed ourselves from a high inflation nation to a very low inflation nation.<br />
We have increased our competitiveness by well over one tenth.<br />
We have replaced industrial disputation with a cooperative system which has delivered the<br />
lowest strike rate for 30 years a system of consensus which I think the Australian people<br />
are very reluctant to abandon.<br />
We have opened the economy to the world with a floating exchange rate, financial<br />
deregulation, and Cuts in protection.<br />
We havc succeeded in putting governmcnt behind trade with the unification of trade and<br />
foreign affairs policies and departments, the creation of Austrade, the succssful<br />
leadership of the Cairns group in the Uruguay Round, and the initiative which lead to the<br />
creation of the APEC group of Pacific trading nations.<br />
A decade ago, we exported one seventh of what we produced.<br />
Today we export nearly one quarter of what we produce.<br />
2. O/ 20Od 900' ON Z: il Z6' AON* -T :-113J1 </p>
<p>And as the quantity of exports changed, so too has the composition and direction of<br />
exports. Today our manufactured exports are equal in value to our rural exports and our mining<br />
exports. And more and more of our exports arc going to Asia.<br />
As trade becomes more important to our national prosperity, international trade policy<br />
becomes more critical in national governmecnt. I<br />
As I have already made clear, our core interest is in protecting and cnhancing our trade<br />
with Asia.<br />
We Australians should see it as our historic good fortune to be located close to the world's<br />
fastest growing economies and one of its Vrcat economic powerhouses, and to have<br />
already established closc economic ties with it.<br />
We have the further advantage that the regional emphasis of Australia's foreign policy and<br />
our shared strategic intcrcsts with nicighbours to our north correlatc vcry wcll with the<br />
rcgional focus of our trade and commercial interests.<br />
As I said, it is our good luck. It is not the first timle we have been lucky, of course. For<br />
years we were able to rely on special relationships and our rural and mineral products to<br />
see us through.<br />
But our good luck this time is an opportunity to be seized, both by governments and by<br />
business. It won't come to us as a branch office, or as a quarry and a farm.<br />
As never before in our history we have to seize the time ourselves.<br />
Of course, our trading interests are not confincd to the Asian region.<br />
We strongly believe in maintaining and strengthening the open, non-discriminatory<br />
multilatcral trading system based on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or<br />
GATIT. This interest is shared by Japan and other East Asian trading partners because each of<br />
them pursues outward-looking economic policies and depends, on access to a wide spread<br />
of international markets.<br />
The beniefits of a new multilateral agreement would be considerable.<br />
It would extend international trade rules to cover agriculture and services, and also<br />
strengthen the disciplines and dispute-settling procedures of GATT.<br />
We have been deeply disappointed at the apparenit lack of political will in Europe, and in<br />
France in particular, to agree on reasonable understandings on agriculture.<br />
Sobered by the prospects of trade conflicts in a climate of slower OECD growth,<br />
negotiations betwccn the United States and the EC have now resumed.<br />
900* ON t7Z: i1 Z6* AONL T -1331 </p>
<p>An agreement is, I believe, the most important thing that Europe and the United States can<br />
do to stimulate world growth and confidence.<br />
But whatever the outcome of the Uruguay Round, we are now in a period of fluidity in the<br />
world trade system.<br />
There is an increasing tendency towards regional, subregional and bilateral trade<br />
arrangements. We may or may not like this trend, but it is indisputably there and we must<br />
seek to use it to our advantage.<br />
At the same time, there are powerful forces enhancing globalism, including the extinction<br />
of communism and the new universality of market economics, and the more powerful role<br />
the United Nations is now able to play in world affairs.<br />
In this new era in international affairs, our ovcrriding objective is to do all we can to<br />
preserve and enhance a trading environment in which our major markets remain as open to<br />
us as possible, and these markets remain open to each other.<br />
We must never lose sight of the fact that most of our trade, and the fastest growing part of<br />
our trade, is now with other countries in the Western Pacific.<br />
We must also not lose sight of the fact that many of these countries are highly dcpendent<br />
on the US market.<br />
At the regional level, an important clement of Australian policy is the promotion of a<br />
trade-liberalising agenda in the APEC group.<br />
The grouping includes the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea and the other main<br />
cconomies of the Western Pacific.<br />
Its member-, account for 50 per cent of world output and over 40 pcr cent of world trade.<br />
The importance of APF. C underlines the pivotal role that the United States will have in<br />
determining the trade environment in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The United States is the world largest economy and trading nation.<br />
As shown in the Uruguay Round, it retains a vital leadership role in helping maintain a<br />
sound multilateral trading system.<br />
Despite the growing economic importance of Japan, the United States remains the leading<br />
export market for most EAst Asian economies.<br />
And much more of the United States' Own trade now takes place across the Pacific than<br />
across the Atlantic.<br />
Against this background, the policies of the Clinton Administration will have a decisive<br />
bearing on trade alignments in the Pacific.<br />
I have been much impressed by President-elect Clinton's conviction that foreign and<br />
domestic policy are two sides of the one coin.<br />
2O/ SO'd 900* 0N PZ: iT Z6' AON'I -11331 </p>
<p>By his recognition that the United States must he able to compete successfully in the<br />
global economy if it is also tio suciicat home.<br />
We also noted that he affirmed strong support for the multilateral trading system and<br />
avoided the temptation to engage in the Japan-bashing that some in his party have<br />
indulged in.<br />
In Australia's dealings with President Clinton and his Administration, we shall make every<br />
effort to encourage Washington to think more deeply about the future institutional<br />
structure of economic relations in the Pacific.<br />
We think it is very important not only for ourselves but also for Japan, the United States<br />
and other trading nations in the region, that the United States and Japan increase their<br />
economic interdependence rather than diminish it.<br />
We will resist any process which has the effect of dividing the Pacific into trade allies of<br />
the United States and trade allies of Japan.<br />
As I explained during my visits to Japan and Singapore last Scptember, Australia's core<br />
interests lie in maintaining the most favourable possible environment for our bilateral<br />
trade rclationships with Japan and the other economics of East Asia.<br />
This reflects a situation where East Asia now accounts for nearly six times as much of our<br />
total exports as does the United States.<br />
But the regional trading environment for Australia will he so much better if the Western<br />
Pacific and North America remain part of the same thriving trading community.<br />
As important as they are, the initiatives of the biggcr players cannot of themselves<br />
guarantee Australia's success in international trade and commerce.<br />
We have a big responsibility at home for maintaining the drive towards making our<br />
economy intcrnationally competitive, and developing a creative culture of<br />
entrepreneurship. While thcre is much that the Australian Government can do to hclp create the right policy.<br />
environment, we have to recognise that the ultimate challenge Of SLuccccding in the region<br />
rests with Australian business.<br />
Many of our private companies havc acceptcd their responsibilities and arc aircady<br />
demonstrating how well they can succccd.<br />
But there is a broader challenge for the whole Australian comnmunity.<br />
it is a question of attitudes, to do with how we see ourselves as a nation and how we<br />
perceive our relations with the region.<br />
Australia can no longer afford to be a society located with its geographical feet in Asia,<br />
but with its intellectual head and emotional heart in Europe or North Amecrica.<br />
Part of this is being confident in ourselves and knowing that our political and social values<br />
do not have to be compromised in a closer association with Asia.<br />
e2/ 9O* d 900* ON tZ: iT Z6* AON* 2T: 131 </p>

Indeed, I would argue that Australia's reputation for openness and multiculturalismi are<br />
definite assets in a region which is already very diversified politically and is showing<br />
increasing pluralism as it advances economically.<br />
We should recognise the increasing contribution that our Asian migrant community is<br />
making to commercial links with Asia.<br />
It also serves our economic purposes that an increasing number of Australian students are<br />
studying Asian languages at secondary and tertiary level.<br />
During my recent visit to Japan, government and business leaders were very imnpressed to<br />
hear that we now have around 100,000 students studying thc Japanese language.<br />
Thiis number is gcater than the number of Japancsc-language students in any country in<br />
the world outside North Asia.<br />
There are now 41 centres or institutes of Asian studies at Australian universities and there<br />
is a growing number of educational exchange programs between Australia and Asian<br />
universities. Increasingly, we are recognising that just as the changes we have made in the way we do<br />
business at home and in the way we conduct our industrial relations involve cultural<br />
questions, so too will our continuing success in integrating ourselves with the economies<br />
of Asia depend upon cultural changes that allow us to adapt our basically European<br />
society to Asian cultures.<br />
It is here, I think, that thc Australian people and government will find its grcatest, most<br />
absorbing and most rewarding challenge in the coming decade.<br />
