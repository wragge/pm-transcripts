PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
I sincerely regret the statements I made to Mr Bob Bell in<br />
Whyalla. I was upset by the fact that he denied the existence of the<br />
recent tax cuts, and his assertion that I and the<br />
politicians were " lining our pockets" with pay rises when in<br />
fact last year and this year I personally had initiated<br />
action to impede the Parliamentary salary increases which<br />
had been independently determined.<br />
However this was no exduse for the language I used and I<br />
hope that Bob Bell will accept my apology in the spirit in<br />
which it is offered. 2053 </p>
