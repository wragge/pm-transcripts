AUSTRALIA CLUB DINNER<br />
SPEECH BY THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES, PRIME MINISTER OF.<br />
AUSTRALIA, AT THE SAVOY HOTEL, LONDON,-12TH JUNE 1962<br />
" Sir, Mr. Prime Minister, your Grace and Gentlemen, I<br />
never hear my name announced in London, and I want to tell you<br />
I have heard it many times now, without recalling that on one<br />
occasion the Master of Ceremonies having heard me referred<br />
to as Menzies and, being a decent Scot himself, came across to<br />
me just before, and said: ' Excuse me, sir'-in a Scots burr,<br />
which he used when making the announcement ' excuse me, sir,<br />
am I to announce you as Menzies or by your proper name? i<br />
" So in whatever capacity it may be., here I am. I am<br />
really in a state of considerable embarrassment because the<br />
chairman tonight is a former Governor-General of Australia of<br />
whom I live in fear and trcmbling for years and who, whenever<br />
he made a good speech in Australia, which was usually, was able<br />
to say ' Thank you very much,! yes9 and when he said something<br />
that wasn't approved of, said: ' vy constitutional advisers, of<br />
course'.' Nowadays I am delighted. I have him cold. He just<br />
has to talk for himself now. And then I have, of course, by<br />
misfortune, here tonight the current Governor-General of<br />
Australia, Lord DO L'Isle hare because his wife has been ill,<br />
and they have had to come back here for a timc; and every member<br />
here tonight, every person, would wish us all to send to her<br />
through him our warm good wishes.<br />
" And then, of course, I have here my old friend the Prime<br />
Minister of Great Britain who has spoken so gencrouoly. tonight.<br />
Harold Macmillan and I have known each other for many years and,<br />
through many escapades, wei have been and remain, great friends.<br />
And he and I have lived long enough to learn that the right way<br />
to maintain our friendship, one with the other, is to disbelieve<br />
everything that we read. This is the pinnacle of' wisdom on<br />
which he sits for the moment. For a year, or two years, he<br />
seems to have an unrivalled command of the timetable quite<br />
comfortably and I sit precariously0 If I may coin a phrase<br />
' here today and gone tomorrow'<br />
" But anyhow I have been over here on a matter of great<br />
moment0 Not under any impression that problems were going to<br />
be solved, but because a great number of these problems are<br />
not to be solved so easily as the onlooker supposes, But here,<br />
to -be able to go back home, as I shall in a couple of days time,<br />
with the certain knowledge that between us all, we have got to<br />
understand our problems much better; and this is tremcndously<br />
important because really, at this time, putting on one side<br />
the enormous events of war, we are dealing between ourselves<br />
with problems which are the greatest problems that you have<br />
dealt with, Prime Minister, or that I have dealt with in time<br />
of peace in our lifetime. And it is therefore very important<br />
to begin by understanding that the man who is dogmatic in<br />
these matters runs a fair chance of being wrong because these<br />
are enormously complex matters0 / 2. </p>
<p>" The Prime Minister of Great Britain has made a most<br />
eloquent speech tonight about the significance of Great Britain<br />
in Europe, as distinguished from Great Britain out of Europe,<br />
but exercising somc balance of power in Europe. This is an eloquent<br />
speech and a powerful one. I don't know what the answer<br />
is to this. I well understand how strong the feelings are of<br />
people who feel that at this time in history Great Britain<br />
ought to take its place in the European comity of nations; how<br />
at this time with Europe so significant in a heavily divided<br />
world, Great Britain should put her weight, her wisdom, her<br />
experience, into the scales.<br />
" I would have you understand that I think I understand<br />
that very clearly. But when we get to that point we enter a<br />
complete medley of considerations, He is more familiar than I<br />
am, or perhaps any of us are, with what we mean by ' going into<br />
Europe ' 0 Are we talking about a federal Europe, a confederacy<br />
of European nations? Are we talking about something perhaps<br />
more practical, a little more elementary, the pragmatic<br />
approach to the association of great European Powers in a<br />
practising way from time to time through Prime Ministers and_<br />
through Foreign Secretaries? N" obody can answer these questions.<br />
There arc some people in the world who think of joint actions<br />
always in terms of mechanics and there are others who think of<br />
them in terms of functions, of friendship and of associations.<br />
And so I am not going away from here with any ideas in my mind<br />
that there is some strict form that will be observed, that there<br />
is some structure emerging in Europe, because I don't know what<br />
it is and I don't suppose that there is anyone else at present who<br />
knows what it is. All I know is that the decision to go into<br />
Europe if I may use that compendious phrase is a decision for<br />
the Government of this ancient monarchy to make and it"' is *: ndt-f or<br />
me or anybody else to say ' yes' or ' no'.<br />
" This is one of the most remarkable decisions that will<br />
have to be made and it will be made by the Government and<br />
Parliament of the country which has more wisdom and more experience<br />
and more to lose than any other country in the world.<br />
And so I want to say, at the very outset, anybody who supposes<br />
that I have come here as a newcomer in some brash fashion to<br />
say, ' This is what you are to dot, will be disappointed. I am<br />
not here to say what somebody else ought to, do on this great<br />
matter0 I happen to be here as the Prime Minister of a country<br />
which is British to the boot heels, which is a monarchist<br />
country; which with you, Prime Minister, is within the<br />
allegiance to the Crown no ambhiguities, no formulae needed<br />
about our position.<br />
" We in Australia are of Her Majesty's subjects and<br />
whatever politicians -whether they are you or somebody else, or<br />
myself or somebody else -may do nothing . will separate the<br />
people of Australia from the allegiance to the Crown. The one<br />
great danger at this time, and I see it from time to time, is<br />
that people, particularly some commentators, see everything in<br />
black and white0 Now perhaps this is an occupational disease<br />
for when they write it, it appears in black and white, and<br />
there it is0 But these are not problems of black and white,<br />
these are not matters on which you can afford to be dogmatic.<br />
They are in reality, to the pride and joy of ourselves as<br />
Commonwealth people, matters on which before the ultimate decision<br />
is taken we may sit down together and talk about ass'friends-<br />
13. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
and if necessary disagree, on detail, as friends. But in the<br />
long run the judgment that will have to be taken will be one<br />
that is neither brilliant white nor dark black but maybe some<br />
form of iridescent grey,<br />
" But this is the way of the world. Wie ought to remember<br />
these things. We see a certain colour in the sky. Vie think<br />
we identify it. It may be thGe dawn, it may be the twilight, but<br />
it largely depends on what direction we are facing, as to whether<br />
we think it is the dawn or the twilight. These are tremendous<br />
matters and I am the last person either to surrender the views<br />
of my own country to somebody elsc or to try to persuade some<br />
other person that his views are wrong because they don't happen<br />
to coincide with mine.<br />
" This is one of the crucial periods in our history and<br />
it must not be confused by prejudice, by overplaying the hand,<br />
by stirring up hostilities. This is to be dealt with by<br />
remembering a few things. I don't want to say too much to you<br />
because I know from long experience that you become uneasy, and<br />
so do I-in a * long speech but these are to be dealt with by<br />
remenmeting a few things. One of them, for example, is that as<br />
betweon Great Britain and Australia the structure is clear.<br />
The interests, properly considered, are, I believe, in commnon.<br />
I can't suppose for one moment that Great Britain is any more<br />
unaware than I am, or than you are, of the tremendous significance<br />
in the world of the last 30 years 40 years of this<br />
family preferential system which has built up a great pattern<br />
of trade in the British world and therefore and don't forget<br />
it a grcat pattern of production in our respective countries.<br />
" It doesn't occur to me to believe that the Government<br />
of the United Kingdom forgets that any more than I do, These<br />
are essential things. I have read a few exercises in newspapers<br />
and a few letters in newspapers which appear to suggest that<br />
Australia is being very selfish over all this matter; that<br />
we want everything and we give nothing. Now really.' This seems<br />
to me to be a little bit hot if I may use that homely<br />
expression, a little bit hot, All my adult life my country<br />
has lived in a pattern of preferential trade, ' in honour<br />
preferring one another' which is good biblical authority as<br />
well as anything else ' in honour preferring one another'. And<br />
in the result we have built up a trade structure, an economic<br />
structure, which is very hard to equal in modern history.<br />
" And to think that all this happens one way is quite<br />
childish. We give preferences to Great Britain; Great Britain<br />
gives preferences tD us. You give preferences, sir, to New<br />
Zealand, whose distinguished High Commissioner is here. She<br />
gives preferences to you. It runs round the world, this<br />
Commonweallth preferential structure. And in result we in<br />
Australia have contributed to the well-being economically of<br />
this country in the most dramatic fashion, just as you, by<br />
your preferences to our goods in this country, have rendered our<br />
expansion, or a great deal of it possible. Well, here we are;<br />
we are on comimn ground aren't we? Yes, a plague upon these<br />
people who want me to believe this is all one way. / 4, </p>
<p>" I was questioned the other night by a gentleman on<br />
the television well you notice I am using the terms of<br />
courtesy; I didn't have the figures with me, but it is one<br />
of thd rare privileges of Prime Ministers that they leave all<br />
the knowledge to their subordinates and dwell themselves in a<br />
lofty zone of their own. But may I just say this to you, it<br />
is for the better part of 50 years now that we have had this<br />
pattern of British Empire trade, Commonwealth trade whatever<br />
it may have been called. My old friend the Prime Minister of<br />
Great Britain, this most distinguished servant of his people;<br />
he and I have before today, on many occasions, stood on<br />
platforms together and spoken for this very pattern of trade,<br />
and he would do it tomorrow himself and so would I. This is<br />
a great story. But in 1960-61 I admit that's the final<br />
financial year before I almost lost the Election and I don't<br />
say that one is related to the other not at all; who am I<br />
to say this? But in the financial year 1960-61, 1 obtained the<br />
figures. We imported we., Australia from Britain, goods to<br />
the tune f. o. b. of œ 272M. And in order to improve the strength<br />
of sterling, I am quoting my figures in sterling œ 272M.<br />
sterling. And Great Britain imported from us, and I am not<br />
complaining about this, œ, 166M. sterling. In other words I<br />
am talking now to those who don't have the supreme privilege<br />
of being Australians you had a favourable trade balance with<br />
us of 9106M. " Don't think for one moment that this to me is an object<br />
of complaint; it isn't. I have great pride in the fact that<br />
under this preferred system my country has been, over a period<br />
of years, with a few exceptions now and then, with its handful<br />
of people, the greatest customer that Groat Britain has had,<br />
In fact I don't want to create any Trans-A1" tlantic difficulties<br />
because I am going there on Thursday. I must gird my loins<br />
for the arguments that Itll enc. Duntcr in Wlashington. But really,<br />
it is worth while some of these gentlemen who write their<br />
comments for your improvement, to remind them or to tell them,<br />
that they didn't know that my country, over this eriod, has<br />
had a population ranging from ' 4 million, 1 to lO-million and<br />
that over this period of ' 40 years, Australia little Australia<br />
which is supposed to be selfish at this time, has bought from<br />
Groat Britain, very properly, and has in the buying produced<br />
employment in this country, very p~ roperly, L8501, more than<br />
the United States has over the corresponding period of time,<br />
" Now Sir, I think I may say those things0 These things<br />
are very familar to my friend, and to the British Government and<br />
they wouldn't quarrel with them0 You mustn't think for one<br />
moment, as between the United Kingdom Government and the<br />
Australian Go-vernment, that there is some deep-rooted disagreement<br />
abo-ut the fact. There isn't. These things are all well<br />
understood; and warmly understood; and heartily approved.<br />
The one thing that did occur just a-fter I arrived here was that<br />
when my distinguished friend from New Zealand, Mr. Marshall,<br />
and I being presented with what turned out to be a purely<br />
tentative arrangement on hard manufactures, said, I thought<br />
very modestly, if you can associate modesty with me: ' We hope<br />
this is not your reply to foodstuffs,.' And you know, we were<br />
quite right. You can apply to something, nc doubt, a phasing<br />
out by 1970, but you do that to the foodstuffs that are exported<br />
from the Commonwealth countries, so that at the end of 1970 </p>
<p>it's all gone, and the noises that will come from the Commonwealth<br />
countries will be such as to exhaust even the vocabulary of the<br />
' Daily Express'.<br />
" Because, you see, you cannot say to countries which have<br />
lived within the covenant for so long, and that have conducted<br />
this mutually advantageous economy for so long; you can't say<br />
to them ' Well, look, we wouldn't kill you straight out, but in<br />
1970 it is all over'. And I don't believe for one moment that<br />
the Government of the United Kingdom is going to subscribe to<br />
such an idea. Not for one moment. We have in fact as<br />
Australians difficult as we are supposed to be worked through<br />
our offices, constructively, with the great assistance of the<br />
representatives of the United Kingdom, with Mr. Heath opening<br />
door after door for them, with meetings of members of Council;<br />
we have been presenting constructive ideas. We have not, as<br />
the Prime Minister knows we have not, said, ' Well, let's stick<br />
to the old form', We have realised that that might be very<br />
difficult for the Six to accept, and we have therefore worked<br />
out alternatives, whether there could not be comparable outlets,<br />
whether perhaps the preferred entry of goods into this country<br />
might be distributed over the countries of the Common Market,<br />
This is, to a point representing our normal traffic, with a<br />
little edge for growth and Ihope. no busines. man<br />
is going tc object to that because you are all devoted to the<br />
principle of growth you wouldn't run your business unless you<br />
thought you had a little margin for growth. Our business is<br />
the business of Australia the business of a country whose<br />
population is increasing as rapidly as that of Japan, a country<br />
which, if it is to play its part in the world as a member<br />
of the Comionwalth, must 3o on, grow, expand, have more people,<br />
more production, more trade, more power. Of course this is<br />
right. We are not a static community, put away in a remote<br />
corner of the world. We are not prepared to be a static<br />
community and neither does anybody in this country want us to<br />
be a static community. And therefore we have, with the full<br />
approval our colleagues in Great Britain, been working on<br />
ways and means of developing alternative methods of preserving<br />
a proper volume of trade for Great Britain, in Great Britain,<br />
in the Six for Australia, for New Zealand, for Canada, for<br />
whatever it may be. Now this is not a point of difference. We<br />
have in company with aur colleagues in Great Britain been<br />
working on these things. All I want to say to you is that if<br />
the Six took up the attitude that they are not looking at any<br />
alternatives, that the existing preferences preferences<br />
behind which thousands of people in communities in Australia<br />
live and without which they would die if they took up the<br />
attitude ' Nothing doing, the preferences must disappear in<br />
1970', then I am perfectly certain that my country would not<br />
say ' Yes'. And, though I speak with no authority, I am<br />
perfectly convinced that the Government, the Parliament and<br />
the people of this country would not say ' Yesf.<br />
" One matter arose when Mr. Marshall and I made our rather<br />
anodyne statement and woke to find ourselves famous. And that<br />
was that we were afraid that these interim arrangements were<br />
in a sense final; they were announced in certain organs of<br />
/ 6. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
the press as agreements. Now I am happy to say that one of<br />
the things, as my colleague will agree, that has emerged from<br />
our discussions is that it is perfectly clear, that although you<br />
must mlke tentative arrangements if you are ever to bring<br />
negotiations to an end, they are all tentative. They do not<br />
bind us. They do not bind anybody. They are tentative<br />
arrangements and when finally the ground has been covered, there<br />
will be a ' package' of such arrangements andi that, I believe<br />
I am right in saying, is what the Prime Ministers will be in<br />
a position to discuss without prejudice, without commitment, when<br />
they meet here in September. Now I don't complain about that.<br />
I know how negotiations must go on and I am happy tc say that<br />
this understanding that we have is now completely common ground.<br />
" Now perhaps there is just one other thing that I ought<br />
to say to you. I want to make another p6int to you, and I make<br />
this in no sense of hostility, to either the European countries<br />
or to the United States of America, our great friends our<br />
generous friends. But I do want to put this to you. Those<br />
in Europe, or those in America, who press too hard what I<br />
believe to be the doctrinaire view that preferences must disappear<br />
without substitute in 1970, accept a great responsibility<br />
before history. The European Powers have not engaged or begun<br />
the lengthy negotiations with Great Britain because they don't<br />
want Great Britain in Europe. If they didn't want Great<br />
Britain in Europe it would have been a simple thing to say ' No'.<br />
Wouldn't it? But the negotiations go on. One must assume<br />
that, not necessarily unanimously but in a number of fields in<br />
Europe, there is a feeling that the association of Great<br />
Britain with Europe this revolutionary change in the eye of<br />
history is a good thing, a good thing for the world, a good<br />
thing for peace, a good thing for resistance to tyranny. And<br />
the United States of America which is not a party, but which<br />
has offered positive views on these matters, must be taken to<br />
believe that it would be a good thing for the free world for<br />
a Europe to have Great Britain in it.<br />
" I don't. need to elaborate these things. I just assume<br />
them; in my naivetLo I assume them. They will accept a very<br />
great responsibility if between them, jointly or severally,<br />
they assume an attitude that the old preferential relations<br />
between the countries of the British Commonwealth are to be<br />
destroyed by 1970 as part of the price of union. This will be<br />
a great responsibility because they will in effect, if they are<br />
right, if they succeed, if all this happens, be presenting the<br />
Government of this country with a dilemma the like of which<br />
was never seen before in peaceful history, the dilemma of<br />
choosing between Europe on those terms and the Commrnwealth.<br />
" I don't believe for one moment that you are going to<br />
choose against the Commonwealth. I don't believe for one<br />
moment that anybody in this country is bound to accept every<br />
jot and every tittle of the things that we put up though we<br />
think they are pretty good. But I do believe that if and it<br />
is a big if it turns out that the attitude in Europe is that<br />
Great Britain must determine the whole of her preferential<br />
arrangements with her Commonwealth in 1970 as the price of going<br />
/ 7. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
into Europe, then they are offerin. this country a choice which<br />
is well, I fail to find words to describe it, a terrible choice,<br />
an historic choice, a disastrous choice. Because, you know,<br />
tbetter the devil you know than the devil you don't know'. We<br />
have lived long together. When I look back over it and, I am<br />
an old hand in Commonwealth business and so is my friend Harold<br />
Macmillan, thc reason why we always meet as friends is that we<br />
know the story behind it all. It is the story of a Commonwealth<br />
in which he and I both happen to be servants of our Sovereign<br />
Lady the Queen, in which Great Britain and Australia, to say<br />
nothing of all the other Commonwealth countries, have lived<br />
together a Commonwealth whose roots have been nurtured in the<br />
soil of co-operation and affection, and loyalty. These are<br />
wonderful things. Not to be lightly disregarded, not lightly<br />
to be put aside. It is because my approach to this matter is<br />
exactly the same as yours, Harold, that I know that we must not<br />
cry ' disaster' too quickly, that we must not be dogmatic too<br />
soon, that we must understand, that believing the same things,<br />
loving the same things, remembering the same things, we are going<br />
to do the best to help each other and at the same time help the<br />
continent of Europe, help the whole free world. I can see all<br />
these things. I can understand them perfectly. How wonderful<br />
a thing it would be for the free world to have a concerted<br />
Europe, to have a group of Powers who were not ambiguous, who<br />
knew where they stood, And so when he says this is of great<br />
value I don't resist that, I don't resist that. I merely say<br />
to myself, ' Yes, but don't forget', and I don't need to say it<br />
to him, though there are some people to whom it needs to be said,<br />
' Don't forget that we haven't come to our present state in the<br />
world, we haven't c. mO to our present power and significance in<br />
the world without having these things connecting us, wonderful<br />
things bringing us together, a great record of achievement and,<br />
I believe, properly considered, a marvellous vison of hope and<br />
Sain and strength for the future'." </p>
