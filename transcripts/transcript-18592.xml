Australia and Malaysia today signed a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) that will open avenues for Australian goods and services into the Malaysian market. </p>
<p>The agreement will further integrate the Australian economy with the fast-growing Asian region, benefiting Australian exporters, importers and consumers.</p>
<p>It was signed in Kuala Lumpur by Australia's Trade and Competiveness Minister Craig Emerson and his Malaysian counterpart Mustapa Mohamed.</p>
<p>Today's signing follows an undertaking in March last year by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Najib Tun Razak, the Malaysian Prime Minister, to complete negotiations within a year.</p>
<p>Under the accord, Australia will be as well-positioned in the Malaysian market as Malaysia's closest trading partners in ASEAN, and in some cases better.</p>
<p>For Malaysia, the accord allows the same tariff-free entry to Australia currently enjoyed by Singapore.</p>
<p>The FTA will guarantee tariff-free entry for 97.6 per cent of current goods exports from Australia once it enters into force. This will rise to 99 per cent by 2017.</p>
<p>Malaysian exporters, meanwhile, will enjoy duty-free entry to the Australian market.</p>
<p>Australia has also agreed to provide a three-year package of up to 21 short and long-term scholarships, fellowships, awards and exchanges to support Malaysia's economic reform efforts.</p>
<p>This complements existing exchanges between Australia and Malaysia on public sector and economic governance, including through the Endeavour Scholarships.</p>
<p>Malaysia is Australia's 10thlargest trading partner, with two-way trade worth almost $16 billion in the 2010-11 financial year.</p>
<p>Australian exporters of automotive parts, iron, steel and dairy products will benefit from improved market access under the agreement.</p>
<p>The FTA will also help diversify the trading relationship by opening Malaysia's services sector to Australian companies.</p>
<p>Malaysia has committed to allowing majority Australian ownership of service providers in a range of industries, including telecommunications, insurance, education, tourism, research and development, accountancy and mining-related services.</p>
<p>The signing of this FTA is an early outcome of the white paper on Australia in the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The agreement goes well beyond the lowering or elimination of import tariffs.</p>
<p>It is a vote of confidence in the Malaysian people, in their economic reform process and in the importance of the Asian region to Australia.</p>
<p>The FTA will also complement benefits already flowing from the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA.</p>
