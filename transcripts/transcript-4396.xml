PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT ON THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS<br />
STRIKE, FOLLOWING A CABINET MEETING IN ADELAIDE 12 MAY 1977<br />
govornment decisions on these particular matters and I think<br />
that the best thing I can do, at this moment, is to read out<br />
a statement to you, which also gives some other information which<br />
I am sure that you and other Australians will be very much<br />
interested in. I will now read the statement:<br />
At a meeting in Adelaide today the Cabinet considered the strike<br />
by air traffic controllers. Cabinet reaffirmed its view that<br />
this matter ought to be settled by the proper processes of<br />
arbitration. The claim has, on many occasions, been before the appropriate<br />
bodies. The full bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission is waiting to hear the matter now. The only requirement<br />
before that happens is for air traffic controllers to resume work.<br />
The harm and suffering imposed on tens of thousands of people in<br />
Australia, and overseas, can then be avoided. It is not only<br />
people inconvenienced by the strike, it is obviously people who<br />
have been stood down as a consequence of the strike.<br />
The Government noted that a number of initiatives have been<br />
taken by unions within the air transport industry which would<br />
permit certain domestic and international passenger flights<br />
to be operated. It is noted that the Pilots Federation has<br />
announced that their members are prepared to maintain the existing<br />
evening services to and from Tasmania, continue existing<br />
services in the Pilbarra and reinstate the service between<br />
Sydney and Norfolk Island. The Government feels that these<br />
initiatives demonstrate a sense of national responsibility and<br />
would particularly commend the domestic branch of the Federation<br />
of Air Pilots whose members are currently subject to stand down<br />
orders, and have therefore decided that they are not prepared<br />
to accept payment for operating these services. / 2 </p>
<p>The Government is alsopleased to note that air traffic controllers<br />
have agreed to provide operational services which will allow<br />
four international flights out
assist ' assengers stranded in Australia and overseas. The<br />
Government hopes that the co-tfY 15swill agree to additional<br />
flights as soon as possible. Mv ix6. will be able to give<br />
more details, but the four ights. would in no way meet<br />
the requirements of passenges held up either in Australia or<br />
overseas waiting to g/" tt back" to'Atralia.<br />
The Government has indicated on a number of occasions its<br />
support for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission<br />
and the role of the Public Service Board. Cabinet<br />
now reaffirms that view.<br />
The Government notes that there will be a vote by air traffic<br />
controllers on Friday on whether to resume work and thus<br />
allow the full bench to determine their claim on its merits.<br />
In the name of the Government I ask all air traffic controllers<br />
to examine in their own minds the proper course of action that<br />
they should take. I would ask them to consider what is in their<br />
own best interests and what is the in best interests of the nation.<br />
In the Government's view if these two questions are examined<br />
with an open mind, the air traffic controllers would conclude<br />
that they should return to work, and thus would vote accordingly<br />
on Friday. Therefore I ask them to put Australia first.<br />
Above all, I ask them to accept the verdict of the impartial body.<br />
Over many years Australia has built a complex and highly competent<br />
system of arbitration to adjudicate when there is a dispute.<br />
The arbitration system has been developed to protect the weak,<br />
and to ensure fairness. It is time and it is necessary<br />
that air traffic controllers indicate their willingness to<br />
accept the decision of the umpire, which in this case is the<br />
highest arbitral authority, the full bench of the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission / 3 </p>
<p>er b e' -ti lattiet<br />
The Government appeals, therF r this last time to<br />
air traffic controllers to eercie . i sense of national<br />
responsibility. Cabinet has spent a long time cdn -ideing all facets of this<br />
matter. It has made the detision/ that if the vote on Friday<br />
is to continue the strike, Parliament will be reassembled<br />
on Monday and asked to pass special legislation.<br />
It is decided to announce this decision immediately. It would<br />
be unfair if air traffic controllers were to vote on this<br />
issue without knowing the action that the Government proposes<br />
to take. 00Oooo000 </p>
