The Prime Minister today announced updated figures for emergency payments provided to those affected by the floods in NSW and Queensland.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is working closely with the Queensland and NSW Governments in this unfolding flood situation to make sure affected communities get any necessary Commonwealth assistance immediately.</p>
<p>As at the end of Friday 10 February more than 10,900 claims for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment have been granted, worth over $12.96 million.</p>
<p>Of this, more than 4,100 claims were from Queensland, totalling around $4.89 million and more than 6,800 claims have been from NSW, worth over $8.07 million.</p>
<p>Over 16,000 calls have been received to the Australian Government Information Line of 180 22 66 since the payment was announced on 6 February. </p>
<p>More than 850 claims were granted on that day the payment was first announced, the fastest turnaround of disaster payments in Australian history. </p>
<p>The Australian Government is providing Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments of $1000 per adult and $400 per child to people who have been impacted by flooding in Balonne, Barcaldine, Blackall-Tambo, Maranoa, Murweh and Paroo shires in Queensland and those in Moree, Narrabri and Gwydir in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Speaking in St George in Queensland, the Prime Minister also announced that the Australian Government had this week advanced $1.9 billion to Queensland to assist in recovery from last year's natural disasters. </p>
<p>This is part of our commitment to help Queensland rebuild from the natural disasters that took place last summer.</p>
<p>This week's payment means that the Australian Government has advanced a total of $4.1 billion to Queensland to assist in recovery from events including last year's floods and Cyclone Yasi. </p>
<p>These further advance payments are evidence of our ongoing commitment to helping Queensland recover and rebuild. </p>
