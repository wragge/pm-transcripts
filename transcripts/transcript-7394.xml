PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
1988 NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE<br />
RETURNED SERVICES LEAGUE<br />
CANBERRA 5 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Like its predecessors, this 1988 Bicentennial Congress of<br />
the Returned Services League is a proud and significant<br />
event. It reminds us of the great ANZAC tradition the tradition<br />
of selflessness and courage demonstrated by our servicemen<br />
and women in the past.<br />
And it reminds us of the RSL's tradition of service, both to<br />
veterans and to the community at large.<br />
For these reasons the Government was proud to respond to the<br />
RSL's request for financial assistance to stage this<br />
Congress.<br />
But this Congress is particularly salient given that it is<br />
the last one over which Sir William Keys will preside.<br />
I will be delivering some specific words of thanks to Bill<br />
at his farewell dinner on Thursday, so at this point I will<br />
make the brief, but nonetheless heartfelt, comment that his<br />
leadership, his consultative style, and let's be frank, his<br />
hard bargaining have substantially helped ensure the RSL,<br />
remains the respected national organisation it has always<br />
been. Bill has truly set a high standard of achievement for<br />
his successor.<br />
That combination of hard bargaining and constructive<br />
dialogue is important.<br />
We, in Government, have sought to ensure that veterans get<br />
the support and the services they justly deserve. And we<br />
have worked hard to ensure that the scarce veterans' funds<br />
which we have at our disposal are directed to veterans,<br />
where they should be directed, and not at bureaucrats or<br />
other elements of administration. And we will continue to<br />
do so, in cooperation with the RSL. 17 1971 </p>
<p>Because if there is one thing of which the RSL can be sure,<br />
it is this. This Government honours its commitments. This<br />
Government honours our veterans. And this Government is<br />
prepared to work constructively with those prepared to work<br />
constructively with us.<br />
This does not of course mean we agree on every issue. It<br />
means that where we have legitimate differences, as we no<br />
doubt will, we work to resolve them not in a spirit of<br />
confrontation but of cooperation.<br />
It is in this context that I say I trust that the<br />
outstanding record of achievement which is Bill Keys' legacy<br />
will continue to mark the partnership between the Labor<br />
Government and the RSL.<br />
What must impress anyone surveying Australia in its<br />
Bicentennial Year is the very great respect with which the<br />
nation regards its veterans community and its currently<br />
serving members of the armed forces.<br />
This magnificent Defence Force Academy is a case in pointit<br />
has already established a sound reputation for equipping<br />
cadets for the wide range of roles which modern defence<br />
service personnel discharge.<br />
I am impressed too by the continuing willingness in the<br />
community to commemorate publicly the sacrifices and the<br />
achievements of our Defence Forces.<br />
This year the Commonwealth Government has proudly supported<br />
a number of initiatives in this regard.<br />
Next December, the new national memorial to the Australian<br />
Army will be dedicated on Anzac Parade.<br />
The Australian gas industry donated an Eternal Flame to the<br />
Australian War Memorial as a Bicentennial gift to the<br />
nation. This was lit at the 1988 Anzac Day Dawn Service, on<br />
the same day as the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen<br />
unveiled a new statue of the Gallipoli hero, John Simpson<br />
Kirkpatrick, with his donkey.<br />
The Chapel from the Changi Prisoner of war Camp has been<br />
reconstructed in the Royal military College at Duntroon, and<br />
dedicated as the National Prisoner of War Memorial to honour<br />
all Australian POW's of all services, in all areas.<br />
Such memorials display a new maturity pervading our national<br />
attitude. And most strikingly, this maturity is reflected in the<br />
recognition at last extended to our Vietnam veterans. I<br />
have consistently maintained, that regardless of opinions of<br />
the rights or wrongs of that war one cannot doubt the<br />
courage and integrity of those Australians whose task it was<br />
to fight it. </p>
<p>For this reason I attended with pride the ' Welcome Home'<br />
Parade held in Sydney-last October. For the same reason I<br />
was pleased to see the first national Vietnam Veterans Day<br />
held on 18 August, the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of<br />
Long Tan.<br />
Equally, one cannot fail to be impressed by the way in which<br />
Australians show their preparedness to honour the war dead<br />
of other nations. After the Turkish Government agreed to<br />
the dedication of Anzac Cove in Gallipoli in 1985, the<br />
decision was taken to unveil in Canberra a memorial to Kemal<br />
Ataturk, father of the Turkish nation and our one-time<br />
enemy. Later this month, plaques are to be unveiled at Garden<br />
Island on Sydney Harbour, on the initiative of the Naval<br />
Historical Society. These plaques will recall the memory of<br />
the Japanese crewmen killed in the midget submarine attack<br />
in 1942.<br />
I understand this decision has upset some people, including<br />
RSL members. Let me point out that the decision to erect<br />
the memorial was not taken by the Government. However I<br />
think the plaques attest to our capacity our maturity<br />
not just to honour those who fought but also to let time<br />
heal the wounds of war so we can concentrate on the new<br />
demands of peace.<br />
Side by side with this new maturity, Australians are<br />
continuing to demonstrate their compassion and their<br />
capacity to care for their fellow citizens who have served<br />
in time of war a capacity the Australian community has<br />
displayed at least since the establishment of the<br />
Repatriation System seventy years ago.<br />
Just as importantly, Australians are continuing to show<br />
their capacity to respond to the changing needs of veterans.<br />
My Government has good reason to be proud of its<br />
achievements in delivering new and improved services to<br />
Australia's veteran community.<br />
In the last election campaign. I promised that we would not<br />
abolish the Department of Veteran's Affairs but would retain<br />
it as a separate ministry to cater for the special needs of<br />
the veterans' community.<br />
AS you know, we are retaining the ministry and an<br />
independent department and I believe that under the capableadministration<br />
of my colleague Ben Humphreys it continues to<br />
perform a valuable service.<br />
In the last election I also promised two specific<br />
initiatives requested by the RSL. </p>
<p>These were first, to extend full medical and hospital<br />
treatment to all returned servicewomen of the Second world<br />
war; and second, to provide special compensation to<br />
surviving Australian servicement illegally interned in<br />
German concentration camps for a protracted period during<br />
World War II.<br />
Both commitments were honoured in our first post-election<br />
budget. Also in the last election, I promised to refer to the VEA<br />
Monitoring Committee the question of higher compensation for<br />
full General Rate pensioners whose disabilities have<br />
worsened after age 65 or retirement.<br />
we not only referred, we have acted.<br />
Last month's Budget introduced a new category of benefit<br />
the. Extreme Disablement Adjustment, which will be paid as a<br />
supplement to the General Rate of pension.<br />
The combined payments will be at 150 per cent of the General<br />
Rate for many veterans over the age of 65 who do not receive<br />
a T and PI pension but who are severely incapacitated as a<br />
result of active service.<br />
It is yet another demonstration, and an important one, of<br />
this Government's commitment to protecting the legitimate<br />
interests of the Australian veterans' community.<br />
I was particularly pleased that we could introduce this new<br />
measure while Bill was still President of the RSL, as he has<br />
been championing this personally for many years.<br />
More generally the Government is giving full and sympathetic<br />
consideration to the other 57 recommendations of the VEA<br />
Monitoring Committee. The Government has taken decisions on<br />
all but 20 of those recommendations. Those 20 are still<br />
under examination. But of the 38 considered to date only<br />
four recommendations have not been accepted a fair batting<br />
average for any report!<br />
These initiatives build upon a substantial record of<br />
achievement, not least in respect of veterans health<br />
services.<br />
A major public works program over the past five years, at a<br />
cost of more than $ 92 million, has continued the expansion<br />
and modernisation of Repatriation hospitals.<br />
Aged and Extended Care units have been established in all<br />
States to assess patients and refer them to the most<br />
appropriate form of treatment or care.<br />
we have also joined with the South Australian Government and<br />
Flinders University to locate the world's first Chair of<br />
Palliative Care at Daw Park Repatriation General Hospital in<br />
Adelaide.<br />
18001 </p>
<p>Another initiative in which I take particular interest is<br />
the Joint Ventures scheme an innovative program which<br />
helps veterans and war widows stay in their homes, while<br />
maintaining their independence.<br />
The number of projects approved under this scheme hit the<br />
200 mark in June this year a measure of its great success.<br />
But now we need to go further to ensure that the<br />
Repatriation system continues to deliver the care that<br />
veterans deserve.<br />
As the number of veterans over the age of 75 and the number<br />
of war widows rises, their need for medical and hospital<br />
services will inevitably rise.<br />
In looking to the future we will ensure that their need for<br />
effective, easily accessible, high-quality hospital and<br />
health care is met.<br />
And it is important to appreciate that even now those<br />
services are delivered not just by repatriation hospitals<br />
alone: over half our veterans receive hospital care in<br />
community rather than repatriation hospitals.<br />
This is hardly surprising.<br />
over 70 per cent of veterans in the three Eastern States<br />
live more than 15 kilometres away from their nearest<br />
Repatriation Hospital. In Tasmania it is 60 per cent; in<br />
South Australia and Western Australia, 45 per cent<br />
respectively.<br />
Effective integration of the Repatriation and State hospital<br />
systems will not simply allow best use to be made of the<br />
increasingly complex hospitals infrastructure. It will also<br />
give veterans better choice, better service, greater<br />
convenience. We have approached State Premiers about this issue,<br />
stressing the Government's concern to obtain priority<br />
hospital access for veterans and war widows, and to maintain<br />
the high quality health care they require.<br />
We are aiming to integrate repatriation hospitals with State<br />
health systems by 1 July 1995, or earlier if satisfactory<br />
arrangements can be made sooner.<br />
But let me repeat here in this Congress the assurances that<br />
I have already given the RSL in writing that the Government<br />
will not proceed if the Returned Services League has<br />
reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the arrangements<br />
that are proposed. This is a commitment on which you can<br />
rely. And to back that commitment we have arranged that<br />
there be the fullest consultations with the veterans<br />
community, led by the RSL, as-we enter the necessary<br />
negotiations with the States. 1801 </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
There is another outstanding matter of concern to the RSL on<br />
which a decision is imminent.<br />
We have announced our intention to transfer the mortgage<br />
portfolio of the Defence Service Homes Corporation to the<br />
private sector.<br />
The negotiations are now well advanced and I want to tell<br />
you, today, that the deal we are cutting is a good one for<br />
veterans. No major benefits will be lost for those currently eligible<br />
or serving out their qualifying period. Indeed there will<br />
be significant enhancements.<br />
For new mortgages, the ten month wait for funds will go and<br />
you will have access to commercial top up funds from the<br />
financial institution involved without additional fees and<br />
charges. This is in addition to the improvements of last<br />
year which ensure that when you move you can transfer your<br />
DSH mortgage to the new property.<br />
As you know the Government also has had under review the<br />
question of home ownership assistance arrangements for<br />
recruits to the forces after Miay 1985.<br />
We expect to be able to announce decisions shortly.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have concentrated today mostly on matters of direct<br />
relevance to the veterans' community. But I know you have a<br />
continuing interest in broader matters of Government policy.<br />
I an proud that in a time of very great international<br />
economic and political change, and not least change in our<br />
own region, Australia is successfully adapting to meet the<br />
new challenges of the l~ ate twentieth century.<br />
Australia plays a full and active role in the diplomacy of<br />
the region. we are building our defence self-reliance to<br />
boost our capacity to protect the broad strategic interest<br />
of the West.<br />
We are modernising our defence forces through, for<br />
example, building new submarines and frigates here in<br />
Australia. And we are working hard to increase our defence<br />
cooperation with our regional friends.<br />
There is not the time to develop any of these themes in<br />
detail. But I do want to highlight with pride one aspect of our<br />
defence activities our contribution to the United Nations<br />
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.<br />
18 </p>
<p>The 350-strong peacekeeping force, drawn from 23 countries,<br />
will observe and report any breaches of the ceasefire<br />
agreement without becoming involved in any armed conflict.<br />
Australia has an excellent record of involvement in<br />
peacekeeping forces around the world. We are showing our<br />
capacity to bolster and to defend peace. Our contribution<br />
in Iran-Iraq is a credit to us as a nation and to<br />
Australia's defence forces.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
As all of you know, Members of Parliament are already<br />
occupying their new and permanent Parliament House on<br />
Capital Hill.<br />
You probably don't know that one of the very first<br />
ceremonial functions performed in the House of<br />
Representatives and Senate Chambers related to the RSL.<br />
I had the pleasure of moving a motion, which was passed<br />
unanimously by the House, expressing the thanks of<br />
Parliament to all those organisations, within Australia and<br />
overseas, which provided gifts now adorning the new<br />
building. one of the most striking of those gifts is the RSL's the<br />
polished granite fountain surmounted by the symbolic image<br />
of four military caps the army slouch hat, the flat topped<br />
navy hat, the airforce forage cap and the veil of the<br />
nursing corps.<br />
Inscribed on this fountain are the words: " Look around you.<br />
These are the things they believed in". As the visitor<br />
looks around he or she will see our great national<br />
institutions of democracy, justice, art and learning truly<br />
the things Australia's servicemen and women believed in, and<br />
for which many of them died.<br />
Seeing that Parliament has unanimously expressed its thanks<br />
for this and the other gifts, it is a pleasure to be able to<br />
pass on those thanks to you personally and to assure you<br />
that its striking message will not be forgotten in<br />
Parliament House.<br />
I wish you well in your Congress deliberations. I sincerely<br />
hope that the process of consultation and discussion that<br />
has been so carefully fostered by Sir William Keys will<br />
continue it has been of great benefit to all veterans<br />
since the Labor Government took office. It is in the<br />
interests of veterans and the community at large that we<br />
build on these most recent achievements into the next<br />
quarter of a century. 1803: </p>
