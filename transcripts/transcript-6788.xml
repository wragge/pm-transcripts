FOR MEDIA November 21 1985<br />
The following message was sent to the new Prime Minister of<br />
Papua New Guinea, The Hon Paias Wingti:<br />
" on behalf of the Government of Australia I congratulate you<br />
on becoming Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea.<br />
I was glad to have had the opportunity of meeting you in<br />
Port Moresby in September and convey to you now my warmest<br />
regards and very best wishes in the testing times you will<br />
face ahead as you assume the burden of office. The good<br />
wishes of all Australians are with you.<br />
You take over the reins of Government as Papua New Guinea<br />
enters its second decade of Independence and you face great<br />
tasks including the further development of your country. I<br />
need hardly say that the Australian Government stands ready<br />
to extend sympathetic support and I look forward to working<br />
with you to support the closest and most cooperative<br />
relationship between our two Governments and people.<br />
This relationship has always been marked by very strong<br />
personal links between us at all levels. It is therefore my<br />
hope that we will be able to welcome you to Australia in the<br />
near future and I take this opportunity to extend an<br />
invitation to you to make an early visit to Australia." </p>
