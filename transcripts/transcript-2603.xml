CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY_ PRIME MINISTER<br />
LIBERAL PARTY FEDERAL COUNCIL MEETING<br />
CANBERRA 29 May 1972<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister,<br />
The Rt lion. William McMahon, M. P.<br />
INTRODUCTION<br />
Just 12 months ago, I addressed you for the<br />
first time as your Federal Parliamentary Leader and<br />
Prime Minister. It was then a troubled party. Not only<br />
were we going through the fires, ( if I can put it that<br />
way), but there were great, complex and difficult questions<br />
facing the People of Australia and particularly the people<br />
of our own Party.<br />
As I interpreted that situation, there was<br />
nothing else to do but to get straight down to work,<br />
producing new ideas, new approaches and new policies which<br />
would be to thc Nation's benefit and rejuvenate our<br />
political fortunes. This was urgent. Not because we<br />
lacked ideas and approaches attuned to the times but because,<br />
for understandable reasons, we were not getting action<br />
quickly enough. We had to adjust, deliberately and rapidly, our<br />
political life style and identity to the challenges and<br />
choices of social and political change in Australian<br />
society. My job was to see that this was done.<br />
As Le~ ader of the Government, it is my dut to<br />
translate Liberal policy into effective action. And to<br />
make each and every decision subject to one single overriding<br />
consideration. That consideration was the national<br />
interest, the welfare, the security and the progress of<br />
Australia and all Australians. </p>
<p>THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES<br />
As you will know, new policies of lasting value cannot be<br />
produced overnight. Individual effort was not enough. There had to<br />
be a co-operative effort. And so, as the Federal Parliamentary Leader<br />
and as Chairman of our Joint Standing Committee on Federal Policy, I<br />
set the Party as a whole to work. They got down to it and did<br />
the job. Quietly, with teamwork and patient determination the Liberal<br />
Party set out to adapt its policy-thinking to the changing oattern of<br />
attitudes and values, which were, and are, pervading Australian society.<br />
We set a premium on new ideas. We set up fourteen specialised<br />
sub-committees to review, renew and develop the whole range of our<br />
policies. Mr 9octhey has already referred to these committees. The<br />
Joint Standing Committee of our Party has now considered final reports<br />
from the Party Committees on nine nolicy issues on education, on<br />
health, the rule of law, urban notblems, the rural sector, defence,<br />
national. goals, immigration, and laour and industrial law.<br />
Reports and recommendations from the Standing Committee will<br />
also be presented soon on the quality of life, on social services,<br />
and on foreign affairs, as well as on nolitical matters such as<br />
who runs the Labor Party ( You can be sure the answer will not be<br />
Mr Whitlam), and the socialist alternative.<br />
What are the results of the Committee's decisions to date<br />
A number of Committee recommendations have already become Government<br />
policy because we decided they should not be hoarded. The nature of<br />
the policy-thinking that has gone on, and the results that are now<br />
flowing through, reflecting, as they do, Party thinking and ideas,<br />
show that the Liberal Party is a Party of the seventies. I think an<br />
important result is that the Liberal Party of Australia today is at<br />
least as productive of ideas and policy-thinking as at any time in the<br />
Party's history probably more so.<br />
Mr President, I turn now to three and only three of the<br />
many important subjects that I mentioned before which have been through<br />
the refining process of these policy committees.<br />
First, let me speak about Education. We are a literate society<br />
and education is crucially important in Liberal policy reviews and in<br />
Government actions. Education is a world where the humanities vie with<br />
the sciences and where technology, for the present, tends to dominate<br />
the scene. We accent this, but we must not let technology overwhelm us.<br />
We must so research and manage our educatinnal systems, that men and<br />
women are adequately equiopcd to fuitili ' themselves in their chosen<br />
spheres in a balanced society. We. must increase the opportunities for<br />
education, and we must improve its quality. Our testament on this<br />
philosophy was recently published in pamphlet form. And since then we<br />
have announced new and stimulating policies designed to help all<br />
Australian children in all Australian schools, Government and<br />
independent. I am sure the action we have taken opens up a new era<br />
in education in Australia. I know all Liberals will agree with me. / 3 </p>
<p>THE ECONOMIC BASE<br />
Mr President, before going further, I want to mention one<br />
essential precondition to the success of this strategy of new nolicy<br />
innovation, new xolicy formulation, and new policy presentation. And<br />
that precondition is, of course, a strong, diversified and structurally<br />
sound economy. This is fundamental to our success and to the realisation of<br />
our vision of the future. I don't need to tell you that we have had<br />
extremely difficult economic, industrial, and social problems to<br />
wrestle with. Our troubles have been aggravated by the end of the<br />
mining boom, problems with the primary industries, excessive rises in<br />
income and difficulties with international currency management and<br />
with world trade.<br />
The difficulties were compounded by the fact that today's<br />
economic problems are not necessarily as amenable to traditional<br />
analysis and resnonse as before. We were one of the leaders in the<br />
new thinking that has developed about changing and more complex<br />
economic conditions. As a consequence we have been deliberately more<br />
flexible in national economic management than ever before. Above all,<br />
we had to acknowledge frankly where predictions were wrong and act<br />
quickly to apply remedial action.<br />
Sir, with some experience in economic management, may t say<br />
I know that the flexible and resnonsive economic stance we t6ok un<br />
as early as last September is paying off. These measures all taken<br />
in very recent months have included<br />
Reductions in interest rates, public and private<br />
Increased grants to the States<br />
Increases in nensions and in aid for persons in nursing homes<br />
Special assistance to the wool industry<br />
Restoration of the investment allowance<br />
A mini-budget which included a reduction in personal taxation<br />
Increased grants for education, and<br />
A reduction in excise duty on wine.<br />
This is an impressive list.<br />
All these measures were directed towards reducing unemployment,<br />
encouraging sensible consumer spending, assisting needy sectors in<br />
industry, and securing a balanced growth economy. And we have never<br />
let up in our fight against inflation.<br />
I also want to refer to other matters bearing on the economy<br />
and the industrial scene in which the zovernment has made tremendous<br />
progress in less than a year. I mention<br />
1) The review of the arbitration and conciliation system ard the<br />
changes in the public service acts to enable the rule of no<br />
work no pay to apply amongst nostal workers.<br />
2) The decisions on trade nractices and the intention to establish<br />
a monopolies commission.<br />
3j The Treasury paner on foreign investment recently presented to<br />
Parliament. / 4 </p>
<p>4) The wide-ranging taxation review which is to be held.<br />
The white paper on defence.<br />
6) The impending survey of prices and incomes policies.<br />
I am sure that all this is contributing to a resurgence of<br />
confidence in Australia today in business, in industry and in<br />
Government. Next, let me refer to Health.<br />
The national health scheme is voluntary and therefore differs<br />
fundamentally fran Labor's p~ roposed compulsory scheme. It is based on<br />
one fundamental principle and that is -the interests of the patient<br />
must come first at all times. We have estbalished the principle that<br />
the amount insured patients pay to their doctors will be lim-ited. The<br />
amounts are small indeed compared with the normal cost of medical<br />
treatment. We want to keep it that way. That is -why we accepted the<br />
recommendations in the Mason Rep~ ort and why we are negotiating at present<br />
with the Australian Medical Association about the common fee.<br />
I would also remind you that under the existing health scheme<br />
the burden of large hospital bills has been lifted from the patient.<br />
Cabinet is now giving special attention to the problem of the chronically<br />
ill in nursing homes and nursing attention in Drivate homes. And we<br />
hope to be able to make known our decision soon.<br />
So too, with child care. There is a shortage of child care<br />
centres in Australia, and we are now considering what we can do about<br />
that problem. As well, we have been active over a wide range of public health<br />
We have taken warning action relating to the hazards to<br />
health of smoking by our requirements for TV advertising.<br />
We have made substantially increased grants for heart and cancer<br />
research, and we are prepared to support more extensively the work of<br />
the National Health and medical Research Council. </p>
<p>THE EIT, 7IRONVENT<br />
Now, let me turn to the environment.<br />
For each individual we seek a quality of life which must<br />
satisfy his needs in material, cultural and spiritual terms. A basic<br />
essential i3 to secure his environment so that the things necessary<br />
to fulfil those needs can germinate and flourish.<br />
The scientist and the sociologist have sounded their warnings<br />
around the world. Their voice is clearly heard here in Australia.<br />
They remind us that the destructive nolltion of our physical environment<br />
flows from the very successes of our industrial civilisation.<br />
A few days ago my Government outlined to the nation the measures<br />
it has in hand to protect the Australian environment. We stressed that<br />
this was a beginning. And it is just that. There is still much to be<br />
done. The challenge to free our society from the strangling grip<br />
of overcrowded cities is being taken up.<br />
So is the challenge of the changing balance of life in our<br />
rural areas.<br />
For an effective solution in a federation like ours, of course,<br />
this problem has to be dealt with on the basis of the most intimate<br />
co-operation with the Australian States.<br />
Urban renewal, the elimination of slums, the reduction of<br />
congestion, the planning of new cities and towns are at the heart of<br />
Liberal policy for the seventies.<br />
This is the basis of our approach to the future Australian<br />
environment and we will say much more about it as the year goes by. </p>
<p>6-<br />
Mr President, nay I turn to the domestic and international<br />
principles on which our policies are based.<br />
I am sure I don't need to emphasise to you that at home<br />
we are committed to sustaining the growth and development of this<br />
country. Believe me, we are succeeding, despite the temporary<br />
dI fficulties of the last year or two.<br />
We see national development as directed to growth, in<br />
the people's interest, in a climate of free enterprise and with<br />
incentives to individual initiatives.<br />
A full-scale examination is now being made to see whether<br />
any action is desirable in the national interest in circumstances<br />
where international corporations propose the takeover of Australian<br />
companies. We will not allow monopolies to destroy the healthy<br />
competition which Liberals believe is part of a free society and<br />
wholly beneficial to that society. We have already announced our<br />
intention to legislate for a Monopolies Commnission which among other<br />
things will examine proposed takeovers by other Australian or overseas<br />
companies which could result in monopolies or monopoly condition.<br />
Now, Mr President, let me say something about foreign<br />
investment in Australia. We have recently received the latest<br />
assessment of the impact such investment has made and is making in<br />
Australia. Shortly, several submissions will be made to Cabinet<br />
relating to the problems associated with cap~ ital inflows and the<br />
wisdom or otherwise of the need for regulation and control.<br />
But lot me strike one note ofl caution here. Foreign<br />
investment in Atralian industry has become an emotional issue as<br />
well as a matter for serious examination and some regulation. I ask<br />
you to all look at this matter in a commonsense way.<br />
The criterion which must determine our actions is what<br />
is in the best national interests of this country. And actions must<br />
be based on a hardheaded appreciation of benefits and costs. That<br />
is the attitude we, as Liberals, will take.<br />
The other great responsibility we bear is in our<br />
international relations. There is much of this that needs no<br />
emphasis. Lot me summrarise : We have become a moderately-sized<br />
power; we have become an industrialised nation; we are a good ally;<br />
we are respected and trusted; other nations want us to join them in<br />
co-operative efforts.<br />
So far so good, but what does the future hold?<br />
We have ties with Britain, and a crucial alliance with America. We<br />
have mutual ties and arrangements with our friends in Asia, in<br />
trade and aid, in cultural exchange, and in do-fence. We have mature<br />
relationships with the old world and the new world. We are deeply<br />
involved and deeply committed in Asia.<br />
As liberals, you will recognise the commonsense and<br />
value of such outward-looking and multilateral policies. They have </p>
<p>4 0. -7<br />
been, in large part, the product of liberal initiative. We must<br />
sustain these principles in the national interest. We must increase<br />
our own capability in both '~ ecivil and defence spheres.<br />
Shortly, I will visit three of our friends in the<br />
South-East Asian region in Indonesia, in Singapore and in Malaysia.<br />
It will be a goodwill visit to neighbours, a return of courtesies and<br />
the refreshment of old friendships.<br />
These visits will be made in the midst of momentous<br />
changes in the contemporary world. The journeys of President Nixon<br />
bear witness to this. Britain will soon be in the Common Market;<br />
Japan has become our best customer; the pattern of world trade is<br />
changing, and we are pursuing genuine efforts to develop a dialogue<br />
with China, and at the same time we remain unwilling to abandon our<br />
friends in Taiwan. These approaches demonstrate both the will anO the<br />
willingness to play our part in a world of interdependence, and to<br />
play it in a healthy, vigorous independent Liberal and Australian<br />
way. THE LABOR ALTERNATIVE<br />
Mr President, I come now to the alternative being<br />
presented to the Australian people in this election year. It is<br />
absolutely essential that we must take the mask off Labor policy<br />
as often as we can. it is time the people know the dangers of<br />
a Labor alternative. Let me make these points crf comparison and difference.<br />
1) On liberty.<br />
We stand for the individual for his freedom, his initiatives<br />
and his opportunities.<br />
Labcr stands for socialism, for the all-powerful state,<br />
bureaucratic, anonymous, unfeeling.<br />
2) On the law.<br />
We believe in freedom of speech and assembly, and of dissent<br />
within the law.<br />
Labor tolerates disrespect for, and oven breaches of, the law.<br />
3) On Australia's security.<br />
We beieve that treaties involve responsibilities and we stand<br />
ready to h'rnour them. The ANZUS Treaty is the cornerstone<br />
of our security.<br />
The Labor Party stands for isolation in defence it scorns<br />
meaningful treaties and arrangements with friendly powers.<br />
It gives lip service only to an ANZUS Treaty with the<br />
heart and soul torn out of it. </p>
<p>4) On responsibility. We arc~ free to act and interuret our Policies and<br />
platform without duress or interference.<br />
The Labor Party in the Parliament is dictated<br />
to by the Party outside. It is a Party in chains.<br />
We have great responsibilities to Protect the<br />
nation from being locked in a straitjacket of socialism. We<br />
must safeguard the future of this great nation.<br />
Post-war progress of the Australian nation is<br />
our inheritance and its future safety and prosperity is<br />
our destiny. It is our job as Liberals to fulfil these<br />
responsibilities with vigour, with honestY and with imagination.<br />
I know we are equipped to do it and to do it in<br />
a manner and with a purpose that matches the times in which<br />
we live. I thank you. 8 </p>
