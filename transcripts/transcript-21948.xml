    <content><![CDATA[<p>The National Counter-Terrorism Plan is the primary document on Australia's national counter-terrorism policy and arrangements. It sets out the collaborative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories for preventing, preparing for and responding to terrorist incidents within Australia.</p>
<p> The Plan was recently reviewed by the National Counter-Terrorism Committee to take into account the lessons of Australia's first multi-jurisdictional counter-terrorism exercise Mercury 04 held in March 2004, as well as other developments in the national arrangements since I first launched the Plan in June 2003.</p>
<p> A revised second edition of the Plan was endorsed by Leaders at yesterday's Council of Australian Governments' meeting.  Electronic copies are available from the National Security Website (<a href="http://www.national.security.gov.au">www.national.security.gov.au</a>).</p>
