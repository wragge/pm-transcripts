SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF " DIVERSITY IS GREAT, MATE"<br />
NORTH PERTH 16 JULY 1989<br />
Premier Peter Dowding,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I am delighted and genuinely proud to be here today, back in<br />
the city of my youth, to launch this publication on<br />
community relations in the inner-city area of Perth.<br />
The booklet is the result of a project commissioned some<br />
eighteen months ago by my own Office of Multicultural<br />
Affairs and the Western Australian Multicultural and Ethnic<br />
Affairs Commission.<br />
It is the product of an exhaustive and probing examination<br />
of how a community of contemporary Australians learn, work<br />
and live together.<br />
The North Perth project set out to examine how an ethnically<br />
and culturally diverse community worked in practice how<br />
the people here live and relate to one another.<br />
North Perth is a microcosm of multicultural Australia. It<br />
is an old centre born again with a new generation of<br />
residents. In the area covered by the survey, forty five<br />
per cent of the local population was born overseas many of<br />
them have arrived in recent years from countries in Asia.<br />
So North Perth offers much for us to learn about the<br />
Australia our children these children will inherit.<br />
Will it be a nation-divided by animosity and racial<br />
friction? Or will it be a diverse and rich community;<br />
stimulated, not frightened by its own variety; and united by<br />
a shared commitment to this great country and to all of the<br />
best things that distinguish Australians?<br />
The answer is, I hope and believe, indicated in this report. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Over the last few years, the increasing diversity of<br />
Australia's population has been accompanied by increasing<br />
community debate about immigration. Some have claimed that<br />
the intake of immigrants, particularly from Asian countries,<br />
inevitably threatens Australia's social cohesion.<br />
That is a view that bears no critical examination. The<br />
exam Iple We have of the inner-city area of Perth gives the<br />
lie to such claims.. It proves, above all else, that it is<br />
not diversity itself that is divisive, but rather prejudice<br />
and intolerance..<br />
What the researchers found, when they came here, was a<br />
community of people living in a peaceful and industrious<br />
manner people who like the area and feel positive toward<br />
its diversity people whose diversity is combined with<br />
respect and acceptance.<br />
Here we have an example, repeated throughout Australia, of a<br />
truly multicultural community in which persons of differing<br />
ethnic, cultural and linguistic heritages are able to relate<br />
to each other on equal terms; in which one's position in<br />
society is not determined by one's birthplace or ethnic<br />
background; in which people are judged by what they say and<br />
do and not by what they look like; in which an Australian is<br />
not someone who conforms to a particular stereotype but<br />
whose commitment is to Australia.<br />
Because that's what's important. It doesn't matter where<br />
you were born, or how long your family has been in<br />
Australia, or what is your colour, creed or race. What's<br />
important is your commitment to Australia.<br />
What has distinguished so many of the people who have come<br />
to Australia to build a new life here is that quality of<br />
commitment. And what characterises the North Perth<br />
community depicted in this survey is, ultimately, the<br />
deepseated commitment of its people to Australia.<br />
So these findings are both optimistic and challenging<br />
Optimistic, because they are a clear indication that a<br />
harmonious multicultural society can be and is being<br />
achieved; Challenging, because they question the views of many who<br />
have expressed fears and concerns about the ethnic<br />
diversity and composition of our society.<br />
Indeed, both the optimists and the pessimists should welcome<br />
this report. For the optimists it vindicates their faith.<br />
For the pessimists, it should alleviate their fears. </p>
<p>The multicultural policies of my Government have been<br />
developed and adopted as a key social policy in recognition<br />
of the unique diversity of ethnic, linguistic, cultural and<br />
religious Qrigins and identities of the Australian<br />
community.<br />
They are policies which aim to ensure that all Australians,<br />
irrespective of background, have an equal opportunity to<br />
participate in the cultural and political life of the<br />
nation; to shape the decisions that affect them; to obtain<br />
their fair entitlement to Government services; and, within<br />
the law, to enjoy their own culture, practise their own<br />
religion and use their own language, as well as English.<br />
Multiculturalism has three essential elements. First, we<br />
should support the right of individuals to maintain their<br />
cultural identity, within the constraints of Australian law.<br />
Multiculturalism promotes a climate of mutual acceptance in<br />
which diversity, not conformity, is seen as a virtue and a<br />
strength. Second, we must recognise the social justice dimension of<br />
multiculturalism. Australians cannot have a fair go if they<br />
face barriers and prejudice against their colour, their<br />
command of English, their religion or ethnic background.<br />
The third aspect of multiculturalism is integral to the<br />
economic future of Australia. Failure to remove inequities<br />
based on ethnic origin would mean a waste of human<br />
resources. At this time, more than ever, we must cultivate<br />
and utilise the skills and talents of all Australians,<br />
regardless of their background. In this fundamental sense<br />
all Australians, whether first generation or eighth, have a<br />
vested interest in the policy.<br />
Multiculturalism is for all Australians and it requires, and<br />
deserves, the whole-hearted support of all of us as<br />
individuals because, in a very real sense, we all stand to<br />
gain from it.<br />
It is in this context that I will be launching a package of<br />
measures, a National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia,<br />
on 26 July.<br />
The National Agenda is an agenda for all Australia and for<br />
all Australians. It will serve to remind us of the<br />
significant contribution that immigrants have made to<br />
Australia, to our culture and to our economy. But it also<br />
highlights the fact that more needs to be done if we are<br />
fully to utilise the skills and knowledge of our migrant<br />
communities. </p>
<p>There is still prejudice and intolerance in sections of the<br />
Australian community. Indeed, the bus shelters, telephone<br />
booths and blank walls of this city are defaced each week<br />
with the posters of anger and hate.<br />
I know that Premier Dowding and his Government are intent on<br />
eliminating this shameful face of Australia. Governments of<br />
all persuasions have a responsibility to show courage and<br />
leadership in the face of such cruel intolerance.<br />
You can be assured that my Government will be making its<br />
contribution in terms of a determined community relations<br />
campaign when we launch the National Agenda 10 days from<br />
now. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased I have come to North<br />
Perth today. It has given me renewed confidence that the<br />
Australia we will bequeath our children will be a place<br />
worth living in. It certainly will be if it is a place like<br />
North Perth. </p>
