SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
LAUNCH OF THE BURMA THAILAND RAILWAY. CANBERRA<br />
FRIDAY 23 APRIL 1993<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Thank you very much for inviting me here today, to say a<br />
few words about this fascinating and unique book.<br />
Last year, of course, it was the fiftieth anniversary of<br />
many of the battles fought in defence of Australia, and<br />
it was my privilege on several occasions to pay tribute<br />
to those Australian servicemen and women to whom we owe<br />
so much.<br />
I visited some of the battlegrounds most notably, I<br />
suppose, Kokoda: and I have not had a more moving<br />
experience in all of my public life.<br />
For a nation which has been so involved in wars this<br />
century, we have also been a long way removed from war:<br />
and I think that may be why these places like Kokoda,<br />
or the war cem~ eteries at Boma outside Port Moresby, or at<br />
Lae have such a disturbing effect when we first<br />
encounter them.<br />
My generation was profoundly lucky: we all knew, I think,<br />
that our parents and our grandparents generations had<br />
gone through experiences of a kind that we were never<br />
likely to confront.<br />
For instance, I knew about Singapore, and about Borneo<br />
about Sandakan because my father's brother had been<br />
there, arnd died there. But I was not taught about it at<br />
school, and there was very little to read about it.<br />
We knew the wars through legend and ritual.<br />
And we knew World War I better than we knew World War 11.<br />
But we really didn't know what it had been like.<br />
And, in any case, the generations who fought in the two<br />
World Wars tended to keep their memories to themselves.<br />
We grew up aware of the wars but remarkably innocent of<br />
the experience of war. </p>

And that, I think, is why we are shocked when we see the<br />
gravestones which remind us of how many died, and their<br />
ages, and what they must have gone through, arnd the<br />
people they left behind.<br />
This is the 75th anniversary of the end of World War I.<br />
Later this year I hope there may be an opportunity to<br />
visit those battlefields in Northern Francs where so many<br />
Australians lost their lives. I sincerely hope it is<br />
possible to go, because these places are truly sacred to<br />
Australia. But the battlefields of the Asian and Pacific war are<br />
also sacred. In the next few years I hope the<br />
battlefields of New Guinea, Borneo, Singapore and Malaya<br />
and Burma and Thailand will become as important to<br />
our historical understanding as the battlefields of the<br />
middle East and Europe were to earlier generations of<br />
Australians. Everyone should know about these battles.<br />
Above all, they should know about the subject of this<br />
book the prisoners of war who worked on the Burma-<br />
Thailand Railway.<br />
No Australian soldiers suffered more than these. Few had<br />
more reason to feel betrayed or neglected before,<br />
during and after their capture. None had to call on<br />
such reserves of faith and spirit as they did: faith in<br />
themselves;, faith in each other; faith I like to think<br />
in Australia, what they had created there arnd what they<br />
hoped to create.<br />
Whatever they may have thought, in historical terms they<br />
were doing more than Just surviving.<br />
As Gavan McCormack and Hank Nelson point out these were<br />
the first Australians to go en masse into South East<br />
Asia. They saw it and dealt with its peoples as no other<br />
Australians ever had.<br />
They also saw the British empire as few Australians had<br />
ever seen it and it led a lot of them to conclude that<br />
we Australians had evolved into a different race. it<br />
raised their sense of an independent identity.<br />
So, it may be that in time the 8th Division will be seen<br />
as something more than soldiers or prisoners of war but<br />
as the first pioneers of Australia in Asia. The<br />
frontiersmen. Somehow I think it would be the highest tribute we could<br />
pay them both those who died and those who managed to<br />
survive. </p>

Such a tribute would depend on our succeeding in Asia, of<br />
course. It will mean that we will have to succeed<br />
economically as an entirely independent nation, aware<br />
of necessity and confident of both our identity and our<br />
capabilities. And that will depend on our developing greater mutual<br />
understanding between the countries of Asia and<br />
ourselves, greater mutual respect.<br />
The men and women discussed in this book very often did<br />
just that -they developed a deep respect for the Chinese<br />
and the Malays, the people of Borneo and Ambon and<br />
Sumatra who very often risked their lives to help them.<br />
They found in all sorts of circumstances that they shared<br />
common human ground with people they had, for cultural<br />
and historical reasons, been inclined to patronise or<br />
despise. There's surely a lesson in it we can come to terms with<br />
the countries of Asia and in doing so, far from<br />
sacrificing our identity or our principles, strengthen<br />
them.<br />
There's surely also a lesson in the accounts this book<br />
contains: that so much of the unconscionable treatment of<br />
prisoners came from what the Japanese had been taught.<br />
My old friend, Tom Uren, might say it is lesson in the<br />
nature of fascism and he's right. But it's also a<br />
lesson in ignorance, and parochialism. It's a lesson in<br />
culture and education.<br />
That Is why we should teach the story of the war.<br />
Because the men and women who fought In those battles and<br />
suffered and died in those camps should be remembered and<br />
honoured. And because there is great deal for us to<br />
learn, both about ourselves and about Asia, in reading<br />
about these experiences.<br />
Which gets me back to the most important question to<br />
confront us every Anzac Day: we are left to wonder what<br />
they died for.<br />
We say they died for Australia: the question is, what<br />
sort of Australia? What sort of Australia is it<br />
incumbent on us to create?<br />
Tom Uren and Weary Dunlop would have very different<br />
political views on this I'm sure.<br />
Yet they would agree on some basic things: they would<br />
agree that Australia will succeed best if it incorporates<br />
into its daily life and the conduct of its affairs the<br />
principles of fellowship and cooperation and care for<br />

each other. Mateship Is as good a word as any other to<br />
describe it.<br />
It has been around for a long time, that word and those<br />
principles. But I'm inclined to think that it is only in<br />
the last decade or so that we have begun to realise just<br />
what a powerful force they can be in the economic life of<br />
a country and in seeing a country through great changes<br />
and hard times.<br />
Mateship was never tested so much as on the Burma Railway<br />
and, for all the tragedy, nowhere was the triumph of<br />
mateship so emphatic. Mateship and the human spirit.<br />
if we imbue all our endeavours in the next decade with<br />
those principles I am sure we will succeed and if we<br />
succeed, we will have paid the prisoners on the Burma<br />
Thailand Railway the greatest possible tribute.<br />
we will have created a prosperous Australian democracy,<br />
built on those values and one in which they are secure.<br />
Hank Nelson and Gavan McCormack have done us all a great<br />
service with this book. So have all the other<br />
contributors -Australian, Japanese and Korean.<br />
I congratulate them all and with great pleasure declare<br />
The Burma-Thailand Railway the book officially<br />
launched. </p>
