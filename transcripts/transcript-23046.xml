    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Government will provide much needed assistance to those affected by the devastating bushfires still raging in New South Wales by making available the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP).</p>
<p>While the full extent of damage caused by the bushfires is still unfolding, the payment of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child will assist those already affected, particularly those who have lost their homes or suffered damage, are seriously injured or have lost an immediate family member.</p>
<p>The AGDRP will be made available in the following severely affected areas: Blue Mountains, Lithgow, Muswellbrook, Port Macquarie-Hastings, Port Stephens, Wyong and Wingecarribee.</p>
<p>The AGDRP payment is in addition to the joint funded Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, which provides assistance to individuals and families, including emergency food, clothing and accommodation.</p>
<p>As the situation is still unfolding, the Government will continue to assess whether broader relief and recovery assistance may be needed. We will work closely with the NSW Government to ensure the recovery needs of the affected communities are met.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the heroic efforts of the firefighters for their courage in battling the fires and protecting individuals and communities under threat.</p>
<p>Further information about assistance payments is available on the Australian Governmentâ€™s Disaster Assist website at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au/">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a> or on 180 2266.</p>
