TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL MURPHY, " DATELINE", SBS TV, 17 FEBRUARY<br />
1996 E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, welcome to Dateline.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
J: If I can start with foreign policy which is as close to your heart,<br />
of course, as domestic matters and can I start first with Indonesia?<br />
Now the recent treaty/ agreement that you negotiated was done in<br />
secret, nobody knew anything about it, the voters didn't, and no<br />
Parliamentary scrutiny and now your critics say, ' It was undemocratic'.<br />
Why do it that way?<br />
PM: Well they are all done that way and the Liberal Party would have<br />
people I mean they couldn't have done it and they wanted everyone<br />
to think that there was then something wrong with it. In fact, you might<br />
recall, that one of the things I said when I challenged Bob Hawke was<br />
I wanted to put the relationship with Indonesia on a proper footing.<br />
It is our largest nearest neighbour. Their security outlook has great<br />
similarities with our own and in proposing this idea to<br />
President Soeharto and the two of us having thought about it over<br />
time, we needed time and he needed time to discuss this with the<br />
army, with the defence forces there.<br />
In other words, this is not something that can be negotiated in public<br />
and in this country we have elections every three years you give a<br />
Government a mandate. Our mandate was closer integration with<br />
East Asia and particularly with Indonesia. All this is within the<br />
mandate.<br />
J: But what does it actually mean, the military aspect of it? Does it mean,<br />
for instance, that Australians might find themselves in potential trouble<br />
spots like East Timor, Aceh, Irian Jaya? </p>
<p>PM: No, I think, it means that we are declaring, first of all, trust in one<br />
another. More than anything else, it is a declaration of trust to say that<br />
Indonesia has no territorial designs on Australia and vice versa.<br />
And not only do we trust one another, but we do recognise that we<br />
have a common strategic outlook and that we will consult if our<br />
security interests are threatened.<br />
J: Well what is in it for the Indonesians?<br />
PM: I think what is in it for them is knowing that the largest continental<br />
power near it is a declared friend, so much so that it has a treaty of<br />
security common between us, common to us, and that it will take from<br />
us what it thinks it has in our maturity in foreign policy, in our defence<br />
structure, in our strategic outlook, in our strategic judgements.<br />
I think it gets all of that.<br />
J: Does it mean that we are a bit more cautious in criticising Indonesia on<br />
their human rights record?<br />
PM: No, it doesn't mean that all. I think this, again, is the benefit of a<br />
quality relationship, a real relationship, rather than just a thin foreign<br />
policy relationship is that you can speak about all of the difficult issues<br />
and I have always done this with President Soeharto.<br />
J: A bit of a sidelight, the democratic politician in Hong Kong, Martin Lee,<br />
has said that you ' put trade before human rights'.<br />
PM: That is completely untrue and we have supported Christopher Patten<br />
in his democratic attempts at democratisation, though I will say for the<br />
British, at exactly one minute to midnight, they had 100 years of course<br />
to do some of this and didn't do it. But wherever someone wants to<br />
keep democratic structures or improve them, of course, we are always<br />
supporting them and we have supported him in Hong Kong.<br />
J: Now your thrust into Asia, especially APEC, is very obvious. Although<br />
you say, of course, we are Australians, we are not Asians, but we are<br />
part of the region and the Opposition seems to go along with that and<br />
yet Alexander Downers says, that you seem obsessed with Asia at the<br />
expense of Europe and the rest of the world.<br />
PM: Yes, well, of course, this is just code for them keeping their old<br />
allegiances and while we, in the Government, have good relationships<br />
better than good with the United States. We are one of its, I think,<br />
key partners in the region and also with Europe. This is where we live.<br />
per cent of our exports go to the Asia-Pacific. This is the place<br />
where we have to find our future and they are very uncomfortable<br />
about that. They want security from Asia. The Labor Government<br />
wants security in Asia.<br />
J: Right. </p>
<p>PM: And there is all the world of difference in security from Asia and<br />
security in Asia.<br />
J: But how seriously do the Asians, and particularly giants like China,<br />
take us?<br />
PM: I think seriously indeed, Paul. Just take APEC. Before APEC there<br />
was no forum where the Chinese leadership would meet the Japanese<br />
leadership, or the Korean leadership, or any one of them would meet<br />
others. The one forum which has been developed Australia has had a<br />
major role in and that is APEC. When I first proposed that we should<br />
develop a Heads of Government body, very few people gave it a<br />
chance. But gradually we built a consensus for it and President Clinton then<br />
issued the invitation and the first meeting was held in Seattle, the<br />
second in Indonesia, and the third in Osaka. As a consequence, we<br />
have now built the primary and I emphasise primary piece of<br />
political architecture in the Asia-Pacific for the region. And I think<br />
China appreciates that, I think the Japanese appreciate that, I think the<br />
Indonesians appreciate that.<br />
J: Even Dr Mahathir? Because your relations are now correct, if not<br />
warm, but he still wants his EAEC his Caucus and, of course, he<br />
doesn't want us in that.<br />
PM: Well the EAEC, so called, has never met. But, I think, the Malaysians<br />
take the view too that APEC offers such opportunities. And the thing<br />
about it is, Paul, not just economic opportunities. When you have a<br />
set of leaders for instance, before the Osaka meeting, President<br />
Jiang Zemin of China visited South Korea.<br />
Now it is very hard to imagine, you know, the President and Chief of<br />
the military of China visiting South Korea and I spoke to him about it.<br />
And a large part of that is APEC. He sees President Kim Young Sam<br />
at APEC meetings, they sit beside one another, they speak, so why not<br />
visit? In other words, APEC is changing the whole strategic<br />
environment.<br />
J: Okay, and you are saying that you are having quite an influence with<br />
Asian leaders. You also have said that they have no interest in<br />
dealing with John Howard. Now who has told you that?<br />
PM: Well just examine this point. Do Muoi, the Leader of Vietnam, the<br />
General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, who is turning<br />
Vietnam into a market economy, visited this country, his first visit ever<br />
to the West. </p>
<p>John Howard would not see him. Tim Fischer wouldn't see him.<br />
Alexander Downer wouldn't see him. And I accompanied him along<br />
the Queensland coast for two days, because they have a lot of bauxite,<br />
took him to see the aluminium smelters, took him to see the tourism<br />
projects. He was continually being embarrassed by questions:<br />
Why won't Mr Howard see you? And some other ASEAN leaders have<br />
asked me: Why didn't Mr Howard see Do Muoi?<br />
J: Which leaders?<br />
PM: Well I am not here to tell you all the conversations I have, but I assure<br />
you it was noticed because they are full members of ASEAN and when<br />
Mr Howard decided not to meet the leadership of a full member of<br />
ASEAN, this raises eyebrows around the region. Paul, I made this<br />
clear in this remark, of course the leadership of the region would see<br />
the Australian Prime Minister whoever that might be. But what the<br />
Australian Prime Minister has got to be able to do is to get them to<br />
deal, in this case, with him.<br />
J: And you are saying you can do that better than John Howard?<br />
PM: Well, I think, that is proven to be the case.<br />
J: Look, just on another related topic. Australia has been excluded from,<br />
or not invited to, the Asia-European Union's Summit. Does that<br />
concern you?<br />
PM: Not particularly, Neither Gareth Evans, nor 1, put very great store in<br />
this. I think the first meeting will be a get-to-know-you meeting..<br />
I think the likelihood is the region would like us at the second. This<br />
has certainly been the view of Japan and that is fine, we would be<br />
happy to go along. I<br />
J: And now you see, just before we go to domestic issues, APEC<br />
building, getting stronger all the time and particularly our relationship<br />
with China being of principal importance?<br />
PM: Well, Paul, what is happening in East Asia is without precedent in<br />
history. When you think of the wealth of the 19th century and the<br />
industrial revolution, the English who built abbeys for themselves<br />
across the English countryside, the great American families the<br />
Camnegies, the Melons, the railway barons, the coal barons, the Fricks<br />
it came from relatively small populations, you know, 15 million or so<br />
in Britain, 50 or 60 million in the United States.<br />
There is 2.5 billion people in Asia. The economies are growing at 8<br />
and 10 per cent a year. It is going to be a wealth phenomenon<br />
unprecedented in human history and we are in the middle of it.<br />
And to not understand that, to say that we are obsessed with it as<br />
Mr Downer says, or to be looking as Mr Howard says to Whitehall and </p>
<p>to Washington and not understanding that we are in the centre of the<br />
biggest growth phenomenon in history..<br />
J: Yes.<br />
PM: is not to be able to lead this country properly.<br />
J: Okay, Prime Minister, let's turn to domestic matters and plenty has<br />
been happening in the past few days. But, overall, this is a<br />
competition of promises, expensive ones too, and I know you have<br />
been asked this before and it may irritate you, but why won't you throw<br />
open the books as your opponents are asking you so that we can see<br />
whether a surplus really does exist?<br />
PM: Well let me just put the question this way. Let's say it was a November<br />
election, the Budget is introduced into Parliament in October and it is<br />
passed in November, so what would we do in a November election<br />
go and re-do the whole Budget, wind the Treasury up into another<br />
huge forecasting round? You know, would the Budget, just two months<br />
old, not be good enough?<br />
So what does that tell us? It tells us there should be a principle here<br />
and the principle here should be the publication of the forward<br />
estimates of receipts and outlays, publication of the forward estimates<br />
of the Budget balance, and the within year reconciliations and at the<br />
appropriate time because the forecasting round is a very large<br />
undertaking, it takes a long time and it requires huge resources.<br />
And let's say with this election, I called it for 2 March. From the day<br />
I called it to the development of a forecasting round, the election would<br />
just about be over probably over before it was complete.<br />
J: But can you fund your promises? Are you confident of what Treasury<br />
has been telling you and Ralph Willis and Mr Beazley?<br />
PM: When I was the Treasurer, I was the first Treasurer in history ever to<br />
produce a Budget surplus. I produced four of them. Mr Willis has<br />
produced this Budget surplus and the Budget, in prospect, for the<br />
out-years is in surplus.<br />
By contrast, Mr Howard left me, as Treasurer, the equivalent today of a<br />
Budget deficit of $ 22 billion.<br />
J: He says you exaggerate that.<br />
PM: Well it was 4 1/ 2 per cent of GDP. Go and pick up the Treasury<br />
documents from 1983/ 84. 4 1/ 2 per cent of GDP. GDP this year, Paul,<br />
is $ 520 billion. What is 4 1/ 2 per cent of $ 520 billion about<br />
$ 22 billion. </p>
<p>J: Okay.<br />
PM: So, in other words, in his sly trickiness he sat mum on the real<br />
numbers in the critical days of an election campaign and then left the<br />
Government of the day, us, saddled with a $ 22 billion problem.<br />
J: He is saying that you might be sitting mum in the same way?<br />
PM: But what is the debate whether the Budget is in surplus or not, not<br />
$ 22 billion in deficit. I mean the debate is a joke of a debate. I mean<br />
he is out there saying, ' I will legislate to stop this'. I said yesterday it is<br />
like Ronald Biggs saying he won't rob trains anymore. I mean this is a<br />
man who has the singular distinction of producing the largest fiscal<br />
deterioration in the history of our federation.<br />
J: These 100 very wealthy, allegedly, tax avoiders who will net you<br />
$ 800 million, I think, extra in revenue. Why suddenly discover them<br />
during a campaign?<br />
PM: Because we gave the Tax Office the resources to do enhanced audits<br />
and surveillance of individuals and ran these massive computer<br />
programs to find the commonality of these hundreds of trusts.<br />
Some taxpayers have six or seven hundred trusts, ostensibly all<br />
independent and different and not having common names.<br />
It is not easy, Paul, and the Tax Office found that and first notified the<br />
Government first notified the Government in November.<br />
So we have taken the obvious steps. It took John Howard three years<br />
to deal with tax avoidance and in the 1970s and the early 1980s, the<br />
tax avoidance wasn't avoidance, it was criminal evasion and it took<br />
him three years to do something about it and he only did it when he<br />
had a Royal Commission report around his ears.<br />
J: You have made the point this week that we have got a growing<br />
economy. Do you fear that inflation will take off and, the old cycle<br />
again, you will have to raise interest rates?<br />
PM: No. Well, Paul, let me just go back to what we promised last election.<br />
We would start growth. What have we had on average for three<br />
years, 4 1/ 2 per cent. We said we would go to 500,00 jobs.<br />
What have we got to 713,000. We said we would produce low<br />
inflation. What have we had 2 1/ 2 per cent. In other words, we have<br />
had the trifecta and been right at the top of the western world league<br />
table.<br />
J: And yet that awful problem of youth unemployment remains. What can<br />
you do about that?<br />
PM: Let's try and get this into perspective again because there is so much<br />
confusion put about it. There are 1.3 million young Australians </p>
<p>between the age of 15 and 19. 88,000 now are out of work. That is<br />
6.78 per cent.<br />
J: It is a lot.<br />
PM: I know, but it is not 30 per cent. What the Liberals try and imply is that<br />
per cent of the 15 to 19 year olds are out of work. It is only<br />
per cent when I say, only, it is 20-odd per cent which is again<br />
too high of the group looking for work.<br />
J: Yes.<br />
PM: But if you take it as a group there is 1.3 million young Australians in<br />
the 15 to 19 group, the numbers looking for work are less than the<br />
unemployment rate in the general population.<br />
J: So you can assure parents, concerned parents, desperately<br />
concerned parents, that you are going to get results on this?<br />
PM: Well young people are taking jobs up at a rate of knots, Paul, and we<br />
are getting there were 158,000 young people 15 to 19 unemployed<br />
when John Howard left office. There are 88,000 this day, this month.<br />
Now, I think, those clear statistics make it very clear. But the more<br />
general point is there are 1.3 million young Australians in this group<br />
and 6.78 per cent are unemployed.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how do you answer the jibe from many critics, not just<br />
your political opponents, that 13 years hard Labor is long enough?<br />
That even your Cabinet must be tired and jaded, even possibly<br />
yourself?<br />
PM: Well over half the Cabinet were not there three years ago.<br />
The Government is, in fact, four years old. It was a new Government<br />
when I became Prime Minister, with a new policy direction and we<br />
used the opportunity in 1993 to turn over half the Cabinet. In fact, in<br />
1983 the average age of the Government was 47 years.<br />
Now, 13 years on, the average age is still 47 years and why is it still<br />
47 years, because so much new blood has come into the Government,<br />
come into the Cabinet.<br />
J: Sure, but then how do you counteract that feeling that might well be<br />
out there in the electorate, give John Howard a go?<br />
PM: Yes, a change.<br />
J: Why not give him a go because that wily old campaigner and former<br />
colleague of yours, Graham Richardson, thinks that they are coasting<br />
to victory? </p>
<p>PM: Well they say a change, time for a change. But a change to what?<br />
To John Howard, to Tim Fischer, to Alexander Downer, to<br />
Peter Costello, to Bronwyn Bishop?<br />
J: So you are saying there is no reason to change?<br />
PM: I mean how could anyone believe that John Howard, and Tim Fischer,<br />
and Alexander Downer, and Peter Costello, and Bronwyn Bishop<br />
would run this country and understand the issues better than I, who<br />
have been there in a ministerial office for this time; Kim Beazley, my<br />
Deputy; Gareth Evans, the Foreign Minister; Ralph Willis, the<br />
Treasurer. I mean there is something very valuable here and, I think, the nation<br />
will be very careful before they destroy it for something of much less<br />
value.<br />
J: Do you think the nation is getting sick of your personal style? I mean<br />
I know you think that arrogance is a stupid charge, but I mean do you<br />
think they are getting sick of it?<br />
PM: Well it is a stupid charge. I mean real arrogance is not showing<br />
people your policies, not telling people what you will do and that is<br />
what Mr Howard has shown right through the period he has been<br />
Opposition Leader. ' I won't show that Mr Keating my policy', he says.<br />
But I only get one vote, Paul. What he is really doing is not showing<br />
the Australian people and that is real arrogance. I mean that is rancid<br />
arrogance and it may suit the Liberals to say, ' They don't like my<br />
debating style'. But my democratic style is exceptionally democratic.<br />
And you know the day before yesterday when I said, we would have a<br />
plebiscite to see whether Australians wanted an Australian Head of<br />
State, wanted an Australian person as their Head of State...<br />
J: And yet Bill Hayden says we have got one already?<br />
PM: Mr Howard said it was cheap populism. In other words, if we ask each<br />
Australian elector to cast a vote, it is cheap. But we have 300 people<br />
appointed by him, locked in a room, as a convention, that is all<br />
democratic.<br />
J: But he says your plebiscite is just a toy one.<br />
PM: Well they always have these elite, anti-democratic sentiments.<br />
What I am trying to say to you is we put our policies out there, we<br />
explain ourselves, if we want to move to something like a republic we<br />
will ask the nation. It is the biggest poll you could ever have. It is the<br />
most democratic expression you could ever give and for Mr Howard to<br />
say it is cheap, reflects I think very poorly on him. </p>
<p>J: Alright, Prime Minister. Let's get on to multicultural ism and, of course,<br />
that has been much in the news over the past few days and<br />
immigration and, of course, it means recognising the marvellous<br />
diversity of Australia. But how do you allay the fears of some<br />
Australians, dare I suggest it Graeme Campbell, that in some way it is<br />
a fad?<br />
PM: I think the event of great significance to Australia in this century has<br />
been the post-war migration program. It has made Australia a<br />
stronger, more diverse, more interesting, more vibrant place. It has,<br />
if anything, strengthened our own democratic fabric and what the<br />
Coalition did this week, in terms of their costings, in terms of their cuts,<br />
they are going to take about 10 per cent of their total cuts<br />
$ 600-odd million off migrants, off the children of migrants.<br />
Mr Howard says he is a family man, but he is not for the dependants of<br />
migrants and after a couple of years here, migrants slip into the same<br />
unemployment patterns as the rest of the country. So why would you<br />
not support them with Social Security or unemployment benefits if<br />
other than for callous reasons? Why wouldn't you support their<br />
children? Why are they now altering the family reunion category so<br />
now they are making English a prime requirement for family reunion?<br />
That means for most families, a lot of families, that mothers and<br />
fathers, and sisters, and brothers, will not be joining them here.<br />
J: Right and, of course, none of this you would do, all your commitments<br />
will stay the same. You don't think you are being a bit savage on<br />
Mr Howard though do you?<br />
PM: Oh, well, Paul, let me just go to the details, let me not leave you with<br />
any impression that 370,000 people born outside Australia take a<br />
new job. Under Mr Howard, they are to end up in jobs with poor pay<br />
and conditions and there will be no alternative support in the Social<br />
Security system.<br />
per cent of Mr Howard's savings, a huge part of his Budget, relies<br />
on attacking these most vulnerable people, that is those who have<br />
been here for less than two years and their children.<br />
On immigration he is saying that he ' would be much tougher in respect<br />
of imposing an English language requirement across the board for the<br />
concessional family component', making it much tougher for families to<br />
reunite and the funding for citizenship education he will slash by<br />
$ 16 million.<br />
So you have got the candidate in Leichhardt for the National Party in a<br />
derogatory remark saying that they are de-wogging ceremonies and<br />
then you have in the expression of their Budget cuts, $ 16 million being<br />
cut away for citizenship. In other words, they won't be encouraging<br />
citizenship. At the same time if people are here, they will attack the </p>
<p>cohesion, the social cohesion, and family values of the country by<br />
leaving them to fend for themselves.<br />
J: Okay, well, that is what you are saying. We are coming to the end and<br />
I want to put it to you that you have said that if John Howard were to<br />
win, progress in this country would stop. I mean how can you justify<br />
that?<br />
PM: Because he is always looking backwards. He has no faith, really, in<br />
what we have created here, no belief that Australians can do as good<br />
as anyone else in the world. We are sitting in the highest growth area<br />
of the world, he wants to walk around it. He wants to walk back to the<br />
low growth areas of the world, to Westemrn Europe and to<br />
North America. He just doesn't understand the imperatives of<br />
leadership. He is not thoughtful about the sort of society we ought to<br />
be. He says, for instance, a republic is a diversion where, in fact, it is<br />
completely central to how we see ourselves. That is why I believe a<br />
move to Mr Howard is a step back down the time tunnel.<br />
J: Alright then, Prime Minister, we must leave it there. Many thanks<br />
indeed for coming on to Dateline.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
ends </p>
