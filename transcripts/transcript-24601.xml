    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the last election I committed to spending a week every year in a remote Indigenous community.<br />
Â <br />
This year I have been jointly invited by the Torres Strait Regional Authority, the Torres Shire Council, Torres Strait Island Regional Council and the Northern Peninsula Regional Council to spend a week with their communities.<br />
Â <br />
Itâs very important that our national leaders focus on the whole of our country, including its most remote parts â so for a week in August the centre of government will move to the Torres Strait Islands and Northern Peninsula Area.<br />
Â <br />
During this week, this region and its people will be the focus of my attention. I will be accompanied by a number of ministerial colleagues and senior government officials.<br />
Â <br />
This will be the first visit to this region by an Australian Prime Minister for some time.<br />
Â <br />
The Government has already made progress in getting children to school, adults into work and making communities safer.<br />
Â <br />
There is more work to be done, and this visit is an opportunity to review progress in delivering on these priorities.</p>
