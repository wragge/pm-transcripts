    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Julia Gillard, today released the new National Employment Standards (NES).</p>
<p>The NES are a key element of the Rudd Government's new modern workplace relations system and will come into effect on 1 January 2010.</p>
<p>The NES will ensure that all employees are protected by a strong safety net of fair minimum conditions that can't be stripped away.</p>
<p>The NES will apply to all employees in the Federal system regardless of industry, occupation or income.</p>
<p>The NES were developed following extensive consultation and consideration of submissions to the exposure draft which was released on 14 February 2008.</p>
<p>129 submissions were received from a wide range of stakeholders, including: employee and employer groups; businesses; community organisations and individuals.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's consultative approach is in stark contrast to that of the previous Liberal government.</p>
<p>The NES will be simpler for Australian employers.</p>
<p>The Work Choices standard runs to 149 pages of complexity, provides only five minimum conditions and many of the protections provided are sub-standard. </p>
<p>The NES, in contrast provides10 vital protections in just 50 pages.</p>
<p>The NES provide employers with the flexibility and simplicity they need while also ensuring employees' key entitlements are protected. </p>
<p>The NES are:</p>
<p>     * Maximum weekly hours of work</p>
<p>     * Request for flexible working arrangements</p>
<p>     * Parental leave and related entitlements</p>
<p>     * Annual leave</p>
<p>     * Personal/Carer's leave and compassionate leave</p>
<p>     * Community service leave</p>
<p>     * Long service leave</p>
<p>     * Public holidays</p>
<p>     * Notice of termination and redundancy pay</p>
<p>     * Fair Work Information Statement </p>
<p>The Government will shortly issue a revised Award Modernisation Request to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) attaching the NES to assist in its task of modernising awards.</p>
<p>The NES and award modernisation are integral components of the Government's commitment to deliver a modern workplace relations system to benefit all Australians.</p>
<p>Legislation will be introduced into Parliament later this year to give effect to the Government's commitment. The legislation will include other aspects of workplace relations relating to the NES including compliance, interaction with agreement making and future reviews.</p>
