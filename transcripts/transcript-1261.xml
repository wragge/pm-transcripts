FOR PRESS P. M. No. 18/ 1966<br />
TALKS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Cabinet met this morning with the Prime Minister<br />
of Thailand, Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, and the Foreign<br />
Minister, Mr. Thanet Khoman, and the Minister for National<br />
Development, Mr. Pote Sarasin.<br />
Discussions were frank and cordial. They covered a<br />
wide range of subjects. We are partners in the SEATO Treaty,<br />
each having a vital concern for the stability of South-East Asia<br />
and an intense interest and close identity of view about the<br />
facts and the significance of the situation in South Viet Nam.<br />
We reviewed together the discussions which we had each<br />
had with Mr. Humphrey and Governor Harriman, and also the<br />
discussions which the Australian Government held a little earlier<br />
in Canberra with the British Minister of Defence, Mr. Denis<br />
Healey. We both share a belief in the importance of the<br />
continuance of a British presence on the mainland of Asia as a<br />
stabilizing and moderating influence, helpful to the peace,<br />
security and well-being of the area.<br />
We also shared in a valuable exchange on matters<br />
relating to the social and economic development of the countries<br />
of South-East Asia. Vie agreed that it was important to look<br />
beyond the immediate need to contain aggressive Communism by<br />
military measures and that it is necessary simultaneously to<br />
seek social and economic development of the area. In this<br />
context we both welcomed the initiatives at the Honolulu talks<br />
by the Governments of South Viet Nam and the United States to<br />
build up the social and economic fabric of South Viet Nam.<br />
In Thailand too, Australia has made substantial contributions,<br />
which were fully acknowledged by Field Marshal Thanom, to the<br />
development of Thailand under the SEATO Aid Plan and also under<br />
the Colombo Plan, and will gladly continue to assist Thailand<br />
in her efforts to maintain a sound and rapid rate of development.<br />
Further, we each look forward to a continuation in the development<br />
of trade between our two countries.<br />
Our situation as friendly allies has been fortified<br />
by the discussions which took place.<br />
CANBEIRRA, 24th February, 1966. </p>
