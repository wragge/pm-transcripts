    <content><![CDATA[<p>  Well ladies and gentlemen it's been quite a momentous weekend in Australian sport, Matthew Hayden gets the highest test score in 126 years of Australian test cricket, the Wallabies win last night, and the Batesman's Bay Seahawks win this afternoon.</p>
<p>  I think it is a wonderful example of Australian exuberance, Australian love of sport, Australian mateship and the team spirit of our country that our indigenous national code flourishes here and it's been a great tribute to those who've organised it and tremendous tribute to those who played in these very challenging climactic conditions for any kind of football and I just want to say it's a great delight for Janette and I to be here and I know I speak for Simon and Carole Crean in saying that all of us understand the importance of gatherings like this in the wake of what has happened here and it's a demonstration to the world, it's a demonstration to our own people in Australia and it's a demonstration of friendship to the people of Bali and to the people of Indonesia.</p>
<p>  I just want to say to all the blokes who played good on you, you've really done our country proud.</p>
<p>[ends]  </p>
