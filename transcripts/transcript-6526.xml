    <content><![CDATA[<p>25 OctoberÂ 1984</p>
<p>North Queensland Engineers and Agents will shortlyÂ receive a substantial defence contract.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has agreed to provide IndonesiaÂ with three more attack class patrolÂ boats under theÂ defence co-operation program. Australia has alreadyÂ given Indonesia five similar patrol boatsi which-areÂ used for coastal surveillance, anti.-smugglinq andÂ fisheries protection.</p>
<p>The three additional boats will be refitted atÂ North Queensland Engineers and Agents before beingÂ delivered to Indonesia. The first refit will commenceÂ in a matter of weeks and each refit will cost someÂ $ 400,000. The last of the five boats already providedÂ was refitted at North Queensland Engineers and AgentsÂ in 1983.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has been made very conscious ofÂ the difficulties North Queensland Engineers and AgentsÂ is facing. Our initiative ir. quickly securing this nowÂ defence contract will undoubtedly ease its immediateÂ problems.</p>
