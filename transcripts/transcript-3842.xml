VISIT BY THE PRINCESS MARGARET<br />
Details of the program for the visit in October by<br />
Thie Princess Margaret, to-the Australian C, 4pital Territory,<br />

It will be recalled that on 29 May 1975 I released a<br />
statement issued by Kensington Palace announcing that Princess<br />
Margaret had accepted the Australian Government's invitation<br />
to visit Australia to attend engagements in Sydney connected<br />
with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the formation of the<br />
Women's Royal Australian Army Corps.<br />
Princess Margaret will visit Canberra from 22 October<br />
to 24 October, Melbourne from 24 October to 28 October with<br />
a one-day visit to the Latrobe Valley on 27 October, Sydney<br />
from 28 October with the last official engagement on 31 October.<br />
Princess Margaret has taken a close personal interest<br />
in the preparation of the program.<br />
It reflects some of her special interests and<br />
responsibilities as a Princess of Australia, as Colonel-in-Chief<br />
of the WRAAC, as an officer of a number of organisations, and as<br />
a person in her own right.<br />
As I have said previously, Princess Margaret, among her<br />
many interests in Australia, is President of the Girl Guides<br />
Association, of the Doctor Barnardo's Homes, and of the<br />
Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship. Her Royal Highness<br />
is also Grand President of the St John Ambulance Association and<br />
Brigade. Princess Margaret will be able to pursue her interest<br />
in the arts during her visit to Australia.<br />
The program includes attendance at a concert, and at<br />
a performance by the Australian Ballet, and visits to art<br />
galleries and historic National Trust buildings housing<br />
important artifacts and works of art.<br />
The public will have opportunities to see Her Royal<br />
Highness on a number of occasions at each of the cities to be visited. ./ 2 </p>
