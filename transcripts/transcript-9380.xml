PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGO: MIDNIGHT, FRIDAY 14 OCTOBER, 1994<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RELEASE OF APEC PACIFIC BUSINESS FORUM REPORT: " A BUSINESS<br />
BLUEPRINT FOR APEC: STRATEGIES FOR GROWTH AND COMMON PROSPERITY'<br />
I am very pleased to welcome the report of the APEC Pacific Business Forum, " A business<br />
blueprint for APEC: strategies for growth and common prosperity", which will be presented<br />
to President Soeharto, the 1994 chair of APEC, in Jakarta today ( Saturday).<br />
APEC leaders established the Pacific Business Forum in Seattle last year because we<br />
wanted APEC business people to tell us what they think APEC should do to facilitate<br />
regional trade and investment liberalisation. We thought that bringing together thirty-six of<br />
APEC's top business people would result in some forward-looking and challenging<br />
recommendations. And we were right. The PBF report is an ambitious, wide-ranging and<br />
stimulating one.<br />
I would particularly like to thank Australia's PBF representatives, Philip Brass. ( Managing<br />
Director, Pacific Dunlop) and Imelda Roche ( Managing Director, Nutri-Metics) for the time,<br />
vision and commitment they gave to this task.<br />
Central to the PBF's vision for a dynamic and prosperous Asia-Pacific is the need for rapid<br />
movement toward free trade and investment liberalisation in the APEC region. Perhaps<br />
this is not surprising exports have driven Asia-Pacific growth over the last decade but it<br />
is good to hear business voices speaking out in favour of trade liberalisation in their own<br />
and other APEC economies.<br />
As I have said before, Australia fully supports the idea of setting a serious, but realistic<br />
date for the achievement of free trade in the APEC region. And APEC must achieve free<br />
trade in a way that is consistent with GATIWTO principles and contributes to further<br />
global trade liberalisation.<br />
At our meeting next month in Bogor, APEC leaders will also give careful consideration to<br />
the steps the PBF suggests on investment and the wide range of other issues which the<br />
report covers ( many of which investment principles, standards and customs for example<br />
Tsm--. </p>
<p>2<br />
are already being addressed within APEC). The PBF report will be an invaluable<br />
resource.<br />
More generally, I consider it essential that APEC leaders ( and APEC generally) continue to<br />
draw on the advice of the business community. I will be discussing possible mechanisms<br />
for achieving this including the PBF's suggestion that APEC leaders establish an APEC<br />
Business Advisory Forum with my fellow APEC leaders.<br />
