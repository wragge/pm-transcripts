PM: I didn't think you'd be interested in me today.<br />
JOURNALIST: Oh no. We're always interested in talking to<br />
you Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Thank you. You've got a future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you tell us, were you at all annoyed by Mr<br />
Howard's statements yesterday that you had backed down?<br />
PM: No. I'm like the great majority of the Australian<br />
electorate, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to take<br />
him seriously.<br />
