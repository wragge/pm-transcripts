SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL LANDCARE AUSTRALIA AWARDS<br />
29 MARCH 1994<br />
Thank you all f or coming tonight.<br />
The fact that some of you have come a very long way to be<br />
a part of this event indicates how widely the Landcare<br />
movement has spread in Australia.<br />
This success is, on the one hand, proof of the need for<br />
better land management in Australia; on the other, and<br />
perhaps more importantly, it is proof of the care<br />
Australians feel for their country.<br />
An environmental consciousness is not new in Australia,<br />
but what we have seen in recent years is an awareness of<br />
the need to preserve the environment of Australia allied<br />
to the knowledge that it is an economic, and indeed a<br />
social imperative.<br />
When we move to save a damaged or threatened environment,<br />
like that of the Murray-Darling, for instance, we are<br />
acting to save industries, families and communities.<br />
If we move cleverly we can do more than save: we can<br />
increase productivity, create new industries, restructure<br />
local economies, revive regions, and give a lot of<br />
Australians particularly young Australians new jobs<br />
and opportunities.<br />
In other words, when we recognise the problems of<br />
salination or any other form of land degradation, or the<br />
means by which an improvement to the environment can<br />
translate into increased productivity, we recognise the<br />
fundamental link between the environment and the quality<br />
of our national life including that which underpins it,<br />
our national economy.<br />
That is precisely the new consciousness which Landcare<br />
manifests. Everyone who joins a Landcare group has<br />
recognised the link between self-interest and the<br />
interest of the environment community interest, the<br />
national interest and the interest of the environment. </p>
<p>And I might say that if Landcare and these awards help to<br />
show Australians that they are all linked by their<br />
relationship to this unique continent if they help to<br />
unite us on this basis they will have done Australia a<br />
great service.<br />
I think it also should be said that one of the great<br />
things about Landcare is that individuals and communities<br />
are driving it.<br />
It has not been an easy couple of years on the land, with<br />
falling commodity prices and extended drought in at least<br />
two States.<br />
But, far from discouraging Landcare projects, this<br />
hardship appears to have made the network flourish.<br />
Landcare is one of the great movements of our time<br />
because the energy is coming from people with an<br />
affection for the country coupled to a belief in its<br />
future.<br />
And the future is most certainly there. In the-food<br />
industry, for example. There are strong signals abroad,<br />
identified by the Agri-food Council, that demand is<br />
likely to increase for clean, green food products that<br />
is, food produced by the most environmentally friendly<br />
methods. That means potential for exports and jobs. New hope and<br />
opportunities for people on the land. Potential to<br />
invigorate regional Australia.<br />
The fact that one farming family in three is involved in<br />
Landcare goes a long way towards putting Australia in a<br />
position to realise this potential.<br />
I said in the Government's Environment Statement in<br />
December 1982: " The drive for environmentally friendly<br />
industries and for protection of the environment is. . part<br />
of the economic drive part of the international<br />
competitive drive in which Australia is engaged."<br />
The success of Landcare is testament to the speed with<br />
which that message is spreading through Australia.<br />
The fact is Landcare's achievements are bigger and better<br />
than were ever envisaged. So successful has Landcare<br />
been, demand is outstripping supply.<br />
But that goes for every successful program and it<br />
certainly does not mean what a press report today took it<br />
to mean.<br />
It does not mean there is a funding crisis, or that<br />
Landcare is about to collapse. </p>
<p>The Government is presently spending far more than it<br />
committed for the decade of Landcare.<br />
We are very much aware that our commitment to Landcare<br />
needs to be maintained: that we need to make the<br />
structure and administration of Landcare programs more<br />
effective, but not weighed down with bureaucracy; that we<br />
need to keep the long term funding up and, of course,<br />
that we need to continue to spread the message of the<br />
link between land conservation and improved production.<br />
We need all Australians to understand the basic<br />
principles of Landcare.<br />
We-will get the best out of our country if we<br />
understand it and care for it.<br />
We will get the best out of ourselves if we live in<br />
harmony with the land.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Tonight you will meet the new Federal Minister for the<br />
Environment, John Faulkner.<br />
John Faulkner has proved himself a very capable and<br />
popular minister for Veterans Affairs. Veterans are not<br />
always easy to please.<br />
But with that highly desirable mix of ideas, commitment<br />
and wise and practical judgement John Faulkner has<br />
pleased them.<br />
Environmentalists also are not always easy to please.<br />
Nor are their opponents. And it is not always easy to<br />
bring together.<br />
John, I am quite sure, has the qualities needed to get<br />
the results we need not ones which will please<br />
everybody, but ones which are good for the environment<br />
and good for the country.<br />
It is an irony that, because we have so many programs<br />
already in place and so many achievements already under<br />
our belt, the Government these days is not getting much<br />
credit for environment policy.<br />
In fact a great deal has been done and a great deal<br />
continues to be done.<br />
I know that John, like me, is very conscious of the<br />
contribution made by the people who preceded him.<br />
Graham Richardson's work needs no further commendation<br />
from me. It is enough to say that he made the<br />
environment a primary policy area for this Government. </p>
<p>I don't think it will hurt any of us to recall what Ros<br />
Kelly achieved.<br />
Among other things, she implemented the Endangered<br />
Species Legislation, established the Feral Pest Program,<br />
made major advances in World Heritage listing and<br />
protection of Australia's most special places, such as<br />
Shark Bay, Fraser Island and Stage 3 of Kakadu, and<br />
established Ocean Rescue 2000 the Commonwealth's first<br />
marine conservation program.<br />
She also recognised the natural progression to the socalled<br />
" brown agenda" the hard, dirty issues facing<br />
Australians every day but which Australian governments<br />
had not tackled so seriously before.<br />
While Ros Kelly was Minister, Government policy reflected<br />
this.<br />
We established the Commonwealth Environment Protection<br />
Agency, developed the first National strategy on Waste<br />
Minimisation and Recycling, took head-on the issue of<br />
lead pollution, established national targets for reducing<br />
greenhouse gas emissions and undertook the massive task<br />
of restoring the health of the Murray-Darling.<br />
I hardly need to tell people like yourselves, who are<br />
involved in environmental projects, that we cannot<br />
announce new programs and new projects every day. You<br />
know better than most that starting an environmental<br />
project or program is one thing and seeing it through is<br />
another. We are seeing them through.<br />
So we have, after the contributions of these two<br />
Ministers, measures for a great range of environmental<br />
issues.<br />
We have available an increasing range of assistance to<br />
meet objectives similar to those of Landcare for<br />
example, programs such as LEAP, which is being creatively<br />
used to support a Greening Australia project in the<br />
Northern Rivers district of New South Wales which I<br />
visited recently.<br />
Yet for all the Government's initiative, and all the<br />
Government's financial commitment, for all the<br />
Government's effort on scientific research and education,<br />
we can never eliminate the legacy of environmental<br />
problems without initiative, commitment and effort from<br />
individuals, companies and communities like those<br />
associated with Landcare.<br />
Like most things in the life of a nation, there is much<br />
that Governments can and should do, but so much more that<br />
people can do better.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen </p>
<p>Tonight, f or the third time the achievers of Landcare<br />
Australia are being honoured.<br />
But I would like to say that in honouring these<br />
Australians we are paying tribute to all those involved<br />
in Landcare for, by the fact and the nature of their<br />
involvement, they are all achievers.<br />
Later, I will have the task of congratulating the winners<br />
of this year's awards.<br />
Right now, I should acknowledge the generous<br />
contributions made by Landcare's major sponsor, Telecom,<br />
along with Monsanto, Combined Rural Traders, Ford,<br />
Ansett, BHP, Alcoa and the National Landcare Program<br />
itself. I must also congratulate Bob Collinsi the Minister for<br />
Primary Industries and Energy, on the leadership he has<br />
shown in the National Landcare Program.<br />
And Jim Kirk, whose departure from Landcare I understand<br />
is imminent.<br />
The success of the Landcare network is by definition a<br />
tribute to the person at the helm.<br />
Jim will leave Landcare with the outstanding reputation<br />
for business and community leadership he already enjoys<br />
substantially enhanced.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Our economy is now growing faster than any in the western<br />
industrialised world. The prospects for an era of<br />
prosperity and national growth and development have few<br />
parallels in our history.<br />
The issue at the heart of Landcare is at the heart of<br />
those prospects.<br />
In the environment statement of 15 months ago I said<br />
this: In the next decade the pioneering spirit will be<br />
carried on by Australians who these days work on the<br />
frontiers of technology and seek new ways to grow,<br />
or make or mine things. Economic growth and the<br />
jobs which accompany it will increasingly go hand in<br />
hand with environmental protection and renewal. The<br />
old war with the environment will be replaced by a<br />
partnership in the national interest.<br />
Nowhere is that partnership stronger than in Landcare.<br />
I congratulate and thank you all. </p>
