SPEECH AT CHRISTMAS RECEPTION FOR SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS, CANERRA<br />
It has not been a custom on these occasions to raise issues of<br />
major concern in an explicit or formal way. However, I have<br />
wanted for some time to comment on the view, and I have no<br />
doubt that it is a widespread view, that there has been a slippage<br />
in public service morale because of criticism and pressure on<br />
the service. I have chosen.-this occasion to say something about<br />
the Public Service and its future because I particularly want<br />
the people here to be aware of my concerns, and the concerns<br />
of the Government in relation to it.<br />
I do not need to tell anyone here that public servants seldom<br />
receive many plaudits for the contribution they make to the<br />
smooth running and the progressive development of Australian<br />
society. The contribution made over the years has been an<br />
enormous one and it has not been adequately recognised. On<br />
the contrary, public servants and even politicians are bound<br />
to accept a degreee of public criticism, some of it<br />
unwarranted, as part of the system to which we are committed.<br />
In this connection, there is a question as to how concerned we<br />
should be about the " image" of the Public Service, or 1perhaps<br />
I should say its so-called image in the wider Australian<br />
commun~ ity. I h ave in mind in parts the words of William<br />
Plowden, Director-General of the Royal Institute of Public<br />
Administration, who spoke on this topic in Brisbane some<br />
12 months ago. Plowden said, " the whole relationship between<br />
media comments and reports on any subject, and public views of<br />
the subject, is extremely problematical..." and he went on<br />
to explain his point by saying-" don't believe everying you<br />
read in the newspapers, and don't believe either that everybody<br />
else believes it".<br />
In any case I don't know that many of you would appreciate<br />
too many public plaudits even if you could get them, because<br />
the real challenge of work in the Public Service lies in different<br />
directions. The real challenges are to combine efficiency<br />
with the kind of administration and service which the people<br />
whom we serve are really seeking, and to combine dedicated<br />
service to the government of the day, whatever government that<br />
might be, on the one hand with the level of expertise on<br />
which effective modern government depends, and on the other<br />
hand with the non-political character which is at the<br />
foundation of our public service system. / 2 </p>

I don't believe for one moment that good government would be<br />
enhanced in Australia by importation of the US system, where<br />
governments change ever 4 years and push out one group of<br />
advisers and puts in another.<br />
No-one appreciates the proper nature of the relationship betweE~ n<br />
the Public Service and the Government better than senior<br />
Public Servants, and I believe that the provisions which the Government<br />
introduced some years ago in relation to the appointement<br />
of Permanent Heads also make an important contribution in<br />
terms of enshrining and institutionalising the nature of that<br />
relationship to take it out of political hands for the sake of<br />
politics. I cannot emphasise too much the importance.. to the future of<br />
this nation of an efficient and competent Public Service. It<br />
is crucial that the traditions of dedication and service to the<br />
Government of the day continue, that the motivation and moralE!<br />
of the Service be maintained, and that the quality of the<br />
Government's advisers and of their management skills be<br />
progressively enhanced in , the face of the growing complexity<br />
of* Government administration.<br />
As Prime Mlinister, I have welcomed and appreciated the quality<br />
and frankness of advice that I have received-I not only as Prime<br />
. minister, but in my earlier years as a MInister. It is the<br />
responsibility of senior Public Servants to tell Ministers<br />
both the g~ ood and the bad news. The Government may take a<br />
view different from the advice that it has received from its<br />
Public Service advisers, but that is in the nature of the<br />
democratic process; it certainly does not reflect either on<br />
the advisers themselves, or on the quality of their<br />
advice I have no doubt that it reflects on the quality of the<br />
Ministers and their capacity for judgement.<br />
I said some years ago that: " Politicians and Public Servants<br />
are partners in Government, whatever political parties are in<br />
power. And tl ' ey share another characteristic which I strongly<br />
hold. They are both servants of the people". We have determined,<br />
as a policy, that part of the way Government is organised and<br />
run is to enable staff to do its best, and part of doing it be! st<br />
lies in not only looking after public money but also in givingr<br />
a good service to the client. I am sure that this is a policy<br />
which nobody here would want to argue with, but there are SOME!<br />
other aspects of policy which also call for comment.<br />
it is obviously impossible to consider issues of<br />
concern for the Public Service without taking account of the fact<br />
that in recent years Governments throughout the world have fa! ed<br />
great difficulties, and the need for some new policy directions<br />
arising from significant changes in the international economic<br />
and strategic sitution.<br />
These challenges have been reflected in the nature and volume<br />
of the demands placed upon Public Servants, in~ narticular<br />
demands on First and Second Division officers. I saw / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
representatives of Second Division officers today Sir William<br />
Cole was there and they were useful discussions and designed<br />
to improve communications in a sensible way. The demands<br />
on the Service have seen not only greater complexity and<br />
sophistication in the policy advice and management skills<br />
required, but also a reduction in the level of staffing and<br />
financial resources made available to the Public Service to do<br />
its job. I know that our staff ceiling policies have imposed<br />
pressures and challenges on the Public Service. While I<br />
make no aplogy for the policies which require a leaner<br />
Public Service, I would emphasise that decisions to reduce the<br />
size of the Public Service should not be interpreted to mean<br />
that we are dissatisfied with the standard of competence or<br />
dedication of Public Servants.<br />
Moreover, against a background of increased'interest by the<br />
community in the rights of individuals and in the administration<br />
of policies affecting those rights, we have seen a very considerable<br />
growth in mechanisms for imposing greater accountability on<br />
the Public Service.<br />
In brief, you have been required to carry out more difficult<br />
tasks, often with less staff, and in the face of increasing<br />
public scrutiny. I believe despite . the stresses and strains<br />
that have arisen, the service as a whole has accepted the<br />
challenges placed upon it, and responded in a very creditable<br />
way to these challenges. And I must say that in spite of<br />
a good deal of talk about the Public Service, I am heartened<br />
by the quality of people that we have attracted into the Serv-iLce,<br />
and at the contribution that they are making. I am heartened<br />
also at the endeavours that are being made to upgrade the skills<br />
and development of younger officers through schemes such as<br />
th e Executive Development Scheme and the Interchange Programme,<br />
because schemes such as these have the capacity to widen<br />
the skills of Public Servants and also to increase their<br />
understanding of attitudes and problems in the wider community.<br />
In a smaller, leaner Public Service, management skills,<br />
intelllectual ability and capacity to cope with a new technology<br />
will all be of increasing importance. Nor should the value of<br />
the fundmental, old established traditions and attributes<br />
of the Public Service be forgotten. These are the need for<br />
full frank advice to Government, neutrality, impartiality<br />
and dedication in implementing the decisions of Government<br />
and of the Parliament, together with fairness and ecjruity<br />
in dealing with the claims of individuals.<br />
In all of these things I remain as I have always been confident<br />
of the response of the Public Service. I am on record, in<br />
the Parliament and elsewhere, as appreciative of the professionalism<br />
and competence of our Public Service, and have no hesitation<br />
in endorsing comments by senior private enterprise managers<br />
to the effect and, to quote one of them, " Don't ever let anyone<br />
tell you that the executive level of the Public Service does<br />
not earn its keep". 000---</p>
