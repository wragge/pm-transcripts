    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask you for an update on the condition of the AFP officers?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes, there have been injuries to a number of AFP officers. Two of them are undergoing surgery at the present. The injuries are in the area of broken bones and one possible fractured skull. They are not life-threatening but they are certainly deplorable injuries and all Australians will hope that these officers who are serving the country overseas will make a full recovery. The situation is still quite unsettled. I've had a briefing through my office from the High Commissioner in Honiara and it does appear to be a reaction to the election outcome. Australia has made a very strong, long-term commitment to the future of the Solomon Islands. At this stage there does not appear to be any need for further forces, although if there is they will be sent. I will continue to be kept updated... up to date on what transpires over the hours and days ahead. I hope the situation stabilises because we do want democracy to work effectively in the Solomons and it has to be possible of course in democratic society for a change of government, a change of Prime Minister to take place without a hostile response.  Thankyou.</p>
