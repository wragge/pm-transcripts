    <content><![CDATA[<p align="LEFT">The first meeting of the Prime Minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council was held in Canberra today. </p>
<p>Chaired by Warren Mundine, the 12 Council members bring a broad range of views and experience to the table. </p>
<p>Terms of Reference for the Council were also released with an emphasis on practical advice on policies and programmes that could improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. </p>
<p>While the Council’s remit is broad, I have asked Council members to focus on improving school attendance and educational attainment, creating lasting employment opportunities for Indigenous Australians in the real economy, and empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </p>
<p>The Council will meet three times a year with the Prime Minister and relevant ministers and the Chairman will meet once a month with myself, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator the Hon Nigel Scullion, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon Alan Tudge MP. </p>
<p>I look forward to working with the Council to ensure we focus on positive actions to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </p>
<p>The Council’s Terms of Reference are attached. </p>
