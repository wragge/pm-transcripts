PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE,<br />
19 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
LAWS: And we welcome the Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Bob Hawke good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning John.<br />
LAWS: How are you?<br />
PM: Well thank you.<br />
LAWS: Apart from the fact that you are melting in our<br />
unairconditioned studio but we have got them working<br />
overtime down stairs to fix it.<br />
PM: Good on you.<br />
LAWS: Who's gonna win the cricket?<br />
PM: Australia.<br />
LAWS: Easy?<br />
PM: I don't think you should ever take any side at<br />
Test Match level but on the evidence I think we'll win<br />
reasonably comfortable.<br />
LAWS: Yeah, what about the football. That's going to be<br />
a great match.<br />
PM: Oh wasn't that second test something.<br />
LAWS: Unbelievable.<br />
PM: Those second two tries.<br />
LAWS: Fantastic. I mean that really makes you proud.<br />
Are we going to win the third one.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LAWS: Easily.<br />
PM: I think more comfortably than the second I would<br />
think. </p>
<p>LAWS: Yeah, well I suppose we are more aware now we're<br />
perhaps a little surprised the first time we saw them<br />
because I don't think we thought they were as good as<br />
they are.<br />
PM: I think that's absolutely right. We'd won so<br />
comfortably i~ n the lead-up matches and full marks to the<br />
Englishmen they played good rugby.<br />
LAWS: And they're filling the grounds up too.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
LAWS: I was saying to you before we started, things got<br />
tough at your7 place the other day with Paul Keating and<br />
John Hewson and yourself and a whole lot of them. You<br />
were pretty tough on the Liberals in Parliament when you<br />
accused them of committing Australians to die in Vietnam.<br />
You're sort of leaving yourself a bit open, aren't you?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose there will be criticism but let's<br />
make these points. It did happen. They totally misread<br />
the situation. What I was trying to do, John, was to<br />
make the point not just to go back to that in isolation<br />
but to say what's happening now in their analysis of<br />
foreign affairs is simply the continuation of what they<br />
have been like in the whole of the post-war period. They<br />
regard foreign affairs just as an extension of the<br />
domestic battlefield. They don't look at the issues they<br />
say, how can be take positions that are going to get<br />
division within this country and get political advantage.<br />
Do you remember what they said of the Labor Party at that<br />
time? They -accused me and my party and it's leadership<br />
of being unpatriotic, un-Australian because, why, because<br />
we said the commitment to Vietnam was wrong. We were<br />
vilified. Now all I was trying to do in talking about<br />
their current positions John, where they are equally<br />
wrong, where they misread the situation and this is part<br />
of a long history. It's not only ill-informed but its<br />
dangerous. LAWS: Yes, but of course you are talking about something<br />
that happened more than twenty years ago. You could<br />
hardly be held responsible for anything that happened<br />
more than twenty years ago anymore than John Hewson can.<br />
PM: The point is that what happened then happened<br />
because of the same mistakes in analysis that they are<br />
making now. If there was evidence, John that they had<br />
changed and that they were capable of treating foreign<br />
affairs in the way it should be that is dispassionately,<br />
looking at the evidence and coming to what is the right<br />
conclusion in terms of Australia's interests then, of<br />
course, what you say is right. But'the way they are<br />
treating things now is exactly the same as they did then.<br />
They will make the same mistakes in the 90s as they did </p>
<p>in the 60s because they approach the matter in the same<br />
way. LAWS: If they were in power now would we be in the Gulf?<br />
PM: I believe so. Yes.<br />
LAWS: So really that decision<br />
PM: No, no, no, but that doesn't mean that on every<br />
issue that they see things differently from us or that I<br />
think they are wrong on every issue. I pay the<br />
Opposition an~ d Dr Hewson tribute for the support they<br />
have given us; on that issue. Both in regard to the<br />
decision to commit forces, and may I say particularly, in<br />
regard to thet support echoed most recently on the weekend<br />
of the way we are handling the hostage situation. They<br />
have been tot~ ally supportive. I give credit where credit<br />
is due in pol~ itics. Where I think criticism should be<br />
made I make it.<br />
LAWS: We made mention of John Hewson. I see that Steve<br />
Burrell has written an opinion piece in the Financial<br />
Review this morning which is interesting when he talks<br />
about the public John Hewson, he is a non-politician<br />
above the ruck of adversarial politics, deals in personal<br />
incentive. fie's a man, ideas and issues. When you were<br />
riding high iLn popularity, I rather suspected you too<br />
were seen as a non-politician. Would you agree with<br />
that? PM: Well, in the sense that I wasn't in politics. I<br />
was LAWS: When y~ ou first started.<br />
PM: Oh well, yes I think that's probably true and in<br />
some sense I hope it's still true now. As I just said,<br />
if I see merit on the other side then I always<br />
acknowledge it, John. I think you should in politics.<br />
LAWS: Yes, well he is sort of seen as a non-politician.<br />
PM: Well you are reading from the first part of the<br />
article. What the first part of the article is saying,<br />
this is how the perception that John Hewson is trying to<br />
give of himself. Read the last part of the article where<br />
Burrell says, what are the realities, and of course<br />
LAWS: Well let's just have a look at this because I find<br />
it interesting anyway as far as politicians collectively<br />
are concerned, none in particular. The five interwoven<br />
strands PM: Self-perception.<br />
LAWS: because he owes. Well he is not saying it, I<br />
suppose Steve Burrell is saying it, because he owes </p>
<p>nothing to vested interests inside or outside his party.<br />
People looked at you in that light too when you<br />
PM: I suppose they did to some extent, to some extent,<br />
John. LAWS: I suppose it's all part of being a new boy which<br />
obviously is beneficial.<br />
PM: I don't think there is any doubt about that. Of<br />
course in John Hewson's case, John, one of the things<br />
that's worked to his advantage is that not only the<br />
public but particularly the gallery in Canberra were just<br />
sick and tired of the Howard/ Peacock hurdy gurdy round<br />
and round and round and no change. So whoever came in<br />
was going to get a good run.<br />
LAWS: It was a bit refreshing. It says here that he has<br />
had a good go from the media. Obviously all that must<br />
come to end because he will cease to be a non-politician<br />
because he must become a politician if he's going to be<br />
in politics. Ultimately, I suppose he'll owe something<br />
to somebody. Most people end up doing that and I suppose<br />
the media will also weary.<br />
PM: Well, as Burrell goes on to say in that article,<br />
John, he's revealed himself, as being as he puts it,<br />
amongst most sensitive of politicians to criticism. And<br />
he is not beyond abusive letters and phone calls to<br />
journalists where what they have put as criticism of<br />
positions he takes as personal attacks. Burrell makes<br />
the point there that this extreme sensitivity and<br />
reaction in which he rings up and abuses journalists is<br />
something which is going to bring the honeymoon to an<br />
end. LAWS: Yes. Do you think he's deserved the honeymoon<br />
0he's had?<br />
PM: In some senses yes. In some senses, but in others<br />
no. In the beginning, the very fact that this was a<br />
break from the, as I say, the Howard/ Peacock hurdy gurdy<br />
worked in his favour. I think he, at the beginning,<br />
seemed to be prepared to take positions which were not<br />
necessarily those of the people around him. But,<br />
increasingly as time has gone on, and particularly under<br />
the spotlight of Parliament, he's become progressively<br />
weaker and taken silly positions. I mean, for instance,<br />
what he did in the last week when he allowed himself to<br />
be rolled in his party room in what his own colleagues<br />
said was an incredibly weak display. That has, I think,<br />
changed the whole setting now. He is not going to have<br />
the respect of, even of his own people, in the way he did<br />
before. LAWS: Prime Minister I am going to have to get somebody<br />
to play a commercial while I have a cough. </p>
<p>PM: You've got trouble mate.<br />
LAWS: You're going to have trouble answering the<br />
questions if I am coughing over the top of them. So<br />
we'll have a commercial, I'll have a cough.<br />
LAWS: Sorry about that. Bad cough.<br />
PM: Bad luck.<br />
LAWS: I've had a big one now. Should be better for a<br />
while anyway. Apparently Iraq was highly offended by<br />
that stupid, or silly anyway, naval video. It's been<br />
suggested tha~ t if Australia apologised for that it might<br />
help our hostages. Would you concede that that's<br />
possible and if so would you be prepared to apologise?<br />
PM: The navy, which is a place where it should be done.<br />
The navy has. That has been, was a full and unqualified<br />
apology. LAWS: Do YOU think it should have been given?<br />
PM: Well that was a judgement that the navy made. The<br />
fact is they intended no offence. It was thoughtless in<br />
retrospect. They understand that. But our fellows there<br />
are not there to be offensive, and they don't intend to<br />
be offensive to the people of that area or, most<br />
particularly, also to the people in Australia from that<br />
region. I merely say I will take this opportunity of<br />
saying, that I identify myself with the naval chiefs who<br />
have expressed their regret and I identify with that.<br />
LAWS: Ann Fairbairn seems to think that it's important<br />
that you apo: logise.<br />
PM: Well the conduct of Australia's foreign affairs is<br />
not going to come out of the mind of Ms Fairbairn.<br />
0 LAWS: So, in other words you aren't particularly<br />
impressed by what she says and you don't think an apology<br />
is necessary.<br />
PM: I've sa. id all that I think is appropriate on that.<br />
That is that no offence was intended, that the navy has<br />
expressed their regret, I identify with that expression<br />
of regret.<br />
LAWS: If youa thought it would help the hostages, would<br />
you then apologise. I mean, even if you sort of half<br />
didn't mean it.<br />
PM: I don't think that in pursuing the interests of this<br />
country you can allow a particular incident, and some<br />
people's reaction to it, to determine the strategy that<br />
must be followed. I repeat in this matter what I just<br />
said a moment ago, John, I do give credit to the<br />
Opposition and Dr Hewson on this issue, that they have </p>
<p>been entirely at one with us on this. You see what<br />
you've got to remember in regard to the hostages is this,<br />
that while all of us, including myself, deeply regret<br />
what has happened and is happening to them and may I<br />
say parenthetically that I had a most touching letter<br />
from representatives of them there in Kuwait expressing<br />
support for our approach you've got to remember that<br />
what Saddam Hussein has done, is to take masses of these<br />
people as hostages, and he's playing with them. He's<br />
playing with them in an attempt to influence the world as<br />
to how they should deal with his totally unjustified<br />
annexation of Kuwait. If the governments at an official<br />
level, John, responded to that game that he is playing,<br />
then that would be precisely what he'd want. It would<br />
help to fragment the unity of purpose that exists and<br />
divert attention from what is the real issue and that is,<br />
that i~ f annexation of Kuwait is totally unacceptable and<br />
his seizure of hostages is unacceptable. I mean, he is<br />
attempting to use them to his advantage, and we must<br />
remember that: and conduct ourselves in that way. As I<br />
have said in the Parliament, and I repeat to your<br />
listeners, not a day has gone past since August, John,<br />
when our offiLcial representatives in the area, our<br />
diplomatic representatives, haven't been working to<br />
secure the release and to protect the welfare of our<br />
hostages and will continue to do that. If individuals go<br />
there and seek to help them, well they go there<br />
unofficially if they have success well then we welcome<br />
that for those that are assisted but we remember the<br />
hundreds of people, not too many Australians, the<br />
hundreds of people who're still there and maintain<br />
illegally and improperly and inhumanely.<br />
LAWS: And you believe by us paying court to Saddam<br />
Hussein we are in fact dignifying what he has done?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
LAWS: What do you feel about the private envoys who have<br />
gone with some success?<br />
PM: I respect their integrity and their good intentions.<br />
I certainly am not going to get into any slanging match<br />
with them at all about what they are doing. But I simply<br />
make the points that I have made to you which I repeat,<br />
John, is the common position of all the nations involved<br />
in forcing the United Nations sanctions. There is no<br />
official involvement by any of the countries in these<br />
processes. LAWS: Do you think that the private envoys are lending<br />
credence to what Saddam Hussein is doing by making these<br />
personal approaches and obviously being successful<br />
because they are personal approaches?<br />
PM: Well, they obviously welcome it. Saddam Hussein and<br />
those around him welcome it. It is quite clear from what<br />
they are saying that they like to be courted by a range </p>
<p>of people which go from people like ex-Japanese Prime<br />
Ministers are going there and are being seen smiling and<br />
shaking hands with him.<br />
LAWS: It seems to ex-everybody though doesn't it?<br />
PM: Yes, that's what I am saying. There is no nation<br />
involved in the active endorsement of sanctions by<br />
contribution of the multinational forces there. Not one<br />
of those nations are officially being involved in this<br />
process, and for the very good reasons that I have put to<br />
you. LAWS: OK, well now Saddam Hussein has promised to start<br />
freeing the hostages from the Gulf on Christmas Day. He<br />
says that's going to be a gesture of goodwill. He'll do<br />
it over a thr-ee month period. Do you believe him?<br />
PM: What goodwill. I mean if there is goodwill he'd<br />
release them all, now. I mean it is obviously part of a<br />
process of trying to get some acceptance of his<br />
unacceptable behaviour.<br />
LAWS: Do you believe him?<br />
PM: Well, I guess if you are going to get into the<br />
stakes of believing Saddam Hussein you might ask the<br />
Kuwaitis whether they believe the promises he gave that<br />
he wasn't going to invade them.<br />
LAWS: So you don't believe him.<br />
PM: No, I don't necessarily believe him.<br />
LAWS: He did warn that the freeing of his so-called<br />
guests might not go ahead if international forces in the<br />
Gulf continued to threaten war. So again, it's do it,<br />
but do it my way. Isn't it?<br />
PM: Yes, and in the end, let's wipe aside all the crap.<br />
What are we witnessing? We are witnessing the use of<br />
innocent human beings to justify internationally<br />
unacceptable; behaviour. What's that behaviour, it is the<br />
invasion and. annexation of one country by another.<br />
LAWS: Which is unacceptable.<br />
PM: Unacceptable and in that unacceptable behaviour he<br />
is attemptin~ g to get some degree of acceptability by<br />
playing with the lives of hostages. And that's not on.<br />
LAWS: And do you think the people who have been going to<br />
bargain for the lives of the hostages have helped to give<br />
him that acceptability?<br />
PM: Well, they've added to his stature and when<br />
expressions of gratitude are given for the fact that he<br />
has released some people. That sticks in the craw a bit. </p>
<p>I mean, I am not trying to say I don't have share the<br />
sense of happiness for the families of those and the<br />
individuals who are released. Of course you understand<br />
that but the fact is that there are those that are being<br />
left behind and the whole process is being used by Saddam<br />
Hussein to give some degree of acceptability to behaviour<br />
which is intrinsically objectionable and unacceptable.<br />
LAWS: OK. O~ n domestic matters, we are in recession. Do<br />
you sort of say we are in recession? I know you don't<br />
like the word.<br />
PM: No, look John, lets get that right. I don't want to<br />
interrupt you but, all I've ever said, I mean, I don't<br />
mind if you or anyone else uses the word recession. I've<br />
got no worries about that at all. All I have ever said<br />
is what is the professional truth that with economists<br />
they define a recession, always have, as two successive<br />
quarters of negative economic growth, and all I have said<br />
is that we are not in that position. But if people wish<br />
to use that phrase, I mean I don't lose one moments sleep<br />
about it. I understand that people are being hurt.<br />
LAWS: You have said that we are nowhere near as badly<br />
of f as in the 1983 recession.<br />
PM: Most importantly, not only have I said that, but<br />
last week Westpac in its release said exactly the same<br />
thing. LAWS: I think Westpac might have been seeking a bit of<br />
self-defence. Mightn't they?<br />
PM: No. nothing to do with their own position.<br />
LAWS: Yes. Well I doubt that you<br />
PM: No the statistics are quite clear.<br />
LAWS: I mean you wouldn't find too many people that for<br />
example in the rural sector who reckon they're better off<br />
now then they were in 1983.<br />
PM: No, John, I'm talking about the Australian economy<br />
as a whole. I mean, sections of the rural economy are in<br />
absolute crisis. There is no doubt about that. But that<br />
is not a function, basically, of the internal economy.<br />
It is a function of the fact I mean, you don't get what<br />
is over a 50 per cent decline in farm income which is in<br />
prospect this coming year over the last one as a result<br />
of internal matters. It is just a total collapse of<br />
world prices; in wool and wheat. But of course sections<br />
there are very, very badly off. But as far as the<br />
economy as a whole is concerned comparing now with<br />
1982-83 then you had five successive quarters of<br />
employment decline, you haven't had anything like that.<br />
You had a wages explosion then, which you haven't got<br />
now, you've got wages contained, so things are tough. </p>
<p>People are hurting. We've had to slow down the economy.<br />
You've had me tell you. You've had Paul tell you. You<br />
know what the; story is.<br />
LAWS: Sure.<br />
PM: But we wrill come out of this in a way that will mean<br />
we won't have the absolute devastation of the economy<br />
right across, as occurred in 82-83. That's accepted by<br />
the breadth of economic commentators. Most recently<br />
Westpac. LAWS: John Dawkins says that you are locked in a policy<br />
straightjacket and you should be more flexible to help<br />
exporters. Hlow do you answer that sort of criticism<br />
within your own ranks?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. John Dawkins is not<br />
basically questioning the thrust of the policy that we've<br />
pursued. He seems more recently to be embracing the idea<br />
of, perhaps to0 a greater degree of interventionism to<br />
stimulate certain areas of economic activity. But I am<br />
not going, I mean, John can have that discussion with<br />
Paul and myself in the Cabinet. I think the important<br />
thing we have got to understand the basic problem of the<br />
Australian economy is we ' ye got to be producing more.<br />
And it is not only for exports, John, it's for import<br />
replacements because, again as Paul and I have spoken<br />
with you, the basic problem confronting the Australian<br />
economy in the last year was we had an 8 per cent<br />
increase in expenditure and a 4 per cent increase in<br />
production. And that's the simple statistic. You don't<br />
need to be a professional economist to understand that<br />
that was unsustainable, and so we had to bring the level<br />
of activity -down so that we weren't sucking in such a<br />
high level of imports.<br />
LAWS: OK. WJell how do we get productivity up when, I<br />
mean, we get a report that was issued by your Government<br />
confirming an alarming number of rorts in the building<br />
industry, we only got part of the report. More than<br />
per cent of time is lost through so-called bad weather.<br />
In one city, obviously this one, something like 40 per<br />
cent, but in the United Kingdom and the United States it<br />
is only 2.1 per cent compared to 40 per cent. I mean how<br />
do you about that?<br />
PM: There is a lot of room for improvement in the<br />
building industry. Let me take the economic picture as a<br />
whole. I think you've been good enough, in discussions<br />
with me in the past, to acknowledge the enormous<br />
restraint that has been exercised by the Australian<br />
workforce generally in wages and also the great<br />
improvements; that are taking place in work practices<br />
generally. I accept that in the building industry, there<br />
is still a lot of room for improvement and my Minister<br />
for Industrial Relations at this stage, right, right at<br />
this time, is engaged in serious negotiations with the </p>
<p>building industry to try and do more to bring about<br />
improvements there. There is room for improvement in the<br />
building industry. I accept that.<br />
LAWS: Massive improvement.<br />
PM: A significant improvement yes.<br />
LAWS: Well how do we get that?<br />
PM: We get that as we've got it, for instance, massive<br />
improvement in productivity in a whole range of<br />
industries. That's occurred because we have got<br />
employers LAWS: Like what? What industries have we had increases<br />
in productivity?<br />
PM: Well let me just give you an example. Last week I<br />
had the Economic Planning Advisory Council, in the<br />
Cabinet Room, and the head of ICI, Michael Deeley, was<br />
there, this is the head of ICI, and just going through in<br />
detail the massive improvements in productivity that are<br />
taking place in ICI, an important sector of industry.<br />
Through the processes of restructuring that have taken<br />
place in that industry, that is workers and the unions<br />
are sitting down with management and totally<br />
restructuring the way they go about things. Massive<br />
improvement there. Just recently I've had the same<br />
presentation with BHP, where there is massive<br />
improvements in productivity which have been reflected<br />
in the fact that now they are exporting an enormous<br />
amount of steel which transformed that steel industry<br />
from one which was going to close down to one which is<br />
now going through a great expansion phase and<br />
contributing very substantially to exports. But the<br />
common factor there, John, is that you have sensible<br />
management and responsive trade unions sitting down and<br />
Ssaying, well the way we have done it in the past isn't<br />
good enough. Now we need that in the building industry.<br />
LAWS: How do you get along in the smaller industries? I<br />
mean, you're talking about very big industries but how do<br />
you get along when fellows ploughing their crops back<br />
into the ground and the same crop that's being ploughed<br />
into the ground here is being imported into the country?<br />
How can you allow that<br />
PM: Well you would have noticed that over the last two<br />
or three days John Kerin has been meeting with those<br />
industries to see whether, in fact, in the context of the<br />
Uruguay Round, that we're in, whether anything can be<br />
done about that. But you see, you understand what the<br />
basic problem is there. What we've been engaged in and<br />
for the last: few years is a massive fight in the Uruguay<br />
Round which is going on the multilateral negotiations to<br />
free up trade internationally in agricultural products.<br />
We are fighting the Europeans and the Americans, although </p>
<p>11.<br />
the Americans have taken a more sensible attitude.<br />
Between them, the Europeans and the Americans are<br />
spending about $ 200 billion a year in domestic subsidies,<br />
export subsidies and denying market access. That's<br />
stopping our Australian rural producers of getting fair<br />
prices and fair access. Now it's very difficult<br />
LAWS: Yes but we could sell them here<br />
PM: No but wait a minute. No, no, no. You can't sell<br />
your wheat you can't sell your wheat and wool.<br />
LAWS: No. IL'm talking about the commodities that are<br />
being ploughed back into the ground, that we could sell<br />
them here, and we're importing stuff.<br />
PM: Yes, but what I'm saying, and this is my argument.<br />
Don't you understand it? We can't be going there into<br />
the Uruguay Round and saying to Europe, get rid of your<br />
barriers to our products, have free trade. You can't be<br />
leading that fight internationally, for free trade and<br />
agricultural products, and at the same time be putting up<br />
barriers here. How would Australia's voice be heard<br />
attacking the Europeans?<br />
LAWS: Well I don't know. You put up barriers with the<br />
motor car market<br />
PM: Yes but we're bringing them down.<br />
LAWS: Yes but, I mean, you propped them up for years<br />
PM: No, our predecessors did. They propped them up for<br />
years. LAWS: How long have you been there?<br />
PM: We have<br />
LAWS: You left them up.<br />
PM: We did not. We've reduced manufacturing protection<br />
by 30 per cent since we've been in.<br />
LAWS: Yes but it's still there.<br />
PM: Yes but: it's coming down. I mean<br />
LAWS: But you give these other people no protection.<br />
Why don't you give them some protection?<br />
PM: No, thetre is some protection in the rural industry.<br />
There's a small amount. But you can't let me say this,<br />
the Nationa. Farmers' Federation, representing rural<br />
producers in this country, accept the argument that I'm<br />
putting. They are saying to us, you can't be going<br />
overseas in international councils and arguing on behalf<br />
of Australia's rural producers for reduction and removal </p>
<p>of barriers and subsidies in the rest of the world and be<br />
practising it: in our industry here. Their<br />
representatives accept the validity of that argument.<br />
LAWS: OK. EBut what's the answer for the people here. I<br />
mean, we import tomatoes from Italy in a tin and we sell<br />
them for 20 per cent cheaper than we can sell the<br />
tomatoes that we grow in this country in tin. Now how<br />
come you allow that to happen?<br />
PM: Well I'm simply saying, to you, that if the effected<br />
sectors of the Australian rural industry want us to have<br />
a two-faced position on this and say, well we'll erect<br />
barriers here against the import of European agricultural<br />
products and think at the same time that we can be<br />
protecting our large agricultural producers by going into<br />
those international forums and saying to the Europeans,<br />
you've got to get rid of your barriers. Well I think<br />
they'll understand it's a pretty impossible position to<br />
Obe in. Unfortunately what we've now got to be<br />
recognising, John, is that this Uruguay Round is coming<br />
to its closing stages now. This is why I rang President<br />
Bush the other night and had a long yarn to him about it.<br />
The Europeans seem intent on sabotaging the Round and of<br />
course if they do that, if they're not prepared to<br />
negotiate realistically, and I'm asking George Bush to<br />
consider, if necessary, that we'll have a Heads of<br />
Government meeting to deal with this. But if they are<br />
going to sabotage the Round then we're in a new ball<br />
park. We're going to have to look at change of attitude<br />
in a whole range of issues.<br />
LAWS: Yes. Well it's not just in the area, excuse me,<br />
of agriculture. It's in all sorts of areas. I was<br />
talking to somebody the other day about an asthma<br />
nebuliser. There's a German product available here that<br />
sells for $ 150, we make one here that sells at $ 220 or<br />
which isn't as good. Now how do these things come<br />
Oabout? I mean, we can't compete, can we?<br />
PM: Well it's interesting that you should pick that area<br />
because in some aspects of the invention and manufacture<br />
of medical products we're leading the world. For<br />
instance, we now have products in the field of hearing<br />
assistance, of pace-makers, where in fact, Australian<br />
products, Australian manufactured products have more than<br />
half the US market. So you can't speak generally about<br />
this. In fact, the areas of medical instruments and<br />
appliance production in which Australia is recognised as<br />
leading and leading competitively in the world. So, I<br />
mean, you just can't make I'd prefer, John, I wish<br />
people wouldn't just talk about, you know, picking out a<br />
black and say, look at that. I wish people would<br />
spend a bit more time talking about the enormous<br />
achievements where in the most competitive areas of<br />
production Australians have shown themselves capable of<br />
taking on and beating the rest of the world. I mean,<br />
we've got a there's an enterprise in Adelaide that I </p>
<p>13.<br />
visited a couple of years ago and in the highly<br />
competitive area of lens, glasses, that copn's<br />
competing in America and has got the major share of any<br />
producer, competitor in that market and against the<br />
toughest in the world. I mean, we can do it.<br />
LAWS: Well I think it's very important we talk about<br />
those things but I also think it's very important we talk<br />
about the areas in which we don't win because there are a<br />
lot of people suffering.<br />
PM: Yes so do I. The big thing is that, you know,<br />
unions and businesses, in all areas of the Australian<br />
economy, should understand that with the right approach<br />
Australian enterprises have shown that they can and are<br />
taking on, are now and have been over the last few years,<br />
taking on and beating the best in the world. We'll<br />
never, we'll never lead the world in, and be able to<br />
compete against the rest of the world in great mass<br />
produced things like motor cars and so on. Although, let<br />
me say, in brackets here, it's fascinating to see that<br />
we're not only now exporting some cars to the United<br />
States but we're about to export station wagons to Japan.<br />
So we can get: niche markets like this. What I want to<br />
see is workers and bosses understand. I'd love them all<br />
to go into these factories, enterprises, and see where<br />
Australian enterprise is exporting in the toughest<br />
markets in the world and winning. We can do it. We are<br />
doing it.<br />
LAWS: OK. A couple of reports that we had last week<br />
that caused some concern to people that listen to this<br />
radio program and from all sorts of places. One from<br />
Esperance in Western Australia, concerned about the<br />
story, right or wrong, that one of Paul Keating's<br />
advisers had received a salary increase of more than $ 600<br />
a week. Is that sort of story right?<br />
PM: I don't know what happened in Paul's office. But I<br />
saw there was some totally misinformed newspaper article<br />
which started off some of these things, it was in one of<br />
the Melbourne papers. What they did, John, was to<br />
confuse ceiliLngs for salaries that had been set with what<br />
in fact was happening. I mean, there was some story that<br />
in my own office people were getting particular salaries<br />
where they were referring, actually, to ceilings that had<br />
been set. What actually happened is that we in the<br />
public service generally were faced, as you know, and<br />
we've talked about this before, about the fact the<br />
private sector was creaming off a hell of a lot of people<br />
that were, you know, good people that we wanted to keep.<br />
So we had to create a situation in which there was a<br />
capacity for paying, particular people of merit, salaries<br />
which were going to be able to keep them in there. That<br />
was done but the actual ceilings were not necessarily<br />
those that were paid. In the case in my own office, for<br />
instance, my principal what he was called, Principal<br />
Private Secretary, they're called Principal Adviser now. </p>
<p>The head of the office, in fact, is getting something<br />
like 10,000 below the ceiling that was set that he could<br />
have had and which, in fact, he's out of the public<br />
service proper. He's been paid in my office less than<br />
what he'd be getting if he was in his substantive<br />
category in the public service. So there is no<br />
extravagance in this. It was an attempt to make sure<br />
that we could. get the services of people who otherwise<br />
were going to be attracted out into the private sector.<br />
It's in the interests of your listeners, and of<br />
Australians generally, that government has available to<br />
it talent.<br />
LAWS: The bE! st. Yes I understand that and I accept that<br />
but you've got to understand that those people out there<br />
hear of somebody getting a $ 600 a week salary increase.<br />
Another fellow, apparently, in Peter Cook's office, his<br />
Private Secrettary, I think got a 35 per cent increase.<br />
Now, it might be necessary to give it to him but when<br />
everybody PM: There's a process about it. I mean, it's not just a<br />
question of Peter Cook or I mean and I can't, I won't<br />
accept, I'm riot saying that's not right, I simply don't<br />
know, so I neither accept nor reject the figures you're<br />
putting but let me remind you of the process. It wasn't<br />
a question of Peter Cook or Paul Keating or Bob Hawke<br />
being able to say I'm going to pay this. What we did was<br />
to establish a process whereby if Ministers wanted to get<br />
some increases for members of staff then it had to be<br />
settled by a process independent of the Ministers. it<br />
went there and it had to be finally confirmed through a<br />
process independent in which there was recommendations,<br />
to the Secretary of the Department of Industrial<br />
Relations, wh.-o looked at the merits and made decisions on<br />
the merits. You will find, as I say, cases where people<br />
were not in : fact awarded the salary at the ceiling which<br />
was applicable to that position.<br />
LAWS: Yes. I understand what you are saying about<br />
having to pay them. We probably should pay you more,<br />
probably should pay everybody in Parliament more, but<br />
when the rest are given guidelines and they're in trouble<br />
if they go outside the guidelines like the pilots were in<br />
trouble because they went drastically outside the<br />
guidelines PM: No but you see in regard to this these processes<br />
that we set up were established in full consultation with<br />
the ACTU. They were consistent with the guidelines of<br />
the Commission.<br />
LAWS: How can 35 per cent be a guideline for one and six<br />
per cent a guideline for the other?<br />
PM: Because there are considerations of merit in regard<br />
to particular individuals and that is the case in regard<br />
to the Commission itself. You can get increases in the </p>
<p>Industrial Relations Commission beyond just the six per<br />
cent nationa. wage increase if there is a case taken on<br />
the particular merits of the case. Now you raise the<br />
pilots. There was no question of that, there was no<br />
question of that. They just said, we're not even going<br />
into the Industrial Relations Commission we're having<br />
per cent, bang, and we'll take it out of your hide.<br />
LAWS: And of course the business executives do the same<br />
thing. PM: Well, John, you know, again you and I have talked<br />
about that. It's been terribly disappointing over this<br />
recent two or7 three years when we, as you know and you've<br />
generously conceded, workers generally have exercised<br />
enormous restraint<br />
LAWS: Been fantastic.<br />
PM: Been fantastic. It's been very, very harmful, I<br />
think, that business executives, generally speaking,<br />
haven't exercised the same restraint. I think it's been<br />
very disturbing. It's certainly made it harder for the<br />
leadership of the ACTU to keep their own troops<br />
exercising the same degree of restraint. But I make the<br />
point in regard to the areas that you're talking about in<br />
the public service, that all that was worked out in total<br />
consultation with the ACTU.<br />
LAWS: It just seems to me extraordinary that some are<br />
asked to accept a guideline of six per cent and yet<br />
others can get 35. Even though they might deserve it.<br />
PM: No, but there is, within the general framework, out<br />
there, where you've got national aggregate outcomes of<br />
six and seven per cent, which is what we're looking at.<br />
Even within those guidelines there are opportunities for<br />
people in industry to take particular cases which can<br />
lead to quite significant increases, up to 20 per cent<br />
and so on, but they are not increases which can just be<br />
given on the basis of saying, we have got industrial<br />
power we're going to impose it upon you. They have to<br />
establish that the increases that they are looking for<br />
are consistent within the guidelines.<br />
LAWS: Of all the Prime ministers I've known, I've known<br />
a lot, you are by far the most people orientated. You<br />
like people. You like to get close to people. You seem<br />
not to mind having people around you. You've had a very<br />
special relationship with them for a long time. Does it<br />
hurt a lot that they've, according to the polls, and I<br />
suppose we must accept them, turned away? Does that<br />
hurt? PM: No it's not hurt. Obviously I'd be telling you the<br />
biggest blowie of all time if I said, I don't worry about<br />
this and it doesn't worry me that I'm where I am and that<br />
I wouldn't like to be higher. Of course every </p>
<p>16.<br />
politician, including Bob Hawke, would like to have as<br />
high as possible opinion ratings but I make this point, I<br />
will not buy popularity by pursuing policies which I know<br />
would be against the long-term interests of Australia.<br />
We had to bring in tough policies over this last 12<br />
months or so to lower the level of activity. I knew,<br />
Paul knew wit~ h me, that when we did those things that<br />
there would be hurt. When you do those things people<br />
don't give you ticks. They give you crosses. But if I'd<br />
done the cheap thing and said, I'm not going to take the<br />
tough decisions I might have sustained higher popularity<br />
ratings for the time being but I would have been selling<br />
those people short. My commitment to this country and my<br />
love of this country is such that I am not going to make<br />
decisions for7 short-term popularity reasons. They will<br />
be made on the basis of what I believe is necessary for<br />
the country. If that hurts me a bit in the process so be<br />
it, John.<br />
LAWS: How can it be that a fellow like Nick Greiner,<br />
whom I think you have some regard for or it appeared that<br />
you did at the last Premiers get-together, he's made some<br />
pretty tough decisions and this is not the best place in<br />
the world to live in at the moment, Sydney or the State<br />
of NSW when it comes to expense, it's pretty costly.<br />
Well he's made a lot of tough decisions and yet he's<br />
retained popularity.<br />
PM: Yes but you see if you look at where he was he was<br />
down the blazers and now he's come back. Now partly that<br />
is because people have started to look at some of the<br />
decisions and they don't have the same immediate<br />
emotional reaction to them as they did before. Of<br />
course, I've got to say and as Nick would concede<br />
himself Nick has got a lot of residual benefit from<br />
what's happened in Victoria. I mean he concedes that<br />
himself. LAWS: Have you been very badly hurt by what's happened<br />
in Victoria?<br />
PM: Oh yes, I think so. It's fairly bad. I mean a lot<br />
of people suffered badly because of the things that<br />
happened within Victoria. Clearly that rebounded against<br />
Labor in that State and it's had some flow-on to us. Now<br />
I'm not saying that in politics it doesn't flow both<br />
ways. I'm saying my political colleagues in some of the<br />
States will have been adversely affected by people's<br />
perception that we're imposing some tough decisions. But<br />
in politics it flows, you know, both ways. If you go<br />
back to the federal election when Nick was down in this<br />
State we were helped to some extent by that. At that<br />
time in March Nick Greiner and his Government were down.<br />
We got some residual pluses out of that. Now in Victoria<br />
we were hurt: in the federal election badly. I mean if<br />
you look at the figures, you take Victoria out, to the<br />
rest of Australia we, federally, increased our majority. </p>
<p>17.<br />
LAWS: And yet included in Victoria, which I suppose at<br />
least they would consider important but<br />
PM: Of course, exactly. We got hurt there.<br />
LAWS: I mean you got more than hurt there. You got less<br />
votes than Gough Whitlam got when he got done over by<br />
Fraser, in fact.<br />
PM: In Victoria? I don't know whether that's right. I<br />
mean, I haven't looked at that. But we got hurt. Now<br />
that's the way of it. Now all I'm saying is that we're<br />
two and a half years basically, that sort of order of<br />
time, from the next federal election. I just warn the<br />
scribes, the forecasters, the doom-sayers against making<br />
judgements in respect of 1993 in 1990. It's a sure way<br />
of going broke.<br />
LAWS: In all the time that you've been Prime Minister<br />
you've been up and down, you've been higher than any<br />
other Prime Minister now you're extraordinarily low, but<br />
at no period did the Australian public ever say that they<br />
wanted somebody else. For the first time they're now<br />
saying that they want somebody else.<br />
PM: John Hewson marginally in front as the preferred<br />
Prime Minister, well you know, nearly eight years to get<br />
there. Well, ok, but I just say these things; I will<br />
continue on with my colleagues making the decisions that<br />
are correct. The Australian economy will recover in<br />
1991. The benefits of the decisions that we're making in<br />
the area of micro-economic reform will increasingly show<br />
up. We will deliver to the Australian community the most<br />
competitive telecommunications industry I believe in the<br />
world they are going to get very considerable benefits<br />
from that. The reforms that we're making in the area of<br />
rail and road we'll continue to bring very considerable<br />
benefits for them. These aren't sexy things. As you're<br />
sitting down there in Canberra with your head down and<br />
your arse up in the air making the decisions. But as<br />
those things bite and the impact comes through we'll be<br />
getting the benefit of that. And on the other side as<br />
you went to earlier in your program, John, in regard to<br />
the Opposition, they've had a dream run since the<br />
election. Dr Hewson gets up and he spits out an idea, no<br />
details on a consumption tax. He says, oh we'll have<br />
consumption tax. No details about it<br />
LAWS: You would've thought that would hurt him though<br />
but it appeared not to.<br />
PM: It hasn't hurt too much yet because he hasn't spelt<br />
out the details. You wait until the details start being<br />
spelt out, when he spells out the details about that.<br />
The flat rate tax and the abolition of the capital gains<br />
tax. They are now in the period and in the area of<br />
health policy as they go through into 1991 this<br />
surrealistic: world that they've been living in until now </p>
<p>18.<br />
changes and they get into the tough real hard world of<br />
saying now, my fellow citizens, this is what is meant<br />
when we are going to give effect to this lovely sounding<br />
phrase, cutting $ 3 billion of public expenditure, it<br />
sounds beaut. When they come to the first hurdle, what<br />
is there. He goes flat on his face on an eminently<br />
reasonable proposition and that was $ 30 million and the<br />
issue of $ 57 million in a full year. He couldn't jump<br />
that hurdle, but he's got to jump a whole series of<br />
hurdles which add up to $ 3 billion. Now as they get into<br />
that side of translating airy fairy lovely sounding<br />
phrases into the tough realities of day to day politics<br />
LAWS: Why is the public accepting it?<br />
PM: Because at this stage the realities for them are the<br />
hurt of activity being slowed down under the Hawke<br />
Government, they don't like it terribly much and I<br />
understand it. I'm sorry about it but it had to be done.<br />
Against that they've just got a new leader who looks nice<br />
and pristine and is uttering nice friendly noises. But<br />
you go into 91, John, and you've got to spell it out<br />
what does $ 3 billion mean, cutting $ 3 billion<br />
expenditure? After this Government of mine has done more<br />
cutting that has ever been done before, produced four<br />
successive surpluses, got outlays, Commonwealth outlays<br />
down to the lowest level since the 70s and getting back<br />
to the level of the 50s as a proportion of gross domestic<br />
product, and this bloke's going to magically find $ 3<br />
billion. Where is he going to find it? In cutting in<br />
education, cutting in roads, cutting in services to kids<br />
and the elderly? Now once he starts translating and<br />
making the decisions. I mean, how's a bloke going to do<br />
that when he falls at the first hurdle?<br />
LAWS: Why don't you debate him?<br />
PM: Well you see, I see he's made the point that I<br />
haven't debated him in the Parliament. As you know these<br />
proposals that come up are called Matters of Public<br />
Importance. Now there's never been any record, there's<br />
never been any real history, of Prime Ministers getting<br />
themselves involved in these debates that come after<br />
Question Time. The Gallery, the Press Gallery just walks<br />
out after Question Time, they don't stay for these<br />
things. And he's saying because I don't stay for them<br />
that I refuse to debate him. He will have his<br />
opportunities at the appropriate times of coming up<br />
against me and when it does I'll do him.<br />
LAWS: You have no concern, no compunction about debating<br />
him? PM: No, no, none at all. None whatsoever.<br />
LAWS: OK. One final question. Just back to the<br />
telephone system, communications that you were talking<br />
about. Will there be timed telephone calls? </p>
<p>19.<br />
PM: No we have made that clear. Under the<br />
LAWS: There won't be any timed telephone calls in the<br />
metropolitan area?<br />
PM: What we have said is this; that in regard to<br />
Telecom, in regard to Telecom, we will be laying down the<br />
requirement on them that the untimed local calls<br />
continue. That will be the requirement. Now the<br />
realities are that no group setting up in competition to<br />
them where Telecom is going to be having untimed calls<br />
that they'll be bringing in timed calls. I mean it<br />
follows. So the reality will be, as far as consumers are<br />
concerned, that they are going to be faced with<br />
significant reductions in their overall calls because<br />
we've made it: clear that in regard to STD we expect at<br />
least 40 per cent reduction in STD calls.<br />
LAWS: Are you going to shrink the size of metropolitan<br />
areas? PM: In telephone terms?<br />
LAWS: Yes.<br />
PM: I haven't had any indication that that's the case.<br />
I haven't specifically talked about that with Beazley but<br />
I haven't had any indication that that's the case.<br />
LAWS: Yes, because a lot of people show concern in that<br />
area. That if they don't pay for local calls what will<br />
continue to be local? I mean, you can shrink the size of<br />
local PM: I mean you could, you could, I mean,<br />
theoretically reduce it to the size of a CBD. But<br />
there's no proposition along those lines.<br />
LAWS: OK. Thank you very much for your time. I'm sorry<br />
about the airconditioning and the cough. It was a rough<br />
morning. PM: As always, John, it was a pleasure to be with you.<br />
LAWS: Look forward to seeing you again soon.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
