FOR MEDIA 23 APRIL 1979<br />
EXPORT CONTROLS<br />
The Government has decided that it wil. l propose to the States<br />
that a consulative mechanism be established between the<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments on export controls. This was<br />
decided in Cabinet discussions in Melbourne last week and confirmed<br />
by Cabinet in Perth today.<br />
Both the Commonwealth and State Governments have significant<br />
interests in minerals. Hence it is important that Commonwealth<br />
and State powers in this area be used in concert to maximise the<br />
benefits from new initiatives and existing activity in major<br />
resource developments.<br />
There are differences of view between the Commonwealth and some<br />
States about the extent to which the Commonwealth's powers<br />
should be used. Th.' e discussions with State Governments, which I<br />
hope can be held soon, should do much to resolve any outstanding<br />
differences. There is no challenge either to the Commonwealth's constitutional<br />
authority in export controls or that they should be exercised in<br />
certain circumstances for there can be important national<br />
interests at stake. From time to tire the Commonwealth's export<br />
controls have been used to advantage at the request of State<br />
Governments.<br />
ContinuingCommonwealth/ State consultative arrangements, such<br />
as proposed, require a sound basis of factual information and<br />
knowledge of proposed developments if they are to work successfully.<br />
The Government will also be talking to the States about the<br />
extent of involvement of individual industry groups and companies.<br />
There needs to be a total national-approach to any us . e of the<br />
export powers.<br />
The Government is not looking to-control all mineral exports.<br />
Action has already been initiated to remove many mineral items<br />
from export control.<br />
The discussions with the States will explore all aspects of the<br />
matter, fully and without prejudice, in the interests of ensuring<br />
a genuine cosnideration of the bases of existing policies. Major<br />
iron ore negotiations have recently been concluded and the exercise </p>
<p>2<br />
of the guidelines is not now an immediate matter for the<br />
iron ore industry. For other minerals, namely bauxite, alumina<br />
and coal, the present guidelines will be maintained until<br />
the discussions are concluded. The future exercise of the<br />
Commonwealth's powers will depend on the outcome of these<br />
discussions. </p>
