PRESS<br />
ACTING PRIME RELEASE No.<br />
MINISTER TERRORIST BOMBING IN JERUSALEM<br />
I have today sent a message to the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing<br />
condolences for the lives lost in the terrible terrorist bombing that took place yesterday in Jerusalem.<br />
The bombing was an appalling attack on innocent people going about their daily business. All<br />
Australians condemn terrorism and those who support it.<br />
The Government hopes that those who are working hard to construct a settlement in the Middle East<br />
will not be deterred from their efforts. For ultimately a just and enduring settlement is the best way<br />
of ensuring that people will be able to live in peace and security.<br />
