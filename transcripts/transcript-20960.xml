    <content><![CDATA[<p>  Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson, Simon Crean the Leader of the Opposition, Neil Andrew the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Calvert the President of the Senate, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration of the first anniversary of the attack in Bali on the 12th of October last year, the Government felt it would be appropriate, as well as the observances that were held in Bali last weekend, to have a simple but we hope very meaningful memorial here in the national capital.  And we have decided on a small memorial plaque which simply records the names of the 91 Australian citizens and residents who died on the 12th of October 2002.</p>
<p>  We';ve chosen a part of the parliamentary precinct immediately adjacent to the House of Representatives, which symbolises in our own particular Australian way the centre of our national political life, and through this location and placement we hope as a nation in a symbolic way to honour those who died in these tragic circumstances.  But it is also by its very character a quiet secluded spot and it will provide an opportunity in the years ahead for people who visit this national capital, who may have lost loved ones, to quietly sit and reflect and remember in whatever way they choose or for other citizens of our country or indeed visitors from overseas, to read the names and to think of the terrible impact of this event on Australian life.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I';m glad that so many family members and survivors were able to come to this simple ceremony this morning as a prelude to the memorial service in the Great Hall.  This will be an everlasting memorial in the centre of the national capital to those 91 Australian residents and citizens who died.  We will always remember them.  Australians who visit this capital will have an opportunity of particularly remembering them.</p>
<p>  What I intend to do now with my wife Janette is to lay a wreath on the memorial.  Then wreaths will be laid by Simon Crean and Mrs Crean, by the Speaker and the President.  And then after that I would invite all of you at your leisure, consistent with the fact that we have got to be inside in the not too distant future, to have a look at it and to contemplate in whatever way you choose.  But I hope this will be in the years ahead of some comfort to those who lost so much and a reminder that they will never be forgotten and will always have a place at the centre of the heart of the nation.  Thank you.</p>
