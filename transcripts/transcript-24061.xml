    <content><![CDATA[<p>Given the continuing unrest in Ukraine, extensions will be granted to eligible Ukrainian nationals in Australia on temporary visas.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has made the decision to extend the arrangements which were put in place in March.</p>
<p>Ukrainian nationals who are currently in Australia on a visitor visa due to expire and who may be affected by the unrest in the Ukraine will be able to approach the Department of Immigration to make an application for an extension of their visa for a further six months.</p>
<p>The Immigration Department has received a number of requests for an extension of stay by Ukraine nationals and each application is being assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>To maintain the integrity of the visitor visa programme, at this stage the extension is limited to six months, but this will be reviewed in the future.</p>
<p>Ukrainian nationals on temporary visas who wish to remain in Australia due to unrest in their home region should contact the Immigration Department to discuss eligibility for an extension.</p>
