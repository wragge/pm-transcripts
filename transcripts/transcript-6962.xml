TRANSCRIPT OF PM ON THE MIDDAY SHOW TUESDAY 24 JUNE 1986<br />
MARTIN: Welcome Mr Hawke. Thank you for your time. How are you<br />
feeling? PM: I have felt better, but we're on the way up.<br />
MARTIN: Alright. Apart from questions here we're going to throw<br />
it open to everyone. when we announced two weeks back that you<br />
were coming on and you agreed to come on to talk, we had a<br />
predictable number of letters from people in the bush and other<br />
states who couldn't make it. We'll try and run through at some<br />
stage the common themes that run through the questions they'd<br />
like to ask. Let me ask something that is current, a telegram<br />
that arrived yesterday afternoon, just to kick it off, then I'll<br />
through it to you. This is from Peter Alexander in Clarence Town<br />
Dear Ray, You will have Bob Hawke on your next program. Will<br />
you ask him what he will do if it were his children rather than<br />
the Chamber's and Barlow's in Malaysia.<br />
PM: If I were the parents of those two lads I would do<br />
everything I possibly could to save their lives. I would do that<br />
because of my love as a parent. In my case I would also do it<br />
because I don't believe in capital punishment. My heart goes out<br />
to the parents of those two boys.<br />
MARTIN: Do you think everything has been done by your Government<br />
and the state governments?<br />
PM: Everything has been done that could possibly be done by our<br />
Government. I want to make it clear that we haven't sought to<br />
say whether they are guilty or not of the offences. That is for<br />
the courts and the courts have gone through their processes. But<br />
we have said that we don't believe in capital punishment. It's<br />
not a question of asking for a different treatment for<br />
Australians as against Malaysians. We just don't believe in<br />
capital punishment. Bill Hayden has done everything as Foreign<br />
minister, with my full support, to try and see that the death<br />
sentence should not be carried out.<br />
MARTIN: What about Brian Burke's proposal then that they be<br />
brought back to Australian gaols, western Australia or somewhere<br />
else? What do you think of that?<br />
PM: Well that is something that is to be considered by the<br />
authorities in Malaysia. We can't make the decisions. All we </p>
<p>can say to the authorities is we have a deep conviction that to<br />
take another persons life in retribution is not morally correct.<br />
You know my feeling about drug offences, so I don't have to go to<br />
that. But I don't think taking the life of another person is<br />
proper. Life imprisonment perhaps.<br />
MARTIN: Do you feel strongly enough about it, as Prime Minister,<br />
to put a personal request into the Prime Minister of Malaysia?<br />
PM: well the request has gone from us as a government.<br />
MARTIN: But how about from the PM?<br />
PM: Well it goes with my authority. The Foreign minister who<br />
has the immediate responsibility of relations with other<br />
countries has acted as the Prime Minister of Malaysia knows with<br />
my full support. The Prime Minister of Malaysia knows my<br />
position and I would still hope that in some way their lives<br />
could be saved. More than that I can't say.<br />
MARTIN: Would you be in favour of having them in Australian<br />
prisons, as Brian Burke has suggested, for the 20 year sentence?<br />
PM: Well if the attitude of the Malaysian Government were to be<br />
that they would save their lives if the Australian Government, or<br />
the State Government in Western Australia as Mr Burke has made<br />
the offer, would accept the cost of the responsibility of a very<br />
long period of imprisonment then we would support that. I<br />
repeat, you've got to be very careful of relations between<br />
government. We would not approve of another government seeking<br />
to interfere with our processes. I think Australians, whatever<br />
division of view there may be on this issue, I think the<br />
overwhelming majority of Australians would say that as far as<br />
Australia is concerned if another government sought to interfere<br />
with our processes we would say mind your business. And that<br />
is fair enough. Therefore, we must be very careful that we don't<br />
appear to be intervening, interrupting the processes of another<br />
sovereign nation. But if in their view the position would be<br />
assisted if an Australian government said we will undertake to<br />
keep these people in prison for a very, very long period of time<br />
in return for you not carrying out the sentence of death if<br />
that was their view, that they could accept that then that would<br />
make sense.<br />
MARTIN: Alright, questions.<br />
QUESTION: Andrew Ryan, Chatswood CYSS. Is it true Mr Hawke that<br />
social welfare payments are going to be lowered in their real<br />
value when the next cost of living increase is debated. Would<br />
such-dts-counting affect the under 18' s-dole, which is already<br />
dreadfully low at $ 60 per week?<br />
PM: No decisions have been made in this matter Andrew. All I<br />
can say is in the preparation of the Budget the whole range of<br />
Government expenditures, let me remind you when we talk about<br />
Government expenditures that's the decisions by governments as to<br />
what they do with your money, it's not Paul Keating's or Bob<br />
Hawke's money it is the people of Australia's money and we've got </p>
<p>to make decisions about how that is expended. we are facing a<br />
situation where we have to reduce the level of government<br />
outlays. we have in what have previously been difficult periods<br />
tried to ensure that those dependent upon social welfare payments<br />
bear the least burden. That will be the same attitude that we<br />
bring into our consideration on this occasion.<br />
QUESTION: Do you personally agree that the under 18' s dole is<br />
too low at $ 60 per week?<br />
PM: well, if you had an ideal situation where you could pay more<br />
of course it is too low. What everyone in this community has got<br />
to understand Andrew, is that the people of Australia, don't<br />
let's talk about Government, the people of Australia have not got<br />
an unlimited vault of money there that we can just dip into and<br />
say here's more for you, here's more for you, here's more for<br />
you. If we had that we'd be in paradise, but we haven't got it.<br />
We've got a responsibility to the unemployed. We've got a<br />
responsibility to the employed. We've got a responsibility to<br />
the aged. If I and Keating just had that unlimited vault there<br />
into which we could dip then no problems. But what we've got is<br />
your money, your taxes. That is what we've got to use.<br />
QUESTION: As a small business owner don't you think the capital<br />
gains tax is unfair? We put our house on the line to finance a<br />
small business. we don't get the 17.5 per cent loading. We<br />
don't get the four weeks holiday pay. We don't get two weeks<br />
sick leave. Yet if we sell our business and we work hard to make<br />
it a profitable business and sell it we now have to pay a capital<br />
gains tax. I really don't think that is fair.<br />
PM: I can understand your view but I must say we do believe it<br />
is fair. Most countries in the world have a capital gains tax<br />
because it is believed that people would do get an accretion to<br />
their income in that way, in their financial capacity in that<br />
way, should make some contribution. I'd remind you that the way<br />
it has been brought in is not on nominal gains, it's on real<br />
gains. We have not sought to make it a punitive tax. The<br />
ordinary mass of Australian people who get their income through<br />
wages and salaries, and which is their only source of income,<br />
they have to make a full contribution, whichever government is<br />
in, they have to make a full contribution to the taxes of the<br />
community so that the community can do the things with the share<br />
of income of wage and salary earners. So the bridges can be<br />
built, the schools can be built, the teachers paid and so on. we<br />
want to get away from complicated economic theory. That's all<br />
this is about, when we talk about tax and services. we, as 16<br />
million people, make the decision that there are certain things<br />
for the collective good and the individual good, that the<br />
individuals can'-t-do-f-or themselves. The community has to<br />
provide those services. As a community we pay a portion of our<br />
capacity, of our economic capacity, over to the Government so<br />
that the Government will do these things. Now the great mass of<br />
ordinary people pay that share automatically out of the pay<br />
as-you-earn principle.* others can get a great increase in<br />
economic capacity out of capital appreciation. Virtually every<br />
country in the world says they should make a contribution. That<br />
is what we believe. </p>
<p>QUESTION: But you still pay tax when you own your business.<br />
You're still paying your tax every year. You still do those<br />
things. I don't believe that I should get out of paying tax, but<br />
if I'm prepared to work hard and put long hours in and I can sell<br />
my business at a profit in a couple of years time, that's the tax<br />
I'm against.<br />
PM: Well you should be able to get an advantage out of that and<br />
you do. A capital gains tax will only be upon not the nominal<br />
increase, it will be on the real increase in the value. And you<br />
certainly don't pay it all, you only pay a proportion of it. I<br />
know how you feel about it, but I can assure you if you look at<br />
the sorts of things we've done in Government we've tried to<br />
increase the profitability of business. That in fact has<br />
happened. The profitability of business is back now to the<br />
highest level since the end of the 1960s because business,<br />
including small business, provides 75 per cent of the jobs in<br />
this country. That is why we've tried to increase the<br />
profitability of business. In that way we've had this increase<br />
of over half a million new jobs. So we're not trying to do it to<br />
squash you, on the contrary. There are a lot of people who have<br />
avoided their responsibility to the community through not having<br />
to pay something on capital gains and we think that they ought to<br />
be picked up.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke with the apparent removal of the profit<br />
motive, what incentive are you offering young people of Australia<br />
to build a future for themselves and hence Australia?<br />
PM: What I got to say, not only have we not removed the profit<br />
motive but we've done the opposite and the facts are there. The<br />
share of profits in the Gross National Product are now not only<br />
just higher than when we came to Government. It got down at the<br />
end of the previous Government to 11.2 per cent of the Gross<br />
National Product. We've pushed them right back, not just beyond<br />
that, but to the highest level they've been since the end of the<br />
1960s and that's not accidental. Every Australian, and I think<br />
particularly my friends in the trade union movement who worry a<br />
bit about this at times, have got to remember that 75 per cent,<br />
that is three out of four jobs in Australia are provided by the<br />
private sector. The private sector is not going to be able to<br />
provide jobs for Australians, and particularly young Australians,<br />
unless it is profitable.<br />
QUESTION: And also if it is taxed out of existence.<br />
PM: If they've been taxed out of existence the profit share<br />
would not have gone up to the historically high levels that it<br />
has gone up to-under this Government.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, you talk about profit share. In agriculture<br />
we're 40 per cent of the exports, now there is 5 per cent, you<br />
said we've got to work harder bringing in those exports. Now<br />
we're living below the poverty line.<br />
PM: Many of you are, that's right. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Right. Now your Government must do---something to keep<br />
us on our farms. Now the rural debt plan as we put to you at<br />
Canowindra is our solution. I was wondering how far you are down<br />
the road in implementing a rural debt plan?<br />
PM: I gave no promise to implement your plan. What I've done,<br />
as I promised you I would, when I got back to Canberra I put to<br />
the relevant departments the considerations that you put to me.<br />
I've had them being looked at. I'll be writing back to you this<br />
week. If I hadn't been off crook for this last week I probably<br />
would have been able to get the letter off earlier. I've had a<br />
look, I've had my people particularly have a look, at some of the<br />
issues of your concern. I was very worried, for instance, about<br />
one point that you made that suggested you could understood why<br />
interest rates had risen. You didn't like it, but you said<br />
whatever level of interest rates you didn't like what appeared to<br />
be discrimination by the banks against farmers. That was one of<br />
the things that you were talking about. Now I've had that looked<br />
at. I'll be replying to you, as I say, in this coming week. If<br />
I could just go to the general point about farmers. Again this<br />
is something that all Australians should understand. one of the<br />
things I tried to say in my Address to the Nation is that there<br />
is a tendency for metropolitan Australians, people who live in<br />
the cities, to say oh well farmers, they've made a decision to<br />
be out there, they've got to take the bad with the good. well<br />
that's not enough because as our friend said nearly 40 per cent<br />
of all of our exports are rural exports. If farmers are getting<br />
a hell of a lot less for what they export, as they are, then that<br />
goes to bring about a reduction in the economic capacity of<br />
Australia as a whole. So we've all got a vested interest in<br />
trying to do as much as we can to keep farmers going, to keep<br />
them producing. But importantly also to try and make sure that<br />
internationally they get a better return for their products.<br />
Australian farmers are amongst the best, the most efficient in<br />
the world. we've got to try and do as much as we can as a<br />
community. So I really do appeal to all Australians not to think<br />
of the farmers out there as being a separate group, having a<br />
problem by themselves. Their problems are our problems.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, I'm a farmers wife and I hold grave fears<br />
for the future of my family, our farm and our rural community.<br />
Are you aware that a wide range of new farm industries could<br />
generate an extra $ 3 billion for Australia in the near future?<br />
This exciting development is being seriously hindered by high<br />
costs. How do you intend to reduce those costs?<br />
PM: Can I just go to two points here? I'm glad to know that you<br />
emphasise the positive in the first part of your question. There<br />
is the possibility of diversification into a number of products.<br />
I think the New Zealanders have-probably shown a bit more<br />
imagination in this area than perhaps other countries, including<br />
our own, although many of our farmers are doing it. So I think<br />
we should give every assistance that we can there and we are. on<br />
the second part of your question about costs, a number of things.<br />
Firstly, we had to have higher interest rates last year to stop<br />
the high level of activity which was sucking in so many imports.<br />
That level of interest rates is coming down now. If you look at<br />
June 1986 the prime interest now is 3 percentage points lower </p>
<p>than it was at-the end of 1985. In the professional money<br />
markets about 5 percentage points, so it is down to what it was a<br />
year ago. So we're trying to create the economic environment now<br />
which that tendency will move further. That's why we're trying<br />
to have a tough Budget, bring the deficit down, reduce the public<br />
sector borrowing requirement so that interest rates will come<br />
down further. That's one thing. The second thing is that in the<br />
area of wages I've made it clear in my Address to the Nation that<br />
there has got to be further reductions of expectations in the<br />
wages area and that will be the Government's position. I notice<br />
that some one said that what the Prime Minister had put in his<br />
Address to the Nation was an ambit claim. Let me disabuse the<br />
Australian people of any such suggestion. what I put in my<br />
Address to the Nation in regard to has to happen in regard to<br />
wages was no ambit claim.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister we've taken a reduction in our<br />
earnings of 60 per cent in the last three years.<br />
PM: In the same way in earlier periods when world prices went<br />
like that, you had an increase and we welcomed that. You got<br />
that enormous increase in incomes in earlier periods because of<br />
one thing and that is because world prices rose and it was proper<br />
that you should get the rewards for that dramatic increase in<br />
world prices that took place. I agreed with you that what's<br />
happened, now in the most recent period, is that world prices<br />
have gone like that. That's the basic reason why you're incomes<br />
have fallen. We've got to, as a government, try and do all that<br />
we can to stop the criminal stupidity of the Europeans and now<br />
the Americans subsidising their producers so that we've got<br />
corrupted international market and you people are suffering.<br />
We've got to deal with that. At the same time we've got to do<br />
what we can about costs in Australia and we're trying to do that. </p>
<p>MARTIN: Welcome back, please keep your--questions short. Let me<br />
Just dip into the pool here, PM. A theme that ran through lots<br />
of the letter we had one bloke travelling through the United<br />
States recently, in South Carolina, he was telling Americans<br />
there about our 17 1/ 2 per cent loading and our 6-7 weeks of<br />
public and annual holidays, something that Brian Burke has<br />
brought up again today. And that was the theme through lots of<br />
letters. People saying we are prepared to tighten our belts, to<br />
do what you asked in the speech two weeks back, . but overseas<br />
people think the 17 1/ 2 per cent loading and all the holidays we<br />
get is a bit too much.<br />
PM: I can understand that. If you want to make a full<br />
international comparison, of course, you can look at certain<br />
provisions that other countries have which are not matched here.<br />
point to things here that they don't get reflected over<br />
there. But you can point to certain features of the social<br />
welfare system in Europe, for instance, that are not in existence<br />
hre. And I would just make this point which I think is relevant.<br />
Given the cost structure that we have got here in Australia,<br />
enterprising companies have nevertheless shown that they have a<br />
capacity to get up and compete with the rest of the world. Just<br />
before I came here this morning, I went and opened the Sound and<br />
Television International Conference at the Showgrounds people<br />
from all over the world. And we had Australian technology there<br />
on display. And I saw one thing there that was demonstrated to<br />
me and in which we are leading the world. we are selling it the<br />
Japanese in this area of hi-tech. Now I am simply making the<br />
point that I think that while there may be a case that some of<br />
these things which were given a more prosperous time, are perhaps<br />
not so appropriate now. I think that too many Australian firms<br />
use an excuse and say we can't do it, we have got too many<br />
imposts. There are other firms that with the same impediments,<br />
if you want to call it that way, same cost structure, getting up<br />
there, they are going out and they are beating the world.<br />
MARTIN: But what about the 17 1/ 2 per cent and all those other<br />
things? PM: They don't have different award conditions.<br />
MARTIN: It doesn't make you think twice though, the fact Brian<br />
Burke has jumped on the wagon today. The fact that he is<br />
suggesting..<br />
PM: I don't accuse Brian of jumping on wagons. I think Brian is<br />
a very, very good Premier and a very imaginative and a very<br />
dinkum bloke. I don't think that we as Australians should take<br />
anything that exists as sacrosanct. We will commit a great crime<br />
for future generations-of th-i-s country if we simply say well.<br />
everything we have got is perfect, we shouldn't look at it,<br />
because it is there it is sacrosanct. We have got a fundamental<br />
responsibility, not just to ourselves now, but most importantly<br />
to the kids, to the next generation. And if that means looking </p>
<p>at anything -and-saying well should this be done differently now<br />
we ought to do it. I don't regard anything as beyond the realm<br />
of investigation and say well is there a better way of doing<br />
this. Having said that, I don't think that enterprises in this<br />
country should simply say our cost structure is too much we can't<br />
do it because the evidence is there we can do it. We may do it<br />
better if we change certain things.<br />
MARTIN: Are you looking at the moment at even dropping the 17<br />
1/ 2 per cent, dropping some of those other perks that people<br />
refer to?<br />
PM: It is not for government to drop it. This is an award of<br />
the Commission, it is either an award where it has been awarded<br />
or an agreement between employers and unions which have been<br />
included in awards. Now, it is not a matter of law in other<br />
words. It is a matter for the Arbitration Commission. If the<br />
employers want to raise this matter, there is nothing to stop<br />
them raising it. I don't want it to be inferred from that what<br />
our position is. But I do say that any matter, whether it is<br />
levels of wages or conditions of employment, ought to be capable<br />
of being looked at.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, Brian Dean from Caringbah. I am a union<br />
delegate and I have been a member of the Labor Party for quite a<br />
number of years and I have always voted Labor both State and<br />
Federal for as long as I can remember. This year I did not renew<br />
my membership in the Labor Party. My reason for doing this is<br />
that I believe the present day Labor Party has lost its identity.<br />
Prior to your initial election victory the Labor Party, in a<br />
successful attempt to win the middle ground, moved considerably<br />
to the right. And since then we find that any Member of<br />
Parliament who opposes you or Mr Keating, in particular, are<br />
branded the loony left or the lunatic fringe of the Labor Party.<br />
With this substantial move to the right it is difficult these<br />
days to see the difference between Labor and Liberal, which<br />
disappoints me. In an attempt to assist me with this problem, my<br />
question to you Mr Hawke is what are the differences between<br />
the Liberal and Labor Party?<br />
PM: Just before going directly to that answer, let me make the<br />
point about branding people as lunatics or loony left. It is not<br />
really part of my caper. If people adopt a position which I<br />
think is wrong, misguided or unintelligent my caper is to say so.<br />
I hope that I have built up a reputation over the years of saying<br />
what I think, including if that means saying to some people<br />
within my own Party that I think you are wrong. I think it is<br />
much better that I say that, in the end you are going to be<br />
respected, I think, if you say look you are wrong. I think some<br />
of-t-h-e-things that the Left have said have been wrong. I think<br />
that they are just trying to believe that in 1986 you can talk in<br />
economic terms as though we were still back in the halcyon days<br />
of the 1950s and ' 60s. Now, the world might have stood still for<br />
them but it hasn't stood still for anyone else. There has never </p>
<p>been a time in the history of this universe-where change has been<br />
so rapid. And the great crime that we will commit as a Labor<br />
Party, as a government, as a people is if we simply say the<br />
world hasn't changed and we can have exactly the same thinking in<br />
1986 as we had a generation ago. That is the greatest crime that<br />
we can commit. And I will criticise people, wherever they are,<br />
if they make that fundamental mistake. You ask me what is the<br />
difference. I think the difference is this. That when the<br />
Liberals were in, and remember this if you go back to 1949,<br />
that is 37 years, in the history of this country, for all but 31<br />
of those years now the Liberals have been in power. And if<br />
people have a feeling that there is something wrong with the<br />
basic structures and attitudes in this country, they have got to<br />
remember that the conservatives have basically had control of<br />
this country for that period. The difference between us and the<br />
Liberals, and I am not here to attack all Liberals because I<br />
don't think all Liberals are crook or wrong or silly or stupid<br />
they are not but I think the philosophy is inappropriate to our<br />
times. They basically are people of the past. They think that<br />
what has been done in the past is appropriate for the present and<br />
the future. And I think the thing that differentiates us is<br />
that we think you have got to change and that is what attracted<br />
some of the criticism of the Left. I think that because the<br />
Liberals said we had had four banks in Australia, four Australian<br />
banks, and you shouldn't have competition by bringing in foreign<br />
banks. I think that the Liberals were wrong and I think the Left<br />
of the Labor Party was wrong. They shared a stupidity because<br />
they thought that the past was appropriate for the present and<br />
the future. I don't think that<br />
QUESTION: My main concern Mr Hawke, the Labor Party's philosophy<br />
briefly is that the Labor Party would like to see business make a<br />
reasonable profit, they also like to see the quality of life for<br />
all Australians to be improved with special emphasis upon the<br />
poor and the underprivileged. We have seen one side of that<br />
scale successfully carried out where profit rates are at a<br />
year all time high, as you mentioned earlier. But on the other<br />
hand, recent surveys are showing that more and more Australians<br />
are living below the poverty line. Now, something surely has to<br />
be done to assist these people.<br />
PM: Let me very quickly make these two points. Firstly, in<br />
terms of the proportion of total government outlays in the social<br />
welfare area, they have increased under this government from<br />
40.9 per cent when we came to office to 42.3 per cent in the<br />
' 85-' 86 budget. So there has been an increase in the proportion<br />
of our outlays in this area. That is the first point. And there<br />
has been an increase in payments beyond indexation of the best<br />
part of two billion dollars. So it is a myth that this<br />
Government has just been concerned-with economic efficiency and<br />
that we have neglected the areas of need, we haven't. But the<br />
second and in a sense the most important point is this we have<br />
got to get out of our minds as Australians that there is some<br />
sort of magical dispensation that exists there, going back to </p>
<p>what I said at the beginning. We have got a cargo cult<br />
mentality. That the gods descend out of the skies and say here<br />
is a lump of money, whether it be for the unemployed or for<br />
manufacturers who want another incentive or for farmers who want<br />
something. All of the requests, legitimate in themselves, but<br />
Keating and Hawke, this Government or a Liberal government. We<br />
can't create real money. The only real capacity that will last<br />
and help this community to help those most in need is an economy<br />
which is growing in real terms. And that is what my philosophy<br />
and the philosophy of this Government is about is to try and<br />
maximise real economic growth so that out of the creation of real<br />
wealth, we as a community will be able to do more for those-most<br />
in need.<br />
MARTIN: Let's shift the subject a little. would you like to ask<br />
a question?<br />
QUESTION: My name is Kay and I am unemployed. And I was just<br />
wondering, doing this volunteer work, while we are doing it how<br />
are we going to be able to look for work?<br />
PM: Part of the idea is that it wouldn't be for five days a<br />
week. It would be silly to do that because then you wouldn't<br />
have any opportunity. I wonder Ray if I could just quickly say<br />
something to Kay in terms of reaction to the idea. At the<br />
Premiers' Conference, all the Premiers and you can imagine the<br />
political differences there are between Sir Joh on one hand and<br />
John Bannon on the other. They all agreed that they wanted to<br />
cooperate with this. The organisation which represents all the<br />
local government organisations ( about 837 of them around<br />
Australia) have written to me and said they support. The Youth<br />
Affairs Council of Australia said they want to cooperate, the<br />
Australian Council of Social Service. So we are going to get all<br />
these groups together and try and get a bank of community work<br />
but the idea will be that it won't be for five days perhaps a<br />
couple of days, three days so that the unemployed will get a<br />
lift out of the feeling that they are doing something, not just<br />
getting the hand-out but there is a real positive connection<br />
between the community and the unemployed. And I think that in<br />
that way it will probably increase their stature. And then in<br />
that remaining period of the week I think they will probably feel<br />
better, probably more motivated to go out and look for work, but<br />
very much part of it. But there will still be time still to look<br />
for full time employment.<br />
MARTIN: Can we ask on that same subject some of the unemployed<br />
people here? Have you got a question for the Prime Minister?<br />
QUESTION: I heard the Address and I agree with that voluntary<br />
work is a good-idea. But we do a commercial youth radio show on<br />
a commercial Sydney station and when we tried to get a CEP<br />
program they gave us all the reasons why we couldn't get one. </p>
<p>PM: The CEP program is different from--the-sort of thing that I<br />
am talking about because there a lot of that actually involves a<br />
fairly large input of money with capital, it has involved with<br />
many of the projects the building of halls and so on which<br />
otherwise wouldn't be built. We are not talking about that sort<br />
of thing here. It is really talking about work within the<br />
community that just simply otherwise be done, which would give<br />
the unemployed young people a feeling, as I was putting it before<br />
to Kay, that at the moment the only nexus, connection between the<br />
community, between society and the unemployed is there's the<br />
dole cheque. There is no other nexus. What the unemployed have<br />
been saying to me is that they feel that they want to do<br />
something. And so talking to the organisations that I have been<br />
talking about, including voluntary organisations Rotary and so<br />
on there must be an enormous bank of things out there to be<br />
done which wouldn't normally be done in the private workforce or<br />
the public workforce which would give satisfaction to the<br />
community, give satisfaction to the unemployed. It is different<br />
from the CEP programs where we are actually putting large amounts<br />
of money in to build capital projects. It is a quite different<br />
sort of thing.<br />
QUESTION: But wouldn't we be better off doing training and<br />
saying what we want to do rather than doings things that we<br />
wouldn't want to do?<br />
PM: Of course. The idea of the community work program does not<br />
involve any cutting down in the increased funds that we are<br />
making available for traineeships. We are looking to try and<br />
create 75,000 of those before the end of this decade, increased<br />
money for apprenticeships and so on. All those training programs<br />
are there but you are still going have, at the end, a fairly<br />
large number of people who are not going to be able to be<br />
involved in those. So you are trying to get to those people, do<br />
something for them.<br />
MARTIN: The questions we kept getting through here, PM, through<br />
these letters along with this fellow's question was why not make<br />
it compulsory. One thing to be voluntary, why didn't you simply<br />
say as with the old schemes, older people remember the old<br />
schemes. PM: Well, it would be a fraud to talk about compulsion because<br />
you have got guarantee that in any immediate sense we would be<br />
able to get together a bank of community jobs, running into<br />
hundreds of thousands, there would be more of a demand, more of<br />
the unemployed than there will be community work. So the<br />
question of compulsion in those circumstances would be a fraud.<br />
You would have to imply, if you said compulsion, that you know<br />
that you could immediately have available more of these jobs than<br />
you know, in fact, you could create.<br />
MARTIN: They are talking of course about the old schemes where<br />
people painted park benches and fixed up playgrounds and those<br />
sorts of community efforts. </p>
<p>12<br />
PM: The RED scheme. That was not comprehensive enough, it<br />
didn't cover the full gambit. If you reached a stage some years<br />
down the track where you, as a community, created more community<br />
work opportunities than there were people, and you got a body of<br />
people who were saying to the community we are just not<br />
interested in doing anything, the community may well then say to<br />
the government well we want you, in those circumstances to look<br />
at the question of compulsion. But it is an unreal sort of<br />
injection at this stage.<br />
QUESTION: My name is Rhoda and I am unemployed as well. what I<br />
am worried about is the scheme being abused, people who could be<br />
getting jobs are going to lose jobs because they will think right<br />
we will use these people on this scheme, we will get things done.<br />
And also I was the scheme, where after being unemployed for six<br />
months, I had the government's support where if someone employed<br />
they payed a percentage of my wage. I was used for the time that<br />
that was available and sacked the day it was finished.<br />
PM: That was the SYETP, the Special Youth Employment Training<br />
Program, known as the Sweet P. And I know, it was a scheme that<br />
was abused, you are quite right. But this is something quite<br />
different. We have reformed the Sweet P scheme so that where you<br />
do have the community, and I keep saying the community not the<br />
government, it is the community's money. Where the community is<br />
providing assistance to employers, it is much more rigorously<br />
oversighted so that that sort of abuse can't take place. But<br />
what I am trying to point is that over and beyond the<br />
opportunities that are provided in the normal workforce situation<br />
by schemes like the Sweet P scheme and its equivalent. There is<br />
still unfortunately although we have reduced the levels of<br />
unemployment from the over 10% that we inherited down to less<br />
than There is still going to be people who are not going to<br />
be able to take advantage. So these sorts of schemes that we are<br />
talking about are not in the normal private employment sector.<br />
The sort of things that need to be done in a community for which<br />
there wouldn't normally be assistance. Let me give you an<br />
example. It is just an example but assistance to the aged, I<br />
think there is a lot of good that could be done in this community<br />
by unemployed young people. Giving assistance to old people,<br />
there is a number of ways in which this could be done. Helping to<br />
clean up old peoples homes, just a whole number of things that<br />
aren't in the private sector workforce sort of concept but things<br />
that could be done which would make old people better.<br />
QUESTION: But along the lines of the charities, things that<br />
charity workers<br />
Yes, you see you have Rotary organisations and Lions clubs<br />
right around Australia. They are organising working bees to try<br />
an improve the facilities that are available to old people and<br />
disabled people and so on. Now those sorts of things are<br />
admirable. It seems to me that we could help young people get a </p>
<p>better sense of their self-esteem if rather.-thln just going along<br />
and getting the dole cheque they had the opportunity of doing<br />
those sorts of things. It is not intruding into the normal<br />
private sector workforce or the public sector workforce. But it<br />
is doing things that would be both good for the community, good<br />
for the young people themselves, and as I said to Kay, still<br />
leaving them time to try then to look for work in the normal<br />
workforce. And I think they would go looking in that way with a<br />
better sense of self esteem.<br />
QUESTION: Hula Pillion from Southe rn Highlands. Appropos of<br />
having people work I belong to an organisation which could<br />
tomorrow give unemployed people, at least 30 of them work. I even<br />
got a bus drivers licence because there was no one to transport<br />
mentally and physically handicapped people. And I am sure if the<br />
young people went to organisations like neighbourhood centres and<br />
what have you, they could all get part time work which would, I<br />
could give 20 of them work tomorrow, and they would do 20 or<br />
hours work for the week and feel good about it. That wasn't my<br />
question but that was....... Could the Government not save money<br />
by issuing, instead of a new Australia Card to everybody, a<br />
passport which could be utilised overseas as well and it would<br />
take the part of the ID card, I mean it is an ID card isn't it, a<br />
passport, and I would say quite a big percentage of Australians<br />
have a passport and it is a status symbol to some.<br />
PM: No, they serve two different purposes. They are two quite<br />
separate sort of concepts. We are committed to the idea of an ID<br />
card because there is no other way in which this community, I go<br />
back to the fact that it is your money that we are dealing with,<br />
your resources. There is no other way in which a Government can<br />
be certain that it will do two things. Firstly, in regard to the<br />
collection of tax it will be sure that everyone is making their<br />
contribution. And secondly, that we can cut out fraud in the<br />
social welfare area. Now the best estimates are that through the<br />
issuance of an ID card with a photograph will save billions of<br />
dollars in that way of your money and that is what we have got to<br />
do. MARTIN: Alright we will take a break there for a moment then we<br />
will come back. The PM has agreed to stay for an extra few<br />
minutes. So take a break and then back. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Dedrie-lesley, you encourage us to buy Australian<br />
goods yet most Australian goods cost more than imported goods.<br />
What is your Government's policy on funding Australian<br />
manufacturers? PM: First of all it's not accurate to say most Australia goods<br />
cost more than imported goods. That's not true, some do. We've<br />
got a range of assistance to the Australia manufacturing<br />
industry. One which is terribly important is the 150 per cent<br />
tax concession for research and development to Australian<br />
manufacturing industry which has been widely welcomed by them and<br />
has paid off a lot of dividends. But I wonder if I could just<br />
quickly say something about buy Australian because we talk about<br />
the things that governments have got to do and it is right that<br />
governments on you behalf have to do things that only governments<br />
can do. But this area of ' buy Australian' is something where<br />
every single Australian can do something to help this country. I<br />
think I said to you before when we were talking about it, I want<br />
to say it again to this audience. If each single Australian, or<br />
those responsible for all Australians in the case of kids, if we<br />
were to substitute our buying just in a whole year $ 100, if we to<br />
buy $ 100 worth of Australian products where we spend it on<br />
overseas products, that would add up to $ 1.6 billion. if we made<br />
it 200 that's $ 3.2 billion. Now I've just sat down and thought<br />
about it myself because I just don't like saying words without<br />
thinking about what it means. And I have thought of things where<br />
I have bough some articles of clothing which if I had bought<br />
Australian, I could have done it and I was a bit sloppy about it.<br />
Now I think if we just realise that at $ 100 per Australian in the<br />
course of a year we could turn our balance of payments around by<br />
$ 3.2 billion. Now that is the sort of thing we can do. We ought<br />
to convert our statements about being proud to be Australians<br />
into reality. And that is something each one of us can do Ray.<br />
MARTIN: Can I dip back here again because I am sure you have<br />
heard the criticism. Buying Australian letters here saying why<br />
are we buying New Zealand carpets for the new Parliament House?<br />
Why are buying Italian glasses for the new Parliament House?<br />
PM: Well, I agree. I just don't agree with those decisions. Let<br />
me say that what happens in terms of decisions that are made by<br />
all the authorities and so on doesn't come to Cabinet. I can't<br />
answer for every authority but I would say to you quite clearly<br />
that as far as this Government is concerned now we are going to<br />
be pushing at the level of Government purchases for a preference<br />
for Australian products. The Government will give the lead and I<br />
hope that ordinary Australians themselves will just consciously<br />
when you go to buy something you say is this Australian?<br />
MARTIN:.--Is that suit Australian?<br />
PM: That is Australian Melbourne. This is Gloweave, Melbourne,<br />
Fletcher Jones, Florsheim, Melbourne. The best socks in the<br />
world, the computer roll up socks. And modesty forbid me but<br />
beaut Bond underwear.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, my name is Gary Wicks. I am from the Kurnell<br />
oil refineries. Taking on what you just said about buying </p>
<p>Australian, your Government is considering in late 1987 early<br />
1988 bringing in a concept known as a free market in the oil<br />
industry in Australia. Now would you not see that as being<br />
diametrically opposed to what you have said about being<br />
Australian, buying Australian for Australians because to import<br />
all that finished product from overseas at the expense of the<br />
Australian refining industry is just hypocritical?<br />
PM': No it is not. Let me make this point that we haven't got<br />
unlimited Australian resources of oil. We haven't. I mean if we<br />
had a situation where we knew that there was just an unlimited<br />
amount of oil then what you are saying would make sense. But we<br />
have got to look at conservation of our resources as well as<br />
utilisation so it makes sense to try and get the best economic<br />
deal that is available when you have those limited resources.<br />
Quite different from the sort of thing that I am talking about<br />
where out there on the shelf if you have got two products, one<br />
Australian and one imported, where you should I believe make a<br />
conscious decision to buy Australian if you possibly can. It is a<br />
different proposition.<br />
QUESTION: Are you aware that that decision, if made by your<br />
Government, is going to cost thousands and thousands of jobs?<br />
PM: Well we haven't made the decision yet. But if you simply<br />
made every decision in terms of what it meant for keeping an<br />
existing Australian job then that wouldn't be wise because what<br />
you have got to remember is that Australians have to buy a<br />
particularly product. If you insist that for every product it<br />
must be made in Australian then the farmers are shot. I mean if<br />
you are selling overseas then you do have to import. And what I<br />
am talking about buying Australian does not carry the<br />
implication that we mustn't import at all from overseas. we have<br />
got to import from overseas because if we don't then how are our<br />
exporters going to live. Selling from overseas involves buying<br />
from overseas. All I am saying however is within that concept<br />
where we do have to trade and have imports you have still got a<br />
big range of choice as Australian consumers. And it is where you<br />
have got the choice, the real choice that exists, the choice<br />
should be for Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Hawke, you say buy Australian. I am an ave rage<br />
Australian, I walk around the supermarket and pick up products<br />
and I say I want to buy Australian. OK the products in the<br />
supermarket may be grown in Australia but it is packaged<br />
overseas or it is brought in under an Australian brand name but<br />
it is packaged overseas. Also in the the clothing line, designed<br />
in Australia but manufactured Taiwan, manufactured in Hong Kong,<br />
manufactured in China. It is very difficult to buy Australian.<br />
Australian manufacturers hav-eben forced into a position of just<br />
another multinational company. To manufacture in Australia they<br />
can no longer afford to compete with the goods being imported<br />
from overseas. So they are forced into a situation where they may<br />
design in Australia but to compete on the local market they then<br />
have to manufacture overseas and bring those goods back into<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>PM: That is not generally true. It is obviously true in some<br />
cases. It is true that in a whole range of areas Australian<br />
consumers do have a choice, a legitimate choice between an<br />
Australian manufactured design and assembled product in<br />
Australian and one which is from overseas. Now I believe that we<br />
do have to address ourselves to some of the areas that you're<br />
talking aboutto try and get a situation where there is more done<br />
in Australia to develop Australian design. Can I just go to one<br />
thing that I was talking last night up at the Lodge to Barry<br />
Jones, the Minister for Science. He was telling me about this<br />
truly exciting development in respect to a motor vehicle engine.<br />
I won't go into the technical details, but it's quite<br />
revolutionary. It offers an enormously exciting prospect. The<br />
thing we've got to make sure of in regard to this, if it's a goer<br />
which it looks as though it can be, is that as far as we can keep<br />
the benefit for Australia. Too often what's happened in the past<br />
you've had Australian genius in a whole range of fields, they<br />
work out the concept then off it goes overseas and we lose the<br />
benefit.<br />
QUESTION: Isn't that a Government problem that the funds aren't<br />
there to develop. OK the research is done in Australia but then<br />
researchers have to go overseas to develop their goods.<br />
PM: There has been too much of that in the past. What I'm<br />
saying is<br />
QUESTION: But there's still too much of it.<br />
PM: Well it is much better now because we are in it by a range<br />
of the things that we've done as Government providing more<br />
incentive for the people with the ideas to stay within Australia.<br />
As far as this particular one that I was talking about, this new<br />
revolutionary concept of an engineer that's being talked about<br />
here. MARTIN: Let's go to the last question. Let's give the last<br />
question to the next generation Mr Hawke.<br />
QUESTION: On a recent program small kids with wheelchairs didn't<br />
have enough money to buy new wheelchairs. Then the next part of<br />
the program they showed women surfing getting paid 2,000 or so<br />
dollars. PM: I think it was 12 actually.<br />
QUESTION: To start up a new organisation or something. Do you<br />
think that's righ-t?<br />
PM: It was $ 12,000 1 understood. I didn't know anything about<br />
it until I saw the program and as I understand it was to try and<br />
develop with $ 12,000, which is not a great deal of money in the<br />
overall scheme, to try and get more interest by more women in<br />
surfing. I'm not saying it's necessarily the greatest idea in<br />
the world, but I don't get terribly excited about it. As far as<br />
the area that you're talking about, of the disabled, all r can<br />
say is that we've substantially increased not only the funding in </p>
<p>17<br />
real terms, but organisational4y improved the arrangements within<br />
Australia for more assistance to the disabled. So it is really<br />
quite unfair to say, well look, what about the disabled and imply<br />
that because $ 12,000 is being made available to some exercise in<br />
regard to more involvement for women in surfing that we haven't<br />
thought about the disabled. I'm very proud of what we've done in<br />
the area of the disabled. We've done more for them in real terms<br />
than has ever been done before.<br />
ends S </p>
<p>attachment Dear Prime Minister,<br />
Thanks to the Government's support in investing in [ and they name<br />
their company and they refer to our investments grants) we are<br />
now in a position to build a $ 70 million plant late in ' 86. Due<br />
to government support 250 new jobs will be created immediately<br />
the plant is completed and will increase to a total of 500 jobs<br />
within 4 years. I know the Government has done a lot more to<br />
assist the country's exports and job creation than it is aware. </p>
