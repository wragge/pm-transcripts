COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRLIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
GLADSTONE POWER STATION AGREEMENT BILL<br />
Second Reading<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 14 April 19701<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 4.61-1 move:<br />
That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />
On 26th September last year I announced<br />
to the House that the Commonwealth Government<br />
was prepared to provide a loan<br />
of up to $ 80m to the Queensland Government<br />
to help the State finance the construction<br />
of a proposed large scale power station<br />
at Gladstone in central Queensland which<br />
would provide low-cost power and, through<br />
it, attract a viable export oriented industrial<br />
complex to central Queensland. The offer<br />
was conditional on the State being able to<br />
satisfy the Commonwealth that it could<br />
attract such special industrial development<br />
to the region. Since that announcement<br />
negotiations have progressed between the<br />
State and Organisations likely to establish<br />
industries in the central Queensland region,<br />
and also between the Queensland Government<br />
and the Commonwealth. The result of<br />
these negotiations is that the Queensland Government<br />
has satisfied the Commonwealth<br />
that major export oriented industries are<br />
likely to be attracted to central Queensland<br />
through the provision of the low-cost power;<br />
and the Commonwealth and Queensland<br />
governments have reached agreement on<br />
the terms and conditions of a Common-<br />
14461/ 70 wealth loan to the State to assist with the<br />
necessary works. On 8th April an agreement<br />
between the 2 governments was signed<br />
by myself and the Premier of Queensland.<br />
The purpose of this Bill is to seek Parliament's<br />
approval for the agreement to come<br />
into effect and for the provision of the<br />
financial assistance specified in the aggreement.<br />
The estimated cost of the proposed power<br />
station together with local reticulation at<br />
Gladstone, at 1968 prices, is $ 155m. It<br />
will have an approximate total installed<br />
generating capacity of 1100 megawatts, of<br />
which about 600 megawatts will be reserved<br />
by the State for special industrial purposes<br />
in central Queensland. For the purpose of<br />
the agreement the Queensland Government<br />
shall produce evidence satisfactory to the<br />
Minister for National Development that the<br />
State has entered into or proposes to enter<br />
into agreements, arrangements and options<br />
for the consumption of electrical power by<br />
industrial organisations which will export<br />
a substantial proportion of their products<br />
or which will produce goods of a kind<br />
which will be supplied to industries producing<br />
goods predominantly for export.<br />
As in other similar arrangements, provision<br />
is made in the agreement for the </p>
<p>approval by the Minister for National<br />
Development of the letting of major contracts-<br />
in this instance those for the performance<br />
of works to a value in excess of<br />
Sim. The actual amount of the Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance will depend on<br />
the cost of construction of the power station<br />
and local reticulation. The agreement provides<br />
for a variation in the amount of<br />
finanical assistance above or below $ 80m<br />
according to any variation which occurs in<br />
the total cost above or below $ 155m. Thus<br />
the amount of financial assistance may be<br />
-expressed arithmetically as 80/ 1 S5ths of the<br />
total cost of the project. Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance will be available towards<br />
expenditure by the State on the project<br />
during the period commencing on the date<br />
of my announcement, 26th September 1969<br />
and ending on 30th June 1977. The assistance<br />
will be in the form of an interest<br />
bearing loan repayable over a period of<br />
years commencing when the power<br />
station is completed. The loan will carry<br />
interest at the rate of 6.4% per annum to<br />
accrue and to be capitalised during the construction<br />
of the project. There is, however,<br />
provision for the State to make payments<br />
of interest, instead of allowing the interest<br />
to be capitalised, once integral components<br />
of the station are commissioned and producing<br />
power. There is also provision for<br />
interest charges not to be payable during<br />
the early stages of construction of the project,<br />
thus reducing the overall interest cost<br />
to somewhat below 6.4%.<br />
Honourable members no doubt will be<br />
interested in an outline of the background<br />
to this important project. Prior to its consideration<br />
of a major power station at<br />
Gladstone the State had already envisaged<br />
the construction of a thermal power station<br />
in the region as part of its programme for<br />
a general expansion to meet normal growth<br />
in the demand for electricity. The initial<br />
planning involved interconnection of the<br />
supply networks located in southern and<br />
central Queensland. A number of studies of<br />
the prospects for development of central<br />
Queensland, including a study by the Department<br />
of National Development in conjunction<br />
with the State Department of Industrial<br />
Development, have pointed to the imposing<br />
array of natural resources which exist in<br />
the region. These resources have been<br />
shown to be outstanding in bath variety<br />
and magnitude, yet still relatively underdeveloped. The official studies and various<br />
industry inquiries have indicated that these<br />
resources could well be a base for the<br />
establishment of large scale export oriented<br />
industries. In saying this, it should be remembered<br />
too that impressive developments have<br />
already been taking place in the region.<br />
For example, large coal mining and export<br />
operations have become established, the<br />
ports of Gladstone and Port Alma have<br />
been considerably developed and a large<br />
scale alumina project established at Gladstone<br />
is entering a major expansionary stage.<br />
The region possesses very large resources<br />
of steaming coal, considerable quantities of<br />
which are mined and produced together with<br />
coking coal by companies principally engaged<br />
in the production and export of<br />
coking coal in the region. This steaming<br />
coal will be regularly available to the State<br />
at low cost.<br />
Against this background of resources and<br />
potential the Premier of Queensland in<br />
September 1968 raised with me the possibility<br />
of the Commonwealth assisting the<br />
State with capital in order that a power<br />
station could be built at Gladstone to provide<br />
the high load factor and low-cost<br />
supply required to attract major export<br />
oriented industries to central Queensland.<br />
At that time negotiations had commenced<br />
between Queensland Ministers and officials<br />
and several companies interested in major<br />
industrial development in the region. Since<br />
then the proposals put forward by the<br />
Queensland Government have been closely<br />
examined by the Commonwealth. I would<br />
mention that, in the course of these investigations,<br />
the Snowy Mountains Authority<br />
was engaged as consultants. The Commonwealth,<br />
as a result of these investigations,<br />
is greatly impressed with the potential of<br />
the power station project both for attracting<br />
major industries to central Queensland and<br />
for bringing about a substantial lift in<br />
exports. Naturally the negotiations between the<br />
Queensland Government and the companies<br />
concerned are confidential. I can say that<br />
the Commonwealth is satisfied from the<br />
evidence presented to it that major export<br />
oriented industries will be establishing in<br />
central Queensland. In fact, the Government<br />
believes, as the Governor-General said in<br />
his speech on 3rd March, that the power<br />
station will result in the construction of an </p>
<p>aluminium smelter, possibly the biggest in<br />
the southern hemisphere, and in other industrial<br />
development. We are confident, along<br />
with the Queensland Government, that the<br />
power station will attract a major chemical<br />
industry using the extensive salt resources in<br />
the area and we have high hopes that operations<br />
in this field may commence in 2 or 3<br />
years time. There is indeed a whole range<br />
of industries which could be attracted to<br />
central Queensland by the power station.<br />
To the best of my knowledge these have<br />
not been brought to finality, but it is fully<br />
expected that that will happen. The Government<br />
believes that its support of this project,<br />
besides encouraging new industrial development<br />
and a lift in exports, will prove to be<br />
a concrete example of decentralisation.<br />
There is one further matter which I<br />
should bring to the attention of honourable<br />
members. The Queensland Government has<br />
also asked that the Commonwealth give<br />
consideration to further financial assistance<br />
at a later date should the demand for power<br />
from the special export oriented industries<br />
to be established in the region increase to<br />
such a pronounced degree that further enlargement<br />
of the power station would then<br />
be required. While the Government cannot<br />
at this stage give any commitment in relation<br />
to decisions that will have to be taken by a future Government in the circumstances<br />
existing then, we have informed the Queensland<br />
Government that we would approach<br />
the matter sympathetically when it arrives.<br />
I would like to give to the House an<br />
example of the kind of development to<br />
which this project might lead. If the<br />
aluminium smelter to which I have referred<br />
should be established in this region it is<br />
likely that at its first stage of production<br />
it could be producing 240,000 tons of<br />
aluminium a year at a value on present<br />
day prices of about $ 126m. At a later stage,<br />
should a go well, it could be producing<br />
320,000 tons of aluminium at an export<br />
value of $ 165m. The taxation revenue alone<br />
from such a development, should it come<br />
to fruition, would make this indeed a<br />
proper business proposition. But this is not<br />
only a business proposition. It is, as I have<br />
said, a concrete example of decentraiation<br />
and it may well prove to be the greatest<br />
step yet taken to awaken in that area of<br />
Queensland-a State which has been called<br />
a sleeping giant-really significant industrial<br />
development, a real increase in population,<br />
a real benefit to the State, and, through its<br />
exports, a real benefit to the nation. I<br />
commend the Bill to the House.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr Stewart)<br />
adjourned.<br />
