PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ARRIVAL OF POPE JOHN PAUL II<br />
RAAF BASE, FAIRBAIRN 24 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
Your Holiness,<br />
Welcome again to Australia.<br />
On behalf of the Australian people and Government, may I<br />
extend to you our best wishes for a most successful visit.<br />
It is an honour to have you here and a pleasure to know that<br />
over the next few days you will experience at first hand the<br />
great warmth and respect that exist for you in this country.<br />
Since you left Rome on 18 November we have watched your<br />
progress towards our country with a growing sense of<br />
excitement, knowing that awaiting you here was an<br />
enthusiastic and heartfelt welcome.<br />
For you come to us as a man for all people. Of course you<br />
are here as the beloved pastor of the people of the Catholic<br />
faith in particular. But all Australians will welcome you<br />
as a prominent and respected messenger of the universal<br />
values of peace and of hope and of justice.<br />
So the Government is very pleased that you have been able to<br />
accept our invitation, and that of the Australian Catholic<br />
Bishops, to visit our country and meet our people.<br />
This is only the second time Australia has hosted a visit by<br />
the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Your distinguished<br />
predecessor, Pope Paul VI, paid an all-too-brief visit to<br />
Sydney in 1970. So we are delighted to welcome you at the<br />
outset of such a long tour which will bring you into contact<br />
with such a large number of Australians in so many parts of<br />
this great continent.<br />
This is of course not your first visit to Australia.<br />
Thirteen years ago, as a Cardinal, you attended the<br />
International Eucharistic Congress in Melbourne. But on<br />
this occasion, you will visit all our States and<br />
Territories. You will cross the country from coast to<br />
coast, from East to West, and from Tasmania in the south to<br />
the Northern Territory. You will see at first hand the<br />
heart of our country. </p>
<p>This great expedition will allow you to meet the young and<br />
the old, the sick and the disadvantaged, people of many<br />
faiths, our Aboriginal people and those who have come from<br />
other lands to join the Australian community.<br />
The depth and extent of your pastoral concern for the people<br />
of Australia are evident through the strenuous and full<br />
schedule you are undertaking in the next six and a half<br />
days. Indeed, your Holiness, you are undertaking an<br />
itinerary which would be daunting to a man with less energy<br />
and commitment.<br />
You have the Government's fullest support in your efforts to<br />
meet, encourage and inspire all Australians.<br />
I know that during your meetings with us you will find<br />
openness and friendship and great enthusiasm about your<br />
presence among us.<br />
I wish you a most rewarding and memorable stay. </p>
