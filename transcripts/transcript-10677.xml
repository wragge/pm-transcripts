    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Don McDonald wrote letter to the National Party Leader Tim Fischer,</p>
<p> asking him to hold off on the sale of Telstra, to urge you to do that.</p>
<p> How much of a threat is that to your tax package, your plans for a</p>
<p> GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well none.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But how can you sell a GST without support from the National Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will go ahead with tax reform, full steam ahead. There will be</p>
<p> no change. Because there is an Asian economic downturn that makes</p>
<p> it all the more important to have tax reform in this country and there</p>
<p> is no way on Earth that the Government is going to back off tax reform,</p>
<p> no way on Earth.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It will make it a lot more difficult though isn't it, if you</p>
<p> don't have the support of the National Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You will see very strong support for the policy when it comes out.</p>
<p> But can I just make it very clear so nobody is in any doubt, we are</p>
<p> not in any way backtracking or relenting or faltering on tax reform</p>
<p> and the reason for that is that it is good for Australia. It's</p>
<p> got nothing to do with ideology, it has got nothing to do with personal</p>
<p> pride of ownership. It's got to do with one very simple thing</p>
<p> and that is that it is in the interests of Australia that we have</p>
<p> a fairer taxation system. It is in the interests of Australia that</p>
<p> in these difficult international economic times this country's</p>
<p> protection against that difficult world economic environment be added</p>
<p> to and not subtracted from. And we are pursuing tax reform because</p>
<p> it is good for the country and for no other reason.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... with the National Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the National Party members of the Government have been fully</p>
<p> involved in this from the word go. Mr Fischer and I have spent literally</p>
<p> hours and hours and hours with our colleagues talking about the tax</p>
<p> policy. The processes that have been followed in relation to formulating</p>
<p> the tax policy are the same processes that have been followed in formulating</p>
<p> all other policies of the Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When will we see the tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it will be ready quite soon but I'm not going to put a day</p>
<p> on it. I mean it is pointless asking me to name the date, that is</p>
<p> just a wasted question. It will be ready soon. I do not further qualify</p>
<p> that prediction.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you going to lead a divided Coalition in an election campaign</p>
<p> given the position the National Party now holds on a GST and Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the policy of the National Party as part of the Coalition is</p>
<p> determined by the parliamentary National Party and the parliamentary</p>
<p> National Party is part of the Government and therefore in full support.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)... proposals are good policies for Australia, is the</p>
<p> National Party analysing the mood of the electorate correctly? Are</p>
<p> they getting it right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the National Party members of the Government support the policy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are they running scared of Pauline Hanson?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I don't know. I think the best way to respond to One Nation</p>
<p> is to do good things for Australia. You don't beat off the challenge</p>
<p> of an alternative Party by appeasing that Party. You don't beat</p>
<p> off the challenge of an alternative Party by taking fright. You beat</p>
<p> off the challenge of an alternative Party by offering policies that</p>
<p> are good for Australia and that is why we pursue tax reform. It is</p>
<p> why we have cut interest rates. It is why we have cut inflation. It</p>
<p> is why we have generated 290,000 jobs since we came to power. It is</p>
<p> why we have given relief to small business. It is why we have tackled</p>
<p> welfare cheating and saved Australians $46 million a week as a result.</p>
<p> It is why we have introduced work-for-the-dole. All of these policies</p>
<p> are designed to better Australia and the way in which you win in public</p>
<p> life is to do good things for the country. You don't win in public</p>
<p> life by sloganeering, and by attacking people on a personal basis.</p>
<p> You win in public life by doing good things for the country that you</p>
<p> lead. And what we intend to do as a Government in relation to our</p>
<p> two opponents, the Labor Party and One Nation, and they are much closer</p>
<p> to each other on economic policy than either of them is to us. I mean,</p>
<p> it is very interesting. You've now got an alliance between One</p>
<p> Nation and Labor on economic issues. And the way in which we respond</p>
<p> to that alliance between Hanson and Beazley on economic policy is</p>
<p> to forge ahead with our own policies and that is the message, the</p>
<p> answer, the signal that I send to all Coalition supporters around</p>
<p> Australia. The way to win is to stick to your guns, to do the things</p>
<p> that are good for Australia, and that includes reforming Australia's</p>
<p> unfair anti-export, anti-rural taxation system. Thank you very much,</p>
<p> I have another appointment, very very nice.....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.... (inaudible)...how are you addressing that while you are</p>
<p> here and how confident are you given that it could impact on your</p>
<p> marginal federal seats.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well any advice I might give about the organisation of the Liberal</p>
<p> Party anywhere around Australia I would tender as is my ....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you expressed your displeasure...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would tender, if I could finish, could I finish?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, with respect, you're not answering the question.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, with respect you keep interrupting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... displeasure... have you expressed to Mr Olsen close to the</p>
<p> October State election result, how concerned are you now regarding</p>
<p> that on-going fighting when you're facing a federal election</p>
<p> and marginal seats?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As I was saying before I was interrupted, any advice that I tender</p>
<p> about organisational matters in the Liberal Party, I tender in private.</p>
<p>(ENDS)</p>
