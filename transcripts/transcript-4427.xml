US I LIA~<br />
FOR PRESS 22 JUNE 1977<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON ARRIVAL<br />
CEREMONY AT THE WHITE HOUSE<br />
Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be in Washington again,<br />
and I thank you for your warm welcome. You have recognised<br />
and stated clearly the need for the democracies to consult more<br />
closely and work in cooperation with one another, to show<br />
unity and purpose.<br />
I think we all have to realise the need for increased communication,<br />
and cooperation between the democracies. Confidence in ourselves,<br />
in the values we share in the ca'jac ity and strength of free people,<br />
is essential if progress is to be made in resolving the problems<br />
faced by mankind.<br />
These problems are of urgent and fundamental importance to all of<br />
us. We are faced by the inability of of many countries to escape from<br />
poverty, growing world concern o ver the availability of energy<br />
resources, the denial of fundamental freedoms to many people, the<br />
continued potential for conflict, the possibility of nuclear<br />
proliferation, and arms races.<br />
These problems demand greater attention. For too long, words<br />
have been a substitute for effective action<br />
We have to act now with a sense of urgency and determination.<br />
Millions of people throughout the world want progress in the<br />
resolution of these problems. This was reflected clearly in the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government conference I have just attended<br />
in London.<br />
Mr President, as a near neighbour to many developing countries,<br />
as a significant source of many important commodities, as<br />
a country with an unswerving faith in democracy, Australia<br />
is determined to play her part in making progress towards<br />
these ends.<br />
Mr President, you have shown that you are determined to use the<br />
strength and influence of the United States to bring about a more<br />
secure and equitable world, a world in which poorer nations' economic<br />
development is accelerated, in which deprivation is confronted<br />
and the pernicious doctrine of one' race's superiority over another<br />
is banned for all time. / 2 </p>
<p>There are many obstacles in the way of achieving these objectives<br />
It is always the case that the more important the goal, the greater<br />
the barrier to achieving it. But the barriers to achieving a<br />
better world might well be insuperable, if the greatest democratic<br />
power were not playing an active and enlightened international role.<br />
Mr President, we believe therefore, that your Presidency has<br />
excited men's imagination because it has appealed to the<br />
idealism of free people, because it has focused concern<br />
on issues which had not previously attracted the urgent attention<br />
they require, and because it has stressed the need for consultation<br />
and cooperation among the democracies.<br />
Free men can have renewed faith in realising the aspirations<br />
we share. 0000oo00000 </p>
