    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians, I wish to extend to the Iranian people my deepest condolences for the devastation caused by the earthquake in south eastern Iran.</p>
<p>All Australians are shocked at the terrible loss of life. Our thoughts today go out to the victims of this disaster and the families and loved ones of those who perished.</p>
<p>A large number of the Iranian community in Australia are from Kerman province.</p>
<p>I have written to Iran';s President Mohammad Khatami to offer the profound sympathies of the Australian Government and people.</p>
<p>Our best wishes are with the international relief and emergency teams working to help the thousands of bereaved and injured Iranians in the city of Bam.</p>
<p>As announced by the Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, the Australian Government will provide $2 million as immediate relief and emergency assistance to the victims of the earthquake. This funding will directly contribute to international relief efforts now in operation.</p>
<p>Australia will closely monitor the situation in Iran and consider additional assistance based on the advice of international agencies on the ground.  </p>
