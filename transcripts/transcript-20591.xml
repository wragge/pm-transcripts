    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will make a contribution of $150,000 to the Mission Australia Winter Homeless Appeal.</p>
<p>Homelessness is a complex problem with devastating consequences and is often associated with drugs, alcohol, mental health problems, gambling and family breakdown.</p>
<p> Mission Australia assists around 40,000 Australians each year with crisis, medium and long term accommodation, as well as longer-term support such as skills training and employment assistance, drug and alcohol addiction counselling, financial assistance, and help with family breakdown and family violence.</p>
<p>Funds raised by the Appeal will help the Mission continue its valuable work to provide crisis accommodation and to establish lasting independence for the homeless in the longer term.</p>
<p>The Government believes that tackling homelessness at its source depends on working together in a social coalition with individuals, families, businesses and welfare organisations so that those touched by homelessness can participate fully in the community.</p>
<p> We acknowledge the vital assistance provided by Mission Australia, and are delighted to support the Mission in their continuing assistance for people who are homeless.</p>
<p>In addition to contributing to the appeal, the Commonwealth has sought to address the problem of homelessness through a number of initiatives. We have provided $3.7 million over three years for The National Homelessness Strategy, announced in May 2000 to help identify and help tackle some of the root causes of homelessness.</p>
<p>Other Commonwealth funding includes $5 million over three years provided for the Family Homelessness Prevention Pilots, $832 million over 2000-2005 to the Supported Accommodation Assistance Programme (SAAP) and $60 million for the Reconnect programme.</p>
<p>I would encourage all Australians to support the Mission Australia Winter Homeless Appeal. </p>
