TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, MONASH UNIVERSITY, MELBOURNE,<br />
12 MAY 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: We wanted your reaction to the opposition industrial<br />
policy? PM: It is a mish-mash of two conflicting ideologies. They have<br />
tried to patch together those conflicting views, which of course,<br />
has resulted in something which is quite inappropriate and<br />
irrelevant to Australia's interests. It provides no instrument<br />
of wages policy. And of course they learn nothing from the past.<br />
They were in government for seven years and one of the central<br />
reasons which brought this economy to its worst recession in<br />
years was the absence of any wages policy. All they had was the<br />
blunt, tough, undiscriminating elements of monetary and fiscal<br />
policy. And when they couldn't control inflation and regulate<br />
growth by doing something in the area of wages, they just put<br />
on the screws and of course we had double digit inflation and<br />
double digit unemployment. Now, this policy doesn't refer to the<br />
question of macroeconomic policy, doesn't go to the question of<br />
employment and unemployment in it at all. What the people of<br />
Australia will understand is that they have witnessed a party in<br />
turmoil, bitterly divided, one strand wanting one thing, the<br />
other strand wanting another. They haven't come up with a<br />
policy, they have come up with a compromise between conflicting<br />
ideologies. That is all right for them. The tragedy is that<br />
Australia is the one that would suffer as a result of the<br />
abrogation of their responsibilities.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any element of the policy which you do find<br />
acceptable? PM: I am not negative in my approach to politics and where they<br />
have done good things in the past for instance Malcolm Fraser<br />
in the area of race relations I have been unqualified in my<br />
recognition of virtue where it exists on that side. But you just<br />
can't find anything which is relevant. I repeat, the essential<br />
explanation of what has emerged is an attempt to find a<br />
resolution between conflicting ideologies and factions. That is<br />
not the way you get policies which are relevant to the current<br />
and future programs for Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: If it were implemented, what would happen to the<br />
system? </p>
<p>pm: Well, you haven't been up in the Canberra Gallery and I have<br />
a habit of not answering hypothetical questions. But let me say<br />
this, it won't be given the opportunity to do that. One of the<br />
reasons and there are many why the Australian people will<br />
reject this divided, bitterly divided opposition is because<br />
they will recognise, very simply, they have been there, they have<br />
had them for seven years, they have seen what happened in those<br />
seven years with exactly the same sort of approaches and<br />
concepts. It didn't work. We have produced an alternative which<br />
has turned the economy around. It has provided employment growth<br />
with its sustainable levels of inflation and record levels of<br />
economic growth. We have done that and we have done it because<br />
we have had an industrial relations and wages policy which has<br />
given government another lever of policy. we just don't rely<br />
simply on monetary and fiscal policy. We have provided the<br />
government with that instrument of wages policy. And that is<br />
lacking in the policy of the Libs.<br />
JOURNALIST: The left wing unions on the weekend gave you a<br />
pretty clear statement that the Accord would be washed up if you<br />
didn't deliver the tax cuts in September. Can you give us an<br />
unequivocal statement that those tax cuts will still be there?<br />
PM: Let me say this that since February of 1983 I have been<br />
hearing from various sources that the Accord is finished, it will<br />
never work. Now we are hearing it again from a particular<br />
quarter. The Accord will last, it will work and it will work<br />
because the various elements of the Accord will be given effect<br />
to. JOURNALIST: So those tax cuts will remain?<br />
PM: I have answered the question of the tax cuts.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible question<br />
PM: But you ought to know that as far as I am concerned, that I<br />
have said in the Parliament and outside that we put our<br />
comprehensive policy including the question of tax cuts where it<br />
should be put. But let me say this, the tax cuts will come in.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Commonwealth Bank today predicted a two per cent<br />
fall in bank home loan interest rates. what is your observation?<br />
PM: Now Mr Christie, the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, had<br />
some very encouraging things to say about interest rates. I<br />
don't want, in a relatively volatile situation, to be commenting<br />
beyond what Mr Christie has said. But let me say these two<br />
things. Firstly, it is the case that over the last couple of<br />
months there has been a substantial decline in interest rates and<br />
Mr Christie is saying that he believes on his understanding of<br />
the factors which are relevant in the level of interest rates,<br />
that those factors will continue to produce a further decline in<br />
rates. Well, I am glad to hear that statement from a person<br />
centrally involved. But I am not going to add my comment or<br />
prediction as to the rate of movement and the timing of it. But<br />
I am glad to hear those sorts of statements. </p>
<p>3.<br />
JOURNALIST: But nevertheless you would be optimistic in the long<br />
term? PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the union meeting on Saturday also said<br />
that the Government was preoccupied with the trilogy and being so<br />
preoccupied was alienating ALP supporters and that you could lose<br />
the next election. Are you worried?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that that is an overreaction from the<br />
unions? PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: In your speech you alluded to a pause often being<br />
required for improvement to get sustained growth. Is that a<br />
message aimed directly at those 23 left wing unions?<br />
PM: No. You seem to have an obsession with a meeting of some<br />
unions. JOURNALIST: Pretty powerful group, 40 per cent of ACTU<br />
affiliates. PM: You talk about that meeting, I talk with the leadership of<br />
the ACTU which represents the whole of the unions. And it seems<br />
to me, as the leader of the Government, that that is a pretty<br />
sensible thing to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: How long before the Government decides on the<br />
selection of judges or ex-judges on the judicial enquiry into Mr<br />
Justice Murphy?<br />
PM: Under the legislation that we brought in, that is to be<br />
decided by the resolution of the Houses. I am not going to go<br />
into public comment upon that before we get to the Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mlr Hawke, the key part of the opposition industrial<br />
relations policy is the ability to pursue industrial matters<br />
through the common law courts. Does your Government feel that is<br />
appropriate? PM: We have made it clear that we don't that is appropriate.<br />
And of course you have got the test. It is not just a question<br />
of concept, just look at it. Under our policies you have got the<br />
lowest level of industrial disputation that you have had in this<br />
country for 17 years. You have got return to the levels of<br />
profitability of the late sixties and early seventies. You have<br />
got a return to the highest, the best levels of international<br />
competitiveness for 15 years. So I don't have to be theoretical.<br />
Our policy works, theirs doesn't.<br />
