TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS COMPERRUCR, SASSY -OF AUSTRALIA, WASEINGTCH<br />
WASHIMGT t 27 JUNE<br />
E O R PROf lOF LY<br />
PM: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO<br />
GIVE A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION, I'LL DO THAT AND THEN I AM OPEN<br />
TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ADDRESS TO ME.<br />
FIRST THING OBVIOUSLY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, AND SAY WITH<br />
GREAT SINCERITY IS TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE AND THE GRATITUDE OF<br />
THE GOVERNMENT, AND I THINK THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA, FOR THE<br />
EXTREME GENEROSITY IN KIND, SPIRIT AND COMMUNICATION WHICH HAS<br />
BEEN EXTENDED TO ME, NOT ONLY BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED<br />
STATES, BUT BY THE ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY. IT IS A MARK OF<br />
THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. WE<br />
OBVIOUSLY HAVE COVERED IN OUR TALKS NOW A VERY WIDE RANGE OF<br />
MATTERS, BILATERAL, REGIONAL, LOCAL. GOING FIRST TO BILATERAL<br />
MATTERS, WITHOUT BEING EXHAUSTIVE ON THE SUBJECTS, CLEARLY AN<br />
IMPORTANT ISSUE HAS BEEN THE QUESTION OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE. I<br />
HAVE PUT STRONGLY TO THE PRESIDENT AND ALL RELEVANT MEMBERS OF<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION, THE CONCERN THAT I AND MY COUNTRY HAS<br />
ENTERTAINED, THAT TFR TIPAC' . USTRALIA POLIC__-OFTHE<br />
UNITED STATES-I-WTHIS AREA-I HAVE ADHERED TO THE COMMITMENT<br />
THAT I MADE BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA, THAT WHILE PUTTING OUR<br />
POSITION STRONGLY ON THIS ISSUE, I WAS NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO<br />
BE A HURDLE OVER WHICH WE CANNOT JUMP IN TERMS OF GETTING TO THE<br />
GREAT RANGE OF ISSUES ON WHICH WE HAVE AN IDENTITY OF INTEREST<br />
AND OVERWHELMINGLY AN IDENTITY OF POSITION. THE PRESIDENT AND<br />
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ftf( I. STRATION HAVE CONCEDED THE FACT THAT<br />
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN IMPACT, THAT WE HAVE THAT VIEW BUT WE<br />
IMPORTANTLY, BOTH OF US, RECOGNISE THAT THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO<br />
IS TO LOOK TO THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE. THAT HAS BEEN<br />
FACILITATED BY THE FACT THAT WHILE WE HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST<br />
LOOKING AT THE PERIOD AHEAD UNTIL THE END OF 1990, WE HAVE A<br />
CONJUNCTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MEANS IT IS PRODUCTIVE TO<br />
CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THE FUTURE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( PM CONT THOSE CONJUNCTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE THE FACT,<br />
FIRSTLY, THAT BECAUSE OF THE LOW LEVEL OF STOCK AND RELATIVELY<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF WHEAT PRICES, AUSTRALIA WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY<br />
AFFECTED IN THIS PERIOD UP UNTIL THE END OF 1990. WE BELIEVE AS<br />
IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND IT IS IN THAT PERIOD PRECISELY THAT<br />
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING TOGETHER WITHIN THE URUGUAY<br />
ROUND TO ACHIEVE A POSITION WHEREIN THE PRACTICE OF AGRICULTURAL<br />
SUPPORT AND EXPORT SUBSIDIES CAN BE REMOVED. IN PARTICULAR, LET<br />
ME SAY. THAT I AM VERY, VERY PLEASED INDEED AT THE POSITIVE<br />
RESPONSE THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME IN THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE MADE TO<br />
THE PRESIDENT, CLAYTON YEUTTER AND TO OTHERS WITH AN INTEREST AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA, AS TO WHAT WOULD BE, IN MY<br />
JUDGEMENT, AN APPROPRIATE WAY FOR THE UNITED STATES TO APPROACH<br />
THE ISSUE OF THE ROUND IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DEAL WITH THE<br />
PROPOSED 1990 FARM LEGISLATION. IN OTHER WORDS, I SPECIFICALLY<br />
SAID THAT THE NEGOTIATING POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE<br />
STRONGER IF, IN REGARD TO THAT LEGISLATION IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,<br />
AND THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES WAYS IN WHICH IT COULD BE DONE, THAT<br />
THEY TREATED THE PROVISION WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT IN THE EVENT OF<br />
A POSITIVE OUTCOME TO THE URUGUAY ROUND THEN THE PROVISIONS OF<br />
THE FARM LEGISLATION WOULD IN FACT NOT COME INTO EFFECT. I<br />
REGARDED THAT AS A CONSTRUCTIVE AND SENSIBLE SUGA'STION AND A<br />
PROMISE TO GIVE FAVOURABLE, CONSIDERATION TO IT.<br />
THE NEXT ITEM I WOULD MENTION OF COURSE, IS THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC<br />
INITIATIVE WHICH I BEGAN IN SEOUL IN JANUARY THIS YEAR AND I AM<br />
VERY PLEASED AT THE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE RESPONSE THAT I HAVE<br />
RECEIVED FROM THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER TO THIS<br />
INITIATIVE. YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT POSITIVE RESPONSE AND WE HAVE<br />
AGREED THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THE POST-ASEAN MINISTERIAL COUNCIL<br />
MEETING THAT WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT WE GET<br />
A CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE WITH A VIEW TO HAVING, AS I HAVE HOPED<br />
ALL ALONG, A MINISTERIAL LEVEL MEETING TO PROGRESS THIS ISSUE<br />
BEFORE THE END oF THE YEAR. WE HAVE OF COURSE, SPENT A GREAT<br />
DEAL OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE TRAGIC DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA AND<br />
AS YOU WOULD BY NOW BE AWARE, THERE IS A BASIC IDENTITY OF<br />
POSITION BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND MYSELF. THAT IDENTITY OF<br />
POSITION IS FOUNDED UPON THESE PROPOSITIONS: FIRSTLY, or COURSE,<br />
TUAT WE UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMNI AND DEPLORE THlE ACTION, NOT ONLY Or<br />
THE FOURTH OF JUNE, BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN, THE<br />
PERSECUTION, THE EXECUTION OF THE DISSIDENTS AND THOSE WHO HAVE<br />
PRESSED FOR REFORM4ING CHINA, AND THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO BE AT ONE IN THAT CONDEMNrATION. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM CONT WE ALSO AGREE THAT THE LOGIC OF THAT CONDEMNlATION LEADS<br />
YOU TO THE CONCLUSION INEVITABLY IN OUR JUDGEMENT THAT IT WOULD<br />
BE AGAINST THE I NTE REST OF THE PEOPLE OF CHINA GENERALLY, AND<br />
PARTICULARLY OF THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO PRESS FOR<br />
REFORM., IF THE OUTSIDE WORLD WERE TO CLOSE OFF CONTACTS WITH<br />
CHINA, D PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF ECONOMIC REFORM, TO REFUSE<br />
ANY FO OF ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD GIVE--IMPETUS TO THOSE PROCESSES<br />
OP' REFO . IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE STATEMENT WHICH<br />
dAE0 FROM THE 24 JUNE, AFTER THE OFFICIAL MEETINGS In CHINA<br />
THAT TM, SECOND POINT THAT THEY PUT OUT WAS A COMMITMENT TO<br />
PURSUE THE PROCESSES OF ECONOMIC REFORM AND OPENING TO THE<br />
OUTSIDE., WORLD. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS PRECISELY WITH THE<br />
PURSUIT, FURTHER PURSUIT, INTENSIFIED PURSUIT OF ECONOMIC REFORM<br />
AND OPENINGS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE MOST<br />
LIKELY TO BE CREATED IN WHICH THERE CAN BE SOME EFFECTIVE<br />
RESURRECTION OF THOSE PRESSURES FOR POLITICAL REFORM WITHIN<br />
CHINA. WE BOTH RECOGNISE THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT LINE TO WALK<br />
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE RIGHT LINE TO WALK.<br />
THE PRESIDENT WAS GOOD ENOUGH IN A SESSION WE HAD TODAY; I AM<br />
GOING TO GO TO ANOTHER ITEM; TO OUTLINE HIS POSITION IN REGARD TO<br />
THE SOVIET UNION. AGAIN, IT IS A DECISION THAT I TOTALLY SHARE<br />
WITH HIM AND THAT IS; THAT WE BOTH WELCOME UNRESERVEDLY, THE<br />
INITIATIVES OF PRESIDENT GORBACHEV TO PURSUE BOTH ECONOMIC AND<br />
POLITICAL REFORM WITHIN THE SOVIET UNION. A COMMITMENT ON THE<br />
PART OF PRESIDENT GORBACHEV WHICH FORTUNATELY HAS BEEN REFLECTED<br />
IN POSITIVE COMMITMENTS ON THE PART OF THE PRJESIDENT OF THE<br />
SOVIET UNION TO ASSIST IN THE ALLEVIATION OF POINTS OF TENSION IN<br />
VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE GLOBE. FOR EXAMPLE, NAMIBIA, ANGOLA,<br />
AFGHANISTAN, AND INDOCHINA. AND IT IS THE COMMITMENT OF<br />
PRESIDENT BUSH THAT WITH APPROPRIATE CAUTION HE WILL PURSUE<br />
CONSTRUCTIVELY, EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UPON THAT ATTITUDE AND<br />
THAT APPROACH OF PRESIDENT GORBACHEV. -AS I SAY, I AM AT ONE<br />
COMPLETELY WITH HIS ATTITUDE ON THIS ISSUE. WE SPENT SOME TIME<br />
ALSO TALKING ABOUT INDOCHINA. I WON'T GIVE AN ELABORATION ON<br />
THAT, IF YOU ARE INTEU. ETED-IN PRESSING QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT, I<br />
AM OF COURSE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO SO, AND I MAKE THE SAKE<br />
COMMENT ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. WE SPENT, NOT ONLY WITH THE<br />
PRESIDENT, BUT PARTICULARLY WITH SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER, A<br />
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST<br />
SITUATION IN GENERAL AND ABOUT THE TRAGEDY OF LEBANON IN<br />
PARTICULAR. </p>
<p>( PM CONT.) SO MY FRIENDS THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST<br />
OF THE SUBJECTS WE COVERED BUT SOME INDICATION OF THE RANGE OF<br />
ISSUES OF SHARED CONCERN TO US AND AT THIS POINT I AN THEREFORE<br />
OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS TO ME.<br />
JOURNALIST: 2 DID YOU HAVE ANY REPONSE TO YOUR PROPOSAL THAT THE<br />
LEGISLATION, THE FARM LEGISLATION WOULD BE CANCELLED OUT<br />
DEPENDING ON HOW THE URUGUAY ROUNDS TURNED OUT?<br />
PM: YES, I GOT A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION TO WHOM I SPOKE. POSITIVE IN THE SENSE THAT<br />
THEY, AND I COULDN'T SAY YES, THAT'S WHAT GOING TO HAPPEN AS THIS<br />
IS A MATTrER IN THE END FOR THE CONGRESS TO DECIDE, BUT WITH ALL<br />
THOSE TO WHOM I SPOKE SAW MERIT IN THE POSITION, BOTH<br />
INTRINSICALLY AS REPRESENTING A COINCIDENCE OF THEIR VIEWS ON<br />
THESE ISSUES, THAT IS THAT IT IS THEIR VIEW THAT THE MTN ROUND<br />
IDEALLY SHOULD PRODUCE A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS AN AGREEMENT TO<br />
MOVE TO AN ABANDONMENT OF SUPPORT AND EXPORT SUBSIDIES.<br />
THEREFORE, IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE WITHIN THE LEGISLATION<br />
INTERNALLY A POSITION WHICH CO-ENCODES WITH THAT INTENTION. AND<br />
SgCONDLY OF COURSE IN A BARGAINING POSITION YOU ARE STRENGTHENED<br />
IF, AS YOU GO INTO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH ARE GOING TO BE<br />
HARD, DETAILED AND SLOGGING BETWJEEN NOW AND THE END OF 1990, YOU<br />
HAVE AN INTERNAL POSITION WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE<br />
YOU ARE PUSHING IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. SO THERE IS A VERY<br />
POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE CONCEPT THAT I HAVE ADVANCED.<br />
JOURNALIST: WOULD IT BE ACCURATE TO CHARACTERISE YOUR TALKS AS<br />
SAYING THAT YOU AGREE TO DISAGREE ON ONE, THE ANTARCTIC, AND TWO,<br />
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO CAMBODIA?<br />
PM: I THINK THAT'S NOT AN UNF'AIR ANALYSIS# BUT I THINK I'D JUST<br />
LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO FLESH THAT OUT. ON THE ANTARCTIC, IT<br />
WAS CON VEYED) TO ME WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW, AND I SAY THIS WITHOUT<br />
ANY LABOURING OF THE ,4T FOR THOSE WHO INTERPRETED THE POSITION<br />
AS SOME SORT OF REBUFF TO ME, THAT I WAS NOT, IF I CAN PUT IT IN<br />
THE GENTLEST TERMS, UNAWARE OF WHAT THE UNITED STATES POSITION<br />
WAS BEFORE I CAME HERE. NEITHER WERE I OR MY GOVERNMENT UNAWAR~ E,<br />
WHEN WE MADE THE DECISION WE DID, OF WHAT THE POSITION OF TIM<br />
UNITED STATES WAS. IF THERE WAS ANY REBUFF INVOLVED IT WAS A<br />
REBUFF BY AUSTRALIA TO THE UNITED STATES' POSITION BY ADOPTING<br />
THE POSITION WE DID ON THIS ISSUE. ONE WOULD THINK AS A<br />
FACT OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY TO MAKE THE POINT. NOW HAVING SAID<br />
THAT, WE THEN PUT TO THE PRESIDENT AND THEN To THE ADMINISTRATION<br />
THE REASON WHICH LIES BEHIND AT HAVING ARRIVED AT THAT POSITION. </p>
<p>( PM CONT) LET ME SAY THAT THERE WASN'T ANY REPUDIATION BY THE<br />
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE ELSE Or THE INTEGRITY, IF YOU LIKE FROM OUR<br />
POINT OF VIEW THE LOGIC OF WHAT WE WERE DOING. THEY,<br />
NEVERTHELESS, HAVE A DIFFERENT POSITION. WE HAVE AGREED~ THAT IN<br />
THE PERIOD LEADING UP TO THE TREATY MEETING IN OCTOBER THAT WE<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO STAY IN CONTACT ON THIS ISSUE. NOW THAT DOESN'T<br />
MEAN, AND I AM NOT IMPLYING, THAT AS A RESULT OF THOSE<br />
DISCUSSIONS WE WILL BECOME THE SAME ON THIS POSITION. WHAT I AM<br />
TRYING TO LEAVE WITH YOU IS THAT THIS IS NOT A POSITION OF<br />
CONFLICT, PROGRESSIVE CONFLICT BETWEEN US. THERE IS A<br />
RECOGNITION ON EACH SIDE OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE OTHER'S POINT OF<br />
VIEW. THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE ON THIS ISSUE.<br />
9 I JUST WANTED TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT AS FAR AS AUSTRALIA IS<br />
CONCERNED WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR POSITION STRONGLY<br />
AROUND THE WORLD. NOW IN REGARD TO THE SECOND PART OF YOUR<br />
QUESTION. THIS QUESTION oF THE PROVISION OF LETHAL AID TO THE<br />
RON-KHMER ROUGE ELEMENTS OF THE COALITION. YES, IT WAS PUT TO<br />
US, WITHOUT GOING TO ALL THE DETAILS OF OUR CONVERSATION, I CAN<br />
CONVEY ESSENTIALLY THIS POSITION, I PUT TO THE PRESIDENT AND HIS<br />
COLLEAGUES, IT WAS OUR JUDGEMENT THAT THERE WAS SO MANY POSITIVE<br />
ELEMENTS STILL ON THE TABLE IN REGARD TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF AN<br />
ACCEPTrABLE OUTCOME IN INDOCHINA THAT, IN OUR JUDGEMENT, IT WAS<br />
NOT APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE LETHAL AID. WHAT DO I MEAN BY So MANY<br />
ELEMENTS ON THE TABLE? LET ME BRIEFLY REFER TO THEM. THERE IS<br />
OF COURSE, THE ASEAN SPONSORED JIM 1 JIM 11 PROCESSES. THERE IS<br />
SUPERIMPOSED TO SOME EXTEN4T UPON THAT THE INITIATIVES OF PRIME<br />
MINISTER SI'ITHI OF THAILAND. THERE IS THE DISCUSSIONS, THE--<br />
BACKGROUND DISCUSSIONS OBVIOUSLY INVOLVED, THE ATTITUDE OF THE<br />
SOVIET UNION AND VIETNAM IN THE NATURE OF SOM4E RESOLUTION OF THE<br />
CONFLICT IN THE AREA. THERE IS NOW THE UPCOMING ROUND TABLE AND<br />
THEN THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN PARIS COMMhENCING AT THE END<br />
OF NEXT MONTH. OUT OF ALL THOSE STRANDS, IT IS OUR JUDGEMENT<br />
THAT THERE IS SO MANY POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH JUSTIFY A GUARDEDLY<br />
OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION<br />
THAT OUR JUDGEME. NT T-IS BETTER NOT TO INJECT THE ELEMENT<br />
OF LETHAL AID.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE, YOU SAID EARLIER THAT THE PRESIDENT<br />
CONCEDED THAT THE FARM TRADE PROGRAM HAD DONE HARM TO AUSTRALIA<br />
COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: NOW LET ME PUT IT ACCURATELY. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT<br />
THERE WAS A CONCESSION BY THOSE TO WHOM WE SPOKE THAT THER MAY<br />
HAVE BEEN, MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGE. THEY DIDN'T REPUDIATE THAT WE<br />
WERE ENTITLED TO FEEL THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME DAMAGE. THEY<br />
DIDN'T SAY, YES, THAT HAS HAPPENED, THIS IS THE AMOUNT. BUT THEY<br />
DID NOT REJECT THE POSITION THAT, FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, WE MAY<br />
ASSESS THERE HAS BEEN DAMAGE DONE.<br />
JOURNALIST. WAS THIS THE PRESIDENT'S?<br />
PM; WELL, THIS WAS IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENT AND MR YEUTTER AND<br />
OTHERS TO WHOM WE SPOKE. NOW, I AM NOT TRYING TO MAKE A GREAT<br />
DEAL OUT OF THAT TO SAY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM SOME OTHER<br />
POSITION. I AM SIMPLY SAYING THAT, IN TERMS OF THE APPROACH WE<br />
MADE, WE DIDN'T TRY AND HAMMER THIS ISSUE AND SAY THAT'S THE<br />
FIGURES. WE GAVE AN INDICATION OF THE SORT OF DAM4AGE WE THOUGH4T<br />
HAD BEEN DONE. BUT BECAUSE, AS I SAY, IN THE PERIOD AHEAD UP<br />
UNTIL THE END OF 1.990, WE DON'T HAVE THE APPREHENSION OF A<br />
SIMILAR SORT OF DAMAGE. WHAT MY MAJOR CONCERN IS AS I HAVE SAID,<br />
IS TO SAY, HOW DO WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE NOW, BOTH IN TERMS OF<br />
INTERNAL DECISION MAKING IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR JOINT<br />
APPROACH IN THE MTN ROUND. HOW DO WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE NOW TO<br />
TRY AND GET THE OUTCOME WE BOTH WANT.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE, IN HIS SPEECH LAST NIGHT TO THE ASIA<br />
SOCIETY, SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER INDICATED THAT HE SAW THREE<br />
PRINCIPLES BEING NECESSARY TO BE INCLUDED IN A REGIONAL<br />
COOPERATIVE ENTITY. THOSE PRINCIPLES SEEM TO GO QUITE A BIT<br />
FURTHER THAN WHAT YOU WERE SAYING IN PROPOSING FOR THAT REGIONAL<br />
ENTITY. WHAT' S YOUR REACTION TO THAT, WILL YOU EMBRACE THEM?<br />
PM: THE IMPORTANT THING FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, JEFF, IS THAT<br />
THE SECRETARY OF STATE REFLECTING THE POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT<br />
EMBRACES THE CONCEP% TMT WE -HAVE ADVANCED, AND HAS INDICATED HIS<br />
INTENTION TO WORK WITH US TO ADVANCE THE CONCEPT. IN DISCUSSIONS<br />
WE HAVE HAD TODAY WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT<br />
WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE ON THE TABLE FOR CONSIDERATION. I DON'T<br />
FEEL ANY DISQUIET ABOUT HAVING ALL THE ELEMENTS ON THE TABLE THAT<br />
HE, OR FOR THAT MATrER, ANYONE OF THE OTHER PARTIES WHO WILL BE<br />
INVOLVED IN THIS WANT TO PUT ON* THE TABLE.* THE IMPORTANT THING<br />
IS THAT THERE IS AGREEMENT ON MY CONCEPT THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR<br />
A CONFERENCE TO ADVANCE THE PRINCIPAL OF GREATER COOPERATION.<br />
SECONDLY THAT THERE IS A NEED TO HAVE SOME ONGOING MECHANISM To<br />
ENSURE THAT THIS 1S NOT MERELY SOME AD HOC MEETING THAT SAYS YES,<br />
WE NEED TO COOPERATE MORE AND THEN LEAVE IT AT THAT. </p>
<p>( PM CONT) WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF A MECHANISM NOW. ON<br />
THE ISSUE OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE GROUP AS TO THE ELEMENTS<br />
THAT IT WOULD NEED TO DEAL WITH~ n ALL THOSE IN MY JUDGEMENT ARE<br />
PROPERLYr ON THE TABLE. I THINK THE ONE ISSUE THAT I WOULD LIKE<br />
TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT ESSENTIALLY, ESSENTIALLY, THIS MUST BE AN<br />
ECONOMIC ORIENTED BODY. AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THE ASEAN<br />
GROUP PROPERLY REGARD THEIR INSTITUTION AS THE MAJOR POLITICAL<br />
INSTITUTION FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE CORE COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
REGION. AND, UNDERSTANDABLY, THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE<br />
EMERGENCE OF ANOTHER, AS IT WERE, POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE<br />
ORGANISATION IN A POLITICAL SENSE, AND I UNDERSTAND THOSE<br />
SENSITIVITIES. JOURNALIST: AUSTRALIA, AT THE GATT MEETING IN MONTREAL, SAID THAT<br />
IT WAS GOING TO WORK OUT ITS OWN LONG-TERM GRAIN AGREEMENT WITH<br />
THE SOVIET UNION. ARE YOU MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION?<br />
PM; WELL, WE HAVE, FOR SOME TIME NOW, BEEN ENGAGED IN NOT JUST<br />
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT GRAIN. THE SOVIET UNION WANTED TO TALK TO US<br />
ABOUT A FISHING AGREEMENT. WE SAID WE WERE PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT<br />
THE FISHERIES AGREEMIENT, BUT NOT ALONE. WE WANTED TO LOOK AT<br />
BROADER ISSUES, INCLUDING THEIR GRAINS, AND DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN<br />
GOING ON WITH THEM W ITH IN THAT GENERAL FRAMEWORK. OF COURSE, WHAT<br />
WE MAY OR MAY NOT DO, IN THAT OR OTHER BILATERAL AREAS, WILL TO<br />
SOME EXTENT OBVIOUSLY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF THE<br />
MULTILATERAL ROUND.<br />
JOURNALIST: ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITHIN THE<br />
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION OVER THE EFFECTS OF P. E. T. ON AUSTRALIA,<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, BETWEN VICE-PRESIDENT QUAYLE AND SECRETARY YEUTTER<br />
PM; IF I WERE AWARE OF IT, I WOULDN'T REGARD IT AS HELPFUL OR<br />
DIPLOMATIC TO EXPOUND ON IT.<br />
JOURNALIST; DID YOU RECEIVE ANY ENCOURAGING MESSAGES OR WORDS<br />
REGARDING STEEL DURING THE VISIT?<br />
PM; YES, I HAD A DISCUSSION BRIEFLY LAST NIGHT WITH SPECIAL TRADE<br />
REPRESENTATIVE CARLA HILLS ON THIS, AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT I SAID<br />
TO HER WAS THIS: THAT OUR ' IRA, AS YOU KNOW, EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER<br />
OF THIS YEAR. I MADE THE POINT TO HER THAT OUR STEEL INDUSTRY IS<br />
CHARACTERISED BY THESE THREE FEATURES. ONE, THAT IT' S PRIVATELY<br />
OWNED. TWO, THAT IT'S NON-SUBSIDISED. </p>
<p>-a-<br />
( PH CONT) AND THREE, THAT IT'S OPEN, WITHIN A RELATIVELY SMALL<br />
TARIFF TO THE ORDER OF 9 OR 1.0 PER CENT, TO FOREIGN COMPETITION.<br />
AND THAT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIATED IT FROM OTHER STEEL INDUSTRIES<br />
AROUND THE WORLD, AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS APPROPRIATE<br />
THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT. SHE DID<br />
NOT RESIST THE LOGIC OF THAT POSITION, AND SAID SHE WOULD TAKE IT<br />
INTO ACCOUNT. I ALSO INDICATED TO HER THAT<br />
WE WERE QUITE HAPPY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S EXPRESSED CONCERN AT<br />
THE QUESTION OF TRADING PRACTICES WITHIN THE WORLD STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY, THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE<br />
MULTILATERAL FRAMEWORK.<br />
JOURNALIST: WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE UNITED STATES AS AN EQUAL<br />
PARTNER IN ANY PACIFIC FORUM, OR DO YOU ACCEPT THAT ONCE IN THEY<br />
WOULD BECOM4E A PROMINENT PLAY?<br />
PM: OH, THE INITIATIVE. THEY ARE AN EQUAL PARTNER. I DON'T KNOW<br />
WHETHER THAT QUESTION, TO SOME EXTENT, GOES BACK TO AN<br />
APPREHENSION THAT WE HAD, IN THE BEGINNING, SOUGHT TO<br />
DIFFERENTIALLY TREAT THE UNITED STATES. THERE WAS NEVER ANY BASIS<br />
FOR THAT, AND THAT'S ACCEPTED BY M4Y FRIENDS HERE IN THE<br />
ADMINISTRATION. WE SIMPLY, WHEN I ADVANCED THE IDEA IN SEOUL IN<br />
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT WITHIN SOME<br />
OF THE OBVIOUSLY CORE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, THERE MAY HAVE<br />
BEEN SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE EQUAL RELEVANCE OF THE CONCE. PT OF<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. BECAUSE WE WERE AWARE THERE WAS A<br />
POSSIBILITY OF THAT ATTITUDEr WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE,<br />
IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO TALK TO THOSE CORE COUNTRIES. WHEN I TALK<br />
ABOUT CORE COUNTRIES, I AM OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT TEN.* THESE ARE<br />
THE SIX ASEAN COUNTRIES, PLUS AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN AND<br />
KOREA. I WAS PLEASED, AS I SENT MY REPRESENTATIVE AROUND THESE<br />
CORE COUNTRIES, THAT THE OVERWHELMING VIEW WAS THAT FROM THE2<br />
BEGINNING, IT WAS A! P7R5? IATE FOR UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO BE<br />
IN, THAT WAS OUR POSITION. IT WAS ONE THAT OVERWHELMINGLY WAS<br />
ACCEPTED. AND NOW THAT IS A CONSENSUS POSITION. SO THAT MEANS<br />
THAT AS WE PROCEED NOW, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE TOTALLY AN<br />
EQUAL PARTNER FROM THE BEGINNING.<br />
JOURNALIST: IS THERE A DIFFERENCE OF VIEW AT THIS POINT BETWEEN<br />
THE AND AUSTRALIA UPON WHETHER THE WAY SHOULD BE LEFT OPEN<br />
TO INCLUDE CHINA IN THE PACIFIC REGIONAL GROUP AND, IN<br />
PARTICULAR, THAT THE OPTION INCLUDING CHINA SHOULD NOT BE CLOSED<br />
OFF BY UNITING HONG KONG AND TAIWAN BEFORE THE ISSUE OF CHINA'S<br />
HM ERSHIP IS RESOLVED? </p>
<p>PM: I THINK IT IS FAIR ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THERE IS AN IDENTITY<br />
OF VIEW: ULTIMATELY YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT AN ASIAN PACIFIC<br />
ECONOMIC COOPERATION GROUP WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF CHINA. BUT I<br />
THINK EQUALLY THERE IS A VIEW THAT IN TERMS OF THIS YEAR, THE<br />
INVOLVEMENT OF CHINA IS UNLIKELY. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
US THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE TAIWAN IN WITHOUT CHINA. YOU CAN'T SAY<br />
BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT A PROBLEM WITH CHINA, WE WILL NOW HAVE TAIWAN<br />
IN. THERE IS No DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US ON THAT.<br />
JOURNALIST: WELL WHAT IS THE POSITION7<br />
PM: WELL SIMPLY THAT WE WOULD NOT BE HAVING TAIWAN IN THE<br />
ABSENCE OF CHINA. YOU SEE, THE POSITION THAT HAD BEEN REACHED<br />
BEFORE JUNE FOUR WAS THAT THERE WAS A CLEAR VIEW HAD EMERGED, AS<br />
MR WOOLCOTT WENT AROUND THE REGION, THAT IT MADE SENSE FOR CHINA<br />
TO BE IN. AS YOU KNOW, MIR WOOLCOTT, ON MY BEHALF, WENT TO CHINA,<br />
HE SAW PREMIER LI PENG, IN FACT, TRAGICALLY, JUST A MATTER OF<br />
HOURS BEFORE THE DECISIONS WERE TAKEN THERE AND THE ATITUDE OF<br />
PREMIER LI PENG WAS THAT A) THEY WANTED TO BE IN; AND B) THEY<br />
BELIEVED, AND I PUT THIS IN SHORTHAND TERMS, THAT PROCESSES WERE<br />
AVAILABLE WHEREBY TAIWAN AND) HONG KONG WOULD BE ABLE TO BE<br />
ACCOMMODATED. NOW OF COURSE WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH NOW IS A<br />
QUITE DIFFERENT SITUATION. BECAUSE REALISTICALLY WE CAN SEE<br />
THAT CHINA AT THIS STAGE, AND IN FACT I WOULD THINK ALL THE<br />
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN VISITED BY MR WOOLCOTT IN THAT PRE JUNE<br />
FOUR SITUATION, WOULD BE ADJUSTING THEIR IMMEDIATE POSITION-IN<br />
LIGHT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE. BUT LOOKING DOWN THE TRACK, I<br />
THINK IT IS A GENERAL VIEW PARTICULARLY THAT THE MORE CHINA MOVES<br />
TO REFORM ITS ECONOM4Y THE MORE ANY ASIAN PACIFIC ECONOMIC<br />
REGIONAL GROUPING WOULD NEED TO INCLUDE CHINA.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR PRIME MINISTER THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE PUBLIC<br />
DISCUSSION OF ANZUS HERE IN WASHINGTON. I WONDER, DOES AUSTRALIA<br />
CONTINUE TO SUPPOMTANMR I A S NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY NUCLEAR<br />
POLICY? DO YOU NEED THAT POLICY FOR DOMESTIC REASONS AND DO YOU<br />
THINK THE U. S. SHOULD MODIFY ITS POSITION TOWARDS NOT MEETING<br />
WITH SENIOR NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS?<br />
PM: WELL, THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, MAY I SAY WITH RESPECT,<br />
IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS IN TERMS OF PRACTICE. </p>
<p>( PM CONT) WE HAVE LIVED NOW, COMFORTABLY, WITH UNITED STATES<br />
POLICY, AND WE TAKE A VERY SIMPLE AND, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, A<br />
GLARINGLY OBVIOUS VIEW THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP<br />
AS WE DO, AND HAVE HAD NOW FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS WITH THE UNITED<br />
STATES, THEN YOU CAN'T HAVE AN ERSATZ RELATIONSHIP AND SAY, HERE<br />
MATE WE ARE ALLIES, BUT DON'T BRING YOUR BLOODY SHIPS IN. IT<br />
DOESN'T MAKE VERY MUCH SENSE. AND WE HAVE OPERATED ON THAT<br />
BASIS. NOW YOU ADVANCE, UNDERSTANDABLY, THE QUESTION OF NEW<br />
ZEALAND. AND OUR POSITION HAS BEEN EQUALLY AS CLEAR FROM THE<br />
BEGINNING. WE THINK THAT NEW ZEALAND IS WRONG IN ITS POSITION.<br />
WE RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO BE WRONG AND WITH THE FULL<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE CONTINUED A DEFENCE<br />
RELATIONSHIP IN THE BILATERAL SENSE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND NEW<br />
ZEALAND. 9<br />
NOW AS TO HOW THE UNITED STATES CONDUCTS ITS RELATIONS WITH NEW<br />
ZEALAND, I MERELY WANT TO SAY TWO THINGS. FIRSTLY, WE HAVE SAID<br />
P'ROM THE BEGINNING TO THE UNITED STATES, WHO OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY<br />
CONSIDERABLY OFFENDED BY THE DECISION OF NEW ZEALAND, THAT WE<br />
DIDN'T WANT THE UNITED STATES TO PUNISH NEW ZEALAND IN ANY<br />
ECONOMIC SENSE FOR THE DECISION THAT NEW ZEALAND HAD TAK( EN. WE<br />
THOUGHT THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. AND TO THE GREAT CREDIT OF THE<br />
UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WHO HAVE TAKEN THE<br />
VIEW THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION, IT HASN'T<br />
BEEN A COURSE OF ACTION THAT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED, AND WE THOROUGHLY<br />
ENDORSE THAT ATTITUDE OF THE UNITED STATES.* AS TO HOW T HEY<br />
CONDUCT THEMSELVES, AS TO WHETHER THEY MEET MINISTERS OR NOT,<br />
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A MATTER FOR DECISION BY THE UNITED STATES.<br />
JOURNALIST: HOW IMPECCABLY HAVE WE OBSERVED OUR OBLIGATIONS<br />
IN ANZUS, DO YOU FEEL LET DOWN BY THE FACT THAT THE BUSH<br />
ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING THE SAME ATTITUDE AS THE REAGAN<br />
ADMINISTRATION IN REFUSING TO SIGN THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE<br />
RARATONGA TREATY? as<br />
PM: WELL THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THEM ON<br />
THIS VISIT, MILTON. I HAVE PUT VERY STRONGLY TO THEM THAT WE<br />
THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE THEY SHOULD CHANGE THEIR POSITION. LET<br />
ME JUST SPEND A MINUTE ELABORATING ON THAT. THE INTERESTING<br />
POINT TO NOTICE, FIRSTLY, IS THAT THE UNITED STATES' PREVIOUS<br />
ADMINISTRATION AND THIS ONE HAVE NOT, AT ANY POINT, QUESTIONED<br />
THE INTEGRITY OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE DEALT WITH THIS IN TERMS OF<br />
THE NON-IMPINGEMENT OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE TREATY<br />
UPON OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ANZUS. THEY HAVEN'T QUESTIONED THAT. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
( PM CONT) THEIR CONCERN, RATHER, HAS BEEN THE POSSIBLE IM4PACT OF<br />
THEM BECOMING SIGNATORIES TO THE PROTOCOLS, THE POSSIBLE IMPACT<br />
OF THAT IN OTHER PARTS 0F THE WORLD, PERHAPS JAPAN AND NORTHERN<br />
EUROPE. NOW, WE HAVE TAKEN THE VIEW THAT THIS IS NOT A<br />
COMPELLING REASON AND I HAVE REPEATED THAT ON THIS VISIT. BUT I<br />
HAVE ALSO SAID THAT WE ARE LOOKING-AT A SOUTH PACIFIC REGION<br />
WHICH NOW, AS WE COME TO THE END OF THE 1980' S, IS CONSIDERABLY<br />
LESS STABLE THAN IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE 19801S. OUR<br />
COLLEAGUES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM SEE A SITUATION IN WHICH<br />
CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION ADHERE TO THE PROTOCOLS, BUT A<br />
SITUATION IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM AND FRANCE<br />
HAVE NOT. AND THEY MAKE THEIR JUDGMENTS ABOUT THAT POSITION. I<br />
HAVE SAID TO MY FRIENDS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT I THINK,<br />
IN MY JUDGEMENT, THAT IT IS AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED<br />
STATES TO FOLLOW THIS COURSE OF ACTION AND PRODUCE AN ADVERSE<br />
RELATIVE JUDGEMENT BY THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION AGAINST THE<br />
UNITED STATES. I HAVE PUT THAT POSITION STRONGLY, AND ALL I CAN<br />
SAY IS THAT THEY HAVE LISTENED TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY AND HAVE<br />
SAID THAT THEY WILL HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR POSITION. BUT THEY<br />
HAVE SAID THAT WITHOUT ANY COMMITMENT THAT THEY WILL CHANGE, BUT<br />
THEY HAVE AGREED TO HAVE A FURTHER LOOK AT IT.<br />
JOURNALIST; YOU SAID TO PRESIDENT BUSH TODAY THAT IT HAD BEEN<br />
YEARS SINCE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAD VISITED AUSTRALIA. DO YOU<br />
THINK THIS IS A SIGN THAT THE AMERICANS EITHER TAKE US FOR<br />
GRANTED, OR DON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY? DID YOU DISCUSS WITH<br />
PRESIDENT BUSH TODAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT HIM COMING TO<br />
AUSTRALIA? PM; I THINK I SAID 23.<br />
JOURNALIST: YOU SAID OVER 23 YEARS EITHER TAKE US FOR<br />
GRANTED OR DON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY AND DID YOU DISCUSS WITH<br />
PRESIDENT BUSH TODAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT HIM COMING TO<br />
AUSTRALIA. 40<br />
PM: I DON'T THINK IT IS THAT IT CAN SUSTAIN THE CONCLUSION TO<br />
TAKE US FOR GRANITED. I MEAN WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO FACE IS THE<br />
SIMPLE FACT, AND I HAVE NEVER AVOIDED IT, THAT THE UNITED STATES<br />
IS A GLOBAL POWER, WITH GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND WITHIN THAT,<br />
WHILE WE ARE AMONGST THE STAUNCHEST OF THEIR ALLIES, WE, THE<br />
POPULATION OF SOME NEARLY 17 MILLION PEOPLE, DON'T LOOM AS LARGE<br />
IN ECONOMIC TERMS AS OTHERS. I DON' T FEEL ANY SENSE AT ALL FROM<br />
THAT FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED. AND ALL THE<br />
EVIDENCE, SURELY, OF THIS VISIT AND THE PREVIOUS VISITS I HAVE<br />
MADE HERE, WOULD REPUDIATE SUCH A SUGGESTION. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
( PM COI4T) WE GET FAR BETTER TREATMENT THAN A COUNTRY WHICH IS<br />
TAK9N FOR GRANTED. HOWEVER I HAVE SAID IT WOULD BE, I THINK,<br />
VERY GOOD FOR THE RELATIONSHIP, FOR THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA AND<br />
THE UNITED STATES, IF THE PRESIDENT WERE TO COME AND, IN THAT<br />
SENSE, I HAVE DISCUSSED THE MATTER IN SOME DETAIL WITH HIM AND<br />
THE POSITION IS THIS, PUT SIMPLY, THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS<br />
EXPRESSED AN UNEQUIVOCAL DESIRE TO COME TO AUSTRALIA AND HIS<br />
PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE EXAMINED TO SEE WHEN THAT IS POSSIBLE.<br />
BEYOND THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. OVER TO YOU.<br />
JOURNALIST; DID SUGAR COME UP IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS, YOUR<br />
COMPLAINT AGAINST THE WHAT WERE THE RESULTS FOR THOSE<br />
DISCUSSIONS, WHY DID YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAD TO RAISE THAT OUTSIDE<br />
THE URUGUAY ROUND?<br />
PM: 014, WELL YOU HAVE GOT A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE JUST<br />
RECENTLY HAD A GATT DECISION WHICH HAS SUPPORTED THE ACTION WHIC1F<br />
WE TOOK. AND I SIMPLY RAISED THAT WITH THE RELEVANT MEMBERS OF<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION. THEY ACCEPTED THE FACT OF THE DECISION IN<br />
THE OF COURSE, IT WAS OPEN TO US TO INSIST UPON A<br />
BILATERAL RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER NOW. THEY EXPRESSED THE VIEW<br />
THAT THE COURT COULD BE SETTLED WITHIN THE MULTILATERAL FRAMEWOER<br />
WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT TO USE THAT AS A BUYING OFF PROCESS,<br />
ACCEPTING THE OBLIGATION WHICH IS UPON THEM AS A RESULT OF THE<br />
GATT DECISION, AND THAT IS HOW IT HAS BEEN AMICABLY LEFT. IT WILL<br />
BE A MATTER FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION BETWEEN OUR OFFICIALS.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID YOU OR K. IM BRAZLEY DISCUSS THE GROWTH OF INDIAN<br />
MILITARY POWER AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF THE<br />
INDIAN ICBM PROGRAM NOT THE IRBM PROGRAM?<br />
PM: INDIA DID COME UP RECENTLY IN THE DISCUSSION AND I WAS ASKED<br />
FOR MY IDEA ABOUT THE RELEVANCE THERE. I DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY<br />
TO THAT DEVELOPMENT. RATHER, THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN TERMS OF~<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP REGION AND THE BUILD UP OF ITS ARMED<br />
CAPACITIES. </p>
<p>1 1, -13-<br />
( PM CONT) I EXPRESSED THE VIEW TO THE PRESIDENT AND M BAKER,<br />
FLWING FROM THE DISCUSSIONS I HAVE HAD WITH MY FRIEND RAJIV<br />
OHANDI IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR THEY WERE LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS<br />
THAT AS IT WAS PUT TO ME BY PRIME-~ MINISTER GHANDI WHO HAD A VERY<br />
FRUITFUL, AS HE SAW IT, VISIT TO CHINA AND HE THAT NOT ONLY THE<br />
OF THE VISIT BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE MECHANISMS<br />
THAT HAD BEEN SET IN PLACE AS A RESULT OF THAT VISIT TO TRY AND<br />
ACHIEVE A RESOLUTION OF THEIR BORDER DISPUTE, WAS SUCH AS TO<br />
LEAVE HIM, PRIME MINISTER GHANDI, AN OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENT OF<br />
FUTURE RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND INDIA. SIMILARLY, HE TOLD ME<br />
THAT HE HAD ESTABLISHED VERY GOOD, HE THOUGHT, FRIENDLY,<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH PRIME MINISTER BENEZIR BHUTT'O OF<br />
PAKISTAN. AND HE PARTICULARLY THOUGHT THAT AFTER THE NEXT INDIAN<br />
ELECTIONS, TO BE HELD THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR, THERE WAS<br />
THE OPPORTUNITY POR A CONSTRUCTIVE RESOLUTION OF THEIR BORDER<br />
PROBLEMS. HIS OVERALL ASSESSMENT THEREFORE, FLOWING FROM THE<br />
CONCLUSION VIS A VIS CHINA AND PAKISTAN, WAS THAT INDIA WOULD BE<br />
IN A POSITION TO REDUCE ITS MILITARY EXPENDITURE AND POSTURE.<br />
NOW THESE DAYS, ON SO MANY ISSUES, THAT WAS PRE JUNE THE FOURTH.<br />
PRE TIANANMEN SQUARE. HOW PAR THOSE EVENTS ARE GOING TO CAUSE A<br />
REASSESSMENT BY PRIME MINISTER GHANDI AS TO THE CONFIDENCE HE MAY<br />
HAVE ABOUT FUTURE RELATIONS IS A POINT ABOUT WHICH I CAN'T SPEAK<br />
WITH AUTHORITY. BUT IF THAT IS NOT A COMPLICATING FACTOR, THEN I<br />
HAVE THE FEELING FROM THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH RAJIV GHANDI<br />
THAT WE CAN EXPECT SOME RELEVANT *..,( INAUDIBLE)... AND TO A<br />
FURTHER POINT I MADE WAS THAT IN THE DISCUSSIONS I HAVE HAD WITH<br />
PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO AND PRIME MINISTER OHANDI, I HAD SAID THESE<br />
THINGS.* FIRSTLY, THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE REGULAR ANNUAL<br />
BASIS OF CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN US ON DEFENCE ISSUES.-THEY HAVE<br />
AGREED TO THAT SO WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION WHERE WE ARE GOING TO<br />
BE ABLE TO STAY REGULARLY IN TOUCH WITH THEM ON THEIR THINKING IN<br />
THESE MATTERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I SAID TO THEM BOTH, THAT WE<br />
WERE CONCERNED FRQL-. MREIONAL POINT OF VIEW ABOUT THE POTENTIAL<br />
ESCALATION OF NUCLEAR CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM AND SUGGESTED<br />
POSSIBLE MEASURES WHICH COULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF TENSION IN<br />
THAT AREA. AND WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BECOME PARTNERS TO THE NPT<br />
TREATY AND WHETHER THEY WILL OR NOT I DON ' T KNOW BUT I HAVE GIVEN<br />
THE UNDERTAKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION HERE THAT WE WILL, FROM<br />
AUSTRALIA, CONTINUE TO PRESS THAT POSITION WITH THEM. </p>
<p>-14-.<br />
JOURNALISTt PRIME MINISTER, THIS MORNING PRESIDEN4T BUSH USED TI<br />
WORD UNIQUE TO DESCRIBED AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.<br />
HAS THAT LED TO DISCUSSION ON ANY PARTICULAR ROLE AUSTRALIA MIGF<br />
PLAY AND SECONDLY, HOW USEFUL DO YtOU THINK YOUR PARTICULAR<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA HAS BEEN DURING TALKS WITH THE AI4ERICANSE<br />
PM: WELL, NO PARTICULAR INITIATIVE HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BUT THE<br />
PRESIDENT WAS KIND ENOUGH AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY TO<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO<br />
COUNTRIES. THE STRENGTH OF THAT RELATIONSHIP rA~ INDICATED BY<br />
THE FACT THAT THE CHINESE THEMSELVES RECENTLY SAÃ± D WELL AT THE<br />
END OF LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS THAT NOT ONLY IN RELATIVE<br />
TERMS, BUT IN ABSOLUTE TERMS, THERE WAS A GREATER LEVEL OF<br />
MINISTERIAL INTERCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA THAN BETWEEZ<br />
CHINA AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY. WHICH IS A REFLECTION OF THE PACT<br />
THAT EARLY IN THE PIECE THERE WAS A RECOGNITION BY PRIME MINISTEI<br />
WHITLAM, THAT CHINA, AND TO THE CREDIT OF PRIME MINISTER FRASER,<br />
THAT WAS CONTINUED AND CERTAINLY HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED UNDER MY<br />
PRIME MINISTERSHIPS. SO THERE IS No DOUBT ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS 01<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP BUT IT DIDN'T FLOW FROM THAT ANY SUGGESTION<br />
ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY PARTICULAR INITIATIVE. BUT, GOING<br />
TO THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION, THE PRESIDENT AND MR BAKER<br />
WERE INTERESTED FROM THE BASIS OF THAT PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE THAT<br />
WE HAVE OF CHINA AND THEIR LEADERS, AND OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH<br />
THEM-TO TRY AND GET OUR ASSESSMENT OF HOW WE THOUGHT FUTURE<br />
DREVEL OPMENTS WOULD TAKE PLACE. AND WHILE THERE IS, AS I SAY NO<br />
SUGGESTION OF ANY PARTICULAR INITIATIVE, WE HAVE AGREED TO STAY<br />
IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION ON THIS ISSUE AND TO SHARE EXPERIENCE,<br />
KNOWLEDGE AND VIEWS IN THE HOPE THAT BY SUCH SHARING WE MAY BE<br />
ABLE, WITH OTHERS, TO HAVE INFLUENCE, BENIGN INFLUENCE UPON THE<br />
DIRECTION OF THE FUT URE POLICY WITHIN THAT COUNTRY.<br />
JOURNALIST; BACK' 0R TO GATT DID YOU RAISE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC<br />
PROPOSAL. S WITH THE PRESIDENT AS TO HOW THE U. S. COULD HELP STEER<br />
THE GATT NEGOTIATIONS TO A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME, AND THE SECOND<br />
QUESTION BACK ON CHINESE SANCTIONS. DID YOU ALSO RAISE THE<br />
QUESTION OF THE AUSSAT SATELLITE WHICH OF COURSE GOT CAUGHT UP IN<br />
THE U. S. SANCTIONS ON THE FORTIFIED TECHNOLOGY?<br />
PM: YES. WELL THAT AGAIN, NO REALLY TWO THINGS. THE SPECIFICS<br />
THAT I HAVE TAL = E ABOUT AS TO APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION IN<br />
REGARD TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY APPROACH THE. 1990 FARM BILL. </p>
<p>-Is-<br />
( PM CONT) SECOND) LY, JUST A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ABSOLIMUTERGEkiC<br />
AND FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF ATTEMPTING TO GET A POSITIVE<br />
OUTCOME FROM THE GATT NEGOTIATIONS.* WE ARE AT ONE ABOUT THAT.<br />
MEAN, THIS IS NOT SOME MERE FORMAL LIP SERV ICE WE ARE PAYING T<br />
THESE PROCESSES. WE HAVE AGREED THAT WE NEED To APPLY OUR VERY<br />
BEST ENDEAVOURS INDIVIDUALLY, AND IN OUR CASE, WITHIN THE CAIRN.<br />
GROUP, TO SECURE A POSITIVE OUTCOME AND HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO STAY<br />
IN CONSTANT AND CONSTRUCTIVE COMMUNICATION WITH ONE ANOTHER<br />
BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE ROUND TO SECURE THAT OUTCOME.<br />
JOURNALIST; AUSSAT?<br />
PMa I'M SORRY, AUSSAT. THERE IS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY US THAT THE<br />
SATELLITE IS CAUGHT UP IN THE MUNITIONS DECISION. WE UNDERSTANL<br />
THAT. WE HAVE AGREED THAT WE WILL STAY IN COMMUNICATION ON THAT<br />
ISSUE AND THAT WILL BE DONE AT OFFICIALS LEVEL. I MAKE THE POIW<br />
THAT WE, AUSTRALIA, HAVE UP UNTIL JULY OF NEXT YEAR TO MAKE A<br />
FINAL DECISION ON THAT MATTER. AND SO WE WILL STAY, AS I SAY IN<br />
CONTACT AT THE OFFICIAL LEVEL TO SZE HOW THE SITUATION W ITH IN<br />
CHINA DEVELOPS, THE ATTITUDE, WHAT OUR SHARED VIEW IS AS TO THE<br />
APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE ON THIS ISSUE AND) IF WE, AS AUSTRALIANS HAV.<br />
TO THEN, IN THE LIGHT OF DEVELOPMENTS CONTEMPLATE ALTERNATIVES.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE, I WONDERED IF YOU HAD ANY FURTHER UPDATED<br />
INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS AND SAFETY OF ZHAO ZIYANG SINCE<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE?<br />
PM: WE UNDERSTAND THAT ZHAO ZIYANG IS STILL IN A SITUATION OF<br />
HOUSE ARREST AS IT WERE. THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN ILL TREATED. WE<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND TRY AND BE AS WELL<br />
INFORMED AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. I THING ONE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT<br />
TH ERE IS A SLIGHTLY SINISTER, CERTAINLY WORRISOME OVERTONE IN THE<br />
STATEMENT, THAT HAM~ G CONDEMIED HIM IN THE FAIRLY EXTENSIVE WAY<br />
THEY HAVE FOR HIS IN INVERTED COMAS CRIMES THAT THEY ARE GOING To<br />
LOOK FURTHER INTO THE ISSUE. IT WOULD SEEM.., THAT THIS CARRIES<br />
POSSIBLE SERIOUS OVERTONES AS TO FURTHER ACTION. OF COURSE, IT<br />
MAEIN A SENSE, SIMPLY A WARNING....<br />
JOURNALIST: WOULD AUSTRALIA BE A CONTACT IN THE To LOOK<br />
AFTER THE 7 </p>
<p>4. S -16-<br />
PM: I HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT. I MEAN THE LETTER THAT I WROTE<br />
LI PENG fIN VERY CLEAR TERMS, I SPELT OUT THAT IN THAT PARAGRAPH<br />
THAT THERE SHOULD BE A HUMANITARIAN AND DECENT APPROACH SHOWN T<br />
THOSE INCLUDING THOSE IN LEBAD ERSHIP POSITIONS WHO HAD DIFFERED<br />
FROM THOSE IN CUJRRENT AUTHORITY. THAT WAS CLEARLY INTENDED TO<br />
COVER THE CASE OF ZHAO ZIYANG AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SO INTERPRETE<br />
JOURNALIST; DID YOU DISCUSS THE ROLE OF THE JOINT FACILITIES It<br />
AUSTRALIA MONITORING NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND IS THERE ANY<br />
PROSPECT OF THAT BEING EXTENDED?<br />
PM: NO WE DIDN'T DISCUSS IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NEED TO. I<br />
MEAN, AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE RECENTLY A TEN YEAR EXTENSION.<br />
THOSE FACI LITI ES, THAT APRRANGEM4ENT AGREEMENT IS IN EXCELLENT<br />
SHAPE. THERE WAS NO NEED ON EITHER SIDE TO FURTHER DISCUSS IT.<br />
JOURNALIST: IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS ON CAMBODIA DID YOU GET ANY<br />
SENSE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS BACKING OFF ITS PLAN TO<br />
AID THE NON-COMMUNISTS?<br />
PM: IS BACKING OF FROM?<br />
JOURNALIST: IS BACKING OFF FROM PLANS TO AID THE NON-. CObOMUISTS.<br />
PMs TO PROVIDE LETHAL AID YOU MEAN?<br />
JOURNALIST: YES,<br />
PM: NO, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THEY GAVE AN<br />
IMPRESSION THEY WER" BACKING OF. THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED TO<br />
GET MY THINKING ON IT. I DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THAT, THAT<br />
THAT MEANS THEY A~ tfOtTEMPLATING BACKING AWAY, BUT ARE CERTAINLY<br />
INTERESTED TO HEAR A QUITE DETAILED LENGTHY EXPOSITION ON THIS<br />
MATTER WHICH I, AT THEIR REQUEST, PROVIDED THEM. I THINK, REALLY<br />
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THE SITUATION, VERY VERY BRI EFY<br />
IS THAT, AS I SAID THERE ARE LOTS OF PROMISING ELEMENTS ON TIM<br />
TABLE. I THINK THERE IS REASON FOR OPTIMISM.<br />
( TAPE INAUDIBLE, CHANGING TAPES)<br />
THIRDLY, HOWEVER, YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE THIS SERIOUS QUESTION MARK<br />
ABOUT WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF THE RECENT EVENTS IN CHINA UPON<br />
THE ATTITUDE THAT CHINA WILL ADOPT. </p>
<p>-17-<br />
( PM CONr) TO SAY THERE IS CONFLICTING VIEWS BEING EXPRESSED BY<br />
PEOPLE, AS WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER LAST<br />
WEEK, HE SAID THEY HAD A LETTER FROM THE THAI PRIME MINISTER,<br />
PRIME MINISTER SITTHI, THAT THEY THOUGHT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY<br />
CHANGE IN THE CHINA POSITION, BUT THEN THEY HAD JUST HAD THAT<br />
MORNING A CABLE FROM THEIR OWN AMBASSADOR SUGGESTING A DIFFERENT<br />
POINT OF VIEW. MY OWN HUNCH IS THAT IF IT HAY BE THAT THERE WILL<br />
BE A TOUGHER LOOK AT THE CHINESE POSITION NOW. I'M SIMPLY SAYING<br />
THAT WHEN YOU TAK( E ALL THOSE VARIOUS STRANDS TOGETHER, I STILL<br />
HA9 A DEGREE OF OPTIMISM, AND I SPEAK FOR THAT REASON THAT I WAS<br />
SAYING THAT I THINK IT WOULDN'T BE A POSITIVE ELEMENT TO<br />
INTRODUCE AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING, HOPEFULLY, WILL BE TAKEN<br />
INTO ACCOUNTr THAT I CAN' T IN ANY SENSE, SAY WHAT THE OUTCOME OF<br />
THEIR CONSIDERATION OF WHAT I SAY OR CONSIDERATION OF THE VARYING<br />
VIEWS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED WITHIN CONGRESS AND SO ON WOULD BE<br />
ON THEIR FINAL DECISION.<br />
JOURNALIST: YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD COME BACK TO THAT POINT<br />
ABOUT AMERICAN ASSISTANCE FOR THE REGIONAL GROUP, AND WENT BEYOND<br />
THE ECONOMIC ISSUES<br />
PM: WELL, I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT THERE IS A VIEW ON THE PART Or<br />
MR BAKER THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR A BROADENING OF THE CHARTER AS IT<br />
WEf OF SUCH A GROUP, TO: 0O TO, WHAT IN THE BROAD SENSE OF THE </p>
<p>c WORD MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS. NOW MY VIEW<br />
ON THAT IS THAT ONE HAS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE, AS I SAID<br />
BEFORE GEOFF, OF THE ASEAN POSITION AND THEN THEY HAVE COME TO A<br />
POSITION WHERE THEY SUPPORT, AND HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT TO<br />
US, THE CONCEPT THAT I HAVE ADVANCED. BUT THEY HAVE DONE THAT<br />
WITHIN SAYING TO MR WOOLCOTT WHEN HE LED MY TEAM THAT'S GONE ROUND<br />
THE REGION. THEY MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THEY ATTACH, IN A<br />
POLITICAL AREA, A PRIMACY TO THE ASEAN GROUPING AND ITS ROLE AND<br />
FUNCTIONS. NOW MY VIEW SIMPLY ON THAT ISSUE IS THAT WE HAVE TO<br />
RESPECT THAT SENSITIVITY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO SUPPORT<br />
ANY POSITION WHICH, BY PUSHING POLITICAL TYPE ISSUES, COULD<br />
UNDERMINE THE SUPPORT WHICH THEY EXPRESSED FOR MY CONCEPT.<br />
JOURNALIST: REGARDING CHINA. YESTERDAY IN YOUR SPEECH, YOU SAID<br />
SOMETHING ABOUT THE STUDENT LEADERS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, BUT<br />
THOSE EXECUTED HAVE BEEN WORKER'S REPRESENTATIVES AND THOSE<br />
INVOLVED IN THE SHANGHAI TRAIN INCIDENT. DID YOIU MEAN TO IMPLY<br />
THAT THEY ARE LESS VALUABLE THAN THE STUDENT LEADERS<br />
PM: NO, NO, NOT AT ALL, I MEAN, I DON'T THINK ANYONE, ANYWHERE<br />
AROUND THE WORLD HAS BEEORE EXPLICIT AND CONDEMNATORY THAN I<br />
HAVE IN REGARD TO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. I WAS SIMPLY SAYING, IT IS<br />
A FACT THAT AT THIS POINT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE<br />
PURSUIT TO THE POINT OF EXECUTION, THE PURSUIT THEN IS APT IN A<br />
SENSE A QUESTION MARK WHICH IS HANGING; WHAT ARE THEY DOING, WHAT </p>
<p>ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT THAT. AND I WAS SIMPLY SAYING THAT IF<br />
THEY ARE GOING TO LAUNCH INTO A FURTHER WAY OF EXECUTION, THAT<br />
THEY COME TO SOME CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT, THAT WOULD OF COURSE,<br />
RAISE VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO HOW, WITH WHAT CONFIDENCE YOU<br />
COULD CONTINUE THIS POSITION OF SAYING WELL WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE<br />
A FORM OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE OF<br />
CHINA ITSELF. I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT THAT IS AN UNARGUABLE FACT<br />
THAT FURTHER COMPLICATES THE ISSUE. SO ITS A VERY DIFFICULT LINE<br />
TO SAY, AND I WELCOME THIS ONE.<br />
JOURNALIST: HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE<br />
HUMAN RIGHTS AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND HUMAN<br />
RIGHTS ABUSE IN CHINA?<br />
PM: 1 DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM OF RECONCILING THAT POSITION. AS<br />
WHAT YOU'VE HAD IN SOUTH AFRICA IS, IE. A POSITION WHERE THERE HAS<br />
BEEN A CONTINUING, AND IN FACT ONE MIGHT SAY, AN ESCALATING DENIAL<br />
OF HUMAN RIGHTS UNDER THE ABHORRENT SYSTEM OF APARTHEID. ITS NOT<br />
AS THOUGH YOU'D HAD SOME RAY OF LIGHT AND A CHANGE OF DIRECTION,<br />
YOU'D HAD, AND I REPEAT, NOT ONLY A CONSISTENT PRACTICE OF<br />
APARTHEID BUT IF ANYTHIN,_ OVER RECENT YEARS, AN<br />
INTENSIFICATION. SO THE CAST OF POLICY OF AUSTRALIA AND THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH WAS ONE WHICH WAS RELEVANT TO THAT SITUATION. AND<br />
MIGHT I SAY, AS I SAID AT THE PRESS CLUB YESTERDAY, LET NO ONE, NO<br />
ONE ARGUE THAT THOSE SANCTIONS HAVE NOT HAD AN EFFECT. I REMIND </p>
<p>a a YOU OF WHAT THE THE GOVERNOR OF THE RESERVE BANK SAID ON THE<br />
9 MAY, AND HIS EXACT WORDS WERE THAT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES,<br />
PARTICULARLY FINANCIAL SANCTIONS HAD CRIPPLED SOUTH AFRICA'S<br />
ABILITY TO DELIVER SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THAT TREND.. HE<br />
SAID, COULD NOT BE REVERSED WITHOUT QUOTE,. " ADEQUATE PROGRESS IN<br />
THE FIELD OF POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM". SO THATIS THE<br />
FRAMEWORK THERE AND AGAINST THAT YOU HAVE A POSITION IN CHINA<br />
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGE UNDER THE EXISTING<br />
STRUCTURE OF LEADERSHIP WHICH HAD INVOLVED BOTH ECONO1MIC REFORM<br />
AND A GRADUAL CONTEMPLATION IN THE PROCESSES OP POLITICAL CHANGE.<br />
NOW WE HAVE HAD THE TRAGEDY OF THE FOURTH OF JUNE AND A SITUATION<br />
WHERE THERE IS NOW AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE. THERE SHOULD<br />
BE HOPE IN THE WORLD THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN CHINA,<br />
BOTH TO A RESUMPTION Of ECONOMIC REFORM, WHICH THIS NEW STRUCTURE<br />
SAYS THAT THEY ARE STILL COMMITTED TO. AND WITHIN THAT FRAMe, I<br />
THINK WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE A CONTINUATION OF ECONOMIC REFORM, AND<br />
OPENING TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS IN WHICH<br />
THERE CAN BE A RESUMPTION OF THE PROCESSES OF PRESSURE FOR<br />
POLITICAL CHANGE. NOW YOU ONLY NEED THAT EXPOSITION TO UNDERSTAND<br />
THAT YOUR ANALOGY IS SIMPLISTIC AND LEADS TO NO CONCLUSION.. OTHER<br />
THAN TO ENDORSE THE COURSE OF ACTION IN CONCEPT THAT HAS BEEN<br />
EMBRACED BY THE PRESIDENT AND MYSELF.<br />
JOURNALISTs SIR, DID THE ANTARCTIC CONE UP TODAY IN THE WHITE<br />
HOUSE AND AS FOLLOW UP TO THAT, DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE RUN INTO<br />
A BRICK WALL WITH WASHINGTON, FURTHER TO YOUR POLICY THERE? </p>
<p>PM: OR AN ICEBERG. YeS, WE DISCUSSED IT TODAY, BUT V'VE ALREADY<br />
ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE HERE, I THINK WE HAVE ANSWERED A QUESTION ON<br />
IT. IT IS A PERFECTLY FRIENDLY, AMICABLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.<br />
I'VE PUT MY VIEWS ABOUT IT, INDICATED WHAT WE WILL BE DOING, AND<br />
IN THE GENTLEST OF TERMS THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT<br />
THAT IT HAS A DIFFERENT PERCEPTION. AND ON THIS ISSUE WE ARE, AS<br />
I SAY, QUITE AMICABLY AGREED TO Go OUR DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT TO<br />
CONTINUE TO CONSULT ON THE ISSUES.<br />
JOURNALIST: YOUR RESPONSES ON THE QUESTION OF CHINA ARE BASED ON<br />
A TEST CASE SCENAR10, LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD IN HOPES THAT PERHAPS<br />
THERE WOULD BE A RESPIRATION OF PROGRESS FOR ECONOMIC REFORM AND<br />
THEN EVENTUALLY POLITICAL REFORM, WHAT IF THAT IS NOT THE<br />
COURSE? WHAT IF, TAKING ALL THE EVIDENCE, AND SEEING A HARDLINE<br />
FACTION BEING CONSOLIDATED AND LEADERSHIP OF THE PRC THAT IT<br />
CONTINUES FOR A PROTRACTED PERIOD A POLICY OF REPRESSION AND<br />
PERIOD OF REPRISALS AND SO FORTH? ARE CONTINGENCY PLANS BRING<br />
DEVELOPED IN THAT REGARD, WERE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS OF<br />
CONTINGENCY PLANS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION HERE?<br />
PM: NO DISCUSSION OF CONTINGENCY PLANS OTHER THAN THAT WE HAVE<br />
AGREED THAT WE ARE GOING TO STAY IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION AND<br />
CONSULTATION ON THIS ISSUE. LET ME MAKE THIS POINT, I MEAN, DON'T </p>
<p>SIMPLY SAY THAT IN REGARD TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE THAT YOU'VE<br />
GOT THE HARDLINE GROUP TO SAY THAT IS MONOLITHIC IN TERMS OF THEIR<br />
PERCEPTIONS. EVERY INDiVIDUAL IN THAT LEADERSHIP GROUP THERE THAT<br />
THERE IS A MONOLITHIC UNIFIED POSITION ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE<br />
SHOULD BE. NOW THAT'S NOT THE CASEO WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO<br />
UNDERSTAND, IF YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT CHINA IS THAT THERE<br />
HAS BEEN, OVER A PERIOD NOW SINCE 1978, A VERY SUBSTANTIAL<br />
CONFLICT BETWEEN DUNG ZAO PING AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT HE'S<br />
NOW HAD TO TURN TO IN THE IMMEDIATE PRE-JUNE THE FOURTH SITUATION<br />
AND POST-JUNE FOURTH SITUATION. AND THERE IS NO IDENTITY OF VIEW<br />
AT ALL BETWEEN DUNG ZAO PING AND MANY OF THOSE LIKE CHUNG YEN AND<br />
OTHERS AS TO WHAT THE APPROPRIATE COURSE IS. THERE IS NO DOUBT<br />
THAT DUNG ZAO PING, AS HE HAS BEEN SINCE THE END OF THE SEVENTIES,<br />
IS COMMITTED TO A CONTINUATION OF ECONOMIC REFORM. THERE ARE MANY<br />
AROUND HIM NOW THAT HE HAS HAD TO CALL IN AID AND WHO ARE NOW<br />
ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THE LEADERSHIP. M4ANY OF THOSE WHO SIMPLY<br />
DO NOT SHARE HIS PERCEPTIONS IN THIS REGARD. SO WE ARE NOT<br />
LOOKING AT AS A SIMPLISTIC QUESTION, AT A MONOLITHIC CONCEPTUAL<br />
LEADERSHIP THERE. THAT BEING THE CASE, AS IT IS, IT IS IMPORTANT<br />
IN MY JUDGEMENT, A JUDGEMENT SHARED BY THE PRESIDENT, MAY I SAY,<br />
BY THE LEADERSHIP IN FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WITH WHOM I<br />
HAVE BEEN RECENTLY TALKING, THAT ITIS IMPORTANT THAT THOSE WHO<br />
SEEK TO NAVE A CONTINUATION OF ECONOMIC REFORM SHOULD BE<br />
ENCOURAGED BUT TO THE EXTENT THEY WANT TO HAVE OPENINGS UP WITH<br />
THE WEST AND THAT SHOULD, THAT OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE THERE. BUT<br />
THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN WAYS WHERE ALL OF US CONTINUE TO MAKE<br />
CLEAR TO THE LEADERSHIP OF CHINA THAT WE WANT TO SEE A SITUATION </p>
<p>NOT ONLY OF CONTINUeD ECONOMIC REFORM BUT AN END TO PERSECUTIONS<br />
AND EXECUTIONS. IT WOULD BE A TOTAL MISREADING OF THE SITUATION<br />
TO LOOK AT THE LEADERSHIP OF CHINA AS ONE UNIFIED GROUP. THERE IS<br />
SIGNIFICANT PHILOSOPHICAL AND CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THAT<br />
GROUP AND THE, ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY THAT<br />
FACED WITH A DUNG ZAO PING, WHO IS IN HIS DECLINING YEARS AND<br />
OBVIOUSLY IN LESS THAN VIBRANT PHYSICAL CONDITION AS TO WHETHER<br />
HIS COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORM AND OPENING UP TO THE WEST IS<br />
GOING TO BE THE VIEW THAT PREVAILS. WE CAN MAKE NO PRESUMPTION<br />
THAT IT WILL AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS IN BALANCE AS IT IS,<br />
THEN IT MAKES $ 0 MUCH MORE IMPORTANT, IN MY JUDGEMENT AND THE<br />
JUDGEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT AND OF OUR FRENCH COLLEAGUES AND<br />
BRITISH COLLEAGUES, THAT WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THAT THRUST RATHER THAN THE THRUST OF THE CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIC<br />
HARDLINERS PREVAILS.<br />
JOURNALIST: ON THE QUESTION OF FIJI. HOW ARE AUSTRALIA'S<br />
S RELATIONS PROGRESSING IN LINE OF LIGHT OF FIJI'S WORKING POLITICAL<br />
CONSTITUTION? PM: WELL, I THINK, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. WE HAVE MADE A<br />
DECISION WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLETELY ADHERED TO OF CUTTING OFF<br />
MILITARY ASSISTANCE. THAT'S BEEN DONE. WE MADE THE JUDGEMENT<br />
THAT IT WAS SENSIBLE TO CONTINUE THE PROVISION, IN A SOMEWHAT<br />
MODIFIED WAY, BUT A PROVISION OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, PARTICULARLY </p>
<p>THAT FORM OF ASSISTANCE WHICH WE COULD IDENTIFY WOULD B3E GOING TO<br />
THE BENEFIT OF ORDINARY FIJIAN CITIZENS AND WE HAVE DONE THAT. We<br />
HAVE MAINTAINED COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEM. WE HAVE, FOR INSTANCE,<br />
I SENT A GROUP OF PEOPLE THERE, LABOUR EXPERTS, AS A RESULT OF<br />
DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH PRIME MINISTER RATU MARA, WHO SAID ONE OF<br />
THEIR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WAS FIJIAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. I SENT<br />
PEOPLE FROM AUSTRALIA WHO HAD EXPERIENCE IN THAT TO MAKE<br />
SUGGESTIONS TO THEM SO THAT, IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAVE TRIED TO KEEP<br />
THE FOCUS ON DOING WHAT WE CAN TO HELP FIJIAN FUNDAMENTAL<br />
PROBLEMS OF ITS PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT OUT OF THE<br />
PROCESSES OF CONSULTATION THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE MOMENT IN<br />
REGARD TO THE FORM OF THE CONSITUTION BUT THERE WILL BE AN<br />
OUTCOME, WHICH IN DEMOCRATIC TERMS, CAN BE SEEN TO BE TOTAL<br />
ACCEPTABLE. THOSE PROCESSES ARE STILL GOING ON AND WE WILL HAVE<br />
TO CONSIDER OUR POSITION IN THE LIGHT OF THE FINAL COM4PLETION THEY<br />
COME TO ON THOSE BENEFITS.<br />
