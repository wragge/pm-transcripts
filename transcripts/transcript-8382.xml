PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT 01? INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELL, 3AW, 16/ 1/ 92.<br />
E E 0 PROOF ONLY<br />
MITCHELL: With~ me the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, good morning<br />
to you<br />
PM: Good morning Neil.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Keating, who are you?<br />
PM: Well if you don't know now after eight and a half years of<br />
me being in the Government I don't suppose I can enlighten you<br />
much further, but<br />
MITCHELL: But something's been discussed though. I mean eight<br />
years of an uncompromising tough man with an image of somebody<br />
who doesn't ' Listen, a bit of arrogance even, and now, to use a<br />
Bob Hawke term, a bit of consensus about you, which is the. real<br />
you? PM: I've always been a good listener. I think in public life<br />
you have to be a good listener. If you're not you can't form<br />
ideas and I -think the hallmark of the last eight years of our<br />
office was -that we did basically consult people, and that's not<br />
to say you shouldn't develop your own framework in which you're<br />
thinking, but part of the development of that is to talk to<br />
people. Now I've always done a fair bit of that but when I<br />
decided on policies, I mean people I'm quite sure have seen me as<br />
direct, confident, this sort of thing<br />
MITCHELL: Arrogant?<br />
PM: Well even maybe, but they wouldn't have thought I wats too<br />
arrogant when I was agonizing over those decisions. I mean they<br />
wouldn't have thought that when they'd seen me privately<br />
agonizing over which direction to go or the other. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: so that image over those eight years is probably<br />
wrong, is it? I think particularly the time when you were being<br />
criticized for saying there is no recession and everywhere around<br />
the streets people were saying look at the closed shops, look at<br />
the people out of work, there is a recession.<br />
PM: Well a recession was technically when you get negative<br />
growth and we didn't have negative growth in those days, but<br />
later came of course. But I think that one has to assess things<br />
and then make decisions and do things. You see the trouble with<br />
Australia was, before the early eighties we had the post-war<br />
economic policy and it went on from 1945 or 1950 in the days of<br />
post-war reconstruction to 1980, and by that we were a country<br />
almost dependent on commodities which were then letting us down.<br />
SO if you want to hide your light under a bushell or not be firm<br />
about your obligation to changing policy, well you would be like<br />
all the rest of them. So that's why I think you've got to-listen<br />
but then once you decide go for it.<br />
MITCHELL: But you agree that you now face a credibility problem<br />
because of this image. I mean can YOU see that they're two<br />
polls with a very low personal popularity rating. I mean is our<br />
credibility problem people saying well if he can throw the switch<br />
to vaudeville that's now been thrown, why should we believe you?<br />
Why should we believe this new image of a man who wants to<br />
listen, who wants to hear people's ideas when previously you just<br />
wiped them off?<br />
PM: No I didn't, that's the point. I mean I never<br />
MITCHELL: That was the perception wasn't it?<br />
PM: Well maybe, but in terms of consulting, if you look at all<br />
the business group discussions, discussions with the -trade<br />
unions, the various community groups through the eighties, I<br />
turned consultation into an artform. I never stopped it. I kept<br />
meeting them all this time to try and keep them involved with the<br />
policy and keep the thrust Of it together. But you see in the<br />
Treasury job it's the sort of the hard man job. You've got to<br />
make sure that budgetry policy of the Government runs from the<br />
Treasurer and the Treasurer's office.<br />
MITCHELL: Are you a hard man?<br />
PM: I don't think I am, no. That switch to vaudeville hasn't<br />
been thrown. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: This is the real you, is it?<br />
PM: I think ils Prime Minister you get a chance to be probably<br />
more of what you are, people see you more as you are than you<br />
would say in -the Treasury post, which is basically about keeping<br />
discipline on the whole structure of the Government.<br />
MITCHELL: Is it difficult to expose your family to all this? I<br />
know, and I understand entirely why there was a pri. vacy<br />
beforehand and I'm sure people respect that, although there were<br />
some classic examples when they didn't, but is it difficult. now<br />
to have to expose the family?<br />
PM: Well no, I think in this sort of natural course of things it<br />
isn't, but we've chosen basically a private life and to keep my<br />
children largely as children removed from the process of the<br />
politics. Now you can't do that absolutely of course but I think<br />
my wife and I have done it as near as you can do to doing it, and<br />
the result is we've tried to keep the kids with the same outlook<br />
as the children they go to school with, the same sort of<br />
experience levels.<br />
MITCHELL: Things like security must go through your mind though,<br />
because you'd have to say Paul Keating polarizes opinion.<br />
PM: That's probably right but I travelled around for well nearly<br />
a decade without any security.<br />
MITCHELL: I noti ' ce you don't have a flag on the car. Is that to<br />
do with security?.<br />
PM: No, I just think that I don't really think I ought 1to be<br />
sort of pointing, saying here I am, there's the flag flying, here<br />
I am. I just don't think that<br />
MITCHELL: But you're Prime Minister, I mean<br />
PM: Yes I know, but I still don't think that driving around<br />
saying here's a motorcycle outrider and a flag saying here I am,<br />
aren't I important, I don't really think that's on, and I think<br />
we've just got a job to do and you try and do it and do it as<br />
effectively as you can but as inconspicuously on occasions as you<br />
can. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
MITCHELL: Does it worry you being unpopular? Those popularity<br />
ratings are very bad. Is that personally disappointing?<br />
PM: I was as popular as any Treasurer was for many years and<br />
then when the recession came that disappeared. I've had my highs<br />
and lows, when I introduced all the tax changes in the middle<br />
eighties my popularity went down again and after that it came up<br />
and it went down again with the recession. I think you can't<br />
worry too much but providing... look you've got to be able to put<br />
your head down at night and say well look, I gave whatever the<br />
issue of the day was, the best shot I had. I did what I thought<br />
was right and I either got it through or I didn't but at least I<br />
did my best. And I think that's the most important, being at<br />
least consoled about what you've been doing and being satisfied<br />
with what you're doing rather than seeking the approbation of<br />
everybody. MITCHELL: How does it feel to put your head down at night when a<br />
member of your Government says you're a dead loss? Laurie<br />
Ferguson, Martin's brother and a member of the Parliament.<br />
PM: Well you can't win them all, and I mean the thing<br />
about.... he's such an urbane and charming fellow, Laurie, that<br />
it's a very stinging criticism.<br />
MITCHELL: Did you speak to him about it?<br />
PM: No, oh God no. You know the old saying, the dogs may bark<br />
but the caravan moves on. I mean you can't worry about them.<br />
MITCHELL: Speaking of dogs and caravans, have you spoken to Bob<br />
Hawke since he's departed?<br />
PM: A couple of times.<br />
MITCHELL: How's the relationship?<br />
PM: Okay.<br />
MITCHELL: Do you want him to stay until the next election?<br />
PM: That's entirely up to him. I think many people in the<br />
Government would like him to stay till the next election.<br />
I </p>
<p>MITCHELL: Hav~ e you asked him to?<br />
PM: No, because it is up to him basically.<br />
MITCHELL: But: you'd rather not have a by-election one would<br />
assume. PM: No, that's why it is a matter for him, but again it's not<br />
for me to be expressing views about his own you know, he's got<br />
the right to do as he wishes after all these years and it's not<br />
for me to say otherwize.<br />
MITCHELL: Is it fair to say you were good mates or was that..?<br />
PM: Oh yes, no no, Bob and I were good mates and I think we got<br />
a lot done. : 1 don't think there was any Prime Minister/ Treasurer<br />
team that was longer serving than the two of us.<br />
MITCHELL: And that mateship obviously has finished now.<br />
PM: Well we're not mateship in the sense that we certainly don't<br />
live out of each others pockets and we're not exchanging<br />
confidences, but', in terms of the camaraderie of a working<br />
relationship through a long period of time and under the stress<br />
of a great change in public policy, I mean whatever people think,<br />
in the eighties this Government globalized Australia, took<br />
Australia to the world and it's changed it forever.<br />
MITCHELL: Haire you seen people already are talking about a Bob<br />
Hawke comeback. Not Bob Hawke in fairness.<br />
PM: Well only, I think only the fellow you mentioned wasn't it?<br />
MITCHELL: They've been a few others who' re not Baying it<br />
publicly. PM: That's a) lright, it's a free world, they can say what they<br />
think. MITCHELL: Is there any chance?<br />
PM: I don't think sO. I don't think Bob would think that<br />
himself. </p>
<p>-6<br />
MITCHELL: The economy and thats why your here, Senator<br />
Button on this station yesterday supported investment<br />
incentives for business do you?<br />
PM: Well, I could do and have on occasions the biggest<br />
incentives, . r gave them two very large incentives, I cut the<br />
personal tax rate, the corporate tax rate from 49% to 39%<br />
and I removed dividends from the taxation system. We<br />
removed the double tax on dividends so at the right moment<br />
incentives matter and this may well be a moment that I think<br />
is something to be considered against our sort of budgetary<br />
backdrop. MITCHELL: Well has John Button pre-empted it?<br />
PM: Well no.<br />
MITCHELL: Well he did. You have in the past pointed out<br />
there should be more restraint.<br />
PM: Well no, John was entirely in order. What he said was<br />
this is some-thing he thinks he favours but it has to be<br />
considered in the totality.<br />
MITCHELL: As Prime Minister you move around, you go<br />
through more of the consultation process. Are you surprised<br />
by what your finding? The level of suffering?<br />
PM: Well, can I just say of yesterday I was very pleasantly<br />
not surprised but confirmed what I thought and that was that<br />
the business community members who came to see us were very<br />
enthusiastic and positive. Such a discussion a decade ago<br />
would, there would have been complaints about tarriffs,<br />
requirements of more protection, the government do this and<br />
that and whi'Le that was certainly part of the order of the<br />
day yesterday, it was put in the context of all of these<br />
people and institutions trying to help. There is much, sort<br />
of, heightened level of awareness about what the government<br />
can do and can't do, what the private economy should do and<br />
shouldn't do and I think it really couldn't of been more<br />
responsible, more optimistic, more enthusiastic.<br />
MITCHELL: That doesn't say much for the unions because you<br />
are now gettiLng that very pressure from the unions for more<br />
protection. PM: Well, I don't know whether we are or not, seriously I<br />
don't think.<br />
MITCHELL: Isn't that the basis of a document they put to<br />
you? PM: Well I haven't seen a document as yet. But can I say<br />
from the ACTU, which is a peak union body in this country,<br />
they are not really out there arguing for more protection. </p>
<p>-7<br />
MITCHELL: What about Wally Curran?<br />
PM: Well Wally might but he hasn't yet. Not to me.<br />
MITCHELL: Do you perhaps regret the involvement of Wally<br />
Curran, he has copped a hell of a lot of flak?<br />
PM: No.<br />
MITCHELL: What's your relation with him?<br />
PM: He is a good fellow Wally.<br />
MITCHELL: Is he? some say he has destroyed the meetings<br />
around this state.<br />
PM: He is a self taught working class intellectual type of<br />
fellow and I think he stands for a lot of what's good about<br />
the Labor Party, and a lot of its values and getting to know<br />
him has been one of the recent pleasures in my life.<br />
MITCHELL: Is it politically wise? His image in this state<br />
is about on par with Norm Gallagher.<br />
PM: I don't think that's fair to him. Norm did plumb a few<br />
depths. MITCHELL: Well is it still politically wise to be involved<br />
with him?<br />
PM: Well I'm involved with a whole lot of people down here.<br />
MITCHELL: But Bill Kelty was so moved as to ring you and<br />
say you had better distance yourself, its going to hurt<br />
Paul. PM: No it didn't, no.<br />
MITCHELL: That didn't happen?<br />
PM: Bill has a very high regard for him as well. But I<br />
talked to trade unions in this state across the board and<br />
have been doing. I've been coming to the ACTU now for a<br />
decade down here but Curran is not a rank and file member of<br />
the ACTU executive. He is a leader of a state union. So I<br />
made it my business in the last year or so to get out and<br />
see some of those state unions.<br />
MITCHELL: So regardless of political damage does that<br />
relationship with him continue?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
MITCHELL: Risk?<br />
PM: I don't sort of walk away from friendships because of<br />
risk. </p>
<p>8-<br />
MITCHELL: Bob Hawke said the same thing about Kerry<br />
Packer. PM: Well, good on him.<br />
MITCHELL: Joan Kirner, one of your supporters here, says<br />
there's been too much delay already in getting things going.<br />
How much damage was done in the time between you left as<br />
Treasurer and when you took over as Prime Minister? Seven<br />
to eight months?<br />
PM: Well, I t~ hink there were opportunities lost and I said<br />
some things at the time which I would have done had I been<br />
around but I've got the chance to do that now so I can only<br />
do, take up -the opportunities I've been given.<br />
MITCHELL: Whose fault was that?<br />
PM: I think gfenerally the government was advised that a<br />
recovery was coming through much more strongly. It's only<br />
about a week ago that I released Treasury's new estimates of<br />
growth through the year, which are one per cent lower than<br />
they were at budget time and I think because I was getting<br />
around the place probably more than members of the<br />
government were I could see that basically those stronger<br />
growth number7s through the year were not going to occur. So<br />
I was saying that they should drop interest rates further,<br />
in the end they did, and that basically they should shift<br />
policy in favour of growth because there wasn't going to be<br />
enough. But the official advisings of the Treasury, the<br />
Reserve Bank, the Department of Finance, the statistician,<br />
the group that make up the forecasting group was saying to<br />
government look that will be ok, our numbers are basically<br />
right. Well it turns out they weren't.<br />
MITCHELL: Its interesting you say you saw more when you<br />
went to the backbench, you were able. to be more in touch.<br />
Do you feel that in retrospect you were out of touch as<br />
Treasurer? PM: Well I did as much as you can I think as Treasurer to<br />
get around and stay in touch but when I was on the backbench<br />
I saw a lot of groups and people that I wouldn't have seen<br />
as Treasurer, you know I just went out of my way to do that.<br />
And I had the: time to do it. I think this is always a<br />
problem for ministers, you just can't see as many people as<br />
you should see.<br />
MITCHELL: Do you feel you failed as Treasurer?<br />
PM: No I don't because the Australian economy will now have<br />
a future as an externally-oriented economy in the<br />
international world of trade and commerce which it wasn't.<br />
MITCHELL: We' re in a pretty deep hole at the moment<br />
though? </p>
<p>9-<br />
PM: Yes we are in a recession, but we will emerge from the<br />
recession an~ d what we will look at in the 90s is a low<br />
inflation country, with low rates of interest, with a<br />
structural budget surplus with a big shift in export and<br />
manufacturers. I mean this is the future, there is a good<br />
underlying long term future for Australia in the 90s, the<br />
short term is the recession and the problems it has brought<br />
but again, that followed eight years of growth.<br />
MITCHELL: So you set that up in your period as Treasurer?<br />
PM: Well I was the one who set up the institutional<br />
arrangements to internationalise the place and I think had<br />
we not done that Australia wouldn't have a future it would<br />
be just a low growth country relying on a few commodities<br />
with a very large current account deficit and therefore sort<br />
of a permanent recession, a permanent low growth mode. And<br />
that's what would have happened, you talked orginally about<br />
making decisions, standing up and pushing your way through<br />
had I not pushed through things like the float, the removal<br />
exchange controls, cutting government spending all of those<br />
things in the 80s Australia would be now doomed as a low<br />
growth place.<br />
MITCHELL: Mrs Kirner says she is looking for direct help<br />
for Victoria, will she get it?<br />
PM: Well I thinkVictoria has taken a great burden of the<br />
brunt of the structural changes in Australia, that is the<br />
changes in protection, the fall in the cycle in the<br />
recession in manufacturing, its borne the brunt of that and<br />
a large part of the low level of confidence in the country JC<br />
think is coming from the experience of the people of<br />
Victoria of -this recession. So I have said now for nearly a<br />
year, that ViLctoria is a problem and has to be dealt with by<br />
the government in those terms.<br />
MITCHELL: Are we still a basket<br />
PM: Well I think it's bottomed. It's probably bumping on<br />
the bottom and may pick up but it won't pick up without<br />
help. MITCHELL: Does that mean pump-priming in inevitable its<br />
just a matter7 Of where?<br />
PM: Well its not a good term pump-priming because mostly it<br />
has been in a budgetary spending which has picked the<br />
economy up and often we have squandered that which we have<br />
spent. What we would like to do is to try to give the place<br />
a stimulus but the things we do to do it are ones which<br />
structurally help Australia in the future. So in other<br />
words, rather than just having a sort of a big quick bang<br />
which sort of goes into thin air but costs a lot of money.<br />
Do things which are structurally good while at the same time<br />
pick the place up. So I have been to Victoria a lot in the<br />
last two years, a lot, sometimes a couple of times a week<br />
and I've seen a lot of Joan Kirner over this period as well </p>
<p>10<br />
and Joan's prepared to make decisions, get things done and<br />
where I can help her I will.<br />
MITCHELL: Some say, in fact the reason you're Prime<br />
Minister is the support of Victoria<br />
PM: No, I got two Victorian votes only.<br />
MITCHELL: Just going back to Wally Curran, one suggestion<br />
he is putting forward and I wonder about what you say about<br />
structural change is screwing up the super funds and now<br />
you'll look at it?<br />
PM: Well I think one of the options which the trade unions<br />
is talking about is letting younger members of super funds<br />
have some sort of draw down on the funds for their housing.<br />
And this is a concept which has been around a bit and which<br />
is worthy of consideration. There are issues here and that<br />
is the question of preservation, and these superannuation<br />
benefits are to be preserved not to be touched till age<br />
So that the sort of policy conundrum is how can you have<br />
them preserved and not touched until 55 but touch them for<br />
certain, if you like, approved things such as housing and<br />
that we are prepared to have a look at.<br />
MITCHELL: A couple of quick things and we are running out<br />
of time, you once described........ as the media nut, I think<br />
Michelle Grattan said you were a media nut. In that<br />
background are you comfortable with the Conrad Black<br />
PM: they seem to run a decent newspaper organisation<br />
around the world, most particularly in Britain where the<br />
weight of it is and I'm quite sure that what Fairfax needs<br />
mostly is a sort of a caring owner. I think the business<br />
has sort of suffered as a result of this ownership and<br />
I don't think newspapers can have a dozen years of being<br />
uncompetitive. MITCHELL: Do you think they might be more fairer to you, I<br />
mean the Fairfax press traditionally give you a bit of a<br />
hard time, apart from the leadership<br />
PM: No, Fairfax newspaper has been pretty fair to me I have<br />
to say, pretty fair to me I can't complain, I mean<br />
occasionally I have had a row with them but its been<br />
occasional. MITCHELL: Still on media, the TV and radio political<br />
advertising ban its not your legislation do you support it?<br />
PM: Well it h-as been amended in the Senate and it's I think<br />
seen as a solution to the problems of political advertising<br />
and its scale and cost and the pressure of the parties I<br />
think we can have, certainly not perfection I don't think we<br />
should just now, perhaps it was not perfection in its<br />
original form its certainly not perfection now.<br />
MITCHELL: Can we get it right? </p>
<p>11<br />
PM: I don't know but is something I am prepared to have a<br />
look at.<br />
MITCHELL: Also prepared to back away from if necessary?<br />
PM: No<br />
MITCHELL: Refine?<br />
PM: Refine I'd say but again the Bill is now back in the<br />
House of Representatives and we can examine it.<br />
MITCHELL: Collingwood Football Club, does your support<br />
continue? PM: Yes I'm a Sydneysider because I live in Sydney and I'm<br />
not a member of the Melbourne community but I get down to a<br />
few games a year.<br />
MITCHELL: End of the year, not the Collingwood Football<br />
Club, where will we be? Any better off or still a lot of<br />
pain ahead?<br />
PM: I think wie will promote a recovery I hope Australia will.<br />
be growing significantly a year from now and I hope most<br />
particularly that the fortunes of the people of Victoria and<br />
the mood of -this community has changed from a negative one<br />
to a positive one. I think that would be great for<br />
Australia and great for the State and I think it is<br />
encumbent upon all of us in national politics to make sure<br />
that happens.<br />
MITCHELL: Confidence is a key?<br />
PM: Confidence is a key and at the moment confidence just<br />
isn't there, you still have tremendous problems with falls<br />
in asset prices.<br />
MITCHELL: This is what baffles me, the confidence isn't<br />
there and the people say to me it's because of Paul Keating,<br />
because of when he was Treasurer, we can't wipe that eight<br />
year memory.<br />
PM: Just remember this, in the seven years before 1983 we<br />
have 1.9% economic growth a year, in the seven years after<br />
1983 we had 4.1 twice as much.<br />
MITCHELL: unemployment<br />
PM: In the eight years between 1983 and 1990, seven years in<br />
between, seven to eight years we produced one and a half<br />
million jobs so in 1983 we had 10% unemployment and in 1992<br />
we have 10% unemployment. But in 1983 we had<br />
unemployment in a workforce of six million, we've now got<br />
unemployment in a workforce of 7.5 million so we have<br />
kept largely the 1.5 million jobs we created in the 80s. So<br />
I don't think people are entitled to say that they have bad </p>
<p>12<br />
memories of my stewardship over the eight years, they might<br />
have bad memories of the last eighteen months but the<br />
previous seven years it was one of the highest growth,<br />
highest income, highest wealth producing periods in<br />
certainly our post war history.<br />
MITCHELL: Final question, you and your mate John Laws now<br />
you launched his book in February but Melbourne radio was<br />
bland in fact your having a cup of tea now but you had time<br />
for a cup of tea in between questions, I assume that there<br />
are exceptions to bland radio in Melbourne or do you still<br />
think that is right?<br />
PM: As I general rule I think it was bland I think, I mean<br />
Laws is blessed with this, I think, a great radio career, a<br />
great radio manner, a very easy touch with what I think is<br />
the view or the feeling of most people, a common touch, his<br />
great ease of manner, his great skill I think is to develop<br />
a very conversational tone and in that out comes all of the<br />
little truths which are often hidden in a more racy<br />
interview and the other thing about him is that he must have<br />
the best radio voice ever.<br />
MITCHELL: Is normal radio bland?<br />
PM: its one of your colleages saying I saw him in the<br />
United States, I said well there wouldn't be someone in the<br />
Unites States who has a better radio voice than him, it is a<br />
knockout radio voice. In other words some of that is Godgiven<br />
so it is no one's fault if you don't have a voice that<br />
good.<br />
MITCHELL: Even if it is bland will you come down and take<br />
some calls with us one day, and talk to the public?<br />
PM: Pleased to, thank you very much<br />
MITCHELL: Prime Minister, we have ratings ahead of John<br />
Laws I should tell you, I've good a crook voice but better<br />
ratings. PM: I know but you have to make sure that you get the<br />
cheques out of the company that he gets out of his.<br />
MITCHELL: That would be a real achievement, thanks for<br />
your time.<br />
I </p>
