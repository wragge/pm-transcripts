<p>Labor MPs today showed their support for White Ribbon Day  -  Australia's only male led campaign to stop men's violence against women  -  and announced funding for a new initiative.</p>
<p>Attending a Parliament Stands Behind White Ribbon Day morning tea, the Prime Minister announced the Government would provide funding for an international conference into domestic violence programs to be held in Australia next year.</p>
<p>From May 13 to 15, White Ribbon and the University of Wollongong will host the international conference in Australia in an effort to connect research, policy and practice in this important area.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will provide $20,000 in funding from the Women's Safety Agenda to support this important Australian-first conference.</p>
<p>The conference will help increase awareness of the best ways to combat violence against women. The hope is that lessons from this conference can be used across the globe, including in the programs and White Ribbon initiatives.</p>
<p>To achieve a sustained reduction to violence against women and girls, every sector of the Australian community must act.</p>
<p>Each year, more Australian men pledge themselves to the principles of the White Ribbon movement, which reached our shores in 2003.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is committed to primary prevention activities aimed at reducing violence against women and their children.</p>
<p>The National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children 2010-2022 brings together the efforts of governments across the nation.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has committed $86 million to initiatives under the National Plan to improve the lives of women who have experienced violence.</p>
<p>This is the first national plan to focus strongly on prevention, on building respectful relationships and improving gender equality.</p>
<p>Funding for the conference will be provided through the Women's Safety Agenda.</p>
