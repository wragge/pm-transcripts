PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 8 1981<br />
Controlling Bushfires in Victoria<br />
At the request of the Victorian Government, the Commonwealth<br />
Government is to provide a RAAF Hercules Aircraft to Victoria<br />
for the bushfire. season in 1981/ 82.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser and the Premier of<br />
Victoria, Mr Dick Hamer, today announced-this important<br />
initiative which will permit the Victorian Government to<br />
utilise a technologically advanced fire bombing system in the<br />
fight against the bushfire menace in Victoria. The Hercules<br />
will be equipped with a Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System<br />
( MAFFS) which has a capacity of about 11,000 litres of water<br />
and fire-retardant chemicals. The US Forest Service has<br />
undertaken to make this system available for evaluation in<br />
Victorian conditions. The Commonwealth and Victoria will<br />
share the costs of the evaluation equally.<br />
Mr Fraser recalled that on 22 September he had announced<br />
the Commonwealth's decision to carry out an evaluation of<br />
the use of aircraft for fighting bushfires. This study,<br />
being undertaken by the CSIRO, involves a thorough scientific<br />
assessment of the effectiveness of bombing fires of varying<br />
intensity with water and fire-retardant chemicals. The CSIRO<br />
will be comparing this technique with conventional fire fighting<br />
methods and will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of bushfire<br />
suppression methods.<br />
Mr Fraser and Mr Hamer agreed that the CSIRO will be able to<br />
take full advantage of the trials and operations of the<br />
Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System in Victoria to collect<br />
data on bushfire behaviour and control.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier concluded by acknowledging<br />
the very great damage caused by bushfires in Victoria since<br />
1967. The initiative announced today will build on the<br />
experience gained to date and will also assist in collecting<br />
information on the performance of large fire-bombing systems<br />
in Australia. </p>
