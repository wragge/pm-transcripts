    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, welcome. Lucy and I were delighted to be with you last night at home with Clarke and welcome you this morning. We’ve had a very good discussion - we have left a few things to discuss here, so not everything - but the friendship, the partnership, the alliance between our two countries is so enduring and it gets closer all the time. We’ve talked about important strategic issues, the work our armed forces are doing together in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we’ve got so much more to talk about, our cooperation there. Fundamentally our alliance, our family relationship, is built on shared values. That's the most important thing.</p>
<p>Shared values, democracy and the rule of law, freedom, the enterprise of Kiwis and Australians working together.</p>
<p>So, welcome Prime Minister and over to you.</p>
<p><strong>RT HON JACINDA ARDERN MP, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Prime Minister for your hospitality and your welcome. I think it speaks volumes about our country's relationship but also ours, that last night when you kindly hosted Clarke and myself, we didn't actually talk about any work whatsoever and had an incredibly enjoyable evening as well, so thank you for that.</p>
<p>Of course today, on the agenda, because there is such a shared interest, mutual interest across a number of areas, particularly within our region and those shared values are the foundation for all those conversations.</p>
<p>Of course many things to discuss from a business perspective, the economic relationship that we share. There's even more that we can build on in that regard as well, so I’m looking forward to building a bit of a work program for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Finally, I think it speaks volumes as well that, since I became Prime Minister four months ago - it feels so much longer – four wonderful months, this is my third visit to Australia since that time.</p>
<p>So you are our closest friend in many regards and of course a place I choose to holiday as well. So thank you very much for having us and I look forward to some constructive conversations.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
