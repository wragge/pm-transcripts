ALU5 Ill . IA L 2 9 JUL V!<br />
FOR M= DA ' SUNDAY, 27 JULY, 1980<br />
ADDRESS' TO VICTORIAN STATE. COUNCIL<br />
I mst say, that itl is good to be back at Maivern Town -all<br />
from where we launched our last great election victory.<br />
A meeting of this kind, in any year, is an important occasion.<br />
But in this election year, it provides a significant opp. Dortunity<br />
to share, with genuine pride, in the optimism that now<br />
exists about Australia's future.<br />
Major indicators reflect more than favourably on our<br />
chances in the year ahead. And these chances, emerging for<br />
Australia at the end of five years of Liberal Government,<br />
demonstrate the proven capacity of Liberalism to lead Australia<br />
to new levels of achievement.<br />
We have come a long way since 1975 when the nation was<br />
experiencing a sense of gloom.<br />
Confidence, optimism and the sense of challenge, for so<br />
long the envied characteristics of Australian life, had<br />
been overtaken by national doubt, and a sense of<br />
pessimism and defeat.<br />
Without underrating the magnitude of the problems we faced,<br />
we rejected this pessimism.<br />
Now, we stand at the beginning of the 80s, much better placed<br />
than inany other advanced industrialised countries.<br />
But, we must match the success we have achieved with a<br />
willingness and a commitment to tackle the challenge that<br />
lies ahead.<br />
What is this challengc?<br />
What are going to be the opportunities and difficulties of<br />
the 1930s to which we, as Liberals, must respond?<br />
The first, is the continuing need to maintain responsible<br />
economic management; and to make the hard decisions necessary<br />
to make this possible. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The second challenge, is the need to respond to the world<br />
energy problem, responsibly, and with a sense of Austra: lia's<br />
future. The third is the challenge of harnessing the nation's<br />
resources in a co-ordinated and responsible programme of<br />
national development.<br />
The fourth is the challenge to malke sure that this<br />
development is not, just development for its owan sake; but<br />
to see that it provides opportunities for as many Australians<br />
as possible.<br />
The fifth is the challenge to meet our responsibilities to<br />
~ uini~ c ~ rrivlege d.<br />
And finally, our responsibility in domestic management<br />
must be complemented by a concerned and responsible<br />
stance in international affairs.<br />
In all of these, we need to approach our task with the<br />
determination to create a fairer, more just and more<br />
tolerant society.<br />
Of all these considerations, the responsible management<br />
of the economy remains pre-eminent; for without that WE!<br />
will not be able to reach our objectives.<br />
To date, in absolute and relative terms, we are ahead in the<br />
important fight against inflation. While our inflation r. ate of 10.7%<br />
is still too high, it is well below that of the United States at<br />
14% and the United Kingdom at 21%; and the OECD, the<br />
economic organisation of advanced industrialised countries,<br />
has predicted that Australia's inflation rate in 1980 will<br />
be significantly below the average level forecast for these<br />
countries as a whole.<br />
But our efforts must not be compromised.<br />
It is only by maintaining the success of our fight again~ st<br />
inflation that we can secure sustainable economic growth;<br />
that industriescan produce more, and employ more.<br />
One of the chief weapons in the containment of inflation is<br />
restraint in Government expenditure.<br />
We remain unapologetic about our commitment to this goal, and<br />
in the financial yebar just ended, the Government a'hieved the<br />
largest ever recorded reduction in the Budget deficit.<br />
Yet, already, Mr. Hayden has announced policies to spend.<br />
at least $ 2 billion of taxpayers' money in only five areas. </p>
<p>3<br />
That is not a bad effort; after all, it is only' July.<br />
And what will Mr. Hlayden do<br />
when all his Shadow Ministers put in their bids?<br />
After all, the A. L. P. Conference commits the Labor Party<br />
to more than 150 programmes that are not accounted. for<br />
in the figure of $ 2,000 million, and Mr. Hayden reminded<br />
us, only as recently as June 27, that they are serous<br />
about all these program-mes: " What i do say is that wec-have<br />
the sanction of our platform to devise policies and we are<br />
prepared to imp lenient themi as a Government."<br />
Mr. Hayden is alw,, ays careful to avoid telling us how ' he<br />
is going to pay for all" this.<br />
But we do know that M Keating said that Labor's resources<br />
tax will collect more revenue than our current oil levy:<br />
" The debate about resources taxes doesn't matter much tO the<br />
motorist at all. What does matter is if, over time, the<br />
resources tax does collect more than the levy and I<br />
expect it will."<br />
Mr. Hayden has been just as specific, reminding us last<br />
December that his revenue raising programmes were: " Somewhat<br />
more radical than had been outlined up to 1972."<br />
He warned us about our taxation future under Labor, when.<br />
he said: have committed my organisation to a capital<br />
gains tax, a resources rental tax, a levy on domestic oil<br />
producers, a number of initiatives in the tax area and<br />
other measures of that nature."<br />
In what constitutes an elaboration of the " other measures"<br />
the Opposition's Spokesman on Economic Affairs has said<br />
that it is " wrong" that we do not have " some form of tax on<br />
capital, be it death duties, capital gains tax, weal~ th tax,<br />
or perhaps some kind of combination of those, or all thr~ ee."<br />
We cannot say we have not been warned.<br />
We must thank Mr. Hayden for reminding us that Australia<br />
cannot af. Eord the Labor Party.<br />
It is the containment of inflation that has made us<br />
competitive at home and abroad; and won for Australian<br />
industry a new share in world markets.<br />
Exports last year were up 33%; -and this enables us to pay<br />
our way internationally.<br />
The recorded improvement in Australia's economic activity is<br />
reflected in employment growth. While unemployment is still too<br />
high, total employment in May was 194,000 higher than in<br />
May last year. </p>
<p>4<br />
Australia's economic achievements are winning increasing<br />
international acceptance.<br />
A recent report made explicit the confidence of British<br />
investors in the Australian economy; -a confidence which<br />
they were reported as having said they could not gain<br />
elsewhere; a confidence w. hich, in the words of the report,.<br />
" wa* S conditional upon the continuation of a Liberal Government."<br />
These investors proclaimned Australia as a country featuring<br />
a well managed economy, stable government, and good prospects<br />
for the fruture.<br />
The O. B the economic organisation of advanced<br />
induscriali_ d countries, has drawn attention to the<br />
that Australia's growth prospects are very much better than<br />
those anticipated for member countries as'a whole, and riuch.<br />
be-tter than the prospects for the U. S. and the U. K.<br />
It is because of our improved economic health that development<br />
of all kinds is being attracted to Australia.<br />
But for this to continue, investors, small and large, must<br />
know that this economic environment can be sustained.<br />
They must know that an economic climate exists which makes<br />
risk taking worthwhile.<br />
The second challenge that we face is that of responding to<br />
the world energy problem, responsibly, and with a sense of<br />
Australia's future.<br />
It is a challenge which occupied the attention of the recent<br />
economic summit meeting in Venice.<br />
The leaders of the seven major industrialised countries<br />
pronounced that the link between economic growth and oi: l<br />
consumption must be broken this decade.<br />
And they stressed that this must be done through maximum<br />
reliance on the pricing mechanism.<br />
The summtit confirmed that the Australian Government's import<br />
parity pricing policy is the right policy: that only by<br />
allowing prices to bring supply and demand together can we hope<br />
tto encourage exploration and development of new energy<br />
resources; to moderate the growth in demand for oil; and to<br />
facilitate the shift to alternatives to oil-fired energy.<br />
on all these fronts, as a result of our oil parity pricing<br />
policy, the Government has secured significant success. </p>
<p>In oil exploration and development:<br />
* expenditure levels are five times what they were<br />
in 1975;<br />
* during this year 50-60 on-shore wells are likely to.<br />
be drilled compared with six in 1975;<br />
* in the last four years one billion barrels of<br />
petroleum l'iquids h1-ave been added to Australia's<br />
economically recoverable reserves;<br />
4-5,000 maillion of investment is about to procee~ d<br />
on the North West Shelf, and<br />
* Esso/ B. H. P. have already announced programmes of<br />
$ 1.2 billion in Bass Strait.<br />
In conservation: * Australian vehicle manufacturers recently announced<br />
new targets for fuel efficiency and economy, based<br />
on voluntary standards suggested by the Governent;<br />
* this will result in significant reduction in the use<br />
of petrol;<br />
* petrol consumption for May 1980 was 9.8% below that<br />
for May 1979.<br />
In promoting the use of alternatives to oil,<br />
* the extension of natural gas pipelines will result<br />
in further savings, for example, the Sydney-Newcastle<br />
pipeline due to be completed later this year will save<br />
the equivalent of about 3 million barrels of oil<br />
a year.<br />
* In 1979, two million barrels of fuel oil were saved<br />
in the Sydney market alone by industrial conversions<br />
frori oil to natural gas.<br />
Parity pricing is accelerating the development of alternatives<br />
to oil.<br />
The massive Rundle shale oil project would not have beer.<br />
contemplated without our internationally competitive<br />
parity pricing.<br />
Yet the Rundle project provides that, by about 1990, it<br />
would be producing approximately 200,000 barrels per day-,<br />
equal to about one quarter of Australia's crude oil demands<br />
at that time.<br />
Of course, in the short term, oil parity pricing poses<br />
difficulties; nobody likes increased prices for petrol. </p>
<p>6<br />
But in the current world energy situation, it is the height<br />
of irresponsibility to talk about cheaper petrol.<br />
With cheaper petrol, industry would be encouraged to<br />
postpone new technologies.<br />
Cheaper petrol would make Australia, in the years ahead,<br />
a defenceless victim of the key oil exporting countries<br />
beggars for fuel with prices much higher than we now have<br />
to pay.<br />
Such a policy of cheaper petrol would be a selfish policy;<br />
a policy for tcday; a policy which ignores the needs of ourchildren.<br />
It would be asking our children to make adjustments in the<br />
future, more extreme and much more difficult than are being<br />
asked of us today.<br />
And even with parity pricing, our petrol prices of around<br />
32-33Â½ per litre in capital cities, still compare more than<br />
favourably with New Zealand 45Â½ per litre; West Germany 57Â½<br />
per litre; Britain 62Â½ per litre; Japan 67Â½; the<br />
Netherlands 67Â½; France 73Â½; and Italy 77Â½ per litre.<br />
Our energy policy is a key part of the Government's overall<br />
economic strategy, designed to take full advantage of our<br />
energy strength in an energy scarce world.<br />
But not only do we have substantial reserves of energy; we<br />
also have great natural resources.<br />
Together, these provide the third challenge that the<br />
Government is already successfully facing the challenge to<br />
harness the nation's resources in a co-ordinated and responsible<br />
programme of national development.<br />
Almost every day of the week in Australia's financial papers,<br />
there are reports of great development taking place in this<br />
country. In mining and manufacturing alone, the May survey of the<br />
Department of Industry and Commerce indicates $ 29 billion of<br />
projects either committed, or in the final feasibility stage.<br />
Over 70% of these projects are energy related.<br />
They include more than $ 7 billion in oil and gas exploration<br />
and development; and over $ 7 billion in coal exploration<br />
and development projects.<br />
Australians can look forward to widening export opportunities<br />
for our coal. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
This is reflected in the massive rise in our exports of<br />
black coal and steaming coal that is predicted by the<br />
International Energy Agency.<br />
In steaming coal, for example, these are expected to rise<br />
from the current level of 6 million tonnes per annum to<br />
34 million tonnes per annum by 1990.<br />
It is because of Australia's abundant coal reserves, andl<br />
in particular, our-potential for cheaper coal-fi. red energy,<br />
that our raw materials and energy are increasingly coming<br />
together in a significant progrartLme of mineral processing.<br />
The Tnutvand Corzrce survey shows that almTost $ 5 billion<br />
of aluminium projects are either under way or about o<br />
For some time now, it has been the Government's concern that<br />
the development challenges of the decade ahead are<br />
adequately met.<br />
In order to achieve this, the Commonwealth, at three Loan<br />
Council meetings since 1978, authorised the States to<br />
proceed with almost $ 5 billion worth of projects, designed<br />
to provide the facilities for accommodating our expanding<br />
development. These include construction and expansion of ports, coal loaders,<br />
electricity generating facilities and pipeline development.<br />
More than $ 1.3 billion is scheduled for Victoria, including the<br />
massive increase in the capacity of the Loy Yang power station.<br />
This extended capacity, together with Bass Strait development,<br />
will make Victoria one of the energy rich States of Australia,<br />
a facility which will act as a springboard to further development.<br />
What this activity suggests is that the energy crisis for much<br />
of the industrialised world has become an energy opportunity<br />
for Australia.<br />
And -ve are responding positively and successfully to the<br />
call for expanded energy and raw material development in.<br />
a world greatly in need of both.<br />
This presents us with the fourth challenge to make sure<br />
that this development is not just development for its ow; n sake,<br />
but that it provides opportunities for as many Australians<br />
as possible.<br />
This process is already under way as new job opportunities<br />
are being created and Australia's employment growth shows<br />
a marked improvement.<br />
These new employment opportunities are not just occurring<br />
in the construction and production phases of development. </p>
<p>8<br />
For development, and the wealth it creates, give direct<br />
stimulation to other sectors of the economy manufacturing,<br />
retial, transport, communications, and a whole variety of<br />
service industries.<br />
The net result of all this activity is the improved<br />
well-being of all Australians.<br />
The Government has a far reaching strategy for making<br />
sure that the Australian interest is secured in national<br />
development. It was this Government which established the Foreign<br />
Inves-ent Review Board in 1976 to provide advice to<br />
the Covernment on foreign investment proposals.<br />
It enforces specific guidelines which pronote Australian<br />
participation and partnership in our great resource projects.<br />
The Government's objective is to achieve 50% Australian<br />
equity wherever that is possible; and, where possible,<br />
a predominance of Australian management.<br />
We need to understand that foreign investment only takes<br />
place when companies comply with Australian laws.<br />
All foreign investors have to comply with our normal<br />
taxation policies.<br />
They have to comply with the environmental legislation of<br />
the States and the Commonwealth.<br />
They have to operate within the framework of the Trade<br />
Practices Act; and they have to meet the conditions o: F<br />
the Companies Act.<br />
Just as all these things apply to all Australian corpor ations.<br />
On these proper terms, it is in our interest to accept<br />
foreign capital in partnership with Australian enterprises.<br />
We simply can't develop Australia without it.<br />
We want foreign investment, and we are getting foreign<br />
investment.<br />
For without foreign capital, many of our resource projects<br />
would not take place because of the limited capaqity of our<br />
capital markets. / 9 </p>
<p>For example, the North I-est Shelf, by itself a<br />
$ 4-5,000 million project, would run our capital markets<br />
dry if it were to be financed from our own resources<br />
alone.-<br />
And this would not be in the interest of Australia, or<br />
our children, or r** he security of the nation.<br />
The Government also recognises that there is a clear need<br />
t * o make sure that development has due regard to the<br />
irntenance and enht-ancei-menF-of the Australian env: Lro= P. nt<br />
in which it is located.<br />
Wie have sometimes had to take difficult decisions to<br />
protect the environment; just as we have been prepared to<br />
take difficult decisions to secure the heal~ th of the<br />
economy.<br />
This has been proven by our actions in relation to<br />
Fraser Island.<br />
The Government promotes and supports development<br />
because it believes that the wealth and strength of this<br />
country are of vital importance.<br />
The fifth challenge that confronts us as a nation is the<br />
challenge to assist the underprivileged, those in need;<br />
and the greater the wealth we generate from national<br />
development, the greater will be our ability to do this. </p>
<p>10<br />
Governments have no resources of their own.<br />
1 hen people ask things of Government, they sometimes forget<br />
that what we provide has first to be taken from you, and<br />
from every other Australian.<br />
Thefore, the ore wealth there is in Australia, the more<br />
we can create as a people; the better the services; the better<br />
the education; the more resources there are for excellence<br />
in research; and the greater is our capacity to provide<br />
for those who need assistance.<br />
One area where assistance is being provided is in equipping<br />
young people with adequate skills to increase their<br />
opportunities for employment.<br />
Many of these job opportunities will require a specialised<br />
form of training; yet there are many young people in our<br />
community who face the risk of unemployment because they do<br />
not possess the necessary work skills.<br />
Many of them are products of an education system which for<br />
too long has placed too much emphasis on academic qualities.<br />
It has ignored the needs of those whose talents lie in<br />
different vocational directions, especially those requiring<br />
trade training.<br />
It is the responsibility of Australian schools to develop the<br />
qualities and talents of all Australian students; to find<br />
something that each student can do well.<br />
I doubt that most of our schools are meeting that standard<br />
at this time.<br />
To the extent that they are not, I regard the school<br />
system as failing young Australians.<br />
As a result, many are inadequately prepared for the<br />
transition from school to work.<br />
The Government accepts a significant obligation to help<br />
train these young Australians; to increase their chances<br />
of competing successfully for the jobs that are becoming<br />
available. l </p>
<p>11<br />
Since we came to office, over 600,000 people have heen<br />
assisted by our manpower and training programmes.<br />
These initiatives are just part of the Government's concern<br />
for those who are -disadvantaged and in need of particular help.<br />
In the last five years, while practising stringent government<br />
rost. r-aint-, we have not comLpromised the proud Liberal tradition.<br />
of assistance to tI. hose in need.<br />
Care for the aged is an important concern of the whole<br />
community, as it is of governments.<br />
In significant measures to secure this, the Government has<br />
replaced the complex means test for aged people with a<br />
fairer and simpler income test.<br />
Apart from the security offered by the automatic indexation of<br />
pensions, the standard rate of pensions has reached its<br />
highest level in over thirty years as a proportion of<br />
average weekly earnings.<br />
We have approved the building of over 500 new self-contained<br />
hostel and nursing home projects and have already determined<br />
that this programme will continue for the next three years.<br />
These initiatives have been complemented by our concern for<br />
the family.<br />
We have introduced family allowances designed to help low<br />
income families.<br />
By July 1 this year, the spouse rebate had increased from<br />
$ 400 to $ 800 during our term of office; and the sole<br />
parent rebate has risen from $ 200 to $ 559.<br />
Since we came to office, we have extended the supporting<br />
parent's bene-fit to include supporting fathers..<br />
This represents pioneering assistance to single income<br />
families.<br />
The Government is determined that the abilities and apt: Ltudes<br />
of people . with hiandicaps should receive w~ ider recognition.<br />
In our first Budget, we introduced triennial funding to<br />
enable organisations to provide more certain and effective*<br />
help for handicapped persons. 12 </p>
<p>1<br />
Over the last three years, the funds that we have made<br />
available through this programme have increased by almost<br />
in real terms, over the levels that operated in<br />
the three Labor years.<br />
Furth: r sums for capital and recurrent expenditure have<br />
already been approved by the Government for the next three<br />
years and these will ensure continued expansion of services<br />
for disabled people.<br />
These services include the provisions of training centres<br />
and sheltered workshops for handicapped adulL-s; d. ay<br />
training centres for handicapped children; activity therapy<br />
centres; and residential facilities for people who need<br />
special accommodation to enable them to engage in normal<br />
outside employment.<br />
With these facilities, disadvantaged people are able to<br />
demonstrate to themselves and to their own families and<br />
communities that they have skills; and that, with these<br />
skills, they can contribute usefully to society and to<br />
their own self-esteem.<br />
In taxation reform, we have increased the level at which<br />
a single taxpayer pays income tax from $ 2,519, when we came<br />
to office, to $ 4,041, today.<br />
For the taxpayer with a dependent spouse, in 1975-76 income<br />
tax was paid on all income from $ 4,000.<br />
Today, there is a tax-free area for this family up to<br />
$ 6,542.<br />
In these ways, we have relieved many low income earners from<br />
paying any tax; and, as a result, about half a million more<br />
Australians now pay no tax at all. / 13 </p>
<p>13'-<br />
And because of further tax reductions on July 1, all<br />
Australian taxpayers are now paying l~ ess tax.<br />
All this is only part of the catalogue of Government<br />
achievrrdents during the last five years.<br />
T~ hese achievements have lifted Australians to a new sense<br />
of confidence in our future.<br />
But this brings with it our -final challence in the decade<br />
ahead, the need to complement our responsibility in domestic<br />
management with a concerned and responsible stance in<br />
inter-national affairs.<br />
There i ot the S'ij~~ c4ub tL. hr u~ ou<br />
the major problem is going to be coming to terms wit~ h<br />
the reality of Soviet power, and Soviet attempts to expand<br />
their influence.<br />
You all know the Government's position on the Soviet invasion<br />
of Afghaistan, which has changed the strategic circumstances<br />
in which we live.<br />
As a result, we must increase the general level of defence<br />
preparedness and accept a higher real level of defence<br />
expenditure. We must selectively improve our overall operational capability<br />
for surveillance and deployments.<br />
In particular, following the invasion of Afghanistan, -the<br />
Indian Ocean has assumed a greater strategic significance.<br />
We are expanding the facilities at Cockburn Sound; and we<br />
have offered the use of these facilities to the if<br />
they so wish.<br />
As part of our five-year programme, significant defence<br />
decisions have already been made:<br />
* we have ordered a fourth FFG guided missile-frigate,<br />
and 75 new tactical fighters will be purchased;<br />
* all the Orion surveillance aircraft will be equipped<br />
to carry the harpoon anti-shipping missile;<br />
at a cost of around $ 80 million, a second underway<br />
replenishment ship will be built to enable our combat<br />
units to stay at sea for long and extLended-periods;<br />
* and we know we'll have the support of the whole<br />
community in expanding the Army Reserve to 30,000.<br />
by the middle of next year.<br />
In short, we must be more prepared for the uncertainties of<br />
the future. ./ 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
But this is only part of the story.<br />
success in meeting the Soviet reality will only come with<br />
a clear understanding of what it's all about.<br />
That places a responsibility on government to educate people<br />
to the challenges and dangers ahead.<br />
If, in a democracy, political leaders are not prepared to0<br />
do tnat; if they -seek to move witLh the popular view raither<br />
than argue for the right view, they are not fulfilling their<br />
duty and responsibiliLty to their owvn people.<br />
-! any countries share a commton perception about the dangErs<br />
in 1. iest Asia.<br />
Wqhat"-is now new, is that many more countries are also<br />
beginning to understand that there are similar dangers in<br />
South East Asia.<br />
People are looking at South West Asia and South East Asia as<br />
twin parts of the one problem.<br />
W1here formerly Europeans and others paid little attention to<br />
Iampuchea and its problems, now they are much more concerned<br />
about the reality of Soviet influence in Indo-China; and<br />
Soviet support for Vietnam's 220,000 troops in Kampuchea;<br />
support which is costing the Soviet Union $ 3 million a day or<br />
$ 1,000 million a year.<br />
There is a growing concern around the world about these dangers;<br />
a growing understanding that what's happening in Afghanistan<br />
and South West Asia is not unrelated to the expanding Soviet<br />
influence in Indo-China, and its increasing direct use of major<br />
Military bases in Vietnam itself.<br />
In recent years, new international initiatives have<br />
strengthened aid to refugees.<br />
Since the fall of Saigon in April 1975, nearly one million<br />
refugees h-ave fled Vietnam.<br />
Mo-re recently, the Vietnamese invasion of Kamouchea in<br />
September 1978 has led to the displacement of more than<br />
500,000 Kampucheans to United Nations camps or unofficial<br />
camps along the Thai -Kampuchc an border.<br />
The Russian invasion of Afghanistan has created refugees<br />
in excess 600,000.<br />
Indeed, the history of events since World War Two, including<br />
the Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and<br />
Afghanistan; and Soviet behaviour in Mlozambique, Ethiopia,<br />
Somalia and South East Asia; all these demonstrate the<br />
influence of Soviet policies on the staggering post war refugee<br />
tota--l of 13 million. </p>
<p>15<br />
No other regime, no other political philosophy, has everc<br />
shown such a capacity to create vast movements of refugees.<br />
Such a shameful legacy condemns the Soviet Union, its<br />
policies and its actions.<br />
It is the legacy of an alien regim e, which seeks to suppress<br />
the free will and spirit of men and women; a spirit which<br />
has never been, and will not, be suppressed.<br />
In this country, tens upon tens of thousands ofpel,<br />
who have come here, have directly experienced comimunist<br />
s uppre ssioen, and the extinction of democracy.<br />

that man's inifinite capacity to act with inhumanity to 11ims<br />
fellow man is not something of the.-past.<br />
Inhumanity and brutality have occurred all too often i'n<br />
the years since 1945.<br />
We must learn to see the world as it is, not as we would<br />
like it to be.<br />
As a wealthy country, we have a duty to do what. we can -to<br />
help.<br />
After the war, a massive refugee movement came to Australia;<br />
people who are now helping us to build a better, a greater<br />
and a more tolerant nation.<br />
And we will accept a further 20,000 this year, most of wahom<br />
will come from Indo-China. 40,000 South East Asian refugees have<br />
come to Australia since 1975. In assisting refugees from<br />
South-East Asia our response is more generous than that of any<br />
other Western country in relation to our size. a<br />
This is not only a source of pride,* but an indication of<br />
Australia's sense of international responsibility.<br />
In 1979, the Government recognised the severity of the<br />
suer _ Iign Kampuchea and called for seilrsos<br />
from Australia..<br />
Since September last year, when the first international appeals<br />
for assistance were launched, the Government has pledged and<br />
contributed over $ 14 million for humanitarian relief.<br />
We also decided to encourage public support for tue.<br />
Kamipucheain relief appeal by allowing donations made in 1979-80<br />
to qualify as tax deductions.<br />
This is the first occasion on which any Government has allowed<br />
tax deductibility for donations to foreign aid.<br />
Together with the Commonwealth Government, the Australian<br />
people have demonstrated their very real concern fL: or the humant<br />
and suffering of people in Indo-China. / 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
And we have been particularly active in seeking to stir<br />
other nations to do more to assist refugees from our own<br />
part of the world.<br />
Such programnes take into account our responsibility as<br />
members of the international community.<br />
This responsibility increases with our recognition that,<br />
in a difficult world order, we have much to be thankful<br />
for.<br />
Our strong and competitive economy has recharged our<br />
na" ional capcity; confirmed our success as a Covernment.<br />
,; aDther election lies betfore us; of great inportance<br />
especially for those of us with a deep faith and conviction<br />
about the future of Australia; with an idea and an ideal<br />
of what we want Australia to become.<br />
What happens to Australia in the 80s matters very much.<br />
We have a particular philosophy in which individual men and<br />
women are paramount; a philosophy which recognises that the<br />
end of government is not power or authority, but the service<br />
of people, their freedom and their dignity; their self-esteem<br />
and their capacity to lead rewarding lives.<br />
Your support in the weeks and months ahead is extremely<br />
important in the task of securing Australia's future.<br />
Your understanding of our policies; your knowledge of the<br />
difficult decisions; your advocacy and your defence of<br />
those policies and decisions all these are vital elements<br />
to our continued success.<br />
The Victorian Division of the Liberal Party has a proud record<br />
in its contribution to Federal and State Parliament; and in<br />
the strength of its unwaivering support in the cause of<br />
Liberalism. In recent times, we have secured significant electoral success.<br />
But elections that lie ahead are always more important than<br />
those already won.<br />
Every election needs to be fought with all the strength at<br />
our command.<br />
I know the full support of the Victorian Divisionwill be<br />
directed to that purpose.<br />
Australia has an unparalleled future.<br />
But one of the things we must never forget as Liberals, is<br />
that this future depends totally on our capacity to govern;<br />
on the idealism, on the strength and the vitality of the<br />
Liberal Party. ./ 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
We know what Labor did in three years; we know that<br />
their capacity for the destruction of our values, and<br />
our way of life is infinite.<br />
That places an even greater responsibility on us, as<br />
Liberals, to govemfairly, and for all the people of<br />
this nation; to see that what we achieve today, improves<br />
for our children, the quality of the life they will lead.<br />
Let us accept that challenge and pursue it single-mindedly;<br />
with energy, coimitment and success. 000---</p>
