FOR PRESS:-P. M. No. 67/ 1969<br />
AID FOR THE ARTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Government's intention to aid and encourage the<br />
highest possible national standards in the Arts is reflected by the<br />
substantially increased provision in the Budget for grants and other<br />
support through the Australian Council for the Arts.<br />
The allocation of 850, 000 for 1969-70 which<br />
represents an increase of 183, 651, or 71%, over expenditure<br />
last year, will provide for support in several new areas as well as<br />
for consolidation and extension of existing activities.<br />
The Government will continue to support the<br />
maintenance of national touring companies which will bring the best<br />
drama, music, ballet and opera to all States and allow talented<br />
Australian artists to make a professional career in this country.<br />
Public interest in the ballet and opera is increasing and the<br />
Government will therefore support the establishment of a second<br />
theatre orchestra to enable extended seasons to be provided by these<br />
companies throughout the Commonwealth.<br />
The Special Projects Fund established last year offered<br />
help to a wide variety of smaller companies based in the various<br />
States; it provided encouragement for playwrights, choreographers,<br />
composers and other creative workers. The Fund will be considerably<br />
extended in the coming year.<br />
The Government regards the matter of professional<br />
training in the Arts as of great importance, and will continue to<br />
support the national training schools in ballet and drama. Subject to<br />
the findings of a survey which is at present being carried out,<br />
support will also be provided for training schemes for theatre<br />
administrators and technical personnel and, in this coming year,<br />
the first steps will be taken towards establishing a national opera<br />
school to provide a flow of trained opera singers for the National<br />
Company and for other purposes. / 2 </p>

Many bodies such as the Australian Elizabethan Theatre<br />
Trust and the Arts Council of Australia ( Federal) provide a valuable<br />
service in bringing a variety of theatre and artistic activities to<br />
Australians in metropolitan areas and in the country. The Government<br />
will continue to provide support for these bodies through the Australian<br />
Council, and in particular it is hopeful of seeing the work of the Arts<br />
Council in country areas considerably expanded.<br />
The Government is looking at ways in which the Arts<br />
of the Australian Aboriginal might be fostered. It will provide support<br />
towards the establishment of a permanent professional group of<br />
Aboriginal dancers. This group will perform throughout the country,<br />
and will teach Aboriginal children the traditional culture of their people.<br />
In previous years Federal Government assistance to<br />
music has principally been channelled through the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Commission, whose valuable work has brought a wide<br />
variety of music to Australians through orchestral concerts and<br />
broadcasts. Assistance to composers has been provided through the<br />
Government's Advisory Board in this field. This year funds will also<br />
be made available for musical activities through the Australian Council<br />
for the Arts which will advise the Government on appropriate additional<br />
areas for support. In regard to film-making in Australia, the Government<br />
has accepted the recommendation of the Australian Council for the Arts<br />
that an Interim Council be established to investigate and report on the<br />
form and location of a National Film and Television Training School,<br />
and has provided $ 100, 000 for this purpose. The membership of the<br />
Interim Council, which will include a representative of the National<br />
Institute of Dramatic Art, will be announced shortly.<br />
The Council for the Arts has also formulated plans to<br />
encourage the making and exhibiting of short experimental films and<br />
provision of $ 200, 000 has been made in the Budget so that assistance<br />
in this direction will begin during the present financial year.<br />
