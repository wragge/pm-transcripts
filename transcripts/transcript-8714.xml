STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HlON P J KEATING MP<br />
URUGUAY ROUND: MESSAGE TO THlE G7<br />
At this critical time for thc success of Uruguay Round I have tonight conveyed to the<br />
leaders of the major world economics a communication signed by a large and<br />
representative STOUP of countries.<br />
It stresses the present danger to the world trading. syjtem and urges the leaders of the<br />
major economies to intervene now to settle the remaining differences in the Round.<br />
On behalf of these countries I[ have asked the leaders of the United States, Japan,<br />
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada, as well as the European<br />
Community and the Dircctor General of the GATT, to recognise that without urgent<br />
solutions the deadline for successfully completing Uruguay Round negotiations by the<br />
end of this year will not be met.<br />
it is quite remarkable and think extremely telling that this expression of grave<br />
concern conics from such a large and divcrsc group of countuics.<br />
It includes Hong Kong, Ncw Zealand, Chile, Singapore, Korea, Colombia, the<br />
Philippines, Czechoslovakia and all the Nordics, as well as Australia.<br />
It embraces most world economic regions, and widely different economies. Despite<br />
widely differing interests all in this group believe the benefits to flow from a Round<br />
outcome cannot be misscd and all share the desire to bring matters to a satisfactory<br />
close. A copy of the communication follows.<br />
Confirmed signatories at 6pm today were Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand,<br />
Chile, Singapore, Korea, Colombia, Thc Philippines, Czechoslovakia, Norway,<br />
Sweden, Finland and Iceland. By the time of release a number of other countries are<br />
expectcd to have confirmed their adherence to the communication.<br />

COVERING LETTER TO ALL G7 HEADS OF GOVERNMENT PLUS<br />
DELORS AND DUNKEL<br />
Dear I[ have been requested by a significant and representative group of active participants in<br />
the Uruguay Round negotiations to convey to you the attached declaration concerning<br />
the present impasse in the GATT negotiations.<br />
The signatory countrics believe that without urgent solutions to outstanding<br />
differences, the deadline for successfully completing thc Uruguay Round negotiations<br />
by the end of this year, which the G7 leaders committed themselves to in July, will not<br />
be met.<br />
The concern of signatory countries is that unless G7 leadcrs act now, the benefits of a<br />
successful outcome to the GATT round will be denied to the cntire international<br />
community with very serious implications for growth in a wide range of countries with<br />
diverse economic interests and for the future of the open world trading systemn.<br />
commend the attached declaration for your immediate attention.<br />

URUGUAY ROUND: A MESSAGE TrO THE G7<br />
When G7 leaders met in Munich they committed themselves to a<br />
year end deadline to finish the Uruguay Round. Without an<br />
urgent solution to outstanding differences this deadline will<br />
not be met and a successful conclusion to the entire Round<br />
will be put at risk. The Round cannot be allowed to fail<br />
through lack of political will on the part of 077 countries.<br />
The Uruguay Round has been stalemated since the Draft Final<br />
Act ( DFA) was tabled in December 1991. Already negotiations<br />
have dragged on for six years two years longer than we had<br />
all expected, denying the world economy the boost it urgently<br />
requires. Strenuous efforts have been made in recent ' months to resolve<br />
problems which key participants have with the agriculture<br />
package in the DFA. We understand that considerable progress<br />
has been made. The Round has, however, encountered political<br />
difficulties among major participants which are diverting us<br />
from the objectives to which we all committed our governments<br />
at Punta del Este and in Montreal, and which are holding back<br />
the work all participants must do to complete the<br />
negotiations. The benefits of the Round will Cover all sectors<br />
agriculture, market access, services and improved rules. All<br />
participants will gain. The world trading system cannot risk<br />
a failure of the Uruguay Round with all that would entail. A<br />
successful result is needed to promote global economic growth<br />
and to prevent a deterioration of the world trading system.<br />
it is crucial as well to the development aspirations of many<br />
developing and least developed countries and economies in<br />
transition. The remaining differences in our view are<br />
certainly bridgeable given the necessary commitment,<br />
flexibility and goodwill on all sides.<br />
The economic and trade interests at stake in these<br />
negotiations are not those of the G7 alone, but those of the<br />
entire international community. We all need the benefits that<br />
will flow from the Round package. Moreover the restructuring<br />
and liberalisation underway in many parts of the world could<br />
be seriously threatened if these processes are denied the<br />
encouragement provided by a strengthened GATT system. Delay<br />
in concluding the negotiations is already denying the benefits<br />
of the Round to the world economy and damaging the credibility<br />
of the multilateral system.<br />
we urge the leaders of the G7 countries to intervene now.<br />
Three successive communiques have confirmed G7 commitment to<br />
the Round. it is vital that immediate progress be made if the<br />
goal which was set at Munich of bringing the Bound to a<br />
successful conclusion by the end of 1992 is to be achieved. </p>
