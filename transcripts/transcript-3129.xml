NOTES FOR A SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT A D<br />
CIVIC LUNCH CASINO-MONDAY 14 JANUARY 1974<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR. ANTHONY FOR'INTRODUCING<br />
ME. I HAVE OBSERVED WITH INTEREST IN THE LAST WEERKTHE MOVES<br />
FOR HIS PARTY TO MERGE WITH ANOTHER SMALLER GROUP INTO WHAT<br />
IS BEING TERMED THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE. THESE MOVES HAVE THE<br />
SIGNIFICANCE OF SEEING THE SECOND NATIONAL ALLIANCE . TO COME<br />
ON TO THE POLITICAL SCENE IN AUSTRALIA. ' THOSE TWO WORDS COULD<br />
EASILY HAVE BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE THE LABOR PARTY FOR MANY<br />
YEARS, FOR THE LABOR PARTY HAS BEEN THE ONLY POLITICAL<br />
ORGANISATION IN AUSTRALIA WHICH CAN TRULY CLAIM TO REPRESENT<br />
AN ALLIANCE OF ALL OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. iR<br />
IT IS NOT A SECTION!_-PARTY. IT HAS ALWAYS<br />
" PRESEiTED PEOPLE THROUG'Ij. V OUR NATION AND NOT JUST THOSE<br />
' HO LIVE IN PART OF If. IT IS NEITHER A CITY PARTY ALONE NOR<br />
' IRRAL PARTY ALONE, IT . EPF.: CLNTS BOTH SECTIONS OF OUR<br />
0 COUNTRY, NOR IS IT SIMPLY A WORKING-CLASS PARTY, TO BE SURE<br />
' TS FOUNDATIONS LIE IN THE NEEDS OF WORKING MEN AND WE WILL<br />
S ALWAYS BE DEDICATED TO PRESERVING THEIR INTERESTS, BUT IT iS<br />
.' IJST AS MUCH CONCERNED WITH THE NEEDS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE<br />
CO23IMUNITY, . I MAKE THIS POINT BECAUSE I FEEL THERE HAS BEEN SOME<br />
-! DENCY, INEVITABLY PROMOTED BY OUR OPPONENTS, TO BRAND THE<br />
) R PARTY AS AN ANTI-RURAL PARTY,. THE TRUTH IS WE ARE<br />
"' Di \ TED TO THE CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF SELF-SUFFICIENT,<br />
: OS'pROUS AND FFcir; ' ST iNiiDS ' RIES<br />
4' ' l l </p>
<p>I S. 0' A<br />
TO ACHIEVE. THIS AIM WE ARE STRIVING TO IMPROVE THE DOMESTIC<br />
MARKET FOR. PRIMARY PRODUCE, TO CONSOLIDATE EXISTING EXPORT<br />
S MARKETS AND TO CREATE NEW MARKETS. ' I BELIEVE THAT THE LAST<br />
. YEAR HAS. UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN A SUCCESSFUL ONE IN THOSE TERMS.<br />
. CONTRARY-TO WHAT THE PREACHERS OFTHE RURAL-DOOMSDAY MIGHT.<br />
S SAY, PRIMARY INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA GENERALLY IS EXTREMELY<br />
BUOYANT. AT PRESENT. LET US LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF THIS.. ASSERTION<br />
THE. FIGURES FOR FARM INCOME IN AUSTRALIA. IN THE THREE<br />
YEARS ENDED 1969/ 70 . FARM INCOME AVERAGED ABOUT $ 1,050 M,<br />
" A YEAR. . THE ONSET OF DROUGHT AND DECLINING PRICES CAUSED<br />
FARM INCOME TO DROP TO $ 885 M. IN 1970/ 71 AND MANY PRODUCERS<br />
FACED SERIOUS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE<br />
BY AND LARGE BEEN COMPLETELY REVERSED AND THE CURRENT ESTIMATE<br />
i! FARM INCOME FOR 1973/ 74 IS $ 2,885 M. MORE THAN THREE TIMES<br />
AS GREPT AS IN 1970/ 71 AND WELL OVER DOUBLE THE AVERAGE INCOME<br />
FOR THE THREE YEARS BEFORE THEN.<br />
A SIMILAR PATTERN OF IMPROVEMENT CAN BE SEEN BY<br />
EXAMINING THE'FIGURES FOR EXPORTS OF RURAL ORIGIN, IN 1971/ 72<br />
AUSTRALIA EARNED $ 2,419.3 M. FROM THESE EXPORTS. IT IS<br />
ESTIMATED THAT IN 1973/ 74 THEY WILL BE WORTH .$ 3874.4 M.<br />
A VERY HEALTHY IMPROVEMENT. INDEED.<br />
ONE OF THE INDUSTRIES WHICH HAS BENEFITED PARTICULARLY<br />
' OM THE RESURGENCE OF OUR RURAL AREAS IS THE MEAT INDUSTRY, WHICH<br />
SATTRACTING INCREASING SUPPORT IN THIS, AREA. PRODUCTION OF<br />
BEEF AND VEAL HAS GROWN AND EXPORTS HAVE ALSO INCREASED QUITE<br />
,; 1AMitTICALLY. AUSTRALIA EXPORTED 339,000 TONNES OF BEEF AND<br />
VEAL IN 1970/ 71'. THIS GREW TO 585,000 TONNES IN 1972/ 73 AND<br />
CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT WE WILL EXPORT 658,000 TONNES IN </p>
<p>-3-<br />
1973/ 74 ALMOST A DOUBLING OF OUR EXPORT MARKET-IN THREE<br />
YEARS. ONE-INDUSTRY OF, CONCERN TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS<br />
AREA THE DAIRY INDUSTRY-HAS FACED CONTINUING PROBLEMS$<br />
I AM AWARE* THAT. OUR DECISION TO PHASE OUT THE DAIRY BOUNTY<br />
HAS AROUSED CRITICISM AMONG DAIRYING INTERESTS. HOWEVER,<br />
I WOULD EMPHASISE THAT THIS DECISION IS IN-LINE WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S CONVICTION THAT THE EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC<br />
FUNDS SHOULD BE PURPOSEFUL. IN OUR VIEW THE DAIRY BOUNTY<br />
HAD CEASED TO BE PURPOSEFUL. DESPITE THE OUTLAY OF $ 770 M.<br />
OVER THE YEARS THE BOUNTY HAD NOT CONTRIBUTED TO SOLVING<br />
THE INDUSTRY'S MAJOR PROBLEM THAT OF ADJUSTING FARM<br />
PRODUCTION TO REALISTIC LOCAL. AND OVERSEAS MARKET DEMAND.<br />
AS A WT.'! RE MEASURE THE BOUNTY PROVED INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE<br />
IE BULI CF -I , ENT TO THE LARGER AND WEALTHIER PRODUCERS<br />
WHO NEEDED IT LEAST, IT HAD ALSO BECOME BUILT INTO THE<br />
PRICE OF LAND AND OTHER DA! RY INPUTS AND-ADDED TO PRODUCTION<br />
COSTS. EVEN BEFORE THE BUDGET, THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE<br />
DAIRYING DIVISION OF THE VICTORIAN DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE<br />
HAD ARGUED THAT ANY BENEFITS FARMERS HAD RECEIVED FROM THE<br />
D ONTY HAD LONG BEEN CANCELLED OUT BY UNREALISTIC LAND<br />
PRICES AND OTHER CAPITAL GAINS. 4/<br />
a </p>
<p>WE HAVE DECIDED TO GET AWAY FROM AN OPEN-ENDED<br />
COMMITMENT. TO THE BOUNTY, WHICH IS LEAVING THE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
PROBLEMS OF THE INDUSTRY UNSOLVED4 AND TO PROVIDE MONEY TO<br />
STABILISE THE INDUSTRY SO THAT IT CAN STAND ON ITS OWN<br />
FEET. WE WILL DO THIS BY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE<br />
AND WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DEVELOP, ADJUSTMENT. PROPOSALS IN<br />
CONSULTATION WITH THE INDUSTRY. EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION<br />
HAS GONE ON ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY SINCE AUGUST AND OFFICERS<br />
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY HAVE VISITED'ABOUT<br />
FORTY GROUPS IN ALL STATES INCLUDING THE NORTH COAST REGION.<br />
THEY HAVE CONSULTED, AMONG OTHERS, THE CASINO CO-OPERATIVE<br />
DAIRY SOCIETY LIMITED, NORCO CO-OPERATIVE LIMITED, THE<br />
KYOGLE RURAL RE-CONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE, . THE NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
) AIRY FARMERS ASSOCIATION AND THE NEW SOUTH WALES DAIRY<br />

.100 SEPARATE , SUGGES: IOiS HAVE COME FROM'INDUSTRY SOURCES ANi;<br />
STATE AIITHORITIES. ' TEY COVER THE POSSIBLE BROADENIiG OF<br />
THE EXISTING-MARGiNAL DAIRY FARM RE-CONSTRUCTION SCHEME AND<br />
A HUiMBER OF PROPOSALS FOR ACTION AT BOTH FARM AND FACTORY<br />
LEVEL. THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS NOW GIVING TOP<br />
" RTORITY TO ANALYSING AND ASSESSING THE'MERITS OF THESE<br />
PROPOSALS AND THE POSSIBLE COSTS: IT iS DOING THIS IN THE<br />
. GHT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WISH THAT ADJUSTMENT EXPENDITURE<br />

THE POINT I HAVE TRIED TO STRESS IN MY REMARKS<br />
SO FAR IS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, AS ANY GOVERNMENT<br />
MUST, RECOGNISES THE VITAL IMPORYANCE OF OUR RURAL AREAS<br />
FOR THE WHOLE NATION. IN KEEPING WITH THIS RECOGNITION,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER THAT IT WOULD HOLD AN<br />
INQUIRY INTO ALL ASPECTS OF RURAL POLICY IN AUSTRALIA, THE<br />
INOIJIRY, TO BE CONDUCTED BY A WORKING GROUP, WILL RESULT IN<br />
THE FIRST GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED REPORT ON OVERALL RURAL<br />
POLICYISINCE THE PUBLICATION OF " AGRICUILTURAL PRODUCTION:<br />
AIMS AND POLICIES" BYTHE FORMER DEPARTMENT'OF COMMERCE AND<br />
AGRICULTURE IN 1952,0 OVER 20 YEARS AGO. A MAJOR BASIS FOR<br />
THE INQUIRY IS THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW THAT TH'ERE IS NO PLACE<br />
IN THE ECONOMY FOR A RURAL POLICY THAT IS NOT,-BOTH EQLJITAI3LE,<br />
FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS AND ECONOMICALLY' SOHIIND<br />
IN ANNOUNCING THE INQUIRY, THE MINISTER FOR<br />
