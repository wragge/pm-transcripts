PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 December 1985<br />
On 2 December the Minister for Territories announced the<br />
Government's intention to combine within a single<br />
Commonwealth portfolio most ACT administrative<br />
functions.<br />
The Government has today made a series of administrative<br />
arrangements changes which transfer a number of<br />
territorial matters to the Territories portfolio.<br />
The principal functions which have been transferred with<br />
effect from today are those relating to territorial<br />
health services and the ACT education system with the<br />
exception of post-secondary education. Certain other<br />
territorial functions which were previously the<br />
responsibility of the Minister for Housing and<br />
Construction, Local Government and Administrative<br />
Services, Primary Industry, and the Attorney-General<br />
have also been transferred.<br />
In relation to the transfer of the ACT health system, I<br />
have asked the Minister for Health, the Hon. Neil<br />
Blewett, to remain closely involved in the restructuring<br />
of the ACT Health Authority which has been carried out<br />
under his direction during this year. Dr Blewett's<br />
personal attention to ACT health matters contributed<br />
greatly to the resolution of the recent dispute with the<br />
nurses at Canberra hospitals.<br />
The opportunity has also been taken to transfer from the<br />
Minister for Territories two national functions. These<br />
are the Canberra National Memorials Committee and the<br />
National Botanic Gardens which will now be the<br />
responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and<br />
Environment. In addition, to assist in the integration of total ACT<br />
finances and the determination of priorities the<br />
Minister for Territories will be responsible for<br />
providing a co-ordinated overview of ACT activities and<br />
budgetary processes. These will be separately reported<br />
on an annual basis from 1986/ 87. </p>
<p>The Government sees these changes as being a significant<br />
step towards the establishment of the ACT Council, which<br />
is to operate from 1 January 1987.<br />
To achieve a smooth and speedy implementation of the<br />
administrative re-organisation, I have asked Senator<br />
Walsh, as Minister Assisting me for Public Service<br />
Matters, to oversee the changes and ensure that<br />
consequential questions of finance, staffing and<br />
location of staff are resolved without delay.<br />
A list of the changes is attached. </p>
