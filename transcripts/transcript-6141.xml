ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON R, J, HAWKE, AC, MiP,<br />
TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA<br />
27 JUNE 1983<br />
THE PRESIDENT'S INVITATION TO ADDRESS THE CLUB<br />
ON THIS OCCASION WAS PUT IN TERMS OF THE FIRST HUNDRED DAYS<br />
OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT. BUT ANYTHING I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE WORK OF<br />
THE FIRST HUNDRED DAYS SHOULD BE PLACED FIRMLY IN THE CONTEXT<br />
OF THE FIRST THOUSAND DAYS THAT ISj THE LONGER TERM<br />
OBJECTIVES THIS LABOR GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ACHIEVE.<br />
BECAUSE OUR MANDATE AND OUR COMMITMENT IS NOT<br />
ABOUT SOME SUPERFICIAL FLURRY OF ACTIVITY IN THE SHORT TERM,<br />
IT IS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO RESTORING GROWTH<br />
TO OUR NATION'IS ECONOMY, A COMMITMENT TO INCREASING EMPLOYMENT,<br />
TO TURNING THE TIDE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, AND A COMMITMENT TO<br />
ENSURING BOTH THAT THE BENEFITS OF RECOVERY ARE FAIRLY<br />
SHARED AND THAT THEY ARE NOT LOST IN A NEW BOUT OF INFLATION.<br />
IT IS A COMMITMENT INTERNATIONALLY TO THE<br />
PURSUIT OF AN INDEPENDENT, REALISTIC, CONSTRUCTIVE AND<br />
COHERENT FOREIGN POLICY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF OUR POSITION<br />
AS AN ALIGNED NATION. 12 </p>
<p>AND ABOVE ALL, IT IS A COMMITMENT<br />
AN UNSHAKEABLE COMMITMENT TO THE PURSUIT OF THE GREAT<br />
LABOR PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, SOCIAL,, POLITICAL AND<br />
ECONOMIC EQUITY, EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY, AND IN TIMES<br />
OF CRISIS LIKE THE PRESENT, EQUALITY OF SACRIFICE,<br />
AND ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS FIRST<br />
HUNDRED DAYS, HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO THE LAYING OF THE FIRM<br />
FOUNDATIONS AND MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONSi TO ENABLE<br />
THOSE COMMITMENTS TO BE FULFILLED IN THE NEXT THOUSAND DAYS,<br />
AND BEYOND. AND JUST AS OUR WORK SINCE THE FIFTH OF MARCH<br />
MUST BE PLACED IN THE FORWARD CONTEXT OF THE MONTHS AND<br />
YEARS TO COME, EQUALLY IT HAS TO BE JUDGED IN RELATION TO<br />
ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS BEFOREIN<br />
TERMS OF OUR GRIM INHERITANCE OF AUSTRALIA'S WORST<br />
ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR FIFTY YEARS.<br />
WE DIDN'T START WITH A CLEAN SLATE ON THE<br />
FIFTH OF MARCH, OR THE ELEVENTH OF MARCH WHEN WE WERE<br />
SWORN IN. ON THE CONTRARY, WE INHERITED THE WORST<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT, THE HIGHEST INTEREST RATES, ALMOST THE<br />
HIGHEST INFLATION ON RECORD, AND A GROSSLY IRRESPONSIBLE<br />
FISCAL SITUATION, AS REFLECTED IN THE PROJECTED BUDGET<br />
DEFICIT FOR 18-4 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AND TO IGNORE THESE REALITIES THE REALITIES<br />
OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE INHERITED, THE REALITIES WHICH<br />
WERE CONCEALED FROM THE PUBLIC BY OUR PREDECESSORS BEFORE<br />
AND DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN) AND THE REALITIES OF THE<br />
DIMENSIONS OF THE TASK AHEAD WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE<br />
JEOPARDISED AUSTRALIA'S CHANCES OF OVERCOMING ITS PROBLEMS,<br />
BUT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY UNDERMINED OUR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT<br />
ANY OF THE MAJOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS TO WHICH<br />
WE OF THE LABOR PARTY AND MOVEMENT, AND CERTAINLY THIS<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT, ARE SO DEEPLY COMMITTED.<br />
IN STRESSING THE BURDEN OF THE LIBERAL LEGACY<br />
AND THE CONSTRAINTS IT IMPOSES ON OUR DECISIONS, I DO NOT<br />
SEEK IN ANY WAY TO RETREAT FROM THE BASIC COMMITMENTS<br />
I MADE ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY FOUR MONTHS<br />
AGO. ON THE CONTRARY, THE VERY SIZE OF THE PROBLEM, AS<br />
REVEALED WHEN WE TOOK OFFICE, MAKES ALL THE MORE URGENT AND<br />
RELEVANT OUR CALL FOR NEW DIRECTIONS, NEW ATTITUDES AND<br />
NEW POLICIES AS ENCAPSULATED IN OUR THEME OF NATIONAL<br />
RECONCILIATION, NATIONAL RECOVERY AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
BUT, IN ESTABLISHING OUR NEW DIRECTIONS, WE<br />
HAVE HAD TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESSES OF CHANGE AND REFORM<br />
ARE NOT DISRUPTIVE AND INDEED, COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.<br />
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS BEHIND<br />
THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE THE FIRST GREAT STEP<br />
THAT SIGNALLED TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA THAT UNDER OUR<br />
GOVERNMENT THERE WOULD BE A NEW APPROACH, NEW POLICIES, NEW<br />
DIRECTIONS, AND A CONSENSUS FOR CHANGE AND REFORM. / 4<br />
C </p>
<p>BUT AS I SAID REPEATEDLY AT THE SUMMIT,<br />
POLICY CANNOT BE MADE IN A VACUUM. IN OUR SOCIETY,<br />
A REFORM GOVERNMENT LIKE OURS WILL ACHIEVE THE BEST<br />
RESULTS IF IN MOVING TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES OF<br />
DIRECTION INVOLVED IN OUR POLICIES AS WE ARE WE ALSO<br />
RECOGNISE THE ELEMENTS OF BASIC CONTINUITY WHICH<br />
CHARACTERI'SE OUR SOCIETY AND ITS EXPECTATIONS OF ANY<br />
GOVERNMENT. THAT WAY, THE REFORMS ARE LIKELY TO ENDURE<br />
LONGER. SO IS THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE THEME OF CHANGE AND CONTINUITY WAS ONEI<br />
SOUGHT TO TAKE UP THROUGHOUT THE MISSION OVERSEAS FROM<br />
WHICH I AND MY COLLEAGUES, AND MANY OF YOURS, HAVE JUST<br />
RETURNED. I WON'T TRESPASS MORE THAN NECESSARY ON YOUR<br />
QUESTION TIME BY GIVING YOU A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY ACCOUNT<br />
OF THE PLACES WE VISITED, OR BY SURVEYING MANKIND FROM<br />
CHINA TO PERU, WHICH WE DIDN'T VISIT.<br />
BUT I BELIEVE THE MISSION'S OVERALL ACHIEVEMENTAS<br />
WAS CERTAINLY ITS MAJOR PURPOSE WAS TO ESTABLISH IN<br />
THE CAPITALS I VISITED, AND THE LEADERS WITH WHOM I SPOKE,<br />
THE PRIMACY WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT ATTACHES To AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ROLE AND RELATIONS IN THIS REGION IN WHICH WE ARE PLACED<br />
FOREVER THE WESTERN PACIFIC REGION THE FASTEST-GROWING<br />
ECONOMIC REGION IN THE WORLD, </p>
<p>EVEN, OR RATHER ESPECIALLY, IN THE UNITED STATES<br />
WITH WHICH WE HAVE BILATERAL RELATIONS AND INTERESTS OF<br />
SUCH FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE, I SOUGHT TO GIVE THIS FOCUS<br />
AND PRIMARY PERSPECTIVE TO ALL MY DISCUSSIONS.<br />
LET ME EMPHASISE TWO POINTS.<br />
OUR RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, WITH ITS<br />
MANY DIMENSIONS, ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE,<br />
BUT EQUALLY, I EMPHASISED THAT OUR FOREIGN POLICIES WOULD<br />
INEVITABLY HAVE DIFFERENCES OF EMPHASIS, AND AT TIMES<br />
DIFFERENCES OF VIEWS, AND THAT ON SUCH ISSUES WE WOULD<br />
PUT OUR VIEWS FRANKLY. ON SUCH ISSUES AS INDOCHINA,<br />
CHINA, JAPAN, AND CENTRAL AMERICA I DID SO, INCLUDING IN<br />
MY ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB IN WASHINGTON.<br />
AND SECOND, AS I PUT IT AT THE NATIONAL<br />
PRESS CLUB: .11WE WILL PURSUE A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT FOREIGN<br />
POLICY, ONE WHICH RECOGNISES AND ACCEPTS THE<br />
CONSTRAINTS ON OUR CAPABILITY, AND THE LIMITATIONS<br />
OF OUR INFLUENCE. THAT MEANS, TO BE REALISTIC AND<br />
RELEVANT, THE FIRST PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OUR<br />
RELATIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS OF THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC<br />
REGION, AND TO THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES<br />
WITH WHICH WE SHARE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS,<br />
ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN." </p>
<p>IREPEAT AND EMPHASISE THE WORDS " REALISTIC<br />
AND RELEVANT" WHAT WE HAVE ALL GOT TO REALISE IS THAT<br />
OUR CONDUCT NOW IN OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD,<br />
WILL DETERMINE OUR ROLE IN OUR REGION FOR THE REST OF<br />
THIS CENTURY AND FAR BEYOND,<br />
AND IF WE CANNOT COME TO TERMS WITH OUR<br />
OWN REGION AS A CONSTRUCTIVE AND CO-OPERATIVE NEIGHBOURi<br />
WE WOULD BE CONDEMNING OURSELVES TO THE WORST OF ALL<br />
POSSIBLE WORLDS. HAVING SHED OUR TRADITIONAL DEPENDENCE<br />
ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC, WE SHOULD HAVE FAILED TO FIND<br />
A TRULY INDEPENDENT, RELEVANT AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN<br />
THE WESTERN PACIFIC REGION TO WHICH WE BELONG,<br />
LET ME HERE SHARE WITH YOU SOME BASIC ELEMENTS<br />
OF OUR THINKING ON THE QUESTION OF AUSTRALIA'S REGIONAL ROLE,<br />
PARTICULARLY AS THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA,<br />
OUR NEAR NEIGHBOUR AND THE FIFTH MOST POPULOUS NATION<br />
ON EARTH. WE HAVE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAPUA<br />
NEW GUINEA NONE MORE SO THAN A LABOR GOVERNMENT. THERE<br />
CAN BE NO FOUNDATION FOR SOUND RELATIONS BETWEEN PAPUA NEW<br />
GUINEA AND INDONESIA UNLESS THERE ARE SOUND RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA, 17<br />
-6-Y. -pmi w </p>
<p>FURTHER, OUR REGIONAL ROLE ABSOLUTELY<br />
REQUIRES THAT VIE HAVE PRODUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH THE MEMBER<br />
NATIONS OF ASEAN ONE OF THE WORLD' S MOST VALUABLE,<br />
SUCCESSFUL AND VIABLE REGIONAL GROUPINGS. PRODUCTIVE<br />
RELATIONS WITH ASEAN ARE AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY WITHOUT<br />
SOUND RELATIONS WITH ITS MOST POWERFUL MEMBER.<br />
WITHOUT SUCH RELATIONS, WE CAN HAVE NO INFLUENCE<br />
WHATSOEVER IN INDOCHINA, OR EFFECTIVENESS IN TRYING TO DO<br />
WHAT WE CAN TO ALLEVIATE THE HUMAN TRAGEDY IN THAT AREA.<br />
* 1 IN SHORT, IF AUSTRALIA CANNOT ESTABLISH<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS ' WITH ITS NEAR AND MOST POPULOUS<br />
NEIGHBOUR, THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS WHOLE FOREIGN POLICY<br />
WOULD BE SERIOUSLY DIMINISHED.<br />
THIS IS THE REALITY; AND IT IS THAT SENSE<br />
; OF REALISM WHICH I SEEK TO ESTABLISH FOR AUSTRALIA BOTH<br />
AT HOME AND ABROAD. BUT WHEN I SAY REALISM, IAM NOT ADVOCATING<br />
SOME SORT OF REALPOLITIK. No-ONE IS BEING ASKED TO SACRIFICE ANY<br />
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. BUT REALISM IS JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR LACK OF<br />
HYPOCRISY AND HUMBUG. </p>
<p>IN THE WHOLE FIELD OF OUR INTERNATIONAL<br />
RELATIONSHIPS, I WANT AUSTRALIAN POLICY TO BE FREE OF THE<br />
HYPOCRISY OF THE PAST, ESPECIALLY THE PAST SEVEN YEARS<br />
THE SORT OF HYPOCRISY WHICH CHARACTERISED PREVIOUS LIBERAL<br />
GOVERNMENTS' CONDUCT OVER AFGHANISTAN AND THE SOVIET<br />
UNION, VIETNAM, AND, AT AN EARLIER PERIOD OF OUR HISTORY,<br />
THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND WEST IRIAN.<br />
TRUE IT IS THAT THOSE WHO FORGET THE LESSONS<br />
AND ERRORS OF HISTORY ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT THEM.<br />
AND IT IS AN ERROR FoR A GovERNIIENI IN FOREIGN<br />
POLICY MAKING, TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES,<br />
OR, IN PURSUIT OF A DOCTRINE, TO FORGET WHAT IS ACTUALLY<br />
SOUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED. AND THE OBJECTIVES SET MUST BE<br />
REALISTIC AND ATTAINABLE.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT WE ARE ULTIMATELY CONCERNED<br />
WITH IN EAST TIMOR IS THE HUMANITARIAN INTERESTS OF<br />
THE PEOPLE OF THAT AREA. </p>
<p>WE SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE CURRENT DISCUSSIONS<br />
BETWEEN THE INDONESIAN AUTHORITIES AND FRETILIN, WHICH HAVE<br />
ONLY NOW BEEN REPORTED PUBLICLY, WILL FURTHER IMPROVE<br />
THE SITUATION IN EAST TIMOR,<br />
ON VIETNAM, WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT COUNTRY<br />
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MAINSTREAM OF THE LIFE OF THE REGION<br />
AND RETURN FROM ISOLATED DEPENDENCE ON THE SOVIET UNION,<br />
INTO THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.<br />
AND WE WANT TO HELP BRING AN END TO THE<br />
SUFFERING AND HUMAN TRAGEDY IN CAMBODIA.<br />
THESE ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY. THERE WILL BE NO ABROGATION OF THEM.<br />
AND BEYOND THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS OF OUR<br />
NErGHBOURHOOD AND REGION, THERE IS A ROLE WE CAN PLAY<br />
AND SHOULD PLAY IN THE GREAT UNIVERSAL QUESTIONS<br />
ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT AND THE ULTIMATE<br />
QUESTION OF THE SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY.<br />
1I . I. 1. 1. 1. -I .1 .1 </p>
<p>I MADE IT VERY CLEAR IN PARIS AND WASHINGTON<br />
THAT THIS GOVERNMENT UNEQUIVOCALLY OPPOSES FRENCH NUCLEAR<br />
TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.<br />
ON THE QUESTION OF THE SOUTH HEST PACIFIC<br />
NUCLEAR FREE ZONE, WHICH I RAISED IN WASHINGTON, I CAN SAY<br />
THAT, WHILE IT IS AN INITIATIVE THAT THE UNITED STATES<br />
WOULD NOT TAKE ITSELF,, THEY UNDERSTAND IT,<br />
AND RECOGNISE THAT OUR PROMOTION OF THE PROPOSAL IS COMPATIBLE<br />
WITH OUR MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER ANZUS,<br />
BUT AGAIN, IT HAS TO BE RECOGNISED THAT IF<br />
AUSTRALIA IS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MATTERS OF GLOBAL IMPORTANCE<br />
LIKE THESE, THEN WE MUST FIRST HAVE CREDIBILITY IN OUR<br />
OWN REGION. I REPEAT: THERE IS TO BE NO SACRIFICE OF<br />
PRINCIPLE BUT THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THIS GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
BE BASED ON REALISM AND RELEVANCE,<br />
AND IT WAS IN THAT CONTEXT THAT I SOUGHT TO<br />
PLACE AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL ROLE UNDER THE NEW GOVERNMENT<br />
THROUGHOUT MY MISSION. t : p t 17 W </p>
<p>-11<br />
ANOTHER THEME I EXPRESSED WAS THE THEME OF<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE THE BASIC INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS,<br />
THEIR ECONOMIES AND THEIR SOCIETIES.<br />
THAT THEME, AGAIN,; I WAS INTENT TO RELATE TO<br />
OUR OWN REGION AND AUSTRALIA'S ROLE IN IT.-<br />
ONE IMPORTANT CONCLUSION FROM ALL MY DISCUSSIONSFROM<br />
PORT MORESBY To HONOLULU WAS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH ARE MOST DAMAGING TO THE<br />
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE PRECISELY THE SAME PROBLEMS MOST<br />
DAMAGING TO US ALL: PROLONGED INTERNATIONAL RECESSION;<br />
AND PARTLY AS A CAUSE OF RECESSION AND PARTLY AS A PROBLEM<br />
IN ITSELF FOR COUNTRIES WITH FOREIGN DEBT TO SERVICE,<br />
HIGH REAL INTEREST RATES,<br />
NONE OF THE ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES HAS<br />
FELT THESE PROBLEMS MORE ACUTELY THAN FRANCE. THE<br />
FRENCH EXPERIENCE IS INSTRUCTIVE.<br />
FRANCE VIGOROUSLY IMPLEMENTED HIGHLY EXPANSIONARY<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS IN RECESSION.<br />
THERE WAS A MARGINAL AND TEMPORARY IMPROVEMENT IN GROWTH AND<br />
EMPLOYMENT. BUT SOON THERE WAS A MASSIVE CRISIS IN THE<br />
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, WHICH HAS REQUIRED THE SUDDEN IMPOSITION<br />
OF CONTRACTIONARY POLICIES, WITH A SHARP RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
THE PRICE AND THE INITIAL BENEFIT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE. / 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THE FRENCH SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT,<br />
THROUGH ITS CURRENT ECONOMIC PROGRAM, WILL GET ON TOP OF<br />
ITS DIFFICULTIES. WE SHOULD DRAW IHE RIGHT LESSONS FROM<br />
THE FRENCH EXPERIENCE. WE NEED NOT AND WILL NOT RETREAT<br />
FROM THE USE OF EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICIES AS PART OF<br />
OUR RESPONSE TO RECESSION. BUT THE EXPANSION MUST BE<br />
CAREFULLY CALCULATED, TO LIMIT PRESSURES ON FINANCIAL MARKETS<br />
AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. OTHERWISE ANY SHORT-TERM GAIN<br />
WILL BE WORSE THAN LOST.<br />
AND THE DEGREE OF FISCAL EXPANSION WE PROPOSE<br />
CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF OUR PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY IS<br />
SUCCESSFUL. ECONOMIC ISSUES WERE A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE VISIT<br />
TO THE UNITED STATES, WHERE I WAS JOINED BY THE TREASURER.<br />
IN OPEN AND INFORMATIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY ECONOMIC<br />
OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS LEADERS WE WERE ABLE TO ASSESS THE<br />
PROSPECTS OF RECOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO EXPLAIN<br />
OUR APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
THE ECONOMIC NEWS WE RECEIVED IN THE U. S. WAS VERY POSITIVE<br />
FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE,<br />
THE RECOVERY IN THE U. S. WHICH FINALLY GOT<br />
UNDER WAY JUST BEFORE THE TURN OF i. AST YEAR HAS GATHERED<br />
STRENGTH MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN MOST OBSERVERS IN THE U. S.<br />
OR AUSTRALIA ANTICIPATED. / 13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
THIS HAS SINCE BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE U. S.<br />
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WITH THE ISSUE OF A PRELIMINARY<br />
ESTIMATE THAT REAL GNP WILL GROW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF<br />
6.6 PERCENT IN THE JUNE QUARTER FOLLOWING A RISE OF<br />
2,6 PERCENT IN THE MARCH QUARTER.<br />
THERE IS GROWING CONFIDENCE THAT THE RECOVERY<br />
WILL BROADEN AND CONTINUE INTO 1984.<br />
NONETHELESS, THERE IS THE NEED FOR A CAVEAT<br />
OR TWO. THERE ARE ALREADY SOME SIGNS OF EMERGING<br />
PRESSURES ON INTEREST RATES.<br />
TO AN EXTENT, THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED IN THE COURSE<br />
OF AN ECONOMIC RECOVERYj PARTICULARLY ONE AS SHARP AS THAT<br />
APPARENT IN THE U. j AND CERTAINLY THE U. S. ECONOMY IS<br />
BETTER PLACED TO HANDLE INTEREST RATE INCREASES NOW THAN<br />
IT HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME.<br />
BUT THERE IS SOME RISK THAT WITHOUT CHANGES IN<br />
UNITED STATES FISCAL POLICY) LARGE INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES<br />
MIGHT THREATEN RECOVERY IN THE COURSE OF 19384, PRESIDENT<br />
MITTERRANDi PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE<br />
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK., PAUL VOLCKER, ALL EMPHASISED THAT<br />
RECOVERY IN OTHER COUNTRIES WAS MORE VULNERABLE TO INTEREST<br />
RATE PRESSURES DERIVING FROM UNITED STATES BUDGET DEFICITS THAN<br />
WAS UNITED STATES RECOVERY ITSELF. </p>
<p>i4l-<br />
OUR OWN VIEW, WHICH I EXPRESSED PUBLICLY<br />
AT THE FOREIGN POLICY ASSOCIATION IN NEW YORK, IS THAT<br />
FINANCIAL PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE STRUCTURAL<br />
BUDGET DEFICITS DO REPRESENT A THREAT TO WORLDWIDE<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE ONE OR TWO YEARS AHEAD, HOWEVER,<br />
WE SEE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CORRECTION OF THIS PROBLEM<br />
AS LYING WITH THE WHOLE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND NOT<br />
WITH THE UNITED STATES ALONE.<br />
LET ME TURN NOW TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE<br />
DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
A SUSTAINED U. S. RECOVERY, PARTICULARLY IF<br />
IT IS REINFORCED BY THE PICK UP IN ACTIVITY NOW EXPECTED<br />
IN A NUMBER OF OTHER INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES, WILL OF COURSE<br />
PROVIDE A BOOST TO WORLD TRADE VOLUMES, COMMODITY PRICES<br />
AND, ULTIMATELY, FOREIGN INVESTMENT FLOWS.<br />
THAT EVENTUALLY SHOULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL<br />
DIRECT STIMULUS TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, PRINCIPALLY BY<br />
WAY OF STRONGER DEMAND FOR OUR EXPORTS AND REDUCED EXTERNAL<br />
PRESSURE ON OUR IMPORT COMPETING SECTORS.<br />
IN THE COURSE OF 1983-84l, IT CAN BE EXPECTED TO<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO THE INCREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICIES, THE ENDING<br />
OF THE DROUGHT AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER AND BUSINESS<br />
CONFIDENCE APPARENT SINCE THE SUMMIT, </p>
<p>ALL THIS STRENGTHENS OUR VIEW THAT THE<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR WHICH BEGINS THIS WEEK WILL MARK A DECISIVE<br />
WATERSHED BETWEEN PAST YEARS OF STAGNATION AND FUTURE<br />
YEARS OF GROWTH IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
IT CONFIRMS OUR CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE WELL ON<br />
TRACK TOWARDS ACHIEVING OUR KEY ELECTION COMMITMENTS TO<br />
ARREST THE EXPLOSION IN UNEMPLOYMENT; THEN TO REDUCE THE<br />
RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT OVER THE LIFE OF OUR FIRST GOVERNMENT;<br />
AND ALONG THE WAY, TO CREATE HALF A MILLION NEW JOBS<br />
OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, AS IN THE WORLD AS A WHOLE,<br />
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER GROWTH CAN BE SUSTAINED FOR<br />
THE LONG PERIOD NECESSARY TO RESTORE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS<br />
OF EMPLOYMENT. / 116 </p>
<p>-16-<br />
OUR PRIVATE INVESTMENT NEXT YEAR IS<br />
EXPECTED TO REPRESENT ONLY ABOUT 13.4 PERCENT OF GDP.<br />
THAT'S MORE THAN ONE PERCENTAGE POINT BELOW THE AVERAGE<br />
OF THE LAST DECADE. THIS HELPS US TO RUN LARGER<br />
FISCAL DEFICITS THAN NORMAL WITHOUT PLACING UNDUE PRESSURES<br />
ON FINANCIAL MARKETS, 14E HAVE INDICATED THAT WE HAVE<br />
BEEN PREPARED TO CONSIDER A DEFICIT TO ABOUT $ 8.5 BILLION<br />
IN 1983-84. THIS WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT 5 PERCENT OF GDP,<br />
WHICH WOULD BE THE HIGHEST RATIO EVER, THIS HIGH LEVEL<br />
OF COMMONWEALTH BORROWING WOULD COINCIDE WITH UNUSUALLY<br />
HIGH LEVELS OF BORROWING BY THE STATES AND OTHER PUBLIC<br />
AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICY<br />
ALONG THESE LINES CAN BE CONTEMPLATED WITHOUT DISASTROUS<br />
CONSEQUENCES IN FINANCIAL MARKETS WHILE PRIVATE INVESTMENT<br />
REMAINS SO LOW. BUT THE BUILDING OF STRONG AND DURABLE<br />
RECOVERY THE SORT OF SUSTAINED RECOVERY THAT WILL<br />
DELIVER HALF A MILLION NEW JOBS OVER THREE YEARS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL REQUIRE THE RESTORATION OF HIGH LEVELS<br />
OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THAT GROWTH WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE<br />
117l </p>
<p>-17-<br />
IF THERE ARE FURTHER INCREASES IN REAL INTEREST RATES;<br />
AND THIS WILL OCCUR IF BUDGET DEFICITS REMAIN AT PRESENT<br />
LEVELS AS PRIVATE INVESTMENT STRENGTHENS IN RECOVERY,<br />
TiiUS WE BELIEVE THAT SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE<br />
NEAR FUTURE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY MEASURES TO HAUL IN<br />
THE STRUCTURAL BUDGET DFFICIT AS RECOVERY PROCEEDS IN THE<br />
YEARS AHEAD. AUSTRALIA WILL BE AFFECTED BY PRESSURES IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETSj WHATEVER HAPPENS AT HOME.<br />
AUSTRALIAN REAL INTEREST RATES WILL TEND TO RISE IF UNITED<br />
STATES REAL INTEREST RATES RISE, BUT CONDITIONS WITHIN<br />
OUR OWN FINANCIAL MARKETS CAN EXACERBATE OR AMELIORATE THE<br />
PRESSURES COMING FROM OVERSEAS. GIVEN THE CONSIDERABLE<br />
PROSPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WILL EXERT UPWARD<br />
PRESSURE ON AUSTRALIAN INTEREST RATES OVER THE NEXT ONE OR<br />
TWO YEARS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO NOT COMPOUND THE<br />
THREAT TO THE RECOVERY OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT.<br />
THE FISCAL STANCE THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED<br />
BY THE TREASURER AND MYSELF IN RECENT MONTHS IS EXPANSIONARY<br />
BY ANY REASONABLE STANDARDS. MORE RAPID FISCAL EXPANSION<br />
MIGHT POSSIBLY LEAD TO SLIGHTLY FASTER GROWTH IN ACTIVITY<br />
AND EMPLOYMENT'IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, BUT WE WOULD BUY<br />
THIS POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT AT THE COST OF SUBSTANTIAL RISK<br />
TO THE DURABILITY OF RECOVERY. </p>
<p>-18-<br />
WiE OWE IT To AUSTRALIANS WITHOUT JOBS<br />
AND WE OWE IT TO OUR COMMITMENT TO CREATE HALF A MILLION<br />
JOBS OVER THREE YEARS TO REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS<br />
OF RESPONSIBILITY, I MAY SAY THAT IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED<br />
STATES, THE TREASURER'S MAY STATEMENT WAS WIDELY SEEN<br />
AS MAKING A MAJOR EFFORT TOWARDS REDUCING THE STRUCTURAL<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT IN 1984-85 AND 1985-86.<br />
BUT THE MAY STATEMENT DID MUCH MORE THAN ADDRESS<br />
THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WE INHERITED, IT PUT INTO EFFECT<br />
MEASURES DESIGNED TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION<br />
SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT MADE A START TO REVERSE THE SYSTEMATIC<br />
BIAS AGAINST LOWER-INCOME AUSTRALIANS THE FRASER YEARS<br />
HAD INTRODUCED INTO OUR FISCAL SYSTEM. OUR ECONOMIC<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE RESTRAINT; AND THE MAY STATEMENT<br />
PLACED THAT RESTRAINT ON AUSTRALIANS WHO WERE IN A RELATIVELY<br />
GOOD POSITION TO ACCEPT IT. THIS IS WHY WE FOUND IT NECESSARY<br />
TO REMOVE CERTAIN BENEFITS ON HOUSING, PENSIONS AND<br />
SUPERANNUATION FOR RELATIVELY WELL-OFF AUSTRALIANS.<br />
IT IS WHY WE MOVED SO QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT OUR COMMUNITY<br />
EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM AND HOUSING POLICY. NOT ONLY WERE<br />
WE PREPARED TO TAKE HARD DECISIONS IN THE INTERESTS OF<br />
FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DURABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY, BUT WE<br />
DID THIS IN A WAY WHICH EXPRESSED LABOR'S COMMITMENT TO<br />
SOCIAL EQUITY. </p>
<p>-19-<br />
RECENTLY WE HAVE HEARD SOME EXTRAORDINARY<br />
NONSENSE ABOUT OUR FISCAL POLICIES BEING DOMINATED BY<br />
TREASURY AND INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF OUR<br />
PREDECESSORS. MAY I JUST POINT OUT THE DECISIVE CHANGES<br />
IN AT LEAST FOUR AREAS. FIRST, THE OVERALL STANCE OF<br />
POLICY IS CLEARLY EXPANSIONARY UNLIKE ALL BUT THE<br />
LAST OF THE FRASER YEARS. SECOND, WE HAVE INTRODUCED<br />
FISCAL POLICY CHANGES TO REDISTRIBUTE THE BURDEN OF<br />
RESTRAINT, FROM THE NEEDY IN OUR SOCIETY, TO THOSE WHO<br />
ARE BEST ABLE TO BEAR IT. THIRD, THE TIRED OLD<br />
DOCTRINE OR AT LEAST ITS RHETORICAL FLOURISHESABOUT<br />
FIGHTING INFLATION FIRST HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A<br />
GENUINE AND STRONG COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING INFLATION AND<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND FOURTH, THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT MEANS WHAT IT SAYS: WHEN WE SAY THAT WE<br />
WILL HAUL BACK THE BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE COURSE OF<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE MEAN EXACTLY THAT. </p>
<p>THE F[ RST OF THESE POINTS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO<br />
INTELLIGENT OBSERVERS, LAST FINANCIAL YEAR THE BUDGET DEFICIT<br />
WAS HALF A BILLION DOLLARS, ONE YEAR AGO, IN THE AUGUST<br />
BUDGET, IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR IS DEFICIT<br />
WOULD BE $ 1.7 BILLION, THAT FIGURE HAS SINCE BLOWN OUT TO<br />
ABOUT $ 14.6 BILLION, AND YET SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT A<br />
FURTHER INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT TO LEVELS SUGGESTED IN SCENARIO<br />
A AT THE SUMMIT, THAT IS TO $ 8.5 BILLION, WOULD NOT BE<br />
EXPANSIONARY. IF THE DEFICIT WERE INCREASED TO $ 8.5 BILLION<br />
NEXT YEAR, THE INCREAS OVER TWO YEARS WOULD REPRESENT ALMOST<br />
PER CENT OF GDP, THIS WOULD BE AN EXTRAORD'TNARY SHIFT<br />
TOWARDS EXPANSIONARY POLICIES. FURTHERMORE, AROUND HALF<br />
OF THE INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT WOULD REPRESENT DISCRETIONARY<br />
ADJUSTMENTS IN FISCAL POLICY, AND NOT MERELY THE CYCLICAL<br />
EFFECTS OF RECESSION ON SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS AND TAXATION<br />
RECEIPTS. DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT<br />
TOLD THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
FACING A DEFICIT OF $ 6 BILLION IN 1983-84, ON THAT BASIS, WE<br />
SAID THAT WE COULD SAFELY COTEMPLATE A DEFICIT OF $ 7.5 BILLION,<br />
NO-ONE CONTESTED THAT THIS WOULD BE EXPANSIONARY. As You KNOW,<br />
ON COMING TO OFFICE, WE RECEIVED ADVICE THAT ON UNCHANGED<br />
LIBERAL POLICIES THE DEFICIT WOULD HAVE BEEN $ 9.6 BILLION IN<br />
/ 21 </p>
<p>-21-<br />
1983-84, THIS FIGURE REMAINS BROADLY RELEVANT DESPITE<br />
THE INEVITABLE UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE<br />
ESTI-MATE S. IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND TO FURTHER ASSESSMENT<br />
OF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE INDICATED THAT WE<br />
MAY SETTLE FOR A 1983-84 DEFICIT THAT IS HIGHER THAN<br />
BILLION. FACTS DON'T MATTER TO SOME PEOPLE. THROUGH<br />
SOME INTELLECTUAL CONTORTION,. A $ 7.5 BILLION DEFICIT CAN<br />
BE EXPANSIONARY IN MARCH WHILE A HIGHER DEFICIT IS<br />
CONTRACTIONARY IN APRIL. ./ 22 </p>
<p>-22-<br />
THIS WEEK OF COURSE, WE ARE HAVING OUR<br />
FIRST PREMIERS' CONFERENCE AND LOAN COUNCIL MEETING.<br />
FOR OUR PART, WE ARE APPROACHING THAT<br />
CONFERENCE WITH A DETERMINATION TO MAKE IT, NOT AS IT HAS<br />
BEEN FOR SO MANY YEARS, AN OCCASION FOR CONFRONTATION AND<br />
CONFLICT, BUT FOR GENUINE CO-OPERATION AND CONSTRUCTIVENESS<br />
TO THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF THE NATION AND THE STATES<br />
WHICH CONSTITUTE THE NATION,<br />
THE STATES, LIKE THE COMMONWEALTH, ARE<br />
GRAPPLING WITH SEVERE BUDGETARY PROBLEMS, WE WILL DO<br />
OUR BEST TO HELP OUT, WITHIN THE OVERALL LIMITS OF FISCAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY. WE CERTAINLY DO NOT INTEND TO PASS OUR<br />
OWN BUDGETARY PROBLEMS ON TO THE STATES BY AN UNBALANCED<br />
APPROACH TO THIS WEEK'I S MEETINGS. BUT WE SHOULD ALL<br />
BE CLEAR THAT THE TOTAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US<br />
CANNOT BE INCREASED TO ACCOMMODATE INCREASED PAYMENTS TO<br />
THE STATES. AN EXTRA DOLLAR IN RESOURCES MADE AVAILABLE<br />
TO THE STATES MEANS A DOLLAR LESS FOR OUR OWN PROGRAMS,<br />
OR A DOLLAR INCREASE IN COMMONWEALTH TAXATION. ./ 23<br />
r </p>
<p>-23-<br />
LET ME CONCLUDE IN THIS WAY.<br />
THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE FIRST HUNDRED DAYS,<br />
AND THE EXPERIENCE OF MY FIRST OFFICIAL MISSION OVERSEAS<br />
AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, HAVE AMPLY REINFORCED<br />
TWO FUNDAMENTAL CONVICTIONS I HELD LONG BEFORE THE<br />
ELECT IONS. THEY BOTH CONCERN THE ROLE AND FUTURE OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,<br />
FIRST, I HAVE LONG HELD THE VIEW THAT THE<br />
ELECTIONS FOR THE 33RD PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA THAT<br />
IS, THE ELECTION FOR THIS PRESENT PARLIAMENT, THE<br />
ELECTION SO PRECIPITATELY FORCED ON THE FIFTH OF MARCHWOULD<br />
DETERMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF FORMING A FEDERAL<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO GENUINE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC,<br />
AND POLITICAL REFORM IN AUSTRALIA, FOR LONG, LONG YEARS<br />
TO COME. se/ 2<br />
T~ </p>
<p>AND SECOND; AND SURELY RECENT EXPERIENCES<br />
IN BRITAIN AND FRANCE THE ROUT IN BRITAIN AND THE<br />
REVISION OF POLICY IN FRANCE CAN ONLY CONFIRM THIS,<br />
I PROFOUNDLY BELIEVE THAT THE WORK AND EFFORTS,, THE<br />
EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIMENTS, THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE<br />
OF THIS AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT, ARE CRITICALLY<br />
IMPORTANT TO THE WHOLE FUTURE OF THE LABOR CAUSE, THE<br />
CAUSE OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY, THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRIALISED<br />
WORLD. IDO BELIEVE THAT. IN TERMS OF A CONTEMPORARY PARTY,<br />
GRAPPLING WITH CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS IN A CONTEMPORARY WAY,<br />
WE REPRESENT, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, THE BEST HOPE OF<br />
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD TODAY. THAT IS ANOTHER REASON<br />
Wi-IY* WE DARE NOT FAIL.<br />
THAT AT LEAST IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY IN THESE CRITICAL 1980s.<br />
IT IS BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING SUCH AS I HAVE OF THE<br />
LABOR PARTY'S NATURE AND PURPOSE. AND PERHAPS AFTER AN<br />
ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP OF THIRTY-SIX YEARS, AFTER FIVE YEARS AS<br />
NATIONAL PRESIDENT, AND TEN YEARS AS LEADER OF THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
LABOR MOVEMENT IN THIS NATION, IT MAY EVEN BE ACKNOWLEDGED<br />
THAT I HAVE SOME GLIMMER OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTY<br />
AND THE MOVEMENT. Ll </p>
<p>BE THAT AS IT MAY, MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE<br />
PARTY AND ITS ASPIRATIONS CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM MY<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATION AND ITS ASPIRATIONS, IT IS<br />
PRECISELY BECAUSE THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY IS SO<br />
INTEGRAL TO THE WHOLE LIFE AND FABRIC OF THIS NATION,<br />
THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE ONE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING<br />
THE OTHER. AND WHILE THE HISTORIC ROLE OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY IN GOVERNMENT OR OPPOSITION HAS BEEN TO<br />
SET THE NATIONAL AGENDA FOR CHANGE AND REFORM, THE PEOPLE<br />
THEMSELVES WILL ALWAYS ASSERT THEIR ULTIMATE RIGHT TO<br />
DETERMINE THE PACE.<br />
AND IT IS UPON THAT UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THE<br />
PARTY AND THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE PROCEEDED IN THESE<br />
FIRST ONE HUNDRED DAYS; AND IT IS ON THAT UNDERSTANDING<br />
WE SHALL CONTINUE TO PROCEED. IBELIEVE IT CAN ALREADY BE<br />
SAID THAT NO PEACE-TIME GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA HAS IN SUCH<br />
A SHORT TEME MORE DEFINITIVELY ESTABLISHED ITS STANCE IN<br />
THE FUNDAMENTAL MATTERS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY AND<br />
INTERNATIONAL POLICY.<br />
AND IN MAKING THAT SUSTAINABLE CLAIM I ASSERT<br />
WITH EQUAL CONVINCTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASSISTED BY THE FACT<br />
THAT WE HAVE A MINISTRY WHICH IN TERMS OF TALENT AND<br />
APPLICATION MORE THAN MATCHES ANY OTHER IN THAT PERIOD. / 26 </p>
<p>-26-<br />
I BELIEVE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED STRONG FOUNDATIONS<br />
TO ENABLE THE GOVERNMENT TO FULFIL THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES<br />
ENTRUSTED TO IT BY THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA ON THE FIFTH OF<br />
MARCH 1983,<br />
