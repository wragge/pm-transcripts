SPEECH FOR REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE<br />
GALA CONCERT IN TRIBUTE TO MADAME NANCY CARUANA<br />
OF THE GREEK FOLKLORE CENTRE<br />
TEACHERS' FEDERATION THEATRE, SUSSEX STREET, SYDNEY<br />
8.00 PM, 30 JUNE 1989<br />
Madame Caruana, Members of the Greek Folklore Centre,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I am delighted to have this opportunity to represent the<br />
Prime Minister at this very happy occasion tonight.<br />
Madame Caruana is well known to you all, not only for<br />
her own notable performances, on stage and on screen,<br />
but also for her enormous dedication over nearly a<br />
quarter of a century to preserving ancient Greek<br />
folkloric custom in a new land.<br />
We are all aware of the deep affinity that all people of<br />
Greek descent have for their heritage and their culture.<br />
Even so, it still needs special people with the vision,<br />
talent and energy of Madame Caruana to keep the<br />
traditions alive and vibrant, and to highlight for the<br />
younger members of the community the importance of<br />
maintaining the music, the drama and the dances which<br />
are their precious birthright. </p>
<p>Of course, it is not only the Greek Australians who have<br />
benefited from Madame Caruana's work all Australians<br />
are the richer for it.<br />
The Australian Government not only welcomes but<br />
encourages the preservation of time-honoured cultures<br />
which have been brought to this nation from many non-<br />
English speaking countries.<br />
The Government sees it as basic to the foundation and<br />
maintenance of a truly multicultural society that the<br />
members of different ethnic communities in Australia are<br />
able to celebrate their own cultures, and to share them<br />
with all other Australians.<br />
This sharing of lifestyles is fundamental to increasing<br />
the mutual understanding between various groups which<br />
forms the basis of a truly harmonious society.<br />
I am reminded tonight that in earliest times, the ancient<br />
Greeks paid homage to Terpsichore ( Terp-slk-or-ee) the<br />
muse of Dance.<br />
Your presence here this evening is proof of how<br />
important these music and dance traditions still are in<br />
your lives. With these roots so deep in Greek culture,<br />
it is very notable how strongly the love of dance is<br />
passed on through from parents to children, as a </p>
<p>manifestation of the unquenchable Greek spirit and love<br />
of life. No significant occasion in Greek life is<br />
complete without the music and dance.<br />
Tonight is therefore not only a celebration of the lifework<br />
of Madame Caruana but it is, in a very real sense,<br />
a time for renewal, for handing on to the young people<br />
whom she has trained to carry forward the torch, in the<br />
best Greek tradition. The spirited and graceful<br />
performances which we are enjoying this evening are a<br />
tribute both to the young performers and to Madame<br />
Caruana herself.<br />
I am sure that all Greek Australians, in New South Wales<br />
and beyond, feel a debt of gratitude to Madame Caruana<br />
for her great contribution to maintaining your<br />
traditions, educating your young people, and<br />
enlightening the rest of Australia about your colourful<br />
heritage. Madame Caruana has proved herself to be one of the great<br />
Greek-Australian women of our time. I am proud to offer<br />
her, on the Government's behalf, our heartiest<br />
congratulations on her achievements. </p>
