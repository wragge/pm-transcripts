<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has visited Australian military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan.   </p>
<p>The Minister for Defence Materiel Mike Kelly, the Chief of the Defence Force General David Hurley and Australiaâs Ambassador to Afghanistan Jon Philp accompanied the Prime Minister. Mr Rudd was also joined by his wife Therese Rein.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd met members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) at Multi National Base-Tarin Kowt (MNB-TK).  He was briefed by Australian and coalition commanders on progress in the military campaign and met the Governor of Uruzgan Province, Amir Mohammed Akhundzada.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd thanked Australiaâs men and women in uniform for the vital work they are doing in preventing Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven for international terrorists by building the capacity of the Afghan security forces.  He paid tribute to the 40 Australian service men who have lost their lives in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd said, âthe Australian people are immensely proud of what our military and civilian personnel have achieved over the past seven years in Uruzgan in difficult and dangerous circumstancesâ.</p>
<p>Australian Defence personnel have trained and mentored the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) so they can provide security for their people.  This yearâs fighting season is the first time in over a decade that the ANSF are fighting the insurgency almost entirely alone. </p>
<p>There are now 38 girlsâ schools and more than 200 schools in total, a sixfold increase since 2006.  Up to 80 per cent of pregnant women now receive pre-natal health care and midwives and nurses have been trained to provide further support. </p>
<p>With other donors, we have upgraded more than 200 kilometres of roads and bridges, generating employment opportunities for thousands in the province.  </p>
<p>The Prime Ministerâs visit comes as Australia prepares to hand over full security responsibility for Uruzgan province to the ANSF by the end of the year. </p>
<p>In line with the phased draw down of international forces agreed with the Afghan government and Australiaâs coalition partners, MNB-TK and the PRT will close and around 1,000 of Australiaâs men and women in uniform will return.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd said, âIt was an important time to honour the work of Australian personnel in Uruzgan as Australiaâs contribution in the province draws to a close.  Australia military and civilian personnel have made real and tangible improvements to peopleâs lives in the province.â</p>
<p>The Prime Minister reiterated Australiaâs commitment to supporting Afghanistanâs future beyond nationwide transition at the end of 2014, including through ongoing training and financial support for Afghan security forces and an aid program.</p>
<p>âThe end of our mission in Uruzgan marks a change but not an end to Australiaâs engagement with Afghanistan,â Mr Rudd said.  âIt is time for the Afghan people to build on the progress they have achieved with the international communityâs help and take control of their futureâ. </p>
<p>Mr Rudd and Ms Rein laid wreaths at a memorial for fallen servicemen at Tarin Kowt.</p>
