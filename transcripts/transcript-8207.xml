PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, Y400NEE VALLEY RACECOURSE,<br />
MELBOURNE, 21 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think there's a danger<br />
with the wage/ tax trade off that the $ 500M economy that<br />
it could refuel demand?<br />
PM: No, I don't think we've got any problem there. What<br />
you've got to realise is that if the wage increase of the<br />
0.7% had been granted that would've put more money in the<br />
pockets of wage anid salary earners but it would've fed into<br />
our cost an inflation structure and on the balance of our<br />
considerations it was much better from everyone's point of<br />
view employees, employers and the community generally<br />
that we should take this opportunity of further reducing the<br />
infl~ ation rate. Now I ask you to remember just what's<br />
happened in this period since the election. We've had<br />
significant successive reductions in interest rates,<br />
significant reductions in the inflation rate and while we've<br />
had to slow the economy down and so we've seen some<br />
reflection in the employment area. What we are now doing is<br />
setting the base for a solid economic recovery next year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, ACOSS says it would've preferred the<br />
lower income people to have higher wages and lower taxes.<br />
How do you react to that?<br />
PM: Well I talked with the ACOSS people yesterday and<br />
pointed out to them that in fact the concentration of the<br />
benefit was in the range from $ 12,000 per annum up to about<br />
$ 30,000. in other words it was in the area of the lower to<br />
middle incomets who were getting relatively the greatest<br />
benefit out of the tax cuts.<br />
JOURNALIST: union rank and file endorsement like?<br />
PM: It's been pretty good in there to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: 1Well the BWIU, Sir, is already saying it will<br />
oppose the deal?<br />
PM: Well you see we don't deal with a particular official<br />
or a particular union. We deal with the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions which represents the whole trade union<br />
movement and they have not only endorsed the deal but they<br />
think it's an appropriate deal, which of course it is. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But the ACTU executive has yet to endorse the<br />
deal. PM: Would you like to have a bet? The Spring Carnival's<br />
nearly over., Would you like a bet?<br />
JOURNALIST: No, I wouldn't care to bet.<br />
PM; No, I didn't think you would.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, going back to the ACOSS position,<br />
surely the -timing of the tax cuts is wrong. Shouldn't it<br />
have been better if the benefit came before Christmas when<br />
the PM: They know that the amount of money is there, it's<br />
scheduled, the legislation is in place for it to be in<br />
January and the balance of benefit obviously is in it being<br />
by way of tax cut rather than a rather small wage increase<br />
and that can only be effected in January.<br />
JOURNALIST: inflation beei, is there any chance that<br />
the Accord Mark VII similar wage/ tax deal in an attempt<br />
to push dampen inflation in..<br />
PM: It's too early to any on that one. We've shown a very<br />
considerable degree of flexibility in the negotiations we<br />
have with the trade union movement to try and get what for<br />
the community overall is to be the beat outcome. Now all<br />
options are open but no particular item is on the agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST:. Is there a danger that workers may see that<br />
they are being asked yet again to endure more wage<br />
restraint? PM:. This is getting boring, if I may say so. Is there a<br />
problem, is3 there a difficulty, what's this particular draw<br />
back? Why don't you face up to the fact that this has been<br />
welcomed by the trade union movement generally, it's been<br />
9 welcomed by employers, it's been welcomed by responsible<br />
economic spokesmen. Why? Because it is going to give<br />
Australians a further opportunity to cement into the system<br />
this downward inflationary movement so that as compared with<br />
the rest of the world where inflation is rising, in<br />
Australia it's coming down and we're closing the gap. Why<br />
do you always have to try and look for a draw back? Why<br />
don't you understand that this is something which is for the<br />
benefit of all Australians? I mean, just once, just once do<br />
you think it mightn't be a bad idea to say, gee, some good<br />
news? You've got a psychological hang-up have you, about<br />
seeing some good news for all Australians?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can I just change the subject?<br />
PM: Yes, it would be good.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Haines, what do you think of her<br />
comments saying that our hostages are being left to rot? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: Well I think Australians will make their own judgement<br />
about that. I won't use the language I'm inclined to. it<br />
is deliberately untrue and she knows it to be untrue. What<br />
good she thinks she does herself or anyone else in speaking<br />
like that escapes my comprehension. Australians will judge<br />
her. JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well you'll have to ask her.<br />
JOURNALIST: Three Australian families have now accepted<br />
invitation to spend Christmas in Kuwait or Iraq. 19 that<br />
making your job difficult in that area?<br />
PM: No, I don't make judgements about the actions of<br />
families in those circumstances. I mean let's be<br />
understanding-and compassionate about this. Who can put<br />
themselves I certainly don't attempt to put myself in<br />
their minds and in their hearts. They are going through a<br />
great trauma. They must make their own judgements.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well what do you think about the Iraqi<br />
Embassy's offer for Christmas accommodation?<br />
PM: Well I mean what do you think about it? I mean here is<br />
a regime playing with the lives and the emotions of people<br />
whom they have seized against all international law and<br />
international convention. I mean. it is how they are<br />
treating these people in making them pawns in an attempt to<br />
get some Just~ ification for their totally unjustifiable<br />
annexation of a neighbouring country is unacceptable.<br />
