    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is terrific to be here. Itâs great to be amongst so many people who are so important in the cultural life of our country.</p>
<p>I do really appreciate your presence. More than that, I really appreciate everything you do for the cultural life of our country to help shape and promote our identity.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, in February 2012, I received what I thought was an innocuous tweet asking whether I was reading anything at that moment that Iâd recommend to others.</p>
<p>So, I replied: âI've just read Nikki Gemmell's With My Body; a captivating successor to The Bride Stripped Bare!â</p>
<p>Now itâs not often that the Twitterverse comes to a standstill â but for a moment there was, it seems, a pause: perhaps an inaudible but palpable gasp of surprise.</p>
<p>Not least from Nikki Gemmell who wrote and âhere was I thinking that the spring in his step was because of the machinations on the other side of politics!â This was in 2012, I hasten to add.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a shared assumption that my reading must be a dull reflection or reinforcement of views already held.</p>
<p>Likewise, when I respond to questions from young people about what they should read with the answer, the classics, Shakespeare and the Bible, it is seen as proof of a pre-existing world view â rather than an invitation to understand and appreciate the works that have shaped our culture and our world.</p>
<p>If I thought that young people had no need of such counsel â because they were already reading whatâs sometimes called the Western canon â I would not offer that advice.</p>
<p>Our reading, after all, should challenge our thinking, not just confirm it.</p>
<p>And literature is at its best when it reveals to us a world not seen, a perspective not understood, or an aspect of life not yet contemplated.</p>
<p>Through literature, we can grasp the fullness of life without necessarily having to have lived that aspect of it ourselves.</p>
<p>If music is art for the ear, and art is joy for the eye, then literature is surely a delight to the mind and a light for the soul.</p>
<p>And my life, like that of so many in this room, has been defined by a love of words.</p>
<p>Like prime ministers Deakin and Curtin before me, I was a journalist before I entered Parliament.</p>
<p>As Iâve sometimes said: As a journalist, I was a frustrated politician; as a politician, I am a frustrated journalist â and when I was a trainee priest, for three years in my twenties, I was just frustrated.</p>
<p>It shouldnât surprise anyone that most Australian prime ministers over the past half century have, in fact, written books: Menzies, Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke, Keating, Howard and most recently Julia Gillard.Â </p>
<p>They have done so because they understood the power of the written and the spoken word.</p>
<p>I am reminded of a story by Sir Robert Menzies who during 1941 spent several weekends with Winston Churchill at the British Prime Ministerâs retreat âChequers".</p>
<p>On one evening, Menzies walked into Churchillâs study and found him pacing up and down, dictating a draft for broadcast.</p>
<p>Menzies offered to withdraw but Churchill would have none of it; offering the Australian prime minister a cigar and waving him to a chair.</p>
<p>And Menzies later recounted Churchillâs method:</p>
<p><em>âHe tried every word, every phrase, for weight, for meaning, for sound. </em></p>
<p><em>âHe knew, of course, that a broadcast speech must come effectively to the ear and must, if possible, achieve its instant persuasion and inspiration. </em></p>
<p>The result, said Menzies, â<em>as we know to our advantage, was all clarity, and feeling, and inspiration.â</em></p>
<p>Every writer is willing to create meaning, to persuade, to touch and to inspire.</p>
<p>Thatâs a writerâs gift to an audience.</p>
<p>Now, itâs not without its risks, of course.</p>
<p>When asked about how he wrote best sellers, Bryce Courtenay said that no one ever sets out to write worst sellers!</p>
<p>To use the words of Richard Flanagan: â<em>somewhere in that abyss between ambition and failure often lies greatnessâ.</em></p>
<p>So, tonight, I salute the contribution of Australiaâs writers â and that of those who work with you.</p>
<p>Because, as an author, I know that behind every successful writer is another writer, the editor.</p>
<p>My first editor was the late Christopher Pearson.</p>
<p>I came to rely on him, almost as a medieval potentate might have relied on his food taster, to alert me to infelicities of style, non sequiturs and offences against the canons of political correctness.</p>
<p>It wasn't a fool-proof system.</p>
<p>Still, he helped to shape my public life and my political character and it is right that we collectively pay tribute to those who make and shape our literature.</p>
<p>So, I am proud to continue this tradition of the Prime Ministerâs Literary Awards.</p>
<p>I thank the writers, the editors and publishers of all the nominees for their contribution to a deeper, better, more thoughtful and more inspired national life.</p>
<p>Because the point of writing, as Pearson often reminded me, is to draw people closer to being their best selves.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge the judges who have read, weighed and debated the books in every category.</p>
<p>I recall one of my teachers, the English master from Riverview College, Joe Castley, admonishing his class far ago in the 1970s not to waste the summer break.</p>
<p>You must read, he said, not play, read! âReadâ, he said, âwith voracious appetiteâ.</p>
<p>Itâs a phrase that Iâve never forgotten after all these years and have mostly tried to live by.</p>
<p>Literature has always made a vital contribution to our nationâs cultural and intellectual life.</p>
<p>In October, when Richard Flanagan won the Man Booker prize, I wrote, as many of you would have, offering my congratulations.</p>
<p>And he sent me a most gracious reply â which I hope he wonât mind me sharing.</p>
<p>Too often, he said, in Australian politics, the arts are seen as the province of the left, âand arts and artists (are) therefore to be shunned by the rightâ.</p>
<p>He noted that this is not the norm in most political cultures and hoped that âat some time, it might cease to be (so) in oursâ.</p>
<p>Well, thatâs my hope, too.</p>
<p>Because every government should want to encourage all of the voices â all of the voices â in Australian life, but these voices can only be heard if theyâre listened to.</p>
<p>To that end, I announce tonight that the Government will establish the Book Council of Australia to promote good reading as well as good writing.</p>
<p>Tonightâs awards acknowledge the importance of our national stories as well as the excellence of our story-tellers.</p>
<p>They celebrate our literature, as well as those who are creating it.</p>
<p>Once you tell your stories, they become our stories.</p>
<p>So, I congratulate everyone associated with all of the nominated works and I look forward to spending quality time with some of them over the coming Christmas break.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. This is a marvellous night and Iâm very honoured to be amongst you.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
