TELEVISION INTERVIEW H THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SENATOR THE HON. J. G. GORTON<br />
ON A. B. C. TELEVISION NETWORK 21ST JANUARY, 1968<br />
Interviewer Mr Robert Moore<br />
MR MOORE Prme Minister, you came to office with a full hand, so to<br />
speak. A foreign crisisr the British withdrawal from our part of<br />
the world; a domestic crisis, a big one the mail strike. And<br />
what we might call a political crisis a split In the coalition;<br />
or at least the legacy thereof. Prime Minister, could it have<br />
been worse?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I Imagine things could always be worse, yes.<br />
Q. So you're fairly optimistic in spite of the last ten days?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. To turn to the British withdrawal if In fact there is a<br />
need for British forces in South-East Asia, presumably that need<br />
will remain when the British go. What exactly Is the need and how<br />
does it affect Australia?<br />
PM: Well, we, as I think I've made clear, greatly regret the<br />
British decision to withdraw their forces from the Singapore/ Malaysia<br />
area. ThIe need, I think, Is this first of all to have ground forces<br />
there, not in large numbers, but some ground forces there, able<br />
to be backed up swiftly by naval and air support. The purpose of<br />
having them there Is not to resist a major attack from some other<br />
part. It's to be a police force, to prevent small wars breaking<br />
out, to prevent insurgency, I think to contribute to t he security<br />
of the area, so that it can develop economically.<br />
Q. Now, these conditions will apply whether the British are<br />
there are not, In fact they may even be greater when the British<br />
leave, and yet one gets the Impression from your press conference<br />
that In fact we will perhaps diminish our forces there as a result,<br />
of the British diminishing theirs, which seems to be an odd thing<br />
to do if considerations still apply?<br />
PM: Well, this has not been decided. We are certainly keeping<br />
our forces at their present level there, over the period of four<br />
years before the British completely withdraw. I Intended to give<br />
the Impression In my press conference that we could not move In<br />
and fill the gap that Britain is leaving..<br />
Q. Sorry, Sir, Is this because we don't feel the danger is great<br />
enough, or because we don't have the capacity?<br />
PM: We would have the capacity, but we would only have the<br />
capacity if we sacrificed other needs of Australia which I, myself,<br />
think are of greater Importance to Australia. esseet / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Q. Then In a sense the British withdrawal isn't as serious as all<br />
that?<br />
PM: Well, it's not serious enough for us to say we're going to<br />
sacrifice our development we're not going to look after, with<br />
compassion, people in this community we're not going to provide<br />
better health and education and things of that kind. In my judgment, lt's<br />
not serious enough for us to do that.<br />
Q. If we're not going to Increase our military commitment there<br />
as a result of the British withdrawal, do you see a much closer<br />
diplomatic relationship between Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and<br />
New Zealand, say?<br />
PM: I think that would probably follow, although It is pretty close<br />
now between those four countries. Singapore, Malaysia, Australia<br />
and New Zealand have really got very close diplomatic relations now.<br />
Q. It seems that Lee Kuan Yew, or even the Tunku perhaps, feels<br />
that they're not quite close enough?<br />
PM: L With whom?<br />
Q. With Australia and New Zealand, and perhaps Britain<br />
PK. Now, why do you say that?<br />
Q. Because they seem to be pressing more strongly for fivepower<br />
talks than we are?<br />
PM: Oh, I see five-power talks as distinct from general diplomatic<br />
relationships<br />
Q. Yes, they seem to be moving much more towards a quite<br />
specific alliance.<br />
PM: Well, the five -pome r talks are something that we would attend,<br />
but not something which we would initiate.<br />
Q. Now, given the fact that our defence situation presumably will<br />
change In the area once Britain leaves, do you feel that this may<br />
perhaps require a new foreign policy to take account of this that<br />
we may In fact develop closer relationships with Indonesia and<br />
Japan?<br />
PM: I would hope that the closer relationships which have been<br />
developed with Indonesia In the last period, would continue to be<br />
strengthened. I would like to see close relationships and friendly<br />
relationships and diplomatic relationships encouraged between<br />
Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore and, of course, with Japan which<br />
Is playing a significant role in that area. Anything that we can do,<br />
short of sacrificing Australia's own needs, to create an atmosphere<br />
in which the standard of life can be raised in those countries the<br />
burden or fear of aression can be taken away, or subversion, we<br />
would try to do.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, we now turn to Viet Nam which I imagine one<br />
has to see In context with the British withdrawal as well, but not<br />
unrelated. How close in fact are we to taics with North Viet Nam? e. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM: I don't think that at this stage we are particularly close to talks<br />
with North Viet Nam, though people are exarnirt ng the possibilities<br />
of such talks. There has really been no Indication that there would<br />
be talks, from Hanoi, and as you know, the United States has kept<br />
suggesting that there ought to be talks. All that Hanoi has done Is<br />
say Cease bombing and then, maybe at some unspecified date In<br />
the future, they might have talks.<br />
Q. Now, supposing that said " Cease bombing, and we will",<br />
what would -you say?<br />
PM: I would say, If they said " Cease bombing,, and we will<br />
have talks," I would think we should say " That" s fine. We' 1T<br />
cease bombing, you guarantee not to send reinforcements In men<br />
and material into the South, and the talks could begin at once.<br />
Q. Then we say: " Cease supplying the South and we'll have<br />
talks'". Is that what you say? In other words, we apply the<br />
condition?<br />
PM: We would say: " We will cease bombing". Which condition<br />
they apply....<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM: " And we'll do that if you stop building up your forces<br />
In the South, which our present bombing Is designed to stop, and<br />
we would then be glad to see talks opened as soon as possible. I'm<br />
expressing my view on this. I'm obviously not speaking for the<br />
United States Government Y'm speaking for myself.<br />
Q. Do you feel, Sir, that perhaps we might be at some<br />
diplomatic disadvantage if it looks as if we are the ones who are<br />
applying the condition now?<br />
PM: I don't see why because one condition being applied by<br />
North Viet Nam a condition being applied without any guarantee<br />
of talks, and It seems to me perfectly reasonable if, as Is the<br />
case, the present bombing was designed to stop the tnt to stop,<br />
because it doesn't hamper and hinder the flow of men and raw<br />
materials from north to south, that If we stopped that, and we<br />
didn't get at a military disadvantage so that the flow of men and<br />
materials from north to south could continue un checked, it would<br />
seem to me all to be part of a packaged deal.<br />
01 May we not be asking North Viet Nam to do too much?<br />
To put It another way, aren ' t we asking North Viet Nam to concede<br />
the war, If we ask them not to supply the south? In other words,<br />
may this not be an impossible condition for them, however much<br />
we desire It?<br />
PM: I don't think so, because the suggestion is a bombing pause,<br />
and during that pause, talks start. Now, if It's a bombing pause,<br />
there ought to be able to be a reinforcement pause too, so that the<br />
talks can go on, and I don't believe that anybody has conceded<br />
anything except two Inter-related military operations would both<br />
cease. e9* e * a/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Q. Prime Minister, can we now turn to economic aid another<br />
aspect of our relations with the countries near us how much economic<br />
aid should we give, and why? What should be the reasons behind our<br />
economic assistance?<br />
PM: People tend to put a particular percentage of GNP as the amount<br />
of economic aid one ought to give. I've never understood why pluck a<br />
figure out of the air, and say this is the figure, we should attain that.<br />
I think we should give as much as we feel we can give without seriously<br />
interfering with Australia's own requirements perhaps interfering a<br />
little with Australia's own requirements, but not seriously, because we<br />
have a nation to build and a people to look after ourselves. Having said<br />
that, the purposes of our economic aid ought, and again this Is a subject<br />
with which I know different points of view can be put, ought to be designed<br />
to build up a technological capacity of countries,. to enable them to look<br />
after the machines which they need to expand their industry or to look<br />
after their agriculture, or whatever it may be, and to provide a sort of<br />
capital for them to enable them to grow.<br />
Q. Eir, you've just said, and you said earlier In your press<br />
conference this week that the amount of aid we can give is limited by<br />
the need to develop our own country, and by our own defence requirements,<br />
and this can sound either like good housekeeping ( W perhaps selfishness,<br />
and I would like just to pin you down a little further on your attitude<br />
here, because as many people have said, we don't know a lot about you,<br />
but I suspect much more than people are admitting<br />
In the Senate on October 26t h, 1967, during that part of the<br />
debate which narrowed down to Australian economic assistance to the<br />
Pacific Islands, after a brief comment by Senator Tangney, you went<br />
on to say, and I agree It's out of context but I think it's still Indicative,<br />
you went on to say<br />
" I do not know that I have borrowed anything from humanity<br />
in general; from my point of view, what we give Is assistancef<br />
I must admit that I believe that that Is quite enough for the<br />
Australian taxpayers to be asked to supply to that part c( the<br />
world. Now, without being cyilcal, I don't think that sounds altoge ther<br />
a mean attitude but it doesn't sound a generous attitude either. You seem<br />
to me to be denying any kind of moral obligation that we might have<br />
towards people In a worse posllbn than ourselves.<br />
PM: L I wouln't think that was right when you said deny any kind<br />
of moral obligation. I think Inherent in that Is a statement that that<br />
Is enough for us to give, which means that we are accepting that amount<br />
of aid, and presumably because it is a moral obligation, but we have to<br />
balance a moral obligation against the requirement of our own people.<br />
I think that we have to bear In mind that we are twelve million people<br />
with, as I say, a nation to build and a continent to develop. I think we<br />
need to bear in mind that If all our resources were directed towards<br />
assistance in these countries, they would not make a significant amount<br />
of difference there.<br />
Q. Sir, to come back to this quotation, I don't want to harp on it<br />
of course, but in that you do suggest that you are worried mainly<br />
about the taxpayer being asked to give too much in forms of econrmlc<br />
aid. Are you .1 0 0 </p>
<p>PM: I would like to see the taxpayer's money, which is the source<br />
of all money, directed primarily to developing our own country and<br />
looking after our own people, but to give some assistance, and I<br />
couldn't give you a precise level in this Instance, but to give some<br />
assistance even though It might slightly Impinge on that, but I<br />
wouldn't want to sacrifice Australia's growth.<br />
Q. You wouldn't see it being a big Increase In our budget then,<br />
economic aid.?<br />
PM: I don't think I would at the moment, no.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I'd now like to come home and to the mail<br />
strike; I don't want to go Into the details of It. This Is not the time<br />
and place to do that but I think It does raise a general philosophy,<br />
which I'd like to explore with you of your attitude towards Industrial<br />
disputes In general, and to paxhaps trade unions, and I'd like to do<br />
this In what may seem an odd way by going back to your maiden<br />
speech in the Senate back In March, 1950, which you made In the<br />
first flush of the Liberal dawn, and referring to the 1947 Banking Act<br />
as an abuse of government power,, you said this<br />
" We do not believe that it Is the function of<br />
government to work out the destiny of the individual. It Is<br />
the function of the people themselves"<br />
and you went on to say " This philosophy has illumined all people of<br />
liberal minds throughout the ages, and among liberal minds<br />
I Include trade unionists who, In the past, fought exactly<br />
the same fight as we are fighting on this issue.<br />
Now, my first point Is, couldn't the post office workers argue that<br />
they are fighting for their own destiny In the very terms of your<br />
liberal philosophy?<br />
PM: Well, perhaps they could argue that way, but I don't think that<br />
It would be a valid argument, because we have set up In Australi a,<br />
and we have accepted in Australia, generally accepted the belief<br />
that if people are dissatisfied, then there is conciliation machinery<br />
and arbitration. machinery to which application can be made, and that<br />
after application to conciliation and arbitration machinery, then what<br />
Is decided there should be accepted, and this, I think, must prevail<br />
unless there Is to be law of the jungle.<br />
Q. Is what Is really wrong with the mail-strike the fact that<br />
It inconveniences the community? Is that why it Is so serious?<br />
PKO I think that there are two I think that is one very, very<br />
se~ fous thing, but It does more than Inconvenience people', it could<br />
clog up business; It could put people generally out of empl oyment<br />
if It continued long enough; It could stop things operating that is<br />
serious enough. But there is also a principle involved of upholding<br />
arbitration, and I think both those are very significant.<br />
Q. Could I come back to the first point. I-bw, In fact, do you<br />
as a government balance the claims of a particular group of workers<br />
in an essential industry against the needs of the community as a whole? </p>
<p>-6<br />
PMV. How do we balance It? Well, I don't think it's the government's<br />
job to balance the claims of a particular group of employees against the<br />
nation as a whole. I'm not quite sure that I understand you, but I<br />
think perhaps that's the job of an Arbitration Court or something of<br />
that kind.<br />
Q. What I was really getting at was, obviously, the degree of<br />
reaction by the Government will vary according to whether the workers<br />
on strike are In a very essential Industry, an essential Industry, or<br />
in a trivial Industry, say like Ice-cream makers.<br />
PM:. Yes, It will.<br />
Q. You come to a stage where you must step In, where the<br />
machinery has broken down. Now, it could be I'm not saying In<br />
this case that It is a certain dispute; in fact, a group of workers have<br />
a very legitimate claim, public opinion and the government are wildly<br />
against them, but public opinion can be selfish too It can be in<br />
certain circumstances, Now as a government, how do you balance<br />
this conflict?<br />
PM: I think any government must balance it this way. I think any<br />
government must say that the vital needs of a community as a whole,<br />
the vital needs of the nation, muet be protected not Impetuously, but<br />
they must not be allowed to be destroyed, and this must be the<br />
paramount and over-riding consideration, I think.<br />
Q. Sir,, at your press conference a few days ago, you spoke of<br />
what I think you called " an administrative reshuffle" when talking<br />
about the Cabinet of the future. I wonder whether this mail strike<br />
may not be one of the things you had in mind because It does seem to<br />
me odd that this strike should involve the Prime Minister, the Postm<br />
aster-general, the Minister for Labour and National Service, the<br />
Public Service Board, with somewhere the Arbitration Commission<br />
looming In the background. It all seems very confused now Is this<br />
an example of what you would like to streamline?<br />
PM: This wasn't particularly what I had In mind, nor is it<br />
precisely. It's very nearly setting out the facts, but not quite<br />
precisely. It does Involve the Public Service Board because Initially<br />
applications are made to the Public Service Board for variations.<br />
After such applications have been made, If either side is dissatisfied,<br />
then there Is a public service arbitrator, and after the public service<br />
arbitrator, then subject to the Arbitration Court Itself, there Is<br />
a further application to a neutral umpire In the Arbitration Court.<br />
The only way In which the Prime Minister comes Into It Is that the<br />
Public Service Board Is under his administrative control, and Indeed<br />
the only way the two ways In which I have come into it are these.<br />
Firstly, In reply to a telegram to me asking If I would speed up<br />
meetings with the Public Service Board, bring it forward before the<br />
date when It was due to take place, I desired to minimise the chances<br />
of conflict, and I sent a telegram back saying " Yes, I would have<br />
a meeting as soon as they returned to normal work. That's one<br />
way. The other way I came Into It was making a decision with my<br />
colleagues that we have to keep the n-a Us moving, no matter what.<br />
I would say to the community that having been done, then the process<br />
of keeping the mails moving is in charge of the Postmaster -General and<br />
the Minister for Labour and National Service comes into it because of<br />
their general trade union relationships. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Q4 Do you agree maybe it's not confused, but do you<br />
agree that It's very complex anyway?<br />
PM: It's not as complex as It looks, but it certainly looks<br />
complex.<br />
Q. I wonder If we could move on, related to what you said<br />
there too, to your conception of the office of Prime Minister. A<br />
lot of people have written a lot about this and said a lot about It,<br />
that perhaps In Australia and Britain too, we're developing something<br />
more like the President the Prime Minister is getting bigger and<br />
bigger in the community and In Cabinet and so on. Now, do you see<br />
yourself as Prime Minister as essentially Chairman of a Committee<br />
or a Super Minister?<br />
PM: L Well, I don't like that sort of super-Minister thing It's<br />
got overtones of Supermac or Superman. I don't see myself that<br />
way. Now, I don't see the Prime Minister as Chairman of the<br />
Committee. Ideally, of course, perhaps if we had an Ideal world,<br />
the Prime Minister shouldn't have to do anything at all except go<br />
round and meet people because he ought to have Ministers in charge<br />
of all various areas, and leave them to do the job, and they should<br />
do it and talk to him about doing it, and he should just sit back and<br />
think about what we're going to try and do next, the goals we're<br />
going to reach. I don't think we'll ever reach that Ideal stage, and<br />
there must be Cabinet responsibility for a number of matters. But<br />
I would believe that the Prime Minister now or In the future Is not<br />
to be Chairman of the Committee so that a majority vote In the<br />
committee says what's going to be done. He should put to the<br />
Cabinet or the committee what he believes ought to be done, and<br />
if he believes strongly emugh that It ought to be done, then It must<br />
be done.<br />
Q. I'd like to move on from there. It's sometimes said that<br />
the most important decision a Prime Minister has to make Is the<br />
making of his Cabinet. Now, it isn't the time to canvass the details<br />
of what you have in mind, but I wonder If I could put it on the<br />
pessimistic side which zeems to be the quickest way of getting an<br />
answer. What would you look for In deciding to drop a Minister,<br />
if I can put It that way? What Is it that makes a bad Minister?<br />
What is a failure In politics?<br />
PM: I think that's a very hard question to answer. I really<br />
do I don't think it's a question that, flung at me like that, that<br />
I can answer.<br />
Q. Can I put It this way? Is it because a Minister Is a<br />
bad administrator or because he gives bad advice in Cabinet, or<br />
because he's politically unsound? I mean, we could make a longer<br />
list than that, but I'm just wondering what It Is In fact that a Prime<br />
Minister takes into account when he decides that Bloggs must go?<br />
PM: L So and so is a good Minister so and so Is a bad<br />
Minister?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM: I'd like notice of that question because It </p>
<p>8-<br />
Q. I wonder if perhaps we could take It up another time then?<br />
PM: Possibly<br />
Q. Thank you very much. Could! I turn to the Coalition.<br />
Mr McEwen, a few weeks ago, Indicated that he would not serve under<br />
a particular Liberal Party leader. Now,, for your part, would you<br />
refuse to allow a particular Country Party member to serve under you<br />
as a Minister?<br />
PM: No. I would not believe that I had that right; just as the<br />
Leader of the Country Party doesn't believe that he has the right, to<br />
say he refuses to allow a particular member to be made a Minister.<br />
He believes his right Is limited to saying this: " i I will not serve<br />
under so and so. He doesn't believe that he has the right to say:<br />
77M~ f not serve with.<br />
Q. So, in return, you would accept a package deal, if I can<br />
use that word, from the Country Party?<br />
PM: L Yes.<br />
Q. Do you thinkc there Is any problem, In fact, in having<br />
some Ministers less directly responsible to you as Prime Minister,<br />
than others?<br />
PM? I don't think so. I don't think Iis arisen in my experience,<br />
with relation to other Prime Ministers, which I have been able to<br />
watch from the outside, but it just doesn't seem to have appeared.<br />
And we have an understanding, and I think the understanding was held<br />
by Sir Robert Menzies with Mr McEwen, and by Mr Holt. We don't go<br />
in there as two separate teams with Caucus beforehand, and decide<br />
block votes beforehand, or put similar opinions. We try to, and I<br />
believe we do, go in as individual members of a government, and on<br />
many, many occasions you'll find discussions in which the Liberal<br />
and Country Party Ministers agree to something, and Liberal and<br />
Country Party Ministers on the other side raising doubts about it.<br />
Q. You don't think that your position, In fact, may be<br />
weakened by events of the past few weeks?<br />
PM: I don't think so. No.<br />
Q. I tikone ct the most Interesting things that observers<br />
will be watching, with perhaps a certain degree of well-intentioned<br />
malice perhaps, will be how you handle the Senate. There's a certain<br />
irony In your becoming the Prime Minister, and you're on record at<br />
the time of the postal regulations debate and so on, as suggesting that<br />
perhaps the Senate is In danger of over-stepping its role In certain<br />
directions? What are you going to do about it?<br />
PM: Therdfa absolutely nothing anybody can do about it unless<br />
you have a constitutional referendum, and I haven't got that In mind.<br />
The Senate, I think, has not over-stepped Its role in the past,, except<br />
that I was a bit dubious about that postal regulation one; I think that<br />
perhaps that was perhaps a little over the line. But It hasn't rejected<br />
Budgets; It hasn't refused supply,$ I t hasn't made the House of<br />
Representatives go to the people. ' If It did, It would certainly be<br />
acting, I think, irresponsibly, and wrongly. But it has a role to<br />
0 0 0 / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PM examine legislation, to try and improve It, to make amendments,<br />
( Contd.) to send It back for further examination. And provided It acts<br />
responsibly, I think It has an advantage to a government.<br />
Now, we have not had a majority In the Senate for some time,<br />
but things -well, they've been held up, and there have been<br />
arguments and so on, but things have gone on. We're In no<br />
worse position now than we were before, In fact It might even<br />
be said to be in a rather better one.<br />
Q. I want to mention one name, and one name only. What<br />
are you going to do about Senator Wright? Woo him, or contain<br />
him?<br />
PM: Woo him or coutain him? Wr,. qld you care to define<br />
your words?<br />
Q. Well, are you going to elevate him, promote him, win<br />
him over, or are you going to try to Isolate him or bring him<br />
into line?<br />
PM: I've always had quite a regard for Senator Wright,<br />
except from time to time when we've had an argument. But I'm<br />
bound to say that during the period of time when I was Leader<br />
of the Senate, and I think you'll see this if you look at the record,<br />
that he was of great assistance to the Government. He came In<br />
and supported the Government on a number of occasions, and put<br />
our case for us very well.<br />
Q. Did you say he supported the Government on a number<br />
of occasions?<br />
PIML Yes. I did.<br />
Q. On other occasions?<br />
PM. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, actively supported actively<br />
came in. We argued well and put active support rather than<br />
just.<br />
Q. Sir, I'd like to touch on one aspect of your own career<br />
in the Senate, and one only, and I do it for perhaps not the<br />
apparent reason. And that's the VIP affair, because I feel<br />
anyway that if there was ever a time when you made your name<br />
and came before the public as a potential Liberal Party leader,<br />
If ever the occasion arose, it was then. My own personal view<br />
Is that If there was ever a time that you made your run without<br />
knowing it what Is interesting is that in the newspaper reports<br />
of your tabling the documents in the Senate that day, the word<br />
" Insist" crops up " Senator Gorton insisted on tabling the<br />
documents" and this phrase did you In fact Insist, and if<br />
you did, against whose advice did you Insist on tabling them?<br />
PM: I don't know where the newspapers got that particular<br />
word from. You know, they have political corrspondents, and<br />
they go round and talkc to people, and then they come out with<br />
their own words as to what happened. I just prefer to put It this<br />
way, that having discovered that these things were in existence,<br />
and believing it proper that a House of Parliament should have<br />
information as to the expenditure of public money how it was<br />
spent. And the House having asked for that information, it was<br />
a proper thing to do to provide it. 1 </p>
<p>10<br />
Q. Well, if you didn't have to Insist, did you have to resist<br />
dissuasion, and there I'll leave it when you've answered that.<br />
PM: There was some discussion about It.<br />
Q. Sir, I'd like to end this discussion, to turn to your more<br />
general political philosophy, and I'd like to begin on the economic<br />
side of It. You are on record as saying that you oppose monopolies,<br />
and that you're all for free competition, not for disastrous<br />
competition, but for free compe~ tition.<br />
Now, Is the logic of this attitude a two-airline system, a<br />
three-airline system or a four-airline system?<br />
PM: I think it's a two-airline system. You can't apply this logic<br />
all across the board. You musn't say " I believe in this and<br />
therefore In every field this must happen". I mean, I'm not in<br />
favour of a two-railway system, that kind of thing. The philosophy<br />
that I was seeking to express was this: That I believed that the<br />
community was better served, and people themselves were better<br />
served, and that they had more opportunity to develop their own<br />
individual capacities and try somethi rg out and see how good they<br />
were in fields where there was free local competition. But I<br />
think history has shown that it Is not awfully comfortable always<br />
for businesses to have competition, so they tend to amalgamate In<br />
many fields, and after a while that might mean it could mean that<br />
competition just wasn't there at all. Well, If competition wasn It<br />
there at all, you would have a private monopoly that could be<br />
controlled by government of course, higher taxes moving in, but<br />
what would be a better way of controlling it, in my view, is to provide<br />
competition from a government. It wouldn't then be a monopoly,<br />
but instead of having a private monopoly, you provide competition<br />
from a government Instrumentality,, and let them fight it out.<br />
Q. I still can It see, Sir, why you object to having, say,<br />
two private airlines and one government airline?<br />
PM: Well I suppose the answer to that would be, perhaps not<br />
philosophical, I suppose the answer to that would be that there is<br />
just not enough traffic and passengers and revenue for an extra<br />
airline<br />
Q. Couldn't you allow the entrepreneurs who disagree with<br />
you the right to go broke?<br />
PMO Yes, I'm not sure that they'd go broke without expecting<br />
to be baled out.<br />
Q. One other point, Sir, and this is not strictly speaking the<br />
concern of the Federal Government, but I think It Is a concern of<br />
Liberal philosophy. Does your philosophy allow restrictions on the<br />
production of margarine, say, or restriction of the consumer's<br />
choice?<br />
PM: I would have thought that that was a matter for S tate<br />
legislation.<br />
Q. I think it's still a matter for general Liberal philosophy? 0 0 A1 1 </p>
<p>11<br />
PM: Yes, It Is.<br />
Q. What is your view on that?<br />
PM: This is of course a matter for Liberal philosophy -you're<br />
entirely right on this. It Is also a matter for decision by the<br />
sovereign States. I wouldn't like it to be thought that I was<br />
expressing a philosophy here which might be designed to interfere<br />
with what the sovereign States thought they ought to do.<br />
Q. So, you're not a centm list after all?<br />
Well, Sir, I'd like to end on your quite specific political<br />
philosophy, and I'll be very brief on this, but going back in your<br />
maiden speech in March, 1950, you said that<br />
" In the past there has always been a tendency on the<br />
part of governments of every kind to gain more and more<br />
power because, I suppose, Members of a government believe<br />
that they are good men and will not abuse It. But that<br />
danger always exists."<br />
WNell, that's what somebody else has called " the neverending<br />
audacity of elected persons".<br />
Now that you're on the other end of the government stream,<br />
how are you going to protect yourself from falling into this abuse of<br />
power? Are you conscious of it?<br />
PM: I would be conscious of It because It because<br />
ever since Acton, I think It was, said " All power corrupts, but<br />
absolute power corrupts absolutely' this has been one of the<br />
things that one's always had In mind In the field of politics. But,<br />
it still remains true that, although I might be conscious of it, I<br />
might subsconsciously be led to say " Well, I know 11m right here<br />
so I'm going to do It" and that danger exists.<br />
Now, I'd try to stop it myself. If! I didn't, then I'm pretty<br />
sure that the Party would, or the House of Representatives would,<br />
or the Senate certainly would.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, thank you very much for giving us your time. </p>
