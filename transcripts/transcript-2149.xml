EMBARGO NOTFOR-RLS./ EBEFORE9AM ( EST)<br />
FOR PRESS: PM No. 88.1969<br />
VIET NAM FURTHER TROOP WITHDRAWALS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Prsdn's announcement means that he believes<br />
the Vietnamisation programme is proving successful, and that he can<br />
make further troop withdrawals without running military risks.<br />
K. It does not mean any abandonment of the objectives to<br />
attain which the United States and we, ourselves, entered the war as,<br />
indeed, the President has pointed out.<br />
C. When the announced withdrawals have been completed,<br />
the United States forces will have been reduced to a level about 50, 000<br />
below that at which they stood when the Australian Government increased<br />
its Yask Force to the present level.<br />
It is the belief of the Australian Government, after<br />
careful study of this matter in Cabinet on the basis of reports<br />
jointly submitted by the Ministers for External Affairs and Defence that,<br />
when the military situation in Vietnam permits the next substantial<br />
withdrawal, then, in consultation with the Government of the Republic<br />
of Vietnam, some. Australian units will be included in the numbers<br />
scheduled for such withdrawal.<br />
I have talked with the President of the Uni'ted States<br />
C. about this and he expressed himself as happy to agiee with our view.<br />
It is impossible, at this stage, to forecast when such<br />
further withdrawals might take place.<br />
