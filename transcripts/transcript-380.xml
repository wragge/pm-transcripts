SECOND READING SPEECH<br />
by<br />
THE PRIIIVVI INIST, THE RT. HON. R. G. ~ ZE<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESEI\ TATIVES. CANBERRA, W~ EDYESDAY, 18TH OCTOBER, 1961<br />
QUEENSLAND GRANT ( BEEF CATTLE ROADS) BILL, 1961<br />
This Bill seeks the approval of the Parliament to a grant of financial<br />
assistance to the State of Queensland for the construction of beef cattle roads<br />
in that State. In February last, I announced the Government's interest in1 a number<br />
of large enterprises which would assist with development and increase export<br />
earnings. Included in the list was " road development in the North, including<br />
North and Western Queensland, the Northern Territory, and the North of<br />
Western Australia. 1" Following a very careful examination of the whole<br />
question of road requirements in the North, and consultation with the StateL;<br />
concerned, the Government decided on an immediate programme of assistance in all<br />
three areas. The current Budget includes a special allocation of Å 350,000<br />
designed to speed up road development in the Northern Territory, and we have<br />
also agreed to a special grant to Western Australia which is the subject of a<br />
Bill I shall be introducing shortly. The present ffeasure covers the assistance<br />
we plan for the State of Queensland.<br />
It is perhaps unnecessary for me to stress the great importance of<br />
transport to the development of our sparsely-populated northern areas, or to<br />
1well on the part played by the beef cattle industry in those areas and the<br />
significance of beef as an export earner. These facts are well-known, and<br />
there is also general acknawlhdgment of the further fact that droving as a means<br />
of moving cattle from place to place is rapidly being superseded, where suitable<br />
roads are available, by the use of motorised road trains. The use of road<br />
trains speeds up movement. More importantly, its general availability has the<br />
side effect of promoting quite significant changes in animal husbandry,<br />
allowing cattle to be " turned off" at much younger ages and thus increqising the<br />
productivity and overall efficiency of individual properties, as well as<br />
producing, in most instances, an end product of higher quality.<br />
Expert economic studies, designed largely to measure the cost of<br />
roads against the value of the benefits expected to flow from their<br />
construction, have shown that there is much scope in Queensland f or roads<br />
expenditure which should produce really worthwhile results. Apart from the<br />
Queensland section of the Barkly Highway between Camooweal and Mount Isa, there<br />
is practically no road in the west and north-west of the State suitable for the<br />
regular transport of cattle.<br />
Earlier this year, I announced that, as a first step, we had agreed to<br />
provide Å 650,000 of the first Å 1,000,000 spent on the construction of a road<br />
between Noirnanton and the Tovnsville-Mount Isa raillway at Julia Creek. This<br />
work is now well under way, and the 1961/ 62 Budget has made provision for the<br />
Commonwealth contribution of Å 650, 000.* However, at Budget time it was<br />
announced that we were ready and willing to go much further than this, and in<br />
subsequent discussions with the Qlueensland Government woe have agreed to an allinclusive<br />
grant of Å Smillion to be rmde over a period of five years for<br />
expenditure on approved road works.<br />
In effect, we have left the Normanton-Julia Creek arrangenent as it<br />
stands, and we have added a further Å 4,350,000 as a straight-out grant which<br />
does not have to be matched by corresponding expenditure on the part of the<br />
State. Put in another way, if the State spends a total of Å 5,350,000 on<br />
approved roads during the prescribed period, it can qualify for a Commonwealth<br />
grant of Å 5million towards this expenditure. The grant would be made<br />
available progrossively over the period and so provide for financing of the work<br />
as well as ultimate assistance, </p>
<p>The actual roads on which expenditure will qualify for<br />
reimbursement will be selected in the first instance by the State, but must be<br />
approved by the Treasurer. Neturally from a Common-wealth viewpoint we want the<br />
funds to be applied to the best advantage, and thus the Treasurer is required<br />
to have regard to certain criteria essentially the effect on beef production<br />
and the relationship between cost and benefits before giving an approval.<br />
The Bill also provides that the Treasurer may approve standards of<br />
design or construction and that, if he does so approve, then the State must<br />
comply with those standaids to be eligible for a grant in respect of the -Tor<br />
concernfd. On this aspect I can say that there is already a very substantial<br />
measure of agreeme~ nt on standards.<br />
I feel sure that there will be general support for this measu.' e<br />
which, in conjunction with other assistance proposals already before the House<br />
or to be introduced, should contribute greatly to that development of this<br />
country and its resourcesz in which we all believe.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
