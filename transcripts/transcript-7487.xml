CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATE BANQUET<br />
NEW DELHI 9 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
. sTohcei ewtoy rld sees in India a land of rich and ancient culture; a<br />
of profound challenge and almost limitless<br />
opportunity; a nation whose hard won achievement of<br />
independence set an inspiring landmark in the new world order<br />
that emerged after the Second World War; a democracy where<br />
individual liberty and justice are the cherished-attributes<br />
of daily life for hundreds of millions of people.<br />
For Australians, India has been a comrade in times of war and<br />
a friend in peace; a great rival in sport, not least in<br />
cricket; a clear and influential voice in the United Nations,<br />
the Commonwealth, and the Non-Aligned Movement.<br />
In our own colonial times, in 1854, in the famous act of<br />
defiance by the gold miners at the Eureka Stockade, there<br />
were, standing at the forefront of the struggle side by side<br />
with men from around the world, two gold miners from Bengal.<br />
And in more recent times, Australians and Indians have shown<br />
their preparedness to fight and to die in defence of freedom.<br />
* Last week, in Thailand, I laid a wreath at the Kanchanaburi<br />
War Cemetery, in honour. of the Commonwealth prisoners of war<br />
who died building the Burma railroad Australians, Indians<br />
and others who died in appalling conditions of exhaustion and<br />
hardship but who have left to us a powerful reminder of their<br />
resilience and indomitable humanity.<br />
Today, some 80,000 Indians are welcome and valued members of<br />
our multicultural society, making tremendous contributions to<br />
our academic, cultural, professional and, I might add, our<br />
culinary life.<br />
For all these reasons you will understand the depth of my<br />
sincerity when I say it is an honour and a pleasure to return<br />
to India, for this my first bilateral visit, and to bring you<br />
the friendly greetings of the Australian people. </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Since you assumed the Prime Ministership after the tragic<br />
death of your mother, we have worked together closely.<br />
It was through the Commonwealth in Nassau, London and<br />
Vancouver that I came to know you and to appreciate your<br />
statesmanship, vision and the fresh and open-minded approach<br />
you bring to world affairs.<br />
You also did us the honour of visiting Australia in October<br />
1986. On all these occasions we have advanced a range of<br />
issues of importance to us both and we have, at the same<br />
time, become personal friends.<br />
I look forward to working with you again when we next meet at<br />
the Kuala Lumpur CHOGM in October.<br />
To you, Prime Minister, I bring the warmest personal<br />
greetings. I regard it as a great honour that tomorrow, when<br />
I deliver the Third Indira Gandhi Memorial Lecture, I will be<br />
able to pay tribute to the contribution you and your family<br />
have made to modern India and the world over three<br />
generations.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, the foundations of the Indian-Australian<br />
relationship would be the envy of many. We share a language,<br />
institutions and many common values.<br />
At the same time, I think it is fair to say that the<br />
relationship, and its economic aspect in particular, has not<br />
been developed at the pace or with the imagination and<br />
creativity that it merits.<br />
Your visit to Australia injected into it new vigor and<br />
vitality. On this visit I am determined to build on those<br />
achievements by further expanding the links between us.<br />
Tomorrow I will open the third meeting of the Indo-Australian<br />
Joint Business Council, which was established following<br />
agreement between us in 1986.<br />
This third meeting takes place against an encouraging<br />
expansion of two-way trade: an 18 per cent increase in<br />
1987/ 88 to a total value of well over A$ 700 million.<br />
Tomorrow we will also witness the signing of Memoranda of<br />
Understanding between our respective agencies responsible for<br />
telecommunications, meteorology and railways. </p>
<p>But these developments only start what I believe will be a<br />
much longer story of substantial growth in the economic<br />
dimensions of Indian-Australian co-operation.<br />
Australia will be expanding significantly its bilateral<br />
development program in India.<br />
I am particularly pleased to say that the discussions between<br />
our two governments in regard to the Piparwar coal project<br />
are now at an advanced stage and are expected to be brought<br />
to a successful conclusion in the near future.<br />
This will be a very substantial achievement. It will not<br />
only be the largest project of its kind between Australia and<br />
India, it will also be a real stimulus to the relationship as<br />
a whole a great demonstration of what we can do together.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, there would be little point in doing the<br />
work required to build these links, unless we concurrently<br />
work for a peaceful and stable international environment<br />
within which such co-operative links can flourish.<br />
My Government has watched closely your personal efforts and<br />
initiatives in response to the changes taking place globally<br />
and in the Asia-Pacific region particularly your recent<br />
successful visit to China. For Australia's part we welcome<br />
this development; more harmonious relations between India and<br />
China will go a long way to promoting stability in the<br />
region. In the immediate region we applaud the way in which you and<br />
Prime Minister Bhutto have improved the atmosphere of the<br />
relationship between your two countries, including at the<br />
recent SAARC meeting.<br />
The decisive way in which India recently supported the<br />
democratic Government of the Maldives was welcomed throughout<br />
the Commonwealth.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, when we met in Canberra in 1986 we did so<br />
against a background of international distrust. The global<br />
context of our conversations this time round is considerably<br />
brighter. We have both seen, at first hand, General-Secretary<br />
Gorbachev's determination to reform Soviet society and the<br />
Soviet economy, and to find new directions in his country's<br />
foreign policy, often in quite dramatic ways, Afghanistan<br />
being the most immediate example. I </p>
<p>Mr Gorbachev has already made a more substantive contribution<br />
to the lessening of international tension and the building of<br />
a constructive relationship with the United States than any<br />
previous Soviet leader.<br />
At the same time I am confident that under George Bush the<br />
United States will continue to play an active, responsible<br />
and constructive role in shaping the international<br />
environment. Mr Prime Minister, there is now a very real opportunity for<br />
us to capitalise on these developments and to encourage the<br />
process even further. We must set our sights high.<br />
This is especially true in the field of disarmament.<br />
Substantial progress has already been made. Nevertheless,<br />
arms control and disarmament remain the greatest challenge<br />
facing all of us as we seek to transform decisively an<br />
international environment which has encouraged a massive and<br />
wasteful diversion of scarce resources towards the creation<br />
of the instruments of war.<br />
Australia and India have different views on some elements of<br />
the disarmament debate, notably over the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty. India's views are well known. For<br />
our part, we regard the NPT as a vitally important instrument<br />
of arms control.<br />
But our overall objective must be and I believe is the<br />
same: neither of us can accept a world held ransom by the<br />
threat of nuclear holocaust.<br />
In South Asia, Australia has watched with concern the threat<br />
of nuclear proliferation. We therefore welcome the recent<br />
positive step taken by you and Prime Minister Bhutto in<br />
signing an agreement prohibiting attacks on each other's<br />
nuclear installations. We earnestly hope this will lead to<br />
further steps which can help to assure that nuclear programs<br />
pursued in the region are directed solely towards peaceful<br />
non-explosive uses.<br />
We are both committed to the concept of creating an Indian<br />
Ocean Zone of Peace as an integral element of a co-operative<br />
and interdependent region.<br />
Just as a concerted effort is required in the area of arms<br />
control, so too we must work towards the establishment of a<br />
freer and fairer trading environment. We must ensure that<br />
the disappointment of the Montreal mid-term review of the<br />
Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations is not repeated in Geneva<br />
in two months time. </p>
<p>Australia stands ready to work more closely with India to<br />
achieve a world where peace and security, democracy and<br />
economic well-being are realities, not just distant<br />
aspirations. These are, of course, highly ambitious goals. But neither<br />
Australia nor India has ever been afraid of setting our<br />
sights high, whether in the pursuit of better lives for our<br />
peoples, or in the shaping of the world political and<br />
economic environment. Neither of us has ever seen this as a<br />
task to be left exclusively to the superpowers or to the<br />
major world economies. We both demand a right to have our<br />
voice heard.<br />
SOur prospects of success in these great endeavours, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, are significantly enhanced by the fact that we are<br />
working towards these goals together.<br />
In particular we have a great task ahead of us in keeping<br />
pressure on the South African regime to dismantle its ugly<br />
and abhorrent system of apartheid, I pay tribute to the<br />
leading role that you have played, Mr Prime Minister, in the<br />
Commonwealth and in other forums, in articulating the<br />
arguments and increasing the pressure for action in this<br />
vital field.<br />
We both welcome, I am sure, the recent consensus decision by<br />
the International Cricket Council to maintain bans on South<br />
Africa and thus to ensure the continuation of Test cricket<br />
into the future.<br />
Prime Minister and Mrs Gandhi, Hazel and I would like to<br />
Shank you again for your wonderful hospitality. As in the<br />
past, we have enjoyed your company. We both look forward to<br />
seeing more of the magnificent Indian cultural heritage on<br />
Saturday, when we travel to the legendary city of Agra.<br />
Mr Prime Minister,<br />
India is the last of four countries I have visited in the<br />
past fortnight. In Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and now in<br />
India I have had the privilege of informing myself through<br />
discussions with the leaders about developments in the<br />
rapidly changing and vitally important Asia-Pacific and South<br />
Asia regions.<br />
In this way Australia seeks to improve its knowledge of and<br />
involvement in the challenges and opportunities of these<br />
countries. I trust too that visits such as this demonstrate<br />
again the commitment of Australia to these regions, our<br />
determination to become involved in a positive way in them,<br />
our openness to them and our identification with them.<br />
I I </p>
<p>In all of the countries I have visited, the flame of<br />
democracy is burning bright. It is fitting, and enormously<br />
uplifting, to conclude my visit in this great nation that is<br />
proudly, deeply, unalterably democratic.<br />
I close on this point: as we enter the 1990s, with hope and<br />
confidence and prudence, Australia and India will draw<br />
strength and wisdom from the certain knowledge that it is<br />
only democracy that will fully equip us to meet the<br />
challenges that await us.<br />
