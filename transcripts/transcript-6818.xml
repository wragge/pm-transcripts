PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT1 OF PRESS CON* FERE~ NCE I1) BART<br />
24 January 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: oil prices.<br />
PM: Well, it is like so much ini economics. It is usually<br />
a mixture. Obviously the Cover xmnent is going to have to<br />
consider this when we next come to review, which is March<br />
the 1st, that is the next set time. And at that stage we<br />
will be looking at both thc price of cruide and at the level.<br />
of the Australian dollar. I think it is quite obvious that<br />
there will be some relief. But; what has got to be understood<br />
is that with the fall in price, if we just simply applied<br />
the IPP, then that could a very, very significant fall in<br />
revenue to governmnft. So those things have to be taken<br />
in account.<br />
JOURNALIST: IS there any suggestion that the Government<br />
would try to maintain prices at a higher rate artificially?<br />
PM: It wouldn't be a question of artificially. I can't<br />
at this stage, until tho Cabinet considers all the circumstances,<br />
say what the outcome will be because it depends upon the<br />
two factors. It depends upon the pr-iCe of crude. And there<br />
is a mixture of the official price and the spot price, as<br />
you know. And it is a question of where the levc-l of the<br />
Australian dollar is. So it would be precipitate of me<br />
at this stage to say just what the outcome would be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any threat to the tax cuts promised?<br />
PM: NO.<br />
JOURNALlIt'Y. Arc you caying thore Is no consideration will<br />
take place before March 1?<br />
P'M: There wi] ll be a lot of consideration. But I am saying<br />
* that is when the next decision has to be taken. Last year<br />
we made it clear that we would review this every couple<br />
of months or so. And the next review dated for the first<br />
of March. And Cabinet will obviously before then~ be considering<br />
tho implications of it. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I-ow much of a loss of revenue are we talking<br />
about? PM: Put it thin way. If there were to be a drop of say<br />
eight to ten dollars a barrell, we talk in US terms in oil<br />
prices, if there were to be a drop of' eight to ten dollars<br />
a barrell and there were no change at all in Lthe policy,<br />
then that could mean a loss of about one and a half billion<br />
dollars in revenue. Now that is a lot of bickies.<br />
JOURNALisTr: What sort of options are before the Gok~ crnment?<br />
PM: It is too early to say because we don't know now what<br />
the price will be there and what the exchange rate will I<br />
be. And that will be a determinative influence. So all<br />
I cart say is that there are obvious Plus features in, not<br />
only for Australia but for much of the world in the reduction<br />
in oil prices, but because successive governments in Australia,<br />
since 1978, when the parity pricing policy was introduced<br />
by the Fraser Government, successive governments have come<br />
to rely for a significant part of revenue upon this policy.<br />
Anid so that has to be taken into account.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any chance that poliuy might be abandoned?<br />
PM: NO. I am not talking about abandonment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Change?<br />
PM: What I say is this. We have been in office now for<br />
nearly three years and we have shown, I think more than<br />
any other government in recent memory, a capacity for soundb<br />
economic management to take account of changes in the economic[<br />
scene and to have economic policies settings which are calculated<br />
to keop economic growth going in this country. And wc will<br />
continue to make the right decisions in the period ahead.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think retail petrol prices are too high<br />
at present?<br />
PM: It depends who you ask. As a motorist I would say,<br />
and everyone would say, that they are always too high.<br />
if you ask a retailer, well they are probably not high enough.<br />
He is not getting enough. And if you make the comparison<br />
with the rest of the world, still generally speaking, Australian<br />
retail prices are lower than most of the rest of' the world.<br />
So it just depends what your standard of judgement is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you see any benefits in Mr Gray's<br />
idea of taking young people off the dole?<br />
PM : You will excuse me if T have a little bit of mirth<br />
about Mr Gray putting himself forward as some authority<br />
on unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. The fact<br />
is that Tasmiania has the worst unemployment figures of any<br />
state in Australia. And that ~ after three years of' Mr<br />
Cray. Now for him, in the thA&amp; of an election, to throw<br />
up an idea about youth unemployment does provoke a little<br />
bit of mirth. He has had three years. lic has produced<br />
the worst situation in Australia. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Would the idea work?.<br />
PM: I doubt it. Well, he won't have the opportunity of<br />
bringing it into effect. I don'. t think he will be there<br />
but I doubt even if he were to' be re-elected whether hie<br />
would proceed with it.<br />
JOURNALIST: The proposal that young people do community<br />
work rather than<br />
PM: The concept of being involved in community work is<br />
one which we have developed in many respects. But underlying<br />
the proposal as I understand it is the concept that there<br />
is always part-time work there waiting to be done. Where<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what would you do for a. State Labor<br />
Government if it was elected. YOu talked yesterday about<br />
cooperation with Mr Wriedt. I am Just asking can you be<br />
more specific?<br />
PM: I have had the opportunity of discussing with Mr Wricdt<br />
his plans for Tasmania ' 86 and beyond. And there is a<br />
lot of imagination in that. And we will obviously be prepared<br />
to cooperate with him in trying to give effect to that.<br />
The point I was trying to make was this, that there is<br />
in relations between government, much depends upon attitudes.<br />
Now more than any other state leader Mr Gray has believed<br />
in the policy of confrontation, misrepresentation. If you<br />
have that attitude on the part of a State Premier it is<br />
very difficult to maximise the relations between governments.<br />
It is just a matter of human nature whether you are talking<br />
about governments or whether you are talking about groups<br />
or whether you are talking about individuals. If the attitude<br />
of one is confrontationalism, misrepresentaLion you aro<br />
just not going to maximise your relationship. In the case<br />
of Mr Wriedt, we know one another. We have<br />
known Or%&amp; 3nother for many yearC..<br />
There is a respect, a knowledge and a shared concept of<br />
cooperation rather than confrontation. Out of that sort<br />
of context you are going to get boLter results.<br />
JOURNALIST: the spirit of the woodchip agreement by<br />
putting in domestic logging roads?<br />
PM: I don't want to get Loo far into that. Let me say<br />
this. The evidence is fairly clear that since the Commonwealth<br />
made the decision in regard to the woodchip industry, there<br />
have been some attempts down here by the State Government<br />
to foment this issue in an electoral situation. That doesn't<br />
do anyone any good.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible question<br />
PM: I think they know where their beat bet is. a </p>
