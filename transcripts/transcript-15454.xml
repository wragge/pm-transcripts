<p>The drought is continuing to have a devastating impact on much of rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>Without urgent Spring rain, crops are expected to fail in the coming weeks - placing further strain on an already deeply stressed farm sector.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of rural and regional Australia as the drought continues to bite.</p>
<p>The Government's spending on income support and interest rate subsidies for drought-hit regions is more than $26 million a week. Since 2001 more than $2.4 billion has been spent on drought assistance.</p>
<p>If more is needed to ensure our regional communities and farms survive this prolonged drought it will be provided.</p>
<p>Our Budget is in a healthy position and this enables us to generously support those in need when natural disasters strike. It is one of the great dividends of our current prosperity. </p>
<p>With the drought continuing, the status of our water storages is also parlous.</p>
<p>The latest expert advice shows that despite some rainfall in the past months, our storages on average are in a worse state than at this time last year.</p>
<p>Unless there is plentiful rain in the immediate term, further contingencies will be required to maintain critical supplies in the Murray- Darling Basin.</p>
<p>My government has an ambitious plan to secure water supplies in the Murray-Darling Basin - the nation's food bowl - but it is being blocked by the Victorian Labor Government.</p>
<p>The plan outlined almost eight months ago would put more water back into the system by piping and lining leaky irrigation channels.</p>
<p>With the water shortage at a critical level, it is hard to understand why the state Labor Government in Victoria continues to play politics on such an important national issue.</p>
