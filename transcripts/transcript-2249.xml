OPEN4ING OF NORVJICH UNION HO[ USE<br />
SYDNEY N. S. W. 2 JULY 1970<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Ramsay, Distinguished Guests from Overseas, Ladies and Gv-, ntlemen:<br />
I am glad to be here this afternoon to croak out a blessing on this<br />
new building. It is particularly appropriate, I think, considering the way I feel this<br />
afternoon, because if I feel the same way tomorrow afternoon, Sir, you are likely<br />
to get a new policy-holder. They call it Asian flu. I think it is probably a bit of a<br />
reflection on Asia. But whatever it is, you have had it and I have got it.<br />
As you say, Sir, I do seem to be having quite a run of Openings this<br />
week. Tullamarine airport one day I hope you will continue to call it Tullamarine,<br />
and today one new building pointing to the skies and adding significantly to what<br />
is already an exciting skyline in Sydney.<br />
I think that both these occasions remind us of the expansion going on all<br />
around us in Australia today which will, I am sure, continue unabated through the<br />
decade that lies ahead of us.<br />
Now, it is quite right, Mr. Ramsay, that in Melbourne one indicated<br />
that the enterprise one was opening would continue to work for twenty-four hours<br />
a day. And I am not going to take your advice as to Norwich Union employees,<br />
because unless i miss my guess they are so widespread throughout the Mo rld that there<br />
is not one hour of the day whenr some Norwich Union employee is not working<br />
somewhere to write some policy for t: ae betterment Gf hurnariity in general.<br />
Sir, this Company has had an active association with Australia, going<br />
back for more thar. one hundred years and I am happy in the presence of your<br />
London Principals, to acknowledge your company's established place in our highly<br />
competitive insurance industry, to acknowledge its service to its policy-holders,<br />
and to acknowledge its contribution through investment to our national development.<br />
It is a mutual society. It is a society where the profits do not get siphoned off,<br />
but whev~ e those who are policy-holders share in the growth of the enterprise, and<br />
where the country in which it is established shares in the growth of the enterprise,<br />
because as I am sure youi know, Sir, some thirty per cent of investments of funds<br />
made by insurance companies are required by law which some people think is<br />
wrong, but I think is at least convenient, to invest thirty per cenPt of their funds<br />
in what I will call developmental activities so that it can help the building of schools<br />
and roads and hospitals and all the other matters which both State and Commonwealth<br />
Governments seek to bring to the people of this country. ./ 2 </p>
<p>So it is not just something which is a busineas, although of course it is<br />
a business, but is something which helps the community in wA~ i. Jch it is established<br />
and &amp; tiSti, r , is saying something of some magnitude because the rapid expansion<br />
of the insurance business in Australia is a very clear reflection of the health and<br />
growth of Australia and is of no small magnitude. I understa:-A that life insurance<br />
investment in Australia now exceeds 000 million arid is increasing at more than<br />
per cent a year and we are delighted that this should be so, we are delighted<br />
that you should be building up your own enterprise in this way, not seeking as<br />
happened some time ago, to take over an Australian life company in the process. I<br />
quote those figures because of the importance which I do attach, and which we do<br />
attach, to insurance funds in Australia because of what I have already spoken of<br />
as the great contributionit makes to investment, to Australia's progress.<br />
Now I do have some statistics here which -may be interesting because I<br />
am told that we are cane of the world's most insurance-minded countries, and that<br />
taking the ratio of premiums to national income as a guide, we rank second with<br />
Canada in all the countries of the world, with America being the leader, and if you<br />
take dollars per head spent on premiums, then we rank, fourth after America, Canada<br />
and Switzerland. For tho) se who are interested in precise figures, which I imagine,<br />
Sir, insurance people are, the exact figures in United States dollars spent per head<br />
are: United States $ 277, Canada $ 150, Switzerland $ 134 and Australia $ 115. As<br />
we grow, as we will in the decade in front of us, I have no doubt that we will be<br />
rated second and that will be good for you and for your policy holders and for us.<br />
I think that the establishment of this building by the Norwich Union shows<br />
the confidence that company has in the future of this nation of Australia. I am certain<br />
that confidence is not misplaced. I am positive that in the decade ahead we will grow,<br />
and grow more rapidly with each passing year. That we will have our problems, as<br />
we do now have our problems, is obvious. We have our problems with our rural<br />
industries caught in a cost-price squeeze, the price being uii-ab: le to be decided by the<br />
producer or by this government. We have diff iculties which are inherent in the<br />
growth of big cities, the rapid growth of great cities, and we have a requirement to<br />
give our young people going out to marry a capacity to buy laild and houses not<br />
without effort because these things have always required effort and always should, but<br />
at least without undue effort, and this is also a problem that is with us now.<br />
But there has never been a country at any stage in the woxk which has<br />
not had problems. We have got them. But the opportunities we have got so far<br />
outweigh them that we will, I believe, in the next decade, be almost a transformed<br />
nation and will., have fully justified Norwich Union's own faith in our future as<br />
exemplified by this building which I now take pleasure in officially declaring open. </p>
