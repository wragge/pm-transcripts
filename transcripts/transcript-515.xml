AUSTRALIAN MEDIICA ASSOCIATION C ONR1SS<br />
ADELAIDE. 19TH 1.7 l7 T<br />
j. peech by he inster the Rt on, , Go enzie.<br />
Sir, If there is one thing olitirian likes to be it is<br />
safe. Those of you who are not politicians wouldn't understand<br />
that. But what I mean is that this meeting has, so far as I can<br />
make out tonight, been open for at least two or three days.<br />
Therefore I run no risk of a Censure motion if I now declare it<br />
open. ( Laughter) There is another thing that I would like to say to you<br />
and that is that I compliment, if I may, Dr. Colville a r. I: L of<br />
eminence from my electorate ( Laughter) on having been elected as<br />
the first President of the Australian Medical Association; and I<br />
am delighted to think that he should succeed, not technically but<br />
substantially, Sir Henry, about whom all I want to say is this:<br />
that I think my grandchildren will be inclined to boast that<br />
' granpa knew him'. ( Applause)<br />
Now having said that I want to tell you that I have a<br />
slight grievance; and the grievance is that, as so many of you<br />
may have found in your time, I find myself naked before the<br />
medical profession, ( Laughter) I have stood in this lovely Hall<br />
( Bonython) more than once indeed once I was counted out much to<br />
my pleasure ( Laughter) wearing the garmats appropriate to the<br />
unearned honours that I have acauired in my life. Tonight here I<br />
am, you know, looking like a well-fed penguin ( Laughter) while all<br />
the rest of them are here manifesting themselves in robes of<br />
glory. And I don't think this is right, because I would have you<br />
know, ladies and gentlemen, that I m. a, for some reason that<br />
escapes me, a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of<br />
Plysicians ( Laughter)( Applause) not that I have ever noticed<br />
any fiscal results of such a position; and, what is more<br />
remarkable is that I am, I'm happy to say, as I was astonished to<br />
discover, a Fellow of the Royal College of Gynaecologists.<br />
( Laughter)( Applause) Now you would think, wouldn't you, that a<br />
man with these all-round qualifications ( Laughter) would have been<br />
given a bit of coloured something or other ( Laughter) to wear<br />
tonight? No, The medical profession, having been crossexamined<br />
by the lawyers so successfully for so many years, is<br />
jealous of us and so they said tonight ' Who is this follow?" " Well<br />
he's the Prime Minister"* '" ihat was he in private lifo?"<br />
Somebody generously said " A lawyer" and the result was that they<br />
all said " Let him stand up undccorated:" Take your coat off,<br />
Sir. WeTll I don't need to go beyond that point. So here I am,<br />
But I stand here, not only as a species of lawyer, and<br />
as a species of Prime Minister, but as one of the millions and<br />
millions of people in the wcrld who say " Thank God for the<br />
medical profession". It isn't so long ago that having we don't<br />
have a 40 hour week in my job; nor do we have Saturday morning<br />
off but it wasn't so long ago that having finished what I had<br />
set myself to do on Saturday afternoon in my office, a time of<br />
peace and quiet, the spirit moved me to have a look at the Year<br />
Book. Have any of you ever read the Year Book? I'm astonished<br />
at the illiteracy of people. How many people read the Year Book?<br />
Only the people who want to confound me, in my expirience. But I<br />
road the Year Book and then I wont back and I picked up one ; many<br />
years ago I won't toll you how many years ago in ord.; r to find<br />
out what the expectation of life of a male child was in the year<br />
in which I was born. You may think that this exhibited a<br />
melancholy state of mind, but it didn't really, because I found<br />
out that in the course of this relatively brief span of years the<br />
expectation of life had gone up by 16 years. And, may I say to<br />
you, rather more in the ccse of womren. ( Laughter). Now whether<br />
that is purely a psychological factor or not, I don't know. But<br />
there it is 159 lo, 17 years. </p>
<p>We take all. those tlaIngs forr grntd d t we? I f we<br />
riappen to live longor 4Jhan g,, rnnpa-, pa,, we sa," c1 wyntV<br />
rath-er attrbu bc it to ouYr own ; irtue,, u c yuta h<br />

peo hIv don,[ hat thie bio-. ohernists have done, what all thec<br />
people have done wh!, o have beoen preserving hium~ an life, and exendiing<br />
it. This romarkabl-r-evolutionary fact is perhaps not very w, 31l<br />
. known; and not vcery miuch appreciated. dhat we will some day coe<br />
-to the medical profession is noi&amp; yet lanown-, but I think I knov<br />
something of it myself.<br />
So there you have medical science and the prolongation<br />
of' the oxpectati. n of life, I have sometirnes tirought of it, Sir,<br />
in these terms-, that in the last ton yoars it hans become a r-hor<br />
mancabre fashi on to road, 6 and th-ink and talk about sputniks, aboub<br />
the marvellous technological achiever. ecnts of the0 people who<br />
develop piropollants and who send thinigs whiizzing around above the<br />

hu-v can you compress a period of medical trairnng uithin. an-y<br />

can reomember whien I was an unde rgraduate it used to be said bY<br />
peopl. e withi high brows that ' really it was nonsense to think athe<br />
modical students werent educated!, -JeJll there Is something<br />
to be said for that you know,, if you look at i~ t in thatfsin<br />
LvJhy couldn't they do a year 6f Arts, or, as I would hiave though;.<br />
mucht bettor, a year in Jurisprudence? No". medical jurisprud nce;<br />
TI don't think: th-at would have done them any good0 ( Laughrter) But<br />
anyhiow . Thv shouldn't they? se at th-at time there was a<br />
disposition to think that within four years of technical teaching<br />
a man might encompass a medical d.-gree. ' loll -4ti gone on,<br />
hasnt i? It stretches out. Not to the crack of doom, but it<br />
stretches out. I just don~ t kniow how you solve theo problem,<br />
except by post-graduate instruction, of enabling a medical student<br />
to be2come a norme2. ly qualifCied raedical practi4tioner when the<br />
boundaries of the knowledge thnat ho must rcach to are extending so<br />
tremendously overy year.-L I dcn~ t solve that problem: I merely<br />
say-that I think tha t I roalise that it oxists,<br />
I hve ad,, comparatively recently2 another problem,,<br />
Th3re ore teaching hospitals in Aust. a, h'pAtl whc r<br />

properly considered the task of' the universitics0Pnd as many of<br />
you know I hnave de voted a fairn~ m of m-. y declining years to<br />

The on) i0. y other thing., Sir that I want to say to you is<br />
that I havori7t yet reached the poin of time at which I believe<br />
that thle relations-hip between thec doctor and hL-is p:, tient is purely<br />
obje ctive_, or sclontific., I don't believe it,. I don't believe -Lt.<br />
The doct'ovs who are hero, 3; theoy t obe inteore. sted in this, but the<br />
retof us. isn't i~ t a i~ iond.,_-, ful ting to have a man comec in to<br />
see you whiom you -trust, whiose j-adgmant you respe_-ctL? This has a<br />
thecrapy if its own. Y,) u ca,, n br~ ing alonlg saestranger, he1 m1ay<br />
hcve all the gadgets in the world, he; r. ay do -, 11 these things andt<br />
theacy are vastly important but I still reim-ain of the opinion that<br />
theire are few things to equal theo therapeutic va-luea of the<br />
confidence that the patient has in theo doctor. This means that<br />
the persona-l rc2l-tien: ah,-* p betwee3n the doctor and the patient m.-ust<br />
neve; r be destrod3 Aplme<br />
My own Go-v.-rriaent hais tried to recognise this by this<br />
rich voluntary element in what we do, But in particular I was<br />
intere sted, I wias m,-ore, than interested the otheor day when Sir<br />
Douglas arrived fron New Zee,, Lm_-d and had a i-. ord to say for the<br />
general practitione r. ( Ap iauso) qTho an.-I tGo iaave a word to say<br />
against the specialists' I balieve in theo spci-a]. ists. But the<br />
esse-nce of medical practice4the wh-ole sub-strratum of meldical<br />

practitioner who knovs the i'anily, and who is knovmr by them, who<br />
is wise, whlo doesn't atter.-pt to go beyond his course because<br />
