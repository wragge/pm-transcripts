FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 27 MARCH, 19<br />
ADDRESSTO AUSTRALIAN LIBERAL SUET,,-1<br />
FEDERATION RR<br />
Tamie and I are honoured that you have chosen in t us<br />
way to commemorate my 25 years in the Commonwealth Pa I ament.<br />
Indeed, it is a great night for the Liberal Party, gathered<br />
as we are in the name of a great cause within the walls of<br />
one of Australia's great universities.<br />
Perhaps the ultimate pleasure is that we can boast a gathering<br />
of this size in what is surely not a heart-land of Liberalism.<br />
Because this -is a commemorative occasion, there is a tendency<br />
to reflect, to walk * over the past. There is no harm in this.<br />
So long as it informs us about the directions we should take<br />
in the future. Indeed there is some fascination in comparing<br />
the changing face of Australia during those 25 years.<br />
In 1955 there were 10 universities in Australia.. Now there<br />
are 19. There were 49,000 students in tertiary education;<br />
now there are 317,000. Since I came to Parliament our population<br />
has increased by over 5 million. The percentage of our<br />
population born overseas has risen from 14 per cent to about<br />
per cent. Average weekly earnings rose in real terms ( 74/ 75)<br />
from $ 87 to $ 152. GDP per head rose in money terms from $ 1,056<br />
to $ 7,091 in real terms from $ 2,600 to $ 4,800.<br />
In 1955, there were 220 cars per thousand head of population.<br />
In 1977, there were 463. In 25 years, our national development<br />
has undergone tremendous change. A rich artistic and cultural<br />
talent today complements our national purpose. The world of<br />
theatre, opera, ballet, film, science, literature and sport<br />
has produced great Australians.<br />
Their greatness has been measured against the best in the world.<br />
Rarely has it been found wanting. It is a story of diversity<br />
and achievement, for our size, perhaps unparalleled throughout<br />
the world. But we have to be careful in looking back.<br />
For what one sees is often blurred by time or reduced to a<br />
series of incidents, often not truly representative of the<br />
past. Moreover, the excitement of life belongs to the future,<br />
to what is going to happen tomorrow, next year, in the next decade.<br />
The future invites a contemplation of the people and the ideas<br />
that will influence events; of the challenges and contests that<br />
will engage our energies; of the kind of society that ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
this will bring. The fascination about the future is that it is<br />
unknown and therefore uncertain; and so still capable of being<br />
influenced by. people with ideas and convictions. That provides<br />
a challenge to us all.<br />
With confidence in ourselves and confidence in the capacity<br />
of the Australian people we can look to the future with hope<br />
and justified optimism.<br />
In the years ahead, we will be met by challenge and change.<br />
But let me talk just for a moment about some changes in the<br />
past because that could be instructive for the future. When<br />
I first entered Parliament the circumstances confronting<br />
Australia then were considerably different from those we are<br />
experiencing now. It was 10 years after the War; only 4 years<br />
since we signed a peace treaty with Japan. Australians, living<br />
through those times, had been haunted by the fear of invasion<br />
and occupation.<br />
The War and the successful fight for Australian freedom left<br />
indelible memories, inspired in us a pride in what had been<br />
achieved. It left us all with an obligation to the past and<br />
a great responsibility to the future. our fathers had fought<br />
through depression and war for a belief and an ideal. We owed<br />
it to them to take up the fight for the kind of Australia in which<br />
they believed. We have an obligation to our children to see that<br />
we hand on that freedom, extended and enriched.<br />
Understandably, the Australian of the decades immediately after<br />
the War was fiercely independent with great reserves of ambition<br />
and pride. It was not until 1949, when Sir Robert Menzies came<br />
to power that war time controls, restrictions and restraints were<br />
removed.<br />
This unleashed the enthusiasm, energies and creativity of the<br />
Australian people. When these became allied to the new opportunities<br />
activity, productivity and investment grew and diversified through<br />
the 50s and<br />
Our international trading reputation, built on our great rural<br />
industries, was expanded and broadened by a developing manufacturing<br />
sector. Much of this was made possible by a massive migration<br />
programme, bipartisan in concept and execution, which has<br />
enormously enriched Australia's culture and traditions.<br />
Foreign investment brought new technology and skills. Because<br />
of the conviction and faith in Australians; because<br />
of their willingness to accept the opportunities in front of them;<br />
and encouraged by a government committed to freedom in enterprise;<br />
Australia became a land of greater opportunity, producing men and<br />
women of adventure and achievement. Added to that, the mineral<br />
boom brought with it new technologies, new markets, new communities<br />
in remote areas, and new thrusts in decentralisation. The very<br />
successes of the post-war years.-the expansion of Australian<br />
well-being; the quality of Australian home and family life; these<br />
brought with them the belief that they would continue forever;<br />
that difficulty and hardship were things of the past; that there<br />
was no longer a need to strive for a successful future. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Many came to believe that these successes were ours as a right<br />
rather than a reward for effort and achievement. By the<br />
success had brought its own temptations. As Liberals, we were no<br />
less guilty than others. We continued to believe in our<br />
principles but we failed to fight for them. Our dedication,<br />
our idealism, our creativity seemed to dissipate. We did<br />
not adequately recognise that success for individuals,<br />
as for the nation, must be earned.<br />
Whatever the cause, we developed a short sightedness about<br />
the challenge of our political opponents. We took our futures.<br />
for granted and put them in peril. The electorate rang with the<br />
sound of Labor slogans. We were told that Labor would be moderate,<br />
mild, responsible and reasonable, some of us even believed it.<br />
Labor's audience was young,, new and receptive. For them the war<br />
was only history. We had all forgotten the obligations that<br />
freedom imposed. The 70s brought ever-increasing community<br />
expectations unaccompanied by any corresponding commitment to<br />
productivity. The Labor Party encouraged and yielded to these<br />
demands with a whole range of policies and promises for a better<br />
life; for an easier future without effort, without commitment.<br />
In these years, we lost the understanding that as a nation we can<br />
only consume what we produce that dedication to economic growth<br />
is essential if the community demands are to be met. The<br />
contribution to be made to community life by excellence and<br />
achievement gained only limited recognition. Where the crises<br />
of the past were surmounted by the collective commitment of<br />
individual Australians, the 70s became a decade of expectations<br />
devoid of a commitment to obligation, merit, excellence or<br />
exertion. Inevitably, the seeds of inflation were sown; our<br />
industries lost their competitiveness; the rise in<br />
unemployment was guaranteed. The Australian government then,<br />
with those of other countries, was slow to recognise the<br />
corroding effects of inflation. We were overtaken by weakness<br />
in management and by defects in policy.<br />
And as if that were not enough, by 1974, a new external challenge<br />
confronted us the first world oil crisis. For the world as<br />
a whole the switch from low to high cost energy over night<br />
transformed a limited down-turn in the world economy into a<br />
full-scale recession.<br />
Of course, Australia was affected by these events, but they were<br />
effects which were significantly avoidable. We were one of the<br />
few amongst world economies with great natural resources; rich<br />
endowments of energy and a long record of lower inflation. But<br />
instead of policies designed to minimise the effects of adverse<br />
overseas events, Australia pursued policies that compounded<br />
these effects. As a result our international competitiveness<br />
was lost.<br />
In 1975, as in 1949, the Liberal Party was called upon by<br />
the people to revive the national spirit. I appealed then to<br />
Australians to retain their idealism; their faith in<br />
institutions; their sense of reform; their dedication<br />
in democracy. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
I called upon them for a return to Liberal values. I urged<br />
them to recall what they had see-mingly forgotten, that<br />
we must " reward personal initiative, encourage investment..<br />
and mobilise the imagination and the resources of the<br />
Australian people...."<br />
It was met by a comprehensive response from the Australian<br />
electorate. Now, as we enter the 80s, our undeniable<br />
successes are testimony to the judgement of the Australian people.<br />
Indeed, thinking about this occasion tonight, and its significance<br />
to all of us, to Tamie and myself after 25 years in politics, my<br />
over-riding feeling is one of simple good fortune at being an<br />
Australian; pride in having this country in which to bring up<br />
our family; in being privileged enough over a reasonable period<br />
of time to see and take part in Australia's growth and development<br />
as a nation.<br />
We are indisputably a country of modest size, but a country of real<br />
strength. How often is this not adequately recognised by Australians?<br />
How often do we see Australians self-effacing, almost apologetic<br />
about Australia? Is it because we are awed by older countries<br />
larger in population, more powerful in material things. Is it<br />
because Australia's mere 80 years as a nation breeds a lack of<br />
confidence in ourselves and what we can achieve? Do we believe<br />
that Australia's role is to support and follow rather than<br />
contribute and lead? That diffidence, I believe, is unjustified<br />
and its time is past. We are learning to contribute in the world;<br />
to pursue our own thoughts and ideas. I increasingly find a<br />
new sense of confidence, pride and direction in Australia.<br />
These will continue while we maintain conviction and belief that<br />
what we seek is worth pursuing and that we are prepared to work<br />
for it. This will be essential as we face an increasingly<br />
difficult international position. Many major economies are in<br />
trouble with high and rising inflation. The growth of world<br />
markets is slow. Major economies will produce less this year<br />
than last. There is no prospect of a fall in international<br />
unemployment. That means, that in resolving our own difficulties,<br />
Australia cannot look for help from world events.<br />
What we do, we must do for ourselves. We are in a much be tter<br />
position than many other countries. In the United States,<br />
inflation is running at 16%; in the United Kingdom at 18%.<br />
In the United States interest rates have hit 19%. Both countries<br />
are major influences on world events and are in real<br />
difficulties. They are tackling those problems, but they will take time to cure.<br />
It is worth noting because of the strength of our economy; because<br />
of our lower rates of inflation; because of the strength of our<br />
balance of payments; because of the strength of our rural and<br />
export industries;* because of investment opportunities here;<br />
these overseas events impacted upon Australia much less than they<br />
would have in earlier times.<br />
On top of extraordinarily difficult economic problems, major<br />
world countries are now having to respond to a worsening strategic<br />
situation. The Russian invasion of Afghanistan has been<br />
condemned throughout the free world. </p>
<p>The United States is increasing its defence expenditure<br />
greatly.<br />
We are adding to outs. Such a stand should be taken in the<br />
defence of freedom; but inevitably there is a price to be<br />
paid and the necessity of defence decisions has accelerated<br />
inflationary expectations in the USA. That only compounds<br />
economic difficulties confronting major economies.<br />
By any standards the international situation is a difficult one.<br />
Against this background it is possible to still pronounce<br />
confidence in, and optimism for, Australia's future in the<br />
1980s. There are sound reaons. our inflation rate is below<br />
that of most of our major trading partners; we are internationally<br />
competitive; costs are down; exports are up; and employment<br />
is rising.<br />
These are significant achievements; achievements of government<br />
economic management and policies. Because of this, we are<br />
attracting more investment to Australia than would otherwise<br />
be the case. In the two years since 1977, over 6 billion dollars<br />
has been spent on major new investment works in and around<br />
Australia. Now, projects worth nearly three times that amount stand ready<br />
to go. This is a direct result of the transfer of economic<br />
power from government to the private sector, coupled to the<br />
willingness with which the private sector has responded. It is<br />
a paradox that the energy crisis which poses enormous difficulties<br />
for western countries and significant difficulties for us, also<br />
carries with it significant advantages for Australia.<br />
We are one of the few energy exporting countries amongst the<br />
western world. Certainly we are short of oil, but natural gas,<br />
uranium, black and brown coal we have in abundance. We have<br />
relatively abundant and cheap supplies of coal-based<br />
electricity that attracts to us greater investment and<br />
greater opportunities.<br />
The possession of natural resources, and adequate supplies<br />
of energy are coming together to provide the prospects for<br />
a great decade in the 80s. Resource and energy investment<br />
opportunities will provide strength to our economy in the years<br />
ahead, providing an international perception of a strong Australia.<br />
Central to the government's success in attracting investment is<br />
the fact that now, as after 1949, we have pursued policies which<br />
recognise private enterprise as the engine of growth and progress.<br />
our economy has been structured in such a way as to limit the<br />
economic power that resides with the government. Indeed, the.<br />
aim of Liberal economic organisation is to produce a multiplicity<br />
of economic power centres because this in turn expands choice<br />
and with that, the economy begins to absorb innovation,<br />
technological change and efficiency. ./ 6 </p>
<p>6--<br />
It becomes accountable; it capable of responding to<br />
market adjustment. It of fer:--the opportunity of reward for<br />
risk taking. However, if government accepts the responsibility<br />
to provide such an economic climate in which investment<br />
is worthwhile; in which there are adequate rewards for<br />
risk taking; in which the incentiJves offered by the economy<br />
and available markets provide just return on capital,<br />
technology and expertise; then this carries with it a<br />
corresponding commitment from business to live with the<br />
difficulties and risks of a free enterprise system, in return<br />
for accepting its rewards.<br />
By world standards, the Australian economy is strong. By<br />
world standards, the Australian economy is in good shape.<br />
That is not to say that there are no threats or dangers.<br />
of course there are.<br />
In Australia, a constant determination is required because<br />
of the problems posed by-Left wing dominated trade unions.<br />
Not only in this country, but also overseas, the power of<br />
trade unionism has increased to the point where it constitutes<br />
perhaps the greatest single threat to economic health and<br />
the economic and political freedoms of individual citizens.<br />
There are those who say in the face of union disputes that<br />
the rule of law is inappropriate for their resolution. That<br />
all that is needed is reason and negotiation.<br />
It must bie remembered that several unions have enormous<br />
economic resources, far greater than some corporations; with<br />
the capacity to affect the life of many more people in<br />
the community than any corporation. Yet, when the director<br />
of a business corporation abuses his power, in other words,<br />
when he breaks the law, nobody suggests that he should not<br />
be charged, fined or even jailed. People just say the law<br />
has been broken; a business leader has abused the<br />
privilege of his position.<br />
Yet trade union leaders often with more power than abusiness<br />
director, believe they should be outside the rule<br />
of law. They cause enormous disrut-ption and hardship. They<br />
can send industries bankrupt.<br />
Yet these same men turn their backs and say the law has<br />
no relevance; that we must negotiate;'** that we must be<br />
reasonable; that we must se'\ what is acceptable to the<br />
Transport Workers' Union oi to Mr. Halfpenny and then accept<br />
that.<br />
That is not the kind of Australia you want to live in. It is<br />
not the kind of Australia I intend to live in. No Government<br />
can afford to reach the position where major economic<br />
decisions are taken in fear of reprisal from the Union movement.<br />
Yet in New South Wales it was the Transport Workers' Union,<br />
notthe Government, not Premier Wran, who determined priorities<br />
for emergency fuel. That is not the kind of Australia any<br />
Australian would wish to live in. It is not the kind of<br />
Australia that I intend to manage. </p>
<p>7<br />
Apologists for the exercise of excessive union power argue,<br />
that the rule of law is itself provocative. That it<br />
represents a prescription for confrontation. What kind<br />
of logic is that?<br />
Consider the recent strike situation. Because of unions,<br />
industry was closed down: the community was immobilised:<br />
Australians in their day-to-day lives were inconvenienced<br />
because of decisions taken consciously and deliberately<br />
by Left Wing union leaders. They were decisions taken in<br />
defiance of the community interest.<br />
It is the Union Movement which has confronted the whole<br />
of the Australian community and pursued alleged union rights<br />
exclusively at the expense of community rights.<br />
Nobody could suggest that it was the Government which sought<br />
confrontation. We will do much to seek solutions through<br />
conciliation and negotiation. But we will not betray<br />
reason we will not accept unreasonable demands.<br />
When a large and powerful corporation combines with a large<br />
and powerful union to deny the right of supply of goods<br />
to an individual, then a serious situation has arisen within<br />
our society, within the relevant industry and within the<br />
Union movement.<br />
The situation in which Mr. Laidely has found himself is the<br />
result of an agreement reached between the union and the<br />
corporation. The Arbitration Commission called the<br />
parties to a conference. The petrol distributor was not<br />
asked to participate. The corporations and the union, under<br />
the auspices of the Commission, but without the distributor,<br />
came to an agreement that determined the distributor's fate.<br />
Mr. Laidely was disposed of in his absence.<br />
The Government has requested the parties to inake public<br />
the terms of that agreement but without success. If thfat<br />
agreement were made public, the wider Australian community<br />
would understand very plainly the full weight of this<br />
Government's concern.<br />
If individual freedoms are to be protected from the excesses<br />
of corporation or union power then the framework of the law<br />
within our community must underline the right of survival<br />
of business and the freedom of Australian citizens. Small<br />
businesses in Australia employ up to two million people, a<br />
large part of the workforce. They need to know that there<br />
is adequate protection under the law. ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
If two corporations combine to deny supply to a third party,<br />
it is against the current provisions of the Trade Practices<br />
Act. But if, as in the case in New South Wales, a large<br />
corporation and a powerful union come to an arrangement that<br />
denies supply to a third party, the present law would permit it.<br />
Ministers have been working on this matter and I hope that<br />
decisions can be announced next week, approving amendments<br />
to the Trade Practices Act.<br />
I want to make one other point in relation to this case. The<br />
Arbitration Commission has a powerful influence on Australia's<br />
affairs, being vested with responsibility for settling industrial<br />
disputes. : c believe that all Australians would support me when I say<br />
t~ hat the way in which the responsibilities of the Commission<br />
are accepted should be one which provides for the settlement<br />
of disputes according to the concepts of justice and fairness.<br />
I believe the community would be appalled by any suggestion<br />
t: hat disputes be settled on the basis of power alone.<br />
I~ n this case it is hard to avoid the conclusion that it was<br />
ithe exercise of power which determined the outcome.<br />
There are also many in the community who would believe<br />
t~ hat the manner in which disputes are settled is at least<br />
as important as the nature of the settlement. In other<br />
words, the end does not justify the means.<br />
Just as there are problems and opportunities at home,<br />
so there are abroad. In tackling the problems in seizing<br />
the opportunities in international affairs, our alliances<br />
are of obvious importance to us. But because we are an<br />
A. N. Z. U. S. partner with the United States, and closer, perhaps,<br />
in that alliance than at any time since its signature, that does<br />
niot mean we agree with every manifestation of the USA's<br />
political and strategic policies.<br />
We were founded from Britain: but that does not mean that<br />
we inevitably support a British view. The fact that we are<br />
an aligned Western nation is not incompatible with a future that<br />
is dependent upon new trading relationships as well as those<br />
that existed 20 years ago. It is not incompatible with our<br />
pursuing our common interests with India, a country of vastly<br />
different regions and outlooks to Australia. it is not<br />
incompatible with our taking a view of Africa and influencing<br />
events there in a way which significantly diminishes the<br />
prospects of war and of eventual communist domination of Africa.<br />
I~ f a middle ranking country of Australia's size is to have any<br />
opportunity to influence wider events, it must do so through<br />
reason, through the quality of its arguments. And it is important<br />
that we should take that path. Middle ranking countries should not<br />
just sit back and say that the problems are too great, that it is<br />
o~ nly the super powers or the great powers that can influence them.<br />
The world and our future in it is too important for that<br />
abdication. / 19 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Moreover, middle ranking powers who are prepared to pursue<br />
a reasonable path can influence events and have.<br />
Significantly, as a result of these policies, Australia<br />
has won a new respect in diverse forums in the United<br />
States, in Britain; in Europe; in Africa; South East Asia<br />
and the Western Pacific, and indeed in the South Pacific<br />
itself our own immediate region, where we have been<br />
demonstrating a concern for small island states.<br />
Much of this has been achieved by being prepared to examine<br />
issues on their merits, and by rejecting the view that because<br />
we come from the West we can automatically be counted as<br />
part of a Western caucus.<br />
In a number of instances, when we have believed that the Western<br />
Group was too rigid or narrow in its approach, we have struck<br />
out on our own.<br />
And on occasions we have found the Western Group, and countries<br />
from the developing world, moving close, after a time, to<br />
the position we had already taken.<br />
We support the United States when we believe she is right. We<br />
do not support the United States just because it is the<br />
United States. That is well understood and accepted.<br />
But I need to say also that in many of the great issues<br />
affecting the world, Australia's future will inevitably and<br />
significantly depend upon actions and attitudes taken by the<br />
great powers and pre-eminently by the United States. For<br />
there are some things which need doing for the protection and<br />
preservation of the free world that only the largest free<br />
power in the world can accomplish simply because power is<br />
needed for the accomplishment of great objectives.<br />
We all know the dangers the Soviet Union poses to international<br />
peace, the unrelieved pressure, the constant probing, -the<br />
enormous resources devoted to arms as each year passes. The<br />
United States is the only country which can stand against<br />
that. It is the only country with the material power.<br />
It is no more than the plain and accepted truth that in recent<br />
years the United States has been through difficulties. After<br />
Vietnam and Watergate, there were divisions a loss of<br />
direction within the United States.<br />
That has posed difficulties for the whole free world, for the whole<br />
community of independently-minded nations. But in the<br />
United States a few weeks ago, I found a different Americaa<br />
sense of purpose, a sense of conviction, a direction, a unity<br />
behind the President and the Presidency in standing for freedom<br />
and opposing further Soviet aggression. </p>
<p>10<br />
That unity and sense of direction in the United States<br />
generally, which had not been present for many, many years,<br />
perhaps since the War, is most important to any President.<br />
The leadership of the United States must be the loneliest<br />
leadership of all.<br />
President Carter has embarked on the vastly important task<br />
of convincing the Soviet Union that it must not move beyond<br />
Afghanistan, of creating and maintaining pressures against<br />
the Soviet Union while the invasion of Afghanistan lasts,<br />
of seeing to it that the free world of the 80s does not<br />
make the tragic mistakes made in the latter half of the<br />
as step-by-step the world moved closer to the<br />
Second World War.<br />
In that context, the United States' President obviously needs<br />
the support and encouragement of his own Congress, of his<br />
own people. And beyond that, it is my belief and conviction<br />
that the United States, in the matters in which we believe<br />
her to be right, needs the support of other countries such<br />
as Australia.<br />
The United States as the world's greatest free power is very<br />
much aware and very sensible of the responsoibilities that that<br />
entails. They not only want to be right. They want others<br />
to believe and to know that they are right in the course that<br />
they are pursuing for the defence of their freedom and that of<br />
other nations. That is why it is important, if a nation<br />
such as Australia believes the United States is right, that we<br />
say so forthrightly and act accordingly even if at some cost to<br />
ourselves. Without that kind of support, there would be reason<br />
to doubt the capacity of the United States, or of any nation,<br />
to sustain over a period of years the course that will be<br />
necessary if we are to prevent in the 80s all the errors<br />
that an earlier generation of world leadership made in the<br />
The task for all of us is to demonstrate that we are capable of<br />
sustaining an effort over a period of years'which will in an<br />
inevitable and plain way give such a clear signal to the<br />
Soviet Union that they will not embark on any more Afhganistans.<br />
So abroad, as at home, the requirement is to sustain our<br />
beliefs and to work for their realisation. And I am heartened<br />
by the knowledge, as my invitation here tonight confirms, that<br />
there are young people amongst us who, believing in a cause,<br />
are prepared to fight for it.<br />
The success of the Liberal Movement on this campus<br />
has been hard-won. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
But if it derives from a willingness to surmount obstacles,<br />
a readiness to persist when it would be easier to give up,<br />
a determination to succeed no matter the odds, a dedication<br />
to an ideal no matter how much it may be unfashionable; if<br />
this meeting tonight owes its existence to these, then not<br />
only do I congratulate all members of the Monash University<br />
Liberal Club and the Liberal Students Federation, but I do so<br />
in the knowledge that your membership and your participation<br />
has fitted you well for the challengesyou will meet in<br />
the future.<br />
Because challenge will always be with us, victories can never<br />
be won for all time. That is why we must never vacate the<br />
battlefield. What we must do is to win the fight for freedom<br />
and for our beliefs in our time. We must determine to hand<br />
on to our children, conditions and attitudes in society<br />
which allow for the full exploration of individualism and<br />
creative spirit.<br />
We must never allow the beliefs which brought our country<br />
greatness to become corroded.<br />
Thank you for your generous invitation. Thank you for the<br />
courtesy of your welcome and your hospitality. I am confident<br />
that Australia will be well-served in the years ahead while<br />
the spirit and commitment, so evident here tonight, prevail<br />
within our community. 000---</p>
