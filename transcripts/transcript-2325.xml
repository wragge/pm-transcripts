SENATE CAMPAIGN<br />
SUMMING UP BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON </p>
<p>EMIBARGO: 7. 15 pm, Wednesday 18 November, 1270.<br />
The Senate Election is nearing its end. And it is time to sum up the<br />
matters at issue. The results of the election will not change the Government, But<br />
it is, not like an ordinary by-election. For if Labor were to wvin they could frustrate<br />
the Government's programme, delay legislation inordinately, and even refuse supply.<br />
That is why it is just as important to vote for the Government at this<br />
election as it would be to vote for it at a general election. The election itself has<br />
not been an occasion for new policies or new specific promises. For as I said to<br />
you fourteen days ago, when the Campaign opened, the occasion for that was at the<br />
general election last year.<br />
Rather has this election given to Australians the opportunity to consider<br />
the great differences between the Government and the Opposition on matters which<br />
affect Australia's future. Those matters ar-defence, th e makitenance of our<br />
alliances, the management of our economy, and the future of our rural industries.<br />
The differences between us in these fields have become even more<br />
marker' as the Campaign has progressed. For the Opposition would withdraw from<br />
Vietnam regardless of whether or not the South Vietnamese had sufficiently built up<br />
their strength to defend themselves. They would quit as we are in sight of our goal.<br />
We will not. They would withdraw from the Five Power Agreement with Britain, New<br />
Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. We will not. They would reduce the fighting strength<br />
of our Army by a half by abolishing national service. We will riot. They would<br />
damage the AINFUS Treaty by refusing to have joint Australian/ U. S. Defence bases<br />
in Australia. We will preserve and strengthen the Treaty for the sake of our owin<br />
security. They would seek to bring in a 35-hour week. We will not. Our concern<br />
is to raise real wages and living standards, and to get production from which the<br />
requirements of the public in schools and hospitals can be met.<br />
They have no policy to assist rural industry. We have. And we have<br />
spelt it out. There has been some attempt, during the Campaign to put pressure on<br />
me to give specific promises on pension rises. I think it would be wrong to do that<br />
in the course of an election campaign.<br />
Elections are not auctions. / 2 </p>
<p>And I have not once commented-on-the mater of -whether or not pensions<br />
Will be raised in the near future. But I think I can fairly claimi this.... our record<br />
in improving social welfare is better than that-of any other Government over a<br />
comparable time. On that record I believe it fair to ask you to conclude that<br />
improvement in social welfare is important to us and improving it is a course we<br />
will pursue in the future, as and when we can responsibly do so.<br />
Besides the diff erences in policy there is another difference between us<br />
and the Opposition. I have tried, in the course of the campaign, to state clearly<br />
and unequivocally our policies on defence and internal economic management.<br />
I believe Australians are entitled to unambiguous statements of policy<br />
from both the Government and the Opposition. That is surely essential to the<br />
proper working of a democratic system. But Mr. Whitlam will not adopt this<br />
course. He has evaded, and refused to answer direct questions on matters of great<br />
moment to Australia's future.<br />
He has refused to answer questions as to whether he favours a 35 hour<br />
week and on whether he will conduct a political campaign, in conjunction with<br />
Mr. Hawke to bring it about. The honest answer he could give to that would be to<br />
admit that he was bound to conduct such a campaign and that he would do so.<br />
But he evaded giving that answer.<br />
He has refused to admit that he would withdraw from the Five Power<br />
Agreement and Agreement entered into for the defence and sta,-bility of our near<br />
north. When questioned recently he evaded the issue and talked instead about the<br />
value of having Indonesia as our defence umbrella. And a bulwark against<br />
Communist China.<br />
Again an honest answer he could have giver, would be that he would<br />
withdraw from this Agreement, because Labor's policy would force him tq. But<br />
he avoided giving the direct answer.<br />
He began this campaign with a number of false statements. I publicly<br />
branded them as false. He has not tried to sustain them. Since the opening he has<br />
made additional false statements. For instance one was that we had provided no<br />
money in the Budget for railways in South Australia.<br />
He began to post late in the campaign as a champion of higher<br />
pensions. And we were at once told by Mr. Griffiths, a Labor Party Member -that<br />
when he, Mr. Griffiths, sought a programme of higher pensions in caucus, Mr. Whitla<br />
rebuked him and said Mr. Griffiths was trying to featherbed the pensioners.<br />
All these matters, taken together, must surely raise some doubts as<br />
to our opponent's credibility and as to his readiness to deal openly with the<br />
Australian people. // 3 </p>
<p>31.<br />
1 believe this, too, should be carefully weighed by electors.<br />
I was asked, at one stage in the Campaign, to tell Australians what I am<br />
for. And I am glad to do so. I am for an Australia which keeps its alliances, and which<br />
helps to maintain stability in its region, an Australia which is not left friendless and<br />
isolated. I am for an Australia which will provide adequate defence for itself. I<br />
am for an Australia which will develop its resources and retain the greatest -possible<br />
Australian owinership of those resources while it does so.<br />
I am for an Australia whose citizens will seek more production, reder<br />
than more leisure, so that prices can be kept down, real wages can rise and the<br />
public facilities required by Australia, including adequate social welfare can be<br />
provided. I am for an Au~ stralia which will continue the war on poverty, and seek<br />
to relieve the neglect and loneliness which some old people who may not be poor,<br />
may row feel. I am for an Australia where ordinary citizens can exercise their<br />
civil rights to use the streets and other public facilities without having those rights<br />
denied them by a minority. I am for an Australia where the performing arts are<br />
encouraged to develop.<br />
And in this and other fields my government has acted to achieve the goals<br />
for which we stand. But I am against a political Party which would destroy our<br />
alliances and our own defence. I am against a Party which seeks leisure rather<br />
than production. I am against a Party whose Leader must follow policies<br />
dictated by an outside body which has never faced the electors.<br />
I am against a Party which is so deeply influenced by communist elements<br />
as is our opponent. I am against a Party which mocks at the maintenance of law and<br />
order, whose Leader advises young servicemen to refuse to obey a legitimate military<br />
order. I am against a Party whose every utterance ignores the danger of inflation,<br />
and urges courses which must create inflation. I distrust a Party as openly and<br />
deeply divided as is the Labor Party today.<br />
We have policies before you we believe in We think that no nation1-which<br />
puts ease before effort can be great. We think no people which talks only of its rights<br />
and not of the duties and the responsibilities that go with rights will ever be secure,<br />
and we do not think Australians are this kind of people. And so at this crucial<br />
election we asIk you to, give us Government Senators and let us get on with the job. </p>
