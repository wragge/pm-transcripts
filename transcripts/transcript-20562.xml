    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well thank you very much Trevor, Paul my parliamentary colleague, the Mayor, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is always a buzz to come on to a site and actually talk to people who are involved in building something, involved in bringing a project to fruition, and this is a fantastic example of that. And the bit of time I have had here this afternoon has been an opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the company. I want to congratulate the workforce, and particularly the workforce, because in the end these things only are achieved if people cooperate and you have highly skilled workers, and that is precisely what you've got here, at a time in Australia's economic history where we are really outperforming most other countries. It's an opportunity for me to say that the people who have made the greatest contribution to Australia's economic performance over the last 10 or 15 years have been the men and women of the Australian workforce because without their skill and adaptability and commitment, and sense of cooperation and purpose, we wouldn't have achieved it. So congratulations to all of you.</p>
<p> The Federal Government has made a contribution to this through a loan and it is always nice to sort of visit the investments to see how they are going, and this particular investment is going extremely well.</p>
<p>It's a great company, Comalco, and as a mark of the cause we all have in common before anything else, I'd be delighted to hand an Australian flag to Trevor. I know you have put up a flagpole. I've seen this great flag fly in a few places recently, most particularly in Qatar when I visited the Australian Forces after their operation in Iraq where they did this country absolutely proud. And your safety record, I am delighted to say, is exactly the same as theirs, absolutely 100 per cent, and that speaks great volumes for the workforce and for the management of this company.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
