I will  travel to Europe from 30 June to 13 July, on a visit aimed at promoting longstanding economic and cultural links with members of the European Union.<br />
The EU is Australia';s largest trading partner and our largest source of investment.<br />
During the visit to Germany, Greece, Belgium, Italy and the Holy See, I will meet European leaders including Chancellor Schroeder, Prime Minister Simitis, Prime Minister Berlusconi, European Union President Prodi and Prime Minister Verhofstadt. I will also call on His Holiness the Pope.<br />
In Berlin, Crete and Ieper I will visit memorials commemorating Australian service personnel who died in the pursuit of freedom in Europe.<br />
Two million Australians claim their heritage from the European countries which I am visiting.<br />
In addition, 2002 is an important year for Europe.  The challenges of EU enlargement, of monetary union, of a rapidly changing security environment and of border protection are driving a review of the continent';s political, economic and security structures.  My visit is a chance to reaffirm our shared values and community ties at a time when we are close partners in the war against terrorism.<br />
Immediately following the 21-22 June Seville EU Leaders'; Summit, it will also be a chance to emphasise our strong bilateral links with key European partners, to promote trade, and to stress the importance of economic and agricultural reform to both Australia';s and Europe';s future prosperity.</p>
