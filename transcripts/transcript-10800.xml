    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>New unemployment figures. 7.9% for April, the best since 1990.</p>
<p>   What did you do? Dance on the desk, kiss David Kemp? You must be</p>
<p>   ecstatic.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I was very happy, but more importantly a lot of the people</p>
<p>   who have got jobs - 58,000 of them in the last month - they'd</p>
<p>   be even more happy. This is a real break-through figure. It is the</p>
<p>   best since before the "recession we had to have" and ...</p>
<p>   well, it is. Mr Beazley was Employment Minister then and he took</p>
<p>   unemployment to 11.2% and this is 7.9%. It really is very good.</p>
<p>   The participation rate went up - that's the number of people</p>
<p>   who are looking for jobs. Sometimes you get a fall in unemployment</p>
<p>   because people give up the chase, but on this occasion the participation</p>
<p>   rate went up a little and there's been a 42,000 rise in full-time</p>
<p>   jobs - 16,000 in part-time jobs.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Is this a blip though? I mean, when the figures are bad you say</p>
<p>   "oh, we don't take any notice of one month's figures".</p>
<p>   I mean, why should we take any notice of this month's figures?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn't argue that you only ever fixate on one month,</p>
<p>   of course, but there's a lot of psychology in this, and there</p>
<p>   is something psychologically positive about breaking below the 8%</p>
<p>   figure for the first time in almost eight years.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>That was the budget estimate wasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it was the budget estimate, and on current indications we are</p>
<p>   going to do better than that estimate, but look, obviously you go</p>
<p>   from month to month, and I don't deny that. But whenever the</p>
<p>   figures go the wrong way, quite properly people express concern,</p>
<p>   and when they go the right way it is legitimate to say that we have</p>
<p>   created something like 173,000 new jobs since the middle of last</p>
<p>   year and we are now at 7.9% and the former government averaged 8.7%.</p>
<p>   And when you add that to the low inflation, the low interest rates,</p>
<p>   the success we've had in reducing the budget deficit, turning</p>
<p>   around that deficit of $10.5 billion we inherited two years ago,</p>
<p>   it all adds up to a very positive economic picture.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>The Governor of the Reserve Bank was a bit gloomy today, in that</p>
<p>   speech he gave today he predicts growth will drop from 4% to 3%,</p>
<p>   the Asian economic crisis is going to be a bit rough, and he says</p>
<p>   that continuing falls in the jobless rate are unlikely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess it's which bit of his speech you look at. The</p>
<p>   other bit of his interview before the - I think it was the Senate</p>
<p>   committee - indicated that he thought interest rates would stay</p>
<p>   where they were at the present time, which is very good news. Some</p>
<p>   people have been suggesting they ought to go up, others, they ought</p>
<p>   to go down. I don't want to say any more than what he said</p>
<p>   about that, but if you add all of those things up it's a very</p>
<p>   very strong picture, and then you inject into that something I suppose</p>
<p>   a lot of people didn't expect and that is the de-mutualisation</p>
<p>   of the AMP.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Do you think that will have a ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do. I think it will have quite a significant effect on consumer</p>
<p>   spending, because you are unlocking about $16 billion of accumulated</p>
<p>   wealth, and some of the people who get the shares will sell them,</p>
<p>   and they will spend the proceeds of the sale of those shares on</p>
<p>   trips, on washing machines, on cars and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You'll have to get in that Goods and Services Tax very quickly</p>
<p>   to catch it, haven't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're certainly going to produce a lower personal income</p>
<p>   tax before the next election, and part of our package is.... Look,</p>
<p>   we will go to the next election with a comprehensive tax reform</p>
<p>   package, like we said.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Are we going to know anything more about your tax reform plans</p>
<p>   on Tuesday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. Tuesday is not about announcing our tax package. Tuesday is</p>
<p>   about the Budget. It will of course contain, like all budgets, a</p>
<p>   number of individual announcements as well as an overall framework</p>
<p>   of the year ahead and a stocktake of the economy and a report card</p>
<p>   on the management and it will a very very good, it will be an A+</p>
<p>   report card. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It really will be because we...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>... going to tell me it will be a responsible budget next, won't</p>
<p>   you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will be an A+ budget.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if you, I mean, what are the indicators? Inflation, interest</p>
<p>   rates, employment, growth, investment. Now on all of those fronts</p>
<p>   we have done extremely well and on all of those fronts we've</p>
<p>   either equalled or exceeded what we committed ourselves to two years</p>
<p>   ago.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>We had a $1.3 billion trade deficit just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>   Exports up by 5% - that's not good.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, look, the current account is under a little more pressure and</p>
<p>   that makes it all the more necessary to have a strong budget deficit</p>
<p>   policy, if I can put it that way, or a strong fiscal policy. You</p>
<p>   need to balance the one against the other.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>What size is the budget surplus?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I'm not going to get into that at the moment. I'll</p>
<p>   leave that to Peter.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Oh, go on, go on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, now don't twist my arm, or tempt me, or provoke me.</p>
<p>   But I'll leave that to the Treasurer.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But you are going to deliver tax cuts at the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are going to deliver more than tax cuts. We are going to deliver</p>
<p>   an overall fairer taxation system. We are going to go to the next</p>
<p>   election with a tax reform programme.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Including a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we obviously have under consideration a broad based indirect</p>
<p>   tax in replacement of existing indirect taxes. And I want to say</p>
<p>   two very definite things to people. There is no way that we would</p>
<p>   bring in a general indirect tax on top of the existing indirect</p>
<p>   tax system. If we were to bring in a broad based indirect tax, it</p>
<p>   would be in replacement of existing indirect taxes like the wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And will you tax the candles as well as the birthday cake?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Specifics!</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right, let's move on. The waterfront. After all the upheaval,</p>
<p>   disruption, legal battles, the possibility of a conspiracy, even</p>
<p>   involving your Government, the Maritime Union is back on the wharves.</p>
<p>   Was it all worth it? What have you changed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think they are back. The last word I heard was that they</p>
<p>   had agreed to go back with the existing security guards.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>There's now some hitch I.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let's assume they go back and can I say I've never</p>
<p>   wanted union members as such not to be on the wharves. This idea</p>
<p>   that in some way this campaign is all about getting rid of the MUA</p>
<p>   or getting rid of unions is wrong. The only two things I've</p>
<p>   wanted and I still want, are a more productive waterfront and voluntary</p>
<p>   unionism on the waterfront. They are the two things we want. They</p>
<p>   are the two things...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>... but have you got them? After all this ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You haven't seen the end of this issue by a long shot yet.</p>
<p>   It is much too early for people to be saying, "well, this side</p>
<p>   won or that side lost". I will only ever regard a victory in</p>
<p>   terms of the national interest as important, and if we can get out</p>
<p>   of this a reformed, more productive waterfront, and freedom of association,</p>
<p>   and I believe there is a much better prospect of getting that now</p>
<p>   than what there was five or six weeks ago, then an enormous amount</p>
<p>   for the Australian national interest will have been achieved. An</p>
<p>   enormous amount.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. A lot of reasonable people might find it hard to believe</p>
<p>   that your Government or your senior public servants didn't</p>
<p>   have this planned months in advance with Corrigan, and with full</p>
<p>   knowledge of the Dubai training exercise and so on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've never made any secret of the fact that we wanted</p>
<p>   waterfront reform. And ...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Mike, I'll answer that this way by saying that our conduct</p>
<p>   in this whole thing has been guided by one very very simple proposition</p>
<p>   and that is that committed as we are to waterfront reform, we will</p>
<p>   obviously support and help and talk to people who have that same</p>
<p>   goal, and we'll support attempts by companies to achieve waterfront</p>
<p>   reform provided they act in accordance with the law. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Well, they may not have acted in accordance with the law.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is being alleged and they are denying that.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Ten judges, two courts, I mean, maybe...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no. I am sorry, that is not right. What those judges have</p>
<p>   done....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Is it an arguable case?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....is to uphold the interlocutory, or one of them made the interlocutory</p>
<p>   order and the other nine have upheld it, although in the case of</p>
<p>   the five judges of the High Court, they made a very significant</p>
<p>   variation. The change that the High Court made to the Federal Court</p>
<p>   decision was quite significant. What the Federal Court had done</p>
<p>   was basically put their views about the Workplace Relations Act</p>
<p>   ahead of their views about the Corporations Act. What the</p>
<p>   High Court did was to say, you can't ignore commercial reality</p>
<p>   and that meant quite a lot. But could I just go back to the Government's</p>
<p>   position because that was a question you asked me. We have always</p>
<p>   supported waterfront reform.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And it follows from that that if a company says to the Government,</p>
<p>   we want to achieve waterfront reform, of course the Government will</p>
<p>   talk to that company.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>But if a company says to the Government, we're thinking of</p>
<p>   hiring the SAS and teaching them to load trucks at Dubai, it's</p>
<p>   a very different matter, isn't it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Peter Reith has answered that as the relevant and responsible Minister</p>
<p>   and I have no reason to disbelieve anything Peter Reith has said</p>
<p>   on the subject. Could I also say in relation to Dubai, leaving aside</p>
<p>   who was involved in any of this, that and the other, what was wrong</p>
<p>   with it? Is it a criminal offence in this country now for people</p>
<p>   to be trained overseas and is it a criminal offence in this country....?</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Not at all. But...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I do think...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But if you go down the...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no but I do think people have been verballed into believing</p>
<p>   in some way that because there was some overseas training involved</p>
<p>   that in some way that was a criminal offence. There is nothing wrong</p>
<p>   with blokes leaving the army and pursuing a career elsewhere, and</p>
<p>   as for denigrating people because they belonged to the SAS, I happen</p>
<p>   to have a lot of respect for the SAS and I think most Australians</p>
<p>   do. I think it's a badge of honour to have belonged to the</p>
<p>   SAS, not a badge of dishonour.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Some of the SAS seems to be saying at the moment they feel they</p>
<p>   have been done over, and they're rushing off to television</p>
<p>   programmes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I simply say again, if people have got allegations to make, let</p>
<p>   them make them. If people have got documents to drop, let them drop</p>
<p>   them. If they have got claims to make, let's have it. Let's</p>
<p>   have the documents.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Let it all hang out.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>If Peter Reith didn't know, and he's denied it many times</p>
<p>   and we must therefore believe that, what about your former Transport</p>
<p>   Minister, John Sharp. He might have known a bit about this. Have</p>
<p>   you asked him?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>You haven't?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have absolutely no reason to disbelieve anything that these people</p>
<p>   have said about this.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You haven't rung John Sharp?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't. </p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>What about Dubai? Were you aware of this? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>  Did you know Corrigan was going to scoop out his labour hire companies</p>
<p>   and questions like that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mike, look, there have been a lot of questions asked and answered</p>
<p>   already about Dubai. We have stated a position. If people have got</p>
<p>   evidence disproving that, let them produce the evidence and until</p>
<p>   then, I am getting rather bored answering questions about it.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. Your audience maybe getting bored listening to it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think they are getting a bit bored.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>I want one more question on the waterfront, if I can.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>One more moment of boredom.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>It's this. With the great luxury of hindsight, and it is that,</p>
<p>   the turmoil of this, the opinion polls everywhere, would you have</p>
<p>   done it differently?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't regret anything the Government has done. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Nothing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I think what the Government has done has been to set out quite</p>
<p>   honourably to achieve a goal in the national interest and I never</p>
<p>   thought for a moment it would be easy. The idea that you would bring</p>
<p>   about a fundamental change in the work practices on the Australian</p>
<p>   waterfront, involving as that does, changing the attitude of what</p>
<p>   has been the most militant, self-centred union in Australia's</p>
<p>   history, without any question, anybody who thought that that could</p>
<p>   be achieved without some resistance and some difficulty knows nothing</p>
<p>   about the industrial relations history of this country, and at the</p>
<p>   end of the day, I believe that people will see what the Government</p>
<p>   has done, what the National Farmers' Federation has done, what</p>
<p>   the company has done as having been in the national interest. </p>
<p>Now you can criticise, as people have, and they have a right to</p>
<p>   particular aspects, but let's go back to the central element.</p>
<p>   We want waterfront reform. We want voluntary unionism. I have never</p>
<p>   wanted to destroy the MUA. I have never wanted to push people out</p>
<p>   of jobs just because they belong to unions. I mean, it is a cardinal</p>
<p>   principle of our industrial relations law that people have a right</p>
<p>   to join or not to join a union, and they should not suffer any discrimination</p>
<p>   according to their choice.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. Let's move on. Pure politics, read in tooth and</p>
<p>   claw. Would you approve if the Liberals in Queensland do give preferences</p>
<p>   to Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party ahead of the ALP?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, their position as I understand it, and I haven't spoken</p>
<p>   to the Queensland organisation, bear in mind this is a state election.</p>
<p>   I will obviously have discussions with the organisation regarding</p>
<p>   the preferences in a federal election but I haven't involved</p>
<p>   myself in this. My understanding at the moment is that they are</p>
<p>   going to pick and choose according to the..</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>From seat to seat.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>From seat to seat. It will depend a little bit on the individual</p>
<p>   character of the candidate, I imagine. I mean, look...</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>One of them is Chinese, for a start. One of your Liberal...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, I mean the character of the individual Labor and One Nation</p>
<p>   candidates. </p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You've got to pay some regard to the personal views of Labor</p>
<p>   candidates and just as in the Labor Party presumably pays personal</p>
<p>   regard to the views of individual Liberal candidates. I mean, for</p>
<p>   example in the last Federal election, in my seat I think and in</p>
<p>   many other seats the Labor Party put the Liberal Party after Australians</p>
<p>   Against Further Immigration. They did that in the Lindsay by election</p>
<p>   too, which was a far more high profile thing and they did a preference</p>
<p>   deal with the Australians Against Further Immigration.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>You're fence-sitting here though, aren't you? For example,</p>
<p>   Peter Collins and Jeff Kennett say they wouldn't give One Nation</p>
<p>   preferences in their states.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That, in a Queensland election?</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>No, in their own state elections. Kennett and Collins wouldn't</p>
<p>   have a bar of One Nation. ALP would get preferences first.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it's a little different when you're dealing</p>
<p>   with a state election where there aren't likely to be any One</p>
<p>   Nation candidates.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>You are fence-sitting a bit, aren't you? Are we just saying...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, look, you can say that. Look, my position on this is that elections</p>
<p>   are a contest between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and</p>
<p>   it's a question of which of those two choices are made. I also</p>
<p>   believe that the important thing for the Liberal Party to do is</p>
<p>   to address a message and to talk directly to people who are thinking</p>
<p>   of voting for One Nation. Most of the people who are attracted in</p>
<p>   a transitory way to the One Nation Party are no more racist than</p>
<p>   you and I are. Some are.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>I would have thought a lot.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Some are, no, I repeat, some are but a lot of them are people who</p>
<p>   are just feeling a bit aggrieved with life and they have been kicked</p>
<p>   around and they think that she's got some kind of magical answer</p>
<p>   which she hasn't.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>She doesn't like you. Have you seen that..?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well I know that. I am aware of that.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>She put out a press release today which I find amusing and you</p>
<p>   may, as well. "Hanson: Howard's Promise To Deliver</p>
<p>   More Bad News. Record Foreign debt." </p>
<p>Sorry, where are we?</p>
<p> "Unemployment at 19 per cent". Is it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Really? I thought it was 7.9.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Well, there you go. "Record foreign debt. Dubious trade</p>
<p>   figures. Soaring crime, an ever-decreasing standard of living and</p>
<p>   the importation of infectious diseases are just a few of John Howard's</p>
<p>   favourite things".</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as for the last criticism, that sounds like a Labor Party</p>
<p>   release.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>That's from Pauline.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I know. No, the point I am simply making to you, that's</p>
<p>   the sort of criticism that's made of me by the Labor Party.</p>
<p>   Now I think she is a very insubstantial, narrow-minded, limited</p>
<p>   person who...</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Bigoted.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>On some issues she is bigoted, yes, but so is the Labor Party on</p>
<p>   some issues. I mean, Kim Beazley, for example, supports compulsory</p>
<p>   unionism on the Australian waterfront. Kim Beazley encouraged the</p>
<p>   unionists on the Australian waterfront pickets to defy the orders</p>
<p>   of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>You're getting back to it now, aren't you?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's because I think it's relevant to the point you're</p>
<p>   making. Look, I think she is bigoted and narrow-minded and I don't</p>
<p>   think her policies offer anything and I would say to the people</p>
<p>   who are attracted to her, the legitimate concerns you have can best</p>
<p>   be answered by a Coalition Government without the disadvantage and</p>
<p>   the baggage that accompanies One Nation, particularly her remarks</p>
<p>   about Aborigines, which were wrong and prejudicial and also her</p>
<p>   remarks about Asian immigration which were also wrong and prejudicial</p>
<p>   and I made those remarks at the time.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. We're about out of time however normally at this</p>
<p>   time we would play a bit of classic rock'n'roll. All right.</p>
<p>   Can you handle this?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Only just!</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>You can choose it today. We don't want to disappoint the audience.</p>
<p>   Have you got a favourite?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, people say, what's your favourite? Look, like anybody</p>
<p>   else there are 20 or 30 pieces over the years I have liked. I rather</p>
<p>   like Dire Straits', "Walk of Life"</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Dire Straits?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>Do you know the words? "Here comes Johnny with the power</p>
<p>   and the glory".</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't know that! I didn't know it.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You'll learn, you'll learn.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I didn't know it.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And it's from an album called "Money For Nothing".</p>
<p>   Did you realise that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I wasn't aware of the "Money For Nothing",</p>
<p>   no.</p>
<p> CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. We'll play it. Thanks very much for coming in. Good</p>
<p>   to talk to you. Good to seming in. Good</p>
<p>   to talk to you. Good to see you.</p>
