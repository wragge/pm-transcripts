    <content><![CDATA[<p> India's action in conducting three underground nuclear</p>
<p> tests is an ill-judged step which could have most damaging consequences</p>
<p> for security in South Asia and globally.</p>
<p>Australia has a direct security interest in preventing the proliferation</p>
<p> of nuclear weapons. The Indian tests are in flagrant defiance of the</p>
<p> international community's strong support for nuclear non-proliferation</p>
<p> and opposition to nuclear testing. To date, 186 countries are party</p>
<p> to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and 149 countries have signed</p>
<p> the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p>India's neighbours will naturally be concerned about the tests</p>
<p> but a nuclear arms race is not the way to address the issue of maintaining</p>
<p> stability in South Asia. The Government urges them not to respond</p>
<p> in ways which would further destabilise security in the region.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister has called in the Indian High Commissioner today</p>
<p> to convey our condemnation of the tests in the strongest possible</p>
<p> terms. The same message will be registered by our High Commission</p>
<p> in New Delhi.</p>
<p>The government is recalling our High Commissioner from New Delhi for</p>
<p> consultations. Further action will be decided in light of those consultations</p>
<p> and discussions with other countries which share our concern.</p>
<p> 12 May 1998</p>
