<p>  I extend my sympathy to the families and friends of those who have died or been injured as a result of Cyclone George in Western Australia.  This cyclone has caused great damage to communities in the far north of the State and the Federal Government is ready to provide reasonable additional help.  </p>
<p>I have just spoken to the West Australian Premier, Mr Carpenter, and offered additional assistance of that normally available under National Disaster Relief Arrangements.</p>
<p>Given the devastation already caused and the potential for further devastation, the Federal Government will provide extra help for people who are seriously injured or whose main place of residence has been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.</p>
<p>Under these special arrangements the Government will provide $1,000 per adult and $400 per child to help with the immediate impact of the cyclone.  This assistance will come on top of the usual financial help provided by the Commonwealth under natural disaster arrangements.  </p>
<p>Already the Australian Defence Force has offered help if it is required and the Government has also activated a natural disaster response plan which places many government agencies and departments on standby to help if requested by the Government of Western Australia.</p>
