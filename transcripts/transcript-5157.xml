FOR MEDIA FILL--<br />
PRIME MINISTER 3 O Q 6' 1979<br />
OPENING OF THE NATIONAL YOUTH CONFERENCE, CANBERRA<br />
I-have much pleasure in addressing this the first National<br />
Youth ConCfrence.. It has been quite a long while in the<br />
planning, ; tnd I think it really grows out of discussions<br />
that have tLken place not just over the last year but over<br />
a longer [) coriod than that. A number of people have put it<br />
to me that qovernment's links with young people, with the<br />
problems Lhat young people face in a modern community, should<br />
be better aind more direct than they have been in the past.<br />
The Office of Youth Affairs was established, and then the<br />
Department. of Employment md Industrial Relations was divided,<br />
on the one hand so that Tony Street could give his total<br />
attention 1: o the very difficult and and intractable problems<br />
of industt: Lal relations, but also so that there could be a<br />
Minister who could devote his whole energies to the problems<br />
of employment and to the problems of youth affairs,<br />
expanding the Office of Youth Affairs and enabling it<br />
hopefully to carry out a more effective function.<br />
There has been a good deal of interest shown in this<br />
conference, not just from youth organisations around the<br />
country, but on one particular occasion there were over<br />
20,000 calls from young people around Australia showing an<br />
interest in the conference and what it was all about. We<br />
welcome thdt interest very much indeed. The very fact that<br />
so much interest has been shown I think indicates that young<br />
people in the community are prepared to accept responsibility<br />
and certaciily want to help in the search for solutions to<br />
some of thie difficulties that we have at the moment. Amongst<br />
all of you here there is a wide cross section some still<br />
at school, some in training, some at work, and some as I am<br />
told unemployed at the moment.<br />
I think this gives all of us a unique opportunity to give the<br />
Government. your analysis, your solutions, your ideas, about<br />
the kind of approach that ought to be adopted. I hope that<br />
there will be a very useful interchange and exchange of views<br />
during theo course of the conference, because that is much of<br />
what it ii all about.<br />
For the next few moments I would like to put out a few ideas,<br />
not in any dogmatic way, but mayb. e offering a challenge,<br />
maybe seeking a responsive reaction, to see whether some of<br />
the feelings I have are reflected in your own minds.<br />
Throughout the conference we would certainly want your input<br />
to what happens. / 2 </p>
<p>A lot of people have been paying attention to the education<br />
system in recent times. The role of the education system is<br />
very much under scrutiny, under examination. People are asking<br />
how we can widen career opportunities, widen the nature of<br />
courses and make them more appropriate to the needs of students<br />
in the modern world. I think overall Australia has some<br />
reason to be proud of its educational system. In many ways<br />
it is central to our achievements. There has been a great<br />
growth of universities and colleges,, and compared with 10 or<br />
years ago more people are staying at secondary school for higher<br />
levels of schooling. Because there has been some success that<br />
doesn't also mean that there is not a considerable degree of<br />
concern as to whether the education system is clearly meeting<br />
the needs of all young Australians. It is not just a question<br />
of being able to meet the needs of those who are academically<br />
orientated those who might wish and have the intellectual<br />
c apacity to go to university and to college.. There are other<br />
people in the community who have different inclinations and<br />
different talents, whose needs are just as great, whose talents<br />
in some ways might be just as great, but which lie in a different<br />
direction. I believe there is a very real question as to<br />
whether the education system meets that group of the Australian<br />
community as well as it should.<br />
The academic training is obviously suitable for many, but it is<br />
not suitable for all. I think in a number of<br />
secondary schools there is too much emphasis on academically<br />
orientated courses, too much attention to the students who<br />
can fit those courses. Maybe that is putting it the wrong<br />
way. around, maybe it is not too much attention given to those<br />
students, but too little attention given to students who don't<br />
fit those courses, who don't fit into the academic stream'<br />
who need a different kind of training, a different kind of<br />
opportunity, more vocationally orientated, more technically<br />
orientated. It is not a question of one person being better<br />
than another. It is not a question of one educational stream<br />
being better than another. I think it is a question of what<br />
suits the talents of young Australians and what is going to<br />
give people an opportunity to make their own way as they leave<br />
school, as they finish formal education.<br />
One of the most unfortunate aspects of a situation i n which<br />
schools fail a ' Certain group of people within the Australian<br />
ccmunity is that they get a feellng of inadequacy there, not because<br />
they have failed the system, but because the system, the<br />
education, the school, has failed them. If they leave school<br />
and find it difficult to get a job within a reasonable time,<br />
that feeling of inadequacy, that feeling of frustration is<br />
clearly compounded, it grows and can lead to real questions<br />
as to what it is all about. Is it a reasonable world, or<br />
isn't it? I think in these areas, in these issues, there are<br />
a number of things that need tackling. Some of the States<br />
have started to. There are work experience-schemes undertaken<br />
by some schools, but I don't think they go far enough. I don't<br />
think they reach out to enough students, don't provide enough<br />
* opportunity, and I doubt very muioh whether the<br />
orientation of many of Australia's secondary schools is<br />
appropriate * as we approach 1980. I-think it-needs<br />
modification and greater emphasis given in. the technical<br />
area. </p>
<p>I think nearly everyone here would have been at school more<br />
recently than Ian Viner and myself, so I have thrown out some<br />
ideas and views, and would certainly welcome your reactions.<br />
Most of those who leave school manage the transition to work<br />
or to further study without much difficulty. But 10% of each<br />
age group as they leave school find it difficult in getting<br />
a job in the course of the following year. I think it is<br />
that group 10% or a bit above that much of our<br />
attention needs t~ o be directed to. They are the ones in<br />
greatest difficulty, ones that the present system is not<br />
assisting in the way it ought.<br />
I think that we a~ lso ought to have in mind that those who<br />
hold off getting a job in the hope of getting one that they<br />
really want ought to consider the benefits of experience<br />
that they would gain in some kind of work, rather than<br />
remain an inexperienced unemployed. That is a question<br />
that people who have difficulty in getting the job they<br />
want I hope would ask themselves.<br />
The Government has for some time been concerned about the<br />
problems of transition from school to work. There has been<br />
concern about thE! direction of our education system.<br />
We have had the Williams Inquiry, the committee which has<br />
reported into education and training. It has reported on<br />
the difficulties of school leavers. It has emphasised<br />
that there is a greater need for basic skill; it has<br />
emphasised the importance of attitudes of students, of<br />
schools and of parents; it has emphasised the importance<br />
of adequate transition from school to work and arrangements<br />
that make that possible; and in particular it has discussed<br />
the forms of training that are available and suggested<br />
modification and change. It has suggested that there should<br />
be further emphasis on technical training and on further<br />
education. In recent times we have sought, when we have<br />
had additional funds and additional resources, to make sure<br />
that they go into technical and further education, believing<br />
that that more directly fits the needs of the present time.<br />
We have a wide range of programs that are designed to help<br />
the unemployed and young unemployed without skills in<br />
particular. The National Employment and Training Scheme,<br />
the apprenticeshi~ p scheme CRAFT, the Education Program for<br />
Unemployed Youth, which I think from some of the classes<br />
that I have seen might be giving some people an. opportunity<br />
in life for the first time. In the classes that I have visited I<br />
think~ maybe for the first time in their lives.) people felt<br />
that somebody was concerned, somebody cared about what<br />
happened. That again is only touching a relatively small<br />
proportion of young people.<br />
The programs are designed to give special training, work<br />
experience, to create a greater degree of self-confidence,<br />
and by the end of this financial . year something over half<br />
* a million Australians, many of them young. Australians, will<br />
have been assisted by these various training. programs.,<br />
* That is a very substantial number. We are not complacent<br />
about it, we are not satisfied with the programs as they<br />
are. Ian Viner monitors them, they will be-improved as we<br />
can, and this again is an area where we would wdlcome your<br />
views about the rnature of the various training programs. </p>
<p>For a moment I would like to put some of the problems that<br />
, Australia faces into the wider international background.<br />
Australia is not an island unto itself. We live in a world,<br />
and we need to take account of the ' world around us. I say<br />
it not by any means as an excuse for our own problems.<br />
What problems we have we have to tackle, but at the same<br />
time we need to understand the kind of world Australia must<br />
live in, that Australia must trade in, and sometimes that<br />
world assists us, sometimes it makes it more difficult.<br />
When it makes it more difficult we just have to be more<br />
determined to do things better within this country, not to<br />
say everything is against us and give up and say it is too<br />
hard. That is a defeatist attitude, which the Government<br />
certainly doesn't and never would accept. I believe that<br />
most Australians also wouldn't accept it.<br />
There are now complex economic problems, not only in<br />
Australia but in many countries. Inflation is too high<br />
for many reasons. Governments have had the view that they<br />
can spend and just go on spending, me et all needs by if<br />
necessary printing funds. That has led, as much as anything<br />
else, to inflation being embedded very deeply within many<br />
Western societies.<br />
In one sense Australia is fortunate, because here inflation<br />
is less than in Northern America, it is less than in many<br />
countries in Europe, and Very significantly less. But because<br />
world inflation is high, the growth of world trade is very<br />
low. New investment and development in many countries is<br />
very low. in the 20 or 25 years to 1972 world trade grew<br />
by about 8% a year. In the years of high inflation since<br />
1972 world trade has grown by only about 4% a year.<br />
The difference between those figures, the difference<br />
from the growth it represents in different countries, is<br />
really represented by the much higher number of unemployed in<br />
Australia, in Britain, in the United States, in Europe<br />
and many countries around the world.<br />
How therefore do we return to a situation of growth?<br />
For so long people in my generation and I think Ian's<br />
probably took growth for granted. In the late ' 40s to<br />
and ' 60s, really up to the end of the 1960s it seemed<br />
that growth, relatively low inflation, very high levels of<br />
employment, had come to stay, they came to be accepted,<br />
and people believe d that they could go on regardless and<br />
that state just wouldn't change. It came to be accepted<br />
as a permanent fact of life. As a result of that people<br />
in Australia and again in many other countries began to<br />
pursue a whole range of policies that weren't conducive to<br />
growth, to development, to investment and therefore to<br />
the creation of the kind of jobs and the numbers of jobs that<br />
we in Australia and people in other countries needed.<br />
A number of policies were pursued by countries which were<br />
in a sense anti-growth, anti-development, and anti-jobs.<br />
Now, at the end of the 1970' s, we seek to grapple with<br />
those difficulties, with those problems, and overcome<br />
the difficulties of the. past. A number of the old theories<br />
that people had followed for a'long while just don't work<br />
* in a system where there is high inflation coupled with<br />
relatively high unemployment.<br />
I </p>
<p>It is not possible to spend your way out of difficulty when<br />
inflation is high, because the extra spending just compounds<br />
inflation. In a sense it is not all that unlike a family<br />
that has spent too much over a period of two or three years<br />
and might suddenly find itself very much in debt, with the<br />
house being mortgaged and a second mortgage. The banker<br />
comes along and says if you continue these habits you are<br />
going to lose your home and are going to lose all your assets.<br />
The family wakes up and decides they can't allow this to<br />
happen, they have got to get their spending back into a<br />
reasonable pattern and live within their income.<br />
obviously the analogy is simplified, but there are some<br />
similarities and important ones between the resources<br />
Available to a family and the resources available to a<br />
nation. Ultimately both have to live within their incomes<br />
within what they can produce.<br />
Cnie of the cruellest things that can be done for the problems<br />
of unemployment is to suggest that there are quick, easy<br />
solutions. There aren't quick, there aren't easy<br />
solutions. The problems are going to take a while to work<br />
through, and the solutions have to be real ones. We dont<br />
believe, and my Government has never believed, that so-called<br />
job creation schemes themselves would work and provide any<br />
permanent solution. Certainly it is very easy to put more people<br />
on a Government payroll. There was a year once before in<br />
Australia when an extra 100,000 in one year went on Government<br />
payrolls, but 155,000 lost their jobs in the private sector<br />
of the Australian community. That meant in a sense that the<br />
additional employment was becoming a very great burden on<br />
Australian taxpayers, but even in spite of that not enough<br />
people could go on the Government payroll to reduce the<br />
numbers unemployed. The number unemployed in fact increased<br />
very substantially. It is not much consolation for governments<br />
to spend substantial sums on job creation schemes if that<br />
reduced investment, reduces development, and thereby leads<br />
to less employment overall. That is what it is all about.<br />
Since 1975 we have worked for permanent jobs funded from real<br />
growth, real investment, real development throughout the<br />
Australian community. Not for something transient or<br />
artificial, not for something that will only last for a year<br />
or two, but something that will build a basis of scope as we<br />
go forward into the 1980' s. Now more and more major countries<br />
are rejecting the discredited policies that many of them<br />
have followed, and more of then are at least coming to<br />
accept that the kind of policies pursued by this Government<br />
are in fact the only ones that will work in the longer term.<br />
That is needed if inflation is to come down, if trade is to<br />
grow, and there is to be more activity, not . just in Australia<br />
but in many other countries.<br />
Of course there are still problems. our policies are best<br />
designed to cope with those problems and in re-establishing<br />
the conditions in which'there will be invest ' nent and development<br />
and opportunities. Inflation for some time in Australia has<br />
been lower than that in North'America, much lower than in<br />
Britain, much lower than many countries of-Europe, and therefore </p>
<p>-6<br />
our industries have beconre conpetitive again. They sell better on<br />
the Australian market and overseas. If they are selling<br />
better they employ more and produce more. During this<br />
period there has been a good deal of technological change<br />
and much talk about it. Some people say it is best to put up the<br />
shutters against technological change because it tends to<br />
reduce the number of jobs. That again is a defeatist<br />
attitude and it is not an option I believe that is open to<br />
us because our industries depend on being competitive, they<br />
depend on being able -to do well or better than the same<br />
industries in other countries. We are not going to be able<br />
to do that with outmoded technology which can either produce<br />
a product that is not so good, or if they can produce one<br />
that is good they might produce it at considerably higher<br />
cost. So new technology is inevitable, we need to embrace<br />
it and use it to our advantage. I think that sometimes<br />
there needs to be much more discussion with working men<br />
and women about the introduction of new technology, the<br />
problems of transition as it is introduced into a factory<br />
or a particular workplace, but there is no option but to<br />
accept the challenges of new technology and see that it is<br />
used to Australia's advantage to create more jobs overall<br />
rather than less.,<br />
The future in the 1980' s I believe is one which Australia<br />
should face with a great and a growing confidence. The<br />
prospects for the 1980' s are good. There is more<br />
development, more investment taking place in this country<br />
now than for a very very long while. There are the<br />
possibilities of real reward, for personal efforts of<br />
individuals. That is not to say there aren't'problems,<br />
that is not to say there aren't difficulties, that is not<br />
to say there aren't some people and too many young peoplefinding<br />
it difficult to get the kind of work that is needed<br />
and finding it difficult to find their place within the<br />
Australian community. But the opportunities are still very<br />
great. We have an unparalled opportunity to play a role in our own<br />
part of the world, in South-east Asia and East Asia, and<br />
trade with those regions is going more rapidly than with any<br />
other. We are attracting great investment. There will be<br />
more resource processing using the great power reserves,<br />
the great reserves of coal, which makes us one of the more<br />
fortunate of the Western countries.<br />
There are other opportunities for Australia in the cultural<br />
and artistic, scientific and sporting fields. As a nation<br />
we need to build on all of these to create a better life,<br />
a more equal and a more tolerant community. In the international<br />
environment, as a middle-ranking power we can act as a force<br />
for moderation as we have in many areas, and I think that is<br />
a role that Australia ought to play with vigour.<br />
I think there is one se nse where I sometimes become very<br />
disappointed at the attitudes of Australians in relation<br />
to a number of things. It is * not by accident, it is not<br />
by chance that we sometimes call ourselves a nation of<br />
knockers. If somebody does something well there are always / 7 </p>
<p>.7<br />
the detractors that want to destroy. How often do we hear<br />
people saying " Australia can'It do it, that working people in<br />
other countries produce something better. That we are not<br />
really competitive because our costs are too high. I think<br />
it really is time that we put that kind of view behind us, and<br />
especially it is time that we put that view behind us because<br />
it just doesn't happen to be factually correct. Very often<br />
Australians are the greatest detractors of Australia. We need<br />
to understand that if we are not going to have some kind of<br />
pride in this nation, some kind of pride in where we want<br />
to take Australia in partnership, then nobody else will.<br />
We are Australia, you are Australia, more your future than<br />
mine because you are all a good deal younger than I am.<br />
We need to have pride in what we can achieve and in what we.<br />
have done.<br />
Let me just give one or two examples. Two years ago Jim Kill~ en<br />
came to us wanting to order a major defence ship for the<br />
Royal Australian Navy. It was going to cost $ 70 million or<br />
million. Defence hadn't gone to Australian firms to get<br />
Australian prices. The automatic assumption was we couldn't<br />
do it in this country, it would cost much too much, subsidy<br />
would be enormous. So they had gone around the world and got<br />
the best tender from France, the cheapest international tender.<br />
As a Government we said that was not good enough. We wanted to<br />
see how much more, we assumed it would cost more, how much<br />
more it would cost to build that ship in Australia. maybe<br />
we imuld be prepared to provide the subsidy that is necessary<br />
to do it. A few months ago we got the Australian tender from<br />
Vickers, and. it wasn't a dollar, it wasn't a cent more<br />
than the tender. It was some millions of dollars below<br />
the cheapest tender overseas. That is an example of Australians<br />
doing it. Australian management, Australian initiative,<br />
Australian working people being able to produce with the best.<br />
There are other examples where Australian manufacturing industry<br />
is producing goods in competition against production from Singapore,<br />
from Taiwan and from Hong Kong, and winning contracts around the<br />
Indian Ocean and South East Asia because Australians do it<br />
better, and they provide a better product, and they can sell<br />
against that kind of competition. In other areas, in the mundane<br />
area that affects so many of us, how many people say they have<br />
to buy an imported car because they are better, they are<br />
better produced, they are better finished. It just doesn't<br />
happen tb be true. A world class product is produced in<br />
this country by more than one company, and it is finished<br />
just as well as any imported product. It is time I think<br />
we began to have some pride in things Australian and in<br />
Australian achievements. Because if we don't do that, nobody<br />
else will, nobody else can. I don't mean that we should do it<br />
in a way that is chauvanistic or bombastic -wearing the<br />
Australian flag on both arms all the time -but this is a<br />
great nation, and it is up to us t~ o build it for the future.<br />
In particular, it is up to people like yourselves I believe<br />
to* build it for the future, because it depends on what. happens<br />
as each generation passes, the kind of nation we have, the kind<br />
of nation we create. 0../ 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
But whatever we do in material things, I would hope that with the<br />
great migration program that has taken place over the last<br />
years, above all else we achieve a nation with a growing<br />
sense of tolerance, a growing sense of understanding of the<br />
different needs and aspirations of different groups of people<br />
of different individuals within the Australian community so<br />
that this can be truly a land which is the best country in<br />
the world to bring up a family, the best country in the world<br />
for men and women, young and old,. to live out their lives.<br />
That isreally what it is all about. It is not about power<br />
or greatness or physical achievements, but the kind of<br />
country where people can lead their lives and the way in<br />
which they can do it, giving themselves a sense of<br />
satisfaction and a sense of achievement.<br />
Often you get people who want to get to a certain position,<br />
and they are not happy unless they are in it. For an<br />
individual and for a nation, the way they walk through<br />
life I think is infinitely more important than the<br />
position they ultimately achieve. The way they<br />
walk through life depends upon their relationship with<br />
their mates, their friends, the kind of community and<br />
friendship and comradeship which has always been so<br />
much a part of the Australian tradition. So, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen I have great pleasure in declaring open this<br />
first National Youth Conference. We look forward to hearing<br />
your views, to hearing your ideas about the future of this<br />
nation and the course of direction that Government policy<br />
ought to take. </p>
