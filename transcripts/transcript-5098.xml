PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 JULY 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
For more than 40 years Australia has provided a home for the<br />
victims of tyranny. Refugees came to Australia from Nazi<br />
Germany in the 1930' s. After the Second World War, there<br />
was a flow of refugees from the Eastern bloc countries.<br />
Today, refugees are again fleeing from totalitarian oppression,<br />
and from the economic and social disruption which communism<br />
produces when it gains power.<br />
The old refugees were created by the racial and expansionist<br />
policies of Nazi Germany. The new refugees have been created<br />
by the communist regimes which have been set up with brutal and<br />
bloody ruthlessness in Indochina.<br />
The Vietnamese government is methodically driving out people<br />
of ethnic Chinese origin, as well as other citizens who do<br />
not fit its narrow communist mould, at the rate of about<br />
50,000 a month.<br />
There are now about 350,000 refugees in camps in south-east<br />
Asia, primarily in Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia.<br />
This has created grave problems for these countries. The<br />
international community has a clear responsibility to help<br />
ease this burden.<br />
For the people of south-east Asia, this exodus is one of the<br />
great crises in their history. It is one of the great refugee<br />
crises of all time.<br />
The refugees are being resettled in Australia at a rate of<br />
almost 1,000 a month. The United States is planning to<br />
double its intake to 170,000 a year. France has provided a<br />
home for 50,000, and Canada Hong Kong have each resettled<br />
13,000.<br />
The British journal, The Economist, has compared the flood of<br />
refugees from Vietnam in 1979 with what happened to the Jews<br />
of Germany in the 1930' s. The main difference, The Economist<br />
reports, is that Vietnam's persecution has already claimed<br />
more victims than Hitler's had by 1939.<br />
The Vietnamese authorities, like the Nazis, are seizing the<br />
assets of those whom they are exporting so that they leave<br />
the country destitute. </p>
<p>2-<br />
This barbaric trade, wQith its heavy toll in life on some reports<br />
up to 50% of those who leave Vietnam's shores die at sea is<br />
said to be earning the Vietnamese government more than $ 200 million<br />
a year.<br />
It was discussed at the Economic Summit Conference in Tokyo and<br />
at the meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers in Bali. There is<br />
to be another international conference in Geneva later this<br />
month, attended by representatives of some 60 nations.<br />
The refugee problem was amongst the issues discussed in the talks<br />
which I have had in the past few days with the British Prime M~ inister,<br />
Margaret Thatcher, and with the United States Secretary of State,<br />
Cyrus Vance.<br />
All nations need compassion and understanding in dealing with<br />
this problem.<br />
On purely humanitarian grounds, more countries should make places<br />
available to these wretched victims of communism. But that is<br />
only one side of the coin.<br />
If we merely provide resettlement for the refugees, the Vietnamese<br />
will not be discouraged from continuing to drive out those citizens<br />
whom they do not like for reasons of race or because their way of<br />
life does not, suit official ideology.<br />
The Hanoi government should know it cannot continue its barbarous<br />
policy of stripping a section of the Vietnamese people of hundreds<br />
of millions of dollars, and then exporting their victims in the<br />
belief that countries with humanitarian governments will find<br />
room for them.<br />
The long term solution must be for countries throughout the world<br />
to bring weight to bear on Vietnam to cease this trade in human<br />
life. The country in the best position to influence Vietnam is clearly<br />
the Soviet Union, but there is no sign whatsoever that this is<br />
happening.<br />
Mrs Thatcher discussed refugees in the Kremlin when she visited<br />
Moscow on her way last month to the Economic Summit in Tokyo.<br />
She was told that the Vietnamese refugees were criminals, drug<br />
addicts and thieves, and that they were a domestic Vietnamese problem.<br />
It could well be that Russia welcomes this exodus from Vietnam as<br />
a policy which, if pursued in its present massive proportions,<br />
could de-stabilise south-east Asia and lead to the loss of the<br />
economic gains made by these countries over the last Seven or<br />
eight years.<br />
There are those who say that nations should provide more aid to<br />
Vietnam as the best means of persuading them to moderate or change<br />
their policies. Up to last year Australia tried just that. lie<br />
provided aid for peaceful reconstruction. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Instead, Vietnam attacked Kampuchea, where they now have<br />
16 or 17 divisions, and escalated their policy of exporting<br />
their unwanted people.<br />
The policy of holding out the hand of friendship was tried<br />
and was a failure.<br />
That is why we suspended our aid to Vietnam. At the time there<br />
were those who criticised Australia's policy, but other countries<br />
have since taken similar action. The European Community has<br />
decided to suspend food aid to Vietnam, and to divert it<br />
instead to the refugees.<br />
This policy is one that should be followed by other aid donors.<br />
Nobody could claim that the need of the refugees is less than<br />
that of Vietnam. </p>
