PRIM MTAINISTETRANSCRIPT<br />
OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT,<br />
JUNE 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister thanks for joining us. I know you<br />
haven't had a lot of sleep lately. Did you ever expect that<br />
the old guard would react with such verocity and bloodshed?<br />
PM: There was always an outside chance. We've been<br />
monitoring the situation continuously and closely. we have<br />
very competent people there. They said in their reporting<br />
that there was a chance that they thought it more likely<br />
that there would be an outcome which was not of this kind<br />
and speaking for myself I consistently hoped that the more<br />
moderate and intelligent line of my very good friend Zhao<br />
Ziyang, would have prevailed because this sort of process I<br />
know must be anathema to him and he's fought against it,<br />
he's obviously been shunted aside now<br />
LYNEHA4: There are reports that he's under house arrest.<br />
PM: Yes he's certainly out of action. There is no<br />
certainty in the reporting as to his actual fate. Some of<br />
the suggestions were that he could even be executed but I<br />
just most profoundly hope Paul, that he survives not only<br />
for the obvious reason that I want him to, but it's only the<br />
line of Zhao Ziyang and those who think like him that can<br />
provide a lasting resolution of these issues because Deng<br />
and Li Peng may believe that what they've done has bought<br />
this issue to an end, it hasn't and it can't and it won't.<br />
LYNEHAM: They've got so much blood now. Are they going to<br />
be responsive to international reaction do you think?<br />
PM: They won't be, in my judgement, immediately responsive<br />
to international action. Deng for instance some time back<br />
said specifically that they would not be and I think he<br />
speaks accurately in terms of immediate responses. But I<br />
don't believe that in the longer term that they'll be able<br />
to be unresponsive either to the pressure of international<br />
opinion but more particularly to the weight of opinion<br />
within China. The nonsense that's being spoken now by the<br />
authorities about them putting down a minority section of<br />
renegades is patently false on its face. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: When they talk of the dregs of society.<br />
PM: The dregs of society. It's not the dregs of society.<br />
It's very hard to talk about your students, not only in<br />
Beijing but around the country, as the dregs of society.<br />
This is patently a nonsense and there is also evidence<br />
available to us of a degree of hesitancy and indeed<br />
revulsion in sections of the People's Liberation Army which<br />
is not surprising. You imagine the feelings of these young<br />
men in uniform being asked now and required to shoot down<br />
their fellow citizens, citizens who have been acting<br />
peaceably and not making unreasonable demands. Students and<br />
people who are not questioning, in a sense, certain<br />
fundamentals about Chinese society but expressing simply a<br />
fundamental human desire for the freedom of expression and<br />
the opportunity to participate. Now those things are not<br />
going to be able to be put down in any permanent sense so it<br />
will be a combination in my judgement of the pressure of<br />
international opinion and the intrinsic impossibility within<br />
China of holding this position.<br />
LYNEHAM: Very quickly Prime Minister, there are about 1500<br />
Australians in China tonight. Are they safe?<br />
PM: There are more than that. Our best count is that there<br />
is approximately 500 Australians in a sense who are<br />
permanently there. That's a combination of those in the<br />
Embassy and in other posts in China. Students and business<br />
people, approximately 500 in that category and anything up<br />
to 1500 tourists. So we're probably looking at about 2000.<br />
Are they safe? I believe so. They obviously shouldn't take<br />
risks in going out and exposing themselves to danger but we<br />
have confidence in the capacity of our Embassy people there<br />
to protect them.<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, thanks for speaking with us.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
