MAJOR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA SIGNED TODAY<br />
The following is a brief description of the three major<br />
agreements between Australia and Indonesia signed earlier<br />
today.<br />
The Fisheries Co-operation Agreement will help in the<br />
management of the fishery resources, and in the conservation<br />
of stocks which straddle the waters of both countries. The<br />
Agreement will facilitate the exchange of information and<br />
fisheries personnel and co-operation across a wide range of<br />
fisheries related activities, including developments in<br />
fishing gear, training, agriculture, surveillance, marketing<br />
end post-harvest technology.<br />
The Agreement will also encourage closer co-operation on<br />
research and management of fishery resources of mutual<br />
interest, including straddling stocks, shared stocks and<br />
highly migratory species. it will provide a consultative<br />
mechanisin under which issues such as illegal fishing in the<br />
Australian fishing zone ( AFZ) and overfishing by foreign<br />
fleets in waters adjacent to the AFZ can be discussed. The<br />
Agreement does not itself provide for any new access to each<br />
others' fishing zones, although it does provide a framework<br />
for possible future access should the state of fish stocks<br />
permit. The Double Taxation Agreement will clarify the taxing rights<br />
of Australia and Indonesia over income flows between them. It<br />
contains provisions for the avoidance of double taxation and<br />
the prevention of tax evasion. The Agreement allocates taxing<br />
rights in respect of various categories of income flowing<br />
between Australia and Indonesia. Certain classes of income<br />
are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the<br />
recipient. Other classes of income may be taxed in the<br />
country of origin, with the country of residence of the<br />
recipient. Other classes of income may be taxed in the<br />
country of origin, with the country or residence, If it also<br />
taxes the Income, allowing a credit in respect of the tax paid<br />
in the other country. In addition, the Agreement places<br />
limitations upon the rate of tax that the country of origin<br />
may impose on dividend, interest and royalty income and<br />
pensions, Including government pensionB, paid to residents of<br />
the other country. </p>

The Second World War brought Australians and Indonesians<br />
into extensive contact with each other.<br />
After the war there was widespread sympathy among<br />
Australians for the cause of Indonesian independence.<br />
The sympathy found concrete expression when, in the course<br />
of the Indonesian struggle, the Australian labour movement<br />
imposed boycotts and black bans against Dutch shipping.<br />
In 1947 it was Australia, together with India, which brought<br />
the matter of Indonesian independence before the UN Security<br />
Council. Shortly after, Australia was nominated by Indonesia to sit<br />
on the three-nation United Nations Good Offices Committee.<br />
As one coymientator said, this display of confidence in<br />
Australia by Indonesia was the high-water mark of relations<br />
between our countries in the early post-war years.<br />
Australia co-sponsored Indonesia's admission to the United<br />
Nations in 1950.<br />
The achievement of your independence was thus one of the<br />
proud moments in the history of Australian diplomacy.<br />
But of course the historical threads go well beyond the lost<br />
fifty years.<br />
Australia, after all, was once called New Holland.<br />
Not many years af ter the Dutch established themselves in<br />
Indonesia, one of their number, named Abel Tasman, sailed<br />
from Jakarta or Batavia as it was then known along the<br />
west and south coasts of Australia.<br />
He left Australia, rather ungraciously remarking, " there is<br />
no good to be done here".<br />
And he sailed on to trade with places in the north,<br />
including Japan.<br />
Asia has long been a theatre for trade between dissimilar<br />
societies, and Australia and Indonesia have long been a part<br />
of it.<br />
Before Europeans traded in the region, fishermen from the<br />
Makassar area In what was then called the Celebes, were<br />
trading with China in trepang gathered of f the northern<br />
Australian coast.<br />
This was Australia's first export commodity: and a valueadded<br />
one at that for, with the cooperation and assistance<br />
of the Australian Aboriginals, the trepang was cured and<br />
smoked on Australian shores for export to China. </p>
<p>TEL:*: Ir r&gt; i-<br />

The cultural influence of this trade can still be seen in<br />
the language and culture of the Australian Aboriginals who<br />
came in contact with the peoples from the Makassar area.<br />
In the era of colonial Australia and colonial Indonesia,<br />
Jakarta was a refuge and source of supplies for British<br />
ships beginning with James Cook's Endeavour.<br />
In the first half of 1790, the Infant British colony at<br />
Sydney Cove, cut of f from home, terribly alone, and as yet<br />
Incapable of making the new environment yield food, sent a<br />
ship to Jakarta for supplies.<br />
By the time it returned, British ships had arrived and the<br />
colony was saved, but the ship from Jakarta was very welcome<br />
nonetheless. Ladies and gentlemen, as we plan our strategic, trading and<br />
cultural relationships in this last decade of the twentieth<br />
century, -it is worth bearing these historical threads in<br />
mind. Together they suggest a pattern of interdependence.<br />
They hint at what can be done.<br />
Today we believe a great deal can be done not merely in<br />
response to immediate needs, but in pursuit of a worthwhile<br />
and enduring relationship between our two countries.<br />
In quite different ways we have both emerged from a colonial<br />
past. We have both committed ourselves to the kind of<br />
radical economic reform which will give our nations a secure<br />
place in the world.<br />
The Australian government believes that all we do In the<br />
world, in Asia and the Pacific, all we do in Indonesia, we<br />
will do best as a nation of independent and unambivalent<br />
mind. We have long been Independent.<br />
But, perhaps because we are a European country living<br />
alongside Asia, the residues of colonialism have tended to<br />
persist. There is a conservative element in Australian society not<br />
so strong as It was, but influential just the same which,<br />
through its attachment to the past and Its anxiety about the<br />
Asia-Pacific future, tends to resist the full expression of<br />
Australian nationhood.<br />
it Is the same element which opposed Indonesian independence<br />
in the 1940s.<br />
Attitudes are often the last things to change. </p>
<p>T EL: P9<br />

As I'm sure it affected Indonesia long after independence,<br />
the colonial legacy still affects us. and we still face<br />
questions about what part of it we should retain and what<br />
parts cast off.<br />
A great d eal of our British colonial heritage underpins our<br />
political and legal institutions. It remains a defining<br />
element in our culture.<br />
We do not seek to change these things.<br />
But our population is no longer the overwhelmingly British<br />
one it was.<br />
Contemporary Australia is multicultural the old<br />
Australians of English, Scots and Irish stock having been<br />
joined by large numbers of people from all the countries of<br />
Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia. By that<br />
measure alone we are very much part of the world.<br />
Multi-culturalism has done much to break down our fear of<br />
cultural difference, and therefore our old fear of Asia.<br />
We are substantially changed in this.<br />
we are more worldly, more mature.<br />
So should we be.<br />
By most measures we are not a young country. The<br />
Commonwealth of Australia is almost 100 years old.<br />
Australian democracy, founded in the 1850s, is much older<br />
than most democracies in the world.<br />
There should be no question about our identity or where our<br />
loyalties lie.<br />
For far too long we have measured the strength of our<br />
society, the level of our sophistication, the worth of our<br />
achievements, against Britain and Europe and against the<br />
United States.<br />
At times we have done this while clinging to such vestiges<br />
of the old imperial power and culture as will, we think,<br />
earn us respect In the world.<br />
we think the time has come to step out of the colonial<br />
shadow and make our position clear:<br />
* we are Australian<br />
* we are engaged with Asia.<br />
We are different culturally, historically, politically<br />
but we can handle the difference. </p>
<p>2&gt; Iipr<br />
We believe we can contribute something to what is already a<br />
diverse region. The Asia-Pacific, as well as Indonesia, canl<br />
achieve unity in diversity.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the Australian government is actively<br />
and unequivocally comm~ itted to this region and to<br />
developing, In particular, a relationship with Indonesia.<br />
In significant ways we have shared the past. If we are<br />
prepared to put in the effort, we can share a much more<br />
substantial future.<br />
In the forty-two years of our diplomatic relations, there<br />
have been substantial achievements as well as periodic<br />
setbacks. If we reflect on that experience, I think we will see that<br />
we have made progress when we have been realistic.<br />
We have achieved things, and been able to protect those<br />
achievements, when we have found a tangible basis for our<br />
work. We have been disappointed, I think, when we have failed to<br />
take sufficient account of our different outlooks.<br />
We are very different countries. We will always see some<br />
things differently.<br />
What we need for a successful bilateral relationship is the<br />
firm ground of tangible achievements, and real incentives to<br />
see us through the times when good will is not enough.<br />
We need to identify our shared Interests and create the<br />
Institutional links which will consolidate our progress.<br />
We need to create the conditions in which new shared<br />
interests will emerge.<br />
To point the way towards a more secure relationship, let me<br />
say where I think some of our most important common<br />
interests lie.<br />
Most obviously we share an Interest In success.<br />
More, probably, than most Australians appreciate, our<br />
country has benefited enormously from the success of yours<br />
in recent years.<br />
Our experience of nation-building has not followed the same<br />
path as yours.<br />
As a consequence, we are inclined sometimes to underestimate<br />
how difficult it is to achieve orderly development in a<br />
nation as vast as Indonesia, and as culturally, ethnically<br />
and religiously diverse.<br />
The achievemen~ ts of President Soeharto's New Order are very<br />
great. </p>
<p>6<br />
Between 1966 and 1991, Indonesia's real GDP rose 450 per<br />
cent. Its real growth rate over this period has been one of the<br />
highest among developing countries.<br />
Structural change has been rapid; agriculture's share of GDP<br />
is half what it was a quarter century ago.<br />
In the late l970s Indonesia was the world's largest importer<br />
of rice. In 1984 Indonesia became self-sufficient.<br />
The people of Indonesia are now better fed, housed and<br />
educated than ever before. Infant mortality rates are<br />
approximately half what they were.<br />
These are triumphs.<br />
But the achievements of the Soeharto Government spread wider<br />
than this.<br />
in establishing political stability and economic progress in<br />
Indonesia, your government has contributed to stability and<br />
prosperity In the wider South-East Asian region.<br />
Australia Is among the beneficiaries.<br />
We gain commercially, of course; but just as importantly,<br />
our national security benefits from a benign environment<br />
where not so many years ago there was great uncertainty and<br />
volatility. We share with Indonesia a fundamental interest In the<br />
strategic stability of our region, and in limiting the<br />
potential for external powers to introduce tension or<br />
conflict. Recognising this shared strategic interest, we are keen to<br />
work with Indonesia as equal partners to strengthen<br />
bilateral defence relations.<br />
There is scope for building closer links between our armed<br />
forces end defence organisations. We can do this with more<br />
high-level visits and consultations, combined exercises,<br />
training and other exchanges.<br />
Earlier I referred to those seamen from the Makassar area<br />
who for hundreds of years made annual calls to harvest the<br />
trepang from the shores of Aboriginal Australia.<br />
Plainly, for hundreds of years a common interest was<br />
recognised and practical arrangements devised.<br />
So now our practical interactions as neighbouring countries<br />
create another category of shared Interests.<br />
Our maritime border is the most obvious of these. </p>

Most of the sea-bed boundaries were formally delimited<br />
twenty years ago, but there remained important areas where<br />
agreement had not been reached.<br />
The most extensive of these was the Timior Gap, covering<br />
potentially rich reserves of oil and gas under the Timor<br />
Sea. Rather then attempt to reconcile different legal<br />
interpretations of rights ever the continental shelf, the<br />
two governmients established a joint development zone for the<br />
cooperative exploration and exploitation of the area's<br />
petroleum resources.<br />
TheTinmor Gap Zone ofCooperation Treaty, which entered into<br />
force niVFebruary 191, ii~ triumph of creative cooperation<br />
between our two governments. It is the most substantial<br />
bilateral agFreent we have concluded.<br />
It demonstrates conclusively that we can find imaginative<br />
solutions to bilateral problems when we recognise the common<br />
Interest and apply to it the necessary political will.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, earlier today three more bilateral<br />
agreements were signed.<br />
They deal with double taxation, extradition and fisheries<br />
cooperation. In practical ways they each expand and strengthen the<br />
framework to improve the bilateral Interaction between<br />
Australia and Indonesia as outward-looking neighbours.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as everyone here Is aware, the<br />
situation In Last Timnor has been a recurring and sometimes<br />
divisive issue in our relations.<br />
I should take this opportunity to explain that the<br />
disproportionate attention East Timor receives in Australia<br />
does not mean that we are not Interested in the welfare of<br />
the 182 million people who live in Indonesia's 26 other<br />
provinces. The attention East Timor receives, internationally and in<br />
Australia, is a natural consequence of the territory's<br />
uniquely troubled history, beginning with its neglect under<br />
Portuguese rule.<br />
We carry no brief for the Portuguese occupation of the<br />
territory, or for the manner of their leaving or their<br />
recent diplomatic manoeuvres.<br />
Australia's outlook has been shaped by the additional<br />
factors of our proximity to East Timor, the fraternal links<br />
we had with the people of East Timor during the Second World<br />
War, and the sizeable East Timorese community which now<br />
lives in Australia. </p>
<p>TEL:* 1 : i tic,' F<br />
Australia made it clear that it did not condone the manner<br />
in which Indonesia acquired East Timor, but since 1979 we<br />
have accepted Indonesian sovereignty over the territory.<br />
The Australian Government has made clear its views about the<br />
tragic events In Dili last November.<br />
We consider the subsequent actions of the Indonesian<br />
Government, including President Soeharto's public statements<br />
and the measures announced by the Army Chief-of-Staff on 27<br />
February, to constitute a credible response.<br />
Our continuing concern Is with what practical help we might<br />
be able to give to the people of East Timor.<br />
Our aim as concerned outsiders is to assist where we can in<br />
measures for their welfare, and to support a process of<br />
reconciliation between them and the Indonesian authorities.<br />
I am pleased that during this visit our two goverrnents have<br />
been able to sign a memorandum covering an 11.5 million<br />
dollar Australian Bid project to improve water supply and<br />
sanitation in parts of East Timor.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in coming to terms with a more fluid<br />
political environment in Asia, Australia and Indonesia have<br />
ample scope to cooperate in helping shape the regional<br />
agenda. Indonesia's regional credentials are very clear.<br />
It is a leading member of the Association of South-East<br />
Asian Nations ( ASEAN), which is a focus of wider dialogue<br />
and cooperation.<br />
I should like to think that Australia, too, has demonstrated<br />
an ability to contribute usefully to regional diplomacy in<br />
recent years.<br />
Our two countries have invested considerable effort in the<br />
long negotiations leading up to last October's<br />
comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict.<br />
our armed forces are now serving in Cambodia as part of the<br />
United Nations peace-keeping presence.<br />
We have also worked closely together to encourage a regional<br />
dialogue on security issues, centred on the ASEAN PMC<br />
process. Ladies and gentlemen, I said at the beginning of this<br />
address that it Is remarkable what can be achieved when<br />
common interests are identified and pursued. And they will<br />
be pursued the herder If they are material common interests. </p>
<p>9<br />
It is one of the happy coincidences of the history of our<br />
two nations that In recent years we have adopted economic<br />
strategies which greatly multiply our common interests.<br />
We were both overly dependent on commodities. We have both<br />
sought to correct our external imbalances. We have both<br />
liberalised our economies.<br />
Since coming to office in 1983, the Australian Government<br />
has removed exchange controls, floated the Australian dollar<br />
and made it a more competitive currency, deregulated banking<br />
and radically reduced import protection.<br />
We have cut back the government sector and cut taxes. We<br />
are now encouraging an historic shift from industry-wide<br />
labour relations arrangements to workplace bargaining.<br />
In the same period Indonesia has transformed its economy by<br />
Implementing strikingly similar policies.<br />
Banking has been deregulated and monetary policy changed so<br />
that it now relies on interest rates instead of credit<br />
restrictions. Indonesia has cut protection against imports, Increased<br />
manufacturing production and reduced dependence on<br />
commodities. You too have cut back on government spending, rationalised<br />
taxes and created a competitive exchange rate.<br />
Both our economies are now much more open and outward<br />
looking. Both are more competitive and more diverse I would venture<br />
to say, more creative.<br />
I would also go so far as to say that what we have done has<br />
given our countries a better chance in the modern world.<br />
our own success might be seen In the growth of our economy<br />
by more than one third in the past decade, in the fact that<br />
we are exporting more, that our trade is increasingly with<br />
our regional neighbours, and the contents of exports now<br />
includes a significant proportion of services and<br />
manufactures, in addition to our traditional strengths In<br />
food, minerals and other raw materials.<br />
Indonesia's success might be measured in those dramatic<br />
improvements in living standards I referred to earlier, and<br />
in average real GDP growth of about 6 per cent during the<br />
1980s. Ladies and gentlemen, this common strategy of creating<br />
liberal market-oriented economies produces, as I said,<br />
common Interests.<br />
Concrete common Interests. </p>
<p>TEL:-<br />
It has taken longer than it should have, but in recent years<br />
Australia and Indonesia have discovered each other<br />
commercially. We have discovered that we have goods and services to<br />
exchange and investments to make.<br />
Between 1989 and 1991 two-way trade increased by 66 per<br />
cent, to be worth approximately 2.4 billion Australian<br />
dollars. Australian investment in Indonesia has increased markedly.<br />
Indonesian companies are now also starting to invest in<br />
Australia. The trade in services is also growing in tourism,<br />
education, medicine, and support industries for the major<br />
mining ventures.<br />
There are many other areas in which Australian expertise<br />
should be able to find niches in Indonesia. Pleasing as the<br />
trend of recent years has been, we know that we have the<br />
potential to play a much bigger part.<br />
We have much to offer In the way of raw materials, capital<br />
equipment and technology.<br />
Australia's experience in coping with similar climates,<br />
extensive coastlines and long distances has produced<br />
technology and solutions well-suited to Indonesia often<br />
much better suited than the products of, say, Japan, Germany<br />
or the United States.<br />
Our experience and expertise in many other other areas is<br />
second to none in the world in forest management, solar<br />
technology, food processing and coal-fired power stations<br />
for instance.<br />
We can assist as exporters, but just as readily as joint<br />
venture partners.<br />
I'm confident that we will find the larger role we seek.<br />
As both countries expand along this liberal economic path we<br />
can expect the trade to grow. We can expect the range of<br />
shared interests to grow.<br />
We can expect, I believe, a much more productive and durable<br />
relationship between our two countries.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in recent public statements in<br />
Australia, I have emphasised the need for us to come to<br />
terms with the economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
our external policy reflects the interest we share with you<br />
in maintaining a sound multilateral system for international<br />
trade. </p>
