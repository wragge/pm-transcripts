    <content><![CDATA[<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister can I just ask how the boys are?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look the boys are in good spirits, they're still obviously recovering from a traumatic experience and it's going to take a long time for them to fully recover and one of them needs some more medical work but they're lucky men and we're grateful that they survived the accident, and I am pleased that I have had the opportunity to call and see them, and tell them how much 20 million Australians are pulling for them.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Did they say much about the accident?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No no I didn't talk about that, that's not appropriate, that's something that belongs to the enquiry.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> And what happens to them now, do you know what...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> They'll go back south -  they're leaving here today and they'll get the very best of medical treatment.  They were very complimentary about the medical treatment on Kanimbla.  They said they experienced it; they were on the delivery side of it until this tragic accident, and then after the accident, they received it, and they were very complimentary, so it's a wonderful thing that the rest of the Company can be very proud of the high quality work that the men and women on the Kanimbla are carrying out. Thank you.</p>
