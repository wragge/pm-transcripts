SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MINISTERIAL MEETING OF FAIR TRADERS IN AGRICULTURE<br />
CAIRNS 25 AUGUST 1986<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
I EXTEND TO YOU MY WARMEST WELCOME TO AUSTRALIA AND TO THIS<br />
HISTORIC MEETING OF AGRICULTURAL FAIR TRADERS. I HOPE THE<br />
VENUE HERE AT CAIRNS WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU A CONGENIAL<br />
ATMOSL; HERE FOR YOUR DISCUSSIONS OF A VITALLY IMPORTANT<br />
AGENDA FOR ALL OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
I THINK IT IS NO UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT THE GATT<br />
MIN:: S ERIAL MEETING AT PUNTA DEL ESTE IN SEPTEMBER TO<br />
CONSIDER THE LAUNCH OF A NEW ROUND OF HULTILATERAL TRADENEGOTXATIONS<br />
WILL BE THE MAIN AND PROBABLY ONLY OPPORTUNITY<br />
OVFA ?' HE NEXT DECADE FOR SETTING IN PLACE MULTILATERAL<br />
MECHANISMS TO RESTORE SOME SANITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
AGnl(: JLTURAL TRADING SYSTEM.<br />
IT Tl. 7REFORE GIVES ME SPECIAL PLEASURE TO WELCOME TO CAIRNS<br />
MINISTER IGLESIAS WHO WILL BE CHAIRING THE HINISTERIAL<br />
MEETING IN PUNTA DEL ESTE. I HAVE DISCUSSED AGRICULTURAL<br />
TRADING PROBLEMS BRIEFLY WITH MR IGLESIAS IN CANBERRA. I<br />
WAS BOTH IMPRESSED AND HEARTENED BY HIS KEEN APPRECIATION<br />
AS FORMER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR<br />
LA': IN AMERICA AND NOW AS EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER IN AN<br />
EFFICIENT AGRICULTURAL EXPORTING COUNTRY OF THE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF SEEKING REMEDIES TO THE<br />
AGRICULTURAL TRADE CRISIS THROUGH THE NEW MTN ROUND.<br />
WE MIGHT ASK WHAT IT IS THAT CHARACTERISES THE POSITION OF<br />
ALL COUNTRIES ASSEMBLED HERE. IT IS NO MORE NOR LESS THAN<br />
THEIR DETERMINATION TO SEEK FOR THE EXPORTS OF THEIR<br />
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES THE SAME REGIME OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADING RULES AS THE MAJORS HAVE APPLIED FOR DECADES TO<br />
TRADE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS.<br />
THE TASK BEFORE THIS GROUP OF FAIR TRADERS IS TO DEVELOP<br />
TACTICS FOR MAXIMISING ITS INFLUENCE IN PUTTING AN END TO<br />
THE ECONOMIC MADNESS NOW PERVADING WORLD AGRICULTURAL TRADE. </p>
<p>THE DISTORTION OF THE WORLD AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND<br />
TRADING SYSTEM HAS REACHED LUDICROUS PROPORTIONS. EACH YEAR<br />
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CHANNELS INTO AGRICULTURE IN THE<br />
ORDER OF $ US100 BILLION IN DIRECT SUBSIDIES AND CONSUMER<br />
TRANSFERS. THIS MASSIVE SUBSIDY TO EUROPEAN FARMERS HAS<br />
INDUCED THEM TO PRODUCE MUCH MORE THAN EUROPE ITSELF CAN<br />
CONSU.'-" t7. THE HUGE SURPLUSES ARE BEING DUMPED ONTO WORLD<br />
MARKETS, WITH THE AID OF LARGE EXPORT SUBSIDIES.<br />
NOT ONLY IS THIS DEVASTATING FARMING COMMUNITIES IN OUR<br />
COUNTRIES, IT IS HURTING THE EUROPEANS THEMSELVES. BECAUSE<br />
OF THE DISTORTION OF THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMIES, AND IN<br />
PARTICULAR, BECAUSE EUROPEAN CONSUMERS HAVE TO PAY<br />
ARTIFICXALLY HIGH PRICES FOR THEIR FOOD, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS<br />
ARE MUCH HIGHER AND ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES ARE LOWER TrHAN<br />
THEY OTHIERWISE WOULD BE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE COMMON<br />
AGRICULTURAL POLICY HAS PUSHED UP TO ONE MILLION P~ EOPLE ONTO<br />
THE UWNflPLOYDIENT QUEUES IN EUROPE.<br />
NOW THE' AMERICANS ARE RETALIATING AGAINST THE EUROPEANS ON A<br />
MASSIVE SCALE.<br />
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS ARE BEING CALLED ON TO SUBSIDISE THEIR<br />
FARMERS TO THlE TUNE OF $ US35 BILLION A YEAR. THIS DOES NOT<br />
INCLUDE THlE TRANSFERS TO FARMERS FROM AMERICAN CONSUMERS<br />
WHICH RESULTS FROM THEIR HAVING TO PAY INFLATED PRICES FOR<br />
AGRICUL~ TURAL PRODUCTS. AND LIKE THE EUROPEANS, THE<br />
AMERICANS ARE HEAVILY SUBSIDISING AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS IN<br />
ORDER T'O RUN DOWN THEIR DOMESTIC AGRICULTURAL SURPLUSES.<br />
EFFIC ENT AGRICULTURAL EXPORTING COUNTRIES ARE THE INNOCENT<br />
VICTIIS OF THIS TRANS-ATLANTIC TRADE WAR. WE ARE ALSO BEING<br />
DANAGED BY THE SUBSIPISING AND RESTRICTIVE MARKET ACCESS<br />
POLICIES OF OTHER MAJOR WESTERN INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES.<br />
ANOTHER RECENT CASUALTY OF THAT WAR HAS BEEN US INTEGRITY.'<br />
IN THE PAST THE US HAS LED THE CAMPAIGN TO RESTRICT BENEFITS<br />
TO THE SOVIET UNION, SO AS TO DISCOURAGE THE DIVERSION OF<br />
RESOURCES FROM PEACEFUL INTO NON-PEACEFUL USES. THE RECENT<br />
DECISION TO EXTEND WHEAT SUBSIDIES TO THE SOVIET UNION FLIES<br />
IN THE FACE OF THIS POLICY STANCE.<br />
THE US-LED CAMPAIGN AGAINST SUBSIDISING THE SOVIET UNION HAS<br />
BEEN FOUNDED ON PRINCIPLES OF PROTECTING WESTERN IDEALS OF<br />
LIBERTY LIBERTY IN M4ARKETS AS IN THE FUNDAMENTAL REALM OF<br />
POLITICS. THE UNITED STATES HAS COMPROMISED THOSE<br />
PRINCIPLES FOR SHORT-TERM POLITICAL GAIN. SUCH ARE THE<br />
TERMS ON WHICH THIS RIDICULOUS AGRICULTURAL TRADE WAR IS<br />
BEING CONDUCTED.<br />
AMONG THE FOURTEEN NATIONS REPRESENTED HERE AGRICULTURE<br />
CONSTITUTES, ON AVERAGE, 14 PER CENT OF OUR GDP AND 50 PER<br />
CENT OF OUR EXPORTS. COLLECTIVELY WE ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY<br />
ONE-QUARTER OF WORLD AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS, AND FOR THE<br />
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF NON-US AND NON-EC FOOD EXPORTS. </p>
<p>IT FOLLOWS THAT WE ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THE<br />
CORRUPTION OF WORLD AGRICULTURAL MARKETS BY AGRICULTURAL<br />
SUBSIDIES AND RISING AGRICULTURAL PROTECTIONISM.<br />
AND SUFFER O1E HAVE.<br />
STUDIES FOR THE WORLJD BANK INDICATE THAT WORLD-WIDE LOSSES<br />
FROM DISTORr2IONS IN GRAINS, LIVESTOCK AND SUGAR MARKETS HAVE<br />
AMOUNTED TO PBOUT $ US36 BILLION A YEAR ( IN 1980 PRICES).<br />
THE DIRECT COST TO FARMERS IN DEVE~ LOPING COUNTRIES H4AS BEEN<br />
ABOUT $ Us28 BILLION A YEAR. THIS HAS DIRECT~ LY INTENSIFIED<br />
THE RURAL POVERTY AND HUMAN MISERY IN POOR COUNTRIES. BUT<br />
IT HAS DONE IORE THAN THIS. IT HAS SERIOUSLY UNDERN~ INED THE<br />
CAPACITY OF THOSE COUNTRIES TO SERICE. THEIR EXTERNAL DEBT,<br />
AND THEREFOtVS HAS ENSURED CONTINUING POVERTY, CONTINUING<br />
MISERY, WELL INTO THE FUTURE.<br />
POOR RICE FARMERS IN THAILAND AflE BEING DEVASTATED BY THE US<br />
DUMPING OF SURPLUS RICE. ARGENTINE GRAIN FARMERS HAVE FACED<br />
PRICE CUTS OF' 20 PER CENT. AS MANY AS ONE IN FIVE WESTERN<br />
CANADIAN WHEAT FARMERS MAY BE FORCED OUT OF BUSINESS. AND<br />
IN AUSTPALliS CASE, THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY HAS BEEN<br />
COSTING US BILLION A YEAR IN RECENT YEARS. THE UNITED<br />
STATES EXPORT~ ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WILL COST AUSTRALIAN WHEAT<br />
FARMERS ALONZ WELL OVER $ A600 MILLION IN THE COxiING YEAR.<br />
REFORM OF WJORLD AGRICULTURlAL TRADE IS A LONG HAUL. IT IS A<br />
PROCESS WHIC71 REQUIRES A DEDICATED AND CONCERTED EFFORT DY<br />
ALL COUNTFR! ZS COMMITTED TO THE LIBERALISATION OF<br />
AGRICULTURAL TRADE. AND IT IS A PROCESS REQUIRING A SERIES<br />
OF DELIBERArE, CAREFULLY CONSIDERED STEPS.<br />
THIS CAIRNS HEETYNG 73 A FURTHE{, AlND IRPORTART, STEP IN<br />
THAT PnOCUSS. IT FOLLOWS A SERIES OF EARLIER INITIATIVES<br />
TAKEN BY COUNTRIES WITHIN THIS GROUP.<br />
AT AUSTRALIA'S INSTIGATION AN APPROACH TO TRADE AMONG<br />
COUNTRIES ' CVl THE WESTERN PACIFIC REGION, BASED UPON THEIR<br />
COMMON REGIONAL INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS, HAS BEEN<br />
ESTABLISHED. THIS GROUP OF COUNTRIES HAS BEEN MEETING<br />
REGULARLY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS IN PREPARATION FOR THE<br />
NEW ROUND. THE GROUP MET AGAIN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN<br />
MANILA. I CAN REPORT AN IMPORTANT STRENGTHENING OF THE<br />
SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE AMONG THOSE COUNTRIES.<br />
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTERS MET IN<br />
VANCOUVER. URUGUAY HAS HOSTED A MEETING OF' SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE<br />
EXPORTERS OF TEMPERATE AGRICULTURE PRODUCE.<br />
AND IN JULY, THAILAND HOSTED AN IMPORTANT MEETING OF<br />
OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER REMEDIES TO THE PROBLEMS OF WORLD<br />
AGRICULTJRAL TRADE AND TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THIS<br />
WEEK'S MEETING. </p>
<p>THERE IS SIGNIFICANCE AND COHERENCE IN THIS PATTERN OF<br />
CONSULTA'IO0N. IT EXPRESSES THE COMMON APPRECIATION AMONG<br />
MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND GROUPS OF COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE. AND IT EXPRESSES<br />
THEIR DETE'RMINATION TO SEE THE PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY THOSE<br />
NATIONS AND BLOCS CORRUPTING WORLD AGRICULTURAL TRADE.<br />
THE MEETING OF FAIR TRADERS COMES AT THE CRUCIAL STAGE<br />
BETWEEN COMPLETION OF THC PREPARATORY WORK ! N GENEVA<br />
LAST MONTH AND THE GATT MINISTERIAL ! IFETING NEXT MONTHT.<br />
I AM DELIGHTED AND HEARTENED BY THE ATTENDANCE HERlE AT<br />
CAIRNS. YOU HAVE COME HERE AS FRIENDS AND I HOPE TRAT OUR<br />
FRIENDSHIP WILL BE BROADENED AND STRENGTHENED OVER THE NEXT<br />
COUPLE OF DAYS.<br />
IN PLANNING OUR NEXT STEPS WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT WE MIGHT<br />
EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THE MEETING AT CAIRNS AND IN<br />
PARTICULAR, OUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR PUNTA DEL ESTE AND<br />
BEYOND. THERE IS NO DOUBT THlAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE<br />
COUNTRIES REPRESENTED HERE WILL BE Å“ IAXII4ISED IF VIE BEHAVE AS<br />
A STRONG COALITION OF LIiKE-riINDED AG-RICULTURAL EXPORTING<br />
COUNTRIES. WE KNOW THAT AGRICULTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TREATED AS A<br />
" SPECIAL CASE" IN THE GATT, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE GATT<br />
RULES ON AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROTECTIONISM ARE FAR LESS<br />
EFFECTXV' 7U THAN THOSE FOR M~ ANUFACTURES.<br />
I BELIEVE THAT OUR GROUP MUST WOEN' WITH DETER14INATION AND<br />
TOTAL CONNITMENT TOWARDS SECURING MORE EFFECTIVE GATT RULES<br />
FOR AGRI'"' JLTURE.. TO THIS END, VIE SHOULD SEEN AT THE PUNTA<br />
DEL ESTE M4EETING A LAUNCH OF A NEW MTN ROUND GIVING HIGH<br />
PRIORITY TO AGRICULTURE. TIE SHOULD SET OUR SIGHTS HIGH FOR<br />
THE PROMINENCE TO BE GIVEN TO AGRICULTURE IN THE TEXT OF THE<br />
MINISTERZAL DECLARATION COMING OUT OF THE MlEETING.<br />
THE DISCUSSIONS I HAVE HAD ON THIS ISSUE WITH WORLD LEADERS,<br />
INCLUDING PRESIDENT REAGAN, MR NAKASONE, MR MULRONEY AND<br />
PRESIDENT ALFONSIN GIVE ME GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT WE<br />
HAVE SOME PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR<br />
AGRICULTURE IN THE MTN ROUND. BUT IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THAT<br />
PROSPECT, TO MAKE IT A REALITY, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE<br />
GROUP OF FAIR TRADERS GATHERED HERE ADOPT A STRONG, UNIFIED<br />
APPROACH ZN THE LEAD-UP TO AND BEYOND THE GATT MINISTERIAL<br />
MEETING. THE DRAFT DECLARATION NEGOTIATED BY THE MAJOR PARTIES IN<br />
GENEVA ( THE SO-CALLED SWISS-COLOMBIAN TEXT) GOES SOME WAY IN<br />
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF AGRICULTURE, BUT FALLS SHORT OF<br />
OUR HIGHER ASPIRATIONS. MOREOVER, WE CANNOT RULE OUT THE<br />
POSSIBILITY AT PUNTA DEL ESTE OF PRESSURE BY SOME COUNTRIES<br />
TO DILUTE THE TEXT DEALING WITH AGRICULTURE. </p>
<p>THE DURATION OF THE PUNTA DEL ESTE MEETING IS QUITE SHORT.<br />
IT IS THEREFORE MOST IMPORTANT THAT IN THE FEW REMAINING<br />
WEEKS BEFORE THAT MEETING, THIS GROUP OF FAIR TRADERS SEEK<br />
TO ENLIST THE SUPPORT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN GIVING HIGH<br />
PRIORITY TO AGRICULTURE IN THE DECLARATION AND IN SUBSEQUENT<br />
NEGOTIATIONS. WHILE WE MUS 2 WORK TOGETHER FOR THE LASTING REFORM OF WORLD<br />
AGRICULTURAL TRADE, WE MUST ALSO REALISE THAT A NEW ROUND OF<br />
MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WOULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO<br />
CONCLUDE. IT IS THEREFORE IN OUR INTERESTS ALSO TO WIORK<br />
TOWARDS SHORTER-TERM REMEDIES, WHILE DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING<br />
PLACE IN TH2 GATT.<br />
THERE IS SCOPE FOR OUR COUNTRIES TO MAKE FORCEFUL JOINT<br />
REPRESENTATIONS TO THE EC AND THE US IN PARTICULAR, WITH A<br />
VIEW TO MINIMISING THE IMPACT OF THEIR EXISTING AGRICULTURAL<br />
POLICIES ON NON-SUBSIDISING EXPORTERS, AND WITH THE AIM OF<br />
ACHIEVING LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THOSE POLICIES.<br />
THE SIHULTANEOUS REPRESENTATIONS BY SOME OF US TO THE US<br />
DURING TH!: IP RECENT DELIBERATIONS ON THE EXTENSION OF THE<br />
EEP IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS. OUR EFFORTS WERE INFLUENTIAL<br />
IN THE FINVAL DECISION TO RESTRICT THE EXTENSION OF THE EEP.<br />
THIS MEETING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OUR COUNTRIES<br />
TO PREPARI, kETTER FOR FUTURE SIMILAR CONTINGENCIES IN BOTH<br />
THE US AND THE EC.<br />
THERE IS NMO DOUBT THAT INTERNAT* IONAL AGRICULTURE III<br />
CRISIS. EjUj. THE MOST DISPIRITING, THE MOST DESPAIRING,<br />
FEATURE 0F THIS CRISIS IS THAT IS HAS NOT BEEN CAUSED BY ANY<br />
LACK OF EVFICIENCY, DEDICATION OR SHEER HARD WORK BY THE MEN<br />
AND WOMEN ON THE LAND IN OUR COUNTRIES. THE TRAGEDY OF THIS<br />
CRISIS HAS BEEN M4ADE ALL THE MORE POIGNANT BY THE ENOAMOUS<br />
COURAGE LUND COMMITMENT OF OUR FARMERS IN EVER BOOSTING THEIR<br />
EFFICIENCY IN THE FACE OF FALLING WORLD AGRICULTURAL PRICES<br />
PRECIPITATED BY THE SUBSIDISERS.<br />
OUR TRUE HOPE AND ULTIMATELY, OUR MAIN CHANCE OF LIBERA-IING<br />
GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL TRADE FROM THE CORRUPTION OF THE<br />
SUBSIDISERS, IS TO BRING HOME TO THEM THE FACT THAT OUR<br />
INTERESTS IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE REFORM COINCIDE TOTALLY WITH<br />
THEIR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST. THE PRICE WE, AS EFFICIENT<br />
TRADERS, PAY FOR THIS CORRUPTION IS AT ONCE STARK AND<br />
MASSIVE : N ITS HUMAN DIMENSIONS. THE PR. ICE THE SUBSIDISERS<br />
PAY IS NO LESS MASSIVE, NO LESS HUMAN, BUT IT IS FAR LESS<br />
OBVIOUS. THE PRICE FOR THOSE COUNTRIES IS EXACTED NOT SO<br />
MUCH IN RURAL POVERTY BUT IN THE UNNECESSARILY REDUCED<br />
LIVING STANDARDS OF CITY DWELLERS AND IN THE JOBLESSNESS OF<br />
MORE THAI1 A MILLION PEOPLE.<br />
THE GROUP ASSEMBLED HERE HAS A MOST FORMIDABLE AND<br />
RESPONSIBLE3 TASK AHEAD OF IT. BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT IN<br />
TIME, BY WORKING TOGETHER, WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR<br />
COMMON GOAL. </p>
<p>4$<br />
6.<br />
FINALLY, 2 WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK MY<br />
TRADE MINISTXER, JOHN DAWKINS, FOR TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO<br />
CONVENE THIS MEETING. ITS TIMING IS IMPECCABLE. JOHN<br />
DAWKINS AND JOHN KERIN HAVE BEEN UNTIRING IN THEIR PURSUIT<br />
OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE REFORM. YOU WILL BE HEARING F4ROM THEM<br />
TOMORROW MOaNING AS THEY PRESENT IN MORE DETAIL AUSTRALIA'S<br />
THOUGHTS ON TACTICS AND OBJECTIVES FOR THE SEPTEMBER MEETING<br />
AND FOR THE NEW ROUND.<br />
I WISH YOU ALL WELL<br />
DAYS AND I HOPE YOU<br />
THE HOSPITALITY AND FOR YOUR DELIBERATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWO<br />
CAN FIND TIM4E OUT TO ENJOY AUSTRALIAN<br />
SUNSHINE HERE AT CAIRNS. </p>
