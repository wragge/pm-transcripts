make an impirtant contribution to the operation of the<br />
US Navy's chmmunication station at North ' Vest Cape.<br />
" I need hardly emphasise the significance for<br />
australia -anmd her Allies of the rapid and successful<br />
completion of this whole project. But in addition tu<br />
this defence significance, the Exmouth development will<br />
add an aspect of decentralisation to the many other<br />
projects now under way in WJestern Australia, bringing<br />
greater diversification and balance to the activities<br />
of the State."<br />
