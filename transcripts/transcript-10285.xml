28 March 197 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIE MINISTER<br />
THE BON. JOHN HOWARD MY<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, KRANJI CEMETERY, SINGAPORE<br />
E OE.<br />
JRNLST: Your thoughts on tbis place, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MIISTER: t<br />
It's always very moving to visit an Australian war cemetery because this is within<br />
viewing distance of the events, or the place where the events occurred that led to the<br />
fall of Singapore which was such-at enormous psychological, as well as military<br />
turning point in World War 2 and it is always important for Australians to remember<br />
the tremendous sacrifice. They were all so young, is the thing that always affects me<br />
when I visit a war cemetery, their ages, the late teens and early 20s in most cases and<br />
one is reminded of the terrible waste of war.<br />
JRNLST: You're of to China now. What are you hoping to achieve there?<br />
PRIME MINSTER;<br />
Well I hope to further build on what is already a good relationship. I believe that<br />
Australia and China have a lot in common for the fttue. We are obviously different<br />
societies and the= is no point in pretending otherwise but providing the relationship is<br />
built on mutual selfrespect and on an undurstanding that different societies can<br />
nonethelcss have complementary future goals We bave a good economic relationship<br />
with China We have a lot to offr. Australia Ls a riable supplierofraw matmials.<br />
Ther are a lot of Australian compnies that have established joint vertumca in China.<br />

senior men and women from Australian businesses are travelling with me so that's<br />
a token of the private sector's commitment to the Australian/ Chinese relationship<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, on the human rights issue, how prepared are you to be pragmatic on<br />
the point of...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think one has to be sensible. It's never possible to say, and I won't, that human<br />
rights issues won't come up in a bilateral relationship. On the other hand my style<br />
and my view is that one should use the methods of quiet discussion and dialogue.<br />
One shouldn't be overly hectoring or moralising. On the other hand, Australia has<br />
values within its own society that are very important to us and we of course don't take<br />
any backward steps in relation to the defence of those values within our own society.<br />
But one has to in all of these things have a mixture of pragmatism and idealism. The<br />
important thing in a relationship of this nature is to focus on those things that we have<br />
in common rather than allowing those thig? which may be a point of discord to<br />
contaminate the relationship.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, what is your Government going to do with the Russian aircraft with<br />
military equipment now stranded near Katherine?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the Defence Minister can probably talk to you in more detail about that, suffice it<br />
to say that after some discussion with the PNG Government and others, arangements<br />
were made for the aircraft to fly to the Northern Tcrritory and for the equipment to be<br />
unloaded. I think the details of what follows from that is really something that Mr<br />
McLachlan can fill you in on.<br />
JRNLST: Does it surprise you though, that this had happened? What was your reaction to<br />
hearing this great, big cargo load of...<br />
PRIME INISTER:<br />
No it didn't surprise me that it ended up in the Northern Territory, no.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, it's been reported that the Australian Government has decided to<br />
maintain Radio Australia as an English language speaking service only. What<br />
message does that send into the region 3.. </p>

PRIMR INISTER:<br />
I don't really watit to comment on thaL I have now been out of the counuy for a<br />
couple of days and it does relate very much to a domestic budget issue, although it<br />
does have overeas or international connotations. I think probably the preponlderance<br />
of it is a domestic budget issuec and therefore I won't talk about it.<br />
JRNLST: What message in Beijing will you be sending regarding Australia's security trcaty<br />
with the Unite States?<br />
PPXME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's a security treaty born~ e out of an independent judgemnet by Australia that it<br />
it in Austraija's best interest to have such a security alliance with the United States. It<br />
is not directed at China. It is not directed at anybody. It goes back a long way. The<br />
United States and Australia go back a very long way and no nation should see the<br />
security treaty between our country and this United States as being directed at it. We<br />
made an independent hard headed assessment of our own interests as we should<br />
always do with these things and we decided that we would have a security treaty with<br />
the United States in 195 1, only two years after the changes in China Ther was to<br />
relationship between the two. -It was forged in different circumstances and I will be<br />
mnaking it clear as the issue arises to the Chjnexe Govcrnmnt that the alliance<br />
between us and the Americans is not directed at them1it is the result of a bard headed<br />
Australian assessment of Australian national intersts.<br />
Prime Minister, with this hurnan rights issue, will it undermine your aspirations to<br />
play a regional role in Asia?<br />
PRIME MISTER:<br />
No. 3VB4LST: Prime Minister, whats your reaction to the appointment of a cartaker Prime Minister<br />
in Papua New Guinea?<br />
PRIM MONSTMR<br />
Well my view is tha if the constitutional processe of Papua New Guinea arc<br />
observed and mntanined,, which they appear to have been, that is a very positive step.<br />
It's not for me to give a running comnmitry on AWh sbould be in char in Papu<br />
New Guinea. RA= he, it is for me to speak of those thing in which Awbtalia has a<br />

<p>Fa roM28/ 03/ 9? 16: 46 Pg: 4<br />
Iegitimate interest, such as the previous pos ' sibility of the introduction of mercenaries<br />
and also to observe in general term how iniportant it is that the democratic process be<br />
observed. Papua New Guinea is a young country. It's only had independenco fbr 22<br />
yewrs and it's dne very well to preserve demnocracy amd I think all of us in Austalia<br />
should have an understanding of the difficulties of preserving that systera of<br />
goverrnent against a lot of regional pressures, a lot of fragmentary pressures so I<br />
think it's important that we respc what has been achieved axnd I will continue to<br />
monitor the situation and follow it extremely closely but it's a little unclear at the<br />
moment altho ugh it would appear as though a caretaker Prime Minister is emerging.<br />
XRNLST: Mrt Howard, Prime Minister Goh especially wants Australia to play a bigger role in<br />
the security and defence of this region. How do you see your role irt the region?<br />
PFRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we alrcady play a major role. We have a five power defence anrgement which<br />
of course involves Singapore and Malaysia and New Zealand and the United<br />
Kingdom. We of course have some close arrangeruents involving the training of the<br />
Singaporean defence personnel. We have a very big commnitmont to APEC which<br />
will, over time, provide greater economnic security for the region and of course out of<br />
economic security grows political security. The two are always linked and political<br />
instability is often the product of economic, denial and economic impoverishment so to<br />
the extent that we are participating with Singapore and other friendly nations in the<br />
area, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, we are building a far more secure and amicable;<br />
part of the world and I am very wall pleased with the relations between Au~ stralia and<br />
Singapore. We have a good open, confident, respectful relationship. Singaporeani<br />
people are very welcome in Australia and I am very pleased that the Singaporean<br />
Prime Minister has said that he will visit Australia soon and I look forward to<br />
welcoming himn and he will ccrtainly be welcomed as the Prime Mini= te of a very<br />
close ncighbour and a very fiendly ally.<br />
Thank you.<br />
