TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER. THE HON P. J. KEATING UP,<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, STATE GUEST HOUSE, JAKARTA, WEDNESDAY,<br />
27 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROFF COPY<br />
PM: Well, I will be very brief just to say that I have just concluded a meeting<br />
with President Soeharto which went for one and three quarter hours. I am<br />
pleased to say that all the time was taken up with matters of substance<br />
rather than any statement, any discussion about things, obvious, or With<br />
any other protocols. It was all about our mutual interests both bilatera,<br />
and multilateral and of course I will have the opportunity today of meeting<br />
other ministers in the government including the Foreign Minister to<br />
complete the rounds of discussions and dinner with President Soeharto<br />
and Mrs Soeharto this evening.<br />
The purpose of the visit is a working visit virtually one full business day<br />
stopover from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in<br />
Cyprus and it is I think an opportunity for me and I think also the President<br />
and other Ministers too recount the progress we have made since I visited<br />
here eighteen months ago. And anyway I regard it as a good opportunity<br />
and one certainly to be taken up.<br />
J: Did the President give you any indication he will attend the APEC Leaders<br />
Meeting?<br />
PMV: Well, we had a long discussion about APECabout what it means to the<br />
region, and the value it holds for countries like Indonesia and Australia<br />
and the importance of the Leaders Meeting in Seattle. One I think<br />
important thing about APEC is that it has been a principal to principal<br />
matter. That is APEC has developed in to this stage and certainly the last<br />
eighteen months on a principal to principal basis its not been developed<br />
by Foreign Ministries its been developed by Principals and therefore the<br />
instincts of leaders in this becomes particularly important because there is<br />
no road map for APEC it's all new ground. And therefore it relies upon the<br />
instinct of the players about how it goes and where it goes. Thars why the<br />
Seattle meeting will be important, its not just a routine meeting one which<br />
is going to put the sort of gloss upon the work which is done in the<br />
ministerial meeting. The ministerial meeting will be important but the </p>
<p>Leaders Meeting will be, I think, supremely important and therefore fte<br />
modalities of the meeting and its conclusions will be important now and<br />
you asked me about President Soeharto's attitude to hosting a meeting in<br />
1994, much of that depends upon the attitude of the leaders at the Seale<br />
summit. So I don't think any of us are seeking to make any assumptions<br />
about those things but to take this meeting on for what it is and-that is a<br />
substantial opportunity to clear our collective minds about the<br />
development of what's going to be a very significant grouping of countries<br />
and an open regional grouping of countries.<br />
J: Does President Soeharto indicate that he doesn't want to fast track<br />
APEC?<br />
PMV: No, the thing is what his view* is as my view has been, that is he has<br />
tested out peoples opinions, you try and get a feel of the issues and as<br />
things change you move it forward. Now you know the conventional<br />
wisdom for instance not so long ago that China wouldn't this meeting that<br />
conventional wisdom has proven to be untrue as I believed it would be<br />
untrue. China having attended puts a different construction again on parts<br />
of the meeting in terms of its comprehension. So one absorbs the various<br />
changes, takes them into account and then tries to move the agenda on<br />
and in that sense we are all taking notice of the changes which occur<br />
along the road in the development of APEC. And understanding that there<br />
has to be each particular block go into place for it to develop and that<br />
certainly is President Soeharto's view but it is most definitely my view.<br />
J: Did you discuss your hopes for APEC to become a community?<br />
PMV: Well, that Is the very essence of it, it's not a matter of my hopes versus his<br />
or what he thinks, that's the essence of it. It's a community of open<br />
regionalism. The thing it is not a bloc to the extent that a bloc is regarded<br />
as an exclusive economic zone or an exclusive economic region this does<br />
not have exclusivity about it, it's an open regional structure as you have<br />
heard me say so often it is hopefully a GATT plus structure so we have<br />
the GATT into place then we overlay APEC across the top of it, but of<br />
course obviously were GATT to fail APEC would then have an even more<br />
obvious advantage in the sense that you are bringing together the two<br />
largest economies in the world with China and with all of the countries of<br />
South East Asia and putting them into a multi-lateral structure. I mean any<br />
structure which multi-lateralises the interests of the United States and<br />
rnulti-laterlises the interests of the-product in Japan and as a bonus China,<br />
in structure with the rest of South East Asia is of course a huge advance<br />
in the removal of impediments to an increase in the velocity of trade and<br />
investment and that's what APEC should be seen to be about. I mean<br />
journalists all too often try and see it as a bloc here and a bloc there, it is<br />
all simple stuff black and white. It's not that, it's not. This is not win and<br />
lose; this is win and win. I mean this is a structure which has a lot<br />
sophistication about it and therefore those of us who are trying to put this<br />
together understand what it holds. But also understands what each<br />
member country or State will want to secure from it. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, are you still as confident now as you were in Cyprus that<br />
APEC will take the first step of becoming an economic community at the<br />
meeting in Seattle?<br />
PM: That is what I was just asked, that is what I've just answered.<br />
J: But, are you as confident now as you were then?<br />
PM: Well, of course I am that Is the whole essence of it. Developing APEC<br />
beyond an information sharing thing where it started, a sort of mini OECD,<br />
to something that has some executive functions about it. That is.<br />
something which is looking at the development of an open, co-operative<br />
regional trading zone or structure that is the essence of the change.<br />
This is a very big change, but that is the essence of it. That question was<br />
appropriate nine months, or a year ago, even eighteen months ago.<br />
J: Can I ask you about GATT, following your success in getting the<br />
Commonwealth to issue such a strong declaration, given President<br />
Soeharto's position as head of the non-aligned movement are you hoping<br />
for a similar sort of statement from him about GATT?<br />
PM: Well, the President and I had quite a discussion this morning about the<br />
GATT believing it to be supremely important, believing that the countries<br />
of the south will genuinely secure a lot of market access from GATT. As I<br />
said at CHOGM about billion worth of value to developing countries.<br />
particularly agncultural producers coming from the GATT which is equal to<br />
more than the bi-lateral aid which comes from developed countries to<br />
developing countries now. So, there is a huge benefit in there and I think<br />
the significance of Indonesia in not just its size, but the fact that President<br />
Soeharto Is chairman of the non-aligned movement will not be lost on any<br />
of the APEC attendees in terms of anything the President might say about<br />
a world trading order and the importance of the GATT.<br />
J. Prime Minister, how important do you think it will be in furthering the pace<br />
of change of APEC in having Indonesia as the chair?<br />
PM: What matters to APEC is the decisions that the Heads of Governments<br />
take and leaders tako in Seattle. There are two logical points from hare<br />
thore is the ministerial meeting and its important work; there is the<br />
consideration of the Eminent Persons Group report and then there Is the<br />
leaders meeting and its conclusions. They are the next logical steps in<br />
the development of APEC.<br />
J: So there is no doubt in your mind then, that President Soeharto will<br />
attend?<br />
PM' No, I expect President Soeharto to be there and I think that he will do as<br />
he has always done competently and well and that is not just represent his<br />
own country's interest, but countries with similar interests to Indonesia. </p>
<p>J: A few months ago you spoke about APEC becoming a community how<br />
do you describe the difference between an APEC Community and the only<br />
model known to most people the European Community?<br />
PM: The European Community has a formal treaty structure and it already has<br />
open borders and no tariffs between them. This is not true of this ares of<br />
the world. What I think APEC portends is half the worlds GOP being<br />
allowed to move more freely between member states so that by takiig<br />
away impediments to trade and investment and harmonising standards:<br />
we can actually pick up the velocity of trade and investment in this part of<br />
the world which is already going quite quickly and the fact that the United<br />
States is interested in this and in fact NAFTA would become, if you like, a<br />
sub-group of APEC as Mexico or Canada trade with the United States into<br />
the region. These things too will mean that not only is the velocity of trade<br />
in north and south Asia picked up, but you end up with, of course, north<br />
America involved as well. So, it becomes a very significant promoter of<br />
faster development and faster growth.<br />
J: Prime Minister, in your assessment, is President Soeharto in step with you<br />
over APEC, does he share your grand vision or is he a little bit more<br />
cautious?<br />
PM: Right the way through this I mean from its earliest stages in the<br />
development, I first tested these views with President Bush in Australia in<br />
January 1992 and then after that in a series of meetings with the Prime<br />
Minister of Japan, the President of South Korea, but before then of course<br />
though, after President Bush next was President Soeharto. So, in a way<br />
there has been a recognition as we've gone through these discussions of<br />
the potential which APEC holds and each time I found on the part of<br />
President Soeharto, clarity of thought, recognition of opportunities and a<br />
willingness to go the next step. I found that exactly the same today.<br />
J: What is Australia's expectation when Indonesia chairs APEC group next<br />
year?<br />
PM: I answered that earlier. There has to be decisions taken by the leaders<br />
themselves about where they want to see any regulatory or formality<br />
arising in APEC and so both the President and I see an obvious<br />
sequential thing here a sequencing which is both important in terms of<br />
underlying where as a group the leaders want to see it going and giving<br />
everybody the opportunity to be able to put a view about how it should go.<br />
APEC has come a long way in a relatively short time mainly because<br />
process has been observed, processed matters getting the steps well and<br />
truly discussed and into place before the next step is taken.<br />
J. Prime Minister, did you say anything on human rights concerns?<br />
PMV: No, the only thing I said to the President was that there is concern in the<br />
United States about this subject and the United States in proposing<br />
membership of APEC and the way in which it is, is prepared to be<br />
subjected to the disciplines of a multi-lateral structure. in other words it is<br />
giving something, it is giving something to the common good. In some </p>
<p>way it is curbing its capacity for uni-lateral or bilateral solutions to its<br />
problems and if it curbs its capacity and gives something way towards a<br />
greater good, it will expect something in return and that is true of every<br />
country that belongs to APEC. There are American concerns about some<br />
of these things, as there have been Australian concerns expressed often<br />
and I hope effectively. I think these expressions are not lost on Indonesia.<br />
he understands the value of membership of a multi-lateral body like this<br />
and I think it is because of that sense of co-operation which Australia has<br />
had with Indonesia, which the US is having with Indonesia which<br />
encourages a more co-operative attitude within Indonesia. And this is part<br />
of the point many of us have made over the past a policy of nonengagement<br />
one that does not look at the totality of interests or<br />
relationships is not an effective policy.<br />
J: Australia and Indonesia have moved closer together in defence relations<br />
in recent years. Did you discuss defence and if so what was the topic?<br />
PM: One of the things I am very happy about in the development of our bilateral<br />
relations in the last eighteen months is the fact that we have<br />
stepped up defence co-operation quite substantially and there are joint<br />
exercises which have been completed in terms of ground forces and there<br />
are going to be other joint exercises with the other forces as welt in the<br />
near future. So, we will see from the most spare defence co-operation<br />
which we have had in the last eighteen months or so a very substantial<br />
shift in a co-operative relationship in defence going to those four<br />
structures and this will also spill over into other things such as training<br />
intelligence et cetera.<br />
J-Is there any concern that Australian journalists are still denied access to<br />
Indonesia'?<br />
PM: I thought that the ABC was here and I think the Sydney Morning Herald is<br />
here.<br />
J: A Sydney Morning Herald journalist was deported a couple of months ago.<br />
PM; They Sydney Morning Herald ( Fairfax) is here in an institutional sense and<br />
the ABC is here and our other commercial networks are able to be here, I<br />
don't think the story, the general line you're putting has force.<br />
J. Was the issue of nuclear co-operation between Australia and Indonesia<br />
discussed?<br />
PM: No, it wasn't mentioned.<br />
J: One more question on the APEC discussions, did you discuss ways in<br />
which Malaysia might be brought into the process more the APEC<br />
process?<br />
PM: The President and I are both conscious of Malaysia's views about APEC<br />
and its fear that in being part of such a multi-lateral structure will be<br />
subjected to pressures that it might not otherwise. For my part, I put the </p>
<p>view to the President, as I did to Prime Minister MahAhir that uni-latermi<br />
action by major countries against Malaysia or anyone is far more<br />
threatening and disruptive as is bi-lateral relationships that is, bilateral<br />
trading deals where smaller countries are given offers they can't refusie by<br />
larger countries, is far more constraining and less likely to take the<br />
interests of those countries into account than the disciplines of a multilateral<br />
structure are. That is the essential point of difference we have with<br />
the Prime Minister of Malaysia in terms of the analysis of APEC. But<br />
again, countries have got the right to make their own attitudes about these<br />
things and I think for my part we have put our view about the benefits to<br />
Malaysia of APEC and I think these have probably well been put within<br />
ASEAN. I think both President Soeharto and I are sensitive to Prime<br />
Minister Mahathirs views and Malaysia's interest, It is just that certainly I<br />
think, and I would be surprised if the President doesn't think this, that a<br />
multi-lateral structure multi-lateralising the interests of the United Statesand<br />
Japan vis a vis those of Malaysia are far better for Malaysia than bilateral<br />
structures or worse, unilateral action so the thesis that Malaysia Wit<br />
be buffeted more in a multi-lateral structure I don't think stands up to<br />
argument.<br />
J: Prime Minister, did President Soeharto give you any indication as to<br />
whether he would take any initiative to add to the pressure to get a<br />
Uruguay Round conclusion by December or would it stay apart of this<br />
process?<br />
PM: I think Indonesia has played a role and I think the non-aligned movement<br />
have played a role and he has played a role as chairman of that in<br />
expressing their views about a successful conclusion of the GATT. So,<br />
Indonesia is doing that itself as a nation, it is doing it as chair of the nonaligned<br />
movement arfd I think the President would also see the leaders<br />
meeting in Seattle as another opportunity for an expression by the leaders<br />
about the need for a world trade overlay. A successful ending of the<br />
GATT being the best way that all countries can make a contribution to<br />
world trade and growth and a growth in incomes and employment world<br />
wide. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
