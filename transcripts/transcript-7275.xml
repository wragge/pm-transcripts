PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 JANUARY 1988<br />
Caucus has today elected Senator Peter cook and Mr Gary Punch to<br />
the Ministry.<br />
Senator Cook is to be appointed Minister for Resources.<br />
Mr Punch is to be appointed Minister for the Arts and<br />
Territories. Mr Duffy will join the Cabinet retaining his current<br />
appointment as Minister for Trade Negotiations.<br />
Senator Richardson is to be appointed Minister for the Arts,<br />
Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and will also<br />
join the Cabinet.<br />
Associated with these changes, I have reviewed machinery of<br />
government and ministerial arrangements.<br />
There will be no change in the basic machinery of government nor<br />
any adjustments to the Administrative Arrangements Order.<br />
The new ministerial appointments described below are, where<br />
formal action is necessary, being recommended to the<br />
Governor-General.<br />
In making other changes, the objective has been to recognise<br />
areas of special priority and workload, and the experience and<br />
skills of Ministers.<br />
one area of special priority, where major policy changes are<br />
underway and which will be of particular importance over the next<br />
few years, is care of the aged. Other programs in the Community<br />
Services and Health portfolio are also closely associated with<br />
the Government's objectives in relation to social justice which I<br />
have already indicated require priority attention in our third<br />
term. I have therefore decided to appoint Mr Morris minister for<br />
Housing and Aged Care in Dr Blewett's portfolio. He will assist<br />
Dr Blewett generally in the portfolio and have primary<br />
responsibility for housing programs, residential programs for the<br />
aged, the Home and Community Care Program, ' the office for the<br />
Aged, pharmaceutical benefits and therapeutic goods. 0: 03928 </p>
<p>Mr Morris will also be appointed as Minister Assisting the Prime<br />
minister, with particular responsibility-for the Bicentenary, and<br />
will assist me generally in my portfolio.<br />
Senator Cook is to be appointed Minister for Resources assuming<br />
the duties previously carried by Mr Morris.<br />
Mr Punch is to be appointed minister for the Arts and Territories<br />
( excluding Antarctica), in Senator Richardson's portfolio.<br />
Senator Richardson will have particular responsibility for the<br />
environment, tourism and sport.<br />
Aboriginal affairs ( including the Department, the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission an -d other statutory bodies) will move to<br />
Mr Dawkins' portfolio with Mr Hand as minister. Mr Hand will<br />
also be responsible for those -aspects of the Aboriginal<br />
Employment Development Program administered by Mr Dawkins'<br />
Department and other appropriate Aboriginal education programs,<br />
as minister assisting Mr Dawkins. This change in ministerial<br />
arrangements reflects the Government's belief that education and<br />
employment programs are of central importance to improving the<br />
position of Aboriginal Australians.<br />
Mr Duncan will move to Mr Dawkins, portfolio as minister for<br />
Employment and Education Services, with responsibility for a<br />
range of employment and training programs, CeS operations, the<br />
Youth Bureau and student allowance delivery.<br />
Mr Holding will move to Senator Evans' portfolio as Minister for<br />
Transport and Communications Support, in which capacity he will<br />
assist the Minister generally ( including representing the<br />
portfolio in the House of Representatives) and have specific<br />
responsibilities for particular areas of the portfolio including<br />
road and rail transport. He will continue as Minister Assisting<br />
the Treasurer.<br />
Because of the very heavy workload in the Transport and<br />
Communications portfolio, I have in addition appointed Senator<br />
Ray as Minister assisting Senator Evans. He wil1 retain his<br />
primary duties as Minister for Home Affairs in the Administrative<br />
Services portfolio. Senator Ray will assist the Minister for<br />
Transport and Communications in specific areas of the portfolio<br />
referred to him from time to time, such as shipping and<br />
waterfront matters.<br />
In addition to her present responsibilities, Senator Reynolds is<br />
to be Minister assisting me for the Status of Women.<br />
Attached is a Ministry listing showing the new Ministry including<br />
representational arrangements together with a more detailed<br />
listing of the new Ministerial responsibilities, which may be<br />
subject to further adjustment as to details following discussion<br />
between Ministers concerned.<br />
The third attachment shows the revised Cabinet Committee<br />
membership associated with the changes. 003929 </p>
