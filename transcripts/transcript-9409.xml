PRIME MINISTER 98/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY CHILEAN PRESIDENT FREI<br />
I am very pleased to announce that the President of the Republic of Chile,<br />
His Excellency, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, will make an informal visit to Australia on<br />
12-13 November on his way to the APEC leaders' meeting in Indonesia. I will be<br />
meeting the President on Saturday 12 November in Sydney.<br />
The visit by President Frei will provide an opportunity for us to discuss our common<br />
goals in APEC as well as other matters of mutual interest, including the growing trade<br />
and investment links between Australia and Chile.<br />
Australian trade with Chile has grown around 35 per cent in the past decade with<br />
exports in 1993-94 valued at $ 111 million. Australia is one of the largest foreign<br />
investors in Chile with total investment of $ 704 million. Australian investment in Chile<br />
is expected to exceed $ 1 billion in the next few years. Over 24,000 Australians were<br />
born in Chile.<br />
I warmly welcome President Frei to Australia and look forward to my discussions with<br />
him. CANBERRA 8 November 1994 </p>
