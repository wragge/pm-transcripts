    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and Federal Minister for Health and Ageing today met with local health professionals in Launceston to discuss a range of frontline issues and the Government's planned $15 million Integrated Care Centre.</p>
<p>The $15 million Launceston Integrated Care Centre (ICC) is part of the Australian Government's $50 million investment in Tasmanian Health Services.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to working with the Tasmanian Government to provide first class health care to the families of Launceston.</p>
<p>A vital part of this commitment is our investment in the Launceston ICC.</p>
<p>To gain the best outcome for local families it is essential we engage and have input from the experts - the local doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and related health organisations. That is what today's discussions are all about.</p>
<p>Launceston's ICC will employ an innovative model of patient care that enables health professionals to work in a team environment  -  better linking hospitals, community health services and doctors.</p>
<p>Importantly the services provided by the new Launceston ICC will reflect the specific health care needs of the local community.</p>
<p>The ICC will house a renal dialysis unit from Launceston General Hospital.</p>
<p>Other health services available at Launceston ICC may include:</p>
<p>     * Mental health;</p>
<p>     * Outpatient chemotherapy;</p>
<p>     * Allied health services such as physiotherapy, dieticians, and podiatry; and</p>
<p>     * Possible after-hours GP services.</p>
<p>Other commitments from the Rudd Government for Tasmania include:</p>
<p>     * $15 million to establish GP Super Clinics at: Devonport, Burnie and Bellerive and Sorrell;</p>
<p>     * $10 million for the Tasmanian Patient Transport Initiative;</p>
<p>     * $7.7 million towards an additional radiation oncology unit in the North or North-West;</p>
<p>     * $3.5 million for a PET cancer scanner at the Royal Hobart Hospital  -  the first in Tasmania;</p>
<p>     * North-West Tasmania and Launceston General Hospital are both locations for expanded Medicare-eligible Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) services;</p>
<p>     * Tasmanians will also benefit from the Government's $300m investment in improving the transition from hospital to aged care;</p>
<p>     * $8.1 million for Tasmanian hospitals to deliver an additional 895 elective surgery procedures during 2008; and</p>
<p>     * Nurse incentive payments for 146 nurses to re-enter the workforce in Tasmania.</p>
