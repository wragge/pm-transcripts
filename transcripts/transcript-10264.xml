March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
LAUNCH OF OFFICIAL LOGO FOR<br />
COMMONWEALTH GAMES<br />
e o e<br />
Thank you very much to my colleagues Michael Knight and Warwick Smith; to Ray<br />
Godwin, the President of the Commonwealth Games Association and particular<br />
welcome also to Gary Pembarth and Alan Ridge, the managing directors of the two<br />
companies that were particularly acknowledged for their sponsorship. I just want to<br />
say as patron of the association how delighted I am to be associated with this formal<br />
launch of the logo and in a sense the formal part of Australia's campaign for the<br />
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998.<br />
And I particularly acknowledge also the presence of the Consul General for Malaysia<br />
that this is the first time that Malaysia has hosted the Games and the first time that an<br />
Asian city has been the host of the Commonwealth Games is a very special thing in<br />
itself Australia of course in 1994 surpassed itself as far as Commonwealth Games<br />
performance was concerned but I know that the determination and the competitive<br />
spirit of Australia's sportsmen and women will mean that we will be endeaviouring<br />
with every sinew available for the competing athletes to do even better than that when<br />
they go to Malaysia in 1998.<br />
It is important that as a lead up to the Olympic Games here in Sydney in the Year<br />
2000, it is important that in preparing for those games we don't in any way relax our<br />
efforts to maintain the splendid performance of Australian athletes over the years at the<br />
Commonwealth Games. Although the similarities between the two games are obvious<br />
in so many ways, there aer some characteristics of the Commonwealth Games that<br />
mark them apart from the Olympic Games and give them some special features and<br />
some special characteristics. The well-known description of them is the Friendly<br />
Games illustrates that particular character and that particular trait of the competitive<br />
spirit in which the athletes take place. </p>
<p>I am delighted to note the addition of so many new sports, new in the sense of them<br />
being new for Commonwealth Games participation but certainly not new in the sense<br />
that any of those sports are in any way unfamiliar to Australians. It is impossible to be<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia without I suppose virtually every week of one's<br />
existence to be reminded of the central place sport plays in the lives and indeed the<br />
very ethic of all those things that binds our nation together. Sport, I think, and I look<br />
at these things very positively does bring out some of the best features of the<br />
Australian spirit. It brings out that commitment of body and soul to achieving an<br />
objective. It brings out the capacity of people to play in a team, it brings out the<br />
capacity of people to stretch their talents to the absolute limit and it also enables us to<br />
put on display to the rest of world whether it is here in Australia or our teams<br />
competing overseas those special characteristics that define Australians as being a very<br />
distinctive and a very attractive group of people.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen I want to wish all of those associated with the Commonwealth<br />
Games effort, the very best of good fortune. I want to take the opportunity through<br />
this luncheon on behalf of the Government to thank so many people in the<br />
Commonwealth Games movement who give up their time without any reward, without<br />
any recompense, but because they are dedicated to particular sports and they are<br />
dedicated to ensuring that Australia always puts on the best possible representation.<br />
Sometimes at gatherings like this, we can forget that sporting bodies all around<br />
Australia have their genisis in those local communities where citizens come together<br />
for no reward but simply because they love a particular sport and they are prepared to<br />
devote hours and weeks and months and years of their time ensuring that people who<br />
ultimately end up representing Australia, ultimately become household words as far as<br />
Australian sports loving is concerned, that those people have their opportunities.<br />
So I congratulate all of those associated with today's lunch. I thank the sponsors. I<br />
commend the efforts of the Commonwealth Games association, I congratulate all of<br />
those who brought past glory and past credit to Australia's sporting reputation and for<br />
those who will ultimately be chosen to represent our country in Kuala Lumpur in 1998<br />
I wish them well.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen in concluding my remarks, I know my formal duty is to launch<br />
the new logo and I am therefore very pleased to officially launch the new<br />
Commonwealth Games logo which will be a very recognisable logo as we lead our<br />
team into Kuala Lumpur.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
