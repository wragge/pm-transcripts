The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, has begun phone discussions with the world's leaders including a call this morning with the President of the United States, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard spoke to President Obama at about 9:00am this morning for around 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The conversation was productive and very warm and reaffirmed the strength of our countries' longstanding alliance and partnership.</p>
<p>The US alliance is the foundation stone of Australia's security policy. Ms Gillard said her aim is to maintain and strengthen that policy under her leadership.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard and President Obama discussed the two countries' commitment to Afghanistan. She indicated that our commitment will remain unchanged and that she fully supports the current deployment and the plan for Australia to lead the Provincial Reconstruction team (civilian) effort in Oruzgan province.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said that Australians have highest respect and regard for President Obama and that she and the President share a respect and admiration for the people they represent.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard also expressed her regret at not being able to attend the G20 meeting in Toronto at the weekend and that the Deputy Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, will attend in her absence.</p>
<p>She also said that President Obama and his family would be welcome in Australia at any time as a guest of the Australian people.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard spoke to New Zealand Prime Minister John Key yesterday afternoon and expressed regret at not being able to address the New Zealand Parliament next week.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to speak to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and new British Prime Minister David Cameron later today.</p>
