_ AUST ALIA~<br />
PRIME MINISTER June 1974<br />
Press Statement No. 257<br />
MAJOR DEVELOPMENT AT PORT MORESBY AIRPORT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, M. P.,<br />
announced today that a $ 7.6 million contract had been awarded f or<br />
major development works at the Port Moresby airport.<br />
Mr Whitlan said the work included construction of<br />
a new runway, taxiways, parking apron and associated works. The<br />
project was being wholly financed by the Australian Government as an<br />
aid project for the Papua New Guinea Government, and was the<br />
culmination of close co-operation between the two governments<br />
on all aspects of the airport development.<br />
The contract had been awarded to Hornibrook/ Curtaii,<br />
a joint venture formed by two companies based in Papua New Guinea.<br />
It was expected that work would start this financial year, and that<br />
the project would be completed by August, 1976.<br />
Mr Whitlam said the new runway would be 2,750m ( 9,000 ft)<br />
long, capable of handling fully laden Boeing 727-200 and 707 aircraft,<br />
and also the larger Boeing 747 aircraft for viable and infrequent<br />
operations. The present runway, which was designed for Constellation<br />
type aircraft, was now becoming uneconomic to maintain as a heavy<br />
duty pavement. The Prime Minister said the project had been designed<br />
by the Australian Government Department of Housing and Construction's<br />
Port Moresby office, which would also supervise construction.<br />
