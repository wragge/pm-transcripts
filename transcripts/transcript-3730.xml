QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. ARTHUR GAVSHON, DIPLOMATIC EDITOR,<br />
ASSOCIATED PRESS<br />
1. In the aftermath of the American withdrawal from Indochina<br />
there have been expressions of doubt about the credibility of<br />
US security commitments. How do you foresee Australia's defence<br />
requirements and the continued validity of the ANZUS and SEATO<br />
treaty arrangements?<br />
ANSWER: There has never been any question in Australia<br />
of the validity of ANZUS. It is more than<br />
years since it was signed and the friendship and<br />
co-operation which underlie it had their origins<br />
in World War Two. SEATO is a different matter,<br />
it has very little political relevance or military<br />
relevance. Australia's long term defence requirements<br />
are based on an expert stragetic assessment which<br />
is constantly under review. There is no likelihood<br />
of any external threat to Australia's own security<br />
in the foreseeable future. The Stability of the<br />
region is more difficult to predict but on the<br />
whole I am optomistic.<br />
2. There has been some emphasis within the United States on<br />
the need for American military aid to go primarily to those allied<br />
nations which help themselves. In your view does Australia now<br />
qualify completely with that requirement? And do you see any<br />
merit in the suggestions of some authorities that Australia should<br />
perhaps enter the nuclear weapons league by building tactical<br />
weapons for the defence of your continent?<br />
ANSWER: Australia has never received American military aid,<br />
though, of course, we have been war time allies. The Australian<br />
Government is resolutely opposed to the production of her<br />
nuclear weapons and indeed, to the production or testing in any<br />
environment of neclear weapons by any other country. We have<br />
ratified the NPT and have constantly urged others to do likewise.<br />
As I have pointed out this week it is regretable that only<br />
17 of the 34 Commonwealth countries have ratified the NPT.<br />
3. Your government has been portrayed as favouring a<br />
" zone of peace" in the Indian Ocean but opposing a " nuclear-free<br />
zone" in the Pacific. If this is a fair portrayal how do you<br />
reconcile the seeming contradiction?<br />
ANSWER: Certainly we have supported the Sri Lanka proposal<br />
for a free zone in the Indian Ocean. The idea of<br />
a nuclear free zone in the Pacific, while unexceptionable<br />
in principle would be exceedingly difficult to implement. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Pacific covers a vast area and the number<br />
of states, within it, or on its borders is very<br />
large. At least one nation is still using it<br />
for nuclear experiments. I might say, however<br />
that Australia has vigorously opposed French<br />
nuclear testing in the Pacific. I am happy that<br />
France has now apparently decided to cease<br />
atmospheric tests.<br />
4. Soon you will be visiting President Ford and Secretary of<br />
State Kissinger in Washington. How in this period of reappraisal<br />
in the United States do you envisage the development of<br />
Canberra-Washington relations?<br />
ANSWER: I look forward to a period of much closer co-operation<br />
and understanding. The American nation has just<br />
come through one of its darkest and traumatic<br />
experiences since the Civil War. The lifting<br />
of that shadow will surely bring America closer<br />
in spirt to her allies in the region.<br />
Do you agree the balance of pwer in Asia now appears tilted<br />
toward the Communist countries? As you see it are the Soviets<br />
or the Chinese People's Republic the main beneficiaries?<br />
ANSWER: After three decades of war I think the main<br />
beneficiaries will be the Vietnamese people.<br />
I don't think it is realistic to talk in simple<br />
terms about the balance of power in Asia.<br />
This is not a confrontation between China and<br />
the Soviet Union, anymore than it was a confrontation<br />
between world communism and western democracy.<br />
It is largely because we saw the conflict in those<br />
terms that the war raged so long at such terrible<br />
cost.<br />
6. Is Australia ready for trade and friendship with the four<br />
regimes of Indochina as it has shown itself to be with the CPR?<br />
And is your government ready to co-operate with those regimes in<br />
the reconstruction of their war-damaged lands?<br />
ANSWER: Certainly. We have made that clear since the signing<br />
of the Paris agreement. As a belligerent nation<br />
in South Vietnam, though admittedly under a previous<br />
administration, Australia has a special obligation<br />
to contribute to the task of reconstruction. </p>
<p>1 0 -3-<br />
7. Some of the nations of. South East Asia and the Pacific<br />
are moving toward the extension of their zone of " peace, freedom<br />
and neutrality" by hopefully bringing the Indochinese peoples<br />
and Burma into it. Would Australia offer its political support<br />
for such a project.<br />
ANSWER: I think so. The details of this proposal are<br />
still uncertain. But in general we are in<br />
favour of such movements.<br />
8. Do you anticipate the early reunion of North and South<br />
Vietnam? And do you share the view of many authorities who<br />
expect the Indochinese states, under Vietnamese leadership, to<br />
concentrate on reconstruction rather than to expand their<br />
influence and power?<br />
ANSWER: Reunion would, we hope be a logical process.<br />
How long it takes would depend on the governments<br />
concerned. I would certainly expect the<br />
Indochinese states to concentrate on reconstruction.<br />
For the moment they have very little choice. </p>
