    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I will travel to Port Moresby to attend the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) Leaders’ Meeting.</p>
<p>The PIF is the pre-eminent regional organisation in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Australia has been an active participant in the PIF since its inception in 1971.</p>
<p>The Forum underpins regional cooperation. It facilitates greater economic engagement and social development.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s PIF is <em>Strengthening Connections to Enhance Pacific Regionalism</em>.</p>
<p>While in Papua New Guinea, I will host a breakfast with members of the Australia-PNG Business Council to further encourage commercial ties between our nations.</p>
<p>I also look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Peter O’Neill.</p>
<p>It will be an opportunity to congratulate PNG on its 40th anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>9 September 2015 </p>
