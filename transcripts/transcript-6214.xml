TRANSCRIPT OF PM TO WINE-GROWERS IN THE SWAN VALLEY, 28 SEPTEIIBER 1983<br />
a situation that may involve some difficulties in respect of<br />
some of the decisions which we had to take in the recent Budget<br />
and it's a measure of your attitude that you have been prepared<br />
subsequent awards and I do say thank you very much to you and you<br />
Peter for providing your premises and those who organised today.<br />
As Gavin has said unfortunately we do have a very tight schedule,<br />
but I appreciate the opportunity of spending a little bit of time<br />
with you. I won't take up too much because I think it is much<br />
more important that I listen to you than that I speak to you.<br />
There are a few things I would like to say which I hope you<br />
understand as being relevant to the position which we find ourselves<br />
in today.<br />
When we came to office on 5 March we inherited an economic<br />
situation which was very very much worse than we had been led to<br />
believe by our predecessors. You have read about this, bu[ I<br />
must remind you of the fact that when we went into the campaign<br />
in February of this year, we were told by the previous government<br />
that the deficit situation that the incoming government would be<br />
operating in in 1983/ 84 would be about $ 6 billion. Now, that<br />
is a very large deficit for any government to have". to operate in.<br />
We were somewhat apprehensive about it. We knew that we were<br />
going to have to do something to stimulate the economy which<br />
would mean a vast increase in the deficit.<br />
The day after we were elected to office we found from the officials<br />
who knew the facts, what the previous government had not told us<br />
about it wasn't $ 6 billion deficit that we as a Government were*<br />
facing, but a $ 9.6 billion an extra $ 3.6 billion.<br />
Now I don't want to talk in economic jargon to you, the language<br />
of professional but I do want to ask you to understand what<br />
that meant for a government coming in who wanted to try and look<br />
after the interests of all Australians. Now, if we had operated<br />
on that Budget of $ 9.6 billion and gently tried to do something<br />
else to try and get the economy moving, then all Australians would<br />
have suffered all Australians not just people here by one<br />
particular decision, but everyone would have suffered because<br />
there would have been an inevitable pressure on interest rates<br />
which would have sent interest rates very much higher and that<br />
would have affected wine growers, trade unions, home owners,<br />
farmers you name it. </p>
<p>Now, we weren't prepared to go along on that basis. I<br />
particularly want to say to you that if a government is going<br />
to bring that deficit down and avoid those problems for<br />
everyone including people like yourselves, then decisions have<br />
to be taken. You don't get rid of a deficit like that by<br />
simply sitting at your ( iesk in Canberra and saying " oh bother,<br />
I wish it would go away". You have got to make decisions and<br />
there are two sets of decisions that you take if you are going<br />
to bring that deficit down.... quickly increase in interest<br />
rates. ( inaudible)<br />
You have got to make some decisions which are going to involve<br />
raising more revenue and on the other hand you make some<br />
decisions which cut down on some existing programs.<br />
They are the only boundaries you have got. The only thing that<br />
we have if we were going to try and do the things which are going<br />
to give the best result for all Australians. We like to have to<br />
do some of the things that are necessary, but we had to impose<br />
some increased charges. We had to<br />
I want to say this to you. In the result, the Budget that was<br />
brought down by our Government, read to the House by Paul Keating<br />
on 23 August, was without question, ( inaudible)<br />
It was the best received Budget in recent memory and it was<br />
well received because generally people, including those who<br />
probably have to suffer some impost-that they would rather not<br />
have done, realise that in the event that taking our action will.<br />
bring the deficit down. That's going to be the result.<br />
Now we haven't had to sit there and say we think this is what<br />
will happen. We have done it and already there. Since we brought<br />
down the Budget interest rates have not risen as . they would have<br />
done if we hadn't acted in the way we did, but infact interest<br />
rates are coming down. The fact of that reduction in interest<br />
rates which are coming down largely because of the actions that<br />
we put, mean that people like yourselves, people round the place,<br />
are better off.<br />
Now, before you try and save your money, if you are going to<br />
get that result, you're going to get a position where interest<br />
rates are not going to rise, but in fact, as they have, fall<br />
had to make decisions to produce that result. We have done<br />
that. You benefit. All Australians have benefitted and will<br />
continue to benefit from that.<br />
Now, let me give you that background by way of explaining that<br />
a number of decisions have had to be taken to produce that result.<br />
Now, I want to say to you straightforwardly that when you are<br />
drawing up a Budget you are faced eventually ( inaudible)<br />
with those decisions which cover a whole range of departments<br />
we reach decisions have to be taken about items to the benefit<br />
of everyone. </p>
<p>It was put to us I come now directly to the question that<br />
was of some concern and I understand it was of some concern to<br />
you. We were faced wich evidence impartially from government<br />
officials people who were conccrned with the ( inaudible)<br />
of the revenue. We were faced with a problem of substitution<br />
in industry and they know which could only be met cffectively<br />
by the imposition of the excise on grape spirits.<br />
In this case, not because we wanted co make unnecessary problems,<br />
for Australians, in this case we made that decision in respect<br />
of the $ 3 increase. Now, once we had made that decision that<br />
was in the Budget we had representations made to us that in<br />
fact this was going to impose burdens which : were simply not going<br />
to ( inaudible) with the southern areas a crippling nature.<br />
Now I indicated straightforwardly we did not intend that as<br />
a seriously we had the represeanations made to us. We looked<br />
at the other alternatives raised facing this issue consistent<br />
with our commitment that there had to be some ( inaudible)<br />
in the community so that we could make sure that we didn't have<br />
rising interest rates which would produce the better results that<br />
I referred to<br />
We obviously, as a Government, had to depend upon the<br />
representations that were made to us. We obviously can't<br />
And as Gavin has said, the representations that were made to us<br />
these were somewhat loaded in respect of the larger interests,<br />
particularly those who had raised the standard in the area of<br />
table wines.<br />
VWhen I was listening to the representations that were made, what<br />
particularly John Kerin, our outstanding Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, had to say. we reached a decision where we may be able<br />
to meet a large part of the concern by reducing that excise and<br />
that is what we did.<br />
I am conscious I don't try and walk away from the fact I am<br />
conscious that that creates some problems and I am going to<br />
say this to you<br />
Firstly, that I think that others like yourselves perhaps aren't<br />
( inaudible) by the larger representations which governments<br />
ahnadv e shtoo rtta ktiem e abI ohaardv e agnodt htheraet Ii s wwohuyld plairkteic utola rhleya r ind irtheec tllyim firtoedm<br />
you the which<br />
for you by the decisions that we have made.<br />
The other thing that I want to say is this we are conscious of<br />
the fact that within the industry not just here, but right<br />
uasc rosslo oAkuinsgtr aalita the thhoaut sitnhge rei ndisu satr ym ootodo asy outh ec ani ndguets tray bheattse rput to<br />
structured industry. There are arguments, as you know, for<br />

of alcoholic intake, beer and it is inequitable that you are not<br />
being taxed on wine generally.<br />
L </p>
<p>Now ( inaudible) along that path because we want to in<br />
fact be able to have more detailed discussions with the industry.<br />
That is what I put to you. John Kerin, a highly respected<br />
and experienced Minister knows primary industry better than<br />
any other Primary Industry Minister in the post war period.<br />
He's got practical and intellectual experience and I<br />
instructed John that I want him from now on as he goes through<br />
this year and prepare for an overall lick the prcblems of<br />
your industry. I want him to have discussions with you and<br />
also I hope that he will actually come and talk with people<br />
like yourselves as well as the representatives and the people<br />
who are voted to see what are the best ways in which we as a<br />
government can be of assistance to the industry at the same time<br />
as meeting our commitments with the Australian community as a<br />
whole. So you can see I haven't come to you with some weak excuse te<br />
say, right we made a mistake, we are going to get rid of the<br />
decision. I haven't come to you and said we are going to<br />
( inaudible). I have come directly to you and tried to explain<br />
to you why in the interests of all Australians we have had<br />
to raise revenue ( inaudible) and of this day each one of<br />
you who is in a bank situation where you are paying for money or<br />
in a situation where you are going to<br />
As a direct involvement of decisions that we took<br />
as a result of those decisions, anyone in<br />
involving the borrowing of money we are distinctly better off<br />
now because we took that range of decisions and I ask you in<br />
respect of something better to do that there may be expansion<br />
because of the reduced that were taken regaring excise...<br />
That was part of the tactics that has produced that improved<br />
situation with regard to interest rates. I ask you<br />
We did not take those decisions with any sense of trying to<br />
impose burdens for the sake of doing it, everything that we did<br />
has been we have been trying to create an economic situation<br />
in which we can get the economy moving and if a borrowing<br />
economy, an economy in which more people are employed, and in<br />
which the employed people are going to have higher incomes<br />
which ultimately determine your welfare so it's not just in<br />
terms of your net income costs down, ultimately the other<br />
determinant is how much of your you have got once the<br />
capacity of<br />
That is what. we have done trying to get this economy moving<br />
and we In the last few years before we came in<br />
the economy was going like that unemployment was increasing,<br />
jobs were declining. All these we have reversed<br />
in respect of which we have had to impose this increased<br />
charge, as a result of what we have done, by the end of 1983/ 84<br />
this economy will be growing at a rate of 5-6% per annum<br />
against the decline offered you before.<br />
It is in that situation that we will produce a growing economy<br />
with more people at work, with higher annual incomes,<br />
that there will be a much greater market for your products.<br />
You will be better off on your income side as a result of the<br />
decisions that we have taken, so I do ask you as responsible and<br />
concerned citizens<br />
in line with election commitments. </p>
<p>We see, in particular, inuediate decision which is of some<br />
concern to you in an overall context and I want to say this<br />
to you from the end of 1983/ 84 as a result of the reduced<br />
interest rates tlhat will have been operating as a result<br />
of tne and higher demands which there will be for products,<br />
I venture to suggest to you that we take all those things<br />
into account and you will be, on balance, as you go into 84/ 85,<br />
you will be in a betteir position and I say that also in the<br />
context and I give you an indication that the whole of this<br />
industry and how we can be involved in it and how we can be of<br />
assistance to you will be a matter of continual discussions<br />
by Mr. Kerin and he will report to me.<br />
Thank you very much indeed for your attendance. </p>
