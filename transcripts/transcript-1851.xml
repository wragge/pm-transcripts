DESIGNERS FOR OSAKA EXPOSITION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Robin Boyd, a well-known Melbourne architect and<br />
writer, has been appointed by the Government to design and supervise<br />
the construction of the exhibits for the Australian pavilion at the World<br />
Exposition to be held in Osaka, Japan, from 15 March to 13 September,<br />
1970. Mr. Boyd was the designer of the exhibits for the<br />
successful Australian presentation at Expo ' 67 at Montreal, Canada.<br />
The interior decor of the Montreal pavilion attracted world-wide<br />
attention and won high praise for Mr. Boyd's work.<br />
The pavilion to house the Australian exhibit at the World<br />
Exposition 1970 is being designed in the Canberra Branch of the<br />
Commonwealth Department of Works by a design team under the<br />
leadership of Mr. James MacCormick. The design for the pavilion is<br />
well advanced. Because of language and other problems, the Department<br />
will appoint a firm of Japanese architects to prepare contract documents.<br />
The same Departmental design team was responsible for<br />
the Australian pavilion at Montreal for the 1967 World Exposition. This<br />
pavilion was regarded by the authorities as one of the best designs at the<br />
Exposition and was retained on the site for future use.<br />
