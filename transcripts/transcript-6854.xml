TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE WILLISEE 5 MARCH 1986<br />
WILLISEE: It is three years today since the Labor Party regained<br />
power in Canberra and Bob Hawke became Prime Minister. In that<br />
time employment opportunities have been increased, inflation has<br />
been contained but interest rates have soared. Now however you<br />
analyse that the fact is that business community recognises that<br />
the Hawke Government has done, at least, a reasonable job of<br />
economic management. So much so that the Left Wing of the Labor<br />
Party thinks it is not quite the Labor Party they had in mind.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke today agreed to this interview.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Mike.<br />
WILLISEE: Where are we at with politics philosophically in<br />
Australia today? we used to have you know the bosses versus the<br />
workers and all those clear cut lines. I mean is Fraser or Howard<br />
or Peacock to the left or right of you?<br />
PM: Well, I am not interested in political geometry. What I am<br />
about is effective politics which are concerned with bringing<br />
people together. As I said again at the Press Club today I put to<br />
the people of Australia in February of 1983, look you have had<br />
seven and a half years of this confrontation concept. It has<br />
brought you the worst economic recession in 50 years. It has<br />
brought you simultaneous double digit unemployment and inflation.<br />
I said it has also brought you a country that is deeply divided<br />
and bitter and without hope. I said there is a better way and a<br />
better way is to start to talking with the trade unions, to talk<br />
with business and get them talking together with government. I<br />
said it will produce a better result. What's happened? As a<br />
result of that approach where I am close to business, I am close<br />
to the trade unions. As a result of that we have a position where<br />
we have got record employment growth, record economic growth, we<br />
are doing better than the rest of the world. Now I simply say you<br />
can talk about that being left or right-of x, y and z. What it is<br />
about is being close in there with the Australian people.<br />
WILLISEE: Even Gough Whitlam, for all the mistakes he made in<br />
government, says at least he had a reformist government and he<br />
indicates that you don't.<br />
PM: Well, I don't think he has said and I think you would need<br />
identify that proposition. Now I simply say, and I am not in the<br />
business of trying to compare myself with Gough or any other </p>
<p>Labor government, what I am saying is that we have been true to<br />
the traditions of the Labor Party. We have been true to the<br />
proposition that what Labor is about is to create jobs, to create<br />
equalities of opportunities. That we have done and we have done<br />
it by recognising the greatest cause of poverty in this country<br />
is unemployment and there are 600,000 people testifying this<br />
night to the fact that those policies, those principles, those<br />
objectives, those philosophies have worked.<br />
WILLISEE: You face the real prospect of being the first Labor<br />
Prime minister in our history to get a third term. So I think<br />
probably it is not right for you to say that you are not in the<br />
business of comparing yourself with other Labor Prime Minister's<br />
because you must be compared.<br />
PM: Well, you can say that I must be compared. I was not saying<br />
what others do, Mike. I can honestly tell you that I don't sit<br />
down and compare myself with Gough or anyone else. I have a view,<br />
I don't want to sound melodramatic by talking about a vision but<br />
you can use the word if you like, I have a view about where this<br />
great country ought to go and can go. And where it ought to go<br />
and can go is dependent, I think, overwhelmingly on one thing and<br />
this is what I said to the people in February of 1983. It<br />
basically depends on being prepared to respect one another and to<br />
work with one another. Now we have got&amp;&amp; ihe -un-s on the board,<br />
that's what we are going to continue to do.<br />
WILLISEE: And you know, of course, you have been criticised for<br />
not having a vision but for concentrating on pragmatic economic<br />
management, making the country work.<br />
PM: Yes, I know that there are some people who have said it. But<br />
all I am simply saying is that if you have your correspondents<br />
and your people who say this, well that is fair enough. I mean<br />
that is beaut, I like them exercising their freedom of saying<br />
what they think. I am much more concerned with the knowledge that<br />
ordinary Australians out there now say to me in their thousands,<br />
they are saying it all the time, Australia today in 1986 is an<br />
infinitely better place. our kids have an infinitely better<br />
opportunity now than they had three years ago before you came to<br />
Government. That is my criterion of successful government.<br />
WILLISEE: And what have those three years of government done to<br />
Bob Hawke?<br />
PM: well I can honestly say Mike, that I have never felt better<br />
than I do now. I<br />
WILLISEE: But is that government or is that stopping drinking?<br />
PM: Well, you have asked me how do I feel. All I can say is that<br />
I feel good and I have got many people and things to thank for<br />
that. I think more than anything I have got Hazel to thank for<br />
getting me on to a good diet which I think is just essential for<br />
everyone and a fairly well disciplined approach to my work.<br />
WILLISEE: Do you miss the so-called Hawke larrikin days? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: I don't think miss them is right. I remember them with a<br />
certain degree of affection at times. Also with a memory of<br />
almost horror. That was a part of my life I hope I am mature and<br />
adult enough to say, been there, done that, now you have got<br />
another job to do.<br />
WILLESEE: And after Hawke?<br />
PM: That in my democratic party will be for my colleagues to<br />
decide. WILLESEE: But you will have a vote in that matter and people<br />
are entitled to know what that is?<br />
PM: They will know at the time if I do have a vote. I won't<br />
necessarily be in that situation.<br />
WILLESEE: Some people say Paul Keating is the automatic<br />
successor.<br />
PM: saEul is-obviously entitled to be regarded as a leading<br />
candidate, obviously. There are others, I would think, who also<br />
have aspirations. And I am not in the business of publicly<br />
advancing causes. Paul wouldn't thank me if I did. And<br />
certainly others wouldn't.<br />
WILLESEE: You are not jealous of Paul Keating?<br />
PM: No. He is a very good friend and we respect one another,<br />
very, very considerable respect we have for one another. We work<br />
very closely together and we will continue to do so.<br />
WILLESEE: What about his outburst recently? He seemed a little<br />
arrogant and he seemed a little rattled which is not the usual<br />
Paul Keating that we see?<br />
PM: No, he is not usually arrogant, that is right.<br />
WILLESEE: Well, what about that outburst?<br />
PM: I don't want really to revive the circumstances. I simply<br />
make this observation, Mike, that one of the things particularly<br />
that was said about him, which was totally untrue, totally<br />
without foundation, went very much to the morality of Paul<br />
Keating. And I can understand him being very hurt about that.<br />
Particularly, where there was not a skerrick of evidence to<br />
support it, where it was totally baseless. It is all very well<br />
for people to stand off and say, well he should have been cooler.<br />
Perhaps he should have been, I think perhaps he should have been.<br />
But I am simply saying he is a human being with a wife, with<br />
children, and he is entitled to feel that there are limits to the<br />
way in which a dispirited, unprincipled, incompetent Opposition<br />
ought to go in its hopelessness. </p>
<p>4<br />
WILLESEE: An entire Opposition or one person?<br />
PM: More than one. Let there be no suggestion, Mike, that what<br />
we saw last week was just the random outbursts and observation of<br />
one man on the Opposition.<br />
WILLESEE: For many years I know that John Howard and you have<br />
had some mutual respect, has that gone?<br />
PM: I don't want to introduce a personality bitterness between<br />
John and myself and I don't intend to. I will deal with John<br />
Howard in the Parliament on the questions of policy and<br />
principles, what do you stand for; what is the conflict; how do<br />
you make compatible the proposition that you will give away all<br />
revenue but you will cut no services; how do you start to make<br />
any semblance of sense of your voodoo economics. I will attack<br />
on the issue of principles and policies. I won't be attacking<br />
John Howard on any personality issues.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you still respect him?<br />
PM: I have less respect than I had previously. I must have.<br />
But, I respect him for his position.-a e is the Leader of the<br />
opposition and he will have all the respect that properly<br />
attaches to that position, Mike. I will deal with John Howard in<br />
the Parliament and outside on the issues, on the policies, on the<br />
principles. You won't find me getting down into the gutter. I<br />
have had the opportunity in the past and there are people in<br />
politics who can attest to this, and I'll tell you off the<br />
program who they are, where I've had material brought to me about<br />
the personal lives of my opponents and I have consistently and<br />
religiously refused to use that. That's not what politics should<br />
be about in my opinion.<br />
WILLESEE: Even though in the past of course it's happened on<br />
both sides.<br />
PM: That doesn't justify it and if my colleagues in the past<br />
have done it I don't excuse them. Politics ought to be about<br />
issues, principles, policies, about personal competences. I mean<br />
I'm saying that in politics you don't say that person is<br />
incompetent for this and that reason, of course that's part of<br />
politics, but you don't get into the sewer, the gutter about<br />
people's personal lives. It's wrong and it's counterproductive.<br />
I think that and I certainly hope that the decent people in the<br />
opposition to whom this sort of attack that we've been talking<br />
about is as much anathema as it is to me, that their will will<br />
prevail. WILLESEE: Prime Minister thanks very much for your time.<br />
ends </p>
