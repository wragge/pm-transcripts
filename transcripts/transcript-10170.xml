14 November 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE CENTRE FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES<br />
E O E<br />
Frank Devine, Bob Carr, Roger Douglas, Greg Lindsay, and as I look around the<br />
room, a very large number of people who have participated in different ways in the<br />
intense and exciting debate and battle of ideas over a very long period of time.<br />
Your mention of Boris Yeltsin of course reminds me of the invitation I received from<br />
Kerri-Anne Kennerley to dance in public yesterday and I said Boris Yeltsin was the last<br />
head of a government to do that and look what happened to him!!<br />
Can I say what a tremendous pleasure it is to be here tonight to mark the twentieth<br />
anniversary of a remarkable organisation that has played a very significant role in an<br />
unfolding debate about the fuiture of our country. The way in which people should<br />
relate to governments and the role of governments in our society. If you go back<br />
twenty years there were not only a lot more monopolies in Australia commercially but<br />
there were also a lot more monopolies when it came to the generation of ideas and the<br />
generation facts. I think it went beyond the Federal Treasury and the Reserve Bank<br />
and the economic partners of one or two of the major banks and insurance companies<br />
that was about it as far as economics was concerned. As far as think tanks are<br />
concerned apart from the tremendous contribution of the IPA there wasn't really much<br />
around and the Centre of Independent Studies has played a tremendous role over that<br />
period of time. There has been a quite extraordinary saga throughout the world that<br />
watched of course the most amazing event this century and that is the implosion of<br />
communism and the ultimate triumph of individual political liberty over political<br />
territory which of course is the most remarkable even that I've experienced in my<br />
lifetime and a vindication of the philosophical basis of those who opposed political<br />
tyranny. And we've watched over that 20 year period a remarkable transformation in the<br />
economic debate the most profound questioning of the role of government in our<br />
society this century and there are a lot of people who have been great heroes but I am<br />
going to be bold enough tonight to say that the two people in my book who stand out </p>
<p>above the others, one of them is here tonight and that's Roger Douglas I think Roger<br />
Douglas at a political level.... ( applause).<br />
I suppose in a generic sense he started off from my point of view in the wrong Party<br />
but in a sense ideas transcend Party disciplines in these things, and I think the other<br />
person who deserves an accolade is Margaret Thatcher. ( Applause) I think some of<br />
the sort of modern revisionism, sort of ignored the fact... I mean the real test is<br />
whether when you've left the job you've changed the country in an identifiable way<br />
and I think both Roger Douglas and Margaret Thatcher have certainly achieved that.<br />
And I think the debate here in Australia there have been some sort of high points of it,<br />
I guess and I might be accused by some of you of being a bit sort of self pre-occupied<br />
or egocentric in saying it but I think of all the debates that have sort of raged around<br />
the role of government and the role of the State as distinct from the role of the<br />
individual, none has been more important in Australia over the last twenty years than<br />
the deregulation of Australia's labour markets and I think that has been a tremendously<br />
important debate intellectually and the power of ideas triumphing even in political<br />
banishment is well demonstrated by that particular debate and it is a reminder that the<br />
force of a good idea is something that can never really be stopped and many of the<br />
people who have played very significant roles in all of those debates are here tonight<br />
and I think at State Government level a lot of very complimentary things can be said<br />
about what Nick Greiner did in blazing the trail as far as benchmarking of efficient<br />
State services are concerned applause).<br />
Now that we have put away mobile telephones I have to pay enormous tribute to my<br />
good friend Jeffrey Kennett who also has played a tremendous role and I very freely<br />
acknowledge the tremendous contribution that Bob Carr is making in areas like<br />
education. Can I say that, having said that, I mean we obviously have some profound<br />
differences on other issues but that brings me to saying something serious about the<br />
future. The last 20 years may have been about economic issues such as the labour market but I<br />
think the next twenty years really ought to be about some of the non-economic issues.<br />
I think education is a very important part of that debate and the other of course is<br />
about having a decent sensible family policy and I applaud the Centre of Independent<br />
Studies for the emphasis they are placing on that. I mean we really do, all of us, who<br />
are worried about the future of our nation and all of us have to be concerned about a<br />
culture that has been far too dominant for far too long in our society that believes that<br />
it doesn't really matter any more as to what kind of sense of responsibility or<br />
irresponsibility some parents in our community display towards their children.<br />
And until there is a greater focus on the lasting damage that that generation of<br />
irresponsibility in many parts of our society has produced, then I think we are going to<br />
be a poorer community. I do congratulate the Centre of Independent Studies for the<br />
focus that it is placing on social policy, particularly on family policy.<br />
We've had a lot of debate over the last couple of years about whether so-called<br />
economic rationalism has gone too far and I think I'm the first speaker to dare utter </p>
<p>those two words tonight. I mean, if you were looking for a generic term to describe all<br />
of us, a lot of people out there would say that we were sort of economic rationalists<br />
and a lot of you might think others are more sort of economic rationalists than you<br />
individually might be. We would describe ourselves perhaps differently. I would<br />
describe myself as an economic liberal although albeit self-confessedly a bit of a social<br />
conservative. Others would describe themselves by some other label but whatever it is<br />
I think we have a rough understanding that we have certain threads in common and<br />
those threads in common consist of profound scepticism that Governments can solve<br />
all of our problems. I think that's the first thing that we have in common. We have a<br />
passionate belief in individual self-fulfilment and achievement. I think we all have a<br />
passionate belief that a sense of civic responsibility and a view that we ought to care<br />
for people and not in some kind of patronising way or suffocating way but in a sense of<br />
civic responsibility and I think finally we also have as people I think as a sense that you<br />
do need cohesive units and stabilisers in our society and the greatest stabiliser of all<br />
still for all its imperfections is the family unit, and I would like to think that the bonds<br />
that bind us together, let's not have a simplistic slogan of economic rationalist or this<br />
or that. Some of us in different ways may find those terms offensive but perhaps those<br />
four things bind us together in a very very powerful way.<br />
I salute the Centre of Independent Studies. I think it has made a tremendous<br />
contribution to the intellectual debate. It has made better policy, we have better<br />
governments on both sides of the political equation as a result of organisations like the<br />
Centre of Independent Studies and I think it is a magnificent thing that a body like this<br />
can have Bob Carr and Peter Collins and John Howard and Nick Greiner and Roger<br />
Douglas and Mary Easson and Mr Egan and everybody in the same room. I think<br />
that's a good thing and I think society is better for that. I think Australians want their<br />
political leaders where they genuinely agree on something to acknowledge that<br />
agreement and then get on with the debate in areas where they don't agree with each<br />
other. I think Australians are fed up with ritualistic eye gouging ( applause)... and I<br />
think Greg, to you and your organisation has helped do that. It was after all a former<br />
Labor leader and Foreign Minister, then Governor General of Australia, who I<br />
attended with six years ago when your new headquarters were opened and I think it is<br />
very typical of the way in which you've been able to gather people of both sides of<br />
politics so I congratulate you, and in doing so can I acknowledge one very obvious<br />
fact that you have been, and it's very evident tonight, it is a family occasion, it's not<br />
only the CIS family but there's also plenty of Lindsays and Lindsay associates.<br />
They're a prolific lot, and I know what a tremendous intellectual and personal support<br />
and moral support your wife Jenny and your three children have been.<br />
I suppose it is the oldest cliche in the book, but any man or woman in any kind of<br />
position of responsibility needs a man or woman to support them. And I know that, I<br />
know that very very well indeed and I'm very grateful for the support I've had from<br />
my wife and children and I know that the support that you've had from your wife and<br />
three children has been priceless, invaluable and incalculable, and an occasion like this<br />
oughtn't to go by without that being acknowledged by me on behalf of everybody<br />
here. So happy birthday, congratulations, and particularly to you Greg, for the<br />
intellectual stewardship that you've given to this great organisation.<br />
ends </p>
