STATEMENT ON PROTECTIVE SECURITY AND COUNTER-TE RRORI SM<br />
Mr Speaker, all Members of Parliament will be aware of thc tragic<br />
event which occurred on the morning of February the 13th outside<br />
the Sydney Hilton Hotel, where twelve Heads of Government<br />
assembled for the Commonw-ealth Regional Meeting.<br />
It was an event which brought home to every Australian<br />
that acts of terrorism can occur in this normally peaceable country.<br />
The senseless murder of three innocent Australians the third,<br />
a police constable died in hospital yesterday demonstrated<br />
the indiscriminate nature of terrorist violence.<br />
Terrorist acts are a violent assault upon the freedom of each<br />
and every Australian. The Australian people have a right to be<br />
protected a ' gainst the actions of terrorists. Terrorism will<br />
not be tolerated in this country. That is the Government's<br />
position, and I am sure that it is the position of every Member<br />
of this Hlouse.<br />
For some time, the Government has been concerned at the growing<br />
international trend to violence for political ends. In the past<br />
five years, according to evidence recently given to a<br />
U. S. Senate Committee there have been 1,800 major acts of terrorism<br />
around the world involving S12 deaths,' 551 injuries and<br />
363 kidnappings. Following on the events of last week, I now<br />
report to the Parliament and through the Parliament to the<br />
people of Australia on the actions the Government has taken<br />
and will take to guard against this evil.<br />
On coming to office we were advised that changing world circumstances<br />
made it necessary to review the arrangements then existing to<br />
protect overseas visitors, members of the Diplomatic Corps and<br />
the Australian public against acts of violence.<br />
We have acted over the past two years to increase the effectiveness<br />
of these arrangements.<br />
1. In 1976, the Government acted to improve the effectiveness<br />
of liaison and coordination between the various Commonwealth and State<br />
agencies and police. authorities. To this end, the<br />
Protective Services Coordination Centre was e stablished in the<br />
Department of Administrative Services. Its role is to plan,<br />
coordinate and initiate protective security arrangements for<br />
. people holding high office visiting or present in Australia, and<br />
to coordinate counter-terroist measures. / 2 </p>
<p>The Protective Servies Coordination Ccntrc is advised by a W<br />
special interdepartmental Committee on protection against<br />
violence. It maintains close liaison w\ ith appropriate<br />
Commonealth and State authorities and agencies.<br />
Contingency plans have becn developed over a number of years to<br />
deal with any international terrorist incident which might<br />
occur cither in Australia,, or in another country affecting<br />
Australian lives and interests. These plans are being<br />
regularly updated. Simulated anti-terrorist exercises have<br />
been held wvith the Statcs to test the effectiveness of existing<br />
arrangements, and adjustments have been made in the light of<br />
lessons learnt from these exercises.<br />
2. The Government has increased the protection afforded to<br />
diplomatic representatives in Australia, particularly in the<br />
light of the incidents in recent times involving members of the<br />
Indian High Commission.<br />
3. The Government has considered and accepted the basic<br />
conclusions of the Report by Mr Justice Hope on Intelligence and<br />
Security, and is acting to ensure his conclusions are put into<br />
effect. Following the tragedy in Sydney on February 13th, the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government agreed to establish a working group, to<br />
be convened by Singapore, to explore ways in which collaboration<br />
can be enlarged, both regionally and internationally, in combating,<br />
terror is m.<br />
In addition, my Government has undertaken a further review of<br />
the totality of security arrangements against acts of terrorism.<br />
None of the old assumptions can be uncritically taken for<br />
granted. Each must be challenged and re-evaluated.<br />
The Sydney tragedy underlines the importance of even more intensive<br />
deve. lopment of cooperation between Commonwealth and State civil<br />
and police authorities. Immediately after the tragedy occurred,<br />
the Premier of New South Wales and I agreed that a complete<br />
review of security arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Regional ' Meeting was required, and security was<br />
further tightened. Given-the additional strain on New South Wales<br />
Police, the Premier and I agreed that members of the Australian<br />
Defence Force would be used to supplement police resources, and<br />
the extent of the use of service personnel was determined in close<br />
consultation between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales<br />
authorities. I would like to pay a tribute to the cooperation which the Commonwealhas<br />
had from the New South Wales Government. The New South Wales<br />
Premier, Mr Wran, put the security and safety of the people of<br />
New% South W1ales and of visiting delegations as his first<br />
priority after the bomib explosion in Sydney.. He joined with<br />
me in a cooperative effort. / 3 </p>
<p>I would like to repeat and endorse the comments he made to the<br />
New South Wales Parliament, the day after the explosion:<br />
" It is now the task of the Government, the Parli ament, and<br />
the community to do everything possible to ensure that<br />
yesterday's scar does not permanently damage the<br />
fabric of our society.<br />
" This will need vigilance, cooperation, unity, goodwill, and<br />
above all, a realisation that our young but great country<br />
is now part of a world in which international and internal<br />
violence and terrorism has become almost commonplace."<br />
It is in recognition of these facts that we must build further<br />
on the past pattern of Commonwealth and State cooperation.<br />
As a result of the review which the Government has undertakenp.<br />
it has been decided that further steps must be taken to<br />
fulfill its responsibility to safeguard our society while<br />
protecting the individual rights and liberties of all Australians.<br />
The steps the Government proposes fall into two categories.<br />
Immediate action will be taken in those areas where the experience<br />
of the last few weeks has made apparent the need for improvement.<br />
Additional measures which, by their nature, require further<br />
detailed examination will be taken on the advice of a review<br />
which the Government is establishing.<br />
Clearly the cooperation of the States is indispensable and I shall<br />
be writing to the State Premiers on these issues.<br />
The immediate measures which we propose are these:<br />
1. We shall be proposing to the States the establishment of<br />
a Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth State Cooperation<br />
for Protection against Violence. The Committee, which I expect<br />
to be comprised of the most senior civilian and police officials,<br />
will be charged with the task of achieving the highest degree of<br />
efficient operation and cooperation on a nation-wide basis.<br />
2. While selected Commonwealth and State Police are currently<br />
trained in counter-terrorist techniques, the Government believes<br />
that training in counter-terrorist strategy and tactics should<br />
be greatly intensified. To achieve this, experienced instructors<br />
will be obtained to provide appropriate training courses for<br />
police and relevant civil authorites. They will be drawn<br />
from the United Kingdom, and other nations with first-hand<br />
counter-terrorist experience. I believe this training is necessary<br />
for our police forces, and that such a programme would also<br />
assist the States.<br />
In addition, funds dill be made available to enable more State,<br />
Territorial and Commonwaltfi police to be sent overseas to gain<br />
experience in the most modern methods of preventing and dealing<br />
with all forms of terrorism. / 4 </p>
<p>3. 1 am also proposing to the Preieirs a total reviewj of the<br />
adequacy and mutual compatibility of police equipment.<br />
The review should examine police communications systems and<br />
determine the need for a common and secure nation-wide police<br />
communication network,. Th e Commonwealth will discuss with<br />
the States the provision of financial assistance to ensure<br />
that essential equipment is made available.<br />
All H-onourable Members will agree with me that the protection of<br />
our society and all the people who live and work in it<br />
is of the utmost importance. I am convinced all Premiers<br />
share this view. The prospects of effective cooperation are real.<br />
I also inform the I-louse that Sir Robert Mark, who has recently<br />
retired as Commissiorner of London M'vetropolitan Police<br />
( New Scotland Yard) has, at the Government's request, made himself<br />
immediate available to advise on the organisation of police<br />
resources in the Commonwealth area and measures for protective<br />
security and counter-terrorism.<br />
In addition to these immediate measures, the Government believes<br />
it of the utmost importance that a review be undertaken of the whole<br />
area of protective security in Australia by a person who has<br />
an appreciation of intelligence and security operations, and a<br />
concern for the liberties of individual men and womien of Australia.<br />
I am happy to be able to advise the H-ouse that the Premier of<br />
New South Wales has agreed to mnake MI-r Justice Hope available<br />
to carry out this review, and I thank him for his, prompt<br />
cooperation. I have received from the Leader of the Opposition a thoughtful<br />
and constructive letter which manifests a clear concern both for<br />
security and civil liberties. The Government, however, concluded<br />
that a review conducted by Mr Justice Hope would be the most<br />
effective and appropriate way to proceed, and that the terms of<br />
the review embrace the very proper concerns of the Leader of<br />
the Opposition.<br />
Mr Justice I-lope will be empowered to undertaken a fully comnprehensive,<br />
review. The matters he will consider will include:<br />
a) Relationships between State, Territorial and Commonwealth<br />
Police, and between law enforcement agyencies, intelligence<br />
and other relevant civilian authorities.<br />
This would include the particular case of relationships<br />
between ASIO and the Special Branches of State police forces<br />
on which I have already been in communication with the<br />
Premiers.<br />
b) Arrangements to achieve coordination of assessments of<br />
security risks and the communication of these assessments<br />
to relevant agencies, and authorities._ .1/ </p>
<p>c) Clarification aLnd provision of guidelines on the<br />
division of responsibilities between police forces, and<br />
between themuiand other agencies.<br />
d) Advice On further Measures for coordination.<br />
For instance, whether it is desirable or possible in liw,,<br />
to provide for a single police commander in given situations.<br />
For example, if an incident occurs in New South Wales, should<br />
a senior New Southi Wales officer be in charge, not only of<br />
11' bw South 1Wales police but also of available Commonwealth<br />
forces and ins trumentali ties.<br />
e) The possibility of establishing in each State a standing<br />
combined operational and intelligence advisory body to<br />
underpin and facilitate the work of State and Commonwealth<br />
agencies, particularly to assist coordination by<br />
commanders where more -than one police force is involved..<br />
f) The relationship between the Defence Force and civilian<br />
authorities in the matter of civilian security.<br />
g) Security and protective arrangements in force in all<br />
Commonwealth Departments and authorities, and the capacity of<br />
Departments and authorities to provide support to the general<br />
protective security effort in various situations.<br />
h) Examining the need for Commonwealth and* Sta te promulgation of<br />
guidelines, p) ublic announcements, the passage of legislation<br />
or other measures which may be necessary to secure a<br />
coordinated and effective basis for protection against<br />
violence.<br />
i) The overall bala1acing of the interests of security and the<br />
rights of private citizens.<br />
j) Recommending the invitation of such overseas experts to<br />
advise and report on the foregoing matters as he may judge<br />
desirable.<br />
These are the broad areas which Mr Justice Hope will examine.<br />
The Commonwalth will be discussing them with the States and stands<br />
-ready to amend them if necessary in the light of such discussions.<br />
The introduction of an)' legislation as a result of Mr Justice Hope's<br />
review will, of course, present the opportunity for Parliamentary<br />
examination of the-relevant issues.<br />
I should also add that ' Ministers and their Departments have been<br />
asked to ensure that their protective security arrangements<br />
are fully adequate. The review to be undertaken by ' Mr Justice Hope<br />
does not detract in'any way from this responsibility.<br />
Mr Speaker, I believe this Parliament and the Parliaments of -the<br />
States recogonise their overriding obligation to take all<br />
necessary steps to protect Australians from acts of terrdrism,<br />
while protecting individual personal liberties. / 6 </p>
<p>AI<br />
recall in this context the statement in the Rockefeller Repos<br />
on the CIA quoted by ' Mr Justice Hope in his fourth report on<br />
intelligence and security:<br />
the final analysis public safety and individual<br />
liberty sustain one another."<br />
The measures which have been announced today strike the balance<br />
between the need to respond decisively to the threat of terrorism<br />
and the imperative of preserving Australia's character as<br />
an open society and the democratic freedoms we all hold<br />
paramount. Terrorism is a crime against every Australian. It will not be<br />
tolerated, either by the people of Australia or by their<br />
Parliamentary representatives. </p>
