CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONFEDERATION OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
CANBERRA 26 NOVEMBER 1987<br />
Brian Ettelston<br />
Daryl George<br />
Bill Blair<br />
First let me say how pleased I am to be able to address you<br />
here tonight.<br />
In the various capacities of my working life I have had a<br />
long association with the CAI. Many personal friends are<br />
here tonight.<br />
So it is always a pleasure to address you.<br />
As you know I was in New Zealand over the weekend to discuss<br />
a range of matters, including the review of CER scheduled<br />
for next year.<br />
Prime Minister Lange and I have set a broad ranging agenda<br />
for the review, consistent with the expressed wishes of<br />
business organisations on both sides of the Tasman.<br />
On the Sunday, David Lange and I went fishing off the Bay of<br />
Islands. Despite the variable weather and rough seas it was<br />
a good day's fishing but the New Zealand fish did seem<br />
determined to cooperate more with David than with me.<br />
Thinking back on it, I now realise that our fishing trip was<br />
somewhat analogous to the current predicament of the<br />
Australian economy and New Zealand's for that matter.<br />
There we were out on the high seas buffetted by forc~ s<br />
beyond our control. But we both stuck to the task, and made<br />
steady progress at it undaunted by the fact that the press<br />
boat, perhaps typically, threatened on a couple occasions to<br />
inundate us.<br />
So, too, Labor's management of the Australian economy has<br />
been steadfast and determined during times of great<br />
uncertainty. </p>
<p>Australia's economy has been buffetted by a complex array of<br />
forces over the four and a half years that my Government has<br />
had responsibility for economic management in Australia.<br />
We all know the chronology. Before we came to office<br />
Australia was in the doldrums of recession in 1982-83; we<br />
then recovered rapidly in a period of strong growth over<br />
1984 and 1985; we were in danger of being swamped by the<br />
massive terms of trade collapse which followed; but we<br />
weathered this storm with significant rates of economic<br />
growth. The seas began to calm for a period because the signs of<br />
successful adjustment had begun to emerge clearly,<br />
especially over the course of this year.<br />
But last month, Wall Street " fell out of bed", and brought a<br />
new set of tensions which stem particularly from the<br />
inadequacies of the economic policies of the world's largest<br />
economies. Through all of this the Government has concentrated on the<br />
task at hand, read the seas correctly and got on with the<br />
job, fair weather or foul.<br />
That's the essence of the message I want to put tonight.<br />
The fall in the value of the shares listed on the world's<br />
major stock exchanges has certainly been unprecedented.<br />
similarly the associated realignment of the major currencies<br />
by foreign exchange markets has been dramatic.<br />
Adjustments of this magnitude cannot be accommodated over so<br />
short a time without at least some dislocations elsewhere in<br />
the world economy.<br />
But this is not a time for Australia to hide behind<br />
simplistic remedies.<br />
The question to be answered is how severe these dislocations<br />
will be and what implications flow for economic policy<br />
making in Australia.<br />
We have these questions under active consideration.<br />
At this stage the only accurate answer that can be given is<br />
that it is too soon to tell the magnitude of the likely<br />
impacts on the world economy. V<br />
Nevertheless the directions of change are well enough known<br />
and there are clear signs emerging that the more alarmist<br />
forecasts of doom we heard last month have little<br />
credibility today.<br />
Some commentators have suggested that we should assume the<br />
worst possible scenario and have prescribed, as they<br />
regularly do, a very austere fiscal and wages regime. 02$ </p>
<p>The CAI was among those who called for an early tightening<br />
of policy.<br />
Indeed there were many who were just speaking to their<br />
prejudices and who seem to favour fiscal and wages<br />
tightening no matter how tight policy already is.<br />
The important point which I suggest the CAI and others have<br />
ignored is that no business could reasonably shut down a<br />
significant proportion of its plant on the basis of as<br />
little information as we now have about the likely effects<br />
of the stock market correction. Nor should this Government<br />
take such precipitate steps.<br />
But having said that let me make two points plain about the<br />
Government's position.<br />
The first is that as soon as the required policy responses,<br />
if any, can be identified and implemented, we will do so.<br />
The second point is just as important. It is this<br />
Australia can, in the meantime, afford to take the time for<br />
an informed evaluation of the situation. That is because<br />
the policy framework we had put in place was already moving<br />
Australia in the right direction.<br />
This point is frequently overlooked. It is one I will refer<br />
to later.<br />
First let me give you a brief assessment of where I think<br />
the initial burden of adjustment to the stock market is<br />
likely to be felt.<br />
Of course the first effects are confined to the financial<br />
markets themselves.<br />
So sharp a decline in share values has placed a premium on<br />
access to cash.<br />
The Reserve Bank, in line with all other major central<br />
banks, has consistently sought to provide an adequate supply<br />
of cash to the market.<br />
It will continue to do so for as long as is necessary.<br />
Looking further ahead it is clear that for a time world<br />
growth is likely to be slower than previously expected.<br />
Lower stock market values will affect people's assessment of<br />
their own wealth. Those whose wealth has been reduced may<br />
feel the need to save more to compensate, which will slow<br />
the growth of private spending.<br />
Some businesses, especially highly geared ones, may become<br />
cautious about major new investments. U ( 3i) </p>
<p>Moreover the policy adjustments required of the world's<br />
largest economy, the United States, are likely to slow<br />
growth in that economy, at least initially. Any<br />
expansionary measures elsewhere could be slower acting.<br />
But let us keep the stock market crash in perspective.<br />
It ha. s to be viewed against the background of a five year<br />
period of rising share prices in international markets.<br />
Even after recent falls, the Australian All ordinaries share<br />
price index is still about 80 per cent higher than it was<br />
three years ago, and is still at about the same level as in<br />
October 1986.<br />
Moreover growth expectations in some of the major economies<br />
were in the process of being revised upwards prior to the<br />
crash from levels which were reasonable by recent<br />
standards. This suggests I believe that the share market correction is<br />
not likely to precipitate a recession.<br />
That is an assessment which is shared by the OECD.<br />
It is reported that their forecasters are expected to revise<br />
their growth estimates downwards by 1/ 2 per cent in the case<br />
of the US and by 1/ 4 per cent in the case of the industrial<br />
countries as a whole. That would leave growth, at 2 1/ 4 per<br />
cent in 1988 in both cases, which is only 1/ 2 per cent lower<br />
than the average of the last 6 years.<br />
Slower world growth can be expected to peg back the growth<br />
of our exports a little as time passes and to slow the<br />
growth of commodity prices compared to earlier expectations<br />
but on the evidence to date of firm commodity prices since<br />
the crash the impact may not be great.<br />
Domestic economic growth was showing signs of considerable<br />
strength in the September quarter just prior to the stock<br />
market crash.<br />
Although there are grounds for believing that the quarterly<br />
figures overestimate the longer term trend, the latest<br />
national accounts show that private consumption picked up<br />
strongly in the September quarter after declining for much<br />
of 1986-87.<br />
Indeed, this pick-up was somewhat stronger than expected in<br />
the Budget forecasts. V<br />
So if there is some slowing in demand in prospect, it will<br />
be starting from a higher level than we had envisaged at<br />
Budget time.<br />
But perhaps the strongest ground for optimism is the<br />
considerable progress which has already been made in<br />
re-structuring the economy. o u. 3 I </p>
<p>In the first four months of this financial year, our current<br />
account deficit was $ 1.2 billion, or 20 per cent, lower than<br />
for the same period last year.<br />
This reflects a dramatic improvement in our trade account.<br />
over the period, exports rose by nearly 12 per cent while<br />
imports remained roughly unchanged, resulting in a 60 per<br />
cent decline in our merchandise trade deficit.<br />
Moreover, despite many forecasts to the contrary, business<br />
investment has picked up sharply. In the September quarter<br />
non-residential construction rose 11.5 per cent and, most<br />
significantly, equipment investment rose 11.8 per cent.<br />
Taken together these trade and investment figures provide<br />
sure evidence of the reconstruction of the Australian<br />
economy. They also show why we should not be overly concerned about<br />
our capacity to frame policies to weather the choppy seas<br />
which the stock market crash has whipped up.<br />
The sources of our economic reconstruction are firmly rooted<br />
in the congenial environment for business which our economic<br />
policy settings have permitted and in the dramatic<br />
improvement in our international competitiveness.<br />
Let me point to the factors underlying that success.<br />
First is our solid fiscal performance. Having inherited the<br />
prospect of a Budget deficit of $ 9.6 billion in 1983 we have<br />
reduced the fiscal deficit from that horrendous level in<br />
each Budget. Moreover over the last two Budgets we have cut<br />
outlays by more than 3 per cent in real terms.<br />
The accumulated result of five Budgets of fiscal restraint<br />
is that in 1987-88, for the first time in 30 years, we<br />
balanced the Budget.<br />
The great benefit is that, since government is borrowing<br />
less from financial markets, there is less pressure on<br />
interest rates in Australia and less dependence by<br />
Australians on overseas borrowings.<br />
In particular, fiscal restraint has underwritten the<br />
substantial declines in interest rates that we have<br />
witnessed this year. V<br />
A second essential ingredient in producing the right<br />
environment for business has been wages moderation and a<br />
dramatic improvement in industrial disputation.<br />
The figures on wage restraint speak for themselves. In each<br />
of the last two financial years, average weekly earnings<br />
have risen by at least two percentage points less than the<br />
Consumer Price Index. It is expected that average weekly<br />
earnings will again rise by less than the Consumer Price<br />
Index this year. </p>
<p>Moreover, with the introduction of the two-tier wage system<br />
earlier this year, an opportunity has now been provided to<br />
employers to negotiate the removal of restrictive work<br />
practices. This is the best such opportunity provided in Australia's<br />
post war history and I would urge you all to take a personal<br />
inter ' est in ensuring that your own companies make the most<br />
of this opportunity to attain more efficient and productive<br />
work places.<br />
Although in the present wage round there,' is a limit of 4 per<br />
cent on the potential wages gain in second tier agreements,<br />
there is no such limit on the productivity increases that<br />
can be negotiated by employers. It is encouraging to note<br />
that some employers have achieved productivity gains well in<br />
excess of 4 per cent in their second tier agreements.<br />
Despite these achievements achievements which have been<br />
secured not least because of the enlightened cooperation of<br />
the trade union movement some have suggested that the<br />
Government should oppose the ACTIJ's claim for a<br />
1 1/ 2 per cent first tier increase in the current National<br />
Wage Case. Indeed some people in this room have made that<br />
suggestion. But I put it to them that their remedy would be a peculiarly<br />
short-sighted one.<br />
To deny the current National Wage Case claim would put at<br />
risk the high degree of compliance with the centralised<br />
wages fixing principles which has been the foundation on<br />
which sustained real labour cost reductions have been built<br />
over recent years.<br />
It would also put at risk our initiatives to improve work<br />
practices and would undermine improvements in the industrial<br />
relations environment.<br />
If, when the dust settles from recent world financial market<br />
turbulence, there is need for further tightening of wages<br />
policy and I make no predictions that will occur then<br />
Australia's interests will be best served by having in place<br />
a durable basis of trust with the union movement. That will<br />
provide a framework for negotiations and cooperation in<br />
adjusting wages to meet underlying economic imperatives.<br />
In summary on the wages front let me make these points.<br />
There has probably been more nonsense talked on this issue<br />
by our political opponents, many employers and some extreme<br />
elements of the trade union movement an unholy alliance<br />
than on any other area of economic and social policy.<br />
Together they have ignored, avoided or simply not<br />
comprehended the fundamental facts which are these. 0U: 2 8( </p>
<p>Because of the existence of the centralised wage fixing<br />
system and a strong and responsible trade union movement,<br />
since 1983 real wages have declined in a period of overall<br />
economic growth a fact unprecedented in our economic<br />
history. This has been possible because the trade union movement, in<br />
cooperation with this Government, has been prepared to<br />
accept, in the place of real wage increases for a smaller<br />
workforce, improvements in the social wage and an<br />
historically high rate of employment growth with 837,000<br />
new jobs giving a rate of growth twice as fast as the rest<br />
of the world. And all ' this with competitiveness and profit<br />
shares back to the levels-of the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br />
These, as I say, are facts. It is a pity the ritualistic<br />
parading of prejudices seems to have precluded their more<br />
universal recognition.<br />
The third element underpinning Australia's economic<br />
reconstruction has been steady reform of the policies,<br />
practices, rules and regulations which form the backdrop to<br />
the business environment.<br />
This remains a top priority of my Government's third term.<br />
Indeed its relevance to the post-stock-market correcti on<br />
world is, if anything, greater than before because what<br />
counts most at such a time is flexibility.<br />
We want to get government off the back of business as much<br />
as possible and to free up the operation of the<br />
infrastructure to maximise the efficiency of our economy.<br />
That is a large task. It is one which requires a careful<br />
approach to the making and review of regulations which<br />
impinge on the private sector. It also requires dedicated<br />
pursuit of public sector efficiency.<br />
we have required of ourselves the kinds of discipline which<br />
we encourage in the private sector.<br />
The number of Departments has been slashed by 10, eventually<br />
saving 3,000 jobs, and an annual wages bill of $ 107 million.<br />
David Block has been appointed to scrutinise Departmental<br />
operations and Departments are now required to meet an<br />
annual efficiency dividend of 1 1/ 4 per cent of running<br />
costs. These measures will save almost $ 100 million in<br />
1988-89. We have reversed the growth of public service<br />
staff numbers.<br />
Public sector authorities will not be exempted either.<br />
Possible measures include introducing greater competition,<br />
or improved performance criteria. </p>
<p>As you know I have also suggested and not from the point<br />
of view of some manic ideological hang up against public<br />
enterprise that the broader public interest may be better<br />
served by freeing up resources through the disposal of some<br />
public enterprises, provided we could be sure that essential<br />
community requirements would be at least as well served by<br />
the private sector.<br />
The g overnment's record on deregulation is impressive by<br />
anyone's standards.<br />
The most recent example has been the announcement of our<br />
intention to terminate the Two Airlines' Agreement and end<br />
the economic regulation of the domestic aviation industry.<br />
At the same time clear guidelines have been promulgated for<br />
the automatic approval of programs of international charter<br />
flights into Australia and the regulation of liner shipping<br />
has been reformed.<br />
The task of carrying forward the broader agenda of economic<br />
reform is being guided by the Structural Adjustment<br />
Committee of Cabinet.<br />
The Committee has a wide range of matters on its agenda for<br />
consideration in the next few months.<br />
Among other things this includes a review of the<br />
telecommunications industry, aspects of education policy,<br />
the regulatory apparatus for Government business enterprises<br />
and some further areas of transport policy.<br />
The Treasurer also has well in hand a further review of the<br />
business tax system, to see what can be done to reduce<br />
business tax rates through sensible broadening of the<br />
company tax base.<br />
While not an exhaustive list, it illustrates the breadth of<br />
the reform process we have in mind and the strength of our<br />
commitment. No Australian Government has ever attempted<br />
such a wide-ranging review of its microeconomic policies.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Tomorrow I will be departing for a brief visit to Singapore<br />
and the USSR, where I will be joined also by the Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bill Hayden.<br />
It will be my first visit to the USSR a~ sPrime Minister and<br />
I expect to hold wide ranging talks with the Soviet<br />
leadership.<br />
As with all my overseas visits, however, we will be giving a<br />
particular emphasis to promoting Australia's trading<br />
interests.<br />
Australia already has a significant trading relationship<br />
with the USSR, which is our eighth largest export market. </p>
<p>m<br />
Bill Hayden and I hope to give new momentum to our longer<br />
term trading relationships in the course of this visit.<br />
Recognising the importance of an appropriate<br />
government-level umbrella for business contacts with the<br />
centrally planned economies, I will be accompanied for the<br />
trade talks in Moscow by a group of Australian businessmen<br />
who are seeking to develop their links with USSR.<br />
In particular they will participate in the discussions with<br />
Mr Kamentsev, Chairman of the State Foreign Economic<br />
Commission. This body was formed in 1986 to facilitate<br />
joint ventures and the like with foreign companies-.<br />
A new agreement is to be signed during the visit which will<br />
provide an expanded framework for the development of our<br />
trading relationship. The focus is not simply on trade in<br />
goods and services but also on developing wider forms of<br />
economic co-operation such as joint ventures and the<br />
exchange of technology.<br />
This visit will complement our wider initiatives to open up<br />
trading opportunities, including in the context of the GATT.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Uncertainties about the world economic situation have<br />
introduced a new element into the design of economic policy<br />
in Australia. But we need to view it in proper prospective.<br />
I take some heart from the fact that President Reagan has<br />
made a start in reducing the US fiscal deficit and that he<br />
and his Cabinet colleagues are firmly opposed to<br />
protectionism. Both attitudes are fundamental to the longer<br />
term solution.<br />
I also take great comfort from the fact that Australia faces<br />
this period of uncertainty with three major advantages.<br />
First is a track record of having weathered a series of<br />
storms and of having found timely and correct solutions.<br />
Second is an economy which is increasingly competitive,<br />
dynamic and export oriented and thus more able to cope<br />
with changing world conditions.<br />
And third it is my belief that in the last Federal election<br />
we have re-written the political/ economic agenda. Ne~ yer<br />
again, I believe, will any party be able, with any hope of<br />
success, to go to the Australian people with Alice in<br />
Wonderland programs that neither add up nor address the<br />
realities of the economic challenges facing our country.<br />
The day of the bribe and of cheap rhetoric has gone what<br />
is required is performance or credible alternatives.<br />
This combination gives us a firm foundation on which to<br />
build Australia's long term economic prosperity. </p>
<p>it is a com~ binationl which provides a solid underpinning for<br />
business to plan with confidence. </p>
