TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, 18 AUGUST, 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: On the line the Prime Minister. Good morning and welcome.<br />
PM: Good morning, John.<br />
JL: How do you answer Helen?<br />
PM: Well that was only half a quote. The quotation you just referred to<br />
said, what I said was on that occasion, the Government will keep I<br />
haven't got the words with me the tax share, revenue to GDP at<br />
around roughly the same level. We will not put up tax. In other words<br />
we will not put up the burden of tax, and that's what we have not done.<br />
JL: Well you have.<br />
PM: No. That reference was keeping tax to GDP between about, from<br />
memory, 23.7 and 24.2 per cent. The point I made at the time I made<br />
the quotation, but of course I don't expect the Liberal Party<br />
Yesterday in fact, Mr Downer, tried the last five words of the quotation<br />
on me, the one you just quoted, and I read the full quotation. What the<br />
Government has said, John, is this, that we will not be lifting the<br />
burden of tax, that is, the revenue in the economy as a share of the<br />
total economy, revenue to GDP, and we won't be. And the evidence of<br />
that is when the OECD publishes its annual report, which comes out<br />
next week, it will show Australians the lowest taxed country in the<br />
western world.<br />
JL: Yes. But the OECD doesn't mean much to Australia now, if we are<br />
going to make our base Asia. We should be comparing ourselves to<br />
Asia.<br />
PM: Yes, in some things, but not in tax to GDP. Because this is a<br />
developed economy. This is an economy with a full public education<br />
system, this is an economy with a full public health system, this is an<br />
economy which is a sophisticated developed economy. You can't run<br />
this sort of economy on Thailand tax rates. </p>
<p>r<br />
2<br />
JL Well 80 per cent of the improvement that Canberra is going to receive<br />
is going to be received by extracting yet more money from the workers<br />
of Australia. So, how can you say that the overall burden of tax has<br />
not been increased? That's what John Dawkins said, we will not<br />
increase the overall burden of tax, now, that's a lie.<br />
PM: No it is not. It is dead true. It is detailed in the Budget papers. That<br />
is, that the revenue share in GDP will not be rising above the levels we<br />
were talking about when both he and I made those statements a year<br />
ago, that was around 23.5 to 24.2 per cent of GDP.<br />
JL Why is the Government providing tax cuts by raising taxes? I mean<br />
that's quite an extraordinary thing to do. We will give you tax cuts, but<br />
we have got to raise taxes to give you tax cuts.<br />
PM: But we are paying more tax cuts than we are raising revenue. Now,<br />
the reason is this, that the 38 per cent rate, marginal rate, comes in<br />
now at $ 20,500, it comes in at two thirds of average weekly earnings.<br />
So, every dollar someone earns above $ 20,500, which is just over<br />
$ 400.00 a week is taxed at 38 per cent. The marginal rate of taxation<br />
is too high. Now, these tax cuts paid from November will reduce that<br />
tax rate from 34 per cent. And those tax cuts will provide about $ 8.00<br />
to $ 10.00 a week for someone around about, up to and around<br />
average weekly earnings.<br />
JL Yes. But how much of that tax cut are they going to be paying for in<br />
increased wholesale taxes that have got up on a mass of things and<br />
fuel taxes have gone up?<br />
PM: Well this year the tax cuts are paid for by higher dividends from the<br />
Reserve Bank.<br />
JL Yes, well I mean that was a windfall for you, wasn't it?<br />
PM: Well we are selling, still Government assets. When the Reserve Bank<br />
sells American dollars and buys Australian dollars, as it was doing to<br />
stabilise the currency, we are selling the Australian Government<br />
American dollar assets.<br />
JL You see I can't accept the fact I mean you might be able to tell me in<br />
economic jargon, but you try and tell the average Joe, and I happen to<br />
be one of them that you haven't increased the overall burden of<br />
taxes.<br />
PM: Well we haven't, John, we haven't.<br />
JL Well you might not of in some areas, but you have. I mean you have<br />
done some work on fringe benefits tax, you have done some work on<br />
wholesale tax, you have increased the burden of taxes and you have<br />
put up taxes. </p>
<p>PM: We are increasing the rates of some indirect taxes, but at the same<br />
time handing back more in tax cuts. Therefore, the burden of taxation<br />
will remain roughly in those areas of 1990-91, which we said going to<br />
the election.<br />
JL Yes, but all the benefits that are going to Canberra, 80 per cent of<br />
them are paid by the workers of Australia. But you have not cut much<br />
back.<br />
PM: Then 100 per cent of them are paid back out to the workers of<br />
Australia via tax cuts.<br />
JL Yes, but you have not cut much back. I mean, you have asked the<br />
people to pay more tax, and you have asked the people to pay more<br />
tax there is no arguing the point, in order that you can look like good<br />
fellas. You are just spending tax payers money. You haven't cut<br />
anything back.<br />
PM: What do you mean we haven't cut anything back?<br />
JL Well what have you cut back? In terms of your expenditure, how many<br />
people are going from your staff?<br />
PM: Well there will be substantial changes to Commonwealth authorities<br />
employment levels over the next year as the productivity efficiency<br />
changes in the public sector emulate the changes in the private sector.<br />
But that's hardly the point, John.<br />
JL But, Prime Minister, it is the point, when you are telling the average<br />
Joe that he is going to have to pay more for a smoke, and more for a<br />
drink, and more for petrol to put in his old bomb. You blokes are<br />
cutting nothing, you have still got as many cars, as many planes, as<br />
many light fittings, as many secretaries, as many everything. The<br />
Budget, in fact, for you fellas has gone up by 16 per cent. You are<br />
going to have more.<br />
PM: When you say us, are you talking about the Cabinet or the politicians?<br />
JL I am talking about Administrative Services.<br />
PM: Well one thing we are doing is cutting back the Commonwealth car<br />
pool for a start. And substantially.<br />
JL: Ok, well how is it then the Budget for Administrative Services is rising<br />
16 per cent?<br />
PM: Well most of that is rents paid to the private sector. Because<br />
Administrative Services carries the rental bill of the Commonwealth.<br />
When we rent a building in the capital cities for a tax office or<br />
somewhere else it is paid for by Administrative Services. You can't </p>
<p>4<br />
assume that those things are just money spent on politicians. The<br />
great burden, the great bulk of funds outlaid in the Department of<br />
Administrative Services Budget are for basically Commonwealth<br />
rentals.<br />
JL And more money is going to be paid out in social security. Now, that is<br />
money that comes from the workers of Australia and goes to the<br />
unfortunate non-workers of Australia, but that is going to be increased<br />
too.<br />
PM: But look, John, let me just make a couple of points to you about those<br />
things. There are very important changes here, for instance, go to all<br />
people. There is the home child care allowance, which is $ 60.00 a<br />
fortnight paid to all, basically women, at home with dependents, $ 60.00<br />
a fortnight.<br />
JL Married women?<br />
PM: Yes. What are they, non-Australians, shouldn't get it?<br />
JL No, no, they must certainly should get it. But what are we talking<br />
about, are we talking about married women, or are we talking about<br />
single?<br />
PM: In the main, married women whose husbands work. Then you have<br />
got a generalised child care rebate. Then we have got a seniors<br />
health card, then we have got improved spending on the labour market<br />
programs to take the long-termed unemployed back into work. That's<br />
where the social security spending is. Is that illegitimate?<br />
JL No, it is not illegitimate. But it is not working, is it?<br />
PM: Of course it is working.<br />
JL It is not working. Is it all there, is all this in place in order that we can<br />
abolish poverty as such in Australia, or reduce it at least?<br />
PM: Those things are there because we believe, let me give you two<br />
examples, in providing a generalised child care rebate we are saying,<br />
we are regarding this as basically an expense of work, of finding<br />
employment and having your child cared for while you are at work. So,<br />
it is a generalised rebate which will be paid through Medicare Offices.<br />
Now, the symmetry of this is, for those women who stay at home, who<br />
are not at work, formerly they say well there is nothing there for us.<br />
There is now $ 60.00 a fortnight for them. It is a matter of getting the<br />
social balances right.<br />
JL Well it sure is. If this is to fight the war on poverty, it is a failure. </p>
<p>PM: I mean, you fight the war on poverty over a long period of time with a<br />
broad range of Commonwealth programs, and I don't think they are<br />
failures.<br />
JL Well, explain this. In 1973, 3,916, 000 families, or income units as<br />
they are called by the bureau of statistics, lived beneath the poverty<br />
line, 3, 916,000 families. Welfare's spending in the time has increased<br />
from $ 1.56 billion to $ 28 billion, and yet now we have got 6 million<br />
families or more living beneath the poverty line. So, we have spent<br />
more on poor people, and we have got more poor people.<br />
PM: Yes, but the poverty lines, it depends whose poverty line it is. There is<br />
no such thing as a poverty line, in terms of any definition which is<br />
endorsed. The fact is, John, look we have got a decent income<br />
support system for the aged, via the age pension, which has increased<br />
in real terms under this Government. We have increased the free area<br />
with which pensioners can earn income and keep it.. We have<br />
removed that income totally from the tax system, that is for the aged.<br />
For those with families we introduced the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement, which makes a very heavy payment to low income<br />
families with children, and now we are extending that further by the<br />
home child care allowance, and the generalised child rebate. And we<br />
have cut the bottom rates of tax on low paid people, from 30 per cent<br />
to 20 per cent, that's up to about $ 20,000.<br />
JL Yes, but the benefits that are given to all these people, deserving<br />
though the majority of them are, there is absolutely no question, the<br />
majority of them are. Deserving though they may be all those<br />
payments can only come about because somebody else is going to<br />
work, because somebody else is earning the money. You're taking the<br />
money from us to give to the people that you believe to be the<br />
deserving people. Why should the workers of Australia be paying<br />
monies out to young ladies who decide that it is economically viable to<br />
go and have children rather than go to work?<br />
PM: Well why should the workers of Australia pay money out to support the<br />
aged? Answer, because the aged did their work and made their<br />
contribution.<br />
JL Well that's right. And could you tell me what work an 18 year old who<br />
wants to have a couple of children, can you tell me what work she has<br />
done, what contributions she has made?<br />
PM: You can't go and damn what is one of the best and tightest social<br />
security systems in the world when you are focussing on supporting<br />
parents benefit.<br />
JL Ok, well I will focus on any benefit you like. But let's look at supporting<br />
parents benefits. I mean it is inexcusable these days, apart from the<br />
tragedy of rape or assault, for young ladies to become pregnant unless<br />
they choose to. I mean, we have condoms morning, noon and night in </p>
<p>6<br />
different colours, flavours and tricks, we have got all sorts of pills<br />
available, we have sex education in schools. Once, sure, a dreadful<br />
accident can occur in a moment of passion, fine we must look after<br />
that. But four or five, or six, or seven or eight times the people of<br />
Australia have to keep supporting these young women.<br />
PM: It is not for me to go and make a judgement about each particular<br />
persons life. What about the young woman who was married with<br />
three children whose husband walked out on her, and she is living in a<br />
flat with three children?<br />
JL: Now, she is the one that we have got to help.<br />
PM: Ok, we will send you around and ask you which one do you like, and<br />
which one don't you like.<br />
JL: But you have got a massive organisation there in the Department of<br />
Social Security.<br />
PM: And, John, we have got a very tight system.<br />
JL: How can it be a very tight system when day after day I get calls from<br />
people who admit to me on radio, and they are not going to tell lies<br />
about what they are doing, they have got five children that they receive<br />
bundles of money on welfare, and have no intention of ever going to<br />
work.. And some of them don't even know the father of the child?<br />
PM: What about the children, what do we say? Well sorry to those<br />
children, you were born into this situation and you are on your own.<br />
JL: No, we don't say that to them. We don't allow the situation to develop<br />
in the first instance by improving family values and by making these<br />
this young ladies aware of the fact that they are not going to be<br />
handed a bundle of money if they go and continually get themselves<br />
pregnant.<br />
PM: Let's get back on to the Budget. What about we get back on the<br />
mainstream?<br />
JL: Well I can understand why you want to get back on the main stream?<br />
PM: There is no change in the Budget last night about supporting parents<br />
benefit. No change.<br />
JL: No, but there was a change to payments in Austudy. You said that you<br />
would no longer pay Austudy to 16 year olds. Which wasn't a bad<br />
idea.<br />
PM: Yes, we are going to pay it to 17 year olds, and we are going to pay it<br />
to the parents and not the kids. </p>
<p>JL: Ok, well why then doesn't somebody say, and nor are we going to<br />
accept in one instance, pay supporting parents benefits to any woman<br />
under 18 years of age unless she can nominate the father of the child?<br />
PM: Because I just don't think you can run a social security system based<br />
on a whole lot of moral judgements about things like that. And again,<br />
that is not where the great burden of the outlays and social security<br />
spending are. They are basically on the aged and they are on<br />
families.<br />
JL: It is a fair burden, it is a fair burden, it is $ 3 billion a year.<br />
PM: Let me get a plug in for the Budget, and just give you a couple of<br />
points about that. Now, look, I want to say this to you about it, we are<br />
paying out $ 3.8 billion in tax cuts in each year for the next roughly four<br />
years.<br />
JL: And so you should because you promised you would.<br />
PM: Yes, right and we are meeting that promise. And we are meeting<br />
another 100 election promises which we detailed in a booklet attached<br />
to the Budget papers. In any of those years the revenue change will<br />
raise $ 3 billion, when the revenue changes are at their peak, these are<br />
these various things we mentioned petrol and the wholesale sales tax<br />
when they are at their peak they are $ 3 billion.<br />
JL: That will raise $ 3 billion?<br />
PM: At its peak and it builds up over two or three years.<br />
JL: Yes, well $ 3 billion is just sufficient to cover the sole parents pensions<br />
for a year.<br />
PM: OK, $ 3 billion against the tax cuts of 3.8. Now, I have heard Dr<br />
Hewson on various radios and no doubt he will be on to you and<br />
others to say if we had been there things would have been better<br />
well, you can compare $ 3 billion a year in revenue increases under<br />
Labor to $ 24 billion a year under him. The GST was going to raise<br />
$ 24,000 million a year and, of course, the tax cuts he wanted to pay<br />
were not funded by the GST, he had to cut government spending to<br />
pieces to pay for it. So, we are paying $ 3.8 billion out in tax cuts, we<br />
are raising $ 3 billion every year compared to $ 24 billion every year<br />
under the Liberals.<br />
JL: Yes well as I say that is very good and that is very positive as far as<br />
the Budget is concerned but it also very correct because it is what you<br />
told the people of Australia.<br />
PM: Exactly, and John, the key point about this is this, that the tax cut<br />
added $ 2 billion stimulus to the economy, now the One Nation<br />
spending of February 1992 it always takes about a year to get it up </p>
<p>8<br />
and moving. And the One Nation spending that was on the railway<br />
systems and roads are kicking growth along and when the growth<br />
figures came out a week ago for the last quarter, we had 1.2 per cent<br />
for the quarter and 3.3 per cent growth for the year making us about<br />
the fastest growing of the western economies. To that we are now<br />
adding a $ 2 billion stimulus via the tax cuts. In other words we are<br />
giving it a further push to kick it along so that we really keep the<br />
economy growing and therefore improve the whole ambience of the<br />
economy in the labour market. So the tax cuts do two things, they cut<br />
back that marginal rate about $ 20500 from 38 per cent to 34 per cent<br />
and they provide a $ 2 billion stimulus to the economy.<br />
JL Yep. Well they are all the things that you promised you would do.<br />
Prior to the election you also said that there was going to be an<br />
avalanche, your word not mine of investment. In fact you predicted<br />
that investment would increase by $ 120 billion as a result of that One<br />
Nation investment incentive plan that you just mentioned. And the<br />
latest national accounts data shows that investment actually has<br />
declined. What happened there?<br />
PM: Well we have got investment growing through the year here at about,<br />
I'll just find the forecast it is here somewhere, plant and equipment<br />
investment 9 1/ 2 per cent growth over the course of the year. See<br />
what we are seeing now John is quite high profits. The reason the<br />
stock market has been hitting high levels again is because the<br />
investors are factoring in those higher profits back into the stock<br />
market. Now, in the One Nation and in this Budget we have cut the<br />
company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. We've introduced<br />
two investment allowances, we put in a massive acceleration of<br />
depreciation for plant and equipment, the business community has<br />
now got a tax rate, an overnight cash rate of under 5 per cent, 4 3/ 4<br />
per cent at the Reserve Bank they have got a competitive exchange<br />
rate. I mean, on the range of those issues business has never had<br />
those things together all at once ever and they have got full dividend<br />
imputation. That is, relief of the double tax on dividend.<br />
JL Yes, okay, but that is a long way from the $ 130 billion increase in the<br />
avalanche.<br />
PM: No, the 130 billion is the listed stock of nominated investments which<br />
may qualify for the investment allowance.<br />
JL Well, did we get the 130 billion?<br />
PM: Well they are coming through.<br />
JL But we didn't get them.<br />
PM: Well, they have to be listed to qualify for the investment allowance by<br />
a certain date and there is 130 billion listed and as they get approved<br />
and get started they get moving. But that will be over a few years. </p>
<p>d. i.<br />
9<br />
JL Okay, well let's get back to the part of the Budget that concerns the<br />
people who listen to this radio program. It has got to be inflationary,<br />
the increase in petrol excise has got to be inflationary. Would you<br />
have increased the cost of leaded petrol if it hadn't have been for the<br />
alleged environmental problems?<br />
PM: We'd hoped that the transition to unleaded fuel would have been<br />
faster. I don't know whether you remember, you will need a bit of a<br />
memory on this, but you've got a good one, in NSW when Paul Landa<br />
was the Minister for Environment back in the early 80s he introduced a<br />
law saying that new cars would only have unleaded fuel by certain<br />
dates. Now the Australian motor industry geared up for that and I<br />
think-sorry, he introduced that in the 70s by about the late 70s to<br />
early 80s we actually had unleaded fuel and unleaded cars. But we<br />
haven't had the turnover and stock of vehicles and that has produced a<br />
big problem in places like Western Sydney where you have got<br />
children with lead problems, the inhalation of lead, and high lead levels<br />
in their blood.<br />
JL Yes, is there any absolute proof of this?<br />
PM: I don't think there is any doubt about lead levels around the world.<br />
JL There isn't any doubt about lead levels but is there any absolute proof<br />
of the damage done? I mean are there more children suffering<br />
problems that are allegedly caused by lead inhalation in the city than<br />
in the country? Because in the country there would be very little and<br />
yet it is the country people that are going to be hit the hardest with the<br />
increase in petrol prices?<br />
PM: Well, farmers of course, their implements are mostly diesel and they<br />
get protected by the off-road diesel rebate.<br />
JL Yes but you have made an alteration to that too.<br />
PM: The rates have gone up but they will still get the rebate which will<br />
mean that they will be<br />
JL It is still going to cost them more.<br />
PM: Not for their off-road use.<br />
JL Well according to what I read in the paper this morning its still going to<br />
cost the farmer more. But be that as it may....<br />
PM: Can I make a very important point to you?<br />
JL Yes. </p>
<p>PM: Petrol excise has declined as a proportion of the total Commonwealth<br />
revenue from 14.6 per cent in 1981-82, that is ten years ago, to 10 per<br />
cent today. What is happening is, the petrol excise is falling off, John,<br />
and its also falling off at Bass Strait. All that oil that used to gurgle up<br />
out of those big fields Halibut and Kingfish off the Gippsland coast are<br />
now no longer doing that, we are now draining those big fields so all<br />
that revenue base we had is falling away. Because we cut tariffs,<br />
customs duty is falling so the indirect base of the Commonwealth is<br />
falling. That means, we'll end up, if we don't do something about it,<br />
with a tax system which has got all the dependence on income tax. So<br />
that means income taxpayers, that is ordinary working men and<br />
women, will pay the lions share of the tax burden.<br />
JL: Well they are doing it now.<br />
PM: It should be paid also by users, people who use these things.<br />
JL: But the income taxpayers are paying the lion's share now.<br />
PM: That is true in every country. But we don't want them paying the lion's<br />
lion share, you know what I mean, we don't want it going to an absurd<br />
level of dependency on income tax. Look, in all these things, it is a<br />
matter of getting the balance.<br />
JL: You see, that is right, it is a matter of getting the balance.<br />
PM: Where as what my friend Dr Hewson was saying is well listen let's<br />
stick on a massive $ 24 billion a year GST on indirect tax problems we<br />
don't need to do that.<br />
JL: Let's not worry about him he is not running the place.<br />
PM: All we need to do is to basically tone up the indirect tax system so it is<br />
W not declining rapidly.<br />
JL: Okay, but you say it is a matter of balance and I think it is an excellent<br />
choice of words. It is a matter of balance and all these complex issues<br />
of levies on petrol and lack of oil in Bass Strait and all the other things<br />
that you mentioned to us are totally incomprehensible to the average<br />
Joe. But there is the balance...<br />
PM: But there is the Joker's like me that understand, John.<br />
JL: Can I just finish, the balance should come in. But balance should be<br />
weighted up according to the effect it is going to have on people that<br />
voted you into office. Now you are hurting the people, the very people<br />
that voted you into office. You are hurting the farmers with this diesel<br />
thing, I have the document in front of me now. The indexation of the<br />
rebate will also be slowed meaning many farmers could lose up to a<br />
cent a litre which could equate to thousands of dollars for larger<br />
operators. So you are knocking the farmers around, you are knocking </p>
<p>A 11<br />
the average Joe around. Just imagine, I mean you used to be the<br />
Party of the worker, have a look at the average worker listening to this<br />
program now. Let's say he takes home $ 350 a week, has a wife and<br />
three or four kids, drives and old car that runs on leaded petrol, does<br />
or 100 kilometres a day to and from work doing work, smokes, has<br />
a beer, has the odd glass of wine with his Mrs. In other words, and<br />
average Australian good bloke. Could you explain to him why he<br />
should think you are a good bloke?<br />
PM: Well he gets a tax cut.<br />
JL: That is why he voted for you.<br />
PM: Well yes, but a tax cut is more than covering off these things. His wife<br />
is picking up the home child care allowance which is $ 60 a fortnight.<br />
His wife may be at work, in which case they would pick up the<br />
generalised child care rebate. And of course, they would be enjoying<br />
the family allowance supplement which we introduced from 1987<br />
onwards, which is substantial payments to taxpayers with children.<br />
JL: How do you explain to him with his $ 350 a week and his old car and<br />
his 80/ 1 00 kilometres a day and his smokes and his booze. How do<br />
you explain to him when his wife who stays at home and minds the kids<br />
which is a wonderfully old-fashioned thing do, takes them to get some<br />
medical treatment that she has got to pay for them, and yet the young<br />
lady down the road who has got a couple or maybe three out of<br />
wedlock not even knowing the name of the father, gets the treatment<br />
for nothing, how do you explain that?<br />
PM: You are getting back onto those single mums again.<br />
JL: No not single mums. People who have made the commitment, been<br />
married and then lose a husband, could be getting supported better if<br />
we didn't allow this other nonsense to continue. But you people are<br />
allowing it to continue. And yet you had a look at Austudy and you say<br />
we'll take Austudy away for 16 year olds but you will still provide<br />
supporting parents benefits for 16 year olds to go out and get pregnant<br />
when they can't even tell you the name of the father of the child. I<br />
mean, it is wrong, you explain that.<br />
PM: John, you have got to make some decisions about whether or not you<br />
support the welfare of children.<br />
JL: I support the welfare of children.<br />
PM: Regardless of how they are born.<br />
JL: I support the welfare of children, but I think it would be a better idea..<br />
PM: You don't, you are telling us we ought to knock them off. </p>
<p>JL No I'm not saying any such thing. I'm saying that what we should do is<br />
improve the quality of the people in the country that don't use those<br />
poor wretched children. I don't want to go into details because if I do I<br />
will embarrass you. If you had a look at a few of the tragedies which<br />
have occurred in this country over the last four weeks, just have a look<br />
at how many of those children are on supporting parents benefits, how<br />
many of those were unmarried, how many of those were living on<br />
government largesse and you would be very surprised. It is not doing<br />
much for the moral quality of this country I'll tell you.<br />
PM: Well let me tell you this. I don't think Commonwealth programs, if that<br />
is what the implication of your remarks are leading to some sort of<br />
morale decay, I don't accept that. I mean, if there are changing<br />
community standards around things like families and the structure of<br />
families, it is in part because of community attitude, it is not<br />
government attitude, it is the community's attitude.<br />
JL That is right. But the community attitude is...<br />
PM: And we are governing a community here, we are not governing only<br />
those that have got a house with a white picket fence around it and<br />
daffodils in the front garden, with mum staying at home looking after<br />
the kids.<br />
JL It is not a bad aim.<br />
PM: I know but that is not the only society. It is not the society we have,<br />
John, we have got those sorts of people and we have got other people<br />
who live in flats and might have been married and now are not married.<br />
JL And they have got to be cared for.<br />
PM: Exactly.<br />
JL Nobody was arguing that. But you have got to understand it is also the<br />
Government and the government largesse that lubricates the society in<br />
which we live. The adoption figures are very interesting, in 1971 8500<br />
adoptions in Australia, by 1985 1000. Why, because it is better<br />
economically to hang on to the child. Is that doing the child any good?<br />
PM: It is not government programs doing that, it is the media, its films, its<br />
community attitudes.<br />
JL But you are still paying.<br />
PM: No we are paying to look after the kids. That is our principle.<br />
JL That is right. You are paying to look after the kids and consequently<br />
you are creating a society where kids are being used as an income<br />
earner. </p>
<p>PM: Well, so what do we do. Put the kids in the streets so that they can run<br />
and pinch money off people, pick pockets, or beg?<br />
JL: No, you are not going to get around me that way. The idea would be<br />
to make it clear to people that they have some responsibility for their<br />
own behaviour. I mean, we have got to introduce a program for<br />
behavioural responsibility. But we had better get back to the Budget.<br />
PM: You are going to be a big winner with the Festival of Light. They will<br />
have you as the patron and standard bearer.<br />
JL: Well I don't worry about ( inaudible). The thing that concerns me is that<br />
what I believe the decline in proper standards in the country like<br />
Australia which is a great country. There are decent people out there<br />
working pretty hard and I think that they are pretty fed up with a bunch<br />
of people who choose not to work and there aren't too many of them<br />
but there are some of them, it wouldn't take much to cover the $ 3<br />
billion a year.<br />
PM: John, there will be always some that choose not to work and use the<br />
welfare system to cover the benefits of their kids but I am just making<br />
these points to you, the key points. This is the lowest tax country in<br />
the Western world. That means, the burden of taxation on all<br />
Australians is by Western world standards, the lowest.<br />
JL: Very good.<br />
PM: Point one. Point two, the spending of the Government reflects those<br />
low revenues and the fact that we will have the Budget deficit back to 1<br />
per cent of GDP by 1996-97 means that the balance, the difference<br />
between that low rate of taxation, that world low and the spending is 1<br />
per cent of GDP. So therefore our spending is commensurate with our<br />
revenue which is the lowest in the world. Therefore, what we are<br />
saying is the Commonwealth of Australia under Labor government is<br />
delivering a good social security system, is delivering Medicare, its<br />
delivering health, aged care, child care, all of these things with a very<br />
low spending base and a very low tax base. And I think they are the<br />
key points and nothing in the Budget is going to do anything but keep<br />
revenue as a proportion of GDP at the levels that I said when you<br />
quoted me right at the start of the program of 1989-90 and 1990-91.<br />
JL: Okay, well what is going to happen when inflation occurs, you can't<br />
deny it will occur with the increase in the cost of fuel, that is going to<br />
push up the price of everything because fuel effects everybody,<br />
deliveries, costs of products, everything.<br />
PM: Well we have still got in the Budget forecasts, even with all these<br />
things in, we have got inflation in year average terms in 1993-94 at 3<br />
1/ 2 per cent. Now with productivity high, in other words, if there is a<br />
higher productivity in the economy, it even diminishes that 3 1/ 2 per<br />
cent inflation. So you are probably looking at underlying inflation, the </p>
<p>Treasury says underlying inflation is about 2, or 2 point something per<br />
cent. And that is why you can afford to have, as we now do, low<br />
interest rates. I mean we had interest rates this low 20 years ago.<br />
You see, again in the Budget, John, you have got inflation at a 30 year<br />
low and you have got interest rates at a 20 year low. I mean, the last<br />
time I saw interest rates with a 5 or a 6 in front of them was when I was<br />
a kid in jeans.<br />
JL Nobody can argue that. All of that is very good and all of that is very<br />
commendable. And I think that the people generally commend you for<br />
it. They don't understand however, why you appear to be, whether it is<br />
correct or not but you can't blame them for their cynicism, you appear<br />
to be hurting the ones that in fact you allegedly represent. I mean, one<br />
of your strongest arguments prior to the election was that the<br />
Opposition didn't compensate pensioners or low income earners with<br />
the dreaded GST. You have not compensated them either.<br />
PM: We have got pensions as a proportion of average weekly earnings<br />
rising. We have had it rising as well now over 25 per cent of average<br />
weekly earnings. We've increase the free area which in people can<br />
earn and still keep the full pension and we have removed the whole of<br />
that income of the free area from the tax system completely.<br />
JL Okay, but in light of the wholesale taxes you have not made any<br />
alterations for them now. You have not compensated them now have<br />
you?<br />
PM: No, but if that feeds into the inflation rate that will automatically adjust<br />
the pension, one quarter later.<br />
JL Aren't you disturbed when you hear blokes like Martin Ferguson say in<br />
his own way I wouldn't want to be a worker who drives a leaded vehicle<br />
and smokes and drinks. I mean, he is supposed to be the epitomy of<br />
the sort of people he represents.<br />
PM: Yes, but where are the tax cuts going? They are going between<br />
$ 20,500 and $ 50,000, they are going to the great body of the<br />
workforce. Because you have got most workers now in those sorts of<br />
income ranges $ 20,500-$ 50,000. We are providing $ 3.8 billion worth<br />
of tax cuts, $ 8-10 a week once you are in that $ 20-30,000 area. That<br />
is exactly to his constituency, what does Martin ( Ferguson) want to<br />
see? People driving around in FJ Holdens with the mud guards falling<br />
off them and black smoke belting out the back and the kids all picking<br />
up the bit of lead inhalation saying, well, that's good policy well,<br />
thanks Martin, that is a great idea.<br />
JL There is no doubt about you, you certainly have not lost your<br />
wonderful turn of phrase, but I am not quite sure that that is what<br />
Martin Ferguson meant. </p>
<p>PM: No, but you know John, let me just make this clear about cars. This<br />
is a change which is going to take these increases in petrol take<br />
place over a period of years. That petrol increases 3 cents in August<br />
1993, it is 2 cents in February 1994, it is a further 2 cents in August<br />
1994 and 3 cents in February 1995.<br />
JL: Yes, so by 1995 it is up 10 cents.<br />
PM: It is up 10 cents. Unleaded is up 5 cents.<br />
JL: Why didn't you pressure the oil companies? They have got more<br />
money than Martin Ferguson's mates and my mates that listen to this<br />
radio program. Why didn't you pressure the oil companies to reduce<br />
the amount of lead, they have been asked to do it, they say they can<br />
do it, why didn't you hurry them up instead of hurrying up the<br />
Australian workers?<br />
PM: Look, markets equilibrate. What will happen is..<br />
JL: No, hang on, that wasn't a bad question I just asked.<br />
PM: No and I am just going to answer you and say this that markets work.<br />
If there are more unleaded cars around and more unleaded cars in the<br />
second hand car market, the price of unleaded second-hand cars will<br />
fall. Therefore the transition from a leaded car to an unleaded car will<br />
be nothing like that which is being argued by the Opposition and other<br />
people. The fact is, we have got one of the oldest vehicle fleets in the<br />
world, the average age of the non-commercial car fleet is 15 years.<br />
JL: Why?<br />
PM: You know why? Because they are too expensive.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: Now, you know why they are much cheaper? Because we brought<br />
tariffs downs.<br />
JL: Yes, but because they were too expensive, because people could not<br />
afford to buy them.<br />
PM: Now they are much cheaper because we have brought tariffs down.<br />
JL: OK, so when you have got the motor car that has got the motor in it<br />
that can only use leaded petrol and you go to sell it, haven't you<br />
noticed in your wide and varied life that used car salesmen tend to be<br />
opportunistic, don't you think the value of the car that they are going to<br />
trade in on the new one is going to drop considerably?<br />
PM: Well, this is a change over three years and during that same time, in<br />
each of those three years we will pay out $ 3.8 billion in each year </p>
<p>that is about $ 10,000 million in tax cuts which are going to cover off<br />
not going to cover off cover off, more than cover off those petrol price<br />
increases. Basically what it is, it is a relatively mild incentive over a<br />
fairly extended period of time for people to switch to unleaded fuel,<br />
which is what we should do anyway.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: It is good policy, good government, it is good economics, it is good<br />
sense and it is the right thing to do.<br />
JL Yes, but it would have been better if you had of leant on the oil<br />
companies. The oil companies have got much more money than the<br />
average ' Jo' and said to them listen, you fellas had better make some<br />
alternative arrangements, we have got to reduce the quantity of lead in<br />
these petrols so these cars can still run on them.<br />
PM: Your friend and mine, Ros Kelly, is doing that as Minister for the<br />
Environment.<br />
JL I see. How is she managing to do that?<br />
PM: They are talking about that very subject right now.<br />
JL OK, well she is not doing it fast enough.<br />
PM: Yes, I know, but again you can't put lower lead levels in fuels for old<br />
vehicles 15 year old vehicles which will knock and ping away when<br />
they have been designed basically for high octane leaded fuels.<br />
JL OK, but there is a conversion that is available to many, are you going<br />
to subsidise the purchase of the conversion?<br />
PM: I do not think people are going to be converting at these sorts of<br />
prices. If you go and say to somebody look, an $ 8-i10 a week tax cut,<br />
a $ 60 a fortnight home child care allowance being paid into the family<br />
on top of the basic family payment and the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement, for another 10 cents on leaded petrol over three years<br />
you are going to change your car some might. Three years later that<br />
car could be 15 years old and they will change it anyway.<br />
JL Yes, but if it is possible to have a conversion available, why doesn't<br />
the Government offer some sort of subsidy? If the main concern of<br />
Ros " I'll tell you how to lead your life" Kelly is the environment, why<br />
doesn't she then suggest to you that the Government subsidises the<br />
purchase of a device that would reduce the lead in the petrol and save<br />
the individual selling the car?<br />
PM: The better thing would be to try and get the chemical composition of<br />
the petrol such that the lead levels could be reduced and the motors<br />
still not knock or ping. I think that is what they are trying to do. </p>
<p>JL Well, they can do it.<br />
PM: We don't want to get to a stage remember those..<br />
JL Why don't you hurry them up?<br />
PM: films of India of a year or two ago, I haven't been there for years, but<br />
everywhere you look there are Morris Oxfords everywhere, old Morris<br />
Oxfords with the backside falling out of them. We do not want a<br />
country like that do we? With all these old wrecks running along the<br />
roads, where the braking system is poor, with the suspension systems<br />
had it, with a rust that is not even holding the structure, if they have an<br />
accident they fall to pieces.<br />
JL No, we said..<br />
PM: What is in it as a nation for us to keep that sort of thing going?<br />
JL Nothing, but there are others. You have cited an example which was<br />
questionable when it was brand new, yet alone when it was thirty years<br />
old. Anyway, do you feel happy with the result of the Budget and the<br />
reaction to the Budget?<br />
PM: Yes, because it recognises this point that is, that we need to do two<br />
things with the Budget. In the short-term, this year provide a stimulus<br />
to keep growth growing and give tax payers through the income tax<br />
system some relief from those marginal taxes while getting to 1 per<br />
cent of GOP deficit by 1996-97. In other words, as the economy starts<br />
to grow and investment starts to pick up, when we need that pick call<br />
on savings by 1996, we will have the Commonwealth Budget not<br />
putting its hand out as it is now for so much income. That is the thing<br />
about the Budget it is a four year approach covering off the stimulus<br />
in the short term and being prepared for higher investment and better<br />
saving in the medium term. If there was one message about the<br />
Budget I would say this John: it is an honest, decent attempt to deal<br />
with our economic circumstances to provide a bit of tax justice here<br />
now on the income side and get the spending balance in stimulatory<br />
terms right while looking after the medium term for business<br />
investment and employment in 1996.<br />
JL It doesn't do much for unemployment though does it?<br />
PM: As the economy grows it will. There is in the end no substitute for<br />
growth when you come to unemployment other than by looking after<br />
those currently unemployed with better labour market programs, and<br />
there is a healthy addition to spending in this Budget to take those<br />
programs up to half a million.. </p>
<p>JL Instead of looking after the people who are unemployed and unable to<br />
get a. job, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't it make more sense to look<br />
after the people who are in a position to give them a job?<br />
PM: We have done that by cutting the company rate to 33 per cent, by<br />
giving them two investment allowances, by giving them interest rates<br />
under 5 per cent.<br />
JL Yes, you cut the company rate, certainly you did that, but then you<br />
increase wholesale taxes, they will be picking up half of that again, you<br />
really haven't cut it the amount it says.<br />
PM: We have taken it, in the first instance, up 1 per cent. We are taking<br />
the 10 rate to 11 and the 20 to 21 and the 30 to 31 and a year later it<br />
goes another 1. That is no problem.<br />
JL But..<br />
PM: John, let me give you this point about business the reason the stock<br />
market is jumping around at the moment is because of the profit share<br />
in the economy; it is as high as their golden era of the 1960s for<br />
profits.<br />
JL Yes, I think the reason that it is jumping around at the moment is that<br />
all sorts of strange things that we never thought would be listed<br />
publicly have become listed publicly and people have got very excited<br />
and gone and bought them, that is what is making the stock market<br />
jump around.<br />
PM: The stock market is reacting just as profitably..<br />
JL Just back to these unemployed people. You say that we are doing a<br />
great deal to help the unemployed people, we are. By " we" we mean<br />
we, that the wage earners of Australia are doing a great deal to help<br />
the unemployed people. Many of them are concerned that a lot of the<br />
people who are unemployed obviously choose to be unemployed, but<br />
there are people there who genuinely want work. Why do we help the<br />
people who can get the work more than we help those people who<br />
don't have work?<br />
PM: Who are they?<br />
JL They are employers.<br />
PM: Employers!<br />
JL If you want more employees, you have got to have more employers.<br />
PM: Exactly. </p>
<p>JL But, you have got all sorts of strange rules and regulations that you<br />
pay more company tax, more payroll tax if you employ 15, you pay<br />
even more if you employ 20 people. We do more to hurt the people<br />
who want to give their mate a job than we do help them.<br />
PM: John, we have done more to help them. The business community has<br />
never had a set of indices like I mentioned to you, they have never had<br />
JL You ask the small business man that rings this radio program I can<br />
play you a tape of a bloke I talked to the other day who had 12 people<br />
employed, he wanted to employ 15, but his payroll tax was going to<br />
increase dramatically if he did so he decided to dump it. So, there is<br />
people doing without work because this bloke can not afford to employ<br />
them because of taxes that are levied on people who want to give<br />
other people work.<br />
PM: The best way to talk the employing sector of Australia is to look at the<br />
profit share in the economy, the proportion of national income going to<br />
profits. It is now as high as the golden years of the 1960s and going<br />
higher.<br />
JL And unemployment..<br />
PM: And what else can we do? Cut wages further?<br />
JL: I don't know, unemployment has never been higher.<br />
PM: Yes, but that is because of largely an international recession and a big<br />
structural change in the Australian economy. We are going from a<br />
closed, inwards economy that relied on tariffs to make uncompetitive<br />
things to an open, export orientated economy and there is a big<br />
change on the way through. People leaving some jobs and going to<br />
other jobs and being retrained for them.<br />
JL OK but it has also got a lot to do with the fact that people can not<br />
afford to employ other people and please don't argue the point<br />
because everyday I talk to people right across Australia who tell me<br />
that and they don't ring up..<br />
PM: It is not because of Commonwealth taxation.<br />
JL Well, it is because of payroll tax.<br />
PM: It is a factor, but again in the total mix of business costs..<br />
JL And it is because of superannuation and stupid training levies what a<br />
ridiculous nonsense that training levy is.<br />
PM: But wages, salaries, supplements and on-costs including training<br />
levies and superannuation, that is what's called national accounts </p>
<p>average weekly earnings, costs, were last this low in the 1 960s. What<br />
else can we do? Cut peoples' wages further..<br />
JL No, no that is the last thing I am saying. I'm saying make it easier for<br />
individuals to employ other individuals, make the market easier so if a<br />
woman wants to work Saturday and Sunday morning she can get a job<br />
without Martin Ferguson and his mob jumping up and down and saying<br />
how dare she work two days and only by paid x y z. If she wants to be<br />
that is her business.<br />
PM: John, these labour market programs we have which now touch about<br />
half the unemployed people, there is half a million in these programs<br />
so every year we are contacting half a million a large part of that are<br />
JobStart subsidies which are $ 220-270 a week which we pay to an<br />
employer to take an unemployed person on.<br />
JL Sure.<br />
PM: We are doing all that plus giving them low tax rates and a high profit<br />
share you have got say what else can we give them?<br />
JL That's right, you'll give them the JobStart thing so they put on<br />
somebody I have explored it all. You put on somebody, I looked at it<br />
for people on the farm and I have seen it happen they put people on<br />
and they say we get JobStart, the government is going to give us $ 200<br />
a -week, when the $ 200 a week runs out so does the person they<br />
employed. I couldn't tell you the number of calls I have had along<br />
those lines. They just say well, sorry I can't afford to keep you.<br />
PM: But those people get a bit of work experience 6 months to a year..<br />
JL: Six months.<br />
0 PM: They get training on the way through, their esteem rises, they feel they<br />
are useful to society, their confidence levels pick up.<br />
JL Where does their esteem go?<br />
PM: They do the jobs better, a lot of people keep those jobs and even if<br />
they don't they pick up other jobs.<br />
JL Where does their esteem go when they get fired? After six months of<br />
working and then suddenly where's the feel good go there?<br />
PM: But that is not true for the vast majority who keep the job that they have<br />
picked up and even those who may lose it at the end of the period, if<br />
they have been unemployed for a year then employed for six months<br />
and they are back in the workforce and back with the notion that they<br />
can do something and they have had some particular training, they go<br />
out and they generally find work. The success of these programs is<br />
pretty obvious. </p>
<p>JL I understand that you have difficulty with employment and with hours<br />
and with wages and things because of the fact that you have to<br />
perhaps not by choice, but historically be in bed with the ACTU and<br />
you have got to keep them happy as well.<br />
PM: But John, the poor old ACTU look, we have got wages at 1960 levels,<br />
we have got the profit share at 1960 levels, we have got inflation in an<br />
underlying sense with a ' 2 in front of it. How can you have a rampant<br />
ACTU with a 2 per cent inflation rate.<br />
JL No, but nobody is talking about wages. When something comes along<br />
that doesn't suit you, you pick up the wrong point. I would like to see<br />
wages increase and if people had more people employed and produce<br />
more and sold more, wages could increase. But we can't have an<br />
improvement in unemployment unless we have employment and we<br />
can't have employment unless we have got employers.<br />
PM: Exactly, and you will only get employers by growth and you will only<br />
get growth going by getting the right mix in the economy starting with,<br />
amongst other things, fiscal and budgetary policy.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: And that is what this is all about.<br />
JL OK, maybe we could have a quiet talk about that one day.<br />
PM: There are a couple of points, let me repeat.<br />
JL OK, we have got about two minutes.<br />
PM: If this is the lowest taxed country in the world -and itis -therefore<br />
JL In what world? In the whole world?<br />
PM: In the western world.<br />
JL But we are not in the western world any more, you have told us we<br />
have got to be in the Asian world.<br />
PM: No, we are a developed country, you can not run a highway system,<br />
road system, health system, phone system, education system of a<br />
developed country as we have on tax shares lower than we have it.<br />
We have the most efficient delivery of government services probably<br />
around the world.<br />
JL OK.<br />
PM: That means that is not standing in the way of growth. Now, the extent<br />
that the public sector was in deficit now and we want to get it back to a </p>
<p>22<br />
lower deficit by the middle ' 90s as investment picks up that is what<br />
the Budget is all about while keeping faith on those tax cuts and<br />
giving a stimulus this year which is going to help kick the place along<br />
right when we need it.<br />
JL Well, sort of keeping faith on the tax cuts.<br />
PM: We are paying the tax cuts, we have brought one lot forward and we<br />
are putting one lot back.<br />
JL Yes, well sort of keeping faith on them. Anyway thank you for keeping<br />
faith and being on this the most complained about and listened to radio<br />
program in the world.<br />
PM: God! you are a tough competitor. I'll tell you what, those single mums<br />
and supporting I will have to get you into a little seminar on this.<br />
JL Yes, well I am very happy to do that. Any woman who has been<br />
married and had some bounder to walk out on her and leave her in the<br />
cold, we have got to look after her. I would like to be able to look after<br />
her better, but the little floozies who want to go around and create<br />
children, bring them into the world and not treat them properly and if I<br />
was to give you some of the evidence that I have..<br />
PM: I am not endorsing that.<br />
JL You are not endorsing it directly.<br />
PM: I am not endorsing that, but I don't want to leave the children uncared<br />
for.<br />
JL No, it would be a very good idea if you said no single parent benefits<br />
for under 18 year olds unless you can nominate the father of the child.<br />
Pretty simple. Give it some thought.<br />
PM: Well, I think we had better get you in the public sector.<br />
JL Thank you very much.<br />
PM: You might have to take a wage cut to do it.<br />
JL Yes, I am happy to do that. Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: OK, good on you.<br />
JL Prime Minister Paul Keating.<br />
