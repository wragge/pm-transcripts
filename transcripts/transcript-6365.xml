PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OPENING OF ALLAN GRIFFITHS! ELECTORATE<br />
OFFICE, MELBOURNE, 12 APRIL 1984<br />
t Finally I simply want to say this to you o<br />
that there will be an election I believe either in December<br />
to March, end of this year, early next year. I've made that<br />
quite clear, I've made it quite clear that we will do that.<br />
because it's going to be best for this country to combine<br />
an election of the House of Representatives with the half<br />
Senate election which must be held by May of next year.<br />
People don't want to have an election now and then another<br />
election in twelve months'. time. If we do that that will<br />
be the 23rd time in the history of this country that you've<br />
had the House of Representatives and the half-Senate together.<br />
And my point to you is and I'd make also a further point that<br />
when that election is held it will be held in conjunction with<br />
a referendum which we'll put to the people of Australia<br />
asking them to endorse the conept of simultaneous elections<br />
so that never again will conservative governments be able<br />
to put elections our of kilter in the way which they've so<br />
consistently have in the past and get down to a regularity<br />
of an election. </p>
