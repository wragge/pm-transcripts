AUSTrRALIAN CtHLDREN'S TELEVISION FOUNDATIONConuonwealth<br />
and State Governments have combined to sujpu't<br />
the e-etablishment of the A\ ustralian Children's Trelevision<br />
Foundation. heFoundation will encouragje the development, production an<br />
trnsisio of Australian Children's television programs of<br />
; Uqu Commonwealth Government has made ant initial contribiition<br />
of'$ 250,000 to the F'oundation for the current financial year<br />
wbile Victoria, South Australia and the 14orthern Territory have<br />
rt~: 7. Coptriuted $ 200,000, $ 40,000 anid $ 3,700 respectively. New<br />
South'Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania are also-expectedk<br />
to support the Foundation financially.<br />
The roposal Is that the Coyrqonwcalth rmeets approximately<br />
hAl f the cost of the Foundation ( ie. up to $ 1.5 million) over<br />
three years with the States sharing the remaining $ 1.5 million.<br />
Iis expected that by then the r-oundation will be self -supporting.<br />
The Commonwealthi is committed to support the Foundation in<br />
1982/ 83 with continued fundingj in) 1983/ 84 anel 1984/ 85, conditional<br />
on its performance in the initial tw.. o years of operatior.-<br />
I : agree with the Foundation that children's television should<br />
reflect the diversity of interests, lifestyles, expectations,<br />
. special needs and multicultural heritage-of Au-stralian child~ rr,<br />
thug contribute to a sense of national identity.<br />
Television 6tations are required to show five hours of children's<br />
-pzograMs per week, ' About half of these are locally produced,<br />
But children's television lin Australia has a ie o~ e<br />
: t 1o; Verseas programs or regrettablyr shlow' re-rulns of many-old<br />
-programs. Whether this was because of cost or -unavailability of<br />
programs,. I do not know.<br />
NebVertheless, the Government believes that there has been a<br />
dscernible imnprovement in) cildren's; telIevision in the last<br />
few years Kirnce the establishment of the Australian) Broadcasting<br />
