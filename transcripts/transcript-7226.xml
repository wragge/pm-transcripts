    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>29 SeptemberÂ 1987</strong></p>
<p>Opposition obstruction to the Australia Card LegislationÂ would, unremedied, allow tax and welfare cheats to pocket up Â to $900 million a year at the expense of the rest of theÂ country. The Australia Card would have been the single mostÂ effective instrument for dealing with tax cheating andÂ welfare fraud.</p>
<p>Although the Government is prevented from proceeding withÂ the Australia Card Legislation because of the obstructiveÂ tactics of the opposition, and will not be proceeding withÂ it, we are determined not to allow existing tax cheating andÂ welfare fraud to go on unhindered as a-result of theÂ opportunistic actions of the Opposition parties.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Government has decided, as a matter ofÂ priority, to examine the use of the existing tax fileÂ numbering system administered ty the Â Australian TaxationÂ Office, as part of a package of measures to crack down on tax cheating and welfare fraud. The Government has beenÂ advised that, although the tax file numbering system wouldÂ not have the same integrity as the Australia Card, it wouldÂ still produce substantial net revenue gains over and above those that could be expected to flow from the other measuresÂ already being pursued by-the Government.</p>
<p>Measures which haveÂ been adopted already in the fight againstÂ tax cheating and welfare fraud are:</p>
<ul><li>The Prescribed Payments System, where the tax fileÂ number is now used effectively for information matching;</li>
<li>Stronger sanctions and prosecution provisions in the taxÂ system;</li>
<li>Self assessment, which has freed considerable AustralianÂ Taxation office staffing resources for more productiveÂ auditing;</li>
<li>Better targeted audits by the Australian TaxationÂ office, particularly in regard to corporations;</li>
<li>The provision of additional staffing and computerÂ resources to the Taxation office; and</li>
<li>A number of measures, including the formation ofÂ unemployment benefit review teams, to crack down onÂ welfare fraud.</li>
</ul><p>While these measures are proving useful in combatting taxÂ cheating and welfare fraud, honest taxpayers are stillÂ carrying a disproportionate burden inflicted upon them byÂ those unwilling to pay their fair share.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in addition to the possible extended use of theÂ tax file numbering system, the Government is pursuing theÂ following measures:</p>
<ul><li>Acceptance or extension of most of the recommendationsÂ of the Review of Systems for Dealing with Fraud on theÂ Commonwealth, and the establishment of a Fraud ControlÂ Committee to monitor the development and implementationÂ of fraud control mechanisms within Government agenciesÂ ( a separate media statement is being released by theÂ Attorney-General);</li>
<li>Legislation, being developed in consultation with theÂ Australian Bankers Association and representativeÂ organisations of other financial institutions, providingÂ for the reporting by banks and other financialÂ institutions of large cash transactions, in the fightÂ against organised crime and tax evasion; and</li>
<li>The development of a National Births, Deaths andÂ Marriages Register as recommended by all members of theÂ Joint Select Committee.</li>
</ul><p>The Government remains fully committed to the protection ofÂ civil liberties and acknowledges the need, quite apart fromÂ the Australia Card issue, for effective protection ofÂ personal prioacy in relation to data held by governmentÂ agencies. To this end it will proceed with privacyÂ legislation and the establishment of a Data ProtectionÂ Agency. The ambit of operation of the Agency will not needÂ to be as broad as when the Australia Card was contemplated.</p>
<p>The Government calls upon the Opposition parties toÂ co-operate in cracking down on tax cheating and welfareÂ fraud, particularly in view of their previous support for anÂ upgraded tax file numbering system.Â </p>
