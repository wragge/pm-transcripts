TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ST PATRICK'S DAY BREAKFAST, MELBOURNE<br />
17 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well that's a moot point. We can only be ambiguous<br />
about ourselves and how we represent ourselves for just<br />
so long.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have spoken about the flag now on a<br />
number of occasions, what action would you choose to<br />
change the flag?<br />
PM: Well it's not a matter of what action I think the<br />
Government: would wish to take. It's a matter of, on<br />
these matt~ ers, what feeling there is in the community,<br />
and that feeling being prompted, tested and thought<br />
about.<br />
J: But mustn't you now do something about it? Doesn't it<br />
require a constitutional change or anything like that?<br />
PM: No, we all, understand the constitutional things,<br />
Michelle ( Grattan).<br />
J: You said rLOt too long, is 2001 too long?<br />
PM: Well let's wait and see.<br />
J: Why won't you tell us how long?<br />
PM: Well I have given you an answer.<br />
J: How do you assess the community's feeling about this?<br />
PM: Well I think it is changing, don't you? I mean, .1<br />
think that it is changing, I think that it is important </p>
<p>to talk about these symbols and people are now thinking<br />
about them, that's good.<br />
J: How do you know when the debate is ended, that it is<br />
time for a change?<br />
PM: We all know, those of us who have got our fingers on<br />
the pulse know these things.<br />
J: What will happen if the community want to keep the<br />
flag, will you be happy with that decision?<br />
PM: I would be very surprised if in the long run that is<br />
their view.<br />
J: Mr Keating, yesterday's big fall on the Tokyo stock<br />
market, what are the implications for Australia?<br />
PM: There has been a correction in the Tokyo stock market<br />
now for quite a long time. The fact that it has<br />
dropped under 20,000 is probably not that remarkable,<br />
it has been hovering around there for quite a while, it<br />
has come off the very high prices of the late 1980s,<br />
and this is the reason why most countries are now in a<br />
recession. We' had to come off this high spending, high<br />
credit growth, great speculation of the ' 80s. And as<br />
the stock market, the forces of the world deflate, come<br />
down, it's produced a recession world wide.<br />
J: There are now major fears of a recession in Japan,<br />
given the Nikkei is at a 5 year low. What are the<br />
implications of that<br />
PM: I don't think there will be a significant recession for<br />
Japan, but certainly a slowing in growth, that will<br />
have an impact on Australia. But again, we are luckily<br />
in the fastest-growing part of the world, which is now<br />
growing between 5 and 7 per cent most years. So while<br />
the world growth is slower, our part of the world is<br />
quite fast, Japan notwithstanding.<br />
J: How great an impact on Australia is it likely to have?<br />
Could it in fact slow down our own recovery?<br />
PM: Well it could have some impact on our raw material<br />
supplying industries, but again they have been<br />
diversifying their markets, and where once Japan was<br />
entirely critical to the extracting industries, it is<br />
still important, but we have the diversified<br />
substantially.<br />
J: Is there any danger that it could put us back into a<br />
recession?<br />
PM: No. The thing is we have been in recession, and we're<br />
in recession for largely the same reasons the United<br />
States, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, France and many<br />
other countries are, and that is that we couldn't come </p>
<p>off the hiLgh speculation of the 180s without a thud,<br />
without some skin off ourselves.<br />
J: Conrad Black wants more then 15 per cent of Fairfax,<br />
would you let him do that?<br />
PM: Look, we are not here to go round the world for sport.<br />
J: Do you have any expectations for National Accounts?<br />
PM: Well I donL't say expectational things about the<br />
National Accounts. They are notoriously difficult to<br />
predict and now for this time, there will be for the<br />
first time three measures of national income. So that<br />
may change one's compacity to predict, whatever that<br />
compacity was. So we will wait and see this morning<br />
when it will all be revealed.<br />
J: What are your thoughts on South Africa?<br />
PM: Well it's not a matter of thought, it's a matter of<br />
what happens.<br />
3: Mr keating, if, the GDP outcome is as expected, do you<br />
agree with some commentators who say that in fact it<br />
wouldn't be that Australia is in a recovery, because of<br />
the change in the way that they are going to calculate<br />
it?<br />
PM: Well let's wait and see what happens. The Statistician<br />
is looking for what he thinks is a more reliable<br />
measure of product and growth and he is entitled to<br />
those interpretative changes. So we will see what<br />
today's figrures reveal.<br />
J: Do you think we need to accept more Japanese investment<br />
in order to trade?<br />
PM: Two years ago our capital inflow was about 90 per cent<br />
debt and about ' 10 per cent equity, now it is about<br />
per cent equity and 20 per cent debt. So it has<br />
changed dramatically and part of that change has been<br />
from Japan. 11<br />
J: Do we need to accept more investment, though? Ralph<br />
Evans said<br />
PM: Well we've just, largely taken away a large component of<br />
the foreign investment policy for that simple point, to<br />
encourage more investment, we want to encourage more<br />
investment for Australia.<br />
J: What if the Japanese don't invest here?<br />
PM: Well others do, it is true that Japanese do and others<br />
do, and the fact is that's changed in character now<br />
enormously i~ n two years. I mean it is a huge lift in<br />
equity. </p>
