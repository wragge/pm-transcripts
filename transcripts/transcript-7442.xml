PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
WORLD HERITAGE LISTING OF TASMANIAN FORESTS<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Commonwealth and Tasmanian<br />
Governments have agreed to nominate jointly for world<br />
Heritage Listing large areas of the Lemonthyme and Southern<br />
Forests, as decided by the Commonwealth on 4 August 1988.<br />
The Walls of Jerusalem National Park and the Central Plateau<br />
Conservation Area will also be jointly nominated for world<br />
Heritage Listing by the two governments.<br />
The Denison Spires, commonly known as the Hole in the<br />
Doughnut, will be declared a State National Park under<br />
Tasmanian legislation.<br />
Magnificent tall trees in the Lemonthyme and Southern<br />
Forests will now be preserved forever for the enjoyment of<br />
future generations.<br />
Today's announcement follows my Government's decisions to<br />
nominate for World Heritage Listing Kakadu National Park<br />
Stage 2, NSW Rainforests, tlluru and the Wet Tropics of North<br />
East Queensland. In a world threatened by environmental<br />
degradation Australia is now showing the way in the<br />
conservation of nature.<br />
Achieving the agreement of the State Government to joint<br />
nomination of these areas of Tasmania is a tremendous<br />
result, one about which both governments can take a great<br />
deal of satisfaction.<br />
I pay tribute to Premier Gray and his colleagues for the<br />
manner and spirit in which they approached the negotiations.<br />
Our two governments share the objective of maximising job<br />
opportunities in Tasmania. To this end the Commonwealth is<br />
providing a $ 50 million package over five years for<br />
plantation development, timber industry training, access to<br />
alternative veneer resources and other industry development<br />
initiatives as prescribed in the industry agreement reached<br />
by Senator Cook and Mr Groom.<br />
The Commonwealth has also agreed, in principle, to give an<br />
export licence to Huon Forest Products at a smaller level<br />
than that requested, and is requiring that operations by<br />
Australian Paper Manufacturers and Tasmanian Pulp and Forest<br />
Products at Triabunna do not receive significantly smaller<br />
allocations from the State Government. 13913 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The agreement is attached. It meets very well the<br />
Commonwealth's objectives of environmental protection and<br />
job creation in Tasmania. It should not be seen as a win or<br />
a loss for any party in the debate. But it is a victory for<br />
environmental protection and the responsible development of<br />
our natural resources.<br />

<p>HEADS OF AGREEMENT<br />
28 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
These Heads of Agreement record understandings and<br />
undertakings reached between the Commonwealth and the<br />
of Tasmania in relation to the resolution of the issu<br />
arising out of the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests Ir<br />
and other matters.<br />
It is hereby agreed between the Commonwealth and the<br />
of Tasmania that:<br />
1) Apart from the Denison Spires, the area corns<br />
known as the " Hole in the Doughnut", those a<br />
specified by the Commonwealth Government's D<br />
of 4 August 1986 ( see Attachment A) will be<br />
nominated by the Commonwealth and the State<br />
World Heritage listing. Questions relatingt<br />
management, funding and related matters are<br />
the subject of further discussion. The<br />
commonwealth will provide tunding support,<br />
precise level being the subject of further<br />
discussion, in the normal context of the cul<br />
management arrangements for the existing W02<br />
Heritage Area. State<br />

2) The Hole in the Doughnut is to be the subject of<br />
State protection as a National Park under Tasmanian<br />
legislation.<br />
3 916 </p>
<p>3) The Commonwealth will provide the proposed Huon<br />
Forest Products Woodchip Mill with a woodchip<br />
export licence to permit Huon Forest Products to<br />
operate at a wood intake of not less than 350,000<br />
tonnes per annum of roundwood and up to 400,000<br />
tonnes per annum of roundwood as available on a<br />
sustained yield basis, plus such quantities as can<br />
be realised from other sources on a short term<br />
basis, such as fire damaged material, plantation<br />
establishment, sawmill residues, etc.<br />
It is agreed that the allocation to Australian<br />
Paper Manufacturers will be at 185,000 tonnes per<br />
annum of roundwood and that the Tasmanian Pulp and<br />
Forest Products Triabunna Woodchip Mill will<br />
receive roundwood allocations at a level not less<br />
than 775,000 tonnes per annum.<br />
4) The Commonwealth agrees to an increase in the<br />
sustainable yield of pulpwood from Tasmanian<br />
forests to the level assessed by the Tasmanian<br />
Forestry Commission, being 790,000 tonnes of<br />
roundwood per annum above the level agreed in the<br />
Memorandum of Understanding.<br />
The Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments share<br />
the objective of maintaining a viable veneer<br />
industry. To this end, both Governments agree to<br />
work jointly to develop access to alternative<br />
veneer resource ( outside the agreed world Heritage<br />
boundaries), new products and new markets. The<br />
Commonwealth agrees to provide funds to enable this<br />
to occur. 39.17 </p>
<p>3.<br />
6) As a result of the reduced availability of sawlogs<br />
for the milling industry consequent upon listing of<br />
the area in paragraph 1, the Commonwealth will<br />
assist the State with the rationalisation and<br />
reconstruction of the forest industry. The<br />
Commonwealth will make available funding for this<br />
purpose from the agreed package as detailed in<br />
paragraph 8 below. The manner in which this<br />
assistance is to be applied will be the subject of<br />
further discussion between the two Governments. 9<br />
7) To encourage the identification, segregation and<br />
recovery of veneer grade material, the Commonwealth<br />
will make available a bounty of $ 10 per cubic metre<br />
for veneer logs produced and delivered to Tasmanian<br />
veneer mills. This figure is subject to variation<br />
after an assessment of its effectiveness.<br />
8) The Commonwealth will make available, in a manner<br />
to be agreed between the two Governments, over a<br />
five year period beginning on 1 January 1989, a<br />
package totalling $ 50 million, including:<br />
up to $ 30 million to be paid to the State in<br />
five equal instalments and to be expended by<br />
the State for plantations and for other<br />
suitable developments agreed by the<br />
Commonwealth and the State consistent with the<br />
forestry development elements of the<br />
Cook/ Groom package ( a copy of which is at<br />
Attachment B).<br />

development, marketing and design, including<br />
specialised training in furniture and craft<br />
design and manufacture.<br />
3918 </p>
<p>4.<br />
an untied grant of $ 8 million, payable before<br />
June 1989, to offset sunk costs of forest<br />
roading and management planning incurred by<br />
the Tasmanian Forestry Commission.<br />
the balance to be provi led for the purposes<br />
outlined in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 above and<br />
for other agreed purpores.<br />
9) The Commonwealth and State -ndorse the elements of<br />

package detailed above will be quarantined for the<br />
purposes of assessing Tasi ~ ia's entitlements to<br />
all other forms of Common-alth financial<br />
assistance, including wit -it limitation Financial<br />
Assistance Grants, the Lc , n Council Program, Global<br />
Borrowing Authority and . y specific purpose<br />
payments.<br />
11) The Prime Minister has . vited the State to submit<br />
a list of proposals ide rifying activities with<br />
substantial ongoing Con -, nwealth employment which<br />
the State considers to io capable of being moved to<br />
Tasmania. The Prime M rister undertakes, if such<br />
proposals are practica le, to take up the matter<br />
positively with Minisi rs, Departments and<br />
Agencies.<br />
12) The Commonwealth und( takes not to initiate any<br />
further inquiries in' forestry in Tasmania or to<br />

Heritage listing wit:, out the concurrence of the<br />
Tasmanian Governmen' 3919 </p>
<p>13) The Commonwealth agrees that logging can continue<br />
