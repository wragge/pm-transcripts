welcome the decision by union convenors in Dampier today,<br />
to recommend to their members the concept of an Iron Ore<br />
Industry Council.<br />
This represents an important step towards the establishment<br />
of a new tripartite Council, to improve consultation among<br />
the parties and so to improve industrial relations in the<br />
Pilbara.<br />
My Government is firmly committed to strengthening the<br />
competitive position of the Australian iron ore industries.<br />
The improvement of industrial relations in the Pilbara is<br />
one important aspect of thi:.; strengthening.<br />
Governments, employers and unions all share an obligation<br />
to consult closely on all aspects of the economic performance<br />
of the industry, so as to avoid unnecessary industrial<br />
disputation and damage to the industry's competitive position.<br />
I welcome today's progress towards the establishment of<br />
i. mproved mechanisms for cont; nl. tation wi. thin this major industry. </p>
