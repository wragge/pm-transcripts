BROADCAST BROADCAST BY THE PRIiME MINTISTER ( RT. HON. , ENZIES)<br />
OVER NATIONAL STATIONS AT 7,1.5 om<br />
THURSDAY, 3th NOVEiBER, 1961<br />
In an earlier broadcast I spoke to you about rural<br />
policy and about the great importance of maintaining and increasing<br />
our production and export of rural products.<br />
On this occasion I want to say something about our<br />
secondary industries. It is of the greatest moment that Australia<br />
should continue to develop her secondary industries which, I am<br />
happy to say. have increased most notably during the last 10 years.<br />
From a domestic point of view, the great development of manufacturing<br />
in Australia has put us in a position to resist depressions much<br />
more effectively than before. The great and terrible depression<br />
of 1929-33 came about because our manufactures were under-developed<br />
and, when the impact of the de-ression which began overseas reached<br />
Australia, we found that our prices for wool and wheat and so on<br />
fell away to a pathetically low level and thct great unemployment<br />
occurred which the state of our manufacturing development did not<br />
enable us to take up.<br />
When I say great unemployment, I am referring to the<br />
historic fact that unemployment in Australia in 1932 reached as<br />
high as 30 percent. To put this position metaphorically, we were<br />
not, as a nation, standing scuarely on both feet. Events since<br />
have corrected this matter. Primary and secondary industry have<br />
come increasingly to discover their inter-dependence. Australia<br />
has now a broadly-based and well-balanced economy in which some<br />
blow to one part of the structure does not imperil the structure<br />
as a whole. One of my government's great policies is to develop<br />
this same kind of balance in our export trade. Today our export<br />
income is derived to a major degree from the export of primary<br />
products. As they have prices which fluctuate in the world's<br />
markets, and as, at home, they are subject to drought or flood,<br />
so our export income tends to fluctuate and governments find it<br />
necessary to adopt from time to time emergency measures to prevent<br />
our overseas balances from falling too low. The ultimate answer<br />
to this problem is to develop a large export of manufactured and<br />
processed goods which, side by side with growing exports of primary<br />
products, will give to us the kind of international balance which<br />
we need. Having this in mind, the Government has initiated various<br />
measure to encourage manufacturing export, That export must, of<br />
course, be based upon a sound policy, at home, of protecting<br />
economic and efficient Australian industry through the Australian<br />
Tariff Board. Wo are very conscious of the need for such protection.<br />
We firmly believe that the only reliable form of protection is<br />
through tariffs made after investigation through the Australian<br />
Tariff Board. Impoi: t Licensing is appropriate only to emergencies<br />
affecting our financial balances, and affords no sound basis for<br />
long-range protection. But the tariff system itself is quite<br />
capable of improvement. Last year we established means for getting<br />
temporary tariffs for industries which might suffer serious damage<br />
if tariff protection was delayed. until the ordinary and necessarily<br />
fairly slow processas of the Tariff Board had been gone through,<br />
We will continue to watch this latter, particularly in relation<br />
to some Australian industries which just cannot have effective<br />
production and efficient and reasonable cost levels unless they<br />
can maintain a continuing high volume of output. This particular<br />
problem will engage our attention after the election when we<br />
review the work of the Tariff Board. But one of the things that<br />
will, we believe, help the manufacturer in his costs would be the </p>
<p>Jncr-ase in his turn-over by the development of export business.<br />
There can be no doubt that the Australian has skill and energy<br />
not inferior to that of larger manufacturing countries. What we<br />
want is in effect more business. It is for these reasons that<br />
we have had trade missions containing businessmen go abroad,<br />
organised trade ships, have greatly expanded the Trade Commissioner<br />
Services and the trade publicity vote and so on.<br />
We have also provided substantial tax incentives<br />
to the export of manufactures, partly by remissions of pay-roll<br />
tax and partly by special allowances for promotional expenditure<br />
and activities overseas.<br />
The Export Payments Insurance Corporation, which we<br />
set up in 1956, has already insured export transactions into no<br />
less then 10 countries.<br />
The Export Development Council which we set up and<br />
which contains distinguished representatives of Australian<br />
manufacturing has felt that there are real prospects for increasing<br />
exports by establishing Australian warehouses in selected markets<br />
overseas. We are proposing to examine this as promptly as possible.<br />
We are not, of course, contemplating that an Australian Government<br />
warehouse will be set up in some other country so that the<br />
Australian Government may do the export business. But there are<br />
indications that exporters who would not feel justified in carrying<br />
stocks in an overseas country in warehouses of their own,<br />
might be willing to co-operate with other exporters in using<br />
common warehousing facilities. Every businessman knows that<br />
very frequently in another country the ability to make a sale is<br />
contingent upon the ability to make further suuplies available<br />
quickly if the first sale proves satisfactory. If it becomes<br />
necessary to communicate with Australia and if there is some delay<br />
getting further supplies further business may be missed. Thus,<br />
from this point of view, we have been directing our attention to<br />
this admittedly novel proposal. But by whatever means it can<br />
be achieved, it is, we believe, essential that over the next<br />
or 20 years Australia should develop a very large export market<br />
for the products of her secondary industries. When that day<br />
comes, two advantages will accrue.<br />
The first will be to the manufacturing industries<br />
themselves, which by an expansion of their total volume in<br />
production will be able to keoe their unit costs on a comoetitive<br />
basis. This is frequently difficult when their market is<br />
limited and domestic. The other advantage will be to the balance of<br />
payments, a matter to which I h,. ve already referred. It would<br />
tend powerfully to eliminate those periodical fluctuations in<br />
our overseas trade balances . ihich give rise to special measures<br />
to restrain imports or, as was the case a year ago, special<br />
economic restrictions at home in order to reduce the demand for<br />
imported goods to a level at which our overseas funds can sustain<br />
them. In spite6f its occasional vicissitudes, the history<br />
of manufacturing in Australia has been one of immense achievement.<br />
Without it we could never have sustained the immigration programme<br />
of the post-war years, or the remarkably high level of employment<br />
which has characterised our own period of office. The Government<br />
is not under temptation to forget these matters or to ignore<br />
the very great importance of developing sound and progressive<br />
secondary industry based for the most part upon our rapidly<br />
developing national resources. </p>
