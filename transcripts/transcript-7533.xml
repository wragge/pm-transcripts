PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HAYDN SARGENT, RADIO 4BC,<br />
17 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
HS: Prime Minister welcome to the studio.<br />
PM: Thank you Haydn, it's always good to be back with you.<br />
HS: What's happened to the Labor Party in Canberra because some<br />
of the rank and f ile kinda feel you've lost touch with them and<br />
you seem to be rubbing shoulders with the big boys, the Alan<br />
Bonds and...<br />
PM; Oh that's history, I mean it's 1989 there was a bit of that<br />
talk at the beginning of 1988 but none of that talk around now.<br />
HS; What about the story on the other night on Alan Bond<br />
suggesting that he gets a fairly decent deal as far as taxes are<br />
concerned while the rest of us are shelling out pay and you earn.<br />
PM1 Yes well I think Paul Keating got sort of sick and tired of<br />
getting the story out there, let me repeat it. You can't just<br />
look at what tax is paid by a holding company, if the tax has<br />
been paid by the operating company and this has come through into<br />
the holding company, you don't tax twice. Now that's not to say<br />
that there hasn't been some benefit to Bond and some other<br />
companies because of offshore tax saving operations, now what<br />
we've done, and what should have been done by previous<br />
governments, what we've done is bring in the legislation which<br />
will come in next year to close off those tax havens.<br />
HS: So there'll be no little Cook Island offices...<br />
PM: That's absolutely right, and we have more than any other<br />
government before increased the number of tax auditors, we've<br />
actually put them into the big companies, stationed them in<br />
there, to chase these big fellows and we're doing that against<br />
the opposition of the Opposition, they're saying attacking the<br />
Commissioner, Trevor Boucher, and all these things we're doing<br />
they're saying it's an intrusion, well we're going to keep on<br />
intruding because we believe the big fellows have got to pay<br />
their tax, and we'll do everything we can to ensure that they do.<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
HS: And where does that leave Mr and Mrs Average Australia come<br />
July 1 with tax cuts?<br />
PM: Mr and Mrs Average Australia, and you've put it right<br />
because the tax cuts are going to be directed at lower middle<br />
income Australians who've bore a lot of burden, they'll be<br />
getting a tax cut from 1st of July. And I'll be announcing them<br />
in April.<br />
HS: Wage increases?<br />
PM: Yes, we're negotiating with the ACTU and we're talking with<br />
employers as well. There'll be wage increases, but they will be<br />
historically different in that they will be associated with the<br />
restructuring of Awards, something that's never been tackled<br />
before. We're going to have an Award restructuring process which<br />
will mean the elimination of hundreds of different<br />
classifications. We'll have an Award structure which will be<br />
relevan, to modern industry, which will mean that the basis of<br />
training and retraining of people in the workforce will be made<br />
easier. There'll be career structures and the actual<br />
classifications will be relevant to the way in which modern<br />
industry is conducted. Within that process there will be wage<br />
increases, increases which are affordable and sustainable and<br />
which over the longer-term will bring about significant increases<br />
in productivity.<br />
HSz Do you wish it was possible to f ind a way to divorce the<br />
interest rates for the home buyers from the kind of ups and downs<br />
of the economy?<br />
PM: Well you've got to look at what's happened, you see in fact<br />
the situation before used to be that you had an artificial sort<br />
of environment created for the area of trading available for<br />
lending for housing, and you had a thirteen and a half percent<br />
fixed rate, but the realities were that that covered in very few<br />
cases the whole of loan. People had to top up that loan at that<br />
pegged rate by going out and getting a cocktail loan and pay very<br />
very high rates for the rest of their loan which made it on<br />
average much higher than the thirteen and a half percent. Now by<br />
freeing up the banking system and enabling the trading banks as<br />
well as the savings banks to get into this area, it's meant that<br />
people haven't had to have recourse to that cocktail a~ oroach so<br />
on average you haven't had the sort of increase that you could<br />
have expected. it's interesting to note that over the last / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
twelve months the interest rates have increased by about 7%.<br />
They've gone from about thirteen and a half percent to fourteen<br />
and a half percent over the last 12 months, which is about in<br />
line with the general increase in the cost of living. The big<br />
factor as you know has been Haydn in the increase in land prioes,<br />
that's what we're trying to tackle now in co-operation with the<br />
States. HS: Yes, with due respects though, I mean for instance in<br />
Queensland last year they built 35,000 houses. The deal done<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States on land release is not<br />
going to really ease that land problem significantly, it will<br />
help a little bit but-it really isn't a big enough...<br />
PH: No, but what you've got to understand is that we just<br />
didn't tackle the problem of land supply. What we've done is to<br />
make available now a very large number of blocks within the next<br />
five years which will be the equivalent of about 15 new suburbs<br />
and the same sort of amount again this time around, but as well<br />
as doing that what we've got agreement with the State Governments<br />
and Local Governments is to tackle other areas..... one of the<br />
problems has been the whole process of zoning and regulation. I<br />
mean people are getting tied up for unconscionable periods by the<br />
time it's taken in many areas of local government who makes the<br />
decisions about how land will be available for housing.<br />
HS: Don't you think in a sense by making the house the only<br />
capital gains tax free investment, that that has fuelled the<br />
rising price of land?<br />
PH: There is an argument that you know the pure economists say<br />
you should have capital gains on the house, but we're not going<br />
to do that.<br />
HSI I'm not recommending that....<br />
PM: No and I'm making it clear that we're not going to be doing<br />
it. HSB: No, inadvertantly....<br />
PM! Just let me make this point, unfortunately I don't think<br />
justice was done to Paul Keating when he raised the issue, so I<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
repeat that for those who want the separate quarter-acre block,<br />
that's beaut and we should provide that. But for those who<br />
would prefer the option of the medium density areas, well we've<br />
got to have a changed attitude amongst local governments to<br />
ensure that that's made possible.<br />
HS: Prime Minister I understand that the research people<br />
suggest that the Labor Party's appeal to the women voters has<br />
weakened a little bit and you have encouraged your Ministers to<br />
take a little more notice of the womens opinions and w. omens<br />
questions, the womens voice, what prompted that to happen?<br />
P1 Well look I always call the shots, there's nothing, there's<br />
no hidden agenda and I'm not being devious about this, the fact<br />
is yes there's been a bit of a widening of the gender gap.<br />
There's been more men-vote, the fact that more men support us<br />
than do women. Now I'm disappointed by that because it's<br />
recognised by womens groups in this country that no government<br />
has done as much on womens issues and on general issues which<br />
affect women than we have done. What r say, and what I ask your<br />
listeners, particularly your women listeners to understand it's<br />
not only what we've done for the women, but the thing that I'm<br />
proudest of is that as far as their daughters are concerned, the<br />
future adult women of this country, as a result of the things<br />
that we've done in education, eliminating discrimination in<br />
education, and eliminating discrimination in employment, the<br />
young women, the girls of today are going to grow up into an<br />
Australia that we've created where those girls will have a<br />
greater range of opportunity than any previous generation of<br />
Australian women. Now we're proud of that and I think if<br />
Australian women really had that message communicated to them<br />
that they would ref lect that in their support, so I have got to<br />
accept, and my Ministers have got to accept, and all my Party<br />
members have to accept some fault, responsibility for not having<br />
' got that story across sufficiently.<br />
HS: Prime Minister we're you disappointed that the developers<br />
pulled out of the Tasmanian paper mill project?<br />
PM: Not surprised, my disappointment is that they were not<br />
prepared to co-operate in the processes of further environmental<br />
studies and in acceptance of their responsibilities to enable the<br />
mill to go ahead. We want to see the processing of our raw<br />
materials, we want to see greater value added, but I want to make </p>
<p>it clear to your listeners while I'm proud of the fact that We've<br />
created jobs at twice the rate of the rest of the world, so we've<br />
accepted the responsibilities of growth, the Hawke Government is<br />
not going to have development at any cost, at any price. I am<br />
not going to sacrifice the environment of this country for future<br />
generations and the fact was the best independent advice we had<br />
from the CSIRO, which is highly respected, was that this<br />
government could not responsibly allow the mill to go ahead on<br />
those watered-down guidelines. It probably would have involved<br />
more money for the developers so what, you can't short cut the<br />
future generations by just scrimping on inferior technology now.<br />
You see, let me give your listeners some idea of what was<br />
W* inGvoovlveerdnm, enut ndaegr retehde wtoa tearendd-dowwhnic h prtohpeo svale ntthuraetr st hein sTiasstmedan iaonn<br />
maintaining. Each day, each single day, 13 ton~ nes of organic<br />
chlorines were going to be pumped into the ocean, which could<br />
have affected the whole food chain, which could have put at<br />
Jeopardy the maritime industries and the reputation of this<br />
country as a prime producer of uncontaminated food products. Now<br />
I'm not going to buy that and I don't think Australians would<br />
want me to buy that, and the f act that Gray, supported by John<br />
Howard, are saying it should have gone ahead. Okay, i f they<br />
want to be short term thinkers in that way, they can. Now there<br />
are better standards and higher standards being followed in other<br />
parts of the world, and I'm not going to cop inferior standards<br />
which can jeopardise the future of this country. Now I don't<br />
believe that means that in the future there can't be mills in<br />
this country, but the mills that are going to be here are going<br />
to be of the highest possible environmental protection standards.<br />
HSI Prime Minister, I don't know if you've heard of a suburb<br />
0 here on the southside of Brisbane called Kingston, but over many<br />
years companies have dumped toxic waste there and it's now<br />
bubbling up out of the ground, and the State Government has put<br />
health workers in there, they've done drilling tests and they're<br />
in the process of trying to buy back I think about 21 houses that<br />
have been affected, is the Federal Government able or interested<br />
in becoming financially involved in trying to rescue the people<br />
of Kingston?<br />
PM; We cannot accept the financial responsibility for areas of<br />
State Government responsibility. What we've got to do is to make<br />
sure that in regard to these sorts of issues in the future, that </p>
<p>-6<br />
we not only ourselves expend money, but we mobilise State<br />
Governments and private industry to make sure that into the<br />
future we don't pollute and destroy the environment for future<br />
generations. Where problems of past pollution have occurred<br />
that manifestly is the responsibility of the State Government and<br />
they've got to get their priorities to deal with that.<br />
H-S: Technically you see it's probably the local governent and<br />
the local council, but in this particular predicament I don't<br />
think the local council can foot the bill because the problem is<br />
so immense.<br />
PM: Yes well the State Government will have to be of assistance<br />
there, we've got to use the scarce resources of the Federal<br />
Government to deal with those future areas of threat to our<br />
population.... HS: So you're saying no money from Canberra?<br />
PM: Well we haven't had the approach because I think the local<br />
governments, the State Government recogniseB where the<br />
responsibility lies in this.<br />
HS: Mr Hawke it was good to talk to you, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you Haydn, it's always good to be with you and your<br />
listeners. </p>
