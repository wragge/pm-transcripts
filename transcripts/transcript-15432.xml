    <content><![CDATA[<p>I would like to congratulate Anna Bligh on her endorsement as the next Premier of Queensland.</p>
<p>She will lead a great state, but one with many challenges ahead particularly in the areas of water management and health. </p>
<p>Today's endorsement also presents an ideal opportunity for the new administration to sweep away former Premier Peter Beattie's undemocratic plan to amalgamate local councils without consulting the people.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has introduced legislation to change the Commonwealth Electoral Act to ensure the people of Queensland can participate in plebiscites in their local council areas on the amalgamation plans.</p>
<p>These plebiscites will be funded by the Australian Government through a postal ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.</p>
<p>It should be the first priority of Premier-elect Anna Bligh to repeal the amalgamation laws. The current local council boundaries should remain in place for March's planned local government elections.</p>
<p>This is the only appropriate course of action for the people of Queensland.</p>
