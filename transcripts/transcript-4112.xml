PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS7 May 1976<br />
European Earthquake<br />
I was shocked at the reports of the earthquake that<br />
has caused chaos throughout a large part of Europe.<br />
Me Government Departments ( Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
and Department of Post and Telecommunications) have been<br />
asked to assist-in arranging contact and information<br />
concerning Australians that could be affected.<br />
The Australian Government deplores the loss of life<br />
and the devastation that leaves families homeless.<br />
To the many thousands of friends and relatives of the<br />
victims particularly those living in the heavy migrant<br />
populated cities of Australia I extend my government's<br />
sincere sympathies. 000000000 </p>
