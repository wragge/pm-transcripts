Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
A number of changes in top Public Service posts<br />
will take place as a result of the retirement on 22 July of. the Chairman<br />
of the Repatriation Commission, Brigadier Sir Frederick Chilton.<br />
Mr Richard Kingsland, who has been Secretary of the Department of<br />
the Interior since 1963, will succeed Sir Frederick as Chairman of the<br />
Repatriation Commission. The Secretary of the Department of External<br />
Territories, Mr G. H. Warwick Smith, will take over as Permanent<br />
Head of the Department of the Interior, and at External Territories, he<br />
will be succeeded by Mr David Hay, who has been Administrator of<br />
Papua and New Guinea since 1967.<br />
The new Administrator will be Mr L. W. Johnson, who<br />
has been Assistant Administrator ( Services) since 1966.<br />
Sir Frederick Chilton has been Chairman of the<br />
Repatriation Commission since 1958. He was a gifted and imaginative<br />
administrator, and established and maintained good relationships with<br />
ex-servicemen's organisations, the medical profession and other<br />
related authorities. Mr Warwick Smith has served for six years in the<br />
exacting position of Secretary of External Territories. In selecting<br />
Mr Hay as his successor, the Government has appointed a man with a<br />
first-hand knowledge of current conditions in Papua and New Guinea.<br />
This intimate knowledge of the country and its people should be<br />
particularly beneficial in the period of development ahead.<br />
