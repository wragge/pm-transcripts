PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7: 30 REPORT, ABC TV, 10 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome to the show.<br />
PM: Thanks Paul.<br />
PL: Before we get into the details, let's hear first from a well known critic of<br />
yours. Howard: he has been there for 12 years. We have had so many<br />
false dawns, we were promised the bacon would come home. We<br />
were promised all of these things and we are promised it all again. I<br />
think out there in main stream Australia, they are not listening<br />
anymore." 1<br />
Well, when we go now to the tax cuts that were offered in One Nation,<br />
the forecasts in One Nation, why should we believe last night's<br />
Budget?-<br />
PM: Because basically they have all been, bar the first year of One Nation,<br />
they have all come home to roost. Do you want the One Nation<br />
numbers, I'll give them to you.<br />
PL: What about the One Nation tax cuts?<br />
PM: No, hang on, just a second. In 1992-93 we forecast four and three<br />
quarter per cent in One Nation. We got 3.2 per cent. In 1993-94 we<br />
forecast four and a half per cent in One Nation. We got four and a<br />
quarter per cent.<br />
PL: You also told us that the current account deficit wouldn't increase<br />
didn't you?-<br />
PM: Just a second, no, woo, I'm not letting you off that easy. Four and a<br />
quarter per cent in 1994-95, we got four and three quarters and this </p>
<p>year in One Nation we forecast three and three quarters and guess<br />
what the Budget estimate is, three and three quarters per cent.<br />
PL: Let's go to our number one national problem, our current account<br />
deficit.<br />
PM: No, just a second, we are not into theatricals. Just let me tell you this,<br />
One Nation bar the first year has all come true. John Howard said<br />
we had promised and we did and it has arrived.<br />
PL: But it hasn't all come true at all.<br />
PM: It has absolutely.<br />
PL: You said in your statement to the Parliament that under your four year<br />
plan the current account deficit would not increase. It was then 11.4<br />
billion, it is now 27 billion.<br />
PM: Ok, just listen. You asked me about One Nation, you asked me about<br />
the tax cuts. In the One Nation policy we had two sets of tax cuts. The<br />
first lot have been paid along with all the 1980s tax cuts, all four of<br />
them, all five of them.<br />
PL: Less than half of the total.<br />
PM: And now the balance, more than the balance, will be paid into<br />
superannuation accounts $ 4000 million will be paid to match<br />
employee contributions giving the Australian working person for the<br />
first time ever a massive retirement income. Here is John Howard's<br />
tax cuts lies, lies, lies. In 1977 when he was Treasurer he stood up<br />
at election, remember the fist full of dollars election campaign, ring up<br />
and find out how much your tax cuts were. And five months later as<br />
Treasurer he took them right out of the Budget.<br />
PL: You went right through the last election campaign promising that your<br />
tax cuts, the One Nation tax cuts would stay come hell or high water.<br />
PM: Paul, in the election campaign, from the likes of you and others, I<br />
couldn't get a word for the tax cuts. Let's not re-write any history.<br />
When I used to say " what about the tax?" you'd say ' oh, don't tell us<br />
about those Prime Minister, they were in One Nation a year earlier.'<br />
PL: Because very few people ever believed you would deliver.<br />
PM: Well, in that case, drop the debate. If you don't think they mattered,<br />
why refer to them? I mean, I think they mattered and that is why they<br />
have been paid here. When we suspended them, through the House<br />
of Representatives and the Senate, we said they would return<br />
probably in 1998. They have returned in 1998 and what this will mean<br />
is because we will pay them now into superannuation accounts of </p>
<p>people and they will keep them forever it will mean that a person on<br />
average weekly earnings, $ 33,000, will in retirement have a $ 30,000 a<br />
year income. Do you think that the Coalition would have any of the<br />
imagination or the courage or the foresight to develop a massive<br />
savings plan like this.<br />
PL: Prime Minister, we were going to get $ 5.2 billion worth of tax cuts from<br />
1995-96. Under the plan we are now told..<br />
PM: No, that figure is wrong. It is $ 3.5 billion $ 3.5 billion and you are now<br />
getting $ 4.2 billion.<br />
PL: There were two lots of tax cuts. We were going to get $ 3.4 and we<br />
were going to get $ 5.2 later. The $ 5.2 later are now into<br />
superannuation.<br />
PM: The second lot were $ 3.5 and they have now become $ 4.2 and they<br />
are being paid as superannuation. Now, who do you think is getting<br />
them out there martins? Who do you think is getting the $ 4 billion?<br />
Martins or Australians?<br />
PL: And when are you going to start distributing them, 1996-97, 1997-98?<br />
PM: Paul, have a look at this. Here is the Government, we have brought<br />
down a surplus Budget. A surplus Budget now right through the 1990s<br />
with the biggest savings change, the most comprehensive savings<br />
plan ever in the nations history. What have we heard from John<br />
Howard? Not one policy point. He is just a little whinger, whingeing<br />
around on radio stations attacking me personally, hour in, hour out and<br />
when pressed about his policy he has none. Imagine him turning up a<br />
savings plan putting 15 per cent of every bodies income away for their<br />
retirement. Imagine him building a savings pool of $ 2 trillion $ 2000<br />
billion.<br />
PL: All this is assuming you get re-elected and assuming you actually do it.<br />
PM: No, it's not. It's not assuming at all. We will legislate that in..<br />
PL: This will be L. AW law will it?<br />
PM: This will be legislated the same as the superannuation guarantee is<br />
legislated which is now five per cent, will be six per cent.<br />
PL: And the same as those tax cuts will legislate?<br />
PM: It will be six per cent on July 1 and the only way it can be changed is<br />
by the Government standing up in the House of Representatives and<br />
the Senate and changing them.<br />
PL: But, you did it with the tax cuts Prime Minister? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, but it had to pass both Houses of Parliament, Paul.<br />
PL: But, it was never going to happen was it, L. A. W law?<br />
PM: May be a mere bagatelle, but it had to pass both Houses of<br />
Parliament.<br />
PL: And you went to the election promising that you would stick to that<br />
pledge.<br />
PM: And you never reported it. Neither did any of your colleagues.<br />
PL: Never reported your tax cuts?<br />
PM: Look, in the election they didn't matter a tinkers cuss.<br />
PL: Well, let's look at your surplus. Your headline Budget surplus, $ 718<br />
million..<br />
PM: Can I just say, here is John Howard running around. Can I just say<br />
this, he has run around all day talking about tax and asset sales. This<br />
is the person who was in favour of at the last election a 15 per cent<br />
GST on everything, on everything and wanted to sell, remember he<br />
had the kitty of the $ 20 billion of Telecom and they were going to have<br />
somebody dole it out. I mean, they have got to be joking.<br />
PL: You are getting rid of the Commonwealth Bank assuming that share<br />
holders will let you now.<br />
PM: Yes, but we are not saying that the Commonwealth Bank sale isn't<br />
something that can't be done or shouldn't be done. But what he has<br />
was a completely unsaleable, un-doable thing of selling $ 20 billion<br />
worth of Telecom. Now, this is two years ago.<br />
PL: But, how do we know that this is doable because you have got to get<br />
per cent of share holders to agree. Your whole fiscal policy is now<br />
swinging in the breeze of a vote of share holders in the<br />
Commonwealth Bank.<br />
PM: Look<br />
PL: It has got a $ 4 billion hole in it if they say no.<br />
PM: Look, where do you get these lines? Up and down the corridor. I<br />
mean, did you talk yourselves into this in the afternoon.<br />
PL: It's not right? </p>
<p>PM: I mean, did you get into a huddle down at the drink stall or something<br />
and then come up with this nonsense?<br />
PL: Well, what is the situation?<br />
PM: I mean, where do you pick this up? At Aussie's cafe bar? I mean<br />
where do you get this tripe? The Government is going to sell the<br />
Commonwealth Bank like it sold the first tranche, the second trance<br />
and not only that, the Commonwealth Bank is going to buy back into<br />
Treasury the shares, just as Coles-Myer did recently. You know what<br />
that is going to do? Have less shares. You know what happens when<br />
normally you have less shares? The price goes up.<br />
PL: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Good.<br />
ends </p>
