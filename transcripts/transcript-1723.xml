DECISION ON AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY<br />
NATIONAL TELECAST AND BROADCAST BY THE 24NOI<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MVR HAROLD HOLT. NOOV V<br />
21ST NOVEMBER, 1967 / 8AR<br />
yesterday, the Australian Government made its decision<br />
to maintain the existing value of the Australian Dollar, following the<br />
devaluation of the Pound Sterling. It was an historic decision for Australia<br />
a difficult decision, also but In a sense It showed that we had come of<br />
age as a nation. We are not a large country In terms of population, but<br />
we loom large through our International trade. We rank amongst the<br />
twelve leading trading nations of the world. At the time we took our<br />
decision, we knew that of the other eleven, while Britain had devalued its<br />
currency, the remaining ten had decided to maintain their currency values<br />
undisturbed. After thoroughly reviewing our own situation, we decided<br />
that we should, also. In the past, Australia's trade has been so closely linked<br />
with that of Britain that, when Britain devalued her currency last In 1949,<br />
we followed her, so that the relationship between our currency and hers<br />
remained unchanged. The situation today Is vastly different.<br />
I want to tell you why we made this significant bie ak with<br />
the past. The rate of exchange between our Australian currency and the<br />
Pound Sterling has been unchanged since 1931, but In that period there has<br />
been a transformation of world economic and financial relationships. The<br />
Australian Dollar today Is a currency in its own right. It has to stand on<br />
its own feet and It has shown itself capable of doing so. We have an enviable<br />
reputation abroad for political and economic stability. This has helped us<br />
to attract much capital and much interest on the part of other countries.<br />
But to pursue this Independence we have to be strong in our own right.<br />
In other days, Britain was our best customer, and we still<br />
remain one of her best markets. But times have changed. We have<br />
diversified our trade and strengthened our economy on a broader base.<br />
While primary produce still bulks largest In our overseas earnlings, and<br />
Britain is a principal market, we are diversifying rapidly with our exports<br />
of minerals and manufactured goods. In fact, Japan has now become our<br />
largest market. These things had to be taken into account when we took<br />
stock of what we should do. We are preserving the existing relationship<br />
with other currencies like the United States Dollar, most Western<br />
European currencies, as well as those of Japan, South Africa and a<br />
number of Sterling area countries.<br />
Because our trade with Britain is still important, some<br />
may have thought that we should have followed Sterling down, if not all<br />
the way, by devaluing our Dollar against other currencies. But trade and<br />
commerce with the countries to which those currencies belong is far<br />
greater In total now than our trade with Great Britain, and all the largest<br />
of them had decided not to devalue. They took their decisions, no doubt,<br />
on a judgment of their own Interests. But there was also, I believe, a<br />
significant element of International co-operation about It In an attempt to<br />
achieve a stronger world economy. They all saw that by devaluing / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
themselves, they might help to bring about a world-wide-run of competitive<br />
exchange a justments which could have caused international monetary<br />
chaos. In Australia's own case, while some of our exporters<br />
would have gained a temporary increase in their Incomes had we devalued,<br />
the long term outlook over the whole area of our economy and our<br />
international trading relationships, would have been heavily to our<br />
disadvantage We certainly would not have helped Britain had we followed<br />
her down. There is a mutual Interest for us In seeing Sterling regain<br />
its strength) and Britain has, In fect, looked to us to do precisely what<br />
we have decided to do. In the long term, a growing British economy will<br />
offer larger market opportunities for world traders.<br />
In other ways, too, our decision to hold the dollar at its<br />
present level avoids incurring long term liabilities. For Instance, our<br />
Indebtedness to the United States is something like 000 million. If<br />
we had devalued to the same degree as Britain we would have added, in<br />
effect, $ 1U5140 million to this debt right away. It Is true In the same<br />
sense -that we lose something like $ A90 million from our sterling balances,<br />
but this is offset by a reduction in real terms of our Sterling indebtedness<br />
in the United Kingdom. It Is, of course, one thing for us to take a decision and<br />
another thing to live with that decision. But we are in a strong economic<br />
position with a comfortable level of external reserves.* It was imperative<br />
that we did nothing to undermine confidence in the Australian Dollar. We<br />
believe that by acting as we have we are protecting the Dollar.<br />
Let me say something of the effect that devaluation would<br />
have had on the home front. One likely effect would have been a rise In<br />
costs and prices. This would affect every housewife and every wage earner.<br />
While we have experienced some price rises, we have been free of serious<br />
inflation now for a number of years. There would also have been new<br />
burdens on certain areas of our manufacturing In dustries which would<br />
have disturbed the present stability we enjoy, and caused unnecessary<br />
difficulties in programmes of development and expansion.<br />
I have said that some of our exporters would gain a<br />
temporary Increase in their Incomes, but the cost of our Imports from<br />
those countries which have not devalued and all the other payments we<br />
make to them would be increased. These additional costs would spread<br />
with multiplying effects through the economy.<br />
To arrest inflationary forces, we would have had to adopt<br />
strong measures of restraint tighter money, perhaps more taxation and<br />
so on. This Is what Britain has had to do.<br />
Domestic inflation is no respecter of persons. It strikes<br />
at exp orters as well as everybody else, and any gains from higher<br />
overseas earnings would have been offset to some degree, and perhaps<br />
more than offset, by higher costs at home.<br />
I am sure the decision we have taken Is the right one, and<br />
indeed the only one which measures up to our long term needs and the<br />
standing of our currency in the world today. The fact that we have been<br />
able to take up this independent position will, I hope, be a source of pride<br />
e a / 3 </p>

to all Australians because it demonstrates tbestrength--of -our currency<br />
and the sound economic position of the nation.<br />
I do not minimise the fact that there will be problems for<br />
many associated with this decision. I do not believe them to be nearly<br />
as great, or as numerous, as the problems which would have arisen<br />
had we devalued along with Britain. We recognised that by not following<br />
Sterling down, some Industries who still depend largely on selling theli<br />
products In Britain could be adversely affected, perhaps critically so.<br />
That goes for rural Industries producing for export. There are other<br />
Industries, like wool, which sell on a world market, but whose prices<br />
can be affected either by Sterling devaluation or by other measures the<br />
British Government has taken. These industries have already been<br />
labouring under difficulties due to falling prices, rising costs, drought,<br />
or a combination of these factors.<br />
It was apparent to us, however, that since the impact<br />
would vary from in dustry to industry creating a different set of problems<br />
for each, the right course would be to study their problem intensively,<br />

Economic Committee of Cabinet, it is arranging for an urgent examinAtion<br />
of areas of industry likely to be adversely affected by the Government's<br />
decision. We shall look to positive measures to ensure that a proper<br />
balance is maintained over the whole range of our economy.<br />
There will undoubtedly be difficulties in some sectors of the<br />
economy in the short term. But I am confident they will not be permanent,<br />
nor will they be damaging In the long term. I am sure that you, my<br />
fellow Australians, will recognise the rightness of what we have done.<br />
I am confident that as a people we can meet whatever problems arise<br />
during the period of readjustment which lies ahead for some of our<br />
industries. These are the responsibilities which fall on us now that<br />
we have established a position of Independence in the world of International<br />
finance and now that we have demonstrated over a considerable period<br />
our capacity to maintain a stable and progressive economy at home.<br />
We accept, those responsibilities gladly, cheerfully and confidently. </p>
