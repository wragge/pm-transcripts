    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today announced $2.4 million funding for the 15-hectare Swan River regional park development  -  a project to create a significant regional facility in Perth's east.</p>
<p>The funding is part of the Government's $800 million Community Infrastructure Program  -  the largest one-off investment in local infrastructure in Australia's history.</p>
<p>Managed by the City of Swan, the Swan Riverside regional park project will create jobs and provide a direct stimulus to the local economy.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is supporting jobs and stimulating local economies during the global recession by investing in the construction of important community infrastructure.</p>
<p>Projects like this will also deliver lasting benefits to the local community.</p>
<p>The $7.3 million Regional Park project will deliver a great environment with historical and cultural significance for both the Swan region and the entire state of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Park will become a magnet for tourism, recreational, social and cultural activity.</p>
<p>The regional park will include:</p>
<p>     * An all-abilities eco-cultural discovery play space for families and children;</p>
<p>     * Dual-use paths to connect the park to the Swan Valley tourism precinct;</p>
<p>     * Creation of the Blackadder Creek Wetland to reduce salt-water incursion into the area, which will help to improve the health of the site.</p>
<p>Local councils and shires across Australia submitted more than 3,600 community projects for funding under the Community Infrastructure Program.</p>
