<p>(Tape begins)...and a marvellous event at what is a marvellous</p>
<p>   golf course. I know that all who are going to play here over the</p>
<p>   next four days will enjoy what is a superb location and a really</p>
<p>   delightful course.</p>
<p>This represents the last tournament in the current season and it</p>
<p>   is certainly a sign of the way in which, increasingly, Australia</p>
<p>   is improving and establishing its reputation as a major location</p>
<p>   for the holding of major golf tournaments. Later this year, of course,</p>
<p>   we will have the privilege of hosting the first ever President's</p>
<p>   Cup outside of the United States. It is just another incidence of</p>
<p>   the growing standing of Australia in the world of international</p>
<p>   sport.</p>
<p>We have been able to attract to this ANZ tournament the participation</p>
<p>   of a very high calibre group of players. That, of course, has been</p>
<p>   evident in the various open men's and women's championships</p>
<p>   that have been held in different locations and in different golf</p>
<p>   courses around Australia over the past few months. The names of</p>
<p>   those who have won have become household names in a nation that,</p>
<p>   of course, is notorious for the love that the men and women of this</p>
<p>   country have for sport.</p>
<p>Golf is a sport which is played with great skill by many Australians</p>
<p>   and over the years we have produced some of the most famous names</p>
<p>   in world golf. Of course, it is also a pursuit that is indulged</p>
<p>   in less conspicuously, but with no less enjoyment, by hundreds of</p>
<p>   thousands of Australians of all ages. In many respects, the climate</p>
<p>   of Australia and the quality of the golf courses that are available</p>
<p>   to the general population in Australia are such that there is probably</p>
<p>   no country in the world in which the playing and enjoyment of golf</p>
<p>   by the general population is more achievable, more affordable and</p>
<p>   more embarked upon than Australia. Whenever you talk in the most</p>
<p>   casual way about golf to people from other countries, they marvel</p>
<p>   at the facilities that exist here and the fact that they are within</p>
<p>   the reach of the average man and woman in a way that simply isn't</p>
<p>   present in many other countries.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate Royal Canberra on hosting this event. I</p>
<p>   want to wish all of those who play in today's event and in</p>
<p>   the subsequent days' events the best of good fortune. I know</p>
<p>   that there are several here I met this morning who are very much</p>
<p>   in the running for the incentive of $500,000, which is a very considerable</p>
<p>   incentive, that lies at the end of this particular competition.</p>
<p>   I know that there will be one or two extraordinarily happy players</p>
<p>   when this tournament is over.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me along. I have very</p>
<p>   much pleasure in unveiling this, I am sure, magnificent looking</p>
<p>   trophy. Thank you very much.</p>
