<p>Farmers in the local government areas of Central Highlands and Derwent Valley can apply for clean-up and recovery grants following the devastating Lake Repulse bushfire earlier this year.</p>
<p>The grants of up to $25,000 are available under the jointly funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.</p>
<p>The grants will help eligible primary producers with the cost of cleaning up and removing debris, disposing of dead livestock, and help ensure their business isn't disrupted beyond the next season.</p>
<p>This assistance does not compensate for income losses and is not intended to replace insurance.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Small businesses, not-for-profit organisations and primary producers in the local government areas of Glamorgan-Spring Bay, Sorell and Tasman are already receiving this assistance to help them get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Personal hardship and distress assistance  and funding for councils to conduct counter disaster operations and restore essential public assets is also available in the six local government areas of Central Highlands, Circular Head, Derwent Valley, Glamorgan-Spring Bay, Sorelland Tasman.</p>
<p>With fires still burning across the state, everyone should ensure they take the appropriate precautions to stay safe and monitor information from local emergency service agencies.</p>
<p>Information on the range of assistance that is available can be found at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>  or at <a href="http://www.bushfirerecovery.tas.gov.au/">www.bushfirerecovery.tas.gov.au/</a></p>
<p>The Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments will continue to work closely together to assist communities as they rebuild.</p>
