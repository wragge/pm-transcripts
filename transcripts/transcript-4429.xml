PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE AT SYDNEY AIRPOnT<br />
28 JUNE 1977<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
some of the more important parts of the visit as I see it.<br />
The visit started with the rather lengthy Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government meeting and that did provide a very useful opportunity<br />
to get to know and to meet at first hand a number of leaders in the<br />
Commonwealth whom I otherwise would not have had an opportunity to<br />
see. But two or three things came out of that meeting and there<br />
was as you know the outright condemnation of Uganda overwhelmingly<br />
by the Commonwealth and I think it is the first time that the<br />
Commonwealth has acted in that way. I believe, and other Heads<br />
of Government believe that it was very important for the credibility<br />
of the Commonwealth to speak in a very forthright way about the<br />
atrocities in Uganda, and that in fact occurred. The Commonwealth<br />
expressed an urgency about moving to majority rule in Zimbabwe,<br />
Rhodesia, and I believe there is an urgency about this. Prime<br />
Minister Callaghan spoke in terms of Zimbabwe being seated at the<br />
next Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, and that would be<br />
in a little less than two years time. Any policy that in 1977<br />
tends to perpetuate a racist supremacy, of a minority over a<br />
majority is a policy doomed to failure, and if it persists, doonaed<br />
to disaster. Now these are not new views. Some people have tended<br />
. to suggest that so far as the Liberal Party is concerned or my<br />
Government is concerned, that it is a new view. In fact, apartheid<br />
was condemned by Sir Robert Menzies in very forthright terms in the<br />
Australian Parliament in 1960 or 1961. But the fact that policies<br />
in Rhodesia have continued in all the years since then make it I<br />
think all the more necessary that there be an early change to<br />
majority rule. You have a situation in which whichever persists<br />
more and more people will turn to a violent solution. That will<br />
tend to leave scars on Africa in relations between many countries<br />
that can be avoided if a negotiated settlement is reached. 7ow<br />
I think there are some things which are pressing more towards a<br />
negotiated settlement than in the past. Not only the firmness<br />
of view of the Commonwealth but the support that President Carter<br />
is offering towards the same objective, and the thrust towards<br />
human rights which he has initiated, and I believe that these things<br />
give many people in Africa and in the Commonwealth a greater hope<br />
that there will he a sensible negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe.<br />
The other major matter that came out of the Commonwealth was the<br />
considerable discussion of what has come to be called a Common<br />
Fund, but that is two words for what would be rather complex<br />
arrangements to try and achieve stability in the marketing of<br />
commodities of developing countries. We have known in Australia<br />
how in the past our own economy would have been disrupted because<br />
of violent changes in the prices of wool and the prices of wheat or<br />
meat, and we have sought to get commodity arrangements to stabilis.<br />
these particular matters. Now many of the developing countrie-.<br />
are. dependent very much on one or two commodities. Their prices<br />
fluctuate greatly. They need more stable prices and reasonable<br />
prices that terms of trade do not continually move against thei-.<br />
As a result of an initiative that Australia took, the Comm-onwealth<br />
is establishing a technical working group to try and define tc a<br />
greater extent what is possible in pursuing arrangements for<br />
stability in the marketing of commodities from the developing world. </p>
<p>2-<br />
In the United States, there was I believe a very useful and<br />
constructive meeting with President Carter. There was a very full<br />
and free exchange of views on many matters affecting the tiestern<br />
Pacific and the Indian Ocean. We have the forthright a ss u<br />
that we will be kept very fully informed of the progress of~ discussio:<br />
affecting the Indian Ocean, and certainly consulted if it gets to the<br />
stage of coming to any agreement with the Soviets. But I think, goi; n,<br />
beyond bilateral matters between Australia and the United States, we<br />
have got to a situation where the general thrust of President Carter's<br />
policies are giving life and hope to free peoples around the world.<br />
Very often, or in many years, in recent times, democracies have tended<br />
to be on the defensive, reacting to what has happened; but really wher<br />
we know what we stand for and what we believe in, democracies should<br />
not be on the defensive and the democratic idea of free peoplesgoverning<br />
themselves should be proclaimed. I believe that President<br />
Carter's thrust towards human rights, greater attempts to provide<br />
sensible arrangements for trading with the third world, about which'<br />
I have been speaking, the Common Fund, the drive towards making sure<br />
that there will not be nuclear proliferation are policies to be<br />
applauded ardin these areas put the democracies very much on the<br />
offensive, and I think that is a good thing, and I believe there<br />
is much merit in the policies that he is pursuing. I think there<br />
is a similarity in objective in many areas, especially in the area<br />
of trying to seek the arrangements that will do most to avoid nuclear<br />
proliferation between the United States and Australia.<br />
In Europe there were extensive discussions with a significant number<br />
of Commissioners from the European Community, as well as with<br />
Britain, Prance, Germany and Belgium, and their discussions<br />
centered on the economic relationships, not only between Australia<br />
and the Community, but also between Australia and the individual<br />
national countries and governments. It has been agreed that there<br />
should be full and wide-ranging talks on trade and commercial matters<br />
between ourselves and the Community in a way that has not occurred<br />
in'the past, with the objective of coming to solutions. Similar<br />
discussions will be held with both France and with Germany, and I<br />
would be hopeful that we will make some progress in matters which<br />
are of importance to us.<br />
sometimes in Australia we are accused of being protectionist in the<br />
policies we pursue in relation to manufactured goods. But I think it<br />
needs to be understood in context. We are a relatively small market,<br />
of 14 million People. Europe is a large market of 260 million peop-le.<br />
For that reason alone I think we are lucky to need higher levels of<br />
protection than would be the case in Europe. But even in spite of<br />
that, our tariffs have been lowered, and there is considerable access<br />
into our market, even though industries have at times suffered quite<br />
severely, especially over the last two or three years. But what<br />
happens to the European Community? They want lower and lower<br />
protection in the things which they sell, but if there comes a<br />
time in which they do not produce so well, if any of their industrie~ s<br />
tend to get hifrt in any way, they try to introduce, or tend to<br />
introduce, protective measures of a very severe kind indeed, and<br />
very often measures that exclude trade completely. Now in the past<br />
they had got away with this because the exclusions tended to be in<br />
the agricultural area, and people tended to accept that agriculture<br />
was a special case which gave them special rights to have that kind<br />
of protectionist policy. But in recent times we have seen the<br />
exclusion of * a number of goods from Japan and we have seen the<br />
decisions to reduce imports of steel from Japan and South Africa<br />
by 50% and a decision to try to reduce imports of steel from Australia<br />
by 25%, and I really thought it was stretching it too far when they<br />
/ said </p>
<p>said that BHP Australia was an unfair competitor in steel.<br />
Well I am reasonably optimistic that those cuts in BHP's exports<br />
will not actually be applied, but there will be many hard discussions<br />
in the future. On another matter also relating to trade,<br />
European countries were eager to know what our position was in.<br />
relation to uranium, and I stressed that we would be making final<br />
decisions about that after our return to Australia. But we<br />
discussed the matter of safeguards, and we discussed the<br />
possibility of dealing either with the Community or with<br />
national governments. There is an interesting situation<br />
developing because the Community, if we export, would want us<br />
to deal with them. National governments, if we export, would<br />
want us to deal quite directly with national governments.. But<br />
any discussion in that area was completely contingent on whatever<br />
decision Australia might make on the major question.<br />
I think that has probably given enough to open it up for questions.<br />
I have tried to give an over-view of the nature of the discussions<br />
and what was involved in the discussions in the different areas.<br />
QUESTION How many countries Mr. Fraser seem to want our uranium?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Certainly European countries do. United States I think basically<br />
has sufficient resources of her own. But our officials at the<br />
moment are trying to undertake an assessment of what the likely<br />
demand might be against the background of a known stated safeguards<br />
policy. It is not impossible that some countries that would<br />
otherwise have wanted uranium, when they see the nature of the<br />
safeguards policy might say ' no, we are not prepared to enter into<br />
those commitments' and officials are overseas at this moment in<br />
making an assessment against the background of Australians<br />
safeguards policy, which is a very strict one indeed.<br />
QUESTION What were you able to tell them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
In relation to what?<br />
QUESTION To uranium. How many countries would want to buy uranium?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Every country I visited would be interested in purchasing<br />
Australian uranium. There is no doubt about that.<br />
QUESTIOV Are you satisfied about-the safeguards that exist in Europe?<br />
/ PRIME Z-MINISTER </p>
<p>-4<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I am satisfied about the nature of our safeguards. But we<br />
would certainly part of that policy is to have a bilateral<br />
treaty with individual countries, and there could be some hard<br />
negotiating in relation to that. Now there is a team of experts<br />
overseas at the moment explaining our safeguards policy, getting<br />
the reaction of European countries, Common Market countries in<br />
particular, in relation to it; and their reactions will be one of<br />
the things that the Government will have in mind when it does make<br />
a final decision on whether to export or not.<br />
QUESTION it is suggested that you might be able to make a decision by<br />
August. Is that too soon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, I cannot see why we should not even make a decision before<br />
that. It will depend to some extent how much processing has gone<br />
on in the last three or four weeks in Australia while I have been<br />
away, of the nature of the environmental enquiries.<br />
QUESTION Now badly do these countries want it. Was it the primary topic<br />
of discussion when it came to matters of trade?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It was the most important topic from their point of view,<br />
because many of these countries are countries without a basic<br />
energy source, and this does need to be understood.<br />
It is hard for Australia; it has a degree of self-sufficiency<br />
in oil. a real self-sufficiency in coal and uranium, and natural<br />
gas, to understand the need, the very real concern of the countries<br />
of Europe which have not got a basic energy source of their own.<br />
They have to import their energy source. They were given a great<br />
shock as a result of the oil countries decisions of a year or two<br />
back,. and it is understandable from their point of view let me<br />
emphasise, from their point of view that they would want to have<br />
long term, secure, supplies of energy so that the lights in their<br />
homes can keep burning, so that their factories can keep operating,<br />
so that their people can be employed. From their point of view,<br />
from the point of view of many European countries, getting access<br />
to reliable, reasonable sources of energy, is a matter of the<br />
greatest ' possible importance.<br />
QUESTION Will you be able to use that then as a lever to get access<br />
for our other goods into the Common Market?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think that is the wrong way of putting it. What I hav e<br />
stressed to the Europeans is that while I could understand<br />
their desire and concern for stability of access of an energy<br />
source, surely they could understand our desire and concern for<br />
stability in access to markets. Stability in trade is something<br />
that goes both ways. Stability is a principle that I think is<br />
/ very </p>
<p>very important indeed. But it ought not just to apply to one<br />
part of the trade, to trade in one direction. It ought to apply<br />
to goods that we supply, access to markets it is a two-way<br />
business. We have been stressing stability for trade in Japan,<br />
when beef supplies were cut off, then resurrected again. It is<br />
disruptive to relations between countries, disruptive to producers<br />
and to consumers, if there are sudden changes in attitudes or<br />
decisions by governments. I believe that in the discussions whi-ch<br />
will take place within the next two to three to four months, that.<br />
we will be able to gain a great deal of recognition for the need<br />
for stability in trade and access. Now, I do not know how far<br />
that will go. But I was encouraged to believe that once one or<br />
two European countries understood that we were not threatening the<br />
basis and the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy for<br />
example once it was understood that we could point to areas<br />
at the margin which -if modified would make a substantial difference<br />
from our point of view and from the ' point of view of traders outside<br />
Europe, then there seemed to be a greater willingness to consult arnd<br />
to come, hopefully, to a reasonable solution.<br />
QUESTION There would not be any question though of you withholding<br />
uranium if they did not agree to what we wanted in terms of<br />
access for our other goods?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think that when you are having trade negotiations with a<br />
country, it is appropriate that those negotiations march forward<br />
as a whole; and I believe that Europeans understand this.<br />
QUESTION It sounds as though the argument these countries put up in<br />
favour of uranium exports was fairly persuasive.-. Would you<br />
say that you have returned personally committed to the fact<br />
that these exports should take place?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
This is not anything new what I have said about Europe's need<br />
for an energy source. I-did not learn that on this visit. That<br />
is known. But i ' t is something that they stressed, and I was<br />
emphasising how important they regard it from their point of<br />
view. This is something that is known. The other point of<br />
course which is important in relation to uranium, that with limited<br />
access to uranium, European-countries are much more likely to go in<br />
for large scale reprocessing into the plutonium economy as it is<br />
called. That is getting much nearer a use of nuclear power which<br />
makes it harder to make sure that proliferation does not take place,<br />
makes it harder to control because it is getting nearer the edge of<br />
military technology. Now with a larger supply of the basic material<br />
so that you do not need to go into reprocessing, do not need to get<br />
so close to the plutonium economy, there is a greater chance of<br />
( inaudible) international safeguards, at least until more is known<br />
about the second stage of nuclear power for peaceful purposes<br />
developoment. From that point of view, from the point of view<br />
of those who would want President Carter's non-proliferation policies<br />
to succeed, they would regard an adequate supply of uranium, of<br />
enriched uranium, as a matter of major importance. Now all of<br />
these matters Australia will have to take into account. QUESTIO0N </p>
<p>QUESTION As a result of your trip Mr. Fraser, how important do you<br />
think uranium export is for Australia rather than for Europe?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Any country that is rich in natural Kesources as Australia isand<br />
I am not just talking about uranium in this context has<br />
some international obligations to be a reliable and stable<br />
supplier of raw materials. Compare our circumstances with<br />
the circumstances of a country such as Japan that relies preeminently<br />
on the energy initiative and creativity of her own<br />
people, but with very few, if any, natural resources of the kind<br />
that we have got. There is an international obligation on a<br />
country such as Australia. I do not want to put it higher than<br />
that. I do not want to be specific in relation to one particular<br />
commodity at the moment.<br />
QUESTIONsaid last weekend that within a decade uranium would be<br />
Australia's most important export. Do you agree with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
We have not yet made a decision have we?<br />
QUESTION Mr. Fraser** to turn to the question of your policy on Southern<br />
* Africa, can you tell me if your Government supports the principle<br />
of one -person, one vote that is, majority rule in South Africa<br />
itself, and if so what steps do you think your Government will take<br />
* towards implementing this policy and in particular in working<br />
* towards the dismantling of apartheid?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
My Government has condemned apartheid in full and I think very<br />
-strong terms, as did Sir Robert Menzies in 1960/ 1961 in the<br />
* Parliament, and people often forget this. But the words he<br />
* used against apartheid were strong indeed. We support the<br />
* general position that the Commonwealth has taken in relation<br />
to that. It does not go beyond that at this moment.<br />
QUESTION<br />
* This is-the first time that you have used the name Zimbabwe.<br />
Can you tell us why you...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, it is not the first time I have used it. I have used<br />
it many times.<br />
QUESTION In Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Yes, in Australia. And outside. / QUESTION </p>
<p>-7<br />
QUESTION<br />
Mr. Fraser, the Nigerian Government has just set up a Southern<br />
Africa Relief Fund. Do you think your Government will be<br />
contributing towards this, to the aid of those who are suffering<br />
from apartheid?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The which Government?<br />
QUESTION The Nigerian Government.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Nigerian Government did propose some interesting initiatives<br />
in the Commonwealth Conference. What they were proposing was<br />
something which would allow private citizens to contribute as<br />
well as contributions by Governments. As you know Australia did<br />
announce substantial increases in food aid and Commonwealth<br />
Technical Fund subst.. ntial increases to that and a number<br />
of Governments, including Australia, said that the Nigerian<br />
proposal would be considered in our own context. Again I cannot<br />
take it further than that.<br />
QUESTION You are being described here as the white knight of black Africa.<br />
How do you react to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I do not react at all..<br />
QUESTION Sir, could you tell us what your assessment is'of the Soviet<br />
threat in the Indian ocean following your talks in Hawaii?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I do not think the talks in Hawaii added anything to the talks<br />
I had in Brussels, or the talks that I had in Washington. it<br />
remains very much as it was. There is a capacity of the Soviet<br />
Union to reach into almost any corner of the world that it wishes<br />
to. The NATO Foreign Ministers and the NATO Defence Ministers have<br />
drawn attention to this in nearly every communique in the last<br />
several years, and what is often not understood is that our<br />
concern in relation to the Indian Ocean has only been an extension<br />
of a global situation coming from the fact that the Soviets spend<br />
13-14-15% of their gross national product on defence each year.<br />
QUESTION ( first part of question inaudible)., to improve Australia's<br />
prospects for rural products in particular in the EEC countries<br />
at all? / PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>-8a-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think it is too early to say that at this point. But quite<br />
certainly the discussions that w ill be taking place with the EEC,<br />
with Belgium, France and Germany, will be involving rural products<br />
very substantially, and there is also an agreement to work with<br />
the British Government that has its own problems with some aspects<br />
of the Common Agricultural Policy. It needs to be understood that<br />
it is not only access into Europe that is important because if they<br />
as a result of their internal subsidies get a surplus of it might<br />
be flour they say, well where is a market for flour, that ' might<br />
be Sri Lanka, they say how much subsidy is needed to unload ou-r<br />
flour into Sri Lanka, and this often disrupts the long-term and<br />
traditional markets of countries such as Australia, and Australia<br />
is not the only government that is affected in this way. So it is<br />
the policy they use the term restitutions -probably they think it<br />
is a nicer term than subsidy, policy of restitutions getting rid of<br />
surplus commodity into markets outside Europe that also causes<br />
significant damage from time to time to exports of our agricultural<br />
commodities. Now, that also is a policy-that needs examining, and<br />
it-will be.<br />
QUESTION What was your reaction to Jimmy Carter calling you John?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No reaction at all.<br />
QUESTION Were you embarrassed at all by it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Good heavens no.<br />
-QUESTION Did you feel it was a gaff on his part?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think I have been called many worse things than that.<br />
QUESTION Are you concerned that the stand you have taken in relation to<br />
Africa, in relation to Southern Africa, may help strengthen the<br />
Soviet Union position in the Indian Ocean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No. If anyone came to that conclusion they completely and<br />
utterly misunderstand the position. Because if people believe in<br />
a negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe, there is an obligation then to<br />
make a negotiated settlement work. Now that is where the commitment<br />
of the British Government for Zimbabwe to be seated before th~ e: cx<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting is important. That is where<br />
President Carter's commitment to human rights and to supporting the<br />
British in relation to Zimbabwe or Rhodesia if you prefer it, is also<br />
important. But the longer a negotiated settlement is delayed the<br />
/ mo re </p>
<p>-9<br />
more people will turn to violence as the Dnly means of solution<br />
of a problem that is an affront to human decency the supremacy<br />
of one race over another merely on the basis of colour. Therefore<br />
if one wants a settled and reasonable solution to these matters<br />
the sooner there is a negotiated solution the better. If one<br />
was concerned with Soviet intrusion into Africa, one would want<br />
to press all the more for an early solution because the longer<br />
the present situation continues, the more opportunity there will<br />
be for * people with other influences arnd other ideologies to gain<br />
support and sway out of a thoroughly unreasonable situation that<br />
now exists. </p>
