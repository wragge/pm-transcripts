    <content><![CDATA[<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And I'm joined in the studio by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, how are you Geoff?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Very well, and yourself?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very sad about the circumstances that have brought me</p>
<p>   to Western Australia on this occasion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A very sombre service there this morning. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it's just a very sad event and I feel very sorry, desperately</p>
<p>   sorry for the Mums and Dads, fiances, and girlfriends, mates and</p>
<p>   brothers and sisters, and hope that the gathering was of some comfort</p>
<p>   to the people who've lost the people they loved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Some thousand mourners there, many in uniform. There is under Government</p>
<p>   policy a big fleet based here, the fleet based West. They are big</p>
<p>   family if you like, aren't they, which is really...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The services are great families in their own right and that is</p>
<p>   one of the great strengths of service life, and when there is a</p>
<p>   tragedy like this there are a lot of people to gather around to</p>
<p>   help them, that's of some comfort and some help to the people</p>
<p>   who are left devastated but it's just a very sad thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Let's push on to an issue which I guess you may or may not</p>
<p>   agree with this is the biggest problem facing you at the moment,</p>
<p>   and that's the waterfront. These allegations that yourself</p>
<p>   and Peter Reith knew with some certainty, some of these developments</p>
<p>   to send soldiers to Dubai before you're letting on? Did you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a joke. Peter Reith has dealt very comprehensively</p>
<p>   with the allegations and I don't think it is a problem at all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, one of the connections is Dr Stephen Webster who works in</p>
<p>   Peter Reith's department. Have you spoken to Dr Webster at</p>
<p>   all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know Dr Webster because he's on Peter Reith's staff,</p>
<p>   just as Peter Reith knows people who are on my staff. I can't</p>
<p>   remember having had a separate discussion with him about anything.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you are not interested in doing so?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, of course I'm not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, why would he say that he was on...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I haven't ... anyway, he's denied that. He's</p>
<p>   denied that. But Geoff...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the allegation he told Mike Wells, he was doing a special job</p>
<p>   for the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Before we waste your time, my time, and your listeners time with</p>
<p>   a whole lot of, sort of, trivia, can I just say two things, and</p>
<p>   then I'm going to leave it with that, because I'm getting</p>
<p>   very bored with an insubstantial issue. The first thing is that</p>
<p>   there is nothing intrinsically wrong with Australians being trained</p>
<p>   overseas for a lawful purpose, nothing at all. And this idea that</p>
<p>   there is something criminally sinister about people being trained</p>
<p>   in Dubai or elsewhere, or that in some way, or something about passports</p>
<p>   being expedited. There are 500 passports expedited each week, so</p>
<p>   I am told. And as far as the Government is concerned, we have responded</p>
<p>   again and again. Peter Reith did it again this morning about the</p>
<p>   situation. If people have got any allegation of substance to make</p>
<p>   let them make it, we'll deal with it. But no allegation of</p>
<p>   substance has been made and indeed this morning I heard on the ABC</p>
<p>   Mr Harris himself admit at the end of the interview that there was</p>
<p>   really nothing to directly implicate Mr Reith. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So what are we talking about? I understand your wish to dismiss</p>
<p>   it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... on the resumption of Parliament you will be pursued on it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I deal with reality and there has been first of all, there's</p>
<p>   nothing wrong with people being trained overseas, Mr Reith has dealt</p>
<p>   comprehensively with the allegations. There are no allegations of</p>
<p>   any substance, of any wrong-doing of any kind established against</p>
<p>   him, or against anybody in the Government, and quite frankly it</p>
<p>   is becoming a bore.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But there are allegations all the same for which you would be...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...allegations. You're a journalist, you make allegations</p>
<p>   the whole time, but look...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mike Wells was under the impression that Chris Corrigan was reporting</p>
<p>   directly back to the Government. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can talk to Corrigan about that. Get Mr Wells on your</p>
<p>   programme and talk to him about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>That's all you want to say?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it is, because there's nothing more to say. The whole</p>
<p>   thing is becoming a waste of time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that it will... you are bringing your Budget</p>
<p>   down next week. Are you concerned that it's going to deflect</p>
<p>   interest away from what you call an "A" report card?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's a lot to be said about the economy, and this</p>
<p>   is something which is of interest to people. Yesterday we had the</p>
<p>   best employment figures since 1990. They are the best employment</p>
<p>   figures Australia has had since the recession we had to have at</p>
<p>   a time when Mr Beazley, the current Opposition Leader, was the Minister</p>
<p>   for Employment, and of course under his leadership in the Employment</p>
<p>   portfolio, unemployment went to 11.2%. In the last two years, we</p>
<p>   have created almost 140 000 full time jobs in Australia. In the</p>
<p>   last six years of Labor they created barely 20 000 full time jobs.</p>
<p>   Now, there is a long way to go on the employment front, I don't</p>
<p>   deny that for a moment, but we have made very good progress. And</p>
<p>   when you add that to the fact that we've cut interest rates</p>
<p>   by the equivalent of $300 a month to the average home buyer, that's</p>
<p>   the equivalent of a $100 a week pay rise to the average wage and</p>
<p>   salary earner. We've got the lowest inflation rate in the industrialised</p>
<p>   world. We've got high levels of business investment. We have</p>
<p>   cut Mr Beazley's budget deficit of $10.5 billion a year such</p>
<p>   that we believe we will be in a position to declare the country</p>
<p>   is back in balance when Peter Costello brings the Budget down on</p>
<p>   Tuesday night. Now, those things are monumental economic achievements</p>
<p>   and they have given us the strongest economic foundations in 25</p>
<p>   years, and it also meant that we've been able to weather the</p>
<p>   storm from Asia far better from otherwise.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well all these good indicators, it obviously irritates you like</p>
<p>   anything that all anyone ever wants to ask you about is what the</p>
<p>   prospective involvement was of your Government in waterfront, with</p>
<p>   Patricks and the training of the soldiers overseas.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think you might ask yourself whether it perhaps irritates your</p>
<p>   listeners even more, because they regard that as being the flummery</p>
<p>   and irrelevance of politics. They are interested in Prime Ministers</p>
<p>   and Treasurers and Minister delivering good things for the bulk</p>
<p>   of the Australian population. They are interested in Opposition</p>
<p>   Leaders having alternative policies and not being negative and narky</p>
<p>   the whole time, and they are interested in people who stand up to</p>
<p>   the national interest and not the sectional interest. The thing</p>
<p>   that comes through on this whole waterfront dispute is that my Government</p>
<p>   has stood up for the national interest. What we have wanted all</p>
<p>   the time is to have a more productive waterfront and to get rid</p>
<p>   of compulsory unionism on the waterfront. By contrast, Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   for example, has identified himself totally with the maritime union</p>
<p>   of Australia. He has encouraged them to defy orders of the Supreme</p>
<p>   Court. He's said that he doesn't believe in voluntary</p>
<p>   unionism. I mean I find it extraordinary that the Leader of the</p>
<p>   Opposition in 1998 should still support the closed shop and should</p>
<p>   still support compulsory unionism on the Australian Waterfront.</p>
<p>   So he is chained to the sectional interests. I am promoting the</p>
<p>   national interest.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you spoke about the ... you touched on the Budget briefly.</p>
<p>   Can you give us any hint, any indication for...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will be very much...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.. you can keep your fingers crossed!</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will continue the good work of the last two Budgets. I can't</p>
<p>   talk about particular measures and I'm not going to talk about</p>
<p>   figures. You understand that. However, it will be a budget that</p>
<p>   will drive home the advantages that we have gained as a result of</p>
<p>   the decisions we took in the first two Budgets. It's no accident</p>
<p>   that unemployment is starting to look better. It's no accident</p>
<p>   that interest rates are down. It's no accident that inflation</p>
<p>   is down. It's a direct result of having done things, some of</p>
<p>   them unpopular in the short term. It's very easy for an Opposition</p>
<p>   or for interest groups in the community to run around saying "Howard's</p>
<p>   done this or Howard's done that" but if the net effect,</p>
<p>   if the total effect of what we've done is to deliver a stronger</p>
<p>   better economy, it means more jobs, lower interest rates, more investment</p>
<p>   and a better outlook for Australia. Now, that's our responsibility,</p>
<p>   and the Budget on Tuesday night should be seen in the context of</p>
<p>   that position. I mean, we did inherit a Budget deficit running at</p>
<p>   an annual rate of $10.5 billion. The total accumulated debt was</p>
<p>   around $95 - $100 billion when we came to office and we've</p>
<p>   done an absolutely Herculean job, I think, a first class job in</p>
<p>   reducing that and it's made us more respected and stronger</p>
<p>   and better and most importantly it's delivered real gains into</p>
<p>   the pockets of Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you find yourself in a position to perhaps do a little better</p>
<p>   on the Medicare agreement,. You've still got the deal with</p>
<p>   those recalcitrant Premiers who would suggest that you are in fact</p>
<p>   the recalcitrant one, and yet you can't reach any agreement</p>
<p>   on that $5.5 billion they say they need to get their hospitals out</p>
<p>   of crisis.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well since the Premiers conference, one of the States whose Premier</p>
<p>   walked out, namely Queensland, has signed up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He's got an election coming up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not how his Health Minister calls it. His Health</p>
<p>   Minister said that on the basis of a fuller understanding of the</p>
<p>   situation they felt that they had a much better deal and thought</p>
<p>   it was a good deal for Queensland, and we have offered something</p>
<p>   that represents a real increase of about 15% over five years. Now,</p>
<p>   when you think that we've got zero inflation and we say to</p>
<p>   the States, we are not just going to maintain the money in real</p>
<p>   terms that we are giving you, but we are going to, over a period</p>
<p>   of five years increase it by 15 per cent. That's a pretty good</p>
<p>   deal, and in addition to that, as a result of the decision that</p>
<p>   we took concerning the Gold Card for veterans, and that means giving,</p>
<p>   in effect, across the board, free medical treatment for all World</p>
<p>   War II veterans who saw active service but, at the moment, don't</p>
<p>   have that benefit. So we are extending it to all of those additional</p>
<p>   people and there's about 50,000 of them. As a result of that</p>
<p>   we are delivering more dollars into the pockets of the States over</p>
<p>   and above what we put on the table at the Premiers conference and</p>
<p>   the reason for that is that in calculating the money we put on the</p>
<p>   table, we made an allowance for the treatment of the veterans which</p>
<p>   is now no longer going to be at a cost to the States because of</p>
<p>   the Gold Card decision. But we are not asking for any kind of claw</p>
<p>   back or replacement so they're just going to be able to pocket</p>
<p>   that under the agreement. And, as far as we are concerned, we are</p>
<p>   going to pay them the money whether they sign up or not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yeah, but you are not paying the money that they want. I mean,</p>
<p>   that's....and there are people in the hospitals.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The States always argue that we should give them more money and,</p>
<p>   I mean, when you are giving a 15 per cent real increase, and when</p>
<p>   you look.....I have to say in defence of the Commonwealth that over</p>
<p>   the period of the Medicare agreement, which is about to expire,</p>
<p>   there was a 30 per cent increase in Commonwealth spending in the</p>
<p>   health area in Western Australia and that is against, I am sorry</p>
<p>   to say, is against, according to our calculations, a reduction in-so-far</p>
<p>   as the State spending is concerned. Now look, I have no vested interest</p>
<p>   in, sort of, trading rhetoric with State colleagues any more than</p>
<p>   State colleagues have a vested interest in trading rhetoric. I want</p>
<p>   to do the right thing by the people of Western Australia and we</p>
<p>   have done the right thing - a 15 per cent real increase. I say to</p>
<p>   them that whether there is an agreement signed or not, what we have</p>
<p>   put on the table, including the additional money coming out of the</p>
<p>   veterans decision, that money will be paid to the States whether</p>
<p>   they sign the agreement or not. I mean, we are not going to go back</p>
<p>   on what we have put on the table and come what may on the 1st of</p>
<p>   July, the increases will come into operation. It includes an allowance</p>
<p>   of $83 million throughout Australia to cover any further decline</p>
<p>   in the membership of private health insurance funds. So we are doing</p>
<p>   our part. Now, I understand the position of the States but, equally,</p>
<p>   we have responsibilities in relation to other aspects of health.</p>
<p>   I mean our responsibility for health doesn't start and finish</p>
<p>   in relation to the Medicare agreements. We have put a lot of resources</p>
<p>   into private health insurance and if we hadn't have done that</p>
<p>   there would be even fewer people in private health insurance now</p>
<p>   than there are.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay, can you stick around for a few more minutes? I'll just</p>
<p>   clear these commitments and then we'll come back with the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of Australia, John Howard.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, just looking overseas, but not too far, we've seen</p>
<p>   some disturbing scenes coming out of Indonesia. Are you worried?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Indonesia is going through a very difficult period of adjustment</p>
<p>   because of the IMF programme and the need to make changes. Food</p>
<p>   subsidies and fuel subsidies are being either reduced or removed</p>
<p>   and that's causing a lot of pain and a lot of difficulty for</p>
<p>   the population in Indonesia and I feel for the difficulty faced</p>
<p>   by Indonesians. We are helping. We've been very generous with</p>
<p>   our help and that's in our interests as well as Indonesia's.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But we are seeing pictures now that we probably wouldn't have</p>
<p>   seen weeks or months ago. Burning photographs of Suharto and uncontrolled</p>
<p>   rioting. Are you concerned given the proximity to Australia and</p>
<p>   what we are doing up there that the Indonesian Government might</p>
<p>   overplay its hand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't believe the Indonesian Government will overplay</p>
<p>   its hand. It would certainly be our view that it should not. We</p>
<p>   are a friend of Indonesia's. We don't necessarily agree</p>
<p>   with everything the Indonesian Government does, let me make it clear.</p>
<p>   We showed our friendship by supporting the rescue package and we</p>
<p>   also showed our friendship by persuading the IMF to impose a more</p>
<p>   realistic package. The original ideas, if they had been imposed</p>
<p>   without alteration, would have been too severe and the pace of adjustment</p>
<p>   too rapid and therefore the social dislocation that much more. We</p>
<p>   were able to bring our influence to bear, not only on the American</p>
<p>   Government but also on the IMF, and I am very pleased we did. We</p>
<p>   have made it more acceptable but it's still very difficult.</p>
<p>   I mean Indonesia has to make very big changes. They do have to make</p>
<p>   their financial system more transparent. They do have to recognise</p>
<p>   that unless they regain the respect of the international community</p>
<p>   then they are not going to get out of their economic troubles. And</p>
<p>   they do have to implement the elements of the IMF package although</p>
<p>   it's one that we worked to have moderated a little. Nobody</p>
<p>   should be in any doubt that we support the IMF package and we want</p>
<p>   it implemented and adhered to by the Indonesians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But should Australians realise that there are implications and</p>
<p>   there are consequences of civil unrest in our near neighbour?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if there were widespread and continuing civil unrest, the</p>
<p>   answer is that, of course, there are consequences - not in a threatening</p>
<p>   sense - but we look on Indonesia as, quite rightly, our nearest</p>
<p>   neighbour. It's the sixth largest country in the world. It's</p>
<p>   got 3,000 islands in the archipelago and it's a very, very</p>
<p>   important country in the international arrangement as far as we</p>
<p>   are concerned. And we are trying to be a friend, we ar</p>
<p>are concerned. And we are trying to be a friend, we are tyring to</p>
<p>   help, we are not an uncritical friend and we do say to the Indonesian</p>
<p>   Government that balance, moderation, restraint, understanding in</p>
<p>   dealing with the civilian population is what is required.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>John Howard, thanks for joining me this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A great pleasure.</p>
