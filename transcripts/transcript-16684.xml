    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd:Every now and then, in Australia, we do some genuinely good things together. Often in our national debate, it focuses on the things that are going wrong. Often in our national debate, it focuses on the things about which we disagree. However, I think there is a big room in our national debate to focus on those things we are doing well, and doing together. And tonight is one such occasion. When we come together, as the Minister has just said, as different Governments, one Australian, one West Australian, but most critically, in partnership with this local community of Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians. Can I say also to local Indigenous people how much, together with the Premier, I respect the contribution you continue to make to the betterment of your people here. I know something of the challenges you face, but not all of them. At the end of the day, I'm from over East, and I'm from Canberra. And I've only been here twice now. But I do understand something of the challenges you face. And that's why we'd like to see ourselves together with you as long-term partners as you carve out a future for your people.</p>
