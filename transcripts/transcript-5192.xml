on them to submit any proposals they have. In a statement<br />
released in Canberra, the Minister for Trade and Resources,<br />
Mr. Anthony, has said the proposals would be considered for<br />
financing through the Loan Council. However, Mr.' Anthony<br />
said the proposals would have to involve new projects and<br />
not programmes already approved. The Deputy Prime Minister<br />
said increases in world energy prices and recent disruptioins<br />
to the supply of crude oil had drawn attention to the importance<br />
of Australia's massive coal reserves and their use in<br />
generating electricity. Mr. Anthony said coal offered a<br />
relatively low-cost alternative to expensive and increasingly<br />
expensive petroleum products. As well, it provided an<br />
attractive energy source for industry. Mr. Anthony said Loan<br />
Council financing of coal-based electricity projects would<br />
help ensure that Australia had adequate electricity during the<br />
next decade and beyond.<br />

corporate history with the sugar group CSR seeking to get<br />

it 6oes not already own. This follows last month's share<br />
raid in which CSR paid $ 84 million for a 19 per cent holding<br />
in Theiss.<br />

Australian and Japanese Governments.<br />
