<p>Well thank you very much Mr Chairman, to my Parliamentary Colleagues,</p>
<p> Jackie Kelly, my Minister for Sport and Tourism, Janice Crosio the</p>
<p> Member for Prospect, Julia Irwin the Member for Fowler, other State</p>
<p> Parliamentary colleagues, Father and all the members of the Croatian</p>
<p> community.  Can I say</p>
<p> how delighted that Janette and I are to be here this morning to share</p>
<p> this very special occasion with you.</p>
<p>I am conscious of the importance of this event to your community.</p>
<p>  It's an opportunity to me, on behalf of your fellow Australians,</p>
<p> to say how much we honour the contribution of Australians of Croatian</p>
<p> descent to the building of the modern Australia.</p>
<p>The rest of us thank you for your dedication, for your loyalty to</p>
<p> Australia, for your hard work, for your sense of family and your sense</p>
<p> of community.  And I think</p>
<p> what a wonderful thing it is here under a beautiful warm winter sunshine</p>
<p> here in Australia, for me the Prime Minister of Australia to be saying</p>
<p> thank you to all of you, to remember as I do your past, to honour</p>
<p> the fact that the people of Croatia fought proudly and defiantly against</p>
<p> communism for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>I think it's always important to remember the past without allowing</p>
<p> the past to govern the present or to govern the future.</p>
<p>  Your present and your future is as part of the great Australian</p>
<p> nation.  But in being</p>
<p> part of the great Australian nation you're not asked to forget</p>
<p> your heritage, your history, and what your people have been through</p>
<p> and therefore it is marvelous, as part of the Australian democracy</p>
<p> and the Australian way of life that is part of the Australian community,</p>
<p> you preserve just a little bit of Croatia here, not only in this village</p>
<p> but also in the broader Australian community.</p>
<p>I think today is also an opportunity to recognise the importance,</p>
<p> as people grow older, Australians who were not born in this country</p>
<p> and whose mother-tongue is not English, it is important to recognise</p>
<p> the value of retirement villages and nursing homes that care for them.</p>
<p>  The Governor of Victoria, Sir James Gobbo, an Australian of</p>
<p> Italian descent, put it to me very well one day and I've never</p>
<p> forgotten his remark, when he said to me ÂJohn it's a bit</p>
<p> unrealistic to expect an elderly Italian lady to sit around the piano</p>
<p> singing the Road to GundagaiÂ.</p>
<p>  And, of course, that is true not only in relation to people</p>
<p> of Italian descent, but indeed to people whose mother-tongue is other</p>
<p> than English.  And as</p>
<p> one of the Directors of Nursing said to me on the way in, that she</p>
<p> had literally seen dementia peel away from people as they've</p>
<p> been able in their older years to communicate with the nursing staff</p>
<p> in their mother-tongue.</p>
<p>And as you rightly said in your introduction, as the years go by and</p>
<p> English becomes to so many people irrespective of their descent, their</p>
<p> mother-tongue the need for that will go.</p>
<p>  But at present it is a very important element of properly caring</p>
<p> for the elderly within our community.</p>
<p>  And it has been, let me say, the commitment of governments</p>
<p> of both political persuasion to provide continued help and support</p>
<p> for nursing homes and retirement villages of this kind.</p>
<p>And one of the measures of the humanity of a nation is the way in</p>
<p> which it does care for the old.</p>
<p>  In twenty years time there will be far more Australians over</p>
<p> the age of 65.  We will</p>
<p> live longer, we will be healthier as we live longer, and the need</p>
<p> to care for people in that age bracket will grow rather than diminish</p>
<p> and that has all sorts of implications for a whole range of public</p>
<p> policy issues, not only nursing home policy but a whole range of public</p>
<p> policy issues.</p>
<p>But today I'm here as the Prime Minister to say to you how much</p>
<p> we admire the contribution of your community to the building of the</p>
<p> Australian nation.  We</p>
<p> are conscious of the circumstances in which many of you left your</p>
<p> homeland.  I am very proud</p>
<p> of the fact that the Australian government was one of the very first</p>
<p> to recognise the independent Republic of Croatia only a few years</p>
<p> ago.</p>
<p>But even more importantly than that, you have come to Australia, you've</p>
<p> become part of the community, you've made your mark on the Australian</p>
<p> community, you've made your mark in business, in politics, in</p>
<p> sport.  In so many endeavours,</p>
<p> the contribution of people of Croatian descent to soccer in Australia,</p>
<p> for example, it is quite remarkable given the proportion of the Australian</p>
<p> population that people of Croatian descent represent.</p>
<p>  And in so many other fields the mark of Croatians on our country</p>
<p> is to be found.</p>
<p>But this is an occasion ladies and gentlemen not for long speeches</p>
<p> but for celebration.  It's</p>
<p> an occasion to thank you for your contribution.</p>
<p>  It's an occasion to celebrate the wonder of living in</p>
<p> Australia.  The freest,</p>
<p> open, most tolerant nation on earth.</p>
<p>And in honour of these, the man after whom this village is named,</p>
<p> it's an occasion to salute the steadfastness of people of Croatian</p>
<p> descent to their Catholic faith, which many of them maintained in</p>
<p> their homeland in very, very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>So can I say to all of you it's a great delight for Janette and</p>
<p> I to be present.  It's</p>
<p> a great delight to share for a few moments membership of the Australian</p>
<p> Croatian family and the Australian Croatian community.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for what you have done for Australia.</p>
