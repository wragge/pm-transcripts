Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I think you will know that I am keen to see that the story of World War II, and in<br />
particular the Pacific War, is told to Australians with thc same intensity and understanding<br />
that characterised our telling of the legends of Gallipoli, France and Palestine.<br />
For this reason I hope that we will be able to find the means of helping the Memorial<br />
develop its Pacific War Galleyj.<br />
And as Dame Beryl said, they arc now allocating $ 150,000 a year to the collection. And I<br />
don't think it would unravel the Budget numbers if I were to say to you we'll double that. </p>
