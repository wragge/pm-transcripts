    <content><![CDATA[<p>SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
JOHN 0. GORTON, MP, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
23 APRIL 1969<br />
DEFENCE SPACE COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY<br />
I have to inform the House that the Government has<br />
accepted proposals which were made by the United States Government<br />
for the establishment in Australia of a joint United States / Australian<br />
defence space communications facility.<br />
The facility will be located at Woomera. A site survey<br />
party from the United States is expected to visit Woomera soon.<br />
Construction should commence in September or October<br />
and the installation should be ready to operate by late 1970. The<br />
joint staff of Australian and U. S. personnel required to operate the<br />
station will be between 250 and 300.<br />
The construction of the station will be an important<br />
contribution to the defence of all free nations. It is a further and most<br />
important tangible expression of that close co-operation between the<br />
United States and Australia in defence matters which is embodied in<br />
the ANZUS Treaty. </p>
