<p>Well, thank you very much for those words of welcome, Dr Moyes, to</p>
<p> the Reverend Bob Dunlop, to Reverend Pamela McNally, to Ms Carmen</p>
<p> Duncan, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I've come here this morning for several reasons. I've come</p>
<p> partly to salute the work over a long period of time of LifeForce</p>
<p> and its predecessor and I suppose, its parent organisation, Lifeline,</p>
<p> which under the leadership of that great Australian, Sir Alan Walker,</p>
<p> was established so many years ago and for the first time, provided</p>
<p> an easily accessible human link between people in our community who</p>
<p> felt lonely, depressed, ignored, unfairly treated or who in any way</p>
<p> were shut out from, or alienated from society. And the concept that</p>
<p> help was as close as the telephone and the concept that our community</p>
<p> was warmhearted enough and decent enough and had within its ranks</p>
<p> enough good people willing to make their time available to help people</p>
<p> who needed help. Over the years, that has undoubtedly saved the lives</p>
<p> of countless thousands of Australians and it's given to those</p>
<p> countless Australians and their families new and fresh hope.</p>
<p>So I therefore want, this morning, to salute the work, not only of</p>
<p> LifeForce and Lifeline, but all the other organisations in Australia</p>
<p> that have worked so very hard to provide a link between what seems</p>
<p> to people in a desperate frame and a depressed frame of mind, a world</p>
<p> that is passing them by and ignoring them and unfairly treating them</p>
<p> - that's provided those people with a visible link.</p>
<p>I've also come to demonstrate my personal concern and the concern</p>
<p> of my Government about the level of suicide within the Australian</p>
<p> community. It is a matter of sadness that the rate of suicide particularly,</p>
<p> but not only, amongst young people and marginally greater amongst</p>
<p> young men than young women, is one of the great social failings of</p>
<p> the Australian community. I don't want to talk for very long</p>
<p> about the resources that we have made available. But we have significantly</p>
<p> increased the resources for fighting suicide and preventing suicide.</p>
<p> But more, I want to talk about the way in which there can be greater</p>
<p> community consciousness and also address some remarks particularly</p>
<p> to those people here this morning who have been directly touched by</p>
<p> the tragedy of suicide. And I hope that this morning's gathering</p>
<p> gives you some comfort. I hope that it is a token for you that the</p>
<p> rest of the Australian community thinks about the sadness that you</p>
<p> have suffered. I hope that you do derive a little comfort, that you</p>
<p> try and perhaps find a little understanding in it. I have not personally</p>
<p> been touched by suicide in the sense that many of you in this gathering</p>
<p> have been, but as a local member of Parliament and as just an ordinary</p>
<p> member of society I have spoken often with people who have been directly</p>
<p> touched. And I know the anguished questioning, the why? How is it</p>
<p> that it happened to me, to a member of my family? Where did I go wrong?</p>
<p> What could I have done? All the multitude of questions and the introspections</p>
<p> and the self-criticism that inevitably happens and the sense of despair</p>
<p> that perhaps if something had been done, or not done, things might</p>
<p> have been different. And I know that for many of you, the opportunity</p>
<p> to converse with others who have been similarly touched, to have an</p>
<p> understanding that your community, your government, the churches of</p>
<p> Australia and the other community organisations of Australia have</p>
<p> a very, very active concern and a great desire to help and to understand.</p>
<p>As a Member of Parliament, I've been touched on a number of occasions</p>
<p> by lengthy discussions I've had with constituents of mine who've</p>
<p> lost young children, or young adult children as a result of suicide</p>
<p> and they've had a very profound effect on me. As a society, we</p>
<p> have to collectively try and understand some of the reasons why the</p>
<p> rate of suicide is so high. We can't, as a community, escape</p>
<p> responsibility for it. We can't, as a community, ignore the impact</p>
<p> of youth unemployment. We can't, as a community, ignore the impact</p>
<p> of weaker family bonds. We can't, as a community, ignore the</p>
<p> impact of a lessened sense of personal and family responsibility which</p>
<p> is a characteristic of modern, western society of the 1980s and the</p>
<p> 1990s. Nor can we ignore the impact of the lessened role within our</p>
<p> community of institutions that stand for certain immutable values</p>
<p> and certain immutable principles of human conduct and human life.</p>
<p>The reasons why people take their own lives are mixed. There is no</p>
<p> one simple explanation but one thing that binds all of these incidents</p>
<p> together is of course, the enormous human tragedy that they represent</p>
<p> and the scars they leave, often forever, on those people who have</p>
<p> been directly affected.</p>
<p>Governments can help, they can fund programmes, they can recognise,</p>
<p> as I do, and as Dr Moyes does, that governments acting alone can't</p>
<p> solve or lessen the pain of this. Individuals acting alone can't</p>
<p> either, nor can organisations. We do need a shared endeavour, we need</p>
<p> the resources of the Government, we need the agencies of the Government,</p>
<p> we need the enormous moral commitment of organisations like the Wesley</p>
<p> Mission and we need the efforts of individuals in their own lives</p>
<p> to think about the alienation of a workmate, to wonder whether somebody</p>
<p> with whom we might be working feels left out of things and perhaps</p>
<p> we don't spend enough time talking to them about their personal</p>
<p> or family problems.</p>
<p>I once spoke to one of the telephone counsellors from an organisation</p>
<p> run by the De La Salle Brothers in Brisbane and he said that the thing</p>
<p> that had struck his organisation most about the telephone calls that</p>
<p> they'd had from young people was that the overwhelming bulk of</p>
<p> the telephone calls that they'd had from young people were young</p>
<p> people expressing a despair about the fact that they had absolutely</p>
<p> no capacity to communicate or to talk over their problems with anybody</p>
<p> in the world. They couldn't do it with their family members because</p>
<p> in some cases the family had disintegrated. In other cases, the family</p>
<p> unit members didn't care. Many of them didn't have jobs</p>
<p> and some of those that did have jobs found it quite impossible to</p>
<p> communicate with their workmates.</p>
<p>Now I think all of us can play a small part in spending a little more</p>
<p> time listening to people who seem to be making, I suppose, to put</p>
<p> it in one way, making heavy weather of their lives and who need help</p>
<p> and who need comfort and who need counsel.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I do want to associate my Government very</p>
<p> strongly with everything that can be done within the Australian community</p>
<p> to prevent suicide. It is a huge, collective social problem in this</p>
<p> country. It is a national disgrace that our suicide rate should be</p>
<p> as high as it is. It is the fault of no one thing, it is the fault</p>
<p> of no one group. We collectively, as a community must carry responsibility</p>
<p> and of course, the great tragedy is the opportunity of fulfilled lives</p>
<p> lost, the years of love, the years of contribution and the years of</p>
<p> playing an effective role within society that are lost.</p>
<p>But most importantly of all, it is an opportunity for me, on behalf</p>
<p> of the Australian community to extend our love and our understanding</p>
<p> and our thoughts to those here today and to those throughout our nation</p>
<p> who have been touched directly by the tragedy of suicide and to say</p>
<p> that we do care, we are trying to help. There are great organisations</p>
<p> like LifeForce, there is a government, there are communities who are</p>
<p> willing to help to try and lessen the pain and to try and help you</p>
<p> in the fullness of time to be more reconciled to and to be more at</p>
<p> peace with the tragedy that has overtaken your lives.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
