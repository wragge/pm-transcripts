FOR MEDIA-TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 1983<br />
VISIT TO SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA<br />
At the suggestion and request of the Premier of Tasmania,<br />
I will be visiting the South-West Tasmania Wilderness Area<br />
tomorrow. The senior Tasmanian Federal Minister, Kevin Newman, will<br />
accompany me on the visit.<br />
I have decided that I should take the opportunity while<br />
I am in Tasmania to go out to the region and have a good<br />
look at the Gordon and Franklin Rivers.<br />
I want to see for myself the country about which I have<br />
heard so much.<br />
I have, of course, talked to Doug Ainthony about his visit<br />
last week and I have the benefit of his views. EMBARGO: 44 5. OOPM </p>
