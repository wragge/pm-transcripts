    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will recommend to the Governor‑General that Mr Andrew Colvin APM OAM be appointed to the role of Australian Federal Police Commissioner.</p>
<p>Mr Colvin has been Acting Federal Police Commissioner since the retirement of Commissioner Tony Negus in September. Prior to that he was Deputy Commissioner for National Security.</p>
<p>He has performed with distinction over recent weeks as the Public Terror Threat Level was raised to High and the Australian Federal Police, working with other security agencies, executed some of the largest counter-terrorism operations in Australia’s history.</p>
<p>During his 24 year career with the Australian Federal Police, Mr Colvin has distinguished himself as a counter-terrorism expert.</p>
<p>He established the AFP counter-terrorism portfolio, has overseen domestic and international AFP terrorism investigations, had operational oversight of aviation, protection and international deployment group portfolios and led the high-tech crime portfolio.</p>
<p>He also currently co-chairs the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering which counters the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>In recognition of his service to the police Bali bombing investigation and victim identification process, Mr Colvin received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2003.</p>
<p>Mr Colvin was AFP Chief of Staff from 2005-2007 where he led the AFP Professional Standards branch, as well as the policy, legal and government relations functions.</p>
<p>Mr Colvin has the vision, commitment and energy required to lead Australia’s national policing agency, forge national and international strategic partnerships and build on the AFP’s already strong approach to complex crime and security issues.</p>
<p>We congratulate Mr Colvin on his appointment at a time when Australia faces some of its greatest national security challenges.</p>
