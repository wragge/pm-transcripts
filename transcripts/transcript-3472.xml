PRESS STATEMENT NO. 373<br />
18 November 1974<br />
CRUDE OIL POLICY<br />
The Prime Minister announced that a regulation under<br />
the Prices Justification Act 1973-1974 had been gazetted today<br />
removing the supply of Australian indigenous crude oil from the<br />
application of that Act. The recently announced proposed price<br />
increase by Ampol Exploration Ltd. will thus no longer come<br />
within the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification Tribunal.<br />
The Prime Minister stated that the price applicable<br />
to indigenous crude oil production was determined in October<br />
1968 by the then Government as a part of indigenous crude oil<br />
policy and had been fixed for the period ending 17 September,<br />
1975. It was therefore inappropriate for this matter to be<br />
dealt with under the Prices Justification Act.<br />
