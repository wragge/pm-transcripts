FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 5/ 1970<br />
MR. WHITLAM'S SUPPORT OF MATAUNGAN ASSOCIATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Whitlam has reached new heights of arrogance.<br />
He went to speak to the Mataungan Association a<br />
section of the Tolai people who had used violence, who were refusing<br />
to pay taxes, who were refusing to abide by a legally elected council.<br />
He told them according to newsmen whom he admits " faithfully<br />
reported" him that he admired this Association, its expression,<br />
and its spokesmen and was impressed by the patriotic fervour with<br />
which they expressed their feelings.<br />
If he does not feel that this supported and encouraged<br />
that organisation he must be the only one who doesn't. Certainly the<br />
responsible leading natives of New Guinea, who told him to go home<br />
and stop fermenting trouble, don't agree with him. I fear he has<br />
increased the risk of violence in the area.<br />
If any apology is required it should come from Mr.<br />
Whitlam to the Australian people for stating he had undertaken this<br />
journey on their behalf, and suggesting he was their spokesman, when<br />
the Australian people had so recently refused him the right either to<br />
govern them or to speak for them.<br />
