TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RUSSELL POWELL, RADIO 2GB3, 11 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
RP: Prime Minister, Good Afternoon.<br />
PM: How are you, Russell?<br />
RP: I am well. Now, leaving aside the funding side for a moment, because<br />
a lot of people have talkedabout that throughout the day, the Budget<br />
is also being seen as an election primer. How do you react to that? Is<br />
it?<br />
PM: Well, that is just a bit of nonsense. I mean, elections are too hard to<br />
win, without simply giving them away quickly or cheaply. So, we have<br />
got plenty of time to run.<br />
RP: Now, the funding side and the growth forecast. Many are saying those<br />
forecasts are too optimistic?<br />
PM: Look we are running at the moment at about 4 per cent growth. And<br />
as a consequence, here's the Liberal Party arguing between 4<br />
per cent. Now, I remind you of this, Russell, we grew on average at<br />
per cent through the 1980s. But the economy is now far more<br />
subtle, inflation is much lower, there is a productivity culture in the<br />
country, in the community, in the business community, we have not<br />
had in the past. And as a consequence there is every reason why<br />
Australia could grow at least as fast as it did in the recovery phase of<br />
the 1980s. Now, we had in the forecast last evening 4.5 per cent<br />
growth and as a consequence we are predicting half a per cent above<br />
what we had for the year. That is, we have had growth in the year to<br />
March of 4 per cent, and so we have got to haggle now over 4 or<br />
per cent. Now, the Liberal Party was telling us, Dr Hewson was telling<br />
us in the last election that we were going to have a double dip </p>
<p>recession, that we are actually in for a depression. And now, they<br />
have got the front to be up there arguing about whether the growth rate<br />
is going to be 4 or 4.5 per cent.<br />
RP: Well some of the asset sell offs, which are also part of the funding, the<br />
left has been critical of. In fact, I had Laurie Ferguson on the air last<br />
night, John Button once said he wasn't concerned about any asset<br />
sell-offs, except Qantas. Well, Qantas is among them.<br />
PM: Yes, that is right Qantas is amongst them. But it doesn't change the<br />
character of the Budget. We have got outlays spending in the Budget<br />
running at below the rate of growth of the economy. Outlays are<br />
running at 3.1 per cent growth. If you take the asset sales out of that<br />
they are growing at 2.9 per cent. So, it is making no difference<br />
whatsoever to the general pattern of the Budget. And things like<br />
Qantas, frankly, will be much better in private sector hands because<br />
they can keep the capital up to them, run them effectively and<br />
efficiently, and of course, with a big share holder like British Airways,<br />
and linking Qantas into the British Airways world system will make<br />
Qantas a much better and stronger company than it is today. I think<br />
we have got to be interested in what we do with these things at<br />
institutions. It is like the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth<br />
Bank is worth as much to the Commonwealth today, we have sold half<br />
of it, yet we have had billions paid to the Budget, and yet it is still worth<br />
as much as when we started.<br />
RP: But you only get one go at those kind of things, of course.<br />
PM: Yes, I know. But I mean, there are always some asset sales in the<br />
Budget. I mean the Commonwealth acquires assets all the time for<br />
various reasons over the years. It has got to be in a position to<br />
dispose of some at the same time.<br />
RP: Ok, harking back to the White Paper, can I say, I think there will be<br />
many people out there cheering for the parenting allowance<br />
announced there. Many people who perhaps aren't even organised<br />
lobby groups, but who feel that they have been missing out on choice<br />
in that area. The choice to stay home and look after the kids, they now<br />
have that choice as a result of the White Paper. That was obviously<br />
your feeling as well, that the choice wasn't there?<br />
PM: What we have done with the White Paper on the Social Security side<br />
has completely changed the way in which the Soci'al Security system<br />
works. For all of the post war years we have presumed in the Social<br />
Security system that it is today like it was in 1945, that you have got a<br />
married couple and one person either at work or unemployed. Well, in<br />
fact, now both couples in a marriage or a partnership go to work, often<br />
go to work. So, the change we have in the White Paper is rather than<br />
jointly income testing and work testing a couple, we are giving a half </p>
<p>married rate unemployment benefit to each person, and then we<br />
income test and work test them both. But the spouse who is looking<br />
after children can elect to receive the parenting allowance rather than<br />
be work tested. So, if you take, let's say generally the mother, a<br />
woman under 40 who has got a couple of children, who is likely in her<br />
terms to choose not to be looking for work, then we will pay her the half<br />
married rate unemployment benefit and she won't lose it simply<br />
because her husband or spouse earns a bit of income. Whereas,<br />
before the White Paper we had this sudden death taper of 100 per<br />
cent. That is, if you picked up a dollar of income you would lose a<br />
dollar off the unemployment benefit. We have now got a 50 per cent<br />
taper and a 70 per cent taper cutting in at different points. So, it<br />
means that unemployed people can actually go and get part time work<br />
and add to their unemployment benefit, and in the doing of it, let's say<br />
the husband of a couple, wouldn't diminish the wife's benefit until he<br />
earns $ 230.00 over the unemployment benefit. So, what it means is,<br />
Russell, what it means is that people can' now, if they have the<br />
incentive to take on work, particularly part time work, they will end up<br />
with more income, and the spouse caring for the children has a real<br />
choice about whether she wants to line up for UB, unemployment<br />
benefit, and the work test or stay at home and receive the parenting<br />
allowance, which is about $ 132.65 a week.<br />
RP: And it is an important recognition of what she is doing as well.<br />
PM: It is. And there is also the home child care allowance we introduced in<br />
the Budget of last year following the commitment I made in the<br />
election.<br />
PR: Well it is clear looking at your own family life that there are areas there<br />
that you feel pretty strongly about. I remember the crack down on<br />
violence on TV, part of that was motivated by what you had seen your<br />
own kids watching. And I understand that your wife Annita had a part<br />
to play in the breast cancer allocation as well. Some people may<br />
criticise that, but I think it is a recognition that you are drawing from<br />
real life the issues that are affecting Australians?<br />
PM: Well, I think she has made the point to me on a number of occasions<br />
about the problems of understanding breast cancer. The problems of<br />
detection and how it should best be treated. So, we have increased<br />
funding in this area, quite dramatically, to increase primary research<br />
into the disease, but also to extend the screening program so that<br />
there is earlier detection. And some of that research in various<br />
branches of research into generic cancer, in a generic sense and<br />
breast cancer in particular, will, I think, probably let us understand it<br />
better and treat it more effectively once it is discovered. </p>
<p>RP: Of course there is the statement today too, that men have significant<br />
problems, prostate cancer is another area that may well be worth<br />
targeting? That is a huge problem.<br />
PM: Well, it is. I think, that a lot of the research for these sorts of cancers<br />
is generic. They go to the mutations of cells and this is of a generic<br />
variety rather than an organic variety. But, this will be allocated, of<br />
course, sensibly by those who know where the research programs are<br />
and what merit they have and who should receive the funds.<br />
RP: Well, you have the Budget out of the way, you have Mabo now out of<br />
the way, is it time to concentrate back on the republican issue? Is that<br />
an issue that you're going to be raising again now?<br />
PM: Well, it is an issue that I campaigned along on in the 1993 election and<br />
I have raised it from time to time and I'll continue to raise it. I think,<br />
that Australia has got a tremendously good future in the 1990s as a<br />
competitive economy with a productivity culture we've never really had<br />
before; a very high premium on education and training and product<br />
innovation; big links now we've made into Asia, we are exporting<br />
per cent of our exports into Asia, we've taken exports from 14 per cent<br />
of GDP of all we produce, to now 21 per cent. So, there is a big<br />
change in the character of the Australian economy and its society and<br />
there are great opportunities for us in Asia, as well as home, and I've<br />
always believed that these will always be enhanced by the country<br />
being more confident about itself. Reflecting in its identity and<br />
understanding what that identity is. Hence, the natural extension of<br />
that is, that we manage our own affairs.<br />
RP: Sure, that's been moderated though in recent times. I think the debate<br />
has gone a little quiet. Does it need to accelerate or are you happy<br />
with the pace of that debate proceeding?<br />
PM: Let's say this, Russell, it is on simmer. It is simmering away out there.<br />
It is a real life issue with people now and they think about it and they<br />
talk about it and they talk about it in schools and it is an after dinner<br />
matter for discussion. You know, you'll get it in the after dinner debate,<br />
I mean, this was not true a few years ago. So, the work which the<br />
Republican Advisory Committee did under Malcolm Turnbull's<br />
chairmanship was a very good piece of paper, a very interesting<br />
document; the first of its kind looking at the modalities or models of a<br />
shift to a republic and how it might be done. And, I think, it provided<br />
the debate with a very good basis and we'll be continuing to participate<br />
in that debate from time to time.<br />
But, we have been focussing on the White Paper and on the Budget<br />
and, as you've mentioned, Mabo. One of the things I would like to<br />
communicate to people is that the Government has kept its election<br />
commitments in respect of the things it said it would do Mabo, the first </p>
<p>round of tax cuts have been paid, we've got now our commitment to the<br />
long term unemp! oyed, we've picked it up with the White Paper, which<br />
is a novel thing just not in Australian terms, but in international terms.<br />
We are doing something here that I don't think is being done in any<br />
comparable countries. That is intensively case managing on a one-toone<br />
personal basis over half a million people 500,000 we estimate<br />
will be intensively case managed in the coming year to understand<br />
their personalities, their aptitudes, their educational standards, their<br />
work experience and place them back into society. In doing that, not<br />
only will we do something which is good and efficient for the economy,<br />
that is, in complementing skills formation and the economy, but we are<br />
doing something which is also giving Australia some more social<br />
cohesion and equity. I am very proud of that and we've now got a big<br />
job of work to do to make sure that works.<br />
Of course, the Budget consolidates all that and in the Budget we have<br />
got some other important changes. The Land Fund for Aboriginal<br />
people, $ 500 million there on health; $ 135 million for the preparation of<br />
our Olympic team; $ 209 million on breast cancer; an immunisation<br />
program for children and all in the context of declining Budget deficit<br />
coming well within the target of 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 as<br />
promised.<br />
RP: OK, but you are confident you can get the growth to fund that and the<br />
business investment?<br />
PM: Well, the four quarters in the year to March came out at 4 per cent so,<br />
we are nudging that up half a point when profits have never been<br />
higher, when the exchange rate is competitive, when inflation is low<br />
and interest rates are low, a 33 per cent corporate tax rate legislated<br />
after the election in last years Budget, links into Asia we haven't had,<br />
tremendous growth in exports. If we can't screw a half a percentage<br />
point out of it, then at this stage of the cycle Russell, I think, we are all<br />
whistling dixie.<br />
RP: OK, just finally, can I take you to a matter you touched on a little<br />
moment ago. The election promise has been kept for the first round of<br />
the tax cuts, the second round of the tax cuts have been deferred, are<br />
they gone forever?<br />
PM: Well, what I said a year or so ago, I said, we were deferring the<br />
second round for payment probably in 1998, but depending on how our<br />
fiscal conditions are at the time. What we need to keep an eye on is,<br />
first of all we are carrying the full costs this year of the November 1 tax<br />
cuts. You see, you pay the tax cuts last November, but that's not the<br />
end of it, those tax cuts keep being paid every week and they're now,<br />
for the full year, consolidated in this Budget. So, we will be looking at<br />
how the economy picks up, how capital formation is, looking at<br />
investment and the demands on national savings to see what is the </p>
<p>appropriate timing for another round of tax cuts. Now, we'll do that a<br />
little later than now when it becomes a little more clear what those<br />
various influences are.<br />
RP: Have you got a probability rating on that?<br />
PM: Well, can I just say this, all the tax cuts that the Government said it<br />
would deliver from 1983 onwards, it delivered. And, I think the best<br />
thing to do is look at our record. The other thing, I think, which is<br />
important to understand is in this period, say, 1995 right out to 1997-98<br />
where we are forecasting now over a four year period, we are doing it<br />
without a rise in general revenue. In 1994-95 the estimate, that's for<br />
all revenue, to GDP is 23.7 per cent. We expect it to be 23.8 per cent<br />
only a decimal point difference in 1997-98. Now, in all recoveries like<br />
this we've seen the tax to GDP ratio rise by over two percentage<br />
points. In the 1970s it went up from 22.5 per cent to 24.5 per cent. In<br />
the 1960s it went up from around 21 per cent to around 22.5 per cent.<br />
In this recovery it will be pretty flat which means we are not relying on<br />
a huge revenue poultice to bring the Budget deficit down.<br />
RP: Yes, so on that basis you are confident they will be there in 1998?<br />
PM: What I'm saying is, that the Government's intention is that the<br />
incidence of tax over time shouldn't rise unnecessarily even with<br />
modest inflation. That is, with the impact of modest inflation on the tax<br />
scales and at a time appropriate to Australia's fiscal needs and general<br />
savings, we'll introduce a second round.<br />
RP: OK, Prime Minister, we'll leave it there. I know you have other things<br />
to do. I thank you for giving us this time and I hope we'll talk with you<br />
again soon.<br />
PM: A pleasure. Thank you very much, Russell.<br />
ends </p>
