    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government will invest in projects that bust congestion to ensure Australians can get home to their families sooner and safer, through a $1 billion Urban Congestion Fund.</p>
<p>The Fund forms part of the Government’s $75 billion ten-year pipeline of infrastructure across every state and territory which was announced in this week’s Budget.</p>
<p>It is a new initiative that will help the states and territories to eliminate the pinch-points and bottlenecks which frustrate commuters on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Congestion is having a negative impact on productivity by obstructing access to ports and markets and adding to operating costs.</p>
<p>The estimated avoidable cost of congestion is over $16.5 billion per year.</p>
<p>The Fund will support projects that bust congestion, with a focus on last mile access to export ports, airports, employment and freight hubs.</p>
<p>Due to the types of projects that will be supported through the Fund, the states and territories will be asked to match funding for projects on a 50:50 basis.</p>
<p>The use of innovative funding and financing opportunities will also be encouraged.</p>
<p>The Fund will help to drive better productivity outcomes, improved efficiency and job creation.</p>
<p>It will also complement the support provided to regional corridors through the $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance (ROSI) initiative by assisting freight operators and commuters experiencing congestion when they reach urban areas.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government’s pipeline of infrastructure includes $24.5 billion worth of new projects.</p>
<p>These investments can only be made because of the Turnbull Government’s strong Budget management.</p>
<p>By getting the budget under control, the Liberal and Nationals Government is able to invest in the critical infrastructure that will make a real difference to the lives of all Australians.</p>
