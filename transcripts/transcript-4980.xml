REPORT OF THE STUDY GROUP ON STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
Mr. MALCOLMFRASER ( Wannon Prime Minister)<br />
For the information of honourable members, I present the<br />
Report of the Study Group on Structural Adjustment, and seek<br />
leave to make a statement on the future handling of the Report.<br />
The Study Group, chaired by Sir John Crawford, was set up to<br />
examine and advise the Government on the adjustment problems of<br />
Australian manufacturing industries. Other members of the Study<br />
Group were Sir Brian Inglis ( Chairman of the Government's<br />
Australian Manufacturing Council and Managing Director of Ford<br />
Australia); Mr. R. J. L. Hawke ( President, Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions); and Mr. N. S. Currie ( Secretary, Department of<br />
Industry and Commerce). I would like to place on record the<br />
Government's thanks to the members of the Study Group and<br />
particularly to the Chairman. The Study Group's Report<br />
represents a further contribution made by Sir John in the course<br />
of a long and distinguished career.<br />
Mr. Speaker, in its preface, the Study Group expresses<br />
its concern that " expectations about its Report have been raised<br />
too high in many quarters".. As the Report makes clear, the<br />
challenges facing Australian manufacturing industry are great<br />
and there are no easy solutions. The answers are necessarily<br />
to be found in a wide complex of policy measures. The Report,<br />
as requested in the Terms of Reference has addressed itself<br />
to these measures. </p>
<p>In the view of the Report, lower population growth<br />
rates, technological change, import competition, changing<br />
patterns of consumer demand, and wage cost pressures are all<br />
part of the challenge requiring these measures. The Report<br />
notes that: " In the early 1970s, wages especially, those<br />
for women, increased sharply, partly as the<br />
result of the introduction of equal pay.<br />
In 1973-74 alone, minimum award wages<br />
increased 37 per cent for females, and 27 per<br />
cent for males."<br />
In addition the Report underlines the fact that:<br />
" Government action has at times Contributed<br />
to the adjustment pressures on industry. The<br />
per cent across-the-board tariff cut in<br />
1973, appreciations of the exchange rate in<br />
1972 and 1973, and a scaling down of the Export<br />
Incentive Scheme in 1974 are important examples<br />
of such actions. However, more recent Government<br />
actions have been directed towards reducing<br />
inflation and reducing external pressures on the<br />
hardest-pressed import-competing industries<br />
through limiting imports by quotas and temporary<br />
increases in tariffs. Devaluations of the<br />
Australian dollar since 1974 have also assisted<br />
the import-competing industries as well as the<br />
export sector."<br />
The Report proposes a series of positive measures to<br />
respond to the challenges and opportunities faced by Australian<br />
manufacturing industries. The Government believes that the<br />
analysis and recommendations contained in the Report will be an<br />
important contribution to its consideration of long-term policies<br />
to assist industry to adjust to a changing environment and to<br />
promote sound industrial growth in the future. The Report also<br />
provides a focus for all interested parties in their evaluation of<br />
future prospects for Australian industry. ./ 3 </p>
<p>The Report endorses and considerably elaborates the<br />
need identified in the White Paper on Manufacturing Industry<br />
for Australian industry to become more competitive, better<br />
able to compete with imports and to enter export markets.<br />
The manufacturing sector must be export oriented if it is to<br />
use fully our resources and skills. The Australian market is<br />
seen by the Report as being too limited for any other policy.<br />
The Study Group is " in favour of the Government<br />
following policies that set the right climate for investment and<br />
growth" and it has proposed an extended range of incentives as<br />
the principal means of encouraging industry to become more<br />
competitive and export-oriented. In this way, the Report<br />
believes growth rates in the sector can be raised and employment<br />
better sustained and expanded.<br />
Many of the areas covered by the Report are matters<br />
to which the Government is giving continued attention: export<br />
development, industrial research and development, investment<br />
incentives, productivity improvement and industrial financing.<br />
The Government has already introduced taxation<br />
concessions to encourage investment; made significant improvements<br />
to export incentives; substantially increased funding for<br />
industrial research and development; and instituted other<br />
programmes designed to improve productivity in industry. In<br />
addition, particular emphasis has been given to increasing our<br />
efforts to secure better access to overseas markets for Australian </p>
<p>4.<br />
goods, a matter heavily emphasised in the Report.<br />
The Crawford Study Group believes that further<br />
improvements could be made in the range of programmes and has<br />
put forward a large body of recommendations. It sees the<br />
need for a " positive" strategy to deal with adjustment<br />
problems, what it terms an " industrial adaptation policy".<br />
Other elements in the strategy outlined and developed in the<br />
Report include the gradual adjustment downwards in the higher<br />
reaches of Australian protection levels; an overseas trade policy<br />
designed to secure markets for Australian manufacturing exports;<br />
manpower policies to help the workforce to adjust to new<br />
employment opportunities; and special policies for the most<br />
highly protected industries, aimed at easing the process of<br />
adjustment for them.<br />
Each of the Study Group's recommendations will be given<br />
very careful consideration. Many of them have far-reaching<br />
implications. In a number of cases, the Study Group's analysis<br />
of particular issues will as it recognises be complemented<br />
by related studies commissioned by the Government such as the<br />
Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training, the Inquiry<br />
into the Process of Technological Change in Australian Industry and<br />
the Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. </p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Report will be a very valuable input<br />
to the Government's decision-making process. It is very much<br />
concerned with what the authors believe to be necessary and<br />
practical programmes. It will assist the Government to ensure<br />
that future policy decisions will contribute to the maximum<br />
possible extent to achieving the Government's overall economic<br />
and industry policy objectives, and to improving the competitive<br />
position of Australian industry and to assisting the transfer of<br />
resources to those competitive, export-oriented industries which<br />
in the years ahead must provide the basis for a successful<br />
industry policy and enable manufacturing to play a much stronger<br />
role in the economy as a whole.<br />
Significant progress has been made in bringing down<br />
inflation and improving the competitive position of local<br />
industries and the Report recognises that " manufacturing is in a<br />
better position to export than it has been for some time". There<br />
is now evidence that Australian industries are increasingly being<br />
able to exploit market opportunities overseas and that our<br />
improved competitive position has generated significant interest<br />
in new investment in local industry. It is essential that these<br />
gains be sustained and new opportunities actively sought if the<br />
economic growth which would facilitate structural adjustment is to<br />
be realised. In view of the importance and breadth of the matters<br />
raised in the Study Group's Report, it is being tabled now so that<br />
it can be widely and intensively discussed and the community's / 6 </p>

response registered by the Government. A special Committee of<br />
Ministers has been set up to coordinate the Government's<br />
assessment of the recommendations. This Committee will be<br />
chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Other<br />
members will be the Ministers for Primary Industry, Education,<br />
Industrial Relations, the Treasurer, Employment and Youth<br />
Affairs, Productivity, Business and Consumer Affairs, and<br />
Special Trade Representations. </p>
