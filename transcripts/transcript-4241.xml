FOR PRESS SEPTEMBER 27, 1976<br />
TEXT OF ADDRESS GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE ROY MILNE<br />
LECTURE IN SYDNEY.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be here to deliver the Roy Milne<br />
Lecture. Tonight I would like to talk about asoects of foreign policy:<br />
the problems and possibilities that the construction of foreign<br />
policy in a democracy poses; the resources that a democracy has<br />
in de-veloping and implementing foreign policy; some of the<br />
Gover :. ent's perspectives on international issues; and the types<br />
of influence that Australia can have in the world.<br />
The basic goals of our foreign policy are quite simply ensuring<br />
the continuance of a vigorously democratic Australia working<br />
effectively towards a world where people have the opportunity<br />
to live in dignity and self-respect.<br />
This, of necessity, must be a world in which the dangers of war<br />
and conflict are diminished and where the international<br />
environment is favourable to these ends.<br />
These foreign policy goals are ambitious ones, their pursuit<br />
will take patience and persistence and require the skillful use<br />
of our nation's resources.<br />
Many people, however, regard democracies as being incapable of<br />
pursuing foreign policy goals effectively.<br />
It is often argued that the advantages democracies have in<br />
domestic affairs are: the responsiveness of democratic political<br />
leaders: the positive influence of democratic public opnion; and<br />
the openness of the political life of democracies; are antithetical<br />
to the achievement of foreign policy goals in a complex<br />
world of sovereign nation states.<br />
Alex de Tocqueville put this view in commenting on the United<br />
States in the early 19th century:<br />
" foreign politics demands scarcely any of those<br />
cualities which are peculiar to a democracy.<br />
They require on the contrary the perfect use<br />
of almost all those in which it is deficient. </p>
<p>SE 2.<br />
' A democracy can only with great difficulty regulate<br />
the details of an important undertaking, persevere in<br />
a fixed design, and work out its execution in spite of<br />
serious obstacles.<br />
It cannot combine its measures with secrecy or await<br />
their consequences with patience."<br />
Rather more recently, Walter Lippman attributed weaknesses in<br />
democratic foreign policy to public opinion, saying:<br />
" The unhappy truth is that the prevailing public opinion has<br />
been wrong at the critical junctures the people have<br />
imposed a veto upon the judgements of informed and<br />
responsible officials."<br />
" they have compelled the governments which usually knew<br />
what would have been wiser. Or was necessary. Or was<br />
more expedient. To be too late with too little, or<br />
too long with too much. Too pacifist in peace and too<br />
bellicose in war. Too neutralist or appeasing in<br />
negotiation or too instransigent."<br />
This is a formidable indictment, even if the people who draw it up<br />
betray a rather aristocratic disdain for the good sense of the<br />
democratic people a preference for decision-making by a select<br />
elite with the best knowledge and true insight on what the<br />
nation-' s best interests are.<br />
His'tcri-ca experience, however, provides a basis for these<br />
observations. Non-democratic leaders do not need to be highly responsive' to<br />
popular demands. Consequently, they are capable of rapid policy<br />
changes to take advantage of emerging opportunities.<br />
They are not constrained to a similar degree by compelling<br />
considerations of public morality.<br />
They are not under the constant scrutiny of independent and<br />
influential mass media.<br />
It cannot be denied that on occasion, democratic governments have<br />
failed to conduct foreign policies in accord with their nation's<br />
best interests.<br />
The nineteen thirties stand out as perhaps the starkest instance of<br />
the failure of democracies in foreign policy.<br />
Manifestly, in this period, the world's democracies failed to<br />
respond adequately to the menace of fascism.<br />
Seeking to appease fascism they succeeded only in increasing its<br />
strength, capacity and appetite.<br />
Their policy of appeasement brought democracy to the brink of<br />
disaster and toppled the world into six years of war.<br />
This failure has often been attributed to the impact of public<br />
opinion on politicians. Faced by depression, and by domestic<br />
conflicts between left and right wing ideologies the democratic<br />
peoples of Europe are said to have turned inward. </p>
<p>Desiring to ignore the reality beyond their borders they<br />
. implicitly threatened democratic leaders with electoral<br />
rejection if they acted to stifle aggression while it was<br />
still weak.<br />
One by one, the milestones towards the second world war<br />
were passed, German rearmament, the impotence of the league<br />
of nations, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, and Munich.<br />
The desire of the people for peace was clear, but the overriding<br />
responsibility of democratic leaders was to make known to their<br />
people, the consequences of inaction.<br />
Instead they avoided responsibility in the attempt to gain a<br />
transient and soon to be shattered popularity.<br />
The failure of the democracies in the 1930s was not the product<br />
of the inability to perceive the many consequences of inaction<br />
the failure was produced by an abnegation of responsibility on<br />
the part of democratic leaders.<br />
Charcteristic of this abnegation, was the behaviour of the<br />
French Premier, Edouard Daladier on his return from negotiating<br />
the Munich Agreement, which sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler.<br />
As his aerozplne landed at Le Bourget Airport, a happy crowd rushed<br />
forward to meet it.<br />
Nctknowirg -nhat the crowd's attitude was, frightened that the<br />
crowd was aemonstrating against the agreement, Daladier hesitated<br />
to alight-<br />
Turning to one of his party, he said of the Agreement:<br />
" It was not brilliant, but I have done all that I could.<br />
How will they receive it?"<br />
When assured that the crowd was welcoming him, he snapped:<br />
" Idiots. They do not know what they applaud."<br />
And he did not tell them. Instead he represented Munich as<br />
a triumph of statesmanship.<br />
These facts show that democracies do have weaknesses in the<br />
implementation of foreign policy.<br />
A partic'-ar type of public mood, conflict dividing society,<br />
a lack f on the part of political leaders, the fear that<br />
they i-_ I be reproved for stating the truth about the international<br />
situ--icn, c.-bine to paralyse democratic foreign policy.<br />
This paralysis is manifest in Stanley Baldwin's statement " supposing<br />
I had g: one o z-he country and said that Germany was rearming and<br />
we r.'. st rea=, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would<br />
have rallied to the cry at that moment? I cannot think of anything<br />
that would . have made the loss of the election from my point of view<br />
more certain.: / 4 </p>
<p>We cannot wave history away and assert that our system of<br />
government does not have the potential for failure.<br />
We cannot deny that on occasions democracy has failed everywhere<br />
but in the ultimate test of strength, a test that has been<br />
fraught with greater risks and met at a higher cost because<br />
of the policy failures which precipitated it.<br />
We cannot accept however, that potential weakenesses need<br />
inevitably be translated into actual weaknesses. It is only<br />
pessimism that deems the worst possibilities to be on the<br />
verge of realisation.<br />
Despite the possibility of failure, a willingness to look<br />
reality in the face shows that the diversity of opinion and the<br />
wide distribution of power characteristic of democracies are not<br />
merely compatible with an effective foreign policy, but in the<br />
proper combinations, they are resources of unparalleled potency.<br />
An active and informed public conducting an extensive discussion<br />
and debate of international issues is a prerequisit for the very<br />
for-ulation of a foreign policy which is appropriate to the<br />
time and circumstances a foreign policy which is adaptive and<br />
flexible, and which can respond to events while still retaining<br />
its integrity and purpose.<br />
If foreign policy is to have these attributes the process of<br />
foreign policy formulation cannot be restricted to governments<br />
alone.<br />
This would involve the denial, the unwillingness to use resources<br />
which could improve the quality and depth of our foreign policy.<br />
The complexity of the world and Australia's geographic position<br />
imposes special requirements if the Government's perceptions<br />
of world trends are to be adequately developed by sound information,<br />
a sophisticated and objective process of evaluation.<br />
Governments have considerable resources with which to gather<br />
information about foreign events, about the postures, intentions and<br />
capabilities of other governments, international political and<br />
social tendencies, and the opportunities and risks that exist<br />
in the world.<br />
The Australian Diplomatic Service composed not only of Foreign<br />
Affairs personnel but also personnel from other Departments,<br />
such as Treasury, National Resources and Defence is by any<br />
standards o. e of exceptionally high quality.<br />
It is staffed by people of the highest expertise and motivated by<br />
a sense of duty to Australia's national interest.<br />
The efforts and expertise of our diplomats provide the<br />
foundtions on which the foreign policy perspectives and actions<br />
of successive Australian Governments are based. </p>
<p>The high quality and dedication of Australia's diplomats<br />
does not however mean that other non governmental perspectives<br />
of foreign policy, other interpretations on the world, and how<br />
to best pursue Australia's national interests are redundant.<br />
The-foreign service does not monopOlise the expertise available<br />
in Australia. The public voicing of alternative views, the<br />
existence of different emphasis adds to the possibilities for<br />
an effective foreign policy.<br />
In part, this is because the very organisational structure which<br />
makes the work of the foreign service so indispensable, also<br />
establishes some pressures towards inertia.<br />
Henry Kissinger has put the problem in the following way:.<br />
" It is a paradoxical aspect of modern bureaucracies that<br />
their quest for objectivity and calculability often<br />
leads to impasses which can be overcome only by essentially<br />
arbitrary means."<br />
By " arbitrary . eans" of course he means extra bureaucratic ones,<br />
particularly -he personal diplomacy of which he has been the<br />
twentieth ce=. ury's prime exemplar.<br />
In the modern international system, personal interventions,<br />
top level . e-. rings between the'representatives of a nation are<br />
unquesto,: ac.. y of particular importance they bring additional<br />
depth i---.. rnational discourse and often give national leaders<br />
a greater * r-erstanding of one another's perspectives and problems.<br />
But these -en alone cannot form foreign policy. Not only is there<br />
a require::. nt for first class official advice beyond this there<br />
must be stable and institutionalised sources of non government<br />
influence on foreign policy.<br />
Only if there are these injections of expertise from the outside<br />
the injections of adrenelin into the perspectives of the<br />
politicians and the foreign service can tendencies towards<br />
over-routinisation, forcing new issues into. old images be overcome.<br />
We all Iike our stereotypes, our established ways of looking at<br />
the world.<br />
They are comfortable and reassuring.<br />
It is through constant stimulus from society that our understanding<br />
of the world can respond to change in ways enabling us to influence<br />
events before the time for exercising such influence passes.<br />
The con-rri_--ions that can be made to Australia's foreign policy<br />
by puibl= i-nvcivement are of great significance the Australian<br />
pecc e i-. creasingly well educated, the issues which face<br />
us are . o . ngqer clear cut, black and white issues if ever they<br />
were and smr-le responses are no longer appropriate to the<br />
international situation. </p>
<p>The importance of the nature and quality of debate in the public<br />
are: a to. a successful foreign policy means that those responsible<br />
for Australian foreign policy are growing in number.<br />
It is worth considering carefully what " responsible" means in this<br />
context. In a Constitutional sense, the responsibility of the government has<br />
not altered. The Government takes the decisions which direct the<br />
instruments of policy, and remains accountable for thosedecisions<br />
to the people.<br />
There is a broader sense of " responsible" however, which extends to<br />
all those who actively contribute to the foreign policy debate.<br />
In this sense, people share a responsibility for the outcome of<br />
the debate because their contribution influences that outcome.<br />
In this wider sense, all of us who take an active role in<br />
discussing the nation's foreign policy have a part of the<br />
respc: sibility for what happens in Australia how successfully<br />
we navigate the shoals and use the opportunities of our<br />
international environment.<br />
This is a responsibility that requires us at all times, to express<br />
our -iews on Australia's policy in a way that will contribute to<br />
an effec-ive role for Australia, and not in a way geared simply<br />
to cause sensation or gaining the approval of some special interest<br />
or grcep.<br />
This is a responsibility which requires the debate to be conducted<br />
in terms of moderation and reason, not as a crusade on behalf of<br />
revealed trut-.<br />
Because it involves the nation's security, the foreign policy<br />
debate is one of democracy's most critical debates.<br />
Because foreign policy often requires a long term perspective<br />
and. deals with events and circumstances that often appear remote and<br />
of litt.. e relevance, it is too easily made the focus oF emotion<br />
rather than reason, and exploited for domestic purposes unrelated<br />
to the nation's needs.<br />
In this process of public discussion, all sections of the community,<br />
the media, political parties, institutions of higher learning, and<br />
the many associations concerned with the examination of international<br />
affairs have important parts to play.<br />
-Inevitably participation involves. costs. The sheer time and<br />
effort it takes to keep up with international events. The<br />
intellectual rigor required to put the facts into an interpretive<br />
fra.-a:.-Cr. And the foreswearing of the emotionally satisfying<br />
partisan response to-events and actions in the interests of<br />
detached even if not bloodless analysis.<br />
The media have a critical role to play in the development of<br />
a dem. ocratic foreign policy. </p>
<p>They are the most potent disseminators of news and the most<br />
widely received evaluator of facts in our society.<br />
Few people have direct experience with foreign affairs their<br />
appreciation of the world, of operative forces in it the actions<br />
of politicians and the consequences of these actions are<br />
received from the mass media.<br />
Politicians and policy makers in turn rely on the press, to sample<br />
public opinion, and to test the substance of the arguments which<br />
journalists and leader writers put forward-,. against their own..<br />
Unlike undemocratic regimes, the Government cannot dictate the<br />
news or the sort of coverage that they think an issue deserves<br />
rather it is up to the judgement of the press to decide what to<br />
print. All this gives the media considerable power although not always<br />
quite as much power as the media thinks it has and a great<br />
responsibility. The role of the media in Australia is particularly important<br />
because of the obvious problems of the time lag in the receipt<br />
of overseas publications reporting and evaluating international<br />
events. How ;. anvy ecple have had the opportunity to read the best newspapers<br />
from cv-erses in time for the impact of their reports and<br />
evalua-ion-s have an immediate impact?<br />
The facts cf geography even in a period of near instantaneous<br />
communrica-ins means that there is a risk of Australia being<br />
isolated from new currents of ' thought and new assessments of<br />
situations.<br />
The result is that there is a danger that Government statements<br />
and perceptions will appear to come out of the blue to the public<br />
and often to the press because the facts the Government is<br />
placing before the people have not previously been given a " run".<br />
There is a responsibility on the media to report foreign affairs<br />
in a ay a sujects them to adequate and objective analysis<br />
over a period of time.<br />
There is a need for coverage of foreign affairs to be more<br />
systematic and extensive.<br />
The public should be alerted to developing situations in the<br />
internati4al arena as these situations emerge so as to be<br />
able to in an awareness of the factors relevant to the situation<br />
and the in which Australia's interests may be involved.<br />
At this coint should say something about the two apparentlyconflicLz--<br />
g rinciples of the democratic right to know, and the<br />
need for secrecy which effective Government sometimes demands.<br />
Usually the r" dia and the Government are cast as the protaganists<br />
of the two different principles.<br />
The ccntest be-ween the democratic right to know and the sometimes<br />
inevitable demand for secrecy, is softened although not completely<br />
resolved if it is recognised that what is at issue is not a<br />
conflict of absolutes. </p>
<p>Traditionally, the conflict has been seen as being between<br />
journalists' duty to inform the public, and policy-makers who<br />
assert that the public has no right to know about foreign policy.<br />
This is no longer an accurate representation of the situation<br />
if ever it was.<br />
There is a conviction on the part of this Government that public<br />
involvement in policy making is an essential component of effective<br />
foreign policy.<br />
Secrecy is only warranted or justified, where its absence would<br />
compromise what is basically the outcome of an inherently<br />
democratic process.<br />
There are obviously some matters which, for security or operational<br />
reasons, cannot be disclosed until long after the event.<br />
But there can be no hard and fast rule about what falls into<br />
these categories and what falls outside them.<br />
In making a decision on any particular matter, both politicians<br />
and journalists have to use their judgement about what is in the<br />
public interest they will sometimes differ.<br />
This Goverrnent has sought to play its part in stimulating a<br />
public debate on Australia's foreign policy by stating its<br />
view cf Auscralia's place in the world, and some of the problems<br />
Austr-lia i-common with other nations, faces.<br />
Both th: : r-ign Minister and I have pointed to the problems<br />
present-i c-the contemporary international environment.<br />
This environment provides grounds for concern to peoplec who are<br />
willing to look at the world as it is rather than as they would<br />
like it to be.<br />
Without a conception of a desirable future our foreign policy is<br />
rudderless, condemned to an arid pragmatism that permits us<br />
only to respond to events rather than shape them.<br />
Bv asserting that the millenium of peace and security has<br />
. arrived, we compromise, perhaps irremediably any chance of<br />
achieving such a world.<br />
Tensions have not been eliminated from the contemporary<br />
international environment.<br />
Some states have manifested a continuing readiness to pursue<br />
their -n-ersts by the use of force.<br />
The of countries opposed to the freedom and respect<br />
for the in. ci . ual is growing.<br />
Deten-e has not meant the stabilisation of tensions between the<br />
super pcwers.<br />
The internal political and social problems of many countries<br />
have led to uncertainty in their external relations<br />
Problems of energy and raw material supplies present the internatic.<br />
cor. munity w. itn a new set of problems which could add to the<br />
possibilities of conflict and confrontation if ineffectively<br />
handled. </p>
<p>The w-idespread problems of poverty, hunger and disease both<br />
affront human dignity and thrcaten confflict be tween nai-ions.<br />
In ' the course of initiating such a debate, it seems regrettably<br />
almost inevitable, that for a variety of reasons, distortions<br />
will occur. Misperceptions become repeated and -treated as if<br />
they aere fact.<br />
one -reason misperceptions may occur is because technical terms<br />
are . rftsunderstood.<br />
Spec-lits use language in one way, the same terms are<br />
unde-stood diffexrentiy by-people who are not speciailis-Us.<br />
One tierrn which gives rise to such difficulties is " threat".<br />
When. a rtiilitary officer or defence expert uses the term " direc-t<br />
threat", it refers to identifiable forces mobilised for agression.<br />
A state2ment that there is " no direct threat" to Australia does<br />
not -mean that there are no foreseeable problems or dangers in<br />
our n-er-nat~ onal environment.<br />
It inzela ns that there is no country foreseecably prepared to<br />
! aunz an assault on Australia.<br />
v et-in te recent past we have seen the claim that there,: is<br />
1t hrat to Australia now or for the next fifteen<br />
year~:-,. e monean that there are no risks or dange-rs in the<br />
~ ntr:.~ ioalenvironment hat our dle-fence capacity can<br />
be run-i:.; wn without any adverse consequences for our security,<br />
and thnat -to reign policy can largely ignore issues o. security.<br />
Another term which has been a source of serious misunderstanding<br />
i s d e t;-n t<br />
" Detente" orgnlyreferred to certain princip_) les of relations<br />
which it was hoped would lead. to a genuine overcall relaxation<br />
of political and military tensions.<br />
Tomnany people, however, " detente"; was taken to mean that such<br />
a seciare relaxation had actually taken place that the objective:, s<br />
of policy , ere real achievem-entcz.<br />
M~ isunderstandings of both these terms " threat" and " detente"<br />
have led in the Gover-nment's view to inaccurate assessments<br />
of Australia's international environment.<br />
The Cover-: 7ent believes that it is a serious distortion to see<br />
forei-n -e-Eence policy simply as a response to " throa-ts".<br />
Such'a ~ mu ~ capproach will simply hinder us from responding<br />
effectae&gt; to e complexities of our international environment.<br />
T : nts in my statement of first June. It is a<br />
Pcs_ 7: icn I have r-eiterated since, on a number of occasions.<br />
On jne -First T said: " the contempoorary international situation<br />
is a test ofE the capabilities of i: emocratic leaderships and<br />
democratic pecles. It is an environment with disturbing xt<br />
t'encenzjeis anid shif; ts in balance. This diffuseness and compdexit<br />
is t2C t" / lC </p>
<p>It is the shifting balance of influence in the international<br />
situation which was one of the grounds for ' concern I expressed<br />
at that time.<br />
I said: A nation does not have to face a threat of<br />
imminent invasion before it has grounds for concern at the<br />
international situation.<br />
From our own point of view, the primary concern is an international<br />
environment which could progressively limit the capacities of<br />
Australia, her friends and allies, to advance their interests<br />
and i: eals, which reduces . options,. which almost imperceptibly<br />
weakens the capacity to pursue our interests and advance the<br />
cause of. human dignity."<br />
The position of the Government on the Soviet buildup in the<br />
Indian Ocean and in Europe, has been tasted within this framework.<br />
Our concern has been consistently expressed at the strategic s<br />
significance of a shift in the balance of influence in the vital<br />
north west sector of the ocean.<br />
What we have siad consistently is that we seek balance and<br />
restraint. Let me quote again from the June first statement:<br />
have supported the U. S. development of logistic<br />
facilities at Diego Garcia so that the balance necessary<br />
-or stability in the area can be maintained. We also<br />
s-rcngly support the recent appeal by the United States<br />
ac. iniszzation for restraint so that the balance can now<br />
e aintained at a relatively low level."<br />
This was the view that I reiterated in discussions with<br />
Governmient leaders in Japan, China and the United States.<br />
It was therefore with some surprise that I read in a Sydney<br />
nespaper column a couple of weeks ago that my view of a direct Sov. ie<br />
threat to Australia had received a rebuff from an American admiral<br />
who stated that he did not believe there was a direct threat to<br />
Australia from the U. S. S. R.<br />
My surprise ; was based on the fact that far from rebuffing the<br />
Government, the said admiral in fact was stating an identical<br />
position to ours.<br />
This misperception of the Government's position which I hope<br />
is not widely shared most probably stemmed from the fact that<br />
in the June first statement I expressed concern at the general<br />
growth of œ c-; iet power ( at a time when the military forces of<br />
the west were static or declining.)<br />
I furh-er e:: xcr: ssed concern that some Soviet actions seemed to be<br />
inconsistent with the aim of reducing world tensions.<br />
I stated that" the Soviet Union is engaged in a major political<br />
offe.-. ve, backed by the known presence of force, by training and<br />
by przcagancda."<br />
Now that is indisputably true: the concern I expressed was almost<br />
ide.: tinal to that expressed by the Ministers and Defence Councils<br />
of It is similar to the concerns expressed by Dr Kiissinger<br />
and ! r Carter in the United States. </p>
<p>I sz~ stthat imI statem,, ent of concern attracted the attention<br />
itddin Australia because in recent years we have becOm.-,, e U2 . cCI<br />
to not express ing our views on the m,. ajor facts of world power: w. hich<br />
indisputably ccncern us.<br />
it is a measure of how far: the foreign policy debate in Australia<br />
had lapsed into unreality.<br />
The central facts of importance to our security had becoite<br />
matICters on which wle were accustomed to be silent. Basic questions<br />
of national security h-ad slipped from view.<br />
For some tiate now some of the major contributors to the debate<br />
have thrust from' the centre of their foreign policy concerns<br />
the issue lla-tona. l si~ curity, -and ref used to recognise ' the<br />
critical issues w.. hich arise out of the changing balaice of world<br />
forces. I vould like to supportL this with t-wo extracts from a recent<br />
speech. by t] he Shadow,. 11inister for DefLence. In this speech,<br />
the . iresent Government was criticised for expressing concern<br />
about, 7 th_' e Incre. ase of Soviet power in what he called " distant<br />
~ uro-pn ! I, 000 kilometres away."<br />
I shoulc. d not 7. av thought it possible that an Australian Shadow<br />
Minister wo~ imply so strongly the irrelevance of the European<br />
situa:: t oursecurity.<br />
The co:: en ade on the causes of the Soviet buildup in the<br />
Indi. also require little comment.. lie said:<br />
be credibly argued that it developed asadefensive<br />
response to-t-h e. transfer of -the.. chagos archipelago which includ<br />
Dieco, Garcia from the U. K. to the U. S. for interalia defence<br />
purroses." This breatht'+_ aking suggestion was followed by a rap over the<br />
knuclzles fo tetwo western allies, Great Britain and the<br />
UniJte, d Sta--es" Thol behaving in a that can so easily be<br />
interpretezd as " crude colonialism".<br />
In the leSOceCh, there was a failure to mention, let alone<br />
evaluate, interven-tion of Cuba and the Soviet Union in Angola.<br />
Clearly there is a significant weakness in -the foreign policy debate<br />
when one ot our two mnajor Parties so resolutely refuses to analyse<br />
for itself: -the facts of world power.<br />
I want -t Sa th at I do not wholly blame the Labor Party for the<br />
state f: oreign policy debate over the last few years.<br />
The 3~ f a the reassessment by America of its world<br />
Loo: rii_ o d of uncer. tinty w,. hich inevita-bly ma-_ I:<br />
foreloTn : cl cy az-scussion more difficult.<br />
110: u~ riod is now co:-ting to an end. Since the release<br />
of oL0-: r 0orci. n olicy document last year, and m,, ore particularly<br />
dUfizn this Vzea; r in Government, have sought to stimulate acrain<br />
nat-zonal aizs; o on basic i ssues of foreign policy in a spi ri t<br />
of e.. 2SA </p>
<p>12.<br />
One of the central issues which we must face as a nation and<br />
bring to bear on it both our idealism and realism is the problem<br />
of development in the countries of the third world.<br />
The existence of great differences in economic development between<br />
the industrialised nations and the developing countries has<br />
the capacity to subject the world to great strains and tensions.<br />
The slow progress in nations that aspire to rapid development raises<br />
inev-itably questions as to why others cannot do more to assist.<br />
To these questions are added third world nations' feelings<br />
that they have historic and immediate grievances -against the<br />
developed nations.<br />
These felt grievances are moral, psychological, economic andpolitical.<br />
They have their roots in the colonial past and the memories<br />
of foreign administration, and in the frustrations of-the<br />
gridingly slow economic haul of the post independence<br />
period. They gain sustenance from the belief that the terms of trade<br />
are ir-erently weighted against developing countries in<br />
order bene-fit-he industrialised nations. </p>
<p>m any third world countries are resentful of the manner in which the<br />
U. S. S. R. seeks to expand its influence. The West-ern industrialised<br />
nations, however, are regarded as benefitting disproportionately<br />
from the international economic system within which developing countries<br />
largely operate.<br />
The Soviet Union's tough bargaining in its purchases of raw materials<br />
from the third world is largely ignored. In part, this is because there<br />
i s much less in the way of trade between developing countries and those<br />
nations with centrally planned economies. The common sentiments of<br />
developing countries have produced a sense of solidarity between them.<br />
This at present, focus'ses on demands for a new international economic<br />
order which will achieve a redistribution of wealth and of economic<br />
activitv in favour of the developing countries. There are still wide<br />
differences between the developing countries as to the thrust of a new<br />
interontional order and specific measures envisaged under it. However,<br />
the solidarity of the developing nations has been maintained.<br />
This solidarity is in itself no mean achievement since developing nations<br />
l acking in oil were more seriously harmed by the OPEC oil rises of<br />
S1973/ 74 thn was the West. There is little likelihood that the thrust<br />
of the developing c: untries concerns vis a vis the West will dissipate.<br />
The oroble-s faced by the developing countries, the human misery inherent<br />
i: cohtinuinZ o: over-y, and the interests that industrialised nations<br />
r.-i in asi-s-i-:: ese problems to be overcome are clear. By no measure<br />
the claim_ . attihonast they have acted ' with sufficient<br />
foresight or in assisting the developing nations.<br />
Both the devc-:= i and the developing nations must cooperate in finding<br />
practical solu-. ns to the challenge of economic development.<br />
In this process, we must avoid the spirit of confrontation and recognise<br />
that the f. ates of the world's nations are linked together.<br />
We must foster a much greater understanding of the essential elements<br />
in economic progress, an appreciation of the realities that have to be<br />
faced by all concerned. Australia's approach is based on a recognition<br />
of the aspirations of the developing countries and a willingness to<br />
Scontribute to the building of a stable and equitable international<br />
economic strucure.<br />
A consistent theme of the developing countries is improved access to the<br />
markets of developed countries for their products. Australia supports<br />
the need for greater trade liberalism, particularly in processed<br />
and unprocessed primary products which would assist solid economic<br />
development in the developing countries.<br />
Australia rec:-ises the need for increasing assistance to developing<br />
countries in hat avoid, wherever possible, adding to their debt<br />
burden. Her-e -ir-ually all our aid to devel. oping countries ( and all<br />
aid in the : ase of -he least developed nations) is in grant form.<br />
We have lc-. r succored the -idea of commodity agreements to which could<br />
contribute t-reater stability in international commodity trade. As a<br />
major com..-.-cri-y rs;-Ccer and exporter, we recognise the need for<br />
i-. rovement in the conditions of world commodity trade, and have<br />
been disaczointed with past efforts of the international community in<br />
his direction.<br />
a re ac tivey participating in efforts to conclude firm agreements<br />
providing realistic prices which are in the interests of producers<br />
and consumers. </p>
<p>-14-<br />
t The Australian government supports changes in economic policies<br />
affecting thi international economic sstem, which are both practi. cal<br />
and. viable, which serve the interdependent interests of both the<br />
developed and the developing nations. We believe that presertation<br />
of the essential elements of the present economic system continue<br />
to hold the greatest hope for economic progress.<br />
Changes to the international system of the magnitude envisaged in the<br />
new international order proposals, would, however, almost certainly<br />
be counter-productive. Thus for instance: Commodity agreements which<br />
seek to ameliorate short term price fluctuations are one thing, but<br />
attempts to set artificially high prices in OPEC type commodity<br />
arrangements are another. Such arrangements might bring short term<br />
benefits. In the longer run, the short term gains are generally more<br />
than offset by the long term costs attendant on declining demand and<br />
substitution. Similarly, while Australia supports greater market access and has<br />
taken steos in this direction, the impact on domestic industries<br />
must be a critical concern of proposals in this area. Failure to<br />
Sac. knowlecze the structural effects of any changes will only result<br />
in internal industrial and economic disruption, leading to the<br />
re-establishment of protective barriers.<br />
There must -e a sensitivity and responsiveness to the legitimate interests<br />
of the dee.=-.-ing nations, and a commitment to supporting those proposals<br />
tha will istic-al assist the developing nations in the internationa<br />
a-onomic cc::---rity.<br />
Tnhe fostering of the illusion that redistribution of the world's existing<br />
wealth will rescl. e all problems serves no ones interest. Redistribution<br />
has a place in e world's economic agenda but much more important is<br />
soundly based in-ernational economic growth, and most fundamental of all,<br />
the pursuit by developing countries of domestic policies which foster<br />
enterorise and initiative.<br />
If we do not frankly say this, then we and the developing countries,<br />
run the risk of raising unrealistic expectations which would inevitably<br />
be shattered. The frustration this would engender would be gravely<br />
V destabilising both for the governments of the'developing countries, and<br />
for the international system.<br />
The problems which face Australia are not unique; they are problems which<br />
face many countries in the contemporary era. In this environment, one<br />
important way in which a medium power such as Australia can exercise some<br />
beneficial influence, is by the quality of our analysis on international<br />
questions. That quality is significantly a function of the quality of<br />
the foreign poll-y iebate. There is an overriding need to adopt an<br />
attitude of dis._ ssiate analysis to avoid both stridency and an<br />
unwarranted cn-. placency.<br />
Some peo-le eliee t-hat what is required for Australia's foreign policy<br />
is a bicar i-sa aoproach. I think it would be fruitless to aim at a<br />
sterile bic-rtisanshio in which difference in approach and emphasis are<br />
lost by i-zhing foreign policy at the lowest common denominator.<br />
In any case, under present conditions, bipartisanship is not a realistic<br />
possibili-y.<br />
. ha: is d-esirble is that the discussion of foreign policy, of the options<br />
open to Australia, and the different approaches which characterise the<br />
approaches of the two major parties, should be discussed rationally, and<br />
without attempting to distort positions. </p>
<p>~-13-<br />
Only if these dif crences are realisticllv. and objectively canvass 2d,<br />
can the Australian public * coma to adecr: ate conclusions and have an<br />
effec~. c-% ee appreciht ion of toe realitieas of internationallife.<br />
What should be souqht is a consensus on the funlamental assumption<br />
of foreign nolicy. The debate will be inost productive if there is<br />
a recocanition of t-he fact and it is a fact that Australians<br />
