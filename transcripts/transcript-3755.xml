PR?. IME MINISTER<br />
MR SPEAKER, I MOVE:<br />
T'IAT THIS BILL BIE READ A SECOND TIME.<br />
THIS BILL IS IDENTICAL WITH ' THAT INTRODUCI: I) INTO TillS<br />
HOUSE BY ME ON 11 FEBRUARY 1975 AND PASSEI: D BY AN ABISOLUTE<br />
MAJORITY ON 18 FEPR?. UARY. THIE SENATE RECEIVED TiHAT IPTL . ON<br />
19 FEBRUARY AND REFUSED IT A SECOND REA1) DING ON 25 F. VB3UARYo<br />
I SHALL NOT TAKE THE TIME OF THE HOUSE TO PUT<br />
FORWARD AGAIN THE REASONS THAT HAVE LED TIHE GOVERNNENT TO<br />
RESUBMIT TIIS LEGISLATION. THEY ARE SOUND AND REASONED. THEY<br />
WERE SPELT OUT BY ME IN MY SECOND READING SPEECH IN THiE HOUSE,<br />
AND IHONOURABLE MEMBERS HAVE THEM RECORDED IN IIANSARD<br />
PP 53-54 OF 11 FEBRUARY 1975.<br />
THE HONOURABLE MEMBERS FOR MORETON, DARLING DOWNS<br />
AND BENNELONG WHO SPOKE FOR THE OPPOSITION ON THE 13BILL EAILIER<br />
THIS YEAR CLAIMED THAT THEY OPPOSED IT BECAUSE S] IMULTANEOUS<br />
ELECTIONS WOULD DISTURB THE IRELATIONSHIP BFTI'WEEN THE TWO HOUSES,<br />
DAMAGE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE SENATE AND ALTER ITS ROLE.<br />
THllS, OF COURSE, IS NOT SO. THE INDEPENDENCE OF Tl'E<br />
SENATE WAS NOT FOUNDED ON ELECTIONS BEING HELD FOR TIHE TWO<br />
HOUSES A'T' DIFFERENT TIMES. IT IS CLEARI THIAT TIIE FR?. AMERS , OOFU R<br />
CONSTITUTION DID NOT REGARD SEPARATE ELECTIONS IN TillS SENSE AS<br />
BASIC TO TiHE SENATE' S ROLE AS AN INDEFENDENT IHOUSEF. fNDEEP. </p>
<p>BEFORE TliE JOINT ARLIAMENTARY CONN'ITTEf: E ON CONSTITl'TI. ONAll<br />

ONJ". MI IKB ISSENTING THERE HAD BERN ONlY T1REE OCCASIKS ON<br />
WHICH AN ELECTION HA BERN HELD TO ELECTMCHBR1? S OF ONE HOSI;:<br />
ONLY THOSE FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 1929 AN 195.1<br />
AND FOR THE SENATE IN 1953.<br />
SINCE 1959, IOWEVFR, THERE HAVE BEEN NO 1: SS THAN<br />
NINE NATIONAL ELECTIONS, FOUR OF TIN FOR THIS HO0USE AIONEK<br />
AND THREE OF THEN O? THE SENATE ALONE,<br />
I POINT OUT ALSO THAT THE JOINT COMMI. TT'E CONCLUDI)<br />
THAT THE ORIGINAL CONCKPT OF TiHE SENATE' S ROLE AS A STATE S<br />
HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN REALISED; NOR HAD ITS INTENDED ROLE AS A<br />
HOUSE OF REVIEW THE WEAPON OF REJECTION HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN<br />
PAITY HANDS. IT WAS THE JOINT COMMITTEE' S VIEW THAT SINULTANEOUS<br />
ELECTIONS WOULD BENEFIT IT. ESPONSTHk1E GOVERNMENT IN MANY WAYS.<br />
APART FRO N THE OBVIOUS CONVENIENCE., SIMULTANEOUS KLECTIONS<br />
WOULD PROOTE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WIL KHNEO ST PRCENT<br />
EXPRESS. ON OF THE WILL OF TIHE PEOPLE AND DISCOURAGE CAPICIOUS<br />
IEJECTION OF LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATI VES.<br />
IN SHOUT, THE RTGHTS AND INDEPENDENCE OF T E SENATE<br />
WILL IN NO WAY BE AHOGATED BY THIS BILL. BUP THE BILL WIL. L<br />
ENABLE THE ELECTORS TO RE-CONSIDER WHETHER. TiEY WISH TO CONTINU i:<br />
TO HAVE FREQUENT AND COSTLY SEPARATE ELECTIONS FOR THE TWO<br />
HOUSKS AS IS THE POS'TION NOW OR WHETHER TIEY WISII SIMULTANIOU-S<br />
ELECTIONS TO 13K HI) FOR TH HOUSE OF I?. EPiHESNTAT. I VKS AND ONK<br />
HALF OF ' I'llE SENATE,<br />
I COMMEND THE BILL TO THE HOUS. K </p>
<p>ELECTORAL BILL<br />
AT ITS JOINT SITTING ON 6 AUGUST 1974,<br />
PARLIA' 1HNT PASSED THE COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL ACT WHICH HAD)<br />
BEEN ONE OF THE BILLS ON WHICH THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION HAD BlEEN<br />
GRANTED IN APRIL, 1974V THIE ACT PROVIDES THAT IN ANY ELECTORATE,<br />
THE NUMBER OF VOTERS SHALL NOT BE MORE THAN 10% ABOVE OR nELOW<br />
THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF \ VOTERS IN ALL THE ELECTORATES OF THE<br />
STATE CONCERNEDV IN PASSING THE BILL, THE PARLIAMENT THEREFORE<br />
DECIDED THAT THE ELECTORAL COMMISSIONERS, IN ESTABLISHING THE<br />
BOUNDARIES AT A REDISTRIBUTION, SHOULD BE PERMITTED A VARIATION<br />
BETWEEN ELECTORATES WITHIN A STATE OF NOT MORE THAN ONE-TENTH<br />
INSTEAD OF ONE-FIFTH VARIATION PERM4ITTED UNDER LEGISLATION THEN<br />
EXISTING BY PASSING THE ACT THE PARLIAMENT INTENDED TO ENSURE<br />
THAT TPE NUMBER~ OF ' VOTERS IN EACH ELECTORATE SHOULD BE MUCH<br />
CLOSER TO THE IDEAL OF EOUALITY, THE PASSING OF THAT LEGIS--<br />
LATION EXPRESSED SOMETHING RATHER THAN MORE THAN THE WILL OF THE<br />
PARLIAMIENT, THE WILL OF BOTH HOUSES SITTING JOINTLY, IN A VERY<br />
REAL SENSE IT EXPRESSED THE DECISION OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
BECAUSE AS I HAVE SAID, THE BILL FORMED ONE OF THE GROUNDS FOR<br />
THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION AND WAS THEREFORE ONE OF THE ISSUES PUT<br />
BEFORE THE PEOPLE AT THE ELECTIONS LAST M~ AY. </p>
<p>2<br />
SPEAKING AT THE JOINT SITTING, SENATOR STEELE<br />
HALL SAID: " IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IN<br />
BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT SET UP THE ELECTION AS A TEST FOR<br />
THE GOVERNMENT, THEY SAID SO CLEARLY IN SO MANY WORDS AND AT<br />
VARIOUS TIMES MENTIONED SPECIFIC ISSUES, THERE IS NO DOUBT<br />
THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY FAIR CLAIM TO THE BILLS WHICH<br />
IT IS PRESENTING TO THIS JOINT COMMITTEE THERE IS A VERY<br />
REAL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ISSUES ARE ONES TO WHICH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT NOW HAS A VERY FAIR CLAIM ANY PERSON WHO STUDIES<br />
THE HISTORY OF THE GENERATION OF THIS JOINT SITTING WILL KNOW<br />
THAT ANYONE WHO STANDS AGAINST EXTENSION OF THE FRANCHISE STANDS<br />
AGAINST HIS OWN POLITICAL FUTURE,.<br />
AS A RESULT OF THAT JOINT SITTING AND IN ACCORDANCE<br />
WITH THE CLEARLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE PEOPLE, THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
ELECTORAL ACT BECAME THE LAW OF THE LAND, LAST WEEK, THE SENATE<br />
REFUSED TO ADOPT REDISTRIBUTION PROPOSALS WHICH IMPLEMENTED THE<br />
LAW, THE SENATE HAS TRIED TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW REMAINS<br />
INOPERATIVE A DEAD LETTER, IN REJECTING THE PROPOSALS THE<br />
SENATE HAS TRIED TO NULLIFY THE LAW OF THE LAND, THERE WAS NO<br />
POINT IN SENDING THE BOUNDARIES BACK TO THE COMMISSIONER TO BE<br />
REDRAWN, THE COUNTRY PARTY HAS MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT IT<br />
WILL REJECT ANY REDISTRIBUTION AT ALL. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO<br />
EMBODY THE PROPOSALS IN LEGISLATION. BY SO DOING ' E RE-ASSERT<br />
THE INEVITABLE AND NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE<br />
PROPOSALS, BETWEEN THE ELECTORAL ACT PASSED AT THE JOINT SITTING<br />
AND THE REDISTRIBUTION WITHOUT WHICH THAT ACT IS A NULLITY,<br />
FURTHER, IN THE EVENT OF CONTINUED SENATE OBSTRUCTION, WE SHALL<br />
ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA YET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
ENDORSE, AS THEY DID LAST HAY, THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF<br />
REPRESENTATION, ,/ 3 </p>
<p>IF THE SENATE AGAIN REJECTS THIS PRINCIPLE,<br />
THAT REJECTION WILL AGAIN LE AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE PEOPLE<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO PASS JUDGMENT,<br />
THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE, IN BOTH HOUSES, NO SERIOUS<br />
OBJECTION WAS MADE TO THESE PROPOSALS ON THE GROUNDS OF<br />
UNFAIRNESS, THEY ARE SCRUPULOUSLY FAIR, IN THE WORDS OF<br />
IR, MALCOLM M ACKERRAS, AN ACKNOWLEDGED ELECTORAL ANALYST:<br />
' IN OVERALL POLITICAL TERMS, THE 1975 REDISTRIBUTION IS THE<br />
FAIREST SET OF PROPOSED BOUNDARIES EVER TO BE PRESENTED TO<br />
ANY AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT IN MY LIFETIME, THE COMMISSIONERS<br />
HAVE BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO AVOID ANY SUGGESTION OF GERRYMANDERI<br />
IG, THEY HAVE SET OUT TO DRAW BOUNDARIES SO PATENTLY<br />
FAIR THAT REJECTION BY THE SENATE WOULD REFLECT DISCREDIT ON<br />
THE SENATE NOT ON THE COMMISSIONERS,<br />
I HAVE HEARD NO OBJECTION FROM ANY QUARTER TO THESE<br />
PROPOSALS ON THE GROUNDS OF UNFAIRNESS, NO REFLECTION HAS<br />
BEEN MADE ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMMISSIONERS OR THE<br />
SCRUPULOUS IMPARTIALITY WITH WHICH THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT.<br />
THEIR WORK, .4 </p>
<p>THE REDISTRIBUTION IS BOTH URGENT AND NECESSARY, AN<br />
ELECTION HELD ON THE PRESENT BOUNDARIES WOULD BE A TRAVESTY.<br />
I INVITE HONOURABLE " iEMIBERS TO CONSIDER HOW FLAGRANTLY THE<br />
[ NUMBER OF VOTERS VARIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ELECTORATES<br />
AT PRESENT, IN QUEENSLAND HALF THE ELECTORATES, NINE OF<br />
THE EIGHTEEN, DEPART BY MORE THAN 10% FROM THE QUOTA AND<br />
FOUR DEPART BY MORE THAN 20%, I N i'Ew SOUTH WiALES, TWENTY OF<br />
THE FORTY-FIVE ELECTORATES ARE MORE THAN j. 0 ABOVE OR BELOW<br />
THE AVERAGE QUOTA, FOUR OF THEM ARE MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT<br />
ABOVE THE QUOTA AND TWO OF THEM ARE MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT<br />
BELOW IT, IN VICTORIA THERE IS A VARIATION GREATER THAN TEN<br />
PERCENT IN FOURTEEN OF THE THIRTY-FOUR ELECTORATES AND A<br />
VARIATION GREATER THAN TWENTY PERCENT IN SEVEN OF THEN.<br />
IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA FOUR OF THE TWELVE ELECTORATES DEPART<br />
BY MORE THAN TEN PERCENT FROM THE QUOTA AND TWO BY MORE THAN<br />
TWENTY PERCENT,<br />
IN EACH OF THESE STATES THE QUOTA FOR AN ELECTORATE IS<br />
ABOUT 64 000 VOTERS, YET IN QUEENSLAND, THE ENROLMENT BETWEEN<br />
THE LARGEST AND SMALLEST ELECTORATES VARIES BY I'' 3,000 VOTERS.<br />
IN IlEW SOUTH WALES IT VARIES BY 35,000 VOTERS. IN VICTORIA<br />
IT VARIES BY 38,000, IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA IT VARIES BY<br />
31,000 VOTERS. THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, AND WITHIN PARTICULAR<br />
STATES, SOME SEATS HAVE MORE THAN 70% MORE PEOPLE ON THE<br />
ROLLS THAN OTHERS, THUS SOME PEOPLE'S VOTES ARE WORTH MORE<br />
THAN 70% MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE'S. IN QUEENSLAND ONE SEAT<br />
HAS MORE THAN TWICE AS HANY VOTERS AS ANOTHER, THIS IS<br />
A DENIAL OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY AND A TRAVESTY<br />
OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, </p>
<p>LET ME GIVE SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FOR OUEENSLAND.<br />
AS AT 25 APRIL, THE SEAT OF MACPHERSON HAD 94,024 ELECTORS<br />
ON THE ROLL. BY CONTRAST, MARANOA HAD 46,456 ELECTORS.<br />
KENNEDY HAD 50,890 ELECTORS, THAT IS THE KIND OF<br />
VARIATION THAT OPERATED JUST AFTER THE LAST ELECTION,<br />
LET US ASSUME HOWEVER, THAT THE PARLIAMENT RUNS ITS FULL<br />
TERM, THE CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER HAS PROVIDED A PROJECTED<br />
ENROLMENT AS AT MAY 1977 FOR THE THREE EXISTING SEATS WITH<br />
THE HIGHEST ENROLMENTS.<br />
AT APRIL 25, 1975 MACPHERSON HAD AN ENROLMENT OF<br />
94,000, BY 1977 THE CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER FORECASTS IT<br />
WILL BE 104,000, BOWMAN IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE FROM<br />
79,000 TO 87,090 AND PETRIE FROM 77,000 TO 84,000, AN<br />
ELECTION HELD IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE A MOCKERY.<br />
THE DEBATE ON! THE PROPOSALS IN BOTH HOUSES ILLUSTRATED<br />
VERY CLEARLY THE MOTIVES BEHIND THEIR REJECTION IN THE SENATE,<br />
IT SHOWED HOW COMPLETELY THE LIBERAL PARTY HAD CAVED IN TO THE<br />
PRESSURE OF ITS COALITION PARTNER, IN THIS HOUSE, NO SENIOR<br />
LIBERAL INTERVENED. THEIR CASE, SUCH AS IT WAS, WAS LEFT TO<br />
THE FLEDGLING MEMBER FOR BENNELONG, WHO SPOKE ON THE PROPOSALS<br />
FOR THREE OF THE FIVE STATES CONCERNED, NEITHER THE LEADER OF<br />
THE OPPOSITION NOR THE DEPUTY LEADER SPOKE, HOW COULD THEY?<br />
THEIR OWN SEATS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATE THE DISPARITIES WHICH<br />
THE REDISTRIBUTION SEEKS TO REMOVE, THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
REPRESENTS 53,360 VOTERS IN ' IWANNON. THE DEPUTY LEADER REPRESENTS<br />
79,665 VOTERS IN FLINDERS, lOW COULD THEY RECONCILE THEIR<br />
INTERESTS? </p>
<p>-66-<br />
THE DEPUTY LEADER'S VOTERS ARE WORTH ONLY<br />
TWO-THIRDS THOSE OF HIS LEADER, THE LEADER'S VOTERS ARE<br />
WORTH HALF AS MUCH AGAIN AS HIS DEPUTY'S, IT MIGHT BE<br />
URGED THAT THE LEADER'S COUNTRY SEAT DESERVES SUCH AN<br />
ADVANTAGE OVER THE DEPUTY LEADER'S METROPOLITAN SEAT, BOTH<br />
OF THEM, HOWEVER, COME FROM A STATE WHERE A TOTALLY LIBERAL<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS JUST PROCURED A REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL<br />
DISTRICTS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, IN WHICH ENROLMENT<br />
FOR COUNTRY DISTRICTS VARIES BETWEEN 23,561 AND 25,095 AND<br />
FOR METROPOLITAN DISTRICTS BETWEEN 26,092 AND 29,353,<br />
THUS A LIBERAL GOVERNMENT FREE FROM fNATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY<br />
PRESSURE DOES NOT TOLERATE THE DISPARITIES WHICH EVEN THE<br />
LEADER AND DEPUTY LEADER OF THE LIBERALS IN THIS PARLIAMENT<br />
MUST ENDURE, iiOREOVER THE VICTORIAN DIVISION OF THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY ON 14 NOVEMBER LAST WROTE TO THE ELECTORAL<br />
COMMISSIONERS FOR THE STATE AS FOLLOWS:<br />
" GIVEN THE CRITERIA IN THE ACT, WE HAVE<br />
TO AGREE WITH THE LABOR SUBMISSION OF A REDUCTION OF<br />
ONE SEAT FROM THE RURAL AREA AND AN INCREASE OF ONE IN<br />
THE SOUTH-EASTERN AREA,"<br />
THE LIBERAL PARTY SUBMITTED A COUNTER<br />
SUBMISSION WHICH WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ENROLMENTS FOR RURAL<br />
DIVISIONS VARYING BETWEEN 59,/ 40 AND 68.923 AND FOR<br />
METROPOLITAN DIVISIONS BETWEEN 59,379 AND 68,860, THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY ITSELF SUBMITTED THAT THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
SHOULD REPRESENT 63,464 VOTERS AND THE DEPUTY LEADER 62,81,5<br />
LAST MONTH THEY REPRESENTED RESPECTIVELY 53,360 AND 79,665,<br />
THE CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER'S PROJECTION FOR 1977 is 53,000 AND<br />
81,0O00, * M i[ l i , e c""<br />
j A--' fL L K b_<br />
, i \ 51<br />
i:\ I~ c'! 7 </p>
<p>0<br />
TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, A LABOR VOTER IN IAKEFIELD IS WORTH<br />
TWICE AS IMUCH AS A LIBERAL IN BONYTHON, THAT IS THE<br />
REAL ISSUE, FOR THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF PARTISANSHIP.<br />
TIHE VOTE OF A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN IS TO BE VALUED NOT BY PARTY<br />
BUT BY PLACE OF RESIDENCE, NOT BY FOR WHOM HE VOTES ' UT<br />
BY WHERE HE VOTES, AND OF COURSE THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES<br />
TO THE PROPOSALS FOR THE TASMANIAN, QUEENSLAHD<br />
AND VICTORIAN STATES.<br />
!' HO OBJECTS TO THESE PROPOSALS? NOT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY, ALTHOUGH MY PARTY IN FACT IS WEAKENED ELECTORALLY<br />
BY THE PROPOSED REDISTRIBUTION IN QUEENSLAND. NOT THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY WHICH MAY WELL BENEFIT, THE OBJECTION IS<br />
FROM THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY, WHICH MADE ONLY ONE OFFICIAL<br />
SUBMISSION TO THE COMMISSIONERS, ITS SUBMISSION WAS NOT<br />
ABOUT HOW. THE BOUNDARIES SHOULD BE DRAWN BUT WAS SIMPLY AN<br />
OBJECTION TO ANY REDISTRIBUTION AT ALL,<br />
UNDER THE PROPOSAL, ONE OF THE TEN NON-METROPOLITANSEATS<br />
IN DUEENSLAND DISAPPEARS, YET THIS CHANGE IS NOT A<br />
RESULT OF THE OPERATION OF THE NEW ELECTORAL ACT NOT A<br />
RESULT OF THE REDUCTION OF THE PERMITTED VARIATION OF ONE--TENTH,<br />
FOR THE FACT IS THAT EVEN WITH A 20 VARIATION THE COMMISSIONERS<br />
COULD NOT HAVE DRAWN UP ANY SET OF PROPOSALS WHICH WOULD HAVE<br />
PRESERVED TEN NON-METROPOLITAN SEATS, IT IS NOT THE ACT WHICH<br />
HAS CREATED THIS SITUATION; IT IS THE PATTERN OF QUEENSLAND'S<br />
DEVELOPMENT. </p>
<p>O<br />
So LET'S BE QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. THE COUNTRY PARTY'S<br />
OBJECTION IS NOT TO THE PROPOSALS BUT TO THE FACT OF ANY<br />
REDISTRIBUTION AT ALL. THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN<br />
PRESERVING A STATUS QUO WHICH UTTERLY VITIATES ELECTORAL<br />
JUSTICE, IN VICTORIA, THE ELECTORATE OF WIMMERA HAD<br />
19,200 ELECTORS AS AT 25 APRIL 1975, THE ELECTORATE OF<br />
DIAMOND VALLEY HAD 87,522. THE CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER'S<br />
PROJECTIONS FOR 1977 IN THOSE ELECTORATES IS 92,000 AND<br />
9,00 RESPECTIVELY., DIAMOND VALLEY IS OF COURSE ONE OF<br />
THOSE SEATS WHICH THE LIBERAL PARTY MUST WIN IF IT IS EVER<br />
AGAIN TO FORM A GOVERNMENT. LET THE LEADER OF THE<br />
OPPOSITION JUSTIFY TO THE PEOPLE OF DIAMOND VALLEY WHY<br />
THEIR VOTE IS DEBASED TO SCARCELY A'HALF T1E VALUE OF<br />
THE VOTE OFT HEAA OPPTEEERR SSOOOF: , N) LLIIVVIINNGG EELLSSEEWWH-EERREE IINN VVIICCTTOORRIIAA. </p>
<p>WHY SHOULD THE LIBERAL PARTY COP THIS SORT OF<br />
SITUATION? THEY KNOW THAT THE COUNTRY PARTY WILL ACCEPT<br />
NO REDISTRIBUTION UNLESS IT DICTATES THE TERMS, LAST<br />
WEEK THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION HAS HAD A SHARP LESSON<br />
ON THE SORT OF LOYALTY HE CAN EXPECT FROM HIS COALITION<br />
PARTNERS IF THEY FAIL TO GET THEIR WAY, IF THEY FEEL THEIR<br />
NARROW AND SELFISH INTERESTS THREATENED IN ANY WAY,<br />
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION SHOULD TAKE SIR CHARLES COUIRT'S<br />
PLIGHT TO HEART, IN GOING ALONG WITH THE COUNTRY PARTY,<br />
IT IS DAMAGING ITSELF IN TWO WAYS, FIRST IT COMMITS<br />
ITSELF TO DOMINATION BY THE COUNTRY PARTY; MORE. IMPORTANT,<br />
IN THE EYES C THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, IT COMMITS ITSELF TO<br />
THE PERPETUATION OF A FLAGRANT BREACH OF ELECTORAL JUSTICE.<br />
IN EFFECT IT COi" ITS ITSELF TO A GERRYMANDER BY OMISSION,<br />
A GERRYMANDER OF WHICH THE LI: ERAL PARTY ITSELF IS THE<br />
VICTIM EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS THE LABOR PARTY, AND ABOVE<br />
ALL, IT DENIES TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE LIBERAL VOTERS<br />
EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS LABOR VOTERS THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC<br />
RIGHT OF EQUAL REPRESENTATION, S, ,/ 11 </p>
<p>-11.-<br />
I URGE THE MEMBERS OF THE LIBERAL PARTY TO<br />
UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLE PUT FORWARD BY THE JOINT COMMIITTEE ON<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW ESTABLISHED BY SIR ROBERT i'ENZIES<br />
ALL PARTIES WERE REPRESENTED AND UNANIMOUSLY THE<br />
COGMIITTEE REPORTED, "' THE COM; MITTEE FEELS CONSTRAINED TO SAY,<br />
HOWEVER, THAT THE ONE-FIFTH MARGIN ON EITHER<br />
SIDE OF THE QUOTA FOR A STATE WiHICH THE ACT<br />
ALLOWS MAY DISTURB QUITE SERIOUSLY A<br />
PRINCIPLE WHICH THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES TO BE BEYOND<br />
QUESTION IN THE ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF THE<br />
NATIONAL PARLIAMENT OF A FEDERATION, NAMELY,<br />
THAT THE VOTES OF THE ELECTORS SHOULD, AS FAR AS<br />
POSSIBLE, BE ACCORDED EQUAL VALUE, THE FULL<br />
APPLICATION OF THE MARGIN EACH WAY TO TWO<br />
DIVISIONS IN A STATE COULD RESULT IN THE<br />
NUMBER OF ELECTORS IN ONE DIVISION TOTALLING<br />
PERCENT MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF ELECTORS<br />
IN THE OTHER DIVISION, SUCH A POSSIBLE DISPARITY<br />
IN THE VALUE OF VOTES IS INCONSISTENT<br />
WITH THE FULL REALISATION OF DEMOCRACY', </p>
<p>-12-<br />
THnE COMMONHWEALTH ELECT ORAL ACT PASSED BY THE<br />
JOINT SITTING UPHELD THAT PRINCIPLE TFHE FULL REALISATION<br />
. TQfDEMOCRACY, THE PROPOSALS REJECTED L. AST WEEK UPHELD THAT<br />
PRINCIPLE, THESE BILLS UPHOLD ! HE PRINCIPLE, LET US<br />
ENSURE THAT THE~ NEXT ELECTION IS HELD ACCORDING TO T:<br />
LAW OF THE LAND, LET US ENSURE THAT THE NEXT ELECTION<br />
REPRESENTS A FULL REALISATION OF DEMOCRACY, By PRESENTrING<br />
THESE BILLS; WE ARE GIVING THE LIBERAL PARTY A SECOND CHAM'CE<br />
A CHANCE TO UPHOLD THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL REPRESENTATION,<br />
A CHANCE TO REDEEMl THEMSELVES IN THE EYES OF THEIR OWN<br />
SUPPORTERS' i </p>
