CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COMMISSIONING OF BHP'S UPGRADED ROD MILL<br />
NEWCASTLE 17 MARCH 1989<br />
Rob Chenery, General Manager,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
BHP and Newcastle go back a long way together.<br />
BHP's first steelworks were opened here in 1915.<br />
So for more than seven decades, the names of BHP and<br />
Newcastle have been synonymous with hard work, sweat,<br />
planning, investment all the qualities necessary to build<br />
a big industry; all the qualities necessary to build<br />
Australian prosperity and Australian jobs.<br />
That's why, when you think of Australian industry, you think<br />
of BHP Steel. And when you think of BHP Steel, you-think of<br />
Newcastle. Today we are celebrating a new era in the partnership of BHP<br />
and Newcastle.<br />
I have just been shown the evidence of BHP's recent<br />
investment of more than $ 400 million in the Newcastle<br />
Steelworks not least, the upgraded rod mill and the new<br />
bloom caster, the world's largest.<br />
This investment has put Newcastle at the forefront of high<br />
technology casting.<br />
And I know from my talks with the managers and workers I<br />
have met today that this new capital investment is<br />
accompanied by a new attitude of cooperation and<br />
consultation, a new commitment to quality and to training<br />
in short, a new determination to ensure the future of steel<br />
making in Australia.<br />
That will make sure Newcastle remains what it has always<br />
been the heart of the Australian steel industry.<br />
It seems incredible to recall that only a few years ago, it<br />
seemed possible that this heart might stop beating. </p>
<p>As we look at this new investment and the new attitudes that<br />
accompany it, it's important to remember that in the early<br />
1980s the future of Newcastle, and of the Australian steel<br />
industry, was in doubt.<br />
In the early 1980s, throughout the Australian economy, jobs<br />
were being lost at a massive rate, investment was falling,<br />
the challenges of international competition were being<br />
shirked. In effect, all the deep-seated problems of Australia's long<br />
standing preference for the relative ease of commodity<br />
exports, and. our long-standing unwillingness to break our<br />
manufacturing industries out of the cocoon of protectionism<br />
all these deep-seated problems had emerged to give us the<br />
worst recession we had endured in fifty years.<br />
In many ways, all these problems were encapsulated in the<br />
crisis of the steel industry.<br />
Protected, increasingly uncompetitive and inefficient, the<br />
steel industry was facing closure a decision that would<br />
surely have devastated Newcastle.<br />
After we came to office in March 1983, my Government was<br />
determined that this must not happen.<br />
That is why as one of our earliest priorities, we initiated<br />
the historic Steel Industry Plan a strategy, with the<br />
active cooperation of management and unions, to create a<br />
viable steel industry that could feed the domestic and the<br />
international marketplace competitively, efficiently and<br />
productively. Each partner in the Steel Plan had a role to play, and<br />
although there were some setbacks along the way, each<br />
partner contributed to the resurgence of the Australian<br />
steel industry.<br />
The Government provided a stable environment, including<br />
through the temporary extension of support. I pay tribute<br />
to my colleague John Button, the Minister for Industry,<br />
Technology and Commerce, for his pioneering role, and to the<br />
diligence of our local Members of Parliament, represented<br />
today by Allan Morris, the Member for Newcastle.<br />
In exchange, BHP made a commitment to massive new investment<br />
and to job security. Given a target of $ 800 million<br />
investment over the first four years of the plan, BHP<br />
actually committed itself to investing more than $ 1800<br />
million over the five years the Plan lasted.<br />
And for their part, trade unions undertook to exercise wage<br />
restraint, and agreed to productivity targets and to adhere<br />
to dispute settlement procedures.<br />
The doomsayers said it wouldn't work. </p>
<p>They thought the Australian steel industry would follow the<br />
path of the dinosaur to extinction.<br />
But we have proved the critics wrong.<br />
We have, together, rescued the steel industry and we have,<br />
together, ensured that it will have the capacity and the<br />
self-reliance to provide jobs and exports for many years to<br />
come.<br />
As the Steel Industry Authority noted, the Plan's specific<br />
short-term targets for production, investment, employment<br />
and productivity have all been met.<br />
And the proof of that achievement lies here in this new<br />
plant representing as it does new investment, world class<br />
technology, secure jobs, and the basis of a new export trade<br />
in value-added special steels.<br />
This plant now has the capacity for annual production of<br />
almost 2 million tonnes.<br />
It provides jobs for more than 5,000 people and has immense<br />
significance for Newcastle and the whole region.<br />
The scale of BHP's investment program, and the growing<br />
importance of exports in its marketing strategy, are<br />
symptomatic of the changing outlook and expectations of<br />
Australian industry.<br />
Increasingly, there is acceptance of the inevitability of<br />
greater integration with the world economy and a recognition<br />
that our future prosperity depends upon our ability to<br />
compete on world markets.<br />
Australian industry is today less inclined to view the<br />
prospect of greater trade exposure as a threat to be<br />
resisted and more as an opportunity for growth and<br />
diversification. If we are to succeed there is a need for industry to respond<br />
flexibly to global market developments and to demonstrate a<br />
willingness to adapt to the rapid pace of technological<br />
change.<br />
That ultimately is what lay behind the Government's<br />
involvement in the Steel Plan and the other sectoral plans<br />
for industries such as Heavy Engineering: support being<br />
extended for a finite period through a range of government<br />
programs and being conditional upon a real commitment by<br />
management and workers to restructuring.<br />
The across-the-board tariff cuts we announced last m'ay were<br />
also designed to give impetus to the process of<br />
restructuring. These cuts formed part of the Government's<br />
continuing program of microeconomic reform which is aimed at<br />
removing unnecessary regulation, improving the performance<br />
and accountability of government business enterprises and<br />
improving the efficiency and responsiveness of service<br />
sector industries such as transport and communications. </p>
<p>In the international marketplace, it is only through seeking<br />
increased efficiency through microeconomic reform that<br />
Australia can make major improvements in our<br />
competitiveness.<br />
And the reverse is true.<br />
Failure by Australia to match the productivity improvements<br />
and technological innovation of our competitors could again<br />
jeopardise the future of our economy including our great<br />
steel industry.<br />
Accordingly, I place great importance on, and I wish you all<br />
well in, the negotiations taking place between unions and<br />
management on award restructuring and other work practices.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
If Australia is to have any credibility whatsoever as a<br />
diversified, sophisticated, competitive economy if we want<br />
to be regarded by our trading partners as an advanced<br />
economy then we must have an efficient and productive<br />
steel industry.<br />
The fact that we now have that credibility the fact that<br />
increasingly we are being regarded as a regional economy of<br />
clout and sophistication is due in no small measure to you<br />
people: the management and workers of BHP's Newcastle<br />
Steelworks. I salute you for that achievement, and I wish you well as<br />
you continue to provide this city, and, indeed, Australia,<br />
with its backbone of steel. </p>
