TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, RADIO 2UE,<br />
14 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E E PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES: very significant visit to the Soviet Union.<br />
He spent three hours with Mikhail Gorbachev and at the<br />
-time expressed optimism about the changes which were then<br />
S -gaining momentum behind the Iron Curtain. Of course, in<br />
many areas the optimism was greeted with scepticism. A<br />
scepticism which now has been proved to be grossly<br />
misplaced. During that visit Mr Hawke invited the Soviet<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Ryzhkov, to Australia and here he is<br />
in Australia now. A very insignificant ( sic) visit. The<br />
importance of it can't be understated. He's number two<br />
in the Soviet hierarchy, he's most senior Soviet leader<br />
ever to visit Australia, he's here just days after the<br />
Communist Party in the Soviet Union took the first steps<br />
towards a democratic multi party state. He's regarded as<br />
the key manager of the Soviet economy and he personally<br />
drew up the blueprint for the restructuring of the Soviet<br />
economy. And make no mistake, as I've said, the Soviet<br />
Union faces enormous economic problems which have placed<br />
tremendous strain on the Soviet leadership. The Prime<br />
Minister, our Prime Minister, will be discussing with Mr<br />
Ryzhkov the Australian economy and the Soviet economy and<br />
other things later on in the day, but the* Prime Minister<br />
is on the line. Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PM: Morning Alan.<br />
JONES: Thank you for your time. I know you're very<br />
busy. PM: Pleasure, Alan.<br />
JONES: This is a very significant visit isn't it? I<br />
mean, in many ways, it's surprising that he got here?<br />
PM: Well, we had our fingers crossed, Alan, because we<br />
would not have been surprised and, of course, would have<br />
completely understood if he'd cancelled at the last<br />
minute because, as you've indicated, these are times of<br />
absolutely momentous change in the Soviet Union and it is<br />
a credit to our country that at this time the Soviet<br />
Prime Minister is coming right across the world. He's<br />
only really coming to Australia he stopped in Bangkok </p>
<p>just for a few hours on the way, not overnight and he's<br />
d6oi'ng the same thing in Singapore on the way back. So<br />
for him to come to Australia I think is an indication of<br />
the importance of our country and what a relatively small<br />
country managing its policies can do to play some<br />
part in what's happening within the world.<br />
JONES: Yes. It's interesting isn't it, having arrived<br />
here yesterday and given the problems that exist in the<br />
Soviet economy, that he first wanted to head off to a<br />
food packaging outlet in Australia. Did he express a lot<br />
of interest in that?<br />
PM: It's not surprising at all, Alan, when you think of<br />
it. The major problem facing the Soviet Union today and<br />
it's indeed one of the things that I talked about with Mr<br />
Gorbachev and then wrote to him about subsequently, was<br />
the whole question of the food chain, by which I mean the<br />
tragedy, in the first place, is that the Soviets don't<br />
produce enough food to feed their people and secondly, in<br />
respect of what they do produce, they have enormous<br />
problems in transportation. Some estimates suggest that<br />
up to a quarter of their actual production may be wasted<br />
in the distribution system<br />
JONES: It's just such a phenomenal land mass isn't it?<br />
PM: It is a phenomenal land mass and, of course, all<br />
these years of an irrelevant economic system has produced<br />
unbelievably archaic and irrelevant systems and so, quite<br />
fundamentally, Alan, I think one of the things that we<br />
can do and what I'll be talking about with Mr Ryzhkov is<br />
to apply the great experience that we have in the food<br />
chain. I mean, really there are very few countries that<br />
have that experience from, as we do, massive production<br />
and then experience in a great range of food processing<br />
and of distribution. So I believe that this is an area<br />
both, one, of fundamental importance to the Soviet Union<br />
and two, one within our area of experience. All the<br />
words in the world are important about welcoming change<br />
in the Soviet Union, the important thing to do is to<br />
in areas of irrelevance.<br />
JONES: And see what it will produce. What commercial<br />
opportunities are there for us as a result of this visit,<br />
for example, that wouldn't have otherwise been? I mean,<br />
what are you going to be negotiating with him today apart<br />
from fishing? I mean, we all know about the fishing<br />
negotiations. What else?<br />
PM: Well, related to the fishing is the commodities<br />
agreement because the Soviet Union for some years had<br />
expressed interest to us in having a fisheries agreement<br />
and we said, well, yes we could look at that. But we<br />
wanted to make sure that out of those negotiations we got<br />
something of importance to us as well and so we've<br />
negotiated, sort of in the complimentary fashion with the<br />
fisheries agreement, a commodities agreement which will </p>
<p>3<br />
be signed today and that includes a schedule listing<br />
quantity indicators for several important commodities for<br />
Australia that we sell to the Soviet Union that's<br />
wheat, we'll have a commodity target there, bauxite and<br />
sugar and manganese. So that out of these negotiations,<br />
there'll be benefit for the Soviet Union, but very<br />
significant benefits also for Australian producers.<br />
JONES: You're looking at someone who's a bit of a<br />
political chameleon in a way, though, isn't he? A fellow<br />
who was, going right back to Andropov, was at the centre<br />
of this Communist system and yet now we're told to<br />
believe that this is a fellow who's embraced the notion<br />
of change. Do you get that impression from the limited<br />
discussions you've had with him to date?<br />
PM: Yes, I had the opportunity when I was there he was<br />
my host in the Soviet Union at the end of 1987 when, as<br />
I think you've been kind enough to say, we were somewhat<br />
ahead of the game and he indicated to me then that before<br />
he and Mikhail Gorbachev had come to their positions of<br />
power, they had known one another in their respective<br />
ministries. Gorbachev was in agriculture and Mr Ryzhkov<br />
was in the overall economic planning area and he said<br />
at that stage, before they'd come to power, they'd<br />
realised that the Soviet economic system was in chaos,<br />
was inadequate, to meet the needs of the Soviet people<br />
and that they had exchanged ideas at that early stage.<br />
So I don't think it's a matter of some late dawning of<br />
understanding after he became Prime Minister. It's quite<br />
clear on the evidence that he and Gorbachev, going right<br />
back into the earlier part of the eighties, understood<br />
that the Marxist Leninist system<br />
JONES: Yes<br />
PM: organisation had failed.<br />
JONES: Yes, sure. And is he happy to talk? Have you<br />
raised this question of multi party systems with him or<br />
will you be doing that today?<br />
PM: We'll be doing that today. We, of course, had<br />
started at the edges of those discussions in ' 87 because,<br />
you know, in the discussions I'd had then I'd indicated.<br />
that when you're talking about economic reform, that real<br />
economic reform which involves the capacity for private<br />
decision making and so on which must be a necessary part<br />
of moving towards a market economy, necessarily entails<br />
move towards political freedom and<br />
JONES: Yes.<br />
PM: And that's precisely what's happened in the period<br />
since the end of ' 87 when I was talking about these<br />
things with both Mr Gorbachev and Mr Ryzhkov and it<br />
certainly is going to be fascinating, Alan, to get at<br />
first hand now a description from a man at the centre </p>
<p>JONES: Yes.<br />
PM: precisely how things have worked out.<br />
JONES: Extraordinary. Look, one final thing before you<br />
go and this is perhaps the most serious question of the<br />
morning. I do have a rugby union commitment out of<br />
Sydney on 24 March. I just want to know No,<br />
seriously, I just want to know whether I register the<br />
postal ballot or whether I'm safe to go and not worry<br />
about anything. 24th March, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you, my dear friend. Wherever you are, I know<br />
you'll and whatever the day is I know you'll know how<br />
to vote<br />
JONES: You're not normally so evasive. I'm asking you<br />
specifically. March 24. The dogs are barking.<br />
PM: No comment, my friend.<br />
JONES: The dogs are barking.<br />
PM: Are they?<br />
JONES: Yes.<br />
PM: The dogs are barking at Andrew's heels<br />
JONES: Yes, I thought you might have been announcing the<br />
result today. If it's to be on March 24, when's it got<br />
to be announced by?<br />
PM: If that were to be the date, it would have to be<br />
announced very soon.<br />
JONES: OK, look forward to hearing from you.<br />
PM: Thanks very much, Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister<br />
PM: Bye, bye.<br />
JONES: OK, bye bye.<br />
ends </p>
