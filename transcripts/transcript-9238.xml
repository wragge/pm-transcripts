PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO LABOR PARTY DINNER, GREEK CLUB, WEST END<br />
BRISBANE, 16 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much indeed for that tremendously warm welcome. And,<br />
thank you Wayne, Roisin ( Goss) for coming along tonight, and the Lord<br />
Mayor, Jim 8orley, and Mairy Phillips and our official guests, and all of you,<br />
thank you for a tremendous welcome and tremendous enthusiasm. And, I<br />
can tell you, quite sincerely, that it was in this room, this crowd, two years<br />
ago, more than at any other time in the period that I had been Prime Minister,<br />
that I got more cheer and more zest and more support than in any other<br />
place. I was doing it hard at the time, and I needed a kick along, and I had had a<br />
good couple of days in North Queensland and I came down here to one of the<br />
best dinners I have ever been to, and certainly then, the best of my time as<br />
Prime Minister. And, I would say this, there is no State branch of the Labor<br />
Party that can put a show together like the Queensland Labor Party.<br />
And I say that as a New South Welshman, I will be reminded of this when I go<br />
home, but as Mike ( Kaiser) said earlier, it is a test of the Labor Party's<br />
strength and vitality, that with a weeks notice there is just on 1000 people.<br />
And, if it were not for the capacity there would be more then a thousand. I<br />
thank Mike and the Party and Wayne for suggesting it, and Mike for arranging<br />
it, and for all of you who have come, thank you very much indeed.<br />
I am particularly indebted to Wayne for his very kind words of introduction,<br />
and it is true to say that he and I had a very good day, I think, where we went<br />
to a school here in Brisbane and we were involved with the teaching of<br />
Chinese in a class room, and Wayne and I sat down at our desks in the<br />
classroom while the class around us spoke Chinese. And, I thought what a<br />
marvellous thing it is that a Labor Government in Queensland can lead the<br />
country on this concentration on Asian languages, with now more then </p>
<p>2<br />
100,000 kids from Queensland learning an Asian language, and be the<br />
forerunner of this nationally. As you probably know, Wayne proposed this at<br />
the Council of Australian Governments, that the Commonwealth should join<br />
the States in a national Asian languages program, which will teach Chinese,<br />
Korean, Japanese and Indonesian in the first instance. And, for this to<br />
succeed as a policy would tremendously change the nature of Australian<br />
education and our capacity to relate to our part of the world. At any rate, we<br />
have done it. And, the Commonwealth Government has committed funds to it<br />
and as time goes on we are going to commit more and it will be a great Labor<br />
initiative, but a Labor initiative that started here in Queensland with Wayne<br />
Goss, and congratulations Wayne on that.<br />
But, as Wayne has said, we have done many things together, and I said to<br />
him today, you would have to go back half a century to find two people<br />
holding our office to be members of the Labor Party, Labor Prime Minister<br />
and Labor Premier of Queensland together in a, Queensland school and<br />
doing things for the nation and for Queensland. Wayne was kind enough to<br />
mention the collaborative program that we have decided on between us, and<br />
we announced in the Budget to claim back that part of the Daintree, that<br />
wonderful rainforest area of Australia, of Queensland, so that it remains as<br />
part of the national estate forever and always, for our children. And, he<br />
mentioned the National Training Authority, and let me just say this, that we<br />
have made some very big decisions in education to support the University<br />
system federally was probably one of the important ones. To pick up<br />
retention rates in secondary schools was another. But, no doubt, the third leg<br />
of those important decisions will be the development of our vocational<br />
education system, of Technical and Further Education into a national system.<br />
And I was able to announce for the Commonwealth's part our commitment to<br />
be in that in the One Nation program in 1992, but it would not have been<br />
possible without the support of Wayne Goss and the Government of<br />
Queensland. And it is absolutely right and fitting that the headquarters of the<br />
National Training Authority which will see the renaissance of vocational<br />
education in Australia changing the Cinderella status of TAFE into a full<br />
partner of Australian education, it is right that that headquarters should be<br />
here in Brisbane.<br />
But, after all, that is what Labor Governments are for, isn't it? I mean, here it<br />
is, a lot of our kids who don't make it beyond secondary school to university<br />
for one reason or another, often who drop out, we want them now to be part<br />
of a better education system, with a much closer focus to the work place and<br />
that's what TAFZE will be. And, so that is a great initiative, I think, between the<br />
Commonwealth and Queensland Government, indeed the Australian States in<br />
general. But, Wayne had a tremendously important role, and had a key role<br />
in that, and Australian children will be forever in his debt.<br />
Let me just say something about Mabo. Now, Mabo, we had a long rocky<br />
road with Mabo. But, as we got down towards the hard part, and that's<br />
rounding up the constituencies to support it, keeping some of the States in<br />
there, Wayne Goss and the Government of Queensland were the key to </p>
<p>keeping the State response to Mabo together. And, I can assure you that we<br />
wouldn't have a Mabo Bill today, or one that we have today, without the<br />
support of the Government of Queensland, of Wayne Goss in particular, and<br />
his pivotal role in keeping the States into the collective support we had for the<br />
Mabo legislation.<br />
Now, that is something only a Labor Government would do, and we did have<br />
the support of some conservative States, and they were there because they<br />
believed in something better. But, the great leap forward in property and<br />
cultural law which Mabo was wouldn't have happened without the Labor<br />
Party. It wouldn't have happened without the 1993 election, it wouldn't have<br />
happened without a Labor Government here in Queensland. So, these are<br />
some of the great collaborative things we have been able to do together, and<br />
there is much more to do. Queensland is either now leading Australia in<br />
growth, sometimes it is in front, at other times Western Australia is, most of<br />
the time Queensland is. And, it is because of that leadership that I think<br />
Australia is now back to strong rates of economic growth with a State like<br />
Queensland tugging the national economy along.<br />
So, I am delighted to be here. Glad to have had Wayne's company today in<br />
this important thing we were articulating in Asian education, but most<br />
particularly, above all that;' in a collaborative partnership and working<br />
arrangement between two Labor Governments of substance, of quality and of<br />
sincerity. So, thank you, Wayne, and thank you for having me in<br />
Queensland.<br />
Well, I said it was two years ago since I last spoke to you. And I think it was<br />
here in this room that Labor's journey to victory in 1993 really started to role.<br />
Because it was here that I said, that the difference between the Labor Party<br />
and its opponents was a matter of heart. It was here that I first said, if some<br />
group drops back we will lean out our caring arm and pull them up. And, I<br />
suppose it is appropriate, it is fitting and it is probably right, that I should<br />
come back here two years later, one election later, to talk about the White<br />
Papef, Working Nation, the device we have constructed to pull the<br />
u nemployed up with the rest of us.<br />
Only a Labor Government would conceive such a plan, and only a Labor<br />
Government could execute one. And, I first articulated that view about<br />
unemployment then, it very much separated us from our conservative<br />
opponents and set the tone for the balance of the Parliament. So, this night<br />
two years ago was a turning point in Labor's re-election in 1993. And,<br />
wherein John Hewson replied, " when the Prime Ministers talks", he said,<br />
" about pulling people up, doesn't he realise he will drag the rest of us down."<br />
And, that set the tone. But, the fact is, we have done what we said we would.<br />
We kept the promise and we kept the faith. Faith in ourselves, faith in<br />
Australians and faith in Australia, faith in the enduring values of our traditions<br />
as a country, of fairness of egalitarianism, of a fair go, and a capacity for<br />
tolerance, and a great capacity for change. And, perhaps it is the last, which<br />
is as important as any of the other, and that is the capacity to change. For </p>
<p>change we have. Change as a nation we have. Australian's, I think, are<br />
entitled to be proud of the change of the last ten years. For we have made<br />
big economic and social changes in Australia to ensure our economic future<br />
and to change from an inward looking country to an outward looking confident<br />
society going out to trade with the rest of the world.<br />
It has been our lot, as Labor people, as a Labor Government with now eleven<br />
years in office to fashion Australia in an image of the Labor Party. Modern,<br />
progressive, caring, to become a country which is economically strong and<br />
robust, and efficient and dynamic, and which at the same time is socially<br />
cohesive. In many respects the White Paper which I had the privilege of<br />
announcing a week ago said it all, it was a declaration that division and<br />
exclusivity was not for Australia. That we were not going to bust our<br />
traditions in favour of a dog eat dog society, of a prosperous majority, with an<br />
underclass of people to maintain it, of a low wage, low productivity culture,<br />
with an army of working poor never freed of the tyranny of poverty and debt.<br />
And, I made this point a week ago in the House of Representatives, for those<br />
people on the conservative side of politics who believe the only solution is to<br />
push labour rates down for those who are low paid, or those at the bottom<br />
end of the work force, or indeed for even those in the middle of the workforce,<br />
And I made the point, there is not any distinction in social terms between<br />
someone who is nominally employed on a most meagre wage, who lives<br />
below the poverty line, who permanently lives in debt, than someone who is<br />
nominally unemployed receiving unemployment benefit. Because that is not<br />
the sort of society we want.<br />
We don't want an army of working poor in Australia. We want Australia to be<br />
a high wage, high productivity society. Built on education, built on skills, built<br />
on research and development, built ' on product innovation, built on access to<br />
international markets, with pride in ourselves and what we produce. That is<br />
the sort of society we want. We don't want to go for the low paid jobs, the<br />
jobs which Australian's have now changed themselves and their country over<br />
a decade to escape to a higher standard of living and better levels of<br />
employment. So, the White Paper is a land mark in our development, not just<br />
for what it does, but for the beacon it lights which says, " this is the way that<br />
Australia is going". It is very much a declaration of where we are. And, we<br />
came to this fork in the road in 1993 when the Coalition argued the case for<br />
the economic rationalists, hard lined, dog-eat-dog case, and we argued the<br />
case for social inclusion and social cohesiveness and economic progress<br />
based on the common effort of the whole of the Australian nation. And, we<br />
believe and we state, we declare, that when we have come to that fork with a<br />
decision that people made in 1993, that this is the way that Australia is going<br />
to go. That we have marked ourselves out as a country that will not take the<br />
underclass route, that will not say to half a million people, " sorry you missed<br />
out, too bad, bad luck". We don't believe that we can maintain the traditions<br />
of egalitarianism and fairness if we say to those people, sorry you are the<br />
buffer at the end of the station. You are the people that take the brunt of the<br />
load of economic change, while the rest of us toddle off into employment and<br />
to prosperity. </p>
<p>Now, that has got to be a conscious decision. The country has got to get up<br />
and say, no, we are not going down the Thatcher path. We are not going to<br />
have the working poor, as there was in Reagan's America. We are not<br />
having it. And the White Paper said, " No! Not for Labor and not for<br />
Australia". So, our creed has to be economic change always changing economic<br />
strength, social unity, fairness and a premium on human happiness, human<br />
respect and human regard. And the day we move off those things is the day<br />
that we forsake the great traditions of this country and the great traditions of<br />
the Labor Party. So, the White Paper is no surprise it is simply an articulation<br />
of those things, at a time when we have seen economic stress turn 350,000<br />
people who have been unemployed for one year or more into that part of the<br />
labour market where there is no demand for them. And, that is why we have<br />
made the change. But, one of the important things is we have done all this,<br />
this huge package which is not just novel in Australian terms, but novel in<br />
world terms, we have done all this within a disciplined fiscal framework. A<br />
Budget which sits with the best in the world.<br />
So, let there be no doubt that Labor in this Epoch keeps a first class set of<br />
books. The first Budget surplus is now history, and now a Budget to<br />
consolidate the recovery. And, that is the thing that always gets under the<br />
skin of the Torys. That Labor can run the show. And, what did the Budget<br />
reveal? As I said, a Budget to consolidate the recovery, and some recovery,<br />
per cent GDP growth, the fastest of any substantial western world<br />
economy, two and a quarter per cent inflation, 3 per cent employment growth<br />
or just under a quarter of a million extra jobs, and a deficit of under 1 per cent<br />
of GDP by 1996-97 as low as any other country in the world outside of West<br />
Germany.<br />
And the Liberals and the National Party, they could have spat chips. As<br />
Ralph Willis was reading the forecast out, " growth and low inflation", the<br />
heads slumped down, and they thought it would all be theirs. The same John<br />
Hewson who was predicting a double dip recession, and a depression, and a<br />
currency crisis in the course of the election campaign, wanted to be now out<br />
there claiming Labor's work as his own. And, could you imagine it? If it was<br />
a Liberal Treasurer standing up there claiming 4.5 per cent GDP growth, two<br />
and a quarter per cent inflation, 3 per cent employment growth and the deficit<br />
coming down to under 1 per cent GDP. They would have been, honestly,<br />
they would have been casting little gilt statues to them in some of these<br />
business organisations. You can imagine the claims, you know, the role that<br />
Dr Hewson would have played in taking the accolades for this. But, what was<br />
he left to debate? The difference between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent. That<br />
was the big debate on Budget night, 4 per cent or 4.5 per cent. With the<br />
western world growth average at 1 per cent, at one, and up to 4.5 per cent,<br />
and they are saying, " oh no, no, 4.5 per cent is too much, it should be 4 per<br />
cent". This is the same economy that was going to be in a recession. And,<br />
the fact is, are they bitter, are they bitter. All semblance of equanimity is </p>
<p>gone, for a while you see, after we had won a few elections, well, you know,<br />
the born to rule gang, they were out of office and out of sorts. But a couple of<br />
parliaments regrouping that see five election losses on the trot, five election<br />
wins for Labor on the trot and all the fun has gone out of it.<br />
All semblance of equanimity is gone whatsoever. And there it was last year,<br />
where we beat them fair and square in a national election where they had<br />
their best funded campaign ever, where they articulated with massive media<br />
coverage their program... we won the election, we beat them<br />
overwhelmingly, we brought in our Budget as the elected government and<br />
they said, " All Labor governments are illegitimate, this Budget is our<br />
business," and they went on then to lead us a merry dance in the Senate.<br />
Not within a year of the government taking office. Now, this year our White<br />
Paper and Budget are met with a scowling reassertion of the principles of<br />
Fightback!. After, it got too much for them, the general support of the<br />
business community, of the media, of the public, in the end rather than<br />
saying, " Well, OK, it's not a bad budget and they're good outcomes and let's<br />
fashion a policy around no, no, they went back to saying, " Look, hang<br />
on, we are reasserting the principles of Fightback!." The sort of, sullen<br />
contempt came out and out came the old policy.<br />
So, two weeks ago at the retreat it was all social inclusion. Fightback! was<br />
dead and buried. Well, inclusion lasted just about two weeks. Now, this<br />
week, it's back to what they do best exclusion. Exclusive. See, they<br />
always regard themselves as exclusive and their supporters as exclusive, so<br />
the whole notion of inclusion is alien to them. It's only the Labor party that<br />
believes in inclusion. And, so, they were deciding I said John Hewson<br />
couldn't have been more obvious if he put on a toupee and a moustache<br />
and he was out there talking about inclusion, well it lasted two weeks when<br />
Peter Reith blew the whistle on them on the weekend and he said<br />
," Fightback! was as good a package after the election just as it was a good<br />
package before the election." Oh, it was a terrific package, Peter, terrific<br />
package. But there was more.... he said, " Fightback! should form the<br />
framework of the Opposition's next election policy." And, yesterday, Dr<br />
Hewson agreed with him. He said, this is Hewson, he said, " An awful lot of<br />
what we've said in health, family assistance, the aged, veterans, immigration,<br />
you name it," he said, " will go forward in a refined form to the next election.<br />
Well, presumably they're the same veterans Dr Hewson said were beneath<br />
his abilities, the same immigration that led him to say multicultural ism was<br />
absolutely a fundamental mistake.<br />
But, he's returning to Fightback! Like Wiley C. Coyote, he's returning to the<br />
scene of the accident. He said, " The essential philosophy of Fightback! has<br />
to be preserved" like the coyote waiting for the anvil to drop from the sky.<br />
But, they are an unhappy lot, these days, our opponents. No, they are no,<br />
they are an unhappy lot. They've got positively no regard for one another.<br />
And, we saw over the weekend Hewson and Peacock reported as referring to<br />
Howard as ' The Rodent' and Kennett referring to Costello as, ' Dog'. Not ' The<br />
Dog', just plain, ' Dog'. And, of course, Bronwyn, who enjoys almost universal </p>
<p>contempt in the party, well she's had a rough couple of weeks and after we'd<br />
presented the White Paper I was cruising down the corridor of my office and I<br />
heard this great roar of laughter come from the office... and I put my head in<br />
just as the camera was panning away from Bronwyn's press conference.<br />
There she was talking to the camera, all by herself. You know, how the<br />
budgie talks to itself in the mirror. There she was, up, talking to herself.<br />
Oh no, well you laugh.... John Hewson was up there yesterday at his family<br />
conference and I always remember something Jack Lang said to me, and of<br />
course whenever I mention Jack Lang they always hate it, because they hate<br />
the memory of Lang, you know.., he said to me, " Look, I'll tell you this, Paul,<br />
never be worried about the skyrockets of politics. At first a shower of sparks<br />
and then a dead stick falls to earth." And I thought, in fact, the fireworks<br />
analogy fits this lot well. And some of you are old enough to remember<br />
cracker night... and I've seen this bunch sitting on the front bench, crackers,<br />
as crackers, with Hewson the skyrocket and Howard, Howard always such<br />
promise. He always reminded me of that thing called the flower pot. Now, I<br />
don't know if any of you remember the flower pot but that was the one where<br />
it always promised a dazzling performance. And you'd light it up and it had<br />
multi-colours and it did a show for you but, often, when you lit it up it went<br />
fffftt, you know, a bit of a spark.... and there was a bit of a show and then<br />
there'd be a bit more and a bit more, then, finally, it fell away to nothing. And<br />
that's really, basically, very typical of his contribution.<br />
Then there's McLachlan, our establishment friend, who was supposed to<br />
have come to Canberra and really gone off with a big bang. I always think of<br />
him as the bunger, you know, the big red bungers... The strong silent type<br />
capable of the big bang, you light it up, everyone stands back and then the<br />
wick sort of goes down.., and everyone's waiting... and they keep on waiting...<br />
and that's it, it doesn't go off. And then there's Bronwyn, she reminds me of<br />
the catherine wheel. We used to nail them to the fence and they'd go off and<br />
they'd take off, spreadeagle the kids, burn the dog, run up a tree and then<br />
fizzle out going round in circles. So, that's them. Bitter, burnt out and<br />
accident prone.<br />
Nevertheless, we can never be complacent about them. And we won't be.<br />
Because, as Mike said and as Wayne alluded to, we have a generational<br />
change on our hands. Our party, our great party, has been in office now over<br />
a decade, federally and we are seeing a great generational change and a<br />
great new set of challenges. And, even if the Coalition is not up to it, even if<br />
they don't understand, even if they've learned nothing from their hard hearted<br />
cynical politics that doesn't deflect us from our challenge and the challenge to<br />
rejuvenate and to change as we go. And the enthusiasm, I think it's worth<br />
saying, that the enthusiasm of our Cabinet has got to be seen to be believed.<br />
The pride in the work, the commitment of people to the joint effort, the group<br />
effort, and the zing at meetings of the Cabinet and the committees is a<br />
tremendous reminder of the capacity of the Labor party to rise to the<br />
occasion. And I look at people like the Attorney General here from<br />
Queensland, Michael Lavarch, 31, the Attorney General, 31. You know, </p>
<p>Michael Lee, 35, holding down that huge job in the Arts and Communications,<br />
John Faulkner, all these new people have just joined the Cabinet recently.<br />
John Faulkner, Laurie Brereton, Carmen Lawrence, Peter Baldwin, Bob<br />
McMullan a tremendous group of new participants in the Cabinet process<br />
and mixed with the experience of people who've distinguished themselves<br />
over the years like Ralph Willis is doing now, as Treasurer, Kim Beazley,<br />
Gareth Evans, Brian Howe, Simon Crean, Robert Ray, Peter Cook, Nick<br />
Bolkus and Bob Collins. In terms of that mix of experience and commitment<br />
and the new members with so much promise and hope and generosity, then<br />
Labor is in for a very good time of being able to meet the challenges which<br />
come along. And that, coupled with the tremendous competence of our<br />
backbench and our ministry.<br />
And, I think one of the things I'd like to report to you is that I think that we are<br />
seeing, now, a corporatism and an understanding in our caucus to measure<br />
up to the task of managing this recovery and taking on the new challenges in<br />
a way I saw it shaping up in the 1983-84 caucus which carried us right<br />
through the 1980s. So, this is a tremendously good thing for the country, for<br />
our party and for the government. It is a tremendously good thing to see not<br />
just a competent Cabinet and a competent Ministry but another group of<br />
people who can fill their positions and who are prepared to commit<br />
themselves to the work of the caucus and to the backbench, in a unified team<br />
effort. I've never seen more policy unity in Canberra than now, I've never<br />
seen a greater pulling together, I've never seen Labor any better than it is at<br />
this time. And, this is a great thing.<br />
But, we have challenges and Wayne mentioned a couple of them in his<br />
opening remarks. One of them is, of course, the Asia-Pacific. We've got to<br />
create structures not just in Australia but create structures for Australia,<br />
outside of Australia. And we're doing this in bilateral relationships with<br />
countries, we're doing it in APEC which is a trans Asian-Pacific body, we're<br />
doing it in the development of the ASEAN regional forum, we're doing it right<br />
around the world. But, we're doing it most particularly in this part of the world<br />
and that job will always need constant work, it will always need constant<br />
attention. And, we're going to be giving it that work and constant attention.<br />
The other great change we embarked on in the last Parliament and this one<br />
is enterprise bargaining in the workplace: the hardest, deepest microeconomic<br />
reform in the country and of course, it's always left to the Labor<br />
government to do it. The Liberals now bemoan the centralised wage fixing<br />
system for its rigidities but it sat there all through their political history all<br />
through the period of their governments. And, in a party which is aligned to<br />
organised labour, to the trade unions, as the Labor party has, is the party<br />
which always finds these things difficult to do, we as always, have done it.<br />
When they've shirked it, we have done it and the challenge now is to make<br />
sure that the culture of productivity, low inflation and better wages and profits<br />
is exploited by the spread of enterprise agreements and enterprise flexibility<br />
across the economy over the course of this recovery. And, as we see that<br />
change home and it will take some seeing but as we see it home we will </p>
<p>have broken the back of the last really deep and intractable microeconomic<br />
area of the economy. So, after the big macro reforms of the eighties and<br />
many of the micro reforms, in telecommunications, in land transport, in<br />
shipping, in the airlines, we're now spiriting this change home. And, that's<br />
one which we will be taking the challenge on in the course of the parliament.<br />
The microeconomic reformagenda is never complete in any country that<br />
is, all these little parts of the private economy and the public economy which<br />
need to be honed up and lifted in efficiency. And, I'm very pleased to say that<br />
I welcomed again, at Council of Australian Governments ( COAG), Wayne's<br />
support for change at the micro level in respect of state authorities as the<br />
Commonwealth and states have, together, got to reform their own authorities,<br />
both tiers of government, to try and make this microeconomic reform a more<br />
successful one. So, whether it is in wharf authorities or grain handling or any<br />
of the other the production of electricity or gas or water this is another<br />
area of great national endeavour which will, again, test our abilities.<br />
Regional development is another. We have said that we want this to be a<br />
recovery for everybody and, to bring the regions of Australia into it. So<br />
that those people who live in provincial cities and of course this is the most<br />
decentralised of all of the Australian states with many provincial and regional<br />
cities and towns accross the state we want them to be part of the national<br />
recovery and the national economy. And, we've done things in Working<br />
Nation, in the White Paper, to make sure that we support the leaders of<br />
regional Australia who want to do new and good things for their communities<br />
and we give them that strategic assistance they will need to be able to do it.<br />
And put in their hands some of the financing instruments which they might<br />
use to pull their regions along. So, that remains a challenge for us.<br />
Cultural policy tying up the threads of our national life, is another. And<br />
we'll be releasing our cultural policy statement later in the year. But, this is<br />
an important thing about Australia's identity which Wayne mentioned earlier,<br />
about how we see ourselves and about how we see all the threads of our<br />
economic and social lives becoming part of our culture and our cultural life,<br />
perhaps, making it clear what sort of complexion it places on Australia as a<br />
society and as a country. And then, of course the republic. Because it is not<br />
just enough to say it's inevitable, if we believe in it, we have to do it. And,<br />
again, like the White Paper, this will depend on the whole country because<br />
this is something which has got to be done with understanding, where people<br />
know what they're doing, know its value, see its cultural significance and see<br />
its economic and social significance and it's something which the<br />
Australian people will need to understand and, of course, support by<br />
referendum. So, it's got to be done with the whole country.<br />
All of these things have got to be done with the country, all of those things I<br />
mentioned: the Asia-Pacific, enterprise bargaining, microeconomic reform,<br />
regional development, cultural policy, our identity, the republic, these are part<br />
of the forward challenges facing the government, facing Australia, facing all<br />
of us as a people and as a country. So, I am delighted with the opportunity to </p>
<p>talk about these things here in Brisbane at the same place that I started<br />
articulating the policy which was the beginning Labor's return to the election<br />
in 1993. And, maybe it's entirely apt that when Wayne approached me and<br />
said why don't we have a day together in Queensland talking about some of<br />
these major issues, including a dinner for the " true believers", the faithful, that<br />
I thought, well, this has been nothing but a good omen for me and, I hope, for<br />
the government. So, I hope that with the support of you people in the<br />
Queensland Labor Party we'll be able to chart a course forward, not worry<br />
about our opponents, leave them in our wake and go on to make the changes<br />
which will make this a great and powerful, but really decent and nice, place<br />
live.<br />
The Queensland Labor party is a no nonsense show that has always kept<br />
closely in touch with the community. It's not middle-classed out of existence.<br />
It's a show which has that common touch and the earthiness which has given<br />
it great strength and we can see this in the Queensland Government. I<br />
think that this is one of the states where Labor has seats to win and will be a<br />
key state in returning the federal Labor Government in the next election. So,<br />
thanks for having me back on this occasion, it's a long way from the election<br />
now but we've got a lot to do yet. And, as we do it I hope you people of the<br />
Labor party in Queensland can be proud of this government, proud of what<br />
we stand for, but, as important as that, know one thing, that we'll all stand<br />
together Commonwealth Labor Government, Queensland Labor<br />
Government, Paul Keating and Wayne Goss, our ministers, our party friends<br />
and supporters, all of us, together. Thank you.<br />
