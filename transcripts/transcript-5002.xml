PRIME MINSTER<br />
FOR PRESS 29 MARCH 1979<br />
ASTEC STATEMENT<br />
In making this statement, I should, at the outset, remind<br />
Honourable Members that an advisory committee on Science and<br />
Technology was set up in 1972 when I was the Minister<br />
responsible for Education and Science.<br />
This action was taken by the Coalition Government in the<br />
light of experience and developments overseas. It followed<br />
discussions with leading industrialists, the Australian<br />
Academy of Science and senior Government scientists.<br />
The Committee was disbanded by the Labor Government in<br />
February 1973 and was not replaced until mid-1975, when an<br />
interim Australian Science and Technology Council was set<br />
up, pending the passage of legislation.<br />
On 9 February 1976, a small group of distinguished scientists<br />
and industrialists was formed to advise me on the role of a<br />
permanent Science and Technology Council. The Report from<br />
this group was presented in April 1976. After consideration<br />
of the Report I announced that the interim ASTEC would be<br />
given the primary task of reporting on arrangements for a<br />
permanent Science and Technology Council.<br />
After consulting ' widely and considering the issues in detail,<br />
the interim ASTEC produced a report entitled " Future Arrangements<br />
for an Australian Science and Technology Council". The<br />
Government accepted this report, and I announced the formation<br />
of the permanent ASTEC in Parliament on 19 April 1977. I<br />
also announced then that ASTEC would be a statutory body.<br />
The legislation to establish it was passed by the Parliament<br />
last year.<br />
During its period of operation the interim ASTEC provided<br />
valuable advice to the Government on a wide range of matters,<br />
including: Australia's participation in the first world-wide<br />
series of experiments of a major international research<br />
programme known as the global atmospheric research programme:<br />
Whether Australia should install facilities to receive and<br />
process information from Landsat, the USA's earth resources<br />
satellite:. Arrangements for surveys of our biological<br />
resources, particularly our unique and extensive flora and<br />
fauna. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
With regard to the global atmospheric research programme,<br />
the Government accepted interim ASTEC's advice that funds be<br />
provided for Australia's participation in an international<br />
programme to improve knowledge and understanding of the<br />
global circulation system.<br />
On the Landsat programme, the Government's decision to establish<br />
receiving and data processing facilities in Australia at<br />
an estimated cost of $ 4.2 million was in line with interim<br />
ASTEC's advice. Following ASTEC's advice on biological<br />
resources the minister for Science announced on 20 August<br />
1978 that the Government had approved long-term arrangements<br />
for recording Australia's flora and fauna. These included<br />
a new Advisory Committee for the Australian Biological<br />
resources study.<br />
Since the permanent ASTEC was established, its substantial<br />
commitment has been the preparation of the report " Science<br />
and Technology in Australia 1977-78", on which I will have<br />
more to say shortly.<br />
As well as this major task, however, ASTEC has also been<br />
occupied in providing advice to the Government on a wide<br />
range of matters. Some of the more important include: The<br />
Report of the Independent Inquiry into the CSIRO.<br />
ASTEC's comments on this major report assisted the Government<br />
to decide on the Report's recommendations, and on the future<br />
form and role of CSIRO. I tabled these comments in this<br />
House on 11 May 1978.<br />
ASTEC has also, at the Government's request, reported on<br />
energy research and development in Australia. I presented<br />
this report to Parliament on 4 April 1978.<br />
ASTEC's advice, in conjunction with that provided by the<br />
National Energy Advisory Committee, was instrumental in the<br />
establishment of the National Energy Research Development<br />
and Demonstration Council.<br />
In May 1978, the Government asked ASTEC to report on the role<br />
and level of activity, of the Bureau of Mineral Resources.<br />
ASTEC's report, containing detailed recommendations on how<br />
BMR's resources should be deployed to best meet national<br />
goals, was tabled on 21 November 1978. ASTEC's recommendations<br />
on BMR are to be considered by the Government shortly.<br />
In June 1978, the Government requested ASTEC to report on<br />
the direct funding of basic research. The Government is<br />
examining this report as a matter of urgency, and for the<br />
information of Honourable Members, I present that report.<br />
other activities undertaken by ASTEC are described in the<br />
Council's first Annual Report covering the period from its<br />
formation to 30 June 1978. I also present the Annual Report<br />
today for Honourable Members' information. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I turn now to ASTEC's report on " Science and Technology<br />
in Australia, 1977-78". The Council has prepared its report<br />
in two volumes. Volume 1 contains the Council's views and<br />
recommendations. Volume 2 comprises a series of chapters,<br />
each describing the present situation in a particular area<br />
of activity.<br />
Because of the many and complex issues involved, this task<br />
has been a demanding one and has taken some time to complete.<br />
For this reason, Volume 1 was produced in two parts. Volume 1A<br />
was tabled on 26 September 1978. It contains ASTEC's views<br />
and recommendations on the organisation of Science and Technology<br />
in Australia and on the specific areas of fundamental research,<br />
industrial research and development, the marine sciences and<br />
technologies and health. Volume lB contains ASTEC's views and<br />
recommendations on agriculture and forestry, mineral resources,<br />
manufacturing industry, services and environment. For the<br />
information of Honourable Members, I present Volume IB and<br />
Volume 2.<br />
The Government, for its part, has now completed its consideration<br />
of the recommendations of Volume 1A. I take this opportunity<br />
to announce the Government's decisions with respect to those<br />
recommendations. Volume IA of the ASTEC Report is a valuable survey, which has<br />
assisted the Government in its consideration of Science and<br />
Technology programmes. In this Volume, ASTEC has identified<br />
four main areas of concern in Australian science and technology:<br />
industrial research and development; marine sciences and<br />
technologies; fundamental research; and, health.<br />
One of the economic consequences of the increased inflation<br />
of the 1972-75 period was a serious downturn in manufacturing<br />
industry in Australia. This resulted in a reduced level of<br />
research and development being carried out in industry.<br />
ASTEC's examination of industrial research and development<br />
concluded that increased Government incentives for industrial<br />
research and development were warranted. The Council placed<br />
such importance on this matter that the Chairman, Professor<br />
G. M. Badger, wrote to me prior to the last Budget requesting<br />
that the Government give urgent consideration to the Council's<br />
recommendation that the level of Government support for<br />
industrial research and development be increased.<br />
The Government took action in the Budget in accord with the<br />
broad thrust of this request. A joint announcement by the<br />
Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Productivity,<br />
following last year's Budget gave details of increases in<br />
funding for industrial research and development. The extra<br />
funds are available under the Industrial and Development<br />
Incentives Act 1976 and amendments were introduced during<br />
the last sittings of Parliament to improve the Act's effectiveness. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
In 1978-79, an estimated $ 24 million has been provided for<br />
industrial research and development. Compared with expenditure<br />
of $ 13.7 million in 1977-78, this is an increase of 73 per<br />
cent. The increased allocation is financing an expanded<br />
programme of commencement and project grants under the<br />
Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme.<br />
As well, it is supporting major industrial research and<br />
development projects, which are in the public interest,<br />
with potential national and international application. The<br />
Government is also aiding the implementation of a number of<br />
pilot programmes in the areas of technology transfer and the<br />
commercial exploitation of Australian inventions.<br />
Manufacturing industry, the mining industry, and the rural<br />
industries generate much of Australia's wealth. The<br />
productivity of these industries is critical to our<br />
prosperity and improvements in technology by innovation and<br />
by technology transfer are ofE great importance to our domestic<br />
and international competitiveness, and the level of employment.<br />
In this regard, I would draw the Honourable Members' attention<br />
to the Crawford Report's broad endorsement of ASTEC's views<br />
on the importance of stimulating innovation in Australian<br />
industry. I am sure that the House is aware that the Australian<br />
invention, Interscan, has been accepted as the international<br />
aircraft landing system of the future. This great development<br />
confirms that Australia is carrying out research at the<br />
forefront of science and technology and is able to apply<br />
that research to practical uses.<br />
However, our economic future will depend also on our success<br />
in devising numerous innovations perhaps of a less dramatic<br />
nature, but in the aggregate of undoubted importance.<br />
Our success with large-scale mining operations in remote<br />
regions, for example, has only been possible following<br />
development of our railway systems to a stage where as a<br />
result of technological advances in the design of rails and<br />
bearings, they are able to support the huge trains and heavilyladen<br />
trucks which carry minerals from the mines to the coast.<br />
Another important innovation is the development by CSIRO of a<br />
" Sirotem", an instrument to dete ct mineralisation buried<br />
under thick overburden. This is an important development<br />
for mineral exploration in tropical and arid environments.<br />
Sirotherm, a process for the desalination of water, jointly<br />
developed by CSIRO and ICI, is currently being examined by<br />
the Department of Productivity with a view to possible funding<br />
under the public interest section of the Industrial Research<br />
and Development Incentives Scheme. </p>
<p>I particularly draw to Honourable Members' notice three<br />
ASTEC proposals aimed at building Australian industry's<br />
technological base and stimulating innovation.<br />
The first suggests that governments and agencies should give<br />
greater attention to the placement of research and development<br />
contracts with industry. The Council believes that " a<br />
closer and more fruitful association between industry and<br />
Government laboratories must be beneficial, and that the<br />
placement of research and development contacts in industry<br />
will substantially assist this association"<br />
The Government recognising that this proposal could enable<br />
industry to develop and maintain improved research and<br />
development capacity is attracted to this concept, and<br />
believes that further examination is required. We have<br />
requested ASTEC to undertake a more detailed examination of<br />
the proposal in consultation with the appropriate Government<br />
departments and agencies, so that the cost-effectiveness<br />
and longer-term possibilities are analysed in some detail.<br />
The second proposal relates to special measures to encourage<br />
technological efficiency and innovation in small companies by<br />
the promotion and formation of research associations. This<br />
broad policy issue is currently being considered by the<br />
Government as a result of its decisions on the CSIRO Inquiry<br />
Report. ASTEC's contributions will assist this process.<br />
The third proposal relates to institutional arrangements for<br />
encouraging the development of research findings. The<br />
Crawford Committee has also recommended that a body to promote<br />
innovation be established. The Government is examining the<br />
operating experience of research development corporations<br />
such as the ( UK) National Research Development Corporation,<br />
to see whether this mechanism would be suitable to Australian<br />
conditions. ASTEC has also recommended " that greater attention be paid to<br />
the marine sciences and technologies in Australia". The<br />
Government accepts this recommendation. It recognises the<br />
great importance of the marine sciences and technologies in<br />
our future well-being.<br />
I remind the House that the Australian Institute of Marine<br />
Science was established under a previous Coalition Government<br />
when I was Minister responsible for--Education and Science.<br />
The importance of marine science in this regard has increased<br />
in recent years; particularly in relation to off-shore<br />
energy resources and the utilisation and management of resources<br />
in our expanded off-shore economic zone. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
The Government has accepted ASTEC's suggestion that an<br />
Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee<br />
( ANSTAC) be established. The Committee will investigate and<br />
report on the co-ordination of research and development and<br />
the establishment of priorities in this area.<br />
I am pleased to advise the House that this Committee will<br />
be chaired by Professor A. J. Birch, a distinguished scientist<br />
whose wide research experience will be invaluable in this<br />
important task.<br />
Because of the need to avoid the proliferation of science<br />
advisory committees outside the purview of ASTEC, AMSTAC<br />
will be established as a standing committee of that Council.<br />
It will work closely with relevant Ministers, particularly<br />
the Minister for Science and the Environment.<br />
As a general rule, advisory committees such as AMSTAC will<br />
be established as standing committees of ASTEC, particularly<br />
in areas of science and technology where a number of<br />
ministerial portfolios are involved. ASTEC has also<br />
recommended an increase in funds for projects of merit and<br />
promise in health research and basic research.<br />
In the current year, pending consideration of the ASTEC Report<br />
on Basic Research, funding for the Australian Research Grants<br />
Committee and the National Health and Medical Research Council, has<br />
been maintained at the same levels, in real terms, as in<br />
1977-78.<br />
other decisions taken by the Government with respect to the<br />
Astec Report, relate to the rationalisation of funding procedures<br />
particularly in regard to the use of scientific equipment and<br />
facilities through greater empahsis on the centralised use<br />
of equipment, and the need for co-ordination mechanisms<br />
for special requests for new equipment to avoid overlap and<br />
duplication. I take this opportunity to announce details of the membership<br />
of the statutory ASTEC. As Honourable Members will be aware,<br />
the Australian Science and Technology Act of 1978 received<br />
Royal Assent on 22 June 1978 and it was proclaimed on 28<br />
February 1978.<br />
The members of the Statutory Council are: Professor G. M. Badger,<br />
( Chairman) Research Professor of<br />
Organic Chcmistry, the University of Adelaide; Professor<br />
Sir Rutherford Robertson, F. R. S. ( Deputy<br />
Chairman), Formerly Director, Research School of Biological<br />
Sciences, Australian National University; Professor B. D. 0.<br />
Anderson, Professor of Electrical Engingeering,<br />
University of Newcastle; Sir Samuel Burston, President, / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council; Dr. L. W. Davies<br />
Chief Scientist, Amalgamated Wireless<br />
( Australasia) Ltd.; Mr. A. W. Hamer, Deputy Chairman,<br />
ICI Australia Limited; Professor B. E. Hobbs, Professor of<br />
Geology, Monash University; Dr. P. S. Lang, Member, Commonwealth<br />
Council for Rural Research and Extension; Mr. B. T. Loton,<br />
Chief General Manager, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company<br />
Limited; Professor Sir Gustav Nossal, Director,<br />
The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research;<br />
Sir Arvi Parvo, Chairman and Managing Director,<br />
Western Mining Corporation Ltd.; Mr. L. G. Peres, Reader in<br />
Political Science, The University of Melbourne; Mr. K. C. Stone,<br />
Secretary, Victorian Trades Hall Council; Professor R. Street,<br />
Vice Chancellor, The University of Western Australia;<br />
and Mr. J. G. Wilson, Chairman, Australian Paper<br />
Manufacturers Limited.<br />
The Government is pleased to have so distinguished a body to<br />
provide advice on matters of national importance in the<br />
broad areas encompassed by ASTEC's charter.<br />
I should like to commend the work which has been carried<br />
out by ASTEC over the last two years, and thank the Members<br />
of the Council for their time and effort.<br />
In particular, I should like to thank the retiring member,<br />
Sir Louis Matheson, for his important and valuable contributions<br />
to the Council's activities. Sir Louis served as Chairman of<br />
the interim Council, and when the permanent ASTEC was<br />
established, readily agreed to the Government's request<br />
that he serve for a further period as a member of the Council.<br />
I should also like to mention the valuable work of the<br />
present Chairman, Professor Geoffrey Badger. Professor<br />
Badger has held this position since early 1977 and during<br />
this period, has ably guided the Council in its deliberations.<br />
The Government is most grateful to him for his leadership of<br />
this important advisory body, and I am glad to be able to<br />
inform the House that he has accepted appointment as Chairman<br />
for a term of five years.<br />
Professor Sir Rutherford Robertson has been Deputy Chairman<br />
of the Council since its establishment early in 1977. His<br />
wise counsel has also greatly contributed to the success<br />
of ASTEC, and the Government is very pleased that Sir Rutherford<br />
has agreed to continue as Deputy Chairman.<br />
In view of the importance of the primary industry sector in<br />
Australia, the Government has thought it best to increase the<br />
expertise of the Council in this field. Accordingly,<br />
Dr. Patrick Lang has been appointed as the new member.<br />
Dr. Lang is a member of the Commonwealth Council for Rural<br />
Research and Extension, and also a member of the Universities'<br />
Council of the Tertiary Education Commission. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
In conclusion I should like to express again the Government's<br />
appreciation of the work being done by ASTEC. The role of<br />
the Australian Science and Technology Council is a particularly<br />
challenging one at this time, and will become more so in the<br />
years ahead with the increasing importance of the role of<br />
science and technology, and programmes of research and<br />
development which will lead to improved productivity and<br />
in turn to a stronger international trade, through better<br />
products and more efficient techniques.<br />
But research and development can do more. It can be the key<br />
to new industries and employment opportunities, create new<br />
vistas for society, and improve production in all industrial<br />
sectors.<br />
ASTEC will be an important aid to the Government in developing<br />
strategies to achieve these goals. </p>
