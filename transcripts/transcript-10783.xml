    <content><![CDATA[<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ray.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Obviously upset, are you embarrassed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, because this is a completely trivial allegation. The directorship</p>
<p>   of which he speaks is a directorship in the Menzies' Research</p>
<p>   Centre, not a public company in the ordinary sense of the word.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But it is a public company.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not in the ordinary sense of the word because it doesn't</p>
<p>   trade, it doesn't make any money. I wasn't paid anything.</p>
<p>   I had no personal private interest. And my directorship of that</p>
<p>   company flowed, as it were, automatically from my being Leader of</p>
<p>   the Party. If I had not been Leader of the Party, I would not have</p>
<p>   been a director. I never went...</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...can I finish, because I never went to any of the meetings. I</p>
<p>   had absolutely no private financial interest of any kind. It was</p>
<p>   a non-profit organisation, a company limited by guarantee. They</p>
<p>   got nothing out of it. And my total obligation, if it had gone belly-up,</p>
<p>   was $10.00.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But wasn't this the same argument that Graham Richardson used</p>
<p>   back in 1992 when you and the opposition parties attacked him in</p>
<p>   Parliament for being a member of the Labor-owned radio station in</p>
<p>   Newcastle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my understanding was that that was a commercial operation.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But he got no money out of it. The things you've just said</p>
<p>   were the same.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But it was a commercial operation. I mean, this is a completely</p>
<p>   trivial attempt to embarrass me. And the guidelines require disclosure</p>
<p>   so as to avoid a conflict of public duty and private interest. Now,</p>
<p>   I don't have any private interests. I had no personal financial</p>
<p>   interest in this company of any kind. It was something that automatically</p>
<p>   attached to me because I was the Leader of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>You've said that, but why then did your Health Minister, Mr</p>
<p>   Wooldridge, declare his membership, directorship of that same company?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons could be - and I haven't spoken to</p>
<p>   him - is that he's not automatically a member, automatically</p>
<p>   a director. Under the articles of association, he can only be so</p>
<p>   if I appoint him. But in any event, the rules don't say that</p>
<p>   you can't over-declare things. It's a question of whether</p>
<p>   you are required to. </p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>Laurie Oakes says that, in fact, you had a hidden motive, hidden</p>
<p>   agenda in that, the fact that you've realised...the reason</p>
<p>   why you're protecting Senator Parer is that you've now</p>
<p>   realised that you've breached your own code of ethics.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's completely wrong. I mean, it wasn't until</p>
<p>   I learnt this afternoon that this story was being run that this</p>
<p>   whole issue has ever come into my mind.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>So no one raised it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, nobody, incidentally, from your network gave me an opportunity</p>
<p>   of commenting on this before the story went to air, which I think</p>
<p>   it unusual, but that's a decision of your network. But can</p>
<p>   I just say again, that that claim that I had some hidden motive</p>
<p>   is absolute nonsense. Look, I don't have, at no stage I had</p>
<p>   any financial interest. I mean, conflict of interest arises where</p>
<p>   you have a collision between your public duty and your private interest.</p>
<p>   If you don't have a private interest, how can you have a collision?</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>We're almost out of time but I need to say it again, that</p>
<p>   you, in fact, led the campaign against Graham Richardson back in</p>
<p>   1992, almost on the same argument. Richo said that he had no money</p>
<p>   out of this, it was a Labor owned thing, as the Menzies is in your</p>
<p>   case and yet you attacked him.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of them was a commercial operation and the Menzies...</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But he got no money out of it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But the other is a commercial operation and, in any event, he was</p>
<p>   minister for communications and responsible...</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But you're the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but responsible for radio stations.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>But you're responsible for everything. You're the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I don't have any personal interest in this - none whatsoever.</p>
<p>   And it's a completely non-profit company. And I held the directorship</p>
<p>   not because I wanted to be a director of it or because I put any</p>
<p>   money into the company, but I held it, as it were, automatically</p>
<p>   because I was the Leader in the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party.</p>
<p>   Now, in those circumstances I don't believe there's any</p>
<p>   collision at all with the ministerial guidelines and I reject the</p>
<p>   claim made by Mr Oakes completely.</p>
<p>MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right. Prime Minister, thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p> for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
