TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, RAAF BASE, FAIRBAIRN, 25 OCTOBER<br />
1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you pleased to hear of the balance of<br />
payments figures today?<br />
PM: Well, they were certainly at the lower end of<br />
expectations, so that was good. But you can't, you know,<br />
can't read a final story into one month's figures, but we'd<br />
rather have them there than at the higher end of the range.<br />
Yes, that's true.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you rule out an election this year, Prime<br />
Minister? PM: Gee, you don't take long do you? No, I've got nothing<br />
to add to what I've said before on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Treasurer Keating's statement<br />
that interest rates may not come down before June next year?<br />
PM: I want to see the whole context of his statement.<br />
