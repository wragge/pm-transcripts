    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has confirmed that the site for Western Sydneyâs new airport will be Badgerys Creek.</p>
<p>For more than 50 years governments have talked about a second airport for Sydney.</p>
<p>The talk is over.Â  The final decision has been made.</p>
<p>This airport will be good for economic growth and good for jobs â both in Western Sydney and nationally.</p>
<p>Airports are unique in that they employ more people in operation than construction â so these are long term jobs for the future.</p>
<p>While the initial construction phase is expected to generate around 4,000 jobs, the airport development is expected to create 35,000 jobs by 2035, increasing to 60,000 jobs over time.</p>
<p>By 2060, the new airport has the potential to drive an increase in Australian gross domestic product (GDP) of almost $24 billion.</p>
<p>Although the Western Sydney airport will not be fully operational for a decade, planning for the new airport will start immediately and construction should start in 2016.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that most of the cost of the airport will be met by a private sector operator.</p>
<p>Without a new airport, we run the risk of the existing Kingsford-Smith Airport reaching capacity.Â  Sydneyâs airport is the gateway to Australiaâs largest city and accounts for 40 per cent of international arrivals and 50 per cent of international air freight each year.Â  If no action is taken on a second airport, Australia would lose out on 80,000 additional jobs and $34 billion in economic activity by 2060.</p>
<p>Todayâs decision recognises the growth of Western Sydney.Â  Over the next 20 years, the regionâs population is expected to grow from two million to three million people.</p>
<p>Western Sydney is already Australiaâs third largest economy and, in its own right, would be our fourth largest city.</p>
<p>A dedicated Western Sydney airport will service local aviation needs and be a much-needed relief valve for Sydney Airport. It will be a major catalyst for investment, jobs growth and tourism in the region for decades to come.</p>
<p>This is a major long-term infrastructure project.</p>
<p>Realistically, a new airport will see its first flight in the mid-2020s, so we are moving ahead. It is critical that we act now to finalise the necessary planning, including critical road network upgrades.</p>
<p>Because of the time it takes to plan and build an airport, the Governmentâs approach will be roads first; airport second.Â  The additional roads will be ready long before the airport is fully operational.</p>
<p>In coming days, the Government will, together with the NSW Government, announce the details of a major Western Sydney infrastructure package to deliver long overdue investment in the regionâs roads.</p>
<p>Building road and rail infrastructure to support Badgerys Creek will not just benefit airport users, but residents throughout Western Sydney.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the need for genuine consultation on this important issue. We have a responsibility to engage with the community to ensure that local voices are heard.</p>
<p>The Government is also aware of its obligations to offer the owner of Kingsford-Smith Airport the right of first refusal in relation to an airport at Badgerys Creek.</p>
<p>The Deputy Prime Minister has, therefore, written to Mr Max Moore-Wilton AC, Chairman of Southern Cross Airports Corporation Pty Limited, to advise him of the Governmentâs decision and to commence formal consultation in due course.</p>
<p>In opposition, the Coalition committed to make an early decision on Sydneyâs future airport needs. Thatâs exactly what weâve done.</p>
<p>The new airport in Western Sydney with supporting roads and transport infrastructure will make life easier in Sydney and make the economy stronger.</p>
