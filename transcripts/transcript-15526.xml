    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the President of the Republic of the Philippines, Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, will visit Australia from 30-31 May.</p>
<p>Australia and the Philippines enjoy a longstanding relationship. We cooperate closely on counter-terrorism issues and share strategic interests in regional peace and security. Our recent increase in development assistance to the Philippines to $100.6 million in 2007-2008 underscores our commitment to assisting the Philippines to address its development challenges. The signing of several government-to-government and commercial signings during President Arroyo's visit will expand further the scope of our bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>Our relationship is assisted by the large Australian-Filipino community which has helped foster close cultural and people-to-people links between our two countries.</p>
<p>President Arroyo will visit Canberra and Melbourne during her visit.</p>
