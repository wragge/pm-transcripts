FOR PRESS COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT OFFER TO ASSIST IN<br />
FINANCING OF WOOL PROMOTION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, announced today<br />
that the Commonwealth Government had decided to assist the<br />
woolgrowing industry to finance an expanded wool promotion<br />
campaign. The Government's decision was taken after considering<br />
a request made by the Executive Committee of the Australian Wool<br />
Industry Conference.<br />
Sir Robert said that the Government was willing to match<br />
Å 1 for Å 1 any additional funds which woolgrowers were prepared<br />
to contribute by way of levy for wool promotion. This meant that<br />
if woolgrowers agreed to increas3 their levy for promotion, which<br />
is at present 10/-a bale, the Commonwealth Government would contribute<br />
an amount equal to the additional fundw contributed by<br />
woolgrowers as a result of an increase in the levy.<br />
Sir Robert said that the Government's offer to match on<br />
a Å l for Å l basis any additional funds contributed by woolgrowers<br />
for wool promotion would apply for a period of three years. At<br />
the end of this period, the Government would review its assistance<br />
in the light of the circumstances at that time. The Australian<br />
Wool Board would be asked to report to the Government annually on<br />
the operation of the wool promotion programme.<br />
Although the Executive Committee of the Wool Industry<br />
Conference had also suggested that the Commonwealth Government<br />
should assist in providing additional funds for wool research,<br />
the Government decided to defer the consideration of this<br />
request for the time being. In making this decision, the<br />
Government took acco=. t o-f the fact that substantial reserve<br />
funds are at present available for financing wool research.<br />
However, it noted that these reserves were being<br />
depleted and would review the position after the Australian<br />
Wool Board had taken over the administration of wool research<br />
and had had the opportunity of examining future financial<br />
requirements. The Commonwealth Government is at present contributing<br />
the equivalent of a bale for wool research while<br />
woolgrowers contribute at the rate of a bale.<br />
Sir Robert said that this major decision by the<br />
Government had been taken in the light of special circumstances<br />
applying to the wool industry, its competitive position with<br />
other fibres and its significance to the Australian economy.<br />
