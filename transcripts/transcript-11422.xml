    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much your eminence, your grace, my many friends and all of</p>
<p>   you who have come along tonight particularly to demonstrate your support</p>
<p>   for the cause of liberalism not only here in New South Wales but throughout</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>  Some very kind things have been said about me tonight and I particularly</p>
<p>   thank my dear friend and former colleague as Deputy Prime Minister, Tim</p>
<p>   Fischer. I have said before that if I were in a political trench I would</p>
<p>   rather have Tim Fischer on my side than anybody else. And anybody who understands</p>
<p>   the support base and the origins of the National Party, once the Country</p>
<p>   Party of Australia, will understand how difficult it was for a leader of</p>
<p>   the National Party to give the total and uncompromising support for the</p>
<p>   gun control legislation that Tim did.</p>
<p>  It was easier in the cities than it was in the regions and the bush. But</p>
<p>   Tim has been nice, Alan's been nice, Michael Yabsley, Tony Staley, you have</p>
<p>   all been very kind but I wanted in the few moments I'll speak tonight I</p>
<p>   wanted to really turn it back on what has been said so kindly about me and</p>
<p>   to say that because this is a gathering of the faithful in a sense and the</p>
<p>   support base of the party here in Sydney and all of New South Wales and</p>
<p>   because I joined the Liberal Party in New South Wales and spent more than</p>
<p>   40 years as a member of the party starting here in Sydney that everything</p>
<p>   I have achieved in politics has been due to the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>  I would never have been a Member of Parliament without the support and the</p>
<p>   endorsement of the party. I would never have become Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p>   without the confidence of my parliamentary colleagues in the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   and I, of course, would never have become Prime Minister of Australia without</p>
<p>   the support of the Liberal Party. And I owe the Liberal Party a great debt</p>
<p>   and I am ever mindful of that and I have never forgotten what the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party did for me. I have never forgotten the political craft I learnt in</p>
<p>   my early years in the Liberal Party and as a symbol of that I am particularly</p>
<p>   happy that my dear friend, John Carrick and his wife Angela are with us</p>
<p>   tonight.</p>
<p>  Being Leader of the party is an enormous privilege. Of course to be Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of our country is the greatest privilege that can come the way,</p>
<p>   in my view, of any person in the democratic world. This country has assets</p>
<p>   and talents and capacities and a way of life that is properly the envy of</p>
<p>   the rest of the world.</p>
<p>  Alan referred to that phrase I often use that we occupy a unique intersection</p>
<p>   of both history and of geography and of culture. We are, in so many ways,</p>
<p>   a projection of western civilisation in our part of the world but that is</p>
<p>   not the full story. We have very close and enduring historic and other links</p>
<p>   with the people of North America but here we are in the Asian-Pacific region</p>
<p>   and having our own society nourished in a very positive way by the infusion</p>
<p>   of hundreds of thousands of Australians of Asian descent into our community.</p>
<p>   And that gives us a capacity to project that unique experience and that</p>
<p>   unique inheritance in a way that no other nation on earth is able to do</p>
<p>   in our part of the world. And that was one of the reasons why I believed</p>
<p>   that we were able to do what we did in relation to East Timor. And we have</p>
<p>   therefore not only a situation where we occupy that unique intersection</p>
<p>   but we also have, with that, an enormous responsibility.</p>
<p>  We now have the strongest economy in the Asian-Pacific region in terms of</p>
<p>   all the overall economic measurements. If I had stood before you a year</p>
<p>   ago I would not have been able to say with total conviction that we were</p>
<p>   going to stare down the worst economic downturn the Asian-Pacific region</p>
<p>   has seen. I would not have been able to say that. And I want to acknowledge</p>
<p>   the contribution that many have made to that. I acknowledge the contribution</p>
<p>   that Peter Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and the Treasurer,</p>
<p>   in the time that I have been Prime Minister the contribution that Peter</p>
<p>   has made to that and I acknowledge the contribution of many others.</p>
<p>  But the story of Australia at the moment is a story of immense achievement</p>
<p>   of great strength and enormous pride. I don't think this country has stood</p>
<p>   taller and stronger in the chances of the world than it does at the present</p>
<p>   time. Economic strength produces political and diplomatic strength. You</p>
<p>   are listened to with more attention and you are listened to more seriously</p>
<p>   if you speak from a base of economic strength and economic achievements.</p>
<p>  There are many things that we have achieved in the last almost four years</p>
<p>   and I and others have spoken of them. This year has been an incredibly intensive</p>
<p>   year. Taxation reform, industrial relations reform and above all the achievement</p>
<p>   of bringing to the people of East Timor the freedom that they had the opportunity</p>
<p>   of voting for and they voted for so overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>  We were able to achieve in that diplomatic effort the assembly of a United</p>
<p>   Nations peace enforcement operation with a speed and a decisiveness that</p>
<p>   had not previously been matched in any other peace enforcement operation</p>
<p>   carried out under the aegis of the United Nations. And that is a source</p>
<p>   of enormous strength to this country and a source of very great pride and</p>
<p>   it reflects enormous credit on the Coalition Government. The Coalition Government</p>
<p>   was told - and I almost feel it that I shouldn't do it but I will introduce</p>
<p>   a partisan note into this brief address - the Coalition Government before</p>
<p>   it was elected was told that it didn't understand how to deport itself in</p>
<p>   the Asian-Pacific region. We were told that the leaders of that region wouldn't</p>
<p>   listen to us. We were told that we didn't understand how to make our way</p>
<p>   in the region. I think we have demonstrated how totally fatuous and stupid</p>
<p>   that assertion was because what we have succeeded in doing overwhelmingly</p>
<p>   is to intelligently re-balance the relationships of this country with the</p>
<p>   other nations of the world.</p>
<p>  I have been a very lucky person in public life. I was lucky that I joined</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party. I was lucky to have parents who taught me the value of</p>
<p>   hard work, of loyalty to your community, of loyalty to your country and</p>
<p>   of the importance of small business in our community. And I am delighted</p>
<p>   to have two of my three brothers and their wives here tonight. As many of</p>
<p>   you know, I have another brother but he belongs to another political party</p>
<p>   and we get on very well but we have a standing arrangement that there's</p>
<p>   anything involving me that doesn't involve a dollar for the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   he comes, but if there's anything that involves a dollar for the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party he doesn't. But I was very fortunate and I've had a very, very fortunate</p>
<p>   life indeed in politics.</p>
<p>  There are many people that I should thank tonight and the list is too numerous.</p>
<p>   But I do particularly want to thank Janette, and Melanie, and Tim and Richard,</p>
<p>   my wife and my three children who are the source of the greatest pleasure</p>
<p>   and satisfaction and happiness in my life, and have been an absolutely indispensable</p>
<p>   part of anything that I might have achieved both as Prime Minister and in</p>
<p>   my other political responsibilities and I thank them very warmly.</p>
<p>  Can I say just one thing about the future and that is that it's frequently</p>
<p>   and rightly said that you judge the future prospects of a nation by the</p>
<p>   projection and the values and the standing and the capacities of its young</p>
<p>   people. I've had the privilege over the last week of mixing with two separate</p>
<p>   groups of young Australians. Last weekend as you all know I visited Dili,</p>
<p>   and I think I'm the first Prime Minister since John Gorton who is with us</p>
<p>   tonight who visited our forces in Vietnam, to have visited Australian forces</p>
<p>   in a theatre of military operation. And the privilege that it was of visiting</p>
<p>   the committed young men and women, overwhelmingly young men and women, a</p>
<p>   sense of professionalism, a sense of dedication and commitment and decency,</p>
<p>   not only in pursuing their military objectives but also in winning the hearts</p>
<p>   and minds of the people of East Timor. And that was an extraordinary privilege.</p>
<p>  The other privilege I had last week was to spend a very happy evening with</p>
<p>   arguably one of the greatest sporting teams that Australia has sent overseas</p>
<p>   in recent years, the victorious Wallabies who won the World Cup in Cardiff</p>
<p>   only very recently. They are absolutely without doubt in my mind as fine</p>
<p>   a group of ambassadors to this nation as well as great sportsmen that one</p>
<p>   could ever hope to have and to meet. And when I think of those two groups,</p>
<p>   I see a young Australia comprised of decent, committed, capable, enterprising,</p>
<p>   with the appropriate degree of recklessness and lack of fear that is the</p>
<p>   stuff of a great a nation. And as Prime Minister it not only fills me with</p>
<p>   immense pride but it also fills me with immense hope and immense optimism</p>
<p>   about the future of our nation.</p>
<p>  I was meant to finish my speech and I do it by very importantly thanking</p>
<p>   all of you for the support that you are giving to the Millennium Forum here</p>
<p>   in New South Wales. It is important but more than that it is critical to</p>
<p>   the future of the Division here in New South Wales. I deeply appreciate</p>
<p>   the support you have given. I congratulate Michael Yabsley and his incredible</p>
<p>   energy, his incredible commitment. To raise money for a political cause</p>
<p>   requires energy, cheek persistence, a willingness to take knock backs and</p>
<p>   come back again, and Michael's got all of those qualities. I respect him</p>
<p>   for it, I thank him, I declare the Forum launched and may it make a magnificent</p>
<p>   contribution to the cause in which we all believe here in New South Wales</p>
<p>   and all around Australia. Thank you very much for your support.</p>
