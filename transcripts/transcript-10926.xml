    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Lauren, to Mr Peter Hutchinson the Principal</p>
<p>   of Brooks High School, Mr Bill Lawson the Director of the Beacon</p>
<p>   Foundation, to my ministerial colleagues Jocelyn Newman and Warwick</p>
<p>   Smith, to my other Federal and State Parliamentary colleagues, ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I must say that of all the occasions that comes the way of a Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, and there are many and varied occasions in all parts of</p>
<p>   Australia, and none is quite so inspiring and encouraging and warming,</p>
<p>   if I can put it that way, as an example of a school, a local business</p>
<p>   community Â a broader community Â and the student body</p>
<p>   cooperating together to provide a brighter and more optimistic future</p>
<p>   for the young people who are passing out of that school. And I want,</p>
<p>   quite unreservedly, to congratulate all of those who are associated</p>
<p>   with the No Dole project here at Brooks school. It is inspiring</p>
<p>   that people are willing to give their time on a voluntary basis</p>
<p>   to provide a greater sense of hope and encouragement and optimism</p>
<p>   to the young within our community.</p>
<p>The opportunity and the achievement of permanent work is, of course,</p>
<p>   a cherished goal of all young Australians. Many achieve it, some</p>
<p>   don't. The important thing is that they know along the way</p>
<p>   they have the understanding and the sympathy and the help, not only</p>
<p>   of their parents and their brothers and sisters and their friends,</p>
<p>   but also many in the community, starting at the local community</p>
<p>   through to levels of State and Federal Government. And what is so</p>
<p>   appealing to me about the No Dole project here is that what you</p>
<p>   are doing is you are wanting to eliminate the dole as an option</p>
<p>   for young people in the future. And I can't think of a more</p>
<p>   laudable goal for young people throughout Australia than the elimination</p>
<p>   of the dole as an option. And you are not doing it in some kind</p>
<p>   of abstract pie in the sky way, you are doing it in a sound practical</p>
<p>   way by saying we don't just want you to put the dole aside</p>
<p>   as an option, we don't just want you to sign a no dole charter,</p>
<p>   we are, in fact, willing to give you help in order to achieve that</p>
<p>   objective.</p>
<p>The Government's own approach in this area is very similar.</p>
<p>   We launched last year, under the umbrella of the principle of mutual</p>
<p>   obligation, the notion of work-for-the-dole. Our view was that if</p>
<p>   people can't get work after trying hard to get it, then it</p>
<p>   is proper that the community support them, but they might be able</p>
<p>   to do something in return for that. And that is the principle of</p>
<p>   mutual obligation. And in the changes that we have made to the Youth</p>
<p>   Allowance Scheme we have sought to provide people with an incentive</p>
<p>   to go into training or to go into work rather than to go on the</p>
<p>   dole. And this particular scheme here in Launceston, here at Brooks</p>
<p>   School, is a magnificent example and it wouldn't have been</p>
<p>   made possible, of course, without the active involvement of the</p>
<p>   local community.</p>
<p>Australia has a tremendous tradition of voluntary effort. One of</p>
<p>   the things that binds Australians together - and you always see</p>
<p>   it in times of national disaster and adversity - is the willingness</p>
<p>   of people to sink their differences in the face of a common challenge</p>
<p>   and to work together and cooperate. We have seen it magnificently</p>
<p>   in the floods that have occurred in Wollonging, just south of Sydney.</p>
<p>   We see it in bushfires, we see it in other natural disaster and</p>
<p>   the way in which the community is prepared to work together to try</p>
<p>   and tackle the problem of youth unemployment and to give people</p>
<p>   the aspiration of something other than the dole is a magnificent</p>
<p>   example of the local community working together.</p>
<p>All of us have goals for Australia as we go into the 21st</p>
<p>   century. What the Government has been saying about taxation reform</p>
<p>   in recent weeks is about the aspirations we have for strengthening</p>
<p>   the Australian economy as we go into the 21st century.</p>
<p>   But if we are to realise our goals whatever they may be, we can't</p>
<p>   realise them alone. Governments can't do everything on their</p>
<p>   own whether it be a Federal government or a State government. Individuals</p>
<p>   can't do everything on their own. They need the love and support</p>
<p>   of their families, they need the understanding of their friends</p>
<p>   and they need the nurturing influence of their school environment,</p>
<p>   they need the help and the counsel of their teachers. And the business</p>
<p>   community and the broader community can't do everything on</p>
<p>   its own either. It needs an understanding and supportive government</p>
<p>   and it needs a proper bond of cooperation with individuals and families</p>
<p>   within the broader community.</p>
<p>So to achieve our national goals, to achieve our local goals, to</p>
<p>   achieve our personal goals, we do need a measure of cooperation</p>
<p>   between the individual, the broader community and the different</p>
<p>   levels of government. And this particular project, which I understand</p>
<p>   last year had a 100 per cent success rate. I can't think of</p>
<p>   anything in Australia that has a 100 per cent success rate. And</p>
<p>   I think Mr Hutchinson you are something of a role model and those</p>
<p>   who support you and the teachers, and I do want to spend a moment</p>
<p>   to thank the teachers, not just teachers here but teachers all around</p>
<p>   Australia in both government and independent schools for the magnificent</p>
<p>   job that they do. I am greatly indebted for the education that I</p>
<p>   received within the government school system in New South Wales.</p>
<p>   And it stayed with me for all of my life and I remain very grateful</p>
<p>   for what my teachers were able to do for me then. And I think all</p>
<p>   of you should feel the same debt to the counsel and the advice and</p>
<p>   the support that you have received from your teachers.</p>
<p>So can I wish the No Dole project for 1998 the same measure of</p>
<p>   success that has been achieved in the past. It is very difficult</p>
<p>   to do better than 100 per cent but there are always ways of working</p>
<p>   out how you can do that. But if you can do that again the satisfaction</p>
<p>   is immense because there is nothing quite so uplifting in any kind</p>
<p>   of community or public life than the feeling that you have actually</p>
<p>   done something very positive and very enduring to provide a brighter</p>
<p>   future for the young of our community and to help them along the</p>
<p>   way to realising their goals.</p>
<p>Goals in life are important. Never lose goals, never lose the zest</p>
<p>   and the commitment to set yourself goals. While ever you set yourself</p>
<p>   goals your life has a purpose. When you stop setting yourself goals,</p>
<p>   no matter what age you are, your existence and your life, and no</p>
<p>   matter what you are doing loses its meaning and its purpose. And</p>
<p>   the great goal of this project is that the dole should not be an</p>
<p>   option. That the real options in life are training and secure employment</p>
<p>   and further education. And they are goals that the Government has,</p>
<p>   they are goals that the community has. And it is obvious that they</p>
<p>   are goals that are shared in common by this school, its students</p>
<p>   and the broader community.</p>
<p>So I am very privileged to have been able to come here today. I</p>
<p>   thank the school for its hospitality. I very warmly congratulate</p>
<p>   its Principal, its teachers and, of course, Mr Lawson the Director</p>
<p>   of the Beacon Foundation, who really has been in many ways the original</p>
<p>   inspiration for this project and the work that he has done. And</p>
<p>   he said to me earlier that he hoped that I might carry the message</p>
<p>   of his Foundation across the Bass Strait. Well, can I assure him</p>
<p>   that I will because I haven't quite been at a gathering exactly</p>
<p>   like this in all the years that I have been in public life.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about cooperation between the community and the Government</p>
<p>   and schools and this particular gathering expresses it in an inspirational</p>
<p>   and purposeful way, the type of which I haven't seen before.</p>
<p>   And I really am very humble to have been invited to come here today.</p>
<p>   I am grateful for the role model that all of you represent to the</p>
<p>   rest of the Australian community. I wish it well. I have great pleasure</p>
<p>   in declaring the Brooks No Dole project for 1998 well and truly</p>
<p>   launched and I shall have great pleasure in signing the charter</p>
<p>   along with all the other students in Year 10. Thank you very much.</p>
<p> [Ends]</p>
