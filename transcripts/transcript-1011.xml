    <content><![CDATA[<p>[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 28th October, 1964.]</p>
<p><br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES (Kooyong Prime Minister) [4.8]</p>
<p>IÂ move-</p>
<p>That the Bill be now read a second time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Bill is to provideÂ increased salaries for the holders of theÂ statutory offices included in the schedule toÂ the Bill, the salaries for which are providedÂ by special appropriation. The Bill arises outÂ of the Government's decision to increaseÂ with effect from 1st November 1964 theÂ salaries of Permanent Heads and of theÂ holders of certain statutory offices now onÂ the salary levels of Â£Â 5,900 and Â£Â 6,900.Â These salary levels were determined in theÂ early part of 1960. The new salaries willÂ be Â£Â 63;7,500 and Â£Â 8,750 respectively. As Â honorable members will know, the 1960Â review for Permanent Heads and statutoryÂ office holders followed a general revisionÂ of the salaries of all other offices in theÂ Public Service.</p>
<p>In the last three years there have beenÂ substantial changes in the pay structure ofÂ the Commonwealth Service. These changesÂ have arisen as a result of the group byÂ group reviews by the Commonwealth ConciliationÂ and Arbitration Commission, theÂ Public Service Arbitrator and the PublicÂ Service Board. Major changes haveÂ emerged as a result of the seriesÂ of re-assessments for professional groups, Â commencing with the Commission's determinationÂ of June 1961 for engineers. TheÂ salary increases have had regard to allÂ factors relevant to wage and salary fixation,Â for example, Work value, comparative wageÂ justice and economic circumstances.</p>
<p><br />In order to illustrate the effect. of theseÂ developments, I mention that the totalÂ incrcase granted by the arbitral authoritiesÂ for the class 4 engineer in the Third Â Division at present on a salary of Â£ 3,733Â amounts to Â£Â 1,143. The similar increase forÂ the Principal Legal Officer in the ThirdÂ Division at present on a salary of Â£ 3,938Â amounts to Â£ 1,218. As explained in theÂ paper prepared by the Public Service BoardÂ and already presented to the House, theseÂ increases are quoted on the basis of theÂ positions most commonly found within theÂ new salary levels. In the Second Division,Â the December 1963 determination of theÂ Public Service Board, subsequently endorsedÂ by the Commission, resulted in some officesÂ receiving a higher rate of remuneration thanÂ that received by Permanent Heads ofÂ departments. The top salary in the SecondÂ Division is now Â£ 6,465 per annum.</p>
<p><br />The Government has decided that, in theÂ light of the time which has elapsed sinceÂ their salaries were last reviewed and of theÂ various developments in the CommonwealthÂ Service and elsewhere, a -further review forÂ Permanent Heads and the statutory officesÂ listed in the schedule to this Bill is nowÂ required. In determining the new salaryÂ levels to be applied, the Government tookÂ account of the high level of responsibility and the complex duties devolving upon theÂ statutory office holders and PermanentÂ Heads.</p>
<p>The salaries for the remainder of theÂ offices not within the jurisdiction of theÂ Public Service Board will be individuallyÂ reviewed by the Government and theÂ appropriate increases applied as from 1stÂ November 1964. Because the salaries areÂ provided from special appropriations, legislationÂ covering the offices of the PublicÂ Service Arbitrator, the Senior Commissioner,Â Commissioners and ConciliatorsÂ of the Commonwealth Conciliation afÂ Arbitration Commission and the ChairmanÂ and Members of the Taxation Boards ofÂ Review, and proposing effect from 1stÂ November in each instance, will be introducedÂ before the end of the presentÂ sessional period of Parliament. I commendÂ theÂ Bill to the House.<br />Â </p>
