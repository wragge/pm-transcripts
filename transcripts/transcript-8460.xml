TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH! PAUL LYNEHAM, 7: 30 REPORT, 13 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY'<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome again to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you Paul.<br />
PL: At your news conference this morning you talked<br />
directly to the Australian people and you linked race<br />
relations with the question of our national identity.<br />
What were you getting at there?<br />
PM: Just that I don't think that we are going to be certain<br />
who we are and be able to describe ourselves as ' One<br />
Nation' until we come to terms with this problem of the<br />
relations between Aboriginal Australians and non-<br />
Aboriginal Australians.<br />
PL: Why not? Surely white Australia has got a pretty good<br />
idea who and what it is.<br />
PM: It hasn't got a good enough idea to understand that the<br />
indigenous people of this country still live in<br />
poverty, still lack opportunity, still feel aggrieved<br />
and that I think does permeate Australian society and<br />
unsettles: it as it ought to.<br />
P: But isn't it uncomfortable but true to say that<br />
Australia was in fact founded on the basis of racism?<br />
We snatched this land off the Aborigines, we raped<br />
them, we murdered them, we pushed them into the back<br />
blocks and we haven't given them much of a go ever<br />
since.<br />
PM: I think there has been a conscientious view amongst<br />
Australians from the time, at least of the adoption of<br />
the Constitutional Amendment back in the late<br />
that there should be, at least the financial power of<br />
the Commonwealth, ought to be brought to bear upon this<br />
problem. I think what's happened since is we've seen a<br />
greater level of understanding by Australians about<br />
Aboriginal culture, about the problems of Aboriginal </p>
<p>-2<br />
life and a willingness on the part of the Australian<br />
community, in general, to try to solve it.<br />
PL: Yes, but which part of the Australian community? I<br />
mean changing attitudes in Balmain or Carlton may be<br />
one thing, in a lot of the out back towns its quite a<br />
different thing isn't it?<br />
PM: Probably that's true, but it's not as different as it<br />
was. I think we ought to use this opportunity again,<br />
this exercise as a turning point and just reflect upon<br />
what this; must mean to the families of the people<br />
involved and to ponder if that were the position of<br />
anyone el~ se's family.<br />
PL: A turningr point, you have also suggested that this was<br />
a criticaLl time in Australian race relations. Why is<br />
now so critical?<br />
PM: It comes at the end of this long Royal Commission, 3 or<br />
4 years of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It is, I<br />
think an opportunity, probably the last opportunity in<br />
this decade to come to terms with this problem. That's<br />
why the Government is now working its way through these<br />
recommendations and will respond fulsomely to them.<br />
But again., it's as much in the mind as it is in<br />
Commonwealth Budgetary programs or program delivery.<br />
It has to be a willingness, I think, on the part of the<br />
country of non-Aboriginal Australians to come to terms<br />
with these problems, to give Aboriginal people<br />
opportunities to take away this kind of attitude which<br />
this incident has evoked.<br />
PL: I heard that you said in Cabinet that this was a last<br />
chance to get it right this decade?<br />
PM: I did and I think it is. I think it deserves careful<br />
and serious consideration and as well as that,<br />
consultation with the States because I think the States<br />
have got to be in this. A lot of the delivery of these<br />
programs are with States and State governments. While<br />
we will be responding to the law and justice issues of<br />
the recommendations of the Commission in the first<br />
instance, and they will be substantial, the underlying<br />
causes of the problem about lack of job opportunities,<br />
lack of fulfilment and the general living standards of<br />
Aboriginal people, is an opportunity I think which the<br />
second part of our response will provide.<br />
PL: But if it's as much attitudes as money, what of the<br />
argument that; despite all the fine words and the tears,<br />
Federal Labor has basically failed the Aboriginal<br />
people since 1983?<br />
PM: We have dramatically increased funding to the area. </p>
<p>3-<br />
PL: There are still people without taps, without basic<br />
health services, all that money, all that rhetoric, all<br />
that drama and you still have to walk 100 yards to get<br />
cold water.<br />
PM: Well this in some places is obviously true. But there<br />
has been progress made and part of that has been while<br />
we've been cutting the Commonwealth Budget back<br />
dramatically through the ' 80s. We dramatically<br />
increased funding to Aboriginal programs.<br />
PL: We saw a hell of a lot of hair-brained schemes too<br />
didn't we in recent years?<br />
PM: I don't -think so.<br />
PL: Properties failing, Aboriginal motels failing.<br />
PM: No, what about the Community Development and Employment<br />
Program CDEP I think that has been a very good<br />
program, it's working, it's working well, we will<br />
probably expand it when we respond in the second part<br />
of our response. There has been, in terms of education<br />
opportuniLties, there has been I think a lot of<br />
successes in the 1980s.<br />
PL: Still no treaty though or anything like it?<br />
PM: No, but the reconciliation process is I think<br />
important. The work of that body will be both in<br />
attitudes and in program delivery, I think will be<br />
important:. Again, ATSIC is now set up so that that<br />
distribultion'is made on the basis of the priorities of<br />
Aboriginal people and management by Aboriginal people.<br />
So I think there has been quite a lot of progress, but<br />
again not: enough.<br />
PL: Even the latest submission to Cabinet in response to<br />
the Deaths in Custody Royal Commission, can you<br />
honestly say that it contains this sort of creative<br />
vision with programs that really are going to stand a<br />
change of breaking through, of breaking the cycle?<br />
PM: I think you will have to wait and see what the<br />
Government produces, Paul, and when it does it will<br />
have that: creativity.<br />
PL: But many Australians with the best will in the world<br />
think there has been a lot of money shovelled at this<br />
problem cover the years with very disappointing results.<br />
PM: Well, there has been in absolute terms a lot of money,<br />
but it is: still less than $ 5,000 per head of the<br />
Aboriginal population. I mean, it is not as many<br />
Australians imagine it to be. And therefore money is<br />
still rather thinly spread and has to be sensibly<br />
spent, and programs have to be well-designed and well-</p>
<p>-4<br />
delivere-d. ' Where we are guaranteeing, I'll guarantee<br />
you this: that at least in the response by the<br />
Governmetnt to the recommendations of the Royal<br />
Commission, the program design and delivery will be<br />
carefully thought over, carefully evaluated, and<br />
therefore our response, I hope and believe, will meet<br />
many of these problems.<br />
PL: You talk about the need for attitudes to change, Prime<br />
Minister, what about the argument that it is about time<br />
the Aborigines took stock of themselves as well?<br />
Charlie Perkins says they should be doing a lot more to<br />
look after themselves in terms of personal health,<br />
skills, opening up more opportunities on their own<br />
behalf. I<br />
PM: Part of that comes with opportunity. It comes with<br />
being part of society, having ones own wealth level and<br />
the self est ' eem which comes from having that self<br />
provision, if you like. I think one thing feeds upon<br />
another, and obviously success in this area must<br />
improve the lot of Aboriginal Australians. So, as they<br />
become as individuals more self reliant, these things<br />
will occur, rio doubt. But this is not generally true,<br />
there is not the private provision by Aboriginals for<br />
themselves as, say, commercial operators and ventures,<br />
although this is true in some places. It is not<br />
widespread. And giving them the opportunity to do<br />
things in their own right, successfully, I think is<br />
going to be Very important.<br />
PL: But you said' the other day you were a conservative<br />
family man. IHow would you like to be, say, walking<br />
with your kids through an outback town to find the<br />
local park fiill of drunken Aborigines, screaming abuse,<br />
smashing bottles? A lot of people who watch this<br />
program have' rung up with those sorts of stories. Now,<br />
they've got as much right to tell us what's happening<br />
in their community as anyone else, and it's not a<br />
pleasant sight.<br />
PM: No, but why are they like that? Because quite often<br />
they don't know who they are, that society has cast<br />
them off,, it doesn't want to know them, doesn't want to<br />
employ them, they don't have a serious role in life.<br />
PL: So they justispend the welfare checks down the pub?<br />
PM: They just won der who they are. So that's why I think<br />
it is important to get education there. On the basic<br />
things education, health care, and the opportunity<br />
through employment, employment experience, and wider<br />
employment opportunities in enterprises which are run<br />
by Aboriginals.<br />
PL: But if we can still say this in ' 92 after Labor has<br />
been in power for nearly a decade, it does suggest that<br />
Labor has~ n't grasped the nettle on this doesn't it? </p>
<p>5<br />
PM: This has been a long standing problem. We've tried to<br />
grasp it in terms of a monetary way, whether we've<br />
succeeded in grasping in an attitudinal or an effective<br />
way, I don't think we'd claim that. I think the Royal<br />
Commission recommendations make that pretty obvious,<br />
but what we will be doing is trying to meet those<br />
recommendations and to measure up to the expectations<br />
of the Aboriginal community in these respects.<br />
PL: How much of a racist do you reckon the average Aussie<br />
is these days?<br />
PM: There are many Australians that are not racist at all<br />
and racism I think is a diminishing thing in Australia.<br />
I think this is a tolerant country and racism in this<br />
country is I think less than other countries and there<br />
is a willingness I think in this country to get along,<br />
to understanding other peoples attitudes and problems<br />
and to have regard for their ethnic backgrounds.<br />
PL: Those who support the police in this situation, they<br />
say they're the ones that have to pick them up off the<br />
streets every Saturday night and fight them into the<br />
cells and have a very unpleasant time of it, that it's<br />
understandable perhaps that they should feel certain<br />
negative attitudes towards black people in some<br />
communities.<br />
PM: It's not understandable that somebody who died the way<br />
that David Gundy did or Lloyd Boney out of abject<br />
depression should be depicted in the cruel way that<br />
they were and in a way which must have brought<br />
tremendous sadness and grief to their families. I'm<br />
not sure many non-Aboriginal Australian families would<br />
like that done to them.<br />
PL: And should those two policemen still be in the police<br />
force do you think?<br />
PM: That's a matter for the NSW Government. The Minister<br />
for Aboriginal Affairs told me this morning that the<br />
Police Minister in NSW and the Commissioner of Police<br />
in NSW were taking action against the 2 officers<br />
concerned and they will make a judgement about it. But<br />
they also told Robert Tickner that NSW will be<br />
responding seriously to the Deaths in Custody Royal<br />
Commission.<br />
PL: And will the other States do you think?<br />
PM: I think so, I certainly will be engaging them on the<br />
problem.<br />
PL: Urgent and top level talks?<br />
PM: That was decided a week ago in Cabinet here, before<br />
this matter arose. </p>
<p>6<br />
PL: And what if they say look, the Keating recession,<br />
you've been squeezing us, we haven't got the money for<br />
this?<br />
PM: Well it's a matter of priorities. All Governments have<br />
got monies, it's a matter of where their priorities are<br />
and there can be, I think, no greater priority than<br />
coming to terms with this real problem for us.<br />
PL: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you Paul.<br />
