ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. r4HITLAM, M. P.<br />
COMMITTEE FOR. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA<br />
MENZIES HOTEL, SYDNEY<br />
FRIDAY, 7 MARCH, 1975<br />
This is the second successive Friday Luncheon<br />
I've spoken to representatives of the Sydney business<br />
community. If there are any here who were also at the<br />
Sydney Chamber of Commerce Luncheon I hope they will bear<br />
with any repetitiousness on my pa . rt because I do think<br />
that my theme itself bears some repetition.<br />
I emphasised there my Government's long-term<br />
commitment to the prosperity of tJ-le private sector.<br />
I was at some pains to refute the-assertion that there is<br />
anything phoney about this commitment that it represents<br />
some sort of panic response to present difficulties. I<br />
concede that there have been failures of communication in<br />
the past and I concede that some prejudices and<br />
pre-conceptions on both sides have raised needless<br />
difficulties. I do detect, however, in the business<br />
community generally a new willingness to co-operate, born<br />
of a mutual recognition that we share so many of the<br />
difficulties for so many of the same reasons. I think<br />
on both sides there is a willingness to end futile<br />
recriminations which of course, is not to say that we<br />
should not have plenty of constructive criticism. If<br />
I am right in this assessment that there is a healthier<br />
spirit emerging then I assure business that the Government<br />
is ready to go more than half way to foster it.<br />
Last Friday I drew attention to the way in which<br />
economic circumstances here and throughout the world<br />
were now subject to rapid change never experienced in<br />
our life-times. The business cycle which used to take<br />
five to seven years for its completion now appears to<br />
take about two years. This imposes unprecedented<br />
pressures on both Government and business and requires<br />
very great flexibility in policy planning for business<br />
and Government alike. In this situation one has to be<br />
extremely careful in making predictions based on the<br />
latest set of economic indicators. We have seen too<br />
many false dawns. Nonetheless, there are grounds for<br />
some cautious optimism. When I announced the new<br />
economic measures of 12 November 1974 and in subsequent<br />
statements to the nation, I emphasised the figures,<br />
particularly on unemployment and inflation, would not<br />
be good for many months to come. This remains true. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The situation at present, however, is that some of the<br />
more serious aspects of decline in activity are now<br />
behind us. Liquidity is freely available and the<br />
demand for funds, particularly for housing, is high.<br />
Imports are declining and the balance of payments<br />
situation particularly on current account is<br />
strengthening. We are seeking the first real signs that<br />
unemployment and inflation may have peaked. With the<br />
large personal tax cuts, including the housing interest<br />
deductability scheme now being reflected in pay packets,<br />
disposable incomes are rising strongly. By past<br />
standards the Government has given a massive expansionary<br />
boost to the economy in the measures taken since the<br />
budget. These are, of course, not normal times and we<br />
cannot be absolutely assured of normal reactions. The<br />
response of the private sector is the key ingredient in<br />
economic revival in 1975. You can be assured that the<br />
Government will do all in its power. to stimulate that<br />
revival, consistent with our overall goals of social<br />
advance and economic management.<br />
At the recent conference of the Australian Labor<br />
Party we inserted in the platform a specific recognition<br />
of the role of the private sector and a specific<br />
commitment to the development of a healthy mixed economy.<br />
I think it should be recognised, however, that the present<br />
Australian Government itself has from its inception<br />
tried to establish machinery and set in train measures<br />
to give practical expression to the formal commitment<br />
now contained in the Party's platform. In December 1972<br />
we established the Department of Manufacturing Industry.<br />
The first Minister was the present Treasurer and he set<br />
about establishing a network of industrial panels to<br />
provide channels for closer co-operation and consultation.<br />
Against much opposition we have sought to develop the<br />
role of the Australian Industry Development Corporation.<br />
In our first budget we provided funds to establish the<br />
National Management School within the University of New<br />
South Wales. We have set up the Small Business Bureau<br />
to provide advice and assistance for this very important<br />
but long neglected sector. We have sought to enhance<br />
profitability by reduction in company tax, by requesting<br />
the Prices Justification Tribunal to give particular<br />
consideration to the adequacy of return on capital and by<br />
urgently investigating the implications of rapid inflation<br />
for the taxation paid by companies. The report of the<br />
Mathews Committee is expected soon and actions on its<br />
recommendations will be prompt. We recognise the<br />
extraordinary impact of rapid inflation on corporate tax<br />
rules, particularly with respect to stock valuation and<br />
appreciation. / 3. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Perhaps most important of all in its long term<br />
implications will be the report of the Committee of<br />
Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Mr Gordon Jackson,<br />
General Manager of C. S. R. The Jackson Committee's<br />
terms of reference are to advise on the future role of<br />
manufacturing industry, the role of foreign companies<br />
in the Australian economy, the long term balance between<br />
exports and imports, better communication between<br />
Government, industry, the States and employees'<br />
organisations. I am quite determined that the report<br />
of the Jackson Committee will not suffer the fate of<br />
the Vernon Committee. We will not stall it or pigeon-hole<br />
it and we will not set out deliberately to rubbish it or<br />
bucket it. One of the sorriest aspects of the Vernon Report<br />
was that the treatment meted out to it acted as a<br />
discouragement to highly qualified, busy and public spirited<br />
persons in serving the nation in similar roles. One of<br />
the most gratifying experiences I have had as Prime Minister<br />
has been the readiness of distinguished Australians, in<br />
business, the professions and the Universities to serve on<br />
the many commissions and committees of inquiry which we<br />
have established. I believe that a big factor contributing<br />
to this readiness to serve has been the positive acceptance<br />
by the Government of their work. Men and women called upon<br />
to serve Australia in this way know that they are not<br />
wasting their time.<br />
our major piece of current legislation concerning<br />
the private sector is, of course, the Corporations and<br />
Securities Industry Bill. I am sure that members of<br />
C. E. D. A. are too sophisticated to give the Pavlovian<br />
response we ' ye had from some quarters that this is an<br />
attack on freedom of private enterprise. The fact is<br />
that without the establishment of the Corporations and<br />
Exchange Commission as the National Regulatory Authority<br />
to supervise the securities industry in Australia, the<br />
future prosperity of Australia cannot be assured because<br />
the economic development of any nation is directly<br />
determined by its efficiency in raising new capital.<br />
During the mining boom, vast sums of money were raised<br />
which was wasted and never found its way into mining.<br />
The efficient mobilization and allocation of<br />
capital through the medium of the stock exchanges can only be<br />
optimised if the exchanges provide and, just as significantly<br />
are seen to provide, a fair and orderly market. The market<br />
must be one in which both the financially sophisticated<br />
investor and also the unsophisticated investor with the<br />
aid of his investment adviser can invest his capital.<br />
However large or small an amount it may be, with the<br />
knowledge that the risk he assumes can be evaluated on<br />
accurate information disclosed to him and that his risk will<br />
be subject only to the usual commercial hazards. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
The self-regulating activities of the Stock<br />
exchanges during the mining boom period were abysmally<br />
lax. Even formal rules, which were and are still<br />
minimal, were as the RAE Report recounts seldom<br />
enforced and were viewed with contempt by some members<br />
who continued with their practices in blatant disregard<br />
of the stock exchange regulations and of their fiduciary<br />
duties, on the assumption that their abuses would go<br />
undetected or unpunished; an assumption by no means<br />
unreasonable in the absence of adequate surveillance<br />
by some independent authority.<br />
The genuine difficulties which have been<br />
encountered by self-regulatory bodies and the State<br />
authorities in dealing with the securities industry have<br />
been partly due to the failure of some of the States to<br />
recognise the national character of the securities markets<br />
and of the securities industry. If one recognises that<br />
each stock echange functions only as part of an Australia-wide<br />
network and that to a very large degree, listed public<br />
companies carry on their businesses on an Australia-wide<br />
or national basis, then it should be obvious that the<br />
problem of attaining effective, coherent and efficient<br />
securities regulation can be solved only if there is one<br />
nationally uniform body 6f law and a national authority<br />
which will eliminate the variation of administrative<br />
practice and interpretation and which will standardise<br />
the quality of administrative action and investigation.<br />
I mentioned the Terrigal Conference's statement<br />
on the mixed economy. Equally important for business<br />
is the decision to express a firmer commitment to economic<br />
planning. Planning is really about institutionalising<br />
foresight. It is a process which tempers expertise<br />
with judgment. We believe that the Australian Government<br />
should contain a department with the prime responsibility<br />
for planning the long term future of the economy. It<br />
should be staffed with experts, but advised by<br />
representatives of various community groups especially<br />
workers, employers and consumers. We considered, but<br />
rejected, the notion of a National Economic Council because<br />
although we believe that the views of community groups<br />
are an essential part of the planning process, we believe<br />
that ultimate power of decision must rest with the<br />
Parliament. The planning machinery we are creating is<br />
therefore advisory.<br />
Market forces, alone, are not good enough as<br />
indicators of the direction in which resources should flow.<br />
The market mechanism is there to be used, but it must not<br />
become the only influence determining how and where we<br />
allocate our resources. </p>
<p>We envisage a broadly based planning mechanism<br />
at its centre, the planning department with its advisory<br />
machinery; around it the other departments, but<br />
especially the industry departments, each with its own<br />
network of advisory bodies and panels. From this<br />
mixture of expertise, judgment, subjective opinion,<br />
and self-interest will come, I believe, the sort of<br />
advise which, when combined with the more objective data<br />
from the planning department, will enable the Government<br />
to appraise its long term goals with more certainty, more<br />
humanity and more efficiency than is possible at present.<br />
Our commitment to planning is not simply based on<br />
ideology not simply due to any mistrust of market forces.<br />
It stems from the interdependent nature of a good deal of<br />
economic decision-making. Much public investment has<br />
long lead time and it is difficult to undertake major<br />
development projects unless there is some certainty about<br />
the continued supply of funds and avoidance of ' stop-go'<br />
economic policies. The private sector, too, needs some clear view of<br />
the Government's long term operations with confidence.<br />
I envisage a fruitful, interactive planning environment<br />
with both public and private sectors playing their part.<br />
When we spekk of Australia's " mixed economy"<br />
let's be clear what we mean. Public and private<br />
sectors are mainly complementary, not competitive with<br />
each other. The aim of the major initiatives my<br />
Government has taken has been to build better structures,<br />
more modern structures upon which the whole community<br />
can propper. The private sector has a definite interest in<br />
the development of public infrastructure and ' the<br />
rational public regulation of private activity.<br />
Important initiatives in public investment will prove<br />
of great advantage to the private sector. I refer to<br />
our assumption of responsibility for national highways<br />
which are of such great importance in facilitating the<br />
movement of goods among our major markets. Another<br />
area of great long term interest for the private sector,<br />
is the improvement of the quality of our education system<br />
as a whole and particular major initiatives in areas of<br />
direct concern to private industry, such as the<br />
development of technical education. The private sector<br />
will also see advantages from the re-organisation of<br />
some major areas of public investment. I refer<br />
particularly to the establishment of two Commissions to<br />
conduct postal and telecommunication services. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
The Government has taken-new initiatives to<br />
facilitate trade relations with other countries. A<br />
large number of new trade agreements lave been sined.<br />
We have extended the charter of the Old Bxport Payments<br />
Insurance Corporation to create the Export Finance<br />
Insurance Corporation and we shall proceed to establish<br />
an Overseas Trade Corporation, to promote trade with<br />
centrally planned economies in particular. We have<br />
established new institutions to assist firms to adjust<br />
to the continuing pressures of change. Our Structural<br />
Adjustment Assistance Scheme is the first systematic<br />
effort to help industry adjust to changes of economic<br />
policy. The NEAT scheme is the first step in our<br />
continuing development of longer-run manpower policy.<br />
In a more specific area of housing, we have established a<br />
Housing Standards Advisory Council to eliminate the<br />
extraordinary cost disabilities of the multiplicity of<br />
housing codes. In all these ways I believe that public<br />
initiative is la)? ing the foundations for the future<br />
balanced development for the private sector.<br />
Far from these programs being antagonistic to<br />
the success of private endeavour or incompatible with<br />
private prosperity they are essential to it. A skilled,<br />
healthy, efficient community that is both our national<br />
goal and an economic necessity. In a speech last<br />
December Mr Gordon Jackson had this to say:<br />
" We should perhaps speculate that in a turbulent<br />
and uncertain world, a principal role of government<br />
should be to articulate a set of values that will find<br />
acceptance in the community. Acceptance will help to<br />
constrain the parts from antisocial and maladaptive<br />
behaviour and will encourage progress towards common<br />
ideals. The role of government also should be to<br />
simplify the business environment enough for people to<br />
understand the situation and the prospects, so they can<br />
plan with confidence." I<br />
I endorse thoserentarks.<br />
Effective planning needs new structures and new<br />
machinery, . We are building them. To articulate a<br />
set of values which will find acceptance in the community<br />
requires consultation. We are eager to have it.<br />
In the present situation of rapid change and uncertainty<br />
it is urgent that we should be able to apply ourselved<br />
all of us, government and business alike to these tasks.<br />
I won't labour the point I'll just leave you with this<br />
thought: In this critical time it would be tragic for Australia<br />
if over the next six months, our national preoccupations<br />
were to be purely political, if the national debate<br />
were to be conducted, not in terms of our greater goals<br />
and long term needs, but were to be forced into the<br />
narrow fcus of yet another election. </p>
