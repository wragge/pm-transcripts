PRIME MINISTER 22 FEBRUARY 1979
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
After surviving the rigours of the Queensland electoral<br />
redistribution affair, Federal Minister for Finance, Mr. Eric<br />
Robinson, stunned Parliament last night by resignina.<br />
No reasons have been given. Is understood Mr. Robinson told<br />
Party colleagues he could not longer qive the Prime Minister<br />
his unqualified suoport. Report from Geoff Duncan: " Behind<br />
the scenes all has not been well and the Fraser-Robinson<br />
relationship has deteriorated to its present finale. According<br />
to his supporters, Mr. Robinson felt that he had been shabbily<br />
treated by the Prime Minister when some 6 months ago he was<br />
hauled before the MacGregor Royal Commission to answer allegations<br />
of electoral boundary rigging. Further conflict developed over<br />
the role Mr. Robinson's Department of Finance was to play in<br />
giving alternative economic advice to Mr. Fraser. I understand<br />
that Mr. Robinson felt frustrated and out-manoeuvred by the<br />
seeming dominance of the Treasury and the Prime Minister's<br />
Department... . the crunch seems to have come when Mr. Robinson<br />
got wind that Mr. Fraser had done a deal with the National Party<br />
in Queensland which would ensure them Senate preference in the<br />
next election..."<br />
Sir William McMahon said he was not suprised at Mr. Robinson's<br />
resignation and that all backbench sympathy would be with<br />
Mr. Robinson. Sir William McMahon interviewed.<br />
Fighting is continuing on China-Vietnam border. Reported<br />
the Vietnamese are using American technology and American<br />
propoganda techniques. For the first time since the outbreak<br />
of fighting between China and Vietnam began, their representatives<br />
are being draw into diplomatic dialogue aimed at ending the<br />
conflict, likely to start tomorrow in the Security Council of the U. N.<br />
Federal Minister for Indust%. ry and Commerce, Mr. Lynch, last<br />
night announce'd the Government has accepted General Motors terms<br />
for establishiing a $ 210 million engine plant in Victoria.<br />
Federal opposition has mixed feelings about the plan. Labor<br />
Spokesman on Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr. Hurford,<br />
interviewed. Said he opposed the details of the decision but<br />
supports what motivated the decisions. N. S. W. Secretary of<br />
the Vehicle Worker's Union believes the decision is not only<br />
likely to cause unemployment but also to deprive Australia of<br />
irreplacable mechanical skills. Interviewed.<br />

time. 24-hour walk-out will1 affect a wide variety of services.<br />
The British Prime Minister is adamant that he won't yield to<br />
pressure. France: steel workers facing reduncancy are staging large<br />
scale demonstrations by occupying railway stations.<br />

time with the country going to the polls in one week.<br />
