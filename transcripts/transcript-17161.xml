    <content><![CDATA[<p>As part of delivering a National Health and Hospitals Network, the Rudd Government will invest $436 million to transform the way Australians with long term illness are treated.</p>
<p>This will begin with improving health outcomes for the nearly one million Australians living with diabetes - too many of whom end up being treated in hospitals.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Rudd Government will offer Australians with diabetes the option of signing up with a GP practice of their choice. This practice will:</p>
<p>     * become responsible for managing their care, including by developing a personalised care plan;</p>
<p>     * help organise access to the additional services they need, such as care from a dietician or physiotherapist, as set out in their personalised care plan;</p>
<p>     * be paid, in part, on the basis of their performance in keeping their patients healthy and out of hospital.</p>
<p>In 2007-08, around 237,000 hospital admissions were related to complications from diabetes that could have been avoided through better management.</p>
<p>This is 32 per cent of all avoidable hospital admissions.</p>
<p>With an estimated 2.2 million Australians with diabetes over the next decade, our health and hospitals system is not well placed to cope with future demand.</p>
<p>Patients with diabetes often need care from multiple health professionals, including GPs, specialist endocrinologists, dieticians and physiotherapists.</p>
<p>However, current funding arrangements are structured in a way that can lead to 'six minute medicine' and do not support coordination between services.</p>
<p>To rectify this, for the first time, Government funding will be able to be used by general practices flexibly to deliver the full range of services patients need.</p>
<p>This means a single practice will be responsible for ensuring that voluntarily enrolled patients are able to access services from a wide range of health professionals.</p>
<p>In addition, practices stand to be rewarded if their patients' health improves.</p>
<p>The Government will provide:</p>
<p>     * payments of around $1,200 a year on average for every enrolled patient - to cover the costs of day to day GP care and additional services.</p>
<p>     * payments of around $10,800 a year for the average general practice, paid in part on the basis of performance in providing better care and improving health outcomes.</p>
<p>The Government expects that:</p>
<p>     * more than 4,300 General Practices, covering around 60 per cent of all GPs, will sign-on to the program by 2012-13, its first year of operation.</p>
<p>     * approximately 260,000 patients with diabetes will be voluntarily enrolled in a personalised care program by 2013-14.</p>
<p>Providing patients with complex conditions with the option of enrolling with a single primary care service was recommended by both the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and the draft National Primary Care Strategy.</p>
<p>The Government will work with patient and health consumer representatives and key primary health care groups, including GPs and allied health providers, on detailed implementation arrangements for this policy.</p>
<p>Long term illnesses like diabetes represent a big and growing challenge for our health system.</p>
<p>These reforms mark the beginning of a new way of treating Australians with long term illness.</p>
<p>As the majority funder of our hospitals system, the Commonwealth will have an interest in ensuring that that Australians receive high quality care in the community.</p>
<p>This investment builds on the Government's $632 million investment in our medical workforce that will provide more than 6,000 additional doctors over the coming decade.</p>
<p>As the single government funder of GP and primary care services, the Government will continue to make investments that that deliver better health outcomes and take pressure off our hospitals.</p>
