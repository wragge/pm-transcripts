PRII4E MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE,-<br />
BONN, 17 JANUA RY, 1975<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen; On behalf of the Chairman of the<br />
Bundespressekonferenz and on behalf of the Federal Press Office,<br />
it ismy personal honour and my privilege to present to you,<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Whitlam.<br />
Mr. Whitlam:<br />
Q. Did you have an appointment with Mr. brezhnev in Moscow?<br />
If you did, could you say what * was discussed? If not,<br />
were you given any explanation why not?<br />
A. No appointment with Mr. Brezhnev had been arranged.<br />
Each day there was a message given to me from Mr. Brezhnev.<br />
I was told on the second day that he had a cold and was<br />
out of towvn.<br />
Q. Following your talkcs with the Soviet leaders, what prospects<br />
do you feel there are for a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean?<br />
A. The Soviet leaders state that they would like a zone of peace<br />
in the Indian Ocean. They also add that they would like a<br />
zone of peace in every one of the world's oceans. You will<br />
know that Australia and, I believe, every other country<br />
around the IndianOcean has voted at the United Nations General<br />
Assembly in favour of such proposals which have come,<br />
originally, from Sri Lanka and Malaysia, and more recently<br />
from Pakistan and Iran. There might have been other sources<br />
as well.<br />
Q. Inaudible question but referred to the Prime Minjtster' s<br />
attitude to the United States' use of Diego Garcia as a base<br />
in the Indian Ocean?.....<br />
A. Australia, like every other country bordering the Indian Ocean<br />
or situated in the Indian Ocean, has objected to the developmenft<br />
of Diego Garcia. Australia and, I believe, every other<br />
country in the Indian Ocean and around it, has deplored the<br />
possibility of an increase in forces by the two Super Powers<br />
the United States and the Soviet Union. They have all sought<br />
to eliminate any possibility of confrontation between them.<br />
Some of you mightn't be aware that I was asked a question<br />
previously on this by an Australian correspondent who would<br />
have hadf the text. But, of course, the correspondent who<br />
just asked this question and others too might not have the<br />
text of the Communique which 11r. Kosygin and I issued yesterday<br />
on this subject. It states: " Both sides express their<br />
readiness to participate together with all interested States<br />
on an equal basis in seeking a favourable solution to the<br />
problem of making the Indian Ocean an area of peace in<br />
accordance with the principles of international law." 1<br />

Q. Do you believe the assurances given to you by Mr. Kosygin<br />
that Russia does not have any bases in the Indian. Ocean?<br />
A. Mr. Kosygin did state that and I have no comment to make<br />
on it.<br />
Q. This morning you had a talk with the Federal Chancellor.<br />
Did you discuss economic problems and particularly the<br />
question of Australia's supply of uranium to the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany?<br />
A. The Bundeskanzler and I discussed many economic matters.<br />
Obviously, Germany's economic experience is of great<br />
significance to any western country because the Federal<br />
Republic's success has been by far the greatest, economically,<br />
of all western countries. Wie did discuss the supply of<br />
uranium to European countries. Also, of course, we<br />
discussed the supply of beef to European countries. We<br />
discussed the general question of what commodities,<br />
primary and mineral, can be supplied by Australia to<br />
European * countries and the general terms on which such<br />
supplies could take place. This was. the * seventh visit<br />
that my colleagues and I have made to member countries<br />
of the European Economic Community. In each case we have<br />
found some embarrassment over the fact that the Community,<br />
a pursuant to the has cut off imports of meat<br />
from Australia. Nobody has justified that exclusion of<br />
Australian meat from the European Market. It is true,<br />
we haven't visited Denmark and Luxembourg. We don't know<br />
thei~ r views. It is possible that Luxembourg and Denmark<br />
control the C. A. P. In every country, however, we did find<br />
a very great interest in the supply of uranium and coal<br />
because the Community requires energy sources. Australia<br />
has considerable energy sources. Australians, quite<br />
legitimately I believe, want to develop those ' energy sources<br />
as far as possible in their own country. So, quite clearly,<br />
there were many matters that we were able to discussv<br />
the Bundeskanzler and I. We didn't get around to another<br />
subject which I suppose would be of interest here. I'm<br />
told there is not enough sugar available for consumption<br />
in the Community. Australia would be able to supply sugar.<br />
to theCommunity. ] But, in this case, the Community says:<br />
" Oh no, we'll increase the production of our own sugar."<br />
The wonders of the C. A. P. never cease to amaze me.<br />
Q. While you were in Moscow, Prime Mi nister, the trade Agreement<br />
between the U. S. and the Soviet Union was ' cancelled by the<br />
Soviet Union. Would you consider this to be a fundamental<br />
change of course on the part of Soviet policy or would you<br />
consider this to be a kind of temporary embarrassment?<br />
A. I do not believe that this represents any fundamental change<br />
of course by the Soviet Union at all. The whole of this<br />
question was discussed with us by Mr. Kosygin on Tuesday<br />
afternoon. He stressed both before, during, and after the<br />
discussions of this item, that the Soviet Union was committed<br />
to reinforcing the policy of detente with United States<br />
and, in fact, between all countries. I am confident that </p>
<p>-3<br />
that is settled Soviet policy. At the same time, it was<br />
quite clear to us that the Soviet Union would not accept<br />
the Jackson Amendment which the United States Senate<br />
attached to the Administration Agreement between the<br />
United States and the Soviet Union. To use an Australian<br />
. phrase; it was clear to us last Tuesday afternoon, that<br />
the Soviet Union would not cop this amendment.<br />
Q. During your discussions with Herr Schmidt this morning,<br />
were any other problems discussed?<br />
A. There were some political or diplomatic matters which we<br />
discussed of interest to our two countries, of course.<br />
Q. Did you get the impression that reports of Mr. Brezhnev's<br />
illness were a sign of a power realignment in the Kremlin<br />
were inaccurate, or did you see some signs indicating that<br />
they were correct?<br />
A. I am not going to speculate on such matters. I've already<br />
told you all I know.<br />
Q. As a result of your visit to West Ger'many,, will we now see<br />
increased uranium exports to West Germany?<br />
A. We've never made any exports to West Germany yet and I don't<br />
believe that West Germany has sought to buy any uranium.<br />
But,-in March or maybe at the end of February, there will<br />
be a visit by British and very likely associated Dutch and<br />
German officials to Australia to discuss this question of<br />
enrichment of Australian uranium in Australia. This is.<br />
pursuant to an arrangement which was made between Australia<br />
and Japan in November for a feasibility study Into this<br />
very question.<br />
I have just been reminded by our Staatssekretdr fUr<br />
Nineralien und Energie that there have been some approaches<br />
by German companies to buy uranium from Australia. But no<br />
sales have been made. That is, no contracts were made<br />
under the earlier Australian Government or by the present<br />
Government.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, Bonn marks the end of your European visit.<br />
Summing up, Sir, what do you think you have achieved in<br />
the various countries? Has there been one point of interest<br />
that Europeans Leaders collectively have had in Australia?<br />
A. This has been my first visit to the Federal Republic as<br />
Prime Minister and, except for a visit I made some 20 months<br />
ago to Britain, it has been the first visit I have made<br />
as Prime Minister to ten European countries. My colleague,<br />
Mr. Lionel Bowen, who, as you know, i's the Mi. nister assisting<br />
the Prime Minister, also visited Malta while I had to go<br />
back to Australia in connection with the Darwin cyclone<br />
disaster. In the eleven countries we haye visited, there<br />
has been a more comprehensive and thorough presentation<br />
of the Australian point of view than has ever taken place<br />
at any time in the past. it is . very clear to us in each<br />
/ 4) </p>
<p>-4-<br />
country that by making a comprehensive visit of this<br />
character the interest in every country was enhanced in<br />
every case. There was anticipation and review of what<br />
we had done already in the earlier visits or that we<br />
would be doing in the visits which still had to take<br />
place. There can be no question that by making a<br />
comprehensive visit of this character at Head of<br />
Government level, one achieves a concentration of interest<br />
in evory cuuntry viaite,. . ln e. vory case, ( if' c: ourse, we<br />
have visited the Head of State, the Head of Government,<br />
and senior Ministers and senior Secretary-Gencrals and<br />
Director-Generals, and it is quite clear to us that<br />
Australia means inr It's more significant, to eacl<br />
of these countriet. than was the case before.. Wie are,<br />
of course, very appreciative of the reception we Lave<br />
had in each case, but we believe Australia now is known<br />
and understood better than had ever been the case before.<br />
" Thank you very much, Prime MLinister. </p>
