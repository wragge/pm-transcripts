    <content><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I were saddened to learn of the death on Boxing Day of a former colleague and distinguished Australian, the Hon John McLeay.  He was 78.  </p>
<p>Mr McLeay enlisted in the AIF in 1941 and served in New Guinea as a Gunner with 13 Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery from 1942 – 1943.</p>
<p>Like his father before him, the late Sir John McLeay, Mr McLeay held the federal seat of Boothby in South Australia for the Liberal Party.  He was first elected in 1966 and held the seat until he retired from Parliament in 1981.  (Sir John McLeay held the seat of Boothby from 1949 – 1966.)</p>
<p>John McLeay and I served together as Ministers in the Fraser Government.</p>
<p>During his federal parliamentary career, he was Assistant Minister Assisting the Minister for Civil Aviation from 1971-1972 in the McMahon Government and then Minister for Construction (1975 – 1978), Minister for Administrative Services (1978 – 1980) and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (1975 –1980) in the Fraser Government.</p>
<p>After he retired from Parliament in 1981, he was appointed Australia’s Consul-General in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Before entering federal Parliament in 1966, John McLeay was a prominent South Australian businessman and Local Government identity, serving the Unley City Council from 1949.  He was Mayor, Unley City Council from 1961 – 1963.  </p>
<p>John McLeay has given distinguished service to his country at the local, national and international levels.  He devoted most of his adult life to the cause of the Liberal Party of Australia.</p>
<p>To his wife, Clythe, his three sons, Travis, Robin and Digby, and their families I extend our deepest sympathies.</p>
<p>A State funeral will be held later with details to be advised separately.<br />
27 December 2000</p>
