FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 102/ 1972<br />
PUBLIC ACCESS TO GARDEN ISLAND<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William I-c7ahon, CH, MP.<br />
and the Premier of Western Australia,<br />
the Hon. J. T. Tonkin, i2. L. A.<br />
Agreement in principle has been reached between the<br />
Commonwealth and the Western Australian Governments on an outline<br />
of arrangements for public access to Garden Island after the Naval<br />
Facility is completed in 1975.<br />
It will be recalled the Prime M4inister announced in May<br />
that it was intended about iCOO acres and 10 miles of beaches on<br />
the Island would continue to be available to the public.<br />
Agreement has also bcen reached in principle on the<br />
State Government's proposal to transfer the Explosives Depot from<br />
Woodman Point to a location adjacent to the Naval Armament Depot<br />
on Garden Island. This would free the area currently occupied by<br />
the State Depot at Woodman Point for inclusion in the State's plan<br />
for development of tourist facilities in that area.<br />
The location of the State Explosive Depot on the Island<br />
will marginally reduce the area available for public access.<br />
However, apart from the restricted areas associated with the<br />
Armament and Explosives Depots, and the areas envisaged for the<br />
Naval facilities, it is intended that the remainder of the Island<br />
be made available for use by the public.<br />
The respective areas are delineated on the attached<br />
map. Transport to the Island will continue to be mainly by<br />
the present means of small craft on a daily basis only. Access<br />
to the beaches is the major public attraction. In the overall<br />
interests of preservation of the ecology and flora and fauna,<br />
access to the inland areas will be limnitod to designated<br />
walking trails. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The State plans to establish limited tourist<br />
facilities to the south of the historical area at Cliff Head<br />
and it is proposed that visits by approvc tourist buses to this<br />
area be permitted. The possibility of the State erecting a<br />
tourist jetty near Cliff Head is also to be explored.<br />
A detailed plan of management will now be drawn up for<br />
approval by the Commonwealth and State Govern-ments subject to<br />
the resolution of certain financial and legal aspects.<br />
In concluding the arrangements for public access,<br />
special provisions will be necessary and will be incorporated<br />
for the protection of the flora and fauna and the sensitive<br />
ecology of the Island generally. Due recognition must be given<br />
to the security of the Naval facilities and p~ ossible future Naval<br />
expansion. The Prime *:;. inister and the Premier both expressed<br />
gratification tE. hat there is now every expectation that thc<br />
arrangements worked out will, as well as meeting the defence<br />
needs of the Navy, also meet the interests of the people of<br />
Western Australia who wish to continuo to enjoy the various<br />
attractions of this area.<br />
