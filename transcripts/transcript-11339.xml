    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Joe. To Dick Humphrey, Maurice Newman, Alan</p>
<p> Cameron, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be here today. I was remarking to Maurice Newman</p>
<p> that it has been reasonably busy day. I started off in court in a</p>
<p> ceremony to mark the 175th anniversary of the Supreme Court</p>
<p> of New South Wales. I have just come from a rather more somber occasion,</p>
<p> a State Funeral for a former Premier of New South Wales at St James'</p>
<p> and now, I guess, I am paying homage to mammon by coming to the Stock</p>
<p> Exchange to launch this very important initiative.</p>
<p>As I am sure all of you know, amongst the many things that we have</p>
<p> sought to do as a Government is to promote Australia and as Prime</p>
<p> Minister of the entire country I talk generically but to promote Australia</p>
<p> as a centre for...global centre for financial services. We used</p>
<p> to, as Joe said, talk about it as a regional financial centre but</p>
<p> it is important to see Australia's potential as a global centre</p>
<p> for financial services.</p>
<p>And I am announcing today a number of important new initiatives and</p>
<p> not least of those is the establishment of the International Financial</p>
<p> Centre Taskforce that will ensure major participation in the quest</p>
<p> for Australia's status as a global financial centre very important</p>
<p> and valuable private sector involvement. This taskforce will be headed</p>
<p> by an executive chosen from the private sector with particular knowledge</p>
<p> of what is needed and the energy required to remove the barriers and</p>
<p> the impediments that now stand in the way of us realising our goal</p>
<p> of Australia becoming such a centre.</p>
<p>We are going to do a number of things apart from establishing the</p>
<p> taskforce which will be based here in Sydney in the central business</p>
<p> district. We are going to reopen Treasury's regional office in</p>
<p> Singapore. There will be a leading role for Joe Hockey, the Minister</p>
<p> for Financial Services and Regulation, as well as continuing his normal</p>
<p> ministerial duties, he will have responsibility as a roving ambassador</p>
<p> for me and for the Government to promote Australia as a centre for</p>
<p> global financial services. We are also going to establish a new committee</p>
<p> of regulators comprising the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, APRA, ASIC,</p>
<p> the ACCC and the Australian Taxation Office. We are going to improve</p>
<p> data collection to benchmark Australia's performance.</p>
<p>Now, our strategy to promote Australia as a world financial centre</p>
<p> is based on the belief that this country offers attractions that few</p>
<p> countries in the world can offer. First and foremost, we have a stable</p>
<p> economy. We have an economy that last year grew stronger than any</p>
<p> economy in the industrialised world. We have a strong, stable, well-supervised</p>
<p> and prudently regulated banking system. We have a clear coherent body</p>
<p> of law. We have sound traditions and principles of corporate governance.</p>
<p> And one of the fascinating things about economic debate in this country</p>
<p> and around the world in recent times is how some things that were</p>
<p> a few short years ago seen almost as impediments to Australia aspiring</p>
<p> to what we are about today are now seen as some of our greatest strengths.</p>
<p> I can even recall some businessmen a few years ago saying that we</p>
<p> were too stodgy, that our banking system perhaps was a little too</p>
<p> conservative, that maybe we should adopt the Malaysian model for promoting</p>
<p> investment, that maybe we should adopt this or that approach. Now,</p>
<p> of course, those very apparent signs of stodginess are seen as some</p>
<p> of the greatest strengths that this country has. Perhaps what some</p>
<p> would call our very conservatism in the approach of many of our financial</p>
<p> institutions, that is now seen as having been one of the virtues of</p>
<p> this country over the last few years and one of the reasons why we</p>
<p> have been able to stare down the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>As Joe said, over the last few years the Government has carried out</p>
<p> a number of major economic reforms which have helped deliver the strongest</p>
<p> Australian economy in 30 years, the lowest interest rates, the lowest</p>
<p> levels of inflation, significant rises in real incomes, all of which</p>
<p> have combined to give to this country in a general sense a level of</p>
<p> affluence and prosperity that we haven't seen since the late</p>
<p> 1960s. And as I have said on many occasions the challenge of economic</p>
<p> reform in a globalised economy never disappears. We are where we are</p>
<p> now, the strength of today is the product of yesterday's reform</p>
<p> and the strength of tomorrow will be the product of today's reform.</p>
<p>And that, of course, brings me to the issue of taxation reform. Any</p>
<p> hope we have of making Australia a global financial centre will be</p>
<p> gravely threatened, if not totally destroyed, unless we can get fundamental</p>
<p> taxation reform. And one of the prices that this country will pay</p>
<p> years into the future if we don't have fundamental tax reform</p>
<p> is that we'll be denying the opportunity of capitalising on those</p>
<p> fundamental strengths of which I spoke a few moments ago. We do have</p>
<p> taxation laws at the moment which discourage the further promotion</p>
<p> of Australia as a financial centre. And one of the reasons for tax</p>
<p> reform is to get rid of the financial institutions duty, to get rid</p>
<p> of the bank account debits tax, to get rid of the tax on share transactions,</p>
<p> to reform our capital gains tax system, to replace the ramshackle,</p>
<p> out of date wholesale tax system with a modern internationally competitive,</p>
<p> broad based indirect tax. All of those reforms together will further</p>
<p> promote and add to the other strengths that Australia has and the</p>
<p> other appeal that Australia has as a world financial centre.</p>
<p>It's been one of my goals and it's been a goal of the Treasurer</p>
<p> since we're elected to office a little over three years ago,</p>
<p> to capitalise on the fundamental strengths that we have. A strong</p>
<p> economy, a stable political system, English is our national language,</p>
<p> strong rules, clear rules of corporate governance and a well regulated</p>
<p> financial system. They are all massive generic assets. But on top</p>
<p> of that you've got to look over the horizon and you've got</p>
<p> to grab hold of all of those things additionally that you can do to</p>
<p> make this country more attractive as a financial centre. And one of</p>
<p> those, of course, is fundamental taxation reform. And that's</p>
<p> why we went to the last election, spelling out in detail what we were</p>
<p> going to do. It's why we told the truth to the Australian people</p>
<p> at the last election about what we were going to do and it's</p>
<p> why there are many Australians at the present time who are angry beyond</p>
<p> belief that a government had the honesty and the candor to spell out</p>
<p> in detail what it intended to do and did not intend, try to slide</p>
<p> back into office on the basis of a generalised commitment to taxation</p>
<p> reform, but actually spelt it out in detail. And when you have gone</p>
<p> through that and you have won the election, and then you are told</p>
<p> by people, who themselves, did not spell out in detail before they</p>
<p> were elected what they wanted to do with the taxation system, you</p>
<p> begin to ask some fundamental questions about how effectively our</p>
<p> parliamentary system is operating. In all of the years I have been</p>
<p> in politics one of the constant complaints I have received is that</p>
<p> politicians don't tell the truth. They say that they won't</p>
<p> tell you what they are going to do or when they do tell you what they</p>
<p> are going to do, they change it after they have been elected. Well</p>
<p> in 1998 we told the public what we were going to do on tax. We haven't</p>
<p> tried to change it after we were elected. We are in fact trying to</p>
<p> implement what we promised the Australian people we were going to</p>
<p> do.</p>
<p>And I certainly as Prime Minister and all the members of my Government</p>
<p> believe that what is now occurring through the refusal of the Senate</p>
<p> to honour the mandate we were given not only calls into question the</p>
<p> proper processes of our parliamentary system but of course it will</p>
<p> do incalculable damage to the Australian economy in the future. We</p>
<p> can be an even stronger more effective nation economically. We can</p>
<p> become a world financial centre. We can continue to deliver higher</p>
<p> living standards to the Australian people, but we can't do that</p>
<p> without continued reform. We badly need taxation reform. It is the</p>
<p> greatest piece of unfinished economic business on the Australian economic</p>
<p> and political landscape at the present time. And it is urgent in the</p>
<p> national interest that that be implemented. And our strategy to make</p>
<p> Australia a global financial centre will be undermined if we cannot</p>
<p> achieve financial reform.</p>
<p>Can I say in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, that I appreciate enormously</p>
<p> the opportunity that the exchange has given us to launch the details</p>
<p> of these new initiatives today and to give me an opportunity to outline</p>
<p> some of the goals that the government has in mind in this area. We</p>
<p> are very strongly committed and we do believe that this country can</p>
<p> become an international financial centre because it has assets that</p>
<p> other centres don't have and on top of that if we have the courage</p>
<p> and capacity as a community to make necessary future reforms to the</p>
<p> Australian economy then that goal can be realised.</p>
<p>Can I very warmly commend to you the work that Joe has done as the</p>
<p> Minister responsible for financial services since his appointment</p>
<p> to that position in October of last year. He will have a very active</p>
<p> and visible role in relation to achieving the goal of making Australia</p>
<p> a financial centre. He will work very closely of course with the taskforce.</p>
<p> He will be reporting directly to me as well as to the Treasurer regarding</p>
<p> the activities of the taskforce. And I see him as having a very active</p>
<p> part to play as a roving ambassador promoting the cause of this country</p>
<p> as a world financial centre.</p>
<p>Can I just say once again, ladies and gentlemen, that we do have enormous</p>
<p> opportunities at the present juncture in our economic and political</p>
<p> history. We do have the strongest set of economic fundamentals, far</p>
<p> stronger than many of us thought possible, even our more optimistic</p>
<p> moments a few years ago. And we have the capacity to continue with</p>
<p> that strength if we have the will and the application as a nation</p>
<p> to undertake further reforms. Doing well in a globalised economy is</p>
<p> a race that never finishes and it's not sufficient to look back</p>
<p> and say well we're doing better than we did thirty years ago,</p>
<p> we have to do better than our current day competitors if we are to</p>
<p> continue to stay in front of that race. And Australia has been doing</p>
<p> that over the last few years, we can continue to do that but only</p>
<p> if we have a capacity and a willingness as a people to embrace the</p>
<p> further necessary reforms, including taxation reform, which will maintain</p>
<p> into the future the edge that we currently have over so many other</p>
<p> countries and so many other competitors around the world.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
