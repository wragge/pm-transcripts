FROM: Australian Mission to United Nations,<br />
NEW YORK. UN1109 UNCLASSIFIED<br />
Repeated Washington 1298.<br />
Following is outline of the Prime Minister's<br />
speech introducing amendment to the Five Power Resolution on<br />
Khrushchev and Eisenhower contacts this morning:<br />
2. Australia dissented from only the final paragraph<br />
of the Five Power Resolution believing that, if carried, its<br />
effect would be undesirable. Sukarno had had reservations<br />
even about a Pour Power Summit Conference but had finally<br />
moved resolution requiring not four leaders but two to renew<br />
contacts. Many millions of people had hoped that the Summit<br />
Conference in Paris might serve to create some atmosphere of hope<br />
and settlement of some problems including Nuclear Tests Treaty.<br />
But the Summit failed even to begin because the Soviet leader<br />
would not participate. The other leaders had then expressed<br />
willingness to take part in negotiations at any suitable time<br />
in the future. This was a fair and good tempered proposition<br />
and tenacious in the cause of peace. If talks were now to<br />
proceed why should we, by carrying the Five Nation Resolution,<br />
dismiss the United Kingdom and France from the first act.<br />
3. Mr. Nehru had frankly stated that there were serious<br />
limitations to the usefulness of bilateral talks. Was there<br />
any reason to think that Eisenhower was in some way the stumbling<br />
S block and that he should therefore be the one leader of the<br />
West to be brought under persuasion or pressure? He was in<br />
fact passionately devoted to peace. Moreover it was a well<br />
known Communist technique to seek to describe the drama of the<br />
Y7orld's problems in terms of antagonism between the United<br />
States and the Soviet Union alone. It was a dangerous fallacy<br />
to regard others as insignificant or at least uninterested onlookers.<br />
The real conflict was between authoritarian Communism<br />
and systems of Free Government. To narrow the issue down<br />
( by excluding France and Britain) to discussions by the leaders<br />
of two Governments was to put the world problem out of<br />
perspective., this was the reason for Australia's amendment.<br />
4. Australia believed that Summit Talks should be<br />
resumed but recognized that they could not be arranged quickly<br />
and doubted whether they should be rushed. A meeting of<br />
the Four could not solve all or many of our problems. Some<br />
great matters, within the responsibility of the United Nations,<br />
could not be delegated to a few but some have been recognized<br />
by all to be in a special way the concern of the Four Powers.<br />
They could also make a beginning on matters of wider concern<br />
such as disarmament. Moreover in practice the events of<br />
the last four days raised a doubt whether there was a genuine / r<br />
