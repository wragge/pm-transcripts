FOR MEDIA 16 MARCH 1990<br />
I deeply regret the execution in Iraq of the British-h~ sed<br />
Journalist, Mr Farzad Bazoft.<br />
Like other members of the world community, I sent a personal<br />
message to President Saddam Hussein, asking him to exercise<br />
clemency in this case. I am deeply disappointed that my<br />
appeal and those from so many other quarters were ignored by<br />
the Iraqi Government.<br />
Australia has a consistent and universal policy of<br />
opposition to the death penalty, which we regard as a<br />
fundamental violation of human rights. </p>
