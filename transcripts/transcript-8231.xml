TRANSCRIPT OF NE~ WS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 11<br />
DECEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you put Mr Keating on notice at all,<br />
Mr Hawke, at yesterday's talks? If he transgresses again will<br />
you move against him?<br />
PM: No, I didn't put him on notice.<br />
JOURNALIST: Don't you think that that would have been a good<br />
idea? PM: Not necessary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why not?<br />
PM: Because I believe what Mr Keating has said to me. He<br />
believes what I've said to him and I have the clear view now,<br />
as a result of what was a fairly lengthy conversation, that<br />
what has been I think the most effective political partnership<br />
in post-war politics will continue in the period ahead to be<br />
effective. JOURNALIST: Who do you think was the guilty party, the media<br />
or Mr Keating?<br />
PM: I'm not concerned with allocating guilt. I accept what<br />
Paul said to me that he was under very considerable emotional<br />
strain as a result of the sudden death of not only his<br />
colleague and adviser but friend, Chris Higgins. He was under<br />
a strain imposed by that event. I accept that.<br />
JOURNALIST: There was harm. You said so in the statement<br />
last night.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now where did most of that harm fall?<br />
PM: Well I think basically on the Government because I'm<br />
always concerned if there is harm to the Government I move<br />
quickly to try arnd isolate that, limit it. I think I've done<br />
that. JOURNALIST: Do -you think the Government is looking a bit<br />
ragged just nine months after you won the election<br />
PM: No I don't think it's looking ragged. There is, I mean<br />
I'm not stupid and saying that this hasn't had an adverse </p>
<p>impact. It would've, but I think not a lasting one. We've<br />
had the capacity to sit down as two intelligent and committed<br />
individuals and discuss the issues directly and I think with a<br />
great degree of frankness. We'll go about our business now of<br />
conducting the, as far as Paul's concerned, particularly the<br />
economic policy, he and I together there and as far as the<br />
Government more generally is concerned I, with my other<br />
colleagues, doing those things which are necessary to meet the<br />
challenges confronting this country. I believe that there is<br />
a very clear distinction which is apparent and will become<br />
increasingly apparent as we go through the life of this<br />
Parliament between the precision and the relevance that we<br />
have to offer in policy terms and as we described it in that<br />
brief statement regressive, irrelevant prescriptions of the<br />
Opposition. In the end, as you know you've heard me now year<br />
after year after year and many of you with varying degrees of<br />
reluctance have heard me say it, and reluctance to accept the<br />
accuracy of what: I've said but it's remained true and it<br />
remains true now, that in the end the Australian people are<br />
going to make decisions on the basis of who has got the best<br />
capacity to govern them, to look after their economic<br />
interests. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that when we<br />
go to the next election the judgement will be, as it should<br />
be, that whatever qualifications the people will have had<br />
about some of the things we have done that in terms of<br />
relevant and competent economic management Labor under Hawke<br />
has got the best answers.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Calm down.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there is concern that if you go<br />
to the next election saying that you will step down some time<br />
in the next term that you will appear as a lame duck candidate<br />
PM: Well under pressure from<br />
JOURNALIST: that you will harm Labor's chances<br />
PM: Ok, I've got your question. I'm a little bit surprised<br />
that it was asked actually. Under pressure from various of my<br />
colleagues, which has built up over some time now and<br />
particularly since I made that statement, I have revisited the<br />
issue, if I may put it that way, and I now make it clear that<br />
I will lead the ' Party to the next election and with the<br />
intention of going through that term while I retain the<br />
keenness towards the job and the fitness for it that I do now.<br />
That's what my colleagues feel should be the case. I'm<br />
persuaded by them and that is a statement of my position.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just calm down. There's plenty of time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is t: hat an absolute commitment or are you giving<br />
some qualification there and secondly<br />
PM: No. It's an absolute commitment we'll take the second<br />
in a moment it's an absolute commitment that I will lead the </p>
<p>Party into the next election with the intention of leading the<br />
Party through the whole of that term.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you tell Mr Keating and what was his<br />
response? PM: Mr Keating is aware of my position and I don't intend to<br />
go into all the details of our conversation. But Mr Keating<br />
is aware of that position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you that with him yesterday?<br />
PM: Mr Keating is aware of my position.<br />
JOURNALIST: did he accept it?<br />
PM: I think he accepts it, yes. There was no indication that<br />
he doesn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did he give you any indication that he might<br />
leave? PM: No. The understanding that I have is that Mr Keating<br />
intends to stay.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you would not lead the Party to election<br />
number six, you'd stay up to the point of that election? Is<br />
that PM: Well, I meana, a lot of people have had sort of<br />
intimations of mortality over recent times and, I mean, one<br />
can't go on forever and ever. But my intention would be to go<br />
the whole of the next term and well let's see the position<br />
then. JOURNALIST: Two more elections.<br />
PM: I am saying that, and I don't think it's a very<br />
complicated answer that I've given, I mean we really are<br />
getting to the navel gazing stage. Let me repeat it; I will<br />
lead the Party to the next election with the intention of<br />
leading them through the whole of that next period. Now<br />
that's a fair period of time. I'm giving my commitment you<br />
see for now some five years. Now by any reasonable<br />
expectation that's all I need to give at this stage. I don't<br />
intend to say anything more about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is iLt reasonable, Mr Hawke, to expect Mr Keating<br />
to postpone his own leadership ambitions for that period of<br />
time? PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is Mr Keating still your preferred<br />
successor when you do step down?<br />
PM: As I've said before the decision is for the Caucus to<br />
take but yes, as far as I'm concerned, I think he's best<br />
equipped to follow me. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: In your talks with Mr Keating yesterday did he<br />
retract a single word of what he said on Friday night?<br />
PM: Yes there was a lot of retraction of things that had been<br />
conveyed. I'm not going through all of those. He was very<br />
spontaneous, and early in the piece, with his apology and I<br />
accepted it. I think you know me now after a pretty long<br />
period in public life I'm not, as distinct from some other<br />
people, one who carries bitternesses because I regard<br />
bitterness and jealousy as a most corrosive element in life,<br />
in personal and public life. I've always had that belief and<br />
I adhere to it now. I appreciated the fact that Paul<br />
understood the hurt and the damage that had been caused and he<br />
apologised unreservedly and I accepted it.<br />
JOURNALIST: So, in fact, he did apologise for what he said.<br />
Did he accept the responsibility<br />
PM: He accepted responsibility, yes, that's quite clear. I<br />
mean, really you are trying to<br />
JOURNALIST: I don't think it is, Mr Hawke<br />
PM: It is to me. I would've thought that the language is<br />
quite straightforward. I've given the positive answer to the<br />
questions twice already.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H~ awke, three and a half hours is rather a long<br />
time just to say sorry.<br />
PM: Well who said, I mean, with respect to you that's an<br />
absurd observation and you, by the grin on your face know that<br />
it was an absurd proposition. I mean, we didn't spend the<br />
time only with thie making of an apology and an acceptance of<br />
it. We had a lot of things to talk about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was there any discussion, Mr Hawke, of a change<br />
__ of portfolio at all for Mr Keating either now or sometime in<br />
Wthe future leading up to that transition to leadership?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: remain as Treasurer for the five years<br />
PM: My position is this; that I said after the last election<br />
I offered Paul would he like to do something else and this<br />
is not something new I'm saying, you know I've said that<br />
before. And he -took the view that he wanted to keep the<br />
Treasurership, a position and the view which I not only<br />
understood but appreciated and gladly accepted. My position<br />
would be that if at any stage Paul believed that he would<br />
prefer to have another portfolio then he would have that<br />
right. I mean, -the position of the Deputy Prime Minister is<br />
that they should have their choice of portfolio. They don't<br />
automatically, and I'm talking now historically, automatically<br />
get what they would nominate but they do have the right to<br />
nominate the portfolio they would like. And as far as Paul's<br />
concerned I believe he has that right, not only as Deputy<br />
Prime Minister but given the period of time that he's served.<br />
If he should make the judgement that he would prefer to have<br />
another portfolio experience then, of course, I would </p>
<p>accommodate him. But, I mean, please don't beat that up, I<br />
mean, it was not an issue of discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said I think only two weeks ago to<br />
Howard Sattler that you wouldn't like to fight two more<br />
elections. Can you explain exactly why you've had this change<br />
of heart?<br />
PM: Well I've had put to me by a range of people within the<br />
Parliamentary Party and outside it that that's not<br />
satisfactory for, the reason, they want me to be there<br />
longer than that: and that they would think that that would<br />
be a politically somewhat difficult position or one that could<br />
be exploited so it's said by some that people wouldn't<br />
know who they were voting for after me at that election. So<br />
on the basis tha~ t I feel remarkably fit physically, mentally<br />
alert and as keE. n on the job as I've ever been I have<br />
responded to tho'se observations. Those are the reasons.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just a minute, calm down.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you expressed the view that<br />
people might vot~ e for you and not for Keating.<br />
PM: Well by some people that was put. I mean, it would<br />
obviously be absurd for me to deny that some people didn't say<br />
that, some were saying that. But it was not just that point.<br />
They were saying; well if you go into an election and say yes<br />
but I'm going in the middle well they're not quite sure what's<br />
going to happen after that, they want to vote for you and they<br />
want to know that that's what they're voting for for that<br />
period. I understand that's a reasonable point of view. I've<br />
responded to it.<br />
O cJlOoUsReNrAL ItSoT : t he Mrn exHta wkeel, e ctdio onyo uw haatl sow ouulndd ebret akien ttoh e ebveasltuate<br />
interests of the Labor Party electorally? Your staying or<br />
going? PM: Well that's always open to anyone, not just me. My<br />
assessment, if I may say so modestly, is both now and I'm sure<br />
it would be at that time, that the Labor Party's best chances<br />
of re-election are with myself as leader.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you indicate to Mr Keating prior to<br />
his speech on Friday night your change in thinking on this<br />
matter or did you tell him yesterday?<br />
PM: In regard to going on? No I hadn't specifically had a<br />
conversation with him about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So yesterday was the first time he knew of your<br />
changed view on that matter?<br />
PM: I would think that would be so. Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: In -your talks with Mr Keating yesterday did he<br />
convey any suggestion that he might leave politics this term? </p>
<p>PM: No. I have two constraints on talking about this.<br />
as you know, I don't want to go into all the details of a<br />
personal conversation, there was a great deal covered. I<br />
think it's fair to say no, that the overwhelming conviction he<br />
left me with is that he would want to stay on this term.<br />
JOURNALIST: But did he leave this open though? Did he leave<br />
this open?<br />
PM: No he hasn't really left it open. His answer to me is<br />
that he would stay the term.<br />
JOURNALIST: If M1r Keating hadn't apologised would you have<br />
sacked him?<br />
PM: That's a real hypothetical, isn't it?<br />
. expJeOcUtR NALIST: What about next term Mr Keating. Do you<br />
him stay next term?<br />
PM: I would think so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he indicated that?<br />
PM: Well there's no we didn't go into that period. I mean,<br />
the immediately relevant position, as far as he was concerned,<br />
was this term and I understand he'll stay this term.<br />
JOURNALIST: He must've been a bit surprised by your change of<br />
heart from only two weeks ago. Surely he had a response.<br />
PM: Well I have nothing on which to base an assessment about<br />
the period after that other than to say it's my hope that he<br />
hope and my expectation that he would.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mr Keating tell you that he'd like to see you<br />
stand down as Prime Minister this term?<br />
O PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you in fact tell the Treasurer yesterday<br />
about your plan 1to stay on or did he learn about this today?<br />
PM: It would've been evident from the conversation that we<br />
were having yestE-rday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the Treasurer wise to make that speech even<br />
on an off the record basis?<br />
PM: Well he was I don't think it's a question of wisdom. I<br />
don't want to go into it other than to say I accept what he<br />
said to me, David, that he was in a state of considerable<br />
personal stress as a result of the sudden death of Chris<br />
Higgins. I think that that's a relevant consideration and I<br />
don't want to say anything more than that because, as I say, I<br />
accept without qu~ estion the apology that he tendered to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: would've been as evident to Mr Keating<br />
yesterday Did you say to him explicitly that you're<br />
intending to stay the full fifth term? </p>
<p>PM: Well what I indicated was that I intended to go into the,<br />
take the Party into the next election and that there was<br />
reference to the! uncertainty that there would be, if you know<br />
I wasn't standing there for the whole of that period and there<br />
was reference tc that. I have no doubt that he would have<br />
understood. That's why I've answered the question the way I<br />
did. There wasn.' t a specific question and answer but I have<br />
no doubt from th~ e nature of the discussion as a whole he would<br />
have understood that.<br />
JOURNALIST: In 1983 in an interview with David Frost you said<br />
you'd only stay three terms and when he asked why I think your<br />
reply was that after three terms your capacity for<br />
effectiveness in the job was substantially diminished. Why do<br />
you think now?<br />
PM: Well I've been there now. I know the playing field. I<br />
feel better equipped to be Prime Minister now than I was then<br />
because I've learnt more about my own country, more about my<br />
own people, and I certainly know more about the international<br />
environment within which we're operating. In physical terms I<br />
feel as well as better basically than I've ever felt.<br />
Intellectually and mentally I feel as alert as ever. So for<br />
all those reasons I think it is appropriate that I continue to<br />
be available.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, who were these people who came to you<br />
about going right through the fifth term?<br />
PM: I'm not responding to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why did they come now, in the last few days?<br />
PM: Well a) I'm not saying who the people were and I don't<br />
think you<br />
JOURNALI1ST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There was a range of people but<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just a minute. There were a range of people inside the<br />
Parliamentary Party and outside it. The question basically<br />
developed a momentum because of what I'd said before about<br />
standing down after the next election, during the period of<br />
it. And all these people were, as I say, kind enough to put<br />
two reasons for me as to why that shouldn't be my position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just a whole lot of separate people who suddenly<br />
PM: A whole lot of separate people Michelle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you at that dinner on Friday night would<br />
have had the view that Mr Keating's Do you accept that<br />
this issue is goiLng to dog you for the next few years despite<br />
the statement that came out yesterday?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Why?<br />
PM: Because not to accept that involves either or both<br />
accusing Mr Keat~ ing of lying and myself of excessive naivety.<br />
If you want to do either or both of those things, do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just coming back to that range of discussions<br />
that you had wit~ h various people, given the sorts of comments<br />
and declarations; you've made in the past, how much persuasion<br />
have?<br />
PM: Not a great: deal.<br />
JOURNALIST: Wil. l you speak at next year's Gallery dinner?<br />
PM: I didn't hear that, just a minute.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept that when your Deputy leader has<br />
such naked ambitions that it's very difficult for a leader to<br />
sustain his position?<br />
PM: No, I don't. Paul, as I say, has over a fairly<br />
considerable period of time not disguised his ambition that he<br />
would like one day to be Prime Minister. That's a perfectly<br />
legitimate ambition. One I have held myself at times in the<br />
past. I, as I say, I repeat what I put a moment ago. I<br />
accept what he's put to me now, and I believe the Party will<br />
and it will be seen to be operative in fact. What was your<br />
question? JOURNALIST: Seeing whether you'll be the guest next year at<br />
the Gallery dinner.<br />
PM: If it's off the record.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you say that you expect a<br />
recovery to begin in 1991, on the Could you expect to<br />
O see a recovery in the major opinion polls of yourself and of<br />
your Party?<br />
PM: I'm not sure. I noticed in one this morning. They said<br />
the Party's up somewhat. It will improve during 1991. I mean<br />
I don't know which months or which poll.<br />
JOURNALIST: completely different. The NSW Government<br />
says it will consider a NSW bid for the Year 2000 Olympics<br />
if they can get $ 125 million in interim funding from the<br />
Federal Government. I gather you've discussed this with Mr<br />
PM: I had a yarn with him yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what's your<br />
PM: He's going to write me a letter about it and I said I'd<br />
consider it when I got the letter.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I don't want to say anything more about it than this. My<br />
basic answer is I told Nick Greiner that I'd look at his<br />
letter, that we would want to be helpful. He indicated that </p>
<p>they needed upfront money. If they weren't successful<br />
they would be prepared to repay to the Commonwealth so that it<br />
wouldn't be a sort of pig in the poke sort of situation if I<br />
could put it tha~ t way. I said alright let's have a look at<br />
it. He's going to write to me and I'll consider that with my<br />
colleagues. JOURNALIST: Do you accept Mr Keating's general point, and I<br />
think he put it generally, not last Friday night, but that<br />
it's much more difficult than for a Prime Minister to be<br />
popular, to be up in the opinion polls?<br />
PM: You will have seen me say when I've been frequently<br />
speaking in defence of Paul that Treasurers by and large do<br />
have a difficult job of attracting popularity. It is<br />
reasonably difficult for a Treasurer. I've said that before.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, given that, how can the transition be<br />
O satisfactorily arranged whenever it is going to be? Aren't<br />
you always going to have this difficulty?<br />
PM: It may be. It just depends I mean, if you know that<br />
distant period down the track when this issue may arise the<br />
economy was booming along nicely and interest rates were low,<br />
employment in good shape, well obviously the assessment of the<br />
Treasurer would be better in those circumstances than it is<br />
now I would think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what did you think when you heard that<br />
Mr Keating had said that Australia had never had a great<br />
leader and it showed?<br />
PM: I didn't like it. Either in terms of its value as an<br />
historical analysis or in terms of its present relevance. Now<br />
I addressed both those issues in my discussion with Paul and<br />
indicated that I thought his historical analysis when he was<br />
saying what he said on Monday morning, what he said to me he<br />
O was really talking about the pre-83 period. I said well I<br />
think your analysis is wrong. He won't mind me saying here in<br />
terms of our conversation that I said that his analysis in<br />
respect of Curtin was in my judgement grossly inadequate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did he accept that?<br />
PM: I think it's fair to say that he accepted that his<br />
observations had done less than justice to Curtin. He made it<br />
quite clear to me that in his statements about leadership in<br />
Australia he had been referring to the period prior to this<br />
Government. So that's my answer in respect of the two<br />
elements of this question. The period which he said he was<br />
talking about in regard to the present.<br />
JOURNALIST: But Mr Hawke, he obviously thought this out. Why<br />
would he suddenly change his mind in an hour's conversation,<br />
three hours' conversation on his view of John Curtin?<br />
PM: For the very simple reason that I persuaded him. I mean<br />
I can persuade pe ople. I know it's very difficult for me to<br />
persuade you. I'ye come to that conclusion. But it's not<br />
difficult for me to persuade other people. I put the case<br />
which is overwhel~ ming. Let me briefly put it to you as I put </p>
<p>it to Mr Keating as to why I thought that analysis in regard<br />
to John Curtin was inadequate. I made a number of points. He<br />
came to office in probably Australia's darkest hour and<br />
committed himself and gave his life to saving the country.<br />
But as I said to Paul, he wasn't overwhelmed and absolutely<br />
dominated by the task currently in hand. He in fact set up at<br />
that very time the apparatus to make sure that the Australia<br />
that he was fighting to save and for which he gave his life,<br />
that that Australia in the post-war period was going to be a<br />
better and different Australia than those darkest hours of<br />
war. He set up the apparatus of the post-war reconstruction<br />
with people of the quality of Nugget Coombes to start planning<br />
then for a better and different Australia. As I put to Paul,<br />
that sort of concept, inspiration, decision-making and<br />
achievement in my judgement ranked at least with Roosevelt.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said all that?<br />
O PM: Yes, well we did have three hours yesterday. I mean you<br />
find it difficult to believe that in three hours I could say<br />
that. I mean I can, and I did and I also made the point, I<br />
said Paul I remind you of a previous conversation that we've<br />
had, and this is a conversation I had some time before. I<br />
said it's worth reading and I recommend it to you people<br />
it's worth reading the Parliamentary Debates here, the<br />
Commonwealth Hansards at the time of the Premiers' plan, about<br />
1930. Six years before the general theory. Read Curtin's<br />
speeches then. Curtin was light years ahead of his<br />
contemporaries in understanding the nature of the economic<br />
challenge and the appropriateness of certain policies and the<br />
profound inappropriateness of others. I'd recommended to Paul<br />
that he should read those debates. In the discussion I had<br />
yesterday I asked him whether he had and he hadn't. I said<br />
well it's a good idea to do it. I mean, my commitment to John<br />
Curtin is well known. I mean I say I don't have heroes, I<br />
don't accept the word hero. But I do have the most profound<br />
admiration for him and it is one which in a sense is both<br />
emotional and cerebral. I also said to Paul it was not only<br />
in terms of those issues that I've already talked about but<br />
look at the courage he had in facing up to his own Party and<br />
to himself on the question of conscription. Massive task that<br />
he had to understand and he did it under very considerable<br />
difficulties. Profoundly important as far as the welfare of<br />
his country is concerned. He did it. He also was prepared to<br />
take on the historical challenge if you like of saying that as<br />
far as the future welfare of Australia is concerned it was not<br />
now the imperial relationship, it was the relationship with<br />
the United States. He gave expression to that. He inspired<br />
people to accept the relevance of that. And forged a<br />
remarkable relationship with Macarthur. Now I'm simply saying<br />
when you take those range of considerations together to refer<br />
to Curtin as just a trier, as I pointed out to Paul, was<br />
grossly inadequate.<br />
JOURNALIST: As Prime Minister Mr Hawke, do you think it's<br />
right to say that this has done damage to the Government, that<br />
this particular incident originating last Friday night has<br />
damaged the Government and secondly can you tolerate another<br />
similar such incident which reveals Mr Keating's of you? </p>
<p>PM: The incident did damage but there is permanent damage and<br />
there is lasting damage. I don't think it's done permanent<br />
damage. It did some temporary damage. In regard to the<br />
second question I have no reason to believe there will be any<br />
repetition. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said you hope and expect that Mr<br />
Keating will be there after the next election but is there a<br />
possibility that; he might leave at the next election?<br />
PM: I guess there's a possibility but I don't expect it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Going back to the leadership. You mentioned that<br />
you weren't happy about Mr Keating's comments and you<br />
mentioned both historically and present terms<br />
PM: Yes but that was before I had spoken to him yesterday.<br />
He assured me that he was talking in an historical context.<br />
He wasn't talking about the present. He repeated to me what<br />
he'd said before to me personally and what he said publicly,<br />
that he regarded me as the most serious Prime Minister in the<br />
post-war period. But he emphasised to me that he'd been<br />
talking in as I say an historical context. I accept that.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about his line about walking around shopping<br />
malls tripping over television chords. Isn't that a direct<br />
reference to you?<br />
PM: He said not;. But he had not intended it as a direct<br />
reference but he understood that it was unfortunate, it could<br />
be taken that way and he apologised for it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said it could be difficult to<br />
repair the view that after these last few days to put across<br />
that you're a close team and get over..<br />
PM: I don't thi~ nk it will be hard to put across we're a close<br />
team because I don't think that one speech of one night can or<br />
will be seen to undo the fact of seven and a half years of<br />
close working relationship. I doubt if any serious political<br />
commentator disputes the proposition that the Hawke-Keating<br />
Prime Minister-Treasurer relationship has been the closest and<br />
most effective t~ hat anyone can remember. We've had our low<br />
points and we've both talked about those publicly. They've<br />
been rare. We see the economic picture in very similar terms.<br />
Not always identical, not always exactly the same emphasis.<br />
We work very closely and effectively together. I don't think<br />
one night's going to undo that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, your office last night described you as<br />
being hurt by what Mr Keating said. How long will it take you<br />
to recover from that hurt<br />
PM: I'm totally recovered.<br />
JOURNALIST: and put your personal relationship with Mr<br />
Keating back on an even keel?<br />
PM: I think it's back there. I was hurt. I mean I'm human.<br />
Until I'd heard what Paul had to say not only an explanation<br />
of what he said but the circumstances in which he'd said it </p>
<p>12.<br />
until I'd heard that I was hurt. But I said, I accept without<br />
qualification what he said to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on a different subject. How do you<br />
feel about foreign interests buying some or all of the Fairfax<br />
PM: I was wondering when we'd get to that. Well let me say<br />
this; I would prefer that the ownership of the Fairfax<br />
interest was in Australian hands. That would be my preference<br />
and I don't think we should dismiss the possibility of that<br />
happening. If some proposal were made which involves some<br />
degree of foreign ownership then obviously we'd be prepared to<br />
look at that. It would be stupid to say we wouldn't look at<br />
it. But my clear preference is for Australian ownership. If<br />
such a proposal involving any degree of foreign ownership<br />
would be involved, I think the sort of concepts that I see<br />
from this morning's Press were advanced by The Age staff group<br />
seem to me to be relevant.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well what limit would the Government allow on<br />
foreign ownership on the Fairfax..<br />
PM: Well as I've said I would prefer it to be Australian<br />
owned. The sort of general<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well wait a minute. Just a minute. You are very<br />
impatient. The Foreign Investment Review Board has tended to<br />
talk in general principle terms about 15%. There is nothing<br />
binding about that. I'm not being cute or devious in the<br />
answer I've given I never am on any answer but on this<br />
important one I'm not. I really am saying what I believe that<br />
I would prefer that you could get Australian ownership, saying<br />
that if some proposal is put up which would involve some<br />
degree of foreign ownership and prima facie it seemed to have<br />
merit then we'd -examine it. In saying that I am not saying<br />
0 well I'd do that if it involved 5% and not 10%. I mean the<br />
concept is what I'm putting. I hope that Australian ownership<br />
would in fact be what emerged.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you ruling out majority ownership?<br />
PM: Majority what?<br />
JOURNALIST: Foreign ownership.<br />
PM: I wouldn't favour majority foreign ownership.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about say 40-45%?<br />
PM: Well read the answer I've given, please. I mean I've<br />
given the answer three or four times. I mean, can I say it<br />
again in the hopea that it will be understood? Very simple,<br />
very straight forward, I would prefer Australian ownership.<br />
if some proposal were put up which involved the degree of<br />
foreign ownership, we would look at it. I've said I<br />
haven't that particular idea around 101% or any other<br />
percentage. Now I think that's pretty clear, straight<br />
forward. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The notion of control, Prime Minister, though<br />
clearly control can reside with something less than majority<br />
ownership? PM: It can and we would not favour control outside of<br />
Australia. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction to the Maxwell bid<br />
for 49% of the West Australian?<br />
PM: Well we've indicated previously in regard to another bid<br />
by that gentleman, we didn't favour it. I would want to see<br />
the details of this bid. Prima facie, not very keen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back to the Treasurer. Did the<br />
PM: Oh yes. Fairfax, Paul, Fairfax, Paul, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did. the Treasurer' s remarks themselves on Friday<br />
night, have an influence on your decision to stay on longer?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you tell us when you made that decision<br />
then, Prime Minister, to stay on<br />
PM: Relatively recently. But I mean I was interested in<br />
the range of people that had spoken to me about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was it triggered by the Howard Sattler interview?<br />
PM: Was it triggered? With all due respects to my dear<br />
friend, Howard, I can't recall<br />
JOURNALIST: Well that's when you made the commitment that you<br />
O would be fighting the next election then stepping down<br />
PM: Well that was the trigger point, if you like, of the<br />
approaches I got from a range of people. Yes, that's true.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the US Administration and/ or others of the<br />
allied contingent in the Gulf totally satisfied with<br />
Australia's level of contribution?<br />
PM: As I understand it, yes. I've had no indication other<br />
than that. Let me say our decision was not shaped in terms of<br />
will this be acceptable to the United States or anyone else.<br />
It was shaped in terms of you remember the three adjectives<br />
I used that I said it was significant, I said it was<br />
proportional and I said it was practical. I believe that what<br />
we have committed and decided meets those relevant criteria<br />
and it was those criteria which shaped our decision. Having<br />
said that, I have no reason to believe that that decision is<br />
other than acceptable, not only to the United States but<br />
others, and so it should be. If you look at the measure of<br />
our commitment compared with many others, there's no way that<br />
anyone can look askance at Australia. </p>
<p>14.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is there not a danger that the<br />
Australian people will think that you've done a secret deal<br />
with Mr Keating and in fact you're not going to serve through<br />
the next term?<br />
PM: In life and in politics you will never be believed by<br />
everyone, including may I say, may I dare say it, including<br />
some people in this particularly cynical group. You'll never<br />
be believed. You'll always harbour in your mind some doubt<br />
that we've got a hidden agenda. Well let me look you straight<br />
in your eyes and say believe me, Amanda, believe me. Because<br />
it's JOURNALIST: You'll have to do a lot better than that I think.<br />
PM: Well is that an invitation?<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Those things are behind me, Amanda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mr Keating's credibility been damaged by his<br />
statements that we weren't going to have a recession and then<br />
we've had one, we had to have it end of the year?<br />
PM: I think Paul would say that his standing is lower than it<br />
has been before because of the fact that we're in recession.<br />
But I would go on to say this; that I believe that we will<br />
reach a position where the Australian people understand that<br />
the decisions that we've made have been necessary, certainly<br />
they have involved pain and will continue to involve pain for<br />
some time. But IE remind you of the gains as well as the pain,<br />
and I say that fully acknowledging the reality of the pain for<br />
tens of thousands of Australians. But the gains are real<br />
also. We now have an underlying rate of inflation which is<br />
the lowest since these comparable records have been kept the<br />
beginning of the 1970s. We have to the year to September an<br />
__ inflation rate ofE 6% which is below the average OECD rate. We<br />
S have in regard to the balance of payments an average monthly<br />
figure in seasonally adjusted terms of $ 1.3B which is running<br />
therefore at an annual rate of $ 15.6B, significantly below the<br />
Budget forecast of $ 18B. We have a situation where we have<br />
cemented into the lowered inflationary expectations the new<br />
wage/ tax deal wit~ h the ACTU which means that in this period<br />
ahead there are going to be significant lesser wage pressures<br />
upon the employer7s Of this country. It will mean that there<br />
will, as we get up to April of next year, have been a period<br />
of 12 months with no general wage increase. So there are very<br />
significant gains that have been made and I think as we go<br />
through ' 91 and t~ he significance of these gains become more<br />
apparent, not onl. y will the standing of the Treasurer but of<br />
the Government improve.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with the Westpac analysis yesterday<br />
that the recovery might be later than previously thought might<br />
be, in the second half of calender ' 91 rather than the first<br />
half? PM: Michelle, I think that's possible because you would've<br />
heard me say I'm not prepared to put the week or the month on<br />
the recovery. I mean it would be irresponsible to do that. </p>
<p>But let me point, Michelle, to the factors which I think are<br />
going to mean the recovery is going to take place in ' 91. I<br />
mean the fundamentals, I believe, are these, Michelle.<br />
Firstly and I've alluded to some of them you're going to<br />
have the tax cut~ s operating from the 1st January, they are<br />
quite significant and associated with that you're also going<br />
to have this absence of the expected wage pressure, the degree<br />
of wage pressure upon employers. That is going to be<br />
significant. You're going to have the inevitable I believe<br />
the inevitable turn-up of the stock cycle. That just can't<br />
continue to run down. And of course you're going to have the<br />
impact into ' 91 of the significant easing of monetary policy<br />
which has taken place during 1990, with the five successive<br />
reductions in interest rates. So those are the fundamentals<br />
which make me confident that through ' 91 the recovery is going<br />
to take place. But I'm not going to give false hopes by<br />
saying I think it's that particular month. I am confident<br />
it'll take place in ' 91.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think that Mr Keating possesses<br />
the qualities to make him a great Australian Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I think he has the capacities within him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you win the next election as Prime Minister<br />
Mr Keating. If you fell under a bus<br />
PM: You're not pointing the bone at me, are you? It's<br />
hypothetical. I am the one who's got the best chance of<br />
leading Labor to victory in the next election. I fully intend<br />
to do so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how do you think<br />
PM: You better not see Hazel see her tonight if I were<br />
you. JOURNALIST: How do you think Bob Hawke will stack up against<br />
John Curtin in the history books of the future?<br />
PM: Well that's for the historians and I'm not going to do a<br />
Churchill who, a~ s you know, said if he intended that history<br />
would treat him well because he intended to write the history.<br />
I'm not going to write the history. I hope that people will<br />
see some positive comparisons. I don't think now is the<br />
occasion to go into that in any detail but they were<br />
challenges of different times. I haven't faced the challenge<br />
of war and of leading the country at its direst moment of<br />
peril when it really could've been invaded and taken over.<br />
That was a unique period for Curtin. But I think in terms of<br />
a preparedness to have a view about the necessity for<br />
Australia to change, to be a different Australia and to have<br />
the courage to tell my fellow Australians that they had to<br />
face up to that, that the world that they were now living in<br />
was fundamentally different from the world in which they'd<br />
shaped their assuimptions and attitudes of the past, I think<br />
there are some comparisons there but this is a task for<br />
history. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you told Mrs Hawke of your<br />
decision to keep on keeping on and what was her reaction? </p>
<p>PM: I think you probably should listen to a conversation<br />
between Paul and Hazel. I think you're going to get the<br />
feeling of that. Paul sort of got it wrong last night, didn't<br />
you, Paul. I've never seen so much steam coming out of her<br />
ears. She's a very placid if I can use that word she's<br />
basically a very placid person. She's very upset and annoyed<br />
with you, Paul, and you got it wrong.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Yes, well she got that impression. Well wait a minute.<br />
No, this is very serious. I haven't finished this. I can<br />
assure you that Hazel is both confident of victory in the next<br />
election and wants me to be leading the Labor Party as long as<br />
I feel able to do so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you make this decision, the five year<br />
S decision, before or after last Friday?<br />
PM: Before. I answered that question before. Now how are we<br />
going? JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in considering these approaches to stay<br />
on with the extra term were you conscious of the danger that<br />
you may fail to recognise the appropriate time of your<br />
departure? PM: I suppose that's always a problem for incumbents, Geoff,<br />
but as I have said before and the records sustain it, I had a<br />
fascinating, productive, useful life before politics. I<br />
intend to have one afterwards. Being in the Parliament and<br />
even being Prime Minister is not the only thing in life. I<br />
mean it's not as though I will be going through this period<br />
thinking this is the only thing which can give Bob Hawke<br />
satisfaction.<br />
O JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, given that Paul Keating's chances now<br />
rest on Labor winning six straight terms, what chances has he<br />
got of ever becoming Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I think he'S got quite a good one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, your decision to stay, was that shaped<br />
in any way by Mr Keating's unpopularity?<br />
PM: No, I have the position that as well as what I might<br />
think myself, I have my colleagues saying to me and they're<br />
not putting it in terms of anti Paul they're saying we<br />
believe that you are the best person to lead the Labor Party,<br />
you're still active physically, mentally and they have<br />
acknowledged the fact that our stocks as a Government and mine<br />
relatively are down. But they believe that for a range of<br />
reasons that the best interests of the Party and the<br />
Government and the country are involved in me continuing to<br />
lead. Now I think that's right and I'm prepared to act<br />
accordingly. JOURNALIST: Just on the GATT Round. If ever there was a case<br />
for leadership it's there. </p>
<p>17.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the time has come that you, as Prime<br />
Minister, ought : to take Australia's case more publicly than<br />
perhaps has been the case thus far?<br />
PM: I couldn't hiave taken it more publicly than I have. I<br />
mean JOURNALIST: I thiink you've activated the APEC round in terms<br />
of our own bloc?<br />
PM: No. What I've done is to, both by phone, in one case,<br />
and by personal letters to a range of world leaders, I have<br />
really taken the lead in this more than any other national<br />
leader, by personal communication and I will continue to do<br />
that. There was no point I mean, I don't know whether it<br />
was implicit in -the question, Dennis, that I, you know, it may<br />
have been a case for me going to Brussels rather than, or in<br />
addition to, Neal but that was not appropriate. I mean, the<br />
only national leader that went was the new Prime Minister of<br />
New Zealand and . I think that the assessment is that, you know,<br />
his presence didn't change things. That was a case for it<br />
being left at that stage in the hands of the Ministers. But<br />
now what I will be doing is to look at what further steps I<br />
can take to try and inject the political will, Dennis, in it<br />
that's necessary. The position that's been reached now is<br />
that the round has been suspended. What is being done is that<br />
Dunkel, the head of GATT, is now, in this period ahead, going<br />
to be having discussions with people, particularly in Europe,<br />
to look at what's the best way of trying to resume. What's<br />
the best way and how can it be done. It may be a question,<br />
for instance, of also talking with or writing to him. What<br />
we've now reached is, and I think it's worth making this<br />
point, that the influence of Australia has been proven to this<br />
point to be very significant. If we hadn't established the<br />
Cairns Group and created that as a force that is now being<br />
accepted in these negotiations and it's quite clear what<br />
0 would've happened. We wouldn't be facing now the situation<br />
where these talks were adjourned. There would've been a<br />
stitched up result with agriculture left off. Agriculture<br />
would've been out as our predecessors walked away from the<br />
Tokyo round with agriculture left out. Australia has changed<br />
the picture and the pattern of the international negotiating<br />
scene in regard t: o trade because as a result of the initiative<br />
that we've taken and I pay tribute in ministerial terms back<br />
to John Dawkins then to Duffy and now to Blewett through<br />
them and with our leadership at the top, we have created a new<br />
situation whereby the truth, the reality is this; there will<br />
be no, there will be no outcome if there is no acceptable<br />
outcome on agriculture. We have taken the view that it's far<br />
better to have this adjournment that we've got than either<br />
accepting a minimalist position, you know, a no good decision<br />
or abandoning the negotiations. So we will now use all the<br />
influence that we've got and I will consider what are the best<br />
things I can do now to try and get that political will and<br />
impetus that's necessary to get an outcome. Because it is the<br />
case, as a result of what we've done, there will be no outcome<br />
unless there's an outcome on agriculture. </p>
<p>18.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you disappointed that Malaysia is<br />
talking about turning APEC into a more regional trading group<br />
with Australia and New Zealand specifically excluded?<br />
PM: Yes, I don't attach very much significance to the<br />
observations of Malaysia about excluding Australia. As you<br />
know, at the present time our relations are going through a<br />
sort of a rather bumpy patch, and you know the reasons for<br />
that. I don't want to elaborate on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just a minute. I don't want to elaborate on that. Let<br />
me say this; that I have said, as you know, publicly now on<br />
two or three occasions that if you get to the worst case<br />
scenario where the Uruguay Round were to collapse rather than<br />
be adjourned as it is now we would have to look at our<br />
position then and, of course we would within APEC, which not<br />
only includes Australia but which is the creation of<br />
Australia. We would be looking at what would be the<br />
appropriate reconstitution of APEC in that situation, but I<br />
must emphasise that is not our preferred position and we will<br />
be doing everything we possibly can to get a positive outcome<br />
out of the Uruguay Round when it resumes.<br />
JOURNALIST: received back from the European leaders to<br />
whom you've written, give you any hope that<br />
PM: Mixed bag so far, but I must emphasise that those replies<br />
were received before the adjournment and the position quoted<br />
by the adjournment. I live in hope in these things, but I<br />
don't underestimate the difficulties that we are going to<br />
face.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, aren't the Cairns group of countries,<br />
including Australia, the ones that stand to lose most from the<br />
collapse of the 13ATT talks and therefore wouldn't it be better<br />
in the end to accept the position on agriculture?<br />
PM: Well, Geoff, I mean it's a good question, but I don't<br />
think it's right because I think our great hope basically is<br />
that there is a very widespread degree of understanding in<br />
lots of Europe, lots of parts of Europe that they stand to<br />
lose enormously. The, you know, I don't rehearse the<br />
statistics, you know them, the billions of dollars that are<br />
involved in transfer payments either price wise or tax wise<br />
within Europe which significantly inflate the cost and price<br />
structure and therefore reduce the competitive position of<br />
Europe and those things are very deeply understood. I mean,<br />
one of the things that probably sticks in my mind most from my<br />
last visit to Eurcope was that meeting I had with the very<br />
significant group of German industrialists who were totally at<br />
one with us in our position and were active in propagating the<br />
insanity of these GATT position. So while that degree of<br />
understanding is there, I think there is a very considerable<br />
degree of hope and I think what we've got to do, as well as<br />
trying to get the political impetus, you know, at the<br />
political level, I think we've got to do what we can to<br />
harness those areas and important areas of understanding<br />
within Europe. Of course, as far as the developing countries<br />
are concerned, the tragedy of the breakdown in the Uruguay </p>
<p>19.<br />
Round is very real for them and there is an understanding in<br />
the developed countries, in many of the developed countries,<br />
of that truth too. So, I think it's a, there's a pretty<br />
widespread perception that the harm, the dimension of the harm<br />
is enormous beyond the Cairns Group and we've got to work on<br />
that. JOURNALIST: deal with the reality, it's the German<br />
farmers that have even more political clout than the German<br />
industrialists? PM: Yes, that is one of the realities, but we have some hope<br />
that now that the election is over and that Chancellor Kohl<br />
has got, as he has, a very handsome majority that within that<br />
new milieu the influence of the industrialists and the<br />
consumers may be more forceful. I mean, it's not just the<br />
industrialists, I mean, the fact is that nearly 93 percent of<br />
Germans stand to suffer from the current position being<br />
maintained. JOURNALIST: Given the GATT adjournment, is there any point in<br />
further delaying the industry statement?<br />
PM: Well it, of course, can be argued that that, from one<br />
point of view, it can be argued that that means further delay<br />
because there's one line of argument, you could say that until<br />
that is resolved you don't have the framework, the<br />
international framework of knowledge within which you'd be<br />
making decisions. But having said that, I hope that we'll<br />
still be able to make a statement in the sort of timeframe<br />
we've been talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: what would your attitude be to a purchase of<br />
Fairfax by either News Corp or Consolidated Press?<br />
PM: As far as News Corp is concerned, I wouldn't favour,<br />
basically, I wouldn't favour an acquisition by News<br />
Corporation and I. w1o uld have thought that as far as News<br />
Corporation is concerned, its mind and the mind of its bankers<br />
is concentrated more on the disposal than the acquisition of<br />
assets at the present time. As far as the Packer organisation<br />
is concerned, they, of course, are confronted with the reality<br />
of the cross media rules that we've put in place and they<br />
would have to make a decision as to which way they wanted to<br />
go there if they in fact did have an interest in that matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I ask your reaction to the, your general<br />
reaction to the death of the Fairfax dynasty and also whether<br />
for the sake of the health of the industry, you would prefer<br />
Fairfax to be sold as a block or broken up and sold as<br />
separate mastheads?<br />
PM: I don't find myself shedding any tears about the death of<br />
a dynasty. I mean, I, you know, I'm not a, in my nature a<br />
dynastyworshipper if it's Fairfax or whatever.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, no, I'm sort of ambivalent about Fairfax. I mean,<br />
Fairfax is not some monolithic view. I mean, I think, if I<br />
may say so, some of those who write for Fairfax are </p>
<p>perspicacious, constructive, others I would prefer not to<br />
describe so. And some are variable, but I don't really have<br />
any views about that aspect of it. My concern is that, and<br />
let me say this, I think that the newspapers in the Fairfax<br />
group, we're talking about the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age<br />
and the Financial Review, are great newspapers. I think they<br />
are great newspapers, they are a very, very significant part<br />
of the Australian political, economic and social scene. In my<br />
view it's important that they retain their positions. I think<br />
they've got proud traditions, by that I don't mean that I've<br />
always been happy with everything they have said or done or<br />
the influences they've wielded, but by any standards,<br />
Australian or international, these are great newspapers and I<br />
want to see them continuing to flourish in this country. Now<br />
whether that is best achieved by them being disposed of in<br />
block or separately, I don't know. But my concern is the one<br />
I've expressed.<br />
JOURNALIST: I take it from your earlier reference that you<br />
wouldn't consider any<br />
PM: No. Ok.<br />
JOURNALIST: why you would be opposed to News Corp or<br />
against it<br />
PM: Well, while I have said that in the past that I believe<br />
that the market is appropriate in having decided, you know,<br />
what's happened in the past. There comes a point at which you<br />
don't want an absolutely, overwhelming ownership of the media<br />
in one set of hands. I think that, you know, for fairly<br />
obvious reasons it would be better if there was ownership in<br />
hands other than the News Corporation. I don't think that's a<br />
very complex sort of set of reasoning I have on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Government prepared to re-look at its<br />
opposition to the idea of Robert Maxwell buying The Age?<br />
this morning he's expressed renewed interest. Would you have<br />
another look at him or would you still rule him out<br />
completely? PM: No. My position prima facie would be against it but I do<br />
ask you to look at the answer I gave before. If there's some<br />
particular proposition that comes up which involves some<br />
degree of foreign ownership we'd be prepared to look at it.<br />
My preference obviously is that it be Australian ownership.<br />
OK. Thanks.<br />
