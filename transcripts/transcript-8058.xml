PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JANA WENDT, A CURRENT<br />
AFFAIR, 19 JULY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, thanks for your time this evening.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
WENDT: I'd like to look specifically at one of those<br />
States that you hope to cooperate with and that is<br />
Victoria. How do you think that that Government has<br />
handled the financial crisis that exists there?<br />
PM: Well, that's a good try, Jana. I don't think you'd<br />
expect me on a public television program to go into my<br />
analysis of what's happened in Victoria, but, I mean, I<br />
don't want to dodge your question. Let me say this, that<br />
I would think that Mr Cain and his Ministers would have<br />
to readily concede that the handling of the economy down<br />
there has been less than perfect. I don't think they're<br />
going to say, Bob, you shouldn't have said that. It has<br />
been less than perfect. The important thing is that they<br />
get it right now.<br />
WENDT: I want to ask you specifically about the Pyramid<br />
collapse. Do you think that Victorian depositors of<br />
Pyramid were justifiably outraged when only last, or this<br />
February, the Victorian Government gave them guarantees<br />
that all was well?<br />
PM: Obviously when depositors hear what was said in<br />
February, then they take notice of that and then when<br />
things turn out differently they are going to be<br />
disappointed and justifiably disappointed. No-one can<br />
avoid the logic of that.<br />
WENDT: OK, so we can't avoid that logic. When we know<br />
that the Victorian Government was aware that Pyramid was<br />
in terrible trouble, do you think they were wrong in not<br />
letting those depositors know that they were aware of<br />
that trouble?<br />
PM: I don't know personally the extent of the knowledge<br />
of the Victorian Government at the time you talk about,<br />
Jana, so therefore I can't answer that question. </p>
<p>WENDT: Well, it is quite clear because the Victorian<br />
Government at the time, in March, was actively seeking a<br />
buyer for Pyramid. So it knew that Pyramid was in<br />
trouble. PM: It's always whether it's Victoria or any other<br />
State, I think you will have to appreciate fairly, that<br />
there is a, there is a dilemma for any Government and<br />
whether it's of a Labor or non Labor persuasion, if there<br />
are question marks about an institution, a large deposit<br />
taking institution and the line between a Government<br />
being concerned about that and not saying or doing<br />
anything publicly which may exacerbate the concerns and<br />
the runs that may be made, I mean, it's a very difficult<br />
line for a Government to draw.<br />
WENDT: But what's involved then, Mr Hawke, as I'm sure<br />
you appreciate, is 220,000 battlers, depositors, who<br />
weren't made aware by that Government that there was<br />
trouble.<br />
PM: I understand the concern there and I share their<br />
concern and what I am pleased to see is the commitment of<br />
the Victorian Government to try and meet the concerns of<br />
those people.<br />
WENDT: Are you satisfied that there is a commitment to<br />
rectify the problem? For instance, we've seen a number<br />
of runs on financial institutions there. The Chairman of<br />
the Bank of Melbourne, which itself suffered a run<br />
recently, said that there is a political vacuum in<br />
Victoria, that there is no political leadership there.<br />
What do you think?<br />
PM: Well, I don't accept that there's a vacuum. I don't<br />
accept that there's no leadership, but let me make the<br />
more important point in regard to the Victorian situation<br />
and that is that the Reserve Bank of Australia has made<br />
clear that, in regard to other societies in Victoria,<br />
that the banks will be provided with sufficient liquidity<br />
to ensure that they are not over-run by the problems of<br />
the Farrow Group. Now the Reserve Bank has said that and<br />
I think that's the important thing for people to<br />
understand. WENDT: Mr Hawke, maybe that guarantee isn't worth all<br />
that much because we ' ve seen continuing runs even<br />
spreading to NSW. Are we in a position where Victoria<br />
might trigger off a financial crisis nation-wide?<br />
PM: No.<br />
WENDT: Can you be sure of that?<br />
PM: I can't set myself up as an authority over and above<br />
the Reserve Bank in these matters. I'm satisified with<br />
what the Reserve Bank has said leads to the conclusion </p>
<p>that we should not have and do not have a basis for a<br />
national concern of the type that you're talking about.<br />
WENDT: You see Mr Cain thinks that there is potential<br />
there for a national crisis. His advice to depositors<br />
was, and I'm quoting him, " just sit back and draw breath,<br />
otherwise the entire financial system in Australia will<br />
be threatened".<br />
PM: Well Mr Cain has said that. I'm saying that the<br />
authority in regard to the national situation is the<br />
Reserve Bank as far as we're concerned. And the Reserve<br />
Bank has said that it will provide the liquidity to the<br />
banking system to ensure that other societies are not<br />
going to be adversely affected by the collapse of the<br />
Farrow group. So that's the important thing.<br />
WENDT: So you're satisfied that Mr Cain is wrong in that<br />
regard? PM: It's not a question of putting me against Mr Cain.<br />
I'm simply not going to have my statements set up against<br />
him. You can do that if you want. I'm simply saying<br />
that my responsibility is to put it in terms of my<br />
authority via the Reserve Bank. But let me make this<br />
point as to the future Jana, which I think is what you<br />
and we're all concerned with. I think that what we've<br />
got to do is to ensure that there is effective<br />
supervision of the non-bank deposit-taking institutions<br />
around the country.<br />
WENDT: Yes, so you obviously feel that there's a need<br />
for uniform legislation at least. You see Mr Cain has<br />
said that he blames your Government and your Government's<br />
policy mix of deregulation and high interest rates for<br />
what's happened. Do you accept any responsibility for<br />
what's happened in Victoriaa?<br />
PM: No, the responsibilities in regard to the<br />
supervision of these sorts of institutions is, under the<br />
law and under the Constitution, with the States. Now<br />
this has happened in Victoria, it hasn't happened<br />
elsewhere. So it's not appropriate for the Premier in<br />
question and the State in question to seek to transfer<br />
responsibility.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, there was a time in this State that I'm<br />
in at the moment in Western Australia when there were<br />
financial disasters that could be deemed to be less than<br />
the ones of the Victorian Government and it was seen to<br />
be wise to remove the leader of this State. Is it time<br />
for new leadership in Victoria?<br />
PM: That is the leadership in Victoria is entirely a<br />
matter for the Parliamentary Labor Party in Victoria.<br />
Entirely. </p>
<p>WENDT: Do you think it might be time for fresh<br />
leadership? PM: I do respect you for your ambition in asking the<br />
question but I know that you don't expect me on the Jana<br />
Wendt program, as great a program as it is, to intrude<br />
myself into what is essentially a matter for the<br />
Victorians. WENDT: Alright Mr Hawke, let's move on. Last week the<br />
Treasurer took a media entourage, at public expense, to<br />
share his passion for the VFL. Do you think that we<br />
should be footing the bill for that?<br />
PM: Let me say this, that at this stage of the year the<br />
Treasurer is an extremely hard-working individual. He<br />
wait a minute, I'm not dodging your question. He works<br />
hard all the year. But we are now in the process of<br />
preparing a budget. I mean I've come out to do this<br />
program from the Expenditure Review Commxittee. He's<br />
going flat out all the time. It's not a normal period of<br />
the year for the Treasurer. I mean his hours are<br />
extremely limited and I guess he saved a considerable<br />
amount of time in this way. Now there are rules for the<br />
use of these aircraft and I assume that they have been<br />
abided by.<br />
WENDT: So you think it's ok that we pay for that?<br />
PM: I don't think that Mr Keating is one who, in<br />
relationship to the job he does and what he's done for<br />
this country, can be seen to have exploited the<br />
emoluments or conditions that attach to the job.<br />
WENDT: Former Whitlam Minister Clyde Cameron has<br />
suggested that before this term is up, Mr Keating will be<br />
sitting in your chair. Is this the kind of statement<br />
that you're going to be lumbered with before you do say<br />
well I'm bowing out of this?<br />
PM: Clyde's likely to say anything isn't he. I mean he<br />
said that. Clyde's made a lot of statements that are<br />
wrong. He's made some that are right too. But he's not<br />
right on that one.<br />
WENDT: But clearly he's just adding to this feeling that<br />
the leadership push by Paul Keating is on.<br />
PM: Well, it's not a feeling that is felt around<br />
Canberra I can assure you. Every now and again a<br />
journalist or an ex-poly will try and give it a bit of a<br />
run. It is a non issue.<br />
WENDT: Doesn't bother you-<br />
PM: I can assure you-<br />
WENDT: Doesn't bother you. You don't resent it-</p>
<p>PM: No. No. Of course I don't resent it. I feel<br />
terribly secure.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, well let me move on again. The<br />
Attorney-General and the Justice Minister have called for<br />
evidence in relation to allegations that a Cabinet<br />
Minister and a high profile businessman were involved in<br />
a murder. Now has any evidence been brought forward, to<br />
your knowledge?<br />
PM: None to mine. And I make a simple point. That if<br />
the journalist in question, Mr Thomas Burton has any<br />
evidence whatsoever on this matter, there is an enormous<br />
obligation on Thomas Burton to take that evidence to the<br />
appropriate authorities. And I tell him, do that. If<br />
you've got evidence Mr Burton take it to the Federal<br />
police or the National Crime Authority. Take it to the<br />
relevant authorities. Because if you've got evidence<br />
then it should be investigated. And indeed if he doesn't<br />
take that evidence then he stands condemned.<br />
WENDT: Have you personally been made aware of the names<br />
allegedly involved in this?<br />
PM: No. I haven't.<br />
WENDT: Do you-<br />
PM: May I say as I look at my colleagues around the<br />
Cabinet table I don't do so with any trepidation that I'm<br />
looking into the eyes of a murderer.<br />
WENDT: Well Mr Hawke, I think on that note we'll leave<br />
it. Thank you very much for you time tonight.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
