    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the Hon. Joan Child AO who died over the weekend aged 91.</p>
<p>With Joan Child's passing, Australia has lost one of its pioneering female political leaders, and I have lost a role model.</p>
<p>Joan was the first female ALP Member of the House of Representatives and our nation's first female Speaker.</p>
<p>Widowed at a young age, Joan brought up five boys on her own, and for a time worked as a cleaner to make ends meet. She came to politics later in life, bringing remarkable gifts of common sense, good humour and persistence against the odds.</p>
<p>Though she attained high office, Joan always retained a sense of perspective. Her hobbies - gardening, reading detective fiction, listening to her idol Elvis - kept her firmly grounded.</p>
<p>As a confirmed 'true believer', Joan never forgot who had put her into politics or why. She was a powerful voice for the needs and rights of women, especially working women and women doing it tough.</p>
<p>Joan Child displayed great purpose and dignity in public life, setting an example that led the way for women's participation in the modern Labor Party.</p>
<p>Joan Child will remain for me an abiding source of inspiration.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, I honour her memory and offer my deep condolences to Joan's family, her friends and her many Labor colleagues.</p>
<p>Ms Child's family has graciously accepted the offer of a State Funeral, which I have extended as a mark of respect by our nation.</p>
