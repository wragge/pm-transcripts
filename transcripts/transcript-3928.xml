Press Statement No. 578<br />
19 October 1975<br />
COMMONWEALTH LABOR ADVISORY COMMITTEE<br />
The Commonwealth Labor Advisory Committee which<br />
comprises the four Federal Parliamentary leaders, the National<br />
officers of the Australian Labor Party, the officers of the<br />
represe~ ntatives of the Australian Council of Salaried<br />
and Professional Associations, and representatives of the<br />
Council of Australian Government Employee organisations met<br />
tonight at the request of the Prime Minister.<br />
The Committee gave strong support for the principle<br />
which is being correctly fought for by the Government, namely<br />
that a Government which has a majority in the House of<br />
Representatives should be able to complete the term for which<br />
it was elected. There was agreement with the assertion of the<br />
Prime Minister that no election for the House of Representatives<br />
should ever be held at the behest of the Senate. The peak<br />
organisations of the Trade Union movement pledged unqualified<br />
support to the Government in pursuit of these democratic<br />
principles. The Committee called on opposition Senators to cease<br />
obstruction and to exercise their constitutional responsibility<br />
to pass the Budget. While not conceding the right of the Senate<br />
to reject Money Bills and while noting that no Senate has ever<br />
done so the Committee called upon Opposition Senators to desist<br />
from their cowardly course of voting only to defer the<br />
Xppropriation Bills, and demanded instead, that they vote to<br />
pass or reject them. It believes that Mr Fraser should be<br />
prepared to test whether he has the support of all his Senate<br />
colleagues. The representatives of the Trade Union organisations<br />
pledged organisational, physical, and financial assistance to<br />
the Government in its fight for the future of democracy in*<br />
accordance with the above mentioned principles. The Trade Union<br />
representatives urged that those of their members participating<br />
in rallies for democracy should do so peacefully. They deplored<br />
the provocative and inflammatory statements of Opposition<br />
spokesmen such as Mr Fraser, Mr Anthony and Senator Greenwood,<br />
statements whi4ch can lead only to that same violence they<br />
profess to deplore. The Committee after hearing a report from the CAGEO<br />
representatives, called upon Public Servants throughout Australia<br />
to exercise loyalty, patience and restraint in the face of<br />
provocation by Mr Fraser and his colleagues who seek power by<br />
any means, no matter what the cost to Austr-' lia.<br />
