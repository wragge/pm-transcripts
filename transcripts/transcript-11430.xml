<p>   social politics, Snowy River Scheme.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. There's been a few changes since 1981.</p>
<p>   For example, when I addressed the 20th annual meeting we still</p>
<p>   had a mechanism called rather obscenely a "crawling peg" fixed</p>
<p>   exchange rate. We didn't have a floating exchange rate. We still had a very</p>
<p>   high tariff wall around Australia. We hadn't dreamt of privatising any of</p>
<p>   our major government business enterprises and I just failed in my second</p>
<p>   attempt to persuade the Fraser Government to introduce a broad-based indirect</p>
<p>   tax. Now it's called a Goods and Services Tax. But, I guess, that little</p>
<p>   reminder is an illustration that some things do stay the same but with the</p>
<p>   opportunity of government you can bring about some other very significant</p>
<p>   changes.</p>
<p>  And one of the themes that wanted to develop tonight is the current strength</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy, and most particularly the fact that the Australian</p>
<p>   economy was able to stare down such a bad economic downturn in the Asian</p>
<p>   Pacific region, is really due to the cumulative benefit of major economic</p>
<p>   reforms undertaken over the last 15 or 20 years. And those major economic</p>
<p>   reforms include a number undertaken by the former Labor government. And</p>
<p>   I've never been unwilling to give that government credit where it is due,</p>
<p>   particularly in relation to some of the financial sector reforms and the</p>
<p>   changes relating to reducing the level of tariff protection which, for a</p>
<p>   Labor government, was a particularly difficult political undertaking - of</p>
<p>   course, I might quickly add, by way of the partisan commercial, aided and</p>
<p>   assisted at that time by a very high-minded Opposition that didn't try and</p>
<p>   block things in the Senate. Think what we might have done with tariffs,</p>
<p>   for example, given the emotive places they occupy.</p>
<p>  But, seriously, the last 20 years - and I hadn't intended to start on this</p>
<p>   but the Chairman introducing me provoked me to do so - over the last 20</p>
<p>   years we really have seen the undertaking of major economic reforms deliver</p>
<p>   a cumulative benefit. And it's really when you add all of those things together</p>
<p>   you find the explanation - financial sector reform, which gave us a very</p>
<p>   well regulated and prudentially supervised banking system, very transparent</p>
<p>   banking system, very strong financial sector reforms, the changes to the</p>
<p>   industrial relations system carried out after the Coalition was elected</p>
<p>   in 1996, the very, very major turnaround in the fiscal position that was</p>
<p>   engineered by the Coalition over the last three-and-a-half years. You add</p>
<p>   those things to all the other reforms and you do begin to understand how</p>
<p>   it was that the Australian economy was able to so successfully work its</p>
<p>   way through the impact of the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>  I wanted tonight to briefly sketch the political, social and economic equation</p>
<p>   as I see it in Australia at the present time. And you can never talk about</p>
<p>   the Australian economy in isolation from the social or political climate.</p>
<p>   And the climate in which we operate at the moment really has three very</p>
<p>   important characteristics. We've gone through a period in which we have</p>
<p>   undertaken as a government and as a community a lot of very significant</p>
<p>   economic reforms and embraced a lot of economic change. And the question</p>
<p>   naturally arises, particularly in the wake of the very surprising result</p>
<p>   of the election in Victoria, as to whether we have now reached a point of</p>
<p>   reform fatigue as to whether the community is really saying we've had enough</p>
<p>   reform, we want a period of economic and social consolidation. And the textbook</p>
<p>   theories are all very well but there is a human dimension to all of this</p>
<p>   and you have to pause and call a halt for a while. I don't believe, myself,</p>
<p>   that the community is quite saying that but I think the community is saying</p>
<p>   a number of things to us, in government, about how reform is handled. So</p>
<p>   the first part of the climate that you've got to factor in is the fact that</p>
<p>   we have gone through a very lengthy period of economic reform over the last</p>
<p>   10 or 15 years.</p>
<p>  The second very, very important element that we have to inject into any</p>
<p>   consideration of the Australian economic and political landscape - and this</p>
<p>   has a very big social dimension - is the clear evidence of a growing divide</p>
<p>   between rural and regional Australia and the relative affluence of the rest</p>
<p>   of the country. This is something that I've become very conscious of over</p>
<p>   the last 12 months. And it is real and unless it is addressed it is going</p>
<p>   to significantly scar the future of this country because it represents a</p>
<p>   challenge to something that we have always held very dear in Australia and</p>
<p>   that is the contribution that the bush makes to not only our wealth but</p>
<p>   also to our national psyche. And what we're witnessing at the moment is</p>
<p>   generically a very affluent country. And large sections of our society are</p>
<p>   displaying an unparalleled degree of affluence and economic contentment.</p>
<p>   And there are sections of the Australian community that have, to borrow</p>
<p>   Harold McMillan's famous phrase, "never had it so good". And the</p>
<p>   rest of the community is very aware of it. And I think we all know that</p>
<p>   disadvantage, or the sense of disadvantage, is often a relative thing. And</p>
<p>   if you have areas of the country which are feeling left behind or left out</p>
<p>   at a time of economic plenty they feel the disadvantage and the deprivation</p>
<p>   all the more keenly and, indeed, more keenly than if the country were in</p>
<p>   a state of economic recession.</p>
<p>  But I think we do have a major challenge on our hands with the community</p>
<p>   to come to grips with this, to recognise that there is in the bush or rural</p>
<p>   and regional Australia, however you collectively describe it, a sense of</p>
<p>   falling behind, of having been left out. And there's no easy answer to that</p>
<p>   because as you all know so many of the problems of rural Australia are the</p>
<p>   product of almost irreversible forces such as, or uncontrollable rather</p>
<p>   than irreversible forces, such as a decline in commodity prices and the</p>
<p>   long-term disappearance of demand for particular products. In many ways</p>
<p>   handling this issue and ensuring that we don't lose that part of our national</p>
<p>   psyche represented by rural Australia and that we make the people of that</p>
<p>   part of rural Australia feel included and part of the Australian community</p>
<p>   is about as big a challenge a government has got at a state or federal level</p>
<p>   anywhere in Australia.</p>
<p>  The third element that we have to contend with, and we as politicians can</p>
<p>   never ignore it, and that is that every once in a while, of course, you</p>
<p>   try and get elected and, therefore, you have to pay some regard to what</p>
<p>   I call the political state as well as the social and the economic state.</p>
<p>   And you have to constantly balance the two sort of competing imperatives.</p>
<p>   On the one hand, you are elected to government to do good things and to</p>
<p>   bring about beneficial economic reforms but, of course, if you don't hold</p>
<p>   government you have no capacity to do anything at all and you always have</p>
<p>   to try and balance those two. I frequently say to my colleagues in the Parliamentary</p>
<p>   Liberal Party that it's very important that we maintain not only the reform</p>
<p>   faith but also the political faith. And that means being zealous but not</p>
<p>   too zealous. I encapsulate it by saying that there's not much point in being</p>
<p>   120 percent pure in Opposition. It's probably better to be about 90 percent</p>
<p>   pure in government. So there is a balance to be struck.</p>
<p>  But, of course, there's another change that's occurred in Australian politics</p>
<p>   over the last 10 years quite markedly and it's occurred around the world</p>
<p>   but it's quite profound in Australia and that is the process of what I call</p>
<p>   de-tribalisation of Australian politics. People are no longer rusted on</p>
<p>   to one or other side of politics to the extent they were a generation ago.</p>
<p>   When I was learning my political craft in the Liberal Party in the 1960s</p>
<p>   I operated on, it sounds vaguely redolent of the bygone economic management</p>
<p>   age, I operated on a 40-40-20 rule - and 40 percent voted Liberal, 40 percent</p>
<p>   Labor and 20 percent were in the middle. I think the modern manifestation</p>
<p>   of that is a 30-30-40 rule where you have 30 percent Labor, 30 percent Liberal</p>
<p>   and perhaps 40 percent moving around in the middle. People react counter-intuitively</p>
<p>   now to a lot of issues and I think it's one of the things that political</p>
<p>   parties have got to come to terms with.</p>
<p>  There are plenty of examples we can find in recent years of people voting</p>
<p>   against the traditional patterns. Now, this is not absolute. It is still</p>
<p>   possible to divine and discern certain straight lines as far as political</p>
<p>   allegiances are concerned but they are a lot more mixed now and they're</p>
<p>   a lot less predictable. And people don't feel as ideologically committed.</p>
<p>   The Cold War ended 10 years ago and I often heard people, when I grew up,</p>
<p>   say, well look, I think the government - at that particular time it was</p>
<p>   a Liberal government - is doing a terrible job but I can't possibly vote</p>
<p>   Labor. And, equally, I would hear Labor people saying the reverse of the</p>
<p>   Liberal Party in respect of an incumbent Labor government. Now, that sort</p>
<p>   of permanent zealous commitment is not quite as frequent anymore.</p>
<p>  So all of these things mean that we are operating in a different political</p>
<p>   climate than what we were a few years ago. We're operating in a climate</p>
<p>   where there's been major economic reform and the public feels that it's</p>
<p>   done its bit to contribute towards that. We have this particular problem</p>
<p>   in Australia, although I suspect it's not confined to Australia, of coping</p>
<p>   with rural and regional or non-metropolitan decline and the social and economic</p>
<p>   and political challenge of that. And, finally of course, as practising politicians</p>
<p>   and this is of less concern to you as it is to me, we have to cope with</p>
<p>   a more volatile and a less predictable political climate.</p>
<p>  Now, we remain very committed to a reform agenda. I like to think that the</p>
<p>   last three-and-a-half years have been characterised by some quite fundamental</p>
<p>   economic reforms. And if we flick through them I think labour market reform</p>
<p>   has been more far-reaching than it's been given credit for and it's one</p>
<p>   of the reasons why we have a far better productivity performance than we've</p>
<p>   had for a long time. And I think the changes in the power balance in the</p>
<p>   industrial relations arena, I think to a more level playing field, have</p>
<p>   been very beneficial. They have not been attended by the degree of industrial</p>
<p>   disputation that people predicted would occur. And, overall, I think we've</p>
<p>   got a lot to be pleased about in that area.</p>
<p>  We have, of course, achieved a major fiscal turnaround and that's made a</p>
<p>   contribution, although it's certainly not the only reason why we have, despite</p>
<p>   the increases of recent days, the lowest interest rate structure in about</p>
<p>   three decades, a very low rate of inflation, a still pretty strong business</p>
<p>   outlook, an employment growth factor over the last couple of years, particularly</p>
<p>   the last six months, which has been the best for a long time and, pleasingly,</p>
<p>   a significant reduction in the level of youth unemployment, although it</p>
<p>   still remains unacceptably high and we still have quite a distance to go</p>
<p>   on the unemployment front. And, of course, we have embraced, after a lot</p>
<p>   of argy bargy, politically and legislatively, we've embraced a major change</p>
<p>   to our taxation system, one that we sort of dreamt of for a long time and</p>
<p>   attempted by a number of people on both sides of politics and finally realised</p>
<p>   when we won the election last year. It didn't survive in its pristine form.</p>
<p>   We got about 85 percent of it. It would have been better if we'd got the</p>
<p>   100 percent but we're realists. Once Senator Harradine said, I can't or</p>
<p>   I cannot or I won't - I forget exactly what the precise expression was but</p>
<p>   it meant no - so we realised we had to negotiate with the Australian Democrats</p>
<p>   and that's another new element.</p>
<p>  The public, incidentally, is not really interested in long, philosophical</p>
<p>   dissertations from one or other side of politics as to why the other side</p>
<p>   should unilaterally capitulate and give in and let your legislation go through</p>
<p>   the Senate. I mean, we might think they're very interesting things and we</p>
<p>   might dine out at Liberal or Labor Party gatherings depending on who the</p>
<p>   politician is about how terrible and outrageous and what an absolute assault</p>
<p>   on democracy it is for the Senate to obstruct this fine piece of legislation.</p>
<p>   But, in the end, I have an uncomfortable feeling that what the public is</p>
<p>   saying is very simply, you're the Government, you're the Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   you get it fixed, you get it through, don't bore me with all the rhetorical</p>
<p>   debates. And I certainly found as I went around Australia during the debate</p>
<p>   in relation to native title and a number of other issues that that was certainly</p>
<p>   the case. So all government is something of a learning curve no matter how</p>
<p>   long you've been in and that's something that I've certainly learnt over</p>
<p>   the last three-and-a-half years, that the public is interested in outcomes.</p>
<p>   And may I say the younger generation in Australia is particularly interested</p>
<p>   in outcomes as far as their politicians are concerned and far less in ideology</p>
<p>   or prejudice or protesting or fighting long resolved rhetorical battles.</p>
<p>  So you have to work with political minorities, you have to work with independents,</p>
<p>   they're a feature of the political landscape. You might wish that you had</p>
<p>   absolute majorities in every parliament but that is not the case. We do</p>
<p>   remain very committed to a reform agenda. But I think that reform agenda</p>
<p>   has to be carried forward having regard to the sort of constraints and the</p>
<p>   sort of climate in which governments, and particularly the national Government,</p>
<p>   operate at the present time.</p>
<p>  Right at the moment we are negotiating with the Labor Party and the Democrats</p>
<p>   regarding the business tax reform package. And I am very hopeful that we</p>
<p>   will get that package through largely, perhaps not totally, but largely</p>
<p>   unamended. And I am cautiously optimistic that that will turn out to be</p>
<p>   the case. The indications from both the Democrats and the Opposition are</p>
<p>   that they are not interested in a very long drawn out Senate inquiry process</p>
<p>   of the type that applied in relation to the Goods and Services Tax.</p>
<p>  And if we can bed those business taxation changes down, and if we can successfully</p>
<p>   handle and negotiate and work our way through the implementation process</p>
<p>   so far as the Goods and Services Tax is concerned, and that represents a</p>
<p>   very, very important challenge for us, then we will certainly have a great</p>
<p>   deal on our plate over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>  But in saying that we are conscious of the sort of climate in which reform</p>
<p>   must take place I wouldn't want anybody to imagine that I subscribe to the</p>
<p>   reform fatigue theory of politics nor indeed that we have lost our commitment</p>
<p>   to economic reform. It is just important that we and our constituencies</p>
<p>   and the broader Australian community understand the considerations that</p>
<p>   we must take into account in advocating and implementing reform.</p>
<p>  I've had the view for a very long time that the Australian public will accept</p>
<p>   fundamental change and reform in the economic area if you can satisfy the</p>
<p>   public on two counts. The first is that you have to persuade them that the</p>
<p>   reform is good for Australia. I have to say with the benefit of hindsight</p>
<p>   and disclosing the thoughts of a political advocate as well as an economic</p>
<p>   reformer that the argument that in the end I think mattered more in the</p>
<p>   last federal election campaign about the Goods and Services Tax was the</p>
<p>   argument that overall it would probably be beneficial for the whole country.</p>
<p>   Individuals may have thought well, it won't be particularly good for me</p>
<p>   and there may well be people in this room who feel that individually those</p>
<p>   changes were not particularly beneficial but collectively they felt that</p>
<p>   those reforms would be good for Australia. Because there is a sense of altruism</p>
<p>   within the broad community and there is a belief that the national benefit</p>
<p>   in the end is something worth supporting and something worth promoting.</p>
<p>  And the second condition that you have got to fulfil is that you have got</p>
<p>   to satisfy people that the reform you are proposing is fundamentally fair</p>
<p>   to the average Australian. If you fail either of those tests, if a reform</p>
<p>   fails the national interest test or if it fails the fairness test then it's</p>
<p>   not going to get, in my view, out of the barrier let alone past the winning</p>
<p>   post. So I do think that they are the two things and if you look at all</p>
<p>   of the major reforms that in the end have succeed in this country you can</p>
<p>   probably judge them against those two criteria.</p>
<p>  Now, there are a number of areas of not only the Australian economy but</p>
<p>   a number of areas of the Australian community where further reform is necessary.</p>
<p>   One of the things that we are going to focus on at our national convention</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party in Melbourne next year is social policy. Having focussed</p>
<p>   an enormous amount over the last several years on economic change and economic</p>
<p>   reform we believe that some of the fundamental directions of social policy</p>
<p>   in this country deserve a more serious examination at a national political</p>
<p>   level.</p>
<p>  Now, this examination will take place against the background of our commitment</p>
<p>   to the maintenance of a social security safety net, our commitment to the</p>
<p>   principles of mutual obligation that have underpinned our embracing of Work</p>
<p>   For The Dole and a number of other policies in the welfare area. But consistent</p>
<p>   with those commitments, I think the time has come for a more serious examination</p>
<p>   of social policy. The implications of an ageing population, although the</p>
<p>   population I hasten to add is not ageing at quite the rate it is in a number</p>
<p>   of other countries. And given that some of the reforms of earlier years</p>
<p>   have given us a capacity to deal with that ageing process rather better</p>
<p>   than many other countries.</p>
<p>  So, ladies and gentlemen, that represents, as best I can put it to you as</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, to come to the end of 1999 and the end of this century and</p>
<p>   this millennium, an overview of the circumstances in which Government is</p>
<p>   operating at the present time. As I said at the beginning of my remarks,</p>
<p>   you cannot ignore, when you are looking at economic policy, you cannot ignore</p>
<p>   either the social dimension or the political dimension. You cannot ignore</p>
<p>   the national culture.</p>
<p>  I often hear people who might loosely be described as having strongly, economically</p>
<p>   liberal or economically rationalist views argue to me that this or that</p>
<p>   is how it is done in the United States. Now, I always say that I note that</p>
<p>   with a great deal of interest and there are many things about the United</p>
<p>   States, or indeed other countries, that are flung in my face as adopting</p>
<p>   the right model or the right approach. And I try to remind them that there</p>
<p>   is a national culture in this country which requires that certain things</p>
<p>   be done differently.</p>
<p>  We, in my view, have often found the right balance between what you might</p>
<p>   loosely call the excessive involvement of government or the fussing involvement</p>
<p>   of governments in many European countries. And the belief in some parts</p>
<p>   of the United States is virtually no role at all for government. And I think</p>
<p>   Australia has always managed to put itself fairly sensibly in the middle.</p>
<p>  When I am asked the question, what do I think the role of government is</p>
<p>   in Australia, I think the role of government in Australia is a limited role</p>
<p>   but nonetheless a strategic role. And there will always be certain things</p>
<p>   that government has to involve itself in.</p>
<p>  And I had a very powerful reminder of that several weeks ago when I spent</p>
<p>   the whole weekend celebrating, along with the men and women who had worked</p>
<p>   on it, the 50th anniversary of the commencement of the Snowy</p>
<p>   River Scheme in this country. And as a 10 year old school boy at Earlwood</p>
<p>   Public School here in Sydney I can still remember in October of 1949 one</p>
<p>   of my Labor predecessors, Ben Chifley, announcing the commencement of the</p>
<p>   Snowy River Scheme. And that particular scheme for that generation of Australians</p>
<p>   and particularly the generation of Australians who made this country their</p>
<p>   home from war torn Europe had an impact on the national psyche and the way</p>
<p>   we thought of ourselves and the role of government in the Australian community</p>
<p>   that has never left us.</p>
<p>  Now, I think the role of government has to be limited but it nonetheless</p>
<p>   has to be strategic. And in a way, if you look back over the last 30 years</p>
<p>   and you examine political debate and you listen to political and economic</p>
<p>   discourse you can see as always a pattern of the pendulum swinging from</p>
<p>   one side to the other. We did go through a period both here and around the</p>
<p>   world where people imagined that every single problem could be solved by</p>
<p>   government intervention and if it was a federation by federal government</p>
<p>   intervention. It manifested itself in the United States with Lyndon Johnson's</p>
<p>   great society, as he called it, where you tried to solve all the social</p>
<p>   problems by federal government intervention. It manifested itself here with</p>
<p>   the, I think, the excesses of the Whitlam years where there was not only</p>
<p>   a massive ramping up of federal government expenditure but an unnecessary</p>
<p>   excursion of federal governments into areas that belonged to state and local</p>
<p>   government.</p>
<p>  And then in a way in the 1980's I think perhaps in some parts of the world</p>
<p>   the pendulum swung back perhaps in a number of areas and perhaps a little</p>
<p>   too far, although I think the changes implemented in Britain and the United</p>
<p>   States by the Thatcher and Reagan governments not only provided a great</p>
<p>   model for the rest of the world but also it left lasting benefits in those</p>
<p>   two societies.</p>
<p>  I think as we've got into the 1990s and we've shed ourselves of the influence</p>
<p>   of some of the ideological offshoots of the Cold War, I think we now have</p>
<p>   a more balanced and sensible approach to the role of the individual, the</p>
<p>   role of business and the role of the States. We don't want the State doing</p>
<p>   things that businesses can do better. We don't want, in my view, the Government</p>
<p>   running business enterprises that are better run by private enterprises.</p>
<p>   We don't want the Government dictating the entirety of the education system.</p>
<p>   We don't want the Government excessively intruding into our lives. But we</p>
<p>   do see a role for Government beyond just setting a macroeconomic climate</p>
<p>   we also see a role for Government in areas such as infrastructure provision</p>
<p>   and some of the other strategic responsibilities. And I think we have therefore</p>
<p>   reached a more balanced attitude towards the respective roles of Government</p>
<p>   and individuals and businesses within the Australian community.</p>
<p>  Can I finish by saying, ladies and gentlemen, that I am, of course, filled</p>
<p>   with an enormous amount of optimism and hope and enthusiasm about the state</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy. It is better now than I have experienced at any</p>
<p>   time in the 25 years that I have been in politics. I think the strength</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy now is more soundly based than what is was in</p>
<p>   the late 1960s because many of the artificial protectors and stabilisers</p>
<p>   that existed in the 1960s were as the adjectives suggest they were artificial</p>
<p>   and they had to be at some stage removed.</p>
<p>  We are living more realistically now than what we were 35 years ago. We</p>
<p>   are more capable of responding to a global economic climate than we were</p>
<p>   then. We, I think, are enjoying the benefits of the various contributions</p>
<p>   that have been made to our society from the combination of our western inheritance,</p>
<p>   our Asian geography and our North American affiliations. And the contribution</p>
<p>   being made by those three influences have, I think, never been more evident</p>
<p>   and never been more positively available to the Australian community.</p>
<p>  So I do conclude my remarks on an incredibly optimistic and hopeful note.</p>
<p>   We still have reform challenges ahead of us. We have, as I have tried to</p>
<p>   outline in my remarks, a number of internal, social and economic challenges</p>
<p>   particularly the divide between what might loosely be called those in rural</p>
<p>   Australia who are falling behind and the rest of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   And we do have a social, national, even patriotic, obligation, if I can</p>
<p>   be allowed to use that word, of gathering up those people because they are</p>
<p>   not only part of our society and part of us but they are part of how we</p>
<p>   think of ourselves.</p>
<p>  And the sort of Australia that I grew up in is one that always saw rural</p>
<p>   and Australia in the bush as being an integral part of the Australian identity.</p>
<p>   And to lose it would be to lose part of ourselves and we have a very strong</p>
<p>   obligation to do something about it. And it will be one of the priorities</p>
<p>   of Government, difficult though it is, over the months and the years ahead.</p>
<p>  But thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be very happy after the main</p>
<p>   course to try and answer your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  ..spend enough on those people in Australia who can't help themselves. I</p>
<p>   also believe ??? that we spend far too much on those people who could but</p>
<p>   won't help themselves. Your comments please.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I broadly agree with that and I would hope that our policy of mutual</p>
<p>   obligation, best expressed in work for the dole, is an attempt to capture</p>
<p>   the tension between those two things. It's interesting how it's been accepted</p>
<p>   when, and we're talking about twenty years ago a lot tonight, but it was</p>
<p>   interesting when as a member of the former Coalition Government back in</p>
<p>   the late 1970s early 80s, the idea of work for the dole was raised and the</p>
<p>   stock response then of our advisers was oh you can't do that. It will be</p>
<p>   in breach of some Geneva convention. And anyway, the unions in any event,</p>
<p>   the unions won't wear it and it's absolutely unacceptable to the Australian</p>
<p>   community. Now that's interesting how that's changed. I think people in</p>
<p>   Australia do accept that if people are without means of support we have</p>
<p>   a moral obligation to help them. But they have an obligation, a civic obligation</p>
<p>   if they're able to do so to give something in return for that help. I think</p>
<p>   we've actually established that principle quite well in this country and  </p>
