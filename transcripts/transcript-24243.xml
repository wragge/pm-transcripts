    <content><![CDATA[<p>Look, thanks for your hard work. We are delivering for the people of Australia, we are working hard for the people of Australia and that’s exactly what they want of us.</p>
<p>Just in the last week we’ve announced some improvements to national security; we’ve flagged progress in welfare reform, in childcare reform; we’ve flagged improvements to food labelling and we’ve also announced a crackdown on illegal foreign investment in Australia. Of course, last week, as well, we announced some important benefits to the people who were hit by the cyclone in Queensland.</p>
<p>So, every day we are focussed on doing the right thing by the people of Australia and that’s what they expect. They don’t want people in Canberra worried about themselves – they want people in Canberra worried about them.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to do. This week, the data retention legislation comes before the Parliament. This week, obviously, the Treasurer will be releasing the intergenerational report and while that shows the scale of the budget problem, it also shows the extent of the progress that we’ve already made.</p>
<p>So, we’ve got a lot to discuss today and let’s get down to business.</p>
