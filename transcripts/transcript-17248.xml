    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of three Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel earlier today in a helicopter crash near Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<p>I extend, on behalf of the Australian Government and people, our condolences to the families of the victims, to the service men and women of the New Zealand Defence Forces, and to the Government and people of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with them.</p>
<p>As the people of our two nations come together today in Anzac Day ceremonies across our countries and around the world, to honour the memory and commemorate the sacrifice made by our service men and women, this tragedy is an especially poignant reminder of the risks that our men and women in uniform continually face on behalf of our two nations and for our freedoms.</p>
<p>I understand a fourth crew member is in a critical condition. We pray for his full recovery.</p>
