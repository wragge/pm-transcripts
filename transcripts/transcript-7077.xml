PRIME MINISTER<br />
E AN 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
COMMIENTS RY THE PRIME fMINISTER AT " RAAF BASE FRIDAY. 23 JANUARY 1987<br />
JOURNALIST: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR'WARED-TOTHE-TRIP?<br />
Pi: YES. THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT OCCURRED THIS MORTIING<br />
THAT I THINK WE ALL SHOULD 3E AWARE OF. I HAD A CALL FRON PRESIDENT<br />
REAGAN ON A VERY IMPORTANT HATTER, A CONTEST THAT IS GOING TO BE<br />
TAKING PLACE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF AUSTRALIA, WHICH BEGINS WHILE I'M<br />
AUAY. HE SAID HE WASN'T NORMALLY A PU4TING MAN. IT'S NOT SOMETHING<br />
I CAN SAY MYSELF IN RECIPROCATION. HE THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE<br />
SOME WAGER BETWEEN US. HE NOMINATED THE STAKES OF ONE OF HIS WHITE<br />
COWBOY HATS AGAINST AN AUSTRALIAN AKUBRA. SO THE STAKES ARE SET.<br />
JOURNALIST: SO HE'S 9ACKING TKE AMERICANS?<br />
P-I: YES HE IS.<br />
JOURNALIST: HAS RE GOT ANY CHANCE?<br />
P14: WELL THEY'RE IN THE RACE, BUT WE'LL WIN.<br />
-JOURNALIST: PRI9E MINISTER, ON Y-OU---T-I-P-DO-Y-OU--T-HI-NK--OUR-E--WALKINJG<br />
A DIPLOIATIC-TIGHTROPE?<br />
Pit: NO I DON'T THINK IT'S A DIPLOMATIC TIGHTROPE. IT HAS HISTORICALLY<br />
BEEN A VERY COMPLEX AREA, TENSE AREA. BUT I HAVE VERY GOOD RELATIONS<br />
WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN THE COUNTRIES THAT 1' fM VISITING OF JO DAN AND<br />
ISRAEL AND EGYPT. AND AUSTRALIA ITSELF HAS GOOD STANDING. WE'RE<br />
RECOGNISED AS A COUNTRY WHICH HAS A RESPONSIULE APPROACH TO THE<br />
PROBLEAS OF THAT AREA, BASED UPON ON THE ONE HAND THE RECOGNI'TION OF<br />
. THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO EXIST, BEING BEHIND SECURE AND RECOGNISED<br />
3ORDERS. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHTS Of THE<br />
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. THAT'S RESPECTED AND I GO THERE NOT TO ASSUME<br />
ANY GRAND ROLE AS MEDIATOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I'VE MADE IT<br />
QUITE CLEAR THAT I GO THERf TO LISTEN AND MERELY TO SAY THAT IF IN<br />
ANY WAY AUSTRALIA CAN BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE AT ANY TIE THEN THAT<br />
WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.<br />
JOURNALIST: BUT YOU DO HAVE A PASSIONATE INTEREST, ALMOST A LOVE FOR<br />
ISRAEL, DON* T YOU? CAN YOU BE EVEN-HANDED?<br />
PM: I WISH PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNISE WHAT IVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SAYING<br />
ABOUT THIS. OF COURSE I HAVE. STRONG, CONTINUING COMMITMENT OF THE<br />
RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO EXIST. I RECOGNISE ITS IMPORTANCE FOR THE PEOPLE<br />
OF THE JEWISH FAITH, I HAVE ALWAYS, AT THE SAME TIME, ACKNOWLEDGED<br />
THE RIGHTS Of THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. I HAVE NO DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN<br />
RECONCILING THE NATURE OF MY COMMITMENT IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL WITH A<br />
RESPONSIBLE ASSESSMENT Of WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ATTEMPT TO BRING SOME<br />
RESOLUTION Of THIS PERMANENT CONFLICT Ij THE REGION, W4ICH IS NOT<br />
ONLY TRAGIC FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE REGIO14 ITSELF, OUT REMAINS ONE Of<br />
THE POTENTIAL FLASH POINTS Of DANGER FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. </p>
<p>JOUkNALIST: WHAT ABOUT MR VANUNU PIME MINISTER, ARE YOU GOING TO<br />
4AISE THAT ; MATTER?<br />
PM: ANYTHING I HAVE TO SAY A0OlT THAT IS NOT HELPED BY PUBLIC<br />
COtiMENT. JOURNALIST: ONE OT4ER THING. WE LEARN FROM THE PAPERS THIS MORNING<br />
THAT WE'VE REJECTED THE UN REQUEST FOR A SEMINAR. CAN YOU TELL US<br />
WHY? LV. E GO. T-N-O_ COM-MET _ TO . MAKE _ ON_ THAT AT TH IS _ STAGE.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE, AS YOU'RE LEAVING ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE<br />
MEDIA OWNERSHIP MESS THAT YOU'RE LEAVING BEHIND?<br />
PM: WHAT MESS?<br />
JOURNALIST: WELL THE CURRENT STATE OF FLUX.<br />
PM: CERTAINLY A CURRENT STATE OF FLUX, BUT I NOTICED ALL MY PAPERS<br />
HERE THERE THIS MORNING. TELEVISION STATIONS ARE STILL OPERATING AfiD<br />
THE RADIO IS WORKING. YOU'RE ALL GIVING US A FAIR GO.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID YOU EVER THISK'THE CROSS OWNERSHIP RULES WOULD HAVE<br />
LED TO THE TYPE OF SITUATIOti WE'VE SEEN?<br />
PM: I'VE HAD A VIEW ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE AREA OF<br />
LEGISLATION AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED DOUBT ABOUT THE WISDOM OF<br />
WHAT WE'VE DOING. IT SEEMS TO BE HAVING ITS AFFECTS NOW BEFORE IT IS<br />
EVE\ Oil THE STATUTE BOOKS. I'MI QUITE RELAXED ABOUT IT ALL.<br />
ENDS. 4 </p>
