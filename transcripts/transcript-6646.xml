SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE EXTENSION TO THE<br />
MT PRITCHARD AND DISTRICT COMMUNITY CLUB LIMITED<br />
MT PRITCHARD 9 JUNE 1985<br />
Mr President, Mr Grace, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It was with much pleasure that I accepted your<br />
invitation to perform the official opening of the<br />
extensions to this magnificent club. Ted Grace had<br />
extolled the Club's virtues so strongly that I had to<br />
come to see for myself the progress you have made in . the<br />
development of your club.<br />
Looking around at what has been accomplished, members,<br />
directors and staff can all be proud of the giant<br />
strides that have been made since the opening of the<br />
club in 1961.<br />
The transformation of what was then the Mt Pritchard<br />
Workers Club established in some old huts, into the<br />
magnificent edifice we see today is truly remarkable. </p>
<p>Three features characterise your club, namely:<br />
You have kept your original premises, a reminder of<br />
your humble beginnings;<br />
You have retained your initial patron, Gough<br />
Whitlam, a continuing reminder of your Labor roots<br />
( Gough incidentally officially opened the club<br />
under its new name in 1968); and<br />
You continue to fulfil the promise, enshrined in<br />
your club's name, of serving the local community.<br />
Since the fifties licensed clubs in New South Wales have<br />
undergone a remarkable expansion both in suburban and<br />
country districts. Although many clubs have retained<br />
their specialist nature, there has been an evolution to<br />
the larger clubs such as your own which can rightly be<br />
considered community centres.<br />
Recognition of clubs such as your own as community<br />
centres is, I think, very impprtant.<br />
Clubs such as this can be a focal point where people of<br />
quite diverse background can be at one with each other<br />
in a relaxed environment. </p>
<p>Clubs' importance in our communities is highlighted by<br />
the fact that the community they serve is a microcosm<br />
of the pluralist society that Australia has become.<br />
One of Australia's greatest strengths has been its<br />
acceptance of people from quite diverse nationalities<br />
around the world.<br />
Our plurality and diversity is a national asset to be<br />
cherished and safeguarded.<br />
We live in a society which, while supporting a common<br />
group of institutions, legal rights and obligations<br />
leaves individuals free to maintain their particular<br />
religion, language and customs. In this way local<br />
communities, such as your own, contribute to the<br />
richness and traditions of our nation.<br />
In an important sense of national unity can only exist<br />
where individuals feel at home within their local<br />
community. In this respect clubs such as this play a<br />
crucial role.<br />
They bring men and women, young and old, people of<br />
diverse ethnic and economic'backgrounds, together. Many<br />
people now share in the recreational and leisure<br />
possibilities presented by the clubs. </p>
<p>Here in Australia we have seen developed, over time, a<br />
strong network of voluntary organisations which carry<br />
out a range of activities vital to the health of the<br />
community. Their role is indispensable in a society<br />
such as our own.<br />
Our clubs are an essential focus for such activities.<br />
In this regard, the bricks and mortar are basic<br />
ingredients to providing facilities, but the really<br />
important role of the club is to provide services first<br />
to its members but also to the wider community.<br />
Gone, hopefully, are the days where larger clubs were<br />
just poker machine and beer palaces. Clubs such as<br />
yours are now community and social centres providing<br />
entertainment, and a venue for functions and meetings<br />
both of your own sports clubs and outside organisations.<br />
Clubs such as yours not only serve as a focus for some<br />
of these activities; they should also be developing new<br />
directions and dimensions for local involvement.<br />
Let me give you an example.<br />
This International -Youth Year is a good time to look at<br />
the needs of the younger people in our community. I<br />
know the Fairfield City area has a very high youth<br />
population. I am sure there are ways in which this Club<br />
could examine support for young people in things such as<br />
low-cost recreation, health, legal help, accommodation,<br />
or transport. I invite you to consider the challenge. </p>
<p>This Club could, for example, examine how best to make<br />
its facilities available for use by young people in the<br />
local area. In this regard I believe there is a<br />
particular need for services for young women. I am<br />
certain you could think of many other ways of<br />
contributing to the youth of the Fairfield area.<br />
Celebrations such as you are holding today give everyone<br />
concerned an opportunity to reflect on the direction of<br />
the club and the contribution it is making to its<br />
members and the community.<br />
It is in this spirit that I have much pleasure in<br />
declaring these extensions open, and extend my best<br />
wishes for the future activities of the club. </p>
