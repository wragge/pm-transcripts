PRIME MMSITER<br />
Thursday, 23 September 1982 FOR MEDIA<br />
TAX AVOIDANCE REPORTS REBUTTAL<br />
In some recent newspaper and other media coverage, it has been<br />
said or implied or suggested that I was aware in 1977 of the<br />
existence of Bottom of the Harbour taxation schemes.<br />
Statements to that effect are wholly and demonstrably false<br />
and those responsible were guilty at the least of the grossest<br />
of negligence.<br />
To set the record straight the position is as follows<br />
On 15 July 1977 I wrote to the Treasurer drawing his attention to<br />
a paper which had been prepared by a person outside the Government<br />
and that set out a number of tax avoidance schemes which were said<br />
to be in current use. I said believe that the documents should<br />
be examined most urgently and that if the schemes are correctly<br />
described we should be looking at appropriate legislation at<br />
the earliest date".<br />
During 1978 and 1979 many of the schemes outlined in the list<br />
I forwarded to the Treasurer in July 1977 were legislated against.<br />
The paper on which I sought an urgent examination set out<br />
particulars of 13 tax schemes including one which was described<br />
as " sale of companies with current profits".<br />
None of these schemes were Bottom of the Harbour schemes.<br />
The scheme which has been seized on by elements of the media,<br />
namely the one just referred to, was described as one in which<br />
the company broker, once acquiring the company with company<br />
pro fits, injects tax losses into the company to avoid existing<br />
company tax liability. Schemes of that kind were legislated<br />
against with effect from 8 A1 pril1978 that is, within 9<br />
months of my 15 July 1.977 1-0tter t-thc! Troasurer.<br />
I find it difficult to understand how any informed person acting<br />
in good faith could have so misunderstood what was so clearly set<br />
forth in the tabled documents on this subject.<br />
