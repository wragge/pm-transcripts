PRIME MiNiSTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 DECEMBER 1977<br />
STATEMENT TO PRESS CONFERENCE, KIRRIBILLI HOUSE, SYDNEY<br />
This election contest has been hard fought. Opposing policies<br />
and proposals have been argued over in detail across Australia.<br />
People have a clear choice in this election between the<br />
consistent, coherent and responsible policies of the Liberal<br />
National Party Government and Labor's policies.<br />
We have laid the framework for a real advance into the future<br />
in which Australia can be an example to the world. In which<br />
we can'establish an economy we can be proud of, social justice<br />
for all Australians, care and concern for the disadvantaged,<br />
encouragement for initiative and reward for achievement.<br />
It has sometimes been a hard road getting to that point, because<br />
of the situation we faced when we came to Government. But<br />
our policies are working.<br />
A vote for the Government will take Australia forward confidently<br />
into the future, into a new period of prosperity and development.<br />
During election periods, there is a tendency to divide this<br />
great nation, and in politics-too often people seek to divide<br />
where they ought not. They bring issues, that should not be<br />
matters of Party political debate-, into the political arena.<br />
All Australians, in whatever office they may hold and wherever._<br />
they may be, have a duty to reach out beyond the bounds of<br />
politics, to seek to understand and to define those issues<br />
that unite Australia as one people with a common purpose and<br />
commrdn-objectives, so--that: we. may achieve a greater, a better,<br />
a more just society.<br />
-The-most important thing now for Australians is to have this<br />
country well governed.-We need to emphasise those things~ that<br />
unite us, not those that divide us.<br />
We have an excellent chance now to push through into the 1980' s<br />
and beyond with a new found cqnfidence; a new found spirit, a<br />
new sense of security and a new sense of national purpose. By<br />
going beyond political conflicts to the real basis of shared<br />
values and shared interests we can work together in<br />
a single minded and united effort to make Australia the great<br />
country we know it can be.<br />
The Government asks Australians for their support on December<br />
for their help in doing the job of building a better Australia. </p>
