<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, welcome to Adelaide. Great to speak to you on Friday,</p>
<p>   and good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning to you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So far, can you give me an impression of how you think the electorate,</p>
<p>   not the media, the electorate is receiving your package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well so far I think there is enormous interest, there's a</p>
<p>   recognition that this is not just a tax cut, it's much bigger</p>
<p>   than that. This is about remaking the tax system for the longer</p>
<p>   term benefit of Australia. Of boosting our economic performance,</p>
<p>   of giving people greater incentive and also cheapening our exports</p>
<p>   and generally helping business to operate better. So it's a</p>
<p>   big long term plan, it's not just about a tax cut.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, this morning we have been taking calls from our listeners,</p>
<p>   many of whom are feeling really reassured, others are quite jaundiced</p>
<p>   and disappointed. Those who seem to feel as though the tax will</p>
<p>   be bad for them are those on low incomes, very close to pension</p>
<p>   areas. Can you reassure low income earners listening at the moment</p>
<p>   that the compensations will make up for the increases in price?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can give that assurance. The compensation is well above,</p>
<p>   it's at least 1.5 per cent above the calculated price impact.</p>
<p>   We have deliberately decided that the pension, for example, and</p>
<p>   all the other social security payments will go up by 4 per cent</p>
<p>   on the first of July 2000 when the plan comes into effect and will</p>
<p>   remain 1.5 per cent at least above any increases in the consumer</p>
<p>   price index. So what we're doing is we're fully compensating</p>
<p>   people for the price effect of the goods and services tax on top</p>
<p>   of that we're throwing in another 1.5 per cent for good measure</p>
<p>   for further reassurance. Now that's for people who rely entirely</p>
<p>   on the pension. If they have other sources of income, we have got</p>
<p>   these savings and investment bonuses for both pensioners and self</p>
<p>   funded retirees. We're getting rid of provisional tax. We have</p>
<p>   deliberately skewed the tax cuts so that the proportionate gains</p>
<p>   for low income earners are greatest. We're cutting, we're</p>
<p>   increasing the tax free threshold to $6,000 and we're cutting</p>
<p>   the bottom rate from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. Now that is proportionately</p>
<p>   more help to somebody on a low income than to somebody on a high</p>
<p>   income.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on other issues specifically raised by our listeners</p>
<p>   this morning. The issue of banking, now details are not yet available</p>
<p>   to us. But can you explain if we will end up paying more for our</p>
<p>   banking services?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No you will not end up paying more for your banking services. Well</p>
<p>   to start with the financial institutions duty and the bank accounts</p>
<p>   debits taxes are going to be completely abolished. Now can I say</p>
<p>   that again. They are going to be completely abolished. Those aggravating</p>
<p>   little entries you get on your bank statement every month or whenever</p>
<p>   you get your bank statement, they're going to go out because</p>
<p>   one of the conditions about us giving the GST to the States is that</p>
<p>   they've got to get rid of those taxes. So there's no way</p>
<p>   on earth against that background that the cost of banking services</p>
<p>   can go up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the media are speculating that you and your Government</p>
<p>   will be watching very carefully to see how we are all receiving</p>
<p>   this, and that will determine the election time. We have heard you</p>
<p>   this morning saying I don't want to talk about that yet. Are</p>
<p>   we talking, however, about an election being called within a month</p>
<p>   do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Julia, I have no idea when the election is going to be. I have</p>
<p>   not turned my mind to the date of the next election. My sole mission</p>
<p>   in life now is to explain the benefits of this plan to the Australian</p>
<p>   people. It is a long term plan to make Australia stronger economically,</p>
<p>   to generate more jobs and to help our export performance and to</p>
<p>   generally further strengthen the Australian economy in a time of</p>
<p>   international challenge. That's my aim in life at the moment.</p>
<p>   The election of course will be at some stage. I haven't decided</p>
<p>   when and I won't be deciding when for some time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is this the most risky moment of your political life?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I don't look at it in a personal sense. I am certainly</p>
<p>   very proud to lead a Government that has had the guts to put forward</p>
<p>   a visionary plan that will help the long term economic future of</p>
<p>   the country. I am really very proud of that and I am very proud</p>
<p>   of all the support I have had from my colleagues, particularly the</p>
<p>   Treasurer, who has worked very hard with me on this plan, and it's</p>
<p>   a moment of great importance to the country and that's far</p>
<p>   more important than my own personal feelings on the subject.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We were discussing with Senator Meg Lees this morning and our listeners</p>
<p>   how to keep the 10 per cent at 10 per cent and I am sure you are</p>
<p>   very aware that she has given cautious approval to your system,</p>
<p>   although she says it's still very hard to keep it down. She</p>
<p>   also mentioned the black economy. You have budgeted quite a bit</p>
<p>   of money coming out of the black economy, she says that doesn't</p>
<p>   work, countries with a GST elsewhere seen an increase in the black</p>
<p>   economy. Can you reassure us that money will come back?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is not the advice that we had from the experts. The advice</p>
<p>   that we had from the experts was that the introduction of a goods</p>
<p>   and services tax, plus a number of other measures that we have introduced,</p>
<p>   it's not just a goods and services tax but plus a number other</p>
<p>   compliance measures we have brought in, will result in tax now not</p>
<p>   being paid being paid in the future. The experience that I've</p>
<p>   been told of in relation to New Zealand and other places has been</p>
<p>   quite good as far as the black economy is concerned. You have got</p>
<p>   to remember that the proposal that we are putting forward is more</p>
<p>   failsafe in relation to the black economy than some of the systems</p>
<p>   overseas. It's more effective and more comprehensive and therefore</p>
<p>   more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, as we leave you at the airport and a busy day in</p>
<p>   Adelaide and a busy weekend with Liberal Party business, you are</p>
<p>   sounding tired this morning if I may say, how's the energy?</p>
<p>   There's a big sell ahead isn't there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The energy levels very high perhaps the line's a bit thin.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could well be. We will obviously see and hear much more of you</p>
<p>   later in the day. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you. Bye bye.</p>
