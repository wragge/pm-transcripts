    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Australia stands at the cross roads.</p>
<p>We've witnessed a shift in our economic interests from America and Europe to Asia in a single generation.</p>
<p>We're seeing shares of employment and activity move towards services and high tech production</p>
<p>We're seeing our dollar rise to sustained high levels due to our commodity exports and confidence in our currency and bonds.</p>
<p>It is a major structural realignment of our economy; an externally-led change as big as any we have seen in 200 years.</p>
<p>Like the 1980s, it is a time to choose.</p>
<p>To chart a conscious and deliberate pathway to sustained prosperity, or face the alternative of mediocre growth or even decline.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the mining boom gave us a moment of complacency.</p>
<p>But the post-GFC world has made it clear we cannot cruise along any more.</p>
<p>The world of easy money and easy choices that prevailed until 2008 is gone and won't be coming back.</p>
<p>We are in an era of deleveraging.</p>
<p>An era of savings, surpluses and balance-sheet repair.</p>
<p>An era of falling tax revenues and tough fiscal choices.</p>
<p>An era when the baby boomers have begun to retire.</p>
<p>This is a more austere and demanding world where only the resilient and the nimble will prosper.</p>
<p>Growth will not come easily.</p>
<p>Every percentage point of GDP will be hard-won.</p>
<p>Yes there is opportunity in the mining boom and in the relentless rise of Asia's middle class.</p>
<p>But we can only take advantage of those opportunities if we renew the productivity drive that made us so successful in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>The high road.</p>
<p>So that people buying our products and services don't ask how much they are but how good they are.</p>
<p>Taking us into the league of countries like Germany, Sweden, Singapore and Israel where high value, high quality is a way of life.</p>
<p>Let's be clear, though, on what productivity means.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean taking a few dollars out of workers' pockets or eroding protections that bring them dignity and security.</p>
<p>And it doesn't mean hard-working employees working even harder.</p>
<p>In a mature, sophisticated economy like ours, the biggest single source of productivity will come from only one place: capital deepening.</p>
<p>Physical capital  -  the infrastructure and equipment that enables us to achieve more.</p>
<p>Like unleashing the power of broadband through the NBN.</p>
<p>Completing the duplication of the Pacific Highway.</p>
<p>Upgrading our national freight rail network.</p>
<p>Unclogging our cities through massive new transport infrastructure like the Regional Rail line in Melbourne.</p>
<p>And we're working towards linking the rapidly expanding resources sector in New South Wales to Port Kembla via the long-deferred Maldon to Dumbarton freight line.</p>
<p>It's a huge agenda, and no government has done more in these areas since Federation than ours.</p>
<p>The other part of the picture is human capital  -  in other words, people and skills.</p>
<p>Nothing is more important to Australia's future economic success than skills development.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Skills are the lifeblood of a modern economy and the key to a more prosperous future.</p>
<p>Skills are central to ensuring that we have the workforce needed to deliver the innovative, high quality products and services that will power our economy this century.</p>
<p>Economic modelling by KPMG Econotech shows that the Government's skills targets could lift Australia's GDP by up to 2.6 per cent each year between 2025 and 2040.</p>
<p>It would boost employment by 1.2 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p>For individuals, achieving recognised qualifications is one of the best ways to secure a job and earn a decent wage.</p>
<p>In a changing economy, skills also build resilience.</p>
<p>They provide workers with the flexibility to change jobs, apply skills in different contexts and go on learning.</p>
<p>They enable employees to manage the demands of new systems and new technologies.</p>
<p>As our economy continues to change, having the right skills, and the ability to apply those skills in the right settings,will be critical.</p>
<p>A few moments ago I used the phrase âhuman capitalâ.</p>
<p>It's a dry economic term but what we are really talking about is liberating the creative capacity of individuals.</p>
<p>Giving them the opportunity to change their lives for the better.</p>
<p>Whether it's a kid in the suburbs who has no other social or economic advantages.</p>
<p>An older worker looking to change fields or overcome the challenge of redundancy.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a single mum wanting to return to the workforce.</p>
<p>In the past it was easy for students to leave Year 9 and 10 without further qualifications due to the abundance of unskilled jobs or career pathways that didn't require formal skills.</p>
<p>But now, and increasingly in the future, individuals without qualifications will simply be forced to compete for a diminishing pool of low-skill, low wage jobs, or else face the demoralising prospect of unemployment.</p>
<p>That's not the future I want for any Australian.</p>
<p>I want a future where Australians have the opportunity to get new skills and a new opportunity to create a better life for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>That's why I refer to the power of education as being transformative.</p>
<p>Transformative for individuals and transformative for society.</p>
<p>To date, this government has covered a huge amount of ground in early childhood, schools and university education.</p>
<p>In universities, we've moved to a demand-driven system that has already resulted in 150,000 extra university places.</p>
<p>More than 40 per cent of young women now have a bachelors degree or higher, achieving a large part of our target more than a decade ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>We are well on track to achieve our target of 40 per cent of people aged 25 to 34 holding a bachelors degree or higher by 2025, with more children from poorer families getting a chance.</p>
<p>We're making sure that all Australian children have the opportunity to reap the rewards of a quality early childhood education through universal access to preschool.</p>
<p>In schools, we've put in place My School, we're devolving power to local school principals and communities, and boosting teacher quality.</p>
<p>We're introducing the National Curriculum and charting a pathway to a better way of funding schools through the Gonski review.</p>
<p>The next wave of reform must be in the area of skills.</p>
<p>This is the missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Since 2008, our nation has been committed to ambitious targets for skilling Australians:</p>
<p> * 	Doubling the number of qualification completions at diploma and advanced diploma levels<br />
 * 	Halving the proportion of Australians of working age  without a Certificate III qualification or higher by 2020, and<br />
 * 	Increasing the proportion of young Australians aged 20 to 24 attaining Year 12 or Certificate II to 90 per cent by 2015.</p>
<p>Already we have 460,000 doing a trade apprenticeship or a traineeship  -  with more people studying a trade than ever before in Australia's history.</p>
<p>But we need to go further to make our training goals a reality.</p>
<p>So today I am pleased to announce a new major package of reforms.</p>
<p>A skills blueprint to meet the demands of the Asian Century.</p>
<p>A plan to help Australians gets jobs, learn new skills to get better jobs and to build a more competitive business environment.</p>
<p>Friends, the package I launch today is a plan for better, more timely access to training places.</p>
<p>But also better quality training.</p>
<p>Fairer funding of training.</p>
<p>More flexible and innovative delivery of training.</p>
<p>It is a plan that is mindful of the central place that TAFE plays in our training system and indeed in our national imagination.</p>
<p>Our TAFEs are essential public institutions that have a presence in every region and collectively deliver 80 per cent of VET training.</p>
<p>TAFE is known for its sophisticated technical educationand its ability to reach those in our community who are marginalised.</p>
<p>Our plan encompasses TAFE and all of vocational education, and it starts with this simple proposition: skills are no longer an optional extra but a necessity.</p>
<p>In the new economy we are creating, few Australians can or should be left to embark on their working lives without skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>The economy needs it; our vision for a fairer nation demands it.</p>
<p>Today 4.1 million working Australians do not have the skills necessary for entry to the key growth sectors of our economy.</p>
<p>These workers earn up to $10,000 a year less than their more skilled peers.</p>
<p>They have an employment rate of less than 60 per cent.</p>
<p>And they get locked out of new opportunities because demand for jobs with high-level skills is running at 2.5 times the rate of unskilled jobs.</p>
<p>Put simply, they are less likely to have a job.</p>
<p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>The jobs of the future are jobs that require skills:</p>
<p>Advanced manufacturing, taking us up the value-chain.</p>
<p>Clean energy.</p>
<p>Mining, building and construction.</p>
<p>Financial and property services.</p>
<p>Child care, aged and disability care.</p>
<p>Nursing and allied health.</p>
<p>New media, culture and design.</p>
<p>These are the growth areas of today and tomorrow, and every single one of them requires skills.</p>
<p>So our plan begins with measures to increase the accessibility of training places in the community.</p>
<p>As a result of our reform plan, every working age Australian will be entitled to a taxpayer-funded training place to obtain a qualification up to and including Certificate III, including language and literacy courses.</p>
<p>Any one from Year 10 to retirement age will be able to obtain one of these places.</p>
<p>This is our National Training Entitlement for every Australian.</p>
<p>Why Certificate III?</p>
<p>Because research tells us this is the threshold qualification that really makes a difference.</p>
<p>It's the qualification that provides a noticeable boost to income.</p>
<p>The first qualification that begins admitting holders into the professions like child care or aged care.</p>
<p>But friends, we know this development on its own is not enough.</p>
<p>Many more Australians will aspire to higher qualifications and they deserve every encouragement to do so.</p>
<p>But the upfront costs can deter many in our community, especially those from modest circumstances.</p>
<p>So today I can announce a new plan to bring to our vocational sector the benefits that interest-free deferred loans have long brought to university participation.</p>
<p>Think of it as being like HECS for Skills.</p>
<p>At last, VET diploma students will get the same rights that university students have had for years:</p>
<p> * 	No upfront fees<br />
 * 	Access to an interest-free loan to pay for their study<br />
 * 	Only having to pay that loan back once their income reaches a certain level.</p>
<p>Remember university students have enjoyed the benefits of HECS for 23 years.</p>
<p>With these reforms, VET will no longer be the poor relation.</p>
<p>More opportunities to train, funded more fairly.</p>
<p>That's what is on offer today.</p>
<p>But we know these measures on their own are not enough.</p>
<p>We can't pour extra money and extra places into a patchy and inflexible system.</p>
<p>So we also need a focus on quality and a focus on transparency.</p>
<p>Already we've established the Australian Skills Quality Authority to promote higher standards amongst the nation's 5000 training organisations.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is also moving to review and improve these standards through the National Skills Standards Council.</p>
<p>But we need to go further.</p>
<p>To this end, our reform package includes a number of measures designed to support the delivery of high quality VET training.</p>
<p>We will work with the States and Territories to ensure the qualifications delivered by the VET sector are independently assessed over the next two years.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth will require all jurisdictions to ensure only quality providers with an established record can access public funding.</p>
<p>And we will require the States and Territories to set out a plan for navigating their TAFE systems through these reforms so that the important role of public providers is maintained.</p>
<p>It is in everyone's interests that TAFE remains at the centre of our VET system.</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>There's one final piece of the picture and that is the role of students, especially the information and support they receive.</p>
<p>We've seen how My School and My Hospital are helping to bring choice and transparency to school education and hospital care.</p>
<p>The VET sector trains 1.8 million students a year, so it merits the same open and accountable approach.</p>
<p>Under the government's reforms, we will establish a single website, My Skills, so people can have vital information on training courses and training providers.</p>
<p>Over time, the My Skills website will provide individuals and employers with real time information on things like course options, employment outcomes, audit reports and fees.</p>
<p>We want business and individuals to have ready access to information that will allow them to choose the training organisation that best suits their needs.</p>
<p>We also recognise that such a big and diverse sector can be hard for students to navigate.</p>
<p>So we will introduce a Unique Student Identifier, a single ID number that will enable students to track the skills and qualifications they have achieved.</p>
<p>It will bring all their training history together in a single, portable record making moving courses or providers easier.</p>
<p>It was also make it simpler for them to obtain recognition of prior training and skills when they enrol in a new course.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will be asking the States and Territories to do more when it comes to student retention and learning outcomes.</p>
<p>We want to re-set the benchmark of achievement in training.</p>
<p>A test of this reform will be not just how many students sign up for training  -  but how many complete.</p>
<p>At the moment only 30 per cent of students, on average, complete a VET course.</p>
<p>That is an enormous waste of public funds, a big loss of potential skills, and a human tragedy as well.</p>
<p>With better approaches to training content and delivery, teaching quality and student support, I believe we can vastly increase the completion of VET qualifications.</p>
<p>Indeed we are negotiating measures with the States and Territories to ensure that around 375,000 additional students will complete their qualification over the next five years.</p>
<p>Friends, these are Australian Government proposals that come with the endorsement of my Cabinet and my own lifelong commitment to the importance of education.</p>
<p>But the truth is the States and Territories remain the majority funder for VET training and share a profound interest in delivering quality outcomes.</p>
<p>So these are reforms requiring the support and endorsement of the whole Federation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I will be presenting these proposals to my fellow First Ministers at the COAG meeting on April 13.</p>
<p>I present them in a spirit of bipartisanship and goodwill.</p>
<p>They are proposals designed in the national interest and I look forward to having a fruitful conversation with my State and Territory colleagues.</p>
<p>In approaching the COAG table, I won't come empty handed.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Commonwealth, I will offer the States and Territories $7.2 billion over five years to underpin Australia's training system.</p>
<p>In addition, we have another $1.75 billion to support and drive these new reforms.</p>
<p>To which will be added funds unlocked by VET FEE-HELP, potentially amounting to $155 million each year, which will help underwrite the National Training Entitlement.</p>
<p>Together these measures almost double the level of funding the Government inherited in 2007.</p>
<p>So it can be fairly said that our nation's long neglect of vocational education is at an end.</p>
<p>A huge new piece of the Government's plans for the nation's future falls into place today.</p>
<p>We have ambitious goals and they are necessarily bold:</p>
<p>To make every school a great school.</p>
<p>To make every university a great university.</p>
<p>To skill every Australian who can and wants to be skilled.</p>
<p>To ensure no employer creates a job without someone qualified and equipped to fill it.</p>
<p>No longer will personal means or a lack of training opportunities be a barrier or an excuse.</p>
<p>We will have a supply of training places sufficient to meet the needs and opportunities of the future.</p>
<p>Training underpinned by quality, flexibility and transparency.</p>
<p>This skills package is a huge breakthrough for business and employees as we shape the new economy.</p>
<p>It sits alongside our reforms in clean energy, broadband and tax redesign as the building blocks to equip our nation for the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>It's also a satisfying moment on my own journey in public life, so let me conclude with this reflection.</p>
<p>I am honoured to lead a movement that was founded in 1891  -  Australia's oldest political tradition.</p>
<p>It was begun by a group of workers and small businessmen who laid out a simple 16-point plan as their first platform.</p>
<p>One of those items was a commitment to âFree, compulsory, and technical education, higher as well as elementary, to be extended to all alike.â</p>
<p>Universal schooling was achieved quickly in the final decades of the 19th century.</p>
<p>But in university and VET, it's taken more than a century to achieve this promise.</p>
<p>Only now, under this government since 2007, is broad access to university and high-level vocational education  -  free at the point of use and driven by demand  -  being delivered and assured</p>
<p>They are reforms that will shape and sustain our nation for decades to come.</p>
<p>Reforms that position us to be winners in the Asian Century.</p>
<p>A race our nation cannot afford to lose. </p>
