FOR PRESS P. M. No 21/ 1970<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
From the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
This year our National Day has a special significance.<br />
Just two hundred years ago Captain Cook made his voyage of discovery<br />
along our east coast. And eighteen years later the arrival of the<br />
First Fleet set the date which we observe as our National Day.<br />
On this day we can look back on our history and draw<br />
hope and inspiration from dangers and difficulties overcome.<br />
And we can reflect on tasks ahead of us and what we<br />
should write on the blank pages of history yet to be.<br />
In the seventies and with thought for what we would<br />
wish our country to be at the turn of the century, we can, each<br />
of us, reflect on present opportunities and the best method of<br />
realiging them. Each of us, if we invest time, thought, goodwill<br />
and effort, can share in the task of building a nation materially<br />
rich, offering self-development to all, and contributing to the<br />
welfare of the world community.<br />
We have come far in the last two hundred years.<br />
The spirit and endurance of those who ensured this<br />
progress will, I am sure, persist, and will accelerate progress<br />
in the future.<br />
CANBERRA 24 January 1970 </p>
