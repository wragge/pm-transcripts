    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: It's great to be here at the Garvan, great to be back in Sydney, and great to be back at this extraordinary centre of excellence for research, but also work which is done for patients suffering from cancer.</p>
<p>We're here today to confirm what the Australian Government has decided to do more broadly across the nation, and that is to have a dominant funding role in the future of our hospitals, the future of our teaching and research facilities and the future of the running costs of them.</p>
<p>In the past, if we're looking at something like Garvan or looking at something like a major public hospital, the Australian Government would contribute not one dollar - not one dollar. In the future, under the reform plan that we have put forward, the Australian Government for the first time in history will take on the dominant funding role for the building of these great institutions and also for their teaching role, their research role, as well as their running costs.</p>
<p>That is a core difference.</p>
<p>In the past, the Australian Government saying 'we have nothing to do with the building of these great and important medical institutions'. In the future, we're saying 'we will take on the dominant funding role.'</p>
<p>Which brings us back to what's happening here today. Our contribution to this great centre, as it be and unfold, is some $70 million, and it represents of itself some 60-70 per cent of the construction costs of this great centre.</p>
<p>This is an important step forward. Cancer remains the number one killer across Australia. We have to make great steps forward, great leaps forward, when it comes to translational research, bringing together patients, researchers, the clinicians, those who are dealing with complementary medicine and palliative care on what is called the entire patient journey. That's what translational research is about, that's what translational medicine is about, that's what this centre is going to be about as well.</p>
<p>And, you know, it's the way of the future - it's the way of dealing with the challenges of cancer, it's the way of dealing with other disease challenges as well. So the Australian Government's proud to be part, and a big part, of this initiative in cancer care for Sydney, for New South Wales and beyond.</p>
<p>But it is the first step of what we, the Australian Government, will be doing nation-wide when it comes to the building of the hospitals and the research institutions of the future.</p>
<p>Nicola will add, and then I'll take your questions.</p>
<p>MINISTER ROXON: Thank you. Look, I just want to add to the Prime Minister's comments and congratulate Bill and John, the chairman and CEO of the Garvan Institute and the large amount of staff that seem to have joined us. Congratulations on putting together such a good proposal. The Government was delighted to announce in the budget last year that we would fund a $70 million contribution to the new cancer centre, and the Prime Minister and I have just been at St Vincent's Hospital.</p>
<p>Thank you to the team there for showing us around, and we went to the ambulatory cancer ward, the chemotherapy treatments, and just as an example of what an investment from the Commonwealth can do, that very good facility will be increased in capacity by about 50 per cent when it's able to move into the new facility, moving, of course, clinicians and researchers closer together, providing better treatment for patients and having a significant contribution from the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>We see that our investments and our strategic plans can deliver that sort of outcome across the country, and we're very pleased to be able to be using this example to highlight the announcements not just about the 60 per cent dominant contribution from the Commonwealth for recurrent funding, but also for research training and capital, a key part of the announcement that we made earlier this week.</p>
<p>PM: Lastly, I look up at the faces of all these researchers and staff here at the Garvan, I think what they would want to see is the Australian Government putting a step forward and funding these sorts of institutes in the future. That's what we intend to do.</p>
<p>Okay folks, over to you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: There are reports today that more than 100 hospitals will have to close under your plan. What's your response to that?</p>
<p>PM: Those reports are absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is nothing in the Australian Health and Hospital Network which would justify the closure of a single hospital or a single hospital bed.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I'd say this: if you have state health bureaucrats running around the country running a fear campaign about this reform plan for the future, I think it speaks for itself. Remember, these state health bureaucrats running a fear campaign, well, that's interesting. I think the thing the Australian people are really frightened of is the same state health bureaucrats being allowed to run the system in the future.</p>
<p>They've had plenty of time to fix it up until now. We're going to get on with fixing it for the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The New South Wales Government (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: Look, why the New South Wales health bureaucrats are out there saying these sort of things - matter for them .You can sort that out. I know where the Australian Government's going, and that is to build the health and hospital system we need for the future, the network we need for the future, funded nationally, run locally, to deliver better health and better hospitals for the Australian people.</p>
<p>Too many state bureaucrats, too many state politicians, too many oppositionists all out there saying 'too hard, too complicated, push it off to one side', but time for that's over. We've got to get on, bite the bullet and bring about the changes we need for the future.</p>
<p>For the first time in the history of the Federation, the Australian Government taking on the dominant funding role for the future of our hospitals - their buildings, their operating theatres, their research and teaching, as well as their running costs.</p>
<p>That is a major reform for the future, and frankly, given the explosion in health costs for the future, it's the only way to go.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: You've got to really win the states over with this plan. This is hardly the most conciliatory approach, is it?</p>
<p>PM: Well, you know something? We have spent a year and a half developing a blueprint through Christine Bennett and her reform commission. We then spent six months road-testing her recommendations with hospitals right across the country. There's 764 public hospitals in Australia, and the Health Minister and I have been to 101 of them. I've done 21, she's done most of the rest, but you know something? The feedback on the ground from local doctors, local nurses, local clinicians, wanting to have the authority and the certainty of a funding stream to do their best for their communities - it's huge.</p>
<p>And I'd say to state health bureaucrats and disgruntled state politicians and other opposition types, I think it's time just to get out of the way of fundamental reform. We intend to get on with it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What do you think (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I understand the premier has sent a letter to the Government this morning. I haven't had an opportunity to see it yet. We are always happy to work through matters which need to be clarified further, but let me be very clear - that fundamental direction of our reform is absolutely clear cut. For the first time, a national health and hospital network, funded nationally, run locally, to deliver better health, better hospitals for the Australian people.</p>
<p>Too many people have said for far too long we need to change the system. Well, we've come up with a blueprint for change. We're going to have a tough fight on our hands, but we will not shrink from it for one minute.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What do you say to the people who say that this is really not the best approach that could be taken? They're criticising you for the way you (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: Well, it's a democracy. People can express their point of view. That's fine.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of a more exhaustive means by which to come up with blueprint for the future - a health and hospital commission working for a year and a half, comprised of representatives from the entire medical profession working their way right across the country, dealing with the professional colleges, the nurses and others, dealing with the individual hospitals, coming up with their blueprint. The Minister and I then going out to 101 hospitals between us, road testing their 123 recommendations with groups of clinicians and specialists right across the country, and then us as a Cabinet deciding on the way ahead for reform. That's pretty comprehensive. That's the right way to do policy.</p>
<p>But, you know something? It's time to get on with it, and again I'd say to all those state health bureaucrats, these state health bureaucrats have had a long, long time to fix the system. They haven't done so.</p>
<p>It's time for a new approach. We put one on the table. This is it, and I'd say to all those who are moaning and groaning about it - it's time to get out of the way of real reform and deliver better health and better hospitals for the Australian people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: One of the inpatients that you spoke to this morning (inaudible) was receiving treatment for cancer and after you'd gone she said that she (inaudible) that she thought most people would be happy to pay more taxes in order to pay for better public health services. Are you counting on that sentiment for when the new taxes come in?</p>
<p>PM: Let me say in response to your question two or three things. The first is the national health and hospitals network that I released at the National Press Club a couple of days ago is fully funded within the existing budget. That's the first point.</p>
<p>The second is, any politician who goes out there and pretends that health care costs are not going to keep going through the roof in the future is not telling you the truth. I don't intend to be part of that.</p>
<p>Thirdly, when it comes to meeting the future costs of the system, we, the Australian Government, will do so within our fiscal discipline, which is not to increase taxes as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. That's been our commitment prior to the election, it's our commitment now, and will be into the future.</p>
<p>Simon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible) there needs to be some clarification, I suppose, on how the loadings could be set for regional and rural areas. It will be an independent umpire that determines those loadings. Can you guarantee, what's the guarantee that those loadings will be sufficient to keep some of those smaller (inaudible) hospitals viable?</p>
<p>PM: The guarantee from the Australian Government is absolute. And that is that the formula which will be developed on the pricing of hospital services will not lead to the closure of any regional, rural or small hospital in the great state of New South Wales or anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>Simon, you know as well as I do this is a fantastic fear campaign being run by state health bureaucrats who don't want change to happen. Well, mate, it's a great story, keep running it, good on you, but you know something - and you're right to run it, because people are saying it to you, full marks to you - but guess what? It's not true, and those who are running it have one interest in mind, which is to block reform.</p>
<p>Guess what? I'm belling the cat on that. That's what they're trying to do. That's the tactics. Not just here, other parts of Australia as well. We intend to get on with the business of reform.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you need the support of the states. How are you going to get them on side?</p>
<p>PM: Well, we will speak directly with the states between now and when the Council of Australian Governments convenes in the first part of April. I have written to all the state Premiers and the Chief Ministers. I have telephoned each of them and there is going to be a huge amount, to use the technical term, of argy bargy between now and when the Council of Australian Governments meets. Some may agree. Some may disagree. Some may agree in part. Some may agree in whole. Some may tell us to jump in the lake. But you know something? That will not stand in our road.</p>
<p>I repeat what I have said before, that this is our proposal, this is our reform plan, we intend to get on with it. If the states and territories can't agree with that, I've also said what the alternative course of action would be.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On another issue, are you worried relations between India and Australia will be further strained (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: This is a really horrible story. I've seen the reports this morning. I heard about this late last night. This is a really horrible story.</p>
<p>The death of any little child causes everyone in this country to stop, pause, think, reflect. If this was a case of murder, there is nothing worse - nothing worse - than the brutal murder of a little child. The authorities are investigating it. We have confidence the authorities will get to the bottom of it. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to the family of this little one.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Stephen Smith is in India at the moment. Have you spoken to him about this?</p>
<p>PM: The Government, through my own foreign policy advisor, has been in contact with Mr Smith while he's been away and of course in relation to this matter as well. We will handle this matter through the appropriate authorities, the appropriate police authorities. It will take the necessary time to get to the bottom of it but get to the bottom of it we will.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: And are you aware of any reaction from the Indian Government to this?</p>
<p>PM: As of now, those matters lie with the Foreign Minister and I will, if there are any further matters to discuss on that, then I'll comment further.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: I was just going to expand on that. Are you concerned there will be further damage -</p>
<p>PM: You know what I'm concerned about? This little boy, this little child. Three years old. That's just horrific.</p>
<p>Let's get the facts around this. If this is murder, it is unspeakable and unthinkable how a little child's life could be taken away like this. Unspeakable and unthinkable.</p>
<p>Let's sort out this case, this person, this human tragedy first, and as for foreign policy, let's deal with that in its due time.</p>
<p>Okay folks, got to run. See you guys.</p>
