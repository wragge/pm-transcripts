    <content><![CDATA[<p>Iâm thrilled to be here at my first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Itâs great to be with David Cameron.</p>
<p>Britain, as David says, is Australiaâs oldest friend. We have so much in common. We have a history. We have so many shared institutions. We have shared values. We have shared interests. This is a very, very close relationship and I look forward to it going from strength to strength in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>Certainly the Commonwealth is an extraordinary association. It's one based not on wealth, geography, not even on necessarily mutual interests but on shared values and I think institutions and associations like this are important in the modern world.</p>
