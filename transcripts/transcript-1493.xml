N13 ZEALA" D TOUR 1967<br />
FILAL PRTS'S CONFERENICE IVEN BY THE PRI MI I mRZr<br />
ON LVI1-4-NE' ZALAND, CIRISTCIURCH AIRPORT<br />
8TH FZ3RUXRY, 1967.<br />
MR. HOLT: tle have reached the hlst stage of this very interestiny<br />
enjoyable and informative visit to NIew 2ealand and shortly we shl<br />
be taking off again for Australia. I am quite certain that for me<br />
and indeed for your Prime Minister it has been a most valuable<br />
visit. I have learned a great deal more about Mew Zealand and in<br />
our intimate talks tngether your Prime Mirister and I have been<br />
aole to exchan-e views on a wide range of matiers, which will be<br />
of assistance o us both in our nolicy formation. The overwhelming<br />
impression I shall be taking back to Australia with me and I am<br />
sure this is shared by all members of the party is an overwhelming<br />
impression of the goodwill * nd friendliness we have ercountered<br />
wherever we have gone a.: o ut this country. There have been quite<br />
spontaneous little groups of people, sometimes pulled up at the<br />
roadside, sometimes in tourist buses. iherever we have gone we<br />
have found that there have been cheerful smiles and happy friendly<br />
xreetin-s. Frankly I haven't heard a sour voice since 1 left<br />
Australia. And this confirms the belief I brought to this country<br />
that our two peoples -are close to ether closer perhaps than any<br />
other two peorle in the world. Iot only is there this definite<br />
friendliness nd warmth of xoodwill but our interests are so closely<br />
linked together thit this ; ill continue down the years ahead.<br />
I didn't have a crowd in the Southlnd or South Island because<br />
Southland has p articular significance for you I know and the only<br />
cloud was that thit derived from the tragic episodes of the past two<br />
days. Even there our sorrow in Australia was so obviously shared by<br />
the people of this country and helped iaga in to emphasise how close.<br />
we are to-e ther. I hive received fLessages of sympathy in respect<br />
of both tiese triagic events from your Prime inister and I appreciate<br />
that, as I am sure will my fellow countrymen.<br />
I am seeing something of the tremendous tourist potential of<br />
these Islands, and I shall be discussing with my own Linister for<br />
Tourist Activities 1a: ys in which the tw countries can work more<br />
closely toether. Your Prime inizter has from me on open invitation<br />
to visit tustralia ' whenriever he can find the opportunity to do so. I<br />
hope thtt there will ue other visits by Ministers riot necessarily<br />
accompanied by the same formality but able as good friends can to<br />
meet informally with us and see for themselves what we are tryin to<br />
do on our own greit Continent. It has been, I repeat, a most valuable<br />
visit and I am griteful to the Prime inister, his Jovernment nd to<br />
all those ah? have assisted so pleasantly in m9king this journey a<br />
profitable, informative and ernjoyaole one.<br />
MR. E BLETON: ' entlemen, any questions?<br />
Q. ( Inaudible, but obviously relting to forthcoming visit by Mr.<br />
J4cEwen). . ell I expect him to be here very soon. I can't put a<br />
nrecise date on it but I hid gathered from him it was likely to be<br />
some time in February, and as to the scope of the discussions t; iere<br />
* aaiih I shall be leavin
-ather from " iembers of your Jovernment ouite the same tone which I<br />
iad detected in some of the editorials -nd some of the statements.<br />
I think there is a , eneral feeling thint the agreement his not been<br />
running for very lo1g. I gave a public assurance that from our<br />
point of view, we wanted it to w-ork to the mutual benei. t of both<br />
countries. . e see in a developing, prospering New Z] e. land opportunities<br />
for our own trade just as we hope you ai 1 find in a growing, prospering / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Australia opportunities for yours. If the agreement isn't working out<br />
in a way that is regarded by both countries as beneficial then you will<br />
find us helpful and constructive in our attitude twards it.<br />
Q. Not only as far as Australia is concerned but defence how<br />
closely will you see the arrangement between New Zealand and<br />
Australia? F. M. I oelieve we have security problems in common in this area.<br />
are the two countries of European civilization in this part of<br />
the world. W'e have opportunities, I oelieve, for trade with the<br />
growing economies of Asia and, in particular, South East Asia, and<br />
those opportunities will be more fully developed if there is an<br />
area at peace. It is the goal of ot of us to do what we can to<br />
produce a negotiated peace that will oe a just and enduring peace<br />
so that where we have to join '' ith others in producin the framework<br />
for peaceful negotiations, then I believe our interests run parallel.<br />
Q. This closeness of our efforts in so many cases, how is this<br />
going to affect our relations between our two countries.<br />
P. M. I am sure we will come close together over the years. Indeed<br />
I am confident myself that this visit ' vith an even deeper friendship<br />
uetween the two Prime iinisters vill make its contribution, as will<br />
the contact made with the TMem. ers of your Jovernment and your people.<br />
There will, I am confident, be a -rowing realisation that we must<br />
stand closely together if ve are to serve our interests in the world.<br />
Q. ' e have waited 15 years, something like that, for an Australian<br />
Prime Minister's visit, now how long will we have to wait before<br />
another one?<br />
P. M. You must have b': en speiking. with someone in the North Island.<br />
They told me in Christchurch they h-ve waited 179 yers for the first<br />
visit of an Australian Prime Minister. It certainly'won't be anything<br />
like 179 and not even 15 before you have another, if I'm allowed to<br />
make a return to what have been very delightful centres that I have<br />
visited in the course of this journey. And of course, after such a<br />
long aosence I must include a visit to the orth in any itinerary<br />
I follow on a subsequent visit.<br />
Q. And finally, Mr. Holt, did iMr. Holyoake indicate any particular<br />
likelihood of any kind tht he would take up your invitation of a<br />
visit to Australia?<br />
P. M. No, not pm-rticularly, but he knows it is there and he doesn't<br />
have to make any long preparation or give us long notice. He will<br />
be welcome any time he feels he can make the journey. And that goes<br />
for his Ministers too.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible).<br />
P. M. As soon as I heard the first outline of the disaster I teleraimmed<br />
to the Premier of the State asking him if help was oeing given ani if<br />
there was any way in which help could ue given. I put a phone call<br />
through to him at the same time but found that I. M. Reece, the Premier,<br />
hid been on a visit to the mainland at the time of the fire. I spoke<br />
to his Deputy, MIr. Fagan, and he gave me details of the loss s 1own<br />
at that point of time. There were then 20 lives lost and 15 to<br />
people not accounted for. It was estimated that some 700 to 800 homes<br />
had been destroyed, as well as several factories, including the Carbide<br />
Factory and the Cascade 3re', ery. Emergency arrrngements have been<br />
made to take care of the homeless in the depots, town halls and that<br />
kind of thing. I asked -hether our Armed Services had oeen called in<br />
to help, but he said they had ueen very helpful yesterday and were<br />
continuin their help, although the fire at that point had been brought<br />
under control. Apparently yesterday there was a wind of 60 miles per<br />
hour blowin and a temDerature of 105 which, of course is very unusual<br />
for Tasmania. Since then I have learned from my own Office which I </p>
<p>contacted in Canberra that my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
had made arrangements for one of our Ministers, Mr. Howson the Minister<br />
for Air, who is also the Minister assisting the Treasurer, to act<br />
as Commonwealth Liaison Minister for purposes of assistance, and we<br />
shall, of course, be looking sympathetically at what can oe done in<br />
this matter. There will be problems of re-employment, re-housing<br />
problems a great variety. It so happens that next week a meeting<br />
had been arranged of the Iremiers of the six States with me, and<br />
this will provide a very convenient opportunity for me to discuss<br />
these matters with them and with the Premier of the State himself.<br />
3ut that is about all I can tell you at this stage. </p>
