For media 31 July 1984<br />
I greatly welcome the announcement by the Victorian State<br />
Government and Alcoa of Australia Limited, that agreement<br />
has been reached on the development of the Portland<br />
Aluminium, Smelter.<br />
This project will be important to sustaining the strong<br />
recovery that is evident in the Victorian economy, and the<br />
Australian economy as a whole.<br />
It is an immensely important project in itself, and will<br />
give a particular lift to the construction and heavy<br />
engineering industries. Construction and heavy engineering<br />
this year have been showing the first stirrings of growth<br />
after a disastrous decline in 1982 and 1983, in the aftermath<br />
of the so-called resources boom.<br />
The agreement between Victoria and Alcoa represents a<br />
creative reconciliation of the interests of the public in<br />
receiving a reasonable return on its resources and capital<br />
commitments, and th6 investors' requirements of a reasonabl~ e<br />
return on their outlays. The arrangements for power pricing<br />
achieve this reconciliation through a formula that shares<br />
equitably the inevitable risks associated with major<br />
export-oriented investment.<br />
The Australian Government sees developments of this type<br />
involving the intensive use of Australian workers' skills,<br />
Australian natural resources, and international markets<br />
in Australia's region and beyond as being critically<br />
important to the industrial restructuring that we need<br />
for sustained long-term growth. Continued expansion of<br />
industries of this type can make a major contribution to<br />
continued rapid employment growth with rising living<br />
standards. Unlike the Fraser government, we do not look to -a boom in a<br />
single sector to make Australia's economic future. We<br />
seek mutually reinforcing growth across many sectors and<br />
industries. And in this broad-based development, the<br />
expansion of highly productive, export-oriented mineral<br />
processing has a crucial part to play. </p>
<p>a 2.<br />
The Australian Government believes that the combination<br />
of stable domestic economic conditions, creative State<br />
Government policies, co-operative industrial relations and<br />
intelligent business management will restore growth to<br />
the important resource and processing industries, and the<br />
related construction and heavy engineering industries,<br />
in the period ahead.<br />
The Portland announcement is an important step. Sunday's<br />
announcement by New South Wales Premier Neville Wran of<br />
a package of measures to revitalise the base metals<br />
industries based on Broken Hill was another. I am confident<br />
of further progress through the year ahead. </p>
