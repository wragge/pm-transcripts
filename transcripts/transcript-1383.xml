COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
APPROPlUATION BILL ( No. 1) 1966-67<br />
SECOND READING<br />
( BUDGET DEBATE)<br />
( From the " Parliamentary Debates," 25th August 1966]<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) [ 9. O].-The House gave the<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Caiwell),<br />
under our Standing Orders, unlimited time<br />
to deal with the Budget. He seized the<br />
occasion to make it a workout for his<br />
election campaign. Indeed, in the latter<br />
portion of his speech he cast aside all<br />
pretence of Budget consideration and gave<br />
us his familiar onslaught on the Government's<br />
military participation in South<br />
Vietnam. Since he speaks as the leader of<br />
the only alternative government which can<br />
be formed from the Parliament his comment,<br />
however wrongheaded it may be in<br />
our view, cannot be ignored, so I speak to<br />
it tonight. He charges the Treasurer ( Mr.<br />
McMahon) and the Government with<br />
having failed completely to face up to their<br />
national responsibilities in defence, education,<br />
health, pensions, housing, northern<br />
development, child endowment, the abolition<br />
of the means test, maternity allowances,<br />
wage and salary justice and control of<br />
prices and interest rates.<br />
Mr. Pollard.-How right he was.<br />
11066/ 66 Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-He always has<br />
been right in the honorable member's eyes,<br />
and I give the honorable member credit<br />
for his loyalty; it is as * rare as it is<br />
refreshing. The implication in the Leader<br />
of the Opposition's speech is that there<br />
is no upper limit to Commonwealth<br />
expenditure. I did not hear him at any<br />
point indicate any direction in which the<br />
Budget provisions should be reduced. I do<br />
not think he argues that any of them should<br />
be reduced. I do not want to misrepresent<br />
' him, but I think that is his position. If<br />
that is so-and he has a list of glittering<br />
undertakings-then all we can assume from<br />
this is that there is no upper limit and<br />
that the sky indeed is the limit. In our<br />
view no responsible government with its<br />
obligation for the wellbeing of the<br />
economy could accept this viewpoint. It<br />
is a view that ignores the huge increase in<br />
expenditure already proposed in this<br />
year's Budget and the increases of recent<br />
years. We heard the honorable gentleman<br />
promise the abolition of the means test,<br />
and it is a very attractive proposal. </p>
<p>Mr. Calwell.-That is right. Attractive<br />
proposals. Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-Did the honorable<br />
gentleman not promise the abolition?<br />
Mr. Calwell.-I suggested attractive<br />
proposals for its abolition.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-The honorable<br />
gentleman talked about the abolition of the<br />
means test as being one of the matters that<br />
the Treasurer had failed to meet.<br />
Mr. Calwell.-That is right.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-The honorable<br />
gentleman made no reference to the cost<br />
of his proposals for the abolition of the<br />
means test. He must be aware that the<br />
complete abolition of the means test would<br />
cost, on present entitlements, $ 300 million.<br />
It would also result in the virtual doubling<br />
of expenditure, now running at the rate of<br />
$ 63 million a year, under the pensioner<br />
medical service. I shall have a little to<br />
say in a moment about social welfare, but<br />
I give these figures as indicating to the<br />
House just how irresponsible is the honorable<br />
gentleman's whole approach. He gave<br />
no indication of what the cost of his alternative<br />
proposals would be on the Budget of<br />
any particular year. We are charged with<br />
not making adequate progress in the affairs<br />
of the economy. Let me point out that<br />
Commonwealth expenditures last year were<br />
more than double the level of ten years<br />
earlier. They rose by $ 600 million in 1965-<br />
66 and they are estimated to increase by<br />
a further $ 600 million to almost $ 6,000<br />
million this year. No responsible government,<br />
I repeat, could superimpose on these<br />
increases further large amounts such as the<br />
Leader of the Opposition appears to have<br />
in his mind. Indeed, the level of Commonwealth<br />
expenditure is a broad indication<br />
of the extent to which the Government is<br />
drawing for its purposes on the resources<br />
available to the community. It must not<br />
draw so heavily as to cripple the private<br />
sector. As a government we have tried to<br />
strike a balance between public and private<br />
spending-a balance which will best promote<br />
the progress and economic wellbeing<br />
of the economy and of the Australiar<br />
people. We have objectives of an economic kind<br />
which are well known. We have mentioned<br />
them in every Budget in recent years. We<br />
have the objective of national growth. We<br />
press on with the development of Australia's<br />
resources. We associate with that,<br />
full employment for our people. We have<br />
a sustained programme, on a large scale,<br />
of immigration with all the pressures that<br />
this adds to an economy which, at present,<br />
' is not merely trying to provide as much<br />
of its own capital facilities as it can but<br />
has to cope with an enormous increase in<br />
our defence provision.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-The Prime Minister<br />
sounds like Blue Hills<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-The honorable<br />
gentleman is much more entertaining, but<br />
much -less sincere, and I am prepared to<br />
leave it on'that footing. We ' have sustained<br />
these objectives quite consistently throughout<br />
our period of office. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition speaks of the lack of confidence<br />
on the part of business in the future growth<br />
of the economy. What of the lack of con-<br />
. fidence if by some miracle a Labour government<br />
were to come into office? What lack<br />
of confidence is there in the community<br />
when on the last quarter's showing our<br />
housing commencements were at the rate<br />
of 113,000 a year and when our people<br />
are enjoying one of the highest standards<br />
of housing to be found anywhere in the<br />
world? No country ' has a higher percentage<br />
of owner occupancy than this country.<br />
Mr. Hayden.-How is private investment<br />
going? Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I will tell the<br />
honorable member in a moment.<br />
Mr. Hayden.-It was half a million<br />
dollars last year.<br />
Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr. Lucock).<br />
-Order! I warn the honorable member<br />
for Oxley.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-No other country<br />
has a higher number of houses containing<br />
five rooms or more. No other country<br />
has a higher percentage of owner occupancy-<br />
70 per cent.-than has Australia. I<br />
mention this because time tonight is not<br />
going to enable me to give many illustrations<br />
of the current state of the economy. </p>
<p>I will have half the time that the Leader<br />
of Opposition was able to take. However,<br />
there we have a barometer indication of<br />
, the current state of the economy. The<br />
present level of unemployment registrations<br />
throughout the whole of Australia is 1.2<br />
per cent. Do honorable gentlemen opposite<br />
regard that as evidence of stagnation? This<br />
is the situation in a year in which-and<br />
there was no acknowledgement of this from<br />
' honorable gentlemen opposite-this country<br />
has, so far as the two principal pastoral<br />
States of the Commonwealth are concerned,<br />
passed through one of the most<br />
serious droughts in our history. We have<br />
some figures about the drought's effect on<br />
our sheep population. During the year our<br />
sheep numbers dropped by 14 million<br />
whereas normally there is an increase of<br />
6 million in the total Of OUr flocks. So in<br />
a year when Australia sustained a total loss<br />
of 20 million sheep our economy went<br />
on almost without fluctuation, with about<br />
99 per cent. of our people regularly in<br />
employment and with work vacancies still<br />
offering. The economy moved on. Only a<br />
few years ago a drought of this degree<br />
would have had disastrous consequences<br />
for the Australian economy, so it is a<br />
measure of the diversification of the Australian<br />
economy and its basic strength that<br />
we were able to come through this difficult<br />
period of adjustment with so little dislocation<br />
in the affairs of most of the citizens<br />
of our country. I am asked about private<br />
investment. Ninety per cent. of the capital<br />
fixed investment in this country is provided<br />
inside Australia itself. Despite our difficulties,<br />
we provided last year-<br />
Mr. Hayden.-Yes, but how much this<br />
year? Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The<br />
honorable member for Oxley should recall<br />
what was said to him by the Chair only<br />
a few -minutes ago.<br />
the eqHlARLD HOLT.-We provided<br />
last year, out of our own savings,<br />
of our gross national product for the<br />
purposes of capital fixed investment. There<br />
as only one country in the world which<br />
exceeds that percentage. It is Japan. It is<br />
of interest to note that in the last year in<br />
which honorable gentlemen opposite were<br />
in office 20 per cent. only was so invested. That was not a bad performance at all at<br />
that time, but ours is a good deal better<br />
than they were able to produce.<br />
There has been talk about stagnation and<br />
lack of development. The honorable member<br />
for Dawson ( Dr. Patterson) is very<br />
eloquent on the lack of development. I<br />
would remind him that I was in Townsville<br />
a couple of weeks ago, going through the<br />
formal ceremonies of launching a major<br />
university and a major military establishment<br />
there, both flowing from the policies<br />
of this Government. Only today, members<br />
of the Government have been sitting in<br />
consultation, with State Ministers to consider<br />
the question whether the Ord River<br />
project should be developed further. I<br />
know that honorable gentlemen opposite<br />
say: " Of course we will develop the Ord.<br />
Of course we will give the Snowy Mountains<br />
Authority an opportunity to carry on<br />
its work. We will jump on every bandwagon<br />
that will -give us one vote tas it<br />
passes In his Budget speech the Leader<br />
of the Opposition offered a whole shooting<br />
box of attractive proposals. Any time honorable<br />
gentlemen opposite can, in a completely<br />
reckless and irresponsible way,<br />
undertake to do something which they<br />
-think will attract a little passing support,<br />
they do not hesitate to do so. Do they<br />
think that the people can be -fooled as<br />
easily as that?<br />
The Leader of the Opposition, in his<br />
Budget speech, said that there had been<br />
no improvement in real wages during our<br />
teryn of office.<br />
Mr. Calwel.-It is completely true, too.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-He repeats<br />
that statement tonight, but it cannot stand<br />
up to the facts. The honorable gentleman<br />
gave the figures for two years, 1964-65<br />
and 1965-66. Well, the Consumer Price<br />
Index had moved 7.5 per cent, over those<br />
two years. The average weekly earnings<br />
per employed male unit-that is the test of<br />
what people are actually -receiving in this<br />
country-had gone up 12.6 per cent. As<br />
we know, the honorable gentleman is never<br />
very happy when making speeches on<br />
Budgets. He does a rather laboured job of<br />
reading an unfamiliar document, and when<br />
he interposes an aside of his own he usually<br />
finds he has fallen into economic error. In<br />
his speech the other night-I have no doubt </p>
<p>that everybody above grade 2 at school<br />
who listened in picked up his error-he<br />
gave figures on this real wage argument<br />
and talked about how the Consumer Price<br />
Index had -risen from 127 to 132.1.<br />
, Mr. Calwell.-They are the figures of a<br />
Government department.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-Yes, but it was<br />
the honorable gentleman who said there<br />
had been a rise of over 5 per cent.' I hope<br />
he does not repeat the error this time. In<br />
the subsequent 12 months he said, the<br />
Consumer Price Index has risen another 3.7<br />
per cent., which means a rise in prices of<br />
nearly 9 per cent. in two years." He also<br />
brought in the food component of the Index,<br />
which he said had risen from 128.5 to<br />
135.9. That was a rise, he said, of over<br />
7 per cent. I think my colleague, the Postmasteir-<br />
General ( Mr. Hulme), would quickly<br />
correct the honorable gentleman's arithmetic<br />
on that. I mention that because the<br />
honorable gentleman went on in the course<br />
of comment to say-<br />
I hate to bore the House with these figures, but<br />
they are important.<br />
One might reasonably ask: If they are as<br />
important as all that, why does he make<br />
errors of 20 per cent. and 25 per cent, in<br />
his recital of them. The increase in the<br />
Consumer Price Index was not 5 per cent.,<br />
or over 5 per cent., as the honorable gentleman<br />
said. Indeed, the arithmetic will quickly<br />
establish this. It was in fact 4 per cent.<br />
So he was 25 per cent, in error there. In<br />
the following year the Index increased by<br />
3.7 per cent., and the honorable gentleman<br />
was out 12 per cent, there. The increase<br />
over the 2-year period referred to by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition was 7.5 per cent.,<br />
so he was 7 per cent, out in that particular<br />
comment. It is not of any great importance,<br />
except that the honorable gentleman himself<br />
said it was important. Of course, the<br />
relativity movements in the Consumer Price<br />
Index is of itself significant in relation to<br />
movements in wages and the standards<br />
of the community.<br />
The honorable gentleman went on then<br />
to talk about the rise in prices and how<br />
this is without control under the Government.<br />
My colleague could point out to him.<br />
that in the last two Budgets this Government<br />
increased taxation by over $ 7 Thillion<br />
on both occasions and that these taxation<br />
Wi 7. increases, falling, as they did, heavily on<br />
consumption items, of course had some<br />
impact on the Consumer Price Index. So<br />
too did the drought, with its effect on meat<br />
prices. What should in all fairness be taken<br />
as the test is the run, as the Treasurer<br />
gave it, over the five-year period, which<br />
showed that Australia had enjoyed a remarkable<br />
period of stability, equalled by very<br />
few countries in any other part of the world.<br />
One could go through every aspect of this<br />
Budget and find answers which would completely<br />
demolish the arguments which the<br />
honorable gentleman has brought to it.<br />
Coming to social welfare, no section of<br />
the Parliament has a monopoly of consideration<br />
or concern for the aged or for<br />
those who are invalided, and the present<br />
Government has a record in that regard<br />
unmatched in the history of this Parliament.<br />
When I say " the present Government" I<br />
refer, of course, to the Government of my<br />
distinguished predecessor over the period of<br />
the last 16 years. I have the figures for<br />
social welfare contained in the Budget for<br />
1948-49, the last full year of a Labour<br />
Government. I know that the honorable<br />
gentleman opposite finds this highly unpalatable,<br />
because he wants to posture before<br />
the pensioners of this country as one of<br />
a party which has the sole concern for<br />
their wellbeing. But just as the trade<br />
unionists vote for us in their hundreds of<br />
thousands because they know where their<br />
welfare lies, so the pensioners, who know<br />
that it is out of a healthy expanding<br />
economy that more provision can be made<br />
for. them, give us their support election after<br />
election. And well they might, because<br />
compared with-<br />
Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER.-Order! I<br />
would be reluctant to name any honorable<br />
member during the Prime Minister's speech<br />
but if the honorable member for Oxley<br />
constantly interjects I will have to take<br />
action against him.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-The relative<br />
figures are $ 160 million of expenditure in<br />
1948-49 and $ 1,028 million of expenditure<br />
in the Budget just introduced by my<br />
colleague. All the juggling with movements<br />
in the Consumer Price Index or the value<br />
of money will not gainsay the fact that<br />
there has been a very remarkable increase<br />
in social welfare provisions by Governments </p>
<p>on this side of the House. There have been<br />
new benefits, new provisions, increased payments.<br />
None of us, of course, regards what<br />
has been done as the complete answer, any<br />
more than we regard the enormous increases<br />
we have made in provisions for<br />
education as a complete answer. The<br />
Treasurer and the Government, with whom<br />
the Treasurer in Cabinet discusses, of<br />
course, these problems in all their detail,<br />
have had to tailor the requirements of<br />
the nation to fit our revenue resources. It<br />
would have required an increase of 10 per<br />
cent, in personal income tax and 10 per<br />
cent. in company tax to bridge the gap of<br />
the deficit which the Treasurer has budgeted<br />
for on this occasion. When one measures<br />
this against the string of proposals that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition has undertaken to<br />
put into effect, one gets some idea of the<br />
sort of task that confronts him.<br />
I want to devote the concluding minutes<br />
of my speech, as the Leader of the Opposition<br />
did with his speech, to the situation<br />
in South Vietnam. I stated the ob ' jectives<br />
of this Government in South Vietnam in<br />
the House on 31st March. They are,' of<br />
course, to assist the Government of the<br />
Republic of Vietnam, at its request and in<br />
the light of our own assessment of the<br />
nature of the conflict there, to resist the<br />
armed aggression of Communist North<br />
Vietnam waged through the Communist<br />
aggression of the Vietcong, the so-called<br />
National Liberation Front, and by North<br />
Vietnam's own regular armed forces. This<br />
agg-ression, we know, is aimed at taking<br />
over the South by a combination of force,<br />
terror and subversion.<br />
Our second objective is to free the 15<br />
million people of South Vietnam from the<br />
threat of oppression and terror which<br />
would be their lot under the domination<br />
of the Communists of the north, and to<br />
help establish conditions under which they<br />
would be able to choose and develop, free<br />
from coercion of any kind, the forms of<br />
government and of society that they themselves<br />
want. Our thi-rd objective is to<br />
demonstrate that we in Australia honour<br />
our treaty commitments to our friends and<br />
our allies, that we stand by our alliances.<br />
By denying victory to Hanoi and Peking in<br />
South Vietnam we believe the spread of Communism in South East Asia can be<br />
checked. There will be encouragement, we<br />
believe, to those moderate elements that<br />
we are already supporting through the<br />
Colombo Plan and in other ways in the<br />
work of modernisation and of economic<br />
and social progress. We seek a peaceful<br />
settlement of the conflict through negotiation.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition wants the<br />
withdrawal of Australian forces. Does he<br />
want the withdrawal of United States<br />
forces also?<br />
Mr. Calwell.-That is their business.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-" That is their<br />
business he says. It is no business of<br />
ours, apparently, in the opinion of ! honorable<br />
gentlemen opposite, whether United<br />
States forces remain in South Vietnam or<br />
not. Does the Leader of the Opposition<br />
expect our A. N. Z. U. S. and S. E. A. T. O. ally<br />
to carry the burden of security in South<br />
East Asia virtually unaided by us-or, for<br />
that matter, by anyone else other than the<br />
hotly -pressed South Vietnamese? Australia<br />
-and -most Australians share this viewhas<br />
a vital interest in the presence and<br />
active participation of this great power in<br />
the area of Asia and the Pacific. We have<br />
an obligation to support the United States<br />
in this role, an obligation arising from our<br />
treaty relationships. We have a role as an<br />
ally having the Game belief in liberty and<br />
freedom, with a similar devotion to democratic<br />
process and with international<br />
interests directly involved in preserving<br />
South East Asia'fromn Communist domination.<br />
We hope for an expanding future<br />
with the countries of Asia and of South<br />
East Asia in particular. These hopes would<br />
vanish with Communist domination of an<br />
area so important to our wellbeing and our<br />
security. I want to refer honorable gentlemen opposite<br />
to a most important and significant<br />
speech by the President of the United<br />
States, delivered on 12th July 1966. 1 want<br />
to know whether honorable members on the<br />
other side of the House share -the views<br />
expressed by President Johnson. They have<br />
thrown jeers and gibes -at me over my support<br />
of American policy; I want to know </p>
<p>where they stand on American policy. Do<br />
they disagree with these statements of<br />
President Johnson-<br />
Asia is now the crucial arena of man's striving<br />
for independence and order-and for life itself.<br />
This is true because three out of every five people<br />
in all this world live in Asia tonight. This is<br />
true because hundreds of millions of them exist on<br />
less than 25 cents a day. And this is true because<br />
Communists in Asia tonight still believe in force<br />
in order to achieve their Communist goals. So if<br />
enduring peace can ever come to Asia all mankind<br />
will benefit. But if peace fails there, nowhere else<br />
will our achievements really be secure.<br />
By peace in Asia I do not mean simply the<br />
absence of armed hostilities, for wherever men<br />
hunger and hate there can really be no peace. I<br />
do not mean the peace of conquest, for humniliation<br />
can be the seedbed of war. I do not mean<br />
simply the peace of the conference table, for<br />
peace is not really written merely in the words of<br />
treaties, but peace is the day-by-day work of<br />
builders. So the peace that we seek in Asia is a peace of<br />
conciliation between Communist States and their<br />
non-Communist neighbours; between rich nations<br />
and poor; between small nations and large;<br />
between men whose skins are brown and black<br />
and yellow and white; between Hindus and Moslems<br />
and Buddhists and Christians. It is a peace<br />
that can only be sustained through the durable<br />
bonds of peace; and through international trade<br />
and through the free flow of peoples and ideas;<br />
and through full participation by all nations in an<br />
international community under law, and through<br />
a common dedication to the great task of human<br />
progress and economic development.<br />
Is. such a peace possible? With all my heart I<br />
believe that it is.<br />
I1 support President Johnson because what<br />
he said there he has stated precisely in the<br />
terms of goals which Australia can also<br />
accept in this area of the world. The Leader of the Opposition closed -his<br />
speech by offering the nation a choice. He<br />
said-Our policy on all matters will be decided by the<br />
Federal Parliamentary Labour Party in due course.<br />
There has been no change in the constitutional<br />
arrangements of the Labour Party.<br />
The honorable gentleman is still subject<br />
to the faceless 36, as we saw the other<br />
day in connection with the State aid issue.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition makes the<br />
claim that his Party will face the electorate<br />
on 26th November united, determined and<br />
confident. This claim of unity and confidence<br />
is, on the face of it, ludicrous. For<br />
most of the life of this Parliament the<br />
Australian Labour Party has presented<br />
the spectacle of a rabble. The people have<br />
the choice, Mr. Deputy Speaker, between<br />
this Government, united on this great<br />
issue, and the Labour Party, confused and<br />
divided; a common defence of freedom or<br />
a walk-out on our friends and allies; the<br />
understanding of the Communist drive for<br />
world power or Labour's refusal to see<br />
what is happening in our part of the world;<br />
policies that look to an expanding future<br />
or policies bogged down in the past; rule<br />
by those chosen by the people or rule by<br />
36 faceless men; a Government with<br />
leadership or a Labour Party run by<br />
factions; the strength, unity and purpose<br />
of this Government's policies or the disunity<br />
and confusion of the Australian Labour<br />
Party. We know the choice that the people<br />
will make.<br />
