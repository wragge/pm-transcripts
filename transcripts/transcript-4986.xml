FOR PRESS 11 MARCH 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
One of the most exciting industrial projects of the present<br />
time is the development of the world car. The world<br />
automotive industry is going through a period of dramatic<br />
change which will intensify throughout the 1980' s.<br />
Increasing costs, together with demand for more fuel<br />
efficient vehicles, are encouraging integration of operations<br />
and the use of common vehicle components on a world basis.<br />
The world car concept involves production by related companies<br />
in different countries of cars with common design factors.<br />
Over the next decade, the industry will be putting a huge<br />
effort into the design and production of smaller, lighter<br />
and more fuel efficient cars.<br />
Front wheel drive, transverse engines, together with electronic<br />
parts will become common. Production of component modules<br />
such as trans-axles, engines and ignition equipment will<br />
take place in specialised facilities. They will be produced<br />
on a scale designed to minimise costs. These facilities will<br />
be located throughout the world, where the best comparative<br />
advantages can be obtained.<br />
With five manufacturers operating in a small market the<br />
Australian industry has lacked access to scale economies<br />
and opportunities for specialisation. This has inhibited<br />
productivity and quality improvements and has limited the<br />
ability of Australian manufacturers to compete in both domestic<br />
and export markets.<br />
The Australian vehicle industry needs to respond to the new<br />
chal;-lenge. Their product must be attractive to the Australian<br />
market compared with imports, less costly to produce in<br />
Australia, and have greater export potential.<br />
The best way the industry can ensure its future prosperity<br />
is -o reduce costs and increase competitiveness through large<br />
scs Ie export activities. Australia is responding to these<br />
challenges with its entry into the world car scheme. General<br />
Motors-Holden, for example, is planning a $ 210 million fourcylinrder<br />
engine complex in Victoria. This new plant will be<br />
one of four such plants throughout the world producing engines<br />
for a world car. / 2 </p>

It is great news for Australia that two-thirds of the output<br />
of the Australian plant will be exported to Europe. I am<br />
confident that this is only the first stage and that other<br />
sec-tors of the Australian -motor vehicle industry will follow<br />
in this export drive.<br />
Today, there is a high standard of design and craftsmanship<br />
in our motor vehicle industry. We are building world-class<br />
qrcucts and for that Australian workmen and Australian<br />
enQa-. e: ers can -talke a good deal of pride.<br />
Some changes have been made to the Government's motor vehicle<br />
plail zo encourage these new developments. The Government<br />
has approved these changes because it believes the longer-term<br />
viah41ity and competitiveness of the local industry will be<br />
enh-anced and cheaper cars offered to consumers. On top of<br />
tha. t it will result in greater work security for more employees<br />
than would otherwise be the case.<br />
The Government has made many other moves in the past few years<br />
to assist Australian firms to get into export. We have<br />
introduced a new Export Expansion Grant Scheme, improved<br />
the Export Market Development Grant Scheme, extended the<br />
service offered by the Export Finance Insurance Corporation,<br />
established an Overseas Projects Corporation, and up-graded<br />
the general services provided by the Department of Trade<br />
and Resources to individual exporters. But the greatest<br />
incentive the Government has given exporters has been to<br />
reduce inflation.<br />
Australian firms are now competing successfully in some of<br />
t~ he world's -toughest markets. They are exporting to markets<br />
that would have been nothing more -than a dot on the map<br />
a few years ago. We are now more competitive than at any<br />
time~ during the last seven years. This export activity<br />
will benefit every Australian. It builds on confidence,<br />
assists general economic recovery and provides a basis for<br />
creation of new Job opportunities. Our involvement in<br />
the' world car scheme deserves the strongest community support.<br />
