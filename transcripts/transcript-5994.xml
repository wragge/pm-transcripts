PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 21 JANUARY 1983<br />
DEATH OF LADY CASEY<br />
I was very sad to learn of the death of Lady Casey.<br />
, Maie Casey was an extraordinarily versatile and talented<br />
woman. As the wife of Lord Casey, whom she married in 1926,<br />
she was of tremendous assistance during his distinguished<br />
career. But in her own right she was a woman of great achievement.<br />
She was an accomplished writer, an artist of note, a pilot<br />
and patron of the Australian Women Pilots Association, and a<br />
distinguished member of the Australian community. Her death,<br />
I know, will be a cause of great sorrow to a large number<br />
of Australians.<br />
I offer my sympathy to Lady Casey's son, Mr Donn Casey,<br />
and to her daughter, Mrs Jane Macgowan.<br />
