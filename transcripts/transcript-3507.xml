QUEE: NSLANDERS AN'D THEIR FAMILIES OF: $ v5U MILLION IN FUNDS FOR<br />
ESSE7NTIAL PROJECTS. II </p>
<p>-2-<br />
FOR REASONS OF SHEER DOGMA AND IDEOLOGY, IT HAS REJECTED<br />
OUR OFFER TO MAKE TOWNSVILLEI A BIGGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS<br />
C I'Y. IT HAS RE JFCIED OUR OFFORF F FEDERAL FUNDS TO<br />
STABILISE LAND PRICES FOR THE HOME BUYER WE HAVE BEEN<br />
ABLE TO CO-OPERATE WITH EVERY LIBERAL PREMIER IN SIMILAR<br />
PL\ NS IN OTIHER STATES, ONLY MR, BJELKE--PETERSENI, BLINDED<br />
BY HIS OBSESSIONS, BL. INKER ED BY HIS PATHOLOGICAL HATRED OF<br />
AN ELECTED LABOR GOVERNMENT, REFUSES TO PLAY BALL.<br />
SECONDLY, THE QUEENSLAND STATE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
REFUSED TO MAKE PROPER USE OF THE FUNDS WE HAVE MADE<br />
AVAILABLE FOR EDUCATION, HOUSING AND OTHER PRUPOSES.<br />
QUEENSLAND HAS BEEN DRAGGING THE CHAIN WHILE EVERY OTHER<br />
STATE HAS MOVED AHEAD. IN OUR LAST BUDGET WE GAVE THE<br />
STATES A VIRTUAL BLANK CHEQUE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF<br />
WELFARE HOUSING. YET QUEENSLAND IS BUILDING FEWER HOUSING<br />
COMMISSION HOMES THAN ANY OIHER STATE. THEY ARE BUILDING<br />
FEWER THAN THE LAST QUEENSLAND LABOR GOVERNMENT IN ITS LAST<br />
YEAR OF OFFICE IN 1956-57. ' WE HAVE GIVEN RECORD AMOUNTS<br />
FOR EDUCATION. YET QUEENSLAND HAS SPENT ONLY 18% OF THE<br />
CAPITAL FUNDS WE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE FOR EDUCATION IN<br />
1973 AND .197-1.<br />
THI-RDLY, THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT HAS WANTONLY<br />
OBSTRUCTED OUR EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH TIE GREAT ECONOMIC<br />
PROBLEMS FACING AUSTRALIA AND ALL OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.<br />
PRICES IN QUEENSLAND HAVE RISEN FASTER IN THE LAST TWELVE<br />
MONTHS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN AUSTRALIA. ,/ 3 </p>

JUSTICE AN4D TIl-lE VIOLENCE-IT D. OES TO OUR COUNTRY'IS REPUTATION,<br />
QUEENSLANDERS MUST ASK THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY CAN ALLOW SUCH<br />
A SYSTEM TO0 DEPRIVE THEM OF REAL MATER IAL GAINS AND SET BACK THE<br />
PROGRESSAND DEVELOPMEN'T OF THEIR STATE$ </p>
<p>V<br />
I DO NOT CLAIM THAT WE HAVE TlHE ANSWERS TO EVERY<br />
PROBLEM. I DO CLAIM THAT WE HAVE MORE CHANCE OF SOLVING<br />
PROBLEMS IF WE WORK TOGETHER, IF WE PREFER CO-OPERATION TO<br />
CONFLICT. QUEENSLAND CANNOT LIVE IN ISOLATION, SIHE CANNOT<br />
PROSPER IF SHE REtMAINS AT ODDS WITH THE REST OF A USRALIA.<br />
SHE CANNOT FULFIL HER UNDOLUBTFD DESTINY HER LIMITLESS<br />
PROMISE. iF SHE REMAINS THE ODD STATE OUT<br />
