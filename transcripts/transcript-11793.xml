<p>Thank you very much Indira, to Tony Staley, Dawn Casey, the Chief Minister Gary Humphries, Peter McGauran, my other Ministerial Colleagues, the Leader of the Opposition, members of the Council of the National Museum, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>When in 1997, the Federal Government decided to commit $1 billion to a Federation Fund, we decided that the flagship project ought to be financial support for the construction of the National Museum of Australia. It's already been remarked that as long ago as pre-Federation days, Sir Henry Parkes had the idea of a National Museum. And it therefore seemed appropriate that the flagship project ought to be this museum. And it is appropriate that it's being officially opened on the 88th anniversary of the establishment of Canberra as a great sight ultimately for a great National Capital. Whatever may be said and whatever has already been said about the Museum it can certainly be said that the opening of this building and it's viewing by the Australian public will change in a very profound way the enjoyment of life for people who live in the national capital and also the enjoyment of visiting our national capital. This is a unique museum, I remarked last night that in some respects it is very un-museum like. And that represents its challenge to the Australian people, and represents its special character. It has within its structures a recognition of the influence of Walter Burley Griffin on the establishment of Canberra. It also recognises that latterly acquired great Australian icon, Arthur Stace, the eternity theme is a very important part of the museum. What it does unusually, and I think very attractively is seek to interpret the history of our nation. Not only in terms of events and objects but also in terms of the life experience of people from different backgrounds, Indigenous people, people who came to this country having been born elsewhere, and people who have been born in this nation.</p>
<p>It's not possible on an occasion like this of course to remark the occasion without thanking all of those who have done so much. I want to acknowledge the contribution of two successive Chief Ministers of the ACT. Kate Carnell played a very enthusiastic role during her time as Chief Minister in promoting the Museum, and I also want to thank Garry Humphries for his enthusiastic advocacy as indeed do I thank Margaret Reid and other parliamentary representatives from the ACT. But to you Tony and Dawn and to the architects and the men and women who've worked on the site to bring it to fruition, to you is owed the greatest measure of thanks. It will change the way people see Canberra. It will I think over time change the way in which people view museums, because what this museum and what its concept seeks to do, is to interpret and relate history and the experience of our country in a somewhat different way. Quite properly and inevitably there will be debate in the future about that way of interpreting our history and that way of relating those events. But importantly, it represents a quite different way of presenting the history and culture of a nation. It represents an attempt to put forward a museum which tells a story of a country in a way that is peculiar to our own nation and our own nation's experience.</p>
<p>This national capital of ours, houses many great buildings and many great reminders of the great diversity and richness of Australian life, and I think of all of those buildings, none I believe in time will have as great an impact as this National Museum.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that part of this opening is the Golden Civilisation Exhibition. I declare that open as well as in a few moments declaring open the museum. And that exhibition will remind all of us of the enormous impact of the discovery of gold and all that attended that on the history and the experience of the Australian people. As students of the Federation story will know it was the votes of the gold miners of Kalgoorlie that finally determined that the people of Western Australia should enter the Australian Federation. And in so many different ways the exhibitions tell the stories of the Australian people, often in a poignant fashion. But I hope, to those who visit the exhibitions in a very meaningful and effective way. This is a year for all Australians to feel a very deep sense of pride and appreciation about what we have achieved over the last one hundred years. It's also an occasion to honour in different ways on different occasions the contributions that so many have made. I understand that within this museum is the first ever full exhibition of the life and experience of the Torres Strait Islander people. It is but one example of the additions that this museum will make to the understanding of our history, and the lives of Australians by those who visit it.</p>
<p>Janette and I are delighted to be here on this very beautiful Canberra morning. We believe that the support that the Government has given to this great flagship project is support that is very much committed to a deeper and better understanding of the nature and history of the Australian story and the experience of the Australian people in that story. Thank you.</p>
