FOR PRESS 3 FEBRUARY 1981<br />
BUSHFIRE AT ZEEHAN<br />
I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to the people<br />
of Zeehan over the loss of their homes and property and<br />
disruption to their lives in today's bushfire.<br />
The Commonwealth stands ready to provide funds to Tasmania<br />
on a dollar for dollar basis with the Tasmanian Government<br />
for the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress<br />
in accordance with Natural Disaster Assistance arrangements.<br />
This assistance will go towards the provision of food,<br />
clothing and accommodation.<br />
I have spoken to the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Lowe, this<br />
evening, and have assured him that the Commonwealth will<br />
respond quickly and sympathetically. o0o---</p>
