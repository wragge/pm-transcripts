-i) AUST A JLh<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 July 1983<br />
The Primc Minister, Mr. Hawke, confirmed today that the<br />
Federal Government would be terminating financial assistance<br />
to Tasmania for construction of the Crotty Road.<br />
The Crotty Road, which leads off the Lyell Highway east of<br />
Gormanston, had been intended as the principal access to the<br />
Gordon-below-Franklin dam, and a significant part of the<br />
workforce engaged on the dam project had been working on the<br />
road at the time of the High Court's decision of July 1.<br />
Mr. Hawke said: " In the letter I wrote to the Tasmanian<br />
Premier, Mr. Gray, on the day the High Court's decision was<br />
announced, I suggested that our two Governments allow work on<br />
the Crotty Road to continue for the very immediate future, in<br />
order to maintain the workforce and to keep options open for<br />
further development if that were subsequently agreed.<br />
" Since that time, Mr. Gray has informed me that his Government<br />
would be opposed to the road being extended to Kelly Basin, on<br />
Macquarie Harbour.<br />
" Mr. Gray has also informed me that, consequent on the<br />
Tasmanian Government's recently announced intention to proceed<br />
with the King River hydro scheme, the road would in time be<br />
partially flooded.<br />
" In the light of that advice, the Commonwealth has had little<br />
option but to end its assistance to the State for construction<br />
of the road.<br />
Mr. Hawke said the Government realised the decision would<br />
cause some disruption and uncertainty for those who had been<br />
working on the Crotty Road.<br />
" I regret that very much, but the circumstances have made it<br />
unavoidable. " I assure them Chat the Commonwealth is pressing ahead with<br />
the preparation of co-operative arrangements with Tasmania<br />
for alternative work opportunities for those formerly employed<br />
on the Gordon-below-Franklin project, and I am sure that, with<br />
goodwill on all sides, present problems will soon be overcome." / 2 </p>

Mr. Hawke said in the meantime, the Federal Government had<br />
agreed to extend for anQther month the arrangements for income<br />
maintenance for HEC employees and for financial assistance for<br />
contractors, including assistance for co1htractors' employees.<br />
" There is therefore no need for concern on that account."<br />
Mr. Hawke said that there would be need for appropriate<br />
clearing-up activities on the Crotty Road project, and<br />
officials of the two Governments would be conferring urgently<br />
to determine what was to be done.<br />
officials would also be examining, on a case-by-case basis, I<br />
the situation of contractors affected by the termination of<br />
work on the Gordon-below-Franklin project, including the<br />
phasing out of work on the Crotty Road. fil<br />
