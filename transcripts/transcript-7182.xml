FOR MEDIA12 JUNE 1987<br />
I have sent the following message to Prime Minister Thatcher:<br />
" Your electoral victory today is indeed historic. May I<br />
congratulate you on behalf of the Australian Government and<br />
people, and offer every good wish for your next term. I look<br />
forward to working with you again on issues of concern to<br />
both our countries, linked as we are by the two centuries of<br />
our history you are joining us in celebrating in 1988."<br />
