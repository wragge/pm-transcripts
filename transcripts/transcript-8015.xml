TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, RAAF BASE FAIRBAIRN, 27<br />
APRIL 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to inspect the flood damage?<br />
PM: Well I don't know about that but I'll certainly be<br />
talking as soon as I can to Mr Keating who has been up<br />
there. JOURNALIST: Are you concerned though? Have you been<br />
receiving briefings on the trip?<br />
PM: Yes I have been receiving constant briefings, that's<br />
right, yes. As I said before, I express my deepest<br />
sympathy to all those who have been adversely affected by<br />
them and I've been kept constantly briefed and now that<br />
I'm back I'll continue to be informed and will make the<br />
appropriate decisions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you worried that a lot of people aren't<br />
covered by insurance policies?<br />
PM: Well I want to get fully briefed on just what<br />
exactly the position is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on Gallipoli Mr Hawke, were you<br />
surprised by the number of young people that made the<br />
effort to go to the celebrations?<br />
PM: I don't know if surprised is the right word because<br />
we'd had indications there would be a lot there but it<br />
was indeed very gratifying to see so many young people<br />
there and the link between the generations was<br />
magnificent. The old veterans, an average age I suppose<br />
of about 95, and the rapport between them and the young<br />
6eople was magnificent.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the highlight of the trip?<br />
PM: The Dawn Service and the service at Lone Pine and<br />
then there was a very touching moment of course at the<br />
luncheon when the two old veterans, 102 year old Turkish<br />
veteran and old Jack, one of our characters, swapped<br />
uniforms and boots and shook hands and then kissed one<br />
another on the cheeks that was very moving. </p>

JOURNALIST: How are the veterans standing up to the<br />
trip? PM: Remarkably well. We had a lot to do with them on<br />
the day and we were watching them closely right through<br />
from the service and breakfast and lunch. One just<br />
wonders how they'll be coming back, whether it will be<br />
some sort of let down. But they are truly remarkable men<br />
and may I also pay an unqualified tribute to the minders<br />
who were just superb in the way they looked after them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you heard much about the<br />
large turnouts on ANZAC Day in Australia<br />
PM: I read the reports, yes, and said they were very,<br />
very large turnouts and I was very pleased to see this<br />
and if in any small way the visit of the veterans that we<br />
facilitated and this whole pilgrimage, if that's helped<br />
in any way to rekindle an understanding of Gallipoli in<br />
1915 and what it meant for Australia then we'll all be<br />
very pleased to have been associated with that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think some of the ANZAC<br />
spirit has been shown up though, there are a number of<br />
appeals going for flood victims, there are sporting club<br />
launching appeals. Do you think that shows some of the<br />
ANZAC spirit?<br />
PM: Well I hope so because if there was one message that<br />
came out of Gallipoli in 1915 and the spirit of ANZAC was<br />
as I said at Lone Pine, it was the understanding and the<br />
dependence of one another, the men there knew that they<br />
depended on each other for their very survival and I hope<br />
that in Australia today we have some of that sort of<br />
understanding. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your response to India's<br />
anger over the Mirage sale?<br />
PM: I'm not surprised that there is some feeling. But<br />
of course the facts are that the availability of the<br />
Mirages was known to everyone. India themselves could've<br />
bid for them if they were interested. They won't be<br />
available to Pakistan until towards the end of the year<br />
and if, and heaven forbid that that were the case, that<br />
there were to be conflict in the near future the<br />
a7ircraft, the availability of the aircraft, would be<br />
reviewed. ends<br />
