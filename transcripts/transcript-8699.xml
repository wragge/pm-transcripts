TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA<br />
OCTOBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well I thought I would give you some comments about the Liberals<br />
industrial relations policy. Well this policy completes thc Liberal double.<br />
Firstly, they want to tax everything you consume with a 15 per ccnt goods<br />
and serviccs tax and now they want to cut your pay. So, it is prices up and<br />
-wages down, as though alrcady wages in Australia are too high when our<br />
labour costs are 10 per cent what they were a dccade ago. It is essentially a<br />
return to the dark ages of the common law of master and servant, the<br />
Liberals have now rctreated to the past to dig up the common law of master<br />
and servant last used in thc 19th century to apply to Australians. They are<br />
going to force nearly 8 million people, 8 million working Australians on to<br />
individual contracts which each person has to sign with their employer,<br />
where they have no bargaining rights, and in many cases no bargaining<br />
power, and no protection against dismissal. The policy reduces minimum<br />
standards, it freezes pay and conditions by abolishing awards, but even<br />
when the award is abolished it doesn't prevent an employer from sackins<br />
someone on a supposedly frozen award. It basically has an over-riding aim<br />
and that is basically about cancelling federal and State awards and<br />
replacing them with individual contracts, enforceable only at the common<br />
law.<br />
ZTO'ON 91: ST Z610OZ .131 </p>
<p>It is the most crude industrial policy ever proposed by a major Australian<br />
political party. It is not about flexibility, because everything we need now<br />
in flexibility is available nder enterprise agreements. It is not about<br />
productivity, productivity in this workforce of ours increased by a huge 2.6<br />
per cent in the year to June, and we see evidence of even stronger rises<br />
coming through with all the innovative industrial agreements, enterprise<br />
agreements being signed. It is not about wages verses competitiveness,<br />
because Australia is more then 10 per cent more competitive then when<br />
Labor came to office nearly a decade ago and we have one of the lowest<br />
inflation rates in the world. This is all about forcing Australian employees<br />
off awards and rcgistered agreements, cancelling their existing entitlements<br />
and telling them they can either take the bosses contract or take the sack.<br />
And for every infringement of the contract each employee will be fined up<br />
to $ 5000. This is an unbelievable document and it could only be produced<br />
by a party which under Dr Hewson's leadership has become an extremist<br />
organisation. So, first it was the Reserve Bank and the Treasury that<br />
annoyed the Opposition, then it was the car companies, then it was the<br />
churches, then the tourist industry, the construction industry, people who<br />
rent, and now it is the 7.6 million Australian employees they want to put the<br />
boot in to. I mean, you really wonder where it will end, where this craven<br />
push from the right will ever end. I think it is about the worst policy I have<br />
seen in my public life. Questions if you have them.<br />
J: Well the policy, Prime Minister, does have safe guards for workers doesn't<br />
that make it a little hardcr to attack?<br />
PM: What safe guards? It has minimum rates, it doesn't have safe guards at all, it<br />
has minimum rates, some would lose their current pay rate. If you take, for<br />
instance let me give you an example of a nurse, nearly half of his or her pay<br />
is in shift and penalty rates and that all goes to the minimum rate in the<br />
award, and if they don't take it they can take the sack.<br />
J: What advice have you receivcd, Prime Minister, about the legality of the<br />
proposal to close down State awards, for instance, and push them into<br />
federal awards?<br />
PM: The document is only an hour or two old so I haven't taken any advice, but<br />
the Liberals are saying they will use the full constitutional power of the<br />
Commonwealth, I assume the power, the corporations power, in the first<br />
instance, and other powers to cancel, so that the legislation is valid, to<br />
cancel awards and certified agreements. </p>
<p>J: workers and employers can't agree on whether to work in or outside the<br />
system, the existing award conditions will remain, that makes no one<br />
worse off.<br />
PM: Yes, but for how long? What is an award worth after three years? I mean<br />
once you disturb it it is not an award, you understand, what remains is not<br />
an award, they made that very clear, they've made that quite clear, what<br />
remains is the rate of pay'and the conditions, but no award status, and you<br />
can be sacked while you are in that position. Do you understand? Let me<br />
find the reference, I mean, this is really crude stuff. It says: " Although the<br />
award pay and conditions, page 13, will continue that relationship between<br />
the employer and cmployee will not be legally governed by an award".<br />
" Will not be legally governed by an award". Therefore any future variation<br />
of that relationship will need to be negotiated between the employer and the<br />
employee.<br />
1: How much impact will it havc on ALP party funds, PM, with the obvious attempts<br />
to shut off unions?<br />
PM: I should say substantial because every employee in this country; only a third of<br />
employees are covered by unions, the rest are not. But they'll all he forced to sign<br />
up to common law contracts and will drag out the master and servant law from the<br />
19th century. MiTha6irCi ewson's new Australia.<br />
J: The United Statcs have survived quite well without an award sector Mr Keating<br />
a bit of an hyperbole there, this cleaning up structure that is 19th century.<br />
PM: Do you think so Tonm ( Burton)? You are such a radical you are, I know and T<br />
realise that, I know you are a social scientist and the rest. The fact of the matter is<br />
that in this country we now have all the flexibility in the world under enterprise<br />
agreements, all the flexibility in the world; flexibility as to hours, as to penalty<br />
rates, as to the nature of working weeks, flexibility in relation to women and their<br />
requirements, The only flexibility there isn't available now is flexibility down,<br />
which is what the Liberal Party wants. So those righits which are protected now<br />
under the basis of a certified agreement which becomes an award give people a<br />
guarantee that they won't be pushed on the minimum rates and lose rates of pay<br />
and conditions that they formcrly had. What is the problem? Is Australian pay too<br />
high? Is the wage share in GDP too high? Does anyone argue that? We've got a<br />
wage share in GDP at 1960s levels.<br />
J: Do you think this debate is about minimum award rates?<br />
PM: This is about taking away the bargaining power of Australians in their work<br />
relationship with their emiployee. So an individual pcrson signs up with say BHP,<br />
or an individual person signs up with ICI or Coles or whoever it might be or a<br />
OT/ M'd ZTO'ON 9T: ST Z610O 13 </p>
<p>smaller business or a smaller individual employer. Thiere is no group basis<br />
bemause they make clear that unions will not be able to sign, they make that<br />
abundantly clear.<br />
J1: You've already said that only 1/ 3 of Australians are now covered by unions. Two<br />
thirds of Australians arc coping quite well without union backing.<br />
PM: It Is not the union backing, it is the process within which the whole industrial<br />
framcwork, rates of pay and conditions, and conditions of work have been set.<br />
Most Australians have enjoyed the benefits of a hundred years of industrial<br />
negotiation, industrial and wage practice, whether they belong to a union or not.<br />
They make it clear here<br />
' Workplace agreements ( pg 10) can be concluded only between indivdual<br />
employers and one, some or all of their employees, unions or employer<br />
organisations or any other agent of the signatories cannot be parties to a<br />
workplace agreement<br />
So this can only be signed by the individual. You've got the negotiating power of<br />
one person against the company, this will all happen to you, you'll have to sign<br />
under them, under the Liberals an individual contract with News Limited or John<br />
Fairfax.<br />
J: Everyone has got an individual employment contract, except the union negotiates<br />
on your behalf.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
J: That won't change, the union will still he there to negotiate.<br />
PM: Journalists are not quite in the same position as the rest of the work force because<br />
of the fact you can demand executive salaries and be treated accordingly in your<br />
negotiation.<br />
J On the subject of flexibility, surely the Gazal case has just showed there's not that<br />
much flexibility when it comes down to it and if Gazal closes down and those<br />
people don't have jobs what's the satisfaction of having flexibility to them?<br />
PM: I don't know the details of the case, I don't know the issues involved in the case,<br />
but there are apparently a lot of issues involved there about what is owcd to<br />
employees, about where the assets of the companies are.<br />
3: Arc you saying that the existing system has basically reached maximum flexibility<br />
apart from downward flexibility?<br />
JIt7d TO* ON 9T: ST Z64100O 31 </p>
<p>Pm: rm saying we've moved off a craft structure which the liberals never had the wit<br />
to change. Where we had a craft basis, so if you're a metal worker and a rate was<br />
struck with you, that rate went right across the whole of Australian industry for<br />
anyone dealing with mctals. We've moved off the craft structure to a much more<br />
enterprise and industry structure, and within those structures we're now getting all<br />
the flexibility on a company or enterprise basis, and nobody is objecting to that,<br />
they are all supporting that. But there are protections in there and if those<br />
protections go, your only recourse is at the common law.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: It's got unlimited flexibility, it's really up to the imagination of the managers and<br />
employees.<br />
J: The Structure doesn't need to change any more to encourage or promote forward<br />
flexibility?<br />
PM: The proliferation of these agreements and more productivity based arrangements<br />
to the workplace are going to be important for the whole economy because that is<br />
the way of getting productivity you're not going to get it out of central bench<br />
decisions. But having in the 1980s got aggregate wage flexibility, that is getting<br />
the profit share up and the wage share down as we did, now to get within sector<br />
flexibility and intra-sector flexibility is now happening right across the country. I<br />
published in thc House the other day one hundred agreements, the nature of those<br />
agreements, and this has all been done with total harmony.<br />
J: Prime Minister, if everything is fine and we have all the flexibility we need<br />
then why are there a million people out of work and why are we going into<br />
the red at the rate of a billion dollars a month on the current account?.<br />
PM: Because ' d emand ' is down and because our economy has not been able to<br />
produce enough goods and services. The answer to the first question is<br />
because demand is down, and two, because the economy has not been able<br />
to produce enough goods and services. It's not because the rates of pay are<br />
too high.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have got 11 per cent unemployment under your industrial<br />
relations policy, don't you think voters are going to find a change and this<br />
change palatable?<br />
PM: There's also 7.6 million people employed under our industrial relations<br />
policy, with 6 million in 1982. In New Zealand there arc fewer people<br />
employed today than therc was in 1982. In Australia there arc 26 per cent<br />
more people employed than in 1982. So wagcs are not the problem. The </p>
<p>wage share in the economy I produced a US Labour and Commerce<br />
Department survey last week where Australia is way down the bottom in<br />
terms of wage levels amongst OECD countries. I mean, what do they want<br />
to do, these people push us into coolie rates? Is that what you're<br />
advocating?<br />
1: But in the US, Mr Keating, there's about 12 per cent more jobs than there<br />
are in Australia with the sort of IR system the Opposition is talking about.<br />
PM: Where do you<br />
J: They have participation rates in the order of 72 per cent, the US.<br />
PM: They have much lower participation rates than Australia, much lower.<br />
J: According to research by Professor Gregory they haveRarticipation rates of<br />
more than 7 per cent.<br />
PM: They've got a participation rate, as I understand it, of about 55 and we've<br />
got, I think, 62. So if we had their participation rate, we'd have<br />
unemployment down to around 6 or 7 per cent. That's the US position.<br />
There's no way US participation is as high as this country.<br />
J: According to Professor Gregory's paper, which was published 2 months ago,<br />
they had rates of participation of something like 72 per cent and it would<br />
mean another million jobs in Australia under an IR policy like theirs,<br />
PM: Yes, but even if its true, so what? The thing is, it's not true. Anyone, I<br />
think, who has been through the US economy and particularly with the huge<br />
participation in this economy by women in the ' 80s, these very high<br />
participation rates Look at our participation rates, just look at us<br />
compared to what we were a decade ago. If we had the same participation<br />
rates today that John Howard had we'd have unemployment, I think, with a<br />
6 or ' 7 in front of It.<br />
J. But doesn't the US experience suggest that with a more flexible labour<br />
market you'd get more jobs?<br />
PM: I don't necessarily think that's right. If you're saying, is flexibility desirable,<br />
yes. But this is not about flexibility, all the flexibility in the world is there<br />
now, that's the point. All the flcxibility in the world is there now. This is<br />
about pushing people into weak bargaining positions, pushing nearly 8 </p>
<p>million Australians into a weak bargaining position so that they either get<br />
the sack or take the boss' contract, and if they want to argue about it they go<br />
and hire a barrister and go to the court, and take it a couple of years to have<br />
it heard.<br />
3: They have got the Office of Employees Advocate, though.<br />
PM: Oh yes, I know.<br />
J: Doesn't that give them an avenuie for some recourse?<br />
PM: That is a Liberal Government appointed trade union. A Liberal Government<br />
appointed trade union.<br />
J: So you don't think that it would be very effective for the employee?<br />
PM: Well hear what they had to say about it. This is thcm at their best. They<br />
said: " The Coalition will create the Office of the Employee Advocate. The<br />
Employee's Advocate will protect the rights of employees<br />
I thought that was a job unions did<br />
" who have legitimate grievances.<br />
Again I though it was thc things unions did. So are we going to have) are<br />
we, a Liberal Party appointed trade union? That is, our democracy has got<br />
to such a point that people will not be choosing to have themselves<br />
organisationally represented, their representation will be decided for them.<br />
The Liberal Party used to attack countrics which had those structures.<br />
3: The ACTU yesterday released some research which appeared to show that<br />
people werc largely in favour of thesc workplace agreements as long as they<br />
had a safety net, and that looks very much like what Mr Howard has put out<br />
today.<br />
PM: No, it's not like what Mr Howard put out today. It's not, it's not about<br />
existing rates of pay, it's about minimums. It's not the rate of pay you would<br />
actually receive. I'll give you the example of the nurse who works all sorts<br />
of rates, or the shop assistant who works all sorts of hours and gets a higher<br />
rate. So your rate of pay and the minimum are two different things. And </p>
<p>anyway, the minimum that obtains only obtains without the force of an<br />
award, which I've just read to you, and you can be sacked anyway.<br />
I. What about those workers who reach agreements that they are satisfied<br />
with?<br />
PM: You mean the current ones?<br />
1: Under this proposal.<br />
PM: Just say it again.<br />
J1: What about the workers who do reach agreements, enterprise agreements,<br />
that they are satisfied with, that they're quite happy with?<br />
PM: Well some people may be. But this is about each individual signing up, and<br />
you don't have to be a political scientist or an industrial scientist to know<br />
that the individual's negotiating power against a company of any size is<br />
greatly diminished from the position of group organisation. Is that a fact or<br />
not?<br />
J: Prime Minister, just on another matter, what did you say yesterday to Mr<br />
Mulholland on the issue of the Fairfax bureaux?<br />
PM: T'm not into boutique news.<br />
J. Is it accurate?<br />
PM: I know journos are very interested in yourselves, I know that. I said things<br />
supportive of all of you, I can assure you) but I don't want to go into thcm<br />
now.<br />
I; Prime Minister, the basis of the Opposition's document seems to be an end<br />
to what Mr Howard calls the ' outmoded notion of class envy and jealousy'.<br />
Would you agrce with that as a philosophical point?<br />
PM: No, this is about going back to the power that employers had in the last<br />
century against employees. This is about stripping Australians down of<br />
their rates of pay and their conditions. It's the Liberal Party doing what it<br />
has always wanted to do, but now having the gall to actually propose it<br />
baldly in a document. No other conservativc government has ever taken<br />
thcse sorts of policies on. </p>
<p>9<br />
J: Does it make it easier for you now in the run up to the next election to<br />
differcntiate the Labor Party from thc Liberals on the basis of this policy?<br />
PM: Their policy is a pretty novel policy to get elected on. They said, we'll lift<br />
the price of everything you buy with a 15 per cent tax on everything you<br />
spend, and we'll cut your pay. Now finding a distinction with that, I don't<br />
find difficult to do because I don't want to put a 15 per cent tax on<br />
everything, and will not put a 15 per cent tax on everything everyone buys,<br />
and I won't be around cutting people's pay.<br />
J: If this policy were to produce lower wages, do you think there would be any<br />
incecase in employment as a result?<br />
PM: I don't think wages are a problem and the cost of labour is a problem today.<br />
The problem is basically demand.<br />
J: If wages wcre to fall, do you think employment might increase as a result?<br />
PM: In the case of young people where they are talking about $ 3 $ 3.50 an<br />
hour, God help you, you couldn't get a baby sitter for $ 3 an hour. At $ 3.50<br />
an hour, is that going to expand the number of jobs? I don't think so.<br />
3: What about unskilled labour?<br />
PM; I think by and large the problem is not the price of labour, it is demand.<br />
What arc you going to do with the labour, how are you going to employ it?<br />
J: T7hat's a good question. What exactly are you going to do to get a million<br />
people back to work if none of these Opposition proposals are going to<br />
work?<br />
PM: Expand the economny, let it grow. We can let it grow, we don't need to keep<br />
it comatose as the Liberal Party would need to keep it to keep inflation<br />
down because they have no incomes policy. They have no agreement about<br />
national income. So if the place is more productive, and we're getting more<br />
output from fewer people, how do you deal with the implied redundancy?<br />
More growth. And how do you have more growth without high inflation,<br />
without needing to use monetary policy permanently to comatose the<br />
economy? Answer an incomes policy. We're the only party that has it.<br />
We're the only party that can let the economy grow rapidly, grow quite fast<br />
and still contain inflation. </p>
<p>I. When will we see that growth?<br />
PM: You saw the Governor of the central bank this morning making his points<br />
clear, his belief about the rates of growth coming through the economy.<br />
I. Prime Minister..<br />
PM: I've got a Cabinet meeting on 10 minutes ago.<br />
J: With the Victorian election just over, already the Kennett Government is<br />
looking at getting rid of 15-20,000 public sector jobs. Would you say that<br />
was a possibility if this policy was Hcwson's policy after the next election?<br />
PM: That Government is going to have to live by its actions and if it wants to<br />
decimate the public sector of Victoria it will have to run the gauntlet of<br />
public opinion. But the problcm in Australia is not that wage ratcs are<br />
uncompetitive. That is a key point. It is not that wage rates or that the<br />
economy is uncompetitive. The problem is that demand is too low.<br />
J: Has there been any recent pressure on you to halt tariff reductions?<br />
PM: I don't want to get into that debate. Go and talk to Laura ( Tingle) about that<br />
one. OK.<br />
J: Can you say that that story in The Australian this morning was true?<br />
PM: I'm not into discussing the Government's discussions. I'm already<br />
minutes past my Cabinet appointment. Thanks.<br />
ends </p>
