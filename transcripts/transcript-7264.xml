PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA16 DECEMBER 1987<br />
Unfortunately, Geoff marsh is unavailable for the Prime<br />
Minister's XI match at Manuka on 23 December.<br />
In his place, Laurie Sawle and I have selected Greg Matthews<br />
of New South Wales to play in the side. I am sure ACT<br />
cricket fans will appreciate another opportunity to see<br />
this entertaining and talented cricketer, who has been in<br />
very good form this season. 0034165 </p>
