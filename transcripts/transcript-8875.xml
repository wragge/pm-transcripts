INTRODUCTION<br />
U~ nemployment is unacceptable for the hardship and anxiety<br />
it causes individuals and families who directly<br />
experience it. But the effects of unemployment of the<br />
kind and extent presently existing in Australia go well<br />
beyond the victims. Because it creates acute and long<br />
lasting social problems and involves economic costs which<br />
prevent Australia from fulfilling its potential as a<br />
prosperous and fair society, unemployment affects us all.<br />
Unemployment is a phenomenon of our age. It is presently<br />
a significant problem in most if not all of the developed<br />
Western countries. But there is no comfort to be taken<br />
in knowing that we are not alone in this, nor any in<br />
spreading the blame. We cannot be complacent about high<br />
unemployment. I have said that reducing unemployment and<br />
assisting the long term unemployed is the Government's<br />
first priority. it must also be the nation's first<br />
priority. If we do not do all we can to mitigate the<br />
extent and the effects of unemployment, we betray large<br />
numbers of our fellow Australians, our children and our<br />
own ideals.<br />
BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYM4ENT<br />
The recession has been the most important recent cause of<br />
unemployment. In the course of it many companies learned<br />
to operate with a smaller workforce, and they are<br />
continuing to operate with fewer employees even as the<br />
economy -r. covers.-<br />
But while the recession has been substantially<br />
responsible for high unemployment, it is wrong to assume<br />
that the current problem is only a cyclical one.<br />
Australia experienced a sharp rise in unemployment in the<br />
mid 1970s,. associated with the first oil price shock.<br />
Since then the unemployment rate has moved upward in a<br />
series of large steps. ai. may. vo va, 14 mu. vvz r. V4 </p>

Since the mid 1970s unemployment has increased sharply<br />
but fallen slowly. After the 1982-83 recession,<br />
Australia had seven years of very strong employment<br />
growth. However the unemployment rate in 1990 was still<br />
just above the rate in 1982. Between June 1983 and June<br />
1990 well over one and a half million jobs were created,<br />
yet the number of unemployed fell by 150,000.<br />
Associated with these developments has been the emergence<br />
of long term unemployment. Currently more than one-third<br />
of all unemployed persons ( 371,000) have been unemployed<br />
for more than 12 months. About half of this number have<br />
been out of a job for more than 24 months. Experience<br />
from the 1980a shows us that strong employment growth<br />
alone will not be sufficient to reduce long term<br />
unemployment. Special measures are needed to ensure that<br />
the long term unemployed are able to compete successfully<br />
for the jobs which will be generated during the recovery.<br />
The Australian economy is currently growing faster than<br />
most other major economies and we expect the recovery to<br />
strengthen further through 1993 and 1994. However, the<br />
pace of economic recovery in the short term Is receiving<br />
little assistance from world growth. But Australia is<br />
well placed to benefit from the higher growth rates<br />
expected in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, recent<br />
history shows that we can achieve higher market shares in<br />
this part of the world. Hence, it is possible for<br />
Australia to grow faster than other industrialised<br />
countries, provided our policies further integrate<br />
Australia into the world economy.<br />

In the same way as the level and nature of unemployment<br />
have been undergoing fundamental changes, employment<br />
patterns and labour force participation behaviour have<br />
also altered substantially over the last three decades.<br />
In particular, the distribution of amp. aQment between<br />
males and females, part time and full time jobs,<br />
permanent and casual jobs, as well as the distribution of<br />
jobs between industries, occupations and skill levels<br />
have all altered appreciably.<br />
These factors undoubtedly help to explain why strong<br />
employment growth has not resulted in an equivalent fall<br />
in unemployment and we need to better understand them if<br />
we are to begin to solve the problem. </p>

Sinc, the 1960s the industrial structure of<br />
employment has changed markedly. The proportion of<br />
jobs generated by manufacturing industries has<br />
fallen from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. The<br />
absolute number of manufacturing jobs has also<br />
fallen. Employment growth has been strongest in the<br />
service industries. Their share of employment has<br />
increased from 54 per cent to 71 per cent. This<br />
long term trend has been accentuated by the recent<br />
recession as manufacturing employment has been among<br />
the hardest hit.<br />
Employment growth has been concentrated in high and<br />
average skill level jobs. Conversely, the demand<br />
for low skill and unskilled jobs has fallen.<br />
The nature of Ak~ llq required has also changed.<br />
Problem solving, interpersonal skills and the<br />
ability to work within a team are becoming more<br />
important as a result of changes in technology and<br />
work organisation. As multiskilling becomes more<br />
prevalent, an individual is also expected to be able<br />
to perform a wider range of tasks than was the case<br />
in the past.<br />
The nature of-york has changed. Part time<br />
employment has grown much more strongly than full<br />
time, and now accounts for almost one-quarter of all<br />
jobs, compared to 17 per cent in 1978. Part time<br />
workers now account for one-tenth of all hours<br />
worked. While most part time work involves low<br />
skill and offers little in terms of job advancement,<br />
the skill level of part time work has increased over<br />
the 1980s, at least for females.<br />
Married females, young people attending schools or<br />
universities and older workers account for nearly<br />
per cent of all part time workers.<br />
Three-quarters are female. Most part time workers<br />
are employed on a casual basis.<br />
Full time male employment as a percentage of the<br />
working age male population has been falling since<br />
1970. Clearly some of this is due-to early<br />
retirement and the longer periods which young people<br />
spend in education. However, even for males in the<br />
25-54 year old age group there was still a<br />
16 percentage point decline over the same period.<br />
A number of commentators have noted that the<br />
distribution of earnings has become more polarised.<br />
Employment is growing most rapidly among high and<br />
low pay jobs and middle pay jobs are growing only<br />
slowly, if not falling. This phenomenon appears to<br />
be particularly evident among full time, male jobs.<br />
TEL </p>

Significant changes have occurred in labour force<br />
participation behaviour. The proportion of the<br />
female population who are participating in the<br />
labour force has increased from 36 per cent in the<br />
mid 1960s, to almost 52 per cent today. On the other<br />
hand, participation rates have fallen among young<br />
people and older males. In part, these changes are<br />
in response to the changing nature of employment<br />
demand. But they also reflect changing social<br />
attitudes and expectations.<br />
It would be tempting to explain the stronger growth in<br />
part time and female employment and the loss in middle<br />
pay jobs in terms of the changes in the industrial<br />
structure of the economy. However, while this has<br />
undoubtedly been important, the story is much more<br />
complex. The incidence of part time employment has<br />
increased in all industries, not just in the service<br />
sector. Similarly, the notion that middle pay jobs are<br />
disappearing appears to be common to all industries.<br />
Furthermore, because developments have occurred in many<br />
industrialised countries any explanation must be based on<br />
more than purely Australian factors.<br />
Part of the explanation must lie in the changes in<br />
technology in recent decades. So radical and pervasive<br />
have these changes been, comparisons might be made with<br />
changes wrought by the Industrial revolution.<br />
Occupations have disappeared, others have merged and new<br />
occupations have been created. In virtually all oases<br />
the skills required to perform a job have changed. The<br />
number of workers required to perform a task or produce a<br />
certain level of output has fallen, while the skills and<br />
flexibility required from workers have increased.<br />
At the same time the shrinking global economy means that<br />
firms are better able to locate different parts of their<br />
production process in different countries. They are also<br />
changing their management structures and their corporate<br />
services are increasingly likely to be contracted out.<br />
All this has consequences for the amount and type of<br />
labour which employers wish to hire.<br />
We do not yet fully understand all these changes. Nor<br />
can we do much to alter the trends. But we cannot turn<br />
our back on them. We have to respond to these<br />
challenges. Governments, like modern companies, modern<br />
~.. economies -and modern workers -have -to be f lexible and<br />
adaptable. They have to be creative and pragmatic as<br />
well as compassionate.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE<br />
In order to respond effectively to both the cyclical and<br />
the structural nature of unemployment, we need;<br />
TEL </p>
<p>T3E1L:. May. 93 9: 14 No. 002 P. 06<br />
high but sustainable economic growth. This will<br />
require appropriate macroeconomic policies as well<br />
as a continued push for microeconomic and industrial<br />
relations reform;<br />
a skilled and adaptable workforce to respond<br />
positively to changing technology and industry<br />
demands and to be a source of competitive advantage;<br />
effective measures to assist the unemployed, and<br />
particularly the long term unemployed, so that they<br />
can obtain jobs during the recovery; and<br />
a better understanding of the long term developments<br />
in the labour market, their implications for<br />
unemployment and how best to respond.<br />
The Aconomic policy context<br />
High economic growth and strong employment demand are<br />
essential to reducing unemployment. But high economic<br />
growth must be sustainable over the long term. High<br />
rates of growth cannot be sustained if they lead to a<br />
blow-out in our current account deficit and a resurgence<br />
in inflation.<br />
To achieve high sustainable growth, national production<br />
has to grow strongly and faster than growth in<br />
consumption. Rigidities that constrain productivity and<br />
cause inflationary pressures must be reduced. The<br />
Government's policies therefore make up a coherent<br />
strategy to:<br />
improve our international competitiveness through<br />
higher productivity and lower inflation;<br />
improve our productive capacity through higher<br />
investment performance; and<br />
increase national saving to finance investment<br />
domestically without excessive recourse to foreign<br />
borrowing.<br />
The strategy comprises complementary monetary, fiscal and<br />
wages policies together with a continued push for<br />
microeconomic reform, including reform of the industrial<br />
relations system.<br />
-Wages policy -and industrial -relations reform under the<br />
Acoro wafeo usedonwokplcebaganng that<br />
increasingly links wage increases to productivity<br />
improvements, and on achieving wage outcom . es that<br />
maintain our inflation rate comparable to that of our<br />
major trading partners. This will help prospects for<br />
high employment growth, improve competitiveness and<br />
increase productive capacity.<br />

In addition to these macroeconomic policies, the<br />
Government has introduced specific measures to encourage<br />
investment, and hence employment growth.<br />
The company tax rate is being reduced to 33 per cent<br />
which, together with our policy of dividend imputation,<br />
makes returns to investors very attractive in Australia<br />
compared with many other countries and gives a highly<br />
competitive tax regime. A development allowance of<br />
per cent has been introduced for major projects which<br />
meet certain conditions. And an investment allowance of<br />
per cent will apply to investment in eligible plant<br />
and equipment ordered before July 1994 and installed<br />
before July 1995.<br />
Continued microeconomic reform, including competition<br />
policy, will help to remove impediments to greater<br />
flexibility and productivity and lower costs. We are<br />
already seeing the results, in terms of a highly<br />
creditable export performance in recent years, often from<br />
small and medium-sized firms in industries which have not<br />
been traditional exporters. The success of small to<br />
medium sized business is crucial to economic recovery and<br />
employment. A ski] Ied andI flexiblA workforce.<br />
Education and training play an important role in the<br />
development of competitive industries and hence<br />
employment growth. A skilled and innovative workforce<br />
committed to producing high quality products and services<br />
can be an important source of competitive advantage. It<br />
also minimises the risk of bottlenecks to growth<br />
resulting from skill shortages.<br />
A major task for governments is to improve the general<br />
education system, to improve the links between education<br />
and industry and to encourage industry's own efforts at<br />
training its workforce.<br />
Since the Labor Goverrnent came to office in 1983, there<br />
has been significant expansion and improvement in the<br />
area of post-compulsory schooling and hhr education.<br />
In 1980 only 34 per cent of young people continued in<br />
school to the equivalent of Year 12. By 1992 this<br />
proportion had risen to 77 per cent. Similarly, there<br />
-were .58-per-cent more Austra-lran -students enroled in<br />
universities in 1992 than in 1982. Over the decade to<br />
1992, the proportion of high school entrants who proceed<br />
directly to university increased from 15 per cent to<br />
per cent. </p>
<p>TEL 7<br />
Modern competitive economies demand high levels of<br />
technical skills right across their workforce. Both<br />
State and Commonwealth Governments have recognised the<br />
need for a national approach in-this area and the<br />
recently established Australian N~ ational Training<br />
Authority ( ANTA), chaired by Mr Brian Finn OA, will have<br />
an important role in advising governments on planning and<br />
policy for vocational education and training. ANTA will<br />
have substantial industry representation, to ensure the<br />
system is more responsive to the needs of industry.<br />
The Government remains committed to major reforms to<br />
entry level training and is currently funding pilot<br />
projects to test the Introduction of the Australian<br />
Vocational Certificate, which will provide more flexible<br />
routes for young people to acquire skills and training<br />
necessary for successful transition into their chosen<br />
vocations. The system will cover a broader range of<br />
occupations and industries, and competency-based training<br />
will mean that study programs can be tailored towards<br />
individual needs and take account of prior learning.<br />
Our experience of the 1980s shows that strong employment<br />
growth, of itself, will not be sufficient to reduce<br />
quickly unemployment and particularly long term<br />
unemployment. Specific measures are also needed which ensure that many<br />
of the new jobs created are filled by the long term<br />
unemployed. The Government has a range of labour market<br />
programs which provide this assistance. Evidence from<br />
the last few years also shows that labour market programs<br />
can be successful in getting the long term unemployed<br />
into jobs.<br />
Between 1990-91 and 1992-93 there has been almost a fourfold<br />
increase in expenditure on labour market programs<br />
from around $ 300 million to over $ 1200 million. Over the<br />
same period the number of program commencements has<br />
increased from 227,500 to an estimated 490,000.<br />
The Government has also altered * the mix df programs to<br />
give a greater emphasis to work experience'and to linking<br />
training more directly to employment. The number of<br />
people assisted under the wage subsidy program, JOBSTART,<br />
has increased from around 60,000 in 1991-92 to 150,000<br />
this-year.-Wage -subsidies -reduce.-the -initial cosit of<br />
hiring workers and help to overcome the reluctance of<br />
employers to take on the long term unemployed. T3EL1: . May. 93 9: 14 No. 002 P. 08 </p>
<p>TEL: 31 May .93 9: 14 No. 002 P. 09<br />

New work experience programs have also been introduced.<br />
The Landcare and Environment Action Program ( LEAP), which<br />
was introduced following the Youth Summit lest year, has<br />
been very successful. It provides young people with work<br />
experience in an area in which they are interested and<br />
combines this with structured training. The number of<br />
places in the program has been increased to respond to<br />
the great interest of young people to participate.<br />
On the iobskille program, participants receive work<br />
experience and training over a six month period. While<br />
the program Is relatively expensive, it assists the most<br />
disadvantaged of the unemployed to regain self<br />
confidence, acquire new skills and broaden their work<br />
experience. The Government has also more closely targeted assistance<br />
to the long term unemployed. This year, 62 per cent of<br />
program places went to the long term unemployed, compared<br />
to 51 per cent last year.<br />
The effectiveness of the change in program mix and the<br />
Increased expenditure per place is shown by the improved<br />
program outcomes that have been achieved over the last<br />
year. This improvement is all the more noteworthy given<br />
that employment demand was still weak and an increasing<br />
proportion of those assisted were long term unemployed.<br />
The assistance which labour market programs can provide<br />
to the long term unemployed is also shown by the fact<br />
that nearly 80 per cent of all Newstart Allowance<br />
recipients who obtained a job did so through a labour<br />
market program. Evaluations of programs have shown that<br />
participation in vocational training programs, SkillShare<br />
or JOBSTART increased a participant's chance of obtaining<br />
a job by around 50 per cent.<br />
Even when labour market programs are not successful in<br />
getting an unemployed person into a job, they can still<br />
help to maintain their attachment to the labour market.<br />
Overseas experience suggests that this is an important<br />
element in the long term unemployed gaining jobs.<br />
Labour market programs can also improve the efficiency of<br />
the labour market by alleviating skill shortages that may<br />
arise later in the recovery, and by ensuring that the<br />
long term unemployed remain active and competitive in job<br />
search. Jrhe-Government--is -determined -to-eclosely monitor its<br />
labour market measures to ensure that the mix of<br />
programs, the targeting of programs and the program<br />
parameters continue to provide cost effective assistance<br />
to the unemployed as the recovery gains strength. </p>

The delivery of labour market programs is closely linked<br />
to the provision of income support to the unemployed<br />
through the Zewutart strategy. The implementation of the<br />
Newstart strategy is Currently being evaluated by the<br />
Government and we wrill be taking this opportunity to seek<br />
improvements in the way in which labour market programs<br />
and income support are delivered.<br />
A Gow-nvamant White Pape? on EmploymAnt andi unamplnymgnt<br />
While the Government currently spends considerable sum's<br />
on labour market programs and our efforts compare well<br />
with other countries experiencing high unemployment, we<br />
recognise we need to do better. We need to understand<br />
the long term~ developments in the labour market and their<br />
implications for reducing unemployment and regaining full<br />
employment. We also need to examine whether existing<br />
measures could be re-arranged or new measures conceived.<br />
To this end the Government has decided to appoint a high<br />
level.-committee to prepare a Government Discussion Paper<br />
to assess current policies on unemployment.<br />
1. am also keen to see the committee examine alternative<br />
approaches, Including policies adopted in other OECD<br />
countries. Our search for solutions should not be confined to our<br />
shores, or to our experience. Most industrialised<br />
countries, like Australia, have begun a profound<br />
examination of unemployment and Its effect on societies.<br />
No country has produced a single, simple answer. Nor<br />
will they. The complexities and magnitude of the problem<br />
defy it.<br />
But in seeing what has been tried elsewhere, and in<br />
taking what is best and most suitable for Australia and<br />
combining it with our own ingenuity, perhaps this<br />
committee may begin to fashion an effective response to<br />
the problem.<br />
As an indication of the importance that I attach to this<br />
exercise, I have asked Dr Michael Keating,. Secretary of<br />
the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, to chair<br />
the committee. I am grateful that Professors Bob Gregory,'<br />
Barry Hughes and Jan Carter have agreed to bring their<br />
expertise in labour market and social policy analysis to<br />
the -task. The.-Committee will--also -include Mr<br />
Derek Volker, Secretary of the Department of Employment,<br />
Education and Training, Mr Tony Slunn, Secretary of the<br />
Department of Social Security and Me Mary Ann O'Loughlin,<br />
my Senior Adviser on social policy matters.<br />
Dr Bruce Chapman, who has already begun work for the<br />
Government on the effectiveness of labdur market<br />
programs, will also consult closely idith the expert<br />
commufittee. </p>
<p>The committee will be serviced by a high level Task Force<br />
established within the Department of Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet and drawing in expertise from other departments.<br />
The Tosk Force will be headed by Dr Meredith Edwards,<br />
First Assistant Secretary, the Department of Employment,<br />
Education and Training.<br />
The terms of reference which the Government has given to<br />
the expert committee are attached.<br />
I have asked that the Discussion Paper be prepared by<br />
December. This would be followed by extensive<br />
consultations. The Government would respond to the ideas<br />
and options raised in the Discussion Paper and the<br />
consultations in 8 White Paper on Employment and<br />
Unemployment to be prepared in the first half of next<br />
year. I would expect the special. Caucus Employment Task Force<br />
to facilitate the work of the expert committee,<br />
particularly in the public consultations. I have also<br />
asked EPAC to assist, both by acting as a sounding board<br />
for ideas and by the Office preparing background papers<br />
as required.<br />
I expect the committee to ask some fundamental questions<br />
about the future of work in Australia. These questions,<br />
while not new, go to the heart of the way our society<br />
functions.<br />
Questions such as: are we committed to the idea that<br />
everyone who wants to work should have a job? How should<br />
we respond to the rapid changes in technology and the<br />
greater uncertainty in our working lives? How can we<br />
best combine work with our family lives? Should<br />
Australian businesses continue to observe the maxim that<br />
leaner is always meaner, or are there more effective<br />
strategies for ensuring competitiveness?<br />
And if it is reasonable to ask this question of business<br />
and industry, it is also reasonable to ask other<br />
organisations, including trade unions, to examine their<br />
priorities and perceived self-interest to help find the<br />
answers. In short, the committee is being formed to ask if<br />
unemployment is a national responsibility, how best do we<br />
-all -share An-solving it?<br />
My hope is that out of this process, we will better<br />
understand the choices and trade-of fs which need to be<br />
made if we are to regain full employment, how long this<br />
might take, and what more can be done to alleviate the<br />
problems presently facing unemployed Australians and<br />
their families. </p>
<p>TEL: 31. May .93 9: 14 No. 002 P. 12<br />
And of course if in looking at the problems facing<br />
Australians going through hard times a certain fellow<br />
feeling is aroused, and the sentiments of fairness and<br />
equity are re-kindled, end the bonds between us a11 are<br />
strengthened, then the process will have served not only<br />
the unemployed but all Australians and the nation. </p>
