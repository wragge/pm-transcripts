PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FRIDAY, 29 JUNE 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING PREMIER'S CONFERENCE<br />
LIVE ON ABC'S<br />
Question The Premiers have been painting you over the last couple of<br />
days, you and your Treasurer I suppose, very much as the<br />
financial villians. How much do you believe though that the<br />
Premiers and the States that they run are capable of reining<br />
in their expenditure in the circumstances in which we all<br />
find ourselves now.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I believe they could rein in expenditures much more than many<br />
have. You've only got to look at the growth of State Public<br />
Services over the last five years compared to the growth of<br />
the Commonwealth. The growth in the States has been very<br />
great indeed. I haven't seen the signs of stringency that<br />
we have in the Commonwealth. In most of the recent State<br />
budgets there have been pretty generous expenditure programmes<br />
and generally tax cuts in addition and very few increases of<br />
taxes. But I think one of the things that might be misunderstood<br />
is that on the revenue side, because of the formula, the Commonwealth<br />
was extraordinarily generous to the States and of course the<br />
Premiers wouldn't be emphasising this. But in revenue they<br />
got $ 644 million more 13% to 14% more. That's more than enough<br />
to make up for the shortfall in loan funds. If they want to<br />
spend that revenue money on capital works, on housing, then<br />
it is entirely their decision to do so. I would certainly hope<br />
that they do so.<br />
Question Are you worried particularly, given that you felt that you had<br />
to make cuts somewhere, about the consequences of the cuts in<br />
capital works, particularly unemployment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would certainly be worried about it if the States use all that<br />
vast addition to recurrent expenditure on recurrent expenditure.<br />
You see it is nearly 14% more. Much more than enough to cover<br />
inflation. If they put a large part of that, as they can if they<br />
want to, into capital works, well then the capital works industry<br />
is not going to be harmed at all. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Question Mr. Hayden is forecasting I think an extra 20,000 unemployed<br />
as a result of those cuts. Is that, do you think, a reasonable<br />
figure?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Mr. Hayden is always forecasting various things and I don't want<br />
to comment on that. If I could say one or two other things about<br />
this Premiers Conference.<br />
Question Do you think there will be more people unemployed, though, as<br />
a result of the cuts in capital works.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I can see no need for it at all, providing the States trandfer<br />
that great excess in the revenue account to capital. That is<br />
within their capacity to do so and I hope that as they get back<br />
to their own States they will do what is best for their own<br />
people and make that transfer. Many of them have in past<br />
years. You've only got to look at the very great increases in<br />
revenue funds year after year after year and at the exception of<br />
this year, the very great increases in the semi-government loan<br />
programmes which I think have nearly doubled in four or five years.<br />
Question Is it fair to say that one of the objectives of the Premiers<br />
Conference, from your point of view, was to try and keep the<br />
States out of the money markets in loan raising activities to<br />
some extent.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not only the States, but also the Commonwealth. Because Governments<br />
have sought to raise much more money in recent years there has<br />
been pressure on the money markets. It has put pressure on<br />
interest rates. A lot of institutions, after they are holding so<br />
much Government paper, they just don't want any more Government<br />
paper. They think their portfolios get unbalanced. There is<br />
a general view in the Commonwealth that there has been too much<br />
Government paper, too much Government borrowing and that it needed<br />
to be restrained.<br />
Question<br />
Mr. Howard, your Trea surer, indicated yesterday that money supply<br />
was running at something like 12 percent. Do you think that<br />
anything that's been achieved over the last two days is going to<br />
help bring it under-control. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The mini-Budget in May was a necessary first step in that.<br />
I would believe that the decisions we've made now will also<br />
help the money markets. We will have to wait and see, but of<br />
course the most important instrument will be our own Budget.<br />
I think Mr. Howard has made quite clear the reasons for that<br />
increase in money supply. We didn't like it. But it wasn't all<br />
bad news;* a gobd wheat crop and better wheat prices and more<br />
capital inflow. That all in part is good news for Australia<br />
but it does have some other consequences as well.<br />
Question Do you think that we can anywhere near to the Budget target<br />
between I think it was 6% and 8% money supply.<br />
PrimeMinister-<br />
That was in this financial year and how much of 19 78/ 79 have<br />
you got? No. It is going to be over that by about the amount<br />
that Mr. Howard indicated. If I could, while I am speaking to<br />
you mention one or two other aspects of the. Premiers Conference.<br />
It is not only financial matters that we discussed. At this<br />
particular meeting we put the final touch to a historic argument<br />
that has gone on between the Commonwealth and the States and has<br />
disturbed governments for years. That comes out of the Seas and<br />
Submerged Lands Act. We've now got to final agreement with the<br />
States on all the issued involved; offshore mining, fisheries,<br />
marine parks, and all the things that affect the States offshore,<br />
whether it is within the territorial sea or outside the territorial<br />
sea. There will be a package of legislation I believe in the<br />
Budget session which h~ as been agreed with the States and this<br />
has shown how governments working together can put to rest an<br />
argument that had been created by a High Court decision. But<br />
they've put the argument to rest by rational and sensible discussion<br />
over a couple of years period. I haven't got the slightest doubt<br />
that'the decision we made in the Premiers Conference today on<br />
this issue will be regarded as a historic landmark in the<br />
constitutional development of Australia.<br />
Question Can we look at another issue, not directly related to the<br />
Premiers Conference. What is the Government intending to do about<br />
the Telecom dispute which is having very serious effect at the<br />
moment. Prime Minister<br />
We were examining this a few moments ago with Telecom officials<br />
and Ministers who are in Canberra. We will be on Monday morning<br />
seeking leave to appear before Mr. Justice Staples and have the<br />
matter referred to a Full Bench. Telecom have been wanting the<br />
matter heard to the Full Bench for some time. They have been<br />
wanting the matter arbitrated. They have not been able to achieve<br />
that. It is becoming very serious. The first step is to try and<br />
get it to a full bench. The Government of course has other<br />
options open to it, but we hope the matter can be arbitrated. </p>
<p>4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
We fail to understand why the normal system has not achieved<br />
that up to the present time because it is not a question of<br />
saying Telecom are right and the union is wrong. It is a question<br />
of getting the matter to arbitration.<br />
Question<br />
Are Telecom acting under Government instructions at the moment,<br />
or at least under Government advice.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We discussed the matter together, but they have been trying to<br />
get the matter to arbitration for days and days. We support<br />
them in that. They weren't doing that under Government direction.<br />
It was their own inclination; here's a problem, they've got people<br />
making claims. They don't want to go off into a sweetheart deal<br />
outside the indexation guidelines because if we did that we<br />
certainly would jump on any Government instrumentality. What<br />
we are saying is " let it go to arbitration. Let it be arbitrated".<br />
That seems to me to be pretty reasonable. Telecom will abide<br />
by the result of that arbitration and of course the Government will<br />
have to whether we like the result or not. But at the moment,<br />
because of some strange views around, we can't even get it to<br />
arbitration within the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.<br />
