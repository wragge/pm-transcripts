NATIONAL SONG<br />
The Government has decided that there should be a pol~ l to<br />
decide on a National Song to be played on purely Australian<br />

The poll will be held concurrently with the referendum on<br />
tcour constitutional questions.<br />
God Save The Queen will remain the National Anthem on<br />
Regal and Vice-Regal occasions.<br />
In addition to the use of God Save The Queen the poll will<br />
enable Australians to choose between God Save The Queen,<br />
Advance Australia Fair, Song of Australia and the tune of<br />
Waltzing Matilda as the appropriate song on national occasions. </p>
