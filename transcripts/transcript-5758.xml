V<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 23 FEBRUARY, 1982.<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION FOR MR. A. A. ARMSTRONG_<br />
Mr. Speaker, I move," ta this House expresses its deep<br />
regret at the death yesterday of Mr. A. A. Armstrong,<br />
Member for Riverina, 1965-69, places on record its<br />
appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and<br />
tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family<br />
in their bereavement".<br />
Mr. Speaker, it-is with great personal regret that I<br />
learned of the death of Bill Armstrong who held the seat<br />
of Riverina for the Country Party in this Parliament from<br />
1965 to 1969. Adam Alexander Armstrong, or<br />
Bill as he was known to us all, was born on 1 July 1909 at<br />
Deniliquin, New South Wales and was elected to this<br />
Parliament in the by-election of 27 February, 1965, following<br />
in the footsteps of Hugh Roberton who had held Riverina<br />
for the Country Party from 1949 to 1965. He made his<br />
maiden speech on 13 May 1965 and although Bill was a Member<br />
of this Parliament for a relatively short period till 1969,<br />
he served it and the electors of Riverina with distinction.<br />
During his-time in the Parliament, he was a mernber of<br />
the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and was a member of<br />
the Parliamentary delegation which visited South-East Asia<br />
in June/ July 1966. He served on a number of backbench<br />
committees especially the Committees on National Development<br />
and Economics and Finance and his interest in these areas<br />
enabled him to-pursue his own interests so successfully,<br />
to the ultimate benefit of his electorate and country.<br />
Moreover, as a former President of the Conargo Shire and as<br />
Chairman of the Deniliquin Pastures Protection Board, he was<br />
able to bring to his Parliamentary duties a useful collection<br />
of community experience.<br />
Like so many of his generation, Bill Armstrong saw military<br />
service during the Second World War. He served with the<br />
38th Australian Infantry Battalion in 1939 and 19.40, was made<br />
a lieutenant in 1940 and joined the 2nd AIF on 1 September 1942.<br />
He saw service overseas in the South-West Pacific area from<br />
1943 to 1945 and was decorate with the Military Cross and<br />
mentioned in despatches. </p>
<p>2<br />
Bill Armstrong's great love was racing. He was official<br />
starter for the Victorian Racing Club from 1951 to 1970 and I<br />
am sure Honourable Members will recall his presence at many<br />
a Melbourne Cup. It was for these and many other public<br />
services that he was made an Officer of the Order of the<br />
British Empire in 1972.<br />
Mr. Speaker, to his widow, three sons and daughter, on<br />
behalf of the Government I extend our deepest sympathies<br />
at their sad loss. His service to his electorate and to this<br />
Parliament is a matter of public record. With his passing we,<br />
as members of this House, have lost a fine friend and colleague.<br />
