    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mr Beazley's latest attempt to explain away his embarrassment about the contents of the Labor Government's submission in the Kruger Case has only worsened his predicament.</p>
<p>The fact is that the former government's submission used arguments similar to those that I used last week.</p>
<p>Nothing Mr Beazley said in Parliament or elsewhere today can gainsay the fact that he has been caught out with a blatant inconsistency.</p>
<p>He said one thing in government and a completely different thing in opposition.</p>
