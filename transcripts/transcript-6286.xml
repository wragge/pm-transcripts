L PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR AEDIA 16 December 1983<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Premier of New South<br />
Wales, Mr Wran, today announced an extension of time for<br />
the Royal Commission headed by Mr Justice Stewart to conduct<br />
its inquiries into the activities of the Nugan Hand Group.<br />
Mr Justice Stewart has already presented his first interim<br />
report which covered three of the Royal Commission's terms of<br />
reference. In summary, these terms of reference required an<br />
exairination of whether there had been any improper interference<br />
with the investigations of any law enforcement body into the<br />
Nugan Hand Group. This report was tabled in the Federal<br />
Parliament on 6 December 1983.<br />
The remaining terzis of reference require an examination of<br />
whether the Nugan Hand Group engaged in activities which<br />
involved contravention of the laws of the Commonwealth and<br />
New South Wales.<br />
Mr J* ustice Stewart is to report on these aspects of his<br />
terms of reference by 30 June 1984. </p>
