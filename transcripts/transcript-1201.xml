OPERING OF THE MILLS CROSS RADIO TELESCOPE<br />
HOSKI ! STO'N, N. S. W. 19TH NOVEMBER. 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Chancellor, Mr. Ambassador, Vise-Chancellor, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen I think I ought to begin by congratulating the<br />
Vice-Chancellor on the astonishing fact that although he was<br />
taught Latin in the same place as myself, he has since<br />
acquired, in the reading of it, an Italian accent. ( Laughter)<br />
Another thing I would like to say to you; it has<br />
been coming into my mind steadily while all these people who<br />
have preceded me have stolen the thunder. It was said of the<br />
late Sir Edmnmd Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia<br />
and later on a distinguished Justice of the High Court of<br />
Australia that he usually said, when the Chief Justice had<br />
spoken: " I concur'and this was held to be a reat proof of<br />
idleness on his part. It wasn't. He very frequently wrote<br />
a judgment himself of some significance but having heard it<br />
delivered in substance by the Chief Justice, he had enough wit<br />
to say, " I concur." And I am jolly well tempted to follow his<br />
example. I could easily wind this up adequately by saying,<br />
" I concur; I declare the Cross open but I won't go quite so<br />
far as that, but the thing kept beating into my mind.<br />
It was said by you, Sir, although you know far more<br />
about scientific matters than I do, that you didn't understand<br />
what it was about. Jell I could help you on that. This is<br />
perfectly simple. It's rather a long-winded way of listening<br />
in to what's going on upstairs, you see. As I understand it,<br />
that's the whole secret of this matter that when you want to<br />
listen in to what is going on above and you want to probe the<br />
recesses of one of the galaxies, particularly Professor Bok's<br />
favourite galaxy, all you do is to go along and get somebody<br />
like Professor 1ills and say " This is what I want to do. Fix<br />
it up." Hey presto, here it is. That is a summarised account<br />
of this enterprise. But I, like you Sir, will never understand<br />
it. I think when politicians start to make it their business<br />
to understand the last subtleties of physical science, that will<br />
bt the end of good politics and the beginning of an awful lot of<br />
bad scientists in office. ( Laughter)<br />
But the outstanding feature today, apart from these<br />
very important matters Mr. Foley has described so admirably, the<br />
great thing today is that this is a splendid example of co-operation<br />
in the field of science between the greatest and most<br />
powerful country in the world and one of the smallest in relative<br />
terms in the world. Getting near: 200M in the United 6tates,<br />
11M. in Australia, but I have more than once taken comfort from<br />
the fact I referred to it on one or two occasions in the<br />
United States, Mr. Ambassador that when that great man and<br />
species of genius, Thomas Jefferson, first became President of<br />
the United States, the population of the United States was 5M.<br />
one-half of the number which we now have in Australia and yet,<br />
quality being more important than quantity, on the basis of<br />
that relatively small population, we've seen the most tremendous<br />
developments in modern history, and therefore in Australia we are<br />
not going to be too downcast by the fact that the population is<br />
only 11. It is increasing very satisfactorily. . iear e not<br />
going to be downcast about it because there are two things that / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
count. One is quality and this ou must have yourselves<br />
and develop yourselves, and the oher is a spirit of co-operation<br />
with all other people in the same field so that knowledge<br />
becomes shared. These two factors are both illustrated today.<br />
After all, Mr. Ambassador your great country and<br />
mine have a certain parallelism in teLir history. On a<br />
recent occasion a year or two ago I made what was supposed<br />
to be a powerful speech at wonticeilo, celebrating Thomas<br />
Jefferson and I took occasion to remind all those Rresent<br />
that the Declaration of Independence in the United 6tates<br />
created two new countries one was yours and one was mine.<br />
This was literally true, because as The result of the<br />
Declaration of Independence, the export of convicted persons<br />
from England to the United States what is now the United<br />
States came to an end, and they had to be sent somewhere,<br />
and with unerring skill, they selected Sydney. ( Laughter,<br />
applause). So that's how it all began.<br />
I have also had occasion to remind the people of<br />
Great Britain when I have spoken there that they don' need<br />
to be too superior about the fact that some convicted persons<br />
were sent to Australia and some convicted persons sent to the<br />
United States because the statistical records show conclusively<br />
that the majority of people convicted over that period remained<br />
in England. ( Laughter)<br />
And so, Sir, our two nations began their story by<br />
a similar cause, in the technical sense, quite early in the<br />
piece and at the same time. But think of what we have in<br />
common with the United States. A lot of people are always<br />
looking for some rather improper motive. The imputation of<br />
motive is one of the commonest of human failings. And we<br />
are told that we, of course, are friendly with the United States<br />
because they are great and powerful and they will defend us.<br />
Well they are great and they are powerful, and I think they<br />
will defend us, but this is the lowest possible level on which<br />
to put our association. The truth is that we are friends because we have<br />
ideas in common, we have traditions in common, we have the<br />
same instincts, cultivated instincts in common, we both<br />
believe in the same kind of world and are determined to make<br />
our own contribution to making it a better one. These are<br />
great foundations for friendship, and here today we have the<br />
perfect example of how this works out. This.... I almost said<br />
King's Cross.... I don't want to steal that from Professor<br />
MAessel. He seems to me to have got everything else. But<br />
this eat instrument of science is itself, as we have been<br />
remined, a product of association between Cornell University<br />
so famous in this field and the University of Sydney, the olTest<br />
university in Australia, a university, the founders of which,<br />
125 years ago, would have been stag ered to think that thin s<br />
of this kind could happen as a result of activities in whic Ãµ<br />
their university was taking a part.<br />
Now Sir I don't want to talk to you any longer.<br />
You haven't failed to notice there are a lot of flies. This<br />
is not proof that we are in New South ', ales. It rather suggests<br />
that we are in Canberra where we specialise on flies. I remember<br />
one time during Mr. Lyons' Government we were all taken out on<br />
to the lawn in front of Parliament House and photographed,<br />
movie camera, to be put on the movies on 3aturday night.<br />
And Mr. Lyons kept introducing us one at a time. 19. Hughes, a a / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
the late Mr. Hughes was among us, and we were all photographed<br />
doing this.... ( Laughter) The scientists hadn't got busy at<br />
that time producing maladorous things that ruin your clothes and<br />
are supposed to keep the flies away. were all standing there,<br />
doing this, you see, and on the way back to the House, little<br />
Billy Hughes took me by the arm and looked up at me he had<br />
to hysically, at any rate and I said, " That ought to look<br />
rather impressive, do you think, on Saturday night?" " Oh,"<br />
he said don't be funny. Then they look at that, they'll nudge<br />
each other and they'll say, ' Bill we've been had.'"<br />
Sir, it's a great occasion. I won't prolong<br />
your troubles. I'm very honoured to be here, very delighted<br />
o be allowed to come on to strange territory for this purpose.<br />
I wish the whole enterprise well; I acknowledge the tremendous<br />
support that has been given by the LIuclear Foundation. We have<br />
heard a little about it from Mr. Foley who is among its most<br />
active people but this has been a splendid example of co-operation<br />
between the business world, not notably scientific in its<br />
own right any more than we are as politicians, but between the<br />
business world, the scientific world, the university world.<br />
This kind of association of this type must go on and on in<br />
Australia until every university is not only a source of the<br />
receipt of funds but is creating a community of its own and<br />
making itself part of the overall community of the country.<br />
This, I think, will argue the best reilts and the brightest<br />
future. Sir, retrospectively I say: I concur. I declare<br />
the Cross open. </p>
