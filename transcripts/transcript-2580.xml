PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS., P. M. No 45/ 1972<br />
A. L. P. IMMIGRATION POLICY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P.<br />
There are three elements in the A. L. P. Immigration Policy<br />
which are relevant to non-EuropeQn immigration to Australia.<br />
1. the ' non discrimination' clause inserted into the A. L. P.<br />
Platform at the Launceston Conference.<br />
2. the policy of basing immigration entirely on sponsorship<br />
by relatives, friends and employers resident in Australia.<br />
3. the decision to grant assisted passages to non-European<br />
immigrants.<br />
The first requires " the avoidance of discrimination on any<br />
grounds of race or colour of skin or nationality".<br />
The second would bias the composition of our migration<br />
programme heavily in the direction of those countries which have an<br />
ingrained tradition of sponsorship of friends and relatives that<br />
is, the Southern European, Middle Eastern, and non-European countries.<br />
This ' pyramid' or ' chain' migration as it is sometimes called in not<br />
characteristic of the Northern European and North American countries<br />
or Britain. These patterns of sponsorship for various countries are<br />
clearly established in statistics of the Department of Immigration.<br />
The third element, the granting of assisted passages, would<br />
undoubtedly increase the pressures for entry to Australia from non-<br />
European countries. From practical experience, we know that, even<br />
under present restrictive policies and without assisted passages<br />
very large ntumbers of enquiries are received involving very large<br />
numbers of people.<br />
If, despite this established evidence, Mr. W'nhitlam claims<br />
that under a Labor Government there will be fewer people of non-<br />
European descent admitted to Australia than at present, he has a<br />
clear obligation to explain how it will be achieved. In the view of<br />
the Government it would require a savage and ruthless use of the<br />
immigration power to prevent entry into Australia that would be<br />
difficult to sustain.<br />
Mr. Whitlam's obligation to explain where he stands is * all<br />
the more pressing when it is realised that the aims of a Labor<br />
Government in this field could be achieved purely by administrative<br />
action without the Parliament or the Australian people being aware<br />
of what was happening.<br />
PERTH, 4 May 1972. </p>
