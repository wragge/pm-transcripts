<p>GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Joining us now is the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard. Mr Howard,</p>
<p>   this morning are you happy with the reaction to last night's</p>
<p>   budget?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am. People have seen the long term good sense of getting the</p>
<p>   country back in the black. It gives people a great sense of confidence,</p>
<p>   continuity, consistency and hope about the future. It helps to lock</p>
<p>   in those low interest rates which are so important to homebuyers,</p>
<p>   the low inflation which is so important to business confidence.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Getting the budget in the black, is that the single-most important</p>
<p>   thing?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's the most important thing but not the only thing. I think</p>
<p>   the benefits for self funded retirees and the elderly in the community</p>
<p>   are a very important social component of the budget but when you</p>
<p>   are paying your way again, you open up almost limitless possibilities</p>
<p>   because you have the freedom and the capacity, it's like a</p>
<p>   family that's paid off the mortgage. They can then turn their</p>
<p>   attention to spending their resources on something else.</p>
<p>GATFIELD:</p>
<p>It does of course have its critics and chief amongst those, the</p>
<p>   Opposition are saying, nothing here whatsoever for the unemployed.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's not right because business confidence will reduce unemployment</p>
<p>   and I just say to Mr Beazley, you presided over the highest level,</p>
<p>   11.2 per cent of unemployment since the great depression. Since</p>
<p>   we've been in office we've generated 280 000 new jobs</p>
<p>   and unemployment is now at its lowest level for eight years.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>But it's not going to get any better in the next 12 months?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will get a little better and the important thing is to go on</p>
<p>   generating new jobs and in the last two years we've generated</p>
<p>   280 000.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>There's also the current account deficit which is projected</p>
<p>   to rise to $31 billion. Is that good enough?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we naturally want it lower but it is largely a product of</p>
<p>   the downturn in Asia and the impact that that's having on our</p>
<p>   exports and having a very low inflation rate and having a budget</p>
<p>   surplus, we have in fact delivered the very budget that is needed</p>
<p>   when you have a rising current account deficit.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>One of the most important areas of course is health care. The critics</p>
<p>   say there's nothing there for health care. In real terms, there's</p>
<p>   no benefit.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's just wrong. I mean, for example, we're giving the</p>
<p>   states a 15 per cent real increase over five years. That's</p>
<p>   in a time of zero inflation. That's not nothing. That's</p>
<p>   a 15 per cent real increase.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Most of them aren't accepting that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, states tend to be a little bit like that. They always want</p>
<p>   more.</p>
<p>GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Do you still think they're going to come around?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, whether they come around or not, we will honour the promise</p>
<p>   we made at the Premiers' Conference but a few of them have</p>
<p>   signed up since the Premiers' Conference and I think we might</p>
<p>   get one or two more but even if they don't their citizens will</p>
<p>   not be hurt. The people living in New South Wales and Victoria,</p>
<p>   two of the states whose Premiers are holding out, can I say to the</p>
<p>   citizens of those two states, we won't let you down. We will</p>
<p>   honour in full the promises we made at the Premiers Conference.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>I spoke last night to Senator Bob Brown too who expressed very,</p>
<p>   very grave disappointment at the lack of incentive there for environmental</p>
<p>   issues.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Heavens above. We are providing a tax incentive for land care, the</p>
<p>   most generous tax incentive in history for land care, he says there's</p>
<p>   nothing. I mean, really, he's just on automatic, on automatic</p>
<p>   whinge.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>He says the sale of Telstra obscures.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It doesn't obscure. Look, it doesn't obscure anything.</p>
<p>   The sale of one third of Telstra has delivered the largest capital</p>
<p>   fund ever for Australia's environment. We are spending more</p>
<p>   than any other government in capital on restoring Australia's</p>
<p>   environment and we're doing it where it matters. Land degradation</p>
<p>   repair and things of that kind which are really of great ongoing</p>
<p>   significance.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Older Australians appear to be the biggest winners out of this budget,</p>
<p>   don't they?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They have done very well out of it. The extension of the Seniors</p>
<p>   Health Card which means that everybody in that self-funded retiree</p>
<p>   bracket practically up to a combined income of $67000 a year will</p>
<p>   get the free pharmaceuticals that are now available to pensioners.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Was it a deliberate strategy on your part to actually target older</p>
<p>   Australians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are entitled, belonging to a generation that was very thrifty</p>
<p>   and saved for their retirement, they are entitled to get some recognition</p>
<p>   of that. You've got to also remember that while low interest</p>
<p>   rates are great if you are buying a home, if you are lending money</p>
<p>   then it's not so flash and I think we've recognised that</p>
<p>   in relation to many of those self-funded retirees who really have</p>
<p>   seen the more negative side of lower interest rates.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>I suppose the big thing missing out of the budget last night was</p>
<p>   the question of tax reform.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's coming.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Of course, it is. When?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At the right time.</p>
<p>GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Have you got a timeframe, on that though?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Treasurer and I have got a few scenarios in mind but we are</p>
<p>   still working on the package but it will be good and I am sure it</p>
<p>   will be widely applauded by the Australian community as delivering</p>
<p>   incentive and also delivering a great deal of fairness because I</p>
<p>   think what the great bulk of the people in the middle want is a</p>
<p>   tax system that gives them a break and makes sure that those people</p>
<p>   who aren't paying their fair share do so in the future.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>That was implicit in Mr Costello's remarks last night, about</p>
<p>   a glowing future. So we can expect major tax cuts?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You will certainly get personal tax cuts, absolutely. There will</p>
<p>   be significant personal tax cuts within the framework of a total</p>
<p>   restructuring of our taxation system.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>And your comments yesterday, or reported comments yesterday to the</p>
<p>   Party Room about this possibly being the last session of Parliament</p>
<p>   before an election?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Just a customary, cautionary words from the Prime Minister at this</p>
<p>   time of the political cycle.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Not going to read any more into it than that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no more but no less.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Ideally, when would you like to go to the election?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At the right time.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Will it run its full term, this Parliament?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know, I don't know that yet. That will depend</p>
<p>   on a lot of facts.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>You just haven't made up your mind?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't.</p>
<p>GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Does reaction to the budget come into that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Part of it. There are a lot of other things that come into it as</p>
<p>   well.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Such as?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All the other things that will happen between now and when I decide</p>
<p>   to call the election.</p>
<p> GATFIELD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you very much.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
