    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am happy to announce that New Zealand's Prime Minister, Mrs</p>
<p> Jenny Shipley, has accepted my invitation to visit Australia. Mrs</p>
<p> Shipley will visit Sydney on 19-20 February.</p>
<p>New Zealand is one of Australia's closest and most important</p>
<p> partners. I am confident this visit - Mrs Shipley's first since</p>
<p> she became Prime Minister - will build on the strong relationship</p>
<p> between our two countries.</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley will come to Kirribilli House on 19 February for dinner.</p>
<p> We will continue our discussions at a meeting the next day.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with Mrs Shipley the many issues in which</p>
<p> we have shared interests, both trans-Tasman and in our region, including</p>
<p> our mutual commitment to assisting the peace process on Bougainville</p>
<p> and the impact of the economic crisis in Asia.</p>
