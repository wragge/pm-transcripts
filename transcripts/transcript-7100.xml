PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT BANQUET GIVEN BY<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY DR ATTEF MOHAMMED NAGUIB SIDKY<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT, CAIRO<br />
1 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
M-MRS-STDKY<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS o<br />
I HAVE GREATLY-APPRECIATED, MR PRIME MINISTER, YOUR WARM WELCOME,<br />
YOUR GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE VERY BENEFICIAL<br />
EXCHANGE OF VIEWS WE HAVE ENJOYED TODAY.<br />
ALTHOUGH THE LINKS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES GO BACK TO TWO<br />
WORLD WARS IN WHICH AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS CAME TO EGYPT, THERE<br />
HAS BEEN NO VISIT BY AN AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER TO YOUR<br />
COUNTRY IN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS.<br />
TO RECALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT LAST VISIT RELATED AS<br />
IT WAS TO THE SUEZ CRISIS IS TO APPRECIATE HOW PROFOUND HAVE<br />
BEEN THE CHANGES WE HAVE WITNESSED OVER-THE THREE INTERVENING<br />
DECADES,<br />
THE FAILURE OF THE SUEZ INTERVENTION WAS A-VERY SIGNIFICANT<br />
EVENT IN THE ENDING OF COLONIALISM AND THE EMERGENCE OF<br />
NATIONALISM ON THIS CONTINENT.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS I THINK PROVEN ITS CREDENTIALS AS AN EFFECTIVE<br />
OPPONENT OF COLONIALISM, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST FIFTEEN<br />
YEARS. WHETHER IT BE IN OUR OWN REGION OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC,<br />
OR IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST APARTHEID IN SOUTH<br />
AFRICA, WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR COMMITMENT TO SELF-DETERMINATION<br />
AND DEMOCRACY.<br />
TODAY, EGYPT AND AUSTRALIA SHARE A MATURE, STABLE AND FRIENDLY<br />
RELATIONSHIP.<br />
c </p>
<p>FOR ITS PART, WHILE THE MIDDLE EAST REMAINS A FOCUS OF<br />
CONSIDERABLE TENSION, EGYPT HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE<br />
PRINCIPAL PARTIES WORKING FOR PEACE.<br />
WITH THE ATTAINMENT OF THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS IN 1978, EGYPT<br />
AND ISRAEL TOOK THE HISTORIC DECISION TO BRING TO AN END A<br />
LONG PERIOD OF CONFLICT. YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS ANEGOTIABLE,-<br />
PEACEFUL-ROUTE -TOWARDS-THE SETTLEMENT OF-WHAT---<br />
ONCE SEEMED IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES.<br />
I MUST IN PARTICULAR PAY TRIBUTE TO YOUR LATE PRESIDENT,<br />
ANWAR SADAT, FOR HIS FORESIGHT AND COURAGE IN ENTERING INTO<br />
THAT AGREEMENT.<br />
PRESIDENT MUBARAK HAS CARRIED FORWARD THE WORK OF PEACE<br />
WITH GREAT DETERMINATION. ONLY LAST SEPTEMBER, FOR EXAMPLE,<br />
HE AND MR PERES DECLARED 1987 TO BEA_-YEAR OF-NEGOTIATIONS_-<br />
FOR PEACE.<br />
UNHAPPILY, OTHER VITAL ASPECTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE<br />
REMAIN UNRESOLVED. I HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS<br />
VISIT TO THE AREA TO INFORM MYSELF DIRECTLY OF THE PROSPECTS<br />
FOR PEACE.<br />
MY TALKS IN AMMAN ENABLED ME TO LEARN AT FIRST HAND THE<br />
SINCERE COMMITMENT OF KING HUSSEIN AND THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR PEACE WITH ISRAEL.<br />
IN ISRAEL, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPOSURE TO A WIDE SPECTRUM<br />
OF OPINION WHICH INFORMS ISRAELI POLICY. THERE, TOO, I FOUND<br />
A SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE WITH ALL ISRAEL'S NEIGHBOURS.<br />
I </p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE WILL BE NO<br />
PEACEFUL, JUST AND LASTING SOLUTION TO THE DISPUTE BETWEEN<br />
ISRAEL AND ITS ARAB NEIGHBOURS WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE A GENERAL<br />
RECOGNITION OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.<br />
WE REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY COMMITTED TO THE SECURITY OF ISRAEL AND<br />
ITS RIGHT TO EXIST WITHIN SECURE AND RECOGNISED BOUNDARIES IN<br />
ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 2A2 AND 3388,<br />
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A RESOLUTION OF THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION<br />
IS CENTRAL TO ANY MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT.<br />
WHILE IN ISRAEL I HAD VALUABLE TALKS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF<br />
PALESTINIAN OPINION. THESE TALKS HAVE CONFIRMED THE VIEW<br />
CONSISTENTLY HELD BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THAT THE<br />
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE MUST HAVE THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION<br />
INCLUDING THE RIGHT, IF THEY SO CHOOSE, TO INDEPENDENCE AND THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT STATE.-IN THE<br />
COURSE OF A NUMBER OF THE TALKS I-HAVE HAD SINCE LEAVING CANBERRA,<br />
I HAVE ENCOUNTERED AN EMERGING AND IMPORTANT VIEW THAT A<br />
CONFEDERATION WITH JORDAN IS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT WHATEVER ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINALLY SETTLED WILL<br />
DEPEND ON DECISIONS INVOLVING THE PARTICIPATION AND AGREEMENT<br />
OF ALL PARTIES CONCERNED.<br />
NOW, MR PRIME MINISTER, IN EGYPT, A COUNTRY OF GREAT IMPORTANCE<br />
AND CONSTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND, I VALUE<br />
THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE HAD TODAY, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING<br />
THE VIEWS OF PRESIDENT MUBARAK ON THE SEARCH FOR PEACE.<br />
I AM ALSO VERY INTERESTED TO. HEAR EGYPTIAN VIEWS ON DEVELOPMENTS<br />
IN THE WIDER MIDDLE EAST REGION, INCLUDING THE TRAGIC WAR BETWEEN<br />
IRAN AND IRAQ AND YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANT ISLAMIC SUMMIT<br />
IN KUWAIT. I </p>
<p>4.<br />
AUSTRALIA DOES NOT SEEK TO EXAGGERATE ITS CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE<br />
EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT THIS VISIT OF MINE UNDERLINES<br />
OUR RESPECT AND FRIENDSHIP FOR THE COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES OF<br />
THE REGION AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DESIRE FOR AN END<br />
TO CONFLICT AND TENSION AND THEIR ASPIRATIONS FOR PROSPERITY.<br />
THAT DESIRE AND THAT ASPIRATION ARE SURELY INTERCONNECTED.<br />
RESOLUTION OF THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE AS A WHOLE, BUILDING<br />
ON-THEACCOMPLISHMENT-SOFCAMPDAVID,_ COULDCLEARLYHAV-E-AN<br />
ENORMOUSLY FAVOURABLE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND<br />
PROSPECTS FOR-EGYPT-AND-THE-REGION.--IT-COULD-OPEN-THE-WAYFOR<br />
PRODUCTIVE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES WHICH-ARE TODAYDIVIDED<br />
FROM ONE ANOTHER.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
As WE BOTH KNOW THESE ARE NOT EASY ECONOMIC TIMES. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY IS ENCOUNTERING SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND<br />
PRESSURES. THE CONSTRUCTION OF POLICIES TO OVERCOME THESE<br />
DIFFICULITIES AND TO FACILITATE SUSTAINED GROWTH HAS-BEEN<br />
A MAJOR PREOCCUPATION OF MY GOVERNMENT.<br />
ACCORDINGLY, I HAVE REAL SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR THE<br />
MUCH GREATER CHALLENGES FACED BY YOUkRGOVERNMENT IN ITS<br />
EFFORTS TO ENSURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TO IMPROVE THE<br />
QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE.<br />
FOR EGYPT, AS FOR AUSTRALIA, THE SUCCESS OF DOMESTIC POLICIES<br />
OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT WILL BE CRUCIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE. As I HAVE<br />
REPEATEDLY STRESSED, MOST RECENTLY IN OPENING THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
SYMPOSIUM AT DAVOS ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT<br />
FAIRER AND MORE OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADING ARRANGEMENTS BE<br />
SECURED. </p>
<p>IN THIS AREA THE MAJOR ECONOMIC POWERS HAVE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.<br />
NOT ONLY TO REFRAIN FROM PROTECTIONISM IN THEIR INTERNATIONAL<br />
BEHAVIOUR BUT TO PRACTISE THEMSELVES WHAT THEY PREACH TO OTHERS<br />
IN MATTERS OF ECONOMIC DISCIPLINE AND ADJUSTMENT AND COOPERATION.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE COOPERATION-BETWEEN-OUR-TWO COUNTRIES----<br />
-CAN-CONTRTBUTE--ALBE-tT-N-A-SMAtL-WAY-T-O-ASSI-STiNG-EGYPT---S<br />
ECONOMIC ENDEAVOURS.<br />
SINCE OUR TWO-COUNTRIES ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC-RELATIONS -IN<br />
1950, OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS HAVE GROWN IN RANGE AND COMPLEXITY.<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA, EGYPT HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER,<br />
ESPECIALLY FOR EXPORTS OF OUR WHEAT. AT THE SAME TIME WE<br />
FULLY RECOGNISE THAT EGYPT WISHES TO EXPORT MORE TO AUSTRALIA<br />
AND I ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HELP YOU IN THAT EFFORT.<br />
IN NEW AREAS OF CO-OPERATION, RANGING FROM SUPPLY OF STEAMINGCOAL,<br />
TO ARID FARMING TECHNIQUESTO TOURISM, I BELIEVE THERE<br />
IS GOOD POTENTIAL FOR US TO WORK TO OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT.<br />
I WOULD LIKE ALSO TO RECORD OUR SATISFACTION WITH THE<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE CONSULTATION THAT TAKES PLACE BILATERALLY AND IN<br />
MULTILATERAL FORUMS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND EGYPT ON INTERNATIONAL<br />
ISSUES.<br />
A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS THE. STRONG. SUPPORT OUR TWO<br />
COUNTRIES HAVE GIVEN TO THE CAUSE OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION,<br />
TO THE NPT, AND TO THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL SAFEGUARDS.<br />
EGYPT'S ROLE HERE HAS BEEN EXEMPLARY.<br />
EGYPTIANS HAVE BECOME VALUED MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. THEIR PRESENCE HAS INCREASED THE<br />
KNOWLEDGE OF AND INTEREST IN THE LAND OF THEIR BIRTH AND<br />
ENCOURAGED EFFORTS TO PROMOTE COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL RELATIONS.<br />
, I </p>
<p>TAKING ALL THESE STRANDS TOGETHER THEN, MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
WHAT BECOMES CLEAR IS THAT WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH<br />
SHARED INTERESTS, MUTUAL RESPECT AND FRIENDSHIP FOR ONE<br />
ANOTHER FAR OUTWEIGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN US.<br />
I HOPE, AND CONFIDENTLY EXPECT, THAT MY VISIT TO EGYPT<br />
WILL SERVE TO DEVELOP OUR TIES EVEN FURTHER.<br />
MAY I NOW, MR PRIME MINISTER, PROPOSE A TOAST TO YOU, MRS SIDKI,<br />
TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT AND TO THE CONTINUING FRIENDSHIP<br />
BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF AUSTRALIA AND EGYPT.<br />
