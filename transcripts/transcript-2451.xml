MR BURY'S RESIGNATION<br />
Tribu te P~ r ime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
I wact to pay a personal tribute to the dedicated service<br />
that Mr Bury has given to Australia as a member of the Commonwealth<br />
Minis try. After an earlier period as Minister for Air, Mr Bury<br />
was Minister for Housing in 1964-1965, then a new portfolio. He<br />
was Minister for Labour and National Service from 1966 until 1969.<br />
He served as Commonwealth Treasurer in 1970 and early 1971, and<br />
since March 1971 he has been Minister fcr Foreign Affairs.<br />
This is an impressive record, and one in which he<br />
can take great pride. He has earned the gratitude of all Australians.<br />
My own association with Mr Bury has been a long and<br />
pleasant one.<br />
CANBERRA, I August 1971 </p>
