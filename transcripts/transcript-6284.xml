/ 7 PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 December 1983<br />
The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Everingham,<br />
has clearly won the support of the electors of the Territory.<br />
I congratulate him on the result which he achieved in<br />
yesterday's election.<br />
The Federal Government will now continue to work with the<br />
Northern Territory Government for the interests of all of<br />
the people of the Territory.<br />
While the Federal Government will consult the N. T. Government<br />
on issues relevant to the Territory it will not be deterred from<br />
implementing policies which have the support of the majority<br />
of Australians.<br />
Despite the swing against the ALP In the Territory poll there<br />
is no evidence to suggest that the Federal Government does not<br />
retain the support of the people of the Northern Territory. </p>
