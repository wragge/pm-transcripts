    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce the receipt of the report of the review of corporate governance arrangements of statutory authorities and office holders conducted by Mr John Uhrig AC, which fulfils an important election commitment.</p>
<p>  The Government acknowledges the importance of the performance of statutory authorities and office holders for the overall health of the Australian economy, particularly those that impact on the business community.</p>
<p>A response to the review will be released in the next few months.  It will include a timetable for the implementation of the second stage of the review whereby the Government will assess statutory authorities and office holders against the principles outlined in Mr Uhrig';s report.</p>
<p> I would like to thank Mr Uhrig for his efforts in undertaking the review. His wide business experience meant that he was ideally equipped for the task.  </p>
