CHECK AG AINS P. MR EMjAR= Rn! UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF AUS TRALIAN COUNCIL OF<br />
SOCIAL SERVICE'S CONGRESS<br />
SYDNEY OCTOBER 3, 19g1<br />
1991 is barely nine months gone, yet in those months we have<br />
witnessed more change in the world than in any full year of<br />
my lifetime.<br />
Over the weekend, just when the world was catching its<br />
breath after the dissolution of the Soviet Communist Party<br />
and the break-up of the Soviet Empire, President Bush<br />
announced a unilateral nuclear arms reduction program of<br />
unprecedented size and scope. This courageous and farsighted<br />
decision is yet another signal that the Cold War now<br />
belongs to history, and that most horrifying acronym<br />
M. A. D. Mutually Assured Destruction can finally be<br />
eliminated from our strategic lexicon.<br />
These are signposts towards the chance of a better world<br />
than humanity has thought possible since World War II, when<br />
the great hopes at war's end were to be blasted by the<br />
nightmare of nuclear confrontation. The way ahead remains<br />
immensely complex and difficult. But the one thing that<br />
stands out i~ s the enduring passion of humanity for<br />
democracy, f-or social justice, for the twin goals of<br />
political arid economic freedom.<br />
Australians have been among the fortunate few who have<br />
enjoyed those freedoms, however they may have sometimes seen<br />
to be threat~ ened in the worst periods of the Cold War.<br />
Indeed, too often we may have taken them for granted.<br />
I would not want to insult the sacrifice of those men and<br />
women in so much of the world who are attempting to throw<br />
of f the dead weight of the command economy and<br />
totalitarianism by measuring our Australian experience<br />
against the: Lrs.<br />
But AustraliLa also has faced the pressure of change.<br />
Many Australians and their families have been affected by<br />
the great changes the Australian economy our Australian </p>
<p>society is undergoing, as we undertake the necessary tasks<br />
of making our economy more internationally competitive.<br />
I don't expect any section of the Australian community to<br />
accept hardship blindly, passively, uncomplainingly. That<br />
is precisely what social justice in the Australian democracy<br />
stands against: we are not in the business of imposing<br />
diktats as a government, or accepting diktats as a people.<br />
A continuing and central element of the policies pursued and<br />
implemented by my Government has been to ensure that the<br />
principles of social justice go hand in hand with the<br />
principles of economic reform<br />
that means people don't get thrown of f unemployment<br />
benefit after nine months<br />
that means people are covered by a universal health<br />
care system irrespective of their ability to pay<br />
that means people have security in their retirement<br />
income through their age pension in the short term and<br />
legislated superannuation in the long term<br />
that means assistance for low to moderate income<br />
families.<br />
A Labor Government means we are building a more just society<br />
at the same time as we are embarking on the necessary tasks<br />
of economic reform.<br />
We can never accept that economic change must mean social<br />
injustice. Ladies and gentlemen, with all our long tradition of freedom<br />
we still have much work to do in securing social justice for<br />
all Australians.<br />
Much has been achieved, much remains to be done. But one<br />
thing has remained obvious. There can be no social justice<br />
in Australia, or anywhere else, without economic progress.<br />
There can be no social justice without an internationally<br />
competitive economy. We must have an economy able to stand<br />
on its own feet, based on an expanding manufacturing sector,<br />
on adding value to our unique suite of natural resources so<br />
that we are less reliant on our commodity export base, and<br />
thereby less exposed to the volatility of international<br />
commodity prices.<br />
Economic progress means securing low unemployment and<br />
permanently lower inflation through sustainable growth.<br />
Let me emphasise that it is no part of our policy that high<br />
unemployment should be allowed to become anything like a<br />
permanent feature of our society. </p>
<p>For a Labor Prime Minister the idea of permanently high<br />
unemployment is repugnant but there is only one way to cure<br />
unemployment in the long term. We must attack the causes.<br />
We must create sustainable employment in an efficient,<br />
export oriented economy not make up artificial job<br />
creation schemes, where the jobs finish with the money.<br />
We have never wanted to step from the path of job growth.<br />
But had we niot, three years ago, done something about the<br />
fact that spending was growing at twice the rate of<br />
production 1: he world would have extracted a far heavier<br />
price f rom us with much graver social consequences than ore<br />
in fact have experienced.<br />
But these past 12 months of job loss should not mask our<br />
achievement of the previous 7 years of job creation. Even<br />
after taking into account recent job losses, a total of<br />
million new jobs have been created that's 177,000 new<br />
jobs a year., My message is that we did it before and we<br />
will do it again, as the economy moves, healthier than<br />
before, out of recession.<br />
We have joined the league of low inflation nations. Our<br />
inflation rate is forecast to drop to 3% in this financial<br />
year. At 3.4% it is already below the 4.3% average of our<br />
major trading partners in the OECD.<br />
We must keel) inflation at levels comparable with our trading<br />
partners. Low inflation is critical to achieving economic<br />
progress and to building a just society. High inflation<br />
distorts key economic decisions on savings and investment<br />
and eats away the incomes and savings of low and fixed<br />
income earners.<br />
As I have been saying to industry bodies over the past<br />
weeks, to achieve sustainable economic growth, and the jobs<br />
growth it will bring, we must build a competitive economy.<br />
And we are doing this, although many Australians are just<br />
beginning to realise that restructuring is not only being<br />
talked about: it is being achieved the great change that<br />
has occurred in our manufacturing industry is testimony to<br />
our success.<br />
Over the eight year period to 1990-91 the value of<br />
manufacturing exports increased by 220 per cent. This has<br />
resulted in a dramatic improvement in the Balance of<br />
Payments wit~ h, for the first time in ten years, a surplus on<br />
goods and services forecast for 1991-92. The August figure,<br />
released earlier this week, showed record exports for the<br />
fourth successive month and the biggest ever recorded<br />
surplus on goods and services.<br />
The benefits of the, sometimes tough, policies we have had<br />
to pursue are now being seen.<br />
These benefits will continue to flow and become felt widely<br />
through the economy. </p>
<p>The Budget forecasts show real growth returning to the<br />
economy in 1991-92 with growth through the year of 3 3/ 4 per<br />
cent. Concerted employment growth should begin to be<br />
evident early in 1992.<br />
We are coming out of the recession, but we are not<br />
complacent. I gave an undertaking to the ACTU that we will<br />
carefully study the ACTU Charter for Jobs and we are meeting<br />
with them later this month. We will continue to consult<br />
with relevant groups in the community.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the thrust of this government's policy<br />
effort has been to get the basics of the economy right,<br />
because without the basics we cannot build a just society.<br />
But social justice means much more than creating an<br />
internationally efficient economy. It is not difficult to<br />
think of economies apparently more efficient and competitive<br />
than ours which are deficient in personal and political<br />
freedoms.<br />
Social justice demands a fairer Australia, a compassionate<br />
Australia. In restructuring the economy we cannot and must<br />
not neglect those affected by the changes.<br />
In the transition to recovery, my Government is providing a<br />
comprehensive safety net for those people directly affected<br />
by the downturn.<br />
First, benefits have been increased substantially in real<br />
terms over the period of my Government. For example, the<br />
real income of an unemployed single adult has increased by<br />
26% for those not renting privately and by 54% for those<br />
renting privately. These real increases are protected by<br />
the indexation of all welfare payments.<br />
Second, the introduction of Newstart represents a<br />
substantial positive commitment by Government to assist<br />
those most in need. It is aimed at assisting unemployed<br />
people, particularly those disadvantaged in the labour<br />
market, to move from social welfare dependency into<br />
employment through active job search and training.<br />
Initially the Newstart initiative raised some concerns in<br />
the community, not least from ACOSS. But I understand that<br />
it is becoming more accepted as some of the concerns prove<br />
to be unfounded.<br />
The Newstart initiative has been supported by increased<br />
expenditure on labour market programs by 50%, from $ 399<br />
million in 1990-91 to an estimated $ 598 million in 1991-92.<br />
In addition, TAFE funding has increased to $ 420 million and<br />
funding for entry-level and skills training programs has<br />
increased to $ 180 million.<br />
The purpose of these measures is twofold. First, to<br />
strengthen the skills of job-seekers and workers<br />
particularly the most disadvantaged job-seekers the long </p>
<p>termi unemployed, workers with literacy and language<br />
difficulties, and young people. And secondly, to ensure that<br />
skill shortages do not emerge during the recovery, as they<br />
did after thle 1982/ 83 recession.<br />
The last line in the safety net is emergency relief. The<br />
demand for this type of assistance increases markedly during<br />
recession and emergency relief agencies find themselves<br />
under great pressure to meet the genuine needs of people in<br />
crisis. Emergency relief funding was increased in the Budget by<br />
$ 3 million to a total of $ 10.84 million.<br />
I am able to announce today that, since the Budget, the<br />
Government has re-examined the role of the emergency relief<br />
program in providing vital " last resort" financial<br />
assistance to people in need, and has agreed to provide<br />
additional funding of $ 3.5 million this year to bring the<br />
total funds available under the program in 1991-92 to $ 14.4<br />
million. In taking this decision the Government has recognised that<br />
unemployment is one of the major factors impacting on the<br />
demand for emergency relief assistance, and has agreed that<br />
in future years the level of emergency relief funding<br />
provided in * the budget will be related directly to the<br />
forecast level of unemployment for that year.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, my Government has the policies to<br />
secure a return to sustainable jobs growth, although<br />
unemployment could increase in the short term. The Budget<br />
strategy for economic recovery is on track. This is<br />
obviously an absolutely fundamental prerequisite to<br />
establishing a more just society.<br />
To build a truly just society, however, requires action on a<br />
much broader front. We need to direct assistance to those<br />
in need; ensure that our rapidly ageing population has a<br />
secure retirement income base; provide an equitable and<br />
sustainable health care system; improve Government services<br />
and their delivery; and improve the places where people<br />
live and work.<br />
My Governent is responding to each of these challenges.<br />
In 1987, my Government delivered a historic reform to assist<br />
low-income families by introducing the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement. As a result, we have massively increased in<br />
real terms support for low-income families.<br />
The 1991-92 Budget builds on those achievements. We have<br />
made the families support system simpler and more<br />
consistent; increased assistance to low-to moderate-income<br />
families; provided stronger incentives for people to seek<br />
jobs; and delivered greater assistance to the primary<br />
carer. </p>
<p>I am sure you are familiar with the changes announced in the<br />
Budget. Suffice to say that these reforms including an<br />
increase in the FAS threshold, measures to improve FAS takeup,<br />
and the payment of Guardians Allowance to sole parents<br />
will benefit over 200,000 low to moderate income families.<br />
Also, all payments for children will now be made to the<br />
primary carer, usually the mother. The major beneficiaries<br />
are spouses of Jobstart, Newstart and Sickness Allowance<br />
recipients. They will directly receive benefit payments for<br />
their children.<br />
Furthermore, they will continue to get payments for their<br />
children through the Social Security system even though<br />
their family circumstances change. This means that families<br />
making the transition from unemployment to employment will<br />
have the security of knowing that their FAS entitlement will<br />
be assessed and paid to them quickly.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, our population is rapidly ageing to<br />
the point where in just 20 years time, around 20% of<br />
Australians will be aged over 60 years and in 40 years time<br />
more than 26% of Australians will be aged over 60 years.<br />
An increasingly ageing population will create massive<br />
strains unless we act now. The security of retirement<br />
incomes of the current generation depends on us acting now.<br />
Social justice demands that we act now. That is why we<br />
announced in the Budget that we will be legislating for a<br />
minimum level of employer superannuation support of 9% by<br />
the year 2000.<br />
I am aware that ACOSS is concerned about the equity of the<br />
current superannuation tax arrangements.<br />
We announced in the Budget that the tax arrangements for<br />
personal contributions to superannuation will be reviewed.<br />
The review will focus on simplification and on ensuring that<br />
the arrangements are equitable.<br />
Your concerns will be assessed in that review, although I<br />
would point out that my Government has already significantly<br />
reduced inequities in the superannuation area.<br />
Prior to 1983, only 40% of the workforce had any<br />
superannuation cover largely restricted to high income<br />
earners and to the public sector. Virtually unlimited<br />
deductions were available for employer contributions, and<br />
only limited deductions were available for the self-employed<br />
and for unsupported employee contributions.<br />
The Government has transformed this situation by increasing<br />
coverage through award superannuation and the Superannuation<br />
Guarantee Levy announced in the Budget, and by changing the<br />
tax system to help focus superannuation on retirement income<br />
provision. </p>
<p>Superanniuation tax concessions are ultimately regulated by a<br />
person's reasonable benefit limit which is based on a<br />
tapered scal. e to ensure a more equitable distribution of tax<br />
concessions. Reforms to the reasonable benefits limit<br />
implemented in July 1990 have enhanced its effectiveness and<br />
improved thet access of low income earners to superannuation<br />
tax concessions.<br />
Medicare is a central plank of our social justice strategy.<br />
It is the most stable system of health insurance in our<br />
history. It: guarantees access to basic health services for<br />
all Australians and, at the same time, has contributed to<br />
restraining our total health costs.<br />
However, the: current growth rate in medical services,<br />
particularly in general practice, radiology and pathology,<br />
are unsustainable. At current growth rates, the number of<br />
services per person will double in just 20 years.<br />
That problem is not a problem of Medicare it is a problem<br />
that flows from open ended insurance for fee-for-service<br />
medical practice.<br />
Therefore, we are restructuring the Medicare benefits<br />
arrangements to promote more appropriate use of medical<br />
services, higher quality of care and more efficient use of<br />
health resources. At the same time we are providing for<br />
improved protection for families from high out-of-pocket<br />
costs for private medical services. The Government has also<br />
maintained protection for people on low incomes and the<br />
chronically ill.<br />
These reforms are designed to entrench Medicare into the<br />
Australian landscape. The Government is, nevertheless,<br />
aware that the announced reforms to Medicare has aroused<br />
concerns in -the community, including from ACOSS. You will<br />
be aware that a special Caucus working party will be<br />
assessing these concerns in a Report which will be<br />
considered shortly.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the July Special Premiers' Conference<br />
agreed to fundamental microeconomic reforms to develop a<br />
more efficient and competitive economy.<br />
It is now time to ensure that the singular opportunity<br />
offered by the Special Premiers' Conferences is similarly<br />
harnessed to improve social and community services.<br />
I have always believed that co-operation flowing from<br />
consensus is the best, and, ultimately, the only way of<br />
achieving a better and more efficient Federal structure<br />
which is the aim of the Special Premiers' Conference<br />
initiative.<br />
Current intergovernmental arrangements have developed in an<br />
ad hoc way since Federation and although some find them<br />
comforting, ultimately they will fail us. </p>
<p>The search for a better way has involved looking at all<br />
options for the management of current joint responsibility<br />
programs. Community views have provided an important input<br />
to this process. In the health, housing and community<br />
services areas, for example, ACOSS itself has co-ordinated<br />
national consultations with the community welfare sector.<br />
The results of this process will be considered at the<br />
November Special Premiers' Conference. Importantly, there<br />
has been a willingness to consider new structures and new<br />
arrangements which may hold the promise of an end to the<br />
present in-built causes of inefficiency and poor service<br />
delivery. One thing that will not be changing, however, is my<br />
Governent's commitment to social justice and what it means<br />
in terms of equitable access to appropriate and adequate<br />
services. Let me make this very clear: the Commonwealth will not walk<br />
away from any of its social justice responsibilities and<br />
objectives. This Government has a very strong record in<br />
advancing social justice through protecting the interests of<br />
the more disadvantaged members of the community. In<br />
conjunction with the States, priority has been given to<br />
improving services for groups including Aborigines, women,<br />
the aged, the disabled and the homeless.<br />
The Government's commitment to these principles and<br />
priorities remains unchanged. Any agreement on future roles<br />
and responsibilities must protect the interests of clients<br />
and must clearly specify national interests and agreed<br />
national objectives.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, where people live can have an<br />
important influence on, and be an underlying cause of,<br />
difficulties in gaining access to employment and services.<br />
Initiatives addressing both ends of the locational issues<br />
spectrum are being advanced in 1991-92.<br />
The first of these concerns Australia's cities; the second<br />
relates to the very different problems faced by the people<br />
in rural and remote areas across the whole of the north of<br />
our continent.<br />
Both of these sets of problems have dimensions which cut<br />
across the usual boundaries of responsibility between levels<br />
of government and service-delivery agencies. For this<br />
reason they have tended to be put into the " too hard"<br />
basket. We must overcome that inertia.<br />
The Building Better Cities Program will provide $ 800 million<br />
over five years to State and Territory Governments to assist<br />
them with projects that will improve linkages between work,<br />
housing and services, to improve public transport and to </p>
<p>address issues of housing density and better governmental<br />
processes relating to land use and service delivery.<br />
With 60 per cent of Australians living in our five largest<br />
cities it is essential that we address the problems of our<br />
urban environment now, if there is to be real social justice<br />
in the 21st -century.<br />
For Australians living in remote areas, our decision to<br />
develop, by mid-1992, a North Australia social justice<br />
strategy, is clear evidence of my Government's awareness<br />
that problems of access to housing, education, employment<br />
and services are by no means confined to city dwellers.<br />
To overcome the " tyranny of distance" we need to go beyond<br />
services designed for urban environments and make more<br />
imaginative attempts to develop programs better suited to<br />
the specific geographic and demographic characteristics of<br />
the north.<br />
To carry this work forward we have established a North<br />
Australia Taskforce, whose aim is to develop and recommend<br />
practical improvements, based on an assessment of actual<br />
needs, rather than on the limitations of existing programs.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Opposition Leader is<br />
going to speak to you tomorrow. The Coalition's priorities<br />
are plain; economic dogma over social justice.<br />
The Opposition' s proposed consumption tax is deeply<br />
regressive. The' winners will be the most privileged the<br />
losers will foe the lower and middle income earners, the<br />
poor, the aged, the disadvantaged. Bread and milk will be<br />
dearer luxury cars will be cheaper.<br />
The consumptiLon tax would smash our historic inflation<br />
gains, and cause a once and for all reduction in the value<br />
of accumulated savings.<br />
Combined with massive Government spending cuts, a<br />
deregulated : labour market and a 0-2% inflation target it is<br />
a policy package designed to drive unemployment much higher<br />
indeed, there could be no other possible outcome from such<br />
a package. And the measure of their compassion is their<br />
policy to cut: people of f unemployment benefits after<br />
9 months.<br />
It is a policy package which makes my Government more<br />
determined than ever to deliver a more just society, a<br />
fairer Australia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I began by saying what an<br />
extraordinary year 1991 has been, and how in the events of<br />
this year, especially in the progress towards the removal of<br />
the nuclear t: hreat hanging over us all, we can find hope and<br />
a way forward. </p>
<p>In the past Australians have shown that we are adaptable and<br />
capable, clever and compassionate. The difference now is<br />
that, as I have said many times this year, we are a nation<br />
of 17 million in a world of 5 billion people. It is a not a<br />
world composed of old friends who will help us out. It is a<br />
super competitive world, where each nation is as selfinterested<br />
as the next.<br />
The challenge for us is to create in this country an<br />
internationally competitive economy at the same time as<br />
advancing our agenda for social justice and social change,<br />
and providing for the underprivileged and disadvantaged.<br />
That is what we are in government to achieve. There are<br />
hard and complex decisions to be taken, and we will take<br />
them. Not from an ideological point of view, but from a<br />
compassionate and fairminded view of where we are going, and<br />
what we must do to get there.<br />
Australia will face the twenty first century with an<br />
internationally competitive economy, but it will be a fairer<br />
Australia striving to be fairer still. </p>
