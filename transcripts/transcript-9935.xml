PRIME MINISTER 17/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
FUNDING FOR QUEEN VICTORIA MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY, LAUNCESTON<br />
I am delighted to announce that the Government will provide $ 1.15 million over the next<br />
three years($ 350, OOO per year) to assist in the exhibition and conservation program of<br />
Launceston's Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.<br />
This will be a partnership project with the National Museum of Australia, assisting in<br />
sharing of expertise and resources, and providing links to increase the national profile of<br />
the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery. It flows from the Government's<br />
commitment to support regional museums through the National Museum's Regional<br />
Access Program.<br />
The Government believes that the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery has the<br />
potential to become a cultural institution of outstanding national significance, in addition<br />
to its role as a catalyst in the intellectual and cultural life of Launceston and Tasmania.<br />
Of particular importance is the re-development by the Queen Victoria Museum and Art<br />
Gallery of the adjacent Launceston railway yards as one of the most important industrial<br />
heritage sites in Australia. The active exhibition plro~ rarn ana conservalton work , hop<br />
planned for the site will expand on the theme of innovation, creativity and achievement,<br />
linking the successes of the past with current developments and experiences, in the<br />
arts, sciences and other areas.<br />
On 25 January 1996, the Government announced a program of additional funding for<br />
the National Museum of Australia to develop State and regional partnership projects, to<br />
increase travelling exhibitions and to produce on-line cultural material.<br />
While the National Museum has worked closely with other regional and State Museums,<br />
Launceston's will be the first partnership project under the new program. This<br />
recognises the importance of the Queen Victoria Museum's collection, its commitment to<br />
community and regional history and the national significance of the Launceston railway<br />
yards project. </p>
