CHECK AGAINST. DE1J. VR EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF NEW MARITIME HEADQUARTERS<br />
SYDNEY 25 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
More than ten years ago, in 1980, an idea for a Maritime<br />
Command Centre was developed as part of a larger plan to<br />
modernise the Garden Island Dockyard and Fleet Base<br />
facilities. In the years that followed, the project evolved<br />
to reflect the growing need for joint force operations, and<br />
to keep pace with the dramatic advances in the technology of<br />
computing and communications.<br />
The result is that today we see a completed Maritime<br />
Headquarters building that brings together in one place all<br />
the functions of command, control, communications and<br />
intelligence -that are essential to the effective maritime<br />
operations of the Australian Defence Force.<br />
These Headquarters, staffed by members of the Army, Air<br />
Force and Navy, embody our commitment to ensuring that the<br />
three arms of the Defence Force work effectively together<br />
under joint commands.<br />
It has been fortunate that the Maritime Headquarters<br />
commenced operations in August 1990 the month that Iraq<br />
invaded Kuwait. From the outset, the Headquarters have been<br />
tested by the many operational demands placed on it by our<br />
deployment to the Gulf. And the results have proved that<br />
this maritime headquarters has been well-planned and is<br />
doing excellently the job of supporting our ships in the<br />
Gulf. Our ships are serving today in the Gulf to support the<br />
United Nations1 determination that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait<br />
must not be allowed to stand.<br />
On the very day on which Saddam Hussein invaded the Gulf,<br />
the UN Security Council in Resolution 660 demanded that Iraq<br />
withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally. That is still the<br />
UN's position., </p>
<p>At any time s. ince his invasion, Saddam Hussein could have<br />
withdrawn; but at every stage he has instead rejected the<br />
UN's resolutions and ignored the actions of the<br />
international community, regardless of the cost to his<br />
country, to his people and to the world.<br />
The international community has not acted hastily to force<br />
Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait. It has acted steadily and<br />
deliberately for nearly seven months to persuade him, and<br />
then to coerce him, to give up what he had no right to in<br />
the first place.<br />
First the UN applied mandatory and comprehensive economic<br />
sanctions. Saddam Hussein ignored them. Then the UN<br />
imposed a deadline of 15 January. Saddam Hussein ignored<br />
that too. WhEin that deadline passed, the coalition with the<br />
backing of the UN undertook a major air offensive against<br />
Iraq's military and strategic capabilities.<br />
With shocking recklessness and against all reason Saddam<br />
Hussein still clings to Kuwait despite the damage that has<br />
already been done to his country and people, and the<br />
tragedies that: lie ahead for them.<br />
He has spurned the diplomatic efforts of the Soviets and<br />
others over recent days to secure his compliance with UN<br />
resolutions, and he has ignored the coalition's deadline<br />
for withdrawal..<br />
Saddam Hussein. can have been under no doubt; had he started<br />
to pull his forces out of from Kuwait as the UN resolutions<br />
required, his armed forces would not have been attacked as<br />
they withdrew.<br />
Diplomatic efforts to avoid the ground war failed for the<br />
same reasons that all previous efforts to solve the crisis<br />
have failed; because Saddam Hussein has refused to withdraw<br />
unconditionally from Kuwait.<br />
Australia, through our naval task force in the Gulf, will<br />
play its part in this final phase of the Gulf crisis, just<br />
as we have played our part throughout the past seven months.<br />
The deployment of Australia's naval forces to the Gulf has<br />
been a major undertaking.<br />
I know a great deal' of work had to be done by the ADF to<br />
ensure that our vessels and crews were quickly prepared and<br />
dispatched to the Gulf, and were at the peak of their<br />
performance on their arrival, ready to join with the<br />
multinational forces opposing Iraq.<br />
One central key to our effective participation in that<br />
force, and to -the efficient performance of that work, lies<br />
here in the Maritime Headquarters and in the command<br />
arrangements and philosophy which underlie its development. </p>
<p>The close link between the Maritime Headquarters and<br />
representatives of the other Services ensures that the most<br />
efficient and effective use is made of Australia's defence<br />
capabilities. So let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Maritime<br />
Commander and staff at the Maritime Headquarters for all the<br />
outstanding work they have done in support of Australia's<br />
commitment of forces to the Gulf.<br />
The public gaze often rests on the exploits of Service<br />
personnel abroad. And I am sure that everyone here today,<br />
in this grave climax of the Gulf crisis, shares with me a<br />
deep pride in the way in which our Servicemen and women are<br />
acquitting themselves in the Gulf.<br />
But this is also a time to pay tribute to the<br />
professionalism and commitment of those whose contribution<br />
is made here in Australia, as an essential part of our Gulf<br />
operations. Here in the Maritime Headquarters lies the<br />
responsibility for the planning and coordination of<br />
Australia's first contribution to combat operations since<br />
the Vietnam War. It is your expertise and your dedication<br />
on which we al. l rely.<br />
My congratulations to you all on the important job you are<br />
doing. Our men and women in the Gulf are in good hands.<br />
I would now like to declare open the new Maritime<br />
Headquarters. </p>
