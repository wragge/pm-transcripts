SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCHING OF PROFESSOR PATRICK O'FARRELL'S BOOK<br />
" THE IRISH IN AUSTRALIA" UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
SYDNEY 15 OCTOBER 1986<br />
Mr Horton, Ambassador Small, Irish Australians, ladies and<br />
gent lemen<br />
Professor O'Farrell in his introductory remarks to The Irish<br />
in Australia says: " There is a nice irony in the situation<br />
of the Irish Government joining the congratulatory<br />
celebration of the Bicentennial of the foundation of a<br />
British colony to which many Irish were sent as prisoners<br />
for activities in pursuit-of Irish independence"<br />
He goes on to say that ' it is delightfully appropriate that<br />
it should dc so by assisting the publication of a book that<br />
draws attention to the contribution of those compulsory<br />
Irish Australians, and those who came free, to the building<br />
of the nation that resulted from that foundation".<br />
The willingness of the Irish Government to subsidise this<br />
book is indeed, as President Hillery said in Canberra last<br />
year, recognition of the involvement of Irish men and women<br />
in the develcpment of Australia for nearly two hundred<br />
years. I urcerstand that the Irish Government's<br />
contribution to this project not only allowed Professor<br />
O'Farrell to bring to fruition his life-time's study of the<br />
Irish in Australia, but has also enabled the book to be sold<br />
at a very attractive price.<br />
This book, whose beautiful presentation is a great credit to<br />
the New South Wales University Press and to the Australian<br />
printers, Globe Press, is destined to have an even wider<br />
impact Flowing from it is a documentary mini-series on the Irish in<br />
Australia, being filmed here and in Ireland with the<br />
co-operation of the Irish Government network, which will be<br />
shown on ABC-TV and in Ireland, and I am sure will have as<br />
great an impact on Australians as such series as " Rush". </p>
<p>2<br />
This book is onlyone of the Irish contributions to our<br />
Bicentennial. The Irish Government has established an<br />
energetic Irish Australian Bicentennial Committee to<br />
co-ordinate an exciting program. Aware of the growing<br />
interest by Australians in their heritage, the Irish<br />
Government is microfilming all the convict records some<br />
40,000 in its archives, and will make these available to<br />
Australia as a Bicentennial gift.<br />
PlIans a re a I so u ridu rwa y f or othe r Bi cen Lenn ial1 event s sidch<br />
as visits by theatre and folk groups, exhibitions and<br />
displays of Gaelic football the game which is owed much by<br />
our national football code.<br />
The first Bicentennial Conference focusing on the historical<br />
links binding Australia and Ireland was held in Kilkenny in<br />
1983, a major conference was held at the ANU in August last<br />
year, and another is planned to be held in Ireland next<br />
ye ar<br />
All of this is a reflection of the interest of the five<br />
million Australians with some Irish in them and the<br />
remaining eleven million who want to understand why as<br />
well as of the indefatigable efforts of the Irish Ambassador<br />
to Australia, Joe Small, whose dynamism and encyclopedic<br />
knowledge of all things Irish-Australian has given a great<br />
impetus to the relationqj between our countries and<br />
especially to. Irish participation in our Bicentennial<br />
c ele brat ions<br />
I might mention here that in 1988 we in Australia will have<br />
a chance to reciprocate in a small way some of the warmth<br />
and interest that has been shown in Ireland towards our<br />
200th birthday as a modern nation. Our Bicentennial year is<br />
also being celebrated as the millennium of Dublin and I hope<br />
it will be possible to co-operate with the organisers of<br />
that event to ensure that Australia's acknowledgement to<br />
Ireland is commemorated during the proceedings.<br />
The Irish in Australia documents one of the dominant groups<br />
making Australia the country it is today. Professor<br />
O'Farrell points out that in our first hundred and fifty<br />
years the Irish questioned and challenged attitudes to the<br />
prevailing culture and religion. They sought and achieved a<br />
nation broad and tolerant enough to include them as they<br />
were, tolerant enough to accept those aspects of life they<br />
considered most important.<br />
In achieving this, they too changed. Workers of<br />
Irish-Catholic descent were unlike their counterparts in<br />
Ireland, who were poorly unionised and until recently<br />
without significant political expression. The forces they<br />
largely generated made them strongly unionised and attached<br />
to a significant political party and one cannot fault<br />
their political judgment in the party which they<br />
predominantly chose to support. </p>
<p>3<br />
Professor O'Farrell's book chronicles the emergence of the<br />
Irish from b virtually sub-human status, based on the sort<br />
of prejudices satirised by Swift in his ' Modest Proposal',<br />
to which they were-consigned by the establishment during<br />
Australia's convict days. Judge-Advocate Colonel David<br />
Collins, for example, in 1791 referred to the Irish as " a<br />
race of beings ( for they do not deserve the appellation of<br />
men)" and as being " nearly as wild themselves as the<br />
c a t t I e".<br />
Some beiiijs"! o<br />
Long before the 200-year span of the book is up, the Irish<br />
have asserted themselves, established their equality, placed<br />
themselves firmly in the mainstream of Australian life. And<br />
the measure of their success in becoming central to the life<br />
of Australia, paradoxically, is their relative lack of<br />
involvement in the passions of Irish politics, as Professor<br />
O'Farrell notes in the latter part of his book.<br />
In 1988 we w: ill be celebrating two centuries of work and<br />
achievement. It is a time to reflect on the distinctiveness of our<br />
society; to recognise the contributions of all the groups,<br />
all the individuals, who have lived and worked together to<br />
make this country what it is today. The role of people with<br />
Irish roots in coming to-grips with many of the major issues<br />
which have confronted us over these years will be rightly<br />
recognised as central. I need only mention the long debate<br />
over State a-' d to education, the conscription controversies<br />
of the First World War, the interaction between labour and<br />
capitalism and, developing from this, the foundation and<br />
achievements of the Australian Labor Party. Need I say more<br />
than to note that the two Prime Ministers for whom I have<br />
the greatest regard Curtin and Chifley were both of<br />
Irish descent.<br />
For it was through the struggles of our early years that our<br />
national character was born, and that the promise of this<br />
land was first realised. People from all parts of the world<br />
have been drawn to this country with the promise of a life<br />
of freedom, of opportunity, of a chance to make a<br />
contribution in this just and fair society which the early<br />
Irish Australians, and many others, sought to achieve.<br />
The Irish in Australia is one of the first Bicentennial<br />
histories and one that any Prime Minister would have been<br />
proud to launch. But coming from a Ministry of Bowens,<br />
Keatings, Youngs, Ryans, Kerins and Duffys what choice did I<br />
have? Australians of Irish origin will obviously have a particular<br />
interest in Professor O'Farrell's work but it will also be<br />
welcomed by all Australians seeking to know why we are what<br />
we are. </p>
<p>4.<br />
And, I might add, by all Australians who appreciate superb<br />
prose. I have rarely read anything more moving than the<br />
final paragraph of The Irish in Australia, which surely will<br />
be anthologised in any representative selection of<br />
Australian writing in the last part of this century. I will<br />
content myself with the following excerpt:<br />
" Ireland in Australia was both fact and dream. Its<br />
dimensions of fact coincide with the boundaries of the<br />
contincent, but its dreams were unbounded, spanninqthe<br />
world and more than the world. No man can fix the<br />
' boundaries of the nation of the mind and heart. Least<br />
of all. the soul. Nor call their territories complete".<br />
In writiig about the Irish, Patrick O'Farrell has expressed<br />
a truth vwh~ ch can be applied to all the nationalities who<br />
make up this great country.<br />
It gives ne enormous pleasure to launch this book, which in<br />
both its outstanding intellectual content and technical<br />
craftsmanship is genuinely Made in Australia.<br />
I congratulate Professor O'Farrell, the New South Wales<br />
University Press and the Irish Government on the production<br />
of this elegant and devoted work of scholarship, which will<br />
serve as the definitive account of a vital part of the<br />
development of our nation and a most valuable contribution<br />
to Australia's Bicenten~ ary. </p>
