PRIE MINISTER .6<br />
TEXT OF PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS AT THE OPENING CEREMONY OF<br />
THE REGENCY PARK CENTRE<br />
I was very happy to be able to accept Dr Paterson's-invitation<br />
to attend the opening ceremony of this multi-diagnostic treatment<br />
and training centre.<br />
Both Mrs Fraser and I are delighted to be here to share with the<br />
members of the'. Crippled Children's association of South Australia<br />
their pleasure and pride in their achievement. Because principally,<br />
this centre has been built as the result of the efforts of the<br />
As-sociation.<br />
* Australia is a better country. because people are willing to wor k<br />
with each other through voluntary organizations to assist those who<br />
are in some way disadvantaged.<br />
The quality of provision for special groups in Australia is<br />
greatly dependent on the work of voluntary organizations suc h-as<br />
the Crippled Children's Association. This is as it should be.<br />
Governmdnt. simply cannot arouse the concern or mobilise the<br />
energies of people as effectively as can voluntary organizations.<br />
Any attempt to provide effective assistance for those in need<br />
must rely heavily on the good will and co-operation of the community,<br />
voluntary associations and the Government. This centre is a major<br />
example of that.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has contributed 3.5 million dollars<br />
under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act. The GoVernment<br />
considers such money very well spent when it supplements the<br />
dedicated work so many people have put into this centre.<br />
The Government's policy in the social welfare field places an<br />
emphasis on co-operative effort. we believe that individual, group<br />
and Government participation and consultation is ne3cessary for<br />
the planning and implementation of a co-ordinated and effective<br />
social welfare policy. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
it is through the efforts of iiidividuals and groups in<br />
co-operation with Government, that diversity and choice,<br />
innovation, community participation and a spirit of voluntary<br />
association and self-help enhance growth and development, not<br />
onl~ y with regard to welfare organisations themselves, but in<br />
respect of the persons they assist.<br />
The efforts of highly committ-ad and dedicated people in the<br />
field of voluntary welfare services are able to give even more<br />
of their best where the organisations which they support are<br />
allowed to follow broadly their own paths with the least amount<br />
of Governmental oversighting.<br />
Thp Government has placed an emphasis on the role in society<br />
of the private sector and we are moving away from a trend towards<br />
too much Government direction.<br />
We will continue to encourage the concept of self-help which<br />
has been exemplified in the building of the Regency Park Ceiitre.<br />
We believ3 that welfare programs are most effective where<br />
Government contributions are combined with community self-help.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is prcviding assistance to the Centre<br />
at the rate of about $ 450,000 a year towards the cost of the<br />
salaries of the staff employed there.<br />
It is also quite likely that some of the children who pass<br />
through the Centre may also receive further assistance through<br />
the Commonwealth Government's rehabilitation service and others<br />
through assistance provided in respect of sheltered employment.<br />
The Government is also considering ways of assisting voluntary<br />
organisations not only financially but, for example, by placing<br />
public service resources at their disposal through improving<br />
opportunities for transferability of staff between the Government<br />
and the non-Government sector. </p>
