VISIT TO THE U. S. AND U. K. 1971<br />
WASHINGTON<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AT BLAIR HOUSE<br />
GIVEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN4 PRIIIE MINISTER, W1ILLIAI4 McMAHON<br />
2 NOVEBEP. 1971<br />
( See separate text for questions on Cambodia)<br />
PM Gentlemen, I think I can start of f by saying that yesterday<br />
afternoon I saw the Secretary for Defence and he gave me a rundown<br />
of the present position of the U. S. Forces in South Viet-Namn: And<br />
as far as he could his appreciation of what is likely to happen in<br />
the months to come. He painted a heartening picture of the situation<br />
both in terms of military capability and of their development<br />
programme and the kind of assistance that the United States was prepared<br />
to give. Their military -prograrme is not of course, affected<br />
by the decision of the Senate when it threw out the Civil Aid Bill.<br />
So that they will be able to proviie not only the war equipment<br />
but the other assistance that is needed to sustain a South Vietnamese<br />
Army and the Civil Programme. Regrettably I can't go into the<br />
details of withdrawals or transfers of equipment because the conversation<br />
was off the record and I can only give you a general impression<br />
of the discussions. At the same time the Secretary and Mr<br />
Packard who was with me,. gave me an appreciation of the relevant<br />
strengthe of the United States and of the Soviet. They pointed out<br />
that the United States was sufficiently powerful and that the buildup<br />
of the United States Forces was proceeding ra idly and would,<br />
in their view, provide the kind of deterrent that was needed in the<br />
interests o-f the free world. They also explained the position of<br />
the Soviet Navy in the Indian Oc-ean and of the intention of the U. S.<br />
to maintain forces there as a counter-balancing force to the Navy<br />
of the USSR. In particular e~ ither one of them did Tp oint out to me<br />
the need for countries on the littoral of the Indian Ocean to be<br />
prepared to provide base facilities so that the fullest and most<br />
effective use could be made of the United States Forces for the use<br />
of the ' Naval Base at Cockburn. and the Air Force Base at Learmonth<br />
and the extent to which the British/ United. States signal station<br />
would . be put in the future. That's about the sum total of what was<br />
discussed yesterday in outline. Today I saw the President and<br />
again it was an of f the record conversation. I can assure you of<br />
this one point the discussions were frank, they could not have<br />
been put more frankly and in covt plete detail and I have no reservation<br />
whatsoever in saying -that this is the kind of consultation<br />
we like and I doubt whether it could have been better. FirstMr<br />
Nixon, who was accompanied by : 4. r Kissinger, explained their policy<br />
in relation to China that is the People's Republic of China<br />
and their desire to bring the People's Republic of -China into the<br />
comity of nations and to induce it to ado * pt policies that could<br />
lead to an exnectation and a realisation of Doace. Mr Kissinger<br />
took a very active part and explained in copsiderable detail the<br />
kin4 9f conversations that had taken place in Pegiftg orh botfl odcasions.<br />
* He lso explained the necessity for secrecy. The second<br />
point the President mentioned was the mission ' ha wculd pay to M4oscow<br />
and explained that the fact that he was prepared to visit both<br />
capitals clearly indicatoed that they were not trying to play one<br />
country of f against the other, but were attempting to explain<br />
overall Amo. rican policy and its desire for a deten-te and a reduction<br />
of tensions. And the position in the Mediterranean was explained </p>
<p>2.<br />
in much the same way as it was explained in the discussions with Mr<br />
Laird and the President went over much the same ground as MR Laird<br />
had gone over as to American intentions in South Viet-Nam. Pretty<br />
full details were given to me of what their intentions were,<br />
but for reasons I have given you I am unable to go any further than<br />
I have gone at the moment. One point I can mention to you because I<br />
think that this is of great importance to Australians ,, as that he did<br />
agree with me that the phrase could be used that the United States<br />
Government, from the President down, recognised, or were prepared to<br />
confirm the unqualified and unconditional assurances that had been<br />
given to us in the ANZUS Treaty were as relevant and valid today as<br />
they were at the time the Treaty was negotiated.<br />
We discussed in particular the problems of Japan against the<br />
background of the decision in the United Nations and the proposed<br />
visits to Poking and Moscow and also the difficulties associated with<br />
the realignment of currencies and the import surcharge. Mr Connally<br />
will bo de~ aling , with these matters in Tokyo shortly. But it was<br />
emphasised to me that the difficulties were not associated peculiarly<br />
with the United States and the Japanese alone, but with other countries<br />
and particularly the French. It was a very frank and useful discussion<br />
on the monetary probL , ms.<br />
Other matters were discusscd of our bilateral trading<br />
relationships particularly the export from Australia of meat and the<br />
possibilities due to the dock strike of a carry over of supplies and<br />
matters of a similar kind. All in all I can give you this assurance<br />
that I could not have wished for greater concentration that occurred<br />
on this occasion. I Think I should mention to you too in this context<br />
that suJ-saqan to the second visit of MR Kissinger to Peking the<br />
President did, through the Australian Ambassador, communicate with me<br />
on several occasions. Those communications were, I believe, not only<br />
productive of the greatest goodwill but indicated a desire that we<br />
should understand the American point of view, and why they had taken<br />
the various initiatives they had taken. Later on I saw the Secretary<br />
of State and he too reaffirmed the assurances relating to the ANZUS<br />
Treaty and also went over the ground relating to South Viet-Nam and<br />
American military aid progvammes there. It was a very interesting<br />
discussion and showed, I believe, the very high regard the-U~ iitd<br />
State holds for the Australian people and for the policies of the<br />
Australian Government. To me it has been a most valuable me : ting and<br />
one I think which is of benefit to us because of the concrete and unqualified<br />
assurances that have been given.<br />
Q Prime Minister, on the Indian Oc can a question about the<br />
use of bases in Western Australia. Did the Pkesident ARM yOU if thig<br />
was possible or was it taken as a matter of course<br />
PM It Whs More in the area of Mr Laird that the questions relating<br />
to bases were mentioned. But they would be only too happy to<br />
use the Naval Bases and they will, of course, want some sort of access<br />
in case they need repair facilities. It wad ! AR Laird who was more<br />
interested in this question.<br />
Q You Uave him this assurance that American Forces would be<br />
able to use these Bases.<br />
PM We had, of course, given that already. And they had also<br />
assured us that they would, when necessary, appreciate the opportunity<br />
to use the Bases. </p>
<p>( See separate text for questions on Cambodia)<br />
Q On the broader area, Sir, you raised just on Cambodia,<br />
is there anything said to you which has caused you any surprise in<br />
your discussions with the Americans porhaps or if not surprise<br />
whether or not they may have adopted perhaps a different tone from<br />
what you expected.<br />
PM -It depended which area you local~ ise it to.<br />
Q I thought I would just leave it up to you because obviously<br />
you have a fair idea on this occasion of the thinking of the American<br />
people on most issues. I was just wondering in your discussioms with<br />
Mr Laird and ! Nr Nixon, were you surprised that they placed emphasis<br />
on any particular areas and were there any new answers which you found<br />
unusual given the Playback you have had in Canberra<br />
PM No but this might be wise after the event because so much<br />
was said that I thought was logical and wise but I didn't expect them<br />
to say and didnot think that their thinking had gone as far as it<br />
obviously had gone. To that extCent I was surprised, Yes.<br />
Q Was this on China?<br />
PM Well, on several issues there their thinking was we had<br />
given a lot of thought to it, we did not know how profound their<br />
thought was or how far they had gone and it was on these that the<br />
profoundness and the lengths to which they had gone that were a little<br />
surprising.<br />
Q It jU8V Odu~ od to me that you said it was several issu(: es,<br />
one of them was China if that's any indication. Is that right<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q Sir, there has always been a certain ambiguity about the obligation<br />
of ANZUS for the presence of Australian troops in Singapore<br />
and Malaysia. Could that be clarified in any way<br />
P11 No I didn't Dursue that. Whiat I wanted was an affirmation,<br />
-a strong affirmation that I received from both the President and<br />
Secretary of State of. unqualified support for ANZUS, and the view<br />
was expressed to unqualified support not only from the Administration<br />
and the Congress but from the Amcerican people as well. THey wanted<br />
to display complete goodwill towards Australia and this was just as<br />
important, perhaps more important to me, than the actual words of the<br />
Treaty itself.<br />
Q Why did you demand such a strong affirmation Sir<br />
PM Because I think there is a lot of discussion going on in<br />
Australia today by people and not necessarily well informed, that<br />
ANZUS is starting to re Dcede into the limbo of forgotten things. That<br />
is I didn' t think it was true but naturally enough I want to get the<br />
strongest affirmation I can get in order to refute these suggestions. .4. </p>
<p>Q Sir on this question, if T could just add one further point<br />
on this, the speech that was made by 11, r Bowen in New York. It<br />
caused or was a matter of some controversy in Australia. You yourself<br />
in Parliament defended this speech as being suloported by the Government.<br />
Did you raise the terms of that speech privately with Mr Nixon?<br />
PM No<br />
Q -Well, * put it this way, was it raised in any fashion or did<br />
you raise it that a change in Governmant in Australia would have in-<br />
-volved any change in the existing relationshin between Australia and<br />
America.<br />
PM No<br />
Q Did you discuss with Nixon or did you gat any assurance<br />
from JAR Nixon about trade with the United Sta tes, any suggestion<br />
that wool might get special treatment in import surcharges or tariffs?<br />
PM You're in an area flow that I am not able to discuss in any<br />
detail. I did talke about our trade relations with him and mentioned<br />
meat and wool.<br />
Q Could I I would like to ask just one more thing Sir. Did<br />
you ask M~ r Nixcr_. to come to Australia?<br />
PM I informed him that he would be a welcome guest but at the<br />
same time I indicated that I would un~ derstand it if he found it<br />
difficult to come in an election year. He laughed when I said it<br />
and said well thank Heavens that you recognise the difficul. ties, it<br />
would be ex4-remely difficult.<br />
Q Speaking a-bout requesting an assurance of their support for<br />
ANZUS, Mr Prime Minister, did you explain ' this feeling in Australia,<br />
that it was receding into a limbo of forgotten things and who held<br />
that view<br />
PM Could I make a correction. I did say that there was a feeling,<br />
some feeling, but not necessarily one that was widespread that ANZUS<br />
-was receding into the linbo of forgotten things. I did not ask for a<br />
positive assurance relating to it, it was given then without any<br />
-further prompting. But by this time, his feelings towards Australia,<br />
and towards the Australian people, and the high regard that he had<br />
for us as not only friendly, but willing allies and one who could be<br />
relied upon and trusted and relied upon, had become obvious.<br />
Q Today, Sir, Mir Rogers had a press conference, the one that<br />
the press sat in on and during the course of which he remarked that<br />
the President was concernod for the Foreign Aid cut, that the decision<br />
of the Senate would affect the foreign policy posture of the<br />
United States and the rest of the world. Did the President expatiate<br />
on this with you because M~ r Rogers referred specifically to Viet-Nam<br />
while he was in the context talking about obligations created in Asia<br />
and that this posed a threat in fact to the Nixon doctrine, in fact<br />
he used that expression, to refer to that part of the world if I may<br />
settle this for you ( INAUDIBLE). He also said in the public / 5 </p>
<p>statemnnt that there could be a collapse of the South VietntmeeeJ<br />
economy arising from this fact and there does seem to me to be a<br />
conflict in what he said earlier about it being able to carry on<br />
and that they also will be reconciled... ( INAUDIBLE).<br />
PM First of all turning to what Mr Walsh said, this question<br />
of aid, of civil aid programmes was only touched on perfunctorily<br />
by the President and he did express the view that there would be a<br />
reinstatement or partial reinst'. tement of the aid programmes. He<br />
did not go any further.<br />
Secretary of State Rogers dealt with it in greater detail<br />
but felt that not too much. should be said about it. He was very<br />
sorry for the vote but particularly the large numx. er of absentees<br />
and the fact that it was taken at the time when Mayoral and other<br />
elections were taking place but there is not much more I can add<br />
to what you already know. He also is hopeful that the Congress<br />
will take action to make additional appropriations but he did not<br />
want to be too forthcoming about it. As to what you said, MR Reid.<br />
about there seems tg be an inconsistency, it has to be looked at in<br />
two ways. So far/ me bulk of assistance to South Viet-Nam is<br />
concerned it is under the military funding programme and that won't<br />
be affected. As to the balance, it will be civil aid and I don't<br />
know to what extent civil aid is involved.<br />
Q What is your view?<br />
What do you think of it MR Prime Minister<br />
PM Which<br />
Q Not the Foreign Aid cut, the decision by Senate<br />
PM When I'm in another country I don't like to make any critical<br />
statements relating to what that country has done. It is its<br />
business and I don't like interfering in its own domestic affairs<br />
other than to say this. I thought i t was regrettable, I thought<br />
a mistake was made but I have a feeling that to a large extent the<br />
vote will be, in one way or another, will be reinstated by Congress.<br />
I can go no further than that.<br />
Q Don't you beltve Prime ilinister, that it does affect us<br />
simply because the withdrawal of aid from the Asia Pacific region,<br />
would certainly cause us to rethink changes in Foreign Policy.<br />
-PM I don't th-ink it will be any change to us. We will go<br />
ahead with our aid programmes<br />
Until I know exactly what the United States Government<br />
or Congress intends to do on Foreign Aid, I refrain from<br />
any comment other than what I have already made.<br />
Q Is there any suggestion, Mr Prime Minister, that Australia<br />
may be called upon to put forward more aid to South Viet-Nam<br />
PM Tere might be but I doubt whether it would be practicable.<br />
Q In what circumstances might these be now requested<br />
PM I don't know Ivan. That is hypothetical and I'm not getting<br />
involved into a world of hypothesis. </p>
<p>Q Sir, M! r Kissinger was in China for the first time at the time<br />
of the Labour Party delegation. Did he talk about that at all and the<br />
effects..., of the visit.<br />
PM No, he didn't, he merely explained the kind of conversation<br />
they had, what it was about and the significance of it and its short<br />
and long term significance.<br />
Q Did you get the feeling Sir that the United States was moving<br />
-quicker towards diplomatU,. recognition of the PRC than we ourselves<br />
are.<br />
P11 No.<br />
Q Did Mir Kissingczr sit in throughout the entire interview Sir<br />
PM Yes, And par-ticipatei to a considerable extent.<br />
Q Did they discuss the United Nations vote and the implications<br />
that it has for the United States relations with not so much China<br />
but the rest of the world<br />
PM They did not do so but Secret.-ary of State Roqers did.<br />
Q And what did VMr Rogers say I have seen his public statement<br />
on the matter. They referred~ more to what they call the atmosphere<br />
in which it was taken than to the actual vote itself.<br />
PM I can't go any further than I have gone because as I said I<br />
am limited to what I can say to what I have already given you. If<br />
there is anything more I think got to go from the Secretary of<br />
State Rogers and not through me.<br />
Q Mir Prime Minister you made the point that... you specifically<br />
made the point of saying that prior to MR Kissinger's visit to Peking<br />
( I am sorry) prior to the announcement of Mr Kissinger's visit to<br />
Peking and the announcement of the pending visit of Nixon that the<br />
White House did communicate withyou on several occasions. Are you<br />
saying Sir that they told you beforehand<br />
PM THis is the second visit<br />
O No, the first visit.<br />
PM I didn't say so, I am., sorry, I was referring to the second.<br />
0-Sir, on this currency thing arising from the conversations<br />
today, were you able to fix mentally upon a timetable yourself, final<br />
decisions on currency<br />
PM No, I can't and they can't either.<br />
Q Did the President seem concerned about the way in which Mr<br />
Sato's position, in jeopardy in politicq would be affected by the decisions<br />
taken in both the economic and political level in America<br />
at the moment. This is the subject of considerable speculation<br />
throug'hout the world. I think I've heard you express some concern<br />
about this yourself. </p>
<p>PM I can but repeat what I said before. that the President and<br />
the Secretary of State did refer to the importance of Japan in the<br />
world, scene and not only because of its industrial and political<br />
position but because of the problems that were faced on currency realignments<br />
and trade as well. I can't go any further than that.<br />
Q How about yourself Did you raise the question of MR Sato's<br />
position as distinct from that of Japan as a whole<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q Could you tell us what your feelings were on this?-<br />
PMq No I'm sorry.<br />
T-M!' r Prime Minister, obviously attitudes to defence in our<br />
region was obviously quite a big part in your talk with the President<br />
today. Could . you tell us something about that<br />
Py, It was a big part of our talks. And it was emphasised that<br />
the United States had no intention whatsoever of withdrawing from the<br />
Asian region. Wh~ at it was doing was matching its commitment to its<br />
capabilities and above all they pointed out that the haNZUS Treaty was<br />
for them part of the supreme law of the land and they gave clear and<br />
unqualified assurances that the ANZUS Treaty was just as valid today<br />
in the minds of the Administration, the Congress and the people of<br />
the United States as it was when the Treat' was first signed. That's<br />
the answer.<br />
Q Mir Prime Minister. one of the significant discussions you had<br />
with the President today related to the American Naval buildup as<br />
planned in the Indian Ocean. Iow significant is this and what part<br />
will Australia play<br />
PZ1 I think you have gone a little bit too far in saying the<br />
significant American Naval buildup in the Indian Oce: an. WKhat they<br />
intend to do is to have some kind of parity with the Soviet Union's<br />
Naval Forces that are now or might go into the Indian Ocean and I do<br />
hope that they will be able tc have access to Australian base facilities<br />
when their Navy, or elcments of their fleet, are there.<br />
0 Does that mean an expansion of the facilities there are planned?<br />
PH No, not so far as I know. That was not discussed.<br />
Q MR Prime iinister, what do you believeyou and Australia have<br />
gained by today's talks with MR Nixon<br />
PM They were very frank and honest discussions and they did show<br />
the wish of the United States Government to have consultations with<br />
the Australian Government on matters of mutual interest and importance<br />
to both of us. That was the first important effect. The second one<br />
without any doubt was the interest it has created in Australia abouzt<br />
the viability and the permanence of the ANZUS Treaty. There is a<br />
tendency back home for some Australians to say well it doesn't matter<br />
very much and it is dying from lack of use and people do not care<br />
about it very much more neither do the people in the United States.<br />
Those two statements are wrong. It is a cruciall. y important Treaty<br />
from our point of view. Secondly, so far as the Americans are concerned<br />
that is the United States, from the Government, Congress and the people<br />
of the United States, there is no doubt about it that they regard the<br />
assurances given in that Treaty as of crucial importance to them and<br />
assurances that they will respect. In their minds the terms of the<br />
Treaty will be maintained by the United States Congress and Government. </p>
<p>8.<br />
one other short question. Did you disagree with anything which<br />
Mr Nixon had to say<br />
PMI Not so far as I can raedmer. I would have to go over everything<br />
that was said in m~ uch greater detail before I could give a complete<br />
answer. But most of what he said and fEor that matter what Mr<br />
Kissinger and Mr Laird, not Mr Laird, and to a greater extent what was<br />
said by Secretary of State Rogers coincided with what we in Australia<br />
are thinking. I would like particularly to compliment the President<br />
for the frankness with which he expressed his vi'* ews and the detail<br />
with1 which he went into the various problems that arose and the informat~<br />
lon conveyed to us.<br />
And I think too if I can say this his liking for Australia<br />
is very great and for that reason I did express the hope that he might<br />
be able to come to Australia next year although I doubt whether it will<br />
be practicable. </p>
