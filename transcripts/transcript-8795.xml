STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
On Australia Day it is right that we should remember all that<br />
was done by earlier generations to build this country. But<br />
-today I think it is appropriate to also remind ourselves that<br />
this generation of Australians has done as much as any other to<br />
preserve our way of life and make it safe in the years to come.<br />
In the past decade we Australians have risen to meet the<br />
challenges posed by a dramatically changing world, and by our<br />
efforts we have given ourselves security and opportunities we<br />
would not otherwise now have. In doing this we have learned that<br />
we have the capacity to adapt. We have learned that we can<br />
compete with the best.<br />
In the 1990s the chance is there for Australia: we can build for<br />
ourselves a more rewarding and dynamic place in the world, and<br />
particularly in our region, than we have ever had before. In<br />
our great natural _ wealt4, in our collective-skills-, and<br />
knowledge, in our will and strength of purpose, we have all we<br />
need to secure the future.<br />
The challenges remain. With some of our m~ r traigprns<br />
in recession or moving only slowly out of it, the hardship here<br />
will not quickly go away. This is a reality which must be<br />
squarely faced. Equally, we should acknowledge that we are<br />
doing better than most comparable countries, and that there is<br />
good reason to be confident.<br />
In 1993 we will redouble our efforts to accelerate economic<br />
recovery, reduce unemployment and alleviate the stress which<br />
change has brought to Australians in their homes and workplaces.<br />
The great task for we Australians is to continue to confront<br />
necessity and make the changes, while doing all we can to reduce<br />
and share the burden.<br />
Our success depends on our material and human resources, our<br />
natural wealth and our energy and ideas. It also depends on our<br />
faith in Australia and in each other, by how well we care for<br />
each other.<br />
It will be good for us to be guided by these things in 1993,<br />
just as they have guided Australians through other challenging<br />
times. I take this opportunity to wish all Australians a successful,<br />
safe and happy year.<br />
