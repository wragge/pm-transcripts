TEXT OF ADDRESS GIVEN BY SENATOR CARRICK ON BEHALF OF TH<br />
PRIME MINISTER. AT THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION SEMINAR<br />
I am pleased to be able to open the fourth National Local<br />
Government Seminar.<br />
As you will know, the Government is committed to the most<br />
far-reaching reform of inter-governmental relations since<br />
Federation. The theme of this Seminar " Local Government the changing<br />
scene" therefore seems most appropriate, and I welcome the<br />
opportunity to discuss with you the implications of the Federalism.<br />
policy for Local Government.<br />
The Government's Federalism Policy will result in a new scene<br />
for Local Government.<br />
It will ensure that the voices of individuals and community<br />
groups. are heard, and that meaningful participation in the<br />
democratic process is enhanced.<br />
Local Government has existed in Australia as long as most of<br />
the States. The first steps in the establishment of Local<br />
Government in Australia were taken in the late 1830' s.<br />
The enthusiasm for Local Government in these early years is<br />
shown by this statement from a document of the period:<br />
" Local Government and democracy are essentially intertwined, and<br />
it is difficult to see how the one can survive without the<br />
States, where national democracies are not<br />
supported by the practice of Local Self-Government, will not<br />
develop that wide and solid political capacity in their citizens<br />
which is the chief bulwark against autocracy."<br />
This viewpoint expresses the rationale behind our moves to give<br />
Local Government more control over their own decision-making<br />
and finances.<br />
while the previous Labor Government followed a centralist<br />
philosophy, our Government is committed to a policy where<br />
Government decisions are made as close as possible to the people<br />
they affect.<br />
The previous Government believed that the national Government<br />
must be directly involved in local affairs, even to the extent<br />
of usurping many local government responsibilities. They believed<br />
that all wisdom and experience resided in Canberra. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
They introduced legislation to express this philosophy.<br />
The Commonwealth Grants Commission Act of 1933 was. rplce<br />
by the Grants Commission Act of 1973.<br />
To implement this legislation, States were divided into<br />
artificial regions formed by groupings of local authorities.<br />
Applications for assistance were only considered from local<br />
governing organisations approved by the Minister for Urban<br />
arid Regional Development.<br />
The regional organisazion was a forced extension of local<br />
government. Rather than giving proper life to local government, regional<br />
organisatiens formed a fourth level of Government. Regional<br />
organisations did not include all local government. Those that<br />
objected to losing their individual identity and refused to<br />
be grouped into a region, missed out in the financial lottery.<br />
The grants given on the recommendation of the Grants Commission,<br />
were for topping-up purposes and were given to reduce inequalities.<br />
By virtue of the very nature of the grant, however, not every<br />
council received money. Some councils had to be used as the<br />
measuring stick against which the others were to be compared.<br />
The regional approach generally failed to take into account the<br />
fact that each council faced different problems.<br />
The kinds of local authorities that wore grouped into each region<br />
were generally quite different with respect to the particular<br />
problems that they faced as local authorities.<br />
Our approach in these matters is quite different.<br />
The present Commonwealth Government is the first since Federation<br />
to be unequivocally committed to an accurate assessment of the<br />
needs and responsibilities of all levels of Government.<br />
The Government's Federalism Policy will contribute to a new<br />
structure of Federal-State-Local Government relations.<br />
Local Government is of growing significance in the local<br />
community. It has " grass-roots' contacts. It must have the<br />
a bility to Lcespond to the massive difficulties which inflation,<br />
limited revenues, and expanding demands are imposing on it.<br />
Today Local Government covers every aspect of the life of the<br />
individual and family, and affects economic growth and the<br />
quality of life for the community.<br />
Local Government has the potential to improve the quality of<br />
life and services provided for local communities.<br />
Our Federalism Policy will make major reforms in the finances<br />
and functions of local government. It will make for a new<br />
partnership between the Federal and State and Local Government<br />
spheres.<br />
Local Government shall no longer be a poor relation. / 13 </p>
<p>At the basis of the new Federalism Policy is the principle<br />
of tax sharing.<br />
The Government proposes to earmark a fixed percentage of<br />
personal income tax for distribution through the states to<br />
Local Government.<br />
Taxpayers will know what this percentage will be.<br />
The money is intended for two distinct purposes.<br />
PArt of each State's total grant will be for distribution<br />
between all authorities in the state. It will be essentially<br />
on a per capita basis,. but there could be a weightinig involved<br />
related to area).<br />
The second component will be an equalisation or " topping-up"<br />
grant to take account of any special needs of particular<br />
authorities.<br />
Funds to be distributed on the equalisation or needs basis<br />
will be allocated by State Grants Commissions.<br />
We will not dictate to the States the precise machinery or<br />
manner by which they will handle the distribution of these<br />
funds.<br />
We will make available to the States the qualitative material<br />
on Local Government finance which the Commonwealth Grants<br />
Commission has assembled in the course of its enquiries, in<br />
order to assist them.<br />
The April Premiers' Conference made a firm decision that Local<br />
Government would participate in the new tax sharing arrangements<br />
as from 1976/ 77.<br />
FYurther, it was agreed to establish State Grants Commissions<br />
in those States which do not already have such a Commission.<br />
In line with this policy the Commonwealth Grants Commission<br />
has been asked to advise on certain aspects of Local Government<br />
finance.<br />
The Commission will not report on amounts of assistance for<br />
individual authorities.<br />
It will advise the Commonwealth Government on the appropriate<br />
d~ istribution of funds between States of assistance to be<br />
provided to Local Government in 1976/ 77.<br />
A working party of officials from the States and the Commonwealth<br />
has been set up to work out what matters should be taken into<br />
account in allocating funds within the States.<br />
On Thursday the Treasurer will be giving an indication of the<br />
assistance which Local Government might expect to receive under<br />
the new arrangements in 1976/ 77 </p>
<p>Decisions on the detailed allocation of Local Government Grants<br />
will no longer be made in Canberra, but by each State in<br />
close consultation with Local Government itself.<br />
We wish to see existing Local Government facilities and<br />
capabilities utlised in place of the present proliferation<br />
and overlapping of authorities and functions.<br />
The reforms we are proposing to the federal system will establish<br />
the framework for a far more efficient approach to problems<br />
affecting State and local communities.<br />
The great issues of concern; social welfare, education, h ealth,<br />
housing, urban development, can only be handled adequately<br />
through a Governmental framework in which each sphere of<br />
Government considers the problems appropriate to it.<br />
Efficiency and effectiveness are both harmed if . the central<br />
Government presumes to decide questions on which awareness,<br />
information and expert-ise are lorated at-local.<br />
and state levels.<br />
Such unjustified presumption on the part of the Federal<br />
Government can only lead to poorly conceived programmes<br />
and to harmful conflict between the different spheres of<br />
Government. I<br />
If we are to achieve the best consideration of the problems<br />
which concern us all, we must * rest * cture our forms and<br />
institutions of Government and our attitudes to achieve<br />
partnership and co-operation, rather than domination by a<br />
few people in Canberra.<br />
The goal of improving relations between the spheres of Government<br />
will be further advanced by the establishment of the Advisory<br />
Council for Inter-Government Relations.<br />
Local Government will be looked to for an important contribution<br />
to the work of the Council.<br />
The Council is seen by the Government as a vital institution of<br />
co-operation within the various forms of Government.<br />
It will be an independent body of major status with wide ranging<br />
advisory and investigatory powers.<br />
The Advisory Council for Inter-Governmental Relations will examine<br />
i 4n depth , tht:: problems which emerge between the various branches<br />
of. Government and will consider the definition and rationalisation<br />
of functions.<br />
Local Government will be repre ' sented and will through their<br />
Premiers be able to have matters discussed at the Premiers'<br />
Conference for reference to the Council for examination and<br />
report. Progress towards the establishment of the Council is advancing<br />
satisfactorily. </p>
<p>.1<br />
At the April Premiers' Conference the charter for the Council<br />
was agreed upon.<br />
All Premier's have already been asked to submit nominations<br />
for citizen members of the Council.<br />
The Commonwealth Government will introduce the appropriate<br />
legislation to establish the Council during the current<br />
parliamentary session.<br />
As the Council develops I believe its influence will do much to<br />
enhance the status of Local Government.<br />
Thc Council will provide an effective vehicle to encourage<br />
public debate on the practical resolution of local problems.<br />
As a consequence of the Government's Federalism Policy I see<br />
Local Government being assured of its continuing role.<br />
We will not attempt to force on local authorities artificial<br />
regions or changes of boundaries.<br />
Local Government must be given the opportunity and assured<br />
resources to do its job, free from the constrictions forced<br />
upon it by the previous government.<br />
The Commonwealth's proposals for a new system of financial<br />
assistance for Local Government were welcomed by the Premiers<br />
and warmly supported by the Australian Council of Local<br />
Government Associations.<br />
One of the important areas where Local Government can and<br />
does play a role is in the delivery of welfare services.<br />
This is a role which merits further exploration.<br />
Welfare services provided at the local level are responsive to<br />
the users' needs and wishes.<br />
Local Government has the capacity to mesh together voluntary<br />
and statutory welfare services and link them to other Local<br />
Government planning funciton.<br />
This is in many ways a natural Local Government function,<br />
because of the proximity of Local Government to the people and<br />
its unequalled knowledge of local conditions and problems.<br />
Local Government should be fully aware of its special position<br />
and the considerable potential it has for enhancing citizen<br />
participation in decision-making.<br />
The Government's proposals on Local Government follow what I<br />
see as one of the main objectives of Government: the creation<br />
of a society and an environment in which individuals may best<br />
fulfil themselves. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
If this is to be achieved individuals must be free to<br />
participate fully in Government and the forms of Government<br />
must be decentralised to permit maximum response and effective<br />
involvement.<br />
Clea"-ly the scene for Local Government in Australi. a is changing.<br />
The Labor Government tried to take Australia rapidly down the<br />
road to a centralist, tightly regulated bureaucratic state,<br />
built on ever-rising taxes and a growing dominaiice of Government<br />
over people.<br />
The task of the present Government is to effectively demonstrate<br />
that there is a realistic alternative.<br />
We believe our Federalism policy will re-establish the integrity<br />
of the federal structure.<br />
Our proposals are designed to bring a greater degree of<br />
responsibility and autonomy to both State and Local Government<br />
where decisions that affect people in their own areas can be<br />
made by the people who know most about them and live close to<br />
them. Local Government now has a chance to assert itself, to display<br />
its capabilities and its readiness to adjust and progress.<br />
Much will depend on Local Government in helping Australia<br />
meet the challenges that the 1980' s and beyond will brinq.<br />
I have much pleasure in declaring this Conference open. </p>
