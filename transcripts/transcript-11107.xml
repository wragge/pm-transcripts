<p>[tape starts]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....as rude as you like.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Well all right I will. Now I thought [inaudible] Prime Minister was</p>
<p> bloody awful.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not surprised. I would expect a lot of people wouldn't</p>
<p> like it. These things are intensely subjective. Just as fashion in</p>
<p> all sorts of [tape break] varies from person to person and group to</p>
<p> group. I don't think it would matter who the Prime Minister were</p>
<p> or who he got to assist, there'd be some people who would think</p>
<p> it was great, some people think it was ordinary, and some people would</p>
<p> think what you thought of it.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>I take your point. I mean you could have had Shakespeare on one hand</p>
<p> and Henry Lawson on the other.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because you're talking here about how you express commonly held</p>
<p> feelings. You see the argument now is really going to be about not</p>
<p> what subjects were covered but how they were covered. The language</p>
<p> that was used to cover them. Now you said you didn't object to</p>
<p> a reference to God [inaudible], the Aborigines, democracy, all of</p>
<p> those. We all agree on those things. It's really about the language</p>
<p> which that's employed and look, I don't expect everybody's</p>
<p> going to like this.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Let me throw the criticism that came from a lot of listeners. They</p>
<p> said, and many of them used, or several used a phrase that they thought</p>
<p> your heart was in the right place, that they couldn't fault you</p>
<p> for that, but the language didn't uplift it. Didn't soar,</p>
<p> didn't take us above ourselves.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can understand some people saying that. On the other hand when</p>
<p> I presented it to our Party Room it got a round of applause. Now that's</p>
<p> not because they were trying to be super polite to me. A lot of things</p>
<p> I think deserve a round of applause in our Party Room doesn't</p>
<p> get a round of applause. And one of the things we tried to do with</p>
<p> this was not use traditional preamble language. We didn't try</p>
<p> and load it up with where as's and humbly relyings on because</p>
<p> that is not contemporary language.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>That's 19th Century, 18th Century.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now, that was fine then and I'm not knocking it but the language</p>
<p> of people then is not the language of people today and I had rather</p>
<p> hoped that we could use language that people who, you know, are living</p>
<p> in [inaudible] 20th Century.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But you still can't get away with qualms. I mean the phrase like</p>
<p> "immigrants have brought great enrichment to our nation".</p>
<p> What's wrong with just saying: have enriched our nation's</p>
<p> life?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you can, I mean okay, we can spend the whole afternoon [inaudible].</p>
<p> And look.....</p>
<p>[Line drop out]</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Can I get to some of the particular criticism and it's not necessarily</p>
<p> criticism I agree with by any means. But there is concern about mateship'.</p>
<p> That that might be too blokey. That it rather leaves out 52% of the</p>
<p> population, i.e. women.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I understand that. I don't agree with it. Mateship'</p>
<p> has become a hallowed word in the Australian experience. It's</p>
<p> the only word in that preamble that you would never conceivably find</p>
<p> in the preamble of another nation. Now doesn't that mean that</p>
<p> it's distinctively Australian? And if you look at the contemporary</p>
<p> use of the word mateship' it's been broadened to be</p>
<p> something beyond the male bonding and things to do with blokes being</p>
<p> together. It describes community spirit. It describes an attitude</p>
<p> of us all clubing together to help each other when we're under</p>
<p> the hammer. Now I thought about this. I know some of the, you know,</p>
<p> more rad fems will have a go at me over it. But I couldn't be</p>
<p> sort of even with myself, I wouldn't feel easy with myself if</p>
<p> I hadn't have put it in because I really believe that that ideal</p>
<p> is a very important part of the Australian psyche.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>So you said to Les Murray: Les, we've got to have mateship'.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can blame me for mateship'. Don't blame Les. Les</p>
<p> was not keen on it and we talked about it and he said well you know,</p>
<p> you're the client, I'm only the poet and in the end you</p>
<p> try and get a mix of our ideas, his language and in some areas my</p>
<p> language.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>How much was him and how much was you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A bit, but I mean a lot of it, I think more ringing phrases were his.</p>
<p> But perhaps I'm being modest. But I think the last paragraph's</p>
<p> very very nice. A lot of people will disagree with it but I think</p>
<p> it's a beautiful statement.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And that was yours? "Australia's democratic and federal</p>
<p> system of government..."</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No that was very much Murray.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Right. Okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I think it's a beautiful paragraph and I think it says it</p>
<p> speaks very...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>"Australia's democratic and federal system of government</p>
<p> exists under law to preserve and protect all Australians in an equal</p>
<p> dignity which may never be infringed by prejudice or fashion or ideology</p>
<p> nor invoked against achievement." Yeah.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think that what it is saying is we're all equal, we shouldn't</p>
<p> be over borne by prejudice. Of course we shouldn't, we're</p>
<p> a tolerant nation, "or ideology or fashion". Now that's</p>
<p> a reference to people being over borne by passing political correctness.</p>
<p> The last bit of course is a blow against the tall poppy syndrome and</p>
<p> if there's one thing we need to get rid of in this country is</p>
<p> our tall poppy syndrome. We have to be a nation that believes in achievers</p>
<p> as well as being a nation that believes in battlers. What I've</p>
<p> tried to do in this preamble is express both ideals.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister the other concern expressed by a lot of people is that</p>
<p> there is not sufficient acknowledgement of the Aboriginal and Torres</p>
<p> Strait Island peoples, and what has been called the custodianship</p>
<p> of the land.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I thought once we all thought very hard to get that. And look,</p>
<p> I know some....I knew people were going to say that. On the other</p>
<p> hand if you look as though you're going too far in that direction</p>
<p> you'll start losing people on the other side. I thought what</p>
<p> we did was to say that from the beginning of time and the hallowed</p>
<p> expression there is from "time immemorial" our country's</p>
<p> been inhabited by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and we honour</p>
<p> their ancient and continuing cultures. I think that is both historically</p>
<p> correct, it is respectful, it's a tasteful reference. It avoids</p>
<p> the difficulties of, in the cause of getting one group in the community</p>
<p> on side you alienate others. In the end Mike you can't sort of</p>
<p> bargain something like this. You've really got to try and strike</p>
<p> a balance because you will never satisfy everybody. I mean some people</p>
<p> have....who have said to me: why are you talking about the Aborigines</p>
<p> at all? Why don't you just talk about Australians and nobody</p>
<p> else. Some people said: if you're going to talk about immigrants</p>
<p> why don't you talk about the people who were born in Australia.</p>
<p> I mean it's a mission impossible to satisfy everybody.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All of the people all of the time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly. Nobody has ever tried to write something like this in 100</p>
<p> years so I suppose I'm attempting the impossible. But I thought</p>
<p> it would be a great thing to try and find a set of words that said</p>
<p> something about what we all believe unites us, and to cover all of</p>
<p> the things that we have in common. Now.....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. So what happens now. Does everyone get a chance to have</p>
<p> a crack at it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The people will have their say. I'll listen to all the comments</p>
<p> and if I think that there are proposals that are worthy of incorporation</p>
<p> well we'll do that. If I don't we won't. And we will</p>
<p> put the final version if it is altered at all, or if it's not</p>
<p> altered we'll put that inside a bill and put it up and we'll</p>
<p> just see what the Labor Party and the Democrats do. I didn't</p>
<p> think for a moment that they would agree first up with what we put</p>
<p> forward. And you can't have a committee writing something like</p>
<p> this.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You end up with a camel.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It just goes on and on and on. But we'll hear what they've</p>
<p> got to say. I don't think it can be seriously argued that we've</p>
<p> left out things that ought to be put in. It's going to be an</p>
<p> argument about language and style. And everybody has a different way</p>
<p> of saying these things.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Well yeah. I think a lot of people wanted a sort of the Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p> uplift if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah but people who say that would, I mean, a lot of them, with respect,</p>
<p> they couldn't recite any of the words of Thomas Jefferson and</p>
<p> they were good for that century. We're not living in that century.</p>
<p> I mean some of the greatest speeches now if you read them again, they</p>
<p> sound excessively flowery and some what out of place. It's a</p>
<p> different world. I mean even some of the speeches of Menzies now which</p>
<p> were are only 30 or 40 years old probably employ language which is</p>
<p> not necessarily appropriate now and I say that as one of the greatest</p>
<p> admirers of that man around. But I'll let the, you know.....</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Let a thousand flowers bloom.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Let the comments flow. I'm not the least bit offended by that.</p>
<p> I didn't expect everybody to sort of cheer from the sidelines</p>
<p> and say it was absolutely outstanding. But it's an attempt to</p>
<p> sort of cover in contemporary language thoughts and sentiments that</p>
<p> we all have in common. I mean it's early days yet but I haven't</p>
<p> heard too many, apart from the mateship thing which I think is perhaps</p>
<p> a bit of an over reaction from some and when you think about it it</p>
<p> really is part of the Australian psyche. Now apart from that there's</p>
<p> not a lot of controversy about the concepts covered, it's just</p>
<p> the way you express it. I don't think you'll ever get agreement</p>
<p> on that and Mr Keating would have written something differently from</p>
<p> me.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>I think he might have.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah and he would have got a different adviser. He wouldn't have</p>
<p> got Les Murray.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>He might have gone to the Commonwealth Bank.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now, now.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Hey listen can I bowl you a question on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you can. You just have.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. Are you attracted to, do you want an inquiry into the whole</p>
<p> business of the piggery, the Commonwealth Bank?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>[inaudible]. Can I say honestly I have no personal political axe to</p>
<p> grind on this at all. I had my political shoot out with Mr Keating</p>
<p> in March of 1996.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Is there a need for an inquiry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're getting advice on that. We are. We are getting advice</p>
<p> on that. I mean if there is a public interest in having an inquiry</p>
<p> that's something a government ought to take into account.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>And do you feel there may be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're waiting...we are seeking advice. It's deliberately</p>
<p> being handled at an Attorney-General's level so that as far as</p>
<p> possible the decision making process is kept as transparent as possible.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Are you concerned about the involvement of the Commonwealth Bank in</p>
<p> what appears to have been some quite secret deals done here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it's fair of me to sort of say yes or no to</p>
<p> that because I haven't read all of the material. I saw the programme.</p>
<p> I haven't read the supporting documents. I haven't looked</p>
<p> at any detail the Commonwealth Bank's comments.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Mr Keating's saying it's part of a Liberal Party plot to</p>
<p> get him.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I understand him saying that and there's no point in my</p>
<p> getting involved in responding to that. I mean let me simply repeat,</p>
<p> in political terms I don't have any personal axe to grind. We</p>
<p> had our stand off in 1996. He lost the election. He has disappeared</p>
<p> from public life. I have no personal desire to pursue him. But if</p>
<p> matters are raised and there is a public interest involved well that</p>
<p> does have to be looked at and I'm quite certain that if the boot</p>
<p> were on the other foot the Labor Prime Minister would be saying the</p>
<p> same thing.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>All right. Prime Minister thanks very much.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A pleasure.</p>
