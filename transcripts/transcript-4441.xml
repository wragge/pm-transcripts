G. C. V. O. K. St. J. Q. C. as<br />

Canberra </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 14 JULY 1977<br />
RESIGNATION OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
The announcement of Her Majesty's acceptance of Sir John Kerr's<br />
resignation as Governor-General of Australia is occasion for<br />
me to record publicly, with respect and appreciation Australia's<br />
debt to Sir John for his service in high office, inciuding<br />
through a difficult period in Australia's constitutionall istory.<br />
Sir John will relinquish his appointment in December after<br />
more than hree years as Governor-General and after service<br />
under two Governments. In that period he has travelled<br />
widely in Australia and, with Lady Kerr, has associated his<br />
office with community groups and state and national associations<br />
across the whole spectrum of Australian life. It is also<br />
appropriate for me to place on record Sir John's work as first<br />
Chancellor of the Order of Australia.<br />
Sir John steps down because he himself has asked leave to do so.<br />
He feels that the events of 1975 and the association of his<br />
office with issues of state which arose at that time evoked<br />
partisan feelings in the Australian community which have now<br />
substantially subsided but which nevertheless left feelings<br />
which might be resolved more quickly if he now makes way for<br />
a successor. He believes too that he ha s completed an important<br />
phase in his own life.<br />
Focus. on controversial issues at times has tended to obscure<br />
the measure of support that Sir John has always had, and the<br />
office of Governor-General has always had, from the large<br />
majority of the Australian community. It is to the great<br />
credit of both Sir John and Lad y Kerr that extreme elements<br />
in the community were faced up to and overcome an~ d both can<br />
look back on this with a sense of satisfaction and achievement.<br />
Sir John's leadership was a service to his office, to the<br />
Monarchy, and to the country.<br />
No Governor-General could have relished the position that<br />
Sir John found himself in in 1975 but it must be accepted<br />
that in the constitutional circumstances then existing Sir John<br />
acted in the only way that the high duties of his office<br />
allowed him to act. ,1jjAL8WL1( A </p>
<p>2.<br />
Sir John's request now to relinquish his appointment and.<br />
the reasons that have led him to this decision accord with<br />
the high sense of public responsibility and statesmanship<br />
that he has always demonstrated. He maintained a dignity<br />
and purpose in his appointment and history will come<br />
increasingly to recognise the debt that Australia owes to<br />
his resoluteness in public office.<br />
In his term as Governor-General Sir John has had the respect<br />
of people from all walks of Australian life and he has with<br />
the support of Lady Kerr undertaken his duties at all times<br />
with the highest responsibility.<br />
Australia and Australians are grateful to Sir John and we<br />
extend best wishes to him and to Lady Kerr.<br />
