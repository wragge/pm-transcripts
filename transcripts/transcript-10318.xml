29 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD AND HIS EXCELLENCY<br />
MR RYUTARO HASHIMOTO<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA<br />
E O E<br />
HOWARD: The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto and myself have over the last few<br />
hours conducted very warm and friendly and useful discussions and they will continue<br />
informally over lunch. Could I say on a personal note how delighted I am to have Mr<br />
Hashimoto and his wife as guests here in Australia. The very deep association between<br />
Australia and Japan has been reinforced by the ease of the personal and professional<br />
relationship that I have developed with the Prime Minister of Japan both during my<br />
visit to Japan last year, our meeting at the APEC summit in Manila and again over the<br />
last day or so. And personally I welcome you very warmly to Australia and I hope that<br />
you and your wife can come again as very welcome and very honoured guests of our<br />
country. I accept very readily the suggestion of the Prime Minister that the Prime<br />
Ministers of Australia and Japan should meet on an annual basis. It is the hope of my<br />
wife and I that we can visit Japan next year and I thank the Prime Minister very<br />
warmly for that invitation.<br />
I agree with the Prime Minister's suggestion that the next Joint ministerial council<br />
meeting should be in Tokyo on the first of August. It should also be noted that the<br />
Australian Defence Minister, Mr Ian McLachlan will visit Japan shortly. Increasingly<br />
both the Japanese Prime Minister and I see the defence relationship as becoming part<br />
of the bilateral association. We spent some time talking about domestic economic<br />
reform. I also expressed the gratitude of the Australian government for the Prime<br />
Minister's positive response to my representations last year regarding the timing of rice<br />
tenders an extra tendering process for 7000 tonnes of rice allows Australia to offer<br />
new season rice. It's a good step forward and we hope it is the harbinger of further<br />
progress on that front. And on the question of access we look forward hopefully to a<br />
satisfactory conclusion of our desire for access for Australian Fuji apples. The Prime<br />
Minister informs me that there is one further public hearing in Japan to take place on<br />
the second of May and if that is satisfactorily processed then access can be secured. </p>
<p>I thank the Prime Minister very warmly for the support that Japan has privately and<br />
publicly given to Australia's aspiration to be included in the ASEM group of countries.<br />
Japan's support on this front has been open and consistent and it is deeply appreciated<br />
by the Australian government. Both of us agreed that the APEC association should<br />
remain the primary, the dominant expression of our shared destiny as partners in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region, and that although other associations and contacts could be<br />
valuable and were understandable the overarching importance of APEC remained. The<br />
particular value that institution provided in bringing together the leaders of such large<br />
and powerful nations as the United States, Japan and China was particularly noted.<br />
And finally I emphasised to the Prime Minister the deep concern Australia has about<br />
the impact both on Australia and Japan of the likely agreement between the United<br />
States and the European Union regarding emission targets. This is a situation where,<br />
atypically, Australia as a developed net exporter of energy is particularly vulnerable if a<br />
consensus emerges around targets which would be quite unacceptable to Australia.<br />
We believe that those targets would also have damaging impacts on Japan. We seek,<br />
as we believe the Japanese government seeks, a fair and feasible outcome but what is<br />
likely to be the American European position at present certainly does not represent<br />
that and would be particularly damaging to Australia's national interests and our<br />
position is very clear and strong on that. I welcome the opportunity of raising those<br />
concerns with Mr Hashimoto and it is something over which the Australian and<br />
Japanese governments will retain a close dialogue between now and the summit<br />
meeting to take place in Japan in December.<br />
HASHIMOTO: Thank you very much. I must say that I am very gratified by the very warm welcome<br />
extended to me since my arrival yesterday by Prime Minister Howard, the government<br />
of Australia and many people here. I come to Australia to strengthen the political<br />
relationship between Japan and Australia taking into fuill consideration Japan's Asia-<br />
Pacific policy and today I exchanged views with Prime Minister Howard on bilateral<br />
relations between the two countries. This is related to the Asia Pacific region and<br />
other international issues and I also described to him the results of my visit to the<br />
United States and to also outline the reforms that my Cabinet is currently undertaking.<br />
I also expressed to Prime Minister Howard my wish to invite him and this time<br />
together with Mrs Howard to Japan as soon as an appropriate opportunity arises.<br />
Furthermore as Prime Minister Howard already stated in his opening remarks, I also<br />
had the consent of Prime Minister Howard on my proposal to have a once a year<br />
meeting of the Prime Ministers as a guiding principle and also to hold the Japan-<br />
Australia ministerial meeting on the first of August this year. I also have a matter to<br />
report to you and that is during today's meeting I also received the full support by<br />
Prime Minister Howard for the Aichi Expo which indeed is going to be a great<br />
souvenir for me so I'd like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude.<br />
Concerning the security issues facing the Asia-Pacific region we share the recognition<br />
that the presence of the United States in this region is the most important factor for<br />
stability in the region and we reaffirmed the importance of support from both Japan </p>
<p>and Australia for the continued presence of the United States in this region. And we<br />
share the view that Japan and Australia should further promote cooperation on<br />
regional security through a senior level of political military consultations and I might<br />
also add we are very pleased to hear that the defence minister of Australia will be<br />
visiting Japan soon.<br />
Concerning Australia's participation in ASEM, certainly it goes without saying that I<br />
express Japans continuous support for the new membership of Australia and when I<br />
say this certainly it is with the assumption of course Australia will participate as an<br />
Asian member.<br />
I also explained that Japan highly appreciates Australia's contribution to the Korean<br />
peninsula Energy Development Organisation. In order to maintain the prosperity of<br />
the Asia-Pacific region Prime Minister Howard and I recognise the importance of<br />
maintaining and strengthening the free trading system and achieving the liberalisation<br />
and facilitation of trade and investment. We agreed to further promote cooperation<br />
between Japan and Australia in APEC and the WTO and furthermore we have reaffirmed<br />
our efforts to realise the accession of China to the WTO and to further<br />
incorporate China into the world community as a constructive member of it.<br />
As a concrete result of such cooperation between Japan and Australia we need to<br />
formulate a Japan-Australia partnership agenda for the occasion of the 14th Japan<br />
Australian ministerial committee meeting to be held on the first of August. Today we<br />
also confirmed our cooperation in 18 areas, including education, culture, the<br />
environment and many other fields, as well as in the political and economic spheres and<br />
these 18 areas cover seven areas in terms of bilateral cooperation and I I areas or items<br />
in the area of cooperation on inter-regional and global issues. I'm convinced that by<br />
promoting such cooperation in these areas we shall be able to achieve a far deeper<br />
friendship between our countries than today.<br />
HOWARD: Now could we have a question from the Australian gallery. Mr Bongiorno?<br />
JRNLST: The question is to Prime Minister Hashimoto. What is your belief in terms of the<br />
meeting in Kyoto at the end of the year. Do you believe that Europe and America<br />
would push for trade sanctions if mandatory targets are not agreed to in a voluntary<br />
way? HASHIMOTO: I have no intention of making the Kyoto conference a forum for confrontation. The<br />
current issue with regard to the convention on climate change is the substance or what<br />
to do about the substance of the protocol to be adopted at the third conference, the so<br />
called COP3 in Kyoto. In this regard we believe that at least with regard to the targets<br />
for control and reduction of greenhouse gases that these targets be effective in terms of<br />
preventing global warming and that also obligations to be imposed be fair and feasable </p>
<p>and in this respect I can understand the position of Australia which seeks to negotiate<br />
differentiated of targets. In order to achieve these targets we, the two countries<br />
included as well as many other countries, will have to work very hard and actively on<br />
those measures and especially as the Chair of the conference, I believe it our<br />
responsibility to make sure that the conference will not turn into the sort of situation<br />
that you mentioned just now by co-operating with the countries concerned.<br />
JRNLST: Because of the planned reduction of tariffs on automobile imports into Australia,<br />
Japanese manufacturers, who produce in Australia, say that they will be hard hit. I<br />
wonder what views you have, Prime Minister Hashimoto, on this?<br />
HASHIMOTO:<br />
Well as I was reading the press reports this morning, I noticed an article that said I will<br />
be raising this issue with Prime Minister Howard so I complied with the expectations<br />
of the press and raised it. What I told Prime Minister Howard is the following.<br />
Essentially this matter is a domestic affair of Australia. Now trade liberalisation is a<br />
matter, a common objective for all our countries under the WTO and APEC and<br />
something that we all must pursue actively. Japan's auto investment into Australia has<br />
been creating a lot of jobs and also has served as, should I say, lynchpin of the ties<br />
between Japan and Australia. So what I told Prime Minister Howard in conclusion on<br />
this matter was John, I trust you and I am sure that you will take into consideration<br />
these aspects as well and arrive at balanced conclusions. I do believe that Prime<br />
Minister Howard is a very trustworthy person.<br />
HOWARD: Don Greenlees.<br />
JRNLST: A question on security. There's been some suggestion by security analysts in Australia<br />
that we should try to upgrade the security relationship, perhaps along the lines of<br />
having the Foreign Ministers and Defence Ministers of both countries meet annually as<br />
you do with the United States. Do you, do both Prime Ministers see some merit in<br />
going down that route at some point in the future?<br />
HO WARD:<br />
For my part Mr Greenlees, I see merit in allowing the relationship in that area to<br />
evolve. I don't think we should dramatically accelerate it. Now, however should we<br />
have any kind of blind spot about it either and what we are doing, Ian McLachlan is<br />
going to Japan. As I said in my opening remarks increasingly I would see the defence<br />
dialogue becoming part of the bilateral association. I think it's something that should<br />
be allowed to move forward but not dramatically accelerated and I think that is<br />
something that both countries will feel very right about and very comfortable about. </p>
<p>HASHIMOTO:<br />
We mutually have expressed our appreciation for the Japan/ Us Joint Security<br />
Declaration of April 1996 and the Australian/ United States Joint Declaration of July<br />
1996 as major steps towards ensuring regional security. Our two countries have been<br />
conducting political military consultations since February 1996 and soon the Defence<br />
Minister for Australia will be visiting Japan and as Prime Minister Howard said, I also<br />
believe that we should try and build on these steps that we have been implementing and<br />
rather than run ahead with new enterprises or new exercises, I should rather like to<br />
make efforts to build up a firm relationship of trust by proceeding step by step.<br />
JRNLST: I'd like to first ask a question of the two Prime Ministers with regard to defence cooperation<br />
between the two countries. What are the specific themes or subjects that<br />
you'd be taking up and in connection with that I'd like to first ask a question of Prime<br />
Minister Hashimoto. There's an agreement between the Australia and the US, a<br />
declaration that training for US and Marine Corps in Austrila, opportunities for such<br />
training will be expanded. I wonder if this would lead to a reduced burden on<br />
Okinawa in terms of the marine ttaining there?<br />
HASHIMOTO: Let me say that in the Australia/ United States Joint declaration, I am also aware that<br />
Australia may offer additional locations for the United States to conduct exercises.<br />
However my understanding is that this offer will not lead to any reduced US presence<br />
in other areas of the Asia Pacific. Japan and Australia certainly have been and should<br />
continue to promote confidence building measures through the ASEAN Regional<br />
Forum and also through other regional dialogues in order to further improve the<br />
security environment in the Asia Pacific region. The two countries do share the same<br />
approach vis a vis regional security and our two countries, in sharing that common<br />
position, naturally should build up a natural co-operation in such areas. As a matter of<br />
reality there may be some aspects of training or themes of training in which Australia<br />
can provide a better environment and other themnese or aspects where Japan is more<br />
suited as the most suitable environment. So in accordance with such practicality<br />
training may shift from place to place but that does not mean in any way that Japan's<br />
sharing the burden will be reduced.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
For my part, I adopt the words that Mr Hashimoto used in relation to the defence<br />
dialogue, that it would be wise at this stage to proceed step by step and there is little<br />
point in beginning any kind of particular speculation about what form the association<br />
would take. Can I also say that my view regarding any potential link between Okinawa<br />
and the training arrangements provided for in the American/ Australian joint declaration<br />
is precisely the same as that of Mr Hashimoto's.<br />
Thank you. </p>
