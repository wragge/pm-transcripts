PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 19.<br />
December 1972<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION<br />
The Australian Government has begun moves for greater<br />
decentralisation of tertiary education.<br />
Part of this process will be rationalisation of tertiary<br />
education in Sydney to take into account population distribution.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. ' hitlamn, initiated the moves with<br />
letters to the chairmen of the Australian Universities Commission<br />
and of the Australian Commission on Advanced Education this week.<br />
He has asked them to prepare a joint report on the<br />
location, nature and development of tertiary institutions<br />
throughout and near the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas<br />
and in the Albury-, iodonga region.<br />
: He asked that the report be made as a matter of urgency<br />
by the end of March next year.<br />
In his letters to the chairmen, Mr. ' hitlam pointed out<br />
that the Australian Government intends to raise with the States<br />
next year the question of the Commonwealth assuming financial<br />
responsibility for tertiary education.<br />
He also said that the Government would not necessarily<br />
preclude consideration being given to the establishment of one or<br />
more location of an institution which did riot conform with<br />
the pattern of existing colleges and universities.<br />
This applied to the extent that the institution offered<br />
courses which perhaps spanned and even went beyond the interests<br />
of both present universities and colleges of advanced education.<br />
As Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party, Mr. Whitlam<br />
has previously said that tertiary institutions should be established<br />
at Penrith and Campbelltown, near Syduieyo"<br />
In his election policy speech, he said that at Albury-<br />
Wodonga the Commonwealth had the constitutional jurisdiction and<br />
the administrative options to establish another inland city the<br />
size of Canberra.<br />
