wide experience in industry.<br />
Mr. Menzies said he was greatly pleased that men of<br />
such standing and experience had agreed to accept the responsibilities<br />
of membership of the Commission in addition to their<br />
existing commitments. The Government, he added, was grateful<br />
also to the Universities and the business firms concerned, which<br />
in the national interest had agreed to put up with the<br />
inconvenience that must inevitably result from the absence on<br />
Commission business of such key men.<br />
