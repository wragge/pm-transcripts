COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO THlE UNITED<br />
STATES OF AMERICA<br />
Ministeria Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 15 May 196R]<br />
, Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
leave-Mr Speaker, the House<br />
will recall that I was to have had discussions<br />
with the President of the United<br />
States and members of his Administration<br />
on the 1st and 2nd of April, but because<br />
of the death of General Eisenhower the<br />
discussions which were to have taken place<br />
assumed the nature of preliminary discussions,<br />
and it was agreed that these<br />
should be continued on the 6th and the 7th<br />
of May. I now take the opportunity to<br />
report to the House on those discussions.<br />
They took place with the President, with<br />
the Secretary of State, the Honourable<br />
William Rogers, and with the Secretary of<br />
Defence, the Honourable Melvin Laird. I<br />
also took the opportunity to meet the<br />
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and<br />
some members of the Senate Armed<br />
Services Committee.<br />
The purpose of my visit was not to deal<br />
with any one specific subject. It was, in<br />
one sense, a practical expression of the<br />
close, frank and continuing relationship<br />
between two good friends-Australia and<br />
the United States of America. And it was,<br />
too, a visit designed to get to know the new<br />
President personally, to understand his<br />
thinking and to let him know my own. The<br />
ties between our countries, the common<br />
objectives of peace and progress and<br />
16447/ 69 human dignity transcend the personal<br />
relationships of any two individuals. But<br />
I believe these ties are reinforced, and<br />
practical working between two countries is<br />
made smoother, if two individuals-one a<br />
President and one a Prime Minister-have<br />
discussed common problems, have come to<br />
know one another, to understand one<br />
another, and to trust one another. And I<br />
believe that * this understanding was<br />
attained, and one result which has some<br />
value for us was the arrangement made<br />
between him and me for direct communication<br />
on matters of concern to both our<br />
countries during the formative stages of<br />
policy and prior to major announcements<br />
of policy.<br />
The subjects covered in the various discussions<br />
were the situation, and the courses<br />
open to us, in Vietnam; the importance<br />
attaching to the ANZUS treaty; the question<br />
of the continuing interest of the United<br />
States in Asia post-Vietnam; the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty; and such matters<br />
as defence procurement in Australia and<br />
the present plans of the United States Air<br />
Force regarding the Fill aircraft. Through<br />
all these discussions there was a deep feeling<br />
of warmth towards Australia, a feeling of<br />
a special relationship, a generous acknowledgement<br />
of the part Australia had played </p>
<p>and was playing to achieve common objectives.<br />
And I felt this to be so not only in<br />
the Administration but amongst the Senators<br />
I met on Capitol Hill.<br />
-Sir, it is understandable that my discussions<br />
with the President should have begun<br />
with Vietnam. We both wish ardently for<br />
peace in that country-but we both believe<br />
that peace can only be secured on any just<br />
or lasting basis by guaranteeing to the<br />
people of South Vietnam the right to choose<br />
the government they wish without the fear<br />
of terror or intimidation; the right to live<br />
without the ever present threat of murder,<br />
kidnapping or extortion. The President<br />
has today spoken publicly along the lines<br />
on which he spoke to me, and his speech is<br />
clear and unambiguous. We must now<br />
await the response of North Vietnam. But<br />
this Government agrees completely on the<br />
objective of free, internationally supervised<br />
elections, at which candidates of all parties<br />
could stand, as the objective for which the<br />
struggle is waged. This was discussed both<br />
during my original visit in April and during<br />
the visit just concluded.<br />
As a result of our discussions, and of the<br />
President's speech today, there are three<br />
things which I firmly believe to be true.<br />
Firstly, I do not believe that America<br />
will accept any fake peace or disguised surrender,<br />
nor will she retreat from the requirement<br />
that the South Vietnamese people<br />
should themselves choose their own<br />
government. Secondly, if in the future and before<br />
there is any agreement on the proposals<br />
made by the President today it is decided<br />
to, withdraw some United States troops<br />
unilaterally-and I do not say that this will<br />
happen-this should be regarded as a sign<br />
of strength. It should be so regarded because<br />
it would indicate a belief on the part of<br />
the United States that the South Vietnamese<br />
had so strengthened their own forces, and<br />
been provided with equipment for those<br />
forces, that they were themselves able to<br />
remove from the United States some of<br />
the burden which -that nation has borne.<br />
It would, I believe, be a tragic mistake on<br />
the part of North Vietnam or anyone else<br />
should they interpret any such move as a<br />
prelude to a general withdrawal or as indicating<br />
any retreat at all by the United<br />
States from their determination to persevere<br />
until the attainment of the objective of a<br />
free choice by the South Vietnamese. There will be those who will say, should<br />
there be such American reduction of force,<br />
that Australia too should at once reduce its<br />
forces. I believe that would be a wrong thing<br />
to do. For one thing, the Americans have<br />
greatly increased their forces since our contingent<br />
was committed; and for another it<br />
would be a shabby thing, the Americans<br />
having built up the South Vietnamese<br />
forces, to take some of the burden that is<br />
borne by half a million Americans, for us<br />
to withdraw our own forces and, to that<br />
degree, impose a further burden-or at<br />
least, to that degree prevent a lessening of<br />
the burden borne by -the United States.<br />
Thirdly, I believe that President Nixon,<br />
as his speech showed, and subject to the<br />
requirement for a free choice by the South<br />
Vietnamese people beinZ attained, will be<br />
flexible, untiring, and persistent in seeking<br />
to bring the fighting to an end. In this he<br />
will have our full support and our prayers<br />
will go with him as he tries to achieve<br />
this end.<br />
Mr Speaker, perhaps the strongest<br />
guarantee of Australia's future security<br />
against physical attack is the ANZUS treaty.<br />
It was first concluded under Mr Truman<br />
in conditions prevailing after the close of<br />
the war with Japan. But recently it has<br />
appeared that there was in some quarters<br />
a tendency to question whether the provisions<br />
of the Treaty still apply with the<br />
same force and certainty as at the time of<br />
it5 conclusion. Any grounds for such questioning<br />
should surely now be removed. The<br />
new President and the new Administration<br />
have strongly underlined the importance<br />
and the significance which they attach to<br />
that treaty. To quote from the public statement<br />
issued by the President:<br />
Australia is a member of Anzus and Seato,<br />
-two alliances which are fundamental to our--<br />
That is Americanstrategy and position in South East Aaia. As<br />
between us-<br />
America and Australia-<br />
Anzus with itz provisions for mutual aid in<br />
developing our individual and collective capacity<br />
to resist armed attack, and its declaration that<br />
, no potential aggressor should be under the illusion<br />
that any of them-<br />
That is, Australia, New Zealand or the<br />
United Statesstand<br />
alone in the Pacific area' is of great importance<br />
to both our countries. </p>
<p>And again:<br />
All things considered I think Australia and the<br />
United States can both be proud of the contribution<br />
we are making, as partners, to the security<br />
and progress of the Pacific region to which we<br />
both belong. That partnership and that contribution<br />
will continue.<br />
Mr Speaker, those two extracts are a strong,<br />
forthright and unambiguous re-affirmation<br />
of the application of the Treaty-and rather<br />
than weary the House with the statement<br />
as a whole, with the concurrence of the<br />
House I incorporate it in Hansard.<br />
THE WHITE HOUSE<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT<br />
It has been a great pleasure to welcome Prime<br />
Minister and Mrs Gorton to Washington. Mrs<br />
Gorton is of course returning to the land of her<br />
birth, so we always have a special greeting for<br />
her. Prime Minister Gorton is no stranger to our<br />
shores either, and he has come as -the Head of<br />
Government of one of our closest friends and<br />
allies in the world. We will always be delighted<br />
to see them both. This visit has been most useful<br />
for me and, I think, for other officers of this<br />
Government. It has given us a chance to get<br />
acquainted with an outstanding statesman with<br />
whom we expect to be working very closely in<br />
the future.<br />
Australia is a member of ANZUS and SEATO,<br />
two alliances which are fundamental to our<br />
strategy and position in South East Asia. As<br />
between us, ANZUS, with its provisions for<br />
mutual aid in developing our individual and<br />
collective capacity to resist armed attack, and its<br />
declaration that ' no potential aggressor should be<br />
under the illusion that any of them ( Australia,<br />
New Zealand or the United States) stand alone<br />
in -the Pncific area,' is of great importance to<br />
both our countries. Australian troops are fighting<br />
beside ours and those of other free world nations to<br />
help South Vietnam preserve its independence.<br />
Australian forces are stationed in Malaysia and<br />
Singapore as part of the Commonwealth Strategic<br />
Reserve, and Prime Minister Gorton has recently<br />
announced that these forces will remain after the<br />
British forces withdraw in 1971, to continue<br />
making their important contribution to the security<br />
of that area. This is a historic and far-seeing<br />
decision, and needless to say, it has our full understanding<br />
and the decision has our support.<br />
Australia is also making an outstanding contribution<br />
to peaceful co-operation and economic<br />
development in its part of the world. It participates<br />
wholeheartedly in the Colombo Plan, the Asian<br />
Development Bank, and many other regional<br />
activities. In percentage of national income devoted<br />
to foreign aid, Australia ranks second in the<br />
world. This is a record of which any nation can<br />
be proud. All things considered, I think Australia<br />
and the United States can both be proud of the<br />
contribution we are making, as partners, to the<br />
security and progress of the Pacific region to<br />
which we both belong. That partnership and that<br />
contribution will continue.<br />
These two days have provided opportunities for<br />
us to discuss a whole range of subjects, including 3 of course, Vietnam and regional security generally,<br />
but including also a number of topics outside the<br />
security field. Australia is geographically closer to<br />
some of these problems than we are, and Prime<br />
Minister Gorton has been in office a year longer<br />
than I have, so I have very much appreciated<br />
he opportunity to exchange views with him. I<br />
have obtained a number of new insights, but<br />
fundamentally, I find the perspective from ' down<br />
under' is very much the same as it is from<br />
Washington. This visit has been both profitable<br />
and enjoyable for us. I hope that you can say<br />
the same, Mr Prime Minister, and that you and<br />
your charming wife will come and see us again.<br />
It may be said that this statement affirms<br />
nothing new since the ANZUS Pact already<br />
existed-and in one sense that is true. But<br />
I believe that for a President just come to<br />
office newly to re-affirm, in such strong<br />
terms, the importance of the Treaty is of<br />
considerable significance to us, and to our<br />
future-and that that in turn is of significance<br />
to the United States and other free<br />
nations of the world.<br />
One further outcome of the talks on<br />
ANZUS is that it has been decided to hold<br />
a meeting of the ANZUS Council in Canberra<br />
in August. The United States will be<br />
represented by the Secretary of State, the<br />
Honourable William P. Rogers. We have<br />
also agreed that meetings of officials of the<br />
three countries should continue to take place<br />
from time to time, and for this purpose there<br />
will be a meeting in Washington later in the<br />
year. But the ANZUS Treaty does not merely<br />
provide that we shall be assisted if our<br />
forces or our country is attacked in the<br />
Pacific. It also provides that we shall<br />
co-operate in the establishment of installations<br />
to help our joint defence. Under<br />
Article II of the Treaty we have an obligation<br />
jointly to maintain and develop our<br />
collective capacity to resist armed attack. To<br />
say we have this obligation is not to sayas<br />
some falsely pretend-that we must<br />
accept any and every proposal for any<br />
establishment for any purpose.<br />
The Australian Government must and<br />
does retain the right of decision on any<br />
proposal. Just as it must be, and is, provided<br />
with full information concerning any proposed<br />
base. But we have signed a Treaty<br />
much to our advantage, and this imposes<br />
obligations on us if we are to live up to its<br />
spirit. A responsible Australian Government<br />
would therefore need to be convinced that<br />
there was good reason for rejecting a<br />
proposal, as, of course, it could. </p>
<p>There are some who argue that there is<br />
good reason to refuse any proposal for a<br />
joint defence establishment because such an<br />
establishment might become the target of<br />
attacks in nuclear war and might therefore<br />
endanger us. My Government rejects this<br />
argument. I cannot assert that in nuclear<br />
war there would be no possibility at all<br />
that such installations might be subject to<br />
attack. But I will deny that this is reason to<br />
reject such establishments. They contribute<br />
to the military effectiveness and protection<br />
of that power on whom the safety and<br />
independence of Australia might, in the<br />
future, depend. They assist that power on<br />
whose capacity for military defence the<br />
peace of the world may well depend.<br />
In my judgment Australia is subject to<br />
less danger, nuclear or otherwise, having<br />
these bases and a joint defence treaty than<br />
she would by not having these bases and<br />
not having a joint defence treaty. Furthermore,<br />
as a nation we expect to be given<br />
protection in time of danger: and we must<br />
therefore expect to give assistance in return.<br />
What sort of a pusillanimous, unworthy,<br />
nation would it be that said: ' We rely on<br />
you to protect us-but oh no we won't<br />
incur the slightest risk to help you protect<br />
yourselves, and us, and others'?<br />
This Government will not say that. If<br />
there be those who take a different view,<br />
that is their right. But it is equally their<br />
duty, if they aspire to alternative government,<br />
to state publicly they do take a<br />
different view, and would not have these<br />
bases, and give their reasons for it.<br />
I come now to the question of maintenance<br />
of secrecy about the purposes and<br />
operation of such bases. This has, I know,<br />
caused concern to others as it has caused<br />
some to me, and it was a matter specifically<br />
discussed with the President. In general, one<br />
would wish to give as much information<br />
as possible. But ' as much information as<br />
possible' must mean as much information<br />
as would not impair the effectiveness of an<br />
installation or enable a potential enemy to<br />
discover more quickly or more certainly its<br />
purposes, and if the advice of military<br />
leaders and military scientists is that little<br />
or no information should be given because<br />
it would help a potential enemy then we<br />
should accept that advice in peace as we<br />
would unhesitatingly accept it in war. This<br />
we have done, and will continue to do. The President, however, agreed with me<br />
that if any information is given, or is<br />
intended to be given in the United States<br />
in such a way that it becomes public, then<br />
such information must at the same time be<br />
given here. And if selected members of<br />
the United States Congress under pledge of<br />
secrecy make any visits to installations, so<br />
too, provided they take the same pledge of<br />
secrecy, must comparable members of -this<br />
Parliament be permitted such visits. To use<br />
the President's own words, in this matter:<br />
' The same ground rules will apply to both<br />
our countries'. The restriction of information<br />
on defence establishments is nothing<br />
new. To a greater or lesser degree it is<br />
a practice of all administrations in all countries<br />
at all times, and for reasons I have<br />
stated, and subject to what I have just said,<br />
we will continue the practice. But again, if<br />
there be those who would depart from this<br />
practice, who would insist on disclosure of<br />
information before agreeing to a joint<br />
defence project, it is their duty to Australia<br />
clearly to say so now even though that<br />
course might assist a potential enemy.<br />
The question will be asked whether or<br />
not provisions of the ANZUS Treaty, so<br />
clear in relation to Australia, New Zealand,<br />
and New Guinea, apply as clearly to Australia's<br />
forces stationed in Malaysia and<br />
Singapore. It would be misleading of me<br />
to say that this was so in all the variety of<br />
, hypothetical situations which might arise,<br />
for while the Treaty is quite specific as to<br />
certain areas it is not specific about those<br />
of which I now speak. Yet I think it would<br />
be equally wrong to assume that in certain<br />
circumstances United States assistance<br />
would not be forthcoming either under the<br />
ANZUS Treaty or in some other way.<br />
Indeed any attempt now to codify in advance<br />
those situations in which ANZUS<br />
might apply and those in which it would<br />
not apply could well be restrictive, and,<br />
being restrictive, do harm.<br />
Answers to questions about our forces in<br />
these areas are to be sought not in the<br />
ANZUS treaty alone but in the whole complex<br />
of actions and undertakings -by Australia,<br />
New Zealand, the United States, the<br />
United Kingdom, and the countries of the<br />
region. These actions and undertakings may<br />
be summed up as follows: Australia has<br />
decided that it will maintain forces in<br />
Malaysia and Singapore after the British<br />
withdrawal in 1971, for purposes and under </p>
<p>conditions already stated to the House. The<br />
President of the United States, publicly and<br />
privately, has backed, supported, and<br />
applauded that decision. What we seek to<br />
do is to prevent a threat arising against<br />
Malaysia or Singapore or the region, and<br />
we seek this by showing a willingness to<br />
assist militarily in stated circumstances to<br />
maintain security-and we see this only as<br />
a means to the end of advancing economic<br />
development in the area, strengthening the<br />
capacity of the countries in the region to<br />
defend themselves, and encouraging<br />
regional co-operation, peaceful change, and<br />
progress. The United States shares these<br />
objectives and is contributing to these ends.<br />
I am sure she will continue to share the<br />
objectives and contribute to these ends in<br />
Asia generally and in the region of Asia of<br />
which I speak.<br />
-Indeed President Nixon, during our<br />
private talks authorised me to express his<br />
own attitude as outlined now. He said that<br />
it was the purpose and the determination of<br />
the United States to continue to participate<br />
in the Pacific and to strengthen the forces<br />
of freedom and progress in Asia. He said<br />
that he recognised fully the United States'<br />
continuing role and responsibility in that<br />
part of the world. He said that by birth,<br />
by experience and by belief he knew that<br />
the stakes in Asia went far beyond what<br />
happened in Vietnam and that what happened<br />
in Asia in the future could well<br />
affect the future history of the world. He<br />
had, he told me, always been Asia-oriented<br />
as his history during 14 years in Congress<br />
would show. He had been born on the<br />
Pacific Coast, had gone to war in the<br />
Pacific, and he would continue to be Asiaoriented.<br />
The House may like to know that before<br />
being said publicly here this paraphrase<br />
which I have just given was confirmed with<br />
the President as an accurate paraphrase of<br />
his views.<br />
Mr Speaker, I think it is not without<br />
significance for Australia that such a firm<br />
statement should be publicly made by the<br />
new President at this time, and following<br />
so soon on our own decisions. In the course<br />
of our future history there will be many<br />
situations which cannot now be clearly<br />
foreseen, and as they cannot be clearly foreseen<br />
it is idle to speculate about them. But<br />
given the approach of the United States<br />
as I have jus: expressed it, given the shared objectives, and given the close working<br />
arrangements that already exist, I think we<br />
can be confident that should -a threat<br />
develop then there will be the closest consultation<br />
and co-operation as to the means<br />
of combating that threat.<br />
I shall, moving on, touch only briefly on<br />
the other matters discussed. I set out to<br />
the Administration and to the President the<br />
Australian Government's reservations as to<br />
signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation<br />
Treaty at present. Reasons for these reservations<br />
have been stated in -this ' House<br />
before. Our questionings include anxiety as<br />
to whether the Treaty offers an effective<br />
safeguard to a threatened country; the<br />
number of countries which have stated they<br />
will not sign it; the other coun'tries which<br />
have not ye" decided whether to sign it or<br />
not; the terms of the inspection clauses, and<br />
so on.<br />
I found the President fully appreciative<br />
of our position. He understood why the<br />
Australian Government was not signing the<br />
Treaty until our questionings were resolved<br />
to our satisfaction. I am satisfied that no<br />
pressure at all will be applied by the United<br />
States Administration to induce us to sign.<br />
I also took the opportunity, at the request<br />
of the Minister for Defence ( Mr Fairhall),<br />
to seek from the Secretary of Defence, the<br />
Honourable Melvin Laird, and from the<br />
Chief of Staff of the United States Air<br />
Force, General McConnell, further information<br />
as to intentions of the United<br />
States Air Force regarding the Fl11 aircraft,<br />
and general information regarding the<br />
aircraft itself. The original intention to purchase<br />
some 1,500 aircraft for the United<br />
States Air Force and the United States<br />
Navy has, as the House well knows, been<br />
very considerably reduced and I understand<br />
that the existing order is for 493 aircraft<br />
of which 141 are FlIlAs which are comparable<br />
with our own FIICs. The Chief<br />
of Staff was emphatic that the United<br />
States Air Force regarded the Fl111 as an<br />
exceptionally good aircraft and that it<br />
would be in service at least until 1980 and<br />
probably much longer. The United States<br />
Air Force expects the wing carry-through<br />
box to be tested to 8,000 hours, or two aircraft<br />
lifetimes, by July and intends then to<br />
remove current restrictions on the operation<br />
of the aircraft. However, the original<br />
contractual arrangements called for testing<br />
for 16,000 hours and I made it clear that </p>
<p>we would not wish to take delivery of our<br />
aircraft ourselves until that period of testing<br />
had been satisfactorily completed. It was<br />
again confirmed that the arrangements for<br />
the ceiling price for our planes remained<br />
in effect.<br />
These general matters were the subject<br />
of our discussion, but I understand there<br />
are many technical details and matters still<br />
under study by the Defence and Air Departments<br />
of Australia and that these will<br />
still need clarification and study by the<br />
Minister for Defence and -the appropriate<br />
specialist officers at a later stage.<br />
Mr Speaker, most of what I have said<br />
has dealt, in one way or another, with<br />
matters of defence. This is natural, for our<br />
own security in a changing world depends<br />
to a very great extent on our relations and<br />
arrangements with the United States-and<br />
on the credibility of United States power<br />
being maintained. I believe the President will be resolute to see that this power is<br />
maintained. He believes that if it is not, the<br />
peace of the world will be jeopardised. He<br />
will pursue an American position of strength<br />
and that strength will not be reduced until<br />
the world becomes a more secure and<br />
peaceful place.<br />
But defence is only a means to an endthe<br />
end of preserving the national independence<br />
of peoples so that they can pursue in<br />
freedom prosperity and the provision of<br />
opportunity for the individuals who make<br />
up nations. We, this Government, will do<br />
what we can to help in these objectives.<br />
I present the following paper:<br />
Prime Minister's visit to the United States of<br />
America-Ministerial Statement, 15th May<br />
1969.<br />
Motion ( by Mr Erwin) proposed:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
