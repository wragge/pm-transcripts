PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS OCTOBER 1978<br />
ELE CTORATE TALK<br />
The Government's campaign against abuse of the tax laws is<br />
continuing with the announcement by the Treasurer, John Howard,<br />
in the last few days of further measures.<br />
The new legislation is highly technical, as would be expected<br />
from the very nature of tax avoidance finding loop-holbs<br />
in legislation in order to avoid the spirit and intention of the<br />
law. In the last year there have been about 15 Government measures<br />
designed to stop-up chinks in the taxation legislation.<br />
Their value to the revenues amounts to some hundreds of millions<br />
of dollars.<br />
The Government believes there is widespread support in the<br />
community for the action which is being taken to curb tax avoidance.<br />
In some taxpayers escape paying their tax, then the burden falls<br />
more heavily on the rest. The average wage earner has little<br />
capacity to take part in such schemes while very many high income<br />
earners have chosen not to.<br />
Governments do not spend their own money they spend taxpayers'<br />
money and they thus have a duty to ensure that no-one cheats<br />
the system at the expense of others. The Government has an<br />
obligation to protect the person who plays the game by the rules,<br />
and it has a duty to weed out the cheats. When the tax burden<br />
is equitably shared according to the intention of the law,<br />
the great majority of honest taxpayers are the beneficiaries.<br />
The Government will keep up the pressure on tax avoiders.<br />
The law will stay under constant scrutiny and the loop-holes<br />
will be closed as they are found. This is an approacht to a<br />
problem which no government, including the last Labor government,<br />
has previously tackled in the same systematic way.<br />
Labor instead, when in office, concentrated its attention on the<br />
punitive taxation, which kills incentive for wage earners and<br />
stifles enterprise in businessmen. Repressive and unfair taxation<br />
is the breeding ground for tax evasion. Punitive taxes forced<br />
many small businessmen and farmers into a situation * where they<br />
were obliged to make arrangements to ensure the continuity of<br />
their enterprises. The Government rejects this policy of<br />
socialism, repression and dishonesty. Australians expect a fair<br />
reward for honest effort. They expect to benefit from their<br />
enterpri'se. and their achievements. </p>
<p>2..<br />
That is why -as well as legislation designed to prevent<br />
manipulation of the tax laws, there has been a major programme<br />
of tax reform in which Australia leads the world.<br />
Many of the complex arrangements which people entered<br />
over the years were simply designed to keep family farms an~ d<br />
businesses together. The Government's programme of taxation<br />
reform is making these increasingly unnecessary.*<br />
The Comonwealth Government gave the lead in the progressive<br />
abolition of death duties and the State Governments are<br />
now following suit. A system of investment allowance,<br />
and Stock Valuation Adjustment has provided a major incentive<br />
for businesses. Private companies have been enabled to retain<br />
more of their profits for use in their business activities.<br />
Above all, there has been enormous progress in the reform of<br />
taxation as it applies to individuals. In less than three years,<br />
the Coalition Government has brought in automatic taxation<br />
indexation, as well as carryin * g out a reform of the tax scales,<br />
reducing them to three steps, and placing the great majority<br />
of taxpayers on the lowest rate of tax.<br />
In the last Budget, it was necessary to bring in a special.<br />
and temporary surcharge of 1 percent which will ILast until<br />
June This year taxpayers will be paying $ 3000 million less in personal<br />
income tax than they would have paid if the 1975 Hayden tax<br />
scales still applied. The total revenue foregonte over the<br />
past three years is more than $ 6000 million.<br />
Boththis year and last year the increase in tax collections has<br />
been smaller than the increase in personal incomes. The taxpayer<br />
on average weekly earnings, with a dependent spouse, and two<br />
children, is paying $ 6 a week less in tax this year than he would<br />
if the old Hayden tax scales were still in force,' as well as<br />
receiving $ 7 a week because of the family allowances. He is thus<br />
$ 13 a week better off in terms of disposable income.<br />
Our taxation system is designed for honest tAxpayers, honest<br />
governments, and for incentive, enterprise and prosperity.<br />
This policy will continue. </p>
