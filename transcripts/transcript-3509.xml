OPEdING REMARKS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE lION, E. G. WIIITLAM,<br />
Q, C, o FOR CHANNEL 7, MELBOURNE, SECOND ANNIVERSARY PROGRAM<br />
( kI coiwED 2 DLCEMIER 1.9711 FOR fQ'LAY 9,30 P. M. ON 2 IECEMIsER 1974<br />
IN MELBOIRIE, SYDNFY, I1RISBANE, ADELJAIDE)<br />
I AM HAPPY TO TEL. YOU SOMETHING OF WHAT THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS ACHIEVED SINCE WE CAME TO OFFICE JUST TWO<br />
YEARS AGO TODAY. WE'VE HAD GREAT PROBLEMS, AS YOU KNOW<br />
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WESTERN WORLD HAS SHARED THOSE PROBLEMS<br />
BUT A GREAT RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT STANDS BEHIND US. AND<br />
DESPITE OUR DIFFICULTIES, DESPITE THESE WORLD-WIDE ECONOMIC<br />
PROBLEMS, OUR HOPES ARE STILL HIGH. WE HAVE IMPORTANT PLANS<br />
FOR THE YEAR AHEAD.<br />
As YOU KNOW, WE ARE CONTENDING WITH THE TWIN PROBLEMS<br />
OF INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT. No WESTERN COUNTRY HAS<br />
ESCAPED THESE PROBLEMS NOT ONE. FOR THE FIRST TIME WE<br />
ARE FIGHTING BOTH PROBLEMS AT ONCE. WE ARE CARRYING ON THE<br />
FIGHT WITH EVERY AVAILABLE WEAPON, EVERY MEASURE AT OUR<br />
DISPOSAL, EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL POWER WE POSSESS. WE'VE HAD<br />
VERY LITTLE HELP OR CO-OPERATION FROM OUR OPPONENTS IN THE<br />
SENATE OR ELSEWHERE. BUT I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER THIS:<br />
AUSTRALIANS ARE EVERYWHERE BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE BEFORE<br />
LABOR CAME IN. AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS, ALLOWING FOR INFLATION,<br />
HAVE INCREASED IN REAL PURCHASING POWER BY 3,2 PER CENT IN<br />
THE YEAR TO JUNE 1973 AND BY A FURTHER 3.9 PER CENT IN THE<br />
YEAR TO JUNE 1974. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THAT'S A GAIN OF MORE THAN SEVEN PER CENT IN REAL LIVING<br />
STANDARDS UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT, THE LIBERALS DID NOTHING<br />
TO SAFEGUARD EMPLOYEES THE GREAT BULK OF THE PEOPLE<br />
FROM THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND WE HAVE AND WE'LL DO MORE,<br />
THE LIBERALS DID NOTHING TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE EFFECTS<br />
OF UNEMPLOYMENT, WE HAVE AND WILL WE DO MORE, OUR<br />
RETRAINING SCHEME IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT AN ACTIVE,<br />
COMPASSIONATE GOVERNMENT CAN DO, AND REMEMBER-THIS ABOUT<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT: OUR PREDECESSORS, THE LIBERALS, CREATED<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT AS A DELIBERATE ACT OF POLICY, WE HAVE-NEVER<br />
CREATED IT DELIBERATELY, IT HAS COME ABOUT BECAUSE WE HAVE<br />
HAD TO TAKE ACTION TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD-WIDE INFLATIONARY<br />
CRISIS, AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO REDRESS THE HARDSHIP<br />
JUST AS SOON AS WE CAN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE HAVE TAKEN A<br />
WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC DECISIONS, WE NO LONGER REGARD THE<br />
BUDGET AS OUR SOLE INSTRUMENT OF ECONOMIC POLICY, WE HAVE<br />
BEEN MUCH MORE RESOURCEFUL, MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE IN OUR APPROACH,<br />
ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO I ANNOUNCED A NEW SERIES OF MEASURES<br />
TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT, WE HAVE<br />
MADE CUTS IN TAXATION WHICH, TOGETHER WITH THOSE IN THE<br />
BUDGET, WILL BE WORTH $ 1200 MILLION, AND THOSE TAX CUTS<br />
ARE BASED ON A NEW TAX SCALE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE<br />
FAMILIES MOST IN NEED, THE PEOPLE MOST NEGLECTED IN THE PAST,<br />
,/ 3 L </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE PRESSED AHEAD WITH OUR<br />
GREAT PROGRAM OF SOCIAL REFORM AND INNOVATION. OUR OPPONENTS<br />
HAVE DONE THEIR BEST TO OBSTRUCT THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE<br />
THLY HAVE NO WORTHWHILE PROGRAM 0O: THEIR OWN. YOU'LL RLMFMBERi<br />
THAT LAST APRIL THEY TOOK THE EXTREME STEP OF BLOCKING SUPPLY<br />
IN THE SENATE CUTTING OFF OUR MONEY. SO WE WENT TO THE<br />
PEOPLE: AND THE PEOPLE ENDORSED OUR PROGRAM FOR THE<br />
SECOND TIME. YOU RETURNED US TO OFFICE, YOU PUT US BACK<br />
ON THE JOB, ALREADY WE HAVE PUT MANY HISTORIC MEASURES THROUGH<br />
PARLIAMENT. WE HAVE EXTENDED THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WE<br />
LAUNCHED LAST YEAR INTO THE NEW AREA OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION.<br />
WE WILL BE SPENDING $ 100 MILLION ON TECHNICAL AND FURTHER<br />
EDUCATION IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS.<br />
WE HAVE SET UP OUR PETROLEUM AND MINERALS AUTHORITY<br />
TO HELP KEEP THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF OUR VAST NATURAL<br />
RESOURCES IN AUSTRALIAN HANDS.<br />
WE HAVE OPENED THE WAY FOR ORDINARY AUSTRALIANS<br />
TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE<br />
A. I. D. C. AND THE NATIONAL INVESTMENT FUND.<br />
WE HAVE GIVEN PENSIONERS THE BIGGEST INCREASE<br />
ON RECORD. WE'VE GOT OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAM UNDERWAY. 11/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
WE'VE GOT OUR HEALTH INSURANCE LEGISLATION THROUGH<br />
AN HISTORIC JOINT SITTING OF PARITAMENT.<br />
WE'VE TACKLED IIIL VEXED AND DIFFICULT QUESTION OF<br />
WAGE INDEXATION TO PROTECT WORKERS AGAINST INFLATION.<br />
WE'VE BROUGHT IN HISTORIC LEGISLATION AGAINST<br />
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES TO BAN PRICE FIXING AND<br />
PROTECT CONSUMERS. WE'VE INTRODUCED OUR NATIONAL COMPENSATION SCHEME<br />
TO SAFEGUARD EVERY WORKING MAN AND WOMAN AGAINST INJURY<br />
OR SICKNESS, HOWEVER CAUSED.<br />
WE'VE WON NEW MARKETS FOR OUR GOODS OVERSEAS<br />
AND VASTLY INCREASED THE RETURNS FROM THE SALE OF OUR<br />
COAL AND IRON ORE.<br />
THIS YEAR SAW THE OPENING OF THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE HERE IN VICTORIA, IT IS<br />
ONE OF 356 NEW HEALTH CENTRES AND OTHER PROJECTS APPROVED<br />
UNDER LABOR'S COMMUNITY HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.<br />
WE ARE THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO<br />
RECOGNISE THE NEEDS OF LOCAL COUNCILS. WE APPROVED GRANTS<br />
THIS YEAR OF $ 56 MILLION TO HELP COUNCILS THROUGHOUT<br />
AUSTRALIA IMPROVE THEIR SERVICES AND AMENITIES. </p>
<p>WE HAVE LAUNCHED OUR PLANS FOR A VAST NATIONAL<br />
HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND HAVE SET ASIDE $ 1200 MILLION FOR THIS<br />
PURPOSE OVER THE NEXT TIHIREE YEARS,<br />
THESE ARE A FEW OF THE MAJOR INITIATIVES WE<br />
HAVE TAKEN THIS YEAR IN FULFILMENT OF OUR PROGRAM A<br />
PROGRAM TWICE APPROVED BY THE PEOPLE, I AM PROUD OF ALL<br />
WE HAVE DONE, OUR OVERRIDING PURPOSE IS TO WIDEN THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES AND RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF EVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN, IN 1974 WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY TOWARDS<br />
ACHIEVING OUR GOALS, IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR US. IT<br />
HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR YOU, I HAVE TO TELL YOU FRANKLY<br />
THAT 1975 WILL BE ANOTHER DIFFICULT YEAR ON THE ECONOMIC<br />
FRONT, I HAVE MADE NO SCRET OF THAT, THE FIGURES WON'T LOOK<br />
GOOD FOR A WHILE, BUT I AM CONFIDENT THERE WILL BE AN<br />
IMPROVEMENT LATER IN THE YEAR AS OUR MEASURES TAKE EFFECT,<br />
ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THE SOLID, SECURE THINGS THAT MATTER IN<br />
THE LONG RUN OUR GREAT NATURAL RESOURCES, OUR BUOYANT<br />
OVERSEAS TRADE, OUR BASICALLY STRONG ECONOMY, OUR EDUCATED<br />
LITERATE, RESOURCEFUL PEOPLE, WITH THOSE THINGS BEHIND<br />
US WE CAN GET OVER OUR DIFFICULTIES AND GET ON WITH THE JOB<br />
OF MAKING THIS COUNTRY MORE PROSPEROUS, MORE JUST, MORE<br />
ENLIGHTENED, MORE EFFICIENT, I LOOK TO ALL AUSTRALIANSI TO<br />
ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY TO LABOR'S<br />
TRADITIONAL SUPPORTERS FOR CO-OPERATION IN CARRYING<br />
FORWARD OUR GREAT TASK IN THE YEARS TO COME, </p>
