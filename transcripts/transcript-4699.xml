PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 3 MAY 1978<br />
MEAT INSPECTION SERVICES<br />
The Prime Minister has written to the State Premiers seeking<br />
their co-operation to rationalise Commonwealth and State<br />
meat inspection services. He has also asked the Premiers to<br />
minimise inspection fees imposed by State Government bodies<br />
on meat entering metropolitan markets.<br />
Previous negotiations with the States extending over many<br />
years have failed to reach agreement. Existing arrangements<br />
involve separate administrative organiisations which lead to<br />
some unnecessary costs.<br />
It is common practice for State Governments to impose an<br />
additional inspection levy on meat sold within metropolitan<br />
areas.<br />
The Prime Minister said as this was a State Government responsibility<br />
he had asked the Premiers to see if these additional<br />
charges could be minimised.<br />
It was important to explore avenues to reduce costs and improve<br />
returns to producers in the depressed beef industry. Such an<br />
initiative had already been taken with the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal inquiry to examine beef marketing and processing<br />
margins. The Prime Minister is hopeful that with the co-operation of<br />
the States it will be possible to rationalise meat inspection<br />
services and keep charges to a minimum. </p>
