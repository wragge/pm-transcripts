    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................</p>
<p>  Well just before I take any questions can I just say that this morning</p>
<p>   has been an opportunity for me to understand the impact on people</p>
<p>   in a very direct and personal sense of what happened here a little</p>
<p>   over a week ago. It was quite an extraordinary act of God, a natural</p>
<p>   occurrence, quite beyond the expectation of, I think, of anybody.</p>
<p>   I have to, on behalf of the entire Australian nation, thank the</p>
<p>   Police, the Emergency Services, particularly the volunteers, but</p>
<p>   all of them the volunteers and the professionals.</p>
<p>  I believe Australia's emergency services are the best in the</p>
<p>   world. I don't think we handle these situations, I don't</p>
<p>   think any people handle them any better than what Australians do</p>
<p>   and those marvellous orange uniforms are now becoming part-and-</p>
<p>   parcel of the Australian psyche. They are part of Australian folklore,</p>
<p>   you see them everywhere whether it's the fires, the Thredbo</p>
<p>   disaster, Katherine, Wollongong, Townsville, wherever it may be.</p>
<p>   That marvellous co-operative volunteer Australian spirit comes to</p>
<p>   the fore and I think it is marvellous that people do sink their</p>
<p>   differences at a time like this. You have the odd exception to that</p>
<p>   which is distressing, stories of looting which is quite appalling.</p>
<p>   People praying on the misery of their fellow country men and women</p>
<p>   but overwhelmingly the community has banded together and I think</p>
<p>   the spirit of the city of Wollongong and the people of the Illawarra</p>
<p>   is to be applauded and I certainly, on behalf of your fellow Australians,</p>
<p>   do that.</p>
<p>  I want to thank the Mayor. I also want to thank Steve Martin, the</p>
<p>   Local Member, for the hospitality, the courtesy they have shown</p>
<p>   me today and the way in which they have put their point of view</p>
<p>   on behalf of the people they represent. This is an issue above and</p>
<p>   beyond politics. This is about Australians helping each other. I</p>
<p>   have had a couple of issues raised with me today, obviously there</p>
<p>   is concern about insurance. I will, through my appropriate colleagues,</p>
<p>   pursue that issue with the Insurance Council. This is not the first</p>
<p>   time this issue has arisen, it has arisen on other occasions and</p>
<p>   I understand the strength of feelings on that. Obviously I have</p>
<p>   to take advice and obviously the companies have a point of view</p>
<p>   to put but I want to say that I am very sympathetic to people who</p>
<p>   feel that their whole sort of financial future is on the line if</p>
<p>   their expectations are not met. But it is something that has to</p>
<p>   be examined according to the law. It has also got to be examined,</p>
<p>   I hope, from the company's point of view in an understanding</p>
<p>   and sympathetic way because this is an extraordinarily unusual occurrence</p>
<p>   and to say to an ordinary person, well you just have to cop this</p>
<p>   or that, is a bit tough. I think there is an occasion for some give</p>
<p>   and take in these sorts of situations and.....</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible]</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I will be arranging for the Minister for Finance, John Fahey,</p>
<p>   to have a talk to the Insurance Council about this. I did the same</p>
<p>   thing when I visited Katherine earlier this year when Katherine</p>
<p>   had that same problem. I can't unduly raise expectations, on</p>
<p>   the other hand, I am very sympathetic to what has been put to me</p>
<p>   this morning and I feel sorry for the people involved. And obviously</p>
<p>   the insurance companies have got a point of view to put and that</p>
<p>   has got to be listened to by the Government as well. I should also</p>
<p>   confirm that the normal additional cash support for people who particularly</p>
<p>   have struck circumstances by reason of their job no longer being</p>
<p>   there as a result of the damage, and subject to the normal criteria,</p>
<p>   that that cash assistance is available through Centrelink. The Mayor</p>
<p>   raised with me some concern on his part that there may have been</p>
<p>   a doubt that that was available. It is, it applies once again, it</p>
<p>   applied in the wake of the Katherine flood and this is over and</p>
<p>   above the arrangements that exist between the Federal Government</p>
<p>   and the State governments of Australia whereby when you have a disaster</p>
<p>   of this magnitude there is a contribution initially by the States</p>
<p>   and when it gets above a certain level then the Commonwealth assistance</p>
<p>   becomes available. Now, those arrangements, of course, apply in</p>
<p>   this particular case. But I wanted to come here today to talk to</p>
<p>   the people first and foremost, to express my concern and solidarity</p>
<p>   with them on behalf of their fellow Australians. I wanted also to</p>
<p>   find out if there were, above and beyond, what the Federal Government</p>
<p>   is providing under the normal arrangements, if there were other</p>
<p>   things that the Federal Government could do to help. And I certainly</p>
<p>   intend to pursue those, the insurance issue, I have confirmed the</p>
<p>   arrangement in relation to the cash support and I am quite sure</p>
<p>   that the Mayor will have one or two other things that he might want</p>
<p>   to put to me and I would be very, very happy to listen because we</p>
<p>   want to help, nobody could have anticipated this. I know it has</p>
<p>   shaken the community but it has also drawn the community closer</p>
<p>   together and it once again demonstrated that that shining Australian</p>
<p>   spirit of volunteer co-operation comes through when we have all</p>
<p>   got to pitch in and help each other in a time of common challenge.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible]</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Look we are prepared to be generous.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, on Friday the Governor-General said the insurance companies</p>
<p>   have got a moral duty to pay.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think you have got my views on the situation. I feel very,</p>
<p>   very sympathetic in relation to what has occurred and I think the</p>
<p>   best and most intelligent thing I can do apart from making statements</p>
<p>   is to get my Minister to talk to the insurance party.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  You will be urging the Insurance Council to [inaudible]?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well of course I think in a situation like this there has got to</p>
<p>   be some give and take and you can't always rely on the strict</p>
<p>   letter of the law.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible].. did you have some luck with that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We had some luck, yes. But look every situation is different, I</p>
<p>   have said what we are going to do and I am going to ask the Minister</p>
<p>   to talk to the Insurance Council.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Have you put a figure on how much the Federal Government is willing</p>
<p>   to help out [inaudible]?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No look, I don't think it is sensible on occasions like this</p>
<p>   to put figures on things. I have dealt with two specific issues</p>
<p>   that are concerning people Â– the insurance and also the Centrelink</p>
<p>   cash. I know that the Mayor will have some other views to put to</p>
<p>   me, we will have a bit of a private chat in a minute and I [inaudible]</p>
<p>   the Federal Government wants to help generously because this is</p>
<p>   a very difficult situation. But I am not going to start putting</p>
<p>   figures on things, I don't think that's the intelligent</p>
<p>   way to go about it. I think what you have got to do is to work out</p>
<p>   what is being already provided through the normal arrangements and</p>
<p>   if there are other particular concerns that people have, address</p>
<p>   them. But not by running around putting figures on it, I think that's</p>
<p>   just not the right way to do it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Carr was talking about a natural disaster relief fund, what is</p>
<p>   your reaction to that call? I understand you are going to speak</p>
<p>   with him about it this week?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think it is a question of working out what is the best response</p>
<p>   in each individual situation. I don't know that that is necessarily</p>
<p>   the answer, I think the answer is to have in place some very good</p>
<p>   co-operative arrangements which we have had now for years under</p>
<p>   governments of both sides of politics and they have worked well.</p>
<p>   And then on top of that when particular disasters come along you</p>
<p>   look at the circumstances of each particular disaster and decide</p>
<p>   what extra help you can give. I frankly think that works better</p>
<p>   because there's always going to be something more that you</p>
<p>   can do, there's always going to be some additional thing that</p>
<p>   a Federal government or a State government can do over and above</p>
<p>   the normal arrangements and over and above the tremendous volunteer</p>
<p>   efforts of the community. And I want to endorse very warmly to the</p>
<p>   Australian community, not just to the people of Illawarra but to</p>
<p>   the Australian community, the Lord Mayor's appeal. The Lord</p>
<p>   Mayor of the city of Wollongong launched an appeal and I commend</p>
<p>   him for that, I commend the Council of the city of Wollongong for</p>
<p>   the way in which it has worked and discharged its responsibilities</p>
<p>   and, of course, again could I express my heartfelt thanks to the</p>
<p>   Police, to the SES workers and all the other volunteers, the local</p>
<p>   charities, the Salvation Army and all those great organisations.</p>
<p>   It always helps, and to their untiring... and assisting their</p>
<p>   fellow country men and women at a time like this. I think they are</p>
<p>   magnificent and they do it better than any other group of people</p>
<p>   in the world. Thank you.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible]</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, no, I think you have more flexibility if you have a basic arrangement</p>
<p>   and then over and above that with particular disasters you respond</p>
<p>   with particular measures. I think it gives you more flexibility.</p>
<p>   Thank you.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Can I ask you [inaudible]?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well it depends how political it is. I haven't come here to,</p>
<p>   sort of, get into a political on it. I mean I recognise that this</p>
<p>   is a community effort, I have people of other political persuasions</p>
<p>   with me, I respect that, and they respect my position and I don't</p>
<p>   want to turn this into a slanging match between the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   and the Labor Party if that is what your question is about.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  No.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh right, I am relieved to hear that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  I would have moved onto it.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, I am sure you would have, yes.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  The Australian Council of State Schools have voiced a concern.....</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh you are asking me about taxation are you?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Yes, how does a GST [inaudible].....</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well look, I think our plan is fantastic but I am not going to say</p>
<p>   any more in this environment okay.</p>
