STATEMENT BY SENATOR GORTON ON HIS ELECTION<br />
AS LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
PAR LIAMENT HOUSE. CANBERRA OTH JANUARY, 196C<br />
I think that you will all realise that this is not really the<br />
occasion for a press conference which would delve quite deeply Into a<br />
number of matters that this is not the appropriate time to deal with.<br />
All I want to say to you and to those who may be looking at<br />
this programme is this. This is quite an awe-inspiring thing, using<br />
awe-inspiring in its true sense, to happen to a man In some ways it<br />
Is a little overwhelming. I am not yet the Prime Minister of Australia, but I want to<br />
talk to you, and any of those who are watching if they will forgive the<br />
presumption as If I were the Prime Minister of Australia. Tomorrow<br />
I have no doubt that we will continue In this country as we should,<br />
arguments, perhaps quite bitter arguments, as to the goals this country<br />
ought to seek, as to the methods of obtaining those goals, as to the<br />
differing priorities which might be put on different fields of national<br />
endeavour. That is tomorrow.<br />
In this moment I want to talk to all Australians, ar-Australiaqs,<br />
not as adherents of this party or of that. And I want to say to them<br />
thit I believe these last few days have shown it Is true that our<br />
common history and our common future show that in this nation the things<br />
that unite are infinitely greater than the things that divide.<br />
It is not going to be an easy task for me. but to Australians<br />
I would now say this in this moment They can be sure that I will try<br />
my best, and I will look to them for the strength successfully to conclude<br />
what we start which from within myself alone I thimk I could not get. And that<br />
is all I want to say at this stage and at this point of time.<br />
Thank you all. </p>
