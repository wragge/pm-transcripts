PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S VISIT TO AUSTRALIA 1966<br />
Hol tFaIifba. mx Airport, Canberra, A. C. T. OCTOBER, 1966<br />
Mr. President and Mrs. Johnson, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
Well, it has really happened! We have been waiting for a long<br />
time for the President to come to visit us. We have been hoping that he<br />
would come to visit us and now, as a product of this great conference which<br />
is to be held in Manila, we have him here in Australia with us.<br />
Mr. President, this is not only a notable visit. It is an historic<br />
visit because you are the first President in his period of office ever to visit<br />
this country indeed the only one and it is historic because you are on your<br />
way to what we believe will be a conference directed to our hopes of peace and<br />
a better future and, we believe, fruitful in the results that it will produce.<br />
Although the air of Canberra is chill and brisk, as it so often<br />
is, our welcome is warm and tremendously sincere, and you will find that<br />
warmth of welcome wherever you move around Australia or wherever<br />
Australians are to be found. Those unfortunate enou~ gh to be unable to see<br />
you in the cities, will follow your movements with close interest and attention<br />
as you move into the cities of Australia and on your journey north.<br />
It is, of course, not surprising that there should be a warm<br />
welcome in Australia for an American President, because indeed there is a<br />
welcome In Australia for any of the citizens of your great country. We<br />
Australians have always found it easy to be on terms of close friendship with<br />
you. We have reason to appreciate what the United States has meant to this<br />
country, and in our time of greatest peril we recall with gratitude the<br />
contribution you -made to the security of this nation. And so the American<br />
people stand warm and high in the hearts of the Australian people.<br />
But we welcome you not merely as the leader of this great people,<br />
Indeed the leader of the free world in these difficult times, but we welcome<br />
you and Mrs. Johnson as two warm likeable human be-ings whom we have come<br />
to admire and respect, and I am sure that as we in Australia get to know you<br />
better as we hope to do in these days of your visit, there will be established<br />
between you and the Australian people a lingering bond of affection which will<br />
persist down through the years.<br />
Now, Sir, I am not proposing to offer you on this occasion a<br />
spate of Parliamentary oratory. You will be subjected to quite a barrage when<br />
you lunch with us tomorrow. But I do want you and Mrs. Johnson to know,<br />
and through you, the American people, whose friendship we value so much,<br />
that this visit has been welcomed tremendously by the people of Australia.<br />
We hope that you will find in the visit interest and enjoyment with us, and you<br />
will go away feeling not only a better knowledge and even deeper appreciation<br />
of the Australian people and what they mean, but that you will treasure through<br />
your lives the memories of this, the first Presidential visit to this country.<br />
Finally, there is the circumstance that you, Mr. President in<br />
your period of office have revealed a close and deep awareness of the problems<br />
of Asia, and in particular of South-East Asia, and this is something which we<br />
appreciate tremendously. We think it means much for the peace and progress<br />
of the world as a whole, and your positive contributions to the aspirations you<br />
hold could be a landmark in the history of the world. We wish you well, and<br />
success in the endeavours you will bring to these great objectives.<br />
Mr. President and Mrs. Johnson Welcome to Australia: </p>
