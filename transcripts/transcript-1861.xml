VISIT TO THE U. S. 1968<br />
TEXAS<br />
PRESS CCNFERNM HELD AT LBJ RANCH<br />
N 30 MAY 1968<br />
THE PRESIDENT<br />
Prime Minister and Mrs. Gorton, General Westmoreland, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen: We are delighted to have you here with us today. I have an<br />
announcement or two to make.<br />
First, I should like to announce the promotion of Lieutenant-<br />
General Bruce Palmer, to the full rank of General. General Palmer<br />
will be retiring from his current position as Deputy Commanding General,<br />
U. S. Army, Vietnam, to become Chief of Staff of the United States Army<br />
with Headquarters in Washington. He will serve as the Vice Chief of<br />
Staff to General Westmoreland, who will be Chief of Staff. General Palmer<br />
has a distinguished . military career spannirg thirty-one years of service.<br />
He has been in Vietnam since March 1967, serving as the Commanding<br />
General of the Second Field Forces and as the Deputy Commanding General.<br />
In addition, I am announcing the re-assignment of General<br />
Ralph E. Haines, Jr., as Commander in Chief of the U. S. Army in the<br />
Pacific. He will replace General Dwight E. Beach, who is retiring. General<br />
Haines presently serves as Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army.<br />
I am alsc announcing numerous other promotions which will<br />
be supplied to you by the Press Secretary.<br />
We are delighted to have with us today the distinguished Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. Gortcn, and Mrs. Gorton, from I! iustralia. Although Mr.<br />
Gorton and I had met before in Canberra, this was cur first meeting since<br />
he became Prime Minister. Vie took the occasio~ n to spend a gccd deal of<br />
time together since his arrival last Monday.<br />
As all of you know, the ties between Australia and the United<br />
States grow stronger each year. As part of this shared vision, and to<br />
honour our common interests and commitments, our nr-n are now fighting<br />
side by side under General Westmoreland's leadership in Vietnam. So we<br />
have reviewed together, with Ambassador Vance, who returned from the<br />
Paris talks, the progress of the Paris talks. This morning, with General<br />
W~ estmoreland, we reviewed the course of the battle on the ground. As a<br />
result of our talks, I am confident that we have strengthened the bonds<br />
between our two countries as we face together the hard but the productive<br />
tasks which lie before us in the months ahead.<br />
It now gives me very special pride to award a Presidential<br />
Unit Citation to the D Company of the 6th Battalion cf the Royal Australian<br />
Regiment for extraordinary heroism while serving in Vietnam. I have long<br />
had reason to know personally what we have learned as a nation over the<br />
past half century since the world war. That is, that in a fight, there is no<br />
better man to have by your side than an Australian. Only yesterday morning<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
I received a typical report of Australians in combat. A very small unit<br />
of the Third Royal Australian Regiment was blocking an infiltration route<br />
towards Saigon twenty-six miles north-east of the capitol. About 1, 030<br />
of the enemy, some fresh from North Vietnam, threw themselves against<br />
this Australian base. Heavy fighting took place over two hours. The<br />
enemy withdrew, laving 44 dead and 32 weapons on the battlefield. Seven<br />
prisoners were: captured. General Westmoreland sent a message of<br />
congratulations to Major-General MacDcnald who commands the Australian<br />
forces in Vietnam. That is the kind of steady courage that we have come tc<br />
expect from the Australians. I think this is a very good moment to remind<br />
all of the American people of this fact. The war is not being fought in<br />
Vietnam simply by Americans; it is being fought by the South Vietnamese,<br />
the Australians, the New Zealanders, the Koreans, the Thais and the<br />
Philippinos. Together, we shall bring a just and honourable peace to<br />
South East Asia, for that is cur objective--and I want to repeat, that is<br />
cur only objective. From last summer to the end of March of this year, we<br />
have made a very special effort to move this war to the conference table<br />
and to peace talks. On 31 March, in a speech to the nation, I said that<br />
we would undertake a major unilateral act of de-escalation. We would<br />
lift the bcrpbing from most of the territory and population of North Vietnam,<br />
including Hanoi and Haiphong, and we would free cur hands so we could<br />
concentrate every resource at our command in the search for peace. At<br />
that time I announced I would not seek or accept the Presidential nomination.<br />
I felt that these two steps might--just might--bring Hand to the conference<br />
table. A month went by, but that has now happened, and these talks are<br />
being conducted in Paris. I cannot report to the American people any<br />
substantive progress, nor can I even report that Hanoi has matched our<br />
restraint with theirs. But if Hanoi will take responsive action, we are<br />
ready to go far and fast with them, and with others, to reduce the violence<br />
and to build a stable peace in South East Asia. We have done everything<br />
that we know how to do to bring us to this point. We shall continue to do<br />
everything that we know how to do to bring peace to the world.<br />
Now it gives me great pleasure to present the Presidential<br />
Citatcn to the distinguished Prime Minister. We would be glad to have a<br />
word from him if he cares to.<br />
PRIME MINISTER GORTON<br />
Mr. President, Mrs. Johnson, General Westmoreland, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
I accept with a feeling of very great pride in my countrymen<br />
this Presidential Citation which has been awarded for their heroism in action.<br />
So I shall take it and hand it to the Chief of Staff of the Australian Army.<br />
He and all Australians will feel the same pride that I do, that this has been<br />
presented for what they on that day did.<br />
I would like to thank you, too, Sir, during this brief visit<br />
tc the United States, for I shall leave tomorrow, for all the time that you<br />
have put aside for discussions with me, and for all the time which your<br />
senior officials and secretaries of relevant departments have put aside<br />
for discussions with me. </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
I feel that this has been of great advantage to me, and I<br />
believe that we know each other's minds as to the problems of the South<br />
East Asian area generally, and as to the future we both wish to see in the<br />
South East Asian area generally--a future where prosperity is able to be<br />
based upon peace and peace is able to be based on an absence from fear.<br />
I thank you, Sir.<br />
THE PRESIDENT General Westmoreland arrived here earlier this morning<br />
and briefed me and Prime Minister Gorton; and together we heard a somewhat<br />
detailed report from the Prime Minister of Australia of developments in<br />
South Vietnam. I should like to ask him to summarize for the American<br />
people and for those of you who have come here today that report he has<br />
given to us.<br />
GENERAL WESTMCRELAND<br />
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
I am happy to summarize my discussion on the situation in<br />
Vietnam. First, what are the current objectives of the enemy? In my<br />
opinion, his primary objective is to destroy the Government of South Vietnam.<br />
This has been his objective since 1958, but Hanoi is now emphasizing this<br />
objective more than ever before. Secondly, he wants to develop an image<br />
of strength in the eyes cf the people of the United States and the world in<br />
the hope that this will bring about an attitude of futility toward the success<br />
of our objective of a free and independent South Vietnam.<br />
How is he attempting to accomplish these objectives? First,<br />
by resorting to terrorizing the people, creating refugees, and attempting to<br />
coerce the people to demonstrate against the Government. Second, by wagng<br />
a massive world-wide propaganda campaign based on distorted informaticn,.<br />
Third, by defeating Vietnamese troops and isolating them from the Amtxican<br />
and free world forces. Fourth, by defeating the United States units for<br />
propaganda purposes. Finally, by seizing territory and thereby strengthening<br />
his posture in the South.<br />
The enemy is having to deploy ever-larger numbers of men<br />
from the North, and the war is destined to become increasingly more and<br />
more cf a North Vietnamese invasion of the South. The North Vietnamese<br />
are strangers to the people in the South and are unfamiliar with the area.<br />
In fact, now over 72 per cent of the organized combat forces, excluding<br />
guerillas, are North Vietnamese. It is estimated that there are approximately<br />
000 North Vietnamese soldiers in the South, with more arriving every day.<br />
The facade that the enemy has carefully created, that this is a war of the<br />
people, has been destroyed with the influx cf hordes of North Vietnamese.<br />
But in spite of this total effort, his only victories of the last few years have<br />
been in the propaganda field. In this connection, I am confident that the<br />
enemy is receiving false reports from his field commanders. This partially<br />
explains his alleged and exaggerated battlefield successes, which are distorted<br />
by a factor of from three to twelve, and in some cases even more. / 4 </p>
<p>In summary, the enemy seems to be approaching a point<br />
of desparation; his forces are deteriorating in strength and quality. I<br />
forecast that these trends will continue. Cn the other hand, the South<br />
Vietnamese armed forces are becoming progressively stronger and more<br />
effective. Our troops and those of our free world allies continue to perform<br />
in magnificent fashion. However, we must be prepared for continued heavy<br />
fighting ahead, especially in the northern area, the highlands, and around<br />
Saigon. But time is on cur side. Endurance on the battlefield and patience<br />
at home are required.<br />
THE PRESIDENT Thank you very much, General Westmcreland. It is very<br />
difficult to give, in a few minutes, the full report that you have made today.<br />
I have asked the General to take the statement that he dictated<br />
and reviewed with the Prime Minister and I and to make it available to you.<br />
You will have an opportunity to review the details of it much more at length<br />
than he has been able to go over with you now,<br />
0 We are very happy General Westmcreland is returning to<br />
Washington to take the place formerly occupied by General Blackjack<br />
Fershing, George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower as Head of the Chief of<br />
Staff of the United States Army and the leader of the United States Army<br />
in this country. His performance has been exceptional and brilliant. I<br />
look forward to working very closely with him in the days ahead.<br />
If there are any questions that you care to ask, I will be<br />
glad to receive thenm.<br />
SQuestion: Mr. President, in view of the step-up of the war on the enemy<br />
side, the unprecedented infiltration of men and supplies, do you have any<br />
plan to reconsider your partial bombing pause?<br />
PF resident: We have under consideration appropriate actions every day.<br />
They are constantly being considered. What is the proper course to bring<br />
peace in the world? What is the proper course to bring an end to the war<br />
in South Vietnam?<br />
Q. Mr. President, this week the House took action that would<br />
indicate the sense of the Congress is to tie a six billion dollar cut inFederal<br />
spending to any tax increase. Would you be prepared to sign a Tax Bill that<br />
has that big a Federal cut in it?<br />
A. Yes. For nearly two years I have urged the Congress to pass<br />
a Tax Bill. That tax amounts to about one cent on the dollar. With it,<br />
though, I think America could follow a sound fiscal course, and I have<br />
repeated those recommendations week after week and month after month.<br />
Without it, the gates of economic chaos, I think, could open, and I think<br />
the country would face several serious problems. First, an inflation tax<br />
of at least four cents on every dollar. Second, interest rates could go up<br />
as high as ten per cent. Third, a severe housing depression would be in<br />
the offing. Fourth, the disappearance of cur world trade surplus. Fifth,<br />
the end of cur unprecedented 87 months of prosperity in this country. Now<br />
the nation and the Congress are faced with a Tax Bill. But it has coupled<br />
with it a six billion requirement in a reduction of expenditures. I deeply<br />
regret that we are faced with such a choice, as I have said on several </p>
<p>occasions. The Budget that I submitted in January blended fiscal<br />
responsibility with what we considered urgent national purpose. That<br />
tight Budget was my best judgment in January, and that is my best judgment<br />
today. Nevertheless, the President does not make laws alone. He only<br />
approves measures that the Congress has passed. I have indicated that I<br />
would approve a tax increase with a four billion cutback in 1969 expenditures.<br />
Yesterday, however, the House of Representatives defeated a motion to<br />
limit the expenditure cutback to four billion. So the only choice remaining<br />
now is whether the need for a tax increase is so urgent that we must accept<br />
the six billion reduction. I believe that the need for a tax increase is that<br />
urgent. I believe that the national interest requires the tax increase as<br />
soon as possible, Therefore, if the Congress will vote for the conference<br />
report containing the tax increase and the six billion expenditure cut, I<br />
shall approve it. I urge the Congress to adopt the eonference report at as<br />
early a date as possible, and give me the opportunity to sign the measure.<br />
Q. Mr. ' President, do you share the belief of Cyrus Vance that<br />
because North Vietnam is at the conference table in Paris, it eventually wants<br />
peace and that, therefore, these talks are going to, as Mmi Vance put it,<br />
move to the end and go into full-scale peace negotiations?<br />
A. We feel that as a result of our statement back in March, as<br />
I repeated earlier, that we had two steps to take. One was to try to get<br />
Hanoi to the conference table. That has been done. How far are we going<br />
to get in those conferences is pure speculation. We don't know. We hope<br />
that we can have a satisf ' actory. conference that will produce results. I<br />
don't care to speculate. I do not feel it has produced any substantive results<br />
to this date. I think we must all continue to try to expore every possible<br />
avenue; get down to substantive discussions as soon as possible. But as<br />
to what the outcome might be, I think I would rather let developments take<br />
care of that.<br />
Q. Mr. President, could you tell us wlie re, if you get this Bill<br />
now through Congress, you feel you would be forced to make most of these<br />
cuts in human terms, what the country is likely to lose from that kind of<br />
a spending cut? We will have to make announcements on that. I wouldn't<br />
want to make an announcement on a measure that I have not seen, and<br />
expenditure cuts that have not been made. After the measure gets to me,<br />
if it is in the amount that the conference report contains, I will sign it.<br />
Then we will ask the Budget Director to review with all the departments<br />
the cuts. We generally feel that they will be divided in non-Vietnam defence<br />
expenditures and other Budget expenditures. But I do not have the time or<br />
the information that would permit me to outline in specific detail how they<br />
would add up.<br />
Q. Mr. L-President, today, in light of what has been happening in<br />
France, there is quite a run on the French franc. I wonder if you could give<br />
us your judgment on whether that will increase or decrease the pressures on<br />
the U. S. dollar.<br />
A. We are very hopeful that the leadership of France and the<br />
people of France will find ways and means to bring stability in that country.<br />
we realize that the developments there not only have a serious effect on<br />
France but on the entire world. The leadership of France is taking certain<br />
steps and putting in motion certain actions. I don't care to speculate on how<br />
successful those actions will be or what their outcome will be. I do know<br />
that it is very important to the American people and the rest of the world<br />
that we have stability in France. We deeply regret the problems that face<br />
the French people. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
Q. Mr. President, is the Administration determined to accept<br />
aanti-Crime Bill even if amendments remain which would authorize<br />
wiretapping and attempt to limit Supreme Court decisions?<br />
A. The Administration strongly favours an anti-Crime Bill<br />
and has for several years, and has urged the Congress to take action on<br />
the Crime Bill. Both Houses have now acted. That measure is in conference.<br />
When the conferees reconcile their views, we hope the measure will come<br />
to the President. Then I will review'fthe details of it and take the action<br />
that I believe is in the best interest of the American people, I hope the<br />
conferees can worlk out the differences between the two bodies and reconcile<br />
their different viewpoints. I would, of course, express the hope that the<br />
measure that comes to me is as near the measure that I recommended<br />
as possible, although I know that that is too much to expect. Mr. Kilpatrick?<br />
Q. Did General Westmoreland report that his position on the<br />
ground has been weakened by the partial halt in bombing, Mr. President?<br />
No.<br />
Q. Mr. President, last night you advocated that the right to<br />
vote be granted to eighteen year olds across the country. Since the States<br />
set this voting age, is there anything you can do or intend to do in the time<br />
you have left in the Presidency to bring this about?<br />
A. Over the weekend, Mr. Davis, we will be working on a<br />
very special message to Congress. A constitutional amendment will be<br />
required. The President will send that message to Congress I hope next<br />
week, making his recommendation.<br />
Q. Mr. President, in view of the reports of increased casualties,<br />
and General Wiestmoreland's teport to you on battlefield conditions, does<br />
the Administration foresee any needs for a stepup or an increase in our<br />
troop strength in Vietnam beyond what you have already announced?<br />
A. General Wiestmoreland has made no such recommendation.<br />
Thank you, Mr. 1President. </p>
