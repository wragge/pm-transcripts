The Australian and New Zealand Governments will establish a world leading agency to regulate medicines, medical devices and other therapeutic goods in both countries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key today signed a statement of intent to implement the joint agency progressively over a period of up to five years.</p>
<p>The new agency will reduce regulatory costs for industry and improve the standard of therapeutic goods produced in our two countries.</p>
<p>Put simply, it will ensure that Australians and New Zealanders have access to medicines, medical devices and other therapeutic goods that are of world-leading standard.</p>
<p>The new scheme will also encourage economic integration of our pharmaceutical markets and enhance the reputation of Australian and New Zealand products on the world market.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the new agency  -  the Australian and New Zealand Therapeutic Products Agency (ANZTPA) -- will replace our Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (Medsafe). It will be accountable to both the Australian and New Zealand Governments.</p>
<p>The staged implementation will begin straight away so consumers and industry can start benefiting from the new arrangements.</p>
<p>The TGA and Medsafe will take immediate steps to share information, training and expertise between our two countries to bring immediate benefits to both agencies.</p>
<p>As business operations become increasingly integrated and a following a review of progress, the single regulator will then be established.</p>
<p>Agreement for a joint regulatory scheme was first reached in 2003, however, negotiations between the countries were suspended in July 2007.</p>
<p>The new arrangements will build on reforms previously developed through to 2007, many of which are already underway within Australia's TGA. </p>
