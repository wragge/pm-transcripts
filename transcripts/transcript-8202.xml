TRANSCRIPT OF' JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PREMIER WAYNE<br />
GOSS, BRISBANE AIRPORT, 16 NOVEMB3ER 1990<br />
E &amp; 0ES-PRCOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the significance, Prime Minister, of<br />
this agreement as far as Commonwealth-State relations are<br />
concerned? PM: Well the significance is that after three years of<br />
attempting to get a position where there would be<br />
effective management and protection of the World Heritage<br />
area in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, we've demonstrated<br />
that now that; with the election of Wayne Goss and the<br />
Labor Government in December of last year that the<br />
interests of the people, not just of Queensland but of<br />
Australia, have been put first. With the election of<br />
Wayne we were able to put behind us all the negativism of<br />
the past of t: he previous Queensland Government and we sat<br />
down and in March of this year we reached the initial<br />
agreement and now this is the culmination of that<br />
agreement which we tentatively reached then and under<br />
which Queensl1and will undertake the responsibil. ity of the<br />
day to day = mnagement of the Wet Tropics area. Together<br />
we will be putting in a substantial amount of money, I<br />
think about $ 11M this year, Wayne, from the Commonwealth<br />
and the State Government to ensure that for this and<br />
future generations this great natural resource is going<br />
to be nurtured and protected and made available for<br />
enjoyment by not only the people of Australia but I think<br />
an increasing number of people from overseas. It's a<br />
very important day and I want to express my sincere<br />
gratitude -to Wayne Goss and the Government of Queensland<br />
for the fulsome cooperation that they've extended which<br />
has enabled us to reach this important day.<br />
GOSS: From our point of view this is a very important day<br />
not just for Queensland but, I think, for Australia<br />
because the ' Wet Tropics are of national and indeed<br />
international significance and they are now secured,<br />
their future is secured by this agreement and by what I<br />
think is a remarkable cooperative arrangement between the<br />
Commonwealth Government and Queensland. There are a lot<br />
of people in the National Party who are claiming that come<br />
this day the Wet Tropics were going to be annexed by<br />
Canberra. well Bob's given me an assurance they're not<br />
going to tow it away, it's going to be left in North<br />
Queensland and it is going to be what we all want it to<br />
be, and that is one of the most magnificent areas in the </p>
<p>country properly managed. I mean the past three years<br />
have seen a brawl, they've seen the Wet Tropics under<br />
threat, we've sQeen millions of dollars wasted on legal<br />
challenges. The future sees those millions of dollars<br />
going in on a joint basis by the Commonwealth and the<br />
State to manage and protect the Wet Tropics long term.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Premier Goss has organised a<br />
summit, an environment summit, for next year to look at<br />
dispute settling procedures. Would you like to endorse<br />
that summit and perhaps see any national bipartisan<br />
agreement or any agreement might come out of that?<br />
PM: Well there are two things to say. I mean history in<br />
a sense is overtaking us. Firstly, that Wayne and I have<br />
talked about this and we would want to be cooperative and<br />
involved. Secondly, of course, at the Special Premiers'<br />
Conference whiLch we held up here just very recently and<br />
which Wayne and the Queensland Government did so much to<br />
make it a success by their pre-organisation for it, at<br />
that we agreed again on the need for Commonwealth-State<br />
cooperation in these areas. What we have now is a<br />
position of common ground where we recognise the<br />
responsibility that Government have as well as for<br />
economic development which we share. We also have a<br />
responsibility for making the right decisions about<br />
protecting the environment. We recognise that there are<br />
areas of shared responsibility and we want to make sure<br />
that we have effective complementarity between the things<br />
that we do so that it's effective in terms of<br />
discharging the obligation we have in protecting the<br />
environment. And in respect of the legitimate<br />
development which must take place in this country that we<br />
put the least unnecessary impediments in the way by<br />
duplication and unnecessary doubling up of processes. I<br />
think we are at one on that.<br />
GOSS: Absolutely. I think the other thing that you<br />
should know is that during the Premiers' Conference I had<br />
private talks with Bob in relation to the Conference and<br />
secured his approval for the Commonwealth Government's<br />
Ambassador on the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, and<br />
the Federal Environment Minister, Ros Kelly, to<br />
participate in the conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: noisy brawls previously are now costing<br />
Australia and Queensland tens of millions of dollars and<br />
knocking the confidence of investors coming here<br />
PM: I think it's true to say that the lack of there<br />
are two things I think are relevant in answer to your<br />
question. I think in the past, particularly in regard to<br />
Queensland, the siege mentality that existed on the part<br />
of the previous government who wouldn't accept the bona<br />
f ides of the : Federal Government created an atmosphere, a<br />
poisonous atmosphere which would certainly have worried<br />
people who were concerned about the future, either from </p>
<p>an environmental sense or from a developmental sense. I<br />
think that's true. Secondly, I would say that the rather<br />
ad hoc nature of approach that had necessarily been<br />
adopted in the past was something that gave rise to<br />
uncertainty and that's why we at our level and Wayne, of<br />
course, at his level has been doing things as well. But<br />
at our level we've tried to introduce a certainty of<br />
process now. There are three elements to that. We've<br />
set up the Resource Assessment Commission so that we're<br />
going to be able to on these broad issues give the<br />
opportunity for developers, environmentalists, State<br />
Governments, unions and business to actually have an<br />
input into the consideration of these broad issues.<br />
Secondly, we've set up the ecologically sustainable<br />
development processes in specific sectors of industry<br />
which will report to us by the end of the year. We've<br />
got the cooperation and involvement of the State<br />
Governments in that. So that at the end of that process<br />
I hope we'll be able cooperatively to lay down clear<br />
guidelines and principles which will be available to<br />
everyone. The third point, of course as I've said, is<br />
the cooperation we now have out of the Special Brisbane<br />
Conference with the States which I think will mean that<br />
everyone concerned in this area, both those whose<br />
emphasis is the environment and those who are concerned<br />
with development, will know that there is a clear cut<br />
relationship and a complementarity between Commonwealth<br />
and State approaches on these issues. So whether you<br />
look at any one of those issues, the existence of a sort<br />
of troglodyte; government in the past up here, that's<br />
fixed. The emergence of Wayne and the Labor Government<br />
and the actual processes have been rectified and the<br />
basis of cooperation established.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, going soft on<br />
environmental concerns since the election from some<br />
environmental quarters. Can you wear that criticism?<br />
PM: I can wear criticism which ever side it comes from.<br />
I mean I-thirik Wayne in your now relatively short period<br />
in Government: has come to recognise, and indeed we've<br />
talked about it, but in these sort of areas you can never<br />
have 100% winLS. You will never really totally satisfy<br />
some people in the environment movement whose agenda is<br />
almost limitless. I don't say that in a hectoring way.<br />
In fact in respect of altoPo them I don't question their<br />
integrity but: they do have, many of them, a fairly<br />
elastic agenda and you will never totally satisfy them.<br />
On the side of some people it's dig up anything, cut down<br />
everything. Now those sort of red-neck developers,<br />
you'll never satisfy them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister<br />
PM: If I could make a final point. What you've got to<br />
do as Wayne was trying toi" do here, we're trying to do<br />
federally, is you've got to establish a process which<br />
gives opportunity to the interest groups to express their </p>
<p>point of view. Once you've established that process so<br />
it's not just a system of ad hockery, then 1 think you're<br />
well on the way to not satisfying everyone but at least<br />
everyone knows where they are.<br />
GOS8: I think what this agreement's about is that I<br />
mean, on either extreme with the developm~ ent and the<br />
environmental lobby you'll always get comfplaints about<br />
governments. But by this sort of cooperative approach,<br />
by trying to gret results, you get the right balance and<br />
the broad pub]. ic want to see that. That's what I think<br />
we've got to achieve as Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who does more harm, the radical greenies or<br />
the red-neck developers?<br />
PM: I think that's a pointless question and I know<br />
you're asking it for constructive purposes. bona<br />
f ides in that respect. But I think in some circumstances<br />
one would say that the position of the environmentalists<br />
is the harder to sustain on a particular issue. On<br />
others the environmentalists are basically right and the<br />
developers who'll want to do that particular thing<br />
haven't thought it through correctly. I mean there is no<br />
overall judgexient to be made about that, I think.<br />
JOURNALIST*. Prime Minister, what was the substance of<br />
your talks last night with President Bush?<br />
PM: The main purpose of my call, we spoke the best part<br />
of half an hour, was the Uruguay Round because I wanted<br />
to convey to t: he President the profound concern that I<br />
feel about the sense of crisis and the reality of crisis<br />
which has developed in the Uruguay Round talks. They<br />
were scheduled to complete in the week commencing the 3rd<br />
December in Brussels. That was to be the final week.<br />
Now on the situation that's been created by the European<br />
Community where they put a totally unrealistic offer on<br />
the table which is totally prejudicial to the interests<br />
of Australia 4ind the Cairns Group and particularly of our<br />
rural producers, I was not prepared to sit by ain just say<br />
well all is lost. The basic point that George Bush and I<br />
discussed was the need to inject now into these latter<br />
stages of the Round, political clout, that the<br />
negotiating Ministers must know that at the Heads of<br />
Government level there is a concern that we are facing<br />
not merely a potential economic crisis but a political<br />
crisis because if the world doesn't come to sensible<br />
decisions to create a freed up, liberalised,<br />
international trading system then the losses are not<br />
merely economiLc but they will have profound political<br />
implications. So we talked about that and how we can get<br />
more political input and impetus to the process.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did he give you some sort of indication that<br />
he'd be taking some sort of decisive action to overcome<br />
the impasse? </p>
<p>PM: He outlined actions that he was taking. Held Just<br />
within the previous 24 hours, he'd had meetings with the<br />
Lords of the European Community and the Commission and<br />
the Italian leadership and he also indicated to me at<br />
that time that Secretary of State Baker was going to be<br />
engaged inbi lateral discussions with the European<br />
leaders on this issue. So he-and I are at one on the<br />
understanding of the dimension of the crisis and the need<br />
to exert leadership and we have undertaken to continue to<br />
be in contact about what comes through from these<br />
initiatives that he's taking, the initiatives that I'll<br />
be taking flow in contact, direct contact with European<br />
leaders. So-we are at one on this issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: ' Have you reached a decision on whether<br />
you'll be going personally to Brussels?<br />
PM: No, I won't be going personally to Brussels because<br />
at this stage the need is to get into the Brussels<br />
meeting and i~ n the minds of the Ministers involved, the<br />
political concerns that there is at the Head of<br />
Government. So we've injected that. It is possible that<br />
if the Brussels meeting doesn't of itself generate<br />
discernible progress that we may need to contemplate a<br />
Heads of Government meeting subseguent to that and we did<br />
have some preliminary discussions about that. He did ask<br />
me what we -talked about it was overwhelmingly about the<br />
Uruguay Round, as I've explained to you. 1, of course,<br />
took the opportunity of discussing the Gulf with him and<br />
we both affirmned to one another the commitment that we<br />
have firstly -to the essentiality of the withdrawal of<br />
Iraq from Kuwait and the release of all hostages and the<br />
profound hope that we both share that this conclusion can<br />
be achieved by peaceful means.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did he seek any greater commitment from<br />
Australia if the Gulf war eventuates?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: And was there any indication from him that<br />
the outbreak of hostilities was imminent?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Or inevitable?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: fir Hawke, apparently last night there was a<br />
fairly savage attack on Mr Hewson.<br />
PM: Last night?<br />
JOURNALIST: Or yesterday. Some parties are suggesting<br />
that maybe you and Mr Keating were..<br />
PM: Yes, some people would want to do that to avoid the </p>
<p>realities. I mean if you're on weak ground you always<br />
seek~ to divert attention from weakness by suggesting that<br />
there has been some lack of gentlemanliness in th~ e iftttaci<br />
that's been made. The realities, of course, are that Dr<br />
Hewson is the pathetically weak leader of not just an<br />
irrelevant Opposition but a dangerous Opposition. That<br />
has been made clear by myself and Paul Keating in two<br />
distinct areas. In the area of economic policy he's been<br />
exposed e a man who, as Paul Keating graphically but<br />
rightly put it, will roar like a lion at his doorstop<br />
interviews and say we must cut Government expenditure,<br />
$ 3B. But when the chips are down on an issue which<br />
would've immediately in this year saved $ 25M4 or $ 5714 in a<br />
full year, he goes in and puts the proposition of support<br />
for the Government in his Caucus, but then rolls over and<br />
allows himself to be done, doesn't fight for it and<br />
indeed so weak is his attitude in his own Party room,<br />
that it becomeas a matter of comment to the media by his<br />
colleagues. Now that's something that you should attack<br />
in Government. I mean if you are concerned about<br />
responsible economic management then you can't afford, in<br />
our judgement, to tolerate such weakness and hypocrisy on<br />
the part of the Opposition and its leadership. To expose<br />
that is not going over the top, to expose that is our<br />
responsibility. And I said there were two areas.<br />
Secondly, the area of foreign affairs. I mean we had the<br />
ridiculous situation which emerged yesterday that we have<br />
the opposition in this country now attacking not simply<br />
Nelson Mandela and those who fought against apartheid,<br />
but we . now have them attacking the President of South<br />
Africa and accusing him of playing favourites because he<br />
has chosen as his interlocker, Nelson Mandela. These<br />
things, you know, are just ridiculous intrinsically but<br />
they are also dangerous for Australia.<br />
PM: Prime Minister, Keith Wright this morning has said<br />
that he will be defecting factions. Are you concerned<br />
about what appears to be growing factionalism? I mean<br />
that's three MPs now who have indicated<br />
PM.-That's not growing factionalism, it's a bit of a<br />
reshuffling cof the pack.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
Pm: It's not: unseemly at all. I mean I think that if<br />
Keith believes that he will be more comfortable in the<br />
Left then that's a decision that I can live with and<br />
presumably the Left is able to live with. That's alright<br />
with me. He will be continuing to be a good<br />
representative for his electorate and making a good<br />
contribution in the Parliament. You see, what we've got<br />
in the Labor Party is a system that's not perfect. I<br />
mean I've had my things to say about us and the factional<br />
system has never worked perfectly. But see what you've<br />
got to understand is the difference between Labor and the<br />
conservatives is this; Labor is about change, Labor never<br />
accepts that society as it is is perfect. We believe </p>
<p>that it always can be improved. That's why we now are on<br />
the eve and it's appropriate to say it here in this<br />
great State of Queensland which was in so many ways the<br />
cradle of the birth of Labor we are now on the eve of<br />
the centenary of the Labor Party, unchanged in name and<br />
unchanged in comitment. That commitment is to change.<br />
and improve society. Now when you have that sort of<br />
Party you have within it: people who have causes and<br />
concerns and some people will want to deal faster with<br />
some issues thtan with others. Now the way that's worked<br />
out is that people are in the factional groups but<br />
they're united, united about wanting to affect a better<br />
society. That's Labor. On the other side all you have<br />
Is this mindless, grasping back for the past of wanting<br />
to restore thiLngs that are unrestorable and shouldn't be<br />
restored. So you get changes of names in the<br />
conservatives, they change their name, change their<br />
leaders. In a sense, nothing changes with them. I can<br />
live with these things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, factionalism hasn't been a<br />
problem in the federal sphere yet it was so divisive for<br />
the Labor Party here in Queensland for so many years.<br />
Are you worried that it could become divisive at the<br />
federal levell?<br />
PM: No it won't become divisive. I mean we get value<br />
out of the faction system. It is a way in which you know<br />
who to deal wi~ th and instead of having to say well now<br />
you know some people have got a different point of view<br />
and they've got a different point view, but with the<br />
factional system at least you've got a method of<br />
organisation. As I say, let me make it quite clear, the<br />
faction systemi isn't perfect and it can cause problems at<br />
times. But we've shown now in nearly 8 years of<br />
Government how it can be a force for good and Wayne Goss<br />
here in Queensland is sitting in control of the<br />
situation, he recognises that groups exist and he's able<br />
to work with them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Australian Embassy<br />
off icial who last year apparently took to two Chinese<br />
refugees with a stockwhip and an air pistol has been let<br />
off withAfine of $ 350, demoted but he still remains in<br />
the Department. Isn't that fairly lenient?<br />
PM: It seems on the face to be reasonably lenient. I've<br />
Just been made aware of this issue. I'll talk about it<br />
at the appropriate time with the Minister, Senator Evans.<br />
On the face of: it it does seem rather lenient but I would<br />
want to know all the circumstances.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Sure. On the face a~ i~ it wasn't very acceptable<br />
behaviour. I'm not trying to defend it in any way.<br />
JOURNALIST: M~ r Hawke, the Charles Blunt postage problem. </p>
<p>Do you regret stirring up that hornets nest?<br />
PM Do I regret stirring it up? No, I've no problemf but<br />
I bet Charlie does.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you expect it to go as far as it has now<br />
with allegations of-<br />
PM: I'm an innocent in these sort of things. I mean I<br />
just had a question asked of me there in Question Time.<br />
I mean there must be a did they ask that question?<br />
They did and so I discharged my obligations of having the<br />
information obtained and up it comas $ 278,000. A lot<br />
of licks.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, will you be having any more<br />
talks with George Bush in the near future?<br />
PM: It's quite possible. I mean he expressed his<br />
pleasure that I'd rung him and that we'd had the<br />
opportunity of conversation and he undertook that we'd be<br />
staying in contact. Now whether that means any more<br />
phone calls in the near future or handling it through our<br />
diplomatic representatives but we are going to stay<br />
closely in touich on the issue. It's very important for<br />
Australia's farmers that we do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Charles Blunt.<br />
Is there any or any ground for legal action or<br />
recovery of those monies that..<br />
PM: I don't know. I haven't involved myself in that<br />
matter. That's something for the relevant Ministers and<br />
Departments. I haven't intervened in that at all.<br />
ends </p>
