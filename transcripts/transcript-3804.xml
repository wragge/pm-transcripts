AUSTRALIAN ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF ILO<br />

The Prime Minist * er, Mr Gough Whitlam, announced today<br />
that Dr P. B. Cook, O-BE, Australian Ambassador and Special<br />
Labour Adviser in Europe and head of Australia's delegation<br />
to the recent Conference of the International Labour<br />
Organisation in Geneva, had been elected as Chairman of the<br />
* Governing Body of the ILO for 1975-76.<br />
Mr Whitlam said " although Australia has been a<br />
foundation member of the ILO since 19* 19 and has been represented<br />
on the Governing Body for most of the past 30 years, this is<br />
the first time that an Australian has been accorded the high<br />
honour of the Chairmanship."<br />
" Over the years Australia has taken an increasingly<br />
active and responsible role in ILO affairs, particularly in<br />
the Asian region", Mr Whitlam said. " My Government has moreover<br />
taken vigorous steps to apply international labour standards<br />
in Australia. It has ratified ILO Conventions dealing with<br />
equal pay, trade union rights and elimination of discrimination<br />
in employment, thereby ensuring Australian accord with all<br />
ILO Conventions in the field of fundamental human rights,<br />
Australia's record, some 42 ratifications in all, compares<br />
favourably with that of other federal states."<br />
The ILO is the senior specialised agency of the<br />
United Nations. It see ' ks to improve the conditions of work<br />
and the general welfare of workers in its 126 Menmber States<br />
throughout the world, operating largely through consultation<br />
and collaboration between governments, employers and workers.<br />
The Governing Body of the ILO is instrumental in<br />
determining the direction and priorities of the ILO's<br />
activities. The Chairman's duties obviously call for considerable<br />
understanding and expertise in regard to the labour and related<br />
social problems that confront both developed and developing<br />
countries. Dr Cook, a former permanent head of the Department<br />
of Labour, has held various important offices in the ILO in<br />
recent years, . serving with distinction as Chairman of a number<br />
of ILO Committees. A biographical note is attached.<br />
