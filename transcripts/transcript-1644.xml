FOR PRESS: 31 AUG1967 FM. No. 25/ lc7<br />
REVIE.. COF STRIP T3GY IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Affairs and<br />
Defence today continued : ts comprehensive review of Australia's future<br />
policy and strategic role " n South-East Asia.<br />
The main elements of the review are the ' mplicati ons<br />
for Australian defence policy of the British plans for withdrawal from<br />
East of Suez and the Australian contribution in Viet Nam.<br />
Today's discussions were of a preliminary nature<br />
and did not nvolve the taking of any specific decisions. The implications<br />
of the British decision require a fundamental reappraisal of our role<br />
in South-East Asia. They are extremely complex and will require<br />
considerable time to work out. As well as studying these for ourselves,<br />
we intend to talk to other governments about them.<br />
There are certain short-term aspects arising from<br />
Britain's plans. These are mainly of a logistic or other technical nature,<br />
and have already been under discussion at the Service level. But the main<br />
implications are longer term.<br />
A number of more immediate matters were also<br />
reviewed today, including the state of the Vietnam war, which remains the<br />
most immediate and urgent defence preoccupation of the Government.<br />
The meeting considered the assessments given by the American envoys,<br />
Mr Clark Clifford and General Taylor.<br />
Present at today's meeting were members of the<br />
Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Service Ministers and<br />
the Defence Committee. Other meetings will1 be held as necessary.<br />
CANBERRA, August, 19c7.<br />
