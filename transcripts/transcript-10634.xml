    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, the Government is absolutely delighted that the Parliament</p>
<p>   has passed the private health insurance legislation. It's a</p>
<p>   huge boon to Australian families. Hundreds of thousands of Australian</p>
<p>   families will now take the decision to stay in private health insurance</p>
<p>   or to take it out because from the 1st of January it's</p>
<p>   going to be 30% cheaper right across the board. I thank the two</p>
<p>   Independent Senators, Brian Harradine and Mal Colston, for their</p>
<p>   supporting the Government. I know that each of them in different</p>
<p>   ways had reservations, but in the end they supported the Government</p>
<p>   and that made it possible for the legislation to go through and</p>
<p>   I record the Government's thanks to both of them.</p>
<p>The legislation in its final form is an improvement on what the</p>
<p>   Government put up. The proposals that Senator Harradine put forward</p>
<p>   add value to the legislation. They do impose a pressure on the private</p>
<p>   health funds to get rid of the gaps, which are unpopular with contributors,</p>
<p>   and overall it's a win-win outcome because the full integrity</p>
<p>   of the Government's proposal has been maintained. There is</p>
<p>   no means test so that we have the maximum opportunity to increase</p>
<p>   private health insurance numbers and on top of that, as a result</p>
<p>   of Senator Harradine's amendment, there's something of</p>
<p>   value added that will put pressure on the funds to get rid of the</p>
<p>   gaps.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How confident are you that the funds will eliminate gaps with the</p>
<p>   only incentive being that they won't be able to advertise discount</p>
<p>   premiums?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they won't be able to advertise the discount premiums</p>
<p>   and they won't be able to get a direct subsidy from the Government</p>
<p>   to reduce the premium, the contributor will need to get it off his</p>
<p>   tax or get a cash payment from the Government. That will impose</p>
<p>   quite a competitive pressure and I believe that there will be very</p>
<p>   significant competitive pressure on the funds. I believe the measure</p>
<p>   will have the co-operation of the medical profession that was indicated</p>
<p>   to us by the Australian Medical Association representatives yesterday.</p>
<p>   The fund association supports it. Overall it will create a lot of</p>
<p>   pressure on funds to progressively get rid of the gaps and that</p>
<p>   can only be further good news for those who take out private health</p>
<p>   insurance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How quickly do you think they'll act?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they have 18 months to get ready and I think the pressure</p>
<p>   is on now. It's on now that the legislation has been passed.</p>
<p>   People will be saying to their funds: are you going to do this?</p>
<p>   And whenever that starts to happen you get competitive pressure</p>
<p>   building.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>For those funds that don't comply with that requirement members</p>
<p>   will still be able to get the rebate, won't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course. We've never said for a moment that we would ever</p>
<p>   deny the rebate to anybody who's got private health insurance.</p>
<p>   That's been the cornerstone of our policy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does this give you more confidence that you'll get the GST</p>
<p>   package through the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Louise, I take one measure at a time. I was very satisfied with</p>
<p>   the outcome of yesterday's discussions. I'm very grateful</p>
<p>   for the support that the two Independents have given to the Government</p>
<p>   but I don't take anything for granted. We go to Christmas having</p>
<p>   delivered on a major promise. Next year with the legislation in</p>
<p>   the Senate we come back to the GST. We begin the long committee</p>
<p>   inquiry process and at the end of that we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>   But I'm not making any extravagant claims. I have never taken</p>
<p>   either Brian Harradine or Mal Colston for granted, nor should I.</p>
<p>   They are not members of the Coalition parties, they are independent</p>
<p>   men and we will deal with their concerns as they come along against</p>
<p>   the background, of course, of sticking to the essential elements</p>
<p>   of the policy that we put forward at the last election for which</p>
<p>   we clearly have the authority of the Australian people to legislate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you got any small thoughts on just when a referendum on the</p>
<p>   republic might be held last year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will be held, I imagine, towards the end of next year</p>
<p>   but I'm not really giving that issue a great deal of thought.</p>
<p>   It's something into the future. We said we'd have a referendum</p>
<p>   and we're going to keep our word. But I don't find, as</p>
<p>   I go around Australia, people stopping me in the streets and shaking</p>
<p>   their fist and saying, we want a republic or we don't want</p>
<p>   a republic. I don't really get many people getting worked up</p>
<p>   either way on the subject. And it's not really at the top of</p>
<p>   people's minds. On that subject can I wish Mark Taylor and</p>
<p>   the Australian Cricket Team the very best of good luck in the third</p>
<p>   test that is starting in Adelaide today. The Australian cricket</p>
<p>   loving population is behind Mark and the Team. We wish them well</p>
<p>   against the old enemy and I know millions of other Australians will</p>
<p>   be following the game very closely.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Should there be an inquiry into the bookmaker scandal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, that is a matter entirely for the Australian Cricket Board.</p>
<p>   Suggestions that the Senate or some section of government should</p>
<p>   get involved are quite ridiculous. It's a matter for the Australian</p>
<p>   Cricket Board.</p>
