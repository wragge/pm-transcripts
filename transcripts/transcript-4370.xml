4AUST HA LI A<br />
PRIME MINISTER 19 April 1977<br />
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT<br />
AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL<br />
I seek leave to make a statement concerning the<br />
Government's arrangements for receiving independent advice<br />
on science and technology.<br />
Science and technology have played an important part<br />
in Australia's development, and if properly encouraged, they may<br />
be expected to be even more important for Australia's future.<br />
They are basic to our capacity to meet the challenges presented<br />
by issues such as energy and resource availability, industrial<br />
productivity and competitiveness, urbanisation, and the man~ agement<br />
of the environment. To ensure that our valuable but limited scientific and<br />
technological resources are applied most effectively to<br />
Australia's problems, an integrated effort is needed. Advi-' sory<br />
machinery of -the highest quality is essential if the Government is<br />
to make the right decisions. The Government must be able to. draw<br />
on t* ae best available advice if it is to formulate clear objectives,<br />
establish the most effective and appropriate institutional means<br />
for achievinrg them, and assign priorities on a rational and<br />
considered basis.<br />
Mr Speaker, science policy advisory machinery was first<br />
established by a Liberal Country Party Government in Australia.<br />
In A: ril 1972, the then Prime Minister, the Right Honourable the<br />
MemLer for Lowe, announced the formation of the Advisory<br />
Committee on Science and Technology. This reflected the importance<br />
the Coalition Parties attached to having expert and co-ordinated<br />
advice on policies for science and technology. As Honourable<br />
/ 2 __ 7 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Members may recall, I was the responsible Minister when this<br />
original Advisory Committee was established in 1972.<br />
The Committee was disbanded in February 1973. It was<br />
not replaced for some years not until mid-1975 when an Interim<br />
Australian Science and Technology Council was set up pending the<br />
passage of legislation.<br />
Soon after the. 1975 election, a small and highly qualified<br />
Advisory Group was formed to advise me on the role of a permanent<br />
science and technology council. Having considered the Advisory<br />
Group's report, I announced that the Interim Australian Science<br />
and Technology Council would continue, but with some changed<br />
membership and f'unctions.<br />
As the Advisory Group recommended, the reconstituted<br />
Interim Council was asked to report to the Government on long<br />
term arrangements for an independent science and technology<br />
advisory body. The Interim Council consulted widely and considered a<br />
large number of submissions which substantially represented<br />
scientific and technological opinion in Australia. The Council's<br />
Report, presented in November 1976, indicated that there was<br />
widespread suipport for the creation of a permanent and independent<br />
science and technology council.<br />
The Government has accepted the Interim Council's<br />
recommendation that the Australian Science and Technology Council<br />
be established as a permanent and independent body. As it is of<br />
great importance that ASTEC not only be independent, but that it<br />
be seen to be independent, the Government intends to establish<br />
ASTEC as a statutory body.<br />
The establishment of an independent science and<br />
technology policy advisory council'on a permanent basis is a<br />
significant advance. The history of science bodies in Australia<br />
has been chequered, and making ASTEC a statutory body will give<br />
the council the status, permanence and stability which it requires.<br />
The functions of ASTEC are to advise the Government on<br />
science and technology, including<br />
the advancement of scientific knowledge and the<br />
development and application of science and technology<br />
in relation to the national well being; o../ 3 </p>
<p>I the adequacy, effectiveness and overall balance<br />
of the national effort in science and technology<br />
in Government, industry, education and other sectors<br />
of the community;<br />
the assessment of gaps and overlaps in science and<br />
technology in Australia;<br />
the identification and support of new ideas of<br />
science and technology likely to be of national<br />
importance;<br />
the practical development and application of research<br />
discoveries and the fostering of technological<br />
innovation in industry; and<br />
o the means of improving efficiency in the use of<br />
resources related to science and technology.<br />
The Council will have a strategic role in assisting the<br />
Governmentto encourage Australian science and technology to meet<br />
. the nation's needs and objectives. It will have no executive<br />
responsibilities but will be able to advise on operational<br />
arrangements. ASTEC's knowledge and analysis of science and technology<br />
will be valuable to many arms of Government. And the Government<br />
expects the Council to inform itself and be informed of relevant<br />
Government policies and to take into consideration economic and<br />
budgetary implications in discharging its functions.<br />
ASTEC will draw on existing Departments and Agencies for<br />
the expertise, knowledge and assistance necessary to enable<br />
these functions to be discharged effectively. But this will in<br />
no way compromise the independence of ASTEC.<br />
Pending the passage of appropriate legislation, ASTEC<br />
has been established by executive action and is now continuing its<br />
important work.. As the Council Report recommended, ASTEC will<br />
repcrt to me, and its secretariat, which will be small in number,<br />
will be attached to my Department.<br />
The Government has agreed that ASTEC should prep-are a<br />
repc. rt on the present state of science and technology in<br />
Australia as recommended by the Interim Council. ASTEC will<br />
prepare this report in parallel with conducting investigations and<br />
providing advice on matters either referred to it by the Government,<br />
or which arise from its own initiatives. </p>
<p>Since the Government will be making decisions on<br />
matters upon which ASTEC will be reporting, the timing of the<br />
release of ASTEC's reports will be for the Minister to decide.<br />
The Government intends that ASTEC's reports siall be made<br />
public unless there are overwhelming reasons in the national<br />
interest for not doing so.<br />
ASTEC will have a part-time Chairman and Deputy<br />
Chairman, and up to thirteen other part-time members. The<br />
Council's membership will have experience and knowledge across<br />
the spectrum of science and technology and its impact on the<br />
community. 1' embers will be selected for their individual<br />
qualities and on the basis of their ability to contribute to<br />
the work of the Council, not as representatives of particular<br />
interest groups. I am pleased -to announce that Professor Geoffrey Badger<br />
has accepted the position of Chairman of ASTEC. Professor Badger<br />
has had a distinguished career as a scientist. After several<br />
years as a Professor of Organic Chemistry, at the University of<br />
Adelaide, he served for a short time as a member of the Executive<br />
of CSIiOO Ho has just completed a ten year term as Vice-<br />
Chancellor of the University of A -1elaide and is now-a Research<br />
Professor in that University. He is the President of the Australian<br />
Academy of Science and the Chairman of its Science and Industry<br />
Forum. Professor Badger has played a significant part in<br />
developing and presenting the case for an independent advisory<br />
council, on science and technology. In 1967, he c'haired a working<br />
party, established by the Science and Industry Forum of the<br />
Academy of Science, to examine the need for science policy<br />
machinery in Australia.. I recall that as Minister for Education<br />
and Science I took part in the discussion of his report at a<br />
subsequent meeting of the Forum. Professor Badger again<br />
stressed the need for an independent science advisory council<br />
in a Presidgntial Paper published by the Academy in 1975.<br />
Another eminent scientist, Professor Sir Rutherford<br />
Robertson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London and Past<br />
President of the Australian Academy of Science, has accepted the<br />
position of Beouty Chairman of the Council. Sir Rutherford is </p>
<p>Director of the Research School of Biological Sciences at<br />
the Australian National University.<br />

take up the task of this important advisory body.<br />
I should also like to place on record -the Government's<br />
appreciation of the work which the Interim Council, chaired by<br />
Sir Louis Matheson, has undertaken in preparing its report.<br />
Sir Louis and the members of the Interim Council have contributed<br />
considerable time and effort. Their advice has greatly assisted<br />
the Government to make decisions on long term arrangements for<br />
obtaining independentL policy advice on science an~ d technology in<br />
Australia. For the information of Honourable Members, I present<br />
the report of -the Interim Australian Science and Technology<br />
Council entitled: " Future Arrangements for an Australian Science<br />
