Jim Waley: In spite of continuing gloom at the state of the<br />
economy, the leading voices of Labor's -federal government were<br />
unusually silent this week, hushed perhaps in the hope that given<br />
the stage to himself, Opposition Leader Andrew Peacock would<br />
fluff his lines during his five day, five state mock election*<br />
campaign. Well, the coalition's dumm~ y run is over, and so is the<br />
government's forbearance. The Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke is in<br />
our Canberra studio this morning. Here to talk with him again are<br />
Laurie Oakes and political analyst Alan Ramsay from the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald. Laurie.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Thanks, Jim. Prime Minister, welcome to the<br />
programme again.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Thank you very. much.'<br />
Laurie Oakes: Before we get onto domestic politics, do you agree<br />
with Sonny Remphal that half a dozen of our top rugby union<br />
players going to South Africa would hurt or jeopardise the<br />
Commonwealth Games?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: It must be on that side of the ledger,<br />
and I sincerely hope that the fellows in question will not accept<br />
the invitation. The simple bottom line is this that they are<br />
being invited to go to a country in which there is dramatic<br />
inequality of opportunity. There is dramatic inequality in the<br />
funds devoted to education, sport and training opportunities for<br />
non-whites. In the end the simple fact is that you can't have </p>
<p>equal sport in an unequal society, and I hope that our fellows<br />
whose rugby playing capacities I admire enormously, I hope that<br />
they will not make the mistake of giving comfort to a regime<br />
which is still internationally unacceptable.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Are you going to take any action to try and stop<br />
them going?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, two weeks ago we contacted the<br />
Rugby Union Board and indicated the government's position on<br />
this, that we hoped very much that they wouldn't go. But as you<br />
know, we have never and will not go to the position of stopping<br />
people's passports. This is a free society. As a government we<br />
try to give a lead as to what should happen in terms of<br />
international relationships, but I trust that the gentlemen in<br />
question will see this in the broader terms. I don't, let me say<br />
this also, I don't doubt the integrity of some of the people<br />
within South Africa, in the cricket field and in the rugby field.<br />
I am sure that there are people whose integrity is beyond<br />
question who would want to see not only equal sport but equal<br />
sport within an equal society. But this is not the way to go<br />
because in fact the situation in that society, in some senses<br />
worse, than its ever been before and they use these attempts to<br />
have international recognition in terms of international sporting<br />
contacts as an argument that they are condoned and accepted. So<br />
I hope, as I said, Laurie, that our blokes will not, even if its<br />
unwittingly, as I imagine it would be and certainly<br />
unintentionally on their part, in fact be giving aid and comfort<br />
to an abhorrent regime.<br />
Laurie Oakes: We've got the British rebel cricket tour which is<br />
on. Alan Border says it could happen with Australian cricketers </p>
<p>because the dollar rules. Isn't the sporting boycott thing<br />
breaking down now?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Oh, I think it's hard to say it's<br />
breaking down. There are certainly cracks in it. I accept that,<br />
but generally speaking they are pariahs in the international<br />
sporting community. I think what we've got to remember is that<br />
there are<br />
Laurie Oakes: Their not really pariahs. We had a couple in our<br />
test team that went to South Africa, and they're back playing<br />
quite happily.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, they've paid a very significant<br />
penalty, and may I say that in respect of one of them you've<br />
got Terry Alderman that penalty has been paid and he's making<br />
a magnificent contribution now. But I think Australian cricketers<br />
generally do understand that they have a commitment beyond<br />
themselves and securing a financial futur'e, which is<br />
understandable. They've got a commitment beyond that as we all<br />
have. I mean, there are so many people who could make financial<br />
advantage out of doing things which are not too proper. You've<br />
got to have other considerations than just financial advancement.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Prime Minister, you're opening tomorrow's<br />
Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Committee Meeting in Canberra.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Yeah.<br />
Alan Ramsay: What's your attitude to tougher sanctions against<br />
South Africa?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, I think the right position, Alan,<br />
is to concentrate on the line of enquiry which I initiated two<br />
years ago at the Commonwealth Heads of Government on the question<br />
of financial sanctions. I think that is the one and certainly </p>
<p>from indications within South Africa that's the one that they're<br />
most worried about. They've got very very big rollovers coming<br />
and there are indications that there's going to be a tougher<br />
attitude towards them. The governor of the reserve bank in South<br />
Africa and the Minister of Finance have already indicated that<br />
existing sanctions have had a very very adverse impact upon them.<br />
Now I would think that the biggest opportunities are in the area<br />
of financial sanctions, but, Alan, can I make this point. I<br />
think you know it, but I think it's important that viewers know<br />
it. Neither I nor my government have any interest in sanctions<br />
as such. I mean, I abhor the necessity for sanctions. Sanctions<br />
are not an end in themselves. They are instrument to try and<br />
bring the South African government to the negotiating table. And<br />
I wish they would come to the table so we could forget all talk<br />
of any sanctions.<br />
Alan Ramsay: You talk about financial sanctions. What about<br />
trade sanctions?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, I think the trade sanctions that<br />
are there should be kept on. It's a pity that non-Commonwealth<br />
countries are not giving the same sort of strength of support as<br />
has been given by those within the Commonwealth. But there is no<br />
doubt that they have had the adverse impact. There's no point in<br />
relying on my judgement, Alan. As I say, there is the published<br />
statements just a few months ago of the governor of the reserve<br />
bank in South Africa and the Minister for Finance of the very<br />
significant, tough and adverse impact that the sanctions have had<br />
on South Africa. That's their own assessment.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Prime Minister, before we go to domestic issues,<br />
Paul Keating brings down his seventh budget just in, what, nine </p>
<p>days time. How do, can the Australian people expect him to be<br />
any more correct this time than he was with his forecast last<br />
year of which some of them were hopelessly wrong.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, I, that's a fair comment and<br />
question, Alan, but I think you need to make this point and put<br />
it in this context. Paul and the government were not Robinson<br />
Crusoe. Every perfectional public and private economist in<br />
Australia underestimated the level of demand at that time. He<br />
wasn't one ( phonetic) out. Now the governor of the Reserve Bank,<br />
Bob Johnson, has indicated that they were wrong. We were wrong<br />
O in underestimating the strength of demand. Well, that's the<br />
nature of economics. We will do our very best to make sure that<br />
the budget is premised on the best assessment we can possibly<br />
make. And I think if you look at the whole period since 1983<br />
we've done a fairly good job in getting it right.<br />
Alan Ramsay: But it's going to be a budget, presumably the last<br />
one before the next election. And I say presumably.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Yeah, presumably, Alan.<br />
Alan Ramsay: People can, shouldn't people be cynical about it<br />
S simply because of this aspect of it?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: No, no, I mean cynicism is much more a<br />
monopoly or preserve of the media as you know, Alan. But I think<br />
you're fair enough, Alan, to say, alright, there was an<br />
underestimate of demand last time but I believe that the evidence<br />
is there that the policies that have been tuned since the budget,<br />
I mean a budget is a year ago by definition. We've had the April<br />
statement since then which has been a made a massive<br />
adjustment, further very significant reductions in the public<br />
outlay side involving the states and the commonwealth, a further </p>
<p>reduction of the public sector borrowing requirement. You've seen<br />
the relevant fine tuning since August and that has been the mark<br />
of this government, Alan, that we have made the adjustments as<br />
you go along which are necessary. And we've got at the present<br />
time the very tight policy to bring down that level of demand<br />
which you rightly say was to some extend underestimated a year<br />
ago. Alan Ramsay: Prime Minister, without asking you to give away<br />
any deep secrets, its obvious now that there's going to be a very<br />
very big surplus in the budget that Paul Keating will bring down<br />
O seven or eight billion dollars. Won't that give you scope for<br />
new tax cuts down the track? Perhaps early next year?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, by definition if you've got, what<br />
we've done as distinct from the Opposition, if you have created<br />
a very substantial surplus by being very very efficient in<br />
bringing down the levels of public outlays' as well as<br />
rationalising your tax system, that gives you a position in which<br />
you would be able to fund tax cuts as distinct from the unfunded<br />
proposals that have been floating around from this undisciplined<br />
S Opposition for some time now. Now, judgements would have to be<br />
made as to what was the appropriate way of using that surplus.<br />
Now it is true that one option would be in terms of overall<br />
macroeconomic judgement if you wanted to try and secure a lesser<br />
wages outcome, you could look at the question of a wages tax<br />
trade off. Now that's obviously a possibility in that situation.<br />
You would have to weigh that against what could be achieved by<br />
using that surplus for other purposes in terms of retiring debt.<br />
But that is obviously a theoretical possibility. What we would<br />
have to do, what any sensible government and that's what we are, </p>
<p>what any sensible government has to do in the circumstances<br />
confronting us right now, what's the best decision in terms of<br />
economic outcome.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Well, putting theory aside for a second, what<br />
would be your wish? Would you hope to be able to cut taxes<br />
further? Prime Minister Hawke: Oh, we have taken the view that if you<br />
can do that equitably, then you would examine the need for<br />
further tax cuts. But the thing that distinguishes us . from the<br />
Opposition is that we have done it on a funded basis. We've made<br />
O the tough decisions. First, create your position where you can<br />
fund your tax cut, and that's what characterises us and what<br />
distinguishes us from the Opposition. You go back to 1987. They<br />
hadn't done the work, they just made the promises. They're doing<br />
the same thing again now. I mean, how long do we have to wait<br />
before they'll get to the position of saying where' the cuts are.<br />
Where have they expenditure ( sic) cuts which will fund their tax<br />
promises. Alan Ramsay: Prime Minister, Andrew Peacock even concedes now<br />
S that interest rates might fall before the end of the year. How<br />
far do you think they've got to fall before voters are prepared<br />
to forgive and forget.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, I don't know the answer to that<br />
question, Alan. I think the important thing as I read the<br />
political situation now, Alan, is that, I don't know whether you<br />
blokes would agree or not, I think there is an emerging greater<br />
understanding in the Australian electorate that we haven't been<br />
caprices about the question of tight monetary policy, that there<br />
are reasons and valid reasons for having the high levels of </p>
<p>interest to reduce demand. There's a greater degree of<br />
acceptance. They don't like it, I mean I'm not being silly about<br />
that, of course they don't like it. I think what they will want<br />
to see out there are interest rates coming down and consistent<br />
with that the application of the other arms of policy which will<br />
keep the economy growing and keep employment growing. If you have<br />
that consistency of factors, that is, the growth that's<br />
characterised our six and a half years in government, the economy<br />
growing, employment increasing and interest rates coming down in<br />
that environment, I think that's the sort of mix that the<br />
S Australian electorate will both want and, may I say, are entitled<br />
to expect.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Prime Minister, we'll take a break there and will<br />
be back in just a moment Welcome back. Prime Minister,<br />
interest rates coming down by the end of this year. The<br />
announcement of tax cuts early next year, that sounds the kind<br />
of scenario you need to win the election, doesn't it?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, just let me make the point, you<br />
were talking about interest rates coming down by the end of the<br />
S year. You remember Alan said that that's what Mr. Peacock said.<br />
Now, I certainly hope that's the situation. I'm not making any<br />
forecasts. I hope that's the situation. And your question went<br />
from that scenario for an election early next year. I've got<br />
really nothing to say, Laurie, beyond what I've said all along<br />
that I thought that this parliament would go its full term and<br />
that tended to mean an election by the middle of next year.<br />
Alan Ramsay: But surely, Prime Minister, you've got to get<br />
interest rates down for the government to have a realistic chance<br />
of winning next time. </p>
<p>Alan Ramsay: Oh, obviously, Alan, our chances of winning are<br />
the election are very significantly improved by interest rates<br />
coming down, but the point is that we are not mugs. We have not<br />
pushed interest rates up because we like to get some art form<br />
masochism, or sadism, and hurting people. They've been there for<br />
a necessary purpose. Now once that purpose is achieved, and you<br />
can be sure that the level of activity is coming to sustainable<br />
levels, then your interest rates will come down. The policy will<br />
be eased. Now the fact that we've got to have an election<br />
sometime, OK, that's a fact there, but demonstrably over that<br />
period we've made the economic decisions that have been necessary<br />
for the time. I mean, you remember, Alan, before the 1987<br />
election, I was told by virtually everyone that the economic<br />
decisions I was taking then were a recipe for economic disaster.<br />
Well, I just think that the electorate is somewhat more<br />
sophisticated, and I think you'd agree, now than it was before.<br />
Having said all that, obviously I want interest rates down and<br />
down for some time before the election.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Mr. Hawke, I realise that you're under some<br />
constraints in talking about the budget, but I guess you can talk<br />
in general terms.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Alright, let's have a try.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Well, how much embroidery are we going to see in<br />
the budget.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, embroidery I suppose, can be in the<br />
eye of the beholder, like beauty. No, we will have a budget, I<br />
can tell you this, we will have a budget which in my judgement<br />
now will both be economically relevant and I think also<br />
acceptable. Sometimes what's economically relevant is not too </p>
<p>acceptable. But I think this will be a well received budget<br />
because it will have that mix of responsibility and toughness but<br />
one which is also going to be addressing fundamental questions<br />
about this Australian society and economy now and into the<br />
future. Laurie Oakes: How much will be there to perhaps please the<br />
battling home buyers. Have they got any hope at all of relief?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Oh, Laurie, I can't go into those things.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Luxury tax?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Can't go into that, Laurie/<br />
O Alan Ramsay: Can we try another one? What about the elderly<br />
people in the community? I mean, over the years you've alienated<br />
to some extent pensioners, particularly assets test and that sort<br />
of thing. Do you think this one will get them back on side?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, Alan, I'm not going to dodge your<br />
question. I'll say something about it, but could I'just go to the<br />
premise of your question first. I don't accept that we have<br />
alienated elderly people generally. I think that there are some<br />
we have, certainly with regard to the assets test we would have<br />
S alienated the millionaires and the people who were getting the<br />
pension before. But I think generally speaking there's now the<br />
acceptance of the correctness of that decision. And I ask you to<br />
remember this. Remember the fever pitch of hysteria of your<br />
Peacocks and your Howards and your Opposition when we brought it<br />
in. This was the end of the world as we knew it. What's the<br />
position now? They have basically embraced the concept of the<br />
assets test in regard to the pension, so I don't accept<br />
altogether your premise. But now going to the question; I can say<br />
this, without going into details, that the budget speech and the </p>
<p>associated budget papers will have a considerable relevance for<br />
the aged.<br />
Laurie Oakes: You've shown great forbearance, said nothing all<br />
week about Andrew Peacock's mock election campaign. What's your<br />
verdict? Prime Minister Hawke: Well, let me say, basically its been a<br />
silence that's arisen from the fact that I've had my head down<br />
and my bottom up in the cabinet room working on finalising the<br />
budget. I mean, that's, we've been working, he's been mocking.<br />
Now, as far as the campaign is concerned, I'm not here to knock<br />
O Andrew Peacock. If they want to make the decision that that's a<br />
thing that they should do, OK. It doesn't seem to me to have been<br />
terribly impressive, and particularly, Laurie, when you remember<br />
this. He started off on day one with the great initiative about<br />
the inflation adjustment.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Sounded a pretty good one.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Ay?<br />
Laurie Oakes: Sounded a pretty good one.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: But where is it now, mate. It's like<br />
S wrestling with a column of smoke. I mean, what is it that you're<br />
applying to. I mean, first of all, just look at what, for<br />
instance has been said in the Friday, the week-end press. I mean,<br />
it's quite clear, without being unfair, I don't want to be, to<br />
knock Andrew in personal terms, but it's the unanimous opinion<br />
that he doesn't understand. He personally doesn't understand what<br />
was put. I mean, Milton Cobeman ( phonetic) said there on Friday<br />
that an economically literate radio interviewer with half an hour<br />
to spare would tear him apart, and so it's something that the<br />
Leader doesn't understand. We don't know whether it's a policy </p>
<p>or a proposal they're thinking about. Certainly Senator Stone has<br />
poured the great buckets of cold water on it, and there's<br />
disagreement between them, as between Hewsen and Peacock as to<br />
what goes in it.<br />
Laurie Oakes: But what's wrong with the idea in principle, Prime<br />
Minister? Why don't you do something similar?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Okay, let me just go to it in some<br />
respects. First of all, let me say it would be an administrative<br />
nightmare and it would have the potential, the capacity, to<br />
totally disrupt the economy. I mean, secondly, what flows from<br />
that, wthat's required in the community is an increase in savings.<br />
That i an increase in production relative to consumption. But<br />
what d, ! s this proposal involve? It involves a tax break for<br />
passive income and a very significant penalty for those who<br />
invest, for those who invest in productive assets. Next point,<br />
we are part of an integrated world economy. How ' couid we possibly<br />
inflation adjust when nowhere else in the OECD has done it. Next<br />
point, and this is not exhaustive but let's just consider the<br />
next point, how can you partially adjust part of the system?<br />
you adjust for interest rates but not for the depreciation of<br />
assets... Next point, I mean, as far as you can follow from what<br />
he says, he'd inflation adjust for new loans only. Now, just<br />
consider the implications of that. How do you differentiate<br />
between old debt and new debt? How do you deal with roll-overs.<br />
It would be a massive disincentive for people to put away<br />
outmoded financial arrangements and move to new ones. And, look<br />
at it on the other side, if that's what he's going to say, only<br />
allow inflation adjustment for new debts, on the other side only<br />
have inflation adjustment for new deposits, so what do people do </p>
<p>then? They just redeposit. Or if they don't, it's one-sided, and<br />
therefore its massively expensive. I mean, you've asked me for<br />
I can go on, do you want some more?<br />
Alan Ramsay: We're getting the impression you don't like it,<br />
anyway. Prime Minister Hawke: Well, no, look, it's like a lot of things<br />
in life and in politics and in economics, an idea which sounds<br />
alright, but it is full of conceptual difficulties,<br />
administrative nightmares and counterproductive economic.... I'l<br />
tell you what, and you know I'm not bad, I haven't got a bad<br />
record in predicting what happens on the other side of<br />
politics. I'll tell you now, mark my words, they will not go into<br />
the next election with this proposal.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Prime Minister, bottom line. Why does the<br />
government allow big businesses to be subsidised by ordinary taxpayers<br />
on their borrowings, particularly only just for takeovers.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, its not just a question for takeovers.<br />
Now we've had this<br />
Alan Ramsay: But often, often just for take-overs.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: No, just lets go back to this business.<br />
We've had this line running around now for two or three years<br />
about the way in which the result of the combination of what's<br />
allowed for interest and the taxation arrangements that companies<br />
don't pay their tax. Now, there are these points to be made. That<br />
argument has been blown out of the water in detailed terms by the<br />
papers distributed by Paul, by Paul Keating. It's shown to be not<br />
true. Secondly, there is no government, Alan, and I think you'll<br />
recognise this, there is no government that's done more than this </p>
<p>government to massively improve the equity of the tax burden in<br />
this country. The companies, previously, were able to avoid an<br />
enormous amount of tax responsibilities, and not now. Why is it<br />
that the companies of Australia are now screaming out against<br />
this government and against our tax commissioner for the<br />
increased auditing of companies. For the first time now under<br />
this government the screws are being put on Australian companies.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Prime Minister, if I could interrupt, I think<br />
you've made your point there. We're nearly out of time.<br />
There are two more things I want to raise with you quickly, if<br />
I can.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Right. Fine.<br />
Laurie Oakes: The first thing is the Anzus frigate project. How<br />
do you solve the problem? Bob Carr, the NSW Labor Leader says<br />
that if it goes to Melbourne as the Defence Department then<br />
you'll be slammed by the NSW Labor Party<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Well, I made the point to the NSW<br />
delegation when they came to see me that, and including the<br />
Premier, I said, I seem to recall that when I had to make a<br />
decision within NSW in terms of the third runway at Kingsford-<br />
Smith or going out to Badgery's Creek, he pleaded with me to<br />
make the economically rational decision, and with a wry grin I<br />
conceded yes, they had me to do that. I said, we will make the<br />
economically rational decision in this one<br />
Laurie Oakes: Will politics play a part there?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: No, I must say that the Australian<br />
newspaper had that all nicely wrong. It was almost to the point<br />
of having to see my lawyer. And what I'm saying, and what they<br />
know that I said to them, is that I will not allow political </p>
<p>considerations to determine this decision. Let me be quite<br />
honest. Obviously, from my point of view and for the government's<br />
point of view the easiest decision would be to say, look, we<br />
won't even go through a process of analysis of what's been done<br />
by the Defence Department, it will go to Newcastle. It would be<br />
politically better for this to go to Newcastle. And in that<br />
sense, all things being equal, I'd like it to go to Newcastle.<br />
But, I'm going to have in the cabinet the considerations put<br />
before me, and if on those considerations it is appropriate for<br />
it to go to Newcastle I" 11 be happy.<br />
0 Laurie Oakes: The final issue I want to raise<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: But if it's clear, if it's clear it<br />
should go the other way, that's where it'll go.<br />
Laurie Oakes: The final I want to raise Andrew Peacock has<br />
challenged you to a debate. The question is, are you game to<br />
debate him, and if we arrange the debate here bn the Sunday<br />
Programme next month, will you take part?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Now, look, to be made. I will<br />
consider a debate against the Leader of the Opposition in the<br />
period before the next election. I'm becoming increasingly<br />
sceptical in my mind as to whether it's going to be Andrew<br />
Peacock who'll be in that position. But I'll consider it at the<br />
appropriate time.<br />
Laurie Oakes: You won't be in it next month?<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Oh, next month is probably a bit early.<br />
But I'll, I'm not worried about Andrew. Just let me say this to<br />
Andrew as I've said to other people, " don't make a mistake in<br />
terms of thinking about 1990 in terms of 1984." They are full of<br />
mistakes, the Libs, that would be another one. </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes: Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: Thank you very much.<br />
Laurie Oakes: Back to you, Jim.<br />
Jim Waley: The Prime Minister talking there with Sunday's Laurie<br />
