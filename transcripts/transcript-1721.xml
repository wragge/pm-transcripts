S" S PM. No. 122/ 1967<br />
DEWLUATION CF POUND STERLING<br />
Statement by the Frime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Cabinet has considered the situation created by<br />
the British Government's announcement of the devaluation of the Found<br />
Sterling by 14. 3 per cent. It has decided that there shall be no change<br />
made in the currency value of the Australian Dollar.<br />
The decision has been taken after considering the<br />
views of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank and<br />
of senior Government officials.<br />
Cabinet recognised that the effects of this decision<br />
w: ill fall unevenly on the Australian economy as come industries,<br />
particularly some primary industries, are more closely linked with the<br />
British market than others. These difficulties, some of them critical,<br />
are now under urgent examination to find appropriate ways and means<br />
of overcoming the problems.<br />
