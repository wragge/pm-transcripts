CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH<br />
MELBOURNE 4 APRIL 1989<br />
This is an important day for Australia.<br />
It is the day that marks the beginning of an innovative and<br />
vital campaign of community education education to break<br />
the silence surrounding the scourge of domestic violence.<br />
Domestic violence is a widespread and a deep-rooted problem<br />
in the Australian community.<br />
Thousands of Australian women and children are suffering<br />
physical and mental hurt within their homes through verbal<br />
abuse, threats, harrasment, bullying and bashing.<br />
Yet, too often, fear and misplaced shame are preventing<br />
those victims from breaking the silence on which this<br />
repugnant form of violence thrives.<br />
And too often the rest of the community has stood quietly to<br />
one side while this violence is perpetrated turning a<br />
blind eye and a deaf ear to violence in the home that would<br />
not be tolerated if it was brought out into the open.<br />
The time has come for the Australian community to say enough<br />
is enough.<br />
We must break the silence.<br />
The Federal Government believes that domestic violence must<br />
be seen for what it is a matter of national concern.<br />
That is why in 1987 we created the National Domestic<br />
Violence Education Program and why as part of that program I<br />
am today declaring this month to be National Domestic<br />
Violence Awareness Month.<br />
I am calling on the people of Australia to join with the<br />
Government in a campaign of education to understand better<br />
what are for many of our fellow Australians the hard facts<br />
of family life.<br />
it's an indication of the hidden nature of domestic violence<br />
that precise statistics about it don't exist. </p>
<p>What evidence we do have is depressing: it is clear that, as<br />
in other similar countries, domestic violence has reached an<br />
appalling extent within the Australian community.<br />
Every day, some 2000 women and children are making use of<br />
women's refuges and shelters most of them fleeing violence<br />
in their home.<br />
They come from prosperous homes and they come from less<br />
well-off homes. They come from all parts of Australia, from<br />
capital cities and from the country.<br />
In a Federal Government survey in 1987, almost half the<br />
respondents said they knew either a victim or a perpetrator<br />
of domestic violence.<br />
The survey also revealed one in five Australians believe the<br />
use of physical force by a man against his wife to be<br />
acceptable in some circumstances.<br />
U. S. research suggests that one quarter of hospital casualty<br />
patients may be victims of domestic violence.<br />
But many such statistics only tell us of those cases of<br />
domestic violence which come to public notice, or are<br />
recognised by doctors and hospitals.<br />
Many of the women who suffer domestic violence keep silent<br />
about their injuries, and therefore hide the violence from<br />
their doctors, from official statistics even from their<br />
friends and relatives.<br />
Equally, the causes of domestic violence are complex.<br />
Researchers believe it may be triggered by stress and<br />
frustration, exacerbated by alcohol, and based perhaps on a<br />
deep-seated inability of some people to resolve without<br />
violence the difficulties that occur in their relationships.<br />
But behind all this there is the unassailable fact that as a<br />
community we are all too accustomed to condoning domestic<br />
violence all too ready to avoid the uncomfortable<br />
questions that may expose violence within the home.<br />
This campaign seeks at least to start the process of<br />
reversing those attitudes.<br />
I take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the<br />
absolutely vital work that has been performed over many<br />
years by women's refuges and shelters.<br />
Throughout our suburbs and towns, refuges and shelters are<br />
providing women with the means to escape violence at home<br />
and to build a new life.<br />
As Prime Minister I want to recognise and express my respect<br />
for the invaluable support and assistance rendered to<br />
victims of domestic violence by the dedicated people,<br />
including many volunteers, who run these refuges and<br />
shelters. </p>
<p>Australia was the first country to provide national<br />
Government funding for refuges and we still have in<br />
international terms a proud record of support for this<br />
important work.<br />
In this month devoted to increasing awareness of domestic<br />
violence, the Federal Government will sponsor a media<br />
campaign; we have prepared posters, pamphlets, and a<br />
discussion kit; and a video on domestic violence, which has<br />
already been shown on SBS, is available for groups to<br />
borrow. The support we have received for the program from. so many<br />
areas of the Australian community is indicated by the range<br />
of distinguished guests here today. Our efforts have been<br />
constructively assisted by State and Territory Governments.<br />
I acknowledge, particularly, the role of the<br />
Commonwealth/ State Task Force which co-ordinates the<br />
program.<br />
Our project also has the support of Local Government, the<br />
churches, the trade union movement, the medical, nursing and<br />
legal professions and members of police forces. I welcome<br />
guests from all those areas.<br />
I also welcome the presence and participation of a wide<br />
variety of community groups who will play an active part in<br />
the Awareness Month. Among hundreds of local initiatives,<br />
51 community groups across Australia will be carrying out<br />
projects funded by grants from the national program during<br />
April. If anyone needed an example of why this is an important<br />
campaign, they should listen, as we have just done, to Lola<br />
McCarg. She has told us at first hand about the devastating<br />
experience of just one of the thousands of women who<br />
experience violence in their own homes.<br />
Her words are the courageous words of a survivor, and they<br />
are words of frankness and generosity. In speaking out<br />
about her personal experiences to remind us that women can<br />
do something about domestic violence instead of suffering it<br />
in silence, Lola McCarg has made a very fitting start to<br />
this campaign of breaking the silence.<br />
Now is the time to break the silence which has shrouded<br />
domestic violence.<br />
It's up to all of us not least the men to realise and to<br />
state that domestic violence is just not acceptable.<br />
Put at its simplest men should understand that such<br />
behaviour is cowardly it is a sign not of strength but of<br />
weakness. </p>
<p>4.<br />
It's up to neighbours and friends to support and protect any<br />
woman who can be seen to be suffering fear and distress.<br />
It's up to parents and teachers to work against the patterns<br />
which foster the notion that violence is an appropriate way<br />
to express frustration and worry.<br />
It's up to doctors and religious advisers to be alert to the<br />
signs of violence, and to understand the support needed by<br />
women who seek their assistance.<br />
It's up to communities to be alert to violence as a<br />
community problem.<br />
It's up to the media, and other influential groups within<br />
our community, to help break the silence about domestic<br />
violence.<br />
We want an Australia where Lola McCarg and thousands like<br />
her are free of the threat of violence in the home.<br />
It is my hope that this National Awareness month will help<br />
eradicate that threat. </p>
