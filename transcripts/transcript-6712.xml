CHEC1K AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF EXHIBITION<br />
AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF VICTORIA<br />
MELBOURNE 6 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
THE FACE OF THE CENTRE PAPUNYA TULA PAINTINGS 1971-<br />
1984<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS EVENING<br />
TO OPEN THIS WONDERFUL EXHIBITION OF ABORIGINAL ART: THE<br />
FACE OF THE CENTRE PAPUNYA TULA PAINTINGS 1971-1984.<br />
WE NOW RECOGNISE WITH PRIDE THAT ABORIGINAL ART IS PART<br />
OF THE OLDEST CONTINUOUS CULTURE IN THE WORLD. IT IS A<br />
LIVING GROWING CULTURE WHICH CAN BE TRACED BACK OVER<br />
40,000 YEARS. I<br />
OUR RECOGNITION OF THE DYNAMISM OF ABORIGINAL ART, AND<br />
ITS CENTRAL PLACE IN THE EMERGENCE OF A UNIQUE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ARTISTIC TRADITION, WAS NOT ACHIEVED<br />
OVERNIGHT. FOR TOO LONG WHITE PEOPLE SAW AUSTRALIA'S ARTISTIC PLACE<br />
AS BEING LOCATED IN AN ANGLO-EUROPEAN TRADITION, AND WE<br />
WERE MUCH THE POORER FOR THIS NARROWNESS OF VISION.<br />
ABORIGINAL ART WAS SEEN BY SOME AS A QUAINT BUT LARGELY<br />
IRRELEVANT SIDELINE, TO BE TAKEN HOME BY TOURISTS AS A<br />
SOUVENIR OF THEIR VISIT.<br />
OTHERS WERE TOO READY TO CATEGORISE ABORIGINAL ART AS<br />
" PRIMITIVE ART", OR OF INTEREST PREDOMINANTLY AS<br />
ETHNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL, REPRESENTATIVE OF A CULTURE FELT<br />
TO BE FAR FROM THE CONTEMPORARY REALITY OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
SOCIETY. WE SEE NOW THAT SUCH VIEWS WERE VERY WRONG. ABORIGINAL<br />
ART OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY<br />
RECOGNISED AS ONE OF THE MOST DYNAMIC ARTISTIC<br />
TRADITIONS AT WORK TODAY, AND ONE WHICH IS TRULY A<br />
LIVING RESPONSE TO THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION. </p>
<p>2-<br />
THIS IS WELL ILLUSTRATED BY THIS1 EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS<br />
FROM CENTRAL AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS, AS IS POINTED OUT IN<br />
THE MOST INFORMATIVE CATALOGUE PRODUCED BY THE NATIONAL<br />
GALLERY OF VICTORIA.<br />
IN 1971, AT PAPUNYA, AND SUBSEQUENTLY AT PLACES SUCH AS<br />
KINTORE, HAAST BLUFF AND NEW BORE, THESE PAINTERS BEGAN<br />
USING A NEW MEDIUM FOR ART WHICH HAD TRADITIONALLY BEEN<br />
EXECUTED IN NON-DURABLE MATERIALS SUCH AS SAND. BY<br />
USING ACRYLIC PAINTS ON CANVAS OR BOARD THEY HAVE<br />
TRANSFERRED THEIR ART INTO A NEW AND MORE PERMANENT<br />
FORM, WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE COMPLEXITY AND RICHNESS OF<br />
THEIR SUBJECT MATTER.<br />
THESE ARTISTS HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR ART AS A REFLECTION<br />
OF THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE WITH THEIR OWN<br />
COUNTRY, WHILE TAKI1NG UP THE MATERIALS OF THOSE WHO HAVE<br />
TRADITIONALLY VIEWED " THE CENTRE" AS AN ALIEN AND REMOTE<br />
PLACE. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS EXHIBITION PROVIDES<br />
FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS TO EXPAND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE<br />
DIMENSIONS OF ABORIGINAL ART, AND ITS PLACE IN THE<br />
CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIAN ART SCENE.<br />
THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF VICTORIA IS TO BE CONGRATULATED<br />
FOR ITS VISION IN ESTABLISHING THIS NEW GALLERY OF<br />
ABORIGINAL AND OCEANICART, WHICH IS AN EXCITING<br />
DEVELOPMENT IN THE GROWING AWARENESS OF THE RICHNESS AND<br />
DIVERSITY OF ABORIGINAL CULTURE.<br />
IT IS ALSO TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR " A YEAR OF ABORIGINAL<br />
ART", IN WHICH " THE FACE OF THE CENTRE" IS THE SECOND<br />
EXHIBITION.<br />
MAZDA SHOULD ALSO BE CONGRATULATED. IT HAS BEEN A MOST<br />
GENEROUS AND ENTHUSIASTIC SPONSOR.<br />
I SHALL SHORTLY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ANNOUNCING THE<br />
WINNER OF THE FIRST NATIONAL AWARD FOR THE ABORIGINAL<br />
ARTIST OF THE YEAR. THE WINNER HAS BEEN SELECTED BY THE<br />
NATIONAL ABORIGINAL DAY OBSERVANCE COMMITTEE ( NADOC).<br />
THIS AWARD RECOGNISES THE VITAL ROLE OF ABORIGINAL<br />
ARTISTS IN ENSURING THE SURVIVAL OF THEIR CULTURAL<br />
HERITAGE. IT CONSTITUTES SINGULAR RECOGNITION OF<br />
INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS CONTRIBUTION TO THAT HERITAGE.<br />
YOU WOULD ALL BE AWARE THAT NADOC HAS ALSO ORGANISED A<br />
RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA NEXT WEEK TO<br />
MARK NATIONAL ABORIGINES' WEEK.<br />
THIS WEEK HAS A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS. </p>
<p>NATIONAL ABORIGINES' WEEK PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US<br />
ALL TO LEARN ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF ABORIGINAL PEOPLE<br />
IN ALL FIELDS, AND THEIR SUCCESS IN MANAGING THElR OWN<br />
AFFAIRS. I COMMEND IT TO YOU ALL.<br />
IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO DECLARE THIS EXHIBITION OPEN. </p>
