MR. JOHN GORTON ON CIANNEL 7i'TV NETWORK<br />
Interviewer Peter Martin<br />
Recorded on Wednesday 7 October for screenln on Sunia 11 ctober 1970<br />
P r o g r a m m e opens with film segment showing Mr Gorton speaking to well-wishers<br />
outside Parliament House on the day he became Prime Minister 9 january 196F.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, that was more than one thousand days ago now, more than<br />
two and a half years ago. Ncw, looking back on your first weeks of settling<br />
into office, you must have had some expectations about the office what it<br />
meant and some of those expectations, if you are like everyone else, must<br />
have been fairly solidly tested or abandoned pretty quickly. Did you have<br />
ary expectatio-s that got shot to pieces?<br />
PM I don't think I did. I don't think I had firm expectations a;. d therefore no<br />
expectations to be shot to pieces, and indeed, there wasn't much time to arrive<br />
at firm expectations. The first day I was there Harry Lee rang up from<br />
Singapore about problems with the British withdrawal, and then we had a postal<br />
strike and things just seemed to pour in one after the other.<br />
Q. It was a very busy time. You also had in a matter of weeks the beginning<br />
of the Tet offensive. Did you wonder at that time what the hell you had gotten<br />
into?<br />
PM Well I had been in the Cabinet, but I think what struck me most in the first<br />
month or two was the enormous importance everybody seemed to place on every<br />
word that one spoke..... and the interpretations that were put on that word. The<br />
words were taken inside out and interpreted different ways by different people,<br />
which is something I hadn't expected. I guess that is one expectation. And<br />
you mentioned the Tet offensive. At that stage I had made the statement we would<br />
be sending no more troops to Vietnam. That, of course, had been decided by<br />
the Cabinet in the previous Cove rnment. It was known to our allies a: nd everything,<br />
but I was surprised at the surprise with which that was received.<br />
Q. 0-e newspaper wrote when you were elected Leader of the Liberal Party<br />
" Fasten your seat belts, please". Some political corresponde.-ts who have<br />
been here for twenty or thirty years or so tell me that they have never seen such<br />
a tumultuous timae around the Parliament in all their experience. Do you agree<br />
that this has been a stormy and eventful period S 2 </p>
<p>PM Oh, I am sure it has been. It has been stormy and eventful inside the<br />
Parliament, but it has been stormy and eventful in Australia's history, I think,<br />
We reached a stage where from the defence point of view the whole of our<br />
previous concept of our history was changed by Britain's withdrawal. We<br />
reached a period of development where we took a completely new approach in<br />
trying to protect Australian ownership, as far as we could, without stopping the<br />
inflow of overseas capital. There was a completely new kind of approach there.<br />
We had to look again, or suggested we should look again at Commonwealth / State<br />
power relations. And all these matters were things that had just gone along<br />
quietly for years and suddenly they came to a point where there were new facts,<br />
new requirements, new discussions.<br />
Q. They are all things that lead back to you, though. Do you acce; t responsibility<br />
for the fact that it was a stormy period?<br />
PM For everything except Britain's decision to withdraw from the near North:<br />
Q. Your first Cabinet was generally regarded in the Press as something of<br />
a disappointment. The phrase that was being used was " new broom". People<br />
said the new broom hadn't swept clean. You later made considerable changes,<br />
but why didn't you change at first'? Were you overawed by your more senior<br />
Cabinet colleagues?<br />
PM I don't think any of my then more senior Cabinet Ministers who sat with<br />
me in the Cabinet would for a moment think I was overawed. But they were<br />
senior Ministers of considerable standing in the Party and in the cou-try and it<br />
could have been too much of a new broom I won't mention names but there<br />
were a number of senior people and changing them all round straight away I<br />
think could have had more detrimental effects than good ones.<br />
Q. Well, if I may be impudent enought to suggest names because they have<br />
been suggested publicly it was suggested that Mr Hasluck ar: d Mr McMahon<br />
and Mr Fairhall, with their seniority were a little more conservative on many<br />
issues in Cabinet than you were and that they tended to resist the changes you<br />
wanted to introduce. Did you find that frustrating?<br />
PM Well, I vo uld say it was true to say that as a general thing these<br />
gentlemen were more conservative than I was on many matters. Did I find<br />
it frustrating? No, and eventually I think the conservatism tended to be<br />
overcome.<br />
Q. How? 6 / 3 </p>
<p>PM Oh, by force of circumstance, cogency of argument and persuasion and<br />
passage of time you put it how you like.<br />
Q. Now, it's a fairly open secret, T think, that there's not a great deal of love<br />
lost between you and Mr McMahon and between you, and for that matter, Sir Henry<br />
Bolte. Do you find that when people within your own Party disagree with you<br />
that they are harder to get on with than some Opposition members, for example?<br />
PM Well, I suppose that anybody in any Party would find that peo-le within that<br />
Party who disagreed with one were more difficult than people in the CQ; Jposition.<br />
You expect the Cpposition to disagree, but I found Mr McMahon. a very, very<br />
good Foreign Minister and a good Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party.<br />
Q. You didn't mention Treasurer?<br />
PM Well he's now the Foreign Minister.<br />
Q. One of the early storms came with the one of the fairly quiet storms,<br />
I suppose, the appointment of Mr Hewitt as Secretary of the Prime Minister's<br />
Department. This brought up allegations of interference in the Public Service,<br />
and you are quoted on one occasion as saying, " I see every reason why the<br />
Prime Minister ought to be able to appoint somebody in whom he has complete<br />
confidence and with whom he has worked before". Do you regard Plublic Service<br />
neutrality as a bit of a myth say, at the top level?<br />
PM No, I think the good public servants at the top level, or at any other level,<br />
can't be expected not to have their own political beliefs, but can be eg.-ected to<br />
subordinate those political beliefs to carrying out the policy of the Government<br />
of the day. But I don't think that has got much to do with what you have just<br />
quoted. I think the appointment of the Head of any Department ' s within the<br />
province of the Minister running that Department, and it will run much more<br />
smoothly and much better if the two men know each other and can work together<br />
well, than if they don't, and this I think is particularly true in the case of the<br />
Prime Minister's Department. Now I had worked not with Hewitt but when<br />
I was Minister for the Navy he was in the Defence Section of the Treasury and we<br />
had many an argument on that occasion, and then I worked with him when I was<br />
Minister for Education and he was the Head Qf the Universities Commission, and<br />
one knew each other's style of work and it seens to me had co-mon confidence<br />
and that's a good thing to have in any Department.<br />
Q. Do you accept the fact that Mr Hewitt is very often regarded as something<br />
of a bete noire'<br />
PM Well, I have got to accept that a lot of people from time to time, and a<br />
number of people constantly, regard Mr Hewitt as a bete noire. Then I have also<br />
got to accept the fact that that applies to me too. So why shouldn't we work<br />
together </p>
<p>Q. Well can I ask you then you have talked about your relatiopnship with<br />
Mr Hewitt. What about at the Cabinet leveli Now after you had settled in and<br />
you had the first Cabinet, you then introduced a number of other people : who<br />
were associated with what people called the Mu. hroom Club. Do you -find that<br />
you work better at say the Cabinet level with men who are close friends? Would<br />
you rather have that than a situation where some of the people who disagree<br />
with you get right in at the first level of policy"!<br />
PM No, I wouldn't. And what's more I don't see that they are mutually<br />
exclusive. I don't see why a person can't be a-personal friend but have a<br />
completely different view on some matter and put it forcefully. I can'-t see any<br />
reason for any hangover of resentment when that happens, and ideed, it seems<br />
to me that in a way it is essential that it should happen. It would be a bad thing<br />
to have everybody just sitting around just waitin~ g to see what a Prime Minister<br />
wanted and then, saying It would be bad for the Prime Minister and for<br />
the Government and for everybody el-e. And jr. the Cabinet I don't thin-k we have<br />
got anybody who was in any way associated with what has come to be called the<br />
Mushroom Club.<br />
Q. Not yet? 7<br />
PM Well, don't think we have at the moment.<br />
Q. The philosophy of the Liberal Party also seems to have come in for a lot<br />
of testing in your period of office. Apart from the Federalism issue we'll<br />
deal with that later perhaps, the free enterprise plank of your party's -Alatform,<br />
one of its basic tenets now seems to be accepted with perhaps a few more<br />
qualifications than before. For example, you made the MLC decisiorn without<br />
consulting Cabi-net. You also had the Industrieo Development Corporation, the<br />
business surrounding the guidelines for overseas capital generally. Nlow can<br />
you tell us how, for example, the MLC business came about'i<br />
PM Well that came about as a result of our learning that an u-ndiscloced buyer<br />
or buyers were buying up large quantities of NLC shares and putting them in<br />
the names of nominees. Nobody knew who had them and they were continuing this<br />
buying process and it became evident, and I believe factually evident, that unless<br />
some action was taken fairly quickly, a stage could be reached where this buying<br />
up of shares would give whoever was buying up a controlling interest ill the MLC.<br />
And we felt that that was an Au,. stralian company with a great lot of ca. Ital at<br />
its disposal, a lot of premium income, a lot of! other income a-lid that wie wouldn't<br />
want that capital and the investment of it to fall under overseas control. You<br />
wanted to ask me something about that?.,<br />
Q. You were in Western Australia at the time, I think. Was this a question<br />
of getting hurried phone calls? 0 </p>
<p>PM Oh, no, no. We had the papers beforehand. I had to go to Western<br />
Australia, but I had studied it through beforehand and took them with me and<br />
made the decision from there, but it didn't just come up when we were in<br />
Western Australia at all.<br />
Q. On this general question. You have dealt now recently, for example,<br />
with Queensland Mines. You have dealt with MLC business. You have dealt<br />
with ESSO/ BHP. This is what is generally -being termed your economic<br />
nationalism. Wouldn't it be better to lay down set rules that everyore knows<br />
so nominate perhaps certain industries that would be cc-sidered<br />
vital . in the national interest to control locally'<br />
PM I don't think it would. 0 f course, there are some industries which have<br />
been nominated as industries which shouldn't be allowed to fall into overseas<br />
hands television stations and media, newspapers, banking a number of<br />
industries. I don't think you could lay down a statement saying well, mining<br />
mining covers an awfully large field should not be allowed to<br />
fall into overseas hands, nor should you. I'm sorry, I'll start again..... should<br />
not be allowed to fall into overseas hands. Nor could you lay down a rule<br />
saying well, the level of investment from overseas in mining should not be more<br />
than twenty per cent or thirty per cent or forty per cent or whatever you mention,<br />
because there is so much variety in mines. There is so much variety in the<br />
amount of capital required. ESSO/ BHP, for example is a 50/ 50 partnership.<br />
It requires hundreds of millions. Some other mines require far less an amount<br />
and I don't think you could lay down rules which didn't become restrictive<br />
because they were insufficiently flexible.<br />
Q. Aren't you worried, though, about the possible feedback in future if you<br />
make another decision like that, and someone can say, " Well, Gorton's done<br />
that because one of his Liberal Party backers is in that company and he want a<br />
bit of protection," if you do it on an individual company basis.<br />
PM Well if somebody could say that and could in any way advance any evidence<br />
to back it, yes, one would be worried, but I don't think they ever could or<br />
would be able to say that.<br />
Q. You are confident that you can avoid that.....<br />
PM I couldn't avoid somebody saying in the case of a decisicn, " Well,<br />
somebody who supports the Liberal Party is there and that's why the decision<br />
was made, but I am quite sure that in any circumstances of that kind the<br />
reasons for the decision would be such that the vast majority of people vould<br />
see that there were reasons for it, whether they agreed with them or not. a / 6 </p>
<p>Q. Prime Minister, getting down to what might be generally called your style.<br />
Someone said of you once you probably recognise the quote " He's really too<br />
wilful, I think, and obstinate sometimes, rather than strong-minded. I think<br />
he is the sort which learns only from experience." Dr Darling, your previous<br />
Headmaster at Geelong Grammar. Do you accept that as a criticism of you?<br />
PM Well, of course, he wrote that when I was at school and I have had a lot<br />
of experience since then and presumably learnt a lot from that experience I<br />
hope:<br />
Q. Well one of those o ences has been suggested as maybe reflecting that.<br />
It was the off-shore one 1t? Off-Shore Legislation crisis. Nc. w it was<br />
suggested, for a start, that ou had reached breaking-point and had a vh ole<br />
series of criticisms within the Party room. And then the Off-Shore Legislation<br />
came up and suggested one theory that explained the crisis that followed, and you<br />
said " I'm sick of this now. This one I am going to stick with."<br />
PM No, no. Well, if there were any truth in that, which ones did ore not go<br />
ahead with before which would lead one to say, " Well, I am sickÂ½ of pulling<br />
things off" I mean, we did have a lot of criticism from certai: quarters on<br />
the IDC and we didn't say well we won't go ahead with it. We had a lot of<br />
criticism about the Health Scheme which we introduced and theories about<br />
what might happen, but we didn't stop. We went ahead.<br />
Q. There were some modifications, I thinllk, at that stage?<br />
PM Oh, I don't really think<br />
Q. Well you accepted the Senate's modifications?<br />
PM Oh, well, they were not basic in any way at all. No, the Off-Shore Minerals<br />
Legislation is legislation which is needed to define just who has got sovereignty in<br />
these areas. At some stage that will be defined one way or the other.<br />
Q. I am not in fact querying that suggestion, but I am wondering, and a lot of<br />
people wondered whether that was really the way to do it. You havern't got that<br />
legislation through yet.<br />
PM No, we haven't got it through yet.<br />
Q. There was a story that one of the compromises that came up from members<br />
of your Party Mr McEwen took it to you you took one look at it and told him<br />
what the people concerned could do with it. 9 / 7 </p>
<p>PM But these were all stories which were written by people who were-n't anywhere<br />
in the vicinity. I am sure that Mr McEwen would completely deny some d the<br />
wild far-out stories that came up. There were, from memory, propositions h ich<br />
I didn't think were sensible propositioas. But this way that people wrote about<br />
throwing them on the floor, or something. This is just ridiculous.<br />
Q. But couldn't you see at the time it might have been better just to null off,<br />
wait a little and then put it through later? As it turns out, you are probably<br />
going to do that.<br />
PM Well it might have been. But it seemed to me to be a prooer thing to<br />
happen for Australia, and it still seems to me to be an essential thing to happen<br />
for Australia. Perhaps it would have been better not to go ahead but I think the<br />
adherence to the necessity for doing this was necessary, and is necessary<br />
a matter of timing and other things comes into it.<br />
Q. You have occasionally got annoyed with your critics. You referred at one<br />
ste 3e at a time of crisis on the eve of the general elections last year, to white<br />
frog-bellied things that come out of the sewers or something. You have also<br />
criticised some pressmen for taking an attitude to your New Guinea trip,<br />
sayi ng It was going too well they were saying it was going too well and<br />
what could they do to denigrate it. One gets the impression that you feel<br />
sometimes, in times of stress rather plagued by people.<br />
PM Well let's look at both those things you have mentioned. May I say that the<br />
-white frog-belly or whatever it was, was not on the eve of the gereral elections<br />
I'm sorry, I think it was the day before the election. It could well have<br />
been, but it was in reply to a specific question about a lot of calumny, personal<br />
calumny that had been poured out and somebody printed photographs, denigratory<br />
photographs which didn't seem to me to have anything to do with political matters<br />
or anything of that kind just personal calumny. And that was in relation to<br />
that alone. As far as New Guinea was concerned, well, you know I can't<br />
reveal my sources but I think the sources are fairly I believe in the sources<br />
anyway that some of these statements were made on that New Guinea visit, and<br />
if so, I think it is a reasonable sort of a thing to say they are not quite impartial.<br />
Q. You concede then to pressmen who rely on similarly reliable sources<br />
that they could sometimes be right.<br />
PM Sometimes be right and sometimes not:<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you mentioned the obvious one of the calumny directed<br />
against. Your personal criticism by Mx St Joh was one of the most dramatic<br />
events in the Parliament. / C </p>
<p>PM Yes, it was.<br />
Q. What wac your reaction? Were you furious? Were you aigry'! ' Were you<br />
cool?<br />
PM I was very surprised that that should happen, not only at the strictly<br />
personal attacksG but the other statements made about never consulting:-with<br />
Cabinet, acting like a dictator and a lot of things which seemed to lave no basis<br />
in truth whatever. And it is an unpleasant thing to be publicly attacked in that<br />
way.<br />
Q. Can you remember your very first reaction? Just surpri-e 7Ths it anger?<br />
Or did you find yourself very cool? There tend to be the two extreme<br />
PM I don't think I could say one would find oneself to be very cool under that<br />
kind of approach. I do remember getting more and more surprised as all these<br />
odd accusations about dictatorship and so on came up. Nor do I really think that<br />
anger is the exact word that describes one's reaction. There is a word, but I<br />
can't think of it, but it is nearer to anger that to coolness, but it's not quite<br />
either.<br />
Q. Another criticism that is made of you is your tendency, as one vrriter put<br />
it, to talk too much about what the G ocernment hopes to do without first working<br />
out how it hopes to do it. Do you accept that criticism?<br />
PM In one way that could be a criticism, and yet I started perhaps I am not<br />
doing it as much now I started with a belief that in many, many areaS, a<br />
Government should stimulate public discussion on a particular subject, should go<br />
before the people and say, well, this is one way a thing could happen; on the<br />
other hand, this is another way it could happen, but on the whole we would hope<br />
it would happeli this way. And that would get people writing into the newspapers,<br />
or writing columns or arguing, which I had thought was quite a good way for a<br />
democracy to function before the Government finally came dowm. I still think<br />
it is except that it does tend to the sort of criticism that you just mentioned being<br />
made. I don't think that that criticism leads to a better way of running a government,<br />
but it probably leads to getting into lesS trouble.<br />
Q. Forgive me, but I have just thought of one example that puzzled me at the<br />
time which may come in that category. The Cape Keraudren business, the<br />
atomic harbour, that was a puzzling one because the announcement was made<br />
that that would be tried, that a study would be completed within six mo: nths,<br />
whereas in fact, in basic terms, you need two years for an ecological study<br />
to be made. / 9 </p>
<p>PM Well, no, at the time, the Department of National Develomient at that time<br />
had received this request tbr this to be done, for this atomic harbour to be<br />
blown, and the expense of it was to be borne by the entrepren~ eur who had a lot<br />
of iron lea ses. an the United Sta* people were prepared to carry out thi s<br />
study and those were the time scales given. But it subsequently transpired that<br />
the man who was going to finance it believed that the richness of his ore deposits<br />
was not as great as he thought they were and so he wasn't prepared to go ahead<br />
and finance it and that's what happened. But it was quite a firm proposal as put<br />
forward.<br />
Q. I got the impression at the time that it might have been a bit of grandstanding.<br />
PM No, it<br />
Q. When you drop these phrases at first, as you fly a kite, it can look a bit<br />
like grandstanding.<br />
PM but this was what happened to this one. It was going to be<br />
financed by the big businessman<br />
Q. Now, Prime Minister, one of the areas vwhere you have bad criticism has<br />
been in the External Affairs area, the Foreign Affairs area where you have taken<br />
the initiative yourself on a number of occasions0. Now very early in*.<br />
your Prime Ministership you said " No more troops in Vietnam". Shortly<br />
afterwards you were saying,. " Well, I am not quite sure. I don't want to be<br />
committed all the way into the future", or to that effect.<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q. You have also said during the last election campaign, or a bit be:. 2ore it, as<br />
far as the troorps in Vietnam are concerned, itt s" one out all cut but in fact it<br />
will be one battalion back. Is this the function of your speakiig too soon?<br />
PM No, I don'tt think it is, but you can makce your own mind uip about that. We<br />
had made a decision as a government that we wouldn't be providing a14. y more<br />
troops to Vietnam and the question actually asked of me was a question about the<br />
immediate future because of the Tet offensive and so on, and I announ. ced what<br />
the Government's decision had been. But later on I was asked " Does this apply<br />
forever", and no-one can say that something applies forever because a whole<br />
scene might change, but it did apply and in fact did apply all the way up-until<br />
now. On the question of the withdrawal of our own troops, we had three<br />
battalions there carrying out a particular funiction, and they were a viable force<br />
we could have 1people at rest and people out. And they would not be able to<br />
carry out that same function, and they won' t be able to carry out that came<br />
function with a paart of them being withdrawn. They will have to have a<br />
modified and different function. But if they were to have carried out thle<br />
same function that they were carrying out at that time, then they would all need<br />
to stay there or the whole lot would have had to come out. </p>
<p>Q. You don't think you could have foreseen that at all?<br />
PM I don't think, so, no, on the advice I had at the time.<br />
Q. There was only a matter of about sever; weeks, I think, between the two<br />
statements<br />
PM Well we did have, if I remember rightly, further movements towards<br />
Vietnamisation and other changes in the overall picture in V etr-n.<br />
Q. One gets the impression at times, if I can put this to you, that sometimes<br />
in our Vietnam commitment, on one or two occasions anyway, you have seemed<br />
to have been a little annoyed with the Americans. There was the instance that<br />
came out in public to some extent of the bombing pause that President Johnson<br />
announced just after Mr Fairhall had made a very strong speech in Parliament<br />
saying no bombing pause was out, Vietnam pulling out, giving concessions. Do<br />
you have problems or have you had problems over this two and a half year<br />
period in the relationships with the American. people?<br />
PM No problems in the relationship with the American people or with the<br />
American Government. I think at the time you were speaking of and one has<br />
got to cast one's mind back quite a while for this -I think we had a feeling<br />
if there was going to be a bombing pause, we might have beer, told soo-ner<br />
than we were that that was the actual . policy af the United Stat es. We were told<br />
but not far in advance.<br />
Q. There was then t'he thing which I think Mr St John raised to some extert<br />
and it has also been raised by other people, that you held a midmight press<br />
conference on October 17 and you said that there was only gave the only<br />
official confirmation, I think, throughout the world at that stage.....*<br />
PM This has been alleged, of course. What actually happened there was that<br />
the cables were running hot from the United States and perhaps from Europe<br />
I don't know the media cables were running hot with statements ofZ What was<br />
going to happen and what the United States were going to do, and our owin<br />
press people wanted to talk to me about it. And so I came baick to the House<br />
and talked to Alan Barnes of the " Age" and some other man<br />
Q. AUP<br />
PM Ken Braddick of AUP. They seemed to get slightly different stories and<br />
Braddick's was a little bit the more interpretive, I think, than Alan Barn~ es'<br />
and led to this allegation of official confirmation of something. I think if you<br />
see the stories that Barnes wrote or that somebody in the " Sydney Morning<br />
Herald" wrote covering him, they were rather different from what Braddick<br />
himself wrote. </p>
<p>Q. Then again in the foreign affairs area, the Malaysia Five Power talks, and<br />
the Malaya/ Malaysia controversy. This was also one which struck me at the<br />
time. In that same speech you refer -ed to " Malaya" rather thani " Malaysia".<br />
You also suggested to the Malaysians that they should tidy up their ovin affairs<br />
a bit. they were having racial trouble. Was that diplomatic'i<br />
PM I don't know, but I think it was necessary for Australia's position to be made<br />
clear to everybody and Australia's position was that we were not goilng to get<br />
mixed up in inter-racial strife. I think it might have been more diplomatic to<br />
say something which could be interpreted several different ways, but it wouldn~ t<br />
have been as clear to all concerned and on the whole, in the long run, I think it<br />
is rather better for a nation's attitude to be quite clear in relation to things<br />
like that. And so that was made clear. Also we did not wish to become involved<br />
in any quarrel that might arise between the Philippines and the claimns to North<br />
Borneo. We therefore drew some distinction between the commiitmernts that we felt<br />
we had in I'm sorry, Malaya or the Peninsula of Malaya. I think everybody<br />
knows what that mearas as distinct from the other component parts of Malaysia.<br />
And I think it's proper to make one's position ' known in these matters.<br />
Q. We have very little time left, Prime Minister. I want to touch on a couple<br />
of other areas, one is New Guinea and the controversy you have beer, involved<br />
in. It seems to have been, for a start, the only area in which that I can think<br />
of where you have used the Menzies technique of stealing the Opposition' s<br />
thunder when you appointed Mr Johnson as Administrator.<br />
PM Why? Were they going to do that, or something?<br />
Q. Well Mr Whitlam had mentioned him favourably in the House.<br />
PM Well he had been mentioned favourably to me by quite a num.. ber ai people<br />
who knew him and had known him during his Army days and ever since. And<br />
in fact I especially asked him to do it, and great credit is due to him because<br />
he had been appointed as the Head of a College of Advanced Education in<br />
Tasmania at a far more comfortable job, a far less straining job, and I could<br />
imagine at least at the same amount of remuneration, but he went backx there<br />
because he felt that was his duty. I think it was a good appointment, as I think<br />
the new Secretary, David Hay, was a good appointment.<br />
Q. The hot issue of New Guinea is still the Mautaungans, and it is a<br />
continuing one it looks like. Can you understand, follow their argument against<br />
the way European and Chinese influence may be increased unnecessarily in<br />
their view by having a Multiracial Council? e. / 12 </p>
<p>PM No, I can't but that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter whether I can or<br />
not. I don't believe the European..... I can't understand how a multi-racial<br />
council, made up as it is, could increase the European or the Chinese influence.<br />
But if the people of the Gazelle Peninsula believe this that's a different matter<br />
and that is why I said, " Well for goodness sake let's find out what the people<br />
want. Let's have a referendum and we will abide by the result".<br />
Q. Are you confident that we can avoid the kind of thing that has been in<br />
Africa?<br />
PM No, I'm not. I think if we precipitately vi thdraw that we could lead to<br />
the situation where the majority of the population would be sorry that ve had<br />
withdrawn I am speaking of all the Highlanders and many in other areas would<br />
not wish to be ruled by the elite and where there could be repetition of some<br />
of the internal struggles that we have seen in Africa. And this is one of the<br />
great, great problems of . New Guinea.<br />
Q. Can't we also get into a situation as in Kenya where we find ourselves<br />
having to put people in gaol? And then finding them national leaders. That<br />
happened in so<br />
PM I suppose that that is so, but isn't the difference between our approach<br />
to New Guinea and the approach to Kenya that we say and mean that when we<br />
can discover the wishes of the majority of people then we will meet those<br />
wishes. There is no question about that. Certainly we have given evidence<br />
of our continuation along the path of handing them more self-government, but<br />
the real difference, I think, is that we say, " Right we will get out". Now, it<br />
is hard to know exactly the best way you can discover what the wishes of<br />
the majority of the people are, but it could be done either by statements and<br />
votes in the Hcuse of Assembly, it could be done by a referendum of some kind,<br />
it could be done by something which is more natural to them than to us, which<br />
is sitting down and getting a consensus of opinion. But I wouldn't go into the<br />
means of it, but I do think we should find out what they want before we take<br />
action.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, one final question, because we have run a bit beyond<br />
our time infact. Does it perturb you as a proclaimed Australian nationalist<br />
that the time of your office has seen some of the strongest emotional<br />
divisions in the Australian community the youth/ age problem, which wraps<br />
up with drugs and marihuana to some extent, and different standards of<br />
morality, the anti-Vietnam movement, and the growth of conscience issues<br />
rather than economic issues to some extent? ./ 13 </p>
<p>PM I don't think the growth of conscience issues in internal matter iz divisive.<br />
You are thinking of people saying, " Well, more ought to be done for the poor,<br />
and more ought to be done in preserving the environment, arid these.<br />
matters, and I don't think there is any strong antipathy between.-the peop. le<br />
who are saying " More should not be done for the poor" or we shouldn't look<br />
after our environment. It is disturbing that the Vietnam question should have<br />
raised the controversy it did but then I think it's a matter of decisior. as to<br />
whether we are divisive or whether those who use the methods agalinSt observance<br />
of the law are divisive.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, what do you see in the next one thousand days'!<br />
PM Well I hope there will be a little more peace and quiet at some stage during<br />
that thousand than there has been during this thousand which has Seen more<br />
changes, more new problems, more solutions of many problems than I think<br />
any other thousand days has probably seen.<br />
Q. Thank you, Prime Minister. </p>
