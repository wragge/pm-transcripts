    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, you stated that part of your tax reform, that all</p>
<p>   the details of the package was to provide incentives for people</p>
<p>   to get of welfare. Could you explain to me how that mechanism will</p>
<p>   work.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well at the moment, because of the interaction of the taxation system</p>
<p>   and the welfare system there are points of income where there is</p>
<p>   virtually no incentive for a person who has a number dependents</p>
<p>   to get of welfare and to get back into the workforce because the</p>
<p>   effective marginal rate of taxation constituted by the actual rate</p>
<p>   of tax plus the withdrawal of the social security benefits can be</p>
<p>   as high as 85%. And what we have done is two things. We have increased</p>
<p>   significantly the income levels that people can have before they</p>
<p>   start the lose the social security benefits and we have also reduced</p>
<p>   from 50% to 30% the rate, the taper rate, the rate at which the</p>
<p>   social security benefits are withdrawn. And this has the very beneficial</p>
<p>   effect of people who find a job and do their sums deciding that</p>
<p>   it's much better to get back into the workforce than to stay</p>
<p>   on welfare. Now I think anything that you can do to reduce welfare</p>
<p>   dependency is desirable. That's why we introduced work for</p>
<p>   the dole. That's why we've extended work for the dole.</p>
<p>   That's why we've introduced the youth allowance which</p>
<p>   tilts the incentive towards training and education rather than being</p>
<p>   on the dole. And that's one of the reasons why we have made</p>
<p>   these changes and I'm pleased to note that this is one aspect</p>
<p>   of the plan that ACOSS this morning said it strongly supported.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Peter Lindsay spoke at a rotary lunch last week and he informed</p>
<p>   us that allied or alternative health care people would be collecting</p>
<p>   GST whilst the orthodox medical practitioners would not be collecting</p>
<p>   GST. Can you explain the logic to me behind that? I'm a great</p>
<p>   personal believer in a GST. I'd like to see everyone collecting</p>
<p>   as opposed to some people being excluded by the process.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well what we have sought to do, and I think with all of these things</p>
<p>   it's very important that because they involve a great deal</p>
<p>   of technical detail, if you have a specific question about what</p>
<p>   is in and out that should be carefully checked with all the documentation</p>
<p>   so that you're accurately informed. But the idea is to have</p>
<p>   a GST free situation for things that are, in effect, covered by</p>
<p>   Medicare, plus other activities including dentistry and a number</p>
<p>   of other activities. There obviously has to be a line drawn somewhere</p>
<p>   and the difficulty of us including everything that could be regarded</p>
<p>   as allied to medical activity would be that that in turn would open</p>
<p>   up another boundary of requests where people will say: well if you're</p>
<p>   going to leave that free of the GST then our activity can also be</p>
<p>   beneficial to somebody's health and we think that ought to</p>
<p>   be free of the GST as well and before long you find yourself back</p>
<p>   to the situation that we have at the present time where you have</p>
<p>   rates of wholesale sales tax on things up to 32% yet you have other</p>
<p>   activities which are not subject to any wholesale tax at all. The</p>
<p>   grossest example is I think the comparison of caviar with orange</p>
<p>   juice concentrate where caviar is free of the wholesale sales tax</p>
<p>   yet orange juice concentrate carries a wholesale sales tax of either</p>
<p>   12 or 22%. I'm not sure off-hand which it is but whatever it</p>
<p>   is it's at least 12% more than that carried by caviar. Sir</p>
<p>   I understand there will be borders of discontent. Your own particular</p>
<p>   activity and others, we'll check the list. I think in fact</p>
<p>   yours is on the list isn't it Arthur? Anyway we'll check</p>
<p>   that out for you.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you talked about the [inaudible] broad picture and I</p>
<p>   can appreciate that about reducing taxes on exports and things like</p>
<p>   that. In the book trade there are currently [inaudible] sales tax</p>
<p>   on books. We're having major problems with books being imported</p>
<p>   or imported through the internet. Are you going to address the problems</p>
<p>   of books coming into Australia being paid for with credit cards,</p>
<p>   no tax being gathered on them?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well within the bounds of practicality we are seeking to address</p>
<p>   that problem in a way that doesn't end up costing more than</p>
<p>   its worth in terms of revenue collection and part of the consultative</p>
<p>   process that's going to be undertaken over the next 18 months</p>
<p>   will ensure that that occurs.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister the one thing you did not touch upon is the most</p>
<p>   inequitous tax introduced by Labor ...(inaudible)...opposed</p>
<p>   by the Liberal Party was the Fringe Benefits Tax. What are we doing</p>
<p>   about the Fringe Benefits Tax, where the employers paying for the</p>
<p>   wider benefit to the employee.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well...did everybody hear that? No well the gentleman wanted</p>
<p>   to know what we were doing about the Fringe Benefits Tax which was</p>
<p>   introduced by the former Government in 1985. Well the answer to</p>
<p>   that is we are not proposing its abolition. I know that will disappoint</p>
<p>   a lot of people here. We don't think, given the revenue constraints</p>
<p>   that we have and the other changes that we've wanted to make</p>
<p>   that we could afford to abolish the fringe benefits tax. The gentleman</p>
<p>   suggested that what we should do is, by implication I think, correct</p>
<p>   me if I'm wrong, that the Fringe Benefits Tax ought to be borne</p>
<p>   by the employee rather than by the employer. Can I see, in all candour</p>
<p>   that whatever might be the intrinsic merit or otherwise of that</p>
<p>   if you were starting from scratch that is not realistic now that</p>
<p>   an arrangement has been in operation for such a long period of time,</p>
<p>   particularly inside other major reforms for that to take place.</p>
<p>   And I know, as I said at the beginning of my speech that not everything</p>
<p>   we have done satisfies everybody and there will be people in the</p>
<p>   business community who will say: well I wished he'd had done</p>
<p>   something about that and I wished he'd not done something about</p>
<p>   something else. What I'm asking everybody to do is to look</p>
<p>   at the whole, is to look at the aggregate impact of the plan on</p>
<p>   the Australian economy and on the business sector. And if I had</p>
<p>   a choice between taking $10.5 billion of taxes on inputs off business</p>
<p>   community or taking the Fringe Benefits Tax of the business community</p>
<p>   I would frankly say taking that $10.5 billion of input costs off</p>
<p>   is far more beneficial. Far more evenly spread and much more desirable</p>
<p>   in the long term interests of the productive sector the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. In the end in Government, when you're talking about</p>
<p>   the revenue, it comes down to choices. And all of us have got choices</p>
<p>   and that's the choice that we've made. It's not to</p>
<p>   say that every aspect of the fringe benefits tax now is desirable</p>
<p>   but we simply didn't have the room to get rid of it any more</p>
<p>   than we had the room to get rid of payroll tax. Much and all as</p>
<p>   a lot of people in the community think that that ought to be done.</p>
<p>   But if you'd wanted to get rid of payroll tax you'd have</p>
<p>   to have had a GST rate of between 13 and 15%. Now we didn't</p>
<p>   think that was very smart. We thought that would have grossly reduced</p>
<p>   the acceptability of the plan that we're putting forward. So</p>
<p>   the balance was struck. We go for getting rid of the tax of the</p>
<p>   costs of taxes on inputs. We go for cleaning up the indirect tax</p>
<p>   system. We go for reducing fuel costs. The cost of that is that,</p>
<p>   of all of those things, is that you have to keep some other things</p>
<p>   which in an ideal world you might want to get rid of.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  My first question was going to be about payroll tax. The second</p>
<p>   one was another similar, relationship between the GST and the States.</p>
<p>   How will the GST, you said that it will be handed over to the States.</p>
<p>   How will it be divided up between the States? Is it on the basis</p>
<p>   of past taxes or is it on the basis of population or the...?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Sir, we're asking the Commonwealth Grants Commission. After</p>
<p>   the election we will have a meeting of the, a Premiers' Conference,</p>
<p>   perhaps the last Premiers' Conference of the modern era, to</p>
<p>   talk about how we're going to bring the new plan into operation.</p>
<p>   And the proposal is that we will ask the Commonwealth Grants Commission</p>
<p>   to decide the allocation between the States and it won't just</p>
<p>   be done, I mean it's up to the Grants Commission to devise</p>
<p>   its own formula, but if you do it strictly on a population basis</p>
<p>   you get one result. If you do it on a per capita growth basis you</p>
<p>   get another result. And therefore we take the view that what you</p>
<p>   should try and do is to get the Grants Commission to decide on the</p>
<p>   allocation between the States. We estimate that after ten years</p>
<p>   of operation of the new plan the States will be, in aggregate, $25</p>
<p>   billion better off than they would be if the existing revenue sharing</p>
<p>   arrangements were to continue. It's an extraordinarily good</p>
<p>   offer for the States. It's a fabulous offer for Queensland</p>
<p>   because not only would Queensland benefit along with all the other</p>
<p>   States but Queensland will get more out of getting rid of that fuel</p>
<p>   tax, that excise, than any other State in Australia because Queensland</p>
<p>   is big and decentralised. And just....Queensland is the most</p>
<p>   decentralised State in Australia. The majority of you people don't</p>
<p>   live in Brisbane as you all know. Where as the majority of people</p>
<p>   in New South Wales do live in Sydney. And those circumstances I</p>
<p>   can't for the life of me understand why Mr Beattie is against</p>
<p>   my plan. Because it's a pro-Queensland plan. It's terrific</p>
<p>   for Queensland. I mean I can't believe how good it is for Queensland.</p>
<p>   And when you add all of those things together it's terrific.</p>
<p>   Beautiful one day, perfect the next, and fabulous the day after.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, thanks for dropping in. Pity you can't stay longer.</p>
<p>   Just a couple of things. One thing that concerns me for those of</p>
<p>   us, I think in many ways you're preaching to the converted</p>
<p>   which is not such a bad thing, but one thing for some of us who</p>
<p>   lived through Wik and also the industrial relations reforms, I guess</p>
<p>   we look at it from an angle in that how is your tax reform going</p>
<p>   to get through the Senate if you win the next election? The concern,</p>
<p>   you know, how many concessions are going to be put in place to the</p>
<p>   Democrats and or whoever else may be there obstructing this legislation.</p>
<p>   This is Queensland after all. I was just wondering, isn't the</p>
<p>   common enemy a hostile Senate and what are you going to do about</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the answer to that. It's a very serious question. The</p>
<p>   answer is that is in the hands of the Australian people. I heard</p>
<p>   a report this morning, it may or may not have been accurate, forecasting</p>
<p>   that the Australian Democrats were going to declare at some stage</p>
<p>   that the plan in its present form was unacceptable. Can I say that</p>
<p>   the acceptability or otherwise of this plan will be determined by</p>
<p>   the Australian people, not by the Australian Democrats and in the</p>
<p>   end it is for the people of Australia by their vote at the next</p>
<p>   election and the size of the support that they register for this</p>
<p>   plan that will ultimately decide what happens in the Senate. Nobody</p>
<p>   is more conscious than I, there is person in Australia who is more</p>
<p>   conscious than I of the vagaries of the Senate voting system, and</p>
<p>   there's no doubt in the world that we've had one hand</p>
<p>   tied behind our back from March of 1996, despite our 44 seat majority</p>
<p>   ,because we don't have a majority in the Senate. But that is</p>
<p>   the law of Australia. And I'm as bound by it as you are and</p>
<p>   every other Australian is bound by it. I might rail against it,</p>
<p>   I might get angry about it, I might complain about it, I might seek</p>
<p>   refuge and explain the way why things haven't happened but</p>
<p>   in the end I've got to live with it and I've got to make</p>
<p>   the thing work. But in the end we got Wik fixed. In the end we did.</p>
<p>   It took a while but I got it fixed in the end against enormous odds</p>
<p>   and incredible obstruction from the Labor Party. Incredible deliveries</p>
<p>   of sanctimonious lectures from different sections of the Australian</p>
<p>   community and I though that was a very very protracted issue and</p>
<p>   that no good was done for the Australian community because of the</p>
<p>   obstruction by the Democrats, by the Greens and by the Australian</p>
<p>   Labor Party and I say full marks to Senator Harradine, who in the</p>
<p>   end had the sense of responsibility to the rest of the Australian</p>
<p>   community. But sir, all I can say to you is that I will be asking</p>
<p>   the Australian people to vote for us in the lower house and to vote</p>
<p>   for us in the upper house. And if people want this plan they'll</p>
<p>   vote for Coalition in both houses. They won't muck around with</p>
<p>   minority parties, they won't muck around with people who are</p>
<p>   against tax reform. And the only show in town, the only good people</p>
<p>   in town who are interested in tax reform are the Liberal Party and</p>
<p>   the National Party. The rest of them, in one form or another, don't</p>
<p>   want tax reform. The Labor Party doesn't want it. The Democrats</p>
<p>   I'm not sure. One Nation says it is against tax reform. So</p>
<p>   if you really want tax reform the message you ought to give your</p>
<p>   mates is vote for us in both houses and don't muck around with</p>
<p>   minorities.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Good afternoon Mr Howard. One of the things, I'm [inaudible]</p>
<p>   and I believe the GST, I believe in what you're doing and I</p>
<p>   believe in the open Government policy, but a lot of people will</p>
<p>   look at the GST as a fear of the unknown. There's a lot of</p>
<p>   products that even I utilise that I don't know the indirect</p>
<p>   taxes are already there and I think possibly that a lot of people</p>
<p>   ought to know what's already there and how you're going</p>
<p>   to change it. I think it's an education program that the average</p>
<p>   Australian as well as give people the right to know and feel safe.</p>
<p>   I believe in GST.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I believe that you're right about education and that's</p>
<p>   what we're doing by spending this $10 million. That is not</p>
<p>   a propaganda campaign it's an education campaign. We're</p>
<p>   not attacking the Labor Party in any of those ads. What we're</p>
<p>   doing is explaining how the new system will work and part of that</p>
<p>   information is to remind people that the 22% on the family motor</p>
<p>   car, of the taxes on flavoured milk, on biscuits, the taxes on orange</p>
<p>   juice concentrate, the taxes on soap powders the taxes on detergent,</p>
<p>   the taxes on computers, the taxes on all the other...., the fact</p>
<p>   that petrol is going to be 7 cents a litre cheaper. Whether you've</p>
<p>   got a farm or you're using diesel or whatever. So we are going</p>
<p>   to do all of those things and that's why we have to spend the</p>
<p>   money on the advertising campaign.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, my name's [inaudible]. I'm the State Secretary</p>
<p>   for the Livestock Transport Association and a local operator. Congratulations</p>
<p>   on recognising the input that transport has in this country and</p>
<p>   it's a bad time. I just have a couple of questions. The 18</p>
<p>   cents per litre that you're about on diesel, how much of that</p>
<p>   is actually going to be regarded as a road user charge as being</p>
<p>   suggested and how much of it will actually go back onto the roads?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well we are not going to formally hypothecating it but we obviously</p>
<p>   will have a very very strong roads program.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Just a second question Mr Howard. The National Road Transport Commission</p>
<p>   [inaudible] a 25% increase in registration for [inaudible] road</p>
<p>   train prime movers. You probably don't know about that or whatever,</p>
<p>   I'm interested to know, are we giving it with one hard and</p>
<p>   maybe taking it away from the other?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well we are certainly not. I've had no part, that thing that</p>
<p>   you're referring to, we certainly are not part of that. And</p>
<p>   certainly there's no sort of sinister plot I can assure you.</p>
<p>   It's a terrific deal for your industry it, really is.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  [inaudible]. Mr Howard, welcome to Townsville. I agree with you</p>
<p>   [inaudible]. But Mr Howard my business is [inaudible] medical engineering</p>
<p>   (tape break) dying breed as well, but taking into account the national</p>
<p>   competition policy, with the GST how would you differentiate between</p>
<p>   government supply services, and those services provided by private</p>
<p>   enterprise? And if this GST does actually apply to government supply</p>
<p>   services, would it apply to the full cost of these services, in</p>
<p>   other words, the full cost that the government would bear for these</p>
<p>   services?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, look, what we've endeavoured to do is to lay down some</p>
<p>   principles, we've been able in the document to enumerate an</p>
<p>   enormous amount of detail but in the 18 months that will go by between</p>
<p>   now and the introduction of the new scheme we will obviously undertake</p>
<p>   a very very strong program of consultation with industry and there</p>
<p>   will be various elements where decisions will need to be made and</p>
<p>   a certain amount of fine-tuning will take place.</p>
<p>  When you are putting together a plan such as this you have to balance</p>
<p>   on the one hand the need to have sufficient specificity and clarity</p>
<p>   and detail when you announce it, but equally because it is new,</p>
<p>   to allow a consultative process so that there is a certain amount</p>
<p>   of fine-tuning, and what we want is to in response to the sort of</p>
<p>   issue that you've raised, we want to ensure that it operates</p>
<p>   in a way that doesn't put private industry in any competitive</p>
<p>   disadvantage in relation to public the activities of Government,</p>
<p>   and we certainly don't want that to be the situation. I mean,</p>
<p>   one of the things, amongst other things that motivated us in relation</p>
<p>   to making education GST free was the recognition that there is both</p>
<p>   public and private sector education and that if you had applied</p>
<p>   it in relation to private education there could well have been some</p>
<p>   disadvantage in terms of its competition with public education services.</p>
<p>   SO the principle, Sir, in relation to your industry will be to ensure</p>
<p>   that we have a set of principles and a set of rules that guarantees</p>
<p>   that your industry and your particular activity is not at a competitive</p>
<p>   disadvantage because that is certainly not the goal and we are quite</p>
<p>   certain that we can work that out and work that out effectively</p>
<p>   through the consultative mechanism that we are going to undertake.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Welcome Prime Minister. I'm Trisha Brown from James Cook University,</p>
<p>   and I'm particularly interested to know how the GST will affect</p>
<p>   universities, given that they are currently sales tax exempt organisations</p>
<p>   and operating in a climate of dimishing resources. I'd like</p>
<p>   to know what the GST will do to operating costs?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, we don't think, given the other changes we are proposing,</p>
<p>   we don't think they'll have a detrimental impact on the</p>
<p>   operating expenses. Of course ordinary tuition is going to be GST</p>
<p>   free, and that of course means that there will be a full recovery</p>
<p>   of input taxation. Now, the other thing you Âve got to remember</p>
<p>   is that although you think that you are completely wholesale tax</p>
<p>   free, I think you will find that there are some items that where</p>
<p>   the taxation under the existing system is embedded into your cost</p>
<p>   structure. I mean, half of the wholesale tax revenue collected in</p>
<p>   Australia at the present time comes from sort of non-personal areas,</p>
<p>   and most of them commercial, and I think you will find that however</p>
<p>   free you may believe that you are wholesale sales tax, there will</p>
<p>   be quite a bit of it embedded in the operating costs of educational</p>
<p>   institutions.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Mr Prime Minister. John Dawkins, I'm a local small builder</p>
<p>   and also Chairman of the Queensland Master Builder's Association,</p>
<p>   Northern division. Our concern is that we employ quite a large number</p>
<p>   of people in the industry, in the housing and construction industry,</p>
<p>   and some of the things that we've heard around the place is</p>
<p>   that we will have additional costs in excess of $4000 and up, depending</p>
<p>   on who you talk to. Our concern is the effect on the industry. You</p>
<p>   do say here that you are reducing some of the taxes, I see very</p>
<p>   little of these taxes being reduced for the small builders throughout</p>
<p>   Queensland.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't, with respect, I don't agree with that.</p>
<p>   The reductions are the same, the taxes, the input taxes that are</p>
<p>   going are going across the business sector. As far as housing is</p>
<p>   concerned, we calculate because of the wholesale sales tax that</p>
<p>   is embedded in the cost of a new home now, that the net increase</p>
<p>   is not of course 10% but it is about 4.7%. There is of course a</p>
<p>   first homebuyers grant of $7000 which is non-means tested. It has</p>
<p>   no age specification, the only requirement is that there not previously</p>
<p>   have been a dwelling owned by that person, and that is available</p>
<p>   in relation to whether the house is new or it is second hand or</p>
<p>   a unit, or apartment, whatever the method and whatever the kind</p>
<p>   of title is. There's no restriction of that kind. People in</p>
<p>   your industry purchase a lot of fuel. People involved in your industry</p>
<p>   would already have very significant embedded costs and I know that</p>
