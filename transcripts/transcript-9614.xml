SPEECH FOR ARRIVAL OF ONE NATION TRAIN, ADELAIDE FREIGHT<br />
TERMINAL, ADELAIDE, 6 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much, Ted [ Butcher], Premier, my colleague Laurie Brereton,<br />
Leader of the Opposition, Minister for Transport, Mayor, distinguished guests,<br />
and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
One can't but help feel the sense of history in this the poignancy of it<br />
coming down through the hills. It's amazing how gentle those things are you<br />
can pull the dynamic adjuster back, and slightly on the brake, and a little bit<br />
up one, and it just sort of moves along for you as you like. But it gives you an<br />
idea of what it's like to be a railway person railway men and women. And<br />
the great job that railways have done in binding all sorts of nations together,<br />
including this one. And it was, of course, the extension of the rail system<br />
around Australia that brought the country together, and as Ted said, we read<br />
in our schoolbooks about the broken gauge it's really a quite remarkable<br />
thing that the gauge was broken, and we never had this a century or so ago.<br />
But at any rate, under One Nation, we had the chance to do this, and I<br />
wanted to make that point particularly when the nation was really feeling the<br />
pinch of the recession, to know that we could come out of it with a strategy,<br />
and also by doing things that would stand the test of time that we were not<br />
simply throwing money at the problem, but doing things with it that would<br />
stand us in good stead over time. Solid real things changing and binding<br />
the country together, pulling together, and I though the concept of the<br />
national rail highway was the one to adopt at that time.<br />
And this is the first train that will go from Brisbane to Perth, via Melbourne<br />
and Adelaide. And in doing this, it will not only link the continent, but I think<br />
bind South Australia more fully into the Eastern States of Victoria, New South<br />
Wales and Queensland, and I think this will have a tremendous impact upon<br />
South Australia material as well as psychological. Important to know that<br />
those linkages are there. </p>
<p>Laurie is with me and, of course, he is the one who has principally been<br />
involved in putting together the new construction through the Adelaide Hills,<br />
up the Mount Barker Road, and I travelled through the Devils Elbow this<br />
morning seeing what a dreadful problem it is, particularly those big trucks,<br />
and the extension of the runway, so that by road, by air and by rail, the<br />
linkages for South Australia will be better and stronger. And as a<br />
consequence, I think the whole of this state will feel as though it is much<br />
more part of One Nation than perhaps ever before. But, it does, I think, more<br />
than that it does give South Australia a chance to become one of the freight<br />
hubs of Australia. Because we will see containers brought across the<br />
country, and I think the port of Adelaide will be given the opportunity to<br />
compete with the port of Melbourne, and indeed the port of Sydney. And it<br />
will mean more investment over time by national rail in the track, and to<br />
getting that track into place, and keeping the stock up, getting the time down,<br />
smoothing out the bends, and getting the maintenance into it, particularly in<br />
some of the states where the track has run down. But by and large in the<br />
doing of it, we ought to be able to see some real competition between these<br />
ports, and see a new services and freight industry for this country.<br />
So, I said this morning on a radio station people always ask me about<br />
elections I said well give me the choice between an election and building a<br />
railway around Australia, I'll take the building of a railway around Australia,<br />
because it will be here when the elections are long gone. And it is the solid<br />
things I mean, belief in ourselves, belief in what we can do together, and<br />
filling in the gaps which is what One Nation sought to do, both those gaps<br />
by distance and gaps by psychology it is important to believe that we go<br />
together as a nation inclusively, and that we can do things together. And I<br />
think that in a cooperative sense, national rail is about as good as that gets,<br />
and we are really just on the threshold of seeing a much better rail service.<br />
This means, of course, that a lot of those containers that are on the roads will<br />
be off the roads, and onto rail. And a lot of the accidents, and problems of<br />
safety that we are having with basically too many trucks on roads doing long<br />
distance hauls are better done by railway. This is going to change that, too.<br />
I think the railways are going to come of age as a result of this. I said<br />
yesterday, it is going to be a trains spotters paradise. And, of course, with<br />
our proposal to have Track Australia have one company owning the track<br />
and then any number of railway companies operating it, well if you are really<br />
keen about it, you can get into the railway business yourself you don't even<br />
have to muck around with models any more. So, there we are it can't be<br />
better than that. If you want to go and hire one of these things, you can go<br />
and do it. So, that's the brave new world of the modem railway, and it has<br />
started here with this single track coming through Australia, and through here<br />
to Adelaide.<br />
I'm delighted the Premier could join us this morning, and the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, and the Minister for Transport, the Mayor, for what is a real<br />
occasion, I think. And the fact is that this state has got tremendous<br />
opportunities with the growth of Australia's economy into Asia, but it always </p>
<p>3<br />
needed those material linkages let's hope that this One Nation railway is<br />
providing them.<br />
Could I conclude my remarks by thanking Ted Butcher and his team at<br />
National Rail for a job well done in taking up the One Nation challenge it is<br />
one thing getting money available, it's another thing to use it. They have<br />
used it, and used it effectively, and I'm sure it will be just another one of the<br />
jewels in the crown of Ted's quite illustrious career in Australian transport,<br />
and I thank him for it. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you one and all.<br />
ends. </p>
