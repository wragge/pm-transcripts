FOR PRESS P. M. No. 20/ 196<br />
DAWSON BY-ELECTION<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Har61d Holt<br />
Dr. Patterson is to be congratulated on his<br />
impressive victbry. By-elections are notoriously unreliable guides to<br />
the state of public thinking on national issues, and the<br />
special local features of this campaign put the result very<br />
much in that category.<br />
However, when the full details are available,<br />
we shall be studying the vote and its implications closely.<br />
CANBERRA, 27th February, 1966. </p>
