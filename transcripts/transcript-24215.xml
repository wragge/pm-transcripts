    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased that Their Majesties King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway will visit Australia from 22 to 27 February 2015 at the invitation of the Governor-General, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd).</p>
<p>Their Majesties will visit Canberra, Sydney and Perth, accompanied by a high-level delegation of senior government and business leaders.</p>
<p>Australia and Norway share a warm relationship. Trade between our nations last year was worth over $1.2 billion. </p>
<p>We both have strong oil, gas and mining sectors.  Significant Norwegian companies have invested in Australia’s energy, metals and agriculture sectors.</p>
