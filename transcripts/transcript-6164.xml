<p>ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON, R, J, HAWKE, AC., MP,<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN SPORTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION ANNUAL<br />
DINNER, WENTWORTH HOTEL, SYDNEY, JULY 29, 1983<br />
FIRST, LET ME SAY HOW PLEASED I WAS WHEN I RECEIVED<br />
THE INVITATION FROM THE AUSTRALIAN SPORTS WRITERS<br />
ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THIS DINNER AND PRESENT THE<br />
INAUGRAL AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE IN SPORTS JOURNALISM,<br />
MANY INVITATIONS COME ACROSS MY DESK EACH WEEK,<br />
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WHEN YOUR REQUEST WAS FIRST<br />
RAISED EARLIER THIS YEAR, OFFERING AN OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
TALK ABOUT SPORT AND NOT POLITICS, I DIDN'T HESITATE<br />
TO ACCEPT,<br />
AT A GATHERING LIKE THIS WITH SO MANY LEADING<br />
SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN, SPORTS ADMINISTRATORS AND<br />
SPORTS JOURNALISTS IN ATTENDANCE IT MAY APPEAR<br />
UNNECESSARY TO UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF SPORT<br />
SIN OUR NATIONAL LIFE.<br />
BUT OFTEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES IS RESTRICTED<br />
TO OUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND I WOULD LIKE TO SET OUT<br />
HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VIEWS THE ROLE OF SPORT. / 2 </p>
<p>THOSE WHO HAVE DESCRIBED AUSTRALIANS AS BEING OBSESSED<br />
WITH SPORT MAY WELL HAVE UNDERSTATED THE POSITION,<br />
No SUBJECT PROVOKES MORE ARGUMENT, AROU. SES MORE<br />
PASSIONS AND ENTERTAINS MORE AUSTRALIANS,<br />
MIORE THAN 70 DIFFERENT NATIONAL SPORTING BODIES<br />
REPRESENTING MORE THAN 4.5 MILLION REGISTERED<br />
PARTICIPANTS EXIST TO ADMINISTER THE MAJOR SPORTSADD<br />
TO THAT FIGURE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS WHO ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED OUTSIDE THESE<br />
ORGANISATIONS AND YOU BEGIN TO APPRECIATE THE EXTENT<br />
OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN SPORT.<br />
BEYOND THOSE ACTIVELY INVOLVED ARE COUNTLESS THOUSANDS<br />
WHO ARE ACTIVELY INTERESTED THE READERS, VIEWERS AND<br />
to LISTENERS CATERED FOR BY SPORTS JOURNALISTS.<br />
CLEARLY SPORT REACHES INTO MOST CORNERS OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
LIFE. FOR MOST OF THE 80-ODD YEARS SINCE FEDERATION, GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS PLAYED VERY LITTLE DIRECT ROLE IN SPORTING AFFAIRSNOTWITHSTANDING<br />
THE SERIO* US THREAT To AUSTRALIAN-BRITISH<br />
RELATIONS THAT AROSE DURING THE " BODYLINE" SERIES.<br />
NMAF </p>
<p>OVER THE PAST DECADE, HOWEVER, WE HAVE SEEN THE<br />
GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST IN, AND SUPPORT FOR,<br />
SPORT AT FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVELS,<br />
AND THERE ARE SOUND REASONS FOR THIS INVOLVEMENT,<br />
MOST IMPORTANT, IS THAT TODAY WHEN MANY PEOPLE WORK<br />
IN SEDENTARY OCCUPATIONS, ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING<br />
SPORT ISA GOOD INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY HEALTH,<br />
THE HEALTHIER OUR SOCIETY IS THE LESS DEMAND IT MA. KES<br />
ON HEALTH SERVICES.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF SPORT IS THE MOST WIDELY<br />
BECOGNISED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF SPORT.<br />
THROUGH ITS PROGRAMS THE INSTITUTE ASSISTS AND<br />
ENCOURAGES OUR MOST PROMISING SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN.<br />
THE A. I. S. HAS THE SUPPORT OF BOTH PARTIES AND IS<br />
DEVELOPING INTO A WORLD-CLASS INSTITUTION,<br />
WHAT IS TRULY REMARKABLE IS THAT IN AUSTRALIA OF ALL<br />
COUNTRIES IT TOOK SO LONG TO ESTABLISH SUCH A BODY. </p>
<p>IT IS NOW 10 YEARS SINCE THE PROPOSAL WAS FIRST<br />
ADVANCED BY THE LATE FRANK STEWART, THE MINISTER<br />
RESPONSIBLE FOR SPORT IN THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT,<br />
THE CONCEPT WAS DEVELOPED BY A STUDY GROCUP UNDER<br />
DR. ALAN COLES AND ITS REPORT WAS TABLED IN 1975.<br />
BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1980 THAT THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO SET UP THE<br />
INSTITUTE, IT WAS OPENED ONE YEAR LATER IN EARLY 1981,<br />
THE INSTITUTE WAS ESTABLISHED TO ADDRESS TWO<br />
PROBLEMS FACING YOUNG SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN.<br />
ONE WAS THAT OFTEN THEY WERE FORCED TO CHOOSE<br />
BETWEEN DEVELOPING THEIR SPORTING CAREERS AT THE<br />
EXPENSE OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS; THE OTHER,<br />
THAT IN MOST SPORTS IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO OVERSEAS<br />
TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND FIND APPROPRIATE COMPETITION.<br />
THE INSTITUTE NOW OFFERS TOP CLASS SPECIALISED COACHING<br />
IN EIGHT SPORTS.) A SPORTS/ MEDICINE SCIENCE BACK-UP, TOP<br />
CLASS COMPETITION OPPORTUNITIES IN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
OVERSEAS, AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH CANBERRA ACADEMIC<br />
AND TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONS, </p>
<p>BY ANY MEASURE, THE A. I. S, HAS ALREADY ACHIEVED MUCH,<br />
AT THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES 26 OF THE 70 GOLD MEDALS<br />
WON BY AUSTRALIANS WENT TO AIS, ATHLETES,<br />
OUR NATIONAL NETBALL TEAM, WITH WHICH THE INSTI-TUTE<br />
IS CLOSELY INVOLVED, HAS RECENTLY WON THE WORLD<br />
CHAMPIONSHIP.<br />
THAT MAGNIFICENT DISTANCE RUNNER ROBERT DE CASTELLA,<br />
WHO INSPIRED US ALL WITH HIS WIN IN THE BRISBANE<br />
MARATHON AND HAS NOW ESTABLISHED HIS DOMINANCE IN<br />
THIS EVENT WITH HIS BRILLIANTVICTORY IN ROTTERDAM,<br />
IS ALSO AT THE INSTITUTE,<br />
W'ALLY MASUR, WHO WITH PAT CASH, LOOKS SET TO<br />
RE-ESTABLISH AUSTRALIA AS A FORCE IN MEN'S TENNIS<br />
IS YET ANOTHER A. I. S. ATHLETE,<br />
OF COURSE, THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT NOTABLE SUCCESSES<br />
BY NON-A. I. S. TEAMS AND INDIVIDUALS.<br />
AND I MUST MENTION THE WORLD CHAMPION MEN'S HOCKEY<br />
TEAM WHICH IS CAPTAINED BY A MEMBER OF MY TEAM IN<br />
CANBERRA, DR. RIC CHARLESWORTH, THE LABOR MEMBER FOR<br />
PERTH. S / 6<br />
f v </p>
<p>THE INSTITUTE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT<br />
ROLE IN THIS GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO SPORT.<br />
AMONG THE ISSUES BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT RELATING<br />
TO THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF THE A. I. S. ARE:-<br />
AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SPORTS<br />
INCLUDED IN ITS PROGRAM,<br />
WHETHER MANAGEMENT OF A, I, S. FACILITIES<br />
SHOULD BE UNDER DIRECT CONTROL OF A<br />
BOARD OF MANAGEMENT OR REMAIN WITH THE,<br />
DEPARTMENT OF TERRITORIES AND LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT, AND<br />
THE POSSIBLE DE-CENTRALISATION OF SOME<br />
SPORTS PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, HOCKEY BEING<br />
SERVICED FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIA.<br />
WHILE THE AMI. S. IS THE MOST VISIBLE OF THE FEDERAL<br />
GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE TO SPORTj THERE<br />
ARE OTHER IMPORTANT PROJECTS.<br />
THERE IS THE SPORTS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES<br />
FUNDS FOR NATIONAL SPORTING BODIES TO ASSIST IN<br />
ADMINISTRATION, COACHING, INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION<br />
AND SPECIAL PROJECTS, ,/ 7 </p>
<p>ANOTHER VITAL PROGRAM IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SPORTS FACILITIES,<br />
WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE ASSISTANCE OF DISABLED<br />
ATHLETES THROUGH THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR SPORT<br />
AND RECREATION FOR THE DISABLED,<br />
NOW I WOULD NOT WANT THIS AUDIENCE TO THINK THAT<br />
OUR COMMITMENT IS LIMITED ONLY TO EXISTING AND<br />
ON-GOING PROGRAMS.<br />
AND BEFORE I OUTLINE ONE INITIATIVE THAT IS VERY<br />
CLOSE TO BECOMING A REALITY ISHOULD PAY TRIBUTE<br />
TO THE MINISTER FOR SPORT, RECREATION AND TOURISM,<br />
JOHN BROWN.<br />
OUR GOVERNMENT IS VERY FORTUNATE IN HAVING A MAN<br />
OF JOHN'S ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM IN THIS PORTFOLIO,<br />
NO DOUBT MANY OF YOU WILL ALREADY KNOW OF JOHN'S<br />
CAPACITIES AND HIS LONG-STANDING AND DEEP CONCERN<br />
ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPORT IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL VERY SOON BE IN A POSITION TO<br />
ANNOUNCE THE DETAILS OF OUR PROPOSED AUSTRALIAN SPORT<br />
COMMISSION AN INITIATIVE THAT OWES A GREAT DEAL<br />
TO JOHN BROWN. .7 </p>
<p>THE COMMISSION WILL BE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPORT IN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
WILL NOT MERELY SEEK TO DUPLICATE FUNCTIONS<br />
ALREADY ABLY CARRIED OUT BY OTHER BODIES.<br />
IT WILL HAVE AS ITS MAIUI TASK CO-ORDINATING<br />
THE NATIONAL EFFORT IN SPORT AND RECREATION<br />
AND WILL REPLACEj EVENTUALLYJ THE EXISTING SPORTS<br />
ADVISORY COUNCIL.<br />
THE COMMISSION WILL WORK WITH ALL LEVELS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT AND WITH SPORTING AND RECREATION<br />
ORGANISAT IONS.<br />
THE NEW COMMISSION WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO ISSUES<br />
THAT EMERGE IN SPORT AND RECREATION BECAUSE IT WILL<br />
BE A FLEXIBLE BODY WITH A LARGE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY.<br />
IWOULD LIKE NOW TO TURN TO AN ISSUE THAT IS OF<br />
VERY REAL CONCERN NOT JUST TO THOSE OF YOU CLOSELY<br />
INVOLVED IN SPORTj BUT TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND<br />
THAT IS THE QUESTION OF SPORTING CONTACTS WITH<br />
SOUTH AFRICA, </p>
<p>BEFORE GOING TO SOME OF THE ISSUES IN DETAIL IT<br />
IS NECESSARY TO MAKE A FEW PRELIMINARY POINTS,<br />
OUR GOVERNMENT IS FUNDAMENTALLY AND UNRESERVEDLY<br />
OPPOSED TO THE SYSTEM OF APARTHEID THAT OPERATES<br />
IN SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
THE VERY FIRM AND CLEAR STAND OUR GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
TAKEN ATTRACTS, I BELIEVE, 31-PARTISAN SUPPORT.<br />
IN FACT, DURING THE REGENT ELECTION CAMPAIGN ON A<br />
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS I COMMENDED THE GENERAL STANCE<br />
TAKEN BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT ON SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
BUT ON THE QUESTION OF SPORTING CONTACTS WITH<br />
SOUTH AFRICA SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT LED TO SOME CONFUSION AMONG SPORTSMEN AND<br />
WOMEN AND SPORTS ADMINISTRATORS.<br />
NO DOUBT YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS<br />
CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS WHOLE QUESTION WITH A<br />
VIEW TO ENDING THIS CONFUSION AND GIVING<br />
AUSTRALIAN SPORTS ORGANISATIONS AND SPORTSMEN<br />
AND WOMEN CLEAR GUIDELINES ON SPORTING CONTACTS<br />
WITH SOUTH AFRICA, ~ 1<br />
TAM,' </p>
<p>THERE CAN BE NO DEBATE ABOUT THE EXISTING BAN ON<br />
THE ENTRY OR TRANSIT THROUGH AUSTRALIA OF SOUTH<br />
AFRICAN SPORTING TEAMS THAT WILL REMAIN IN PLACE,<br />
HOWEVER, THERE ARE THREE AREAS NOW UNDER EXAMINATION<br />
WHICH ARE MORE COMPLEX AND NOT YET THE SUBJECT OF<br />
FINAL GOVERNMENT DECISIONS<br />
9 INDEED, BEFORE ANY FINAL DECISIONS ARE MADE WE WILL<br />
BE ANXIOUS TO HEAR THE VIEWS OF SPORTING ORGANISATIONS.<br />
THESE AREAS ARE:-<br />
THE ENTRY OF INDIVIDUAL SOUTH AFRICAN<br />
SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN NOT CLAIMING TO<br />
REPRESENT SOUTHi AFRICA,<br />
CONTACTS BETWEEN AUSTRALIAN AND SOUTH<br />
AFRICAN SPORTSMEN IN INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITIONS IN THIRD COUNTRIES, AND<br />
THE ENTRY To AUSTRALIA OF SPORTSMEN AND<br />
WOMEN FROM THIRD COUNTRIES WHO HAVE COMPETED<br />
AGAINST SOUTH AFRICAN TEAMS,<br />
f EACH OF THESE ISSUES WILL NEED FULL AND CAREFUL<br />
CONSIDERATION, </p>
<p>1I-.<br />
BUT WHATEVER THE DECISIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, THE<br />
END RESULT WILL BE A SYSTEM THAT IS CLEAR CUT AND<br />
LEAVES AUSTRALIAN SPORTING BODIES AND INDIVIDUALS<br />
IN NO DOUBT AS TO OUR POLICY.<br />
BEFORE I LEAVE THIS SUBJECT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE<br />
A FEW FINAL POINTS,<br />
A RECENT DEVELOPMENT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT VIEWS<br />
WITH REGRET IS THE EFFORT OF SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES<br />
TO ENCOURAGE INTERNATIONAL SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN TO COME<br />
TO THAT COUNTRY BY OFFERING LARGE FINANCIAL INDUCEMENTS.<br />
WHILE THE GOVERNMENT REGRETS THAT MANY SPORTSMEN AND<br />
WOMEN HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THESE INDUCEMENTS IT IS ALSO<br />
AWARE THAT MANY SPORTSi INCLUDING SEVERAL AUSTRALIAN<br />
SPORTING ORGANISATIONS, HAV'E REJECTED THE OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA,<br />
THEY HAVE DONE THIS EVEN THOUGH COMPETITION THERE<br />
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT LARGE FINANCIAL REWARDS TO THESE<br />
SPORTING ASSOCIATIONS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THIS ATTITUDE DESERVES THE<br />
PRAISE AND SUPPORT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, </p>
<p>IN THE END, HOWEVER, IT WILL BE FOR SPORTSMEN<br />
AND WOMEN TO EXAMINE THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES WHEN<br />
IT COMES TO PLAYING IN' SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
APARTHEID IS A MORAL ISSUE WHICH EFFECTS* EV/ ERY<br />
MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND<br />
THE SITUATION REMAINS THAT THE BASIC INJUSTICES<br />
OF THE APARTHEID SYSTEM DENIES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN OF DIFFERENT RACES IN<br />
SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
HAVING SAID ALL THAT, ' AUSTRALIA LOOKS TO THE DAY<br />
WHEN IT CAN COMPETE AGAINST THE BEST OF ALL SOUTH<br />
AFRICANS AND CAN PIT ITS ATHLETES AGAINST TEAMS<br />
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED ON THE<br />
BASIS OF MERIT AND WHO HAVE HAD THE FULLEST<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP AND DISPLAY THAT MERIT<br />
IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR RACE.<br />
IWOULD NOT LIKE TO END MY REMARKS TO YOU TONIGHT<br />
WITHOUT OFFERING SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRODUCT<br />
OF THE LABOURS OF THE SPORTS JOURNALISTS HERE TONIGHT. </p>
<p>AS A POLITICIAN, AND THEREFORE A KEEN NEWSPAPER<br />
READER, I MUST CONFESS THAT ON ONE OR TWO OCCASIONS<br />
IHAVE FOUND THE NEWS DIET MUCH MORE PALATABLE IN<br />
THE SPORTING SECTION THAN ON THE FRONT PAGES OR<br />
IN THE EDITORIAL COLUMNS,<br />
AND AS AN OCCASIONAL PUN'TER IWOULD ALSO LIKE<br />
TO THANK THOSE TURF ANALYSTS WHO HAVE INFREQUENTLY<br />
PROVIDED ME WITH A WINNER.<br />
IMUST ALSO SAY THAT THE QUALITY OF SPORTS WRITING<br />
HAS IMPROVED MARKEDLY IN RECENT YEARS AS NEWSPAPERS<br />
HAVE ADAPTED TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE<br />
INSTANTANEOUS BROADCASTING AND THE SAME DAY REPLAY<br />
OF SPORTING EVENTS.<br />
THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF THOUGHTFUL AND ENTERTAINING<br />
WqRITING AS OPPOSED TO STRICT REPORTING IN THE SPORTS<br />
PAGES OF OUR MAJOR NEWSPAPERS.<br />
THE LAST DECADE HAS ALSO SEEN A SHARP IMPROVEMENT<br />
IN THE PRESENTATION OF SPORT ON TELEVISION.<br />
PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE TELEVISION IS NOW MORE<br />
CONCERNED AS A MEDIUM WITH NEWS AND SPORT THAN<br />
ENTERTAINMENT AS A RESULT OF T-HE EXPLOSION IN THE<br />
HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY, / J14 </p>
<p>i14,<br />
WHATEVER THE REASON I THINK WE ARE ALL THANKFUL<br />
THAT THE DAYS OF THE SINGLE, FIXED CAMERA COVERAGE<br />
OF CRICKET HAS ENDED.<br />
NOR COULD WE HAVE EXPECTED TEN YEARS AGO THE<br />
MAGNIFICENT COVER OF THE BRISBANE COMMONWEALTH<br />
GAMES PROVIDED BY THE ABC.<br />
IF THERE IS ANY CRITICISM TO BE MADE OF SPORTS<br />
JOURNALISM IT IS THAT NOT ENOUGH OF YOUR RESOURCES<br />
SEEM TO BE DIRECTED TO REPORTING WHAT ARE CLASSIFIED<br />
AS MINOR'I SPORTS BUT COMMAND LARGE FOLLOWINGS<br />
( FOR EXAMPLE, NETBALL) AND TO THE COVERAGE OF<br />
WOMEN'S SPORT.<br />
OVERALL, I BELIEVE AUSTRALIANS HAVE REASON TO<br />
BE PROUD NOT JUST OF OUR SPORTING ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
AND TRADITIONS BUT OF THE SPORTS JOURNALISTS<br />
WHO COVER THESE EVENTS.<br />
AND IF OCCASIONALLY YOUR WORK RESULTS IN PUSHING<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OFF THE FRONT PAGE OR OFF THE TOP<br />
OF THE NEWS BULLETINS IWILL NOT BE TOO RESENTFUL. </p>
