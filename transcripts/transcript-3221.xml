PRIME MINISTERII PRESS STATEMENT NO. 237<br />
April 1974<br />
THE NATIONAL ESTATE REPORT<br />
The Australian Government will take action to preserve the<br />
national estate ranging from protection for natural reserves<br />
to the safeguarding of historic buildings.<br />
The basis of its planning for future action will be the<br />
report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate.<br />
The Committee has just handed its report to the Minister for<br />
Urban and Regional Development, Mr. Uren, and the Minister for<br />
Environment and Conservation, Dr. Cass.<br />
The Government has not yet had time to make final decisions<br />
on the detailed recommendations of the Committee but it supports<br />
them in principle. There are a number of matters on detailed<br />
administrative procedures and taxation questions which must be<br />
subjected to close scrutiny before any final conclusions can be<br />
reached. These are now being looked at by the Government.<br />
The Committee states as its central theme:<br />
" The Australian Government has inherited a<br />
National Estate which has been downgraded,<br />
disregarded and neglected. All previous priorities<br />
accepted at various levels of government and authority<br />
have been directed by a concept that uncontrolled<br />
development, economic growth and ' progress', and the<br />
encouragement of private as against public interest in<br />
land use, use of waters, and indeed in every part of<br />
the National Estate, was paramount".<br />
The concept of the National Estate was devised by my<br />
colleague, Mr. Tom Uren. In my policy speech in December 1972,<br />
I promised that a Labor Government would preserve and enhance<br />
the quality of the National Estate. We have acted swiftly to<br />
discharge the mandate given us to identify, conserve and present<br />
the National Estate. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In April last year, a Committee of Inquiry was appointed<br />
with Mr. Justice Hope as Chairman. The other members of the<br />
Committee were Mr. Reginald Walker, Mr. Milo Dunphy, Ms Judith<br />
Wright-McKinney, Mr. David Yencken, Mr. Keith Vallance, and<br />
Ms Judith Mary Brine.<br />
The Committee's report runs to more than 600 pages. It<br />
is now being printed and will be tabled in Parliament. Meantime,<br />
because of the interest the work of the committee has aroused, I<br />
have decided to make public the findings and recommendations of<br />
the Committee. The Australian Government is determined that our National<br />
Estate will no longer be degraded and despoiled. The Report<br />
confirms that the present Government is the firstdministration<br />
to make a commitment to identify, conserve and present the National<br />
Estate when it says:<br />
" We believe that the rapid growth in public concern,<br />
involvement and interest, means that this is among<br />
the most far-sighted decisions this Government has<br />
made and that it will be seen as such, not only by a<br />
large proportion of the electorate of today, but<br />
particularly by younger people and Australians of the<br />
future." I am pleased to see that the Report rejects the widelyaccepted<br />
notion that preservation of the environment has a<br />
socio-economic basis, that conservation is a " middle-class"<br />
issue. The Committee affirms that this assumption is not true<br />
and that the conservation of the National Estate is the concern<br />
of everyone. It punctures once and for all the illusion that<br />
the National Estate is the preserve of the privileged. The<br />
forces which threaten our National Estate often bear most heavily<br />
on the less previleged through the loss of parkland, familiar<br />
city-scapes and even dwellings. The Report makes it clear that<br />
often it is the less-privileged who are the most active in working<br />
to preserve the best features of our present way of life. The<br />
pillage and neglect of the National Estate aminishes us all in<br />
equal measure.<br />
The Committee has devoted a great deal of work to defining<br />
with precision the components of the National Estate. The breadth<br />
of the National Estate as defined by the Committee is impressivethe<br />
elements of the cultural-and natural environment which are:<br />
of such outstanding world significance that they need<br />
to be conserved, managed and presented as part of the<br />
heritage of the world;<br />
of such outstanding national value that they need to<br />
be conserved, managed and presented as part of the<br />
nation as a whole;<br />
of such aesthetic, historical, social and cultural,<br />
ecological, or other special value to the nation<br />
or any part of it, including a region or locality,<br />
that they should be conserved, managed and presented<br />
for the benefit of the community as a whole. </p>
<p>This comprehensive definition of the National Estate includes<br />
elements of remarkable diversity and richness. The range of the<br />
National Estate extends from great National Parks to such homely<br />
parts of our heritage as paddlesteamers and a Chinese Joss House.<br />
I do not want to comme nt in detail on the specific<br />
recommendations, except to say that the Government regards it<br />
as a most important and comprehensive document. The findings<br />
and recommendations will be studied most intensively in the<br />
months ahead.<br />
The Report directs particular attention to the role of the<br />
Australian Government in nurturing the National Estate. it<br />
suggests a number of new tasks which the Government should<br />
undertake. I want to make it clear that my Government has not been<br />
idle in its approach to the National Estate. Mr. Uren has<br />
announced grants for National Estate projects in all States<br />
out of a National Estate allocation of $ 2.5 million in the last<br />
Budget. Grants have also been made to assist a number of<br />
conservation groups to meet administrative costs. The<br />
Hope Committee assisted the Government in determining the<br />
allocation of these funds. Now the recommendations of the<br />
Committee will greatly assist the Government in putting National<br />
Estate financial programs on a firm and continuing basis.<br />
The work of Mr. Justice Hope and his Committee deserves<br />
the highest praise. The Government is also grateful for the<br />
help and co-operation given by State and Local Government<br />
authorities, by a host of voluntary organisations, and by<br />
hundreds of individuals in developing and refining the concept<br />
of the National Estate.<br />
The Report of the National Estate Committee is a<br />
recognition of the great physical and cultural endowment we<br />
have inherited. By acting now with firmness and decision we can<br />
ensure that future generations will not lead their lives content<br />
with what we have spoilt.<br />
