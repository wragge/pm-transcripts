PFRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 31 JANUARY, 1978<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
On this Australia Day holiday, it's good to pause and think<br />
for a moment about those things that give us a sense of<br />
national identity, of unity, a sense of pride in<br />
being Australian. It is good to stop and think about where<br />
we are heading as a nation, as one people. Of course,<br />
it is not just a question of thinking, it is also a<br />
question of acting.<br />
Like any other group of people, Australians are a product<br />
of the experiences they have had together and of the history,<br />
tradition and culture that many people have brought to<br />
us from other lands.<br />
We have been through good times. We have helped each other<br />
through tough times, through war, through depression,<br />
through flood, and again this summer through bushfires<br />
and drought. Through it all we have built roads and<br />
great cities in Australia. We have established great<br />
f actories and farms. We have set up vast mining projects<br />
in many parts of the country. We have established a<br />
whole complex civilisation in Australia, and when we get<br />
right'-down to it, Australia is one of the best places to<br />
live in and to bring up a family.<br />
We have experienced many things together. We have achieved<br />
a great deal. We share common values and aspirations: the<br />
need t4o see that Australia grows and prospers; the<br />
need to see that everyone has a fair go; a common<br />
commitment to freedom; protecting people from unfairness<br />
and injustice. But sometimes we take all of this for<br />
granted. We give too much weight to divisions and conflicts when<br />
we should be acting together for common aims and objectives.<br />
Politicians emphasise too much the differences they have<br />
with each other when they should be working to build on<br />
those things that unite us all.<br />
We all know that Australia can be made a better country,<br />
that by working together, we can create an Australia in<br />
which there is security and stability so we can plan our<br />
own and our family's future; in which there is social<br />
justice and equal opportunity for all Australians no matter<br />
what their colour, their background, or their occupation<br />
may be; dn Australia that shows care and concern for the<br />
disadvantaged and which rewards initiative and enterprise<br />
in individuals. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Your Government is commited to working for these objectives.<br />
It is part of our vision for Australia's future; to bring<br />
out the things we agree on, not allow ourselves to be<br />
distracted by partisan interests, by sectional demand.<br />
Australia is a diverse country with many different ideas,<br />
but we are agreed on the great fundamental objectives<br />
that we ought to be pursuing as a nation. We can achieve<br />
the things that tie us together. We can achieve the<br />
great ideals that we all share.<br />
This isn't just a task for Government. It is a task for<br />
all Australians. We have achieved so much working together<br />
as one people, yet so much remains to be done, nriot only<br />
for ourselves, but for those who follow. Let's work<br />
at it together. 000---</p>
