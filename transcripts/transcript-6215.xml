AL'S KA<br />
EXTRACT PRESS CONFERENCE, PERTH, 29 September 1983 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the building workers award, what<br />
they're seeking, what the Government can do what is your<br />
attitude to their present case?<br />
Are you talking in respect-of the agreement?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, I'm talking particularly in respect of the<br />
$ 7.50 per week.<br />
The Cabinet, as you know, made a clear decision as to<br />
submissions that we'll make to the Tribunal and it's appropDriate<br />
that they be put there. But in broad terms I say that we've made<br />
it clear that the agreement must be considered and in our<br />
judgement by the Commission within the framework of the<br />
National Wage Case decision. There's some idea chat it might<br />
be considered outside that and we made it quite clear that<br />
that cannot be the case. We think there are some parts of it<br />
which clearly you can say are justified within the guidelines<br />
of the decision. We think there are parts, the B. I. R. P.<br />
agreement, which is very difficult: to justify within those<br />
guidelines. And there are others which it is appropriate to<br />
have considered under the anomalies conference proceedings.<br />
And that position will be detailed by counsel before the<br />
Commnission. JOURNALIST: Will you be opposing B. I-R. P. outright?<br />
I think it's appropriate that what we're going to do<br />
before the Tribunal be said in the Tribunal. But I've given<br />
an indication of the general position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the pilots proposal of a national<br />
strike on Monday Can you say what efforts the Government<br />
is making to avert this event<br />
Well, I've had Ministers talkin$ with representatives<br />
of the pilots and they declare that we re prepared to talk<br />
but not under threat of industrial action or in a situation where<br />
they believe that the Government is going to change the basic<br />
structure of our decison in regard to superannuation. I repeat,<br />
as I've kept saying, that it's a tragedy that this highly privileged,<br />
highly paid section of the workforce., more privileged than just<br />
about any other section of the total Australian workforce in terms<br />
of hours worked and remuneration received, cannot see the same<br />
sense of reponsibility which should rest upon it as the total<br />
trade union movement has done. The ACTU constituents are<br />
overw. helmiingly made up of people that are less fortunately placed<br />
than the pilots. They took the course, the responsible course / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
( cont.): of action, of working with the Government, of<br />
talking with the Government, and in that process as in earlier<br />
discussions with the pilots we were prepared to amend as we<br />
indicated we would do certain elements of the announced<br />
intention to meet specific problems that were raised by them.<br />
Now it didn't meet all. the requirements of the ACTU unians,<br />
but they took the view that they had a sense of responsibility<br />
which ought to be discharged and the Congress of the ACTU<br />
accepted the position that industrial action should not be<br />
taken. Now let the pilots' leaders understand that they are<br />
out of step with the trade union movement as a whole, ( b)<br />
they are out of step with the community. And I believe<br />
increasingly if they pursue this suicidal action they'll be<br />
seen to be out of step with their own membership.<br />
JOUPRNALIST: How do you propose to deal with the strike?<br />
P. M. Well there is no strike yet. </p>
