FEDERAL COUNCIL OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Held at the Hotel Canberra, Canberra, ACT 1CFPH OCTOB3ER., 1966<br />
Mr. President and Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It's a matter of very great pride, I assure -you, Mr. President,<br />
to have this privilege of addressing Council for the first time as Prime<br />
Minister. My association with the Liberal Party, of course, goes back to<br />
its formation. It has been a matter of continuing regret for me that I can't<br />
claim to have been one of the founding fathers who met at Albury on that<br />
historic occasion, but I think I can justly claim to have been the first Member<br />
of Parliament to have risen to his feet at a public gathering and declared<br />
himself a supporter of the new party. And so my association goes back to the<br />
formation of the Liberal Party, and it is not inappropriate that having had, I<br />
think, seven years as de facto Chairman of the Policy Committee, entrusted<br />
to that task by m y former distinguished predecessor, I should have had this<br />
closest of associations with liberalism from the outset.<br />
Indeed, I really begin to think about my advancing years when I<br />
recall that I am the only -member of the Liberal section of the Cabinet to have<br />
been in the Cabinet at the time of its formation in 1949, and to have been in<br />
the Parliament, of course, for many years before that. Perhaps it makes one<br />
a better Liberal to have been active in the Parliament in the days when<br />
there were no Liberals with a capital and very few with a small<br />
certainly on our side of politics, at any rate.<br />
I see it as a matter of pride, Mr. President, because one could<br />
hardly conceive an organisatlon which more effectively allowed a government<br />
and a party to express itself in terms of its political policies and aspirations.<br />
If you were to be looking around the world for a model of the relationship<br />
which should exist between a parliamentary party and an organisation which<br />
had developed to support the principles of that party and to assist with its<br />
policy, thenl know of no better model that I could recommend than the Liberal<br />
Party of Australia. Here we have been able to build on experience which the founders<br />
of the party possessed. We have the greatest asset of all, perhaps, in a<br />
philosophy of liberty, of freedom, of personal initiative, of free enterprise<br />
and I say this is a priceless asset because if one is faced with a difficult<br />
problem in the political sphere, if you ca n turn to the principles and<br />
philosophy of liberalism, then that particular problem becomes so much the<br />
easier to resolve. It's a great advantage we possess over our political<br />
opponents. They have no policy, no philosophy for the modern, growing,<br />
expanding, exciting enterprising Australia of these times. They have a<br />
musty, doctrinaire, obsolete policy of which they seem to be thoroughly<br />
ashamed at election time.<br />
I recall that in recent elections, Mr. Calwell has undertaken<br />
that the policy won't be resorted to for at least three years. How can one<br />
subscribe wholeheartedly to a political policy and programme if you are not<br />
prepared to go out and fight wholeheartedly for the philosophy and policies<br />
of your own party. But that is where the AustralianLabor Party stands today,<br />
as I hope to exemplify to you in one or two instances as I go along. It seems<br />
to be suffering from a sort of schizophrenia. It starts off with an attitude / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
and refuses to follow through the logical consequences of the attitude it has<br />
adopted. I have just put that in the broad at this stage. I shall hope to<br />
illustrate it for you as I go along, but it would be well if outside this<br />
particular room and far beyond, the delegates and branches from which they<br />
come, and the State Divisions from which they come, if there were a<br />
realisation throughout Australia that here you have in the Liberal Party, a<br />
parliamentary party working in the closest and warmest, friendliest<br />
of co-operation with its political organisation. It is a live and vital political<br />
organisatiori, able to assist us in our policy determinations by the very<br />
effective work of our joint policy committee of whom half the members are<br />
drawn from the Parliamentary party, and others from the State Divisions and<br />
assisted by the policy discussion of our annual council meetings.<br />
What a contrast:. Here, no attempt to dictate to those who<br />
have been elected by the people to serve them in the Parliament, but a<br />
partnership in which there is discussion, there is persuasion, there is<br />
co-operation, but never at any point in the history of the party has there been<br />
attempt at dictation to those whom the people have elected. We have always<br />
recognised inside this Liberal Party that the final responsibility must rest<br />
with the parliamentary party and in those States where we have the<br />
opportunity to govern at this time, the responsibility with that government,<br />
assisted but not compelled by the organisation of which we form a part. There<br />
is nothing faceless about you, Sir ( turuing to the President) nor those around<br />
us. I was just going to make the comment that there are some rather<br />
distinguished, certainly handsome faces to be found around the room, and I<br />
would want for no better manifesto than to have a series of photographs of<br />
those wvho comprise the advisers to the Liberal Party through its organisation<br />
and those who for themselves claim the right to tell the parliamentarians In<br />
the Labor Party just what their policy should be and how they should vote.<br />
One of the encouraging things about the Liberal Party of these<br />
days is the forward-looking character of its policies and of its membership.<br />
It is not surprising, although certainly this hasn't been the historical<br />
experience of the past, that a younger generation of Australians is turning to<br />
the Liberal Party rather than the traditional turning to the left of a younger<br />
generation. I had an interesting confirmation of this, rather indirectly, in<br />
a document which reached me from the Students' Representative Council of<br />
Victoria following a referendum conducted on the issue of National Service.<br />
Now, not surprisingly, there wasn't a large university percentage vote for<br />
National Service. I am a former university student myself, with a fair idea<br />
of how I would have noted In f act, the particular scheme of National Service<br />
which operated in my time was no more popular than that which operates at<br />
the present time. I will have something to say on National Service before I<br />
conclude. But the point which intrigued me in this document was that<br />
they analysed the voting attitudes and then related them to the political<br />
outlook of the students concerned. They gave the precise figures. Those<br />
who supported the Liberal or Liberal and Country Party totalled 1, 179.<br />
Those who supported the Australian Labor Party 671. Those who supported<br />
the Democratic Labor Party 221; the Communist Party 20 I was glad to see;<br />
undecided 501. But it was rather revealing that, despite the unpopularity<br />
with them of National Service, there were still 1, 179 of them prepared to<br />
vote for the Liberal Party as against 671 for the Australian Labor Party.<br />
When you throw in the Democratic Labor Party, which on these issues of<br />
Viet Nam and National Service strongly support the Government policies, you<br />
will see that the combined vote just about doubles the vote for the ALP and<br />
this from the younger, intelligent area of the Australian community as<br />
reflected in these particular educational institutions. I thought it was<br />
certainly informative and encouraging. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I want now to say a word or two about National Service.<br />
In the address I give you tonight it would not be practicable to cover the<br />
many issues we will be discussing in the course of the election campaign.<br />
So I have selected a few which are highly controversial and on which we have<br />
a clear view and attitude ourselves, and I hope we can rely upon your staunch<br />
support on. these as we move into the campaign.<br />
But let me say a word or two about National Service.<br />
Perhaps I should preface it by saying that one of the features of our political<br />
experience at this time is that we have to learn to live with our geography.<br />
In my early days in Parliament, our attention was concentrated on the<br />
British Isles and the countries of Western Europe. To a much lesser degree<br />
the United States of America came into the picture. But for most of us in<br />
those earlier years the countries to the north of Australia represented some<br />
rather picturesque stamps in an album without very much else beigg known<br />
about them. They just didn't enter into the scheme of things. Our trade with<br />
them was small, our contacts with them quite minor. Those who could<br />
afford the price of a journey overseas spoke of going " home", by which they<br />
meant the British Isles, and two or three weeks on the " Gontinong" that was<br />
about all their ambitions ran to. If you could come back with a suitcase<br />
absolutely covered with labels of all the fancy hotels you had stayed at that<br />
was a memorable phase in a lifetime.<br />
But we have become increasingly conscious over recent<br />
years and made very conscious of it at the time of Pearl Harbour that<br />
destiny had placed Australia in a world very different and alien to the kind<br />
of world we formerly lived in. We were a European projection into the<br />
Southern Hemisphere, but it became obvious that we had to begin pretty<br />
smartly to think of ourselves as geographically, at any rate, part of the<br />
Asian scene. This now presents to us some of the most exciting and<br />
promising potentialities for the future of this country. One has only to study<br />
what has happened in the way of trade over recent years. The nominal<br />
trade we had with Japan in the years following the war, even in the early<br />
1950' s, was not great. Today it is more than four and a half times what<br />
it was in the early 1950' s yet both we and the JApanese believ e that we are<br />
really still living on the threshold of the trade experience that will develop<br />
between our countries. Australia is a great supplier of foodstuffs, raw<br />
materials, and yet with a manufacturing capacity which, on some items, will<br />
enable us to compete in the markets of the world.<br />
In the motoring industry, the products of General Motors and<br />
other companies have been successfully sold around the world in competition<br />
with those produced by countries with a longer experience in this field than<br />
ourselves. If we can hang on to our price levels and our costs, then although<br />
as far ahead as any of us can see we will be relying upon our primary industries<br />
for the major part of our export income, we can still conduct ourselves in a<br />
manner to be competitive on some of our manufactured items.<br />
But speaking of our place in the geography of Asia, part of<br />
the background may be seen In respect of what we have done in Viet Nam and<br />
about the National Service Scheme which has become associated with it.<br />
Why are we in Viet Nam? We are not there because we are trailing along<br />
at the coat-tails of the United States of America. Three Presidents of the<br />
United States, one after the other, have decided that it is of importance' that<br />
their country should be giving assistance in the struggle in Viet Nam. I have<br />
said before and I say it again, that when President Johnson succeeded the late<br />
President Kennedy, the greatest concern I felt as an Australian Minister in<br />
the national Government was that under this new Administration, the<br />
Americans might decide that they were going to pull out of the struggle in<br />
Viet Nam because, in my thinking, Australia's security is far more<br />
directly involved than that of the United States itself. The United States .* 9/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
wants to see the kind of world in which aggression does not pay off; but for<br />
Australia, looking at the long-term consequences of successful communist<br />
penetration into South Viet Nam, there could be no security for as far ahead<br />
as we can see. It would have been a disaster of the first magnitude if it had<br />
occurred. So I hope that when we have the privilege of welcoming the present<br />
leader of the American people it will not be out of our minds that his own firm<br />
resolution and determination and clear -sightedness have kept the Americans in<br />
Viet Nam and now looks like carrying the allied forces and the South Vietnamese<br />
people either to a victory or a position of strength in which negotiations can<br />
be carried out for the benefit of the people of South Viet Nam and for the<br />
greater security of Asia as a whole.<br />
I stress this because first of all there is a disposition to think<br />
that this was all President Johnson's idea. But he is the third President in<br />
a row to have felt this way about South Viet Nam. In the same way, some<br />
people think it is my bright idea to have troops in South Viet Nam. Well, my<br />
distinguished predecessor had no doubts in his mind as to the course Australia<br />
should follow; nor did his Cabinet; nor do my supporters. I don't know any<br />
item of policy on which I could claim that the two Government parties are more<br />
firmly united than they are on the issues both of our presence in South Viet<br />
Nam and the National Service component which we -have found it necessary to<br />
Introduce into the regular military forces of this country.<br />
We take up unflinchingly the challenge which Mr. Galwell<br />
repeatedly throws down to us that the main issues of this forthcoming election<br />
are to be the Government's policy in South Viet Nam, our presence there, and<br />
the introduction of National Service with some of our national servicemen<br />
forming part of regular units taking their place in Viet Nam. This particular<br />
policy of National Service was adopted after the Government had taken the<br />
decision to build up the strength of the Regular Army. The current goal is<br />
000 or thereabouts. It was taken after repeated efforts had been made to<br />
recruit volunteers up to the number desired. But with well-paid jobs plentiful<br />
in Australia, the response was quite inadequate when the Army's high<br />
rejection rate was taken into account. I don't complain myself about the high<br />
rejection rate the Army maintains. There is a very good reason for insisting<br />
on a high standard. Australia, which can ill-afford any extravagance in the<br />
use of its manpower, needs a highly efficient, mobile, well-equipped regular<br />
force capable of being placed to the best national advantage. And it must be<br />
stressed because the implications of this . never seem to enter the skulls<br />
of our political opponie nts that National Servicemen are integrated into<br />
units of the Regular Army.<br />
Now just view this against the Labor Party policy, which Mr.<br />
Cal~ vell and his supporters proclaim, of withdrawing National Servicemen<br />
immediately from Viet Nam and then bringing back the remainder later,<br />
after we have had discussions with our allies. I would like to be a fly on<br />
the wall while the discussions with our allies take place, We might need an<br />
interpreter there to sort out what some of them are saying. But I think the<br />
Americans could express themselves in pretty blunt terms.<br />
There is a sort of schizophrenia about the Labor Party and its<br />
policy attitudes, because I don't think they can be oblivious to the importance<br />
to Australia's security of resisting communist aggression, yet they seem to<br />
be quite unmindful of the consequences to Australia's treaty arrangements if<br />
this sort of policy was pursued. The truncated units would be incapable of<br />
performing effectively. Those that remained behind would be, for most<br />
practical purposes, out of action until units could be reformed, presumably with<br />
reinforcements of regular volunteers to be sent from Australia. Australia<br />
would play a quite inglorious role as this adjustment went on. While our<br />
allies were doing the j ob of resisting aggression and helping to clear the<br />
* 0 111/ 5 </p>
<p>Viet Cong and the Ncrth Vietniamese-out of-areas-of South Viet Nam as<br />
their military successes developed, there presumably would be Australian<br />
units, truncated to a substantial degree, just sitting there and waiting for<br />
some rebuild in their strength. But why rebuild them in strength if you<br />
are going to hold discussions with your allies about taking them out at the<br />
first available opportunity.<br />
This seems almost incredible in a country whose shield is the<br />
strength of ANZUS and when the strength of ANZUS is the strength of the<br />
United States of America. No-one has any doubt in their minds about that.<br />
But it is almost incredible that this one sure source of our strength should<br />
be so recklessly destroyed by a Labor Party incapable of seeing Australia's<br />
interest in straightforward and direct terms. Can we ever imagine an<br />
alliance with the United States would be the same again if Australia, a party<br />
to ANZUS and SEATO, behaved in this fashion? Yet this is the Labor Party<br />
of today. It is c o chance event that they should adopt this kind of attitude<br />
to National Service. They were only able by the narrowest of margins to<br />
muster minimal approval for the North-West Cape station, and even then on<br />
terms which, had they been in government, I am sure the United States<br />
would have found unacceptable.<br />
There is another interesting matter to which I would direct<br />
your attention. It arose out of the action of Mr. Sam Benson, the Member<br />
for Batman, in accepting his expulsion from the Labor Party because of<br />
his membership of the Defence Action Committee. He made a most<br />
interesting revelation which resolved what had been something of a mystery<br />
in my own thinking. That was the occasion of the invitation to a delegation<br />
of six Labor men to visit Singapore, an invitation issued by the Premier of<br />
Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br />
He had been down here as a guest of the government a short<br />
time before, and frankly, it had seemed a little odd at the time that he should<br />
issue an invitation to half a dozen members of the Labor Party to go and<br />
visit Singapore. But Mr. Benson has now given us the reason, and he says<br />
that they were invited because Mr. Lee wanted to tell them how disturbed<br />
he was by the attitude of the Labor Party to Viet Nam, because, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, don't imagine we are the only people who are concerned about<br />
the treatyin Viet Nam.<br />
If you read the statements of the spokesmen of such countries<br />
as Thailand, the Philippines, or the countries on the periphery of Asia and<br />
Malaysia also you will find there a general concern and acceptance of the<br />
threat which is posed to them. What for some people may be a rather<br />
academic " domino" theory of one country going after the other is regarded<br />
as very far from academic in the eyes of the leaders of the countries I<br />
have just mentioned. And Mr. Lee and I am quoting Mr. Benson's version now, not<br />
my own got them there to tell them how concerned Singapore was that if<br />
Viet Nam fell, Singapore would feel gravely threatened. They were expected<br />
to pass this information on to their colleagues in order that there might be<br />
a more realistic appreciation of the threat to this area of the world.<br />
Accordi ng to Mr. Benson, he did discuss this matter with his own branches,<br />
but, again according to him, as far as he was aware, no other member of<br />
that delegation did so, nor have they uttered anything publicly since then<br />
which would have conveyed any inkling that this was the story put to them in<br />
Singapore. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
I think they had a responsibility, if that story was put to them<br />
in Singapore, to make it known, whether they approved of it or not. At<br />
least it was a contribution to the discussion the store of knowledge we had<br />
in relation to this area.<br />
Now some people find National Service according to their<br />
description of it as immoral or undemocratic. But have they studied<br />
anything of history? If they have, they would appreciate that it is of the<br />
essence of democracy that people should give service to their own country'<br />
when the need arises. Several of the most solidly-established democracies in<br />
the world have maintained their own systems of National Service, including<br />
the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, Greece, France, the Netherlands,<br />
just a few of the countries that one could mention.<br />
I want to say a word or two about our decision to include aliens<br />
in the National Service scheme. This was only taken after a good deal of<br />
thought and considerable diplomatic discussion with their representatives<br />
here and in their own countries. But what must be remembered and I<br />
think this distinguishes the Australian position from that of most other<br />
countries is that the immigration programme has brought hundreds of<br />
thousands of settlers from foreign countries to Australia. There are, for<br />
example, in Australia approximately 270, 000 people of Italian origin,<br />
130, 000 of Greek origin and more than 11,30, 000 from the Netherlands.<br />
Surely it is not unreasonable that the quite limited number of nationals from<br />
these countries who would be called up for National Service should make a<br />
contribution to the security of a nation which has provided new opportunities<br />
and a prospering existence for so many tens of thousands of their fellow<br />
nationals. Or is it expected that the &amp; fence of this half million people I<br />
have just referred to should be solely the responsibility of native-born<br />
Australians? It must not be overlooked that for those who feel so strongly<br />
about National Service and wish to avoid it, there is the option of joining<br />
the Citizen Military Forces, provided that they enlist in the CMF before<br />
the ballot inducting them into National Service is held. Aliens have the same<br />
option to join the GMF. They have even longer to make up their minds<br />
because they have to be two years in the country or aged 21 before they<br />
become subject to the call-up. In the last extremity, any alien who feels<br />
so strongly about this that he would prefer to leave the country before being<br />
called up is permitted to do so.<br />
Now let me just say something about the economy. This is always<br />
a matter of interest to governments and to the individual citizen. The<br />
Australian economy, throughout our period of office, has been pointed<br />
firmly in the direction of development and rapid. national growth. Indeed,<br />
we point to the greatest era in Australian development which has occurred<br />
since the Liberal Country Party coalition came Into office at the end of<br />
1949, and it is our determina tion that this national expansion shall continue.<br />
It has been affected in its pace in recent times, first by the factor of defence<br />
and secondly by the incidence of drought on a severe scale in New South<br />
Wales and Queensland. Defence has been a major preoccupation of the<br />
GJvernment for the past three years. We have had to cope with the challenge<br />
presented by Indonesian confrontation of Malaysia and communis t aggression<br />
in Viet Nam. We have certain responsibilities, not only in relation to our<br />
home defence but for the security of Papua and New Guinea. Confrontation<br />
has receded, but the struggle in Viet Nam still goes on. We have never<br />
allowed this preoccupation with defence to diminish our interest in the<br />
condition and progress of the economy, or to weaken our determination to<br />
push on with expansion in its manifold aspects. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
I would like to remind you that Australia's attempts at<br />
national growth have met with serious obstructions, particularly in the<br />
course of this century. It is worth reflecting on this because the United<br />
States of America declared its independence in 1776, just twelve years<br />
before the founding of the first settlement in Australia. At that time, the<br />
population of the United States was less than 4 million people. Today it<br />
is over 190 million people. We are still hoping to reach the 12 million<br />
mark. The major factors which held back Australian progress were the<br />
two world wars and the depression of the 1930' s. This little country,<br />
as it then was of less than 7 million people, sustained half a million<br />
casualties in two world wars. We lost more people killed in the first world<br />
war than the United States. This must never happen again while we can do<br />
anything to avoid such a national catastrophe.<br />
The policy which the Government has been pursuing, the<br />
programme of National Service and the build-up of regular armed forces,<br />
are the things which can do more to save a needless loss of Australian<br />
lives than simply relying on a response In times of emergency of volunteers<br />
to meet a critical situation.<br />
' Th is is not a Government of warmongers. It is not a Government<br />
which is unmindful or regardless of young Australian lives or young<br />
Australian opportunities. We are here to conserve these things, but to<br />
conserve them by policies which ensure that Australia will be able to play<br />
an honourable and effective part in the security of the general area in which<br />
we live, but which will not be looked to to pour In hundreds of thousands of<br />
relatively untrained young Australian manhood should some critical<br />
situation develop there. Have this in your minds as the critics turn on the<br />
scheme which we have developed. Ask them what is their alternative.<br />
What is the Labor Party's alternative to the schemes that we have for the<br />
defence of this country? I have heard Mr. Calwell talk about the fresh-faced<br />
boys that are brought in under the National Service Scheme. Does he<br />
realise how many of the volunteers were younger and are younger than the<br />
men we are bringing in under the National Service Scheme? What is<br />
their policy on these matters? I invite you to say, " I have listened to them<br />
closely and I have no clear mind as to where the Labor Party stands" Nor<br />
do they, because each member seems to have a different interpretation and<br />
a different view of what Labor is proposing to do.<br />
Now we have had a quite acute economic problem of diverting<br />
resources on a considerable scale for defence purposes without interrupting<br />
the strong even flow of economic growth. I believe that we can claim that<br />
we have made this adjustment with skill. I pay a tribute, as I am sure<br />
my colleague the Treasurer would, to the splendid advisers we have in<br />
the Treasury of this country, men who are honoured throughout the<br />
financial world all around the world. We have been able, therefore, to<br />
conrbine development and national growth with a stability which has provided<br />
us with some of the soundest foundations of any economy to be found around<br />
the world. The economy has taken on board a really big defence effort.<br />
Expenditure this year estimated at 000 million is more than double that<br />
of 1.962/ 63. This has been done without seriously retarding essential<br />
growth and without producing a selous inflation. Our current stability<br />
reflects the strength, the resilience and adaptability of an economic<br />
structure which rests on firmer foundations than have e ver before existed.<br />
Our external position remains strong and with the favourable<br />
seasonal trend, we should have a big export income. In the years ahead,<br />
the development efforts which have been put into mineral, beef and other<br />
primary production should be coming in in support of an enlar ged export<br />
s / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
income.. Discoveries of oil and gas should also relieve to some degree<br />
our dependence on imports. While we appreciate the capabilities of our<br />
economy, we should never underrate the difficulties of bringing great<br />
developments to pass and keeping growth going steadily and strongly up<br />
to the full physical limits of our usable resources. This is a task which<br />
calls for intelligent foresight, careful forecasting and intensive day to day<br />
studies of the immediate trend of things. We know very well how quickly,<br />
and at times dramatically, a promising situation can take a turn for the<br />
worse. As the year proceeds, the economy should feel the effect of the<br />
higher average weekly earnings now being received and the stimulus of<br />
demand from higher farm incomes.<br />
The employment situation has held well. We watch this closely,<br />
of course, at all times since we have the responsibility not merely of keeping<br />
an existing work force fully employed but adding to their number year by<br />
year as the new army of school-leavers becomes available and the Immigration<br />
programme adds its massive contribution. This year, the potential<br />
increase has been reckoned at 120, 000 which will require a rise of about<br />
3 -per cent. in our civil employment for the year. To cover an increase<br />
of that magnitude there -has to be, among other things, a substantial<br />
increase in manufacturing employment, and for that reason In particular,<br />
we have been keeping a close watch on the trend of consumer spending<br />
which is the largest determinant of activity in the manufacturing sector.<br />
Recent figures of building approvals suggest that dwelling<br />
construction is going along extremely well. It is worth noting that approvals<br />
for other forms of building showed a sharp dip earlier this year, ran at<br />
quite high level for some months thereafter; they showed some fall in<br />
August and the latest figures are again promising.<br />
Our holdings of gold and exchange are over 200 million and<br />
we have behind them untouched drawing rights with the International<br />
Monetary Fund to the order of $ 600 million. In such basic respects as<br />
these, there are good grounds for confidence in the general trend of the<br />
economy. Difficulties can, of course, arise. Such as, for example, the<br />
sugar industry which has been affected at the present time by the disastrously<br />
low price for sugar on world markets.<br />
The motor car industry is passing through a difficult phase, and<br />
these situations have to be closely watched and where necessary, met as<br />
they occur, just as we met the drought situation through last year. If at<br />
any time we judge the general position of the economy to be slower than<br />
is desirable, we will not hesitate to take expansive measures adequate to<br />
meet the needs of that situation.<br />
Now the final thing I want to mention, and I wil I do so much more<br />
briefly than the subject deserves, is the contrast in attitude between our own<br />
Government, with its view of an expanding Australia, and that of our<br />
Opposition on the subject of overseas investment. Again this schizophrenia<br />
shows up because the Labor Party is wholeheartedly behind the immigration<br />
programme they are all for importing people but they refuse, apparently,<br />
to accept the consequences. If you import people, if you are to give them<br />
employment as well as to sustain the pace of your own economy, then you<br />
must also import capital, and I for one am not afraid of the consequences<br />
of importing capital. On the contrary, I am quite convinced that apart<br />
from its economic benefits, it adds to the security of this country. If tiere<br />
is 000 million of investment from the United Kingdom or from the United<br />
States, as the figures roughly suggest at this time, then there are thousands<br />
of dollars of good reasons why they liave a pretty strong interest in the / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
welfare and security of Australia. This country can't hope to defend itself<br />
in the area in which we find ourselves with 100 million restless, turbulent<br />
people just above us in Indonesia and all the ferment and yeasting that is<br />
going on in Asia at this time, simply of our own resources. If me attempted<br />
to do so, you could put up the shutters on a deveic pment programme for<br />
this country. And here we are building great industries, new skills, new<br />
techniques, opening up avenues of employment for our people, opening up<br />
sources of revenue for the Commonwealth Government which it in turn can<br />
devote either to the assistance of the States or the welfare of the Australian<br />
people in defence, social services, or any one of a multitude of avenues to<br />
which our f inances can be usefully directed. We are told there must be an<br />
Australian equity and I like to see Australians putting their savings into<br />
these ventures where they can. We are not a thriftless people. There is<br />
only one country in the world which applies a higher percentage of its gross<br />
national income to capital investment than Australia and that is Japan. We<br />
invest 27 per cent. of ours, against 17 per cent. in the United States and<br />
per cent. in the United Kingdom. Ninety per cent, of our investment is from<br />
an Australian source. That extra 10 per cent, is what helps to make us grow<br />
at a more rapid pace than we could contrive for ourselves. And If these<br />
industries prosper, then we take a large Australian equity from them in the<br />
form of 42-2 per cent, of their profits, and if they want to remit dividends<br />
overseas, 15 per cent. of tax on those remitted dividends.<br />
All around Australia you can see the evidence of the growth this<br />

per cent of their profits, and they have, over recent years, exported overseas<br />
to a greater value than the remittances they send overseas, so there has been<br />
no suffering to our external balances.<br />
Look at the transformation David Brand will tell you about it<br />
occurring in his State with the great investment there in mineral development<br />
which will help to build an Australian export Income in the years ahead.<br />
We are lucky that most of this investment is coming to us from big countries<br />
with which our people readily assimilate, and the executives from those<br />
countries who come out here readily assimilate in Australia. If any of my<br />
State colleagues have had an experience of being pushed around by any of<br />
these people, I would like to hear of it from them. I never have, and I don't<br />
believe that they have. The capital, once it comes here, almost wli-hout<br />
exception, beds down and adjusts itself to Australian policy, Australian<br />
philosophy and helps to serve the Australian people.<br />
Well, I have mentioned these things, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
becaus~ e they are in the realm of public discussion at this time. I have only<br />
sketched some of the answers to them. But my final word to you Is that this<br />
great Liberal Party has a tremendous and continuing national responsibility.<br />
Nobody in his senses, looking at Labor In disarray, with a team I ncapable<br />
of giving Australia the government it needs in these times, could imagine<br />
Labor in office for years to come. We havc. had the responsibility ofleading<br />
Australia through these new, enterprising, adventurous years of the<br />
post-war period when a new chapter has openecd in the history of this country<br />
and that chapter is by no means concluded. There is a new era of change<br />
which we have to recognise, the explosive, difficult, delicate issue of raceto<br />
which we have to adjust ourselves, live with -n this area of the world, both<br />
as members of an Asian region and as members of a Commonwealth of nations<br />
in which these days there are only four of the old members left, out of a<br />
total of 23 to be expanded to 26 in a few months' time. We have to tread </p>
<p>lCour<br />
way carefully, delicately, but at the same time when occasion demands it,<br />
firmly, in this kind of company. Now, can anybody conceive that the Labor<br />
Party, as at present constituted, can do that task for Australia? Of course<br />
not, and so the responsibility rests with us and rests in particular with the<br />
Liberal Party to give the leadership that the nation requires. Each and every<br />
one of us, whether we are members of the Parliamentary party, whether in<br />
the organisation itself, whether we come from a State Division on its executive<br />
or from one of its branches, has a contribution to make, not only to the<br />
Liberal Party but through the Liberal Party to the welfare and security of<br />
Australia. A n d it is because I believe that most fervently I am proud to<br />
have the honour of your Parliamentary leadership, and I hope in that leadership<br />
that you and I and my own team together will write new chapters of<br />
Australian history of which succeeding generations of Australians will be<br />
fully proud. </p>
