PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 DECEMBER 1989<br />
The Prime Minister flew to Newcastle late this afternoon to<br />
assess first hand the situation resulting from today's<br />
earthquake. He earlier sent the following two messages:<br />
" 1MESSAGE TO NEWCASTLE WORKERS' CLUB<br />
I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the families<br />
and friends of those affected by the earthquake damage to<br />
the Workers' Club. The loss of life and the injuries in<br />
this appalling event are truly tragic and the thoughts of<br />
all Australians will be with you and with all the citizens<br />
of Newcastle today."<br />
" ALDERMAN JOHN MC NAUGHTON<br />
LORD MAYOR OF NEWCASTLE<br />
Like all Australians I was most distressed to hear the news<br />
today of the devastating earthquake in the Newcastle area<br />
and the loss of life, injuries and extensive damage to<br />
property which resulted.<br />
I wish to express my deepest sympathy to all involved.<br />
Lionel Bowen, the Attorney-General will be visiting<br />
Newcastle to assess the situation and to advise me on it,<br />
but I want to let you know straight away that the full<br />
resources of the Australian Defence Force will be available<br />
through the National Disasters Organisation to assist the<br />
State Emergency Services in handling the situation should<br />
they judge that necessary." </p>
