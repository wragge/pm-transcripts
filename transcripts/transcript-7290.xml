PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
The Government will amend the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority Act early in the Autumn Sittings of Parliament to<br />
ensure that the Australian Bicentennial Authority ( ABA) is<br />
subject to the Freedom of Information ( FOI), Ombudsman and<br />
Archives Acts.<br />
Recent Opposition allegations that the Government is<br />
attempting to hide something by exempting the ABA from the<br />
coverage of the FOI Act are completely without foundation.<br />
The simple fact is that a regulation was passed last<br />
December which arose from an Attorney-General's Department<br />
opinion that an earlier regulation subjecting the ABA to the<br />
FOI Act was invalid.<br />
The Government has decided to put the entire matter beyond<br />
doubt once and for all, by amending the ABA Act specifically<br />
to bring the ABA under the FOI, Ombudsman and Archives Acts.<br />
This course has the full support of the Authority which has<br />
not sought exemption from these Acts. It has responded and<br />
will continue to respond to requests as though the FOI Act<br />
applied. 004416<br />
