FOR PRESS: PM. No. 98/ 1971<br />
SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William McMahon.<br />
I have been informed that the Labor Party opposes significant<br />
parts of the Bills relating to Mr Justice Kerr's rec~ ommendations on<br />
salaries and allowances for members of the Commnonwealth Parliament.<br />
In my statement in the House on 16 September, I said that the<br />
Government had decided that there should be an enquiry into<br />
Parliamentary salaries and allowances.<br />
The Laad~ r of tne Opposition, in reply, said that the opposition<br />
had suggested, arid it supported, the approach which the Government<br />
had adopted. The Leader of the Opposition complimented me on having<br />
sought and secured the services of a Judge of such distinction in<br />
industrial matters.<br />
Hitherto there has been a non-party approach to these issues<br />
and it was implicit in the Leader of the opposition's statement of<br />
16 September that this approach would be followed on this occasion.<br />
The reported new attitude of the Labor Party is a breach of<br />
this approach. In these circumstances, the Government reserves<br />
the right to take whatever action it considers desirable.<br />
