EMBARGOA.-. 2.15pm<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 10 MAY 1982<br />
1982 AUSTRALIAN LTBERAL STUDENTS'<br />
FEDERATION CONFERENCE<br />
It is a great pleasure to be with you to open the 1982 annual<br />
conference of the ALSF. You have a broad agenda, ranging,<br />
as I understand, from airfares to education policy, from<br />
student unionism to foreign policy and defence issues and I<br />
am sure you will have a productive conference,.<br />
It is well known that the ALSF accocmodates : a variety of<br />
views within its membership. That is the essence of Liberalism,<br />
just as it is of. the essence of the. inizersity ideal. But<br />
the ALSF also has another great strength, its commitment to<br />
standing up for what it believes in and its determination to<br />
work eff6ctively and persistently to achieve its priorities.<br />
One of the great causes for which the ALSF has fought and for<br />
which it continues-to fight is voluntary student unionism.<br />
You have fought for the right of students to choose freely<br />
whether or not they wish to belong to a union. Whether or<br />
not they wish to pay student union fees without fearing that<br />
their student status will be threatened.<br />
In this campaign, especially in relation to eliminating the<br />
diversion of compulsory fees for socio-political activities<br />
you have the full support of the Federal Government.<br />
The Government has implemented a nuiber of measures designed<br />
to guarantee voluntary student unionism in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and I hope the time will come when your<br />
.: continuing campaign will be successful throughout Australia.<br />
Voluntary student unionism is. bbviously a vital part of freedom A<br />
in education, so is that freedom of expression which the<br />
ALSF has championed on tertiary campuses throughout Australia.<br />
Freedom in the widest sense is the cornerstone of the ALSF.<br />
Indeed, it is the overriding priority and objective which<br />
binds together all Liberals. Freedom is the great ideal<br />
which positions us on the political spectrum. It is the<br />
basis of our rejection of the conformity and oppressive<br />
levelling of socialism and the reason for our commitment<br />
to a society which encourages individuals to pursue their own<br />
goals and -aspirations to the fullest extent of their ability. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We also need to remember that influences which threaten<br />
prosperity are in the end threats to freedom itself.<br />
I know the ALSF does not take freedom for granted, that<br />
you. realise it must be worked for and defended. But too<br />
many people do take freedom easily, they accept it, they<br />
take advantage of its benefits, and the prosperity which<br />
it has created in Australia without realising that it<br />
creates responsibilities, and that it cannot exist without<br />
being defended.<br />
As Liberals, we obviously have freedom as our central ideal.<br />
But we should remember that freedom also provides a basis<br />
for practical policies, and for our analysis of what the real<br />
issues are.<br />
I want to talk today about the real issues for Australia as<br />
we look down the months and the years ahead. For in spite<br />
of our comparative prosperity, in spite of the comparative<br />
stability andsecurity which we enjoy in Australia, there are<br />
real and fundamental threats abroad in the world to the values<br />
and the way of life which we enjoy and which we believe in.<br />
In concrete texis, those threats are essentially strategic and<br />
economic. To cope with them, Western societies need resolve<br />
and imagination to build up effective responses and practical<br />
policies. I want to talk about the strategic and then the economic<br />
problems which the world is facing although the two are very<br />
much intertwined. I also want to look at what we have done<br />
and need to do in Australia and to emphasise the contribution<br />
we should seek to make in the: international environment.<br />
it would be disastrous for Australians to forget or overlook<br />
that while we are an independent country we are affected by<br />
what happens inother countries, inthe world economy, and in the<br />
V strategic balance.<br />
At the present time, the world strategic and political situation<br />
gives rise to many causes for concern. The overriding strategic<br />
reality is that Soviet military power is greater than it has<br />
ever been, both in a comparative and an absolute sense. The<br />
Soviet stance continues to be essentially provocative and<br />
the reality of Roviet policy is evident in the occupation of<br />
Afghanistan tehind the forces for repression in Poland,<br />
through Sovlet backing for the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea,<br />
and directly and indirectly in central . Anerica, in Africa and<br />
in parts of the Middle East.<br />
Can anyone deny that a firm response to Soviet actions is now<br />
a most pressing priority? Can anybody now deny the weight<br />
of the Australian Government's consistent argument since wecame<br />
to power in the Mid 1970' s that the advantages of detente<br />
seemed to flow one way towards the Soviet Union? / 3 </p>
<p>There is now great. anid widespread concern among Western<br />
governments about the situation and growing concern about<br />
the state of the Western Alliance.<br />
President Reagin's sustained determination to revive<br />
Western -power has given heart twb. a11 those people who have<br />
been aware of what was happening, but obvioubly the United<br />
States cannot carry the whole burden.<br />
indeed, it is not just a matter for the Unitzed States and<br />
Burope, the whole world has vital interests at stake,<br />
Australiats interests are obviously involved in the wh~ le<br />
question of world peace and isectiity and I want to ziake a<br />
commxent here on the priority which the Government has<br />
consistently giLven to defence expenditure.<br />
There are alwaYs different views about which particular<br />
exp~ enditures should come first in the defence area, always<br />
arguments about; which priorities axe the greatest. We have<br />
seen some of these argum~ ents in recent times in relation to<br />
the purchase o: C a new aircraft carrier and bringing forward<br />
the new Orion aircraft.<br />
But in the moids; t of those arguments, we must not lose sight<br />
of the fact that the Government hhbs #* ven defence spending<br />
the 1) it priority it needs. We emphasised defence when<br />
others were downgr~ lding it. We are continuing to increase<br />
defence expenditure, it is up Aliost 20% this year and<br />
Austr~ tlia is experiencing the benefits.<br />
Coming back to the international stxategic situation, I<br />
believe that what is needed now am~ ong Western nations i o an<br />
accurate perceltion of what the SovIet Union's actions are<br />
__ all about, because that perception-must provide the basis<br />
V of an adequate overall Western response to the situation that<br />
has now developed.<br />
There are moany questions we need to ask ourselves in the West,<br />
in the early past-war yeaxai there-would have been faiKly<br />
general understanding and agreement on the nature of the<br />
Soviet Union's intentions. That agreement ledto the fonrvation<br />
of NATO and the continuation of the Western Alliance,<br />
is there still the same understanding of the nature and<br />
purposes of the Soviet Union? Ar&amp; the differences that<br />
sometimes appear in the Alliance caused by dfferent perceptions<br />
now of the Soviet threat? Is there the capacity to achieve<br />
agreement about the way we should conduct our relations with<br />
the Soviet Union)' Is the West making itself a hostage to<br />
66rtune by building dependence on Soviet markets and on Soviet<br />
strategic supplies?<br />
And these questions come on top of the economic diffdculties<br />
in the Western industrialised de oracies which threaten the<br />
cohesion and purpose of Western count-ties. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
In Europe next month, there will be two vital summits which<br />
provide an opportunity to address these questions and<br />
difficulties.<br />
The Heads of Government of NATO countries will be meeting in<br />
Bonn to discuss the issues facing the Western Alliance. This<br />
meeting is potentially of enormous significance. It will<br />
be searching for a strategy for the 1980' s. and it is certainly<br />
the hope of the Australian government that this meeting will<br />
lead to a renewal and strengthening of the Alliance.<br />
The Bonn summit meeting will follow the Versailles economic<br />
summit, at which the Heads-of Government of the United Kingdom,<br />
France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United<br />
States together with the Presidents of the Commission and the<br />
Council-of the European Ocrmunities will discuss the economic priblems<br />
faced by the West and policies to overcome them, energy<br />
problems faced bythe West beyond the present downturn in<br />
world prices, the dialogue between developed and developing<br />
countries and problems and strategies in economic relations<br />
between the Western countries and the Soviet bloc.<br />
World economic conditions and their implications for the<br />
stability of the Western democracies are seiious indeed.<br />
It is estimated that last calendar year the value of world<br />
exports fell for the first time in over twenty years. The<br />
average rate growth of GDP in theindustrialised countries<br />
of the West was only a little over 1% and real GDP actually<br />
fell in the final quarter of the year in the United States,<br />
West Germany and even Japan.<br />
Predictions of recovery from recession are repeatedly made,<br />
and repeatedly fail to materialise. Already this year, the<br />
United States economy which produces over one third of the<br />
output of the member countries of the OECD has experienced<br />
Sa further fall in its real GDP in the" first quarter and its<br />
uneployent rate has reached almost 9 of its labour force<br />
which means that over 10 million Americans are out of work.<br />
This pattern of recession and rising unemployment is being<br />
repeated throughout the Western industrialised countries and<br />
it is predicted that total unemployment in the OECD countries<br />
will reach 30 million during this year.<br />
It is true that inflation rates have been falling rapidly in<br />
Europe and North America; that some workers have accepted cuts i<br />
in real wages to help protect their . employment prospects and<br />
oil prices have been declining.<br />
But while these trends provide reason for some optimism<br />
about future prospects for recovery, the persistence of<br />
real interest rates at historically high levels continues to<br />
discourage the investment which is so essential to building<br />
a sustained economic recovery. </p>
<p>The costs of these conditions in terms of unfulfilled expectations,<br />
in terms of unemployment and associated suffering are high<br />
indeed, and the potential for even higher costs as confidence<br />
in the ability of governments to cope is undermined cannot be<br />
ignored. In some cases the reactions of governments has been to try<br />
to defend themselves and their people not by facing up to<br />
the need for firm policy settings, not by accepting and<br />
facilitating the structural adjustment that is needed to<br />
accommodate changed economic conditions, but rather by seeking<br />
to increase and extend protectionism.<br />
For example, the European Community has intensified its<br />
already massive protection of its agricultural producers<br />
and has introduced a system of subsidies for exports of its<br />
agricultural produce to third markets. There is an increasing,<br />
and intensely disturbing trend towards bilateral trade<br />
agreements cutting across the forces of multilateral competition<br />
in trade that have been the basis of world growth and world<br />
prosperity for most of the post-war period.<br />
It is true, of course, as our recent experience -in Australia<br />
has made clear that economic interdependence can impose costs<br />
on countries when world economic conditions are difficult.<br />
But if the experience of the years of depression which preceded<br />
World War II has taught us anything, it is surely that the<br />
costs of isolationism are far more severe.<br />
Throughout the 1950' s and the 1960' s, the new economic order<br />
established in the aftermath of World War II, the liberal<br />
system of trade and payments, sustained unprecedented-growth<br />
of trade and prosperity.<br />
Following the experiences-of the 1970' s, the world today is<br />
a very different place and it is vital to the interests of us<br />
all that the Heads of Government meeting at the Versailles<br />
Economic Summit face up to that fact. and seek a clearer<br />
understanding of why it is so different, and what must be done<br />
to put the Western countries back on a path that will generate<br />
renewed growth and renewed prosperity.<br />
As with the NATO meeting:-at Bonn, Australia is not directly<br />
represented at the Versailles meeting, but our interests are<br />
very must involved.<br />
Our economy, our workforce, is small by comparison to those<br />
of the major countries involved in the Versailles Summit,<br />
We currently produce a little under 2% of total GDP in the<br />
OECD dountries taken together. There areamillions more people<br />
unemployed in the United States today than there are members<br />
of the total labour force in Australia. and we rely on trade<br />
with the major economies to keep us growing, to underpin the<br />
prosperity of all Australians.<br />
Nonetheless, as we have shown in recent years with the right<br />
policies we can succeed against world trends. Indeed in 1981<br />
our growth rate of 5% was about 4 times the estimated average<br />
growth rate for the OECD as a whole.<br />
I-I Ill I I </p>
<p>. The costs of these conditions in terms of unflfilled expectations,<br />
in terms of unemployment and associated suffering are hilh<br />
indeed, and the potential for even higher costs as confidence<br />
in the ability of governments to cope is undermined cannot be<br />
ignored. In some cases the reactions of governments has been to try<br />

a very different place and it is vital to the interests 6f us<br />
all that the Heads of Government meeting at the Versailles<br />
Economic Summit face up to that fact-and seek a clearer<br />

renewed growth and renewed prosperity.<br />
As with the NATO meeting:. at Bonn, Australia is not directly<br />
represented at the Versailles meeting, but our interests are<br />
very must involved.<br />
Our economy, our wDrkforce, is small by comparison to those<br />
of the major countries involved in the Versailles Summit.<br />
We currently produce a little under 2% of total GDP in the<br />
OECD Countries taken together. There arecillion8 more people<br />
unemployed in the United States today than there are members<br />
of the total labour force in Australia. and we rely on trade<br />
with the major economies to keep us growing, to underpin the<br />
prosperity of all Australians.<br />
Nonetheless, as we have shown in recent years with the right<br />
policies we can succeed against world trends. Indeed in 1981<br />
our growth rate of 5% was about 4 times the estimated average<br />
growth Xate for the OECD as a whole. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
We have shown that our interdependence with the rest: of the<br />
world has not prevented us from taking independent action to<br />
promote the living standards of Australians, and keep<br />
building Australia up.<br />
Let me add thai: we have succeeded in this endeavour without<br />
pursuing the path of increasing protectionism. Indeed in<br />
the process we have taken decisions to gradually lower<br />
protection throughout Australian induStry.<br />
The importance of keeping on building Australia up by<br />
continuing to bear down on inflation, by maintaining a<br />
responsible approach to our budgets, by continuing appropriately<br />
firm monetary policies, cannot be overstated.<br />
For it is growth that is the primary source of increased<br />
e living standards for Australia's families. It is growth that<br />
provides the resources to enable us to effectively care for<br />
the needy in our society, and to help other less fortunate<br />
peoples of the world to escape from the vicious circle: of<br />
poverty so many, 6f them face and it is growth that gives us<br />
the capacity to effectively defend-ourselves, and play a<br />
wider role in promoting peace and freedom in the international<br />
community. As a result of the policies that the Commonwealth Government<br />
has pursued since the end of 1975, not only do we now have<br />
one of the strongest economies among the Western industrialised<br />
nations today, but we also are one of the few net exporters<br />
of energy in a world which, following the-rise of OPEC, badly<br />
needs diversified sources and forms of energy.<br />
The importance of our energy resources not only provides an<br />
incentive for other countries to be aware of the impact of<br />
their policies on us but it also serves as one example of the<br />
fact that Australia does have a real contribution to make in<br />
relation to issues and problems of world concern.<br />
There are obviouslimnits to what a nation-of 15 million can do,<br />
but we have a role and a responsiblity, as a concerned and<br />
outward-looking nation, to do what we can.<br />
I believe that a country like ours sometimes has the capacity<br />
to highlight the concerns and interests of smaller and less<br />
powerful nations and thus contribute to a more balanced<br />
perspective overall.<br />
We have also demonstrated our capacity to take initiatives<br />
designed to encourage or enable others to act in pursuit of<br />
important objectives. Our decision on the Sinai, for example,<br />
was a catalyst in encouraging ' other countries to join the<br />
peacekeeping force, and our CHOGM initiative to set up a<br />
study group to -examine obstacles to negotiations in the<br />
North-South dialogue which arise from the negotiating process<br />
itself is a further important example. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Not only does Australia have something to contribute, we also<br />
have responsibilities to secure Austral~ ia's own well-being<br />
and interests.<br />
in the conjunction of strategic and economic circumstances<br />
which I have been discussing in this speech, I believe it<br />
is vitally important for Australians to be aware of what is<br />
at issue, and how the events may affect us.<br />
It is also important for us to realise -that while Australia<br />
will not be attending either of the June summits, our interests<br />
are involved.<br />
Against that background, the discussions that I shall be<br />
having next week with President Reagan, with Pierre Trudeau<br />
and with Prime Kinister Suzuki are obviously timely, and they<br />
will provide a valuable opportunity to bring forward ourI<br />
concerns and perspectives.<br />
We live in a troubled and uncertain world. If ever anyone<br />
needed an example of that, look at the F'alklands.<br />
As Liberals, as a Party and a federation determined to defend<br />
the values of freedom and democracy, we have tremernjous<br />
responsibilities, and tremendously challenging tasks.<br />
We need the courage to stand up for what we know to be right.<br />
We need the will to match our ideals with effective action<br />
and we need the dedication to stick with far-sighted policies.<br />
Provided we do that, there is much that we can achieve, and<br />
we can be confident of our ability to surmount the problems<br />
and build the kind of future that we want. </p>
