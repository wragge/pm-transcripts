STATEMENT BY MALCOLM FRASER 1 OEBR17<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN'<br />
THIS AFTERNOON, THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL COMMISSIONED ME TO FORM<br />
A GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO PERMIT THE DEADLOCK BETWEEN<br />
THE TWO HOUSES-OF THE PARLIAMENT TO BE RESOLVED.<br />
IT WILL BE MY SOLE PURPOSE AS HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT, TO RESTORE<br />
RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMIENT TO THE NATION'S AFFAIRS AND TO ENSURE THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS THE GENERAL ELECTION TO WHICH IT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY<br />
ENTITLED AND WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DENIED IT.<br />
UNTIL THE JUDGEMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAS BEEN REGISTERED<br />
AT THIS ELECTION, MY GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE NO APPOINTMENTS OR<br />
DISMISSALS, NOR INITIATE ANY OF OUR POLICIES.<br />
I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS 761-'; 2<br />
11 NOVEMBER 1975 </p>
<p>-2-11 NOV/ EMBER 1975<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCY.-<br />
YOU HAVE INTIMATED TO ME THAT IT IS YOUR EXCELLENCY'S<br />
PLEASURE THAT I SHOULD ACT AS YOUR CHIEF ADVISER AND HEAD<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT,<br />
IN ACCEPTING YOUR COMMISSION I CONFIRM THAT I HAVE G IVEN YOU<br />
AN ASSURANCE THAT I SHALL IMMEDIATELY SEEK TO SECURE THE<br />
PASSAGE OF THE APPROPRIATION BILLS WHICH ARE AT PRESENT<br />
BEFORE THE SENATE, THUS ENSURING SUPPLY FOR THE CARRYING<br />
ON OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE IN ALL ITS BRANCHES. I FURTHER.<br />
CONFIRMI THAT, UPON THE GRANTING OF SUPPLY, I SHALL IMMEDIATELY<br />
RECOMMEND TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THE DISSOLUTION OF BOTH HOUSES<br />
OF THE PARLIAMENT.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT WILL ACT AS A CARETAKER GOVERNMENT AND WILL<br />
MAKE NO APPOINTMENTS OR DISMISSALS OR INITIATE NEW POLICIES<br />
BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION IS HELD. YOURS SINCERELY,<br />
( JI. It. F RAS ER)<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY THE HONOURABLE SIR JOHN KERR, AC., KUST.<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
GOVERNMENT HOUSE,*<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. 2600 </p>
<p>ONCE THE SENATE MADE ITS DECISION, THERE WAS ONLY ONE APPROPRIATE<br />
COURSE OF ACTION FOR MR WHITLAM TO TAKE. HE SHOULD HAVE CALLED<br />
A GENERAL ELECTION.<br />
HE REFUSED TO DO SO.<br />
I DEEPLY REGRET THAT HE DID NOT TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OPEN TO HIM.<br />
A WEEK AGO WE PROPOSED THAT MR WHITLAM UNDERTAKE TO HOLD ELECTIONS<br />
FOR THE HOUSE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE NEXT SENATE ELECTION.<br />
HE REJECTED THAT OFFER.<br />
THIS MORNING, I CALLED ON MR WHITLAM TO DISCUSS WITH HIM<br />
ARRANGEMENTS FOR A GENERAL ELECTION, THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE FRUITLESS.<br />
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL WAS LEFT WITH NO<br />
ALTERNATIVE. HE HAS ACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS DUTY UNDER THE<br />
CONSTITUTION AND WITHDRAWN MR WHITLAM'S COMMISSION.<br />
IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY DUTY. I HAVE TODAY ADVISED SIR JOHN KERR TO<br />
DISSOLVE BOTH HOUSES OF THE PARLIAMENT, SO THAT THE PEOPLE<br />
THEMSELVES CAN DECIDE WHAT GOVERNMENT THEY WANT FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED, THE BUDGET W-AS PASSED.<br />
NONE OF THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES WHICH WERE THREATENED BY THE LABOR PARTY(<br />
WILL NOW OCCUR. MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND GOVERNMENT<br />
SERVICES WILL NOW FLOWi NORMALLY. I HAVE TODAY ISSUED WRITTEN<br />
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE AS A WHOLE THAT ALL THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S OUTSTANDING DEBTS SHOULD BE PAID. 1 6 ILI </p>
<p>THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTIES TOOK-THE ACTION WE DID<br />
AFTER THREE YEARS OF GROSSLY INCOMPETENT AND DAMAGING ECONOMIC<br />
MISMANAGEMENT,-AND AFTER THE SECOND'MAN WHO HAD ACTED AS" PRIME<br />
MININSTER HAD BEEN DISMISSED FOR DECEIVING THE PARLIAMENT.<br />
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE BELIEVED THAT THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO JUDGE TO<br />
JUDGE THE LABOR PARTY AND TO JUDGE OURSELVES. OUR ACTION HAS<br />
BEEN TAKEN TO GIVE PEOPLE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE, 0<br />
THOSE FEW EXTREMISTS URGING CONFLICT AND DIVISION ARE DAMAGING<br />
AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY. I BELIEVE THAT RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE WILL<br />
SUPPORT THE REASONABLE AND RATIONAL APPROACH WE HAVE ADOPTED.<br />
THERE WILL NOW BE AN ELECTION AS THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.<br />
THE GREAT DEFENSE OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS THAT THE CONSTITUTION MUST 0<br />
BE UPHELD. 0<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR SAY. THE CHOICE IS THEIRS<br />
AT THE BALLOT BOX, </p>
