<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.....just for a moment just for a comment on the rate cut this</p>
<p>   morning, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me say this is a fantastic day for the Australian economy</p>
<p>   and for homebuyers. I mean, we have got booming economic growth,</p>
<p>   we've got the lowest interest rates in 30 years and we have</p>
<p>   just introduced a tax reform package that is going to build an even</p>
<p>   stronger Australian economy. You can't get a better day illustrating</p>
<p>   a strong past, a powerful present and an optimistic future. It is</p>
<p>   a tremendous day for the Australian economy and it's a reminder</p>
<p>   that Australia is the economic strong man of Asia. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what about today's national accounts figures, five per</p>
<p>   cent growth for the year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have just mentioned that. That indicates just how strong</p>
<p>   the Australian economy is. We have defied the Asian economic downturn,</p>
<p>   we have dumbfounded the critics and we have illustrated that those</p>
<p>   gloom and doom merchants in the Labor Party are just so out of touch</p>
<p>   with reality. Thank you.</p>
