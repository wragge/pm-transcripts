    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Michael, to my many federal and state parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues and my fellow Liberals here in New South Wales. As always</p>
<p> it's a great pleasure to be back talking to the New South Wales</p>
<p> Division of the Liberal Party. And this morning I want to share some</p>
<p> thoughts with you about the Australian federal political scene which</p>
<p> are very important to our party and to our country over the weeks</p>
<p> and the months ahead.</p>
<p>We will of course sometime in the next nine months have a federal</p>
<p> general election. When that will be and what form that will take I</p>
<p> am yet to decide and in making that decision I will naturally take</p>
<p> the counsel, not only of my federal parliamentary colleagues, but</p>
<p> also of the Liberal Party organisation here in New South Wales and</p>
<p> throughout Australia. And it is therefore appropriate that we begin</p>
<p> to assess the choice that the Australian people will need to make</p>
<p> when the next federal election is held because elections, be they</p>
<p> state or federal, are all about choice. They're about deciding</p>
<p> whether you will go down one path and continue in a particular direction,</p>
<p> or whether you will change direction and go backwards down another</p>
<p> path. And I use that word backwards very advisedly in the context</p>
<p> of the next federal election, because it will involve a choice about</p>
<p> going forward or about turning around and going backwards. Because</p>
<p> over the past few weeks the Australian public has had driven home</p>
<p> to it just how negative, reactionary and backward-looking is the federal</p>
<p> political alternative on offer.</p>
<p>My Government was elected a little over two years ago. We were elected</p>
<p> following thirteen years of Labor - thirteen years which increasingly</p>
<p> saw a government drift away from contact with the ordinary men and</p>
<p> women of our nation. A group of people in government who became arrogant</p>
<p> and lazy and out of touch, and one of the things that I've encouraged</p>
<p> all of my colleagues to avoid is falling into the trap of being arrogant</p>
<p> and out of touch. And I believe that we have worked very hard to avoid</p>
<p> that and the success that is now becoming more evident to the Australian</p>
<p> community is the reward that we are beginning to see as a consequence</p>
<p> of avoiding that arrogance. Everyone knows that we are living in a</p>
<p> very turbulent region and I don't think I have gone through a</p>
<p> week in public life in Australia where the potential turbulence of</p>
<p> our own Asian-Pacific region, particularly Indonesia, has been more</p>
<p> apparent than it has over the last week. And if ever the truism that</p>
<p> we are part of the Asia-Pacific region was driven home to the Australian</p>
<p> public it was driven home over the last week. All of us will hope</p>
<p> that as change is undertaken in Indonesia that the direction will</p>
<p> be towards a more open and a more inclusive Indonesian society.</p>
<p>I have never taken the view that Australian Prime Ministers should</p>
<p> pontificate about the leadership of other nations. Good relations</p>
<p> between countries are built on mutual respect and that includes accepting</p>
<p> the decisions that other nations make about their leadership and their</p>
<p> constitutional forms and their way of government, but equally demanding</p>
<p> of them that they accept the decisions we make about our leadership,</p>
<p> our constitutional forms and our way of government. And I've</p>
<p> followed that approach since I've been Prime Minister and I'm</p>
<p> sure it's been the right approach. We have good relations with</p>
<p> Indonesia, we are a friend of Indonesia's, we've been a</p>
<p> regional mate of Indonesia's but we have not been an uncritical</p>
<p> commentator. We are prepared to defend our own interests and our own</p>
<p> rights and to have our own views but we stop short of telling other</p>
<p> countries how to run their own affairs. Now I don't know precisely</p>
<p> the ultimate form of the change process which is underway in that</p>
<p> country. And who governs that country and the form of that government</p>
<p> is a matter for the Indonesian people to determine. I do know that</p>
<p> I want the country to have peace, I want the country to have a greater</p>
<p> measure of personal liberty, and I want the country to have increased</p>
<p> living standards. And whatever may have been said of the government</p>
<p> of that country for the past thirty two years, nothing can gainsay</p>
<p> the fact that the living standard of the average Indonesian has risen</p>
<p> dramatically during that period of time. And the way forward for Indonesia</p>
<p> is through economic and political openness and co-operation with the</p>
<p> nations of the region. And we will continue to be a good friend, we'll</p>
<p> continue to help where we can as we have in the past, but like any</p>
<p> other great democratic self-respecting nation we will of course require</p>
<p> in our relations with that country as with all others, a basis of</p>
<p> mutual self respect.</p>
<p>But what has happened there and what indeed has happened in the region</p>
<p> over the past few months has driven home to the Australian people</p>
<p> the need for a government that delivers safety, security and stability.</p>
<p> And the clearest possible message has come from the economic management</p>
<p> of my government epitomised by the recent Federal Budget, and that</p>
<p> is that against the backdrop of enormous regional turbulence we have</p>
<p> delivered security, safety and stability to the Australian people</p>
<p> and to the Australian economy. And I ask the very obvious rhetorical</p>
<p> question: Where would we have been now against the background of what</p>
<p> has happened in the Asia-Pacific region if we had not followed the</p>
<p> economic course we embarked upon in March of 1996? Where would we</p>
<p> have been if we had left Mr Beazley's black hole of $10.5 billion</p>
<p> unfilled? Where would we have been if we had taken the advice of the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats? I mean they sometimes make the big spenders</p>
<p> of the Labor Party look like skinflints. Where would we have been</p>
<p> if we had taken the lazy option and adopted the views of having one</p>
<p> government you were paralysed and did nothing? The truth is that if</p>
<p> we had not cut the budget deficit, if we had not got on top of the</p>
<p> enormous debt that we inherited from Mr Beazley and Mr Keating, this</p>
<p> country now would have been weaker, more vulnerable and at the mercy</p>
<p> of the economic turbulence that is swirling through the Asia-Pacific</p>
<p> region.</p>
<p>So what we are facing at the moment is a very clear choice. Do we</p>
<p> hang on to that stability, security and safety which my government</p>
<p> has delivered, or do we go down a backward risky economic path which</p>
<p> is being mapped out by the Labor Party? The Labor Party says it believes</p>
<p> in fiscal responsibility but opposes every measure to deliver it.</p>
<p> The Labor Party says it believes in budget surpluses but has spent</p>
<p> two and a quarter years trying to stop the creation of a budget surplus.</p>
<p> The Labor Party created the problem - they lit fire to the building</p>
<p> and they've tried to stop the fire brigade putting out the fire.</p>
<p> And yet they pretend to the Australian people that they too are a</p>
<p> party of economic responsibility.</p>
<p>The Labor Party in 1998 is a monumental economic risk. The Labor Party</p>
<p> if re-elected would undermine the security the stability and the safety</p>
<p> against the background of Asian economic turbulence that my government</p>
<p> has delivered. And it's not only at the macro level that the</p>
<p> Labor Party is a risk, it's also at a level that directly affects</p>
<p> people in this audience and affects the great bulk of middle Australia.</p>
<p> One of the greatest gifts of my government to the battlers of Australia</p>
<p> and to middle Australia - has been the enormous reduction in interest</p>
<p> rates that has occurred since 1996. To the average homebuyer it's</p>
<p> worth $300 a month and that is the equivalent of $100 a week pay rise.</p>
<p> If Labor is re-elected that will be put at risk because as certain</p>
<p> as one can be of anything in politics, if Labor gets back into power</p>
<p> interest rates will start going up again. Because Labor is a party</p>
<p> of big spending. Labor doesn't believe in budget surpluses, Labor</p>
<p> believes in budget deficits because that's what they did when</p>
<p> they were in government, despite what they said to the opposite. And</p>
<p> the biggest risk to middle Australia of a re-elected Labor government</p>
<p> will be higher interest rates because the low interest rates we now</p>
<p> have are a direct result of the economic policies of my government</p>
<p> -without them there would have been much greater pressure on borrowing</p>
<p> in the financial markets and therefore much higher interest rates.</p>
<p>So we do have a very clear choice emerging - we have safety, stability</p>
<p> and security against the backdrop of Asian economic turbulence on</p>
<p> the one hand and on the other hand the enormous risk of returning</p>
<p> Labor to office federally, and that risk is symbolised more than anything</p>
<p> else by the threat that a re-elected Labor government would pose to</p>
<p> the level of interest rates - not only for housing but also for small</p>
<p> business. Because they are now at their lowest level for more than</p>
<p> thirty years. You have to go back into the late 1960s to get interest</p>
<p> rates for housing as low as they are now and back into the early 1970s</p>
<p> - before the Whitlam government began to take an axe to Australia's</p>
<p> economic stability - to get the sort of interest rates for small business</p>
<p> that are now becoming daily more apparent.</p>
<p>We therefore ladies and gentleman do have a very clear choice. And</p>
<p> it's a very clear choice that it's the responsibility of</p>
<p> all of us as members of the Liberal Party to communicate to the Australian</p>
<p> people, either at a federal parliamentary level or at a branch or</p>
<p> conference level. Because it goes very much to the kind of Australian</p>
<p> community we are going to have as we go into the next millennium.</p>
<p> We often talk about the future - we talk about our goals, we talk</p>
<p> about our vision for the future, we talk about our hopes for the future.</p>
<p> I believe that one of the greatest legacies that a government of Australia</p>
<p> in the late 1990s, in the closing years of the twentieth century,</p>
<p> one of the greatest legacies that that government could aspire to</p>
<p> leave to the generations of the third Christian millennium of the</p>
<p> twenty-first century would be a debt-free Australian society. When</p>
<p> I think of the future that my own children will enjoy and hopefully</p>
<p> their children will enjoy, one thinks of the prospect that they might</p>
<p> have a society that is not only socially stable, racially tolerant,</p>
<p> politically liberal, but also a society that is free of debt and a</p>
<p> society therefore that provides a sense of continuity and a sense</p>
<p> of economic predictability that is so very important.</p>
<p>All of our economic policies have been designed to deliver that stability,</p>
<p> that safety and that security which is so important. We don't</p>
<p> pursue economic policies because we have some ideological obsession</p>
<p> with it. Change for the sake of change is of no use. Change is only</p>
<p> worthwhile if it delivers a benefit to society. And every single change</p>
<p> that I've embraced as Prime Minister has been a change that I've</p>
<p> believed will make Australia a better nation. I believe that one of</p>
<p> the greatest gifts of statecraft in modern society is to choose between</p>
<p> preserving those values and those institutions we've inherited</p>
<p> from the past that are worth preserving and getting rid of those attitudes</p>
<p> and those practices that are worth getting rid of. And when people</p>
<p> say to me do you believe in change my answer is I believe in change</p>
<p> if it's for the better but if it's for the worse or if it's</p>
<p> simply neutral then I'm not in favour of it. And that is the</p>
<p> attitude we ought to take. Beware of those people who say that change</p>
<p> just for the sake of experimentation is something you ought to embrace.</p>
<p> But equally have the courage to throw out something which is clearly</p>
<p> working against our interests. And it's in that context that</p>
<p> we have approached economic, industrial relations and other change</p>
<p> since we've been in office.</p>
<p>We want to reform the Australian waterfront not because we want to</p>
<p> destroy the Maritime Union of Australia, or we want to prevent trade</p>
<p> unionists working on the Australian waterfront. We want to reform</p>
<p> the Australian waterfront because that will be good for the Australian</p>
<p> economy. We want to reform the Australian waterfront because that</p>
<p> will create more jobs and generate more investment and make Australia</p>
<p> a more competitive exporter in an increasingly competitive world trading</p>
<p> environment.</p>
<p>We reduced the budget deficit because that made Australia stronger</p>
<p> and more secure and it has meant that against the background of the</p>
<p> Asian economic turbulence that we are a much more stable society that</p>
<p> we might otherwise have been. Equally when we turn our gaze to the</p>
<p> next great area of economic change that will be good for Australia</p>
<p> - that is taxation reform - we view it not as turning the world on</p>
<p> its head, not as a revolution, we see it rather as the next necessary</p>
<p> desirable change to further strengthen the Australian economy. We</p>
<p> want a new tax system because the present one is not good enough.</p>
<p> We want a new tax system because the present one is not fair enough.</p>
<p> We want a new indirect tax system because the present one penalises</p>
<p> exporters. We are one of the few great trading nations in the world</p>
<p> that has a taxation system that actually penalises Australians that</p>
<p> want to sell goods and services overseas. And that's the reason</p>
<p> why we have to get rid of the present system because it's hurting</p>
<p> Australia. When we line up against nations that have a different indirect</p>
<p> tax system, an indirect tax system that does not impose any penalty</p>
<p> on inputs to the manufacture of goods that we sell overseas we are</p>
<p> at a disadvantage. Because the present system does impose that penalty</p>
<p> and that alone is argument enough for changing the present system.</p>
<p>So tax reform is not about revolution. Tax reform is about the evolutionary</p>
<p> building of further advantages and further protections for the Australian</p>
<p> economy and for the Australian community. It's about making Australia</p>
<p> a more competitive nation. It's about removing the unfairness</p>
<p> of a wholesale tax system that says that if you can afford to buy</p>
<p> a Lear jet you don't pay any indirect tax, but if you're</p>
<p> like most of us and can only afford a family car you pay twenty-two</p>
<p> per cent. It's about a taxation system that back in the 1950s</p>
<p> said that you only paid the top marginal rate of tax if you earned</p>
<p> in Australia in today's dollar terms about $500 or $600,000 a</p>
<p> year. But now you pay that top marginal rate of tax if you earn something</p>
<p> round $50,000 a year. And by the time we get to the year 2000 it will</p>
<p> be down to around $39,000 a year. Now we can't go on with that</p>
<p> kind of taxation system. That's why we want to change it. There's</p>
<p> nothing revolutionary or radical about that, to me it is plain up</p>
<p> and down common sense and that's what tax reform is about, is</p>
<p> adopting a common sense sensible measured approach to change that</p>
<p> will make Australia a better country. There are very few nations on</p>
<p> earth left with the indirect tax system that we have at the present</p>
<p> time because most of them have had the wit to realise that such an</p>
<p> indirect taxation system works to Australia's disadvantage.</p>
<p>We're not going to introduce a tax system that is going to hurt</p>
<p> the poor. One of things I'm very proud about is the way in which</p>
<p> my government has maintained the social security safety net in this</p>
<p> country. I think we are long past the day when there's any serious</p>
<p> argument in Australia about the desirability of having a social security</p>
<p> safety net. We don't believe in anybody being allowed to rort</p>
<p> the welfare system anymore than we believe that people at the top</p>
<p> end of town should be able to escape their taxation liability. They</p>
<p> shouldn't be, because it's unfair and it imposes an unfair</p>
<p> burden on the rest of us and the great bulk of wage and salary earners</p>
<p> who are in no position to take advantage of fancy and dubious arrangements.</p>
<p> I want to make it very clear that our tax reform will be directed</p>
<p> to ensure that people who are escaping their fair share of the tax</p>
<p> burden will be required under those reforms to do so, and any suggestion</p>
<p> to the contrary is completely wrong. But we need tax reform because</p>
<p> it will further strengthen us and because it's a necessary next</p>
<p> step in the process of making Australia ever stronger, more stable</p>
<p> and more secure against the background of what is occurring in our</p>
<p> region.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen over the next few months we will of course be</p>
<p> unveiling the details of our taxation policy. But we'll be going</p>
<p> to the next election whenever it is being held against a background</p>
<p> of very significant achievement over the time that we have been in</p>
<p> government. We have been willing to tackle issues of long term importance</p>
<p> to the Australian community. We have strengthened the economy. We</p>
<p> have improved industrial relations. We have reasserted the rights</p>
<p> of the mainstream of the Australian community against the clamouring</p>
<p> of noisy minorities without being insensitive to the responsibilities</p>
<p> of government to look after the vulnerable and the weak and the disadvantaged</p>
<p> within our community. We have adjusted Australia's foreign policy</p>
<p> so that whilst we preserve the great priority of our relations with</p>
<p> the Asia-Pacific region, we haven't ignored the very important</p>
<p> linkages that this country has with Britain and the rest of Europe</p>
<p> and with the nations of North America. I have frequently said that</p>
<p> Australia occupies a unique intersection of history, geography, culture</p>
<p> and economic circumstance in this part of the world. We are a projection</p>
<p> of western civilisation in the Asia-Pacific region. We are a nation</p>
<p> that has very strong historical links with Europe. We have deep bonds</p>
<p> of shared democracy and liberal values with the nations of North America</p>
<p> and we are located in the Asia-Pacific region. And our own society</p>
<p> has been enriched through the immigration into this country of hundreds</p>
<p> of thousands of people from the Asia-Pacific region. And when you</p>
<p> put all of that together it gives us a great advantage, it gives us</p>
<p> a place in history and geography and culture and economic circumstance</p>
<p> that no other nation on earth can possibly occupy. And if we are sensible</p>
<p> and positive and if we don't see those historical and economic</p>
<p> and cultural linkages as being mutually exclusive but rather blending</p>
<p> together to give us a unique position in this time of history then</p>
<p> we have an enormous opportunity to build a very special society playing</p>
<p> a very special role in this part of the world.</p>
<p>So we'll be able to go the next election whenever it is held</p>
<p> proud of the record of economic stability and reform, proud of the</p>
<p> fact that we have given Australia a proper role in the world and the</p>
<p> affairs of the world and also having a practical vision and a solid</p>
<p> set of values as we go into the next century.</p>
<p>But can I just finally address a few words to all of you as members</p>
<p> of the Liberal Party organisation. Election campaigns are not won</p>
<p> by members of parliament alone, they're not even principally</p>
<p> won by members of parliament. They are won by the combined grassroots</p>
<p> efforts of the men and women who make up the rank and file of political</p>
<p> parties. I need your help whenever the election is. My colleagues</p>
<p> need your help and all of us together need to mount a very strong</p>
<p> and effective grassroots election campaign. Election campaigns are</p>
<p> never easy. They are becoming harder each time in this country because</p>
<p> we now live in a state where politics is a lot less tribal than it</p>
<p> used to be and there are fewer people in the Australian community</p>
<p> whose political allegiance is permanently rusted on to one or other</p>
<p> side of politics. And there are a lot more people swinging around</p>
<p> in the middle and therefore you can have significant movement one</p>
<p> way or the other within a very short period of time. So I don't</p>
<p> take anything for granted. From the moment I was elected two and a</p>
<p> quarter years ago I said that we couldn't take the result of</p>
<p> the next election for granted and that remains the case.</p>
<p>But I'm greatly encouraged by the unity and the strength of our</p>
<p> own parliamentary party. I'm greatly encouraged by the support</p>
<p> that I've received from the organisation and I'm greatly</p>
<p> encouraged by the fact that in the face of very considerable difficulty</p>
<p> and adversity on a number of issues the Government has gone the distance</p>
<p> and stayed the course and the public is beginning to appreciate and</p>
<p> to respect that and to understand that and to see that as a great</p>
<p> strength. There are always times in public life, there are always</p>
<p> times in the lives of political leaders, in the lives of government,</p>
<p> when you're going to go through periods when everybody is criticising</p>
<p> you and everybody is expressing doubt about the wisdom of the course</p>
<p> that you are following. And like every other government worth its</p>
<p> salt we have gone through periods like that over the last two and</p>
<p> a quarter years. But because our cause has been right and our objectives</p>
<p> have been in the national interest we have stuck to our course and</p>
<p> that has been evident in areas like economic reform. There were plenty</p>
<p> of critics eighteen months, a year ago, who said we'd gone too</p>
<p> far. There aren't many of them now. They're very grateful</p>
<p> that we did do what we did a couple of years ago. And they're</p>
<p> very grateful that it was a couple of years ago and not this budget.</p>
<p> And they're very grateful that we had the foresight and the determination</p>
<p> to do it. There are people who were critical, our opponents in particular,</p>
<p> of some of the things we have done in respect of industrial relations,</p>
<p> but we've stuck to course and we're going to continue to</p>
<p> pursue the course. We're going to continue to pursue the cause</p>
<p> of waterfront reform for example, because it's in Australia's</p>
<p> interest that it be achieved. That's what governments are elected</p>
<p> to do. There's never any point in being in government if you</p>
<p> don't do something with it. There's nothing more pathetic</p>
<p> in public life than to be given high office and be elected to a position</p>
<p> of power and responsibility and then squander the opportunity that</p>
<p> that great gift from the people gives you. And that has been something</p>
<p> that has very significantly affected the way in which we have conducted</p>
<p> the affairs of government.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen I'm very proud on behalf of the Federal</p>
<p> Government to give this report, to map out the choice that lies ahead</p>
<p> of the Australian people. Whether we continue down the path of stability,</p>
<p> security and safety or whether we go backwards and put at risk the</p>
<p> achievements of the last couple of years in particular go back to</p>
<p> the era of high debt, high deficit and high interest rates and high</p>
<p> unemployment that was the legacy that we inherited from Mr Beazley</p>
<p> and from Mr Keating.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen again my very warm thanks for the tremendous</p>
<p> support that you've given me and given my government over the</p>
<p> last couple of years and I look forward with great enthusiasm to the</p>
<p> challenge of the weeks and the months ahead.</p>
