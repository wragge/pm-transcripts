    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS: PM No. 106/ 1970<br />MR. WHrrLAM'S SENATE CPENING<br />Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton</p>
<p><br />Speaking beneath a banner inscribed " A Labor Senate Makes Sense" Mr. Whitlam, who is pledged to the abolition of the Senate, last night delivered a lack-lustre rehash of denigration and generalisation.</p>
<p>While doing so he was divided from the Opposition Leader in the Senate. This gentleman was absent owing, it is said, to the divisive effects of a discussion on who got what television time.</p>
<p><br />Nevertheless the dull and stodgy speech contained as many falsehoods as a suet pudding contains currants. last year.</p>
<p><br />there was. It is simply not true that there was a 50 cost of living increace<br />It is simply not true that the Treasu7er ever " admitted" that<br />It is simply not true that the National Liberation Front is recognised<br />as a principal party in the negotiations at Paris, or that the approach of the<br />Government to helping the sick aged is discriminatory, or that if a Government<br />does not do what the Opposition demands it is therefore being divisive.<br />But perhaps the most intriguing part of the address, which was<br />singularly free from constructive proposals, was that wherein M\ 4r Whitlam appointed<br />himself as the only man with a conscience and as the sole custodian of the<br />national conscie-nce. The implication of course is that anyone who disagrees<br />with him on anything must be acting against the dictates of conscience. This<br />may be most consoling to this all-Australian Jimimy Cricket. But it isn't<br />necessarily true.<br />If it is thought that this i. not a particularly serious comment, it<br />is because Mr. Whitlam's contribution could not be regarded as a particularly<br />serious speech.<br />CANBERRA 29 October 1970</p>
