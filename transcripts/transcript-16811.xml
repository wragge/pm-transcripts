<p>Upcoming priorities include:</p>
<p>     * Establishing a new high quality national domestic violence and sexual assault telephone and online crisis and support service.</p>
<p>     * Implementing Respectful Relationships programs into school and non school settings to change attitudes and behaviours that contribute to violence.</p>
