AUSTRALIAN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION<br />
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LUNCHEON<br />
Hotel Canberra, Canberra, A. C. T. 19 September 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Group-Captain Nicholls, Mr. Buchan, Distinguished Guests, Mr.<br />
Ambassador:-I think the first thing I would like to say to you is that I<br />
welcome this opportunity on behalf of the Government to welcome the new<br />
Ambassador from the United States, Mr. Rice, and his wife. We hope<br />
that their stay in this country will be thoroughly enjoyable for them and<br />
that it will help to cement even further the relations between our two<br />
countries. I know they will be welcomed warmly wherever they go in<br />
Australia, and I hope they go throughout the whole of this nation.<br />
This gathering is a continuation of an association which<br />
had its roots in the trials of the Second World War. It was then, I think,<br />
for the first-time that there became a really close relationship between<br />
the United States of America and our own nation. I know that as long ago<br />
as 1908, Commodore Perry came out here with the Great White Fleet and<br />
Alfred Deaki, who welcomed that fleet, spoke of " our American cousins"<br />
And that was long ago. And there has been a continuing feeling along those<br />
lines since that time.<br />
Indeed, one of our most different and most well-known<br />
politicians, Mr. King O'Malley, who was instrumental in founding the<br />
Commonwealth Bank, came either from the United States or Canada it's<br />
not quite clear. But at any rate, it was quite close to the United States,<br />
if it wasn't in it: But that feeling really came to have far more deep-seated<br />
roots in the Second World War. There are perhaps many people in this<br />
room, or some people in this room who do not remember this because<br />
the years are quick and memories are short, but we were threatened, as<br />
we were, with actual invasion of our country, and that was strange to us<br />
for we are one of the few countries in the world that has never had to suffer<br />
an invasion. And when there was a sweep down of apparently irresistible<br />
military power, closer and closer to Australia, culminating in ail attack<br />
on New Guinea itself at Milne Bay, it was then that there came to our<br />
assistance soldiers from the United States. It was then at the Battle of<br />
the Coral Sea, which you have celebrated for so long, that the tide was<br />
turned back. And those joint operations for they were joint operations<br />
of our two nations, struck feelings of gratitude from the Australian people<br />
q / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
which I think have never withered and which I believe, even though younger<br />
generations follow us along, will also never wither away.<br />
This was why for so many years the highlight of the year<br />
for the Austral ian-American Association was what was called the Coral<br />
Sea Celebrations, and that was why for so long top admirals and generals<br />
and air force officers from the United States were brought out by your<br />
Association to tour Australia and to talk to your members. And I think<br />
it right, proper and wise that you decided that the years having passed,<br />
there should be a wider and deeper and even more significant association<br />
than just the memories of the times when we stood together and some of<br />
us fell together. And so you have thought it right, and I think it right, that<br />
you should bring out here as your guest distinguished citizens from the<br />
United States in all walks of life, that you should seek to broaden year<br />
by year the kind of association between our two peoples, that you should<br />
seek to see that we do not just look back to the past but accept the present<br />
and look to changes in the future. Therefore you seek to broaden out into<br />
student exchanges, in which young people from America come here and<br />
young A ustralians go to the United States and you seek to have closer<br />
cultural relationships. seeking by these means to get those who are<br />
going in the future to be the leaders of our nation, to know more of the<br />
United States and those from the United States who may be leaders of that<br />
nation to know more about us. And we must never forget that each single<br />
student who comes to Australia and spends some time here at one of our<br />
schools and goes back to the United States is not just one person but is a<br />
person who has a wide range of friends to whom he or she can speak, and<br />
by speaking to them of how life is in this country, can do far more in<br />
spreading amongst that community a knowledge of our own nation.<br />
We have, of course, co-operation between the United States<br />
and the Australian Government on many fronts, You have spoken of defeince<br />
itself and I am not ashamed to say I believe that the true protection of<br />
Australia in the years ahead while it is growing, while it is strengthening<br />
itself, while it is strengthening its own defences, depends in the main on<br />
the United States and on the ANZUS Treaty.<br />
If it were not for that, we would in the charged circumstances<br />
of the world, with Britain's shield having been removed from our North,<br />
with the world in ferment, we would probably have to divert far more of<br />
our resources than we should to building up to an even greater extent our<br />
own defences. It is this Treaty which enables us to build our own defences<br />
because as you said, the United States quite properly looks to people to<br />
help themselves. But it also enables us, with some security, to build the<br />
industrial muscles, to develop the industries, to bring in the population<br />
which, in the long term, will be the real basis of our strength. And so<br />
this is a sine qua non of our continuing development at the rate at which<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
history demands we must develop over the next few years. That is one<br />
aspect of co-operation. just recently you, Sir, from the United States fired the<br />
imagination of the world, by sending for the first time men to wralk upon<br />
the surface of the moon. A science fiction story which would have been<br />
labelled, a decade ago, or fifteen years ago, by most people as nothing<br />
but a science fiction story yet one which has turned out to be fact. And we<br />
played some part in co-operation in that. It was Australian tracking<br />
stations which helped in the mission. There was an Australian scientist<br />
engaged in the planning. I am informed by reading a speech which you,<br />
Sir, made of something which I didn't know before and that is that the<br />
sunglasses were designed by Australians. And we even have a sample in<br />
this country of moon rockts weighing some ounces I'm not quite sure how<br />
many, but when you think of the distance they had to be carried, you will<br />
realise that an ounce is the equivalent of a ton: We have them here, and<br />
this is another example of co-operation between us.<br />
Thinking back in this space programme to the first time<br />
when men circled the earth and in order that they shouldn't lose their way,<br />
the citizens of Perth turned on all the electric light available so that they<br />
would know where they were, much to the subsequent fury of the Perth<br />
electric light ratepayers! These are merely some examples in the field<br />
of scientific advancement in which we are co-operating co-operating<br />
well in that so many of the inventions we make in Australia are developed<br />
in the United States, and co-operating indeed in other ways.<br />
We are co-operating on the far-flung frontiers in Australia<br />
and we are a nation with frontiers still. Those of you who have at any<br />
stage beein in the newly -developing towns in Western Australia or the<br />
Northern Territory or Queensland will agree with me that there is there a<br />
feeling of excitement in the air, a feeling of endeavour. There is a feeling<br />
of pride when the length of railway line laid in a day breaks a world record,<br />
a feeling of enthusiasm which goes with frontiers. Mind You, they aren't<br />
the old frontiers of the West the West as we have seen it on television.<br />
Nor are they the frontiers that many of us, including my wife and myself<br />
came to, when we came back to Australia from abroad, because those<br />
were, in my case and you can duplicate it in yours the sort of frontier<br />
in the North of Victoria. There was no electricity and you had something<br />
called a Coolgardie safe if you wanted to keep anything cool. This was a<br />
contraption in W~ ihich you put a lot of water at the top and which was supposed<br />
to keep your food from going bad, but I was never able to discover in fact<br />
that it did. But these new frontiers are not like that. In these places,<br />
there are shopping centres houses with air-conditioning..... swimming<br />
pools community centres. The development going on is superb and<br />
the advantages to this nation are immense and the advantages to those<br />
United States citizens who provide some capital towards it are also<br />
immense a co-operation there to the benefit, I think, of both of us. A<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
co-operation in bases such as the North-West Cape base, such as the<br />
other joint defence arrangements that we have. You could go through a<br />
whole field and we would find, I think, as we went through that there<br />
have probably not been any other instances where two nations have so<br />
closely co-operated for what they believe to be the good of all.<br />
Indeed, I would like to cast your minds back to something<br />
I once said in the White House when I was being entertained by President<br />
Nixon because it came in for a little comment in Australia at the time.<br />
And having considered it, I think it was quite a reasonable thing to say.<br />
refer to something about " Waltzing Matilda With You" and I would like<br />
to tell you the background of that. I had been talking about the difficulties<br />
that former Presidents of the United States had had to encounter, difficulties<br />
which Lincoln had had to encounter in his problems over State/ Federal<br />
financial relations, and which in many respects, because there was so<br />
much division in the country then, bore some relation to the problems<br />
and difficulties that President Johnson and President Nixon had to bear on<br />
Vietnam. But I finished up saying and I still believe this is true<br />
whenever there is an attempt by the United States or the United Kingdom<br />
or any other country to try to raise the living standards of the underprivileged<br />
peoples of the world, to try to improve the economies of underdeveloped<br />
countries, to try to ensure that countries will retain their independence<br />
against attack, whenever there are such endeavours and such approaches<br />
by such countries, then we will go " A-Waltzing Matilda" with you. Perhaps<br />
it should have been phrased " for we will then endeavour to follow the same<br />
road" becauc I think we would and have endeavoured to follow the same<br />
road of trying to lift the living standards by trying to develop the economies<br />
and by trying to see that people govern themselves in independent states.<br />
All these things of which I have spoken are areas of closer<br />
co-operation. We have no doubt whatever that should we ever need<br />
assistance in time of danger to us, the United States would provide that<br />
assistance to us as we would help in our way in troubles she might have.<br />
We believe that the basic desires of our people and the United States<br />
people and our Governmentl and the United States Government are the<br />
same, both for the widening of the horizons of life for our citizens and<br />
both for attempting to bring peaceful conditions and better living conditions<br />
to peoples in the world outside our countries.<br />
In all these matters, there is a basic sameness, a basic<br />
unity between our countries. This is something your Association can<br />
help to further and this is why the Government takes such an interest<br />
in your Association and what it is doing.<br />
There are, of course, other fields in which co-operation<br />
between our countries is not as entirely close as perhaps we would like<br />
it to be. For example, it would be very nice if the United States, having<br />
an insatiable appetite for meat, were to enable us to export, in order to </p>
<p>meet this appetite, some of the meat which at the moment we are not<br />
allowed to send there. There are other areas such as sugar which seems<br />
to be engraved on the heart of my friend and I say that genuinely my<br />
friend, Senator Fulbright, as deeply as Calais was engraved on the heart of<br />
Queen Mary. There is the long-standing question of whether it might not<br />
be good and strengthening for both our countries if the kind of wool which<br />
we can produce in Australia were allowed in to the United States of America<br />
without such a crippling duty on it. But these, Sir, are merely passing<br />
thoughts and introduced into this gathering in the hope and the belief that<br />
all the areas of co-operation I have spelt out and which this Association<br />
so strongly supports will be able to spread over in time into these other<br />
areas of co-operation. But having said all that, and having at timcsendeavoured<br />
to be not too deadly serious in saying it, it still remains completely and<br />
irrevocably true that if this world is to be, in time, the kind of world that<br />
we would like it to be, then the co-operation of men and women of goodwill<br />
in the United States and Australia and in other countries must be fostered.<br />
It must be furthered and the men and women of each of these countries<br />
must learn more of each other, must learn more of their ideals, must<br />
learn more of their problems. This you are doing. For this we give you<br />
our thanks. And because of this I have been proud and honoured to have<br />
been asked to talk to you today. </p>
