    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government is investing $4.5 million to help restore the critically endangered woodland of Western Sydney’s Cumberland Plain.</p>
<p>This funding is part of our 20 Million Trees programme, which aims to plant 20 million trees by 2020, including one million trees in the Cumberland Conservation Corridor.</p>
<p>The Cumberland Plain woodland is unique and rare. There are plants and animals in this region that are not found in any other part of Australia.</p>
<p>Funding will flow to three local groups – Greening Australia Ltd, Greater Sydney Local Land Services and Muru Mittigar Ltd – that have the knowledge, passion and commitment necessary to help protect one of Australia’s most threatened bushlands.</p>
<p>These organisations will roll out thirteen tree planting projects across the region, focussing on community conservation, creek corridor restoration and increased protection for threatened species. The programmes will help create local employment and training opportunities.</p>
<p>Our Green Army teams will be integrated into several of the projects, building on the work already being done in the region.<br />
                                                               <br />
We want to preserve this important habitat for future generations, and will invest $15 million over the next four years to help protect it.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to planting 20 million trees by 2020, re-establishing green corridors and urban forests in urban and regional Australia.</p>
<p>This is part of our National Landcare Programme which is investing $1 billion over four years to help protect and conserve Australia’s natural environment and support local sustainable agriculture projects.</p>
