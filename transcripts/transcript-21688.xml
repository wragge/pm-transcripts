    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that formal recognition will be given to those Australians who provided emergency humanitarian assistance in the wake of the Boxing Day tsunamis and the Nias earthquake.  The Queen has approved an extension of the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal to enable recognition of the humanitarian services provided to the peoples of Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives who were devastated by the tsunamis and the subsequent earthquake.</p>
<p>It is the Government's view that the spirit of generosity in our fellow Australians who willingly go to areas of great humanitarian need, at some risk to themselves, to offer assistance as part of the Australian humanitarian response should be formally recognised in the Australian honours system.</p>
<p>In examining ways in which the tsunami assistance could be recognised, a shortcoming in the honours system was revealed, as this medal could not be awarded under the existing regulations. It was necessary to extend the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal to meet the exceptional circumstances caused by the tsunami and the Nias earthquake.</p>
<p>Those who were deployed as part of the Australian contribution to the affected regions and who meet the eligibility requirements of service in relation to the tsunamis and the related earthquake in Nias, Indonesia will qualify for the award.</p>
<p>  The Australian Government believes that this special extension of the humanitarian overseas award is warranted to adequately recognise the outstanding contribution made by members of the Australian Defence Force and other government and non-government organisations, such as the Australian aid agencies, that responded immediately and compassionately to the needs of those affected by these extreme natural disasters.</p>
<p>  The medal may be awarded posthumously to enable the families of those who are killed in providing humanitarian service to receive the medal.  We are as a nation saddened by the death of nine of our ADF personnel and the injuries of two others on the Sea King helicopter.  Their work in providing emergency aero-medical aid to survivors of the recent earthquake was of critical importance in sustaining the life and dignity of the Nias survivors.   Along with their colleagues, the members of the ADF aero-medical team will be eligible to receive the award.</p>
<p>On behalf of the people of Australia I thank all those who served with such distinction.</p>
<p>Contrary to recent media reports, the awarding of the proposed Australian Defence Medal to the victims of the Sea King tragedy has not been denied due to a delay in approval by The Queen.  The Queen has already provided in-principle approval for this medal and an announcement about the medal is expected in the near future.  </p>
