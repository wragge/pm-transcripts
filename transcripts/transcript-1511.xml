OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE DALWOOD WYBONG PARK<br />
WINERY, N. S. W.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr, Harold Holt. 17th February, 1967<br />
Mr. Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Geoffrey Penfold Hyland,<br />
my Ministerial Colleagues of the Commonwealth and State Governments,<br />
members of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales,<br />
many distinguished guests, employees of this historic firm of Penfolds,<br />
ladies and gentlemen: " If all be true that I do think<br />
There are five reasons why we drink aber<br />
Good wine, a friend, or being dry,*<br />
Or lest we may be by and bye IR<br />
For any other reason why.<br />
Now I didn't get that out of somebody's book of quotations.<br />
I learnt that one on a visit to New Zealand about a week or so ago, and<br />
the Minister for Agriculture was with me and I said that one of my most<br />
pleasant chores of the week ahead when I returned to Australia was this<br />
official opening of the Dalwood Estate Vineyard and Winery, and he said,<br />
" Well, this may help you. This demonstrates the respectability of wine<br />
drinking which was expressed by -an eighteenth century Anglican priest<br />
named Aldrich." My subsequent researches have confirmed that I felt<br />
I knew all along, that both in the Old Testament and the New Testament<br />
are to be found authorities for the proposition that the moderate consumption,<br />
certainly of table wine, has been encouraged by the most respectable<br />
authorities from the earliest of recorded time.<br />
We find that in the Old Testament we are told that " wine makes<br />
glad the heart of man", and the lbw Testament being rather more modern<br />
in approach and presumably a certain amount of travel having been undertaken<br />
in the interval, warned against the danger of drinking water. " Drink no<br />
longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and as one of<br />
the most regular travellers for the Commonwealth Government I would urge<br />
that note of caution upon you.<br />
And, of course, there are so many valuable injunctions to the man<br />
in public life from those who have written about this precious commodity. It<br />
was Emerson who told us a man would be eloquent if you give him good wine,<br />
and if I go beyond the time appointed so that we miss a second parachute jump,<br />
you will know where to attribute the responsibility for that. And we are told<br />
by the Germans that a day without wine is a day without sunshine, and this<br />
would be accepted, I think, by many of us who would also agree with Horace<br />
when he told us to drown our care in wine.<br />
Now I myself am a great believer in temperance, including<br />
temperance itself. I think we should be temperate in all things including<br />
temperance, and that gives us a certain amount of flexibili ty in our approach<br />
to the problems of life. And I am sure that it's been a great pleasure to all<br />
of us to have come along here today as guests of Mr. Penfold Hyland and all<br />
associated with this historic name in the wine industry of Australia, and in<br />
these beautiful surroundings find ourselves together enjoying delightful food,<br />
agreeable company and very enjoyable wine. / 2. </p>
<p>2-<br />
Now I mention the five reasons and I think that most of the,<br />
if not all, can be exemplified here. Good wine we have enjoyed that.<br />
I am told that something went wrong with the works yesterday and 200 gallons<br />
flooded down the path inbetween these casks and will not be consumed not by<br />
human beings, anyhow, in future. I don't know, 04ether we should rise and<br />
pause for a moment to regret that circumstance, but we have enjoyed good<br />
wine, Good friends, as I have looked around this room I see rma ny<br />
people who have come from afar, from Sydney and beyond, braved the hazards<br />
of the climate and the roads, which cannot be maintained on the quite inadequate<br />
grant that the Commonwealth Government makes for them, but at the end of<br />
the road of pioneering here, they are in agreeable company -and these very<br />
pleasant circumstances. I am sure, Geoffrey, we have all felt it worthwhile<br />
and that we rejoice with you in a day which honours the opening of this new<br />
establishment contributing so much tc the future prosperity and progress of<br />
the Hunter Valley. Now the Hunter Valley is itself, of course, one of the great winegrowing<br />
districts of Australia and I predict that as people round the rest of the<br />
world over the years come to appreciate the quality of Australian wines it will<br />
become one of the notable wine growing districts of the world, and recognised<br />
as such. I found it very impressive to learn from the facts supplied to me<br />
that if there is brought into wine production the thousand or eleven hundred<br />
acres which are under the control in this area of this organisation, the volume<br />
of wine produced will be far in excess of that produced by all the other vineyards<br />
at this moment of the Hunter Valley. And so this is a very remarkable<br />
development in an area which has already contributed much to the propperity<br />
and progress of this state of New South Wales, and here we have the elements<br />
of a great national asset which will carry Australia's name to the approval<br />
of those who consume its products beyond our own boundaries and far around<br />
the world. Now one could say a great deal about the wine industry and I should<br />
perhaps reserve that for a more suitable occasion in the Parliament. It's rather<br />
interesting to learn as one studies the facts that the consumption in Australia of<br />
table wine and this has been perhaps partly at the expense of the fortified<br />
wines but of table wine has more than trebled over the past ten years. Now<br />
that's not merely because we brought in a lot of immigrants from Europe who<br />
have been accustomed to drinking wine as some of our people have been<br />
accustomed to drinking beer. It's also attributable to the fact that as we<br />
native Australians learn sonmthing of what wine can mean in more agreeable<br />
living for ourselves, our own consumption of it has grown, and I believe it<br />
could grow considerably more than it has. We have great natural advantages<br />
for wine growing through most of Australia, or certainly many parts of most<br />
of the States of Australia, an d I would gladly join with Mr. Penfold Hyland<br />
and other spokesmen for the names that rate high in the wiine industry in a<br />
campaign against what I might term at this point of time " snobbism' in the<br />
consumption of wine.<br />
You know there's a lot of guff that goes on in the consumption of<br />
wine in public places, and the ritual that has developed around this, more<br />
particularly over recent years, is quite terrifying to the average casual<br />
restaurant visitor or hotel-goer. I had quite a run of experience of it in<br />
New Zealand when I was there where most of our meals were spent out at<br />
public places. You know. the drill that one goes through Having<br />
settled yourselves down and got comfortable, if your host is sufficiently alert,<br />
/ 3. </p>
<p>-3<br />
he will summmn tbe wine waiter. That will depend to some extent upon the<br />
degree of service as to the time interval which then elapses. The wine<br />
waiter will then present you with usually -a somewhat fly-speckled little<br />
journal which contains what the house may or may not have to offer.<br />
Frequently one is disappointed in finding that it's ou t of stock or somebody<br />
else had the b ottle the night before, but a further interval passes and then<br />
finally along comes the bottle usually if it's a white wine or a sparkling<br />
wine, contained i~ n some ice bucket, there's a further delay while it's<br />
twisted around and juggled about a bit, and then with a flourish the fellow<br />
will remove the cork and he'll bring the cork over you to sniff. You are<br />
terrified you're going to do the wrong thing at that stage. You'll either<br />
tell him to take it back when it's perfectly good or you'll bravely say<br />
"~ go on with it" when you suspect that it mightn't be as good as you would<br />
hope. And then he'll give you a certain portion to taste. Now I have been<br />
host on a good number of public ce-cas ions when wine was consumed and<br />
I've run a bit of a mental graph on these things and I find that about two<br />
times out of five, he never comes back to the fellow who's done the tasting.<br />
And by the time you have gone through all these processes you're about<br />
into the second or third course and cursing inwardly that it didn't come<br />
earlier. Now, my upbringing on drinking with meals occurred shortly<br />
after I left the university, at a quite modest restaurant, as it was then, but<br />
it's become rather more posh establishment now in Melbourne, known as<br />
the Florentino. For 2/ 6d. in the currency of those days one had a three<br />
course meal and a little bottle of wine that was plonked on the table according<br />
to whether you said red or white. I haven't used the word " plonked" with<br />
any special significance, because I used to find this wine quite potable, and<br />
if one was sufficiently injudicious, or didn't have enough work to do as in<br />
those depression years most of us didn't, to consume that q uite small bottle<br />
( about half the current small bottle size) and say you'd like another, you paid<br />
an extra sixpence for that, and if you wanted lobster mayonnaise extra, you<br />
paid an extra sixpence for that. Well some might say they were the good<br />
old days. We didn't have as many sixpences in those days perhaps as we<br />
do now but th-e fact of the matter was that you had a good potable wine that<br />
had no nonsense about it. It was there from the time you started your meal<br />
and away you went. If you wanted more it came quickly to you, and those<br />
of you who have gone to Italy in recent years will know how you can still<br />
repeat that process there to this day.<br />
Now it was Omar Khayam who told us, as most of you will recall:<br />
" I wonder often what the vintners buy one half so precious as the stuff they sell."<br />
I'd like to just amend that slightly and put " what the restauranters or hoteliers<br />
buy one half so precious as the stuff they sell" because I find it something of<br />
a deterrent to sit down either at a hotel or a restaurant, pick up the wine list<br />
and find that in their enthusiasm they've added something upwards of a 1007%<br />
to what I know that wine can be bought at, not necessarily wholesale, but even<br />
retail. And I think it's a very abort-sighted policy because you always think<br />
hard about the second bottle when you know you are paying over 100% on the<br />
price you could have it at home, and if by chance at a cheaper level you are<br />
able to consume two or three bottles, well one is less resistant to the port<br />
or the brandy which might follow as a logical consequence, and so I would<br />
like to see the wine industry make its best efforts not only on Governments<br />
and I don't reject or object to the representations we receive from the wine<br />
industry but to use their influence to reduce the ritual so that more casual<br />
wine drinkers will be encouraged to do it without feeling that they are exposing<br />
themselves embarrassingly in public places and also to see that the price<br />
reaches the consumer at a reasonable level. / 4. </p>
<p>4-<br />
Now I said that as a Government we meet the industry from<br />
time to time. Quite obviously if one studies the facts this is a highly<br />
favoured industry. There are very few areas of agreeable human<br />
experience that remain untaxed by governments. I suppose love-making<br />
is one and wine drinking is another. There are not many more that I can<br />
think of. I perhaps should have th ought of this when I was with the<br />
Premiers yesterday and they were wanting to open up new avenue-, of<br />
taxation. But for our part we impose no tax burden on table wines.<br />
I don't think we do, Geoffrey, on fortified wines. We certainly do on<br />
brandy, but even here we have a smaller charge on brandy than we do<br />
on the other spirits, which again creates a grievance with those wh'<br />
manufacture the other spirits. In other words, you can't win in th-: sbusiness<br />
of government, but none of us has ever regretted what we have<br />
done in respect of the wine industry and the preference which has enabled<br />
the surplus production of wine to be converted in many instances to brandy<br />
and to give the Australian public the benefit of that lower price.<br />
Now I don't want to weary you with anecdotes for they bristl. e<br />
through the history of wine but there is one which I might leave with you<br />
before I movre on, a story which appealed to me about Winston Churchill,<br />
who of course did his best during his lifetime to assist the wine industry<br />
to the best of his ability. And at one international conference in a very<br />
large room Winston Churchill enlivened what was otherwise a dreary patch<br />
of discussion by saying that the champagne he had drunk through a lifetime<br />
would have filled that room. He had his scientist friend with him<br />
he used to travel round with him the ? vbmber of the House of<br />
his name escapes me at the moment but he quickly made some mental<br />
calculations of the quantity which on average he would assume Sir Winston<br />
to have consumed and he had to tell him that he wouldn't have filled that<br />
large room. He would have only brought it up to a level of about tw-o feet<br />
and the story runs that Sir Winston was in a rather depressed state of mind<br />
for the rest of the proceedings.<br />
But he is only one of a long line of notable public men who have<br />
found in the consumption of wine in good company, relaxation, a source of<br />
refreshment and an encouragement to get on with the tasks ahead.<br />
Now my purpose, as you have been told, is formally to declare<br />
open the Vineyard and the Winery of Dalwood Estates, but before I do that<br />
as my final act I am going to ask you all to rise and join me in a toast, and<br />
the toast is this: There is not with us today a very wonderful lady to whom<br />
Penfolds means very much indeed and who has meant very much to Penfolds,<br />
and I'm going to ask you to join me, as I am sure Geoffrey would approve,<br />
in drinking a toast to Mrs. Gladys Penfold Hyland. I hope she is able to<br />
hear what we are saying but if not, on your behalf and to her, I say from<br />
all of us thankyou Gladys for all you've meant to Penfolds and thankyou for<br />
being such a wonderful person as I find all the Penfolds are. So here's to<br />
Gladys. And I now have very great pleasure in formally and officially<br />
declaring open the Dalwood Estates Vineyard and Winery. </p>
