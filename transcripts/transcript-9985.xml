    <content><![CDATA[<p>Along, I am sure, with all Australians, I was horrified to hear of the tragic mass muirder which took place at Port Arthur this afternoon. </p>
<p>It was on a scale probably unprecedented in Australia's history. </p>
<p>To those countless people left bereaved by this shocking and senseless act, I extend the sympathy of the Australian Government. </p>
<p>I have already spoken to the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Rundle, regarding the tragedy. We remain in touch regarding developments. </p>
