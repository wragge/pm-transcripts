FOR PRESS 14 JANUARY 1977<br />
SECRETARY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY<br />
The Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, today announced that<br />
Cabinet had approved that Sir Alan Cooley, presently Chairman<br />
of the Public Service Board, will become the Secretary to the<br />
Department of Productivity.<br />
The Governor General has been advised of the Cabinet approval<br />
and the appointment would be considered by the Executive<br />
Council as soon as possible.<br />
In announcing Sir Alan's appointment, Mr. Fraser said that in<br />
1976 Sir Alan's re-appointment as Chairman of the Public<br />
Service Board for a further period of five years was approved.<br />
However, following the establishment of the new Department of<br />
Productivity, the Minister, Mr. Macphee, had approached Sir Alan<br />
to see if he would consider accepting the appointment as<br />
Permanent Head. ' I left the decision entirely to Sir Alan'<br />
said the Prime Minister. ' Whilst I regarded it as essential<br />
that we have a person of stature and capacity to take on the<br />
challenging task the Government has set the new Department of<br />
Productivity, I would not for a moment have contemplated Sir<br />
Alan's appointment to the position unless he himself was<br />
willing to accept it.'<br />
Mr. Fraser added that Sir Alan had performed most ably and<br />
with great integrity since his appointment as Chairman of the<br />
Public Service Board on 1 November 1971, during a period of<br />
major reconstruction and significant policy changes in the<br />
management of the Public Service. ' His acceptance now of appointment<br />
to the Department of Productivity, after more than five<br />
years as Chairman, accorded with Sir Alan's own publicly expressed<br />
views on movement of senior officials, which were in harmony with<br />
comments I myself made in November 1975 in relation to Permanent<br />
Heads" the Prime Minister said.<br />
Mr. Fraser added that his Government, when establishing the<br />
Department of Productivity, had indicated that there was a<br />
need to provide a technically-orientated body with responsibility<br />
in the area of increased industrial productivity.<br />
The Prime Minister said today that the Government sees the<br />
establishment of the Department of Productivity as being a<br />
most significant long-term measure. ' The improvement of our<br />
national productivity is crucial to improved living standards for </p>
<p>2<br />
for every Australian. The Department of Productivity, under<br />
the leadership of its Minister and Secretary, will be looking<br />
beyond the day-to-day problems which catch the headlines and<br />
will seek to work with both employers and employees to integrate<br />
capital investment, new technology and various means of improving<br />
the job satisfaction, training and re-training of employees.<br />
' Whilst I am sorry to be losing the services of Sir Alan as<br />
Chairman of the Public Service Board, given the importance I<br />
attach to the new Department of Productivity, I welcome his<br />
decision to accept the appointment', the Prime Minister said.<br />
' He will bring to the Department a depth of knowledge of<br />
technology, production techniques, industrial relations and<br />
management generally.'<br />
It is intended that Sir Alan will take a period of recreation<br />
leave, which was planned earlier, before he takes up his new<br />
appointment. The Prime Minister said that he has asked Sir Alan to submit<br />
to him a list of names of persons who should be considered for<br />
appointment as Chairman of the Public Service Board. The Prime<br />
Minister added that an announcement on succession would be made<br />
as soon as possible. </p>
