THE HON R J L HUMlE AC HP<br />
TRADE AND INVSTIT CNEEC<br />
LONDON 22 JU= 1989<br />
Mr chairman<br />
Ministerial Colleagues<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
I welcome you all most warmly to this significant,<br />
unprecedented and timely conference. The concept which this<br />
conference embodies originated in the discussions I had with<br />
the British Prime Minister during her visit to Australia<br />
last August for our Bicentenary. Mrs Thatcher and I agreed<br />
and we do agree on many things that, strong as the<br />
traditional association between Britain and Australia<br />
remains, there was a need to inject it with a new vitality<br />
and a new sense of purpose; in Mrs Thatcher-Is own words " to<br />
modernize the relationship". And specifically, ye agreed to<br />
set in train a process to identify and develop potential new<br />
areas for trade and investment, to the mutual benefit of<br />
both our countries. This conference is the first step<br />
towards that very important objective.<br />
in this process, the first need is to provide an opportunity<br />
for British and Australian business leaders to get together<br />
and explore mutually beneficial ways of advancing our<br />
investment and trading links. This is what this occasion is<br />
really all about.<br />
I have taken a deep personal interest In the preparation for<br />
this conference? and without presuming to speak for<br />
Mrs Thatcher, I can say that we are both gratified and<br />
encouraged by the enthusiastic response by so many<br />
distinguished business leaders from both countries. </p>
<p>The importance the Australian Government attaches to it is<br />
attested by the presence of my colleagues, the Minister for<br />
Industry,, Technology and Commerce ( Senator John Button) who<br />
is your Co-Chairman and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade ( Senator Gareth Evans). I should mention that the<br />
Minister for Defence ( Mr Kim Beazigy) is also with us in<br />
London. The four of us comprise the most senior Ministerial<br />
representation assembled in London together for working<br />
purposes, certainly since the war, and probably since<br />
Federation. Mr Chairman<br />
I put forward four interlocking propositions which, I<br />
believe, underpin the purpose of this conference.<br />
First, the traditional association between Britain and<br />
Australia, based on a shared heritage of history, culture<br />
and institutions, will in future increasingly draw its<br />
strength, vitality and relevance from our economic links.<br />
Second, while Australia seeks to enmesh its economy with the<br />
rapidly growing economies of our region, and while Britain<br />
merges its economy with Europe, then* historic developments<br />
should not become mutually exclusive pre-occupations, but<br />
rather, part of a comnon drive towards a more open and<br />
expanding world trade order.<br />
Third, the economies of both our countries are undergoing a<br />
period of dynamic change in Australia's case, a massive<br />
restructuring, and a move towards a greater capacity in<br />
manufacturing and services.<br />
And finally, I put a fourth proposition: that all of these<br />
developments present new, challenging, and mutually<br />
beneficial opportunities for the trading, business and<br />
investing communities of both our countries.<br />
Mr chairman<br />
The most remarkable aspect of the British-Australian<br />
economic relationship is not the profound changes which have<br />
occurred over the past two centuries. What is really<br />
remarkable is its enduring substance and strength.<br />
The latest figures on foreign investment show that Britain<br />
has overtaken the United States as the major investor in<br />
Australia. That applies both to accumulated investment and current<br />
investment in 1987-8B. </p>
<p>The total level of British investment at 30 June 1988 was<br />
$ 44 billion. The investment flow for the year was<br />
$ 6.7 billion.<br />
Britain was also the principal host country for investment<br />
from Australia $ 4.7 billion in 1987-88. Australian<br />
investments in Britain totalled $ 14.1 billion, second only<br />
to our investments in the United States. On the trade<br />
front, Britain remains our third largest-source of imports<br />
and Australia's sixth largest export destination.<br />
Clearly, this is a very substantial association indeed. The<br />
interdependence of our two economies remains significant.<br />
our trade and investment flows are complemntary. They<br />
continue to contribute to improved living standards in both<br />
countries. This is a sound and broad basis for the<br />
revitalisation of our relationship.<br />
And we must not lose sight of the substantial<br />
interdependence which already exists, even as we look<br />
increasingly to new opportunities and new fields of<br />
endeavour as Britain focuses on closer integration with<br />
Europe, and as Australia seeks to involve itself in the<br />
exciting developments in the Asia Pacific region, the<br />
fastest growing region in the world.<br />
It remains important that in pursuing these opportunities we<br />
should recognise the mutuality of our interests and the<br />
interdependence of our economies. And this recognition<br />
should be reflected in our decision-making at both<br />
government and business levels.<br />
This will not only strengthen our bilateral ties, but<br />
provide an example of potential gains from co-operation at a<br />
time when the openness of the world trading system is under<br />
threat.<br />
A good example of the sort of supportive interdependence I<br />
have in mind is the adoption by the Australian coal industry<br />
of longwall mining techniques which has provided an export<br />
market for British mining equipment.<br />
This has led to greater efficiencies in the Australian<br />
industry. Obviously, what we are seeking now are assurances<br />
of unimpeded access for that cheaper coal into the UK in the<br />
light of pending privatisation of the UK electricity<br />
industry. The domestic policy stance Britain takes on this issue of<br />
this kind impinges directly on our bilateral relationship. </p>
<p>But against the backdrop of Europe 1992 it can have much<br />
wider implications. The external policies adopted by the<br />
European community at that time depend very much upon the<br />
domestic policy preoccupations of member countries.<br />
Australia looks to Britain to lead by example and to help<br />
ensure that Europe 1992 becomes not " Fortress Europe", but a<br />
mighty bridge to a more integrated and open world economy.<br />
Like Britain, Australia is a committed aftocate of a more<br />
open world trading system. Australia's interests will be<br />
vitally af fected by the outcome of the current Uruguay Round<br />
or multilateral trade negotiations. Our desire is to see<br />
the GATT framework strengthened and trade placed on a fairer<br />
and more open basis.<br />
It is clear the Round cannot be brought to a satisfactory<br />
conclusion in the absence of a package embracing all<br />
subjects under discussion. The view of the Cairns group,<br />
including Australia, and of the developing countries among<br />
others, is that there can be no successful conclusion<br />
without a satisfactory result on agriculture. We all see<br />
agriculture as pivotal in securing a successful outcome to<br />
the Round.<br />
Some of you may be aware that there are Australians,<br />
certainly one very prominent Australian, so enamoured of the<br />
European Community that they want Australia to join it and<br />
indeed believe that we should have little difficulty in<br />
getting in. The concept has been expressed in the rather<br />
eye-catching words: " Australia is the last bastion of<br />
Europe". From the vantage point of the Treasury benches in Canberra,<br />
this intriguing idea does not appear to fall within the<br />
realm of politics as the art of the possible. In the<br />
elegant phrase of my colleague John Kerin, the Minister for<br />
Primary industries and Energy# who, with his agricultural<br />
responsibilities, knows a little about the EC, it fails the<br />
test of propinquity, let alone contiguity.<br />
We are directing our efforts closer to home.<br />

our region.<br />
in recognition of the increasing interdependence of the<br />
countries of our region, I recently proposed a formalisation<br />
of regional co-operation aimed at better harnessing the<br />
potential for regional growth and development through the<br />
creation of new consultative and institutional arrangements.<br />
Serious discuss ions are now underway in the region on ways<br />
to implement my proposal. </p>
<p>we are hopeful that a vehicle f or intergovernmntal<br />
co-operation in the region will. provide a mans for<br />
encouraging competitive efftorts to enhance prospects for<br />
trade liberalisation in the context of the MW Round. it<br />
will also provide a forum to increase the dialogue on ways<br />
to reduce regional trade barriers consistent with the GATT<br />
and, generally, to help identify and build upon coon<br />
regional interests.<br />
Like Europe 1992, the emergence of the Asia-Pacific region<br />
as a major economic grouping will have a profound impact on<br />
the future shape and character of the world trading system.<br />
It would be foolish to attempt to predict where that will<br />
lead us as a global economy. What does seem obvious,<br />
however, is that there will most likely be an<br />
intensification of competition in both Europe and the<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Australian industry is veil placed to meet this challenge in<br />
our region and a number of leading Australian corporations<br />
have already taken up strategic positions in Europe in the<br />
lead up to 1992, including forming alliances with British<br />
counterparts. For example, a recent survey undertaken by our High<br />
Commission of Australian firms established in the UK<br />
revealed that most are well prepared for 1992, are intending<br />
to inorease investment in both Britain and Europe and are<br />
actively seeking British partners interested in joint<br />
ventures. I congratulate this initiative and believe that there are<br />
considerable benefits offered by such collaboration both<br />
here and in Australia.<br />
Much of the recent investment by Asia-Pacific countries in<br />
the UK and mainland Europe has been reported an strategic or<br />
defensive and aimed at securing a foothold in Europe before<br />
1992.<br />
Similarly, investment by Australian firms in the UK over the<br />
last couple of years is seen as-providing a base to<br />
penetrate the European market.<br />
There is a degree of truth in these assessments. But they<br />
can be simplistic and even misleading.<br />
They contain a danger of a distorted view of our existing<br />
bilateral association.<br />
An important determinant of Australian investment flows into<br />
Britain has been the relative openness of your economy. </p>
<p>I am aware, however, that recent decisions to refer proposed<br />
acquisitions to your Mergers and Monopolies Comission have<br />
created some unease in Australian business circles,, concern<br />
which my Government has also felt on occasion.<br />
Short term social and cultural apprehensions in all<br />
countries which encourage foreign investment are expressed<br />
from time to time. However, unnecessary uncertainties or<br />
delays must not be allowed to hamper legitimate business<br />
decisions which ultimately underpin the living standards of<br />
all countries.<br />
We urge the British Government to ensure that decisions<br />
relating to proposed mergers and acquisitions are based on<br />
their economic merits and the processes involved and factors<br />
considered made clear and open.<br />
No doubt this conference will provide a forum for Australian<br />
companies to air their misgivings and to become better<br />
informed about investment policy in the UK. If there are<br />
misunderstandings we have an opportunity to clear them up.<br />
If there are effective non-economic constraints on<br />
investment in the UK we urge you to make clear the grounds<br />
on which such decisions will be made.<br />
In Australia's case, the liberalisation of foreign<br />
tnvestment policy is a significant element in the manssive<br />
task of re-structuring the Australian economy we have<br />
undertaken. we have moved on a broad front to open up the Australian<br />
economy and to make our industries more outward looking and<br />
internationally competitive.<br />
We have deregulated the financial sector. We have reduced<br />
tariffs substantially. We have overhauled the taxation<br />
system to ensure that decisions are based on expected<br />
economic returns, rather than on tax breaks.* We are tuning<br />
our education and training networks to meet the emerging<br />
needs of industry.<br />
we are reforming the operating of Government business<br />
enterprises to improve their efficiency and accountability<br />
by requiring enterprises to operate on a more commercially<br />
competitive basis.<br />
These reform have applied to Australia's Telecom and<br />
overseas Telecommunications Corporation and our domestic<br />
aviation and international air freight sectors.<br />
We have reduced public sector spending to its lowest<br />
proportion of the Gross Domestic Product since 1972. </p>
<p>Our comitment to microeconomic reform is on-going and in<br />
the recent months we have moved to reform the transport<br />
sector including coastal shipping and the waterfront.<br />
There have also been dramatic changes in Australia in wages<br />
policy and industrial relations.<br />
Due largely to the unique Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
established between the Government and the trade union<br />
ovemet, there has been unprecedented Wage restraint over a<br />
aix-year period. industrial relations have improved<br />
markedly with industrial disputes reduced by 60 per cent.<br />
Unit labour costs have fallen by 10 per cent.<br />
We have recently forged a wage/ tax trade-off package which<br />
will help restrain wage costs and which links wage increases<br />
to a fundamental restructuring of industrial awards. This<br />
is a good package for individuals and families. But it<br />
happens to be a very good package for business.<br />
Award restructuring provides a unique opportunity to tackle<br />
the barriers against improving efficiency and productivity<br />
in the workplace; enhancing skills formation and<br />
flexibility, and laying the foundation for greater<br />
competitiveness and growth in productivity.<br />
The combined effect of these domestic reforms has been to<br />
improve the competitiveness of Australian industry, while at<br />
the same time maintaining pressure towards efficiency by<br />
increasing the trade exposure of the Australian economy.<br />
Mr Chairman<br />
These are fundamental strengths underpinning the Australian<br />
economy. They are, of course, the very basis of our<br />
capacity to surmount the current problems of economic<br />
management we ar. addressing the problems associated with<br />
strong employment growth, strong investment growth and<br />
strong demand.<br />
The policies appropriate for the solution of those problems<br />
are firmly in place.<br />
The over-riding fact for business, for investors is that<br />
the essential basis for sustained and sustainable growth in<br />
the Australian economy has never been broader or stronger.<br />
Mr Chairman </p>
<p>I have indicated some of the areas for discussion at this<br />
conference. But, just as important will be the informal<br />
exchange of ideas and contacts that will no doubt be made<br />
outside of the conference. The task before us does not, of<br />
course,, end with this conference. It is only the beginning.<br />
I said in my opening remarks that Mrs Thatcher and I<br />
envisaged that this would be the start of a process.<br />
Towards the close of today' s proceedings,-Senator Button and<br />
I will be putting forward proposals to provide a follow-up<br />
for the work we have begun today together.<br />
While Mrs Thatcher and I have been concerned to bring you<br />
together, and to do all we can to build on the<br />
British-Australian friendship, both our governments have a<br />
basic commitment to letting business make the running on<br />
trade and investment decisions. Our main purpose today is<br />
to point to the new opportunities before us.<br />
But with opportunity goes responsibilityi and I hope that<br />
you will take from today'* s deliberations a better<br />
understanding of our respective economies and where we are<br />
heading; and, a renewed commitment to build profitably in<br />
all semnse of the word on the foundation we have mutually<br />
established over two hundred year~ s of association in the<br />
field of trade and investment. </p>
