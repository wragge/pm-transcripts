<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>On the dole - it strikes me there's a bit of a problem here.</p>
<p> If somebody, by the time they're in their teens and on the dole,</p>
<p> is illiterate, they've really got a problem. Now, how can you</p>
<p> force them around that problem?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the greatest problem is their illiteracy.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, but how can you force them to learn?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think you can. I think what is happening at the moment is</p>
<p> that people who are illiterate and innumerate and who can't get</p>
<p> jobs mainly because of their illiteracy and so forth, those people,</p>
<p> whilst they have the option of taking a remedial course, can opt to</p>
<p> discharge their dole obligation, their dole mutual obligation, by</p>
<p> some other activity. And the problem is not getting addressed. And</p>
<p> what we're doing is tightening that and saying if you are out</p>
<p> of work and if you are assessed as being illiterate or innumerate</p>
<p> as failing a basic test then as a condition of your getting the full</p>
<p> dole you should take a remedial course. In other words, we are making</p>
<p> it a condition of continued public support that the person in question</p>
<p> do something about that person's biggest problem. Now, I think</p>
<p> that is eminently reasonable.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I guess that's part of the problem. I assume that people who</p>
<p> are illiterate or innumerate, a lot of them wouldn't be that</p>
<p> way because of laziness or sloppiness, they've got a problem,</p>
<p> they've got a learning problem, how do you address that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, some of them, it is due to that but others it is not.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, how will you assess whether somebody can, in fact, learn?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, they will be reasonably assessed and...all the evidence</p>
<p> indicates that people who fail basic literacy and numeracy tests are</p>
<p> not all, it's not always due to a fundamental incapacity to learn,</p>
<p> it is due to a whole lot of other factors.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Who will assess them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they'll be assessed by trained people.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What, within the, within what, within job...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are certain basic tests that are already being applied,</p>
<p> where people accept, where people are unemployed and where they go</p>
<p> through an existing assessment procedure.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And what level of literacy are you looking for?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't have the technical description of it but it would</p>
<p> obviously be a basic, reasonable level. We're not expecting a</p>
<p> high level, we're just accepting or requiring or wanting something</p>
<p> that gives people a basic capacity. Can I just make the point that</p>
<p> even more now than ever before basic skills in literacy and numeracy</p>
<p> are more important. We don't have as many unskilled jobs. We</p>
<p> don't have as many manual jobs. We keep getting told that this</p>
<p> is a knowledge based society. We keep getting told all of those things</p>
<p> yet there seems to be some resistance in the community, although I</p>
<p> don't know how much, to the basic proposition that if the main</p>
<p> reason why somebody doesn't have a job is that they can't</p>
<p> read and write then something ought to be done about that problem</p>
<p> as a condition to a person getting the dole.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I guess compulsion is the problem. I think that might...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not...look, what we're saying to people is,</p>
<p> we're saying to people, look, if you can't get a job, we</p>
<p> are prepared as a society to provide you with a safety net, to provide</p>
<p> you with the unemployment benefit but in return for that unemployment</p>
<p> benefit being provided society says to you it is only reasonable that</p>
<p> you give back something in return. Now, one of the things they're</p>
<p> asking you to give back in return is the willingness, if you can't</p>
<p> read and write, to submit yourself to a remedial course. Now, that</p>
<p> is fair, that is reasonable. It's society going half way and</p>
<p> it's asking the recipient of society's help to go the other</p>
<p> half way.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will it involve a lot of people, do you believe?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't put a figure on it. I don't think it will involve,</p>
<p> it certainly won't involve hundreds of thousands. I think it</p>
<p> will involve a few thousand people.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will it cost a lot of money?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it will cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The ultimate I think is the dole removed for eight weeks if there's</p>
<p> continued refusal to learn or to try to learn. How would you expect</p>
<p> a person, a young person on the dole, they lose their dole for eight</p>
<p> weeks, how do they live?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if a person is unwilling to undertake the course then I think</p>
<p> they have to assess their situation. I mean, it's their responsibility.</p>
<p> I mean, what we're asking the people to do is to undertake a</p>
<p> course. We're not saying to the person that if at the end of</p>
<p> that course you've still got some fundamental learning problem</p>
<p> Â well, obviously we're not going to be insensitive to that.</p>
<p> But if a person says to society, I want your unemployment benefit</p>
<p> but I am not prepared to do anything about removing the thing that</p>
<p> more than anything else prevents my getting a job, well, isn't</p>
<p> society entitled to say, well, we'll only help you if you'll</p>
<p> help yourself.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, I'm a little worried about the...about classing an employment</p>
<p> service who might be deciding whether somebody has a learning difficulty</p>
<p> or whether they're literate or whether they can even learn.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but look, what happens is, there is a basic assessment made and</p>
<p> they are not all that difficult to make. And when those basic assessments</p>
<p> are made these people are told, well, it's a condition of your</p>
<p> getting the dole that you undertake the remedial course. It's</p>
<p> not a condition, if you're getting the dole, that you pass the</p>
<p> course with flying colours that you undertake the course.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, if they fail the course what happens?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it would depend upon the circumstances of it. If it's because</p>
<p> there's obviously a fundamental learning difficulty, well, you</p>
<p> can't blame the person, can you? But, I mean, you can blame the</p>
<p> person if the person refuses to try and do something about the problem.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So they could sit through the course, get their dole back, and not</p>
<p> pass the course.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think most of them will.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is this part of the plan to, sort of, extend the mutual obligation</p>
<p> philosophy for welfare recipients?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is an extension of it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are there any other areas you'd...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there could be, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Such as...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't made any decisions on those yet.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, what sort of areas will be...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's never any point in speculating about those things</p>
<p> until you've actually made up your mind what areas, otherwise</p>
<p> you just start hares running for no purpose at all.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, but it's fair to say that you are looking at other areas</p>
<p> of welfare for extending the obligations.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I believe in the principle of mutual obligation very strongly</p>
<p> and so does society I suspect. I think society says we should help</p>
<p> people who need help but to the extent that it is reasonable to do</p>
<p> so we should ask them to give something back in return and I think</p>
<p> that's fair.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think there's a lot of people bludging on the system,</p>
<p> not just dole but the general welfare system?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are some. There are some people who abuse it, exploit it. There</p>
<p> are some people who exploit any system. But the great bulk of people</p>
<p> don't but some people do.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a couple of calls on this issue. I'm interested</p>
<p> in the reaction. Hello, Peter, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, good morning. Look, the reason I rang Â I don't think</p>
<p> the Prime Minister's got a grip on what it's like to be</p>
<p> illiterate. As a young person I suffered from health problems at school.</p>
<p> I left school at about 14, 15 years of age, went into manual work.</p>
<p> I could read quite well, do mathematics, I couldn't spell. Basically</p>
<p> it rose because I had a speech impediment that the education didn't</p>
<p> cater for, didn't know how to treat. I was treated like I was</p>
<p> simpleton when I went to school.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you literate now?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'm literate now and literate because I married a lady who put</p>
<p> a pointed effort into teaching me how to spell. I went on and got</p>
<p> a law degree. The biggest problem with young people Â they will</p>
<p> feel down, they'll feel that there's no future for them,</p>
<p> they won't know where to turn and this policy will just turn</p>
<p> them off. It will push them deeper into their self-doubt. I mean,</p>
<p> society should be helping these people in creating jobs. When I left</p>
<p> school...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, rather than go back to that, Mr Howard, would you like to react</p>
<p> to that point?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't agree with what the gentlemen said about it pushing</p>
<p> them further into self-doubt. I mean, what we are doing, can I repeat,</p>
<p> is that we are asking people as a condition of getting the dole, we're</p>
<p> asking them to, or requiring them to, undertake a remedial course.</p>
<p> That's what we're doing. And that is recognising, in a very</p>
<p> practical way, the problem that they have. Now, I mean, the caller</p>
<p> is...starting to go on about job creation, I mean, that is a separate</p>
<p> argument. We're talking here about remedying a deficiency of</p>
<p> basic skills and what we are saying to people is, yes, we will help</p>
<p> you but you have got to help yourself as well. That's the principle,</p>
<p> it's a very simple principle, it's a very equal principle.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you Peter. Mark, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>G'day Neil. Good morning Prime Minister, how are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>A very quick question for you. I have got....one of my best friends</p>
<p> is actually 22 years old and I believe he has got the literacy and</p>
<p> intelligence of a grade two person. Now, he's a qualified chef.</p>
<p> He's done all his examinations and all his trade work through</p>
<p> the [inaudible] library. How would that affect, just a general question,</p>
<p> how would that affect him if the time comes where he became unemployed,</p>
<p> would that affect him at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But is he unemployed at the moment?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, he's not, no he's not.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No, he's not at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, you know it's an academic question, he is not unemployed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But if somebody loses their job having had one and they are illiterate</p>
<p> even if they have held down a job......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the principle will still be that if you are assessed as not</p>
<p> meeting the basic standards of literacy and numeracy one of the conditions</p>
<p> of continuing to get the unemployment benefit will be that you have</p>
<p> to undertake a remedial course. I mean, once again, we are saying</p>
<p> to people, if you fix this problem your chance of getting a job in</p>
<p> the future will be that much greater. What is wrong with saying to</p>
<p> those people, as a condition of getting the unemployment benefit you</p>
<p> undertake a remedial course. They are not required to pay for it,</p>
<p> we are providing....it's a condition of them getting the unemployment</p>
<p> benefit. I mean, is that so unreasonable? Is it so unreasonable that</p>
<p> a society that is prepared to say to people, we will not allow you</p>
<p> to starve in the streets, we will provide you with a basic level of</p>
<p> support, we will give you an unemployment benefit but we have identified</p>
<p> that you have a particular problem with literacy and numeracy and</p>
<p> in return for getting the support society wants to give you we want</p>
<p> you to do something about addressing that problem. Now, I cannot for</p>
<p> the life of me understand what is unfair, heartless, insensitive or</p>
<p> lacking in compassion about that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thanks Mark. We'll take another quick call on this and then move</p>
<p> onto other matters. Jean, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. As a mother of a person with dyslexia who was not given</p>
<p> any help at school and has striven through his 20s and obtained a</p>
<p> position I think Mr Howard is once again blaming the victim. Put the</p>
<p> money into the schools, have the children taught to read and write</p>
<p> before they leave school. My child can read, he cannot spell properly</p>
<p> because of his condition but he managed to work all this time and</p>
<p> I think Mr Howard is once again blaming the victim.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not blaming the victim. I admire what your son's been</p>
<p> able to achieve. If you are saying that schools shouldn't produce</p>
<p> people who can't read and write I think that's a fair criticism</p>
<p> of the education system. But the Federal Government is not responsible</p>
<p> for the primary and secondary education system of this country. That</p>
<p> is a responsibility of the States. Now, I think by and large the education</p>
<p> system of this country does a terrific job both public and private.</p>
<p> Obviously the number of people who come out of schools without some</p>
<p> of these basic skills does raise some questions about the priorities</p>
<p> of the education system. Perhaps we haven't had enough priority</p>
<p> given to what are called the basics. And I know it's an old argument</p>
<p> about what the emphasis ought to be in education but perhaps we went</p>
<p> through a generation where for whatever combination of reasons we</p>
<p> didn't focus enough on the basics. But whatever it is we have</p>
<p> to do at a practical level with people who are out of work and clearly</p>
<p> one of the reasons why they are out of work is that their literacy</p>
<p> and numeracy skills are down. And once again I go back to the basic</p>
<p> proposition, we are prepared to help them, we want to help them, we</p>
<p> will help them but we are asking in return that they give something</p>
<p> back. Now, that is not blaming the victim, it is exercising abundant</p>
<p> Australian common sense.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a quick break and come back with some other issues</p>
<p> for the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is it correct that Treasury has not modelled the employment</p>
<p> effects of a GST on services?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Treasury haven't, according to the evidence given yesterday,</p>
<p> they haven't, as part of their modelling, made any prediction,</p>
<p> quantitative prediction. And that's in line with a very, very</p>
<p> conservative nature of the calculations that have been made.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But should they not have had a look.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>.....well this is what a GST on services will do to jobs?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's certainly the advice....all the advice we have</p>
<p> is that it won't be negative but as far as the quantum of any</p>
<p> positive impact is concerned that wasn't included in the modelling</p>
<p> and that just indicates the conservative nature. But you will notice</p>
<p> that the evidence that they gave yesterday included a general expression</p>
<p> of the view that the employment impact of the package would be positive</p>
<p> but they just haven't put a figure on it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, have the Government done any modelling of the effect on employment</p>
<p> of a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's very, very difficult to do it in a way in....in</p>
<p> a sense of the last, sort of, thousand. You can't do that and</p>
<p> I don't....I mean, I have never represented that we have done</p>
<p> that. What I argued was that it would have, generally speaking, it</p>
<p> would have a very beneficial effect on employment and that remains</p>
<p> the Government's view and there was no evidence given by the</p>
<p> Treasury officials yesterday that in any way contradicted that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Gerry Adams is coming to Australia, why won't you meet him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there</p>
