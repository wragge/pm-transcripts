A NQ9 DATE<br />
M/ 115 31 July 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, WASHINGTON<br />
The following is the text of an address by the Prime<br />
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, to the<br />
National Press Club, Washington, at 1300 hours ( Washington time)<br />
30 July, 1973: " It is an honor for me to be asked to address representatives<br />
of the world's greatest and most free press in the capital of the<br />
world's greatest and most free democracy.<br />
The strength of each is the strength of both.<br />
In accepting your invitation I pay tribute to the<br />
manifest and enduring strength of both.<br />
It's been suggested that your chief interest today is to<br />
hear something about the changes in Australia's policies as a result<br />
of the change in the Australian Government, changes affecting our<br />
international relations and particularly the relations between<br />
Australia and the United States.<br />
True, there have been changes, important and, I naturally<br />
enough believe, beneficial changes. o. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
To put them in perspective, however, I should say three<br />
things at the outset.<br />
First, the changes the Australian Government has made are<br />
only part of a profound change taking place in the whole pattern of<br />
international relations, especially in the Western Pacific.<br />
The initiative for these changes came not, of course, from<br />
Australia, but from the United States.<br />
These initiatives President Nixon's initiatives have<br />
created a new reality for our region.<br />
Part of Australia's task has been to ratify the new<br />
reality. If in some specific matters such as recognition of the<br />
People's Republic of China and the ending of the last vestiges of<br />
Australia's military commitment in Indo-China Australia has been<br />
able to move immediately, it is largely because of a difference in<br />
obligations, not ultimate intentions.<br />
Clearly, the United States has obligations, commitments<br />
and burdens far more complex than those of Australia.<br />
Secondly, the ability of an Australian government, if so<br />
minded, to effect policy changes more rapidly than the United States,<br />
partly reflects a difference in our systems of government. / 3 </p>
<p>For instance, while it's not true, as suggested at least<br />
in sections of the Australian press, that the American Embassy in<br />
Canberra or the State Department was caught by surprise by the election<br />
results in my country, there may have been some surprise in some<br />
quarters at the speed with which our machinery allowed us to move.<br />
I did not have to wait three months for my inauguration.<br />
Three days after election day, I was able to form a Government<br />
with one other colleague. It was in fact the smallest administration<br />
to have responsibility for Australia since the first Duke of Wellington<br />
was last Prime Minister of England.<br />
In two weeks we were able to clear off a whole range of<br />
undertakings on which we have been campaigning.<br />
As long as it doesn't go beyond these walls, I'll confide<br />
in you that I found those two weeks quite exhilarating.<br />
SBut I do emphasise that nothing we did then, or which the<br />
rather larger Government has done since, was other than eminently<br />
predictable to anybody anywhere with any grasp of our specific<br />
policies or broader program.<br />
Knd thirdly, there is an essential continuity underlying<br />
the process of change a continuity in Australia's real national<br />
interests, in Australia's international obligations, in Australia's<br />
alliances and Australia's friendships.<br />
We seek new relationships. / 4 </p>
<p>We do not seek them at the expense of old, firm ones,<br />
I might bring these three points together the world<br />
pattern of change within which the Australian Government is acting,<br />
the predictability of the changes we are making. and the continuity<br />
within change with a single illustration.<br />
It is just two years since I went to Peking as Leader of<br />
the Opposition. In the Australian political context of the time, this was<br />
considered quite a risky business.<br />
What nobody knew even the world's best-informed and most<br />
alert and vigilant press was that Dr Kissinger was in Peking at<br />
precisely the same time,<br />
And when President Nixon made his historic announcement<br />
a week or so later, a quite remarkable transformation took place,<br />
I have to acknowledge I do so gladly that if it had not<br />
been for President Nixon's initiative, my own Peking visit would,<br />
given the Australian climate of the time, have been ' no political<br />
advantage to me, even as late as last December.<br />
Plainly, however, there could be no surprise that, within<br />
three weeks of our election, we were able to establish diplomatic<br />
relations with China on the exact terms we had for so long undertaken<br />
by removing Australia's China Embassy from Taipei to Peking, the<br />
capital of' China of which Taiwan is a province. </p>
<p>We are now quickly and successfully developing our contacts<br />
with China over the whole range of our mutual interests,<br />
But in our efforts to redress the imbalance of a generation<br />
of unthinking lostility towards China, we do not propose to introduce<br />
a new imbalance by discarding or downgrading older relationships.<br />
We do not intend to substitute a new distortion for old<br />
distortions. Undoubtedly the most important of those relationships is<br />
the American connection,<br />
This is symbolised by the Anzus Treaty. But Anzus is not<br />
the be-all and end-all of that relationship and never has been. P<br />
Important as Anzus is, the relationship is many-sided,<br />
and I am convinced deep and enduring, at all levels,<br />
There are many misconceptions about Anzus.<br />
It was originally designed as a reassurance to Australia<br />
and New Zealand against the possibility of uapanese military<br />
resurgence, Nobody would now view it in that light,<br />
Only a person totally insensitive to Japanese post-war<br />
asoirations would seek to encourage or anticipate such a resurgence. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Further, we have tended to overlook in Australia that<br />
Anzus invokes " the constitutional processes" of its Doartners,<br />
We have tended to ignore the role of Congress in those<br />
processes, Anzus happens to be one treaty which has not been seriously<br />
questioned by any section of C ingress,<br />
My government wants to move away from the narrow view that<br />
the Anzus Treaty is the only significant factor in our relations with<br />
the United States and the equally narrow view that our relations<br />
with the United States are the only significant factor in Australia's<br />
foreign relations. Anzus is important but it is only one anpect of the very<br />
wide range of interests and obligations linking with the United<br />
States, Our relations with the United States are very imnortant<br />
but again only one aspect of our interests and obligations in our<br />
region and around the world.<br />
But I repeat that as we seek to widen and strengthen<br />
those other relations, we do not do so at the expense of existing<br />
ones. Naturally there will be differences in approach to<br />
several. international questions between Australia and the United<br />
States. T believe, however, we should explore constructively<br />
the wide areas of agreement which unite us rather than </p>
<p>seek to emphasise those few matters on which we are divided or take<br />
a different approach towards the same basic end.<br />
I believe that this alliance is old enough and strong<br />
enough to stand a little frankness on both sides.<br />
I believe that the friendship which we offer America now,<br />
namely that of a robust middle power, making its own assessments and<br />
its own decisions in consultation with other interested countries9<br />
provides a better basis for a durable relationship of friendship<br />
between Australia and the United States than existed in the past,.<br />
We do not wish to grandstand or thumb our noses at the<br />
United States. When our interests do not coincide and wh~ en we disagree with<br />
the United States we snail, as a good friend shouid, say so firmly<br />
and frankly, usually, and -Dreferaoly, in private.<br />
But again. le' get this in perspective.,<br />
The most important matters are not those on whia-n the<br />
United States and Australia are likely to disagree, uinder this or any<br />
American or Australian administration,,<br />
What we wish to do, what we are doing, is to see that the<br />
official United States view is not the only view ever considered by<br />
an Australian Government, a. 78 </p>
<p>For example, in determining our position on any matter<br />
before the United Nations, I wish to know the view of our neighbours<br />
and our other friends just as 1 want to know the view of the United<br />
States, Nothing could be further from the truth than the suggestion<br />
that under the new Government Australia is going isolationist,,<br />
That is just as absurd as the idea that we are mioving into<br />
a different ideological orbit,<br />
Precisely what we are trying to do is to break out of a<br />
kind of ideological isolationism which has limited the conduct of<br />
our affairs in the past,<br />
I~ n our own region, in our dealings with all the countries<br />
of that region we think it' -time for an ideological holiday.<br />
That is why we have established diplomatic relations<br />
with a range of Governments as diverse as North Viet-N~ am and the<br />
Vatican,, It is, if you like, a policy of diplomatic even--handed. iess,<br />
It does not mean that Australia is not aligned,,<br />
We are by definition aligned, through Arizus.<br />
it does mean, however, that we propose that our dealings<br />
with all nations should be less ideologically orientated than<br />
hitherto,/ </p>
<p>-9-<br />
For twenty years I have been appalled at the damage we<br />
of the west have done to ourselves and to other peoples by our<br />
Western ideological preoccupations, particularly in South-East Asia,,<br />
We are not going to be readily forgiven for throwing away<br />
the chance we had for a settlement in Indo-China in 1954, after<br />
Korea, after Geneva,<br />
And if I had to sum up my own determination and that of<br />
my Government in a single sentence, I would state that I am<br />
determined that nothing Australia does by action or inaction will<br />
contribute to a second, final loss of opportunity,<br />
We have all been given a second chance,<br />
It must not be thrown away,<br />
This would be the unforgivable crime agtainst humanity,<br />
It may not be out of order for me to refer to something<br />
a distinguished correspondent of the " New York Timres" said to a<br />
senior Australian diplomat a coupl~ e of years ago about Australia.<br />
He said that even to the best informed American, Australia<br />
was merely a satellite of the United States; to the 20 million<br />
non-white Americans, or those of them who knew anything of Australia,<br />
it was a racist country; to the vast majority of Americans it was<br />
~ just a large and empty space on the map,. </p>
<p>~<br />
This judgment of two years ago is a harsh one indeed,<br />
As a description of Australia it is 90 per cent wrong, and<br />
it was wrong even at the time it was made.<br />
But it is just that 10 per cent of truth which can make<br />
an Australian uneasy, and which it is the concern of my Government<br />
to remove. We are not a satellite of any country.<br />
We are a friend and a partner of the United States<br />
particularly in the Pacific; but with independent interests of<br />
our own. As a Government, we are determined that Australia shall<br />
not be open to charges of racism.<br />
We are not just a large and empty space on the map.<br />
We are a middle power with substantial resources, with<br />
a people of considerable skill and vigor.<br />
Australia's past shortcomings, the mistakes in our international<br />
dealings have sprung in large measure from a vague and<br />
generalised fear of our own environment, the feeling of being<br />
alien in our own continent and our own region. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
As a result, we have tended to swing between isolationism<br />
and interventionism, between " fortress Australia" and over-dependence<br />
on one great powerful protector; and, culturally, between slavish<br />
imitation and brash self-assertion.<br />
What is sometimes called a new nationalism, for which the<br />
election of this Government is seen as a catalyst, is, I hope,<br />
really the beginning of self-confidence, the realisation that we<br />
are there to stay as a people whose possession of a vast rich<br />
continent has endowed us with unique opportunities, yet very great<br />
obligations. My great hope for my Government, however long it may endure<br />
or as my opponents would say be endured, is that it will see the<br />
end of the old inhibitions, the self-defeating fears about Australia's<br />
place in the world, and the beginning of a creative maturity." </p>
