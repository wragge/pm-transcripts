    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government has purchased the well-known Ferguson Collection of Australiana for the National Library in Canberra.</p>
<p>This Collection also covers the Pacific Islands and Captain Cook's voyages, and includes an original manuscript journal kept by James Burney during 1772-1773 while on Cook's secondÂ  voyage.</p>
<p>This timely acquisition will join two other Cook journals now on exhibition in the Library one a copy of Cook's own journal of the same voyage and the other a manluScript journal in Cook's own hand of the first voyage ( 1768 to 1771).</p>
<p>The other important Pacific material included-in the collection is of special value in that it relates to various aspects of history often neglected by other collectors, and will enable the National Library to support the most advanced research about Australia and the Pacific from the earliest times.</p>
<p>The Ferguson Collection should stimulate Australians to take an increased pride and interest in their own history. As the collection is internationally known, it should also attract scholars from abroad.</p>
<p>The late Sir John Ferguson assembled his collection of 34, 000 items over the last 60 years and transferred a substantial part of it as a gift. In adc'ition to achieving distinction as a member of the Bench of New South Wales, he gained an international reputation as a bibkographer and had a record of distinguished community service,</p>
