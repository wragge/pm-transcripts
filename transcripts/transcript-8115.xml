TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE, PORT MORESBY AIRPORT<br />
6 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: To start off with, can you give us what<br />
has happened in the trip?<br />
NAMALIU: The trip has been quite'successful as far as<br />
I'm concerned and, I'm sure, the people of those<br />
provinces in particular that have hosted the visit<br />
Western Highlands, Enga, Madang and East New Britain.<br />
The only thing that they've expressed is that the visit<br />
was not long enough. But however it did provide a very<br />
good opportunity for the Prime Minister and Mrs Hawke and<br />
their party to see a little bit of the country and get an<br />
appreciation of our problems, opportunities, as well as<br />
the changes and progress that we've made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Hawke, need to dispell<br />
the patronising image of the father and son<br />
relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Can<br />
you elaborate on that?<br />
PM: Yes I can. I think too often there's been an<br />
unstated assumption within Australia and perhaps to some<br />
extent here and other places that there was still some<br />
sort of colonial relationship and that it wasn't a<br />
relationship between two sovereign independent nations.<br />
The major part of my message was to emphasise the fact<br />
that Papua New Guinea is a sovereign independent nation<br />
and that we recognise and understand that and respect it.<br />
That there is a long-standing relationship of friendship<br />
between our two countries which I think will never be<br />
broken and that what Australia is about is to try and<br />
ensure that the assistance we give is increasingly<br />
channelled in a way which is going to increase the<br />
capacity of Papua New Guinea to deal with the problems<br />
and the challenges which confront it. I must say I'm<br />
very pleased that as I've moved around Papua New Guinea<br />
that there is a mutuality and understanding about these<br />
truths. Speaking for myself, this few days has been a<br />
marvellous experience. -It's the first time for twentyfive<br />
years that I've been to these other parts of Papua<br />
New Guinea. For me it was a renewal experience. I now<br />
more clearly understand the great resources and<br />
opportunities that the nation has got. I'm sure that<br />
there is an understanding of the things that have to be </p>
<p>done. As I say, Australia stands ready to do what we can<br />
to assist. I couldn't conclude those observations<br />
without expressing not only my gratitude but the<br />
gratitude of all those that have travelled with me,<br />
Rabbie, for the just indescribable warmth and extent of<br />
the reception that we've received. It's something that<br />
we'll remember forever.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your message to the people of PNG?<br />
PM: My simple message for the people of Papua New Guinea<br />
is this. To remember that you are one nation, as I've<br />
put it. The unity of this nation is important to be<br />
emphasised. Province working with province, islands with<br />
mainland, coast with highlands, highlands with the coast.<br />
You've got enormous natural resources, great resources<br />
are the people. You must remember that fifteen years ago<br />
the leaders of that time thought of this as one nation<br />
and demanded their independence. They received it. And<br />
now, this generation of Papua New Guineans has to work<br />
together as one people. If you do that with a sense of<br />
nationhood you've got the capacities to become a great<br />
country. JOURNALIST: Is there fear within yourself as to the<br />
country being broken up in terms of Bougainville, in<br />
terms of trouble fighting, in terms certain things?<br />
PM: I think we must be honest with one another and<br />
certainly your leadership, not only the Prime Minister<br />
but others to whom I've spoken, you must be honest and<br />
recognise that there are the possibilities for tension<br />
and Bougainville has demonstrated that there are some<br />
people who want to break up this nation. Now you can't<br />
do that and hope to grow and prosper because if you look<br />
over your period there have in the past been some areas<br />
that have been the more important in economic terms with<br />
their agricultural contribution. There are other areas<br />
which are developing in terms of their capacity to make a<br />
contribution through their mineral wealth. But the way<br />
for Papua New Guinea is to blend the resources of all its<br />
parts because if each part tries to go its own way that's<br />
the path of weakness. The path of strength is to blend<br />
together the various resources of people and material<br />
resources and all its parts. In that way you will become<br />
a strong nation able to fulfil the ambitions of your<br />
young people for education and employment and growth.<br />
It's only by working together in that way that you can do<br />
these things.<br />
JOURNALIST: In relation to aid to Papua New Guinea,<br />
could there be a change in the of Australia<br />
PM: Yes. That's a common position between the<br />
leadership of Papua New Guinea and ourselves that we must<br />
change the balance away from the flat budgetary aid and<br />
into project aid. That's agreed between us. We must<br />
agree on the projects areas as being the sorts of issues </p>
<p>like economic infrastructure, capacity for dealing with<br />
law and order issues, channel the assistance into those<br />
areas which is going to assist Papua New Guinea itself to<br />
deal with these problems and challenges.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is Australia's preference?<br />
PM: Our preference is those issues, those areas which we<br />
can agree together are most likely to be of assistance.<br />
I mean, quite clearly, economic infrastructure is going<br />
to be continuously important, quite clearly the<br />
development of the facility to deal with law and order<br />
issues. That's going to be important. Now without being<br />
exhaustive, those two areas are very important.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Defence Force Co-operation<br />
Agreement between Papua New Guinea and Australia has<br />
never been reviewed since it was signed in 1975. If PNG<br />
PNG has been too reliant on Australia for equipment<br />
and training, if PNG asked Australia to use that military<br />
aid to buy equipment say from Taiwan or Israel which we<br />
are getting much closer to now, would that be allowed?<br />
PM: Let's just go back. We've now in the period since<br />
independence put about half a billion dollars into the<br />
PNGDF. This is an area that Rabbie and I and Ben Sabumei<br />
in particular have been talking about as recently as on<br />
the trip back on the Hercules from Rabaul. Here again<br />
there is absolutely common ground between us and that is<br />
that what the Government and future governments of Papua<br />
New Guinea are going to want is a defence force which<br />
knows what its various functions and missions are. It<br />
would be silly to assume that the purposes, role and<br />
function and missions of the defence forces of Papua New<br />
Guinea are simply a replication of those of the<br />
Australian defence forces. They're not. So what we're<br />
going to be doing in Australia and it will be done here<br />
is to review our thinking of what those roles are, from<br />
our point of view not to tell Papua New Guinea what they<br />
are but to get our thinking developed. Rabbie and his<br />
people will be doing that. And then we will later on<br />
this year in the light of our own thinking and the<br />
thinking of our friends here, having tried to get some<br />
common ground about roles and missions and functions,<br />
then work out what's the best way in terms of Australian<br />
assistance that we can meet the perception of roles into<br />
the future. Now we are this is not Australia imposing<br />
its thinking. We have discussed this through and we are<br />
thinking exactly the same way. Now coming against that<br />
background to the specifics of your question, let me make<br />
this point first of all. We understand that Papua New<br />
Guinea is looking not only to Australia in the<br />
development of it's thinking about the PNGDF. We don't<br />
resist that. We don't find that objectionable in any<br />
way. We welcome it. It makes sense that you shouldn't<br />
look just to Australia. The next point about equipment.<br />
In the end Papua New Guinea has to make its own<br />
decisions. It goes back to the foundational point I </p>
<p>made, that is that Papua New Guinea is an independent<br />
sovereign nation. It will make its decisions about<br />
sourcing of equipment and so on. It would be very likely<br />
that given the nature of the relationship between us that<br />
those decisions would take into account to a considerable<br />
extent what's most likely to be able to assist the<br />
process of co-operation between us. That doesn't mean<br />
that everything that is going to be purchased by Papua<br />
New Guinea is either sourced from Australia or the<br />
sources from which we<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you explain $ 20 million help..<br />
defence force, in the context of what you have said.<br />
PM: The most recent decisions you mean?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: What we were approached about was not just what had<br />
arisen out of Bougainville. I mean what you should<br />
understand, it was not just a reaction to that. But the<br />
thinking of the Government of Papua New Guinea was that<br />
they needed to increase their forces. So we agreed with<br />
them. In particular therefore the assistance we've been<br />
looking at now is in terms of helping with the training<br />
and equipment of that adidtional is it 450 about 450<br />
new recruits that it covers. That's where the major part<br />
of that additional assistance is going.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on that point about the Australian<br />
expertise and its applicability to the PNGDF, it seems<br />
that one of the problems confronting PNG is internal<br />
security matters as opposed to external.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: The ADF is an organisation built for<br />
external threats. Where does Australia get the expertise<br />
to help PNG address internal security problems?<br />
PM: It doesn't I mean if you've got Let me answer<br />
that question by saying this. When we use the phrase<br />
internal security it's a shorthand term. Internal<br />
security just doesn't cover one thing. Without being<br />
exhaustive, if you think about internal security you will<br />
think about issues like Bougainville for instance. You<br />
will think about things like for instance mine security,<br />
for example. In regard to issues like that it's quite<br />
clear from the experience and training that the<br />
Australian defence forces have that they can provide<br />
advice and training for things like that. It won't be<br />
the case, and conceptually it's not the case that just<br />
because the Australian defence forces have an external<br />
orientation that the sort of training that they have for<br />
that is not going to equip them to be of assistance to<br />
the defence forces of Papua New Guinea. But the<br />
important thing that we've agreed is that we should both<br />
sit down separately for a start and review where we'vye </p>
<p>been, the sorts of things we've done to try and get a<br />
common thinking about the future role of the PNGDF and<br />
then see from our experience what's the best way that we<br />
can help. There are issues, as Rabbie has said himself,<br />
issues of leadership and basic planning skills. Those<br />
sorts of considerations are relevant to any aspect of<br />
internal security. Obviously we can help in those sorts<br />
of things. Rabbie, would you like to add anything to<br />
that question?<br />
NAMALIU: I think that Bob has pretty well covered most<br />
of the areas that would be defined under that term. The<br />
role of the defence force in this country is changing,<br />
has changed. That's why we have decided that we should<br />
look at reviewing the roles of the defence force both in<br />
terms of the experience that we've had and their own<br />
particular experience in terms of situations like<br />
Bougainville. But also in terms generally of their roles<br />
* in national development. It is in that context that we<br />
believe that we have and will have requirements for<br />
assistance in those specific areas like in terms of<br />
training, in terms of support for various levels of<br />
leadership within the defence force as well as, I<br />
suppose, the development of approaches as to how new<br />
roles should be approached as far as the future is<br />
concerned of the defence force in this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: What part will Australia play in that role?<br />
PM: Sorry?<br />
JOURNALIST: Will it be significant or will it be<br />
I'm asking because specific...?<br />
NAMALIU: As we have indicated, those are the things that<br />
we will be having further discussions on. As the Prime<br />
Minister has indicated, they will on their part be<br />
* reviewing their own position. Similarly on our part we<br />
will be doing a similar review of our own position before<br />
we can get together again and come to discussing specific<br />
issues. PM: To be specific, I've got my Minister for Defence<br />
reviewing the Defence Co-operation program and our part<br />
in that. That review will then come to Cabinet. We will<br />
consider it. So that I and the Minister for Defence<br />
that we'll be then well placed to have thought about<br />
where we've been, what we're doing and our concepts of<br />
what the future role of the PNGDF may be in this country<br />
and what's the best way we can help. As I said, Papua<br />
New Guinea, at the same time as we're doing our thinking<br />
in the weeks ahead, they will be doing it. So that will<br />
mean when we start, say at the end of October or in<br />
November, addressing these issues we'll be in a position<br />
to come to agreements about the roles and functions<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it possible that police training could<br />
come under the Defence Co-operation program? </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: We've discussed that and I'd just like to say these<br />
things and I'm sure Rabbie would like'to make his<br />
comments. I think it's right to say that we agree that<br />
as far as you can see into the future there will be two<br />
separate PNGDF and there will be the police. But I<br />
think we both agree that there will be a complementarity<br />
of their roles in many respects and that it may be that<br />
you can get a degree of integration in regard to<br />
procurement issues perhaps and some elements of training.<br />
So in our thinking about the PNGDF we'd be thinking about<br />
that side as well.<br />
JOURNALIST: on Bougainville, what is the<br />
Government's stand now that the suspended provincial<br />
government that's refused to recognise the administrator<br />
that you appointed.<br />
0 NcAoMnAsLtIiUt: u tioTnh e unaddemri nithset rator laisw oafp pporionvtiendc iuanld egro voeurrnment.<br />
As far as we are concerned, he is the administrator of<br />
the province.<br />
JOURNALIST: control of the situation again. Is that<br />
true?<br />
NAMALIU: I think it is more likely to that description<br />
is more apt for the BRA leadership than it is for the<br />
position JOURNALIST: You are not dealing with the BRA.<br />
NAMALIU: That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you dealing with them?<br />
NAMALIU: The BRA?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
NAMALIU: Well as you know, there are leaders who have<br />
been involved in the negotiations which resulted in the<br />
Accord that belong to the BRA. There are those that<br />
belong to the self-styled government of the republic<br />
of the North Solomons. There are those that come from<br />
the community generally. So they are the leaders that we<br />
were dealing with. They were Bougainville leaders and we<br />
would like to regard them as that rather than belonging<br />
to a specific group like the BRA.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who are they<br />
NAMALIU: You know who they are. You know Mr Kabui, you<br />
know Bishop Singkai, you know Mr Peter sorry, not<br />
Peter, but you know the other people involved. It<br />
includes people who are very close to Mr Ona. But Mr<br />
Kabui is there, Bishop Singkai is there, Bishop Zali is<br />
I </p>
<p>there. These are all very very prominent leaders within<br />
the province.<br />
JOURNALIST: The next round of talks is not far away.<br />
NAMALIU: That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there pressure?<br />
NAMALIU: As far as we're concerned the talks are still<br />
on. There's nothing to suggest at this time that the<br />
talks will not continue despite, you know, the statement<br />
that we all read about yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it's realistic Prime Minister<br />
to talk about a complete phasing out of Australian<br />
budgetary aid by the year 2000?<br />
NAMALIU: I think it can be achieved. It's achievable<br />
provided of course that we continue to have discussions<br />
on these matters. We have a fairly clear<br />
perception and that's what we agreed on, on the principle<br />
itself. We believe that we can achieve that by that<br />
year. ends<br />
