    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Richard, to David Johnston, the President of</p>
<p> the Western Australian Division of the Liberal Party, to Colin Barnett,</p>
<p> to my federal Cabinet and Ministerial colleagues and all of my federal</p>
<p> colleagues, other Parliamentary colleagues, and fellow Liberals.</p>
<p>I'm delighted to be back again to address the State Conference</p>
<p> of the Western Australian Division of the Liberal Party. And I start</p>
<p> my address by expressing my thanks to all you for the great support</p>
<p> and loyalty that you've demonstrated towards the Government since</p>
<p> it was elected in March of 1996. I particularly thank the organisation</p>
<p> through you, David, and your State Director, Peter Wells, for the</p>
<p> professional way in which you have worked to keep the wheels of the</p>
<p> Party organisation turning over and the message being sent out to</p>
<p> our grassroots supporters.</p>
<p>And I want to commence my address to you today, which takes place</p>
<p> at a very important time in the life and the history of our federal</p>
<p> government, by remarking in a few words upon the challenge that lies</p>
<p> ahead of us. And if there is one message that I have for you, as members</p>
<p> of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, and indeed a message I</p>
<p> have for Liberals all over Australia, is that it is long past time</p>
<p> the members of the Liberal Party stopped being defensive. It is long</p>
<p> past time that the members of the Liberal Party came out fighting</p>
<p> on every conceivable front.</p>
<p>I want Liberals all over Australia to come out fighting about what</p>
<p> our Government has achieved over the last two and a quarter years.</p>
<p> I want every Liberal to remind every friend of theirs of what we inherited</p>
<p> from Mr Beazley and Mr Keating. And how, in a little over two years,</p>
<p> we have turned an annual deficit of $10.5 billion into a surplus of</p>
<p> $2.7 billion, of how we have given Australian home buyers the lowest</p>
<p> interest rates in 30 years. We have slashed the monthly mortgage bill</p>
<p> of the average mortgage repayer by $300 a month. And we have started</p>
<p> to do the same thing for small business.</p>
<p>I want you to tell your fellow Australians that we now have the lowest</p>
<p> inflation rate in the industrialised world, that we have a projected</p>
<p> growth rate which will be superior to that of any of the G7 nations.</p>
<p> I want you to tell your friends that if we hadn't taken the action</p>
<p> that we took, when we came to office, the Australian economy would</p>
<p> have been gravely weakened and undermined by the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p> We can't escape the impact of that downturn but we have through</p>
<p> the prudent and strong policies that we have adopted we have been</p>
<p> able to minimise that impact.</p>
<p>I want you to come out fighting and tell your friends that if we had</p>
<p> listened to Mr Beazley, we would in fact be more weakened and enfeebled</p>
<p> now than we were in March of 1996. Because not only did Labor leave</p>
<p> us with a deficit running at an annual rate of $10.5 billion, an accumulated</p>
<p> federal government debt of $95 billion, but they tried in opposition</p>
<p> to move heaven and earth to stop us taking the measures that were</p>
<p> required to be taken in order to repair the shattered budget position</p>
<p> that we inherited over two years ago. Not only did they create the</p>
<p> problem, but they spent all their waking hours trying to stop us curing</p>
<p> the problem. I want you to come out fighting and to tell your friends</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>I also, particularly want you here in Western Australia, to tell your</p>
<p> friends the story about Native Title. To remind them that it was Mr</p>
<p> Keating who was Prime Minister, with an act of gross insensitivity</p>
<p> to the interests of the great export industries of Western Australia</p>
<p> which are so important to the national economic wealth of our entire</p>
<p> nation, that it was Mr Keating that dumped the unworkable Native</p>
<p> Title Act upon Australians in 1993. And for five long</p>
<p> years we have tried with the help of your Premier, Richard Court,</p>
<p> to remedy that appalling situation. It was the Labor Party once again</p>
<p> who left us with a mess, and it was the Labor Party once again hand</p>
<p> in glove with their friends in the Senate, the Australian Democrats</p>
<p> and the Australian Greens who fought tooth and nail to stop us fixing</p>
<p> the problem.</p>
<p>And it looked at one stage as though the only way the problem would</p>
<p> be fixed was through a double dissolution. But fortunately I was able</p>
<p> to negotiate a settlement with Senator Harradine, a settlement that</p>
<p> delivered in full on all of the essential things that we wanted. And</p>
<p> I want particularly to thank your Premier, Richard Court, for the</p>
<p> very constructive way in which we were able to work together in the</p>
<p> closing stages of those negotiations. I also pay tribute to that marvellous</p>
<p> satellite phone that Richard operated in the middle of the Great Victoria</p>
<p> Desert. It failed I think on one or two occasions, but for most of</p>
<p> the time it worked very effectively. And the two of us were able to</p>
<p> work together, as we should always, on matters of joint importance</p>
<p> to Western Australia and the entire nation.</p>
<p>And we have been able together to deliver an outcome on Native Title</p>
<p> that will give to the mining industry of Australia, to the farmers</p>
<p> of Australia and to the indigenous people of Australia a fair and</p>
<p> balanced outcome. It will give all of them predicability, it will</p>
<p> give all of them fairness, and it will give all of them security.</p>
<p> And it was a Liberal Government working with a Liberal Government</p>
<p> in Western Australia that was able to achieve that outcome. And we</p>
<p> achieved that outcome in the face of what I can only call the most</p>
<p> despicable hostility from sections of the Australian media, from the</p>
<p> Australian Labor Party and our other political opponents.</p>
<p>And the crowning hypocrisy of Mr Beazley was, that not only did he</p>
<p> let down the interests of his native state, Western Australia, in</p>
<p> the stance that he took on the issue, not only did he sell out the</p>
<p> interests of Western Australians in a quite spineless way, but he</p>
<p> allowed his spokesman in the Senate to describe our Bill day after</p>
<p> day as racist, to describe our Bill day after day as racist. And yet</p>
<p> a day after it was passed, what did Mr Beazley say about the possibility</p>
<p> of a future Labor Government, however remote that might be, repealing</p>
<p> the Bill? Mr Beazley said, "Oh no we have to move on". So</p>
<p> after five years, after having given us the mess in the first place,</p>
<p> having fought tooth and nail from opposition to stop us fixing it,</p>
<p> having allowed his spokesman to describe us a racist for what we were</p>
<p> going to do, when finally he was beaten, when finally reason prevailed,</p>
<p> through our negotiating persistence and the cooperation of Senator</p>
<p> Harradine, when finally after all of that what was Mr Beazley's</p>
<p> pathetic response? His pathetic response was that we had to move on.</p>
<p> I can't think of a more spineless performance from a weak leader</p>
<p> in many, many years in Australian politics.</p>
<p>I think here in Western Australia, Liberals have got to come out fighting</p>
<p> and tell the people of Western Australia what has been done on the</p>
<p> score of Native Title.</p>
<p>And I think we also have to come out fighting to tell the people of</p>
<p> Australia, all over Australia, about our plans for the future. Because</p>
<p> when you compare us with the alternative, when you look at our record</p>
<p> of national economic management, when you look at what we have achieved</p>
<p> in the area of industrial relations reform, when you look at the way</p>
<p> in which we have sensibly diversified Australia's international</p>
<p> relations towards what I describe as an Asia first focus, rather than</p>
<p> an Asia only focus followed by the previous government, the comparison</p>
<p> works very much to our favour.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken for a few moments about what has</p>
<p> been achieved over the last two and a quarter years. I want now to</p>
<p> say a few words abour what lies in front of us. The most important</p>
<p> event on the Australian political calender over the next few weeks</p>
<p> and months will, of course, be the release of the Government's</p>
<p> plans to reform and make fairer and better the Australian taxation</p>
<p> system. All of you know that Australia's taxation system is badly</p>
<p> in need of reform and repair. I know it's difficult. And I know</p>
<p> there are many in Australia, there are many in the Liberal Party who</p>
<p> will say, don't attempt it, it's too difficult. There are</p>
<p> many who will say, get back into office and have a meeting and do</p>
<p> it somehow or other through that kind of device. But, my friends,</p>
<p> you simply can't do that. If you really wanted to hand to the</p>
<p> Leader of the Opposition the mother of all scare campaigns, you would</p>
<p> make some vague statement about taxation reform when you got back.</p>
<p> You would lay down a few principles. And he'd run all over Australia</p>
<p> saying we are going to introduce a 30 per cent goods and services</p>
<p> tax without any kind of income tax compensation. He would exaggerate,</p>
<p> he would say we were going to cut payments to the states. He would</p>
<p> invent all sort of horrendous descriptions of what we might do. And</p>
<p> we would be absolutely powerless to refute that kind of campaign.</p>
<p>I have no intention of going to the next election and denying the</p>
<p> need to reform Australia's taxation system. Because I know in</p>
<p> my heart that it needs reform. And I know in my heart that it's</p>
<p> my responsibility as Prime Minister to argue and explain the case</p>
<p> for reform to the Australian people and to invite the Australian people</p>
<p> to make a judgement. We have committed ourselves to reform, because</p>
<p> we think that reform is good for Australia, for no other reason. I</p>
<p> haven't done it because of some kind of ideological zeal, some</p>
<p> kind of political ego trip or some kind of craving for a place in</p>
<p> Australian political history. I have committed myself, and my colleagues</p>
<p> have committed themselves to taxation reform because we believe that</p>
<p> it is good for Australia. We don't believe that Australia can</p>
<p> go on any more with a taxation system that penalise exports. We don't</p>
<p> believe that Australia can go on any more with a taxation system that</p>
<p> is going to push average wage and salary earners into a situation</p>
<p> where they are paying a slice of their income at the top marginal</p>
<p> rate. And can I particularly say here in Western Australia, I don't</p>
<p> believe that we can go on any more with a taxation system where the</p>
<p> relations between the Commonwealth and the States are so profoundly</p>
<p> out of balance and so screamingly in need of reform and change.</p>
<p>I can assure you, my friends, that when the policy comes out, it will</p>
<p> be comprehensive. It will be the necessary next step to further strengthen</p>
<p> and buttress the Australian economy against an increasingly difficult</p>
<p> and competitive world trading environment. It will be family friendly.</p>
<p> I have committed much of the resources of my Government to ensure</p>
<p> that families in Australia get a better deal and they will not be</p>
<p> overlooked in the taxation policy when it is released.</p>
<p>It will address issues of Commonwealth/State financial relations.</p>
<p> I do understand the need for reform in that area. And that is why</p>
<p> one of the principles that I said would govern reform was to address</p>
<p> Commonwealth/State financial relations.</p>
<p>And, my friends, it will not result in any increase in the overall</p>
<p> taxation burden. That was one of the other principles that was laid</p>
<p> down. But it will represent the most serious reform to the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system undertaken by any government since the end of World</p>
<p> War II. And it will help to catapult Australia, economically, into</p>
<p> the 21st Century. The last great piece of unfinished economic</p>
<p> business in Australia is repairing and reforming our taxation system.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government tackled the disastrous fiscal inheritance</p>
<p> of Labor. The Coalition Government has addressed industrial relations</p>
<p> reform. The Coalition Government has undertaken a courageous programme</p>
<p> of privatisation. The Coalition Government has continued the process</p>
<p> of reforming the Australian financial system through the Wallis Inquiry.</p>
<p> And it is now left to the Coalition to address, in a courageous and</p>
<p> far-sighted way, repairing Australia's taxation system. Unlike</p>
<p> our opponents we are prepared to do it. Unlike our opponents we are</p>
<p> not going back to the past, we are leading forward into Australia's</p>
<p> future.</p>
<p>Can I say just one other thing and that is that it's very important</p>
<p> at this particular time in Australia's political experience that</p>
<p> parties maintain their commitment to what they believe in. And that</p>
<p> parties are not spooked into abandoning their commitment to those</p>
<p> reforms that they know are necessary for Australia's future.</p>
<p> And I can't think of a reform in the economic area which is more</p>
<p> important to Australia's future than to take the existing system</p>
<p> and to change it in a profoundly positive and beneficial way.</p>
<p>Mr President, I would now like to address one or two remarks to the</p>
<p> position of the One Nation Party in the Australian political firmament.</p>
<p> I want to say that I encounter Liberals and I encounter other Australians</p>
<p> asking the question - what are we going to do about One Nation? And</p>
<p> there are many answers that come forth to that question. But let me</p>
<p> give you, in simple terms, my answer to that question. I believe that</p>
<p> what the Liberal Party does in relation to One Nation is the same</p>
<p> as what it does in relation to the Labor Party or any of our other</p>
<p> political opponents, and that is that the Liberal Party offers Australians</p>
<p> something better.</p>
<p>Can I say to you, my friends, that there is no one slick, one-line</p>
<p> put down of One Nation. There is no one speech that can demolish a</p>
<p> political party. The only thing that will drag support back from One</p>
<p> Nation is for the Liberal Party to offer the people of Australia something</p>
<p> better. And part of our job, part of our responsibility, is to remind</p>
<p> those in the community who may have been attracted, however unwisely,</p>
<p> to support One Nation, not only what we have already done to address</p>
<p> some of their concerns but also what we will do in the future.</p>
<p>I mean, you might remind some of those people that it was the Liberal</p>
<p> Party that for five years stood for the principle, in relation to</p>
<p> Native Title, that all Australians should be treated equally. I keep</p>
<p> hearing from One Nation that one of their catch-cries is that all</p>
<p> Australians are equal. Well, I agree with that. All Australians are</p>
<p> equal. But we've been practicing that principle for the last</p>
<p> five years in relation to Native Title. Why do you think we stood</p>
<p> out in favour of getting rid of the right to negotiate? Why was the</p>
<p> right to negotiate in Native Title the sticking point between us and</p>
<p> the Labor Party? It was the sticking point because I was not prepared</p>
<p> to accept the situation where one section of the Australian community</p>
<p> had an advantage and had a process that was not available to other</p>
<p> Australians. Now, I can't think of a better practical example</p>
<p> of a political party, the Liberal Party, standing up for the principle</p>
<p> that all Australians should be treated equally.</p>
<p>You might also remind those people who are attracted to One Nation</p>
<p> that it was the Coalition Government that introduced work-for-the-dole.</p>
<p> It was the Coalition Government that enunciated the principle of mutual</p>
<p> obligation. That we, as a decent, compassionate society, have an obligation</p>
<p> to look after those in the community who can't look after themselves</p>
<p> and who can't get a job. But they have an obligation, if they're</p>
<p> able to do so, to give something in return to the community through</p>
<p> working for the dole. It a Coalition Government that pioneered that.</p>
<p> It was a Coalition Government that promoted that.</p>
<p>You might also remind them it was a Coalition Government that brought</p>
<p> balance and commonsense to Australia's immigration programme.</p>
<p> That it was a Coalition Government that put a greater emphasis on</p>
<p> skills and less emphasis on family reunion. That it was a Coalition</p>
<p> Government that has ended the rorting of the immigration system. It's</p>
<p> a Coalition Government that has turned back the tide of ten years</p>
<p> of political correctness under the former government. And it was a</p>
<p> Coalition Government that introduced the two-year waiting period for</p>
<p> new migrants before they could receive welfare benefits.</p>
<p>Now, these are some of the concerns, some of these issues are the</p>
<p> basis of concern of One Nation supporters. And we might remind them</p>
<p> of what we have done. We haven't talked about those things, we've</p>
<p> actually done something about them. And we've offered Australians</p>
<p> something better. But we offer Australians something better in our</p>
<p> willingness to see the good in people and to see the positives in</p>
<p> people. We offer Australians something better by not criticising what</p>
<p> is wrong but offering a better way. We don't lament the state</p>
<p> of Australia's taxation system and then do nothing about it.</p>
<p> We don't lament the state of Australia's industrial relations</p>
<p> system and then do nothing about it. We don't go into the rural</p>
<p> areas of Australia, many of which are impoverished and depressed,</p>
<p> and say to people who have lost their incomes and their livelihoods</p>
<p> that the answer to Australia's problems, it's rural problems,</p>
<p> is to put up the barriers of protection and to lock imports out of</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>I can't think of a policy that would be more calculated to drive</p>
<p> rural Australia into even deeper despair and deeper poverty than to</p>
<p> go back to days of high protection. Australia is a great rural exporting</p>
<p> nation. And it would be the death of rural Australia if we behaved</p>
<p> in a way that invited international trade retaliation against Australia's</p>
<p> farm exports. If we were so foolish as to try and not farm exports</p>
<p> out of Australia, as our One Nation opponents want us to do, we would</p>
<p> invite massive retaliation. You go to Queensland and argue to a sugar</p>
<p> grower or a beef producer that we ought to bring in massive import</p>
<p> controls on other products and he or she will shout, no, a thousand</p>
<p> times, no. Because if you do that the Canadians and the Koreans and</p>
<p> others will lock out our sugar and our beef exports.</p>
<p>We have a massive export balance in our favour in relation to farm-based</p>
<p> products. And if we are so short-sighted, so stupid, so unwise as</p>
<p> to imagine that salvation lies in locking out imports, then we are,</p>
<p> indeed, a very naive nation. As a farming nation, as an exporting</p>
<p> nation, more than most we have a long-term national interest in trade</p>
<p> liberalisation. Yet, our opponents in One Nation would argue the narrow,</p>
<p> destructive, anti-Australian approach of locking out imports in the</p>
<p> naive belief that we could go on exporting to our heart's contents.</p>
<p>So we offer a better way forward, something better for Australians,</p>
<p> in that department. And I think the other thing that we offer which</p>
<p> is better, and it's something we offer which is better compared</p>
<p> with all of our political opponents, and that is we offer a fundamentally</p>
<p> optimistic and positive view about what both Australia and Australians</p>
<p> have achieved and what Australia and Australians can achieve into</p>
<p> the future.</p>
<p>We are not apologists for Australia's past. I recognise, like</p>
<p> every other Australian, that there are blemishes in our history. And</p>
<p> there were occasions on which the indigenous community of Australia</p>
<p> were treated in an appalling manner. But the balance sheet of Australian</p>
<p> history is a balance sheet of heroic achievement against tremendous</p>
<p> adversity. It is a balance sheet of a very, very benign, a very, very</p>
<p> positive and a very, very tolerant people.</p>
<p>We have welcomed to our shores millions of people from around the</p>
<p> world and they have enriched and made better our nation. And I say</p>
<p> to all of those people: this country is as much your home as it is</p>
<p> mine. And I say to those people: this Australia is as much your land</p>
<p> as it is mine and tolerance and compassion and understanding have</p>
<p> always been Liberal hallmarks.</p>
<p>And the way forward for this country does not lie in narrow scape-goating.</p>
<p> It does not lie in demarcating Australians according to their ethnic</p>
<p> or racial background. It lies in focussing on those things that unite</p>
<p> us as Australians and not those things that divide us. And we can</p>
<p> offer to all Australians something better than all of our political</p>
<p> opponents. And it's a responsibility not only of me, not only</p>
<p> of Tim Fischer and of the Cabinet and of the Parliamentary party,</p>
<p> but it's the responsibility for all of you, at this very important</p>
<p> time in the experience and the life of the Government and in the political</p>
<p> history of Australia, it's your responsibility to come out with</p>
<p> me fighting to tell the Australian people what we have done, what</p>
<p> we have achieved, what we plan to do in the future and how the Liberal</p>
<p> Party, governing in coalition with the National Party, can beat all</p>
<p> of our political opponents by offering Australians something better.</p>
