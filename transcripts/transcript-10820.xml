    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the government will recommend to Her Majesty The Queen that a special commemorative medal be struck for all surviving Australian World War I veterans who will commemorate today the 80th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Great War.</p>
<p>The commemorative medal, to be known as the <i>80<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal</i>, will be presented in time to be worn at Anzac Day 1999.</p>
<p>These 66 surviving veterans are a living reminder to all Australians three generations on of a conflict which gave birth to the Anzac tradition and marked Australia's nationhood on the world stage.</p>
<p>I have written to each veteran conveying the nation's pride in their achievements.</p>
<p>They now represent the many young Australians who volunteered to leave their homeland to serve at Gallipoli, in the Middle East and on the western front.</p>
<p>The deeds of that generation of young Australians, more than 60,000 of whom lost their lives, have become a legend and continue to inspire us all.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation, I thank them and express our pleasure in honouring them with this symbol of our recognition.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
<p>11 November 1998</p>
