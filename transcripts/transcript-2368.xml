FOR PRESS PM. No. 20/ 1971<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS<br />
Comment bythe Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
It will be some days before the picture in New South<br />
Wales is entirely clear, but there is every indication that the<br />
Liberal/ Country Party Government has been returned for a third<br />
term of office, The Liberal/ Country Party administration has provided<br />
six years of stable and progressive government and my congratulations<br />
to Mr Askin on what would appear to be his new mandate.<br />
I look forward to continuing to work closely with Mr<br />
Askin in the best interests of New South Wales and of Australia.<br />
CANBERRA, 14 February 1971 </p>
