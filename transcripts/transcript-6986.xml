ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW<br />
PCST-BUDGET DINNER !] E1ROUJNC 70 AUGUST 1986<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
THE AFR DodNER HAS NOW BECOME A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT OF THE<br />
ANNUA. PojIr-BUDGET ROUND. IT HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART<br />
OF THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATING THE ESSENTIALS OF THE BUDGET<br />
TO THE VJIEST POSSIBLE AUDIENCEI<br />
HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS THAT Tit[: AUi IN MAKING tHJS<br />
SPEECH ' S TO FINP A PRESENfAr ION WlilCll WILL BRING EACH Oil<br />
THE SEPARlATE ; NGREDIENTS OF THE BUDGET STRATEGY TOGETHER IN<br />
A WAY U' 42N: H IS BOTH ELEGANT AND DIGESTIBLE, ESPECIALLY AFTER<br />
SO PLEASA'lT A MEAL AS THE O~ R TRAIIIONALLv ARRANGESPERHAPF,<br />
ET WAS THE THOUGHr OF THAT MFAL OR PERHAPS IT<br />
WAS THE THOUGHT OF MY LOOSE PRITIKIN nIIfr BUT FOR<br />
WHATEVE. REASON I HAVE CHOSEN TO INTRODUCLE MY ADDRESS THIS<br />
YEAR WIITl SOME EXTRACTS FROM NORMAN LINDSAY'S " THE MAGIC<br />
PUDNG<br />
SOME C7 YOU WHO HAVE CHILDREN OR GRAND) CHILDFW; N YOUNG FNOUGH<br />
TO DE RZAD TO MAY WELL HAVE ENCOUNIt AVD THIS PASSAGE<br />
RECENTLY FOR WHICH IAPOLOGISE.<br />
BUT FOR MOST OF US, THINK, TIr WILL. RE A HEftESHFR COURSELET<br />
ME SAY AT ONCE THAT ANALOGIES ARE INVARIABLY IMPERFECTAND<br />
THIS ONE IS NO FXCEPTION. 110T If: YOU WILL BEAR WITH ME<br />
I THINK THAT ONE OR TWO USEFUL POINtS (, AN BE MADE WITHOUT<br />
GREAT DISTORTION-</p>
<p>2.<br />
LET E BEGIN BY REMINDING YOU THAT THE PUDDING IS CALLED<br />
ALBERT ( BECAUSE, WE ARE TOLD, OIT SOOTHES HIM"). HE WAS<br />
PRONE TO BE TESTY-THE QUOTE BEGINS:<br />
A PECULIAR THING ABOUT THE PUDDIN' WAS THAT,<br />
THOUGH THEY HAD ALL HAD A GREAT MANY SLICES OF HIM,<br />
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE PLACE WHENCE THE SLICES HAD<br />
SEEN CUT. o<br />
DTHAT'S WHERE THE MAGIC COMES IN', EXPLAINED BILL.<br />
' TUt mORE YOU EAT THE MORE YOU GETS. CUT-AN'-COME-AGAIN<br />
IS AIS NAME, AN' CUT, AN0 COME AGAIN IS HIS NATURE<br />
IN HANYV WAVS I THINK THAT AUSTRALIANS HAVE REGARDED THE<br />
ECONONY AS A BIT LIKE THE " PUDDING".<br />
FOR YCARS WZ HAVE BEEN EATING AWAY LITERALLY WITH<br />
SEEIC. GLV LITTLE EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY. LIKE MAGIC, OUR<br />
INCOMe 91AS KEPT ON GROWING, THOUGH OF COURSE THE RATE OF<br />
I GROWT! h-HAS DEPENDED ON ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. AND ON THAT<br />
COUNT Å T GIVES ME SOME PREDE THAT OVER THE THREE YEARS OF'<br />
iOUR STZWARDSHIP GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY OVERALL HAS AVERAGED<br />
TWICE " H ANNUAL RATE THAT COULD BE MUSTERED DURING THE 7<br />
YEARS OF OUR PREDECESSORSBUT<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS RECEIVED A RUDE SHOCK. THE MAGIC HAS<br />
GONE. TME WORLD HAS LET US DOWN SHARPLY. TO EXPAND OUR<br />
REAL WEALTH NOW AT THE RATES THAT WE WOULD LIKE WE WILL NEED<br />
TO HEET THE NEW REALITIES OF WORLD TRADE, MOVE INTO NEW<br />
AREAS OF ACTIVITY AND WORK HARDER IN OUR TRADITIONAL<br />
ACTIVITIES. THIS BUDGEr IS ABOUT RESTORING THE CONDITIONS THAT WILL<br />
ALLOW THE " PUDDING" TO GROW RAPIDLY AGAIN NOT BY MAGIC, OR<br />
INITIALLY AS THE GIFr OF BENEVOLENT WORLD MARKETS, BUT<br />
BECAUSE OF OUR OWN HARD WORK.<br />
IT IS, IN EVERY SENSE, A BUDGEI OF HOPE, A BUDGET FOR THE<br />
FUTURE, A BUDGET FOR FUTURE DEVOTEES OF LINDSAY'S PUDDING. </p>
<p>IT IS A BUDGE~ T WHICH HAS MET OR EXCEkVEI) EVERY REASONABLLE<br />
EXPECTATION SET FOR IT FAIR BUI I; IRM CONTROL OVER<br />
EXPENDITURE; AND A SUBSTANTIAL cur IN THE DEFICIT-IT IS<br />
THE BUDGET tlHICH THE OPPOSITION COULD NEVER DELIVERONE<br />
GOOD LUDGET WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY RESULTS ON<br />
ITS OWN-OTHER POLICIES MONETARY POLICY, WAGES POLICY,<br />
INDUSTRY POLICY, ARE ALSO IMPORTANT-So, TOO, IS<br />
SUSTAINED F2SCAL RESPONSIBILITY. EACH OF THESE WILL BE<br />
DEL I VE ( lE 0<br />
AND MAKE flD MISTAKE, VIE WILL SUCCEED. VIE WILL SUCCEED' NOT<br />
ONLV BECAUSE WE ARE A RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO<br />
STAY TH-E COURSE AND TO TAKE THES RIGHT DECISIONS REGARDLESS<br />
OF POLITECiAL RISKS-WE WILL SUCCEED ALSO BECAUSE THIS LABOR<br />
GOVERNMEN2T HAS HAD AUSTRALIA TRAI. NING ON THAT COURSE FOR<br />
OVER 3 Y_-AS NOW.<br />
To SET THE SCENE, LET NE UU~ BACK IN TIME A LITTLE, TO THE<br />
APPARENTL7 1lIAGIC PUDDING" ERA. THE TREND HAS BEEN OVER THE<br />
PAST 20 YEARS FOR AUSTRALIA TO DEVOTE AN INCREASING SHARE OF<br />
GDP TO CCASUMPTION. DOMESTIC SAVING HAS FALLEN FROM AN<br />
AVERAGE OF 17.5 PER CENT OF GDP PCR YEAR IN THE 10 YEARS<br />
ENDED 1973-74 TO JUST 11. L4 PER CENT LAST YEAR. Tmie<br />
DIFFEREN'CE WAS TAKEN UP IN A LARGER SHARE OF GDP BEING<br />
DEVOTED -70 CONSUMPTION I. E. ' TO SUPPORTING HIGHER CURRENT<br />
LIVING STANDARDS.<br />
THE XNVESTMENT SHARE FELL A LITTLE BETWEE-N THESE PERIODS<br />
BV ABOUT 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE REMAINING GAP BETWEEN<br />
DOMESTEC SAVING AND OUR TOTAL FINANCING REQUIREMENT WAS MET<br />
BY BORaCUING AN INCREASING SHARE FROM ABROADIN<br />
1985-36 AUSTRALIA SPENT ABOUT 6 PER CE~ NT MOnE THAN IT<br />
EARNED. THE DIFFERENCE WAS BORROWED OVERSFAS. THIS CAME AT<br />
A TiME WHEN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN DEBT<br />
HAD ALREADY BEEN DOUBLED OVER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. IN<br />
PART U. ECAUSE OF THE SHARP DEPRECIATION OF EARLY 1985. </p>
<p>WE SIMPLV CANNOT GO ON ADDING TO OUR DEBT AS FAST AS WE HAVE<br />
BEEN-UE NEED TO PEG BACK THE GROWTH OF SPENDING,<br />
TEMPORARILY. AND OVER TIME RAISE OUR EARNINGSON~<br />
LY THEN WIL L THE " PUDDING" RESUME GlROWING AT THE " MAGICAL"<br />
RATES WHIICH WE REQUIRE TO FURTHER WIND BACK THE HUGE LEGACY<br />
OF UNEMPLOYMENT LEFT To LABOR BY OUR PREDECESSORS.<br />
THE GREAT IRONY IS THAT LABOR'S POLICIES ARE CLEARLY WORKING<br />
TO CREATE J. UST THE CONDITIONS REQUIR( ED.<br />
THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS HAVE FALLEN 7<br />
PER CENT IN JUST 3 YEARS. UITH THE DOLLAR ALSO LOWER OUR<br />
INTERNAI'iONAL COMPETITIVENESS IS THE BEST IN 20 YEARSPROFXTS<br />
ARE UP, STRIKES ARE DOWN. STARTING FROM 7HE<br />
INFAMOUS $ 9.6 BIJLLION LEGACY OF MR HOWARD, WE PROGRESSIVELY<br />
REDUCED THE DEFICIT IN OUR FIRST THREE RUDETSOUR<br />
RECOR~ D OF DOMESTIC ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT 15 WELL<br />
APPRECIATED. L. ESS WELL UNJDERSTOOD IS OUR PERFORMANCE IN.<br />
WORLD T " DE.<br />
EXPORT VOLUMES ARE SHARPLY UP By 7.4~ PER CENT IN 1985-86.<br />
HOPEOVEP OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS THE VOLUME OF IMPORTS tEAS<br />
DROPPED DRAMATICALLY -AT A RATE OF 10 PER CENT PER ANNUM.<br />
BUT PROGRESS TO DATE IN CUTTING OUR CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT<br />
HAS SEEN SWAMPED BY THE SHARP FALL IN THE WORLD PRICES OF<br />
MANY OF OUR PRIMARY EXPORTING COMMODITIES.<br />
THAT IS A NEW ELEMENT WHICH REQUIRES A NEW RESPONSE-SOM4E<br />
$ 41BILLION WAS ADDED TO THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT FOR<br />
THIS REASON IN 1985-86.<br />
THE REDUCTION IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE IS SO LARGE THAT IT IS<br />
NOW COSTING US AROUND $ 6 BILLION A YEAR-WITH LITTLE<br />
PROSPECT OF AN EARLY SHARP REVERSAL OF THESE PRICE FALLS,<br />
POLICY HAS HAD TO INITIATE YET FURTHER AD) JUSTMENTS.<br />
THIS BUDGET HAS DONE SO-</p>
<p>ONE OPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ALLOW NATURE TO TAKE ITS<br />
COURSE BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WILL ADJUST ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.<br />
BUT THAT WOULD HAVE RISKED HIGH iNTEREST RATES, AN UNSTABLE<br />
CURRENCY, GREAT BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY AND MOST LIKELY<br />
PROLONGED RECESSION AND A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF SHARPLY HIGHER<br />
UNEMPLOYMENTo THAT IS NOT THE COURSE WE HAVE CHOSEN WITH THIS BUDGET.<br />
THIS BUDGET AND ITS ASSOCIATED POLICIES Is sEt 1O SMOOTH<br />
THE ADJUSTMENT PATH. IT GUIDES AUSTRALIA THROUGH THE<br />
TRANSITION PERIOD IN A WAY WHICH WILL MAXIMIZE OUR LONG-TERM<br />
GROWTH POTENTIALo<br />
IN OTHER UIORDS THIS BUDGET IS ULTIMATELY AN INVESTMENT IN<br />
JOBS GPOWTII SECURE JOBS, PERMANENT JOBS. IT IS A BUDGET<br />
TO PROVIDE ZONFIDENCE AND CERTAINTY CONFIDENCe AND<br />
CERTAINTY THAT THIS IS A GOVERNMENT WHICH KNOWS WHAT IS<br />
REQUIRED AN3D WILL DELIVER.<br />
CENTRAL TO YHE BUDGET IS FIRM BUT FAIR RESTRAINT ON OUTLAYS.<br />
AT 6.9 PER CENT, THE GROWTH IN NOMINAL OUTLAYS IS LOWER THAN<br />
THE OUTC0* 2E IN ANY YEAR SINCE 1968-69. THE BUDGET PROVIDES<br />
FOR NO GROUTH IN REAL TERMS IN 1986-87, COMPARED TO AN<br />
AVERAGE R'SE OVER THE PAST DECADE OF 3.2 PER CENT.<br />
STARTING FROM THE INHERITANCE BEQUEATHED US BY OUR<br />
PROFLIGATE PREDECESSORS AND REFLECTED IN OUR FIRST BUDGET,<br />
LABOR HAS CONSISTENTLY PRUNED BACK THE GROWTH Of PUBLIC<br />
$ ECTOR OUTLAYS IN EACH SUCCESSIVE BUDGET.<br />
MOREOVER IT IS NOT SIMPLY BUDGET NIGHT BRAVADO. LABOR HAS<br />
AN OUTSTANDING RECORD OF DELIVERING ON BUDGET PROMISESTHE<br />
ABSOLUTE VALUE OF OUR BUDGET OUTLAYS FORECAST ERRORS HAS BEEN<br />
ONLY 0.5 PER CENT OVER OUR FIRST THREE BUDGTS. COMPARE<br />
THAT W8TH THE 2.1 PER CENT NOTCHED UP OVER THE LAST THREE OF<br />
OUR PREDECESSORS. </p>
<p>WHAT CREDIDIILITY HAVE HOWARD'S EMPTY PROMISES TO CONTAIN<br />
BUDGET OUTLAYS WHEN VIEWED AGAINST THIS RECORD?<br />
WHERE ARE HIS ALTERNATIVE SPENDING CUTS? JUST TAKE ONE<br />
TYPICAL EXAM1PLE HIS MEDICARE PROPOSAL WILL LM THE<br />
BUDGET, NOT REDUCE THE DEFICITBRINGINJG<br />
OUTLAYS GROWTH TO A STANDSTILL IN REAL TERMS HAS<br />
NOT BEEN ANJ EASY TrASK UNLIKE ALBERT THIS " PUDDING" SHOWS<br />
THE MARKSWE<br />
HAVE SOUGHT TO APPORTION CUTS FAIRLY, WITH LEAST BURDEN<br />
BORNE BY THOSE LEAST CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING ITGROSS<br />
SAVYINGS TOTALLING WELL OVER $ 3 BILLION HAVE BEEN<br />
ACH9EVED SINCE JANUARY 1985, WITH CUTS IN ALL FUNCTIONAL<br />
AREAS. GROWTH IN THE DEFENCE ALLOCATION AND OVERSEAS AID SPENDING<br />
HAVE EACH~ ZEEN CUT SIGNIFICANTLY.<br />
INEVITABLY SIGNIFICANT CUTS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED IN THE<br />
HEALTHo EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SECUHIIY AREAS-IN THE LATTER<br />
CASE MAXIMUM EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PUT ON TIGHTENING UP<br />
ELIGIBILETY CONDITIONS AND ADMINISTRATION TO DENY BENEFITS<br />
TO THE NON-NEEDY, CHEATS OR THOSE OTHERWISE NOT ENTITLED TO<br />
THEMTHE RESIDUAL LOAD TO BE BORNE TEMPORARILY BY PENSIONERS<br />
COULD NOT BE AVOIDED-IT HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY KEPT VERY<br />
MUCH LIGHTER THAN THAT TO BE BORNE BY WAGE EARNERS, WHO<br />
CLEARLY ARE BETTER PLACEDEVEN<br />
ALLOWING FOR THE REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED, THE SHARE OF<br />
OUTLAYS DEVOTED TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE PAYMENTS IS<br />
EXPECTED TO RISE BY 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS To 27.8 PER CENT<br />
IN 1985-87. THE SHARES OF OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL WAGE<br />
ARE BROADLY UNCHANGED-</p>
<p>BEFORE I LEAVE THE OUILAYS SIDE OF TilE BUDGET THERE IS ONE<br />
ELEMENT OF THE PUBLIC SECrOR THAT DOES REMIND ME VERY MUCH<br />
OF THE " MAGIC PUDDING". THAT IS PUBLIC SECTOR STAFFING. IF<br />
PREVIOUS EFFORTS ARE ANY GUIDE THE MORE YOU TRY TO CUT ' EM<br />
THE MORE THEY GROWTHE<br />
FLAW IV PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAS BEEN THAT STAFF CONTROLS<br />
HAVE ONLY DEE EFFICACIOUS IN THE SHORT-TERM. THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT IS DEVELOPING A NUMBER OF REFORMS TO STREAMLINE<br />
AND RATIONAL2SE PUBLIC SERVICE PROCEDURES AND STAFFING WHICH<br />
WILL PRODUCE SUSTAINED RESULTS.<br />
AN EARNEST OF THESE INTENTIONS HAS BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE<br />
BUDGET. STAFF NUMBERS ARE TO BE CUT BY 2000 OVER THE COURSE<br />
OF 1986-87-) EPARTMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN<br />
" EFFICIENCY DIVIDEND" EACH YEAR, SOMEWHAT AKIN TO INCREASED<br />
PRODUCTIVITY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I WILL BE ANNOUNCING<br />
THE GOVERNME'T'S MEASURES TO ASSIST IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS<br />
LATER IN SEPTEMBERTAX<br />
REFORM RFMAINS CENTRAL TO THIS GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA.<br />
PERSONAL TAX CUTS WILL BE DELIVERED ON I DECEMBER, WITH THE<br />
FINAL TRANCHE ON 1 JULY 1987. THIS LUMMIIMENI WILL HE EMBEDDED IN<br />
LEGISLATION FOR PASSAGE IN THE CURRENT SESSION,<br />
EVEN AFTER ALLOWING FOR THE GREATER CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH<br />
CARE FUNDIVG WHICH OUR CIRCUMSTANCES NOW REQUIRE FROM THE<br />
MEDICARE LEVY, ORDINARY WAGE EARNERS WILL RECEIVE A TAX CUT<br />
FROM 1 DEC Fl3ER 01-ABOUT $ 6 P. w. THE VALUE OF THE TAX CUTS<br />
BY 1987-38 VILL BE 3 TIMES THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE RAISED IN<br />
THE TAX PACKAGE.<br />
THERE ARE NO NEW DIRECT IMPOSTS ON BUSINESS IN THIS BUDGET.<br />
HOWEVER ONE SIGNIFICANT ANOMOLY HAS BEFN CORRECTED-ABOUT<br />
PER CENT OF COMPANIES, TYPICALLY AMONGST rHE LARGEST, HAVE<br />
HAD A TAX ADVANTAGE NUT AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES AND<br />
CERTAINLY KOT AVAILABLE TO ORDINARY WAGE EARNERS. THE<br />
ADVANTAGE HAS ARISEN BECAUSE OF THF ACCOUNTING PFRInDS THEY<br />
HAVE ADOPTED. </p>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE GENERAL NEED FOR RESTRAINT AND TO ACHIEVE<br />
GREATER EQUITY BETWEEN TAXPAYERS THESE COMPANIES HAVE NOW<br />
BEEN REGUESTED TO MOVE, PROGRESSIVELY, ONTO THE COMMON TAX<br />
REGIMETHIS 6OVERNMENr HAS ACCEPTED AN UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE OF<br />
FISCAL PLANNING DISCIPLINE, REPRESENTED BY THE FISCAL<br />
TRILOGYÃ¸ CON4ISTEN7 WITH THOSE COMMITMENTS OUTLAYS HAVE DECLINED AS A<br />
PROPORTlCN OF GDP IN EACH OF THE 1985-86 AND THE 1986-87<br />
BUDGETS.<br />
FURTHER THE BUDGET DEFICIT Ir 1986-87 IS LESS THAN HALF THE<br />
GDP SWAZ OF 1984-85 AND ONE-THIRD OF THE 4.2 PER CENT<br />
POSTED mw 1983-84 ( EVEN AFTER SUBStANIIAL EXPENDIrURE<br />
PRUNING BY THE INCOMING LABOR GOVERNMENT). IT IS HALF. WHAT<br />
WOULD HAVE RESULTED THIS YEAR IF WE HAD NOT ACTED TO CURB<br />
SPENDING AND SUPPLEMENT REVENUE.<br />
AGGREGATE TAXATION REGEIPTS IN 1985-86 WERE SLIGHTLY LESS<br />
THAN THE BUDGET NIGHT ESTIMATE. HAD NOMINAL GDP MET<br />
EXPECTATIONS THE TRILOGY LIMIT WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED NOT<br />
ONLY ON BUDGET NIGHT BUT ALSO AS AN OUTCOME-IN THE EVENT<br />
THE PLANNED LIMIT HAS BEEN EXCEEDED.<br />
IT REMAINS OUR OBJECTIVE TO REDUCE TAX RECEIPTS TO 25 PER<br />
CENT OF GDP, THE " TRILOGY LIMIT". HOWEVER, HAVING EXERCISED<br />
REMARKABLE EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE<br />
GREATER PRIORITY IS TO REDUCE THE BUDGET DEFICIT IN 1986-87.<br />
ACCORDINGLY ADDIfIONAL rAX REVENUE HAS BEEN SOUGHT.<br />
TAX RECEIPTS WILL IEND 10 FALL NATURALLY BY AROUND 1 PER<br />
CENT OF 6DP IN 1987-88. THIS WILL OCCUR BECAUSE THE TAX<br />
CUTS PROPOSED FOR 1 JULY WILL PRUCEtI) ON TIME. HOWEVER THE<br />
DECISION ABOUT THE TAX SHARE OF GDP IN THE 1987-88 BUDGET<br />
WILL BE TAKEN N THE LIGHT OF CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME. </p>
<p>IWOULD ADD THAT THE ACOLADE FOR THE HIGHEST TAXING<br />
GOVERNMENT Irl AUSTRALIA RESTS PROPERLY WITH MR HOWARD.<br />
A DJUSTIMG FOR CHANGES IN THE M1ETHOD OF FINANCING HEALTH<br />
XFE" iVITURE, TAX RECEIPTS ARE 24.6 PER CENT OF 6DP iw<br />
p987. THA7 tS LESS THAN MR HOWARD'S RECORD OF 24.7 PER<br />
CEt4T IN 1nU8l-82.<br />
IF I PAN RE7JURN TO THlE " MAGI: C PUDDING" FOR A MINUTE YOU MAY<br />

OUR HISTORV SHOWS CLEARLY THE VALUE TO US OF OUR CENTRALISED<br />
WAGES SYSTEM. THE BREAKDOWN OF THE SYSTEM TOWARDS THE END OF THE<br />
HOWARD ERA ? RODUCED THE HIGHLY UNDISCIPLINED 16 PER CENT ANNUAL<br />
INCREASE IN EARNINGS, IN 1982, AND IT WAS<br />
THIS SYSTEM WHICH HAS PRODUCED A REAL WAGE CUT OF 5 PERoCENT<br />
OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS A CUr OF 5 PER CENT IN AUSTRALIA<br />
WHICH COMPARES WITH A FALL OF 1 PER CENT IN rHE US AND A<br />
RISE OF 10 PER CENT IN THE UK.<br />

CLEARLY TIS BUDGET REDUCES THE DEFICIT BY OVER $ 2 BILLION.<br />
THE NET DOND SELLING TASK IS ZERO. THE DIRECT CLAIM ON THE<br />
FINANCIAL nARKETS HAS THUS BEEN SHARPLY REDUCEDTHIS<br />
BUDGET IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE SCOPE TO SHIFT THE BURDEN<br />
OF POLICY AWAY FROM MONETARY POLICY.<br />
IT WILL HELP TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF INTEREST RATES AND<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO GREATER STABILITY OF THE CURRENCY.<br />
IN THESE WAYS AND BY PROVIDING CONFIDENCE THAT POLICIES ARE<br />
