SPEECH BY THE PRIE MIPiSTER, THE HON P4J. KEATING MP<br />
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE HONOURSv SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE<br />
FRIDAY, 1 OCTOBER 1993<br />
It is a very great pleasure for me to be here this evening to honour such a distinguished<br />
group of Australian artists, who have given so much to their fellow Australians and the<br />
world at large.<br />
But I know you will excuse mc if 1 don't speak at length tonight about the recipients or<br />
the awards.<br />
Their records are a much more eloquent testament than I could hope to provide.<br />
Having said that, however, theme is one performer here tonight that I do wish to pay<br />
special tribute to.<br />
Walter Burley Griffin, perhaps the greatest architect in Australa's history, oncc very<br />
truly said that " buildings are the most subtle, accurate and enduring records of life."<br />
Tonight I want to pay tribute to such a budlding to the Sydncy Opera House itself,<br />
one of the best architectural decisions that we ever made in Australia.<br />
It was said somewhere that:<br />
".. Whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel,<br />
999 peoplc out of a 1000 are totally incapable of seeing what is put before<br />
themn. It taikes at least 40 years before they can manage to make it out."<br />
There's truth in the observation, but in the case of the Opera House it is only a half<br />
truth. It's certainly true that when the Opera House was under considcration and in the<br />
process of being built, many Australians just didn't know what to make of it. There </p>
<p>TEL: 1. Oct. M-3 13': 222 No. 027 P. 02/ C<br />
were no other buildings like it in Australia, and you never saw anything like it on your<br />
overseas tour to Covent Garden, or Paris or Milan or wherever.<br />
So wc got the snide comments about the Danish Blue Danish Bluc, of course, was<br />
then a peak of cultural sophistication.<br />
The doubters and the slaves to cultural conformity were out in force, and it took a<br />
major effort to ensure that what now seems thc only WsibIe design for the site, should<br />
prevail. It did not take 40 years for the people of Sydney and Australia to call the Opera House<br />
their own. In a very short time they were delighting in it, and world wide, with Ayers<br />
Rock it was recognised as one of the two great symbols of Australia.<br />
The extraordinary symbolic importance of this building was brought home to me in<br />
Ireland a few days ago, when a man told me how he had gone to Australia recently and<br />
when he stood in front of the Opera House, he said, he couldn't believe he was actually<br />
there. What he described was the way Australians used to feel standing in front of Big Ben or<br />
the Tower of London.<br />
In Monte Carlo it was quite apparent that everyone related their concept of Australia<br />
to these two images, the Opera House and Uluru, and I do not think it is drawing too<br />
long a bow to suggest that they deserve some of the credit for getting us the Games.<br />
John Douglas Pringle, I think, captured the essence of what we feel about the Opera<br />
House when he wrote that:<br />
" There it stands a perfect symbol liniking the city to the sea, welcoming<br />
incoming ships with its wide open arches, shining brilliantly in the summer sun<br />
or gleaming palely by moonlight, contemporary in feeling yet reminding us of<br />
other ages when great buildings were built to the glory of God or the splendour<br />
of princes and not simply for utilitarian purposes it is a building of which all<br />
Australians may rightly be prud...".<br />
It is also significant, I think, that one of the recipients of an award here tonight, Dame<br />
Joan Sutherland, was a important member of our winning team in Monte Carlo.<br />
Dame Joan, like other award winners, has been a trail-blazer for Australia for many<br />
years. She, and Richard Bonynge, Don Burrows, Ruth Cracknell, Sir Charles Mackerras,<br />
Gracme Murphy and Janet Vernon and Garth Welch and Marilyn Jones have done it<br />
hard for Australia. </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
I know that they would all prote~ st that they loved what they were doing, and wouldn't<br />
have swapped it for quids. And I'm sure that's truc.<br />
But tlhat doesn't mean that the rest of us should fail to recognise and acknowledge just<br />
what a debt we owc them.<br />
Not just our young performers who have had opened for them doors which these<br />
peoplc had to prise open for themselves.<br />
But evcryone who has found life a bit easier because of what thcy have done to<br />
establish Australia in the eyes of thc world as a rich and creative culture.<br />
These people dcserve our profound thanks.<br />
They have given us enormous pleasure.<br />
Thcy enrich our. lives.<br />
Their art inspires us to try a little bit harder anid to live a little hit better, and I feel<br />
privileged to be among those honouring them tonight. TEL. O: ct. 973 18: 22 No. 027 P. 03/ C </p>
