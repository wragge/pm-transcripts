TASi-fIAN APPLE AI\ N FEAR IN. BUSTRY<br />
Exchange of Telegrans between the Prime Minister and<br />
the Premier of Tasmania<br />
Following are texts of telegrams exchanged between the Prime<br />
Minister, i* r. Holt, and the Premier of Tasmania, IMr. Reece, regarding<br />
the impact on the apple and pear industry of the British devaluation:-<br />
Telegram to Prime Minister fro Mr. Reece date. d 22nd Noiemn<br />
" Strongly request that you arrange discussions in Canberra if<br />
desired to per;, ni my Government and State fruit Board to ; make<br />
submissions concerning serious effect of British devaluation and<br />
suggested increase in overseas shipping freights on Tasmanian apple<br />
and pear industry. Also seek clarity on press statement of Mr.<br />
Anthony of 13th November that relief for growers of fruit held in<br />
Suez Canal be first looked into by State Government as I un'. erstand<br />
all relevant Tasmanian information has already been furnished by<br />
representatives of the industry."<br />
Telegram to Mr. eece froPrime I. nister dated 24. November<br />
" Reference your telep. ram 22nd November concerning possible<br />
impact on Tasmanian Apple and Pear InCustry of devaluation of<br />
Pound Sterling and proposed increase in overseas shipping freights.<br />
In my announcement earlier this week of the Government's<br />
decision to maintain the existing value of Australian dollar, I said<br />
that we were arranging for an urgent examination of areas of industry<br />
likely to be adversely affected by the Government's decision. As<br />
part of this examination, my colleague, the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, has sought information from the Australian Apple and Pear<br />
Board of the full implications of the effects of the British<br />
devaluation on the apple and pear industry. It is considered . that<br />
the Board would, in the first instance, be in the best position to<br />
assess these implications.<br />
Regarding the suggested increase in overseas shipping<br />
freights, I understand that, while the proposal is that the<br />
sterling rate be increased, the payments in Australian currency to<br />
meet the adjusted freight rates should be lower. I am informed<br />
that there should, in fact, be a decrease in freight paid by<br />
Australian exporters to the United ' ingdom. and the Continent., The<br />
actual extent of any freight movement will be dete rined in<br />
negotiations with the Australian shipper body in this trade on<br />
which the Australian Apple and Pear Board is represented.<br />
You referred to a recent oress statement by the Minister<br />
for Primary Industry concerning Australian apples and pears held<br />
in the Suez Canal. My colleague' 3 statement of 1lth November<br />
made reference to the difficulty of ascertaining identity of and<br />
extent to which individual growers are actually experiencing hardship.<br />
Information needs to be collected from all States for this<br />
ourpose. Tasmanian information has been received from State Fruit<br />
board thro gh Apple and Pear Board. All Tasmanian growers wiith<br />
fruit in the Canal are listed but I should point out that it is<br />
not possible to dissect from it precisely which cases are hardship </p>
<p>cases. As an illustration, one grower listed has six cases in the<br />
Canal out of a total season's shipment of nearly seven thousand<br />
cases but the State Board has given no comment as to whether this<br />
case ( or several similar ones) is to be considered a hardship case<br />
or not. The Minister's statement also pointed out that if it is<br />
established that some growers whose fruit is involved are<br />
experiencing financial difficulties the provision of relief for<br />
them is a matter that would normally be looked into by the State<br />
Governments concerned in the first instance."<br />
