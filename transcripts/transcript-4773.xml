FOR PRESS 13 AUGUST 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
On Tuesday, the Treasurer, Mr Howard, will bring down the<br />
Government's Budget for the current financial year. I do<br />
not wish to and cannot refer in any detail to the measures<br />
he will be announcing. They are the result of intensive<br />
discussion within the Government over many weeks.<br />
Some of the decisions made have been difficult ones, but<br />
they have been the right decisions.<br />
The twin evils which face Australia today are the evils of<br />
inflation and unemployment. The only way to raise employment<br />
on a long-term sustainable basis is to beat inflation and<br />
restore economic health.<br />
The measures which the Government has been taking over the<br />
past two and a half years to beat inflation have achieved<br />
results. In the year to June 1978, the Consumer Price Index<br />
rose 7.9 percent, which was a substantive improvement on the<br />
increase of 16.9 percent in the year to June 1975. As a<br />
consequence, interest rates are moving down. Economic<br />
confidence is reviving.<br />
The success which the Government has been having has gained<br />
international acknowledgement from the Organisation for<br />
Economic Co-operation and Development.<br />
The OECD in its review of the economies of member countries<br />
for July, pays tribute to Government incentives for their<br />
part in sustaining private investment in Australia.<br />
It expects the growth in Australia's Gross Domestic Product<br />
during 1978 to be three and three quarter percent.<br />
This is despite a generally gloomy view by the OECD, whose<br />
forecasts suggest no substantial improvement in world<br />
growth and little progress around the world in lowering<br />
inflation further.<br />
Although the long-term average annual growth in world trade<br />
has been eight percent, the OECD expects this to be only<br />
five percent this year and into 1979. Australia's recovery<br />
is thus taking place against the background of a. weak world<br />
trading situation. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
It is particularly important to note that the OECD is now<br />
forecasting a rate of inflation in Australia during 1978<br />
of under seven percent, based on the broad-based GDP deflator.<br />
This means that Australia, in two years, has quickly brought<br />
its inflation into line with that of the OECD average.<br />
What we must now do, and what, above all, the Government's<br />
policies are designed to achieve, is to drive that inflation<br />
down further. We are determined, this financial year to have<br />
our inflation well below that of the OECD average.<br />
This is the only realistic option we have, in the context of<br />
the world economic scene. This is the only way we will keep<br />
our products competitive, gain new markets for our exports,<br />
and attract overseas private capital to Australia.<br />
This is the route we must take if we are to be properly ready<br />
to gain a growing share of the expansion of world trade, when<br />
it comes.<br />
Some few economic critics in Australia have attacked the policies<br />
which have produced lower inflation, advocating instead<br />
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. One well publicised<br />
set of such proposals would increase the Budget deficit to<br />
between $ 4.5 billion to $ 5 billion and finance it by expanding<br />
the national debt.<br />
There would have to be substantial increases in interest rates<br />
even to attempt to finance deficits of this magnitude and the<br />
inevitable result would be failure.<br />
A Government doing this would increase greatly the money supply.<br />
The effect on overseas investment in Australia would be serious.<br />
There would be a revival of inflationary expectations and a blow<br />
to confidence amongst consumers and investors. There would be<br />
an end to any hope of success in sustaining a policy of wage<br />
moderation which is crucial in the fight against unemployment<br />
and inflation.<br />
Such an expansionary approach has been widely opposed in business<br />
and financial circles. I am also glad to see that Professor Corden<br />
has pointed out the fallacies in the argument of those calling<br />
for such a change in Government policies. In his words: " Wage<br />
moderation is and remains the key." When I was overseas I found<br />
no support for such action in any of the countries I visited.<br />
The Government knows that the economic road we are on is a<br />
difficult one. But in all plainness, I must say that if we<br />
are to restore economic health and revive employment on a longterm<br />
sustainable basis, there is no alternative. We must adhere<br />
to those economic policies which over the past two years have<br />
cut inflation in half and begun the revival of business confidence.<br />
