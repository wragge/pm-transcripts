N. B:<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY L<br />
PROME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 SEPTEMBER, 1978<br />
BUDGET DEBATE<br />
The Budget which the Treasurer has brought down is a Budget<br />
of responsibility and vision a Budget which has accepted<br />
the need to take difficult decisions because this Government<br />
recognises that failing to take these decisions would<br />
squander our hard won gains in reducing inflation and<br />
interest rates and end the progress towards economic recovery.<br />
This is a Budget in which the long-term interests of<br />
Australians have been placed above any consideration of<br />
short-term political advantage.<br />
The strategy which guides it is the one which this Government<br />
has consistently pursued since being elected: a strategy<br />
to revive the private sector and put Australia firmly on the<br />
path to long-lasting real growth; a strategy to make our<br />
industries competitive, tough enough to compete successfully<br />
in world markets; a strategy to achieve low inflation and<br />
high prosperity.<br />
The only path to lasting economic growth lies in achieving<br />
the essential pre-conditions for growth. The maintenance<br />
of fiscal and monetary stability and a responsible approach<br />
to wages will bring lower inflation, lower interest rates<br />
and increasing confidence by investors, both local and<br />
overseas.<br />
Essential to the achievement of all of these objectives was<br />
a lower deficit. We therefore had to continue our restraint<br />
of Government expenditure and make sure that Australia's<br />
taxpayers would receive full value for their tax dollars.<br />
By rigorously scrutinising every programme, we held down the<br />
rate of growth in Government spending to 7.7 percent, the<br />
lowest for a decade. But beyond this, the low deficit demanded<br />
by economic responsibility required an increase in indirect<br />
taxes and the introduction of a temporary increase in<br />
income tax.<br />
We took that course because we were determined to act responsibly<br />
in the long-term interests of this country, and because we did<br />
so, this Budget will strengthen the confidence of investors,<br />
employers and consumers. They know that this Budget will drive<br />
inflation down further. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Inflation at an annual rate of 5 percent is within our<br />
reach by mid-1979. This means that we will have brought<br />
our inflation down much faster than most O. E. C. D. countries<br />
in the last three years. It will also mean that, once<br />
again, Australia's inflation is significantly below that<br />
of the O. E. C. D. average. What we are determined to do<br />
is lower our inflation further.<br />
In a world in which competition for private capital and<br />
overseas investment is intense and international trade is<br />
weak, it is essential that Australia stand out as one of<br />
the few strong economies in the world. This means we must<br />
have low inflation. We must extinguish for good the fires<br />
of inflationary expectations. Only in these ways can we<br />
earn a growing share of world trade, and attract increased<br />
investment capital from overseas leading to increased<br />
employment. The Government' s approach was wholeheartedly endorsed last week<br />
by the Secretariat of G. A. T. T. in its Annual Report.<br />
The Report said, and I quote: " The inescapable conclusion<br />
is that the industrial countries can only move towards<br />
increased growth and employment and towards sustainable<br />
payments positions and more stable exchange rates,<br />
by reducing their inflation rates to the levels experienced<br />
until the mid-1960' s".<br />
With lower inflation our industries will get a larger share of<br />
domestic markets, and an increasing share of export markets.<br />
Domestic and overseas investors will both be encouraged and with<br />
the increasing competitiveness of Australian goods and<br />
increased investment we will have more economic activity and<br />
more employment.<br />
Our policies are based on a real concern for the unemployed,<br />
unlike those policies put forward by the Labor Party who try<br />
to use the unemployment issue for their political advantage,<br />
promising fraudulent, illusory cures for their own political<br />
gain. I<br />
We know that there is no quick or easy solution. We have the<br />
courage to stick to policies that will lead to lasting increases<br />
in employment and I would like to repeat the view of G. A. T. T.:<br />
" The inescapable conclusion is that the industrialised countries<br />
can only move towards increased growth and employment... . by<br />
reducing their inflation rates to the levels experienced<br />
until the mid-1960' s". What G. A. T. T. is saying in fact is that<br />
employment can only be improved if countries follow the<br />
kinds of policies adopted by the Government.<br />
Some people have called for the fiscal stimulus of much higher<br />
Government spending. Today, this is not a realistic option.<br />
It would simply result in an acceleration of inflation, and the<br />
speedy. withdrawal of overseas investors. Instead of taking<br />
this path of false stimulus, what we are doing is reinforcing the<br />
recovery process of the private sector by lowering inflation<br />
and hence lowering interest rates. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The Budget aims at providing a substantial sustained<br />
stimulus to the private sector in the form of further<br />
reductions in interest rates. Home buyers, farmers, businessmen,<br />
builders, consumers and investors will all benefit from<br />
this policy.<br />
Let me demonstrate the advantage to home buyers. On, say,<br />
a home loan of $ 25,000 being repaid over 25 years, each<br />
one percent reduction in interest rates will mean a saving<br />
in the order of $ 17 a month or $ 5,000 over the period<br />
of the loan. The 0.5 percent reduction achieved earlier this<br />
year presently yields a saving of $ 9 a month. I am confident<br />
that it will not be long before further savings are available.<br />
In the case of industrial companies raising debenture capital,<br />
the reductions in interest rates on new issues over the last<br />
year have been up to about 1.25 percent, thereby helping to<br />
contain costs and to stimulate investment.<br />
The overwhelmingly favourable response in the Australian financial<br />
markets to the Government's Budget strategy should be clear<br />
to all. It is seen in the very large subscription of $ 780 million<br />
to the August loan much the greater part of which has<br />
come from non-bank sources. This has set us well on the way<br />
to financing the 1978-79 Budget in a non-inflationary manner.<br />
It is another clear sign of market expectations of falling<br />
interest rates. The Budget has also renewed the confidence<br />
of the overseas business community in our economy.<br />
On 21 August, at the notorious Sydney rally which dissolved<br />
into violence violence for which the Leader of the Opposition<br />
frantically tried to disclaim any responsibility, Mr. Hayden<br />
said that under this Budget business conditions will be much<br />
tougher.<br />
Well, let's hear what the Australian Chamber of Commerce had to<br />
say on the Budget they're a rather more reliable source<br />
for estimating the Budget's effects on business than Mr. Hayden.<br />
The Chamber said: " Business accepts the argument underlying<br />
the Budget, namely that inflation remains Australia's number<br />
one economic problem, and that the way to improve the employment<br />
situation is to reduce Government deficit financing and to<br />
give encouragement to private enterprise to expand... The smaller<br />
than expected deficit should ease the pressures on the money<br />
market, and help clear the way to lower interest rates.--This<br />
should help stimulate demand for capital for housing and business."<br />
It's clear that Mr. Hayden is wrong in his statement about this<br />
Budget's impact on the business community. But it must be<br />
said, in all fairness to the Honourable Gentleman, that he does<br />
concede the advantages of our new health arrangements.<br />
In his alternative Budget, he endorses our changes. They<br />
greatly simplify the health system, provide basic universal<br />
health cover, help to contain health costs, give people a<br />
choice as to how they will meet their health expenditures,<br />
and protect pensioners and other socially disadvantaged groups.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Those in real need will not find this a harsh Budget.<br />
Expenditure on key programmes for the aged, handicapped,<br />
and children have recorded significant increases.<br />
To take only some cases: expenditure on aged, invalid,<br />
widow's pensions and supporting parent's benefits up<br />
by 11.5 percent to $ 4,643 million; expenditure on<br />
subsidised pensioner housing is up 40 percent; assistance<br />
to organisations providing facilities for handicapped persons<br />
will rise by 37 percent to $ 52 million. Increased funds<br />
are provided for the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service<br />
and the Handicapped Child's Allowance is extended to<br />
students aged 16 to 25 who do not receive an invalid<br />
pension. There is a sharp increase in funds, as a result of the<br />
Galbally Report, to meet areas of need in services for<br />
migranzts. In Home Care for the Aged, even though the<br />
subsidy rate has been varied to meet greatly increased<br />
demand, total spending will still increase 14 percent<br />
to over $ 10 million. That makes a rise of 83 percent<br />
in home care for the aged in the last three Budgets.<br />
I have said that all taxpayers will be required to pay a<br />
temporary increase in income tax this year. Despite this<br />
temporary income tax increase, let me emphasise and<br />
demonstrate why this Government is a low tax Government.<br />
This financial year, taxpayers will be paying over $ 3,000 million<br />
less in personal income tax than they would have paid if the<br />
1975 Hayden tax scales had still applied. The total personal<br />
income tax savings to taxpayers over the three financial<br />
years to 1978-79 will be about $ 6,400 million.<br />
Let's take the example for 1978-79 of a man on estimated<br />
average weekly earnings with a dependent wife and two children.<br />
Compared with the old Hayden days, he will be better off by<br />
$ 13 per week: $ 6 less income tax; $ 7 because the family allowance<br />
is so much more than the old child endownment. His disposable<br />
income is substantially greater because of our reform of the<br />
tax rates, our introduction of indexation, and our<br />
enlightened policy towards the family.<br />
Even with the temporary income tax increase, the growth in<br />
personal income tax collections in 1978-79 will be significantly.<br />
less 6.7 percent than in 1977-78 9.7 percent.<br />
In both years, tax collections will have risen more slowly than<br />
personal incomes, reversing the trend towards a rising tax<br />
burden which has persisted so long.<br />
In addition to these tax cuts, large tax reductions have been<br />
made available to companies and businesses. This financial<br />
year for example the investment allowance and stock<br />
valuation adjustment will have a cost to revenue of<br />
over $ 700 million. In the light of these figures, the temporary<br />
income tax increase in this year's Budget is relatively<br />
small no one could doubt that the Government has a<br />
fundamental commitment to lower tax. </p>
<p>For the motorist, the rise in petrol prices will be offset<br />
by the large fall in the price of new cars resulting from<br />
our sales tax cuts. As the recent barrage of advertisements<br />
indicate, the price of a standard saloon previously<br />
retailing at $ 7,000 will fall by over $ 500. Such a reduction,<br />
for the average motorist, exceeds five years' added petrol<br />
costs.<br />
The decision will be a tremendous boost to the automotive<br />
industry a major employer. The Federal Chamber of<br />
Automotive Inidustries predicts that an additional 20,000<br />
motor vehicles will be sold this year as a direct result of<br />
the cut in sales tax.<br />
This is a Budget of responsibility; a Budget in stark contrast<br />
to the document the Leader of the Opposition pretentiously<br />
referred to as " The Alternative Budget". Never has an<br />
Opposition shown so clearly that there is no responsible<br />
alternative to the course being pursued by the Government.<br />
The Opposition cannot even be said to have learned nothing<br />
from the past they're now trying to re-write history.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition, in his * reply to the Budget,<br />
said with a straight face that 1974 was a " buoyant"<br />
year, and he's right all sorts of key indicators were<br />
floating through the roof in 1974. Inflation was up to<br />
16 percent. Unemployment was up from 103,000 in December<br />
1973 to 267,000 in December 1974. Average weekly earnings<br />
were up 28 percent. Commonwealth spending was up in 1974-75<br />
by 46 percent. P. A. Y. E. receipts were up 43 percent. The<br />
overdraft rate was up from 9Aj percent to 11 percent.<br />
Mr. Hayden looks back with yearning to those balmy days of<br />
1974 when Labor was in Government and the economy out of control.<br />
Who said nostalgia isn't what it used to be.<br />
But still, we shouldn't complain too much about the " Alternative<br />
Budget". We have been waiting all year to know what policies<br />
Labor was coming up with. We need never have wondered.<br />
They haven't changed. They still have not learned. His<br />
alternative' Budget is a rehash of the same old recipe for<br />
economic disaster that Labor cooked up in its three years of<br />
office: more public spending; bigger deficits; and the<br />
imposition of penal and retrospective taxes on the business<br />
communi ty.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition, through his usual advanced<br />
arithmetic, purported to show that the Budget he would have<br />
brought down would have a deficit of $ 3.6 billion. A deficit<br />
as large as this would be irresponsible. It would accelerate<br />
inflation, force up interest rates, undermine the prospects for<br />
sustained growth and destroy the confidence of domestic and<br />
overseas investors in the Australi-an economy.<br />
In fact, Labor's deficit for 1978-79 would not be $ 3.6 billion,<br />
but over $ 4.5 billion. His revenue proposals would raise only<br />
a fraction of the $ 1,490 million he claims. He wants to raise<br />
an additional $ 400 million by abolishing the investment<br />
allowance. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
The investment allowance in 1978-79 relates almost<br />
entirely to expenditure incurred by taxpayers in good<br />
faith in earlier years. No money whatsoever could be<br />
raised in this financial year from the abolition of this<br />
allowance, unless, of course, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
intended to make a retrospective adjustment, penalising<br />
plant and equipment already installed and in use.<br />
It is time the Leader of the Opposition came clean.<br />
He should tell -us whether he intends to make it retrospective,<br />
or whether his figures are wrong, or whether he simply<br />
doesn't know what he's talking about.<br />
He wants to raise an additional $ 340 million from, and I use<br />
his precise words, " a levy on windfall profits flowing to<br />
oil companies because of the Government's policy of crude<br />
oil pricing". I pointed out,' to his great enbarassment, that<br />
his figures were crook. He has now attempted a further<br />
explanation of his proposal. He says: " We have not suggested<br />
taxing them which would produce a lag we propose a<br />
levy". There is a very clear distinction here. He proposes<br />
to strip revenue off oil producing companies in Australia,<br />
regardless of their profitability. He says he cannot wait<br />
he must divert oil producers' revenue back into Government<br />
coffers ' imimediately". He now says he would not do this through<br />
the tax system which would of course involve a lag, but<br />
by an arbitrary change that took no account of the costs of<br />
exploration and development expenditure already undertaken<br />
or committed.<br />
In brief, Mr. Hayden would not bother with the question of<br />
whether oil producing companies were or were not making a profit.<br />
As I said yesterday, we are informed that the estimated<br />
after-tax profits of oil producers from crude oil production will<br />
probably not even amount to $ 300 million in 1978-79. In short,<br />
a $ 340 million slug by Mr. Hayden against these major<br />
businesses in Australia would be a brutal assault. It would be<br />
guaranteed to put paid once again to the oil search in Australia.<br />
Perhaps we should expect one of the architects of the previous<br />
attack against these companies to dream of having another go.<br />
Mr. Hayden says that he wants to raise $ 300 million by imposing<br />
a capital gains tax. The Honourable Leader of the Opposition<br />
may recall that the Government of which he was a Minister,<br />
announced it would introduce a capital gains tax in 1974.<br />
Mr. Crean couldn't say how much it would raise, gave no estimate<br />
of the possible revenue yield, and admitted that its introduction<br />
would be delayed because:-' There are many complex technicalities<br />
involved and extensive anti-avoidance provisions will be<br />
required". Eventually the whole misconceived idea was abandoned.<br />
Now, apparently, there are no complex technicalities, no<br />
difficulties in introducing immediate legislation, no problems in<br />
realising immediate large gains to the revenue. </p>
<p>7<br />
The Leader of the Opposition blurted out that Labor would have<br />
tried to introduce the Capital Gains Tax at the time of the<br />
last General Election. Well, they certainly didn't tell the<br />
people of Australia about that during the election campaign.<br />
Not that of course, I doubt for a moment that Labor had the<br />
covert intention to impose such a tax the moment the polls<br />
were declared. But even with the worst will in the world,<br />
they could not have introduced it immediately.<br />
There are a great many questions raised by Capital Gains Tax.<br />
Would the tax apply only to realised gains? Would allowance<br />
be made for inflation which creates fictional but not real<br />
gains? Would the tax fall only on gains accruing after the<br />
announcement? Would capital losses be deductible against<br />
capital gains?<br />
Mr. Hayden in a stroke of genius has cut through all these<br />
fundamental questions. Given his economic audacity, these<br />
basic questions must seem mere quibbles. Now he says he wants<br />
to have a provisional gains tax on individuals. The mind<br />
boggles. But two things are clear it would simply not<br />
be possible to raise revenue from a capital gains tax in<br />
1978-79 even given the ALP's rapacity. It is also clear<br />
that under the Alternative Budget, no one would be making<br />
capital gains for long.<br />
Next, the Leader of the Opposition wants to raise $ 150 million<br />
this year from a so-called resources rental tax. It is not<br />
clear how a tax of this sort could have been introduced in<br />
the 1978-79 Budget to yield as much as $ 150 million in this<br />
financial year.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition seems to have no conception of<br />
the difficulty of developing a complex measure of this type,<br />
enacting it, and of setting up the necessary administrative<br />
machinery. He also appears to have a-distorted view of what could be raised,<br />
particularly as he has also proposed separately to impose a tax<br />
on the so-called " windfall profits" of the oil producers.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition wants to impose a penal tax on<br />
family trusts to raise $ 100 million this year. This Government,<br />
unlike the last, has already moved to close loopholes in the<br />
abuse of such trust arrangements. So what is now proposed?<br />
When parents die, they often leave their assets in trust<br />
for their children until they reach adult age. Is this to<br />
be subject to a penal tax rate? Parents or grandparents<br />
sometimes put funds in trust to meet the expenses of their<br />
childrens or grandchildrens education. Is this to be<br />
taxed at a penal rate? A married couple who have been<br />
unable to have children of their own may invest money in<br />
trust to help meet the costs of the upkeep of their<br />
nephews, nieces or godchildren. Is this to be penalised<br />
too? / 8 </p>
<p>Mr Hayden says that he would raise $ 200 million by increasing<br />
the taxes of the top 2-3 percent of income earners. Taxes on<br />
all incomes over $ 25,000 would be substantially increased.<br />
The highest marginal rate under Labor would be 72 cents in<br />
the dollar. Even Mr Whitlam never suggested that.<br />
The whole weight of responsible professional opinion, both<br />
in Australia and abroad, is against the imposition of<br />
penal rates of tax on high incomes. The Asprey Committee<br />
suggested that an appropriate long-term target would be to<br />
reduce the highest rate to 50 percent. The Mathews Committee<br />
concluded that " rising marginal tax rates encouraged tax<br />
avoidance and evasion, and may lead to substantial economic<br />
waste because tax avoidance becomnes a basis of investment and<br />
employment decisions." The Jackson Committee ( of which<br />
Mr. Hawke was a member) warned that a society " neglects<br />
at its peril rewards for skill and responsibility".<br />
Professor Henderson, in his major report to the previous<br />
Government, proposed a guaranteed income scheme under which the<br />
highest marginal rate of income tax would be 60 percent.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has sought to deceive the Australian<br />
people by overstating the additional revenue he could raise<br />
by all these means this year by $ 1 billion or more.<br />
Mr. Hayden's deficit would turn out to be at least $ 4.5 billion<br />
and you could add another billion to that because with a couple<br />
of dozen Labor Ministers intent on a spending spree, this<br />
would lead to an explosion of Government spending that no<br />
Labor Treasurer could withstand.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition's proposals gave us an insight into<br />
the depth of his expertise and economic knowledge. An insight<br />
into his financial naivety and incompetence, his failure<br />
to think through his own policies. Even the operation of a simple<br />
pocket calculator is beyond him. No wonder he was Mr. Whitlam's<br />
favourite Treasurer.<br />
A deficit of such a magnitude would be utterly disastrous for<br />
jobs, for confidence, for inflation, for interest rates. But<br />
what is even more disturbing about Labor's alternative proposals<br />
is the basic philosophy which lies behind them.<br />
Labor believes that if you knock profits, destroy business<br />
incentive, shatter confidence in private enterprise, you can<br />
still increase money wages and still keep jobs. This<br />
demonstrable fallacy was the real tragedy of the Labor years.<br />
When you look at the Leader of the Opposition's latest proposals,<br />
it is clear that they would do the same all over again. All the<br />
new Hayden taxes and levies are aimed at the heart of<br />
productive enterprise, at employment-creating industry, at the<br />
businessman, small and large, at the individual who has shown<br />
initiative and effort. These imposts would severely damage<br />
the economy and harm Australia. 9 </p>
<p>Labor's set of tax proposals those on capital gains and<br />
higher marginal rates are directed at destroying the<br />
personal incentives to save and achieve. Confiscatory taxes<br />
would be imposed on those with enterprise and initiative and<br />
effort. It is Labor's continual problem. They can't stand<br />
success; they must penalise it. They are entangled by the<br />
politics of envy.<br />
They can't stand individual success and they can't stand<br />
to see efficient private enterprise developing Australia.<br />
That isxwhy they want to bring in an exorbitant resources<br />
tax, a tax that would stifle all mineral development. That<br />
is why they want to impose a crude oil lev of 340 million on<br />
oil producers, a levy that would halt oil exploration, and make<br />
our future depend on overseas supplies. That is why they<br />
want to impose a $ 300 million capital gains tax, which would<br />
stifle all incentive to achieve and expand. That is why<br />
they would impose a penal tax on trusts for families, a tax<br />
hitting small business and farms. That is why they would end the<br />
investment allowance to stop Australian enterprise increasing<br />
its efficiency and its competitive position in world markets.<br />
After examining the total confusion which the Leader of the<br />
Opposition's proposals represent, it is easy to see what the<br />
Honourable Member for Gellibrand meant when on 30 June of this<br />
year he said, and I quote: " There is considerable uncertainty<br />
within the Party as to what course we should not adopt".<br />
" This... . is a reflection of not only the disillusion that<br />
accompanies loss of Government and electoral defeat, but<br />
also of the recent realisation that economic issues are far<br />
more complex than seemed previously to be the case"<br />
The dawning realisation by the Labor Party that economics is<br />
a complex subject seems to have confused them more than ever.<br />
The Honourable Member of Adelaide has called for interest<br />
rate cuts, while the Leader of the Opposition's irresponsible<br />
proposals would send interest rates through the roof.<br />
The Government's Budget is dedicated to the growth and<br />
development of Australia. It reduces the deficit to a<br />
responsible level; for the second year running, tax collections<br />
are to rise more slowly than personal incomes; it achieves the<br />
lowest increase in Government spending for ten years; it provides<br />
simple and equitable health financing arrangements which protect<br />
everyone against serious illness, and those most in need against<br />
all medical and hospital expenses; it provides increased<br />
assistance in real terms for the aged, for the handicapped, for<br />
migrants, for families.<br />
This Budget plays an essential part in our long term strategy<br />
to create a tougher and more competitive economy. We are not<br />
prepared to squander our hard won gains against inflation and<br />
our progress towards full economic recovery.<br />
By bringing down a sound and responsible Budget by taking<br />
the tough decisions which were essential to the long term </p>
<p>interests of this nation, we have taken another step towards<br />
restoring long lasting growth and prosperity to our country.<br />
With inflation down to 5% the end of this financial year;<br />
with interest rates coming down; with increasing confidence<br />
amongst investors both here and abroad; with an encouraging<br />
inflow of private capital, the Australian economy is now well<br />
on the way to overcoming the damage caused by the three dark<br />
years of Labor.<br />
We are now out-performing many industrialised nations of the<br />
world in reducing inflation. We have already, over the past<br />
three years, instituted fundamental social reforms which have<br />
served the interests of families and those in need.<br />
Australia is the country of opportunity, of natural wealth,<br />
of enterprise. The opportunity is now within our grasp to<br />
create a society of growth and development, of prosperity<br />
and enlightenment, of stability and security.<br />
Our aim is nothing less than to establish in Australia an<br />
unequalled quality of freedom and opportunity for individual<br />
Australians, of compassion and effective help for those in<br />
need, of a country which meets the fundamental needs and<br />
aspirations of all Australians. o 0o-</p>
