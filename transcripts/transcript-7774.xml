    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />BRADRAN TRUST SPRING DINNER<br />SYDNEY 13 OCTOBER 1989<br />Tonight is a very special and precious occasion.<br />Don Bradman is the greatest sporting figure to have emerged<br />in this nation of great sportsmen and women. He is the<br />greatest cricketer of all time. You could include him, with<br />the likes of Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Muhammad Ali and Pole,<br />among the greatest half dozen sporting legends of the<br />century. And he is a very great Australian.<br />Just over two years ago, I had the honour to launch the<br />Bradman Albums in Adelaide.<br />I can honestly say that no duty in my period as Prime<br />Minister has given me more pleasure than that. And it is an<br />equally great honour for Hazel and myself to accept the<br />invitation to be present tonight to help launch the Bradman<br />Trust. The albums of course are a priceless collection of personal<br />memorabilia, essential historical records of Bradman's<br />astonishing achievements. A continued awareness of that<br />cricketing history indeed an awe of it is a very<br />important part of why we are here tonight. And I shall come<br />back to some of that history shortly.<br />But we are also here to honour Don Bradman, the man, and his<br />vision, represented in the Bradman Trust, of the future.<br />The tasks of the Trust include the construction and<br />management of the Bradman Museum at Bowral. When this is<br />completed, it will be a mecca for all cricket lovers, a<br />treasure-house of Bradmania and of cricket. Tomorrow's<br />opening of the Bradman Centennial Pavilion by Nick Greiner<br />promises to be a splendid occasion for all Bradmaniacs. 2 463</p>
<p>But very important, and very significant for what it tells<br />you about Sir Donald Bradman, is the principal objective of<br />the Trust, namely " advancing the physical, cultural and<br />intellectual welfare of the Australian community." In<br />accordance with this goal, the Trust will seek to promote<br />the ideals of cricket, in part through matches at Bradman<br />Oval, Bowral, will fund and manage a national coaching<br />scheme for young Australian cricketers between the ages of<br />11 and 18, and will fund and manage the Bradman Scholarships<br />to Oxford and Cambridge or any Australian University.<br />In other words, Bradman and the Bradman Trust want to do<br />something to help young Australians of today and tomorrow.<br />And not just to develop sporting prowess, important though<br />that is, but to develop mind and character.<br />When I consider this aim, I find myself thinking of the<br />young Bradman growing up in the New South Wales bush in the<br />19201s. His performances as a teenager for Bowral are<br />astonishing even now. You really have to feel sorry for the<br />poor Moss Vale bowlers, subjected twice to Bradman triple<br />centuries, kept in the field for Saturday after Saturday.<br />But this is no more than he was to do in Test cricket within<br />a very few years.<br />Equally extraordinary is the fact of Bradman's cricketing<br />encounters in the Berrima District Cricket Association at<br />that time with Bill O'Reilly, whose family also came from<br />the area. Here you had the greatest batsman of all time<br />facing up to perhaps the most destructive bowler of all<br />time for Bowral against Wingellol Truth is indeed<br />stranger than fiction.<br />The coincidence of these two great careers beginning in the<br />beautiful Southern Highlands of New South Wales serves to<br />remind us of the enormous contribution to Australia made by<br />the bush to mention a few names, Arthur Morris and<br />Doug Walters, who made Dungog famous, and Geoff Lawson and<br />Mark Taylor, from the current Test team, who have links with<br />Wagga, and the vice-captain, Geoff Marsh, from Wandering in<br />Western Australia.<br />Within almost no time of playing country cricket, Don was<br />setting records for the New South Wales Sheffield Shield<br />Team. And in 1929, in his second appearance for Australia,<br />following one of his very rare double failures on debut, he<br />became the youngest player ( to that time) to score a Test<br />century. Hie was 20 years and 129 days old.<br />As a 21-year old, Don Bradman went to England for the first<br />time. If we can say that your normal great batsman occupies<br />the Alps or the Andes, Bradman's natural habitat was the<br />Himalayas. His performances in England In 1930 represent<br />the Everest of Test match batting.<br />2464</p>
<p>Against an attack which included Larwood and Tate, he scored<br />974 runs in five Tests at an average of 139. 1 doubt if any<br />of us here tonight ever expects to see that record broken.<br />Overnight, Bradman became famous throughout the British<br />Empire and at 21 was already the colossus of cricket. And<br />for two decades, he retained that extraordinary stature,<br />despite the invention of the notorious T" bodyline" attack,<br />designed to reduce him to mere mortality, ending his playing<br />career with the magnificent 1948 team, in which Neil Harvey,<br />Keith Miller and Arthur Morris, happily here tonight, played<br />such distinguised hands.<br />But it was not only the peer less performances on the field<br />which set the young Bradman apart. He had and as is so<br />obvious to all who have the pleasure of talking to him, or<br />of listening to the Bradman Tapes retains an outstanding<br />mind.. It shines out in last weekend's previews of Bill<br />Leak's new portrait, which is to be unveiled later tonight.<br />One of his greatest qualities, one indeed which continues to<br />make him an inspiration to millions of Australians, is the<br />pride he takes, notwithstanding subsequent fame and success,<br />in his ordinary background. Don Bradman's early life was<br />the very opposite of privilege and affluence.<br />We know that he was a better than average student at Bowral<br />Intermediate High and got his Intermediate Certificate at an<br />unusually young age. But he left school at 14.<br />in those early years, his brilliant cricketing talent and<br />his ambition shone brightly. Equally important, I believe,<br />was his determination to develop his mind. Without in any<br />sense turning his back on his origins, Bradman refused to be<br />limited by them. We can see this in his seeking out at an<br />early age the great cricket writer and music critic, Neville<br />Cardus, to obtain a list of books to enlarge his horizons.<br />According to Irving Rosenwater's biography, Bradman read<br />every book on Cardus' rigorous list. We can see it in the<br />diary he began to keep after gaining selection for the 1930<br />tour, in which he recorded his keen observations of a world<br />which for an Australian between the wars was bigger and more<br />distant than ours today. We can see it in his love of the<br />piano. It is no wonder that Bradman, the young batting phenomenon,<br />was to show remarkable skills as a conversationalist, public<br />speaker, writer, administrator, businessman. He had the<br />mind for these skills and he had made sure he developed it.<br />The other great quality about Sir Donald Bradman, which<br />showed itself early and never faltered during his years as<br />world-beating batsman and Australian captain, was his<br />sportsmanship. He was always an outstanding representative<br />of his country, respected everywhere in the cricketing 2465</p>
<p>world. 1989 will go down as one of the great years in<br />Australian cricket, alongside, to name a few, 1930, 1934 and<br />1948. But, to my mind, as pleasing as the performances of<br />Allan Border's splendid side was their unfailingly<br />sportsmanlike and professional demeanour. I can pay them no<br />higher compliment than to say that they behaved like one of<br />Bradman's teams.<br />It is therefore wholly appropriate that the Bradman Trust is<br />to emphasise intellect and character as well as sporting<br />skill in its goal of assisting young Australians. Bradmanes<br />ideals will live on through the Trust's efforts and there is<br />no doubt that he will inspire future generations of<br />Australians. The title of Bradman Scholar will surely be a<br />cherished one. How nice it would be to see some confident<br />but modest youngster from the bush as an early recipient.<br />My very large team of researchers otherwise known as Jack<br />Pollard tell me, Don, that you generally let the Oxbridge<br />students off lightly with the bat. He notes, however, that<br />in 1930, in the match at Fenners against Cambridge, you took<br />six of your total of 36 first-class wickets and achieved<br />your best first class bowling figures in the first innings<br />3 for<br />I would like to suggest that you consider adding the<br />University of Leeds to the list of those English<br />institutions of higher learning where the Bradman<br />Scholarships can be enjoyed. I make this suggestion, ladies<br />and gentlemen, on the basis of Don's four Test appearances<br />at Headingley.<br />He certainly enjoyed himself at Leeds. in 1930 he made 334,<br />in 1934 304, in 1938 he failed with a miserable 103, and in<br />1948, at the age of forty, scored 173 not out in what<br />remains Australia's most remarkable victory in all, tour<br />matches, six-innings, once not out, 963 runs, average 192.6.<br />I congratulate Bruce Collins and his fellow Trust members<br />for their inspiration and dedication over the past three<br />years in establishing the Trust and doing a magnificent job<br />in raising funds for the Trust's objectives. I know and<br />appreciate the enthusiasm of sponsors such as Sir Ron<br />Brierley and Basil Sellers. I am pleased that the<br />Commonwealth Government, through the Bicentennial Authority,<br />is a participant and that QAN4TAS, whose operations began in<br />1920, on the eve of the Bradman era, is also contributing.<br />Ladies and gentlemen,<br />one of the sadnesses of the sporting life is that it is<br />relatively brief. We know of all too many examples where<br />the flame of athletic skill, on burning itself out, consumes<br />much of the richness of personality and joy of life which<br />accompanies it.<br />2466</p>
<p>Happily, this rarely happens with cricketers, least of all<br />with Bradman. Don, with your physical and mental fitness<br />you are at the same time an inspiration and a reproach to us<br />all. I gnash my teeth to read, as I did in Philip<br />Derriman's piece last Saturday, that you have beaten your<br />age four times on the golf course this year and that you are<br />playing off twelve at Kooyonga. And, in a moment, we will<br />be privileged to experience once again your articulate and<br />elegant thoughts and the precision of your memory. if I<br />have made any factual errors tonight I fully expect to be<br />dispatched to the mid-wicket fence.<br />Sir Donald, it is an indescribable pleasure for your friends<br />and admirers to have you and Lady Bradman with us tonight.<br />I have said before that no words of mine can adequately<br />capture the uniqueness of your achievements or the special<br />place you have won in the history of this country and in the<br />hearts of its people. So I will use your own words.<br />In the introduction to the Bradman Albums, you wrote:<br />" In retrospect, and surveying the broad canvas, I<br />suppose more than anything else I look back and say I am<br />grateful that as the son of simple country parents, and<br />without the benefit of wealth, power or influence, but<br />with only the talents bestowed upon me by nature, I was<br />able to occupy the highest posts the Australian cricket<br />world had to offer. As a result I was given the<br />opportunity for much of that period to impart my<br />interpretation of the character of this wonderful game<br />which has meant so much to cricket lovers everywhere.<br />in so doing, I am happy in the knowledge that I did not<br />betray the responsibility entrusted to me and I was<br />enabled, I hope, to enhance the best traditions of the<br />sport."<br />Don, with the establishment of the Bradman Trust, you can<br />take satisfaction that that responsibility has been further<br />honoured and those traditions further enhanced. 2 41; 7</p>
