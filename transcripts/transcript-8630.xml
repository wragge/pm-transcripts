PRIME MINISTERj<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
Not for the first time, John Howard has hijacked the<br />
Opposition'a immlgration olicy and called for an intake<br />
" dromatically lower" than both the Government's target and<br />
the Coolition'a.<br />
The Coalition wants 50,000 70,000 nett. Mr Howard wants<br />
next to none if that is what " a virtual moratorium" can be<br />
taken to mean.<br />
The Opposition has a spokesman on immigration and ethnic<br />
affairs, but it is 3ohn Howard who does the talking.<br />
I<br />
And there are signs that neither his tone nor his obsessiOns<br />
have changed much since his notorious outbursts as Liberal<br />
Party leader in the eighties.<br />
While Mr Howard and Dr Hewson cannot agree over the migrant<br />
intake figure each believes to be appropriate, they seem to<br />
be more united in their aversion to multiculturaliam.<br />
John Howard made his position clear a few years ago.<br />
Dr Hewson is firmly on the record since his extraordinary<br />
outburst at the State Conference of the Liberal Party of<br />
Western Australia on July 25 this year.<br />
He said then that multiculturalism was " absolutely a<br />
fundamental mistake in this country."<br />
He said: " We are a multicultural society yes. But we<br />
should never have multlculturalisrm." In his view<br />
multiculturaliem amounts to nothing more then the<br />
" elevation" of people he describes as " a few professional<br />
ethnics..." This is Dr Mewson's view of one of Australia's great social<br />
achievements a peaceful and cohesive multicultural<br />
society. It reflects his loathing not only of the goals of fairness<br />
and equity at the centre of multicultural policy, but his<br />
deep disdain for ethnic community leeders. </p>
<p>2<br />
In a world torn * part by ethnic divioions it seems<br />
extraordinary to mount such an attack on what is surely an<br />
enviable hustgalian evooees.<br />
I note that the Oppoestion's official spokesman on<br />
Immigrrtion matters, Mr RuddocX, is trying now to<br />
reconstruct Dr Hewsur'e remarks to make them more socially<br />
p'tlatable. The fact le that with Dr Hewson dealding multiculturalism,<br />
despite Its manifest BCi1 and economic advaitages, and Mr<br />
Howard weighing In with hMv own obsessive and regressive<br />
views on immigraLion, Mr RuCOock has nowhere to turn.<br />
Australians should be Aware of the threat to the harmony and<br />
cohesion of their avuiety in the attitudes Of Dr Hewson and<br />
Mr loward.<br />
SYDNEY August, 1992 </p>
