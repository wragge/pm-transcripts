PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSIOP, MANUKA OVAL, 12 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
1: Do we have a chance against the Windics side?<br />
PM: You've always got to back the local side. It's going to be a fast wicket, I think, it<br />
was wet overnight. So it will be interesting to see which way the coin falls.<br />
1: Mr Keating, Dr Hcwson has called for a review of violence in TV news services,<br />
do you think that's necessary?<br />
PM: He'll scramble onto anything these days. If he is genuine about wanting to do<br />
something about these things, that's fine. I've never heard the Opposition talk<br />
about this in the past but I'm glad they are now. But let's again, talk about it<br />
sensibly with the people who actually run the system rather than getting all<br />
legislative. Dr lewson is always feeling a Bill coming on, he always wants to<br />
legislate. He is a bit like Mr Kennett, he thinks he should govern in the middle of<br />
the night in Parliament House.<br />
J: Are you concerned about violence on the news as well, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I said my piece yesterday about violence and censorship.<br />
ends. </p>
