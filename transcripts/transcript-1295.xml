PRIME MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST AS:<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIIE MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT,<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN 105 FIELD BATTERY AT BIEN HOA,<br />
VIET NAM 23RD APRIL, 1966<br />
Major, Gentlemen I have had an , pnortunity today to see our own<br />
Australian servino men on the spot and I'am very lad to be<br />
able to brin, to you not merely the good wishes o? your fellow<br />
countrymen, ut the pride we feel in the reputation ou've<br />
built for Australia by your service in this area of the world.<br />
We regard this as a critical battle area. We regard<br />
the issues for which you are fighting as amongst the most<br />
important that any group of countries could fight for in this<br />
day and generation. This is literally in our jud-ment one of the great<br />
critical battle areas for the forces of freedom in the world<br />
today, and Australia has madea valuable contribution.<br />
Although our numbers have been small the assistance to morale,<br />
the actual achievements in the operations of war in which you<br />
have been engaged have been greatly appreciated by the people<br />
and government of South Viet lam and certainly they have been<br />
greatly valued by our Allies of the United States and of the<br />
other Torces who are fighting in this area of the world.<br />
I came here knowing that you had built up in the<br />
infantry and the artillery a splendid reputation, but I can<br />
assure you that the comments made to me by the Prime Minister,<br />
by the Head of State, by the Head of the American forces, have<br />
all confirmed the high reputation which we had gathered you had<br />
established for yourselves here. You ha, e served with<br />
distinction to yourselves and, of course for pride in your<br />
own country. ; ie think of this area as one in which not only is a<br />
' battle to be fought and win for the freedom of the people who<br />
are wanting to live out their own lives in peace, but here is<br />
an opportunity in this part of the world, through the civic<br />
jobs that you have been carrying out, to establish that the<br />
age-old enemies of mankind can be conquered. And this is perhaps<br />
the most rewardin6 tart of your duties, other than those in the<br />
actual military operations themselves.<br />
I am going to s-ay a fe.' '.' ords to you on Anzac Day<br />
so I ,. on't give you too much of a uash here this afternoon but<br />
although I -' as a very poor gunner for a few months in the A. I. F.<br />
myself, I think recognise a good regiment of artillery<br />
when 1 see one and I conrratulate you. Maaor Tedder, and all<br />
your men, on a first-class artillery oattery representing<br />
Australia in South Viet Nam.<br />
I know how much you are all lookin.' forward to getting<br />
back to Australia. You y'il find a wonudrfuT welcome for you<br />
on your return and until then good fortune in your operations<br />
and a happy journey on your way home. </p>
