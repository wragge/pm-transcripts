January 1973<br />
DEATH OF THE HON. W. J. RIORDAN<br />
We have all been greatly saddened to learn of the death<br />
of Bill Riordan, one of the few surviving members of the Chifley<br />
Government. He was a staunch friend and a profoundly loyal Labor man.<br />
He maintained a remarkable hold on the loyalty of his<br />
electorate of Kennedy ( North Queensland) which was undeviatingly<br />
a Labor stronghold until his retirement.<br />
Arrangements are being made for a State funeral.<br />
