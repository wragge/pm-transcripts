    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It’s good to be here in Jakarta today. John Howard attended the inauguration of President Yudhoyono ten years ago and it’s fitting that I should be here to attend the inauguration of President Widodo today.</p>
<p>Our relations with Indonesia are very important. This relationship matters. It’s a strong relationship. The challenge is to make it stronger in the future than it has been in the past and I’m very confident that that can be the case under the new President.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, Jokowi has publicly stated his willingness and he’s possibly the most likely Indonesian President to cement Indonesian-Australian relations. How do you see him?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I’m very encouraged by everything that President Jokowi has said up until now – I really am encouraged. He’s obviously a charismatic and inspirational figure.</p>
<p>I think there’s a wave of confidence and renewal sweeping Indonesia right now and I’m looking forward to Australia’s opportunities to take part in the renewal and the reinvigoration of this important neighbour and partner.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
