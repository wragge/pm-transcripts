I D<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AGRIBUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND,<br />
ORANGE, 20 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
Let me begin with a story about a fish tuna to be more specific, Australian<br />
Southern Bluefin Tuna. Beautiful food especially raw.<br />
At the bottom end of the market the canned fish end tuna fetches about $ 2<br />
a kilogram. At the top end at the sashimi end in Japan the price is around<br />
a kilogram.<br />
In the last three or four years the quota for Southern Bluefin Tuna available to<br />
the Australian industry reduced by around 70 per cent. But in the same<br />
period the value of our exports has risen dramatically.<br />
The difference is tuna farming. In 1991-92 the industry was worth $ 1.8<br />
million. Today it is worth around $ 50 million.<br />
By 2000, it may be worth around $ 200 million.<br />
Tuna farmers in South Australia have become business people. They are no<br />
longer hunting and selling a declining resource for low value uses.<br />
They now harvest the tuna for sale in Japanese sashimi markets 4 days later.<br />
They have invested in a culture of scienoe and husbandry, markets and<br />
distribution. And they are succeeding in a highly competitive market.<br />
The lesson of South Australian tuna farming is being learnt around the<br />
country. In Western Australia they are about to begin a trial tuna farm. In<br />
South Australia they are investigating the possibility of applying the same<br />
principles to rock lobsters.<br />
I am sure the lessons will not be lost on this audience.<br />
We don't need to restrict ourselves to fish. </p>
<p>The Australian dairy industry tells a similar tale. The number of dairy cows in<br />
Australia has declined by 10 per cent in the past decade and the number of<br />
dairy farms by 30 per cent.<br />
But the gross value of dairy production has doubled in money terms and the<br />
value of exports has more than trebled. We now export over 40 per cent of<br />
our annual milk production and over half of our manufactured products.<br />
In both these industries the potential to grow is almost unlimited. But doing<br />
so will require not just maintenance of their present levels of energy,<br />
efficiency and enterprise it will need constant improvement.<br />
And responsibility of course will not lie with the industry alone. It will require<br />
improvements in the way we do things right across the nation.<br />
I think this is the point that Reg C lairs; is making when he says we have to<br />
shift the emphasis from the principle of screwing the cheapest price out of the<br />
supplier into one of working together from the bottom up to satisfy the end<br />
customer. I know Reg Clairs has a passionate belief in the potential of our food industry.<br />
I know he believes that what has been done in tuna farming and dairy farming<br />
can be done right across Australian agriculture and horticulture. And I know<br />
he believes in it at least in part because he has pulled off something of a<br />
revolution in food with Woolworths. He knows from personal experience that<br />
radical change is not only necessary but possible.<br />
I have had some experience of change making in the past decade or so.<br />
Anyone who has experienced change has also experienced resistance. Half<br />
the problem is fear or a lack of confidence the innate side of conservatism.<br />
You can't change that in people and it is pointless to try.<br />
But what we can do is make people understand. In the end what drives<br />
change is recognition of necessity and opportunity. Necessity pushes it<br />
along and opportunity pulls it, if you like-<br />
And once it gets going the confidence comes. Change breeds change and<br />
success breeds success.<br />
This is where government and management have their principal roles. First,<br />
to recognise what has to be done, second to create the environment in which<br />
others will begin to recognise it. In a sense, it's our job to start the chain<br />
reaction. I could give you two obvious examples from the past decade. </p>
<p>Take the Accord. The Accord has changed the culture of work and<br />
productivity in Australia and in turn it helped to change the culture of inflation.<br />
It has quite dramatically changed the country.<br />
A second example would be the Landcare movement. Landcare has<br />
changed the farming culture as the Accord has changed the industrial<br />
relations culture.<br />
And with the change in the culture new horizons constantly emerge.<br />
I have to say that I share the view of Reg Clairs.<br />
The fact is that food should be Australia's long suit.<br />
We have the land, the skills, the scientific base and 120,000 farmers<br />
determined to succeed.<br />
And we have the markets as never before we have the markets.<br />
I was in Indonesia earlier this week talking to President Soeharto about our<br />
relationship with that country of 180 million people, and about the next steps<br />
to be taken in the development of APEC.<br />
The trade prospects for both the bilateral relationship and our relationship<br />
with the region are simply immense. And the prospects for food exports are<br />
second to none. The total food market in the Asian region is estimated at<br />
almost $ 900 billion, and food imports are growing at a consistent average of<br />
12 per cent per annum.<br />
For all that, it is not easy to get a foothold in these highly competitive<br />
markets. It requires work, dedication, skill and adaptability. It requires the willingness<br />
to embrace change as well as the capacity to do it. And I think we are seeing<br />
that capacity and willingness in modem Australian farmers.<br />
And as the dairy and seafood and man~-ther industries demonstrate, when<br />
these markets are cracked there are huge rewards.<br />
The Government has been working with industry to see how we can best<br />
position ourselves. We have been looking at new products and new<br />
production methods.<br />
We have found, for instance, that the potential is not only in those goods we<br />
currently produce. There are all sorts of Asian food items, such as soya<br />
products and specialist vegetables, which we can produce and sell both into<br />
Asian and our own domestic markets. </p>
<p>Sakata Rice Snacks for example is establishing a rice cracker business<br />
manufacturing plant in Victoria with the support of the Government's<br />
Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program. We currently import all our rice<br />
cracker requirements. This operation will not only play a significant import<br />
replacement role but also see export markets developed in Asia.<br />
At present, our imports of Asian food items are adding about $ 800 million a<br />
year to our trade deficit.<br />
We have also found that the companies which do best are those who<br />
establish networks with Asian partners and maintain a strong physical<br />
presence in their target countries.<br />
We have found that success depends on a strategic view a long view.<br />
And, of course, it depends on quality and reliability of supply.<br />
It means delivering the right product to the right place at the right time.<br />
That creates a major challenge for our freight system particularly air freight.<br />
At present air freight is the poor cousin a very poor cousin to the<br />
passenger trade. Ninety per cent of our air freight leaves on passenger<br />
planes which means that flight times and capacities are designed to meet<br />
the passenger needs, not the needs of our food customers.<br />
Our distribution systems on the ground are also underdeveloped and will<br />
have to be improved.<br />
Those tuna would arrive sooner and in better condition if they could go<br />
direct. And I'm pleased to say that the industry and the Government are<br />
working on the problems.<br />
As you probably know, a number of groups in the community as well as<br />
government bodies including the Agrifood Council, have been working on<br />
how we might improve our transport links and air freight system particularly<br />
how we might improve our capacity to mneet our aspirations for exports of<br />
perishable and time sensitive goods.<br />
To build on these initiatives, I have asked my colleagues, Laurie Brereton<br />
and Bob Collins, to look at the state of our infrastructure, and our distribution<br />
system and the world air freight business and deliver an action plan by the<br />
end of November.<br />
Freight is one of many problems we have to overcome. And we will. </p>
<p>To give you a non-farm example. IBM's operation at Wangaratta is getting an<br />
increasing share of the Japanese market because it is able to supply<br />
Japanese customers more rapidly and reliably than any of its competitors<br />
around the world including the USA, Germany and Sweden.<br />
The average import cycle time for all its products from Australia is just 2 1/ 2<br />
days. The Wangaratta plant has become super efficient by improving the<br />
coordination between each link in the chain and with no increase in freight or<br />
handling costs.<br />
There is surely no reason why we cannot have similarly well coordinated<br />
systems for all our time sensitive exports.<br />
I don't think there is much I can tell this audience about either the problems or<br />
the possibilities for food production and export.<br />
But I would like to repeat what I said up in Roma a month or so ago. That is,<br />
we do need as an industry and as a nation to commit ourselves to sustainable<br />
practices. On that same trip that ended in Indonesia, I visited Papua New Guinea and<br />
talked to our partners in the South Pacific Forum. Some of these countries<br />
are losing their forests to logging at a rate which is tragic and scandalous.<br />
The Solomon Islands, for instance, will have no forests left to log by 2003.<br />
Yet in condemning the activities of unscrupulous timber companies in other<br />
countries, we cannot ignore what has happened and is still happening here in<br />
Australia. On the way to Papua New Guinea we flew up the Darling River, and the<br />
evidence of devastation through bad land management practices is<br />
frightening. We simply have to turn this around. Whatever we do in our food industry, in<br />
future it will have to be done in a way that is sustainable.<br />
We need to grow a food industry which is sensitive to the environment more<br />
than that, which restores and rebuilds it.<br />
That is the only kind of food industry worth passing on to our children.<br />
It is also the only one which can guarantee that the ranks of our 120,000<br />
farming families and the communities which depend upon them are not<br />
decimated over the next 10 or 20 years. </p>
<p>Sustainable agriculture is also the best way to get maximum returns on what<br />
we grow. It is in the end the only path to premium products and premium<br />
prices. Let me dwell for a second on those farming families. They are a great<br />
national resource they contribute not only to the national product but to the<br />
national character and spirit. We have to keep them on the land and it<br />
follows that the land they farm must be able to sustain the use they make of<br />
it. I know that the Landcare movement has produced something like a revolution<br />
among Australian farmers. It has tapped their passion for the land itself and<br />
created a much more favourable environment for further necessary change.<br />
I include in that a greater willingness to look on farming as a business and as<br />
a science. From there it is a much shorter leap to becoming more adaptable,<br />
more efficient and more capable of adopting a long-term strategic view.<br />
And perhaps the lesson to learn from this is that when you start thinking<br />
about sustainable agriculture, you start thinking more clearly about the<br />
industry itself. In other words, when we start recognising the environmental<br />
necessities we begin to more generally recognise the commercial<br />
necessities.<br />
A more scientific or sustainable approach has implications for quality and<br />
efficiency. It therefore has implications for exports, as well as implications for<br />
the long-term future of farming communities and families.<br />
The point I want to make is that we have a lot more in our favour than just the<br />
land and the markets, and we have done a lot more in recent times than<br />
perhaps we give ourselves credit for.<br />
I mentioned Landcare, but there is more than that. Earlier this year I set up<br />
the Land Management Taskforce and they will be reporting to me in the next<br />
few weeks. The taskforce recognises that sustainable agriculture dependent<br />
on the ability of those 120,000 farmers to manage in a complex natural and<br />
commercial environment.<br />
I also mentioned the work I have asked Laurie Brereton and Bob Collins to do<br />
on freight, but I could give you a very long list of things already done of<br />
hundreds of millions of dollars spent on aviation infrastructure since One<br />
Nation was introduced in 1992.<br />
Equally, we could talk about the money the Government is spending on<br />
research and development or on efforts to combat salinity, or on road and<br />
rail, or on the environment of the Murray Darling, or in the past 12 months on<br />
drought relief. </p>
<p>For all the hardship it has dealt to farmers and all the cost to the nation, the<br />
drought itself has constituted a considerable extension of the learning curve.<br />
It has forced upon us with new intensity the recognition that we must do more<br />
to drought proof our farming land.<br />
There have been huge changes, not least among them, I think, changes in<br />
the relationship between the Government and farmers and the industry itself.<br />
The greatest changes of all, of course, have been the structural reforms that<br />
have affected all areas of the economy.<br />
Those deregulatory reforms of the 80s did more to overcome the perennial<br />
structural problems of Australian agriculture than anything else we will ever<br />
do. Floating the dollar delivered the biggest increase in competitiveness we have<br />
ever achieved in Australia. Dismantling the tariff wall greatly reduced the<br />
burden on our internationally competitive industries. The Accord meant that<br />
the depreciation in the exchange rate did not simply translate into higher<br />
wages but rather into a permanent increase in our competitiveness; and it<br />
has meant greater productivity, flexibility and industrial harmony than<br />
Australia has had since the end of World War 11.<br />
And to these reforms must be added APEC and the GATT the benefits to<br />
flow to Australia's agricultural industry from the Bogor Declaration and the<br />
Uruguay Round will be beyond measure.<br />
Reciting these initiatives is not a way of saying that all that can or should be<br />
done has been done.<br />
As I have said more times than I can count, the process of reform never<br />
stops. But reminding ourselves of how far we have come does have a worthwhile<br />
purpose. It does or at least it should give us the confidence to meet the<br />
new challenges and embrace new aspirations.<br />
And when I say that is precisely what I mean. Governments can always<br />
give a lead, they can always do more to get the environment right, they can<br />
lend a helping hand in the market places of the world or on the farms<br />
themselves when disaster like the recent drought strikes.<br />
Governments can joint venture in reality and metaphorically at all sorts of<br />
levels. But I think what we have to do from now on in the food industry is<br />
recognise that the chain which ends on the dining tables of Taipei and Tokyo<br />
begins with the land itself. It begins with Australian soil and water. And<br />
everyone engaged in our agricultural industry needs to understand that. </p>
<p>We need to recognise that everyone engaged in the industry from the<br />
farmers to the distribution networks, the packagers, the transport companies,<br />
the banks, the funds, the trade officials, the manufacturing companies, the<br />
regional authorities, the CSIRO, all tiers of government and all tiers of the<br />
industry needs to work in accord with each other and with a sense of<br />
common purpose.<br />
That means a shared ethic of efficiency and excellence, a shared<br />
commitment to sustainability and though I am sometimes suspicious of<br />
people who habitually use the word a shared " vision".<br />
Earlier this week we all read about the World Bank's calculation that<br />
Australians were the richest people in the world. I happen to think that in<br />
many ways we are but of course there are more important things to be read<br />
into their calculation than that assessment.<br />
The ratio of resources to population in Australia has always made us<br />
relatively rich and quite properly encouraged us to believe that our potential<br />
for development is virtually unlimited.<br />
But there have been, as they say, certain downsides. We could start with the<br />
current account deficit.<br />
Our resource richness was bound to make us a large importer of capital.<br />
It was also inclined to make us at times complacent. Remember the<br />
" resources boom" that was going to carry us on a wave into eternal prosperity<br />
-without an efficient manufacturing industry, without downstream processing,<br />
without working as hard as we have in recent years to get into new markets<br />
and shape the world trading environment.<br />
And the same resource richness made us wasteful and destructive with the<br />
environment. We all know that this cannot go on any more. And not only the agricultural<br />
industry knows it.<br />
A fortnight ago I opened the McArthur River zinc and lead mine in the<br />
Northern Territory. It is a model of a new age of mining in Australia. It takes<br />
considerate and intelligent account of Aboriginal interests and Aboriginal<br />
rights under the new Native Title regime.<br />
It also takes account of the fragile and precious environment. Mount Isa<br />
Mines has gone to great lengths to protect this environment.<br />
And the McArthur River mine will earn in the region of $ 300 million a year for<br />
the next 20 to 30 years. </p>
<p>What is happening in mining, we can do in our forestry and fibre industries.<br />
We must do it. In these industries and in agriculture necessity is now driving<br />
us.<br />
This is a conference of experts and interested parties. It is a conference of<br />
the players in the agribusiness game. And I don't want to tell any of you<br />
things you already know.<br />
But I do want to reaffirm that as a government we are very conscious of our<br />
role and responsibilities in this industry particularly our responsibilities<br />
towards the natural environment of this continent and the prosperity and well<br />
being of future generations who will inherit it from us.<br />
For that reason, as we see it, there is no more important business in Australia<br />
than agribusiness.<br />
And we also take the view that there is no business with more potential<br />
potential for doing good for Australia and good for the environment. For that<br />
matter good for the world.<br />
Let me conclude by reiterating that we should be proud of what we are doing<br />
with tuna or dairy or, in fact, parts of most agricultural industries. But the<br />
changes as a whole are coming too slowly. We must find a faster path to<br />
sustainable agriculture, and become a global supplier of food.<br />
In the very near future I will be inviting some key players to a meeting to<br />
discuss how we can best set the ball rolling.<br />
The essential thing is that the private sector the farmers, the processors, the<br />
retailers, the distributors, the banks and funds drives this process.<br />
And it must be driven with a long-term view, with an environmental as well as<br />
a commercial strategy and with a determination that the industry delivers<br />
benefits right across the Australian community.<br />
I have absolutely no doubt that it can be done.<br />
The trouble with visions is that they are readily translated into mirages the<br />
horizon keeps receding and the exploring party develops the habit of<br />
stopping too often for a drink.<br />
So let's make it perhaps earlier than 2020, and get started on it straight away.<br />
Thank you for inviting me to speak at this conference. </p>
<p>It has been a very important meeting. If in 10 or 15 years' time we are<br />
applying to all the things we grow in Australia the same principles as they are<br />
applying to tuna in South Australia the principles of conservation and<br />
sustainability, premium product and rapid and reliable delivery it may yet<br />
prove to be an historic one.<br />
I sincerely hope so. </p>
