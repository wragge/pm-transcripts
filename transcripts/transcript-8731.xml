TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE lION PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON DR C LAWRENCE, MLA,<br />
PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, " INTO ASIA" TRA. DE AND<br />
INVESTMENT CONFERENCE, PERTH, 17 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I think it is a timely and very important thing for Western Australia to bc doing.<br />
I had the privilege of meeting the Deputy Premier earlier this year when I was<br />
invited to open the Western Australian representative office and that continuity of<br />
interest in South-East Asia, Indonesia in particular, is I think a tremendously good<br />
thing for Western Australia to be doing and Setting this focus on -Australia's trade<br />
relations with the Asia-Pacific in a conference that is widely attended and I am<br />
very pleased to be part of it.<br />
The other reason that the Premier and I are talking to you is to both remind young<br />
people of thc offer which was constructed by the Commonwealth and the State at<br />
the Youth Summit in the middle of the year to take up employment opportunities<br />
for young people and now Treasurer John Dawkins announced the other day a set<br />
of arrangements whereby we can group labour market programs for larger<br />
employers and some employers have indicated they'll take up 1000 or 2000<br />
-younger people as a group, so we've put the labour market programs together and<br />
virtually packaged them as group programs even though there is a menu of<br />
programs within each package. So there is the prospect for up to 100,000 young<br />
pecople of six months training through an accredited TAFE course and then a<br />
labour market program via a wage subsidy at the end of the six months so that<br />
those young people can enhance their prospects of securing employment.<br />
These things are funded, they are on offer, we've now made their adoption and<br />
adaptation easier through the changes announced by John Dawkins last week and<br />
there is at least the prospect of more than 10,000 yourg West Australians being<br />
able to avail themselves of these opportunities. We thought this was a good<br />
opportunity to just restate that and to say that we've made now the adoption of this<br />
menu of labour market programs far more practical for larger employers who are </p>
<p>likely to take 300, 500, 1000, 2000 rather than doing each one individually as a<br />
single stream which is slow and more cumbersome and is not going to have the<br />
desired effect of taking thosc young people 15 to 19 up and giving them a job<br />
where they have either dropped out of school or gone into the labour market and<br />
found they couldn't get a job. I'll leave my remarks at that, I'm not certain whether<br />
the Premier might want to say something to you.<br />
CL Thanks Paul. First of all welcome to Western Australia and we are delighted that<br />
you did take part in out ' Into Asia" Convention. because as you said it is very<br />
important for us, particularly given our proximity to the region to be the driving<br />
force, the leading edge in the Australian economy. Many of our companies are<br />
now moving very successfully in south-east Asia, particularly Indonesia and I'll be<br />
meeting today with the Governor of East Java as part of cementing the relationship<br />
we have there. This is all about trade, investment, employment so it's timely we are<br />
talking about the medium to long term improvements that wc expect in our<br />
economy as we are talking about an offer to young people and I'm delighted that we<br />
are jointly urging employers and the youth in Western Australia to take advantage<br />
of the opportunities in labour market programs in training and in employment<br />
opportunities. As the Prime Minister has said in the past some of these programs<br />
we rather difficult for employers to get access to, they didn't necessarily suit the<br />
variety of nccds that they had in a simple and we've certainly been urging through<br />
our projects for youth that that link between the employer needs and the young<br />
people in need of training and employment in the community be strengthened and<br />
made simpler. So this is very much the spirit of this announcement and the 12,000<br />
or so young people in Western Australia looking for employment I'm sure, will be<br />
pleasd as they are informed, better able to take part in this program as the<br />
economy improves and those longer term prospects which we believe are very<br />
substantially in Australia are realised.<br />
PM: Thank you Carmen, we might just now invite questions.<br />
J: Prime Minister, getting back to the main issue which is the future, it appears that<br />
President Soeharto may be visiting Australia next year. Are you confident that<br />
such a visit could be conducted without any embarrassment or security problems..<br />
PM: Some people do have strong feelings about it, they have legitimate feclings about it,<br />
but that does not nullify the basis of friendship and the neighbourly association<br />
which Australia and Indonesia share with one another and I would be very<br />
disappointed to thinkc that the Indonesian President what's implied by your<br />
question I think that the Indonesian President may be persuaded from visiting<br />
Australia because of the prospect of somebody expressing themselves against him.<br />
I said today and I will repeat for you that one of the most stratcgically important<br />
things that happened to Australia in the post-War years was the clection of<br />
President Soeharto's new order government. It's brought to this region exceptional<br />
stability, peace, the government has held together the vast Indonesian archipelago<br />
and from that very benign climate we've been able to get on with our lives in </p>
<p>Australia and develop ourselves without having a strategic problem overhanging<br />
us. I said this in April and I thought it was time that that was said arnd we<br />
recognised the truth of our strategic relations and associations with Indonesia not<br />
with standing thc fact that we've had disagreements about Timor. So I should very<br />
much like to see President Soeharto visit Australia and I can onl-y say that the work<br />
the Premier is doing with the Governor of East Java who is himself a significant<br />
person in the leadership of Indonesia, if anything smooths the way for a<br />
Presidential visit at some point in the future.<br />
J: Prime Minister, some of the latest polls I understand show a lack of support for the<br />
OST, is this something that didn't surprise your shift..<br />
PM: No, I just say how discerning people are, that's the point I'd make about that<br />
because this is a shift of course, in the strategic discussion in Indonesia, but the<br />
GST is nothing more than a crude tax switch crude by virtue of the fact that the<br />
people paying the tax will not get the benefits of it. That is, they will bc grossly<br />
under compensated and it's therefore inequitable and unfair as well as being<br />
inflationary and given the fact that we've now got the second lowest tax-to-GDP<br />
in the OECD group of nations and have got a relatively small public sector, it<br />
seems to me we just don't need a new base in consumption, in expenditure, in the<br />
tax system, that our direct side income tax system is working very, very nicely it<br />
is very light, we've got good tax administration, we brought the marginal rates of<br />
tax down, the overall tax-to-GDP is low. Why do we need another tax base and<br />
why do we need it when it's going to blow our inflation rate to pieces, but<br />
particularly put a very big burden on families, all Australians, and change the way<br />
in which this country really functions. It would lead to a change in the way in<br />
which the Australian society works, it's a very large impost, it's over half the<br />
collection of the income tax, we collect $ 50 billion from the income tax, a GST<br />
raises $ 27 billion it's over half the income tax, not 15 per cent of the income tax,<br />
it's half the income tax and that's why it is so pernicious.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Because in those days, we didn't have a crude switch in mind and then the direct side tax<br />
system was haemnorrhaging to pieces. We had criminal evasion schemes of the late<br />
the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. We had no capital gains taxation, no taxation of<br />
fringe benefits, high effective marginal rates of tax which have been avoided. The<br />
taxation policy advice then was-look, this is almost incapable of repair. it's been left go<br />
so long by the Liberals, it's incapable of repair let's try and tax it where the people spend<br />
it. Now, when we couldn't guarantee the appropriate wage discounts to deal with the<br />
inflationary effect of a GST in the middle 80s, we abandoned it. We were not going to be<br />
in macro--economic vandalism to just push ahead with a proposal we knew would wreck<br />
the national inflation rate, so we abandoned it. But having abandoned it, I then spent the<br />
next 5 years developing a proper direct tax system taxing capital gains, taxing fringe<br />
benefits, tightening up all the loopholes. So, now we don't need a GST.<br />
J: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think the proof of the pudding is in the eating. We've given people the benefit of<br />
higher tax collections by lower rates of tax. The top rate of 60% cent is now 47%. The<br />
corporate rate was 49% it's now 39%. The bottom rate of tax when I became Treasurer<br />
was 30%, it's now 20%. So, you've got to say: why? What's happened to John Hcwson is<br />
he's come along a decde too late with this idea.<br />
The principle is still the same: taking from the poor and give to rich, as you say?<br />
PM: Well, that's not what we were proposing. We had over-compensat ions for all the<br />
categories of social security recipients and also for low to middle income taxpayers. in<br />
other words, we were putting the proceeds back by way of huge cuts in income tax. John<br />
Hewson's putting the proceeds to remove payroll tax and cut the price of petrol. In other<br />
words, it's a different group of beneficiaries from the people paying it.<br />
1: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, just a second. In the middle 80s, thc people paying it were also the beneficiaries.<br />
This is not true now. Under the Howson proposal, the people paying it<br />
J: buy petrol though when it comes to cars?<br />
PM: Well, that's the point: why worry about reducing the price of petrol when petrol -by world<br />
standards is already cheap?<br />
J: passed it in the Senate<br />
PM: Because if a political Party in this country campaigns on the nced for such a basic switch<br />
of the taxation system and the community supports that, open-eyed, understanding what<br />
the issues are, on what basis would any political grouping in the Senate refuse the passage<br />
of it?<br />
J The ruckus over your signing of a couple of $ 5 notes yesterday? Are we going to hear<br />
more of this?<br />
PM: Well, the silly season has got away to an early start.<br />
J: You don't think it might ? 7<br />
PM: I don't know. Look, everyone in the political system signs bank notes, they have for a long<br />
time. In fact, I appointed the two people who signed the notes.<br />
3: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I doubt it very much, Certainly, I had no intention whatsoever to deface a note, can I say,<br />
the person who asked rr but to enhance it by signing it as Prime Minister.<br />
1: So you're saying that's not defacing the note, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: No, I don't think It is. No, certainly not. </p>
<p>1: Do you expect to be prosecuted?<br />
PM: I shouldn't think not, no.<br />
Do you think its value is now worth more than $ 5.00?<br />
PM: Well, ask the owner.<br />
1: So, are you saying it's okay for thc Prime Minister to sign?<br />
PM: Oh, come on. You've got more to talk about than signing hank notes, haven't you?<br />
J: Prime Minister, how effective is Austrade in the push for developing markets in Asia,<br />
bearing in mind that they're not even rcp~ resecnted at this Conference?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think onc can conclude, as important as this Conference is, that whether<br />
Austrade is a participant or a sponsor, invalidates its work. Austrade, I[ think, has been a<br />
very profound administrative and structural change to Australia's trade initiatives. From<br />
the old Trade Commissioner service of the ' 70s to something which is now really going<br />
out there trying to identify opportunities, and put companies together, and really do very<br />
good things. I have only heard praise for Austrade abroad. The last time which was my<br />
recent visit to Japan where we've opened four Consulates this year. One was in Nagoya,<br />
where Austrade was involved. I'd just say that Australia's presence abroad is cnhanced by<br />
Austrade's initiatives.<br />
J: Premier Lawrence, with the election ruled out for this year, do you have preference on who<br />
would go first Federally or State ncxt year?<br />
CL: Well, I think both of us agree that the timing of the election State or Federally are a matter<br />
for each sphere of Government, and for the Party, and we'll make-the decision on it. I<br />
certainly will at the time that it's appropriate for Western Australia, which as I've said,<br />
for those of you who are not usually members of this audience, is sometime in the first<br />
quarter of 1993.<br />
J: Would you be guiding the preference of the Prime Minister?<br />
CL: No.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
CL: Not in the sense of us going first, or the Federal Government going first. It's always been<br />
clear that it's a matter for each sphere of Government to decide.<br />
J: Prime Minister, John Ralph has suggested there maybe another drop in interest rates in<br />
relation to poor demand? Can you shed any more light on that?<br />
PM: No. I was in Queensland yesterday, I didn't hear what John had to say about that at all, but<br />
the stance of monetary policy hasn't changed. What has been governing our monetary<br />
policy of late is the underlying ThflatLnjrate,_ but that has come down. Although, what's </p>
<p>called the underlying rate itself, is a little higher than the statistical rate, and I think that's<br />
what a lot of people in the market look at. So, unless that dramatically changed, I don't see<br />
a change in the stance of monetary policy.<br />
Premier, will you be inviting the Prime Minister to he a part of the State elcction<br />
campaign?<br />
CL: Well, the Prime Minister is here in Western Australia now at our invitation because we<br />
think it is very important that particularly in areas such as trade and investment and a<br />
thrust into Asia that he gives his endorsement, something he already has to such an<br />
important initiative. As far as I'm concerned the Federal Government has very important<br />
matters to put before the people of Western Australia. They'll obviously do so at a time<br />
that suits them, but certainly there is no suggestion that we wouldn't want to hear the<br />
Federal Government's proposals on taxation, for instance as opposed to the GST on<br />
industrial relations as opposed to the very firm endorscment that Mr Hewson has given last<br />
night of the Kennett regime in Victoria. We think it's important that Western Australians<br />
understand that, and we're certainly keen for the Prime Minister and other Ministers to get<br />
that message across to Western Australians contemplating voting in the Fedcral election<br />
and the State election.<br />
J: So, is that a yes or a no?<br />
CL I think it's a very clear yes, isn't it?<br />
J: Mr Kennctt's actions, and the endorsement federally<br />
PM: Mr Kennett? Lo~ ok, rye got no doubt that Dr Hewson has let's, put it this way -that NU<br />
Kennett is doing what Mr Howard said he was doing, and that was giving us an early run<br />
on the Coalition's policy. And for a couple of weeks, the Federal Liberals Dr Hewson<br />
and Mr Howard were dissembling, shuffling, moving backwards, moving away from Mr<br />
Kennett. But now they've decided that's impossible, they may as well embrace it. Well,<br />
they were always embracing it, and I think what we do see in Victoria is what you'll see in<br />
Australia under a Coalition that is, that the whole notion of cooperative wage<br />
bargaining, of searching for productivity by more clever, the more clever management of<br />
businesses and their operation, will be swept away in legislation changes, where wages<br />
and conditions of employment are basically knocked over by legislation. That is, the<br />
award system is taken away, there is no legal protection for employees, only the protection<br />
of the common law, which to all intents and purposes, most ordinary people can't avail<br />
themselves of, they can't hire Q. Cs. T7here is no point in sitting in a lift for 2 years waiting<br />
to have your case heard when the proper industrial tribunal of this ' Country the unique<br />
industrial tribunal of this country have been abandoned. So, at least, as the Premier said,<br />
whenever elections are held in this country at least we now know with the Liberals what<br />
they stand for. That means higher taxes and lower wages. Higher taxes through a<br />
consumption tax and lower wages through reductions of rates of pay and conditions of<br />
employment. We're seeing yesterday Dr Hewson simply confirming that point.<br />
J: Last week we recorded an increase in unemployment to 11.6%. Do you think that strange<br />
to believe your claim that the recession is over? </p>
<p>PM: Well, there was also quite strong emnployment growth for the month 26,000, the<br />
economy is growing. So no economy that is growing is in recession, but we're still living<br />
with the effects of rccession, and part of thc cffect is, of course, higher productivity which<br />
means more output for fewer people. We're living through a surge in productivity, that is,<br />
companies have stripped down to be more efficient. But in being more efficient they're<br />
getting the same output or more output but with fewer people. So it means that this stage<br />
in the cycle when we would be expecting the growth coming through to be reflected in the<br />
employment growth -it's not being fully reflected in the employment growth because<br />
we're living through a particularly high bout of productivity. But as the growth continues,<br />
obviously the employment will be taken up, but it's going to he taken up later rather than<br />
earlier.<br />
J: But when it comes to voters, they don't understand that. They only know they haven't got<br />
a job?<br />
PM: No, no. That's true, I understand that. But let's at least make the messatge clear. The<br />
economy is clearly in a recovery phase and the positive employment growth the 26,000<br />
who got jobs last month know that, even though we are not keeping up with workforce<br />
growth. Thiat is, workforce growth is ahead of employment growth and therefore<br />
unemployment has risen. We have very high participation rates, very high, and that's<br />
because peoplc have reasonably after the 80s experience come to expect that after the<br />
huge job growth of the 80s you could go looking for a job and find one.<br />
I: those problems outstripping your solutions?<br />
PM: No, well. Well, I wouldn't be too pessimistic about Australia's prospects. We're now<br />
growing faster than any other comparable OECD economy, we've got fiscal policy, in an<br />
expansionary phase, we've got low interest rates. Our colleagues in the Opposition want<br />
to cut $ 7 billion out of the deficit that's nearly 2% of GDP which will just push us<br />
straight back into a recession. And they want to put a 15% tax on everything we consume.<br />
As other commentators have made clear this week, most notably Ross Gittins yesterday in<br />
The Sydney Morning Herald, this could be nothing but contractionary, nothing but<br />
contractionary. So there's a very clear offer on the part of a very clear differentiation on<br />
the part of the Parties. We're saying, let's expand fiscal policy and have low interest rates<br />
to promote a recovery. Dr Hcwson is saying let's contract fiscal policy and see interest<br />
rates rise as the labour market, as industrial relations changes. I'm saying the Federal<br />
Liberal solution is no solution to a recovery, the only prospect of a recovery in this country<br />
is with the Labor Party, with the Government.<br />
J: Can the export incentives your Goverrnment provides further the export growth that we<br />
need?<br />
PM: Well, we've just had a very large depreciation of the exchange rate. The Premier and I<br />
were just talking about it earlier. We're now down 20-odd percent against the Yen, I think<br />
we're about 20% against the Deutschemark. On the trade weight, if my memory serves me<br />
correctly about 12% or 13%. This is a large depreciation which will be very promot-Nig of<br />
Australian product.<br />
1: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: Well, I gave you the figures inside today. We're now exporting 23% of all we produce,<br />
nearly a quarter of everything that's produced in this country is now exported. in 1983 that<br />
wais 14%.<br />
J: But we do need to keep that sort of growth going?<br />
PM: We have to keep it growing and that's why I congratulate the Premier on this initiative.<br />
You see there's no better way of keeping it going than to keep opening up the market<br />
opportunities in the fastest growing part of the world and that's the Asia-Pacific. So if<br />
we can maximise those opportunities given the fact that we've already made the big jump<br />
to exports in thc 80s just imagine where we'd be now if we were exporting 9% of GDP<br />
less than we are? In other words if we were exporting what it was under Howard and<br />
Hewson in 1982/ 83 we'd be finished, absolutely done for, unable to pay for our imports,<br />
comatose. As it is now, we're now exporting nearly a quarter of everything that we<br />
produce, and it's rising. The fastest growing component of it is manufactured goods and<br />
services.<br />
3: pretty encouraging results in the polls here in the West. How big and turn things<br />
around though?<br />
PM: Well it's not explicable. It's not eaisy to explain how the same transmission of national<br />
issues is in some way not succeeding in Western Australia. I think it's to do with the<br />
predominance of State issues in the West Australian mecdia in the main. But again it's one<br />
of these things which time alone will cure.<br />
J: Well, would you have a personal preference<br />
PM: Oh well, you can't. When you ask silly leading questions, you get silly answers. I won't<br />
give you one because I can't be bothered.<br />
J: Do you concede though that you've got a pretty tough job ahead of you?<br />
PM: Yes, but in national terms we've got three out of foujLpo s putting us in front. No, three or<br />
four out of four putting us in front of the Coalition, and that's because I mean you've got<br />
to believe this: if you cut $ 7 billion out of the Commonwealth Budget deficit, the<br />
economy will go backwards. If you put a 15% GST on all food, clothing and services in<br />
the economy, the economy will go backwards. And if industrial relations blows thc wages<br />
system out of the water, inflation will rise and interest rates will rise with it and the<br />
economy will go backwards again. So, while the Liberals may lament their circumstances,<br />
their policy prescriptions will drive the economy back into recession. Now they rcjcct our<br />
policy prescription, but ours was endorsed by the OECD last week. The OECD secretariat<br />
was urging OECD member States to adopt an expansionary fiscal policy. They were<br />
urging that: to adopt an expansionary fiscal policy. Japan's just done it, we've done it, but<br />
the Federal Liberal Party says: oh no, no, what we've got to do is go back to Thatcherite<br />
policies and pre-Reagan and the rest. Go back to contractionary policies. Well I just say<br />
to Wr,. qcrn Australians, it's poison. If it happens, the economy will stay rececsscd, it will<br />
go back into recession.<br />
1: Given that WA was in the last Federal poll, would you be doing anything special over<br />
here? </p>
<p>PM:-Well, I'll be coming here routinely as I have been and taking the opportunities. No better<br />
or nicer one today than to be talking about WA's prospects. The great macroeconomic<br />
changes of the W~ s, the floating of the exchange rate, the competitiveness of the dollar, the<br />
low inflation, the lower interest rates, the lower unit labour costs are just bountiful for a<br />
State like WA which is selling into the world markcts with agriculture, principally<br />
agriculture, minerals and international services like tourism. In other words the whole<br />
macroeconomic policy is set up for the primary exporting States, so WA is going to pick<br />
up always that benefit of national policy.<br />
J: But do you think the voters here though are going to see a clear distinction between State<br />
and Federal issues?<br />
PM: I think the Premier is entitled to campaign on the policies which better relate to WA, in<br />
terms of those which are contained in the purview of the States, in the administration of<br />
the State, in relation to the community. And obviously there arc a different set of issucs<br />
than the Commonwealth issues.<br />
J: State health must bc a bit of a worry that they are lacking if you're so concerned about<br />
the Federal health budget?<br />
PM: Look, I don't think it's a worry. I think all State Ministers are naturally concerned about<br />
their area of responsibility. But our aim is to make Medicare more than a health insurance<br />
System, to make it a whole total health system. That is, to enhance public patient access<br />
for public hospitals.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
pm: Well, you did share a platform with the Commonwealth Minister for Health a few weeks<br />
earlier, and rm quite sure that in the arrangements that will be settled between the<br />
Commonwealth and the State of WA that WA will be advantaged. That advantage will<br />
flow most particularly to aii enhanced posicion for public patients in public hospitals and<br />
particularly for the aged who are worried about elective surgery and the need for it like<br />
hip replacements and the rest, without needing to carry the crippling burden of private<br />
insurance.<br />
J: Aren't you worried that WA will see you You tilk about the Coalition's economic<br />
poison when actually you've got a mouthful of your own?<br />
PM: Well, we've had<br />
CL: I want to know who writes his questions.<br />
PM: I know, he's a real charmer isn't hc? The thing is, obviously it's going to be a long way<br />
from here to the Canberra Press Gallery for you many stations alonS the way. Let me<br />
just make a couple of basic points for you. There were 6 million people in the workforce<br />
when I became Treasurcr, there's today nearly 8 million. So there's 2 million Australians,<br />
or just on 1.6 million Australians who have a job because of the policies of this<br />
Government. New Zealand, which we're often compared with particularly by our Federal<br />
colleagues, have fewer people in work today than they had in 1983. In other words the </p>
<p>workforce in New Zealand is smaller today than it was in 1983. Now, if one looks at it<br />
beyond employment, to look at thc thing that's hardest to provide to any country and that<br />
is a future, a solid future, this is what the Commonwealth and State Labor Governments<br />
together have done through the<br />
1: You're not worried about<br />
PM: Well, it's absurd, absurd. We're now in a position whcre the Premier can hold a conference<br />
in WA about trade with the Asia/ Pacific, Could you imagine that being held here in 1982?<br />
Would anyone have turned up? Would anyone have believed that the great growth<br />
prospects of Australian in the Asia/ Pacific area would have been as they are now? With<br />
nearly 25% of all we produce going to exports? Where the great primary exporting States<br />
have been preferred by national policy with tariff cuts, with a floating exchange rate, with<br />
a proper set of market mechanisms? They are the things that West Australians need to<br />
consider. If they need to consider their prospects in the 1990s and say: which Party has<br />
given them an opportunity to share in the Asia/ Pacific, to guarantee long employment and<br />
higher incomes it's only the Labor Party.<br />
J: Much of Australia 1 million unemployed?<br />
PM: Well, you're obviously in a contest with him. I'in not sure which one of you should win it.<br />
Well, the fact of the matter is to ask the 2 million who've got a job since 1983. Sure, I<br />
would very much like to see a higher level of employment. Remember this: the Federal<br />
Liberal Party left me as Treasurer in 1983 with 700,000 people out of work, 700,000. At<br />
Its lowest by the late 80s and early 90s, it got down to just ovcr 500,000. So we, in a<br />
structural sense, we've always had right through the last decide 500,000 people or more<br />
out of work. It's a matter of profound regret to me that another 400,000 to 500,000 have<br />
been added to that. It's a matter of pride to me that another 2 million or so have been<br />
added to the workforce. So, it's a case of we've always been dedicated to employment<br />
growth and we need to get back to it. But I remember press conferences here and<br />
elsewhere in the late 1980s and when I said: we've had 120,000 job growth this month,<br />
160,000 last month, 119,000 the month before -and you said: yeah, yeaih, yeah Treasurer,<br />
but what about the current account deficit and inflation? Well, no-one's now saying yeah,<br />
yeah, yeah about unemployment, and it's good you might. But you should have been<br />
consistently Interested in unemployment right through the 80s which most of you, of<br />
course, were not but the Government was. That's why there's that extra growth in the<br />
labour market. We remained interested in the whole matrix of policy: employment<br />
growth, the current account deficit, inflation all that's predicated on growing Australia as<br />
a mature economy. We're now doing Ithat via the sort of things the Premier is involved<br />
with today and yesterday: that is, really engaging with the Asia/ Pacific as we've never<br />
engaged before, where we have only paid lip service to our engagement with the area. We<br />
are now truly part of the area and taking part in the fastest growing region of the world.<br />
That's what's going to underpin higher incomes and higher employment. It's not going to<br />
be the notion of taxing your food and your clothing and believing that a change to payroll<br />
tax and petrol tax is going to re-macc Australia you would have to believe in fairies in<br />
the bottom of the garden to believe in that. ThIs is the only way of doing it the right way.<br />
