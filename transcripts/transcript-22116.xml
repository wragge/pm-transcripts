    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just on the Chief Justice's comments on manners. Are we not minding our manners enough?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I agree with him totally. I think we have seen a marked deterioration in good manners. I think it's time that the television networks put a curb on the increasing use of vulgarisms on television. I think there are certain expressions, there are certain vulgar expressions that have no place on television and if there's not some kind of self discipline exercised in relation to that, then I think standards will continue to deteriorate. I think the general observations made by the Chief Justice are right and I very warmly endorse what he said. I don't think we are polite enough to each other and good manners is the basis of a more civilised society. It's not a question of going back to any kind of class subservience, it's just a question of being polite and civil to each other and you can do that in a completely egalitarian manner and the idea of a polite egalitarian Australia is something that I think is very desirable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any other ways to solve it other than television - fixing television?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well everybody has a responsibility, parents have a responsibility. The Chief Justice identified the ugly parent syndrome in relation to sport. Most parents aren't like that but some are. And I think the general thrust of what he had to say was absolutely spot on.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is that an issue you might take up with the new head of ACMA?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, it's not something where I'm going to start issuing directives. I'm asked for an opinion and in my position I should have an opinion on something like this. And I'm not saying we're going to introduce a mandatory code or anything of that kind, but I'm making the proposition that there is a place for a certain amount of restraint in language. There is language used now on television that some people find offensive and nothing is lost, earthiness of expression in an appropriate environment is something to be encouraged, but the use of vulgar language on television is not necessarily something that makes us a better, more expressive people. And I think it contributes to the sort of thing the Chief Justice is talking about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you talking about reality shows there Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the AC Nielsen Poll that was out today, your reaction to that? The Government is well ahead of Labor.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I don't give a running commentary on opinion polls. We do our job, we try hard. It's always tough to win elections in Australia and I wouldn't encourage any Liberal or National Party supporter to get carried away with opinion polls. We've got a big job ahead of us. Labor's always competitive federally and they shouldn't be treated as an easy opponent. They're anything but.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the Nationals, they're having their crisis meeting today. Is there any message you'd like to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Having their what meeting?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well what they've termed a crisis meeting in Sydney.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think there's any crisis.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No crisis?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No crisis. Everybody should remain calm. No crisis.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's been reports or suggestions that future elections could become a three cornered contest if the Nationals decide to drop out of the Coalition. Are you concerned about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would predict the future elections will be essentially the same as in the past. I strongly support the maintenance of joint Senate tickets. I think joint Senate tickets maximise the Coalition vote. It's always been the case that when a seat is vacant it's open to either Party to contest it, and when it's won by a Party then the other Party stays out.  I would predict that that will overwhelmingly remain the case at the next election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you expect the Liberals and Nationals will go to the next election as a Coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I have not the slightest doubt that we will go to the next election as a strong, successful, united Coalition. I have no doubt about that at all.  Thank you.</p>
