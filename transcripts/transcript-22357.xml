    <content><![CDATA[<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>North Korea has continued to defy international opinion with this week's series of missile tests. To discuss that and other issues this morning we're joined now by Prime Minister John Howard. Good morning to you, PM.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Karl.</p>
<p>STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>How serious do we need to take this? Are we a potential target here?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think a lot of countries are potential targets if North Korea successfully develops a capacity to fire intercontinental ballistic missiles. We are dealing here with a quite irrational country and it would seem at this stage  that even countries as close to North Korea as China are not perhaps having the influence on North Korea's behaviour that we might want. So it's a serious issue. Some people are saying "Well, they are just doing it to attract attention and we shouldn't get too concerned about that ."  That's a possibility. On the other hand if the world doesn't respond in a united fashion and our worst fears turn out to be true, then the public not only in this country but around the world is entitled to say their governments have failed them.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>You wouldn't expect them to directly target us though, would you?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't. I wouldn't have thought they had a reason to directly target anyone, but when you see missile testing going on in breach of undertakings given, when you see a country apparently defying the requests and wishes of most of the nations of the world, and when you bear in mind that if North Korea were to come back to the negotiating table there would be a lot in it for North Korea. There would be guarantees of energy supplies and security, there would be offers of assistance for what is a very impoverished poor country, whose population lives in appalling circumstances, you realise that you are dealing with a very difficult regime.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Recently, and you mentioned China a little earlier in the interview, you had a successful trip there. Wouldn't you say, though, that it is time for China to stand up now and to show some leadership?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We would like to see China put as much pressure on North Korea as possible. Nobody is saying that China controls North Korea, North Korea is an independent country. But China has more influence on North Korea and we are certainly very keen, as we are that the United Nations come up to the crease and see what it can do to speak on behalf of the world with a united voice. People often criticise the Americans for not utilising the United Nations. Now plainly the United Nations is being utilised at the present time and there's quite an onus on the Security Council, including the five permanent members and that includes of course Russia and China, to come up with a resolution that means something and expresses the collective concern, but also the collective looking forward if you like, of the rest of the world. I mean there is a willingness on the part of the six countries to sit down with North Korea and talk about the future. But it has to be on the basis that North Korea gives away any maligned use of nuclear capacity.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Just finally on this issue, North Korea is now threatening "stronger physical actions against Japan and the US." Does your interpretation of that mean that you expect more tests to be conducted?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I certainly expect more tests. I think there's a certain amount of noise and sound and fury in that kind of statement. But you have to understand the legitimate sensitivity and concern of the Japanese. They are next door and they are very worried about this. And they are in the forefront of countries before the United Nations of wanting the world to speak with one voice.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Right, just moving on now. On the anniversary of the London bombings, another Al-Qaeda warning. Are you satisfied that we've done everything possible to protect ourselves against a terrorist attack?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We've done everything we can, that doesn't mean that I guarantee to the Australian people it won't happen, I cannot do that.  I've never tried to do that. All I have said is that we will do everything we can and we've done that. We have spent a lot more money on strengthening security. We've strengthened our laws, we obviously have laid charges or charges have been laid against certain people. I can't talk about the outcome of those things. What terrified people about London was that the people who did it grew up, most of them, grew up in the north of England. They were British citizens. We've had people arrested and charged in Canada, a similar situation, where people actually grew up in that country and have been charged with terrorist attacks. And we've had, of course, people in this country charged. Whether they are found guilty is, of course, a matter for the courts.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>The Opposition says you've dropped the ball in regards to this. You haven't fulfilled promises that you made after the London bombings.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Opposition always attacks the Government. This Opposition seems congenitally incapable of ever agreeing with anything the Government does, but that's its right in a democracy, but their claim is quite wrong.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Moving on. IR issues is another important one. Hundreds of Western Australian workers face fines of tens of thousands of dollars each for strike action in March. What are you thoughts on that? Are you going to intervene in regards to that issue or are you going to leave it alone?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this action has been taken by an independent body. The Government didn't decide to prosecute these people. The Government didn't take the decision and the Government has no power to intervene. It's a matter for the independent authority, and that authority was established in the wake of the Cole Royal Commission into the building industry which found there was a culture of lawlessness in that industry. And Parliament, the Government, through Parliament passed law to establish this independent body, and this independent body has taken it's decision and I understand it's in the wake of a refusal of the people involved to obey the orders of the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire that both the Labor Party and the ACTU always tell me should be obeyed by everybody.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>Right PM, just finally, on a lighter note, your old chum Gough Whitlam celebrates his 90th birthday early next week. Are you part of the celebration planning committee?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but I wish him well. Anybody who reaches that age deserves to enjoy it, and I hope Gough on the 11th of July, has a happy birthday, and I hope he has the opportunity of enjoying it with his family and his very close friends.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>You won't be jumping out of the cake, PM?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't know that I'd be his performer of choice.</p>
<p> STEFANOVIC:</p>
<p>All right, Prime Minister that you very much for your time this morning,   appreciate it.</p>
