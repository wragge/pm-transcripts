EMBARGO: CHECK AGAINST F 76/ 124<br />
DELIVERY ~ J) USWAI tAL<br />
FOR PRESS .13 JUNE 1976<br />
ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Last weeks Premiers' Conference was one of the most<br />
significant ever held.<br />
It was significant. for two major reasons.<br />
First, it broke new ground in the way in which both State and<br />
local government will share Commonwealth tax revenue in future.<br />
State and local government will receive major elements<br />
ofE their financial entitlements automatically in future.<br />
Second, the conference was significant in that decisions<br />
were made during a crucial period of Australia's economic<br />
recovery. Spending in the public sector over the past few years has run<br />
away from reality.<br />
The Commuonwealth was spending too much of peoples' earnings.<br />
The States had come : 0 expect too much from the Commonwealth.<br />
They promised new programmes without having the resources to<br />
pay for them. They : hen expected the Commonwealth to foot<br />
the bill.<br />
At the JPremiers-.. Conference the Government made it clear that<br />
it was standing firm in its resolve to reign in spending.<br />
The Government made it equally clear that all States had<br />
the same responsibility. Our purpose was to protect the<br />
taxpayers of Australia..<br />
The Commonwealth-Gorernuentxalonez-cannot cre te cono-Pills.<br />
It needs the support of States and citizens.<br />
Figures show that growth in State bureaucracies and in-spending<br />
levels were generally just as high as the Commonwealth.<br />
There was little indication however that the States had been<br />
prepared to act with the same economic responsibility as we<br />
believe we have shown in the last six months.<br />
They now understand they have a great responsibility to slow<br />
their own growth back to realistic levels. If that doesn't<br />
happen, taxes can only go on being increased. And taxes<br />
are already too high. 2 </p>
<p>However even allowing for the necessary restraints<br />
in money allocation the States will receive an extra<br />
16.4 percent in money terms, in this forthcoming year.<br />
This is a substantial increase.<br />
It will cover reimbursement grants, loan programmes,<br />
semi-government loan programmes, payments to local government*<br />
and welfare housing.<br />
The Gov. ernment stressed that the overall 16.4 percent increase<br />
was as nuch as the nation could afford at this time.. Wc<br />
pointed out that our concern is to protect taxpayers.<br />
All Government programmes have to be paid for by a tax on<br />
individuals.<br />
The Government also put it plainly that when high unemployment,<br />
high inflation and high interest rates are running together<br />
that you simply-cannot buy your way out of the problem.<br />
Countries that have tried, this have added to inflation and<br />
added to unemployment.<br />
Some people have looked at our new Federalism proposals<br />
merely as a device for providing States with extra money.<br />
This view underestimates what Federalism is all about.<br />
I<br />
It * s designed to give the States greater flexibility<br />
in how they spend Czznonwealth money.<br />
It is designed to : ve States greater responsibility for<br />
their own activities.<br />
If they want more money for programmes they are going-to<br />
have to go to the pezple and ask for that money.<br />
And they will have justify spending that money.<br />
No longer will the States be able to hide behind the back<br />
of the qommoziiealth for their failure to keep promises<br />
or for their failure to meet the needs of the people.<br />
Victoria's Premier ( Mr Hamer) is resolute in his support<br />
for this ideal. He wants responsibility for the money he spends.<br />
Those Premiers-who have attacked---this-: concept have-not been<br />
prepared to accept the responsiblity that Government brings.<br />
They have wanted the cash and the kudos but not the responsibility.<br />
One of the most important matters finalised at the Premiers'<br />
Conference was the arrangement that will make local government<br />
a real partner in the Commonwealth's Pederalism reforms.<br />
Local government will be part of the tax sharing reforms which<br />
will set a new pattern in Commonwealth/ State financial arrangements. </p>
<p>In future, a fixed percentage of personal income tax<br />
will be earmarked for distribution through: the States<br />
to local government.<br />
This is a vital change. Municipalities and shires throughout<br />
Australia will be able to calculate their annual revenues<br />
with greater certainty. As a result they will also have very<br />
much greater independence of action.<br />
In 1976/ 77 the first year of the new arrangements<br />
the Commonwealth will provide a total of $ 140 million in<br />
general revenue assistance to local government authorities<br />
throughout Australia. This is an increase of $ 60 million<br />
or 75 percent over the amount provided by the former Government<br />
last year under the old arrangements.<br />
The Premiers' Conference agreed on the State by State<br />
distribution of this financial assistance for local government.<br />
It is now up to the States to urgently make sure that every<br />
local. council is now made aware of its entitlement.<br />
The finance decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference<br />
were made with one major thought in mind that is, the control<br />
of inflation.<br />
Until inflation is overcome there is not going to be the<br />
kind of reinvestment in the productive capacity of Australia<br />
that we would want.<br />
And until Australia can demonstrate it is getting on top of<br />
inflation, businessmen are going to stand off and be wary. of<br />
new investment. Unless there is new investment there are<br />
not going to be the kind of productive jobs that are required<br />
in Australia. </p>
