FOR MEDIA 19 September 1984<br />
The Leader of the Opposition obviously wants to back down from<br />
reckless charges he has laid aga-inst me.<br />
But instead of honestly and openly admitting he has no substance<br />
for his claims Mr Peacock has constructedan elaborate smokescreen.<br />
On many occasions in recent days he has had the opportunity<br />
to come clean with the electorate and confess he has made<br />
an error.<br />
Now, after claiming to have evidence to substantiate his<br />
allegations he has tried to obscure the central issue.<br />
If after making the gravest possible charges he is unable<br />
to substantiate them, as today's statement clearly<br />
demonstrates, he is left without credibility and without<br />
integrity.<br />
It is even more tawdry that he now seeks to get himself off<br />
the hook by undermining the stature of the National Crimes<br />
Authority. </p>
