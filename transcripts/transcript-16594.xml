    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today announced the appointment of two additional Local Employment Coordinators in the Richmond - Tweed and Clarence Valley and Mid North coast regions in NSW.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is providing $20 million under its Jobs and Training Compact for Local Area Employment Coordinators to work in regions and local communities hit hardest by the effects of the global recession.</p>
<p>Today's announcement takes the number of coordinators to nine. In April, coordinators were announced in seven initial regions, identified using a range of labour market and social indicators.</p>
<p>While the impacts of the global recession are being felt around the nation, some communities are experiencing higher levels of unemployment and disadvantage.</p>
<p>The global downturn has hit the tourism industry in the Richmond - Tweed and Clarence Valley and Mid North coast regions while recent severe flooding has severely impacted the agricultural industry.</p>
<p>The Government is taking all action possible to help those who lose their job through no fault of their own during this global recession.</p>
<p>Local Employment Coordinators will work with community stakeholders to bring together government, community and business partnerships to assist these priority regions in their recovery.</p>
<p>Local Employment Coordinators will also work with the community to identify and develop projects to be funded under the Government $650 million Jobs Fund.</p>
<p>The Jobs Fund builds on the Rudd Government's $42 billion National Building Economic Stimulus Plan and will support jobs and build skills for the future through community, environmental and social infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The Government is currently considering proposals under the first funding round with a second funding round to be opened later in the year.</p>
