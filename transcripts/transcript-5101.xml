FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 10 JULY 1979<br />
TELEGRAM TO TASMANIAN PREMIER, MR. LOWE<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following telegram to<br />
the Premier of Tasmania, Mr. Lowe:<br />
" I was surprised to receive your telex of 4 July requesting<br />
a meeting to discuss airfares.<br />
" At no stage during the Premiers' Conference did you raise<br />
this matter with me. Nor did you raise any other matters<br />
specifically rela ti-ng to Tasmania. This was despite the<br />
fact that there was ample opportunity to do so, either when<br />
you came to dinner with me at The Lodge on 28 June or at<br />
t he other times specificially set aside to give Premiers<br />
opportunities to raise matters of particular concern to<br />
their States. A number of Premiers took advantage of these<br />
opportunities, but you did not.<br />
" Against this background, I have no intention of holding<br />
discussions on airfares with you during the course of an<br />
election campaign. I shall, however, be happy to discuss the<br />
matter with the Premier of Tasmania following the election."<br />
000----G C-jj </p>
