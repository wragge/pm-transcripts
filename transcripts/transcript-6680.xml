I PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
N. S. W. BRANCH OF THE ECONOMIC SOCIETY<br />
SYDNEY 30 JULY 1985<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I understand that today you have been hearing various<br />
forecasts of major interest rates and the exchange rate.<br />
This is undoubtedly a fascinating pastime; and one which<br />
has both made and lost the reputation of many<br />
distinguished economists and none too few public<br />
servants. So I trust that you will understand if I do<br />
not do the same.<br />
-Let me instead begin with a brief advertisement for two<br />
of our major trading banks I know there are ' four but I<br />
have now an established track record that I only do ads<br />
for half of any product.<br />
Over the last month or so these two banks have treated<br />
Australians to rather a rare event in this country.<br />
Despite very rapid growth in their lending to business<br />
and higher borrowing costs, these banks have offered<br />
temporarily lower interest rates on new loans taken up<br />
during July.<br />
This may seem a trifling event in the overall scheme of<br />
things. But it illustrates a number of important points<br />
which .1 wish to address tonight.<br />
These are the strength of the Australian economy, and<br />
the associated economic policy context; the new spur toI<br />
competition which our policies have provided to the<br />
financiai sector and the Australian economy at large;<br />
and the implications of these for the conduct and<br />
measurement of monetary policy.<br />
With all of the other media preoccupations of recent<br />
weeks, these are developments which have largely been<br />
ignored.<br />
L. </p>
<p>Unlike the strong growth leaders overseas, we are<br />
expecting our growth performance to be muintained in<br />
1985-86 our third year of Etrong ecor., omic expansion.<br />
Through the past two years Australia has been bracketed<br />
with the United States as the industrial economy<br />
performing-most strongly on real growth and employment.<br />
Now the international commentators are expecting us to<br />
do better than the United States.<br />
The Australian people can take pride in this achievementI<br />
and can draw inspiration from it as we tackle issues<br />
that must be addressed alonq the path to permanently<br />
improved growth performance.<br />
The March quarter National Accounts suggest that, if<br />
anything, growth in 1984-85 has been faster than the<br />
per cent or So expected at the time of the Budget.<br />
Most pleasingly, the improvement since the Budget<br />
results from higher than expected growth in the private<br />
Private consumption, abstracting from the purely<br />
statistical impact of the introduction of Medicare,<br />
seems likely to have exceeded 3 1/ 2 per cent, compared<br />
to the forecast a year ago of 2 3/ 4 per cent.<br />
-Private business investment also seems likely to have<br />
grown more strongly than earlier expected, with a<br />
particularly strong performance likely in the June<br />
quarter.<br />
This strength has been reflected in the stark turnaround<br />
in the labour market since 1983.<br />
Employment has grown by around 384,000 since April 1983,<br />
including 133,000 jobs in the last year. Indeed<br />
employment growth has been strong enough not only to<br />
absorb the new entrants to the labour force, but also to<br />
cut the unemployment rate to 8.7 per cent, significantly<br />
1983.-<br />
Moreover contary to widespread expectations we are on<br />
the threshold of a year which again promises economic<br />
growth in the order of 5 per cent, and which offers<br />
every prospect that our commitment to creating 500,000<br />
jobs in our first three years will be met ahead of time.<br />
As we enter the third successive year of 5 per cent<br />
growth, it is worth remembering that there was not a<br />
single year of 5 per cent growth in the seven lean years<br />
of Coalition government which preceded our election in<br />
March 1983. </p>
<p>And with over 380,000 new jobs having been created in<br />
the past 26 months, it is worth remembering that already<br />
this handsomely exceeds the 340,000 new jobs in the 88<br />
long months of Coalition rule.<br />
This dramatic improvement has not happened by accident.<br />
It is the result of responsible policies, consistently<br />
applied. Policies which were clearly outlined in the<br />
1983 election campaign, and restated in 1984.<br />
our policies have produced for Australia a sharp<br />
reduction in our inflation rate, a sharp reduction in<br />
industrial disharmony, the restoration of business<br />
profitability and a return to levels of real unit labour<br />
costs last seen in the early seventies.<br />
our policies are based squarely on the Accord and<br />
equitable restraint in income claims; a progressively<br />
less stimulatory fiscal policy as private sector<br />
recovery intensifies; and a supportive monetary policy.<br />
Alongside these macro-economic policies, our industry<br />
policy has emphasised the importance of strengthened<br />
competitiveness in an international environment. Our<br />
trade policy has focussed on opportunities for expansion<br />
of our most productive and potentially productive<br />
industries. It has been a hard slog : the steel industry and motor<br />
vehicle plans; the dairy plan now hostage to the<br />
political expediency of the Senate; the consultations<br />
with unions on industry issues in other highly protected<br />
industries, in coal, iron ore and other mining, and<br />
throughout the economy; and the steady efforts on trade<br />
policy, especially as it affects opportunities in the<br />
Western Pacific region. I<br />
We are raising productivity and reducing costs through<br />
improved performance within a wide range of industries.<br />
The further reduction in relative costs brought by the<br />
devaluation provides the additional necessary element<br />
for u-s finally to establish in Australia an open,<br />
competitive industry structure to take us confidently<br />
into the 1990s.<br />
Some of the very recent news underlines: the potency of<br />
these developments.<br />
The contract won by Australian industry for the supply<br />
of light railways to Hong Kong is a major breakthrough.<br />
The low tariff premium on four-year motor vehicle quota<br />
announced last week, at 11 per cent, shows that our<br />
costs of producing vehicles are now closer to<br />
a L it &amp; 2..... J. AtflIk2t t. . SAÃ±. </p>
<p>international le-els than seemed possible a year ago.<br />
Data presented to the media by BHP this-week show that<br />
the combination of productivity improvements and<br />
depreciation has turned the Australian steel industry<br />
dramatically, from mediocre performance vulnerable to<br />
lower-costs competition from more dynamic economies<br />
three years ago, to highly competitive production today.<br />
And parti cularly pleasing but not yet able to be<br />
released in detail data available to the Government<br />
today show dramatic reductions in tariff premia for<br />
footwear and clothing import quota at this year's<br />
tender.<br />
We recognise as well the fundamental importance to the<br />
longer-term growth of the economy of education and<br />
training of ensuring that programs improve Australia's<br />
skill base and enhance the employment prospects of our<br />
young people. This is an issue the Government has been<br />
examining closely in recent weeks, and on which I shall<br />
be making a major policy statement next month.<br />
Our general economic policies have thus laid a firm<br />
foundation on which to build the future prosperity of<br />
Australia. Prosperity which will bring with it more<br />
jobs and higher living standards.<br />
-Indeed it is because this government places so high a<br />
priority on creating job opportunities and curbing<br />
unemployment that we have placed so high a priority on<br />
containing inflation; on restoring Australia's<br />
international competitiveness; on encouraging expansion<br />
in the private sector; and on ensuring an equitable<br />
distribution of national income. I<br />
It is for this reason that the government is committed<br />
to the unprecedented fiscal trilogy a commitment whichI<br />
will be convincingly honoured in the coming Budget. it<br />
is for this reason that we ensured that real progress<br />
was made in the May Statement.<br />
It was for this reason that the States joined us in the<br />
cause of national economic recovery through the<br />
unprecedentedly restrained outcome of this year's<br />
Premiers' Conference.<br />
It is for this reason that the government has<br />
consistently pursued a responsible monetary policy and,<br />
indeed, that we tightened monetary policy earlier this<br />
year. It is for this reason that the Accord with the ACTU was<br />
negotiated in 1983 giving the Government a further<br />
instrument for the pursuit of macro-economic policy. </p>
<p>And I note that it is not an instrument available to the<br />
opposition in this country.<br />
I painted for you earlier d generally optimistic<br />
scenario of further growth and more jobs in 1985-86. A<br />
scenario o * f yet another year. of 5 per cent growth in<br />
Australia. A scenario moreover which is more optimistic<br />
than most of the private sector forecasts which have<br />
appeared but with justification.<br />
The indicators point to private sector demand continuing<br />
to grow strongly. Consumer demand is buoyant and likely<br />
to be sustained as employment expands. Surveys of<br />
investment intentions are favourable to further growth.<br />
There is scope for an increase in business stock<br />
holdings. But a major factor in the outlook is the substantial<br />
improvemcnt of our international competitiveness which<br />
has occurred following the depreciation of the $ A<br />
earlier this year.<br />
The depreciation provides the opportunity for domestic<br />
producers across a broad range of industries to capture<br />
a larger share of the still rapidly expanding demand for<br />
goods and services. It permits exporters to earn higher<br />
returns if their prices are set in world markets, or to<br />
compete more aggressively for a larger share of world<br />
trade. Largely as a consequence, net exports could<br />
contribute I or 2 percentage points to economic growth<br />
in 1985-86, after detracting from growth in 1984-85.<br />
That kind of stimulus to private sector economic<br />
activity is worth taking some trouble to preserve. it<br />
could generate, on its own, in the order of 100,000<br />
additional jobs in the next few years if Australia can<br />
maintain and capitalise upon the improvement in our<br />
competitive position. But it will take substantial<br />
effort to sustain the benefits in the period beyond<br />
1985-86. Already the improved competitiveness from<br />
depreciation is threatened by signs of an acceleration<br />
of inflation.<br />
The most recent Consumer Price Index, which increased by<br />
2.4 per cent in the June quarter, provided a sobering<br />
reminder of the inflationary implications of<br />
depreciation. of course some initial price rises in the wake of<br />
depreciation were only to be expected. Domestic<br />
producers can become more price competitive following<br />
depreciation only because the prices of imported<br />
subsitutes rise. </p>
<p>Up to 1 percentage point of the June quarter CPI rise<br />
seems to have been directly attributable to that<br />
process, and there will be further adjustments in coming<br />
quarters as higher prices of landed imports are<br />
progressively passed through into retail prices.<br />
As a consequence our inflation rate could reach 8 per<br />
cent or a little more in the course of the next year.<br />
If the depreciation is to make its full contribution to<br />
growth in employment, there must be, temporarily, slower<br />
growth in real wages than there might otherwise have<br />
been. What we need is a temporary slowing for those in work,<br />
to reap the benefit of the 100,000 potential new jobs<br />
which could flow from a sustained real depreciation of<br />
the magnitude which Australia has experienced.<br />
At 8 per cent, our prospective inflation rate could be<br />
almost twice that of our major trading partners by the<br />
end of 1985-86; with much of the disparity attributable<br />
to the initial impact of higher prices for imported<br />
final goods and components. If that disparity were to<br />
be built into the cost structure of domestic producers<br />
as higher wages, much of. their initial competitive<br />
advantag= would be lost.<br />
Furthermore, if our underlying cost structute is pumped<br />
up to that extent, there is a risk that the re-ignition<br />
of inflationary expectations will adversely affect<br />
employment prospects, even in 1985-86.<br />
In making this call for restraint~ to Australian wage<br />
earners, I know I am asking for something that appears<br />
hard. Australian workers, their unions, and their<br />
representatives in the ACTU have contributed<br />
magnificiently to the national economic recovery since<br />
the Economic Summit 27 months ago.<br />
I know that it is not easy to understand why further<br />
restraint may be necessary, after two years of strong<br />
growth, and another in prospect.<br />
The reason is that we entered upon the expansionary<br />
policies which have been so successful, spectacularly<br />
successful, in delivering growth and jobs, when the<br />
economy was heavily laden with structural weaknesses<br />
which had accumulated over the previous decade.<br />
Australia, like many other exporters of minerals and<br />
rural products, has suffered an extraordinary </p>
<p>deterioraticn in its terms of trade over the last<br />
decade. We might have Axpected some cotrection during<br />
the recent international upturn, but this has not<br />
occurred. The continued corruption of world trade in<br />
farm products holds back any hope of substantial<br />
improvement,-from the foreseeable future.<br />
Over recent years, we have accumulated rapidly growing<br />
levels of foreign debt proportionately most markedly<br />
during the so-called " resources boom", but since then as<br />
well, including through the $ 10 billion current account<br />
deficit in the year that has just ended.<br />
The maintenance of reasonable balance in the external<br />
accounts, while servicing the accumulated debt, and<br />
overcoming the effects of a decade's deterioration in<br />
the terms of trade, requires markedly improved<br />
competitiveness. But over the decade during which we accumulated these<br />
structural problems, our productivity growth and our<br />
control of domestic costs did not compare favourably<br />
with many of our trading partners.<br />
There were thus good economic reasons why the return to<br />
strong growth in Australia two yearc ago was reflected<br />
in a weakenr4ng balance of payments, and eventually in<br />
. the depreciation of the dollar.<br />
It was not our approach to let jobs and activity<br />
languish until we had corrected the underlying<br />
structural weaknesses of the Australian economy.<br />
It was always our approach to fight inflation and<br />
unemployment at the same time.<br />
It is still our approach.<br />
So that although now threatened by the inflationary<br />
consequences of the fall in the dollar, we are<br />
determined to press on with growth, to press on with the<br />
creation of jobs.<br />
And this means that we must ask the Australian people to<br />
join us, in exercising restraint until we have absorbed<br />
the inflationary impact of depreciation, and until a<br />
strengthening balance of payments has restored stability<br />
to the dollar.<br />
We have gone a long way to re-establish the competitive<br />
basis for strong growth, and we are not about to let it<br />
slide away. </p>
<p>The Government has already expressed a clear view on<br />
these matters to the ACTU within the framework of the<br />
Accord. We have put all options on the table, Including I<br />
deferral of the foreshadowed productivity wage round and<br />
discounting. The matter of timing will also have to be<br />
addressed.' r<br />
These matters are all relevant to determining the<br />
position the Government will take in the September wage<br />
case. The Government's position will, as always,<br />
promote first of all the community interest in sustained<br />
growth in output and employment.<br />
I have every confidence that the Accord is sufficiently<br />
flexible to again deliver for Australia the kind of<br />
wages growth and industrial environment necessary to<br />
create jobs.<br />
What is needed is that all groups exercise restraint in<br />
income claims. Some rise in profitability is a<br />
necessary market signal. It will redirect resources to<br />
areas which now need them to increase production for<br />
export or of goods previously supplied from imports.<br />
But this must not involve imposing unnecessary cost<br />
burdens on others.<br />
Let there be no doubt that the government will be doing<br />
-its part to provide firm monetary and fiscal policy, to<br />
provi; de'the support necessary for the success of prices<br />
and incomes policy.<br />
I have heard it said that inflation to the economist is<br />
as sex to the novelist : both are associated with a<br />
rising rate of interest. For this and other reasons I<br />
can assure you that my Government is determined to keep<br />
-inflation within'reasonable bounds.<br />
Which leads me back to my story at the beginning.<br />
You will remember that this was based on the observation<br />
that two banks had temporarily offered discounted<br />
personal loans, something of an innovation in Australian<br />
financial markets.<br />
This is but one of a number of similar steps taken by<br />
banks in recent times. Others include the introduction<br />
of new and innovative service packages for customers,<br />
the spread of low start mortgages, some narrowing of<br />
margins between borrowing and lending rates and the<br />
expansion of banks into activities previously denied<br />
them by the regulatory framework. </p>
<p>Already two new banks are operational, both the result<br />
of a conversion of the operations of a non-bank<br />
institution. Negotiati. ons are continuing with a view to<br />
authorizing another 16 potential new banks, as<br />
previously announced. The majority of these will be<br />
operati-ng before the end of.-the year.<br />
This is part of our overall strategy to eliminate<br />
unncessary regulation wherever possible and promote<br />
innovation and structural change. The rationale for<br />
this policy is precisely the same as that of our more<br />
general economic policy: namely to create the<br />
conditions which will permit an on-going expansion of<br />
job opportunities and improved living standards.<br />
Within this new, freer regulatory environment, the<br />
financial sector is undergoing a period of transition.<br />
Financial institutions are seeking to rearrange their<br />
business strategies and reposition themselves in the<br />
market place.<br />
Banks, especially, have become far more competitive with<br />
non-bank institutions and, as our opening story<br />
illustrates, far more aggressive. That is the outcome<br />
which we were seeking when we removed many of the<br />
earlier restrictions on their op"-rations.<br />
The growing sophistication of the financial system, both<br />
before and after deregulation, has necessitated a<br />
continuous review of our approach to monetary<br />
management. Decisions on appropriate monetary policies, when and how<br />
policies are implemented, must evolve with the financial<br />
system.<br />
For example, over the past decade or so, the main<br />
objective of policy has shifted from interest rate<br />
stability towards the rates of growth of monetary<br />
aggregates particularly M3. And the method of<br />
implementation has shifted from quantitative controls on<br />
a particular group of intermediaries to open market<br />
operations. By the mid 1980s, these shifts were virtually complete.<br />
These days, monetary management is almost entirely based<br />
on open market operations in a range of Commonwealth<br />
debt instruments.<br />
A particularly important aspect of monetary policy in<br />
the post-float era is the day-to-day management of the<br />
liquidity base of the financial system. Fine tuning of<br />
liquidity conditions was impossible before the float,<br />
because the reserve bank had no control over the<br />
quantity of foreign exchange purchased or sold. </p>
<p>Efficient day-to-day liquidity management is now not<br />
only possible, but also necessary. This is because the<br />
external sector is now no longer available as a net<br />
source of liquidity when the system is under pressure.<br />
Last week the reserve bank ' released statistics which<br />
showed 17.5 per cent growth in M3 through 1984/ 85.<br />
In other circumstances that would rightly have been<br />
regarded as a disturbingly high rate of increase. But a<br />
significant element of the apparent acceleration of M3<br />
since the beginning of this year was attributable to the<br />
reclassification into M3 of the deposits of two<br />
institutions that were not even banks a year ago.<br />
Another element was the strong push by existing banks to<br />
raise their share of total financing, which adds to bank<br />
lending and thus M3, but not to aggregate activity. As<br />
well, bank lending was inflated in May and June by a<br />
need to finance purchases by 30 June of investment goods<br />
which would qualify for the investment allowances.<br />
It is not yet possible to estimate the contribution of<br />
this reintermediaticn to recent growth of M3, but it has<br />
clearly been substantial.<br />
-The broadest published financial aggregate " Broad<br />
Money" is less vulnerable to such distortions.<br />
Further, broad money appears in practice to have been<br />
more stable during the recent period of financial<br />
turbulence than the narrow aggregates.<br />
Broad money rose by 15.8 per cent in the year to May,<br />
also a high rate. But that figure was inflated by the<br />
double counting of some non-bank deposits.<br />
Excluding that ef-lect broad money has increased at an<br />
annual rate of 13 1/ 2 per cent so far this financial<br />
year. But even leaving aside some statistical problems<br />
that growth rate has, in turn, been somewhat inflated by<br />
a shift from direct transactions between ultimate<br />
lenders and borrowers towards intermediation by<br />
Financial institutions.<br />
Indeed, it is only to be expected that as the cost of<br />
financial intermediation is reduced by additional<br />
competition and the removal of regulatory distortions,<br />
intermediation will increasingly replace marginal forms<br />
of direct financing.<br />
Thus even broad money needs to be interpreted with some<br />
care. </p>
<p>With the growing complexity of the financial system, it<br />
is clear markets will need to monitor a-much wider gro-up<br />
of indicators than before. No longer will any single<br />
measure suffice.<br />
It is worth considering, however, that not all of these<br />
alternative indicators necessarily are as easy to<br />
interpret as in the past. Take, for example, interest<br />
rates over the past six months.<br />
In the long term, the costs of intermediation should be<br />
lower in a more competitive and efficient financial<br />
sector. But interest rates rates have been subjected to a range<br />
of forces in recent months. Aggressive competition for<br />
funds, especially in the short term money market, has<br />
undoubtedly placed transitory upward pressure on some<br />
short term interest rates.<br />
In addition the financial system has weathered the<br />
seasonal liquidity downturn, in the environment of a<br />
floating dollar for only the second time.<br />
There has also been upward pressure on interest rates<br />
followin-. a deliberate firming of policy a firming<br />
intended support an overly weak exchange rate and to<br />
-dampen inflation and inflatio~ n expectations. This has<br />
been felt initially in markets for short term funds, and<br />
Wil ultimately show up in the volume of lending.<br />
Yields on ten year bonds rose steadily between late 1984<br />
and May of this year. Since yields on 10 year US<br />
treasury bonds declined over the period, the interest<br />
differential shifted sharply.<br />
But in recent weeks Australian yields have declined to<br />
levels of around a year ago and the differential has<br />
narrowed a little.<br />
No doubt changing perceptions of the strength of the<br />
Australian dollar have been an important part of this<br />
story. our inflation performance and perceptions of<br />
whether or not the improved competitiveness of<br />
Australian industry can be sustained have an important<br />
bearing on views formed about our exchange. rate and<br />
interest rates.<br />
Given the international linkages and domestic structural<br />
changes in both the financial system and the techniques<br />
used for monetary control, it is thus no longer easy to<br />
interpret monetary policy. 1 1--Ao" 0 0 9= 4 T </p>
<p>-4 1 But my Government is committed to making plain our<br />
policy intentions and to pro-iding the -information which<br />
will enable informed judgements to be miade. This<br />
statement is intended to be part of that process. We<br />
recognise that uncertainty about policy detracts from<br />
economi-c performance.<br />
So how is monetary policy now to be judged? My answer<br />
is that there can be no suggestion that liquidity<br />
management is anything but firm. No suggestion that<br />
interest rates are artificially soft. No suggestion<br />
that the government is pursuing anything other than a<br />
firm monetary policy in conjunction with a flexible,<br />
jobs-oriented prices and incomes policy.<br />
Our coming Budget also is focused sharply on our central<br />
economic and social objective jobs.<br />
The coming budget will promote a long term improvement<br />
in job opportunities because the deficit will be<br />
significantly lower this year than last. That<br />
reduction, in conjunction with the restraint in States<br />
borrowing programs agreed at the Loan Council will lead<br />
to a further cut of 1 per cent in the PSBR as a<br />
proportion of GDP..<br />
It will thus help to avoid a clash wuith the pri. vate<br />
-sector in credit markets and reduce pressures on real<br />
interest rates. It will also moderate further th&amp;-e<br />
degree of fiscal stimulus at a time when inflationary<br />
pressures are mounting and private activity strong.<br />
On both counts the Budget will contribute to durable<br />
growth and jobs.<br />
But it will also promote jobs directly. This Budget has<br />
a particular focus on enhancing job skills and training,<br />
particularly for our greatest national resource, our<br />
young people.<br />
The Budget, monetary policy, industry policy and prices<br />
and incomes policy thus all share that central objective<br />
to provide satisfying, long-term job opportunities.<br />
That is the unambiguous aim of the Government.<br />
We have come a long way.<br />
We are determined to overcome the remaining obstacles to<br />
securing for Australians the jobs, the rising living<br />
standards, the capacity for improved provision for those<br />
in need, that can come only from a long sustained periodr<br />
of strong growth with moderate inflation. .3<br />
