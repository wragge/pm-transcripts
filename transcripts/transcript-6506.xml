PRIME -MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE, 16 OCTOBER 1984<br />
TRAVELODGE HOTEL DARWIN<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
P.. M. s Well it's quite clear befd that before this campaign started<br />
4-that the major issue was going to be economic credibility. The<br />
9 credibility the Opposition within the Parliament I would suggest<br />
has already beew-destoye. One had hoped that once the campaign<br />
started that there may. be some evidence that the Opposition would<br />
treat the Australian electorate as they are that is an intelligent<br />
body, able to understand basic ecemomics. Instead of that-we hd'ie-e<br />
on Peacock's first day of campaigning been fttroduced to fftt-earfW<br />
economics. The proposition that we will have tax cuts at the same<br />
time as he has promised an increase definitely of $ 2h billion<br />
in new expenditures, and when you take indicative expenditures of<br />
about another $ 4h billion, there are about $ 7 billion new<br />
expenditures in the pipeline for the Opposition. Now they say<br />
they are going to have these new eKpenditures, reduce the deficit,<br />
reduce taxes and they want to be believed all at the same time.<br />
Now the only way that that can begin to make sense, if it can ata11,<br />
is by equivalent spending cuts of more than $ 7 billion. Now the<br />
Australian electorate is entitled through the campaign to be<br />
looking very closely at Mr Peacock, Mr Howard and others to find<br />
out where these massive spending cuts are going to be. Are they<br />
going to cut defence, are they going to cut education, social<br />
security just where are you going to get these cuts from. Now<br />
the truth, of course, is that you are seeing the politics of<br />
desperation leading to this flat-earth economics. They know that<br />
they won't be called upon to give effect to this nonsense. And, of<br />
course, against that flat-earth economics and politics of desperation<br />
the people of Australia have the clear position that this<br />
Government has been office now since the beginning of 1983 it'. s<br />
turned around the Australian economy from the stagnation that we<br />
inherited to the fastest growing economy in the world. We've done<br />
that with tax cuts for all coming into place next month, with a<br />
reduction in the size of the deficit and we will continue next year<br />
with a further reduction of the deficit with no overall increases in<br />
taxes. And we will do this by ensuring that expenditure programs<br />
grow at a lesser rate than the economic growth of the country as,<br />
a whole.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you want to be positive in this election campaicn,<br />
why are you reacting so sharply to the Opposition policies?<br />
I have said quite clearly from the beginning of the period </p>
<p>P. M. cont..: in which we knew we would be going into an election<br />
that I had the responsibility of doing two things. Firstly, to<br />
talk positively about our record, what we've done and what we'll be<br />
doing in the future. But I also have a clear responsibility to<br />
the people of Australia to analyse what is being said by the<br />
Opposition. And if the electorate is being insulted as they are<br />
by Mr Peacock's flat earth economics, then I have the responsibility<br />
to the people of Australia to reveal this nonsense and this insult<br />
to their intelligence with which they are being confronted.<br />
JOURNALIST: -The former head of the Treasury, John Stone, says<br />
that a swag of new taxes next year are inevitable now.<br />
Well you raised the question of Mr Stone. Australia had<br />
the opportunity, if that's the right way of putting it, of living<br />
under a combination of Mr Howard and Mr Stone for several years.<br />
They paid a very high price for the combined efforts of Mr Howard<br />
and Mr Stone. I think the people of Australia have done very<br />
very much better under the policies of the H-awke Labor Government.<br />
We have delivered what we promised we will continue to do that<br />
and I don't think the people of Australia are going to be<br />
particularly influenced by the failed Howards and Stones.<br />
JOURNALIST: Stone's forecasts are wrong?<br />
Yes indeed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Chief Minister is resigning tomorrow<br />
I understand to contest this seat. Do you regard him as a formidable<br />
opponent for Mr Reeves.<br />
I don't think I would say formidable. But one must recognise<br />
that as Chief Minister of the Territory he is well known. And I<br />
would be stupid to deny that fact. But I do make this point, that<br />
Mr Bveringham has on a number of occasions made it clear, and this<br />
must give great comfort to Mr Peacock, that I'm going to win the<br />
election and probably win, it with an increased majority. Nov I<br />
think the people of the Territory are going to recognise that it's<br />
very sensible for them to maintain the position where they've had<br />
in the Hawke Labor Government a representative in John Reeves whom<br />
I can say directly to th? people of the Territory has been a<br />
significant advocate for them. There are things that we have done<br />
in the Budget context and outside that would not have been done<br />
if it hadn't been for John Reeves. And in terms of the self-intarest<br />
of the people of the Northern Territory I think they will perceive<br />
it makes infinitely more sense for them to have a voice in the<br />
Government which Mr Everingham. says is going to be returned and<br />
probably with an increased majority, than to replace an effective<br />
member, a Government member, with a voice in a smaller Opposition.<br />
And in putting that proposition involves no attach on the integrity<br />
of the personalities of Mr Everingham. it -just a matter of sheer<br />
plain comumonsense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke how marqinal or how close do % oti considerthe<br />
voting will be in the electorate of the Northern Territory.<br />
I think Mr Reeves will win comfortably, he 3leserves to.<br />
ecause he'? s been an excellent member. </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: lie's been persistent and assiduous in his<br />
representations to me and to the Cabinet on the interests of the<br />
Trerritory. And that's been reflected in all the things that we've<br />
done for the Territory. Let me throw one statistic at you. There'll<br />
be more that I'll be giving while I'm here, but the tax sharing grant<br />
to the Northern Territory an increase of 12% for 84/ 85 against the<br />
average for the States of the significant increase in road<br />
funding and the undertaking to upgrade the Stuart H~ ighway, to incre-ase<br />
the rail facilities to Alice Springs, what we'll be doing in the<br />
area of communications. All these things we've moved persistent. Ly<br />
and effectively on with the persistent prodding of John Reeves.<br />
Now a member of the Government for the Northern Territory can do<br />
that, he's in a position to do it. And we've seen since March<br />
of 1983 Mr Reeves doing that for the people of the Territory<br />
persistently telling us directly in Government. He says these<br />
are the needs, these are the things that have got to be done. Now<br />
he can do that as a Government member and an Opposition Leader can't<br />
do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister his powers of persuasion weren't sufficient<br />
to convince you to build the Darwin to Alice Springs railway nor to<br />
permit the expansion of the uranium industry in the Northern<br />
Territory. How do you think that the people of the Territory<br />
Well I think the people of the Territory will respond to<br />
those in an appropriate manner. Let me make it clear on the<br />
question of the rail lines that we had said before the election,<br />
well, alright, we'll do that, it was something that had been<br />
indicated by the previous Government. When we inherited that<br />
extra $ 3.6 billion deficit we simply had to look at the programs<br />
that we'd talked about and we had to question whether that was in<br />
those tight circumstances something which could be done. And<br />
Mr Reeves put his case as did the Labor Premier of South Australia.<br />
We listened to him, we listened to the Chief Minister. Mr EveringhamV<br />
put his case very strongly. But what we said in those circumstances<br />
we'll have an independent enquiry the Hill enquiry. And it was<br />
quite clear that you were going to be facing a totally uneconomic:<br />
use of resources. And so we just didn't say well that's it. We<br />
listened then to Mr Reeves and we said now what are the sorts of<br />
things in your judgement that we ought to do. Because we had to<br />
listen to him. Mr Everingham had said the Stuart Highway doesn't<br />
need any more money spent on it. That's what he'd said. That's hiow<br />
responsible he was. And we listened to Mr Reeves. And he indicated<br />
yes, it would make sense~ to spend more money. In addition to<br />
$ 39 million that had already been allocated we have now allocated<br />
another $ 27 million through to the end of the 1980' s about 1987/ 88<br />
on this, including an extra $ 2.7 million this year, to upgrade the<br />
Stuart Highway to a modern all weather road. So that's the way in<br />
regards to the railway that Mr Reeves was responsible. He didn't<br />
say no, it's the railway or nothing, which is what the Chief<br />
Minister said absolutely denying his responsibilities of proper<br />
representation in the interests of the Territory. Mr Reeves<br />
approached it sensibly. Now in regard to the second part of your<br />
question uranium mining. The facts there are that the existing<br />
mines Ranger and Narbalek are continuing. Well Narbalek mining<br />
of course, as we know, is mined out, but it's the selling of it.<br />
In regards to Ranger I have been in constant touch with the<br />
management of Ranger and have facilitated their negotiation of extra<br />
contracts and so everyone who is employed in the industry here will<br />
N, </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: continue to be employed. And I think the economic<br />
facts are that with Ranger and Narbalek and with Roxby going ahead<br />
that the economic market forces would determine that that would be<br />
sufficient from Australia in the foreseeable future to meet market<br />
demands. So Mr Reeves' involvement there has been positive and<br />
constructive. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Everingham has indicated several times<br />
that he considers himself to be front bench material should he win -the<br />
fight.. Well it's all hypothetical because he's not going to be there.<br />
So all my answers now will be~ procwaW. ipon a purely hypothetical<br />
basis. So you're getting a special fav our, I normally don't answer<br />
hypothetical questions. But first of -all he's got this problem, he's<br />
got to make a decision as to which Party he's going to join. Now I~<br />
guess that what he's doing is to see who's going to have the larger<br />
numbers whether the National Party or the Liberal Party are going<br />
to have the ' larger number of members. it's not quite certain at this<br />
stage I suppose it will be pretty bare I guess. But he'll wait and<br />
see who got the most and I suppose he would then plump for..<br />
He's got some formidable opposition. I mean if he decided to go<br />
National held had to overcome that popular political hero, Mr Sinclair,<br />
now that's a task. But if he decides~ that the Liberals have got a.<br />
few more than the National Party, then he's got line up against<br />
several of them looking for the leadership. I mean Mr Peacock wants<br />
to hang on to it, Mr Howard wants it, there are a number of othersi.<br />
So I don't know where held go, what he'd do. Blut as I say it's all<br />
hypothetical. Mr Reeves has been a brilliant member for the Northern<br />
Territory and will continue to be so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, why are Mr Stone's forecasts for next year<br />
wrong? Well let's say, I'm using a bit of historical analysis here,<br />
I don't know why people should assume that every word that proceedeth<br />
out of the mouth of Stone has sort of been regarded as eternal truth.<br />
All I can say is that I have to sit in the Cabinet Room at the end<br />
of December last year when we discussed a major issue in regard ' to<br />
the running of the economy of this country. That is the floating of<br />
the dollar. Now everyone has recognised that this is probably the<br />
mst important decision taken by the Government. We were right and<br />
recognise we were right. Mr Stone opposed it. And in opposing It<br />
predicted that if we floated it the dollar would go upwards causing<br />
the sorts of problems associated with that movement* Well, need I<br />
say more.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well does it make his forecasts for next year wrong?<br />
Well I'm just saying your questions seemed to based upon the<br />
proposition that because Mr Stone said something it must be right.<br />
I'm simply saying that his track record is not brilliant. But-let<br />
me say this, I don't really want to get into the area of Mr Stone.<br />
You are raising it it's not a matter of conern to me. He's teen<br />
there, he's been at the Head of Treasury and the record of this;<br />
economy in that period was abysmal. Now he can say, well it wasnl't<br />
just him, it was the politicians Mr Howard. Well, I mean I don't<br />
mind eith~ er way. In a sense all I'm saying is that the result<br />
was disastrous and we were under a lot of pressure when we camoa to </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: Government as you will recall to got rid of Mr Stone.<br />
Now I and the Treasurer said no, we're not going to do that. We're<br />
going to give him the opportunity of staying there. We gave him that<br />
opportunity. Now he's made the decision to go. While he was there!<br />
he made a great deal of the need for the public service to be<br />
apolitical, the integrity of the public service. Now that seems to<br />
be something that rather escapes his attention at the moment. ' Tho<br />
election is not going to be about the observations of Mr Stone.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the aspect of'his remarks he wasn't just talking<br />
about the economy he talked about the Tapes Affair, immigration.<br />
Do you think Mr Stone is trying to carve out his own political<br />
place, be what it may?<br />
Well that would be interesting. There" is talk that after<br />
this election that with a considerable victory for the Government ' that<br />
there are going to be some new forces-of the right shaping a new<br />
Party. Well perhaps he is trying to carve out his constituency of<br />
the right. Well that's alright. I mean if Mr Stone wants to form<br />
or be part of a new political Party and come into the Parliament I'd<br />
welcome him there. It would be great fun.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H1awke should he stay out of this election campaign<br />
and leave it to the politicians.<br />
No, no. Let me be quite clear. You people have raised Mr Stone.<br />
I'm totally relaxed about Mr Stone as you will remember as I was when<br />
he had his other little sort of outburst in Perth. I'm just as relaxed<br />
about this one.<br />
JOURNALISTs The difference now, Sir, is that this is an election<br />
campaign. Shoud he be staying out of it.<br />
No I'm not saying that he should be staying out of it. I'm<br />
simply making the point that when in the public service there was<br />
no public servant, senior public servant, who was more dogmatic<br />
about the need for the public service to be apolitical. He attacked<br />
anyone who did anything in Government which suggested that you were<br />
bringing the public service into politics. Now while he was still<br />
there in the latter stages he seemed to forget all those stringent<br />
lectures and principles and he seems to be now feelin that just<br />
recently out of the public services he can get fully involved. Now<br />
I'm simply pointing out the contrast with that involvement with th., e<br />
sort of standards he was talking about before. And it's impossible<br />
for him to be making statements about the economy now without brin". Lng<br />
into it his knowledge and involvement as a public servant. Now<br />
he accepted the standards before, but he seems to be wanting to be<br />
elastic about them nowi. So be it. I am relaxed about anything he wants<br />
to say. We'll deal with the issues on their merits. And if there's<br />
one issue upon which we want the election to be fought it's the<br />
economic record of this Government against the economic record of<br />
the alternative Government. Because there is no period since the<br />
Great Depression of the 1930' s where this economy was brought more<br />
to its knees than under our Liberal/ National Party predecessors in<br />
office and with Mr Stone as Head of the Treasury. Now we told the </p>
<p>P. M. cont<br />
people of A\ ustralia that under our policies we would turn that<br />
round. We did, from stagnant economic growth we've moved this<br />
to the fastest growing economy in the world. We've created a<br />
quarter of a million new jobs. we've halved inflation. We've brought<br />
interest rates down. So if they want to talk about the economy that's<br />
exactly what we want. And we'll talk about it every day until<br />
December 1st.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke one of the things that Mr Stone says about<br />
tax is that indirect taxes must go up quite sharply if you were to<br />
fund your deficit of next year. What is your attitude to a rise<br />
in indirect taxes?<br />
Well let me go in two stages to that. -We don't have to<br />
be hypothetical. We've been in office since the beginning of 1983,<br />
We've had the May statement, we've had-the Budget for 83/ 84, and we've<br />
had the Budget brought down in August this year for 84/ 85. Now you<br />
look at what we've done. What we've done there is to reduce the<br />
deficit by $ 3 billion. What we were looking at was $ 9.6 billion that<br />
we inherited. We brought it down to $ 8.4 billion in 83/ 84 and<br />
then this year we've brought it down to $ 6.7 billion. In other words<br />
we've brought the deficit down by $ 3 billion. At the same time as<br />
doing that we've introduced tax cuts now which will take effect in<br />
a couple of weeks time tax cuts for everyone. And we've got the<br />
position where out tax take is a smaller percentage of GDP than the<br />
two record tax takes of the last two Liberal/ National governments.<br />
Now we don't have to be hypothetical. we've taken a lesser tax<br />
take than our predecessors, reduced the Budget deficit and given<br />
tax cuts. So that's what we've done. And we've indicated, both<br />
the Treasurer and myself, that as we go now into the next period we<br />
will do these things we will further reduce the deficit, an<br />
unqualified commitment; we will do that in a situation of no<br />
increase in the overall level of taxes. And thirdly, and following that,<br />
we have indicated we'll do that by undertaking that the growth in<br />
expenditures will be less than the rate of economic growth. Now that<br />
is real world economics. We've shown it in fact that we can do it,<br />
we've done it, we'll continue to do it. That's real world economics,<br />
it's not the flat earth economics which has been foisted by Mr Peacock<br />
in this insult to the intelligence of the Australian electorate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saying you won't need an increase in indirect.<br />
taxes to achieve a lower deficit?<br />
what we have said is that we will look at the whole question<br />
of the tax base and that is something which the conservative side<br />
of politics has said will need to be done. it's a matter of<br />
common understanding across the political and economic spectrum that<br />
there will need to be a review of the tax base. But if there weret<br />
a situation where there was some increase or enlargement of the<br />
indirect tax base you wouldn't do that without a reduction in the<br />
direct tax base. But what we have done in running this economy<br />
since March of 1983 is not to sit up in Canberra and say, look,<br />
there's the answer, we know what's right. We have deliberately<br />
consulted with the commnunity, with the business community, large and<br />
small busines, and with the trade unions, with welfare organisations<br />
we've done that and out of those processes of consultation we havo<br />
evolved economic policies which have turned this country around from<br />
stagnation to the fastest growth in the world and with equity. NOW<br />
what has been successful in terms of that economic approach since<br />
v, 7q. t . c </p>
<p>P. M. cont... March of ' 83 will be precisely the sort of approach thast<br />
we will adopt after the election in regard to taxation as well as<br />
in regard to economic policies generally.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister do you have a timetable for when and<br />
if the Northern Territory should have Statehood.<br />
No, what you've got to realise is this, that they came to<br />
self government from 1 July 1978. Now look at the facts it's a<br />
population of ( tape break) full statehood tomorrow.<br />
Because full statehood involves certain obligations and commitments<br />
if you're going to have full statehood. Now I would believe that<br />
the sensible thing to do is that a consultation with the member,<br />
who as I say will continue to be Mr Reeves, and with the Northern<br />
Territory Government, that through time we sh6uld talk about the<br />
timetableswhich they think are appropriate. 8ecause full statehood,<br />
as I say, involves not only rights whi-ch are attractive, but it<br />
also involves obligations which at times are not so attractive.<br />
And so my approach in Government will be to say to the people and<br />
the Government of the Northern Territory, well let's talk together<br />
about what your timetable is, what you think is the most appropriate,<br />
rather than seeking to impose some upon them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister when you addressed the ILO in Geneva well<br />
over a year ago now you put forward the idea of communes or kibbutzes<br />
I didn't use the word commune or kibbutz. I mean that's the<br />
shorthand used by others.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well the idea has recently been taken up again by<br />
Senator Robertson and I was wondering if the Government has shelved<br />
it or whether it was still a goer.<br />
No, we've done some work on this. I've had people working<br />
on it. it's still going on. I believe, however, that this is not;<br />
an idea that should be rushed into. I mean I could have been quite<br />
autocratic, if you like, and got the thing going earlier. 3 Ut it<br />
seems to me that we need to have a broader discussion about the<br />
whole concept of employment programs and economic growth and whether<br />
people really want to have that sort of development as part of a<br />
general approach to and attack upon the problems of unemployment.<br />
So it's there. Discussions are going on. But I want the community<br />
to have an ample and relaxed opportunity to talk about this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke will the Goverment be clarifying the land<br />
rights issue before the election.<br />
Well when you say clarify the land rights issue, I don't<br />
believe that you're going to be able to clarify the land rights<br />
issue before the election. What we will do, however, what we'll<br />
continue to do, is that the Minister and myself, and I'm fairly<br />
deeply involved in the processes, will continue what we've been doing<br />
in the last few months. we've been talking with an aboriginal<br />
steering committee. We've been talking-with AMICp the miners. wel've<br />
been talking with the National Farmers Federation, we've been talking<br />
with the States. Because I have the view, if you like, the great;<br />
hope, that this issue can be turned from one which is divisive and<br />
has been-divisive into one around which the Australian people can<br />
take pride... I havc the feeling that underneath some of the rhetoric<br />
that has been going on, some of the passions that have been arouised </p>
<p>P. M. cant...: that overwhelmingly Australians believe that we have<br />
obligations towards the Aboriginal people. And I take, in that<br />
respect, comfort from the overwhelming decision of the Australian<br />
people in 1967, by a great majority they voted to give the Federal<br />
Commonwealth Government responsibilities in this area. Now the<br />
people of Australia in 1967 didn't do that lightly. I think in<br />
making that decision, and you know how reluctant the Australian<br />
people are to change the Constitution, in doing that I think they<br />
reflected then a view that we as a people as a whole had obligations<br />
in this area. Now at the same time the people have come to recognise<br />
that it's not just a question of saying this is what we do for<br />
the aborigines. we have to do it in a way which will carry the<br />
Australian people as a whole with them. Because the worst thing<br />
you could do for the aboriginal people of Australia would be to seek<br />
through the exercise of that Federal power, which the people of<br />
Australia gave to the Federal Government, the worst thing you could<br />
do to the Aboriginal people is say there is that power which the<br />
people gave to us, we're going just to unilaterally to impose that<br />
and then in that process have a situation where the people of Australia<br />
were not satisfied with the way it had been done. So the is that<br />
you should have a Federal Government being prepared to talk with the<br />
States, with the Territory, with people who can be affected like mi~ ners<br />
and farmers, as well as of course the aboriginal people themselves.<br />
So what we're going to do is continue that process and in the event:,<br />
I believe it will be possible to have the people of Australia in<br />
1985 reflecting through those processes the wish that they expressed<br />
in 1967, almost twenty years ago, that there should be a Commonwealth<br />
responsibility in this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the Federal Government give a commitment before<br />
the election to retain the veto on mining..<br />
We will be talking with the people of the Northern Territory<br />
about that. I mean it would be a contradiction of what I said<br />
before that we're going to have consultations and X pre-empt<br />
consultations by saying what the decisions are.<br />
