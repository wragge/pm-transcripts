PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 M4AY 1989<br />
In recent weeks the tragic situation in Lebanon has<br />
deteriorated again, with renewed fighting and accompanying<br />
injuries and deaths of Lebanese people, including many<br />
civilians. Australia's Lebanese community has naturally been gravely<br />
concerned about thi6 situation and I have in recent days met<br />
with representatives of the community, both Christian and<br />
Muslim. Community and religious leaders have given me at<br />
first hand their views on the tragedy, and I have taken the<br />
opportunity to outline the Government's position.<br />
After fourteen years of fighting in Lebanon it is clear that<br />
violence does not provide an answer to the country's<br />
problems; it has failed totally to resolve the basic issues<br />
at stake and cannot be expected now to bring the<br />
confrontation to a conclusion. The human cost of the<br />
violence has been immeasurable and it is clear that only<br />
compromise, accommodation and peaceful political reform can<br />
now bring the fighting to an end.<br />
Eventually, Lebanon must return to a situation where it<br />
fully exercises its sovereignty within its own borders and<br />
becomes again, as it used to be, a haven for people of all<br />
confessions and beliefs, where all communities have<br />
reasonable access to political life and the fruits of<br />
economic prosperity.<br />
For such a goal to be achieved it is essential that violence<br />
be rejected by all groups within Lebanon and that Lebanon's<br />
neighbours play a part in advancing, not spoiling, the<br />
process of reconciliation. This will require the withdrawal<br />
of the Syrian and Israeli forces.<br />
Until that happens it is essential that foreign forces in<br />
Lebanon should not act as participants in the fighting or as<br />
instigators of new phases of conflict. Nothing excuses the<br />
unleashing of mass violence and carnage in the name of<br />
pacification as practiced by Syrian forces in recent weeks.<br />
Those actions will not bring Lebanese to the conference<br />
table but only entrench the more extreme elements on both<br />
sides who have an interest in the final breakdown of all<br />
vestiges of the Lebanese state. </p>
<p>2.<br />
My appeal is to Lebanon's leaders and, especially, to the<br />
ordinary Lebanese, those who have taken shelter in recent<br />
weeks from all t-his madness in cellars and shelters; those<br />
whose voice is silent. My appeal, too, is to the Arab<br />
League leaders who have tried in recent weeks to find some<br />
way to call a halt to this killing, to continue and redouble<br />
their efforts. I have already conveyed to the Arab League,<br />
via the Algerian Ambassador in Canberra, Australia's wish to<br />
do anything we can to help its attempts to find a basis for<br />
a ceasefire and negotiations.<br />
I will also appeal to the United Nations Secretary-General<br />
to keep in touch with Arab efforts and lend support to a<br />
resolution of the immediate and fundamental causes of the<br />
conflict. My final appeal is to Syria to show restraint and ensure<br />
that its forces, for as long as they remain, desist from<br />
destructive action against population centres.<br />
I will be visiting a number of European countries and the<br />
United States in June and will use any opportunities that<br />
arise to help advance international moves towards peace in<br />
Lebanon. In further response to the situation in Lebanon and to the<br />
representations made to the Government by Lebanese community<br />
groups the Government has also decided to provide a<br />
substantial increase in humanitarian aid to Lebanon.<br />
A total amount of $ 500,000 will be provided to the<br />
International Committee of the Red Cross and to the United<br />
Nations for work they are currently doing to assist those<br />
Lebanese who are worst affected by the ongoing strife and<br />
bloodshed. This money will, of course, be allocated,<br />
regardless of any religious or factional boundaries.<br />
The Government will communicate to the International<br />
Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations the views<br />
of the Australian Lebanese community on how the money might<br />
best be spent.<br />
