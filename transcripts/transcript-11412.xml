    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much gentlemen. To the Mayor of Ryde, to all the</p>
<p> other distinguished guests, ladies and gentleman. In May of this year</p>
<p> I will have represented North Ryde in the Federal Parliament for 25</p>
<p> years. And North Ryde is known for a lot of things. It's known</p>
<p> along with other parts of Ryde for having produced some of the most</p>
<p> celebrated Australian sportsmen. It's known for another thing</p>
<p> that's tremendously important today, and that is that from the</p>
<p> very early years that I was representing North Ryde in the Federal</p>
<p> Parliament, as you heard a moment ago, it was the location of pharmaceutical,</p>
<p> technology and other leading-edge manufacturing and supplying companies</p>
<p> in Australia. And over the years it has grown into an area of Sydney,</p>
<p> and an area of Australia, which is really renowned for providing a</p>
<p> very welcoming and appropriate environment for the establishment of</p>
<p> businesses of that kind. And over the years it's become quite</p>
<p> correctly known as very much a pharmaceutical, medical and high-tech</p>
<p> location area, not only in Sydney but throughout Australia. And a</p>
<p> lot of the credit for that is due to the very beckoning environment</p>
<p> provided by the local council and provided by the community generally.</p>
<p>And I want to say to both Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, and to Jannsen-Cilag,</p>
<p> how delighted I am as the local member, as well as the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia, at the very large investment that both companies are</p>
<p> making in this joint headquarters that I'll have the privilege</p>
<p> in a few moments of opening.</p>
<p>Could I say to both companies, and to all of you, that you couldn't</p>
<p> be opening a new building, establishing a new asset, and embarking</p>
<p> upon either a new business venture or an expansion of an existing</p>
<p> venture at a better time economically in Australia. I've got</p>
<p> to say to you that the general economic conditions in Australia at</p>
<p> the present time are better than at any time in the 25 years that</p>
<p> I've been in Federal Parliament. There's never any point</p>
<p> in public life when you have an unassailable fact to assert, there's</p>
<p> never any point in public life in being reluctant to assert that unassailable</p>
<p> fact. Because strange as it is I found in public life that your commentators</p>
<p> and your reviewers and your critics are always marked in their reluctance</p>
<p> to assert those unassailable facts. So we are living in very good</p>
<p> economic times.</p>
<p>We are living in times of very low inflation, we are living in times</p>
<p> of very low interest rates, we are living in a time when the Australian</p>
<p> economy has really been able to see off the worst of the Asian economic</p>
<p> downturn. That doesn't mean to say that we should be complacent,</p>
<p> but it does mean to say that we should recognise the measure of the</p>
<p> strength of those economic conditions. And now is a very good time</p>
<p> for Australia to tell the rest of the world how attractive it is for</p>
<p> companies to establish their regional headquarters in Australia. How</p>
<p> attractive it is for Australia to be increasingly seen around the</p>
<p> world as a financial centre in this part of the world. And one of</p>
<p> the goals that I set the Government at the time of the last election</p>
<p> was to see somewhere in Australia, and a Prime Minister of a Federation</p>
<p> I never try and choose between competing locations, somewhere in Australia</p>
<p> become the alternative financial centre to Tokyo in the Asian-Pacific</p>
<p> region. And when you look at the low inflation we have, you look at</p>
<p> the low interest rates, you look at the stable legal system we have,</p>
<p> the stable political system we have, rambunctious though it may be</p>
<p> on occasions it is nonetheless stable. When you look at the fact that</p>
<p> we have a very very prudentially well supervised and well regulated</p>
<p> banking system, where we have a corporate governance code which is</p>
<p> second to none around the world; you have a lifestyle that is second</p>
<p> to none around the world; you have a cross structure for living in</p>
<p> the major cities of Australia which is now increasingly competitive</p>
<p> with the cross structures of cities like Singapore and Hong Kong,</p>
<p> indeed far more competitive; all of that adds up to a situation where</p>
<p> Australia is a prime location, not only as a regional financial centre,</p>
<p> but it is a prime location as a business financial centre generally.</p>
<p> And with the passage of the Government's taxation reforms which</p>
<p> will make trading and securities in this country and financial operations</p>
<p> even less burdened by taxation than they are at the present time,</p>
<p> we will be adding yet another element to the attractiveness of Australia</p>
<p> and the attractiveness of Sydney, of Melbourne, of all the cities</p>
<p> of Australia as a financial and business location.</p>
<p>The other thing that I want to say about both of the companies, who</p>
<p> I'm very pleased to honour today and their contribution to Australia</p>
<p> of course, is that both of them are very much involved in an activity</p>
<p> and in an industry which goes to the heart of the quality of life,</p>
<p> indeed the existence of life, and the contribution that both of those</p>
<p> companies are making to medical science, the contribution that they</p>
<p> are making to the relief of human suffering, and the contribution</p>
<p> that those who work for them are making to the health care industry</p>
<p> in Australia generally.</p>
<p>There's a lot of criticism of health care in this country and</p>
<p> that is to be expected in a democratic society. One observation I</p>
<p> would make about Australia's health care system today is simply</p>
<p> this: there may be flaws in it and undoubtedly there are, but I don't</p>
<p> know of any nation on Earth that has a perfect health care system.</p>
<p> And I don't know of any country on Earth where a person of average</p>
<p> means is better cared for if that person becomes unexpectedly ill</p>
<p> than in Australia. I have to say very bluntly, I'd rather see</p>
<p> a person of average means have a health problem in this country than</p>
<p> in just about any other country in the world. And I think with all</p>
<p> of the criticism that is sometimes made about the health care system</p>
<p> in this country we ought to remember that. We ought to remember the</p>
<p> quality of the doctors that we have in this country. We ought to remember</p>
<p> the quality of the medical scientists we have in this country. We</p>
<p> ought to remember the quality and the dedication of the nurses and</p>
<p> the other health care professionals that we have in this country.</p>
<p> So all of these things need to be kept in proper perspective.</p>
<p>But I thank Johnson &amp; Johnson medical. I thank Jannsen-Cilag for</p>
<p> the contribution that they are making to the local community, for</p>
<p> the contribution that they are making to Australian society and to</p>
<p> the role that they are playing in providing in their own particular</p>
<p> way for a first quality health care for Australian citizens.</p>
<p>I thank them for their investment in Australia's future. I welcome</p>
<p> them in their new headquarters to the electorate of Bennelong. To</p>
<p> the district of North Ryde, you remain very, very welcome and very,</p>
<p> very popular corporate citizens in this part of Australia.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
