FOR PRESS 24 OCTOBER 1977<br />
OPENING OF ENTERPRISE WEEK, SYDNEY<br />
At the outset, I want to congratulate Enterprise Australia on the<br />
way it has set about its task of promoting the cause of free<br />
enterprise in this country. Too often a vital cause is neglected<br />
and gradually eroded because people take it fo~ r granted.<br />
The overwhelming advantages to all Australians of our free<br />
enterprise system are too vital to be left unsaid.<br />
The entire community benefits from an efficient and prosperous<br />
private sector. It provides the means of achieving a real increase<br />
in our wealth, in our standards of living, in job opportunities,<br />
and in-our capacity-to-help those in need. The profits made<br />
by private industry provide new investment and create new jobs.<br />
They directly benefit vast numbers of people, not only the<br />
hundreds of thousands of Australian shareholders, but the millions<br />
of insurance and superannuation policy holders whose funds are<br />
invested in public company securities. And of course, company<br />
taxes raised from business profits provide much of the resources<br />
for government to satisfy the community's needs in social welfare,<br />
education, defence, communications, and other essential areas.<br />
But Australians' commitment to free enterprise is not founded<br />
simply o ' n the fact that it is the most efficient economic system<br />
available, or the most efficient provider of the resources<br />
required to produce a better life for all Australians, though<br />
it is both of these. There is a consensus of support for Tree<br />
enterprise because it is the most democratic system. It confers<br />
on the individual maximum freedom of choice; it allows the<br />
individual maximum opportunity to innovate, to strike out on<br />
his own, to try out his own schemes and dreams; it makes<br />
the individual consumer the ultimate arbiter of taste, the<br />
ultimate allocator of resources.<br />
A socialist would, of course, take a contrary view. To him the<br />
allocation of resources must be determined not by ordinary Australian<br />
through the free market, but by the bureaucracy in accordance<br />
with some allegedly all-knowing national plan. A blueprint<br />
for just such a system is not hard to find it is contained<br />
in the new economic planning policy adopted by the Labor Party<br />
at their Perth Conference last June. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Let me read to you a few extracts from that policy.<br />
" Market forces alone will not create the environment necessary<br />
to achieve our objectives."<br />
" Labor will initiate national planning to relate the performance<br />
of both the public and private sectors to the goals of society,.<br />
and to give direction to the allocation of resources between<br />
various sectors in the economy."<br />
" The priorities andtargets of the various plans will be determined<br />
by Government..."<br />
" A Department ( will be) created with the responsibility to<br />
coordinate preparation and monitoring of plans.".<br />
" Labor will set the overall objectives Government will intervene<br />
where necessary to reach national objectives."<br />
" Public enterprise is particularly to be established or extended<br />
in the fields of banking, consumer affairs,-insurance, finance,<br />
marketing, housing, stevedoring, transport and in areas of<br />
social monopoly."<br />
I believe these words speak for themselves. What Labor offers<br />
is a vast bureaucracy armed with vast powers to impose controls<br />
on the daily lives of us all. The contrast with free enterprise<br />
could not be clearer or more stark.<br />
Labor's policy was sponsored by the Shadow Treasurer.<br />
It is a policy binding on all Labor Members of Parliament; it is<br />
a policy which I believe will be rejected out of hand by all<br />
Australians who value their freedom, who want an economy that<br />
produces more of what people want rather than what Governments<br />
think they want.<br />
The Commonwealth Government does have a vital role to play in<br />
providing individuals and business with strong incentives to work,<br />
to invest and to innovate. Government too has a most important<br />
guiding, managing-role, and it must actively protect the<br />
disadvantaged and those such as small business or the consumerwho<br />
in some circumstances are in an unequal bargaining position.<br />
What is vital is that the Government does not intervene to the<br />
point where individuals and business are placed in shackles.<br />
Yet this was precisely the position when we came to office.<br />
The burden was so great that individuals were losing the<br />
incentive to work, and to innovate. The economy had been so<br />
mismanaged that inflation and interest rates were up, profits<br />
and investment were down. In 1974/ 75 there was actually a fall<br />
in real national product. .3 </p>
<p>The extent of these failures of Government meant that there<br />
could be no speedy and painless solution. We did not promise<br />
an overnight recovery. What we did say we could dowas to<br />
play our proper part as Government in creating the conditions<br />
under which the private sector could revive and recovery its<br />
momentum. In less than two years so as to restore the basic<br />
incentive to work and to give people greater freedom to make their<br />
own spending decision we have made substantial cuts in<br />
personal income tax and reformed the rate scale.<br />
This year alone tax indexation and the reforms in the last Budget<br />
save individuals $ 1371 million in tax, next year the total will<br />
be $ 1857 million. We have encouraged businesses to invest<br />
by introducing the investment allowance, and allowed companies<br />
to introduce in part a form of inflation accounting for stocks<br />
when calculating tax.<br />
For the mining and petroleum industries we have restored the<br />
incentive for development and exploration. Company profits<br />
have recovered up 23 percent in 1976/ 77. In response to<br />
the improving outlook, business investment plans have grown<br />
greatly. Over the next 3 years $ 5000 million ( in 1976/ 77 prices)<br />
is expected to be spent on large manufacturing and mining projects<br />
in addition to normal basic investment within those industries.<br />
Production -has-responded in 1976/ 77, gross non-farm product<br />
went up 3.7 percent. In its own area of spending, the<br />
Government has imposed the most rigorous restraint. The marked<br />
reduction in the deficit we have achieved was necessary to<br />
provide the scope for the tax cuts I have mentioned.<br />
It was also an essential step in maintaining firm control over<br />
the rate of growth of money.<br />
There has been no more important part of the Government's.<br />
strategy than the defeat of inflation. We are well on the way to<br />
achieving that objective too. In 1975 inflation was 16-17 percent.<br />
So far this year, inflation has been running at an annual rate<br />
of just over 9 percent and it is falling. The 2 percent<br />
increase in the CPI announced last week was the lowest<br />
for 5 years, apart from the quarter Medibank was introduced..<br />
For the first time in 4 years the rate of increase in the CPI<br />
has been held below 2.5 percent in each of three successive<br />
quarters. There could hardly be clearer confirmation of the<br />
success of the Government's general economic strategy than this<br />
result in turning around the inflationary spiral.<br />
It shows the benefit to be obtained from firm control of<br />
Government spending, from sensible monetary policies, and from<br />
wage restraint.<br />
This steady decline in inflationary expectations will strengthen<br />
our economy in many ways. Our export and manufacturing industries<br />
will be in a stronger competitive position. The gains from<br />
devaluation of last year which are now evident in our trading<br />
figures have not been dissipated in higher inflation as our<br />
critics said would happen). We can expect a consolidation in our L_ </p>
<p>4.<br />
external trade balance. Besiness and consumers will continue<br />
to gain in confidence, and the downward movement in interest<br />
rates will, gather momentum, assisting inVettment generally, and<br />
small business and-the building industry in particular.<br />
We cannot. af ford to relax. We are determined to keep inflation.<br />
moving further downwards. The full benefits of this strategy<br />
will become increasingly apparent as time goes on. The<br />
continuing health-of the private sector ultimately depends,<br />
not on government,, but on the men and women who work in it.<br />
IEt is imperative that there be the maximum possible co-operation<br />
and harmony between everyone involved in any one enterprise.<br />
it is not. enoogh that the management strive for higher performance,~<br />
productivity and profits this must be the goal of every employee.<br />
Such a concerted and united effort can only be achieved when there<br />
is complete communication through all levels of a company'sa<br />
structure when management takes the trouble to explain to<br />
everyone on the payroll where their business is heading and<br />
why. Such commwunication has not always been present in Australian<br />
business, and I particularly welcome Enterprise Australia's<br />
campaigni to get companies to report regularly n~ ot only to their<br />
shareholders but to their staff too.<br />
Mr. Chairman,-never was it so necessary to restate and reaffirm<br />
our commitment to our free enterprise system. There are serious<br />
limitations in the ability of any government to produce a betterlife<br />
for its citizens. Free enterpr * ise places the ultimate<br />
choices, the ultimoate responsibilities, where they rightly<br />
belong with each individual Australian.<br />
There is another matter which places ultimate responsibility on<br />
every individual Australian, and it is a matter which seems to have<br />
bemused our political opponenrts and the press over the past<br />
several-weeks. It is the subject of an election-I have always<br />
made it plain that this country needs stability in government.<br />
over our period in office we have pxovided that. As the<br />
constitution.' now stands, if both the Senate and the House<br />
of Representatives elections are to be held at the end of the<br />
different terms of both Houses, we will end up with a half Senate<br />
election in May and a general election just seven months later in<br />
the following December. That is, two elections virtually in<br />
twelve months from now. Over 60% of Australians voted at the<br />
recent referendum to alter this situation. But despite the<br />
majority of Australians in favour of the proposition it did not<br />
get the-necessary support in the majority of States.<br />
The Government has been concerned to reduce the number of elections,<br />
and therefore we have been looking at the options open to us to<br />
make sure that the next Senate and House of Representatives<br />
elections are held at the same time. The first possibility of<br />
doing this would be in December. The second would be around<br />
April or May; over the last couple of days as part of the<br />
continuing process of consultation with my Ministerial colleagues<br />
there have been discussions about the best course for Australia.<br />
our principal concern is to maintain the thrust of our economic<br />
policies which are so clearly working to the advantage of all<br />
Australians. / We believe </p>
<p>A<br />
We believe Australia should not be bedevilled by two Federal<br />
elections in the next twelve months, which does point us,<br />
therefore, towards December or April/ may for a simultaneous<br />
election. Some commentators and political opponents have ' attributed to<br />
me, firm and committed views in relation to this. In this<br />
matter I have not expressed a finrm view to anyone or at any time.<br />
But'the matter must be determ~ ined shortly as it will be.<br />
Our judgemnent will be based on what we believe to be in the<br />
best interests of Australia to sustain the present economic<br />
recovery, and to maintain the impetus of our very necessary<br />
economic programmes.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure in declaring<br />
Enterprise Week open. </p>
