PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CQNFP. ENCE AT<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA ON<br />
18TH FEBRUARY 1975.<br />
QUESTION WHITLAM QUESTION The N. S. W. Premier, Mr Tom Lewis, has announced that<br />
he intends to fill the Senate vacancy with a non-<br />
Labor Senator. Sir, what's your reaction to this,<br />
and secondly, is there any action that your Government<br />
can take to ensure that the convention is observed?<br />
My attitude to the matter has been made quite plain,<br />
of course, for very many years. I was a member of<br />
the Constitution Review. Committee in the late 1950s<br />
which unanimously said that, where there was a casual<br />
vacancy then, and the former Senator belonged to a<br />
political party, then the new Senator appointed by<br />
the State Government or the State Parliament should<br />
belong to the same Party as the vacating Senator.<br />
I've always held that view. And it is also, I<br />
gather, the view of every Senator at the moment,<br />
and it used to be, hitherto, always has been the view<br />
of everybody who has been Premier. So there's no<br />
need to ask what my view is. I gather the Liberals<br />
in this Parliament in the House of Representatives<br />
also believe that Mr Justice Murphy should be<br />
succeeded by a Labor Senator. Perhaps I might<br />
quote what Mr Snedden, the Leader of the Liberal<br />
Party in this Parliament, said, I gather, at Randwick<br />
on Sunday: Billie Mackie Snedden, have no power<br />
to determine who that successor will be. -I have no<br />
power under the Liberal Party Constitution. 1 have<br />
no power under the Australian Constitution". Anc<br />
then he says something about that you press people<br />
find it hard to understand this. Then he says,<br />
" I have stated my view clearly, frankly, without fear,<br />
and without seeking favour. That is my view, and I<br />
maintain it, and if some of the commentators had the<br />
merest teeny-weeniest understanding of the Australian<br />
Constitution, and of the Liberal Party Constitution<br />
they would understand where the decision lies". T<br />
don't know where that leaves Billie Mackie Snedden.<br />
He would make a great Prime Minister. That is, the<br />
Liaader of what would be the majority numbers in the<br />
Federal Parliament would have no authority whatever<br />
in a case such as a casual-vacancy in the Senate.<br />
And but it does seem to ' accord with general respect<br />
in which he is held by Mr Lewis, by Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
and by Mr Anthony. Because all of them have disagreed<br />
with him on matters of oil prices, and beef or coal<br />
exports, or Senate replacements within the last week.<br />
And he lets them go their own merry way.<br />
Does any Premier have any power to conduct international<br />
trade agreements, or to conduct international<br />
trade agreements on behalf of his State with another<br />
country? </p>
<p>WHITLAM QUEST ION<br />
WHITLAM QUEST ION Well no other country has ever thought so, and<br />
until the last week, I don't believe any Premier<br />
had that illusion either. The Federal Parliament<br />
is the one that has the authority over trade and<br />
commerce with other countries and among the States.<br />
That has always been the case. And here again,<br />
Mr Snedden himself has said it, but of course,<br />
apparently he has no power of persuasion over<br />
these errant Premiers. But of course, it's not<br />
just a question of what Queenslanders may think<br />
of their Premier. I notice that Mr Bjelke-Petersen,<br />
on I think it was, he wants to sell<br />
Queensland beef. He doesn't want the Japanese who<br />
want Queensland coal getting their beef from New<br />
Zealand or Tasmania. He was down in Tasmania just<br />
over a week ago, trying to rescusitate the Country<br />
Party, or National Party, in Tasmania.<br />
But the fact that he makes this reference shows the<br />
absurdity of it. Other countries-buy Australian<br />
beef. They want that beef to be of acceptable<br />
standard and the national Government has to ensure<br />
those standards. Now you just can't take our<br />
commodities, whether they're mineral or pastoral<br />
or agricultural commodities, and classify them<br />
according to State compartments. We sink or swim<br />
as a nation. And Premiers have no international<br />
standing at all. None of them ever have. They<br />
certainl~ y have functions, and important functions<br />
within Australia. But internationally, no Premier<br />
* has any standing whatever. Premiers, for'instance,<br />
have no standing with the British Government,<br />
except as heads of government of British coloni6O.<br />
Do you have any plans, or are there any plans, to<br />
appoint other Senators to august positions, such as<br />
ambassadors or to the High Court?<br />
No. Incidentally, there have been other appointments<br />
of this character by our predecessors. You remember<br />
Senator Spicer was appointed as a judge. Senator<br />
Annabel Rankin was appointed as an ambassador.<br />
Senator Prowse chose to retire before the end of his<br />
term, aiid he was replaced by another Country Party<br />
Senator. This was only early last year, about 12<br />
months ago. Now Mr Anthony, the Leader of the Country<br />
Party telephoned Mr Tonkin, the Premier of Western<br />
Australia, to make sure that if Senator Prowse, a<br />
Country Party Senator, retired before the end of his<br />
term, would Mr Tonkin replace him with a Country Party<br />
Senator. And Mr Tonkin said, of course he would. He<br />
would heed the convention.<br />
not only appointments of this nature for appointments<br />
of this nature as well as for the convention of<br />
replacing with a Senator of the same Party? / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WHITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM QUESTION<br />
WHITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM I don't believe that, since proportional representation<br />
was introduced for the Australian Senate, that there has<br />
ever been a Senator who has not been replaced by a<br />
Senator of his own Party. There has never been such<br />
a case. Senator Murphy's resignation produced the 26th<br />
casual vacancy. The previous 25, that is, since<br />
proportional representation was introduced in 1949,<br />
had all been succeeded by persons belonging to their<br />
own Party. 10 of them were appointed by a State where<br />
they were political opponents of the Government of the<br />
State.<br />
Prime Minister, are you considering moving to have a<br />
referendum to take the power of the States to appoint<br />
Senators in a casual vacancy, away from them? And<br />
secondly, are you considering a referendum removing<br />
the power of the Senate to block Supply?<br />
No. I suppose your question derives from an article*<br />
in one of the newspapers which said that a couple of<br />
university lecturers had written to me on this subject.<br />
So, insofar as the matter's come in correspondence, I<br />
can be said to be considering it. But a copy of their<br />
letter was also given to the press, so that's the<br />
origin of that story.<br />
Mr LEWIS has indicated that his appointment may be<br />
what may be called non-political. Is such a thing<br />
possible? It would be extraordinarily difficult, I imagine, for<br />
a politician to find a non-political appointee. I<br />
think Mr Lewis went further I think he said heA-iould<br />
appoint a political neuter. I'd assume that we would<br />
not only have a Senator Withers, but a Senator Wethers.<br />
The Sydney Morning Herald in a leader this morning<br />
suggested that perhaps Mr Lewis might delay appointing<br />
a Senator at all until the next elections, which<br />
they seem to think might be an acceptable solution.<br />
Do you think that would be an acceptable solution?<br />
Well I naturally regard any suggestion by the editorial<br />
wr-iters of the Sydney Morning Herald with the greatest<br />
respect and reverence. I notice on this matter, the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald is the only newspaper in the<br />
whole of Australia which has given any editorial<br />
support to Mr Lewis. Every other metropolitan newspaper<br />
has editorially condemned him.<br />
Sir, how much longer are you going to tolerate<br />
Mr Stonehouse using Australia as a sanctuary?<br />
I don't like commenting on individuals on an occasion<br />
like this. If a question like this was asked in the<br />
Parliament, I would require it to be put on notice.<br />
Now a question was asked of the Minister for Labor and<br />
Immigration about this, at question time today.<br />

QUESTION<br />
WH ITLAM<br />
QUEST ION<br />
* WHITLAM<br />
QUESTION WH ITLAM<br />
QUESTION You have his answer to it. I don't know all the<br />
details of these matters. As I understand it,<br />
Mr Stonehouse, has committed no breach of<br />
Australian laws. As I understand it, until I<br />
don't know what's happened this afternoon no<br />
country has sought to extradite him. There are<br />
procedures for extradition if he's broken any<br />
laws of any other country. As I understand it,<br />
he has not broken any laws of our country. I know<br />
it's a very easy thing on which to comment. Anything<br />
I said on this subject would get very great<br />
coverage. You don't mind if I don't rise to that<br />
lure.<br />
Do you see any merit in those two referenda?<br />
I ha~ ien't considered them. I have one referendum<br />
proposal before the Parliament which I think is a<br />
very urgent and necessary one. Namely, that whenever<br />
there is an election for the House of<br />
Representatives, there should also be an election<br />
for that half of the Senate which is first due to<br />
face the people. We must bring to an end this<br />
absurd situation where we have an election a<br />
national election every year and a half at the<br />
most. Mr Prime Minister, Do you have under consideration<br />
any plans to delay the Supply bill or in any other<br />
Way circumvent the Senate's rather easy way of<br />
sending the Government to the people?<br />
My whole procedure is to act according to the<br />
ordinary practices and proprieties in these matters.<br />
Supply will be sought in the ordinary way. If the<br />
Senate chooses to reject Supply, that will be another<br />
breach of Constitutional conventions. I think we<br />
ought to realise that the constant suggestion that<br />
the Senate may reject Supply, as it threatened to do<br />
in April last year, is no justification for refusing<br />
Supply. We should never accept that this is a<br />
proper or a normal or a principled thing to do. It<br />
has not, it had never happened in Australia before.<br />
The fact that it has happened once does not make it<br />
proper to do it or to threaten it again.<br />
Does that mean, Prime Minister, that the Opposition<br />
if you had any say in it, the Labor Party in Opposition<br />
would not reject Supply in the Senate if it had the<br />
numbers? When we were in opposition, and this proposal to<br />
reject Supply was put, I successfully opposed it.<br />
I was talking, Sir, in the future tense. </p>
<p>( I F<br />
QUESTION WHITLAM T. nl' ontenip Late I am not goin* to hypothesise<br />
on that nmitter. You know what I have done. In 1967<br />
t3' ere was this suggestion. You remember it it was<br />
in the context of post and telegraph charges, and<br />
there was the suggestion in the Australian Labor<br />
Party in the Caucus, then in Opposition that we<br />
should vote against the money Bill. And I successfully<br />
led the opposition against that move.<br />
You have spoken very strongly today, Prime Minister,<br />
against two State Premiers on the stands that they've<br />
taken on two issues that we've spoken about here<br />
today. And you have obviously taken great delight<br />
in their disagreement with Mr Snedden. But do you<br />
think in any way that Mr Lewis and Mr Bjelke-Pctersen<br />
do, in fact, represent the views of the people of<br />
their States their stands on the beef and coal and<br />
on the Senate vacancy.<br />
No, I don't think they do. But what does appal me<br />
let's assume that Mr Bjelke-Petersen does represent<br />
the views of Queenslanders on this matter. I do<br />
believe that Australians in general should understand<br />
the implications of what he is putting. It is not,<br />
I believe, acceptable to Australians to say that, if<br />
our biggest customer, Japan doesn't buy beef from<br />
Queensland, then Queensland will not sell coal to<br />
Japan. After all, coal comes from other States,<br />
beef comes from other States. But surely, in<br />
international trade, we act as one nation.. But it's<br />
really an idle speculation, because Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
has been condemned on all hands by this or should I<br />
say Mr Snedden and Mir Peacock have begged to difrer<br />
from Mr Bjelke-Petersen. They don't agree with him.<br />
The fact is that any Australian Government could<br />
prevent this course of action by any State Premier.<br />
The any Prime Minister, any Australian Government,<br />
the Australian Parliament have authorith over the<br />
trade and commerce with other countries and among<br />
the States. And if they choose to act or legislate<br />
then any State action or legislation would be<br />
nullified. It would be void to the extent of any<br />
inconsistency. So Mr Bjelke-Petersen should know<br />
that he couldn't do it. The difficulty is that, in<br />
order to attract some support, presumably in his own<br />
State, he is creating unnecessary tensions between<br />
Queensland and the other States and he's also casting<br />
a cloud over the our relations with other countries.<br />
I think, however, Japan knows quite clearly with what<br />
Government in Australia it has to have all its<br />
relations. / 6 </p>
<p>QUESTION WHITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM QUEST ION<br />
WHITLAM QUESTION WH ITLAM When will you expect this Session's Supply Bills to<br />
be introduced into Parliament?<br />
At the ordinary time.<br />
Mr Whitlam, you mentioned before that when Senator<br />
Prowse retired from the Senate, that Mr Anthony<br />
contacted Mr Tonkin to make sure that the normal<br />
convention would be followed. Did you contact Mr<br />
Lewis to take the same precautions?<br />
No. The only conversation I have had with Mr Lewis<br />
on this matter was by telephone on Sunday week. I<br />
told him that a letter was being delivered as the<br />
Constitution requires, by the President of the<br />
Senate, to the Governor of New South Wales. And<br />
I said I thought he would like to know, because he<br />
would have to advise the Governor as to his response.<br />
And that's the only conversation I have had with<br />
Mr Lewis on this matter. I gather, from the newspapers<br />
that he then rang the Premier of Victoria,<br />
Mr Hamer, who gave him certain advice, which Mr<br />
Lewis chose to ignore.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, do you approve of guns being taken<br />
to the Cabinet Room? Were you aware last Friday that<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen took an armed bodyguard into<br />
the Cabinet Room? Do you know if the Queensland<br />
Premier obtained permission from the presiding officers<br />
of the Parliament to bring an armed man into the<br />
precincts of Parliament House? And do yop1 intend to<br />
have members of the Queensland Party frisked at the<br />
next conference?<br />
I believe nobody was in Parliament House. The<br />
presiding officers or the Treasurer and I who<br />
respectively presided over the Loans Council and<br />
the Premiers' Conference were informed that Mr<br />
Bjelke-Petersen had an armed body guard with him.<br />
I don't propose to take any action about this<br />
matter. I should imagine Mr Bjelke-Petersen would<br />
have got the message here that no posses are required;<br />
Prime minister, there have been suggestions from a<br />
number of quarters that the Government should take a<br />
much tougher stand this year. If the Opposition does<br />
try to block Supply, that it should resist that, and<br />
that it should try to stay in office. If Supply is<br />
rejected, do you think this is possible? And is this<br />
being considered by the Government?<br />
I have seen such speculations. I'm not going to<br />
respond to them. / 7 </p>

QUESTION WHITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM QUESTION WH ITLAM<br />
QUESTION WH ITLAM<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, following the Federal Conference<br />
decision at Terrigal on the Provisional Revolutionary<br />
Government of South Vietnam, have you had an<br />
application from them for the establishment of any<br />
sort of an office here?<br />
No. Does the initiative, in fact, rest with them?<br />
Yes.<br />
What is the progress, if any, on the take over of<br />
the State Railway system? Have you come to any<br />
financial arrangement with South Australia? And<br />
if not, when is such arrangement likely to come<br />
about? There were some pretty thorough discussions on this<br />
matter at Terrigal between Mr Dunstan and Mr Vergo<br />
the &amp;. LMister for Transport and also<br />
between Mr Nielson, the Tasmanian Deputy Premier<br />
and Mr Batt, the former Tasmanian Minister for<br />
Transport, with Dr. Cairns and Mr Jones, my minister<br />
for Transport and me. And I would be pretty<br />
confident that the discussions which have gone on<br />
for over two years now will soon be successfully<br />
concluded. Sir, following your rejection for the second time<br />
of a visa for Mr Wallace to come' here, do you<br />
think it likely that the Australian tour of Southp<br />
Africa will proceed?<br />
I think it will probably not proceed. After all,<br />
the Australian Cricket Board of Control would be<br />
influenced very much by the decision of the<br />
International Cricket Association in July. last<br />
year, that there should be no tours of South Africa<br />
until cricket there was multi-racial. Furthermore,<br />
if Australia were to send an XI to South Africa,<br />
it is quite likely that no Australian XI would be<br />
received in the Carribean countries j Indiarr<br />
Pakistan or that any teams from those countries<br />
would visit Australia. There's a very great deal<br />
at stake in this matter as far as cricket is concerned,<br />
quite apart from the general question of what the<br />
nation's attitude should be and the extent to which<br />
the Government should safeguard the nation's<br />
interests and reputation.<br />
Prime Minister, did Cabinet accept~ a proposal yesterday<br />
from Mr Johnson, for additional expenditure on welfare<br />
housing? If so, for how much? And secondly was<br />
the proposal vetted by the Expenditure Review<br />
Committee? / 8 </p>

WHITLAM QUESTION<br />
WHIT LAM<br />
QUEST ION<br />
WHIT LAM<br />
QUESTION There will be, quite soon, a Bill for additional<br />
housing grants to the States under the Housing<br />
Agreement, partly for Housing Commission or Trust<br />
houses and partly for Home Builders' account loans.<br />
And half of the amount to be appropriated was<br />
announced last November. I mightn't have the<br />
particular States precisely in mind, but I think<br />
in November, the additional amounts were announced<br />
for Qld., S. A. and in respect to housing commission<br />
houses, N. S. W. There will now be home savings<br />
home builders' accounts grants for announced for<br />
each of those States, and both categories for<br />
Victoria. But this is under an arrangement which<br />
was made last June. You will remember at the<br />
Premiers' Conference last June when preliminary<br />
grants were announced by my Government under the<br />
housing agreement with the States. We stated<br />
that if additional amounts could be spent in<br />
erecting houses we would consult with the States<br />
again. And when the States made such proposals,<br />
we did consult with them. That was the arrangement<br />
concerning housing agreement finance. You remember<br />
that in 1973, we allocated record amounts of money<br />
for housing agreement purposes, but the States in<br />
fact, built fewer houses than they built for those<br />
purposes for about 10 years. So in June last, we<br />
said we didn't mind, in effect, how much money was<br />
provided, as long as it could be spent in housing.<br />
Not just put in Trust Accounts.<br />
To take up the point on the Expenditure Committee,<br />
I think this the first question I think you've ever<br />
addressed me. For months.<br />
Two weeks, I think sir. To take up the Expenditure<br />
Committee, it met, I understand, on Thursday last<br />
week, and then you told the Premiers on Friday<br />
that any " ons", as they say, would have to be matched<br />
by " offs". When might we expect to hear what the<br />
" offs" are?<br />
I don't think you will hear them. They occupied<br />
quite a deal of the Cabinet's attention yesterday.<br />
Could you give us some idea of the amount of money<br />
involved.<br />
No. Mr Whitlam, in the light of the decision yesterday<br />
on the Capital Gains Tax, or land tax, could you<br />
comment on a proposal put forward by Mr Cameron<br />
I think about 18 months ago, that the Cabinet<br />
considered a Holding Tax on land and a flat rate<br />
holding tax on unoccupied land? / 9 </p>

QUEST ION<br />
WHITLAM QUESTION<br />
WHITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM QUEST ION I don't remember the proposal.<br />
Could you amplify that point about how we won't find<br />
out about the " offs"?<br />
No, I am not going to announce what proposals were<br />
in Minister's submissions which have now been<br />
deferred or modified. After consideration and<br />
report by the Expenditure Review Committee. That's<br />
what I have said.<br />
I thought decisions had been made.<br />
No. I should I thought it was clear to you what<br />
was involved in the Expenditure Review Committee's<br />
operations. It is to look at proposals between<br />
Budgets. The Budget is the Budget discussions<br />
are the~ appropriate time to fix priorities between<br />
competing claims. And this Committee will particularly<br />
scrutinise submissions by ministers for the<br />
Cabinet which would involve additional expenditure<br />
this financial year that is, before the next<br />
Budget discussions are held.<br />
Did Cabinet yesterday, decide to cut back on<br />
existing programs?<br />
It scrutinised the prospects of expending the full<br />
amount allocated for some programs.<br />
Are you of the opinion that statements being made<br />
by'Messrs. Anthony, Lewis and Bjelke-Petersen since<br />
Mr Justice Murphy was sworn in to the High Court<br />
were in contempt of Court? And if so, will you<br />
refer them to the Attorney-General?<br />
Yes No. I believe the dignity of the High Court<br />
would be better served by ignoring the comments<br />
which the gentlemen that you name have made.<br />
On the expenditure question, Sir, isn't one of<br />
the aims of your announcement about the Committee<br />
of Ministers to curtail expenditure? That it<br />
would be providing something of the sort of<br />
leadership-which is required for the States to<br />
curtail their own expenditure? To let the private<br />
sector know that you have an answer to the<br />
cr4. ticism that Government expected to have<br />
expenditure was going unchecked? Sir, why can't<br />
we find out, in aggregate terms, the amount of<br />
money that this mysterious committee administers is<br />
saving? </p>
<p>QUESTION W7HITLAM QUESTION WHITLAM Now, I am not going to respond to your kind invitation.<br />
The fact is, that if I was naming any of these items,<br />
I'd immediately be swamped with pleas to contirmr<br />
particular item which is being c1eferred. You know<br />
that perfectly well, so I am no't going to..<br />
Sir, does that mean<br />
No, you have had your question.<br />
Well, to follow up, does that mean, sir, that you are<br />
no longer on the election hustings in asking Mr<br />
Snedden to stipulate on what he would cut back on<br />
expenditure?<br />
Well, I notice that he is proposing to cut back<br />
expenditure on tertiary education, to introduce<br />
fees and to cut education allowances. I' you<br />
can s&amp; e think you asked him a few questions on<br />
this what was it, Monday wasn't it? And he came<br />
out with that bright idea. I can assure you that<br />
we will not be bringing back tertiary fees,<br />
technical fees. We will not be retrenching<br />
educational allowances for those that can survive<br />
the means test which is there in operation. </p>
