Speech by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt,<br />
at Commonwealth Correspondents' Association Lunche \ a'f<br />
at Waldorf Hotel. London .1<br />
I have always been a Commonwvealth man as long as I have been<br />
in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but using the first reference<br />
to Commonwealth in that very much broader sense which embraces the<br />
many Parliaments of our Commonwealth of nations, and indeed I have<br />
seen that number grow very considerably from my first Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Conference here in London in 194, w'" hen the only three<br />
new Commonwealth countries admitted to the old club were India,<br />
Pakistan and Ceylon, to the time today when those of us who belonged<br />
to the old Commonralth find ourselves historically at any rate in a<br />
very small minority among the newer countries which have secured their<br />
independence and Cormmonw. ealth status since that time. These are days<br />
in which we ask ourselves what does the Comonwealth stand for at<br />
the present timie. Some of the unifying factors seem either to have<br />
disappeared or faded in strength. We can't claic: as we look around<br />
the Commonvwealth today that the thing that is holding us together is<br />
a common devotion to Parliamentary democracy, because in some of the<br />
countries of the Commonwealth we haven't got Parliamentary democracy<br />
and in some where Parliaments function they do not function along<br />
the lines of the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster. They may have<br />
the standing orders and IMr. Speaker and the rest of it, but sometimes<br />
there is only one Party, or at least only one which is allowed to<br />
operate effectively. In other cases the Parliament is non-existent<br />
for some significant periods of time. Agin there is no longer, and<br />
this was established at the time when India decided to ask for<br />
Commonwealth status while seeking to be a Republic, there isn't the<br />
same common allegiance to the Crown which had marked the Coiomonwealth<br />
of earlier years. There are many countries representing many<br />
different circumstances of life, conditions of people, races, creeds<br />
and habits of life, tending to present us as different people among<br />
the quarterthe population of the globe included in our company.<br />
But, having said all that, there are still things we cherish as<br />
part of the Commonwealth relationship and I felt this as I sat with<br />
you today that one of the things which still remains true about the<br />
Corinonwealth and I hope will persist is that there's a rather<br />
different feeling when we sit down together, even as people who have<br />
never met each other before and I have met only a few of you in this<br />
room today, one sits down feeling immediately relaxed and at home<br />
with members of the family, perhaps remote relatives some of those<br />
here, but there is that feeling of warmth and companionship, cooperation<br />
together which still remain essential features of our<br />
Commonwealth relationship. I have been pleased to see how proudly<br />
new Commonwealth members have adopted their relationship. There is<br />
a disposition these days for groupings, either of a regional kind<br />
and perhaps, even less satisfactorily, of a racial kind.<br />
I've been troubled myself by what have been known as the<br />
Afro-Asian ali gnments which have seemed to rest not so much on<br />
policy associations or attitudes, but rather on. attitudes of race<br />
which tend to create differences and antagonisms with other sections<br />
of the community and one of the most commendable features of the<br />
Commonwealth association has been the way a multi-racial community<br />
of Parliaments and countries have been able to come together for a<br />
friendly, frank and quite forthright exchange of vieos and out of<br />
the many Parliamentary conferences of the Commonwealth Parliamentary<br />
organisation, which I personally attended and some of which I presided<br />
over, there came a better knowledge of viewpoints in the Commonwealth<br />
and a warmer feeling towards its people. I used to make it a practice<br />
myself whenever I travelled of visiting a new part of the Commonwealth<br />
and I think now with interest and a good deal of warmth about the </p>
<p>2.<br />
countries which one visited in earlier years and am able to follow<br />
with a sympathetic interest the way they have gone about handling<br />
the difficulties of development which faced niany of them. % 7e are<br />
not these days a strong Conrnonwealth financially or militarily.<br />
There is tremendous potential, of course, an aggregation of peoples<br />
occupying so vast an area of the globe, much of that area relatively<br />
underdeveloped at this time but potential, while comforting, is no<br />
substitute for the actualities of need at a given point of time.<br />
I had a former colleague in the Treasurer's job in Canberra<br />
who, when people used to tell him about the long term benefits w,, hich<br />
would come to him from some particular progrm-me, used to reply by<br />
saying that it's a case of " Live horse until you get grass."<br />
Whilo some of our Cormonwvealth countries, while they have the<br />
potential for development, are going through difficult periods as<br />
hey look for foodstuffs, the opportunities for education, housing,<br />
the medical services and all the other factors which go in a civilihL<br />
community towards raising the standards of the people, wo.<br />
can't expect it to lean indefinitely on the United Kingdom in the<br />
way that perhaps at an earlier point of development of the Connonwealth<br />
was found possible. Quite obviously we can't expect the United<br />
Kingdom to provide the tidlitary strength to keep the Comon, ealth as<br />
a whole secure. We each have to do more for ourselves and, in some<br />
cases, for each other. But given time, association and the cooperation<br />
which is within our grasp, this can be a very much stronger<br />
Cormmonw'ealth, and even in the intervening years it can be a very<br />
influential Corinonwealth because there are many of us , Jho are to be<br />
found in most places where policies are discussed. We have our<br />
influence, some in one group, some in another, some with one country,<br />
soEmle with another, and provided that -ien aintain towards each other a<br />
goodwill, a determination to make a multi-racial association work,<br />
then the Commonwealth can still contribute greatly to the welfare of<br />
mankind. Wie should always hold before us, I believe, the goal that<br />
w must first make this association work if there is to be any hope<br />
of that larger association functioning effectively in the United<br />
Nations. If the Commonwealth can't work, then how can the United<br />
Nations. On the other hand can, by the force of our own example,<br />
by the Comnmonwealth functioning co-operatively and leading to the<br />
Xrengthening of its membership, show to the rest of the world that,<br />
iven goodwill and a spirit of co-operation, this can be accomplished.<br />
! hat is the kind of vision we can cherish together and do individually<br />
what we can to keep the Comnonwealth spirit alive and make it in its<br />
practical application a function for the benefit of our conunity of<br />
nations and through those for the rest of the world.<br />
Now, that's enough from me by -, ay of opening the session, and<br />
if I can deal with specific questions you might like to ask me.<br />
Q. What association would you like Britain to have with your own<br />
country and New Zealand in your part of the world and how strong<br />
should Britain's contribution be?<br />
MR. HOLT: Do you mean do we need any formal association? I don't think<br />
we do need any formal association. Wie know each other well<br />
enough, and we have complete faith and confidence in each<br />
other and all I think we need to do is to resolve among ourselves<br />
what courses should be followed. I, as you know, have urged<br />
strongly that the United Kingdom maintain a presence east of<br />
Suez. I have pointed out that here are to be found more than<br />
half of the population of the world and on population projection<br />
that half will tend to grow rather more rapidly than the other<br />
half, that the potential for change, development and economic<br />
growth is greater there in my judgment than in any other part of </p>
<p>Mr. Holt continued:<br />
the world. To me it seems unthinkable that the United Kingdom<br />
which, over the centuries of history, has had so largo a part<br />
to play in the world and its historical development should not<br />
be associated actively in a number of the projects iwhich will<br />
develop in the area. This does not mean necessarily large<br />
military forces or large expenditure, but I think the people of<br />
this country in these days sometimes tend to underrate their<br />
own influence around the world. The respect that is still held<br />
for British character, skills of government, the British capacity<br />
for organisation and management, and, in areas of the world which<br />
are sorely lacking in these things, guidance and aid from such a<br />
source can be critically valuable at times.<br />
Q. Will the Australian Government set an example in racial<br />
harmony to the rest of the Cormonwealth by abolishing its White<br />
Australia policy?<br />
IMR. HOLT: Well, of course, it hasn't got a vhite Australia Policy so<br />
styled. It has a policy of restricted immigration, as does every<br />
country of Asia in fact some of the countries of Asia are a good<br />
deal more restrictive than is Australia. Ceylon, for example,<br />
would have a restrictive programme, India would, certainly<br />
ialaysia has, and so far as I am aware every country of Asia has<br />
a programne of immigration restriction and that programme is<br />
based on the need to preserve certain national standards, to<br />
protect employment opportunities for its people and to avoid<br />
disharmony developing in the country. For our part we have<br />
maintained a restrictive policy, I hope with humanity and good<br />
sense. It's been liberalised in a number of situations which<br />
seemed to call for that. I remember as a former Minister for<br />
Irmiigration myself having adopted a policy in relation to the<br />
Japanese wives of our servicemen who were then admitted on a<br />
basis of full citizenship . which has nowi become standard policy<br />
in Australia. Any Australian who marries a non-European has<br />
the husband or wife admitted on a basis of full citizenship and<br />
the children of the marriage, of course, are Australian citizens<br />
from the outset. Recently we -uended the previous aidinistrative<br />
arrangements so that those non-Europeans, and there are quite a<br />
body of them in Australia who have come there for the purposes<br />
prescribed under the policy, can apply for naturalisation after<br />
five years of residence with us. It's not generally known that<br />
there are some 13,000 Asian students in Australian schools and<br />
universities at this present time. I am sure those who like<br />
to attribute some racist aspect to our thinking would be rather<br />
surprised to know that the leader of the Sydney Symphony<br />
Orchestra is an American negro, Dean Dixon. You will find in<br />
various ways we have tried to apply the policy in a practical<br />
way, but we would not be serving Asia or the rest of the world<br />
effectively if the country were to be torn by racial division.<br />
It would not be a case of admitting one nationality or another,<br />
there are scores of countries outside Australia in Asia, Africa<br />
and elsewhere, if we were trying to admit a certain number from<br />
each of these countries and at the same time go throuh a<br />
satisfactory process of integration into the community life at<br />
this stage of our national development, I think it would tend<br />
to reduce our effectiveness to help others, to build our<br />
defences and to build our national aid rather than help that.<br />
The best answer for those who have doubts and some scepticism<br />
or criticism in respect of the Australian attitude is to come to<br />
Australia for themselves. They will find great friendliness,<br />
no discrimination, and most of them in my experience have come<br />
to the conclusion that the way things are working out this is<br />
just about the soundest policy Australia can adopt at this point<br />
of its history. </p>
<p>Q. Can you say at what stage are your discussions with the<br />
British Government on a base in Australia, and will it be a<br />
base and how much will it cost?<br />
MR. HOLT: I can't answer those questions specifically at all because<br />
they-have not yet been resolved. I can say that following our<br />
talks with Mr. Denis Healey earlier this year, when he put in<br />
train at the Service level for discussion between representatives<br />
of our two countries a number of proposals in relation to the<br />
three Services. Those talks have gone some considerable<br />
distance. There may be actual estimates of cost, but so far<br />
the talks have been at the Service level. I have known as<br />
Prime Minister that they have been going on, I have known<br />
particular locations which it is thought could be suitable for<br />
such a purpose, but our own view has been, for the reasons I<br />
mentioned a little earlier, the desirability of the Asian<br />
people themselves feeling that Great Britain is making a<br />
contribution by its presence and its assistance to the strengthening<br />
and development of the area, it is preferable to maintain<br />
the establishments wie have. They are good establishments the<br />
Singapore za-val base and the barracks at Terendak and Butterwiorth<br />
in V. aysia. These have been developed at considerable expense.<br />
They are very habitable as I saw for myrself when I visited them<br />
recently, and it seems unnecessary to duplicate them hen the<br />
governments of the countries concerned seem very contented to<br />
have our forces rema~ in on there.<br />
Q. A figure of 30,000,000 has been mentioned.<br />
accurate? Could this be<br />
MR. HOLT: It could only be speculative at this point, but it wiould<br />
obviously be more costly to set up now bases Yihich would be<br />
providing anything like the same scale of accommnodation that we<br />
already have. They w--ere costly enough.<br />
Q. Is there any possibility of growing difficulties with the<br />
British Government? ' Jas it in relation to the question of<br />
Britain's position east of Suez or Vietnama, and, if so, could<br />
you throw any light on your talks with Mr. Wilson on Vietnam?<br />
' MR. HOLT: There are several points when one considers the whole range<br />
of policies as between the t, 7o governments when you will tend to<br />
Set a rather different view from a small population in a large<br />
eveloping country from that of a country with a small size and<br />
large population, very conscious of its proximity to Europe and<br />
the problems of Europe. It's understandable that Great Britain<br />
should tend to concentrate its attention rather more on Europe<br />
and its problems. On the other hand, our gaze tends to wander<br />
more frequently these days around the countries in the general<br />
area in which wie live But if you ask about Vietnam in<br />
particular, Australia formed a very strong view and I ermphasise<br />
this because otherwise there might be a disposition to think<br />
that we are in Vietnam because the Americans happen to be there.<br />
We are in South Vietnam because to us it seeras no less important<br />
than it does to the United States that the %, Sgression there<br />
should be resisted and I believe Australia to be more directly<br />
involved in the dangers of fa1ilure to resist this agression<br />
than would be the United States itself, but if the attitude of<br />
the Peking Government, which has declared that wars of national<br />
liberation oh that was the North Vietnamese Government, but it<br />
flowed from the philosophy of the Peking Government. It was<br />
Peking said that power grows out of the barrel of -a gun, and if<br />
this philosophy that so called wars of national liberation<br />
successfully tried in one country can then be employed in the </p>
<p>Mr. Holt continued:<br />
next were to be successfully adopted, then nobody in South-<br />
East Asia, or for that matter in Asia, could feel secure and I am<br />
sure that our friends in the room today from India are very<br />
conscious of the shock which came from the evidence that China<br />
was disposing its troops in a menacing ay in relation to a<br />
country which had been so friendly to it as India had proved<br />
itself to be. ue are, therefore, strongly in support of the<br />
American intervention. We feel that if aggression can be<br />
halted, that on the pattern of what has happened in South Korea<br />
and Taiwan, Thailand, in Malaysia, where we fought a long<br />
emergency campaign to beat the Communist activities there, that<br />
on these patterns there can be restored to South Vietnam a<br />
situation in which it can go ahead with its own economic and<br />
social progress. I used the word restored advisedly because<br />
from 1954 onwards, after the Geneva accord, South Vietnamn did<br />
make this kind of progress. In was not until 1960, when it<br />
had become apparent to North Vietnam that while there were<br />
slipping back in their production, South Vietnam was moving<br />
steadily ahead that the campaign of aggression against Sbutli<br />
Viet Nam became actively pressed.<br />
Q. Does it appear to you, ad it does to riny here, that the<br />
British Govenment believes that Australia's frontline should<br />
be at Danrwin and not 1,000 miles to the North?<br />
MR. HOLT: I don't know that this represents the viewpoint of the<br />
British Government accurately. The fact that you stage your<br />
forces in a particular area as a base doesn't necessarily mean<br />
that you regard that point as the front line. It would be a<br />
base from which you would operate. I think the British Government<br />
would still regard a point further to the North of Australia<br />
as the more favourable point from which to conduct military<br />
operations. But of course one can't answer a question of that<br />
sort with any authority or precision unless ou know the<br />
situation you are coping with. Is it some trouble that has<br />
arisen in ndonesia? Is it a march down the Malaysian Peninsula<br />
by Communist or other hostile forces? The military action and<br />
stretegy necessary to cope with this will be affected by what it<br />
is you are dealing with.<br />
Q. Do you think Britain should be in the Anzus Pact? Has there<br />
been any move to brinA Britain into ANZUS and, if so, what has<br />
been the reaction fromi both Britain and America?<br />
HOLT: I wouldn't like to cormment on that. We have other arrangements<br />
with the United Kingdo,, but I'm not pressing for anything<br />
to be done in that direction. My own belief is that if<br />
Australia were seriously under threat that regardless of treaty<br />
commitments the people of this country would want to come to our<br />
assistance. After all, nearly half a million Australian<br />
casualties were sustained in two world vwars, fought a long way<br />
from home when this island wis threatened. I have no reason<br />
to believe that British people wouldn't feel that they had not<br />
an obligation but a call on then if we were vitally threatened.<br />
Wo. can all take comfort in the fact that the United States, which<br />
remins the migtiest rilitary power in the history of . mankind,<br />
has stated quite emphatically as recently as the ast few days,<br />
through its spokesman Dean Rusk, that there is no question so<br />
far as America is concerned that if Australia is under attack<br />
they move in to cover that attack. </p>
<p>Q. You said that unless the Comronvrealth can agree then there<br />
is no hope for the United Nations agreeing. Perhaps I read<br />
too much into that, but would you explain please. It seemed<br />
to imply that unless the Commonwealth acts together as one<br />
unit the United Nations can hardly succeed.<br />
MR. HOLT: I think you did read a little more into it, and this might<br />
have been my own fault of inadequate explanation. What I was<br />
saying . as that we do at least have the advantage within the<br />
Comorronealth of warmer co-operative feeling towards one another<br />
and, therefore, to the extent that some multi-racial organisation<br />
can be made to function effectively it ought to be<br />
possible to do this rather more readily inside the Cor-monw ealth<br />
than in a more amorpheous and more diverse, and at times more<br />
po.-erfully hostile, body such as you find in the United<br />
ations. Furtunately ve have nothing in the way of an<br />
ideological conflict within the Cornonwealth of the magnitude<br />
which exists inside the United Nations.<br />
Q. Many people are a little puzzled by that fact that, although<br />
Australia supports the United States policy in Vietnam, ie do<br />
continue to trade in increasing amounts in wheat and -ool with<br />
Red China. Did you find in America sympathy and understanding<br />
for the Australian policy?<br />
MR. HOLT: I didn't feel the disposition to discuss it frankly. I feel,<br />
and I think Harold Wilson would share this view, that these<br />
are means whereby we can hope to build a better relationship<br />
between countries which are other.; ise hostile to each other.<br />
Trade norally connotes a mutuality of benefit, a mutuality<br />
of interest, and if trade can build steadily between two<br />
countries and work to their ramtual advantage they are less<br />
likely to take action hostile to each other. e don't see<br />
inconsistency with this, while at the same time sternly<br />
resisting pplicies of aggression. We are trying to tell the<br />
aggressor that this is not acceptable to us and will be<br />
combatted, but at the saie time we don't want to put that<br />
aggressor, in the circumstances of the modern world anyhow,<br />
out of business, destroy the economy or destroy the lives of<br />
the people. I think that in trade, tourism, even in the<br />
visits of reporters on a more frequent basis, the cultural<br />
and social exchanges which can be an increasing feature of<br />
the life between those behind the curtains and those on this<br />
sido of it, these and other ways have to be tested to see if<br />
we can make some improvement in relations. We can't allow<br />
ourselves to become bogged down indefinitely in rigidities<br />
of hostilities one to the other, and I joined in welcoming<br />
the initiative of the Prime Minister in making another<br />
attempt in Moscow to help to get some progress towards<br />
negotiations for peace. These initiatives may fail, but a<br />
time comes and this in my experience has been a feature<br />
of negotiations with Communists when their determination<br />
or stubborness at some point of time is converted into a<br />
disposition to go on with a negotiation. Therefore we<br />
just keep trying as best w-e can, but in the meantime taking<br />
whatever action seems to be necessary to ensure the<br />
aggression does not succeed.<br />
Q. You were reported in ashington as saying that Australia<br />
was prepared to go all the way with L. B. J. in Vietnam, and<br />
yet I gather you have your " ban the bomb" groups in<br />
ustralia with distinctly anti-American sympathies. Can<br />
you estimate the degree of support in Australia for American<br />
policy in Vietnam and can you visualise at what point you<br />
yourself would wish to draw the line as the British Government<br />
has done in that support? </p>
<p>IMR. HOLT: I don't want to deal with suppositious cases. The support<br />
of the Australian Government for the United States is based on<br />
a mutuality of interest in the policy being pursued. We<br />
consider ourselves even more directly involved than the Unied<br />
States and we are very conscious of the fact that the brunta 0<br />
the effort there is being borne by the United States. V&amp; 6 are<br />
very appreciative of what the South Vietnamese are doing too,<br />
and they paid a heavy price themselves in their determination<br />
to keep their country from this aggression. I find in the<br />
coment I made in relation to the United States an expression<br />
of our own detormination, a recognition that the policy being<br />
followed there is in the Australian national interest. We,<br />
of course, have people in our country who are opposed to the<br />
policy, the official Opposition is opposed to our policy, it<br />
is opposed to national servicemen being used and has said it<br />
will bring them out of action as soon as it can after it takes<br />
office. But my Government is a coalition of two Parties and<br />
two Houses of Parliament. Up to the time I left Australia<br />
I was able to say that I had 100 per cent support from all<br />
Members in both Houses in both Parties on the Government side.<br />
One Government Senator has since notified some reservations<br />
he has about it well in that case I have 100 per cent less<br />
one, or one out of 73, something to that order. On the<br />
public opinion pollig of recent times there has been not only<br />
good support for a policy of participation in Vietnam, but the<br />
polling indications for the Government have been at the highest<br />
level known in our history.<br />
Q. If the present talks between Rhodesia and Great Britain broke<br />
down, would your Government be prepared to support the tightening<br />
of the screw policy, imposition of more sanctions on Rhodesia,<br />
and if those failed would your Government be prepared to support<br />
the use of military force against Rhodesia?<br />
MR. HOLT: I wouldn't speculate publicly on official policy. I'm not<br />
stating new policies here today. I'm merely trying to interpret<br />
policies which are already current. We have a policy current<br />
in respect of Bhodesia and I am not able to add to that at the<br />
present time.<br />
Q. Do you feel any need for a closer relationship between Australia<br />
and New Zealand in view of their geographical proximity and joint<br />
policy agreement?<br />
MR. HOLT: You mean some sort of organic relationship? Having just<br />
said I'm not stating new policy, I had better not violate that<br />
rule and certainly I would not want to indicate a new policy<br />
because frankly we don't have a new policy. I can say the<br />
current relations between the two countries are very good. I had<br />
personal talks with Mr. Holyoake before I left Canberra. He<br />
came over for the S. E. A. T. O. Conference. We've recently<br />
negotiated a Free Trade Agreement with New Zealand, which will<br />
increase the volume of trade between our two countries. We are<br />
together with our forces in South Viet Nam. I say together<br />
advisedly because when I saw the troops up there the New<br />
Zealand battery was actually in physical contact or proximity<br />
to our own Australian forces in military camp there. On most<br />
of the problems of the day, as they affect our part of the world,<br />
we think very much alike. As to what the future holds, there is a<br />
good deal of interesting speculation going on about that.<br />
T think this is happening ncreasingly so in New Zealand because<br />
there is a realisation there, I believe, that the domestic<br />
market cannot become large enough except in relation to<br />
particular items of manufacture to warrant a very extensive<br />
development of manufactures, and that, therefore, the Australian<br />
economy, with its much greater diversification, could integrate </p>

Mr. Holt continued:<br />
more closely with that of New Zealand. I don't mean by<br />
integration a mergot of the two countries, but I moan that We<br />
believe in the future we could be deawn even closer in matters<br />
of trade and shall remain closely sympathetic to each other<br />
in matters of international policy.<br />
Q. The British Government, through Mr. Healey, has indicated<br />
that it is imposing some restrictions on arms sales, and<br />
specially in relation to their use in Vietnam. Is this a<br />
matter of any embarrassment to the Australian Government?<br />
MR. HOLT: This is opposition by the British Government to the sale<br />
of arms for Vietnam? It's not a matter which iould be<br />
inclined to be in my mind. I wyould have thought the equipment<br />
already there was both large and adequate, but I'm not in a<br />
position to make a policy statement about that. </p>
