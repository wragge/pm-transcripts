PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, HYATT HOTEL MELBOURNE,<br />
FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Welcome to what is going to be the first of regular<br />
morning press conferences at which I will be available to<br />
the media for questioning about the events of the day before<br />
and the day ahead and any questions you want to address to<br />
me at all. Before making myself available to you for<br />
questions now, let me make this point to you that I called<br />
the election last Friday and a very interesting pattern has<br />
emerged from the Opposition on the issue which they regard<br />
as critically important, and which is important, that is of<br />
interest rates. On Saturday Mr Peacock, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, said that the market would move to lower<br />
interest rates from day one, his words, " move from day one"<br />
that was Saturday. Sunday we get Senator Stone, I quote<br />
Senator Stone " I've never said, and I don't think anyone<br />
on our side has ever said, that we will get interest rates<br />
down over night". Well his Leader had just said it the day<br />
before and Senator Stone was still at it yesterday. So we<br />
had Monday's contribution where Senator Stone criticised<br />
those of his own people who were making predictions about<br />
the timing of interest rate falls under the Coalition<br />
government saying, and this is Senator Stone Monday,<br />
yesterday, quote " Nobody can give you answers to those<br />
kinds of questions and nobody should because they would be<br />
telling you lies if they did." Remarkable. Mr Peacock on<br />
Saturday, from day one. Senator Stone saying that if anyone<br />
said those sort of things they would be telling lies. The<br />
remarkable thing about the interest rate saga is of course<br />
the development this morning, where on AM Mr Peacock again<br />
went to this issue and said they would be coming down. Why?<br />
Because of the Opposition's policies in regard to a fiscal<br />
policy and wages policy. The facts, of course, are that the<br />
fiscal policies and the wages policies of the Opposition<br />
would guarantee a blow-out of interest rates. Fiscal policy<br />
they are confronted with the situation where this<br />
government has had unprecedented fiscal restraint, fourth<br />
successive year real reductions in Commonwealth outlays,<br />
Commonwealth surpluses for the first time in the<br />
Commonwealth's recorded statistical history, and against<br />
that you have the credibility gap, the $ 6 billion unfunded<br />
credibility gap of the Opposition. The fiscal policy would<br />
blow out, interest rates with it. The other element, wages<br />
policy of course as every commentator in the market<br />
realises, the Opposition promising and inevitably dooming </p>
<p>Australia to, a looser wages policy, wages blowing out. So<br />
looser fiscal policy, looser wages policy, inevitably higher<br />
interest rates. So there we have the saga on interest rates<br />
of the opposition from last Friday. Total confusion,<br />
contradiction, but inevitably under the impact of their<br />
policies higher interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: come down but because of international<br />
factors that these interest rates are going up will they<br />
come down<br />
PM: We've said they'll come down and I've been very very<br />
responsible and modest about what we've said. But most<br />
importantly what I've said is, in a sense what the financial<br />
markets and the banking community itself is saying is even<br />
more important than what the Prime Minister is saying. And<br />
what they are saying, correctly, is that as a result of the<br />
policy settings and decisions of the Government they are<br />
saying that it is inevitable that interest rates will come<br />
down. What I have said is that I agree with that but the<br />
extent and the timing will be a matter for the banking<br />
sector. Their assessment is the one in a sense which<br />
matters most. What we have had to do is to create the<br />
settings, the economic environment in which they are able to<br />
make those decisions. And if I could just make this point,<br />
if you remember during the latter part of last year when we<br />
were taking a fair bit of flack, interest rates were rising.<br />
We stuck to our settings because they were necessary. We did<br />
not rely on monetary policy alone. We had, as I've said,<br />
the tightest fiscal policy in the history of the country,<br />
measured by the successive reductions in real outlays, the<br />
proportion of outlays to GDP being right back to the lowest<br />
levels of the 701s, the move into substantial surplus and of<br />
course very importantly the public sector borrowing<br />
requirement going substantially into surplus. So we had the<br />
fiscal policy and the wages policy tight and in that setting<br />
also monetary policy tight. Now they were hard decisions to<br />
take, but I've never shirked taking a hard decision. The<br />
important thing is those hard decisions having been taken,<br />
the financial sector, the banking sector is itself now<br />
saying that interest rates are going to fall. That is the<br />
important thing.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I think just to use the phrase, Peter, " tightening"<br />
social welfare payments does an injustice to the Government<br />
and the community in a couple of ways. Let me make these<br />
points. There has already under my Government been the most<br />
substantial tightening of the processes which are used to<br />
determine the reality, the legitimacy of the claims made by<br />
people claiming benefits. That massive reduction is<br />
documented, is understood and accepted. There is no-one now<br />
I believe in the welfare sector, or amongst the responsible<br />
commentators in the community, that has not accepted the<br />
fact that there has been this significant tightening. At the<br />
same time as we ' ye undertaken that tightening we have<br />
ensured that those who are legitimately in need have been </p>
<p>protected. If you like to get some indication of the<br />
relative compassion of my Government compared to the<br />
policies of our predecessors who are now urging the same<br />
sort of approach. It is interesting to note that if you take<br />
what I think must be regarded as a pretty fair example of a<br />
group in the community in need if you take a married<br />
pensioner couple with a couple of kids. Now under the seven<br />
years of the conservatives, practising then the same sort of<br />
policies that they are preaching now for the future, which<br />
ultimately is what we are concerned about, that under those<br />
practices then the real disposable income in the seven years<br />
of their Government for that needy unit to climb by 2%.<br />
Under my Government their real disposable income has<br />
increased by 14% where they are renting privately. Now what<br />
we've done therefore is to tighten up where there has been<br />
abuse of the welfare system, then we've removed those<br />
abuses. But that has enabled us, together with other<br />
measures we've taken like taking pensions away from the<br />
millionaires for instance, the totally untargetted welfare<br />
in inverted commas, of the conservatives has enabled us to<br />
give. And that's what the Australian community wants. The<br />
Australian community is a compassionate community. I have no<br />
doubt about that. They want those really in need to be<br />
helped. We may get some wider message from this, Peter, also<br />
about the opportunism of the conservatives when it comes to<br />
elections. You will recall, and particularly journalists<br />
here in the City of Melbourne will recall, 1984, Assets<br />
Tests. Mr Peacock saying that surely as night follows day<br />
the Assets Test was going to be abolished. But of course<br />
they've come to accept that and the Fringe Benefits Tax.<br />
These things are necessary. Now, as far as the present is<br />
concerned, again, pure opportunism against the legitimate<br />
policies of this Government. Now as to the particular<br />
decisions that will be taken further in this area, I must<br />
ask you to wait until Wednesday when in the Economic<br />
Statement of the Treasurer there will be some additional<br />
measures of relevance in this area unveiled.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister problems of the Victorian<br />
State have influenced the actual timing of the election. Do<br />
you believe the that problems of the Victorian State Labor<br />
Government impact badly on the image of Labor as a manager<br />
of the economy?<br />
PM: First part of the question no part in the timing of<br />
the election. I've given the reasons for the timing of the<br />
election. Secondly, no I don't believe that any difficulties<br />
that the Victorian Government are having in any area of<br />
economic management impinge in one way or another on the<br />
Federal Government. I mean to believe that they would be is<br />
really to say that you think the electors of Victoria are a<br />
pack of unintelligent people, that they can't understand<br />
that the State Government of Victoria has responsibility for<br />
the conduct of economic management in this State and that<br />
what they are being asked to decide in this election of<br />
course are the issues of national economic management, the<br />
issues of health care whether you are going to have a<br />
continuation of Medicare or the chaos, which is the </p>
<p>conservative's position where they are looking to the<br />
future, which is what we are about. We are going to have a<br />
continuation of my Government's transformation of education<br />
where two out of three of our kids stay on in school now as<br />
compared to one in three under them. These things which are<br />
within the providence of the Federal Government are the<br />
issues that will be important for the people of Victoria.<br />
Just as I said for instance in Western Australia, where I<br />
have been recently. It was said there that because of<br />
perceived problems of the Western Australian Government in<br />
regard to WA Inc that the Western Australian electors were<br />
going to be that unintelligent that they were going to say<br />
I'll kick myself, as a Western Australian elector, in the<br />
backside by giving myself a worse education system, worse<br />
Medicare and health cover system. I'll hurt myself in that<br />
way to give Mr Dowding, as he then was, a kick in the<br />
backside. Now I don't think people operate like that. Now<br />
going specifically to that part of your question which<br />
involved the bank in Victoria, let me say that I am not<br />
privy to all the details of that. But let me make the point<br />
that the, I am sure the State bank of NSW has some<br />
difficulties as well. Whether they are the same dimensions<br />
or not, I don't know. But what you've had happen in the<br />
last few years, that these banks have extended their<br />
operations and in the extending of their operations they<br />
seem, some of them, to have taken on what might be put as<br />
second class credits. And as asset values have declined<br />
then some difficulties have arisen. But I don't expect that<br />
because banks in either, State banks in either Victoria or<br />
New South Wales have experienced difficulties in their<br />
banking decisions that any sensible person is going to say<br />
that that reflects on the capacity for economic management<br />
of my Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Jolly's not at all to blame for the State<br />
Bank? PM: Well, I think that what we ought to do, you and me and<br />
the community is to wait and see what the statement is and<br />
what the indication of the lines of responsibility are. As<br />
I understand it, and I think this would be a matter which is<br />
dealt with more particularly, more specifically this week,<br />
as I understand it there is a complete line of independence<br />
in the board of the State. Bank. But I'm sure that all that<br />
will be exposed in detail later this week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you support Treasurer Jolly to remain as<br />
Treasurer? PM: Well, that of course is a decision for Mr Cain. But let<br />
me make it quite clear in terms of the beatup story in one<br />
of the Melbourne papers yesterday in which the journalist<br />
concerned had made no attempt to contact me or my office or<br />
Mr Hogg, but had written a story that Mr Hogg and myself had<br />
sought to pressure Mr Cain to get rid of Mr Jolly. There<br />
was absolutely, and is absolutely, no foundation for that<br />
story as far as I'm concerned. There is no foundation. Now<br />
I've known Rob Jolly, as you would appreciate, for a very </p>
<p>long period of time. He was with me at the ACTU. All my<br />
knowledge of Rob Jolly is one of competence and integrity.<br />
I don't think I need to say more than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mr Keating ever discussed the projected<br />
losses of the State Bank of Victoria with you and if so what<br />
was PM: No he hasn't had any detailed discussion. And I'll<br />
come to it detail because I'm not trying to do a shoofty<br />
by adjectivaling my way out of it, if I can put it that way.<br />
He's had no detailed discussion with me about that at all.<br />
The only conversation is an indication well we know<br />
there's some, we don't intend to be, y'know, particularly<br />
privileged in information. It's fairly generally known.<br />
And there was reference to the fact that there was going to<br />
be some sort of loss in Victoria of reasonably considerable<br />
dimension, but no detailed discussion about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: do you accept that there is a case for<br />
tightening particularly dole payments and is in part<br />
prompted by the Opposition's Economic Action Plan<br />
limiting dole payments after the election?<br />
PM: We haven't been in office, in any of our period,<br />
prompted by the ideologically blinkered and prejudiced views<br />
of the Opposition. I mean, their record in the area of<br />
employment and unemployment is so mired that<br />
no-one takes them seriously in this area. I mean, you don't<br />
have to go back long in history. They were the ones who<br />
created the massive numbers of unemployment beneficiaries<br />
the most massive increase in unemployment beneficiaries in<br />
our history under the conservatives. Because they lacked<br />
the capacity to manage the economy. So they have no<br />
credibility in this area. No. What we've done is to say<br />
you must conduct economic policy in a way which creates<br />
jobs. I mean, that's the essential of dealing with the<br />
question of employment and unemployment create jobs. And<br />
so we've created 1.6 million, five times faster than them.<br />
Now, at the same time we have steadily, as well as getting<br />
the reduction in unemployment beneficiaries which comes from<br />
the creation of more jobs, we've recognised that under the<br />
systems which grew up under our predecessors, there was a<br />
laxity in the administration. And so we've tightened that.<br />
So you've had the twin pincers, if you like, moving on this<br />
issue. One, the creation of more jobs and secondly, where<br />
people were through lax administration being able to get<br />
benefits where they weren't entitled, we've weeded them out.<br />
There's been a massive increase in that process. Now I<br />
believe you will see that what is going to happen is there's<br />
going to be a quite dramatic, I believe, further step in the<br />
process, philosophical and practical process of dealing with<br />
this issue. The main thing that you have to do as a<br />
concerned society, as one concerned with proper economic<br />
management, one having compassion for those in need, but<br />
also one concerned to ensure that people are going to be put<br />
in the best position to help themselves is to make sure that<br />
your expenditures are basically of a kind which are going to </p>
<p>put people into the training programs. Now we, as you know,<br />
and you know much of the details about that, of the programs<br />
that are already there, we'ye done a great deal to do that<br />
transfer the emphasis from benefits to training. And I<br />
think you'll find that that sort of thing will be enhanced<br />
significantly in the sort of details that are going to be<br />
announced. JOURNALIST: Just to return to the State Bank issue.<br />
whether at that point in time they were raising State<br />
Bank PM: No, the I've had no detailed discussion, no detailed<br />
discussion about the State Bank situation with them. No<br />
detailed discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just a minute, I'll come back to you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will they be voluntary,<br />
PM: I think you, I think you should wait and see, till<br />
Wednesday. That's only tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can interest rates still fall in the climate<br />
national wages outcome<br />
PM: Yes, and I think if you'll notice some of the<br />
statements made by commentators in the financial markets, an<br />
expectation that our environment would be much more<br />
conducive to that than the uncertainty of the Opposition.<br />
What has characterised our period in office in regard to<br />
wage outcomes is that the community, not only wage and<br />
salaries who are entitled to have some knowledge and<br />
expectation of outcomes, as are employers, but so are the<br />
markets. What has been the characteristic is that we've<br />
been able, after negotiations with the trade unions and some<br />
discussion with employers, to say look that is the national<br />
aggregate outcome of wages. And also associated in part<br />
with that, inflationary outcomes. Now, under our policy for<br />
six years, that's what's happened and the same thing will<br />
happen again following Wednesday, that the community will<br />
know with a very considerable degree of certainty, wages<br />
outcome. They can make their judgements as well as seeing<br />
the forecasts about inflation. And within that framework, I<br />
believe, the other policy settings of previously tight<br />
monetary policy and very tight fiscal policy, the three<br />
together will mean yes, that there can be reductions in<br />
rates. Against those certainties of settings you have the<br />
opposite from the conservatives and this is being<br />
acknowledged by some commentators in the market. In regard<br />
to wages, as recently as yesterday, the two spokespersons<br />
from the Opposition who presumably know most about this,<br />
Stone and Hewson, were asked repeatedly by your colleagues<br />
in the Canberra Gallery when they gratuitously called a<br />
Press conference to give their instructions to the media as<br />
to how they should conduct themselves. Then the media, not </p>
<p>unreasonably, said well could we ask you a couple of<br />
questions. We ask you, what is your view about aggregate<br />
wages outcome under your policies if you were in Government?<br />
pass that one. Wouldn't, wouldn't answer it. In other<br />
words, from the supposedly literate and knowledgeable<br />
economic spokesmen of the Opposition you got no better than<br />
you got from the Leader of the Opposition, whom they treat<br />
with a certain amount of reserve when it comes to economics,<br />
but they were no better. You know the classic answer that<br />
Mr Peacock gave in Canberra when he was asked the critically<br />
important question, critically important question as to<br />
economic management, as to interest rate outcomes, he was<br />
asked well what's going to be the wages outcome from your<br />
policy. The historically memorable, lamentable, pathetic<br />
response ' who's to know'. Well, in a sense people weren't<br />
surprised that Mr Peacock gave that answer which is so<br />
relevant to your question. What is likely to happen to<br />
interest rates under the Government's policies or the<br />
Opposition. Not so surprising to many people that Mr<br />
Peacock said ' who's to know'. But yesterday you had the<br />
supposedly literate and knowledgeable economic spokesperson<br />
giving virtually the same answer. So, I repeat, under our<br />
policies you will have, as you've had in the past, the<br />
predictability. And that's related to a tight fiscal policy.<br />
Against that tight fiscal policy of this Government you'll<br />
have, as you go through this campaign, the $ 6 billion<br />
credibility hole of their fiscal position.<br />
JOURNALIST: The figures we get tomorrow, the figures we get<br />
tomorrow in the Economic Statement will they actually<br />
be economic forecasts as such or will they be more<br />
targets...<br />
PM: Well, they'll be precisely what they've been in the<br />
past. I mean, we're not having a statement for the first<br />
time. I mean, this is the beginning of we've been there<br />
for seven years. We will be doing exactly what we've done<br />
every year before and that is that we will be putting out<br />
the figures on the basis of the negotiations that we were<br />
able to have with the trade unions and in the context of the<br />
historic approach to the social wage, we'll be able to say<br />
these are the outcomes. Now, they will have the same status<br />
as they've had for the previous seven years.<br />
JOURNALIST: Speaking of Mr Peacock, as you were, yesterday<br />
could've gone better for you... Mr Peacock says you were<br />
totally rattled. Would you give him any points for<br />
yesterday? PM: I certainly don't. I mean, just look at the facts of<br />
yesterday. I make no apology for them. I went to a<br />
conference about roads in the Opera House and I came to a<br />
podium at which there was a total traffic jam. There wasn't<br />
a centimetre of room left for me. And to the great<br />
JOURNALIST: You laugh it of f now Prime Minister. You<br />
didn't laugh it of f yesterday. </p>
<p>PM: I did laugh it of f yesterday and may I say, I mean, you<br />
weren't there were you?<br />
JOURNALIST: I was.<br />
PM: Were you? And did you see the audience laughing with<br />
me? JOURNALIST: Yes I did.<br />
PM: Good, OK. So I was laughing, they were laughing and<br />
importantly so were a lot of the journos. I was, I thought<br />
it was rather amusing and obviously the majority of people<br />
there did. So, I<br />
JOURNALIST: But it happened again later in the day didn't<br />
it? PM: Well, could I just finish the answer to the question?<br />
PM: So I regarded that as a rather amusing episode,<br />
certainly not a rattling one. The second one which is<br />
giving Mr Peacock some hope, that I was rattled. There I<br />
was, I went to this environment conference to launch a book<br />
and there were people there wanting to listen and some<br />
person, who is ackowledged as a bit of a way-out fanatic,<br />
was there and took over and wanted to make a speech. Well<br />
there were the kids wanting to hear what I had to say and<br />
other people wanting to hear what I was saying. I thought<br />
well there's not much point in, you know, having a shouting<br />
match with him, so I, so I walked off until he'd finished.<br />
When he'd finished I went back and I said OK it's launched,<br />
saw the kids, gave them their certificates. Now all I can<br />
say is this. If Andrew thinks, out of those two episodes,<br />
that I'm rattled, I hope he continues to think it. I<br />
really, sincerely Andrew hope that you're thinking that<br />
Bob's rattled because mate, I'll tell you I'm not. I'm<br />
looking forward very, very much to the rest of this<br />
campaign. JOURNALIST: Do you think an inflation forecast of six per<br />
cent for next year is realistic?<br />
PM: I think of that order is realistic. But I will answer<br />
all the ' se questions in more detail, as will Paul, after<br />
he s made the statement tomorrow. But I think that sort of<br />
order is realistic, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said on AM yesterday that under Labor<br />
there'd be a considerable fall<br />
PM: That wasn't a I mean it was very deliberate.<br />
Not saying I can say it it's going to be three per cent,<br />
four per cent, two per cent. What I said is a reflection of<br />
what I said in answer to earlier questions here. The<br />
Government doesn't set interest rates. What the Government<br />
does is to conduct the arms of economic policy out of which<br />
interest rates emerge. We've been prepared to make the hard </p>
<p>decisions which during last year and to the beginning of<br />
this year meant high interest rates. Because high interest<br />
rates were necessary. I mean you want to have a precise<br />
measure. Just let me give you a precise measure which was<br />
relevant to why we did what we had to do. In the previous<br />
year we had broadly an eight per cent increase in<br />
consumption and a four per cent increase in production.<br />
Balance made up by excessive imports. So what we had to do<br />
was to reduce the level of demand. We did that by the<br />
combination of tight fiscal policy and wages policy<br />
supplemented by tight monetary policy. And out of those<br />
Government economic policy settings the interest rate<br />
pattern emerged. Now as those policies have impacted, as<br />
they have, and we've had the signs of slowing down which is<br />
what is necessary, then the banking sector has already begun<br />
its reductions within the interest rate structure. And they<br />
have said, importantly, that there will be further<br />
reductions including in mortgage interest rates. Now in<br />
that context it's not for me to say how much. But when I<br />
say considerable I think that is consistent with the<br />
policies that we've put in place and with the anticipation<br />
of the banking sector itself.<br />
JOURNALIST: that the Government doesn't set interest<br />
rates, doesn't using a word like considerable talking<br />
down interest rates?<br />
PM: No, and neither have they regarded it as such. There's<br />
been no suggestion by the market that Hawke has attempted to<br />
influence them. In fact I think there's an acceptance that<br />
I've been quite responsible about it. It's, I suppose,<br />
always a question of judgement as to what is the best word<br />
to use. But I think it's a responsible word.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think of Senator Richardson's<br />
comments yesterday polls show a swing back to your<br />
Government... in WA?<br />
PM: Well, I agree with him. I am privy to some polling<br />
that's been done which supports what Senator Richardson has<br />
said. I think he rightly identified the one difficulty, the<br />
really difficult seat of Moore, the difficulty of which is<br />
associated with the redistribution. The redistribution has<br />
made that notionally a Liberal seat. So that's that much<br />
more difficult to hold. But I would agree with Senator<br />
Richardson's assessment. And it really goes back to an<br />
answer I gave here before to a question on this side. I<br />
mean at all points the assessment about this horrendous<br />
position that we were facing in Western Australia depended<br />
upon, in my judgement, a fallacious assessment of the<br />
Western Australian electorate. It meant, really, looking<br />
at Mr and Miss Australia, West Australia, in the eye and<br />
saying to them you're a mug. You really are a mug. That's<br />
what the analysis meant. Because you were saying to them<br />
you're not happy with Premier Dowding and WA Inc. This<br />
federal election has got nothing to do with that. It's<br />
about what sort of education policy the country's going to<br />
have nationally, what sort of health policy it's going to </p>
<p>have, what sort of control over wages outcome it's going to<br />
have. And you know that that's what's in issue. But to<br />
punish Mr Dowding you're going to give yourself a kick in<br />
the backside and give yourself a worse education system for<br />
your kids, a worse health policy for yourself and your<br />
family, less efficient economic management. You're going to<br />
give yourself all those disadvantages to punish Mr Dowding.<br />
Now that really does involve a pretty sad analyis of the<br />
intelligence of the voter. And I never shared the analysis.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is it the point that the lift<br />
in your Government's ratings in West Australia are precisely<br />
due to the fact that Dowding got the boot and Dr Carmen's in<br />
as Premier?<br />
PM: What I'm saying is that even if that hadn't happened,<br />
even if that hadn't happened, what I was saying was that as<br />
we went through the election and as I made these points,<br />
then the judgement would've been made in the way that I'm<br />
talking about. I don't deny however Paul, I don't in any<br />
sense deny that we haven't got a bonus out of what you're<br />
talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given that you hold a seat down here, why is it<br />
that you haven't had any campaign launches in Victoria?<br />
PM: Well, that would I mean the logic of that is that if<br />
I held the seat of the Northern Territory I should have the<br />
campaign launch in the Northern Territory. If I held a seat<br />
in the ACT that I should launch the campaign from Canberra.<br />
There's no logic in the proposition because I happen to hold<br />
a seat in a state therefore that's where the campaign should<br />
be launched. It's not a proposition that has ever<br />
recommended itself to any leader of any party in the history<br />
of this country I think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Alright, why haven't you had any campaign<br />
launches in Victoria?<br />
PM: That's a different question. Because the judgement of<br />
myself and those with whom I discuss these things has been<br />
that it's been best to hold the launch on the three<br />
occasions that I've been to the people in Sydney. I guess<br />
the only sort of comment I could make, or justification of<br />
the decision is that the decision has been associated with a<br />
win. I mean we don't seem to have got it wrong on three<br />
occasions. I guess three out of three is not bad. If I<br />
could have 100% record in my punting I'd be very happy. Now<br />
on this occasion we've made a different decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you given any consideration in the<br />
truckies dispute?<br />
PM: No I notice that I just had something put in front of<br />
me before I came here, which the ABC news carried Mr Greiner<br />
reportedly calling on me to intervene in the truck dispute.<br />
Now let me just say this to Nick Greiner. Let me say it<br />
quite directly. The key to this is in Nick Greiner's hand. </p>
<p>11.<br />
I put the key in his hand last December. I offered it again<br />
yesterday at the Opera House. Now what the truckies want<br />
it's quite clear what they want is they want nationally<br />
consistent road laws. While I can't agree with their<br />
methods I agree with their objective. They want nationally<br />
consistent road laws. Why in the hell shouldn't they want<br />
nationally consistent road laws. In December of last year,<br />
as I say, I gave Premier Greiner the key to the answer with<br />
the blackspots program where I undertook to make in total<br />
$ 120 million available, $ 120 million, the overwhelming $ 110<br />
million on actual construction and another $ 10 million on<br />
identification and associated research, on the condition<br />
that the States moved to uniform national conditions. You<br />
remember what they were? National .05 level, alcohol limit;<br />
national licensing of heavy truck and bus drivers; national<br />
uniform speed limits; speed limiters for heavy vehicles;<br />
adopt zero alcohol limits for young drivers; increase<br />
enforcement to ensure that one in four drivers are random<br />
breath tested for alcohol in a year; implement a graduated<br />
licensing system for young drivers; introduce compulsory<br />
bicycle helmet-wearing; introduce daylight running lights<br />
for motor cyclists; increase enforcement of seatbelt and<br />
child restraint wearing. Now, as I say, there it was<br />
offered in December with a very substantial allocation of<br />
federal money. My belief is that I can get the other five<br />
States to support this position and if Mr Greiner would do<br />
so also then we have the answer. We have the answer. The<br />
truckies legitimately want a national uniform position, as I<br />
say. I identify with that. Not with their methods. I hope<br />
that they will not proceed with their methods. But Mr<br />
Greiner I've given you the key to the answer. Please accept<br />
it. JOURNALIST: Accepting what you say about that, isn't this<br />
dispute now being driven as much by the internal split in<br />
the TWU as anything else and wouldn't it help<br />
PM: Quite clearly Glenn there's an element of difference<br />
within the union. But that doesn't in any way, in any way,<br />
limit the validity of the point I've just made. Because the<br />
issue in the first place, the issue in the first place which<br />
the union pretty generally now seems to be coming towards,<br />
is the question of the regulations in NSW. They are saying<br />
they are disadvantageous and there's differential<br />
regulations. What, without any doubt, the truckies whether<br />
union driven or non-union driven are saying, is uniform<br />
national standards. And I've given the answer to that. Now<br />
I'm sure then if the Premier of NSW would respond positively<br />
to that it's quite clear then that to whether there's some<br />
difficulty within the union or not, quite clear if the<br />
Premier would respond to that then we could resolve the<br />
matter. JOURNALIST: As a result of the dispute several thousand<br />
workers stood down and there' s supposed to be another<br />
7000 If the standdowns continue </p>
<p>I 12.<br />
PM: Well, I'm hoping, I mean in these sort of things you<br />
take it step by step. I'm hoping that Nick Greiner, and I<br />
can assure the Premier of NSW I'm not trying to get into a<br />
political wrangle with him. But if the Premier of NSW would<br />
positively respond I mean it's not a bad deal is it. I<br />
mean the Prime Minister of Australia is offering $ 120<br />
million to spend on the blackspots, the most dangerous<br />
spots, and obviously NSW would get the greatest proportion<br />
of that. What's the tag that the Prime Minister's putting<br />
on it? The tag simply is agreement to national standards.<br />
Now if the Premier will agree to that then the dispute on<br />
any reasonable assessment is over. So in attempting to<br />
resolve a dispute you try and get to the main issue and try<br />
and get that resolved. Now that is the main issue as has<br />
been put. And the key, the simple key for resolving it is<br />
there. I'm sorry I've got appointments I've got to get to.<br />
