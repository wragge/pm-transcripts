BDAUL, TTTV IS IQNjINTERVI EW<br />
Statement in the House of Representatives on Thursday,<br />
28th. March, 1963, by -the Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
I must say that the speech that we have just<br />
listened to represents such a muddled-up indictment that it is<br />
very hard to know what the point of it is. In one breath, the<br />
honourable member for Eiden Monarc ( Mr. Allan Fraser) waving an<br />
arm at the Postmaster-~ General ( Mr. Davidson) said that he<br />
believed that this interview should never have been made.<br />
But the honourable member for E3den Monaro has stated exactly<br />
the same thing. He also believes that it should not have been<br />
made, So his whole argument becomes so self-contradictory that<br />
one wonders why this matter has so suddenly been thrown upon us<br />
for discussion. There was no sign of it at the beginning of the weeknot<br />
a hint not any question at question time from a fighting<br />
Opposition stimulated, as some of them are by corridor<br />
exercises In recent times. Not a hint of i~ j But when they<br />
found that a matter had beon suggested for discussion today<br />
which they would have found highly embarrassing, to wit, the<br />
giving of instructions to members by outside bodies, they at<br />
once said, " We cannot have that. 1. e do not want to have that<br />
debated. That would be very Qwkward, e are going to move a<br />
no confidence motion next week. Wle must not fire off any of our<br />
stuff in advance. We must at all costs avoid discussing the<br />
matter suggested by the honourable member for Barker."<br />
So they trotted out this matter. What is the substance<br />
of it? I will go writh the hoaourable member for Eden Monaro to<br />
the first and most powerful part of his speecha. He said and<br />
I agree that this television interview should never have been<br />
made. This int( erview was made by n body which is, after all, if<br />
0 not the servant of the Britisli Government, tho creature of the<br />
British Government, I do net agree that the man with whom the interview<br />
was made is a poor, broken down old follow. I saw this man<br />
myself, full of self -sat-, sfas3tion and leering at his au&amp; nce.<br />
The interview was made with a man who is at this time wanted for<br />
a capital offence against the Government of France. He is<br />
wanted for treason. He is being pursued, in effect, or is<br />
pursuing himself around the world, He is wanted as the head of<br />
an organization which has already made unsuccessful but violent<br />
attempts to assassinate the President of Fr-ince. This is the<br />
man that we are hearing about.<br />
Of course this interview should never have been<br />
made! It could do nothing else but give this man and his views<br />
publicity. It would serve to give him a certain amount of<br />
prestige as a person worth interviewing and presenting over the<br />
principal television service in the U,.<br />
It is l~ ittle wondcr to me that there wore violent<br />
protests in France, It is little wonder to me that there were<br />
protests in the House of Commons. As an unfriendly act towards<br />
a friendly power, I can scarcely think of anything more stupid<br />
and more offensive. I imagine that we all would agree with<br />
that. Certainly the honourable member for Eden Monaro agrees<br />
with it, but having said all those things that the film should<br />
never have been made by the BBC and so on he went on to say<br />
that it should have been put on by the Australian Broadcasting<br />
Commission in Australia, or at any rate, that a Minister should<br />
aeo/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
not have dared to prevent it. That, Si'r, is a form of<br />
reasoning which completely escapes me,.<br />
11iei n Australia are not only friendly with France;<br />
we are associated with France in the South-East Asia Treaty.<br />
Through our allies in the old world, we are indirectly<br />
associated with France in NATO. lie are not a member of<br />
NATO, but Great Britain is, and France is in a key position<br />
in the western European structure. Are we supposed to be<br />
quite indifferent to the fact that a body commonly regarded<br />
as the agent or the mouthpiece of the AustraJ, 4an Government<br />
not here; we know better, but commonly so regarded outside<br />
should put on an interview which, by concession, we say should<br />
never have been recorded? Of course, the reason that is put<br />
forward is a very high and mighty one ' W~ ell, this involves<br />
censorship," It is one thing to prevent a programme from<br />
being put on; it is another thing to close up a few newspapers<br />
completely, Honourable members opposite had better<br />
search their own record. How fortunate it is that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell) is not here today.<br />
When this direction was given to the it was,<br />
I repeat, in my opinion a proper direction on a matter which<br />
concerns the relations of this country with a friendly power.<br />
11r, Allan Fraser In fact, you would do it again?<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES: As a matter of fact, if it would be<br />
effective, I would do it again, certainly. I am not making<br />
any apologies. I havo publicly conceded that we then found<br />
ouz~ selves in a position in which the pro~ bition against the<br />
A. B. C. would be rendiered completely futile and discaiiinatory.<br />
Therefore, we withdi-ow it.<br />
Mr. Peters Did not you know that before you issued<br />
it? SIR ROBERT MENZIES: I did not think of it, I suppose. I<br />
do not know. When you find that a position has developed<br />
which is untenable, it is good sonsc to go away from it.<br />
I have no apologies to make for that,. All I want to say<br />
is that Opposition members had better make up their minds<br />
as to whether they agree with their spokesman about the<br />
nature, quality and propriety of this particular interview,<br />
If there were power in cne stroke to prevent the presentation<br />
of a matter offensive to an allied poweor not merely<br />
offensive, but a matter which involved putting forward and<br />
giving publicity to a man wanted for treason then I hope<br />
I would have enough firmness, whenever it cropped up, to<br />
do everything I could to prevent it,, </p>
