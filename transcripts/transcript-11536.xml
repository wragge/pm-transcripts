<p>E&amp;OE</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>[tape starts] and always incredibly impressive to hear them playing and marching to that tune. It's the greatest tune in the world as far as I'm concerned. It's fantastic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] chaos, a little chaos in the streets. They sort of block off Whitehall Road. But worth it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, of course. I mean, no country did more to defend the cause of liberty in partnership with Britain and in Australia. And Britain owes Australia an immense debt. We payed very dearly in two World Wars to defend, not only Britain, but also to defend freedom. And of course Britain payed very dearly herself. Without her leadership in World War II the Nazis would have won. It's a matter of history but you should always remember it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you've got a busy day ahead.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've a very busy day. I'm seeing the Leader of the Opposition shortly and then I have a meeting with the Chairmen of about a dozen companies that not only have major investments in Australia but all around the world and it's an opportunity to follow up on last night to drive home the economic advantage that the strong economy now gives to Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One more Prime Minister just on an issue back home, the Labor Party has accused the Government of losing it's sense of humour over chicken ads.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've haven't seen the chicken ads, but if all Mr Beazley can talk about three days after the GST is chicken ads, we're not doing too badly.</p>
<p>[Ends].</p>
