TRANSCRIPT: " Willesee" l Program, TCN Channel Nine, Sydney.<br />
Mike Willesee interviews the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Hiawke.<br />
DATE: Tuesday 23rd April 1985<br />
TO AIR: 6.30 pm<br />
. WILLESEE:<br />
At a time when the whole nation is waiting to see ' what you are<br />
going to do about changing the manne r in-which we are all taxed<br />
you have suddenly added four cents a litre to the price of<br />
petrol. Why?<br />
' PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because it is the-policy which has been followed by successive<br />
governments. It should be noticed that the Oppogition has<br />
endorsed. the decision we've taken, as has the business community.<br />
It Is a well placed policy because it relates to the* fact that<br />
Australiastill. has to import a significant proportion of its<br />
crude and we have to follow a policy which is relevant to that<br />
and to conservation purposes, and the important thing is that I<br />
have given the undertaking and I repeat It that the revenue<br />
that the government derives from this will not be used to<br />
undertake new spending programs but -will be utilised as part of<br />
the government's overall approach to adhering to the trilogy.<br />
That is, that there will be no Increase In taxation a a<br />
proportion of gross domestic product, no increase in the Deficit<br />
as a proportion indeed there will be a substantial reduction<br />
in money terms in the* Deficit, and there will be be no increase<br />
ini government outlays.* And so we'll be using the income that<br />
flows from the application of a consistent policy that's been<br />
followed -by successive governments to pursue these economic<br />
policies which are calculated to ensure a continuation of<br />
solid economic growth at containable levels of inflation which<br />
has produced for this country in the two years of government<br />
a turnaround from the worst recession that this country has had<br />
for fifty years to record rates of economic growth, to record<br />
rates of employment, and to a halving of inflation. e e / 2 </p>
<p>WILLESEE: This petrol increase is still effectively a tax, isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a policy which has been followed by successive governments<br />
as being accepted as relevant and necessary to our position<br />
as still an importer of crude. And what has got to be understood,,<br />
that in the result Australians still pay less for their petrol<br />
than virtually any other OECD country.<br />
WYLLESEE: Yes, but it is still effectively a tax.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well yes it is a tax. This is the way in which the system must<br />
operate. But it is a tax which is used for sensible economic<br />
purposes. It is not there simply to impose a tax. It has been<br />
accepted across the political spectrum as necessary a necessary<br />
pricing policy in regard to a scarce resource, and so the fact<br />
that it is collected as a tax is simply a way of saying that is<br />
bow you give effect to a policy, which is recognised as valid<br />
for other purposes. What is important is the commitment that I<br />
have given on behalf of the government: that it is not a tax<br />
which is raising revenue which this will government will use to<br />
increase its expenditures. On the contrary, the revenue that will<br />
be-derived from this necessary decision which has been accepted<br />
across the political spectrum and by the business community<br />
is revenue which will be used to bring about an economic<br />
strategy calculated to improve the general economic position.<br />
WILLESEE: I think if you asked the average Australian at ' the moment what<br />
question held most like answered ' from you,, I think be would<br />
very likely, or she, would very likely ay " r keep hearing about<br />
the possibility of tax changes, how is it going to affect me.<br />
What's going to happen with our taxes?"<br />
PRIME MINISTR:-<br />
Yes, and I reckon -that's exactly the question that I would ask.<br />
And the answer I will give is this: that I have said that the<br />
government does not want arbitrarily to impose changes in the<br />
tax system. We recognise, as does ' that average Australian man<br />
and woman, that the existing tax system is inadequate. 99.9%<br />
of-your average Australians would agree with that. So what we<br />
have done is to say we are going to try and bring representative<br />
Australians together, Mike, so that together we will examine both<br />
the inadequacies of the existing system, and to look at alternative<br />
ways in which we may be able to bring about a better system.<br />
" Better" being judged by the cri-. eria of equity, economic<br />
efficiency and simplicity. I happen to believe that together<br />
we are going to be able to do that.<br />
WILLESEE: Well there's a potential dilemma there with these sujmmits: I mean<br />
if they don't agree, if there are conflicting forces on taxation<br />
which there could Very easily be<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There will be, Mike. f ./ 10j31 </p>
<p>TRANSCRIPT~~ " aESE s ' A<br />
WILLESEE: You're still the government, youlre the Prime Minister. What do<br />
you want changed about our taxation system?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I do want, if we can, to get to a system where these things<br />
are done: that we don't have such. significant marginal<br />
disincentives in the direct tax rate. I want to see more of tbe<br />
WILLESEE: Sorry Prime Minister, just one at a time. Do you mean by that<br />
that some tax rates are simply too higI4? Personal income tax.<br />
PRIME MINIStER:<br />
At the marginal rate there are moving it is estimated -at<br />
286,000 1 think is the number of people who will move into the<br />
46 cents in the dollar marginal rate. That you have the<br />
situation now where the top rate, Mike, of 60 cents cuts i~ n at<br />
something like one and a half times average weekly earnings<br />
where some ten or fifteen years ago it was about twenty or thirty<br />
times average weekly earnings. So I believe that those marginal<br />
tax rates are cutting in at levels of income which are too low,<br />
and I think t * hat would be generally agreed. So we want to see<br />
if we can remedy that. We also, secondly, want to see, Mike,<br />
if we can bring more of the available income into the tax base.<br />
There is a lot of it-Which is ' avoided which means generally that<br />
the average taxpayer is paying more in direct personal income<br />
tax than he or she would if you had a wider income tax base.<br />
WILLESEE: Can I just go back to the first point of income tax. You are<br />
expressing concern about that but you are heading' a government<br />
which is charged with this responsibility but you're not telling<br />
us what you'Ire going to do about it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm saying that before we accept, as we will, we accept the<br />
responsibility as a government of ultimatel. y making -the decisions<br />
but the secret of success of this government which-has turned this<br />
economy around from the worst recession in f if ty years to record<br />
rates of economic growth and record levels of employment growth<br />
and halving the inflation rate, we've done t * hose things in very<br />
large part because we have been a government of consultation,<br />
We've consulted with, we've talked with, the business commnunity.<br />
We've talked with-the trade union movement. We've talked with<br />
welfare groups. We have talked with State and local governments.<br />
Now what I'm going to do at this summnit is to continue a process<br />
which has been remarkably successful. Successful in a way which<br />
has been commented upon right around the world. Now we are<br />
therefore In regard to tax going to try and do the same thing.<br />
Not to shift the responsibility to someone else but to try as<br />
far as we can to get the best range of views within the Australian<br />
community as to how they'd like to get changes, and then we are<br />
as government going to try and accommodate as far as we can the<br />
expression of views of the Australian people.<br />
WILLESEE: Well what about the Australian government? I don't want to carp<br />
about the summit concensus attitude because there's a lot of reason<br />
to believe that it's very successful but, you know, as I repeat<br />
you are the Prime Minister, you head the government. if you say<br />
that it's too high why don't you go further and say " It will be<br />
reduced"? / 4<br />
TRANSCRII'T " WILLESEE" </p>
<p>AAA~%.. l~ kk~ W1. L~ i. k, IPage 4<br />
PRIME MINISTER:'<br />
I believe it will be reduced and that's what we're aiming at.<br />
Blut all I'm saying is, Michael, that there are a different range<br />
of views as to the appropriate ways of achieving end results, and<br />
so we're not having the summit as some charade, some empty<br />
exercise that we're just going through for the formalities.<br />
We believe that out of the process of the summit and the<br />
processes leading * up to the summit and the discussion of the<br />
white paper that we will generate around the community that we,<br />
as a government, can be better Informed. So that the decision<br />
tbat we take at the end, for which we'll accept the responsibility,<br />
will be a better informed decision and one which is more lihely<br />
to be capable of achieving acceptance from the Australian community.<br />
That's sensible politics. It's how you conduct yourself in<br />
normal life. In any community of people, group. of people, you<br />
try if you are sensible not to impose decisions upon people. You<br />
accept you have an ultimate responsibility but it does make a l. ot<br />
of sense, Mike, to get as many views from as many well informed<br />
quarters and concerned quarters. as you possibly can.<br />
WILLESEE: So you are saying that you believe that too many people-are paying<br />
46 cents in the dollar in personal income tax anad too many people<br />
are paying 60 cents.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And Mike if I can just add -I don't want to interrupt. but that<br />
these rates are also cutting in at too low a leve-is of . income and<br />
this is acting as a disincentive In many respects. So the secret<br />
of what we're about is to try and achieve a situation where<br />
government will still be able to get sufficient revenue to do the<br />
sorts of things that the coummunity wants done in the field of<br />
defence, educat-ion, the building of roads -' we'lve got to do all<br />
those things. So if the way we're raising revenue and let me<br />
remind you that basically for the last, If you take back to<br />
1949 this country bas' been* governed out of the 35 years, it has<br />
been governed for 30 of them by anti-Labor government. We have<br />
basically inherited a tax system which is the creation of the<br />
conservative forces of this country. So what we want to do is<br />
to make-sure that in doing the things that the Australian people<br />
want of us on the expenditure side, that we can raise revenue<br />
the necessary levels of revenue in a way which is most<br />
acceptable to the Australian people.<br />
WILLESEE: Can I come back in a moment to the other manner in which you can<br />
raise revenue. * On personal income tax, which I think is the<br />
f irst question people want answered, what do -you want? What<br />
wold be desirable, without committing yourself what woul'd be<br />
desirable in your opinion?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think a system which would do these things Michael would<br />
be, first of all, progressive. I think there's basically no<br />
argument in the community -about that; which relates the amount<br />
and the proportion of income that people will pay to their income<br />
capacity. So progressivity is important. Secondly, you want a<br />
system I believe which eliminates the poverty traps that can<br />
occur at the lower* levels of income. I think that desirability<br />
is accepted throughout the community. And thirdly, as far as<br />
possible Mike, : you want to have. a system which is going to be<br />
as much lacking in disincentive to people to earn extra income as<br />
you possibly can. </p>
<p>A Atli's~ k<br />
WILLE SEE:<br />
Prime Minister before we take a break could you try and put a<br />
figure on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No it's not possible<br />
WILLESEE: Is there a limit on what people should pay in personal income tax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let me put it this -way, the 60 cents rate is certaiDly a<br />
limit. There is no suggestion that we would be increasing that.<br />
If possible I think we'd be wanting to bring those marginal rates<br />
down. WILLESEE: So you are just talking about bringing marginal rates down?<br />
You're not talking about anything more drastic than that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't no what you mean by " more drastic".<br />
WILLESEE:. Could you suggest figures that would sound suitable to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well no I don't think you can just pluck a figure out of the<br />
air. What you can recognise is that the existing system has<br />
evolved mna way which now, I believe, operates as too much of<br />
a disincentive and I think there'd be very, very-widespread<br />
agreement about that. So we have got to-try and construct a<br />
system which meets that problem as far as you can while still<br />
ensuring.-Mike, that the government is going to have available<br />
to it the levels of revenue that are nec essary to do the things<br />
that people want. I mean, too often in the tax debate and it's<br />
so easy to do it, you say " Oh we pay too niucb tax" I think<br />
everyone believes they pay too much tax. You very rarely<br />
hear, Mike, people saying " Well we don't want as much spent on<br />
defence. We don't want as much spent on education. We don't<br />
want as much spent on social welfare. We don't want as much<br />
spent on the building of roads" and so on. So If the commiunity<br />
basically wants all these things done and continue to be dome<br />
then any government must have the revenue to do it. I want the<br />
viewers to understand: I don't want and my government doesn't<br />
want tax, it doesn't want revenue, for our own purposes, I<br />
mean to satisfy ourselves. The only reason that I want<br />
adequate levels of revenue is to do the things that the<br />
Australian people want and which only governments can do. The<br />
community can't, individuals can't create Australia's defence<br />
forces. Individuals can't build roads. Individuals can't spend<br />
money on the total education system. Governments have to do that<br />
on behalf of individuals.<br />
COMMERCIAL BREAK<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, just to* wrap UP. this taxation matter and I<br />
do understand that it's yet to go to the summit and you can't<br />
commit yourself -but is there one thing that you want out of<br />
taxation reform? / 16 </p>
<p>6% 6' A. 4JLS A W A1LLOZ eae<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes there is. It's basically this: that at the end of what we<br />
do, or even if what we do immediately is not the end of the<br />
process, I want my fellow Australians to believe that what's<br />
happening in Australia is that they are paying, through the<br />
various forms of tax that exist, that they are paying fairly<br />
and reasonably their contribution to enabling the things to<br />
be done that they believe will make Australia a better place.<br />
You just can't talk talk about tax as tax. Tax is there to<br />
enable things to be done on behalf of the people, and that's<br />
what I want to see emerging.<br />
WILLESEE: So you're saying it is not punitive, it is necessary, and it has<br />
got to be done.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sure, I mean, do you want we to abolish the defence forces?<br />
Do you want me to stop all these things? We don't want that<br />
to happen. I have the mandate,* the responsibility, the<br />
trust, I hope, of the Australian people to be the custodian, if<br />
you like, of the contribution that they make as individuals and<br />
as firms to the processes of doing within Australia the things<br />
that need-to be done by government to make this a better place,<br />
and I just hope that out of this process they will feel that they<br />
have been part of arriving at a decision which means that while<br />
basically no one likes paying tax, they will recognise that it<br />
is being done fairly and effectively to achieve the purposes<br />
that they want.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, would it be fair for me to interpret what you are<br />
saying as." Don't expect any more money in your pocket after we<br />
reform the taxation lawo!'?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, not necessarily. It may be thecase and in a sense I hope<br />
it will be that for a lot of people that they wi1 in net terms<br />
be better off. Because you will appreciate that I have, on<br />
behalf of the government of Australia, given the commitment that<br />
tax will not increase as a proportion of gross domestic product<br />
whicb means, if I can put it in laymend terms and non-economist<br />
Jargon, that out of what Australia produces, out of what comes<br />
out of the efforts of all of us cooperatively to produce goods<br />
and services that the government will not be taking a greater<br />
proportion of that production.<br />
WILLESEE: So the same amount of revenue raised through tax, but in a<br />
different manner?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The basic point I am making is that we will not take more of the<br />
community's productive effort. And in giving that commitment,<br />
and in trying to re-shape the taxation system, I hope that a<br />
significant proportion of Australians will in net terms be<br />
better off. That's what we'll be aiming to achieve.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister thanks for your time. ENDS </p>
