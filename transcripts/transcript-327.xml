oMCIAL OdNING OP 1961 UCIR1IQ 9IZP 3XsW 63CP<br />
and u. 1961<br />
Upfeeh br th Prime Miniter. th t. Hon. It. aG. MenLAsies. H. P.<br />
Hr, Falkiner, ladies and gentlement<br />
In case I forget it, I declare the Show Open. ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) And I gather from your applause that that's really all<br />
I need to do about it. ( Laughter)<br />
But I had a very plaintive letter from Geore Falkiner<br />
inviting me to come aown here. lie reminded me that it was<br />
years since I wae here last to do this Job. I vasn't likely to<br />
forget it) Jeouse with all the optimism that characterises a<br />
man who had only been Prime Minister, at thIat time, for two years<br />
all that optimism has long sine deserted me I come down Just<br />
with a hat, flow down from Canberra and was to rly back at the end<br />
of the afternoon. There I was, Just a hat and, of courseo a<br />
oi tain number of garmots on aeo I was very well reooiVed people<br />
were immensely courteous they were not so angry with me in 1951<br />
as they have been occasionally since and we got on very well. I<br />
left here and caught the plane at about a quarter past five and<br />
we got overhead at Canberra, There was a thunderstorm and the<br />
lightning flashed and the clouds were sweeping around and every<br />
nov and then I could see the lightss as 1 imagined them, of my own<br />
house and a clear mental picture of my poor wife saying " Where is<br />
my wandering boy tonight?" Finally the pilot came down and said<br />
" I'm sorry, we hove to go back to dyney". If any of you have ever<br />
tried to sleep in a Sydney hotel, having nothing to oear except the<br />
kind of thinj I'm now wearing, you will understand exactly how<br />
well I remember that occasion.<br />
There's one other thing I would like to say. I zrmember<br />
it from the time before and it is quite fascinating. There is a<br />
very studied form of insult delivered to a politician by you<br />
" sheep fellers". Just as the politician begins to think " how that<br />
asn't a bad sontenoe", an intorjaector says " baaaa, haaa baaaa".<br />
iou can hear it all round the place. -4hereas this regrottable<br />
looking old ran opposite me, ever since I arrived and sat down has<br />
been wrinkling his nostrils at me. ( Laughter) A very subtle form<br />
of insult that, and one which I must set about introducing into the<br />
louse of Reprusentatives ( Laughter) You couldn't call a man to<br />
order, could you, for wrinkling his nose. You can't rise to a<br />
point of order and say " The honourable member for"-let's take a<br />
name at random " East Sydney" ( Laughter, applause) " is wrinkling<br />
his nose at ms",<br />
Anyhow, Sir, whaever my sins or long since forgotten<br />
merits may be, you don't nded to apologise to me for asking ae to<br />
come to this Show, because as you have rightly said this is ihl<br />
great industry in Australia. There can be no question about that<br />
at all. ( Applause) I've had it very much in my mind of recent<br />
times becauseo as Imay tell you rather confidentially9 we've taken<br />
a few rather unpopular steps in the last six months I wouldn't<br />
want to have it mentioned outside but I don't mind admitting that<br />
that is so, ( Laughter)<br />
Jut I Just want to take the opportunity of saying to you<br />
that every step that is taken to suppress inflation in Australia is<br />
bound to be unpopular with somebody; but it can't be unpopular<br />
with you. Jecause if there is one great industry in Australia it<br />
is the wool industry, and if there is one industry that can't<br />
afford domestic inflation it's yours. You meest the world, you meet<br />
the world's demand, you are paid 4hat the world will pay youl but<br />
you can't pass your added costs on to the man next door. Ieople </p>
<p>0ooauionally forgot that even so amaxing an Industry as the wool<br />
industry oan really be priced out of profitable exi!; tenoe booauue<br />
of the rise In costs internally,<br />
Therefora I suy for myself that It doesn't worry me it<br />
somebody doesn't like some carefully conceived anti-inflationary<br />
measures because I happen to havre enough wit to know t at the<br />
solvency of Australia, the arvth of AuetruJial the capacity of<br />
Australia to receive mi,; runts year by yeurs the prospects of<br />
Australia having 20 million people in the lifetime of many of the<br />
men here present today, all those things depend niot only upon a<br />
world makt for wool, but upon a sucoeamfil ; 2ld market for wool*<br />
-Ind it can't be a aucoessful market if &amp; alloping inflation is<br />
allowed to take charge on the home-front. ( Applause)<br />
Thereioreq Sir, quite unblushingly I Invite you to think,<br />
to understand, that as nobody has yet blot rid of an inflationary<br />
boom without hurting somebody, without treading on somebody's corns,<br />
it is the duty of a practical statesmanl to select toe corns, rot to<br />
* a afraid of treading on a few corns, but to say " WJhat Is th Xzeat<br />
object to be achieved? And If I can achieve that for millions of<br />
people I must content to annoy thousands of people". That's It.<br />
This is, In the old phrases the problem of the jreatest 4,00d for<br />
the gftatost number.<br />
Now 1 believe as you belie ze, that these passing<br />
incident* are only passing Incidents* 4. have had then before<br />
today -and we've come through Lhem. George Falkiner -dus good<br />
enough to ref ir to what has happened in Australia In the last<br />
years. It In really fabulous. do forget so easily, ' Old men<br />
forgot; yet all shall be forgot' yo-i know, Shakespeare, as usual,<br />
was rightt we do forget . hose things, Jut if any one of us here<br />
today had sat down In 194~ 9, or,' 50, and had put In front of him or<br />
her a statement of what the position In Australia would be In 1960<br />
he would have disbelieved it, she would have disbelieved It, It<br />
would have been reearded as perfectly Coolishe dho had any reason<br />
to suppose that 90 million sheep should become 150 million, to take<br />
you~ r own great industry* WIho would have supposed that we could<br />
ha-io seen, with our handful of peoplo the tremendous do iolopment of<br />
this country, a development so remarkable, If you will allow me to<br />
say so, that the ieople overseas who are shrewd Jud,, os of our<br />
, ountryt who are not interested in our ooubitry In order to lose<br />
money In its are so interested in this country, and Ita Aiture<br />
prospects, its potentiallties, that contrary to all the<br />
pessmistst i. rophecieos we are having In the current year an even<br />
greater inflow of private capital invoutment Into ' 1stralla than<br />
we had last year, when It was an all time reaurd. ( Applause)<br />
Siwg all this means something to you; It means something<br />
to this groat Industry. It means that more and more and more we<br />
are developing a large population ourselves and t-he strengtii of a<br />
nation to sustain, and be utained by, our major Industries*<br />
Now the only other things that I want to say Sir are,<br />
first that one of the groat problems In this industry Is research.<br />
I donit suppose I wuuld have such difficulty In , oin4 down the<br />
street somewhere, In Sydneyo even In that boni~ hted centre that<br />
I came from,. Melbourne, to find somebody who would say, " Oh yes,<br />
Ltd love to be a sheep man, 4ulte eusy, quite easy. YOU just<br />
sit on a verandah axnd smoke a pipe., and watch the wool grow. It's<br />
an simple as that**<br />
I lke to remember that even in my own lifetime the<br />
quality, the yield of wool, the knowledev of pastures, the pride of<br />
achievement in the wool-grower, has grown out of all sight. This<br />
Is a proud industry, as veil as being a &amp; reat Industry, And<br />
because It'is a proud one, it must have research; it must grow<br />
and grow. People of pride are not satisfied to decline . they must<br />
go on and be strong. </p>
<p>In the pavilion that I went throuagh before lanch,<br />
lookind hastily and, Itm isfraid, nut always intaligently1 at the<br />
exhibits and at what was .4oij on, I once more had reason to be<br />
tiani~ fu2. that the wool indust~ ry has been aware,, increasingly, of the<br />
need for researoht some of It in the laboratory, uiomo of It in the<br />
officel a lot of it on the sheep farm Itself, a lot of it<br />
conducted by practical sheep men, a lot of It conducted byr<br />
scientists who, an I was hmappy. to obseve toduy, are in no case<br />
" lone,-hairod" l scientists they all looked quite respectable to me.<br />
('. aughter) Rather like politicla 5. Jut the Importancoe of<br />
reseurch, I. think, oun't be over-estimuted because wool of course,<br />
hias. Its battle to fight in the jorld. I'm an optimist on that<br />
matter,-if I may say so, buicauso for the last 20 years I've been<br />
listening to people who have said " Wool is finished. ' Thore's a<br />
synthetic fibre that's joing to put It out of business". I once<br />
4as cajoled into a darment mude of on. of these synthetic fibres.<br />
I put it on onae, I hated it, and I'Ve never vorn it siode<br />
We've aliraya been told that the day of jloom theday of<br />
disaster, is around the oorner. I don't believe it,. believe<br />
that If wool Is constantly reinforced, as the ; reatesi; of all<br />
riatural fibres by the efforts of scientists and passing out,<br />
ultimately, iiato the efforts of breeders Qn developors of wool<br />
production, it will hold its own ajainst competition. If it is of<br />
any Importance to any of us lid like you all to have this In mind<br />
! eawase live had it in my own mind for various purposes a g~ ood deal<br />
of lates the population at the w~ orld was 29500 adliions, so the<br />
statisticians uaid in 19% 0# In 1960 this had become about 3,200<br />
millionis, a very big increase. Wy the year 2000 wind and wnather<br />
penItitt, in the absence of some enormous worlA catastrophe, the<br />
estimate is that there will be 6 000 million people in the worldt<br />
that the p~ opulation will double 1n a period of 40 years, or near<br />
enough. Does this make you pessimistic? It presents uzt with<br />
problems, It presents the world 4ith colossal problems bucause<br />
the se people must be fed and clothed* jut from the point'of view<br />
of this great Industry Lhis Is a marvellous opportunity. We are<br />
not to suppose that you are~ just cate~ ring for the existin,,, demand<br />
for the great fibre. The demand us the atund-ird of living rises<br />
around the world* will 4rov will double, will treble# will<br />
cjtwdz'upl* of course it wiii provided that t~ he Industry itsirf<br />
4ith * all the aide of theoreticl and applied soienoe is able to<br />
meet the market to most demand to meet the calls offashion, to<br />
meset the calls f~ or trousers that don't have to be crossed by your<br />
' ii~ fo, all these maorn developments that have been of such great<br />
importancu, and will. be moro so in the Puture. Therefore<br />
research by you, by the technical experts# by the sclentists is<br />
trixendously Important.<br />
The other thinjg 131rl In promotion, because this is a<br />
sort of salesman's world. Do you know, If I may betray a guilty<br />
secret of politics to yout that I occasionally have the most<br />
manificent and brilliant Ideas ( Iaughtr), but the trouble is I<br />
have to sell them to people, I have to make them understand that<br />
they ure magnificent and brilliant. That's reasonable, isn't it?<br />
Jo the art of salesmianship is tremendous the urt of promotions<br />
I am delighted to see that under the virle leadership of my<br />
friend Sir William Gunn ( Applause) this promotion campaign oes on,<br />
The orld is not going to beat a path to our door just bocuuse we<br />
grow ereat wool. I know that somebody said that that would happen<br />
if somebody had a good idea, You must go Into a world, no<br />
country in which an compare with Iu~ zralla as a drower of fine<br />
wool* and you mast constantly have right under their noses, and in<br />
LI-wir minds the virtue, of this jreat fibre., You iean't leave It<br />
alones, you can't stay at home iand say$ " Well, they will ome along"<br />
4uoause they won't, It's not that kind-of world. </p>
<p>4*<br />
Therefore the promotional programse seems to me to be<br />
something of the most tremendous Importanoo. I hope nobody is<br />
going to say, " Well if the Govurnment thinks that, let the<br />
Jovernment do it." Do you know one of the things I like about<br />
this greatest of all Australian industries is that it has never yet<br />
put Its nook Into the overnment, -Oe politioal noose. It has<br />
been its own m aster; ( Applause) it has had Its own pride; it has<br />
made its imortal oontribution to the life of this country. Sir<br />
I hope it will be like that alwuyst long after my time; long after<br />
the time of other people here.<br />
Therefore I hope I have conveyed to you that this to me<br />
is not Just one of those ohores that a political man has to do.<br />
This to me has been an occasion of opportunity and of very great<br />
pride. So. for the seoond time, I declare the Show open* </p>
