    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.......................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Jeff, for those very kind words of introduction</p>
<p>   and welcome. To Joy Howley, Peter Costello, Tony Staley, my other</p>
<p>   federal and state Parliamentary colleagues, fellow Liberals.</p>
<p>I start by expressing my immense gratitude to you, the members</p>
<p>   of the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party, for the very crucial</p>
<p>   part that you played in our remarkable win on the 3rd</p>
<p>   of October. The professionalism of the Victorian Division has been</p>
<p>   a long practiced habit and has for a long time been a constant in</p>
<p>   the political life of our country. Fortunately over the past two</p>
<p>   or three elections the good professional habits of the Victorian</p>
<p>   Division have been copied by other State Divisions around the country.</p>
<p>   And we have started to win in those states in a more consistent</p>
<p>   fashion than used to be the case in the past. But I don't forget</p>
<p>   the ongoing and the long standing contribution that the Victorian</p>
<p>   Division has made over the years to our strength at a federal level.</p>
<p>   And it remains the case now the tremendous strength that your federal</p>
<p>   Members bring to the Coalition Government in Canberra.</p>
<p>There are many who have contributed to our remarkable win and I</p>
<p>   want to say in a few moments some things about the characteristics</p>
<p>   of that victory. But I do want to thank Peter Costello as the Deputy</p>
<p>   Leader as the Treasurer over the last two and a half years for the</p>
<p>   leadership that he has given to the Federal Parliamentary Liberal</p>
<p>   Party here in Victoria. Peter has been a great Deputy, a great Treasurer,</p>
<p>   a great colleague and he has played a very major role in putting</p>
<p>   together the architecture of the policy that we so successfully</p>
<p>   took to the people on the 3rd of October. And he has</p>
<p>   also played a very major role as Treasurer in the fact that I will</p>
<p>   be able to go to Malaysia tomorrow as Australia's Prime Minister</p>
<p>   to the APEC Meeting and I will be able to speak with the authority</p>
<p>   as the leader of a country whose economy has held up remarkably</p>
<p>   well in the face of the worst economic downturn that our region</p>
<p>   has seen since World War II.</p>
<p>The real truth, and in some ways the as yet to be fully told story,</p>
<p>   is that the Australian economy has performed better than anybody</p>
<p>   really expected in the face of that economic downturn. We have historically</p>
<p>   low rates of inflation, historically low levels of interest rates,</p>
<p>   we have very high levels of business investment, we have recovering</p>
<p>   levels of consumer confidence and we have been able to put to the</p>
<p>   Australian people successfully a major historic tax reform plan.</p>
<p>   And this week we have seen the lowest unemployment figures for nine</p>
<p>   years. Peter Reith has made a great start in that new responsibility.</p>
<p>   Now he has got a, I mean if you get 7.7 this month Peter, next month,</p>
<p>   but I think we all are sensible enough to know that these things</p>
<p>   can bounce around. But the job market is stronger, and that Job</p>
<p>   Network is better than the old CES system that it replaced, much</p>
<p>   better. And if we can get the Australian Parliament to pass the</p>
<p>   Unfair Dismissal Law, we can generate even more jobs and if we can</p>
<p>   challenge the Labor Party, which we have, to match its rhetoric</p>
<p>   about youth unemployment by voting to entrench junior wage levels</p>
<p>   within the Australian economy, we can preserve two to three hundred</p>
<p>   thousand jobs for young people.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, I thank all of my colleagues here in</p>
<p>   Victoria, all of my federal colleagues for their help and their</p>
<p>   loyalty and their support and their commitment to our cause over</p>
<p>   the last two and a half years and most particularly during the election</p>
<p>   campaign.</p>
<p>I do want to express my sadness politically and personally at Russell</p>
<p>   Broadbent's defeat. And I do want to thank him most warmly</p>
<p>   for the contribution that he has made to our Parliamentary Party.</p>
<p>To all others who ran unsuccessfully as candidates, particularly,</p>
<p>   but not only to those who ran in difficult Labor held seats, I express</p>
<p>   my thanks. I congratulate Tsebin Tehen on his election as a Senator</p>
<p>   from the State of Victoria. And I thank Karen Synon for her contribution</p>
<p>   in the time that she has been in the Senate which will continue</p>
<p>   until the 30th of June.</p>
<p>Whenever you win an election, everybody has got an explanation</p>
<p>   as why you did it. And everybody has got a special pet theory which</p>
<p>   is sometimes vaguely related to their own contribution as to why</p>
<p>   you have won. Let me say there are many explanations as to why we</p>
<p>   won this election. And I think some of the explanations have been</p>
<p>   pretty close to the mark and there are some things about the election</p>
<p>   that ought to be understood very clearly. There is one very important</p>
<p>   thing about the election that should be understood and that is that</p>
<p>   it does not represent the beginning of a Labor resurgence. On the</p>
<p>   surface of it, yes, there were a number of seats won by the Labor</p>
<p>   Party, and there was a two party preferred swing against the Coalition.</p>
<p>   The reality when you look below the surface of course is that the</p>
<p>   Labor primary vote barely moved up, but there was a reduction of</p>
<p>   about eight or nine per cent nationally in the Coalition's</p>
<p>   primary vote and most of that went to One Nation and through their</p>
<p>   distribution of preferences four or five per cent of a two party</p>
<p>   preferred swing was delivered to the Labor Party. And it is true</p>
<p>   as Jeff said in his introduction that although Pauline Hanson lost</p>
<p>   her seat and there will only be one One Nation representative in</p>
<p>   the Parliament after the 30th of June next year, that</p>
<p>   organisation is not politically dead, and we have to continue to</p>
<p>   work hard to win back the disillusioned Coalition people who supported</p>
<p>   One Nation. Particularly in Queensland and Western Australia. One</p>
<p>   Nation did us a lot of damage in Western Australia. Far less damage</p>
<p>   here and far less damage in South Australia, but a lot of damage</p>
<p>   in Western Australia. We have to reach out to those people and we</p>
<p>   have to persuade them to come back to the Coalition.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing that the election demonstrated and</p>
<p>   demonstrated very, very dramatically is the quality of grass roots</p>
<p>   campaigning. And the thing that gives me tremendous pride, not only</p>
<p>   as Parliamentary Leader, but as somebody, like so many of you, has</p>
<p>   spent 30 or more years in the Liberal Party organisation. That last</p>
<p>   election is the best demonstration yet that when it comes to professional</p>
<p>   grass roots campaigning and marginal seat campaigning the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party now is much better than our Labor opponents.</p>
<p>I mean we had some astonishingly good results in marginal seats.</p>
<p>   I look at the audience and I see people and I, it's always</p>
<p>   a mistake to do this, but I make mistakes from time to time doing,</p>
<p>   I look, I look at people like Bob Charles and Fran Bailey and Phil</p>
<p>   Barresi and the tremendous job that the three of them for example</p>
<p>   did in very, very marginal seats, a quite astonishing job. And you</p>
<p>   move into the other states and the role of the three people that</p>
<p>   I mentioned on election night of Trish Draper and Jackie Kelly and</p>
<p>   Danna Vale and can I say as a Liberal coming from Sydney how tremendous</p>
<p>   it was to see David Hill fall over in a heap politically.</p>
<p>Now that's, they are some of the personal reasons why we did</p>
<p>   well. But I think the other reason why we won, and the other thing</p>
<p>   that made this victory so important, and in many ways a more emphatic</p>
<p>   and more important victory than 1996 because you all know that in</p>
<p>   1996 the Australian public was desperate to vote out a government</p>
<p>   that had been there for 13 years and they were desperate to get</p>
<p>   rid of a Prime Minister who had lost all contact with the Australian</p>
<p>   public and all resonance with the mainstream of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   But on this time we did take a very, very difficult in some respects,</p>
<p>   controversial taxation plan to the Australian people. But we took</p>
<p>   something to the Australian people that from the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   down was passionately believed in by the people who were putting</p>
<p>   it to the Australian people. And public life is ultimately about</p>
<p>   campaigning for those things that you believe in, trying to win</p>
<p>   public support for those things that you believe will be of enduring</p>
<p>   benefit to the Australian community. And when you win that support</p>
<p>   then having the courage to implement it.</p>
<p>And we were successful for a lot of reasons. We were also successful</p>
<p>   because we received magnificent support at a State Government level</p>
<p>   from our political colleagues. And I especially want to thank Jeff</p>
<p>   Kennett for the tremendous enthusiasm that he brought to the campaign,</p>
<p>   the tremendous support that he has given to the cause of taxation</p>
<p>   reform. His willingness to campaign in other parts of Australia.</p>
<p>   And his uncompromising support for a taxation reform programme that</p>
<p>   he and I and all of us know will be of enduring benefit, not only</p>
<p>   to the people of Victoria, but also of enduring benefit to the entire</p>
<p>   country.</p>
<p>And of course that support was continued yesterday. We had a remarkable</p>
<p>   day in Canberra yesterday. Everybody was happy, well just about</p>
<p>   everybody was happy. There was the odd piece of banter between Bob</p>
<p>   Carr and Peter Beattie. As Peter Costello and I remarked it was</p>
<p>   terrific to see it going like that instead of going like this. It</p>
<p>   was marvellous. But Jeff's help yesterday and the leadership</p>
<p>   that he has shown amongst the Coalition Premiers and State leaders</p>
<p>   has been enormously constructive and I am personally very, very</p>
<p>   grateful for it.</p>
<p>We now have before us, becuase we have won a second term, we have</p>
<p>   the opportunity to remake the political map of Australia in a way</p>
<p>   that would have been denied us if we had only been there for two</p>
<p>   and a half or three years. You really do need two, three or more</p>
<p>   terms at least, at least to make a really big impression and to</p>
<p>   change some of the entrenched attitudes that need changing. Not</p>
<p>   in a truculent or in a triumphal way. When I addressed the Party</p>
<p>   Room in 1996 after we had won power after being in the wilderness</p>
<p>   for 13 years, I warned my colleagues about losing touch. And I issued</p>
<p>   the same warning when we reassembled after the 3rd of</p>
<p>   October. We must never lose touch with the aspirations of mainstream</p>
<p>   Australia. But in keeping in touch with them, we should never be</p>
<p>   reluctant to take bold initiatives and to give a sense of direction</p>
<p>   where people are looking for it. I know there were doubters about</p>
<p>   our tax plan, and I know there were many people who probably closed</p>
<p>   their eyes and crossed their fingers and went to mass several times</p>
<p>   a week, but at the end of the day people do want you to tell them</p>
<p>   what you think is right for the country and to show a determination</p>
<p>   to pursue that course of action. And we were able to do that. And</p>
<p>   we now have an opportunity, because we have weathered this Asian</p>
<p>   economic storm better than most expected, we do have an opportunity</p>
<p>   to build on the strengths we already have economically. And we all</p>
<p>   know that the greatest piece of unfinished economic reform business</p>
<p>   is taxation reform. And after yesterday's historic Premiers</p>
<p>   Conference where the elected leaders of the States and Territories</p>
<p>   of Australia, as well as the Prime Minister and the Federal Treasurer,</p>
<p>   unitedly agreed on the principles of the taxation reform, can I</p>
<p>   again state to the so called States house of Australia, will you</p>
<p>   listen to the views of the Australian people rather than your own</p>
<p>   individualised conceit.</p>
<p>I don't know what more you can do. We have won an election.</p>
<p>   We have had a Premiers' Conference so you have the views of</p>
<p>   the Premiers, the Chief Ministers, the Australian people and the</p>
<p>   duly elected Government of Australia. I would have thought that</p>
<p>   was a pretty emphatic expression of opinion.</p>
<p>But I don't underestimate the challenge that will be involved</p>
<p>   and I just want you all to know that we do not intend to weaken</p>
<p>   or deviate or tire or give up in any way.</p>
<p>I can tell you as far as my federal Parliamentary colleagues are</p>
<p>   concerned we have only just begun this campaign. But we haven't</p>
<p>   gone through the political fire that we went through on the 3rd</p>
<p>   of October and in the weeks leading up to it, to give it away in</p>
<p>   the face of an opportunistic performance by the Australian Labor</p>
<p>   Party and the Australian Democrats. And we don't intend to</p>
<p>   weaken in any way.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we do have, as I said, an enormous opportunity.</p>
<p>   It's very exciting, it's very exhilarating and it is quite</p>
<p>   historic to feel that you can be part of shaping events that will</p>
<p>   take this country into the 21st Century. Over the next</p>
<p>   three years we have unrivalled opportunities as Australians, to</p>
<p>   justifiably celebrate the Australian achievement of the last 100</p>
<p>   years, and to also play a very important part in our region in taking</p>
<p>   advantage of the fact that uniquely Australia is an intersection</p>
<p>   of Europe, of North America, and of the Asia-Pacific region. There's</p>
<p>   no country on Earth that is located in the Asian-Pacific region</p>
<p>   that has such profound and enduring links with Europe and with North</p>
<p>   America, and has within its own population now a magnificent contribution</p>
<p>   from people who come from the Asian-Pacific region themselves. </p>
<p>We have a unique intersection of assets of history and geography</p>
<p>   and economic circumstance and we can make a contribution as a result</p>
<p>   of that in a way that no other country can. And we can be listened</p>
<p>   to because of those perspectives in a way that no other country</p>
<p>   can. And as I said earlier it will be a source of great strength</p>
<p>   for me to be able to go to the APEC meeting in Malaysia tomorrow</p>
<p>   and to speak as the leader of a successful economy. To speak as</p>
<p>   the leader of a democratically elected government that has had the</p>
<p>   courage to put a reform program to the Australian people. To speak</p>
<p>   as the leader of a country who understands perhaps better than any</p>
<p>   of the mood of all of the peoples of the Asian-Pacific region, who</p>
<p>   understands the western liberal tradition which we share so richly</p>
<p>   with the United States and Canada and New Zealand. But also understands</p>
<p>   the difficulties through which Indonesia is now passing and understands</p>
<p>   the importance of continued bilateral relations between the democratically</p>
<p>   elected democracies of the region and those countries whose systems</p>
<p>   of government are different from ours. And I go there greatly strengthened</p>
<p>   by the outcome on the 3rd of October. </p>
<p>Finally my friends can I just say to all of you again, as a creature</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party organisation, how much I am in your debt. It</p>
<p>   is an enormous privilege to be leader of the Parliamentary Liberal</p>
<p>   Party, it is of course an even greater privilege to be Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of Australia. Neither of those positions would have come my way</p>
<p>   without the years I spent in the Liberal Party organisation. Without</p>
<p>   that sustenance and without the understanding of the Australian</p>
<p>   people and of the party organisation and the hopes and aspirations</p>
<p>   of Liberals all around Australia that those years gave me I would</p>
<p>   not have aspired to or achieved those positions. I thank you. It</p>
<p>   is a proud moment, it is a great moment. I thank all of you for</p>
<p>   the part that you played in our great victory. Thank you.</p>
