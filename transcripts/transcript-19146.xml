<p>Western Sydney will be designated as an Innovative Region that will help the region bid for a new innovation precinct as part of the Gillard Government's $1 billionPlan for Australian Jobs.</p>
<p>The Government's Plan for Australian Jobs will create ten new Industry Innovation Precincts across Australia.</p>
<p>As an Innovative Region, the Gillard Government will provide $1.5 million for dedicated staff and other resources to work with regional industry organisations, local governments, businesses, local universities, and communities to develop an innovation plan for the region.  This will support a local drive for an Innovation Precinct in Western Sydney.</p>
<p>Home to over 1.6 million people and adding $85 billion a year to the nation's GDP, Greater Western Sydney has the potential to provide a large proportion of Australia's future jobs growth.</p>
<p>At Liverpool Jobs and Skills Expo, the Prime Minister spoke on the importance of innovation for the future of Western Sydney.</p>
<p>To capitalise on the opportunities of the Asian Century, Australian businesses, especially those in Western Sydney, can benefit from more support to develop new products, technologies, skills and ideas to break into new markets.</p>
<p>Australia has one of the best education and research systems in the world  -  but we can do more to translate this advantage into business success on local and world markets.</p>
<p>As part of the Plan for Australian Jobs, announced last month, the Gillard Government has committed $500 million for Industry Innovation Precincts that will bring industry, firms, research institutions, technology experts and government agencies together. They will work to achieve the innovations, connections and scale that our businesses need to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The prospects for innovation in Western Sydney are extensive and include opportunities in industries such the built environment with as many as 32,120 construction firms based in the region, defence and aerospace in Bankstown, food in Luddenham and transport and logistics across the region.</p>
<p>It is also the home to world class research facilities. Yesterday, the Prime Minister opened the University of Sydney's Centre for Carbon, Water and Food at Camden and researchers at the University of Western Sydney are undertaking ground breaking research in the areas of water, communities, children's futures and urban and community development.</p>
<p>Consultation is underway on the developing new precincts, and applications will be considered throughout 2013.</p>
<p>This new industry and innovation network funding will help put Western Sydney in the driver's seat to host a new Innovation Precinct.</p>
<p>In addition, it will also help Western Sydney firms to participate in other innovation precincts around the nation.  </p>
<p>Total funding of $1.5 million over four years will commence this financial year.</p>
