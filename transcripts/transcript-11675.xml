<p>Good evening. The best way to see Telstra improve its services to all</p>
<p> Australians, is to pass a law requiring that to happen. That's exactly</p>
<p> what the Government has done. Our Customer Service Guarantee now even</p>
<p> requires Telstra to pay financial compensation to customers if they do</p>
<p> not meet adequate service levels.</p>
<p>I still believe that Telstra needs to lift its game in the country. But</p>
<p> there is evidence that services are improving. Telstra maintains that</p>
<p> connection times and fault repair times have improved across rural and</p>
<p> remote Australia in the last two years.</p>
<p>They have said that 98% of Telstra's remote area customers are now</p>
<p> being connected within our legislated time frames. In addition, STD charges</p>
<p> have fallen by 45% in real terms over recent years. And country users</p>
<p> will now benefit from the new 15 cent neighbourhood call, expected to</p>
<p> cover about half their local calls.</p>
<p>I want to make it perfectly clear, that we will not fully privatise Telstra</p>
<p> unless a public inquiry certifies that adequate service levels have been</p>
<p> met. And we will work for higher levels of service. From July this year</p>
<p> phone companies will be required to supply new phone connections in rural</p>
<p> and remote areas where there is infrastructure in less than half the time</p>
<p> that is now allowed.</p>
<p>Without the most recent sale of Telstra, we could not establish up to</p>
<p> 500 Rural Transaction Centres. We could not extend SBS Television to the</p>
<p> homes of a further 1.2 million Australians. We could not allow more people</p>
<p> in remote areas to make untimed calls to their neighbours, nor retire</p>
<p> the massive Government debt that Labor left behind. Good night.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
