FOR I-LDIA I October 1980O<br />
ADDRSS TO C. B. D. PA,.<br />
Four years agco, when I delivered the second Coplancd Memorial<br />
Address to _ Q emphasised the importance of restoring<br />
the economic str'ength of Australia, in that address, I set<br />
out our primary economic objective as a governm-ent. I said,<br />
7 mre. s-s. no -way around -the-f v mtalrf'nt<br />
thait resources are scfarce. Ouir policies must<br />
aimn to expand the resources av~ ilable to us,<br />
because only in that w4ay can Auaftraljalls hop1e<br />
t-0 realise SO many of their aspirations. we<br />
have seen only too clearly what happens. when<br />
aspirations run ahead of-. resources."<br />
whe~ n I:. stzitea those principles, four years ago, underlyingq<br />
vihat I said was a confidence that the. prob lems confronting<br />
us were nianageable. I -atrgved th-6ntbat they could ' Anhd would<br />
b6 overconel iand that the successful management of our plolm<br />
was-dependent upon continuation of the Goverrimet": policies.<br />
Witi* ii-r~ i-q~ tC,=.' n aythat, to some extent, we underestimate<br />
5 the severity of the world situation and the entrenched<br />
nature of somne of the difficulties which we have had to face.<br />
As a result, we have had to trim our sails once or twice for<br />
the Vorlek a ha-rsher place than anyone expected five year~ s<br />
Bgu. t we have never lost sigiht of our over-riding objective<br />
of strengthening the Au~ tr-alJ4an ecGQiemfy.<br />

In the three years to 1975-76, there was an averaoe annual<br />
growth in real Com~ onwealth outlays of 10%. in the five year ' a<br />
to 1980-81, we have kept that growth to only about 1% a year.<br />
AS*_.; proportion... of G7DP., co == walth-budget spending Is.<br />
showing a significant reduction on the 1975-76 level. Moreover,<br />
as a proportion of G. D. P, the Cor:' zonwealth budget deficit<br />
has fallen from 4.9% in 1975-76 to. only 1.2i._ And1 lastf<br />
inancial year, we achieved the, largest ever recorded. reduction<br />
in the budget dificit-41.5 billion. This year's budget<br />

Complementing this strategy has been our emphasis On regenerating </p>

charter of the Cormnonwealth tlevelopeMent-Banlk to lend to these<br />

-Most importantly, we have altered th e tax lawsg to make it<br />
easier for small companies to build up reserves, thereby<br />
widening the scope for self -f inancing and investmnent and<br />

business in Austr~ lia has comoe from the steady success of<br />
the general economic strategy.<br />
Of paramount krtportance has been the full restoration of<br />
Ausatralia's international com'petitiveness. Since the<br />
mid 1970st this competitivess has improved by about 145,, and<br />
we are back.* to where we were at the beginning of the. 1970s.<br />
There are many individual firm~ s which have gained from~ our<br />

After-a difficult pariod ii the midd 1970s of weakness in<br />
our. external trading position, we have re-establishe8 a<br />
poition of Ptrength. Last.. y~ e a the-al-anue -oL-trade was the<br />
best f or a decade. There wa-s a more than 30% i-iiarease in -the<br />

real terms in total exports,<br />
This return of ' competitiveness hjacs been fundamentally dependent<br />

the O. E. C. D inflation rate was 12.8%<br />

<p>Tlhe recent business survey by the Confeaeration of Australian<br />
Industry and the BanY. of New South Wale. 9 shows tha4t this<br />
confidence is continuing to gather pace. Two clear<br />
financial indicatora of this atri1linc recoviary are:<br />
the continuing buoyancy In Aus-t. a ian sh tie<br />
and the massive inorgase ill share apital raisings.<br />
During the five years of this Government, share prices have<br />
risen over l which is strik~ ing evidence of iriproved<br />
prof4t--prospet'ts, and the enhanced value of Aust-ral. ia's<br />
productive assets. This is in stark contrast to the painful<br />
experience of the Labor years when share prices fell 27t.<br />
Accompanying the buoyAncy of shar. e Values has: beer% a surge<br />
in. share capital raisings, totalling more than $ 1 billion<br />

It is evezN more piciniflunt tb:= T--he confidence in Nustralia<br />

of about $ 650 million, from 1972-3, to 1974-5.<br />
To have a new Investment confidence ali'e at a timEe we<br />
world trade is depressed and has been slowing, is a<br />
Piotable achiev~ ement. The O. E. C. D. forecast nil growth in the<br />
O. F.. C. D area as a whole for 1980-1, and expect only slugjgish<br />
inprovement in the early part of-tie ei-qbt~ es, Irr-ciur case,<br />
by comparison, we expect to sea non-farm product rl. sing<br />
by about three and a half per cent this year the third<br />
Biuccetiaive year of steady improvement. Moreover, the outlooR<br />
for the early years of this nea decade is very muzh iore<br />
promising than that confronting the world economy.<br />
in many, areaks of our ecoi~ rry.. paTE~ hiarl1i -nose related<br />
to our rich energy resources, decisions for invesb~. ent<br />
orn an unprecedented scale are being taken. The recent<br />
well-publicised survey of major -nw-invest-; e t projects<br />
conducted by the Department of industry and Comm~ erce puts<br />
a, value of $ 29 billion on projects cormitted or in the final.<br />
stages of feasibility study. That fi'qure is an indication<br />
of the magnititde of the opportuinities for investment and<br />
economic growth. which are opening uip to Australia in the<br />
And unobel -there will be other OrojectsRule<br />
Colig forward. 146table &amp; mongst these is the Rnl_ 12r.. Ject.<br />
What all this suggeaits is a dev'elopment pha~ ve before uis ae<br />

re-souz ei vestment tince thl u ' d<br />

new era is in part a response to the oil-crises of the<br />
* 1970s and, in part, a reflecation of our recognition of the<br />
I~ fopportunitios itlplicit in that changing situation; anid<br />
L. </p>
<p>and our implementation of Import parity pricing for oil.<br />
The increased price, sicarcity ari,. uncertainty of oil supplies,<br />
are leading not only to a search for new sources of oil bat<br />
also to iftreasing recognition of the value of Piustralia's<br />
other energy re erves of coa3., uranium and iiatural gas.<br />
Our coal is imrportant both as a direct export and as a source<br />
of electricity. The increase in electricity generation<br />
throughout rthe-Os--wtlÃ±-bp very-nearly equal to the increase<br />
in electricity generating , capacity that occurred over the last<br />
30 years. This offers us an opportunity not previously available<br />

Australia In the 80s a much stronger internatioinal trading<br />
Large and spectacular projects are the maost visible source<br />
of econov5io development. HIowever, it would be! quite wronU<br />
to see Australia's growth in the 1980s as only invol. ving<br />

impoxtant will be the expansion of many thousands of smjaller<br />

the </p>
<p>-6<br />
Labor is proposing what governments of Major countries and<br />
t-heir -central banka, and the leading iinternational economic:<br />
agencies have roundiy rejected. Even the most favourable of<br />
international conditions could not underpin econo: mic growth<br />
if w-, eere + o 1yrch back~ into a periocl of high iiif lation' and<br />
suffer , the negative effects of increased government regulation<br />
of economic development.<br />
It mus. b be clearly understood thattt-confl-ftnce necessary to<br />
em~ bark on long-termi i-nvestrment projects could not be sustained<br />
in such an environment. knongst many crixticismfs I ha,-ve of<br />
Labor Party policies, there is one over-riding orittiismv.___<br />
They have no policy to contain inflation. Their essc-ntial<br />
programme is a massive progra" te of additional spending.<br />
In only_ six aeas they.. p) ise: to spendl an adiditional<br />
$ 2,500 million of taxpayers' money. These proga! umes<br />

that -woulet have to go into any Labor budget. But there are<br />
more. than 250 other programes to which the Labor Party is<br />
comm ittea and which have not been costed.<br />
iitoLa beocr onstoilml ic bgreolvieitvhe -a nthd' a4t FcCvoevloeprnmmeennt, t LAectt ivthiteyr e hboel dnsot hd oubot. xtn<br />
This is ' the way to mud~ h higher inflation. it ig the surest<br />
tonte to the -, estruction of our prograps to date, and our<br />
future potential. But it do-rsn't end there. Kr. Hayden niow<br />
proposea a tax cut when the official Labor Party platforM,<br />
and the dfficial policy statemaents of tlyepa year, firmy<br />
commrit him to the expenditure I have mentioned."<br />
jbIndeed, the concept of lower taxation is alien to Mr Hayeten's<br />
philosop. hy. in the F. E. Chamberlain nlem! orial Lecture in MaCrhla<br />
t~ year, he argued that,<br />
"~ IThe chal-ltnge to . Socialism. is the rapid<br />
spread of philosophieB based on lower tax: es<br />
and smaller governmelit.."*<br />
TheralitTg h that ILAbor proposes much higher tax~ esas<br />
those who have read their platform will ), now. They have<br />
promised a wealth tax. Mr Hayden has repeatedly called for<br />
a--cp~ 4-~ istx And the Party is comr~ itted to a resource<br />
rental tax. Again, I remind you of . r Hayden's owni words,<br />
have committed my organisation to a capital gains<br />
tax, a resource rental tax, a levy on dom~ estic<br />
oil producers, a number of initiatives in the tax<br />
area and other measures of that natuxe...<br />
I -Whht Mr IIoyaen conveniently forgets is the essential. role of<br />
profits in leading to higher investmen~ t and hence more jobs<br />
in Australia. The threats to Australian industry,_ anid indeed<br />
Astralia, % qhich are pooed by the Labor Party are not<br />
those of inflation and taxation. For the Labor policies include<br />
removal of the existing incentives for business as well as<br />
intcreaped government interrv i-tion and reguination of incdstrial<br />
deVe loprnent. I </p>
<p>MrHayclen'a ovn words Are,<br />
" we -would terminate the investm'ent alloviance<br />
introduiced by this, Governmrent...<br />
In jkpri this year,. tMr Hayden attacked the Governm~ ent's<br />
poitbies of incentives to iindustry, referringj to them in<br />
scathing terms as having fattened profits and abolished jobs.<br />
The reaaity is of o~ urse, that these iincentiveg have played<br />
an Important role in* Prom~ tinq investment and creating<br />
new employment opportunities. A further threat lie-s~-.<br />
Labor's expressed cormitnrt to increased government.<br />
intervertion. They are com., ittea1 in section 7 of their<br />
pJlatfdrm clocument, to a variety of means of establiahing<br />
more direct governntent iinfluence, from an e~ i~ rt<br />
public enterprise tonationalisation.<br />
13 praotice-during the past year or wore, they have<br />
out specific proposals for. some 50 statutory<br />
authorities, councils, coidsgions amnd corrmittees. These<br />

national fuel' and nercy casir. hieoiis.....<br />
that obstructed and stifled business expansion, exlortin<br />
and ' clve lopment In the mid<br />
Labor continues to cling to outdated econoymic dckrgtna which<br />
has-been rejected by mnost advanced Western couintries.<br />
Their proposals ar-being_-4ude at'a-tit~ e when) the advanced<br />
* world is moving the other way. These policies have no<br />
relevanice for Australia in the 80s. This is a time for<br />
in this Vuilding programme.<br />
Prom magenxent, we exp~ ect innovation and the leadership<br />

and to seite new opportunities. From the workforce we<br />
responsibility and restraint in recognition of the<br />
fact-that rising living standards for all Australians<br />
can only come from higher productivity.<br />
As a government, we will continue to play our part; to<br />
*-take the necessary. and sornetiries difficti -deci-eetg in order<br />
to mpaintain the overall economic framework and structure Which<br />
are essential for the tichieve-ment of Australia's full<br />
development potential. </p>
