PRIME MINISTER May 1974<br />
AUSTRALIA'S BLACK CULTURE FOR NIGERIA<br />
Australia is to send up to 100 Aboriginals to Lagos next<br />
year to take part in the Second World Black and African Festival<br />
of Arts and Culture, the Prime Minister announced today.<br />
The Festival will be held in and around Lagos in<br />
November/ December, 1975.<br />
Australian participation was invited after a meeting of<br />
the planning committee in Lagos earlier this year.<br />
A committee drawn from the Department of Aboriginal and<br />
Foreign Affairs, the Australian Council for the Arts and the<br />
National Aboriginal Consultative Committee chose four Aboriginals<br />
to attend a planning meeting in Lagos. The four will leave<br />
Australia on 17 May. They are Aboriginal Liaison officers,<br />
Vincent Copley, Gordon Briscoe and Charles Dixon together with<br />
Wandjuk Marika of Yirrkala.<br />
The Festival aims at bringing together Black culture and<br />
the cultures of other nations which affect it throughout the<br />
world. Over 20,000 people from all parts of Africa, North and<br />
South America, the Carribean, Europe, India, Papua New Guinea<br />
and Australasia are expected to take part in the month-long visit.<br />
Australia will be represented by Aboriginal art ranging from<br />
music and dancing to painting, sculpture, drama, writing and<br />
film making. Traditional crafts such as weaving, carving, basket<br />
making and body painting will also be demonstrated at the Festival.<br />
The Nigerian Government will build a theatre and cultural<br />
complex costing $ US36 million, together with a festival village<br />
designed to house 100,000 participants and visitors.<br />
Visitors to the Festival will attend exhibitions of all<br />
aspects of Black culture throughout the world. Seminars will<br />
also be held on the preservation and development of Black<br />
civilisation.<br />
