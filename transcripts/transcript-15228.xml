<p>Thank you very much Bishop Anthony Fisher, Archbishop Dew, Archbishop Wilson, Mr Premier and Auntie Elsie, thank you for your wonderful welcome to country, ladies and gentlemen. The very moving ceremony which we have just witnessed as the young people of New Zealand passed to the young people of Australia, the cross and the icon, is a reminder that next year on World Youth Day will be a magnificent opportunity for the young in their thousands, not only from Australia, but around the world to reaffirm their faith and to remind the world and to remind this nation of the enduring relevance and resonance of the Christian message, not only to the young of Australia and the young of the world, but also to all generations in Australia.</p>
<p>The commitment that has been shown by young people around the world, as the cross and icon has gone on its journey, is a reminder of that faith and of its continuing relevance and strength in our daily lives. This will also be of course a great opportunity for the people of Australia to welcome his Holiness the Pope on his first visit to Australia. We reminder with affection the visit of his great predecessor on two occasions and this will also be an opportunity to extend to him the enormous respect that is felt, not only in the Catholic community of the world, but in the broader Christian community and indeed in the nation generally.</p>
<p>World Youth Day coming to the beautiful city of Sydney and to our nation Australia is an enormous credit to the Catholic Church in this country. I pay tribute to all of those who worked so very hard to make this event a reality. And I know in my personal discussions with Bishop Fisher, with Cardinal Pell, with Danny Casey and with many others just how hard you have worked to bring this about. But the people who have worked just as hard and are just as important to the achievement of World Youth Day, and I know are looking forward to it with great enthusiasm, are the young of Australia who represent....they represent every Catholic diocese  in this country and it's great to see them here. And can I say on behalf of all of your fellow Australians that we will join with great enthusiasm in this magnificent celebration. We are supporting it materially but more importantly we're supporting it with the spirit. And it's an occasion not only for Catholics but for all who profess the Christian faith and the Christian belief to celebrate the marvellous message of the Christian religion, its continuing importance to our country and to the life of all of its citizens. </p>
<p>I wish you all well. It will be a wonderful occasion, World Youth Day 2008. Thank you.</p>
