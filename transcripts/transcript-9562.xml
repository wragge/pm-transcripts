PRIME MINISTER 39/ 95<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
AND THE ACTU.<br />
Today the ACTU and the Government reaffirmed their Accord partnership<br />
and their joint pursuit of progressive economic, social and industrial relations<br />
reform. The meeting noted the significant success in meeting the targets set out in<br />
Accord VII, signed in February 1993. At that time a commitment was made to<br />
the creation of at least 500,000 jobs over the next term of a Labor<br />
Government. This goal was met in March 1995, a year ahead of schedule,<br />
with the number of extra jobs now being 550,000.<br />
Accord VII also had an inflation goal of price increases generally not<br />
exceeding those of our major trading partners. This target is being met<br />
comfortably, and the on-going success on the inflation side was confirmed<br />
fast week with the release of data showing that the underlying rate of price<br />
increase continues to be lower than 2 per cent.<br />
The trend to wage fixing through bargaining at industry and workplace levels<br />
is an essential part of the current Accord, and the sustained, orderly and<br />
accelerating movements in these directions are a significant feature of<br />
contemporary industrial relations reform.<br />
Over the last two years an additional 30 per cent of workers on Federal<br />
Awards have registered enterprise agreements, with the number of<br />
employees in these arrangements now standing at 1.44 million, or nearly<br />
per cent of all workers under Federal Awards. The Accord partners regret the<br />
relative lack of progress in enterprise bargaining under most State systems,<br />
which itself is evidence generally of the lack of strong leadership outside the<br />
-Federal sphere.<br />
Safety net adjustments in the award system have ensured that all workers<br />
who are not advantaged by the movement towards enterprise-based<br />
bargaining are able to be protected from real income reductions and the loss<br />

compromised, even with a significant reorientation towards decentralised<br />
negotiation. The Government remains committed to ensuring that the needs </p>
<p>of women, migrants and young people are adequately safeguarded under<br />
enterprise bargaining<br />
Further improvements in the social wage have been achieved through<br />
expansions of child-care, the new parenting allowance which was announced<br />
in Working Nation and begins on July 1, and the Government's enhanced<br />
assistance to the long-term unemployed through the implementation of the<br />
Job Compact a commitment without parallel internationally.<br />
As stressed in Accord VII, there is a need to continue building a solid<br />
foundation for better retirement incomes, and progress has been maintained<br />
in this area. The introduction of award superannuation combined with the<br />
Superannuation Guarantee arrangements has meant that there has been a<br />
doubling in the proportion of workers covered. Once the luxury of the<br />
wealthy, superannuation is now a right not a privilege for all. Of course,<br />
the Accord partners remain committed to the maintenance of an adequate<br />
age pension as a safety net.<br />
The Government and the ACTU will work towards establishing Accord VIII<br />
shortly after the Budget is delivered. Like all previous Accord arrangements,<br />
it will emphasise social protection in the context of progressive and efficient<br />
economic and industrial relations reforms. Matters of detail and specific<br />
commitments will depend on the initiatives of the Budget.<br />
In the lead-up to the Budget, the ACTU and the Government reaffirm their<br />
resolve to sustain reductions in unemployment, and to reduce long-term<br />
unemployment in particular through the vigorous implementation of the<br />
policies of Working Nation. A further minimum jobs target will be announced<br />
in the new Accord.<br />
Controlling inflation remains a priority of the Accord partners, and this<br />
Statement further endorses the need to keep price increases at low levels to<br />
protect workers' living standards. There will be a continuing commitment to<br />
maintaining low inflation as achieved in Accord VII.<br />
The need to boost both national savings and retirement incomes and to<br />
achieve increased levels and coverage of superannuation are crucial<br />
elements of medium-term economic planning. But in so doing the<br />
implications for the contemporary living standards of lower paid workers must<br />
be taken into account.<br />
Similarly, progress is expected in other areas of the social wage.<br />
Specifically, the Government has already acknowledged the case for publiclyfinanced<br />
maternity leave, a position supported by the Accord partners. The<br />
Government will be responding in this area in the Budget, and remains<br />
committed to the implementation of progressive social wage improvements.<br />
There are times when economic circumstances demand that the stance of the<br />
Government's budget policy be reviewed. It is understood that this is such a </p>
<p>time and that the Budget needs to redress the overall balance between<br />
outlays and receipts. However, the important bottom line must be that<br />
revisions to fiscal arrangements show the utmost sensitivity to the needs of<br />
the economically and socially disadvantaged.<br />
Partnerships between governments and the representatives of workers, and<br />
the substantial benefits that they deliver, should not be taken for granted.<br />
What has been achieved over the last twelve years would not have come<br />
about under the Federal Coalition. Future gains in the social wage, and fair<br />
and orderly transitions to more efficient working environments, would not be<br />
possible under the Federal Coalition.<br />
The Liberal and National parties have shown no interest in or understanding<br />
of the Accord processes. They have opposed almost all wage increases<br />
since 1983, they have rejected socially innovative projects to assist the most<br />
disadvantaged, and they have consistently failed to support the<br />
Government's progressive and long-range planning for retirement incomes.<br />
Of most concern for Australian workers and families is the Coalition's<br />
approach to industrial relations matters, in particular their hostility to the<br />
award system and their advocacy of individual work contracts. Such<br />
individual contracts would be implemented under the Coalition without any<br />
guarantees of leave loadings, redundancy payments, superannuation,<br />
penalty rates and paid holidays, and must mean lower rewards for the<br />
majority of workers.<br />
The Australian incomes policy is perhaps the most successful social,<br />
economic and industrial relations reform partnership anywhere in the world.<br />
Its achievements illustrate the extraordinary potential for progressive<br />
improvement in the organisation of and rewards from work, and how these<br />
changes can be enacted without sacrificing the traditional Australian concern<br />
with a fair go for all.<br />
