FOR MEDIA 5 OCTOBER 1989<br />
The Government has decided to reduce greatly the area known<br />
as the Kakadu Conservation Zone and correspondingly increase<br />
the area of Kakadu National Park. The remaining area, from<br />
Coronation Hill to El Sherana, will be the subject of<br />
concurrent inquiry processes as outlined below.<br />
Reducing the Conservation Zone<br />
A Government decision of 4 June 1987 laid down the following<br />
principles for the resolving of the final boundaries of<br />
Kakadu Stage III and the Conservation Zone<br />
there will not be any increase in the overall size of<br />
the Conservation Zone;<br />
any change should, as far as possible, involve an<br />
increase in the size of the South Alligator River<br />
catchment within the Park; and<br />
any change should, as far as practicable, maximise the<br />
area of Park around sites of particular environmental<br />
and heritage value.<br />
In accordance with the thrust of that decision, especially<br />
points and the Government has now decided to reduce<br />
the Conservation Zone to the strip of leases bounded by<br />
Coronation Hill and El Sherana.<br />
This will put into the Park the entire catchment area of the<br />
South Alligator River except for that exploration strip<br />
where mining exploration work has been carried out. As<br />
compared with this strip, nowhere else in the present<br />
Conservation Zone has there been investment in exploration.<br />
Because of the very great importance Australians properly<br />
attach to Kakadu and the greatly increasing value of the<br />
area in terms of tourism, the Government has decided that it<br />
could not responsibly err on the side of risk to the Kakadu<br />
wetlands fed from the catchment area. Our international<br />
obligations arising from the World Heritage listing<br />
underline the need for our position to be one of maximum<br />
care and protection, rather than taking chances. </p>
<p>Inquiries<br />
The first inquiry arises from a request already received<br />
from the Jawoyn Association by the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs, Mr Hand, to issue a declaration protecting the<br />
Sickness Country which includes Coronation Hill and El<br />
Sherana. This request has been made under the<br />
Commonwealth's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
Heritage Protection Act.<br />
The Jawoyn have also applied under the Northern Territory<br />
Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act for the Sickness Country to be<br />
registered as a Sacred Site.<br />
The advice available to the Commonwealth Government was that<br />
the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs can nominate a person to<br />
prepare a report under sub-section 10( 4) of the Heritage<br />
Protection Act in anticipation of the possibility that a<br />
certificate will be issued under the Sacred Sites Act<br />
allowing disturbance of the land. The Minister has decided<br />
to do so.<br />
Seeking a report at this stage on the Aboriginal heritage<br />
application will place the Minister in a better position to<br />
deal with the application should the Northern Territory<br />
Sacred Sites Authority or the Northern Territory Minister<br />
for Lands agree to an application for mining or exploration<br />
in the area that is unacceptable to the Jawoyn. The calling<br />
for a Heritage Act report now will avoid delay in dealing<br />
with the application, noting that the Northern Territory<br />
Minister for Lands has said publicly that the Jawoyn would<br />
have recourse to the Commonwealth legislation should the<br />
Northern Territory Government reject the Jawoyn application.<br />
The particular circumstances of this case, whereby the issue<br />
of mining or exploration licences is the Commonwealth's<br />
responsibilty, distinguishes it from the usual situation<br />
whereby the Northern Territory would have this role. In<br />
these more usual situations, the Commonwealth would only<br />
need to consider seeking a report in the event that it is<br />
asked to intervene after the NT processes have been<br />
completed but are seen by the Aboriginal custodians as not<br />
providing adequate protection.<br />
The second inquiry relates to economic and environmental<br />
considerations. The Government has received an<br />
Environmental Impact Study on Coronation Hill.<br />
If this were the only relevant consideration the Government<br />
could be expected to take a decision at this point as to<br />
mining, subject only to proper processes regarding<br />
Aboriginal claims.<br />
But this is not the case. There is a series of leases along<br />
the South Alligator River extending from Coronation Hill to<br />
El Sherana. </p>
<p>The Coronation Hill mine and the nearby El Sherana deposit<br />
would have their ores processed at a single treatment plant<br />
close to Coronation Hill. Consequently, El Sherana and<br />
Coronation Hill, taken together, or in conjunction with<br />
development of other leases between the two, could well have<br />
a size and complexity of operation which would have a total<br />
impact representing an unacceptable hazard to the wetlands<br />
of the existing world Heritage area. Any development of El<br />
Sherana would mean significant modification and expansion at<br />
Coronation Hill including extra processing, storage and<br />
tailings facilities.<br />
Moreover, even if they were separate operations the<br />
cumulative risk they pose to the Park might be judged as<br />
excessive. The El Sherana mineral deposit might prove to be far richer<br />
than the one at Coronation Hill. Approval now for<br />
Coronation Hill therefore could prejudice the possible<br />
development of a potentially richer ore body at El Sherana<br />
were the Government later to judge that the risk could only<br />
justify one mine.<br />
Therefore the Government has decided that over and above the<br />
EIS covering only Coronation Hill, it needs a single<br />
coherent assessment of the economic and environmental<br />
considerations relating to this strip along the river.<br />
Inquiry Processes<br />
The Resource Assessment Commission ( RAC) has been set up by<br />
the Government to conduct inquiries into major, complex and<br />
contentious resource use issues, with the object of<br />
improving the basis on which the Government's decisions are<br />
made. Among the matters which it may be required under the<br />
Act to address are the environmental, cultural, social,<br />
economic and other values of the resource under reference<br />
and the losses and benefits involved in various alternative<br />
uses, or combinations of use of that resource.<br />
In view of the important conservation and economic values of<br />
the Coronation Hill to El Sherana exploration area, the<br />
degree of public interest, and the need to weigh up<br />
perfectly legitimate but competing claims on the future use<br />
of the area, the Government has decided to ask the RAC to<br />
undertake an Inquiry into the environmental values of that<br />
area, together with the impact on these values and on the<br />
values of Kakadu National Park of possible mining operations<br />
there. In accordance with previous Cabinet Decisions the<br />
RAC will also be asked to assess the national economic<br />
significance of possible mining developments in the area.<br />
This will provide the opportunity for an independent and<br />
full assessment of both the flora and fauna values of the<br />
region and the region's potential significance as a source<br />
of mineral wealth. All interested parties will have the<br />
opportunity to put their case. To date there has been no<br />
such independent forum at which they can do so. </p>
<p>The Government fully appreciates that there is not at this<br />
stage the specific information on other possible mines in<br />
the strip to permit the RAC to provide a report comparable<br />
in detail to an EIS as such. But what the Government does<br />
expect to receive is an assessment providing a better<br />
overall perspective from which to make a final decision on<br />
Coronation Hill.<br />
The Government would expect to have such a report within<br />
twelve months.<br />
Regarding the Aboriginal application, certain of the issues<br />
to be addressed in the Heritage Act report have some degree<br />
of overlap with issues which might appropriately be<br />
addressed in a Report from the RAC.<br />
Because of the inter-relationship of issues between the two<br />
inquiries, it is sensible for them to be conducted<br />
concurrently, with some overlap of membership between the<br />
two. Justice Stewart, the Chairman of the RAC, therefore will<br />
chair the Aboriginal Heritage inquiry. There is also<br />
expected to be other commonality between the two; for for<br />
example a resource economist and an environmental expert.<br />
Under the Heritage Act reference, appointment of an<br />
anthropologist might also be appropriate.<br />
This approach will enable the Government to move ahead<br />
concurrently rather than sequentially in addressing all<br />
issues on which outside independent advice is desirable. It<br />
will avoid covering similar ground twice at different points<br />
in time. In the final analysis this is in the interests of<br />
all concerned the Aborigines, the miners and the<br />
environmentalists. </p>
