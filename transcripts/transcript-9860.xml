TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE MTIA ANNUAL DINNER, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA, 27 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much Graham and Jo ( Kraehe), Bert and Pauline ( Evans),<br />
Bill and Barbara ( Page-Hanify), Senator Robert Hill, Senator Kernot,<br />
distinguished members of the diplomatic community, my ministerial and<br />
parliamentary colleagues and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well, I did want to follow you immediately, Graham, so I could get back and<br />
get into the tucker and the wine. But you may be a bit weary and I think I'll<br />
have to cheer you up a bit. It was a reasonably cheerful speech, but only<br />
reasonably cheerful and I thought I would say a few things to you that have<br />
occurred to me in recent times about our prospects and where we are.<br />
We are about to go into, sometime next year, an election campaign where<br />
one half of politics will say we are all ruined and the world is about to end and<br />
the other half will say that things have never been rosier. But I think the truth<br />
of the matter is that we are facing a period of substantial prosperity In the<br />
region in which we live and we are in a good position to capture it and to<br />
grow with it.<br />
We have got a number of commentators in Australia now talking about, for<br />
instance, Don Stammer calls it a ' long lasting upswing that will take us<br />
through to at least the year 2000' and, I think, that if you look around the<br />
world particularly in our region, you can see plenty of reasons why that<br />
probably is so. That is apart from the domestic reasons that we have now got<br />
on top of, a lot of the problems here of competitiveness that we have been<br />
growing quite strongly, certainly in OECD terms and that there is no particular<br />
reason why we shouldn't continue to do that. Our cost structure is fine, the<br />
profit share in the economy is very high, the exchange rate provides a<br />
mechanism for competitiveness, we have essentially now endemically low<br />
inflation and, I think, we can keep that there and we are trying now to remedy<br />
the savings imbalance through the public sector in superannuation as you,<br />
Graham, remarked. </p>

2<br />
So, all those elements are in place and I think there are other good signs too.<br />
The Japanese economy is now starling to show some signs of growth again.<br />
I think the so-called bubble of the late 1980s, they are starting to wear their<br />
way through that problem, the Japanese government has just introduced a<br />
very large stimulatory package which will lift domestic demand and lift activity<br />
in that country. The Yen has started to depreciate against the US dollar<br />
which will lift Japanese competitiveness. This gives the breathing space in<br />
terms of their own productivity changes and if that economy starts to lift again<br />
it will have a lot lugging power for Australia.<br />
The US is still bowling along quite well at around 2.5 to 3 per cent or probably<br />
at the moment just over 3 per cent. China is growing more slowly than it was<br />
two years ago, but still at such a speed as to provide a lot of demand in this<br />
part of the world. So, the environment we find ourself in is quite good, even<br />
Europe is starting to pick up now with the German economy knocking up<br />
around 3 per cent and the British economy doing quite well in terms of<br />
growth. So, the scene is really quite an up-beat one in terms of growth and<br />
activity. Given that we have now got a much higher proportion of our product<br />
in exports, there is no reason why that can't make quite a substantial<br />
difference to us.<br />
I think that that presents some real opportunities for us and the Government<br />
is trying to make the most of those opportunities by our trade penetration in<br />
the region and also shifting the pattern of what we are doing here. It is worth<br />
recalling, I think, that a decade ago we were exporting 13 per cent of GDP.<br />
The middle range of the OECD countries is between about 23 and 25 per<br />
cent of GDP. We were lagging way behind. In 1983 we were right at the<br />
bottom of the pack. Since then, of course, we have had a very big change in<br />
opening up our economy and competitiveness so now we have got exports<br />
running at around 22 per cent of GDP. -We are not quite up there at that, if<br />
you like, mid range of the OECD, but we are closing quickly and, of course, 9<br />
per cent of GDP the difference GDP this year is $ 500 billion 9 per cent is<br />
billion, you can just imagine what that current account would look like If<br />
that transition had not occurred. I mean, you would be sitting here In a<br />
comatose. economy, growing at probably 1 to 1.5 per cent a year with high<br />
interest rates holding it down and those who had a quid would keep a quid<br />
and those without it would never get one and there would be a lot losing it.<br />
As a consequence that $ 45 billion in addition to exports a year has<br />
completely transformed the face of the Australian economy and, of course,<br />
elaborately transformed manufactures are now leading the way in terms of<br />
our growth. That is a very, I think, important change and it is also just worth<br />
recalling that you hear a bit of doom saying about our debt and we certainly<br />
have to keep an eye on it. But, 10 years ago 21 per cent of our export<br />
proceeds went to paying our interest. This year it is I11 per cent. So, there<br />
has been a very big transformation in the debt service component of the<br />
Australian current account. You might say ' well, we have got substantial<br />
national debt', we have. Perhaps like the person in the street with a big </p>
<p>T2EL8:. Nov. 95 0: 31 No. 004 P. 03/ 10<br />

mortgage, they have just had a doubling of their income, it certainly makes<br />
you sleep better at night and that is what has happened to us. Our debt<br />
service component has come down immeasurably and we are in better<br />
shape. The other thing that I think is worth saying is that and Graham made a couple<br />
of comments about the primary exports sector, obviously his company is not a<br />
foundation member of AMIC or any of those other bodies, but I am rather<br />
bullish about the terms of trade. The terms of trade have been shifting on<br />
Australia since 1950. In 1950 the things we sold to the world were valuable<br />
and the things we bought were relatively inexpensive. Resources were<br />
expensive and manufactures were cheap and we had, therefore, a very high<br />
standard of living in the post war years. That all changed so we got to those<br />
absolutely depression level terms of trade in 1985/ 86, the period that I talked<br />
about the banana republic and those banana republic terms of trade. That<br />
was probably our low point, but I think we are probably going to see, with a<br />
rise in the Chinese economy, India, South America, Russia, all really joining<br />
the world economy certainly for the first time in the case of China, India and<br />
South America and for Russia the first time since World War 1, 1 think we are<br />
probably going to see an upward pressure on prices and more value<br />
attaching to real things as distinct from manufactured things.<br />
I think the premium that has been on widget making technology, gadgets<br />
which has carried a lot of industrial societies along for quite a long time is<br />
probably going to shift given that most countries are now in the gadget<br />
business, whether they be developing economies like China or new<br />
industrialising economies like Thailand for instance, or ones that now have<br />
the aura of a developed economy such as Singapore, these are all countries<br />
that have enjoyed a premium from technology. But, I think, there is going to<br />
be a swing back to real resources, those finite things which for some reason<br />
or another have fallen in value and, I think, if Australia actually gets the<br />
double with a high value added manufacturing industries and at the same<br />
time a pick up In the terms of trade, we'll start shooting back up that Income<br />
curve which we slipped down between 1950 and the mid 1980s.<br />
So, ther is a lot going on out there, I think, and a lot of countries you<br />
compare us with in the industrialised world don't have the resource base we<br />
have, they don't have the capacity to produce food the way we do, yet at the<br />
same time now with an educated population and a much greater commitment<br />
on the part of industry to produce transformed things we can pick up that<br />
premium and at the same time improve our position on the resources front.<br />
Now, that is a reasonably good outlook I think and the other thing then is our<br />
penetration of these markets. Graham mentioned APEC, let me just say a<br />
couple of things about it. The APEC meeting in Osaka was, of course, a<br />
watershed for the region and for Australia. What it meant was that the Bogor<br />
declaration which proclaimed free trade in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for<br />
developed countries and 2020 for developing countries was transformed into<br />
an Action Agenda at Osaka which ran to 35 pages which was absolutely firm<br />
TEL </p>
<p>I' .1L0 J u: 61 No. COU4 F il<br />
4<br />
and solid all the way through in terms of developing that agenda, making a<br />
start in 1997 and putting down a huge down payment on that agenda as the<br />
first round of Uruguay Round commitments, WVTO commitments on the part of<br />
APEC member states. In other words it was not just simply a declaration or<br />
further words, but a very clear commitment on all the member states at Head<br />
of Government level, to actually go down the path of free and open trade and<br />
to do so in a way that also shows the lead in the Uruguay Round.<br />
You could not have believed that such an agreement could have been made<br />
just a couple of years ago. So, this will be not only transforming and<br />
redefining the Asia-Pacific, it will probably lead the world in terms of free<br />
trade given the fact that already 63 per cent of world GDP is in APEC and in<br />
years time 75 per cent of world GDP will be in APEC. Three quarters of<br />
the world's production, half the worlds population and at Head of<br />
Government level we have sat down and hammered that commitment out. In<br />
a structure, I might say, that in a very substantial measure Australia has<br />
invented and dealt itself into. I think those of you who know a bit about the<br />
Government and the way it works know that now no longer is domestic<br />
economic policy and domestic and foreign policy two arms, two separate<br />
arms and two separate areas of Government. But foreign affairs and trade is<br />
as much part of the domestic agenda as any other part of the domestic policy<br />
focus and we tend to try and operate it in a way where one goal serves the<br />
other. Now with' APEC, we have put a body together which I think is going to<br />
change, certainly in the next half century, the political architecture of the<br />
Asia-Pacific, not just the commercial architecture. Because when I was there<br />
recently I came there with Jiang Zemin the Chinese President, having<br />
recently visited South Korea which, of course, would have been unthinkable<br />
at any time since 1949 until now with a Japanese Prime Minister having<br />
visited China, with the Korean President having visited Japan and I think a lot<br />
of this goodwill has come from APEC. The fact that they all meet each other,<br />
know each other and have some confidence of trust in one another means<br />
that these barriers are dropping.<br />
So it has political ramifications as well as trade ramifications and, of course,<br />
we are an integral part of it. It has been, I think, a very key change and one<br />
which Australia should take a fair bit of pride in and I hope more than that a<br />
fair bit of sustenance from because some calculations we have done between<br />
the Industry Commission and a couple of other of the economic intelligence<br />
agencies is that APEC is likely to add about A$ 1 trillion of GOP to the APEC<br />
countries during the period up to about 2015. So this is quite a dramatic<br />
change and, of course, will start to open all that area up.<br />
The reason APEC is working is because it has got a design quality that no<br />
other trade body in the world has. First of all, it is driven by a<br />
Leaders Meeting. It is not a ministerial meeting. It is a H-ead of Government<br />
meeting and that meeting has decided the end-points of the trade<br />
liberalisation. Whereas in that drawn out process of the Uruguay Round,<br />
ILL: </p>
<p>TEL 26,. 10V 95 0 -1 N'o . CC4 F'. 05/<br />
there were never any end-points. There was only what you could garner from<br />
the person next door and it was all based around the proposition that trade<br />
liberalisation is something we had to do, but we didn't like it very much.<br />
So you had to give something away just to. sort of, get along and to get your<br />
share. Whereas what has happened here is that the APEC leaders have actually<br />
decided that trade liberalisation is a good thing and that they will free up their<br />
markets in goods and services by a certain date and the process will then be<br />
driven towards that by the Leaders Meeting. In other words, it is just<br />
completely different to the Uruguay process altogether and thinking of the<br />
design of APEC and how it might function has been thinking about how we<br />
can really change the whole of the Asia-Pacific, keep East Asia properly<br />
resourced and keep it growing because Graham made the point about these<br />
high growth rates in East Asia. Well if you have got a relatively small<br />
economy, you can grow at 6 or 8 per cent because off a small base you can<br />
get large increments to growth. But you get the Australian economy which is<br />
$ 500 billion and grow it at 4 per cent, there is a $ 20 billion increment to<br />
wealth. That is a large proportion. For instance, it is a third of the size of the<br />
Malaysian economy our growth in one year equals a third of the size of the<br />
Malaysian economy. So just keeping that sort of resourcing up to it is an<br />
enormous challenge.<br />
Now all of this is going to happen, of course, in the Asia-Pacific with China<br />
requiring I mean I have got just a couple of statistics here, Talking about<br />
energy. For instance, East Asia's demand for energy is going to double<br />
every 12 years compared with the world average of every 28 years.<br />
China's growing food needs has an estimated grain shortfall of up to<br />
136 million tonnes annually within 15 years. That is three to six times our<br />
total production of wheat. East Asia's infrastructure requirements for roads<br />
and airports, railways and power stations are likely to exceed $ 2 1/ 2 trillion<br />
over the next decade.<br />
So just keeping that great machine resourced is going to be a great<br />
challenge. In other words, if we want to keep growth in East Asia, and be<br />
part of it,.-we have got to set up the machinery for it to happen. And clearing<br />
the impediments in the road blocks and the logjams out of the system is going<br />
to be an important thing to do to keep it going and that is what APEC is<br />
about. Essentially if we can fuel income growth in East Asia, then we can<br />
participate in it.<br />
Now, fortunately, we have seen a lot of success in this part of the world.<br />
Economies are growing, living standards are rising, people are getting better<br />
opportunities. But this is not so all around the world. Look at Africa, for<br />
instance, Southern Africa, or West Africa. There you have got, you know,<br />
faltering political structures, falling real incomes. It doesn't have to be the<br />
way it is here in East Asia. But keeping East Asia growing, keeping<br />
expectations rising, keeping people happy means keeping income growth<br />
moving, which means keeping resources mobile, which means getting the </p>
<p>I LL: 2 . Nov U NO . u04 F u6/ I'<br />
6<br />
political will to get all that into place. And that is, essentially, what APEC has<br />
done and which Australia, of course, has shown a substantial role in leading<br />
in its formation and in seeking to support those other people who have given<br />
it impetus such as President Soeharto of Indonesia with his declaration, and<br />
Prime Minister Murayama in Japan. So this is Important.<br />
The other thing that I think you should remember too is that the Government<br />
is also working on putting together, as much as we can, some sort of union<br />
between AFTA the ASEAN Free Trade Area and Australia and<br />
New Zealand, or the CER agreement.<br />
Here we have the opportunity in South East Asia of creating a market of<br />
around $ 1.2 trillion in GDP and about 300 million people as a sub-group of<br />
APEC and we are travelling quite well. The Foreign Minister and I are very<br />
pleased with the progress we have been making to date in the AFTA/ CER<br />
discussion and I think, around the region amongst the ASEAN countres,<br />
there is a willingness to involve Australia and New Zealand in this particular<br />
undertaking and where we help them open their markets up and in so doing<br />
create a better mar'Ket for Australian produce.<br />
So it is not anything other than an optimistic scene, I think, and the fact that<br />
we are well placed here in this fast growing part of the world, that we are<br />
starting to get these structures into place, that our own economy is<br />
competitive, we are 40 per cent more competitive this year than we were in<br />
1983 and that competitiveness is now driving that export growth into<br />
elaborately transformed things in services and, of course, in the big bulk<br />
trade of commodities in minerals and, of course, in agriculture. So I would<br />
like to try and ride that process further and to see where it takes us and that,<br />
of course, in trade. The other things in trade facilitation which Is a way of<br />
clearing away impediments to things like the tax system, foreign investment,<br />
customs harmonisation, all of these other things are very much on the<br />
agenda as well.<br />
Now, I think, that we need to savour how far we have come. Certainly<br />
understand how far we have got to go, but know what the opportunities are<br />
and there-are very few OECD countries like Australia that have either the<br />
growth we have, or the growth opportunities we have and they are very much<br />
there. But, first of all, you have got to want to be in it. You have to want to be In it<br />
the East Asian game. You can't be there as a sideline, or a fad. You have<br />
actually got to want to be in it and you can't straggle out there with loyalties to<br />
Whitehall and to Washington believing that you are going to have all the<br />
doors opened up for you in Kuala Lumpur, or Beijing, or Jakarta if our focus<br />
remains only in the places where we have been before. Those things we<br />
have got to do well too and, I think, we can and we continue to keep<br />
for instance, Britain is the largest foreign investor in Australia, we are the<br />
second largest foreign investor in Britain. We have still got very large<br />
investments from the United States. We still have a great strategic </p>
<p>TEL: 2 . NOV.-95 0: 31 No. uu4 F'. 07/ iñ<br />
7<br />
partnership with the United States. But we have got to make our way here<br />
too and I believe we can.<br />
Now Graham said earlier, we have had a period of sub~ stantial industrial<br />
peace and he correctly identified the problems of the CPA dispute and<br />
I would just like to say a couple of things about industrial relations.<br />
One is to say that we have had a dramatic decline in industrial disputation in<br />
this country. The Accord has delivered tremendous certainty, I think, to the<br />
labour market. It has been principal amongst the instruments in reducing<br />
inflation and lifting employment. We have had a 26 per cent increase in<br />
employment since 1963, household disposable income has risen by<br />
per cent since 1 983, household disposable income per capita has risen by<br />
21 per cent and real wages have risen by 7 per cent. So there is a very good<br />
scene there in terms of the workforce and that is reflected in the wage<br />
restraint and the commonsense is reflected in a much higher level of profits<br />
and, of course, stronger levels of investment which has been powering our<br />
rate of growth.<br />
We are growing, on average in the period of this Government, just on twice<br />
the rate of growth on average in the period of the last Coalition Government<br />
and that is, in part, because you can run. the economy faster without<br />
crunching it with interest rates because there is an Accord to rely upon in<br />
terms of wages growth.<br />
Now this dispute we have had is, of course, not in the normal course of<br />
enterprise bargaining, or in wage settlement. The dispute was not about the<br />
normal growth we have had in enterprise bargaining which has changed the<br />
labour market, I think, markedly. It was about, amongst other things, this<br />
whole question of choice and, by and large, CRA had run a policy which said<br />
that if you take a contract you are worth more than If you are on an award.<br />
Or put another way, that it will discriminate in favour of contracts against<br />
award employees who get their conditions by collective bargaining.<br />
Now if the Government were to say to the MTIA, or to the Business Council,<br />
or to AMIC, or any other body that our policy will be and the union's with us,<br />
under the Accord that we will pay workers up to $ 10,000 $ 20,000 a year<br />
more if they are unionists, there would be a hew and cry around the country<br />
you would have to put cotton wool in your ears. What has happened here is<br />
exactly that, but the reverse. They're saying that If you're on a contract, you<br />
can have more because you are worth more. Now, that's not about equal pay<br />
for equal work it's about unequal pay for equal work, and it essentially not<br />
about choice at all it's about discrimination. And CRA played that game,<br />
and quite successfully, until they finally put those civil writs on people, and at<br />
that point, they stubbed their toes and the unions reacted against them.<br />
Now, this Government is not about to discriminate In favour of unionists, we<br />
are not about to go around and say that if you are on an award, there should<br />
be a beneficial offer made and indeed, the ACTU for its part, wants only a </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Nov. 95 0: 31 No. 004 P. 08, i0<br />
level paying field. They want to be able to secure the same wages and<br />
salaries for the same work if somebody is on an award, versus somebody<br />
who is on a contract, and that's what the dispute is about. Now, it's not about<br />
the way forward, it's not about labour market reform, It's not about organising<br />
the workplace, it's not about best practice, it's not about training and<br />
retraining, because if we look through the successes we have had in<br />
enterprise bargaining in Australia which now affects, of course, about twothirds<br />
of all federal award employees.., well, look at the great industrial<br />
companies in Japan, and other big companies around the world who have<br />
made very great changes in productivity levels, these have generally come by<br />
teamwork, team spirit.<br />
( tape break)<br />
And that's why I wasn't at all surprised when the Industrial Commission held<br />
in favour of no discrimination being brooked or tolerated. In a sense, there is<br />
no place for ideology in this. And what, I think, the company is doing<br />
essentially, is taking an ideological view that if you are on a contract, you are<br />
more useful, and therefore, you are worth more. Now, you know that there<br />
has been the Employment Contracts Act in New Zealand since 1991, but I<br />
don't know whether you know that labour productivity has grown by 1 a year<br />
since. And labour productivity in Australia has grown at 2.4% over the same<br />
period. So, I don't think it's the answer to a maidens prayer, though New<br />
Zealand, of course, has set a model which it's comfortable with, and which<br />
can operate its economy. Can I just remind you, too, of the US Labour<br />
Secretary Robert Reich, who not long ago at a European OECD Conference<br />
lamented the absence of flexibility in the US labour market, and the US<br />
economy. This is a country where the model that CRA wants is the vogue<br />
where people are basically on contracts, and Robert Reich said " in the United<br />
States, we have had huge employment, but falling real wages for 16 years.".<br />
The US has a speed limit of 2.5% growth, and whenever it gets over that,<br />
they start pulling it back, and that 2.5% growth you would have thought by<br />
now would have been 4-5% if those who believe in flexibility, coming from<br />
these sorts of industrial arrangements, having seen them operate for so long,<br />
that flexibility would have been there. Well, the flexibility isn't there, the US<br />
is still a much more rigid economy than it ought to be, and taking securing<br />
an army of working poor is doing not very much for flexibility, but it is also<br />
ripping the soul out of US society.<br />
And, you know, I noticed just a little chilling statistic in Time Magazine a week<br />
or so ago, while I was flying up to Japan, saying that gunshots account for<br />
more deaths of young people under 16 in California than road accidents, or<br />
any other category of damage. Now, they're unemployed, they're on the<br />
streets, and no-one cares about them. And that's not what we went here, and<br />
we are not going to have it here.<br />
Now, we're going to have a debate in the election campaign around these<br />
issues. Our Coalition friends are here tonight, and I just want to make this<br />
point to them, and to you to say, the Government doesn't mind an honest </p>
<p>TEL: 28. Nov .95 0: 31 No .004 P .09/<br />
9<br />
debate on this, our model is enterprise bargaining, collective bargaining.<br />
each business tailoring its productivity seeking to draw from its employees<br />
more efficient work, and sharing the gains between profits and wages. That's<br />
happening I think we are starting to do quite welt with enterprise bargaining,<br />
we have a very large training agenda, we have got an international best<br />
practice agenda sitting there, we have got a safety net which looks after<br />
those people who can't get an increase under the enterprise bargaining<br />
system, and in terms of the contracts, we are saying in that respect, equal<br />
pay for equal work. That's the model we are in. We are saying if you can't<br />
get an enterprise deal, you pick up something under the safety net, but if you<br />
can, you and your employer can actually produce a better business which is<br />
more profitable. There's sense about that there has been a great evolution<br />
in that, and there is, I think, a great deal of sense and respectability about<br />
that.<br />
And if the Coalition believes that it doesn't believe in enterprise bargaining in<br />
this way, that it doesn't have a commitment to collective bargaining, that it<br />
doesn't have a no-disadvantage test, that it doesn't believe the Industrial<br />
Commission has a place in all this, then it should say so. And say why it<br />
believes this. To say why it believes such a system would be better for<br />
Australia. Because if they believe it, presumably, they can argue for it, and<br />
make a case for it. But what we won't be having in the election campaign is a<br />
radical change to the labour market by stealth of one side pretending they<br />
have got the policies of the other side, when in fact, they have a completely<br />
different set of policies altogether. Stabbing the Commission in the stomach,<br />
knocking it out of the system, not having a no-disadvantage test, not<br />
effectively giving people a choice these, I think, are alt the recipes, I believe,<br />
of going back to the conflict model that we all came from in the late 1 9709,<br />
which saw a spurt of wages growth, and then a big fall in real wages<br />
thereafter. The inflation rate knocked into 10-11 investment smashed to<br />
pieces, and rising unemployment. That's the sort of model out there. Or,<br />
there's the model we have had as we gradually get the flexibility in the labour.<br />
market, sector by sector, company by company.<br />
Now, I think we are making the grade. A couple of weeks ago I was at tube<br />
makers in.-Queensland, and I was very impressed by a couple of people a<br />
couple of working fellows I sat down with for lunch, and they were literally<br />
blue-collar people in blue overalls, sitting up there talking about how they had<br />
put the last new line production line into the business, and quite proud of<br />
the little innovations they had brought to it. And 1 said to one how are you<br />
going? And he was about 55 or 56, and he said " look, this is the best I have<br />
ever had it in my working life. The best wages I have ever had, the best<br />
working conditions I have ever had, and more time to myself'. And I said,<br />
" well, you please me no end, telling me that", and he said " no, we're looking<br />
forward to the third round of our enterprise bargaining. The first round, it was<br />
pretty much as what we had. The second round we made some real gains,<br />
and we now think all of us think we can do a great job", and they all said<br />
hear-hear down the table. Now, I think that mood is around, and I think we<br />
can really pull it together and make it work. But I think that if we are going to </p>
<p>TEL<br />
split people off, and cut their wages, we will not grow the Australian economy<br />
out as a low-wage country. The Australian economy is going to make it by<br />
innovation, by education, by elaborately transformed things. It is also going<br />
to make it by accessing those big markets for the things the raw materials<br />
we produce, and the secondary processing of them. It's not going to make it<br />
by low wages this is not going to be a low wage, low rent society, and nobody<br />
should try and take it there. But if the Coalition want to take it there,<br />
then this will be the issue in the election. That is, one where we will have a<br />
referendum on industrial relations, on wages and conditions. Where we are<br />
not going to see a sea-change of the kind of country we are by stealth.<br />
Because in this country, IR is not just a matter of factory floor wages or<br />
conditions it's about the sort of society we are, how we relate to one<br />
another. Because your income gives you that mobility, it lets you pass<br />
through the barriers, it gives you your standard of living, it looks after your<br />
family, it brings you the human happiness that the political system should<br />
bring. It's part of the fabric of the way we are, of the sort of country we have<br />
become, the sort of society we now are. And this is why we believe it's<br />
central and it is a debate where we can participate with a bit of goodwill and<br />
keep our society together, and God forbid the point where young adolescents<br />
are finding we're losing more of them from gunshot wounds than we are<br />
through road accidents, or drugs, or anything else. That we actually have a<br />
society that actually does care about one another, and where we have some<br />
common values and some cohesion and some real beliefs about the sort of<br />
country we have become.<br />
So, if CRA wants to go out, and run this debate fine. The unions will rise to<br />
the occasion, no doubt, and as a consequence, I don't know whether any of<br />
us are going to be advanced by it. But let's not call it reform call it ideology<br />
by all means, but not reform. So, perhaps I could conclude on this point -I<br />
really think we are in for a long period of growth, after the turn of the century<br />
at least. I see nothing coming in our way any impediments to knock that<br />
around. Our cost structure is in good shape, our fundamental inflation rate is<br />
in good shape, our competitiveness is in good shape, and our strategies<br />
positioning in the Asia Pacific has never been better. Our bilateral<br />
relationships with the countries around us with Indonesia, with Malaysia,<br />
with Singapore, with Thailand, the Philippines, China, Japan have never<br />
been better, We have got huge opportunities there we have got he trade<br />
barriers down, we have got best practice coming in, we now have<br />
international businesses to compare ourselves with, we are in there for the<br />
break we have never, ever had before. We have had these phases In the<br />
past like, we call the golden years of the 60s. But they were golden for<br />
Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and a few other countries. They<br />
were not like now, where they are golden for the whole of South East Asia, for<br />
the rising income levels of North Asia, for substantial parts of Europe. This is<br />
a period, I think, none of us have lived through one as exciting as this. And<br />
let's not trade it away in gloom. Thank you very much.<br />
