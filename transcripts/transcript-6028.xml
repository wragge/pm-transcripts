FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 3.8 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
BUSHFIRES COMMONW1EALTH ASSISTANCE TO<br />
VICTORIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
The disastrous bushfires, in Victoria and South Australia have<br />
been on an immense scale. The tragedy has affected all<br />
Australians. I have, over the last two days, by visiting<br />
affected areas., seen the stark evidence of loss and<br />
suffering. I have informed the Premiers of both States that the Commonwealth<br />
stands ready to give urgent and sympathetic consideration to<br />
measures they may wish to propose to restore and rebuild<br />
communities. officials of the three Governments ar-e in<br />
constant liaison to identify needs and develop measures for<br />
meeting these needs.<br />
These measures would be in addition to the standing natural<br />
disaster relief arrangements under which the Commonwealth is<br />
providing assistance to alleviate immediate hardship through<br />
the resources of the Defence Force and other Co" mmonwealth<br />
agencies. I announced yesterday " seeding" contributions to emergency<br />
relief funds in Victoria ($ 400,000) and South Australia<br />
($ 200,000) to help in floating these public appeals.<br />
Much more will, of course, be needed and will be provided<br />
by the Commonwealth once the total damage has been assessed.<br />
This will take some days and is likely to run into tens of<br />
millions of dollars.<br />
I have now proposed to the Premiers of Victoria and South<br />
Australia initial instalments of that Commonwealth assistance<br />
in azv-zce of settling final details. In the case of Victoria<br />
the Commonwealth will immediately advance $ 10 million, and<br />
$ 6 million will be provided to South Australia against<br />
Commonwealth contributions under the Natural Disasters<br />
Relief Arrangements ( NDRA).<br />
The Commnonwealth is also prepared to extend categories of<br />
# ssistance beyond the core measures under NDRA ( set out in the<br />
attachment) to meet the following:<br />
low-interest loans of up to $ 50,000 to primary<br />
producers and small business;<br />
concessional loans of up to $ 22,000 to owner-occupiers<br />
to meet the difference between insurance recoveries<br />
and the cost of replacing their principal residence; </p>
<p>* assistance with freight costs of stock and fodder,<br />
including cost of transport of saleable stock to local<br />
abattoirs, arnd also the cost of disposal of dead stock;<br />
* up to $ 1,200 per kilometre for materials for boundary<br />
fencing abutting roads, railways, water frontages, game<br />
reserves, Forestry Commission and unalienated Crown<br />
land;<br />
* concessional loans for re-establishment of facilities<br />
such as recreation camps.<br />
These programs will be administered by the States. The<br />
Commonwealth reimburses the States oni a 3: 1 basis for their<br />
expenditures on NDRA measures. ATTACHMENT<br />
NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF ARRANGFEMENTS -CORE MEASURES APPLICABLE<br />
