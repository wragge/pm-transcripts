JOINT COMMUNIQUE<br />
VISIT OF PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN<br />
Mr. Hayato Ikeda, Prime Minister of Japan,<br />
accompanied by Mrs. Ikeda is visiting Australia as the guest<br />
of the Government of the Cormonwealth of Australia from 29th<br />
September to 3rd October, 1963. During his stay in Australia,<br />
Mr. Ikeda will visit Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and have<br />
discussions with Sir Robert Menzies and other Cabinet Ministers.<br />
The Prime Ministers of Japan and Australia have had<br />
cordial and valuable talks marked by frank discussions of the<br />
international situation in general, and covering also consideration<br />
of means of promoting still further the friendly relations<br />
between the tw-countries.<br />
In discussing the international situation, the Prime<br />
Ministers established that there was a close identity between<br />
their respective international policies. They lo-ked forward to<br />
close co-operation in the future, through consultations at<br />
various levels with the aim of promoting the interest of the<br />
two countries and of the free world.<br />
The Prime Ministers especially welcomed the r a prtial<br />
nuclear test ban agreement which they hoped would be supported<br />
by all countries, not least of all by countries in the Pacific<br />
or with interests in the Pacific.<br />
Noting that both Australia and Japan had welcomed the<br />
formation of Malaysia, and recognising the common destiny and<br />
responsibility of their two countries in Asia and the Western<br />
Pacific area, the two Prime Ministers expressed their deep<br />
concern for the situation in that area, and agreed that the<br />
two countries should closely co-operate in contributing to the<br />
attainment of peace and economic progress in that part of the<br />
world. They discussed ways in which Australia and Japan might,<br />
through the Colombo Plan and in other ways, co-operate in<br />
furthering economic development in South East Asia.<br />
The Prime Ministers expressed pleasure and satisfaction<br />
at the recent signing of a Trade Agreement between Australia<br />
and Japan, providing for a full GATT relationship between<br />
Australia and Japan and withdrawing the Article 35 reservation.<br />
It was confidently expected that the new agreement would lead<br />
to a further expansion of the mutually beneficial trade relations<br />
already existing between the two countries.<br />
The two Prime Ministers expressed their satisfaction<br />
at the further increase in both personal contacts and cultural<br />
exchanges between the two countries, and agreed that the two<br />
Governments would endeavour to promote these developments by<br />
every possible means.<br />
The two Prime Ministers considered that Prime<br />
Minister Ikeda's visit to Australia was of great significance<br />
to the furtherance of mutual understanding and friendly relations<br />
between the two countries, and agreed that the two Governments<br />
should keep the closest possible contacts with each other both<br />
at the ministerial and official levels.<br />
