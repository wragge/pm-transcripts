<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning..well good afternoon to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you Steve?</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Now Prime Minister, last Thursday you were calling the lamb decision</p>
<p> hypocritical and appalling, and now it's just an odd difference of</p>
<p> opinion. What happened to your anger?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's not an odd difference of opinion. I told the President both</p>
<p> in a private discussion and also during our luncheon, our working</p>
<p> luncheon, that this decision had caused more anger in Australia on</p>
<p> trade than any other decision in the time that I'd been involved.</p>
<p> So I don't know that there's been any alteration at all.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>How did the President react?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he understood how upset we were. I mean look, we have to be realistic.</p>
<p> He's taken a decision based on domestic political considerations and</p>
<p> Australia has been hurt in the process. And he's aware of that. I</p>
<p> made that very plain to him both publicly and privately. And it remains</p>
<p> what I described it to him and that is a decision that has upset Australia</p>
<p> on trade more than any other decision that the American...this or</p>
<p> any other American administration has taken. But what I was at pains</p>
<p> to say today was that there are other aspects of the relationship</p>
<p> that oughtn't to be contaminated by this decision. Now that doesn't</p>
<p> in any way diminish the concern and sense of frustration that we feel</p>
<p> about the decision. We can't reverse the decision and I think anybody</p>
<p> who suggests that we can is deluding themselves.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>So does the American President still support, in spite of the lamb</p>
<p> decision, does he still support a more open trading system?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he told me that he did and I was asked about this by the press</p>
<p> afterwards and I said well, it's a question of reacting to outcomes.</p>
<p> I mean he told me that he remained committed to achieving a more liberalised</p>
<p> trading environment out of the World Trade Organisation. He said he</p>
<p> would be coming to the APEC meeting in New Zealand in September, that</p>
<p> he was attracted to the idea of a leaders' declaration supporting</p>
<p> freer trade out of that meeting. He said all of these things. Now</p>
<p> people will make their own judgements about that. I think my judgement</p>
<p> is that I will see what happens. But I can only repeat what he said</p>
<p> to me and what I said to him. In the end we are all judged by our</p>
<p> behaviour and the outcomes we achieve rather than by the words we</p>
<p> use and that applies to him as it does to me or indeed any other political</p>
<p> leader.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But I'm wondering whether we can read into that: yes he still supports</p>
<p> a more open trading system unless it impacts on American producers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think people in Australia would be entitled to read that into</p>
<p> it. I mean there's no doubt that America has taken a decision on this</p>
<p> issue which looks after Americans and has adverse consequences for</p>
<p> Australians. Now of course they have.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So Prime Minister, in the course of your discussions with the President</p>
<p> you didn't perhaps feel inclined to remind him about our security</p>
<p> relationship and the fact that he's got a couple of bases on Australian</p>
<p> soil?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I didn't, and I don't believe I should. And the reason for that</p>
<p> is that it's not in Australia's interest to do so. Some people in</p>
<p> Australia have the quite erroneous idea that the security relationship</p>
<p> between Australia and the United States is all one way in favour of</p>
<p> the United States. The reason I'm not prepared to put the security</p>
<p> relationship on the table is that that would hurt my country, that</p>
<p> would hurt Australia. That's why I don't put it on the table. And</p>
<p> people who argue that you should put the security relationship on</p>
<p> the table in discussions with the Americans are really ignoring the</p>
<p> national benefit to our country of the security relationship.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just finally, what about Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace?</p>
<p> I know you discussed their predicament with the President. Is he going</p>
<p> to do anything for them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I discussed their predicament with both the President and also</p>
<p> with the Secretary of State. Now Madeline Albright, who I saw last</p>
<p> night, I went into some detailed discussion with her. Both of them</p>
<p> have undertaken to do what they can in discussions not only with the</p>
<p> Yugoslavs but also with others to try and secure their release. Now</p>
<p> I don't think either of them can wave a magic wand. In the end they</p>
<p> will be released if President Milosovic of Yugoslavia can be persuaded</p>
<p> to release them. I operate on the view that the more people you have</p>
<p> working to achieve that the better but I don't think there's any magic</p>
<p> wand that Clinton or Albright can wave around, and I don't think anybody</p>
<p> should imagine that that is the case. I don't know precisely what</p>
<p> combination of circumstances is going to trigger a change of heart</p>
<p> on the part of the Yugoslav President. We remain hopeful. Our best</p>
<p> on the ground diplomatic advice is that they will be released but</p>
<p> it's an awkward situation. They are being held unfairly and wrongly</p>
<p> but we've said all of that. We'll continue to raise it, we'll continue</p>
<p> to mention it and talk about it to anybody who we think can have some</p>
<p> influence.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay. Prime Minister, I know you're r</p>
<p>Okay. Prime Minister, I know you're rushing off to another engagement.</p>
<p> Thank you for talking to us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
