OwSRLI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY 26 JUNE 1980<br />
THE* BURDEKIN DAM PROJECT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, announced today that<br />
the Commonwealth Government had decided in principle to assist<br />
the Queensland Government in the construction of the Burdekin<br />
Dam. The project involves the conservation of waters of the Burdekin<br />
River and their use for irrigation of suitable lands adjacent<br />
to the present Burdekin River Irrigation Area for sugar, rice<br />
and horticultural and field crop production. When complete it<br />
will provide for the irrigation of an additional 45,125 hectares<br />
annually and will lead to the creation of about 660 new farms<br />
to be served from the scheme.<br />
This project, which will involve public expenditure estimated at<br />
$ 155 million ( 1977 prices) has important financial implications.<br />
The Prime Minister has therefore suggested to Mr. Bjelke-Petersen<br />
that Commonwealth and State officials should participate in early<br />
consultations in relation to possible methods of financing the<br />
project. These consultations would give particular attention to<br />
the contribution proposed to be made by the Commonwealth and<br />
Queensland Governments to the project's funding. They will also<br />
examine the possibility of funding some parts of the project's<br />
cost through the special infrastructure borrowing arrangements<br />
of the Loan Council; and assess the possible contribution of<br />
the National Water Resources Program to the proposal.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that proposals to rdevelop the-Burdekin<br />
had been advance for many years. Mr. Fraser went on to say that<br />
the Commonwealth Government had already given careful and<br />
detailed consideration to the proposed project. It was assisted<br />
in this task by a joint Commonwealth and Queensland Report on<br />
" the Resources and Potential of the Burdekin River Basin, Queenslaftd".<br />
This report identified the options * for development of the Burdekin<br />
Basin and indicated that the principal physical constraint on<br />
development is the availability of water supplies. It concluded<br />
that further water supplies will be necessary if continued growth<br />
for agriculture and other purposes is not to be retarded.<br />
Mr. Fraser went on to say that the environmental considerations<br />
associated with the proposal had not been overlooked. With the<br />
agreement of -Mr. Bjelke-Petersen, an ecology study of the Burdekin<br />
was at present in progress and a report was expected to be .2 </p>
<p>2<br />
submitted both to the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments<br />
by the end of August. The results of that report will be<br />
studied carefully by both governments to ensure that the impact<br />
of the proposal on the environment is monitored carefully.<br />
Mr. Fraser concluded by indicating that the proposed Burdekin<br />
project was well placed to provide an additional stimulus to<br />
the substantial resource and other development which was centred<br />
on Townsville and the surrounding region.<br />
