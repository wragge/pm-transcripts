18 July 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELL FROM 3AW<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E &amp; OE<br />
MITCHELL: In our Canberra studio the Prime Minister, Mir Howard. Good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hello Neil, good to be on your program.<br />
MITCHELL: Thank you for ringing in on Jeff Kennett.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I thank Jeff and the station for allowing me to appear as a guest interviewee.<br />
KENNETT: That's all right John, I always give way to Prime Ministers.<br />
MITCHELL: Is that true, he always gives way to Prime Ministers, I'm not sure about that? </p>
<p>JUL 18 ' 96 12: 13 P. 3<br />
PRIME MI1? USTER:<br />
How pronouncedly in the cheek is the tongue, I can't see?<br />
MITCHELL: Thank you Mr Kennett. Thank for you time Mr&amp; H oward. Now the serious, obviously, the very<br />
serious issue we want to talk about today is guns. I was just discussing it with Mr Kennett as<br />
well. Do you believe that you will get uniform national gun laws without a referendum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I hope so. It depends on what's finally decided by the Queensland, Western Australian and<br />
Northern Territory Governments. I don't raise the referendum as a threat. I'm not waving a big<br />
stick. A referendum is a complicated, expensive undertaking. It would cost $ 50 million to hold a<br />
referendum, $ 50 million to hold a referendum. It would have to be held quite separately from any<br />
general election and referendas always involve, no matter how strongly supported they are at the<br />
beginning, they always involve some risks, some complications, some divisions, some splits on<br />
one another's side of politics. I would expect to have the support of the Labor Party and the<br />
Democrats and most Coalition supporters throughout the country. Hut I really'don't want a<br />
referendum. it would be a major distraction from the other business of Government and other<br />
responsibilities I have. I hope it is not necessary and I hope by agreeing to the majority view<br />
expressed yesterday the three States, or the two States and one Territory I mentioned, will save<br />
us that expense. But you've got to remember, Neil, that there's an overwhelming passion, almost,<br />
in the community to have strong effective national gun laws.<br />
MITCHELL: This is why it baffes me that the other States, that the States and the Territory are backing away<br />
from it. Will you go to a referendum if you have to?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
We'll consider that next Tuesday if it's necessary. I hope, I really devoutly hope it is not<br />
necessary but I am very conscious of what the Australian people want of me and of their other<br />
leaders. This issue has now become, really, a test of whether governments have a unified resolve<br />
to match the nation's need and the nation's want and that's what it's all about. You can go on<br />
forever arguing some of the technicalities of these things and there always are arguments about<br />
technicalities. People want the May 10 resolutions undiminished in their strengths and their<br />
uniformity and that is why this issue has persisted for a long time. I would wish to have it<br />
wrapped up. It is a very important issue, but naturally it consumes a lot of my time and the time<br />
of many of my ministers, but I'm determined to see it through. I hope seeing it through does not<br />
ulftmately involve a referendum. </p>
<p>JUL 18 ' 96 12: 14 P. 4<br />
MITCHELL: What about the suggestion, what's your view of the suggestion of arsenals being set up so that<br />
some people can still retain the weapons for competition shooting and that sort of thing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we agreed yesterday about a very limited thing that would make it certain that Australians<br />
could continue to be effective players and competitors in Olympic sport, shooting contests and<br />
other recognised national and international contests. It's a quite limnited exemption to people who<br />
are bona fide involved in that and we're having some rules drawn up in relation to it. We're not<br />
talking here about a huge number of people. But the idea of there being arsenals, generally<br />
speaking, doesn't attract me. This is the problem while ever the issue remains unresolved there<br />
will be constant further proposals put forward designed in some way to further qualify it and<br />
there's got to be an end. I mean, people out there are starting to get impatient and they're<br />
starting to say; " look, you know, please fellas will you get this wrapped up". We thought we had<br />
an agreement on the tenth of May. Every day produces a further new proposal which involves<br />
further technical examination, further compromise, if that technical examination is accepted.<br />
Once you make compromnise in one area you open up a new group of people who will say can we<br />
please have a compromise and if they get their compromise a third group of people say can we<br />
have our compromise and in the end the whole thing will begin to unravel. Now, look can I say<br />
again, that many thousands of law abiding, decent Australians will be inconvenienced by these<br />
new laws. I apologise to them. We are stopping them using certain categories of weapons we are<br />
not stopping them being sporting shooters, we are not stopping primary producers having access<br />
in a demonstrated need situation for low powered semi-automatic weapons, we are not, of course,<br />
Prohibiting people from getting licenses for bolt-action rifles and double-barrel shotguns. There<br />
will still be a large number of weapons in the community. Some people might say still too many.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, did you see the letter Walter Mlikac sent yesterday to the Police Ministers?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I did see that.<br />
MITCHELL: He's feeling a sense of betrayal. You can understand that can't you?<br />
PRIM EMINISTER:<br />
Well I do. I, of course, I don't want to play in any way on or exploit the personal grief of that<br />
man, or indeed, the scores of other Australians that have been touched by these tragedies. I am </p>
<p>JUL 18 ' 96 12: 14<br />
nonetheless very conscious of how strongly he feels about it and I am sure that my colleagues at<br />
the meeting are conscious of how strongly he feels about it.<br />
MITCHELL: He read me that letter earlier this morning and authorised me to use some of it on air. The point<br />
he made was that if we don't get a uniform approach here, if, God forbid, there's another Port<br />
Arthur then that at least some of the responsibility for that is borne by the Police Ministers, by the<br />
politicians. Is that a fair thing to say?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well all politicians in positions to do things carry responsibilities. I can't, by passing a law any<br />
more than my State colleagues can, guarantee there'll be no disaster in the future. But what we<br />
can do is reduce the possibility of it. The great thing that Australians will get out of these uniform<br />
national gun laws is a feeling that we have turned back an almost unstoppable deterioration in our<br />
civil society. We Will almost, alone amongst the nations of the western world, instead of<br />
accepting the inevitable of a further slide towards a gun culture we will have said, " no we're not<br />
going to allow that to happen".<br />
MITCHELL: And you remain confident that you'll get that through those others?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, look Neil, I am hopeful that the other three will agree. I have some grounds for that<br />
optimism, but I am not certain. They did not give me any guarantee that they would agree. They<br />
are able to consider this matter according to their own priorities and they'll do that next Monday.<br />
I will be going to the National Party Conference in Queensland on Saturday in Townsville. I will<br />
not just be talking about this issue I will, in fact, be talking about quite a number of other issues.<br />
MITCHELL: Because it's the third anniversary of Port Arthur on Sunday.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, as far as..<br />
AMCHELL: I mean you would have hoped, presumably, it would have been sorted out faster than this<br />
wouldn't you? </p>
<p>JUL 18 ' 96 12: 15 P. 6<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, although it always takes a while. A cooperative federalist arrangement does take time<br />
because there are six States, two Territorial and the Commonwealth Government involved so<br />
there are nine governments. It always does take a bit of time, provided we get the right result by<br />
Monday it will have been a remarkable achievement and I want to thank my State colleagues and I<br />
want to thank Mr Kennett for the very strong support he's given me, very strong, unwavering<br />
support from the very beginning and I appreciate it very much because the strength of support I<br />
have received from Jeff Kennett on this has been very usefiWj and may I also thank the Labor<br />
Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr and also Mr Beazley and Senator Kernot at a<br />
Commonwealth level for the support they've given me.<br />
MITCHELL: If this does need to go to a referendum would it be a single issue referendum, or given that we'd<br />
be spending $ 50-S52 million would you expand it to other issues?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I haven't thought about that. Off the top of my head I'd say that if you start confusing such<br />
a stark, stand alone issue such as this with other issues you start to imperil the outcome. That is<br />
why having a referendum really is a last resort.<br />
MITCHELL: And there's no doubt that it would be won..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have no doubt that it would be, but why should we have to spend so much money, $ 50 million,<br />
on a referendum when plainly all that is needed is an acceptance of a majority decision by the<br />
other participants in the process which produce that majority.<br />
MITCHELL: MW Howard, I know we're almost out of time, if I may another couple of other quick issues, the<br />
ABC is on strike. Is there any room to negotiate this?<br />
PRIME MIN( ISTER:<br />
Well we're not negotiating with the strike with the ABC. We have kept the commnitment to<br />
maintain the current triennia funding which runs out this year. I mean this current financial year<br />
the only cut the ABC will take, let's get this straight, is a 2% cut in it's running costs and every<br />
single agency of the Government has taken that. Next year.. </p>
<p>JUL 18 ' 96 12: 15 P<br />
MITCHELL: Well it was a bit misleading during the election really wasn't it? You could understand why<br />
people thought there would be no change, really, to ABC funding.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the commitment was to maintain the current funding arrangements, which was the current<br />
triennium. But next year there will be a cut of around 10%, Now that type of cut is being applied<br />
across many areas of Government, in some areas even greater. It is not an attempt to destroy the<br />
ABC, it's not an attempt to muscle the ABC. I won't be politically interfering in the ABC. I<br />
mean what in fact has got me in to trouble, if I can put it that way, is that so far from, sort of, try<br />
and go behind the doors and ring up the Managing Director of the ABC to complain about things,<br />
I have been quite open and public in expressing any criticism I have about the style of reporting<br />
on the ABC. I haven't attempted to go behind anybody's back and yet people are suggesting that<br />
I have a secret agenda. I don't have a secret agenda. I disagree with some things that are said on<br />
the ABC in some of it's approaches, just as I might disagree with some things that you or other<br />
commentators say. But I am a very strong supporter of a politically independent ABC. I want an<br />
ABC in this country which is equally critical of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and an ABC<br />
that, on occasions, is equally praiseworthy of the two sides of politics according to the merits of<br />
the issue. I don't want an ABC that in the words of one of it's own former employees, the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald Columnist Max Walsh, actually runs an agenda of its own.<br />
MITCHELL: Does it run an agenda of its own?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh I think people who want an idea of some of the things about which people are concerned<br />
would be well advised to read that article that Mr Walsh wrote.<br />
MITCHELL: What is it, an anti-conservative agenda?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it's more, the concern I have is that the range of views held on issues, particularly social<br />
issues within the ABC or as expressed, are too narrowly based compared with say the range of<br />
views on those same issues that might be heard on 3AW, 2UE or written in the Sydney Daily<br />
Telegra~ ph to quote at random three media outlets that quickly come to mind. </p>
<p>JUL 18 ' 96 12: 16 P. 8E<br />
MITCHELL: Just finally, I know you must go, the United States has decided to seek mandatory limits on<br />
carbon gas omnissions. Does this leave Australia a bit isolated on this one?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm disappointed that the Americans have done that. What is happening here is that the<br />
Americans are looking after their own national interests. It suits the Americans and the<br />
Europeans to take a different line on this issue than Australia. It hurts Australia for the Americans<br />
and the Europeans to take the line that they have taken and I'm disappointed it's occurred. And<br />
what we have done is to recognise that it's not in our interests to go down the path that we were<br />
going down before because that would impose a disproportionate burden of adjustment and cost<br />
on Australian industry and you won't get serious world wide action in this area unless you get<br />
some constraints operating on greenhouse gas omissions in the developing countries.<br />
MITCHELL: So the American decision won't change our position?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I haven't had an opportunity to talk to my colleagues about it, but our position was not<br />
developed because of some heard response to the previous American position our position was<br />
developed because it was in Australia's interests and that is the only basis on which any self<br />
respecing government can deal with these sorts of issues. You don't just follow the mob.<br />
MITCHELL: Well how does the decision hurt us, you said the American decision..<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
No, well the majority view that is emerging in this conference is towards a regime that is in the<br />
interests of the Europeans, the Americans and the developing countries but in a number of key<br />
respects it's not in our interests. Now in those circumstances for us to just roll over and ignore<br />
our own interests would not be discharging our responsibility as a government. I will be tailking<br />
to several of my colleagues today in the wake of what the Americans have said and done and if<br />
there is any further ampiffication of our position it will be announced. But let me say again, we<br />
took the position we did because the previous regime was clearly against Australia's interests and<br />
would have imposed unreasonable costs on Australia and was designed to suit the convenience of<br />
the Europeans and the Americans and not necessarily the convenience of Australia and clearly in<br />
those circumstances it's my responsibility to state and maintain the Australian national interest. </p>
