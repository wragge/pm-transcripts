AUSTRALIA L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, ON TAXATION<br />
POLICY STATEMENT 31 OCTOBER 1984<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, the statement that you have before you<br />
provides, I believe, the starkest possible contrast between the<br />
Opposition and the Government in regard to tax policy. This<br />
statement that you have outlines a coherent reasoned plan and<br />
importantly an achievable program for genuine tax reform. Its a<br />
program, as you can see, for a complete overhaul of the taxation<br />
system to achieve fairness and simplicity and very importantly the<br />
maximum possible elimination of tax avoidance. For too long now<br />
the average Australian taxpayer has been forced to pay the bill<br />
for the cheats and the avoiders who have exploited the existing<br />
system to avoid their responsibilities an existing system, which<br />
as the statement points out in the 34 years before we came to<br />
office in March had been built up under 31 years of those 34<br />
years, of conservative rule. Now we believe strongly and make it<br />
clear in our statement that reform can only be achieved by an<br />
honest and reasoned identification of the problems involved and<br />
then by a resolve to find the appropriate and the acceptable<br />
solutions to those problems. Now quite clearly, that approach has<br />
no chance of success at all. If government pretends that it<br />
knows all the answers before it starts the process and if it lacks<br />
the resolve to take that process through. And I can assure you<br />
that we viill not be pretending, do not pretend, that we know all<br />
the answers, but I can at the same time promise that we will not<br />
lack the necessary resolve to carry through by way of that process<br />
of community consultation the reform that is required. We are<br />
determined that that reform of the type that the statement<br />
outlines will be achieved for Australia and we are totally<br />
confident that our refusal to impose impossible inhibitions in the<br />
name of current political expediency will win the support of the<br />
overwhelming majority of the Australian electorate. Now, I am<br />
certain, and I believe that this is a point of view which is<br />
shared, I am certain that the Australian people understand that<br />
unless and until the Australian tax system is completely<br />
overhauled there is simply no chance of achieving a reduction of<br />
unfair burdens that currently exist and restoring equity to the<br />
J1 system. Now I am certain equally that'the Australian people are<br />
fed up with the tinkering of the system that our opponents have<br />
for so long dressed up as seemingly attractive electorate packages<br />
W4 t~ r' </p>
<p>and have been pleased to call tax reform. Now therein lies the<br />
total contrast between our policy and the opposition. Once again<br />
in this election they have opted for an attempt at sectional votebuying<br />
gimmickry that quite clearly will not stand up to the<br />
simplest of analysis and has no chance of ever being implemented.<br />
Now, I repeat that for too long the taxation debate in this<br />
country has been addressed by a combination of papering over<br />
existing cracks and by pre-election ( gimmickry. And that is<br />
exactly why the tax system is in the mess it is today. And that<br />
is why the Australian people are prepared to support a government<br />
that is prepared to do the job properly. Put very simply, for<br />
years and years now the Opposition in this country have attempted<br />
to buy votes with pre-election carrots and have then punished the<br />
people with post election sticks. And I can say that neither I<br />
nor my Government will have any part of that sort of politics. I<br />
believe the Australian people have had enough of it. They deserve<br />
better in this important area and we intend to give them the<br />
better approach that they deserve.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the seventh principle put simply is<br />
it saying there that if trade unions are not prepared to wear<br />
indirect taxes then they won't be introduced.<br />
PM: I am saying that what is important in regard to any move t~ o<br />
indirect taxes is that it not be a move which will defeat the<br />
purpose of tax reform by fuelling inflation and it will be<br />
necessary if there is any part of a total package which will be<br />
arrived at with the full consultation of the trade union movement<br />
it will be necessary to get an agreement with and from the tradE!<br />
unions to ensure that that does not add to the inflationary<br />
processes. Now we are certain that that can be achieved.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you can maintain you pledge not to<br />
increase the overall tax burden for the term of your next<br />
government by increasing the deficit. But do you give a pledge<br />
now that the deficit and GDP will not rise over the term of<br />
the next parliament?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does the statement mean that there<br />
will be no tax changes introduced before the budget year after<br />
next the 86 budget?<br />
PM: It certainly wouldn't be introduced i~ n the next budget<br />
because you can see the timetable that we are talking about,<br />
Laurie, is the preparation through the continuation of these<br />
consultative processes the preparation of a draft white paper<br />
and with the summit type conference in the third quarter and<br />
hopefully the emergence of an acceptable package by the end of 135.<br />
So that would rule out changes in the 85 Budget. It may be that<br />
as part of that consultation that there would be agreement that it<br />
would be to the benefit of the Community therefore not however to<br />
wait until the next budget, say in August 86, but there could well<br />
be agreement to introduce the package before the Budget of 86 and<br />
I would think indeed that would be the position. = Z </p>
<p>-JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when you give a commitment that there will<br />
be no overall increase in the tax burden.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: that that commitment will include any taxes which<br />
may be transferred to the States or does the commitment only apply<br />
to those taxes which remain under the of the Commonwealth.<br />
PM: I make it quite clear that in the statement that I have made<br />
before and that I repeat again here that that commitment quite<br />
clearly assumes no increased tax powers on the part of the States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, won't smashing tax avoidance requiLre<br />
you to have control of the Senate at the forthcoming election?<br />
PM: I would put it this way, Ken, that clearly if we had had<br />
control of the Senate during the life of this Government, the<br />
Australian people would have been half a b-llion dollars better<br />
off in regard to our legislation. Now, that position again after<br />
the election would be easier to achieve if we had control of the<br />
Senate but I want to make this point. Because tax reform is<br />
clearly an issue, and as I have said from earlier in the campaign,<br />
I want to talk about tax right through the campaign, and will,<br />
that I believe that this Government will be clearly given a<br />
mandate to proceed with the process of tax reform based upon the<br />
smashing of the tax avoidance industry. And in those<br />
circumstances I would expect particularly as we continue the<br />
processes of community consultation and get, as I believe we will,<br />
broad community agreement during 1985 I would think that the<br />
Senate would be thinking twice before seeking to frustrate the<br />
clearly expressed will of the people of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, would a capital gains tax contribute<br />
to the smashing of tax avoidance and tax evasion?<br />
PM: It's a question which is not founded, if I may say so, in a<br />
reading of the document.<br />
JOURNALIST: I didn't suggest it was.<br />
PM: No, what I am tryin to say, I would hope that the document<br />
had in fact made that position clear that there is an existing<br />
capital gains tax. People tend to talk about new capital gains<br />
tax. Some of the argument about the existing capital gains tax is<br />
that it is arbitrary and unpredictable. All we are saying is that<br />
we believe that a major concern of the Australian people is the<br />
smashing of the tax avoidance industry and in the community<br />
consultation that is going to take place, I imagine that one of<br />
the things that just about every group in the community is going<br />
to want to address itself to, as has the Business Council of<br />
Australia, the Confederation of AustrAlian Industry, for instance,<br />
is to examine whether to achieve the smashing of the tax avoidance<br />
industry, any changes in the existing capital gains tax system is<br />
necessary to achieve that end. But you see, I can't determine<br />
now, and it is quite inappropriate in an electoral context to put<br />
1 ' A In: Ily-</p>
<p>PM Cont.: for perceived electoral advantage purposes a position<br />
which says you do this or you do that not knowing in the context<br />
of a full debate whether the great objective of the Australian<br />
that is to smash the tax avoidance industry is more likely to be<br />
achieved by some changes in the existing capital tax regime. it<br />
is certainly the view of the business communities represented<br />
through the Business Council and the Confederation of Australian<br />
Industry that some changes there seem to be desirable to achieve<br />
that end.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when did yoi and your Ministers first<br />
consider the proposal for a tax summit?<br />
PM: I think the answer to that becomes fairly clear from reading<br />
what is in the document it was about page-4 I think of the<br />
document where you will see that we set out the public minutes<br />
of the EPAC meeting of March this-year where while the phrase<br />
summit is not specifically mentioned, it is quite clear there that<br />
the Government has been talking about this issue itself and<br />
through EPAC right through 1984. Indeed the process commenced i~ n<br />
83. Now we use the phraseology there about consultation with the<br />
community, that it is a long term matter, and requires<br />
consideration of the views of the community as a whole. The<br />
phrase summit is not used there, but the concept of summit has<br />
been involved right throughout our thinking, because it goes back,<br />
Michelle, to the point that I make in the statement and that I<br />
made in my introductory comments to this press conference. What: I<br />
think is basically important to understand in the tax debate is<br />
that you are not going to achieve workable and effective and fair<br />
overhaul of the system unless the community as a whole feels that<br />
it has been involved in the process of analysis and discussion and<br />
believes that the outcome meets its objectives. And so the<br />
concept of summit, whether you call it summit or a national<br />
conference on taxation, I'm not hung-up precisely on the word<br />
what I and the Government are totally committed to is a<br />
continuation of the processes which as the document makes clear,<br />
commenced almost as soon as we came to government. We have<br />
undertaken the process of considering tax reform by getting the<br />
views of everyone and have committed ourselves to continuing that<br />
in the post-election period.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, could you say when the decision was made<br />
not to increase taxes or the deficit as a proportion of GDP and<br />
could you say how the decision was made whether by Cabinet or<br />
PM: Made by Cabinet on 3 September.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you not see a danger in having a tax<br />
summit that for the purpose of which you talk could be clouded by<br />
a lot of interested pleading. You are bound to have some parties<br />
upset by maybe a majority view. Also,' what form do you see the<br />
summit taking? Will it be similar to the April summit last year?<br />
And where does this leave the EPAC review of the tax system? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, well, the three questions are related. You will see<br />
from the minutes of the March meeting of EPAC that there is a<br />
commitment there to continue within and outside EPAC the<br />
processes of consultation. When we have our next meeting of EPAC<br />
we will seek to get the views of EPAC members as to how they sEe<br />
the process best developing. So I simply cannot give you an<br />
answer now as to the format because we will be guided by EPAC irn<br />
that. I would, however, make this point to you, that when you<br />
look at the composition of EPAC, and let me remind you of its<br />
composition. It has got the large business organisations<br />
represented through the Business Council of' Australia and the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry. It has got the Council of:<br />
Small Business Organisations and the National Farmers Federation.<br />
So you have got the whole spectrum, if you like, of business,<br />
secondary and rural there large and smal.. You have got all<br />
levels of government ourselves and the State Governments and<br />
local government and you have got the community organisations<br />
represented through ACOSS and the Consumer Organisations. Now, I<br />
would think, and I say this without seeking; in any way to pre-empt<br />
what they would say, but I would think that: they would see some<br />
expansion of those organisations. You know, for instance, one<br />
obvious group would be the Taxpayers Association. So you would<br />
see some widening of the groups there represented and as to<br />
numbers I don't know whether it would be necessary to have the<br />
numbers of the April summit, but I am open-minded on that. The<br />
only thing which is important, and it is critically important, is<br />
that it should be so structured that we as a government and the<br />
community itself can be convinced that there is the opportunity<br />
for a very representative putting of views. Could I just briefly<br />
go to the first part of your question. You prefaced it by saying,<br />
won't there be special pleading and so on. Well, of course. I<br />
mean that is the democratic process. That is what has happened in<br />
the past in a sense. I think the problem has been with the<br />
conservative governments in that 31 years of the 34 until the<br />
beginning of 83d, that special pleading went on behind closed<br />
doors. There wasn't any intermingling of the views of the<br />
community. It wasn't done in an open, constructive way. Now, if<br />
you have this more open process, then I think the great benefits<br />
are not only the obvious one I have referred to that you get a<br />
more representative view, but I think there is imposed an<br />
astringency, if you like, upon the special pleaders because if<br />
they have to put their case before others, then I think that is an<br />
astringent effect which is all to the good. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if you consider that tax<br />
avoidance is going to be such an important issue in the<br />
coming election why didn't you use the rejected bottom of<br />
the harbour bill as a trigger for adouble dissolution and<br />
then possible use it, then possibly push it through<br />
Parliament at a joint sitting of Parliament next year?<br />
PM: Cause I wasn't about triggering a double dissolution<br />
of the Parliament. There was other legislation there that<br />
would have enabled that. You see, that is the sort of<br />
dramatic, confrontationist sort of approach which characterises<br />
the conservative side of politics but which is distinctly<br />
different from the way we approach things. We have tried<br />
to argue our case sanely and constructively in the Senate,<br />
now for a combination of reasons there it wasn't acceptable.<br />
But I think the process that we are putting to the Australian<br />
people now will produce the result that the people want. That<br />
is, that these things will be oat. openly, there will be a<br />
clear understanding by the Australian People of what tax<br />
avoidance has cost them and I think it is fairly well understood<br />
now but as this process goes on, it will. be very clear to<br />
the Australian people what tax avoidance has meant to them<br />
as I say in the statement it has imposed a massive, undisclosed<br />
supertax upon the people of Australia. That has been the effect<br />
of the tax avoidance industry and I think it is going to be<br />
sorted out in the way that I am talk about now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister on Justice Murphy if I may<br />
PM: Have you got a time constraint, I mean I would rather<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you talk in terms of smashing<br />
the tax avoidance industry. Can you elaborate on what you<br />
mean by that and what sort of things you are thinking of<br />
given the fact that the new taxation commissioner has<br />
consistently said that tax avoidance and tax evasion are<br />
dead? PM: Well, you say it has been said consistently that they<br />
are dead. It is quite clearly not dead when legislation<br />
which is necessary to produce results in certain areas<br />
hasn.' t been put into place. The important consideration<br />
as far as, not just the Government is concerned, but as<br />
the community is concerned, is to have an absolute assurance<br />
of two things really that all the armoury, if you like, is gjoing<br />
to be there to prevent any possibility of the tax avoidance<br />
industry existing further or reappearing in other ways. I<br />
mean what you have got to remember is that the history of th.-e<br />
taxation system and particularly as Mr Commissioner Costigan<br />
said in the period 76-81, the tax avoidance industry showed<br />
an amazing versatility ' and imaginativeness in the ways in<br />
which it would seek to enable a privileged minority who had<br />
access-as we say to the slick accountants and the smart lawyers<br />
to dream up methods. Now what is important now is to get the<br />
will of the Australian people clearly expressed and with the<br />
Government therefore with a mandate to say all the armoury<br />
will be there to prevent an remnants or it emerging in any<br />
other way. Peter perhaps we could go to yours now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you like to see the Senate reconvened<br />
as soon as possible to clear this up?<br />
% L I? rI </p>
<p>PM: No, and I have only had the opportunity of seeing a<br />
couple, of perusing very briefly press releases I think<br />
from Senator Chaney and Mr Sinclair, and as I see it, there<br />
is no suggestion from the Opposition as from those press<br />
releases that that should be the case. I think Mr Sinclair,<br />
as I understand, has specifically reported as saying it would<br />
not be appropriate to interrupt the electoral process, the<br />
eleciton process to recall the Senate. I believe that it<br />
isn't appropriate and that this will be a matter for the<br />
Senate on the resumption of the Parliament. It is a report<br />
of a committee of the Senate. It is for the Senate to<br />
consider it, and the Parliament to consider at the normal time.<br />
I I n5rue Pfr--: I-</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What sort of impact do you think it is going<br />
to have on the election process?<br />
PM: I think none. Quite clearly it is not a matter which<br />
affects this government. I have simply said in regard to<br />
all these areas where there is a suggesition of either crime<br />
and I make it quite clear I am not suggesting this in regard<br />
to the judge, but I have made it quite clear in the whole area<br />
where there is suggestion of crime or miLsbehaviour or anything<br />
that the proper processes should be followed. I have indicated<br />
what I believe the proper processes are in this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you believe that Justice Murphy<br />
should stand aside in the interim?<br />
PM: I don't think it's a matter for me to express an<br />
opinion on that. I think that this a matter, I assume<br />
that will be resolved within the High Court, presumably<br />
between Mr Justice Murphy and the Chief Justice Sir Harry<br />
Gibbs. And I think it would be improper for me to be saying<br />
something in that area because it would imply on my part that<br />
I didn't have confidence in the High Court itself to conduct<br />
its own affairs.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, you said that this is a matter for the<br />
Senate when Parliament resumes. Do you think the Director<br />
of Public Prosecutions also has a role?<br />
PM: Well, he has access, Laurie, to all the material. The<br />
previous material and now all the material if I may put it,<br />
of the second Senate enquiry. Because everything has been<br />
conducted in public. He has access to it. I understand<br />
he is looking at it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Senator Evans said that he was looking<br />
over the material and going to put a view to the Government<br />
over * the next few days. What is the process of that, will<br />
that be a view to you or will it be a meeting of senior<br />
ministers? PM: Michelle, He would report to me. And I would believe<br />
that his report to me, what he'd analysed what was there, I<br />
think in terms of appropriate courses of action, I would<br />
assume it would be along the lines of what I have suggested<br />
now. As I understand to be the appropriate course, it would<br />
only be if there was some, for some legal reason, he was putting<br />
to me that there was some other course of action that was<br />
required, I would then call a meeting of the leaders to<br />
consider that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it's just an appraisal, it's not a recommendation<br />
for action.<br />
PM: Only an appraisal. I must say this, because I don't<br />
pretend to have read the whole report, I haven't. Nor do<br />
I say do I have at my fingertips a full understanding of<br />
every possible legal implication. I am simply saying that<br />
if the Attorney-General were to put something to me which<br />
was other than what I would understand would be the </p>
<p>PM cont: appropriate course that I have alluded to, then in<br />
those circumstances I would discuss it with the leaders. Bu~ t<br />
I don't imagine that will arise.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does the fact that the committee was unable to<br />
reach a unanimous decision undermine the value of the committee's<br />
report in any way?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think it is appropriate for me to enter<br />
this issue by seeking to impose a personal view or intetpretation<br />
and I don't intend to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you that the Government has handlE~ d<br />
the issue from the beginning the correct way rather than setting<br />
up a judicial enquiry?<br />
PM: Yes, I believe the appropriate courses have been followed<br />
and I merely repeat Peter what I have said all the way along<br />
in regard to the whole range of matters; that one has to havE!<br />
a concern for the public interest and t he interest of individuals<br />
who may be involved. I accept, and understand clearly that there<br />
can be sincerely held views about what are the best ways of<br />
matching those two requirements of the public interest and the<br />
interest of the individuals. And I am not here to attack<br />
others who have had different views of how those two criteri~ a<br />
can be satisfied. All I can say is that I believe that at<br />
this stage a postion has been reached Where there are clearly<br />
processes to be followed and processes which I trust will<br />
continue to meet those two criteria. And I believe they wil~ l.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think report could<br />
damage Mr Wran?<br />
PM: Mr Wran. No I believe not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Sir Harry Gibbs or Justice<br />
Murphy? PM: No I haven't spoken to either of them and it would not:<br />
be my intention to as I repeat the question I gave before, our<br />
democracy is very squarely based upon the division of powers<br />
between the executive, the parliament and the judiciary and<br />
I have total confidence in the judiciary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I ask you another question on tax?<br />
This is in relation to your answer to Barrie Cassidy<br />
about your expressingonf idence that the ACTU<br />
their decision to introduce indirect tax..<br />
discounting of such a tax.<br />
In the light of Mr Dolan's recent comments why would you<br />
think that?<br />
PM: Well I think if you read everything that was said by<br />
the ACTU and put all of Mr Dolan's comments in the context<br />
of what the ACTU said there is full basis, a full basis for<br />
me expressing that view. The ACTU obviously will be important,<br />
a very important element in the discussions that we have had.<br />
And I can talk, of course, from the basis of having seen the<br />
ACTU, already been involved in those discussions in EPAC, so<br />
my confidence and the view I express is based upon past<br />
experience, may I say not only on the ltax issue, I mean the<br />
-in </p>
<p>PM cont: enormous success of us all in achieving the results,<br />
the economic results that we have, has been large measure based<br />
upon the successful operation of the Accord and therefore I<br />
believe that the ACTU as we go into ' 85 and through this<br />
important area will give a full commitment in trying to<br />
ensure that the best possible results for the community,<br />
as a whole, are achieved. So I have total confidence on thE!<br />
basis of what they have done in the Accord, the way they<br />
have operated within EPAC and in respect of the prepared<br />
position of the ACTU that has been to the people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, does retro'spective legislation<br />
remain crucial to smashing tax avoidance.<br />
PM: Well, I think that in the discussions that we will be<br />
having that the question of whether retrospective legislation<br />
will be necessary in the context of any other things that have<br />
to be done will be on the table. WHat I make clear, Paul, i~ s<br />
that it is not just words when we say we are in advance<br />
determining what is necessary. We have basic views and<br />
principles which we have enunciated and we want the whole<br />
issue to be discussed in a way which means at the end of thE!<br />
process the community will be saying to the Government, these<br />
are the things that we want done to achieve these objectives<br />
and if that is one of them well so be it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What I am wondering is, will you be pushing<br />
that legislation again after the election and before<br />
the review?<br />
PM: Well I would think that we would be guided by the<br />
initial processes of the discussions to<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you think that by providing<br />
differing reports, Senator Tate and Senator Bolkus have<br />
made it difficult for the Government to come to a unanimous<br />
view next year if this matter comes up to a vote in Parliament?<br />
PM: * I can't answer that at this stage. I mean it is obviously<br />
going to be a question of the, everyonE! involved reading the<br />
reports and studying them and it would be presumptuous for<br />
me to try and pre-empt people's study of those reports by<br />
giving an answer to that. </p>
