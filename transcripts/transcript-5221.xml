FOR MEDIA FRIDAY 28 DECEMBER 1979<br />
THE BASS STRAIT FIELD<br />
The four year development and exploration programme announced<br />
by Esso-BHP is further evidence that the 1980s hold outstanding<br />
development prospects for Australia.<br />
The cormpanies' proposed $ 1.2 billion investment in Bass Strait<br />
will ensure the ma~ ximum recovery of the most available known<br />
and potential oil and gas reserves in the field.<br />
This will assist the maintenance of the highest practicable<br />
level of self sufficiency in oil which is vitally important to<br />
AustraLian security and to the Australian economy.<br />
The commitment of large sums of money in high risk exploration<br />
and development by Esso-BHP is to be commended.<br />
The programme is a further reminder that the Government's energy<br />
policies of conservation, finding new oil, developing alternative<br />
fuels and research are continuing to produce significant results.<br />
