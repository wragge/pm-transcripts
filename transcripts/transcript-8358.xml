C2HECK AGAINST DFLTVERY EMBARGOED UNTTIL nFrlF'<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BRW/ ALCATEL BUSINESS AWARDS<br />
SYDNEY 27 NOVEMBER 1991<br />
Thank you for the opportunity to present the 1991 Business<br />
Review Weekly/ Alcatel Australian Business Awards.<br />
Tonight is very important to many Australian companies and<br />
business people. Winning one of these awards really means<br />
something. Many of you might have predicted that I would have taken t,<br />
opportunity to demonstrate to such a distinguished busines<br />
audience the futility of the proposed Consumption Tax. I<br />
wouldn't delay the announcement of the awards with somethi<br />
like that. But what I will say is that the holes and gaps<br />
which are already evident make it clear that the Consuznpti<br />
Tax package would do nothing for Australia, either<br />
economically or socially.<br />
Instead I want to talk briefly about competition, and ahou<br />
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the GATT.<br />
Competition and the GATT are inextricably linked both<br />
domestically and internationally. Competition and the resu<br />
of the Uruguay Round are essential aspects of what my<br />
Government has been doing for 8 years in reforming the<br />
Australian economy, in changing it into a low inflation,<br />
internationally competitive economy in fostering<br />
competition across all industries through the adoption of<br />
best international practice.<br />
In business, as I'm sure you'll agree, without competition.<br />
there is a weakening in the force for innovation; in the<br />
need to reduce costs; in the fight for growth; in the<br />
encouragement to seek new opportunities.<br />
In Australia, we have experienced that problem first-hand.<br />
In the past, we attempted to hold back the tide of<br />
international competitiveness. For a time we might be sait<br />
to have succeeded. But at what cost? What did that socalled<br />
success achieve?<br />
Ladies and gentlemen thirty years of policy mismanagement<br />
successfully achieved an inward-looking, uncompetitive<br />
industrial structure.<br />
3338 </p>
<p>My Government has been about the task of reversing the<br />
mistakes of earlier years. The task has not been easy and<br />
in no sense is it complete. Indeed it can never be complete<br />
because a competitive world is a dynamic and changing world.<br />
But it is inescapable that as we enter the 1990s no nation<br />
can afford to ignore the force of global competition. The<br />
growth of every economy, from the tiniest South Pacific<br />
Island to the power-houses of Germany, the United States or<br />
Japan depends crucially onr the growth in world trade<br />
represented by internationralisation or its corollary the<br />
ability of firms at home to compete with firms overseas.<br />
Indeed, I believe we will soon reach a stage where there are<br />
few if any industries which do not, in one sense or another<br />
face genuine international competition.<br />
Even in the classic examples of so-called naturallyprotected<br />
industries such as bricks or bread, international<br />
competition can arrive in the form of a foreign takeover.<br />
With innovation or better technology or better marketing<br />
or all the above and more international best practice can<br />
arrive in even the most naturally protected industry.<br />
We have some major Australian companies doing just this at<br />
present in the United States, in Europe and in Asia.<br />
We need to accommodate anti use this trend: it is the wave<br />
of the future. Refuse to recognise it, and it will engulf<br />
US. Ride it successfully and it can provide the momentum to<br />
transform our economy.<br />
There is an important obligation for a Government to meet in<br />
ensuring competition provides the necessary momentum in our<br />
economy. We must ensure that all our domestic markets, not just some,<br />
operate efficiently, so that inputs are available as cheaply<br />
in Australia as they are overseas.<br />
The means of improving domestic markets to ensure inputs are<br />
provided efficiently has taken many forms under my<br />
Government: tariff cuts will reduce the cost of many<br />
industries' inputs, both directly and through<br />
their suppliers who use imported equipment or<br />
products reform of industry structures in<br />
telecommunications, aviation, interstate rail<br />
freight, road transport, statutory marketing<br />
authorities, capital markets, the waterfront and<br />
shipping more and better 1: raining, both at school or TAFE<br />
and in the work-place 3339 </p>
<p>more flexible labour markets with a clear and<br />
-explicit focus of improving worker productivity<br />
mutual recognition of standards by States to<br />
reduce barriers to trade within Australia; and<br />
positive assistance to lift research and<br />
development and encourage innovation<br />
These reforms are, many of them, not simple. They involve<br />
cost and pain and are often by their very nature slow and<br />
hidden in their contribution in the short-term.<br />
Putting together an approach which achieves the basic<br />
objectives of more efficient markets while also providing<br />
assistance with adjustment costs is what good government is<br />
about. Poor government, on the other hand, involves plenty<br />
of hype about zero tariffs and confrontation with unions;<br />
and no consideration at all of the adjustment costs.<br />
An essential accompaniment to these reforms is a means of<br />
ensuring that markets operate to the benefit of consumers,<br />
whether that consumer is a business buying an input or a<br />
child buying an ice-cream.<br />
My Government does not delude itself that all markets will<br />
operate efficiently; and that the public benefit will always<br />
be served by open and unfettered competition.<br />
The Commonwealth's principal method of meeting the objective<br />
of maintaining public benefit is the Trade Practices Act.<br />
While much debate about the Act currently focuses on mergers<br />
and media purchases with claims of inadequacy on the one<br />
hand and over-kill on the other little attention is given<br />
to the fact that the Act actually has substantial holes in<br />
its coverage.<br />
it is or it should be axiomatic that for markets and<br />
firms to interact competitively, the framework which guides<br />
their operation, which says what is fair competition and<br />
what is not, should be applied equally in all markets.<br />
Even where special cases can be claimed, their exclusion<br />
from the Act, or the principles underlying it simply on<br />
the grounds of Commonwealth-State demarcation must surely be<br />
rejected as anachronistic.<br />
So it was that I said on 12 March that my Government will<br />
seek to address with the States these areas which are not<br />
covered by trade practices law.<br />
And the areas involved are hardly inconsequential. State<br />
marketing authorities influence the cost of the food we eat;<br />
and the cost of a major input to our food processing<br />
industries.<br />
3340 </p>
<p>State business enterprises cover electricity, gas, water,<br />
roil and offer a range of other businesses less directly<br />
associated with normal public sector interests.<br />
Unincorporated bodies, such as partnerships in the law,<br />
medicine, accounting and other fields are State<br />
responsibilities under the Constitution.<br />
in all these cases, we are seeing pressures on Governments<br />
for reform; to reduce costs to consumers, to allow markets<br />
to develop. When those markets do develop, it is my belief<br />
that we need to ensure that; the principles inherent in trade<br />
practices legislation are applied, as a means of ensuring<br />
that businesses and consumers benefit fully from such<br />
reforms. It is an area often overshadowed in the thrust for<br />
international competitiveness, but it cannot remain that<br />
way. Notwithstanding the current hiatus in certain processes<br />
involving Commonwealth-Stal: e reform, my Government remains<br />
committed to pursuing changle in this and other areas.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I believe that, with co-operation, we could see these gaps<br />
in the coverage of trade practices law addressed in the<br />
course of 1992. After all, the countries of Europe now have<br />
a unified competition policy. Surely Australia can achieve<br />
that, too.<br />
I have spent some time on -the issue of competition as it<br />
applies domestically. Yet we can do all the work possible<br />
to lift our competitivenesa, get our industries to focus on<br />
international trade, and at the end of the day this can be<br />
only of partial benefit if the export opportunities we seek<br />
are denied to us by tariff and non-tariff barriers.<br />
This is where the massive effort of the past five years on<br />
. the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General<br />
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade comes in.<br />
The GATT Round is our first and best means of ensuring that<br />
Australia can exploit the opportunities that our low<br />
inflation rate, our good education levels, our improving<br />
research and development focus allow us.<br />
As a relatively small trading n ' ation with an export base<br />
heavily dominated by primary products, we are not, well<br />
served by existing GATT rules because they have failed to<br />
deal with trade-distorting domestic production subsidies;<br />
barriers to entry; and export subsidies which characterise<br />
support and protection in agriculture. Those subsidies and<br />
barriers have grown to absurd proportions in recent years,<br />
often in the guise of food security or social security<br />
policies. 3341 </p>
<p>if successful, the Uruguay Round holds out the prospect of<br />
ensuring that everyone has the right to fair treatment, for<br />
goods and also for the first time in the GATT for<br />
services. While the success or failure of the round is<br />
still uncertain, principally because of the gap that exists<br />
between participants on agriculture reform, the scope of the<br />
round is comprehensive and its potential for improving the<br />
international trading framework is great.<br />
After five years of painstaking work, a successful<br />
conclusion to the Uruguay Round appears to be within our<br />
grasp. Predictably, the last phase of the negotiations is<br />
proving difficult as governments are forced to face the<br />
tough options which will need decision in the next few<br />
weeks. On g November, Presidents Bush and Delors met in the Hague<br />
with Prime Minister Lubbers, and although many issues of<br />
detail remain unresolved, they have added momentum to the<br />
Geneva negotiations across a broad range of Uruguay Round<br />
problems. In Hlarare in October, I discussed the urgent need for action<br />
in the Round with the British Prime Minister John Major, who<br />
is currently G-7 summit chairman. We are in regular contact<br />
and he is taking a direct and constructive role both in the<br />
EC and with his colleagues in other G-7 countries, in<br />
following up the commitment they made in London.<br />
If the political will is there to take the tough decisionS,<br />
we should see the final shape of the overall round emerge by<br />
Christmas. On many issues we already know what this package will<br />
contain, and we have a clear view of the bottom line for<br />
most of the others. Let me set out for you some of these<br />
elements, with particular reference to those of priority<br />
interest to Australia.<br />
A good agreement on agriculture will comprise:<br />
tariff ication of the many forms of agricultural protection,<br />
with tariffs falling over time and current access expanding;<br />
real cuts in export subsidies; and reductions in internal<br />
support payments to producers, in particular those which<br />
distort prices.<br />
While press speculation on agriculture has understandably<br />
focused on the size of the cuts in prospect, those close to<br />
the negotiations know that the detail of the reform<br />
commitments on market access, internal support and export<br />
subsidies are just as critical to securing real, and not<br />
just cosmetic, reform.<br />
If we succeed in securing such a result Australia, with its<br />
colleagues in the Cairns Group, will have played a crucial<br />
role and will have demonstrated that not only the giants In<br />
the trading system can influence the rules of the game.<br />
3342 </p>
<p>While agriculture has been a pivotal issue in the round and<br />
is critical for our traditional export base, Australian<br />
industry generally has a more direct interest in other<br />
issues dealt with in the Round. Although the GATT creates<br />
rules for trade in goods, there are no such rules for the<br />
fastest growing sector of world trade: trade in services<br />
as Australian exporters of services are very much aware.<br />
To conclude the round successfully, however, will test the<br />
ability of the western democracies to put a wider vision on<br />
the future of the international trading environment ahead of<br />
narrow national interest pressures. We are doing all we can<br />
to ensure that that wider vision is sustained over the<br />
coming weeks.<br />
The Uruguay Round is set to produce a general agreement on<br />
trade in services, to apply the principles of the GATT to<br />
this sector. Negotiations to liberalise market access in<br />
services trade have commenced. Australia along with some<br />
forty other countries is taking an active part. Australia<br />
has just tabled a very substantial offer to allow quite open<br />
trade in a wide range of services, including financial<br />
services, professional services, and telecommunications.<br />
We have also made requests to our trading partners for<br />
liberalisation in areas of export interest to Australian<br />
services firms; and thus the process by which the GATT has<br />
reduced the barriers to trade in industrial products has<br />
begun for the services sector.<br />
The program to lower barriers to trade in goods has of<br />
course also been part of the Uruguay Round, like all such<br />
rounds before it. These very detailed negotiations are not<br />
complete, but tariff cuts by our trading partners can be<br />
expected to average overall around 33 percent. For some<br />
products of key interest to Australia the cuts could be far<br />
greater. Think on that for a moment: a cut of one-third in the<br />
tariffs affecting our manufactured exports, already<br />
. experiencing unparalleled growth. It is possible that<br />
tariffs and quotas could disappear for over 80 percent of<br />
world steel trade. There could be no barriers at all in<br />
major markets for our exports of non-ferrous metals in a<br />
sector where Australian exports exceed $ 8.5 billion.<br />
Possible commitments on cuts to coal subsidies particularly<br />
in the EC and Japan could benefit Australia eventually by<br />
more than Si billion a year.<br />
Much of these reforms in prospect can be attributed to the<br />
collective pressures brought to bear through multilateral<br />
co-operation and shared interests with other participants in<br />
the round. 3343 </p>
<p>There is a number of other areas in which Australia will<br />
benefit, including higher standards for the protection of<br />
intellectual property, an area of significant Australian<br />
comparative advantage through our innovative software<br />
manufacturers; and of key long-term interest as my<br />
Government underwrites a greater effort by Australian<br />
companies in Research and Development.<br />
If the Uruguay Round is concluded soon in the terms I have<br />
described, the world will be a better place for a more<br />
competitive and outward looking Australian industry.<br />
Finally, I congratulate the winners of the awards, and BRW<br />
and Alcatel for sponsoring them.<br />
They are well earned by some great Australian companies arid<br />
business people, and it will give me great pleasure to<br />
announce them shortly.<br />
