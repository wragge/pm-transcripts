TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE AT TRAVELODGE HOTEL, PORT MORESBY 7<br />
AUGUST 19847 7.30 P. M.<br />
JOURNALIST: -PRIME MINISTER WHAT DID EP'ERGE OUT OF YOUR TALKS WITH MR<br />
LANGE TODAY. THAT HE'S GOT A BIGGER APPETITE-THAN I HAVE. NO, WELL AS YOU<br />
WILL APPRECIATE THEY WERE CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS AND I DON'T THINK<br />
OU'D REALLY EXPECT ME TO GO INTO THE DETAILS. BUT LET ME REALLY<br />
GIVE YOU THE OUTLINE. THE FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT I WAS<br />
PUTTING TO DAVID OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE AND BASIS OF THE<br />
ANZUS ALLIANCE AS IT HAS DEVELOPED UNDER SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND WHAT OUR POSITION WAS IN THE LIGHT OF HAVING ACHIEVED<br />
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW A TOTALLY SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIP. HE PUT<br />
TO ME THE POSITION AS HE SAW IT WITHIN NEW ZEALAND. AND I AS I'VE<br />
MADE CLEAR, AND AS BILL HAYDEN HAS MADE CLEAR AS WELL, WE WERE NOT,<br />
ACTING'AS EMISSARIES FOR THE UNITED STATES9 THAT'S FOR THE UNITED<br />
STATES TO PUT ITS POSITION TO THE NEW ZEALANDERS. THEY-HAVE DONE<br />
THAT. I WAS CONCERNED WITH PUTTING OUR POSITION AND HEARING MR<br />
LANGE'S POSITION. NOW IT'S A MATTER FOR MR LANGE AND THE GOVERNMJENT<br />
TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY GO ON IT. I HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF<br />
HIS THINKING AND OF THE SITUATION WITH WHICH HE'S CONFRONTED THERE.<br />
IT'S A MATTER FOR MR LANGE IN HIS CAPACITY BOTH AS PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND FOREIGN MINISTER TO WORK THIS THING THROUGH. AND THERE'S NO<br />
ADVANTAGE OR VALUE FOR ANYONEs CERTAINLY FOR AUSTRALIAi IN<br />
SPECULATING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW. IT'S REALLY IN NEW ZEALAND'S<br />
COURT. IT WOULD BE QUITE ZMPROPER FOR US TO BE SEEKING TO IMPOSE<br />
POSITIONS. WE WOULD NOT APPRECIATE IT IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED1 17<br />
(.;' HERE WAS SOME ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A VIEW UPON US.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR LANGE'S TOLD THE NEW ZEAL. AND PRESS AFTER THE<br />
BREAKFAST THIS MORNING THAT THE MAJOR EXERCISE S3CHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY<br />
INVOLVING AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND AMERICAN NAVAL VESSELS SEEMS<br />
THREATENED. IF THAT EXERCISE DOESN'T GO AHEAD WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT<br />
ANZUS IS SHAKY.<br />
WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S USEFUL SPE: CULATING. ABOUT THAT<br />
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION AND YOU KNOW THAT NORMALLY I DON'T LIKE<br />
DEALING WITH HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS. BUT EVEN MORE SO IN THIS CASE<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE WHAT BY ANY CRITERIA YOU LIKE TO CHOOSE A<br />
DELICATE SITUATION IN WHICH A TREATY RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAS EXISTED<br />
FOR THIRTY YEARS IS IN OUESTION TO SOME EXTENT CERTAIN IMPORTANT<br />
ASPECTS OF IT ARE IN QUESTION WITHIN ONE COUNTRY, IN NEW ZEALAND.<br />
NOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY TO THE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF US THAT NOTHING BE DONE<br />
NOW WHICH MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PROCESSES WITHIN NEW<br />
ZEALAND TO BE WORKED OUT WITHIN NEW ZEALAND. ANY ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE<br />
PRESSURES FROM OUTSIDE I BELIEVE WOULD BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE AND SO<br />
FOR ME TO SAY WHAT WOULD BE THE SITUATION IF AS YOU COME UP TO<br />
FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR THERE WAS AN INCAPACITY TO HOLD THE EXERCISES<br />
AS PLANNED, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HELPFUL. WE WILL, AS FAR AS<br />
AUSTRALIA IS CONCERNED, WE CAME TO GOVERNMENT AND MADE IT CLEAR THA"<br />
WE WANTED TO LOOK AT ANZUS. THE AMERICANS WERE FULLY CO-OPERATIVE<br />
WITH US IN FACIL-I'TATING THAT REVIEW IN WH/ CH BOTH THE RELEVANT<br />
MINISTERS SCHOLES AND HAYDEN WERE INVOLVED., AND OUR DEFENCE FORCE<br />
ELEMENTS WERE INVOLVED. NOW WE ARE SATISFIED COMPLETELY WITH THAT<br />
REVIEW AND OF THE RELEVANCE OF THE TREATY TO OUR FORE-SEEABLE<br />
REQUIREMENTS. NOW WE'VE DONE OUR JOB THEREFORE. NOW THERE'S A NEW<br />
SOVERNMENT IN NEW ZEALAND, THEY'VE GOT TO DO THEIR OWN EXERCISE. I<br />
CAN DO NO MORE RESPONSIBLY THAN PUT CLEARLY TO MR LANGE, AS I HAVE<br />
DONE, OUR VIEW OF THE SITUATION. WE'VE DONE THAT. NOW IT'S BACK IN<br />
THEIR COURT. AND TO SPECULATE, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF AVOIDING YOUR<br />
UESTION, BUT TO SPECULATE ON HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS WOULD NOT ONLY<br />
I BELIEVE BE UNHELPFUL TO MR LANGE IN HIS DELIBERATIONS IN NEW<br />
ZEALAND, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE IN AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS OR IN THE UNITED<br />
STATES' INTERESTS.<br />
JOURNALIST: WELL THE NEW ZEALANDERS SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN A POSITION<br />
BEFORE THEY HAVE CONDUCTED A REVIEW.<br />
WELL THEY HAVE CERTAINLY PUT PUBLICLY A VIEW AS THEY SEE IT<br />
ABOUT CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT IS, OF THE NON-VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND<br />
3ORTS OF NUCLEAR POWERED OR NUCLEAR ARMED VESSELS. NOW THEY'VE PUT<br />
tHE VIEW PUBLICLY. NOW IT'S FOR THEM TO CONDUCT THEIR DISCUSSIONS<br />
WITH THE UNITED STATES AND I GUESS THEY'LL DO THAT. THEY HAVE TO<br />
THINK OF ALL THE ASPECTS OF THIS MATTER. IT'S FOR THEM.<br />
, JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION<br />
TODAY DOES IT GIVE YOU ANY CONCERN AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF ANZUS OR OUR ROLE IN THAT ALLIANCE.<br />
WELL I BELIEVE, AND WE'VE MADE THIS CLEAR BEFORE9 I BELIEVE<br />
THAT IF THE NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT WERE NOT ABLE TO REACH A MUTUALLY<br />
ACCEPTABLE ACCOMMODATION WITH THE UNITED STATES ON THE ISSUES WHICH<br />
ARE IN QUESTION NOW AT THE FOREFRONT THEN IT REQUIRES<br />
REAPPRAISALS. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IT'S NOT USEFUL TO US9 TO<br />
NEW ZEALAND OR THE UNITED STATES TO SPECULATE ABOUT THOSE<br />
REAPPRAISALS NOW. CLEARLY A REAPPRAISAL WOULD BE INVOLVED.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE WOULD YOU PREFER TO RESHAPE ANZUS THAT WOULD<br />
PERHAPS BE LESS OF A COMMITMENT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS, OR WOULD YOU<br />
PREFER AN ANZUS AS IT EXISTS TODAY, BUT PERHAPS A PACT BETWEEN JUST<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES.<br />
NO. WE HAVE MADE THE JUDGEMENT ABOUT THE SORT OF ANZUS WHICH<br />
S APPROPRIATE FOR AUSTRALIA. WE'VE MADE THAT JUDGEMENT AND NOTHING<br />
HAS CHANGED TO MAKE ME OR THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVE THAT THAT APPRAISAL.<br />
THAT WE'VE MADE ABOUT WHAT'S IN AUSTRALIA'S BEST INTERESTS SHOULD BE<br />
CHANGED.<br />
JOURNALIST: DOES REPPRAISAL MEAN THAT AUSTRALIA HAS EXPLORED THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF SOME BILATERAL ARRANGEMENT EXCLUDING NEW ZEALAND?<br />
/ 3<br />
1 </p>
<p>P. M1.: NO. IT WOULD BE A TOTAL CONTRADICTION OF WHAT I'VE JUST SAID.<br />
WHY SHOULD WE BE GOING DOWN THAT PATH WHILE NEW ZEALAND ITSELF HAS<br />
GOT TO CONSIDER ITS POSITION. IT WILL BE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE<br />
UNITED STATES AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE<br />
UNITED STATES. WE'VE GONE THROUGH THAT AND WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE<br />
? RESENT POSITION. NOW ANOTHER PARTY NEW ZEALAND HAS GOT TO<br />
CONDUCT ITS DISCUSSIONS AND IT WOULD BE QUITE FUTILE AND COUNTER-<br />
1RODUCTIVE FOR ME ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN-GOVERNMENT TO BE GOING<br />
DOWN SOME SPECULATIVE HYPOTHETICAL PATH WHICH IS NOT RELEVANT AT THE<br />
MOMENT. JOURNALIST: IS THAT THE END OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH MR LANGE ON<br />
THAT QUESTION OR DO YOU INTEND TO HAVE FURTHER DIALOGUE WITH HIM?<br />
WE'LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN BEFORE WE LEAVE. I'M LEAVING ON<br />
THURSDAY MORNING. I THINK HE'S NOT LEAVI'NG UNTIL FRIDAY. IT MAY BE<br />
THAT SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION WILL OCCUR BETWEEN US9 BUT WE'VE GOT NO<br />
F: ORMAL MEETING SCHEDULED.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID MR LANGE PERHAPS ASK YOU WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN HIS<br />
P LACE? WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD START TO WHAT I THINK<br />
'~ WILL BE A LONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO LABOR GOVERNMENTS ACROSS<br />
THE TASMAN IF I WERE To GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE CONVERSATIONS.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE DID MR LANGE SAY TO YOU THAT EVEN IF HE WANTED<br />
ro CHANGE THAT POLICY NOW HE WOULD HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY BECAUSE OF<br />
* rHE STRONG ANTI-NUCLEAR SENTIMENTS WITHIN HIS PARTY.<br />
I GIVE THE SAME ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION THAT I GAVE BEFORE.<br />
I'M NOT GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF THE CONVERSATION.<br />
JOURNALIST: IT WOULD SEEM SENSIBLE MR HAWKE GIVEN THE PROBLEMS OF<br />
ANZUS AT THE MOMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENTv YOUR GOVERNMENT, EMBARKED<br />
UPON CONTINGENCY PLANS PRIOR-TO ANY AGREEMENT ON EITHER ELEMENT<br />
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATED AND NEW ZEALAND. IS THAT GOVERNMENT<br />
WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM?<br />
WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO ANY CONTINGENCY PLANNING. THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN WORKED<br />
SOUT. I WOULD CONCUR WITH THE OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY<br />
\.. OFFICIALS OF THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATIONi INCLUDING MR SCHULTZ, 9<br />
ABOUT THE HIGH STANDING AND QUALITY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. IT IS IN<br />
EXCELLENT SHAPE AND WE ARE NOT IN ANY NEED To REVIEW IT.<br />
JOURNALIST: COULD ANZUS WORK IF AUSTRALIA DENIED ACCESS TO ITS<br />
PORTS AND FACILITIES BY U. S. NUCLEAR ARMED OR POWERED WARSHIPS OR<br />
AIRCRAFT. WELL THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION WHICH IS ABSURD BECAUSE<br />
WE ' VE MADE OUR DECISION ABOUT-THAT. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S<br />
LIKE ASKING ME A QUESTION LIKE WOULD THE DEFENCE POSITION OF THE<br />
UNITED STATES BE THE SAME IF IT WAS GOING TO ABANDON THE NUCLEAR<br />
DETERRENT. JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER YOU SAID EARLIER THAT YOU NOW HAVE A<br />
CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF MR LANGE'S POSITION OF A SITUATION WITH<br />
14HICH HE WAS CONFRONTED. WHAT DO YOU KNOW NOW THAT YOU DIDN'T<br />
KNOW BEFORE. S </p>
<p>WELL HE'S GIVEN ME AN EXPOSITION OF7 THE RANGE OF<br />
CONSIDERATIONS WHICH ARE INVOLVED. I HADN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF<br />
HAVING THAT EXPOSITION BEFORE.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE INDONESIANS<br />
OR MR SOMARE HAS THE REPATRIATION ISSUE ARISEN?<br />
YES I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM BOTH AND I'M SATISFIED THAT<br />
AS BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES INVOLVED PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND INDONESIA<br />
THAT THEY HAVE REACHED BASICALLY A SATISFACTORY FOUNDATION FOR<br />
RESOLVING THE MATTER OF THE BORDER CROSSERS. I'VE MADE THE POSITION<br />
OLITE CLEAR FROM AN EARLY POINT AS HAS BILL HAYDEN THAT THESE ARE TWO<br />
SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT NATIONS. AND WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF OUR<br />
ATTITUDE IN AUSTRALIA THAT IN SOME IMPLICIT SENSE, PEOPLE DON'T SAY<br />
IT EXPLICITLY, BUr THEY' RE STILL IMPLICIT IN OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THIS<br />
THAT PAPUA NEW GUINEA IS SOMETHING LESS THAN AN 2NDEPENDENT NATION<br />
BECAUSE OF OUR PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S IN THE PAST. PAPUA NEW<br />
GUINEA IS A SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT NATIONr IT IS AN ISSUE WHICH HAS<br />
TO BE RESOLVED WITH ANOTHER SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT NATION. AND ON MY<br />
JUDGEMENT THOSE TWO SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT NATIONS ARE DOING A FIRST<br />
CLASS JOB AT RESOLVING THAT ISSUE IN AN AMICABLE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY.<br />
OURNALIST: THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION OF A FUTURE AUSTRALIAN ROLE?<br />
NO, WHY SHOULD THERE BE. JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A GEOGRAPHICAL<br />
PROXIMITY TO THEM THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OR INCREASE<br />
OUR RIGHT TO INTRUDE IN MATTERS BETWEEN THEM. AND PEOPLE MUST<br />
UNDERSTAND THAT.<br />
JOURNALIST: HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THE ABC ISSUE WITH MR SOMARE.<br />
WE HAD A PASSING REFERENCE TO THE ABC9 YES. AND I WOULD<br />
IMAGINE THAT BEFORE I LEAVE I MIGHT HAVE A BIT MORE DISCUSSION. BUT<br />
WE HAVEN'T GONE TO IT IN DEPTH. BUT THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT<br />
YOJ'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO LEAVE BEFORE WE GO ON THURSDAY9 BARRIE,<br />
AS FAR AS I KNOW ANYWAY.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID YOUR TALKS WITH MR LANGE ON THE ANZUS ISSUE REVEAL<br />
TO YOU OR MAKE YOU AWARE OF ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND OR'<br />
REALISE OR KNOW BEFORE.<br />
THERE WERE SOME NUANCES OF THE POSITION IN NEW ZEALAND.<br />
JOURNALIST: WHAT WERE THEY?<br />
CAN I JUST KEEP GOING? I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE DETAILS OF OUR<br />
CONVERSATION.<br />
JOURNALIST: DO YOU THINK THAT THE-TRIAD EXERCISE SHOULD GO AHEAD<br />
MR HAWKE IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES?<br />
P. M1.-WELL WE'VE GOT TO OPERATE FROM THE BASIS THAT WE ARE IN AN<br />
ANZUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AND NEW ZEALAND AND THAT<br />
THE PLANNING THAT IS DONE UNDER THAT SHOULD PROCEED*. NOW WE WILL<br />
OBVIOUSLY GO AHEAD AT THIS STAGE ON THAT BASIS. NOW IF AS A RESULT<br />
OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND THE UNITED STATES IT EMERGES<br />
THAT IT MAY HAVE TO BE REVIEWED, THEN AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT'S THE<br />
TIME TO ADDRESS YOURSELF To THAT ISSUE.<br />
JOURNALIST: IN YOUR TALKS WITH MR RUSTAN, WHO AS HOME AFFAIRS<br />
MINISTER PRESUMABLY IS IN CHARGE OF THE TRANSMIGRATION PROGRAM AND<br />
ALSO THE LOCAL OFFICIALS IN IRIAN JAYA, DID YOU DISCUSS WITH HIM THE </p>
<p>REPATRIATION OF THE REFUGEES AND THEIR STATUS WHEN THEY GO BACK AND<br />
THAT SORT OF THING?<br />
WELL I DID DISCUSS WITH HIM THE STATUS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
2-ETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA. AND AS I SAID IN ANSWER<br />
AN EARLIER QUESTION THAT CONFIRMED THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD FROM THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY THAT A SATISFACTORY BASIS WAS EVOLVING<br />
FOR ' THE RETURN OF THE BORDER CROSSERS. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT<br />
MATTER WILL BE RESOLVED SATISFACTORILY BETWEEN THEM.<br />
JOURNALIST: WAS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON WHY THE INDONESIAN<br />
MINISTER ASKED TO-SEE YOU.<br />
NO, I THINK THAT HE REGARDED IT At A VER~ Y USEFUL OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. HE'D TALKED WITH PRESIDENT. SUHARTO BEFORE HE,!)<br />
LEFT AND HE WANTED TO CONVEY TO ME THE-GOOD WISHES OF THE PRESIDENT)<br />
WHICH HE DIDi AND I RECIPROCATED. AND WE HAD A USEFUL DISCUSSION<br />
ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AND AS I SAY OF THIS ISSUE<br />
BETWEEN INDONESIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID ANYTHING ELSE COME UP?<br />
NO, BASICALLY THE ISSUES THAT WERE COVERED WERE OUR BILATERAL<br />
RELATIONS. SECONDLY, THE uUESTION OF THE BORD ER CROSSERS INTO OAPUAN<br />
NEW GUINEA AND THIRDLY HE DID OUTLINE TO ME IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL<br />
THEIR POLICY IN REGARD TO TRANSMIGRATION WITHIN HIS COUNTRY GENERALLY<br />
AND PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO IRIAN JAYA.<br />
JOURNALIST: DID YOU DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF IN4TELLIGENCE SHARING<br />
WITH MR SOMARE AT ALL.<br />
NO.<br />
JOURNALIST: IS THERE ANY PROBLEM IN AUSTRALIA OBTAINING INTELLIGENCE<br />
FROM PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
OUR RELATIONS IN THIS AND IN ALL OTHER FIELDS ARE tX-CELLENT. </p>
