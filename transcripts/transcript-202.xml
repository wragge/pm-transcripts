EXTRACTS FROM THE SPEECH OF THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES AT THE 71ST ANNUAL<br />
ASSOCI ATION DAY BANQUET OF JHE COiMEiRCIAL<br />
TRAVELLERS' ASSOCIAfION OF NE. J SOUTH IJALES, ON<br />
H AUGUST 1360<br />
I rould just like to say three things to you.<br />
First of all, I have already said, and I believe it<br />
is true, you represent one of the freshest elements in the<br />
nation competition. Competitive enterprise: a state of<br />
affairs in which a man's skill and personality will produce<br />
better results than in the case of a man without skill and<br />
without personality. That, I think, is very -ood. The<br />
competitive element is one of the great secrets of stability in<br />
the country. I hesitate to think what wjould happen in this<br />
marvellous country of ours if we all played the same tune, we<br />
all had the same minds. I do not think Australia would present<br />
to the world, under those circumstances, the same magnificent<br />
and exciting field for interest to the rest of the world as it<br />
does as a result of your labours and those for whom you toil.<br />
The second thing that I wanted to say is that the<br />
work you do, and I hope it will long continue, is a contributor<br />
to the stability in the nation. So do not forget this stL~-v1<br />
in this country. Not a dull stability, not a sort of half-dea<br />
state of affairs, but a lively, bustling stability, if you can<br />
imagine such a thing, is of tremendous importance to us in<br />
regard to the rest of the world.<br />
I have travelled, as I said to you before, a roat d<br />
and I meet people wherever I go who have considerable interest in<br />
this country. Wherever they may be in the United States or<br />
Great Britain these people are vastly interested in this<br />
country, not just because Fidel Castro has been naughty in Cuba.<br />
No. Not just because some old source of repository of inrestment<br />
has become politically crazy; not only for these reasons, but<br />
because in the long run people will make the investments of<br />
their fortunes in a country which they reoard as stable and<br />
sensible. Stability and sensibility are not monopoly of mind;<br />
nog, is it a party matter. It is where people, whatever their<br />
politics may be, have a sense of responsibility, are fair, w~ here<br />
they treat people fairly .: nd more and more they are looking to<br />
Australia as a source of inspiration to them and a place in<br />
which they can invest their capital. Some people are becoming<br />
very anxious and are looking at , very dollar, every Swiss franc<br />
invested in Australia as piling up obligations for the future.<br />
I think it is a very limited way in which to look at it,<br />
because all these investments from overseas have tended, I om<br />
happy to say, so far to create industries, to create employment<br />
and to create production and bring us more into the field in<br />
wihich we will be -ble to sell manufactured and processed goods to<br />
the rest of the world. It has been of tremendous importance to<br />
us. Only the other day, metaphorically speaking, my own<br />
Government decided to terminate Import Licensing. I do not<br />
need to go into the reasons for that, but, of course, one of the<br />
chief reasons for this is that the overseas balance has been in<br />
a healthy state, and it is all for the good of Australia that we<br />
should have more goods and services in this country,<br />
But if -eo wore to ablish Import Licensing and nothing<br />
more happened, then the demand for imports would become so great<br />
that our overseas balance would run down, and . ec might find<br />
ourselves, at some time in the futuro, a little oe. barrassed, by<br />
a fall in our overseas balance, . hich is vitally important to the<br />
well being of Australia. At that moment we say ' yes, but one of<br />
the great elements to preserve our balances and to keep us<br />
healthy overseas, is the most remarkable influx of private<br />
investment in Australia ;. nd this has become one of the g-rat<br />
factors in our economy. I am putting on one side the money </p>
<p>2.<br />
Governments may borrow institutionally overseas from the World<br />
Bank or from the Export Import Bank, There has been now for<br />
years an influx of private capital investments on private account<br />
and for private purchases in Australia something exceeding a<br />
hundred million pounds a year and I want you gentlemen to say<br />
to yourselves: where would we be without it9 Weo have the most<br />
remarkable increase in population; we have the most remarkable<br />
tasks to perform to further the development of Australia, which,<br />
if it succeeds, will give ample accommodation to all the<br />
people who may be born here or wh. may come here.<br />
If we did not have that inflow of capital from<br />
overseas, we would be chronically short of capital for our own<br />
development. Let us have that clearly ih our minds and,<br />
therefore, one of the things you have to bear in mind, is that<br />
you must help to create Government, of course, can do a<br />
little, but by no moans everything you must create, or help to<br />
create, a climate in Australia which will encourage the flow in<br />
this country of capital of Irhich we are short and which, added<br />
to the capital ro generate, will enable us to go along and<br />
develop our country. And you won't got this investment unless<br />
you have a sense of stability in the minds of people who are<br />
concerned.<br />
O So you see I started with you, your contribution to<br />
stability, the contribution of stability for overseas investment.<br />
And the final stage is this: that we are not at any time a<br />
remarkably safe couhtry. We have ten million people, and we<br />
have all sorts of turbulent and aggressive movements going<br />
round in the world. Only the other day a 24 year-old man<br />
executed a coup in Laos, one of the countries under the umbrella<br />
of the South East Asia Treaty Orgnnization, an Organization which<br />
is vital as the ANZAS Pact to our international security. We<br />
must at all times so conduct our own affairs as to inspire the<br />
confidence of other people and therefore, their friendship and<br />
their interest in this country. Now I won't olaborate on those<br />
things, because there are six other speakers, but you see my<br />
sequence the kind of , iork you do in relation to stability and<br />
what stability does in its relation. to investment and the<br />
O provision of the capital required in this country.<br />
The principal investor, Great Britain, and the United<br />
States of America look at us as a country in which they have<br />
invested, in which they are deeply interested, to whose dovelopmont<br />
they are making a grat contributioh. And that has, I<br />
believe, much to do with the security of Australia. The<br />
security of Australia is not only deor to us who are grown up.<br />
it is even more dear to our children and our grandchildren and<br />
the whole future of a nation, which I am quite determined in my<br />
own mind, is destined to be one of the great and proud, and free,<br />
and responsible, and contributing nations of the world.<br />
That, somewhat tediously expressed at rather more<br />
length than I would hive wished explains why when I come here<br />
to the Commercial Travellers' Association, I fool I am among<br />
people who are at the very grass roots of these groat propositions,<br />
which mean so much to me. </p>
