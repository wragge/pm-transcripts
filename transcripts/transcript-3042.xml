SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, AT<br />
A PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, PARLIAMENT<br />
HOUSE, CANBERRA, 18.10.73<br />
The head of Government, and the head of the Opposition<br />
to the Government, will now be able to join in a welcome to our<br />
Head of State I welcome Her majesty as Queen of Australia.<br />
From tomorrow that title will, in this country, take precedence<br />
over all our other titles.<br />
I, of course, am still rather new to hobnobbing with<br />
Royalty. You will forgive me, therefore, if I drop a name<br />
occasionally. ( laughter) It was at Windsor ( laughter) on Good<br />
Friday, that Her Majesty was gracious enough to say how gladly<br />
she welcomed the suggestion for the change in her title her<br />
Royal Style and Title. The new title expressly, directly, clearly<br />
the role of the monarchy in Australia. ( applause)<br />
It is the Queen herself who, under the Constitution,<br />
under the two Houses, makes up the Australian Parliament. It<br />
is in the Queen that the executive power of this nation is vested.<br />
It is to the Queen that the salaries of the ministers are to be<br />
paid. It is in the Queen's name that the Governor-General assents<br />
to a bill passed by the Houses.<br />
Tomorrow, in fact, the Queen will assent to a Bill passed<br />
by both Houses. There is no difficulty in getting this Bill through<br />
both Houses it is the Royal Style and Titles Bill. But the Queen,<br />
tomorrow, will discharge further of her functions as Head of State.<br />
For the first time, I believe, the Queen herself will swear and<br />
administer the oath of office to a minister. The Queen for the<br />
first time, in Australia, will sign letters of credence. They<br />
will be for her Australian aibasssadors to Japan, the Soviet Union<br />
and the United States, and a letter of commisnion for her High<br />
Commissioner to India. She will complete the formalities for the<br />
ratification of treaties with our nearest and greatest neighbour,<br />
Indonesia, and with another of her realms, Canada. She will apply<br />
laws to the Coral Sea Islands territories. I don't want to raise<br />
questions of off-shore waters or seabeds there are too many<br />
distinguished visitors from some of the Australian provinces for<br />
me to do that. And tomorrow, in assenting to the Royal Style and Titles<br />
Act Her Majesty will appoint the new Great Seal.<br />
Now, on this occasion, Her Majesty comes to Australia<br />
to perform and celebrate a very great occasion for Australia, at<br />
home and abroad the opening of the Sydney Opera House. It is<br />
an event which has been long awaited and long deferred. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I think on each of your recent visits Your Majesty will<br />
have been told that the Sydney Opera House would be opened soon.<br />
You live in the midst of the monuments of history so Your Majesty<br />
will realise that these things do take a little time. This has<br />
taken 14 years; the Parthenon took 15 years; the Royal Church<br />
at Westminster took five centuries. This building will stand in<br />
our region with buildings as great as Borobodur, Ankor Wat. And<br />
they will say the Sydney Opera House. It will be used as long<br />
and probably by even more people than Westminster Abbey or the<br />
cathedrals of equal age or the Pantheon itself. This building is<br />
in Sydney. The earth has not anything to show more fair than<br />
Sydney harbour. ( faint laughter) I would have expected a greater<br />
manifestation of national spirit in the National Capital. I will<br />
say it again: the earth has not anything to show more fair than<br />
Sydney harbour. I'm really only warming the audience up for Mr.<br />
Snedden and Her Majesty. ( laughter and applause)<br />
Now there are indeed sermons in these stones as well as<br />
songs. The course of the planning and erection of the Sydney<br />
Opera House was not always plain sailing. While it took time in<br />
the courage and initiative and the enterprise and inventiveness<br />
to bring about this great building, we must also acknowledge some<br />
of the timidities and frustrations and jealousies and compromises<br />
which played their part in its story. But it is a magnificent<br />
building. Our civilisations are known by their buildings and future<br />
generations will honour the people of this generation the people<br />
of this kingdom by this building. ( applause)<br />
Any occasion that brings you here Ma'am is very much a<br />
family occasion. Last time you brought Prince Charles and Princess<br />
Anne. I am sure it would be the wish of this gathering that you<br />
should hear at first hand the pleasure it brings to all your people<br />
in this country that Princess Anne is about to be married. We look<br />
forward to welcoming her and her husband when you come here next<br />
year. And next year, of course, Your Majesty will also be visiting<br />
Papua New Guinea a self-governing part of Your Majesty's realms.<br />
And you will be illustrating at first hand the opportunity which is<br />
afforded to the people of Papua New Guinea through the free exercise<br />
of choice of their people to serve an independent nation and to be<br />
a member of the Commonwealth of which you are head.<br />
I must express, also, on behalf of this gathering our<br />
pleasure that you have brought your husband with you. Indeed I<br />
think I can say it is with some relief that he has come again.<br />
I'm speaking not only of the fact that when he was last here in<br />
March there were no ladies other than Senatrices at the gathering.<br />
That was an uproarous occasion and the Speaker and the President<br />
well remember the afternoon which followed. This is a very much more<br />
decorous more demure occasion; the Parliament will be better for<br />
it. I am not only expressing relief on behalf of the Presiding<br />
Officers for the good name of the Parliament, I am also expressing<br />
relief mna very more self-interested way. I am the first Prime<br />
Minister since Sir. Robert Menzies who during his term of office has<br />
been able to survive a second visit from Prince Philip. And indeed<br />
I read in the papers that a couple of weeks ago some of my colleagues<br />
were about to urge me to cable him " come quickly". At last the jinx<br />
has been broken. Prince Philip has abandoned his role as the Nemesis </p>
<p>-3-<br />
of Australian Prime Ministers. We have long ago got over our<br />
misgivings. When you Ma'am as heiress presumptive took as your<br />
consort another Philip we had misgivings because the last Philip<br />
who was a consort to the Queen of England did play rather too<br />
strong a political role as we still read. Now, of course,<br />
Prince Philip has eschewed all forms of political activity.<br />
He has devoted himself to many good causes in this nation. One<br />
perhaps might pick out, in particular, the issue of conservation.<br />
It is the field which is so free of petty jealousies and frictions<br />
and pressure groups. There is an automatic consensus on the public<br />
good on any conservation issue. And while all around are losing<br />
their positions, at least Prince Philip is able to'survive.<br />
In welcoming you once again to Australia and to the<br />
Australian Parliament on behalf of the Australian people, let<br />
me adapt : the words of the first Elizabeth when she addressed her<br />
Parliament:" You will find in all your realms a better and a<br />
stronger people but never will you find better friends than in<br />
your Parliament of Australia". </p>
