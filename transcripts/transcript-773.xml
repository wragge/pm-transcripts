FOR PRESS P. M. No. 57/ 1961<br />
NUCLEAR TEST AGREEMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir<br />
Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,<br />
said today " Without having seen the precise<br />
terms of the document, all that can be said<br />
is that it is an important stop in the right<br />
direction. Great credit must go to the<br />
United Kingdom and the United States for the<br />
patient and persistent manner in which they<br />
have sought a nuclear test ban for years.<br />
Indeed, I recall that the achieving of this<br />
result was placed high in the order of<br />
priorities by the Prime Ministerst Conference<br />
some years ago. It is to be hoped that now<br />
that Mr. Khrushchev has come to this agreement,<br />
the atmosphere of negotiation will be preserved<br />
and tensions lessened."<br />
CANBERRA,<br />
26th July, 1963. </p>
