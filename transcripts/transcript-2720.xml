FOR PRESS: NO. 105/ 1972<br />
THE CHANNEL 7 ( BRISBANE) INTERVIEW<br />
Statement by the Prime ' i. nist: r, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William " cM'ahop, CH, MP<br />
A great deal of publicity has been given to comments<br />
made by me in a television interview recorded in Brisbane on Friday<br />
for telecasting next W. ednesday.<br />
These have been misconstrued as criticism by me of my<br />
Ministers. The following is the extract from the transcript of the<br />
interview which deals with the incident<br />
" QUESTION<br />
PRI'" tE<br />
MINISTER: QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: Looking back, Prime Minister, over the last twenty<br />
months, what have you, yourself, learnt from being<br />
Prime Pinister?<br />
I have learnt a lot. I have learnt first of all the<br />
fact I now must make more decisions than I had<br />
intention of making when I first became the Prime<br />
Minister. I wanted to be the head of a team. I<br />
wanted to delegate the authority to the relevant<br />
Ministers resoonsible for the Departments.<br />
TThat went iwrong with that principle?<br />
I couldn't get the work done quickly enough and I<br />
found frequently that the political aoproaches to it<br />
were not as good as I thought they should be. So<br />
from September of last year, I gradually started to<br />
change, and I have been changing a little more quickly<br />
as the days have gone by and I believe with success."<br />
As I said last night, any suggestion that I am<br />
criticising my Ministry is abso ut nonsense.<br />
I was not reflecting in any way on any member of my<br />
Ministry. </p>
<p>There are times when one must, in co-operation with the<br />
relevant Minister, make decisions which cannot be kept waiting.<br />
I have an extremely competent team in whom I have<br />
complete confidence, as I said in my Policy Speech.<br />
It is obvious that as we develoned new programmes, I have<br />
had to take increasing responsibility.<br />
Since I took office twenty months ago, a whole range of<br />
liberal Dolicies have been transformed.<br />
Many new measures have been introduced, including some<br />
of the most significant policy initiatives of thn postwar period.<br />
I make no apologies for having gct these things done, and<br />
done resonrnibly and rapidly.<br />
More will be done when my Government is returned to power<br />
on December 2.<br />
Mr Whitlam has no qualificatinns to speak about Cabinet<br />
administration. His caucus, under outside pressure, has forced him to<br />
accept an unworkable Cabinet system with up to 77 members. Nothing<br />
could be more impracticable.<br />
Under our Cabinet system, the Prime Minister is the leader<br />
of his team. Under Labor, a much larger and unwieldy team would control<br />
the Prime Minister. That team would, in turn, be subject to the outside<br />
control of Labor's non-Ã¸ elected machine.<br />
