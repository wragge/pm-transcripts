    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will commission commemorative medallions to recognise the assistance provided to Australians during World War Two by Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The medallions will be available from August to those PNG citizens who served as civilians helping the war effort, or to their widows or widowers.</p>
<p>Some 55,000 PNG citizens served as civilians and carried supplies, built bases and airfields and evacuated the sick and wounded during the fighting in Papua New Guinea. Their contributions saved the lives of many Australians.</p>
<p>The medallions will feature the image of a Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel helping a wounded Australian along the Kokoda Track - one of the iconic images of World War Two and testament to the strength of the bond between our two nations.</p>
<p>These medallions express the Australian Government's appreciation for the service of these individuals.</p>
<p>PNG citizens can apply for the medallions through the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby.</p>
