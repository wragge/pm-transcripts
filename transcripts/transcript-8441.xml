PRIME MINISTER 25/ 92<br />
The following is the text of a message from the Prime<br />
Minister sent to the Hon Dr Edward Fenech-Adami, Prime<br />
Minister of the Republic of Malta.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people<br />
I would like to extend my congratulations to you<br />
on your re-election as Prime Minister of Malta.<br />
During your premiership over the last five years,<br />
Malta has taken an active role in European and<br />
world affairs, with your contributions to<br />
activities in the United Nations and the<br />
Commonwealth. In the relationship between our two countries,<br />
your visit to Australia in August 1990 was a<br />
landmark event and is well remembered by<br />
Australia's large and active Maltese community.<br />
Historical and community links continue to be an<br />
important factor in our relationship. We are<br />
fortunate that so many people of Maltese origin<br />
have chosen to make this country their home. The<br />
Maltese community has made an important and<br />
lasting contribution to Australia's political,<br />
economic and cultural life and will, I am sure,<br />
continue to work towards building a prosperous and<br />
harmonious multicultural society.<br />
6 March 1992 </p>
