<p>S. POLICY SPEECH<br />
This Policy Speech my first as your Prime Minister<br />
outlines the course my Government will follow if you re-elect us on<br />
November 26. Between now and polling day, our Australian democracy<br />
will be involved in a great debate about many aspects of policy. You will<br />
be taking part in a national stocktaking. The policies you support with<br />
your vote will bear directly on your well-being and the welfare of the nation.<br />
These will be critical years for Australia, but they hold great promise for<br />
our advancement. They should be years of steady national progress<br />
progress, fortifying our security, and strongthening the base of our economy.<br />
As yiou view this forward prospect, you find Australia well<br />
poised for progress. You must feel it in your bones, as I do, that the next<br />
decade may rank as the greatest in our history.<br />
The Government I lead, is, as you know, a coalition between<br />
members of the Liberal Party and of the Country Party. Wie have worked well<br />
and happily together as a team. That unity and teamwork will continue. It<br />
stands in contrast to the disunity and disarray of the Australian Labor Party<br />
which presents itself as the alternative government. It is indeed the only<br />
alternative government within your chot ce.<br />
You will be making this choice at a time when our country is<br />
moving swiftly into a new and historic era. You have only to look at the map<br />
to realise this. The new Parliament will face a challenging period, calling<br />
for what is best in the Australian character. But it can be, we believe, an<br />
era of great opportunity, and we are growing not only in strength but in<br />
maturity. How we are to carry forward the development of this continent<br />
and how best we can make the nation secure, forms the very core of this<br />
election campaign. In asking you to return my Government, we are also asking you<br />
to confirm principles and policies we believe are right for Australia at this<br />
point of our history. They bear on our national integrity and self -respact,<br />
our obligations to friends and allies, our standing in the free world and the<br />
tempo and character of our own growth and development. Al 1 that we plan<br />
and hope for Australia must not be put at risk so far as we Australians can<br />
order events by what occurs outside Australia; and we have much to hold<br />
fast to and build upon inside our country. We are building for tomorrow on<br />
strong and stable foundations. We have squeezed into seventeen years what<br />
some countries have taken one hundred and fifty years to do; what some<br />
countries have never achieved.<br />
11,1e Australians regard our personal freedom, liberty, and<br />
opportunities for enterprise as essential to our way of life. Yet these things<br />
are under constant challenge, chiefly by those, whether at home or abroad,<br />
who believe in an all-powerful State. Our political creed places the highest<br />
value upon human personality' to encourage it, not to suppress, to strengthen<br />
it, riot to weaken. The Socialist basis of the Labor Party is reactionary, its<br />
doctrines are musty and its vision blurred by lingering bitterness from<br />
battles of the past. In recent years, the ALP has become divided into<br />
embittered factions. The Labor Party is not only out of time, but out of tune<br />
with the nation's thinking. In its present disorder it plainly can't give<br />
effective leadership or competent government. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
You have only to look at the Labor Party's response to one of the<br />
most critical challenges of our time. It refuses to ackn~ owledge, or it runs<br />
away from, the great central fact of modern history the tremendous power<br />
conflict between the Communist world and the free world. The foreign policy<br />
of every country is affected incessantly by this conflict. It has been the cause<br />
of personal tragedy, much bloodshed, much waste and much destruction. It<br />
has brought tyranny to some countries and the fear of oppression to others.<br />
Yet the Labor Party dismisses all this as a bogey. What a delusion!<br />
On the one hand there is the desire of free people to win for<br />
themselves a better way of life: On the other, the design of the Communists to<br />
force their way of life on others.<br />
During this campaign our political opponents will try to confuse,<br />
or turn your minds from the central questions which the very history of our<br />
time has raised. We are no longer a small, insular, protected country<br />
sheltered from the storms and stresses of the world. Wie are not a large<br />
power, but we do take pride in being a nation, and pride in what we have done<br />
to build it and hold it. But that recognition of achievement carries with it<br />
responsibilities. It is our belief that the Australian people are equal to those<br />
respons ibilicies. Later I shall have more to say about what is happening in South-<br />
East Asia and South Viet Nam, but the support we and others are giving in<br />
South Viet Nam is not only helping the people of South Viet Nam to resist<br />
Communist subversion and aggression. It is providing a shield behind which<br />
a new Asia can emerge and grow stronger. The presence of ourselves and<br />
othe~ r friendly forces there is not a commitment to war, it is a commitment to<br />
peace and freedom. But it must be such that the Communists will learn that<br />
free Asia, and the friends and allies of free Asia, will not lose heart, will<br />
not be worn down, but have strength and staying power to defend the right<br />
of every people to choose their own social and economic order. Together<br />
we shall be helping to give the people in these countries the food, the skills,<br />
the education and the strength to lead their nations to a better way of life.<br />
That is the kind of involvement we look to with Asia. We all<br />
want peace and a peaceful solution of problems and conflicts. We can even<br />
be on friendly terms with countries that have fundamentally different ideologies<br />
to our own, so long as they don't try to impose their ideas on us by force, by<br />
subversion or any other means.<br />
These are matters of great significance which I shall develop<br />
later. But I move now from this broad introduction of the issues of the<br />
campaign to some of the domestic proposals we have in mind for the next<br />
three years.<br />
DOMESTIC PROPOSALS<br />
The economy, despite one of the most severe droughts in our<br />
history, is in good shape. It has continued to expand. So has our trade.<br />
Our own efforts and savings, aided by a continuing flow of capital<br />
investment from overseas, are enabling us to maintain full employment with<br />
a growing population. We have one of the highest standards of living in the world. We<br />
have continuing policies, many of which require increasing annual expenditures.<br />
But, in addition to these, we have a number of new proposals, which I will<br />
outlIne. First I mention education. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
This is important to every Australian and vital to the nation.<br />
Our record in this field is proof of our sincerity.<br />
Education is the responsibility of a number of authorities. Each<br />
has its role to play.<br />
For our part, we have assisted in meeting the needs of the<br />
universities,' the establishment of advanced colleges of education; we have<br />
helped technical education. WIe instituted grants for school science blocks.<br />
To assist parents and students we have greatly enlarged the Commonwealth<br />
scholarship scheme for university education. With the establishment of<br />
colleges of advanced education we have provided a similar scholarship system<br />
for them. Commonwealth scholarships are also available for the final two<br />
years of secondary education and for technical education. We have given<br />
special taxation allowances to parents for education expenses.<br />
We now propose further assistance to education.<br />
We will provide eight million dollars a year over the next three<br />
financial years for the construction and equipment of new colleges for teacher<br />
training throughout Australia.<br />
This money will require no matching grants from the States. It<br />
will be used by us to build colleges on sites selected by the States, on condition<br />
that the State does not reduce its expenditure on teacher training, and on<br />
condition that at least ten per cent, of the places at the new colleges are<br />
reserved for teachers not bonded to State Education Departments.<br />
Winners of advanced education scholarships will be able to apply<br />
those scholarships to a teacher training course in any training college to which<br />
they are admitted. These scholarships carry the same benefits as university scholarships<br />
and will be available to unbonded students.<br />
Our scheme to provide science laboratories and equipment to all<br />
schools has been highly successful. We intend to do more.<br />
In the next financial year and subsequently, we will double the<br />
amount available to independent schools for these laboratories.<br />
We believe this will ensure that in four years every science<br />
teaching secondary school in Australia, whether Government or independent,<br />
will have the science teaching laboratories and the equipment it needs<br />
provided with the financial help of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
We believe the time has come to establish a Commonwealth<br />
Ministry of Education and Science and we will do this.<br />
This Ministry will be responsible not only for education, but<br />
also for certain areas of scientific activity. CSIRO will function within the<br />
new . Ministry.<br />
SOCIAL SERVICES I turn to social services. </p>
<p>-4<br />
All through the life of the Government we have carried out our<br />
policy of giving to the needy the assistance we can afford as a government and<br />
nation with many other obligations. It has been our practice to review all<br />
aspeczts of our health and social service policies each year when we consider<br />
the Budget. We have liberalised the means test progressively. We now<br />
propose further liberalisation. I shall elaborate on this in a supplementary<br />
statement. We will enlarge our social service programme on four fronts<br />
We will raise by one hundred and fifty-six dollars the limits both of<br />
property and income within which pensions will be payable to the<br />
aged, the invalid, and the widows.<br />
We will expand the scope of the Aged Persons Homes Act, particularly<br />
in regard to housing the needy, by making local governing bodies<br />
eligible for our subsidy.<br />
We will1 further assist the disabled in the community by capital<br />
assistance on a two dollars for one dollar basis to sheltered<br />
workshops, and by a special allowance to disabled persons employed<br />
in those workshops.<br />
* We will make annual grants to certain national voluntary agencies<br />
working in the field of social welfare.<br />
HOUSING Australians want to own their own homes. This is an ambition<br />
we have fostered. No country can point to a higher percentage of home ownership.<br />
More than half the homes in Australia today have been constructed<br />
since we came to office in 1949.<br />
In the last Parliament we introduced the Home Savings Grant<br />
Scheme which has already benefited sixty-four thousand young couples. We<br />
also introduced the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.<br />
We will now give the Minister for Housing new discretionary<br />
powers designed to meet cases of harship under the Home Savings Grant<br />
Scheme. The discretionary powers will date back to the start of the scheme.<br />
Details of these are set out in a supplementary statement.<br />
Further, we will extend the scheme to benefit widowed persons<br />
aged less than thirty-six years who have one or more dependent children.<br />
The limitation on the value of the home, including land, will be<br />
raised from fourteen thousand dollars to fifteen thousand dollars.<br />
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WATER CONSERVATION<br />
Since 1949, we have consistently carried out our policy of<br />
national development. For us this is a wide and embracing term. It means<br />
people as well as physical resources.<br />
One aspect of national development is vivid in our minds from<br />
the recent drought. This is the conservation of that precious commodity<br />
water. </p>
<p>We believe a programme of water conservation related to<br />
national needs should now be drawn up by us with State Governments.<br />
We have in mind a national water resources development<br />
programme. Its purpose would be to increase water conservation activity,<br />
to reduce hazards of drought and expand primary production.<br />
VWe envisage that the States will maintain at least their existing<br />
levels of expenditure in this field, from their own financial resources. We<br />
shall invite the States to put forward programmes of additional works they<br />
woul. d propose for Commonwealth financing. We, in turn, will make a<br />
contribution to enable additional works, selected on their merits, to be carried<br />
out. One cannot, at this stage, be precise about the capital requirements<br />
of our programme. We contemplate, however, that the contribution<br />
to be made by the Commonwealth for selected additional works could amount<br />
to fifty million dollars over the next five years.<br />
WOOL_ A soundly-based research effort is essential to this important<br />
industry's prosperity. So is an energetic, imaginative and well-directed<br />
promrotion campaign. The Government is prepared to increase the scale of its<br />
contributions for wool research and promotion when the present arrangements<br />
expire next June. For the ensuing three years the Government would provide<br />
funds on a dollar for dollar basis subject to a maximum annual contribution<br />
of fourteen million dollars for a programme agreed upon by it and the wool<br />
indus try.<br />
DAIRY INDUSTRY The present five-year plan finishe-son 30th June, 1967, and my<br />
Government would consult with industry bodies on the details of a further fiveyear<br />
plan. We would discuss with the industry the level of the annual subsidy<br />
allocation; the Commonwealth's underwriting of the equalisation arrangement<br />
for butter and cheese; and plans for diversifying markets abroad.<br />
SUG; AR We have shown our determination to maintain a strong and<br />
prosperous sugar industry. Recently we have made loans available to canegrowers<br />
and millers distressed by dmnught.<br />
The nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy introduced in August will be<br />
of particular help to this industry.<br />
The 1966 season's production was affected by drought and<br />
abnormally low export prices. 7./ Ie have bolstered the return by loaning the<br />
induStry nineteen million dollars on concessional terms.<br />
The Commonwealth/ Queens land Sugar Agreement is due to<br />
expire on 1st August, 1967. We have assured the Queensland Government we<br />
will consult fully with them and ascertain industry viewis on all matters<br />
associated with the industry's position bef ore renewing it. This agreement<br />
has provided valuable protection for the industry. ./ 6 </p>
<p>/ 7<br />
-6<br />
We are persisting vigorously with our efforts to negotiate an<br />
international sugar agreement. Our aim is to ensure our producers<br />
remunerative prices for satisfactory export quantities.<br />
EXTENSION SERVICES<br />
My Government has a programme which assists rural industries<br />
considerably in research and extension. Some eighty million dollars has<br />
been made available through joint industry/ Commonwealth schemes for<br />
research by State and Commonwealth Departments, universities and the<br />
CSLRO. The results must be passed on to the farmer. For this improved<br />
agricultural extension services are necessary.<br />
We have now embarked on a five-year programme. Under this<br />
the Commonwealth's contribution to extension services will be increased by<br />
four million dollars above the present level of one point four million dollars.<br />
STABILISATION SCHEMES FOR WHEAT, COTTON AND DRIED VINE FRUITS<br />
At the appropriate time, my Government will go into discussions<br />
with the wheat, cotton and dried vine fruits industries for the re-negotiation<br />
of stabilisation schemes having the obj ective of sustaining in respect of each<br />
a stable industry.<br />
NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT<br />
The development of the North. Commonwealth, State and<br />
local governments, privae individuals and companies are all involved in the<br />
whole pattern of northern development.<br />
Apart from our own explorations, we have encouraged private<br />
enterprise to undertake wide-ranging exploration of the resources of our<br />
north. Mineral and oil discoveries have resulted.<br />
Development has followed actively. New railways and ports,<br />
and vast new processing plants, are being built.<br />
Currently, capital projects totalling more than two thousand<br />
million doIllars are in train. These works are giving new e mployment and<br />
creating new communities.<br />
Our great new resources some still being discovered must<br />
be effectively utilised. It is desirable that there should be an Australian<br />
participation in the ownership and control of those resources along with the<br />
industries growing out of them. There are instances in which more capital<br />
is needed to exploit these opportunities than existing Australian companies<br />
cant marshal. New arrangements and facilities for the provision of capital<br />
have to be devised. This is not an easy matter, but the Government has<br />
been working actively and earnestly upon it, as have people and institutions<br />
inthe world of finance. We are confident we shall find practical means of<br />
meeting this objective. </p>
<p>-7<br />
BEEF ROADS S i n c e 19 61, we have provided almost thirty million dollars<br />
to the Queensland and Western Australian Governments for construction of<br />
beef roads. This has been money well spent. It has contributed to the<br />
development of the beef industry in Northern Australia and to our export<br />
earnings from beef.<br />
We know the industry is capable of further substantial expansion<br />
and that prospects for beef exports are bright. But a still further improved<br />
road system is essential for any major expansion. This would promote the<br />
development of our northern areas generally.<br />
Current ani igiements for the financing of beef roads end in<br />
June, 1967. We will discuss with the Governments of Queensland and Western<br />
Australia a fifty million dollars programme of beef roads extending over a<br />
period of seven years.<br />
This would represent an even greater contribution to this wcr k<br />
than in the past. Vie are doing more also in the Northern Territory.<br />
The new programme ther4 extending over five or six years, will<br />
begin early in 1967-68.<br />
TOURISM W e s ee a n ex pa n d ing future for the tourist industry.<br />
Our annual grants to the Australian National Travel Association have been<br />
increasing substantially, and, in 1966-67, were eight hundred and sixty-two<br />
thousand dollars. Increasing activity and expenditure providing growing<br />
exchange earnings for us require the establishment of an Australian Tourist<br />
Commission set ' up as a statutory body.<br />
We believe this would have the support of ANTA, the tourist<br />
industry generally, and the State Governments all of whom have a direct<br />
Interest in this matter.<br />
A GENERAL COMMENT ON OUR DOMESTIC PROGRAMME<br />
What I have outlined by no means represents the limit of our<br />
activities in the domestic field over the next three years. But it gives you the<br />
trendl of our thinking.<br />
FOREIGN POLICY<br />
This brings me back to what I described earlier as the very core<br />
of this election. Our domestic programme depends for its fulfilment on the<br />
security of the nation. But the principles and objectives of our foreign policy<br />
are at issue in this election. Our Labor opponents attack our assessment of<br />
Austrcalia's external security. Domestic affairs cannot be separated from<br />
foreign affairs. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Our foreign policy is based on the beliefs we have and the plans<br />
we have about the kind of Australia all of us want to see and about the kind<br />
of society we want to build and preserve here. The security of those things<br />
we think are good in Australia depends on the security of a kind of world that<br />
also values what is precious both to the individual and the good society.<br />
So we have joined with others in paying a price for the freedoms we hope to<br />
retain. Unless there is security for all small nations there cannot be<br />
security for any small nation. Unless principles of international conduct are<br />
preserved in all international situations they are n~ ot likely to be preserved in<br />
any. That is the essence of our foreign policy.<br />
We have always seen Australia's security in tetms of world<br />
seciir ity. To that end we have for long allied ourselves with Britain and the<br />
United States. The basic principles and objectives of their policies are, for<br />
the most part, shared by us. We have sought, above all things, to keep our<br />
counrtry at peace; but to have some assurance that Australia will have strong<br />
and reliable friends. That is why we played our part in the making of the SEATO and<br />
ANZUS Treaties which carry with them responsibilities as well as benefits.<br />
Because of those responsibilities, Australian soldiers are fighting<br />
in South Viet Nam.<br />
We know and share the genuine concern of responsible Australians<br />
about what has been happening there.<br />
But we believe our decisions have been right.<br />
We seek a peaceful settlement of the conflict through negotiation.<br />
But think of the consequences of abandoning our objectives and the people of<br />
South Viet Nam. South Viet Nam would become a Communist state, and the lives<br />
and Security of millions who have resisted Communism would be in jeopardy.<br />
The impact of our complete withdrawal, as proposed by the<br />
Labor Party, would be felt throughout South-East Asia.<br />
We, too, would come under threat.<br />
We have a vital interest in the effective presence and participation<br />
of the United States as a major power in Asia and the Pacific. W~ e have obligations<br />
arising from our treaty relationships, from our role as an ally, and from<br />
the fact that our own international interests are directly involved in preserving<br />
South-East Asia from aggression and from Communist domination.<br />
It has been said that our policies in Viet Nam have damaged<br />
Australia's standing in Asia.<br />
This is absurd. Most Asian countries share our belief that<br />
Communist aggression indeed, aggression of any kdid must be resisted.<br />
Our close a,_-ociations with the free countries of Asia have undaib tedly<br />
been strefig-aiened. t </p>
<p>9-<br />
DEFENCE I turn now to defence generally.<br />
The centre of this problem, in global perspective, is in Asia<br />
and hence in our own part of the world.<br />
We must meet large expenditures for forces adequate to our<br />
obligations, thoroughly trained and equipped with the best and most modern<br />
conventional armaments. To finance defence on the scale required and with the necessary<br />
personnel increases in all services, our defence expenditure has otrelady<br />
more than doubled over the past four years.<br />
We live in an unstable region. We see it as a basic responsibility<br />
of the Government of a free people to be prepared for any eventuality.<br />
NATIONAL SERVICE<br />
One of the basic issues of this election is national military<br />
training carrying the duty to serve abroad as well as at home.<br />
If we are to meet our obligations, we must have trained men<br />
immediately available to do the job. Our Army is to be built from twenty-two<br />
thousand seven hundred and fifty to forty thousand as quickly as practicable.<br />
Voluntary enlistment did not provide suitable men to the extent<br />
needed. We and our advisers concluded there was no realistic alternative<br />
to national service. The call-up has been devised so as to cause the smallest possible<br />
disturbance to studies, employment and family commitments, and so as to<br />
ensure thorough and effective training before a national serviceman is<br />
required to serve overseas. The policy permits young men to make a choice<br />
between service with the Regular Forces and service with the Qltizen Forces.<br />
Withdrawal of national servicemen from Viet Nam as intended<br />
by the Labor Party, would render our task force ineffective and seriously<br />
disrupt the~ Army. It would inevitably mean loss of confidence in Australia<br />
by its allies. Machines and money alone do not mak2-a defence establishment.<br />
Our concept of highly-trained, mobile striking forces has been made effective<br />
by the individualism, the intelligence, and cool gallantry of the men who<br />
wear Australia's uniform.<br />
National servicemen serving Australia abroad today are as one<br />
with their Regular Army comrades in efficiency, purpose and courage.<br />
CONCLUSION I have given a broad picture of our thinking on large questions<br />
of policy. My supplementary statements issued tonight will give more<br />
information on these and other aspects of policy. From experience you can<br />
have confidence that we shall be doing all this and a good deal more. You<br />
have seen us give prompt effect in the past to our election undertakings. We<br />
have also taken further progressive and useful action to meet changing<br />
conditions and new developments. I now draw all this together against the<br />
political background. </p>
<p>I 1 Or<br />
The Liberal Party, In association with the Country Party, has<br />
had the longest period of unbroken Federal rule in Australian history.<br />
Our Government has remained vigorous and forward looking,<br />
assisted by fresh talent from the ranks of our private members. The Deputy<br />
Prime Minister and myself are the only two members remaining from the<br />
Ministry formed when we were returned to office in 1949.<br />
Today we are clearly more in tune with the aspirations and<br />
outlook of Australians than our opponents. For the gimter period of our long<br />
term of office, the Australian Labor Party has been ravaged by bitter faction<br />
fights. Nowhere has this internal conflict been fiercer nor more destructive<br />
than in the critical field of external security.<br />
Even our American allies have been a target for the spleen of<br />
the extremists in the Labor Party. Surely we Australians recognise who<br />
are our true friends. The Labor Party, plagued for so long by the virus of<br />
doctrinaire socialism, left-wing influence and class bitterness, seems to<br />
have its will too paralysed to think clearly on great issues that affect our<br />
safE. ty. The business of government and the conduct of our internal and<br />
international affairs are not for men who cannot be of one mind, sometimes<br />
for a week on end. Our national affairs are not merchandise for backroom<br />
bargaining between leaders of factions.<br />
Many times in recent years, the people of Australia have had<br />
a sharp reminder that a Federal Labor Government would not be responsible<br />
to the people, or even to its own judgment, but that it would be bound hand<br />
and foot by the decisions of thirtysix people from the A. L. not, for the<br />
most part, elected by the people of Australia and in no sense responsible<br />
to them. This country deserves better than that. A party that cannot<br />
lead. itself has no claim to lead a nation.<br />
Your choice should be clear.<br />
On the great questions of national security, my Government<br />
is completely single-minded nited. Our opponents are confused and<br />
divided. We believe our national policies look to Australia's future<br />
and the national thinking of our opponents is Sndl bogged down in the past.<br />
We offer the country strength, unity, and purpose as opposed<br />
to disunity and confusion. Wie offer you a programme in domestic affairs<br />
which advances national development, national security and social justice.<br />
The choice for you is, we believe, clear-cut. My<br />
colleagues and I have enough faith in the common sense and maturity of<br />
the Australian people to be confident about your answer. </p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENTS<br />
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS COULD NOT,<br />
FOR REASONS OF TIME, BE INCLUDED IN A BROADCAST<br />
AND TELEVISED POLICY SPEECH LIMITED TO<br />
MINUTES. BUT THEY ARE ISSUED FOR PUBLICATION<br />
CONJOINTLY WITH THE MAIN SPEECH.<br />

<p>MEANS TEST<br />
Since it came to office in December, 1949, the Government's<br />
policy in Social Services has been to assist those with the greatest need.<br />
In circumstances where resources are limited, the Government's policy<br />
has been to continually improve the position of existing pensioners and to<br />
progressively liberalise the means test in order to permit increasing<br />
numbers in the lower income groups to obtain pensions. This policy<br />
will be continued during the life of the present Government.<br />
Very significant improvements have been brought about. In<br />
1949, s single person with an income ( including income from property) of<br />
$ 377 per annum, or a married couple with a totalI income of $ 7154 per<br />
annumn, were not entitled to an age or invalid pension. Since then these<br />
limits have been more than doubled, so that today, pension eligibility is<br />
retained by a single person until income, ignoring any income from<br />
property, reaches $ 1,040 per annum in the case of -a single person, and<br />
950 per annum for a married couple ( nassuming that the val;, ue of<br />
property does not affect the rate of pension payable",.<br />
We now propose to increase these limits still further by $ 156<br />
per annum for both single persons and married couples. The new<br />
limits of income before eligibility for pension ceases will be respectively<br />
196 per annum for single persons, and 106 per annum for married<br />
couples. Full age or invalid pensions will be payable where a single<br />
persons's income does not exceed $ 520 per annum, and a married<br />
couple's combined income $ 884. These income limits are increased if<br />
there are children. Expressed in terms of property, what we propose is equally'<br />
liberal. In 1949, no age or invalid pension was payable if a single person<br />
had property valued at 500 or 000O in the case of a married couple.<br />
Because of the progressive easings of the means test, the corresponding<br />
figures today for property, apart from the value of a home, motor vehicle<br />
and certain personal effects, are $ 10, 80,0 for a single person and $ 20, 320<br />
for a married couple. Under the further improvement now proposed, a single<br />
person may have $ 12, 360 in value of property, and a married couple $ 21, 88C,<br />
provided there is no income other than from property, before losing<br />
eligibility for pension.<br />
The means test on widows' pensions will be similarly eased.<br />
For example, at present, a widow with one child may receive a full pension<br />
if~ her income does not exceed $ 520 per annum, and she retains eligibility<br />
for some pens-Lon until her income reaches 404. These limits will be<br />
raised to $ 676 and 560 per annum respectively.<br />
As in the case of age and invalid pensioners, a widow with<br />
children may receive an extra $ 156 per annum for each child after the first<br />
without affecting her pension, which is increased by a further $ 78 per annum<br />
for each such child. Thus, the amount of income which renders her ineligible<br />
for pension rises by $ 234 per annum for each child after the first.<br />
If a widow with a child or children has no income other than from<br />
property, she will receive some pension until the value of her property reaches<br />
$ 16, 040. / 2 </p>

HOMES FOR AGED PERSONS<br />
During the twelve years the legislation has been in operation,<br />
the response by the churches, charitable and other voluntary agencies and<br />
the public to the Aged Persons Homes Act has been magnificent. We have<br />
recently widened the policy under which grants are made on a $ 2 for $ 1<br />
basis, to permit eligible organisations to give greater attention to the<br />
aged who are frail and infirm.<br />
We will widen the scope of assistance by including local<br />
governing bodies in the organisations eligible under the Act and accepting<br />
contributions by them towards Aged Persons Homes as qualifying for<br />
Commonwealth matching subsidy.<br />
It is our hope that local governing bodies will sponsor aged<br />
persons homes in the areas of their administration and that particular<br />
attention will be given by them to the housing needs of pensioners. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
HELP FOR DISABLED<br />
Another area in which we believe the greatest effectiveness<br />
can be obtained only if there is a marriage of government and voluntary<br />
effort is in relation to sheltered workshops.<br />
Vie will forthwith begin consultation with both voluntary and<br />
other agencies with a view to granting capital assistance on a $ 2 for $ 1<br />
basis towards the expansion and establishment of sheltered workshops<br />
conducted by voluntary agencies throughout the Commonwealth. We have<br />
in mind that this aid should run not only to workshops that aim to restore<br />
the disabled to outside employment but also to those that will provide<br />
employment under sheltered conditions to those who have a permanent<br />
residual disability. Vie will introduce a special allowance for employees in<br />
sheltered workshops. The allowance will be reduced when earnings exceed<br />
a certain limit but will be so arranged that employees will receive a net<br />
increase in income for each increment of earnings.<br />
The effect of these two measures should provide a strong<br />
incentive to the development of sheltered workshops. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE<br />
Government has a predominant role in the<br />
field of social security, but there will always be large areas in which<br />
the welfare services of our community must depend upon voluntary<br />
effort. Accordingly, we have decided to make annual grants to the<br />
Australian Council of Social Services and to the Australian Council for<br />
Rehabilitation of Disabled.<br />
The annual grant, over the next three years, to each of<br />
the Councils will be $ 15, 000 of which $ 1C, OCC will be on the basis of<br />
$ 1 for each $ 1 raised by the organisation.<br />
These two grants will be additional to a grant of $ 60, 000<br />
for each of the next two years that the Government has undertaken to<br />
make to the National Old People's Welfare Council to assist it in<br />
co-ordinating the work of voluntary agencies in the field of the welfare of<br />
t ie elderly. </p>
<p>HOME SAVINGS GRANT SCHEME<br />
In the 1963 Policy Speech, we undertook to provide a<br />
Commonwealth grant of II1 for every 3Z3 saved by a person under 36 years<br />
of age to assist young married people to buy or build their own homes.<br />
The maximum grant payable to any young couple is<br />
To be eligible for the grant, the savings must have been<br />
deposited over a pedod of at least three years in a Home Savings Account<br />
with a bank, or with a building or housing society, or used for purposes of<br />
acquiring a home. Our Home Savings Grant Scheme has been in operation for<br />
nearly 2J2 years. some 64, 000 couples have received the grant and grants<br />
totalling almost $ 29 million have been paid.<br />
Because the Scheme is a novel one and is still in its early<br />
years of operation, cases have arisen where, due to genuine misunderstanding<br />
or lar.* of awareness of all the requirements, some applicants have<br />
failed to qualify for the grant.<br />
While we wish all applications to be lodged within twelve<br />
months of buying or building a home, we propose to give the Secretary of<br />
the Department of Housing certain discretionary powers so that cases may<br />
be treated sympathetically on their individual merits. These discretionary<br />
powers will apply to eligible persons who bought or commenced to build<br />
their homes on or after December 2, 1963.<br />
The matters in respect of which a discretion might be given<br />
are To extend the time limit for the lodgment of applications from three<br />
months to twelve months and to empower the Department to accept<br />
applications lodged within a further period if circumstances suggest<br />
that this is justified.<br />
To empower the Department to disregard ownership of " another<br />
dwelling house" where it is sctisfied that it would be unreasonable<br />
to regard the dwelling house as the matrimonial home or suitable<br />
for this purpose.<br />
To empower the Department to determine that any interest in land<br />
that it considers appropriate for the purposes of the Act be<br />
accepted as an " approved interest".<br />
To give the Department a discretionary power to accept savings made<br />
in a period of three years ending on a date not more than fourteen<br />
days before or after the prescribed date in circumstances it<br />
considers reasonable. The definition of the prescribed date will<br />
not be altered.<br />
To permit the Department to pay a grant to a person who has been<br />
widowed on or after the prescribed date of the amount of the<br />
grant that would have been paid to one or both of the couple if<br />
the spouse had not died.<br />
To give the Department a discretionary power to permit an applicant's<br />
savings period to be broken for a short period should there appear<br />
to be good or sufficient reasons.<br />
All these proposed new discretionary -rs are designed to meet<br />
cases of hardship that have akreqdy arisen. . Tllid cre tionar v po%% ers will,<br />
therefore, apply from the date of commencement of the Schemre. 4/ 6 </p>

PRIMARY I N D USITR Y<br />
O ur r uralI industries have set records in expansion in<br />
the past 17 years. Production in 1965-66 was 47 per cent, above that of<br />
1948-1949 and some 60 per cent, above the level of the immediate pre-war<br />
years. This has been achieved in spite of severe drought in extensive areas<br />
of New South Wales and Queensland in 1965-1966.<br />
A farm work force of less than half a million, smaller than<br />
in the pre-war period, has produced this phenomenal result.<br />
Our policy is to promote efficient and expanding primary<br />
industries to meet the demands of a growing population and secondary<br />
industries, and to provide a rising amount of export income.<br />
Our constant objective is to ensure that returns for rural<br />
commodities are maintained, and, if possible, improved, and that primary<br />
producers are able to earn remunerative incomes.<br />
Since our election in 1949, we have paid out approximately<br />
$ 497 million in subsidy on the production of butter and cheese and the<br />
export of processed milk products under the various five-year dairy<br />
industry stabilisation plans.<br />
The current plan ends next June. We will consult with the<br />
industry bodies on the details of a further five-year plan to apply from<br />
July 1, 1967. / 7 </p>

HEALTH<br />
Our National Health Scheme, which in many<br />
parts of the world is regarded as a model of its kind, has been<br />
progressively improved during the past three years.<br />
It is estimated, for example, that a further 120, 000 age,<br />
invalid, widow and service pensioners and 17, 00Q of their dependants<br />
became eligible for enrolment in the Pensioner Medical Service following<br />
relaxation of the Pensioner Medical Service means test.<br />
Also, in 1964, we introduced a new schedule of Commonwealth<br />
medical benefits. The general effect was to increase Commonwealth<br />
benefits by 33 and 1/ 3rd per cent.<br />
We have reviewed the list of pharmaceutical benefits from<br />
time to time since 1963 to ensure that full advantage is taken of modern<br />
developments in the availability of new and improved drugs.<br />
We will continue to improve our National Health Scheme / 8 </p>

PAPUA_-AND _ NEW1 GUINEA<br />
We propose to continue our vigorous programmes of balanced<br />
development economic, social and political towards which we have<br />
allotted a grant of $ 70 million this year, compared with $ 50 million three<br />
years ago. To this end, we are prepared, on the basis of the co-operation<br />
of the people of Papua and New Guinea and their elected representatives, to<br />
continue to spend more over the next few years. The object will be to<br />
shorten the time that must elapse before the Territory of Papua and New<br />
bieacan finance its own basic need s from its own resources.<br />
Without this, there can be no real freedom of choice when the<br />
time comes for Papuans and New Guineans to decide what eventual political<br />
status they want. The further expansion of primary and secondary industry and<br />
increased export income will be vigorously pursued in harmony with the<br />
broad policy of economic development based on the W~ orld B ank Missions<br />
1964 Report. The newly -established Papua and New Guinea Development<br />
Bank will play an important development role.<br />
In political affairs the Government will not be slow to make<br />
constitutional changes if the Papuans and New Guineans want them, nor will<br />
the Government press changes upon the people if they do not want change.<br />
In accordance with this approach, the membership of the House of Assembly,<br />
which was set up in 1964 with a great majority of elected members, will be<br />
increased in size for the next elections in 1968. Again if the people of<br />
Papua and New Guinea indicate a desire for a limited system of ministerial<br />
representation, appropriate arrangements will be worked out.<br />
The new Institute of Higher Technical Education and the new<br />
University of Papua and New Guinea have been established to help in the<br />
training and education of Papuans and New Guineans. In political, social<br />
and economic matters the advancement of the indigenous people of the<br />
Territory will continue to be a basic objective.<br />
I confirm once again that we will defend the Territory of<br />
Papua and New Guinea as if it was part of the Australian mainland. / 9 </p>

ABORIGINES<br />
In the field of aboriginal advancement, we will continue<br />
to co-operate with the Governments of the States.<br />
In the Northern Territory, where the Commonwealth<br />
is specially responsible, no Territory laws discriminate against<br />
aborigines. In employment we will continue to support equality of<br />
wages and conditions for aborigines. The Govern ment supported this<br />
principle in the pastoral industry where substantial interim increases are<br />
being made and where complete equality under the award will apply not<br />
later than 1968. Royalties on minerals in aboriginal reserves will be paid<br />
into a Trust Fund for the benefit of the aboriginal people.<br />
We will continue to improve the educational opportunities<br />
for aboriginal children.<br />
Proposals are being put before the Northern Territory<br />
Legislative Council to make land on aboriginal reserves available for<br />
leasing to aborigines on the advice of a special Board of which the<br />
majority of the members will be aborigines. </p>

NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />
WN e w ill continue policies that provide a climate of<br />
opportunity and open up further prospects of growth for the mining,<br />
pastoral and tourist industries in this Territory, which occupies one-sixth<br />
of the continent and is an area of special Commonwealth responsibility.<br />
We will go on encouraging th e development of the great mineral<br />
potentialities of the Territory in such places as Cove, Groote Eylandt and<br />
McArthur River. At these and other places investment could total more<br />
than $ 40G million. The pastoral industry has been developing substantially with<br />
the establishment of export abattoirs at Katherine and Darwin and with new<br />
techniques for improved pastures and with the provision of more credit for<br />
water and subsidies for imported stud stock. This development will be<br />
stimulated still further by the continuation of the beef road programme for<br />
the Territory. More than $ 3 million will be spent on this programme during<br />
the current year and 900 miles of beef roads will then have been completed<br />
in the Territory. Moreover, special loans and freight subsidies are helping<br />
pastoralists in the Centre to recover from the most disastrous drought in the<br />
region's history. Further expansion can be expected in the Northern Territory<br />
tourist industry which, with improved roads and facilities, has been growing<br />
rapidly. We will continue to give financial backing to the development<br />
of the Territory which has a higher growth rate than almost any other part<br />
of the Commonwealth. </p>
