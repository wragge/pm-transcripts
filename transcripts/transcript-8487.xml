SPEECH BY THE PRIKE MINISTER, THE HON P. J. 1CATING<br />
OFFICIAL BANQUET GIVEN BY PRESIDENT SOEHARTO<br />
ISTANA NEGARAt JAKARTA, 21 APRIL 1992<br />
1 am very pleased to be here in Indonesia on this my first<br />
visit abroad as Prime Minister. As one of the new Heads of<br />
Government in the region, i appreciate the warm words of<br />
welcome from the region's undisputed elder statesman.<br />
I wish to congratulate you, Mr President, on your election<br />
as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Movement's<br />
summit in Jakarta this September will demonstrate once again<br />
the leading role Indonesia plays in important international<br />
forums.<br />
Mr President, more than forty years ago, the political party<br />
which it is my privilege to lead the Australian Labor<br />
Party lent its support to the people of Indonesia in their<br />
struggle for independunce.<br />
We in the Australian labour movement have always respected<br />
Indonesia's determination to pursue an independent course in<br />
the world. Indeed, that same independent frame of mind in<br />
something which my government is Meen to foster in<br />
Australia. It is important to our strength as a people and as a nation.<br />
Mr President, at a time of rapid economic and strategic<br />
change, Indonesia and Australia have more in common than our<br />
dirrerent histories and cultures would suggest.<br />
We both understand that Our ability to participate fully in<br />
the rapid economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region depends<br />
on more than the natural resources with which our countries<br />
are so richly endowed.<br />
Nations need more than this. Success also depends on what<br />
you, Mr President, have long referred to as " national<br />
resilience". We recognise this in Australia. 1i Hpl J i NO U 1-Ui/ </p>
<p>TEL: 21. Apr. 92 19: 41 No. 017 P. 02/ 1<br />
We know that to reach our full potential we must work<br />
cooperatively, combine our talents and energy, harness our<br />
human and material strength, and lua~ e Australia more truly<br />
one natio~ n.<br />
I think you will understand some of the challenges we see<br />
ourselves facing.<br />
Australia is a vast continent. It is also a sprawling<br />
federation. The great distances, and the cultural gaps which emerged<br />
over time, have consequences for economic and political<br />
efficiency, for national cohesion for our ability to<br />
pursue and achieve national goals.<br />
in the 1990s I believe you will sea Australia face these<br />
long-standing realities am never before. I think you will<br />
see us pursue our goals as never before with an<br />
unparalle). ed sense of purpose and efficiency.<br />
Under your leadership, Indonesia has undergone an economic<br />
transformation which has dramatically improved living<br />
standards in your own country, and contributed to wider<br />
regional stability,<br />
You have made the difficult Judgements, the tough decisions,<br />
required to turn your economy towards the glal economy.<br />
We have * ought the same goal of international<br />
competitiveness end, in the past decade, we have rollowed a<br />
very similar path towards it.<br />
As our two countries have become more outward looking, our<br />
trading relationship has become more significant.<br />
Australian exports to Indonesia are nearly four times<br />
greater than they were ten years ago. Indonesia, which was<br />
Australia's 17th largest export market ten years ago, is now<br />
our loth largest export market.<br />
Our trade has diversified in much the same degree as it has<br />
grown. minerals and primary products remain important but they no<br />
long3er dominate.<br />
Much of the increase in exports to Austr~ alia in recent years<br />
has been in manufactured goods.<br />
Australian exporters have found in Indonesia now markets for<br />
manufactures, machinery, computers, and telecommunications<br />
products, as well as in education services, engineering<br />
consul. tancies, construction, banking and finanae,<br />
14r President, our countries also share rundamental interests<br />
in the stability and security of our region-</p>
<p>Both governments were active in the long negotiations<br />
leading up to last October's signing of a comiprehensive<br />
political settlament in the Cambodia conflict.<br />
Australian and Indonesian armed forces are now serving<br />
together in Cambodia as part of the United Nations<br />
peacekeeping force.<br />
Let me also take this opportunity to applaud the active and<br />
substantial role that Indonesia has played in ASFEAN, I<br />
ASEAN's creation in the 1960s, and its success and maturity<br />
today owe much to you Mr Pros ident. The recti-on owes much to<br />
you. We are very conscious of the benefits which flow to<br />
Australia from Indonesia's positive contribution to regional<br />
affairs. we also welcome the ASEAN countries' recent decision to<br />
create an ASEAN Free Trade Area.<br />
Hr President, your country's role in ASEAN has been<br />
complemented by the active role you have played in APEC. We<br />
both understand the contribution which APEC can make to the<br />
development of the broader Asia-Pacific region.<br />
As fellow members of the Cairns Group, we are also united in<br />
our appreciation of the need for a successful conclusion of<br />
the Uruguay Round,<br />
An open multilateral trading system with strong, clear rules<br />
covering all areas of international trade including<br />
agriculture is in our interest, just as it is in the<br />
interest of the other members of the GATT.<br />
In the post three years, our two countries have begun t6<br />
build a network of connections and institutional links which<br />
has given greater substance to our bilateral relationship.<br />
The hallzark of these growing connections has bean practical<br />
co-operation and substantive dialogue.<br />
Of particular importance has been the 1989 Timor Gap Zone of<br />
Co-operation Treaty, which establishes a system for joint<br />
exploitation of petroleum resources in the Timor Sea.<br />
Xn 2.989 our two countries also established the Australia<br />
Indonesia Institute in order to promote greater mutual<br />
unddrotanding, especially in the fields of culture and<br />
education. The growing web of bilateral connections has also been<br />
strengthened by the greatly increased numbers of ministerial<br />
visit. These substantive links have enabled our GovernmeUnts to<br />
maintain a frank and constructive dialogue, especially<br />
Hpi' I j 4j 140 V. L I r Q. L, k </p>
<p>4.<br />
during the past few montne, following the tragic events in<br />
East Timor last November.<br />
The signing of a number of bilateral agreements during my<br />
visit is an important demonstration of the sorts of l. inks<br />
which we would like to see developed.<br />
We are especially keen to expand bilateral commercial links,<br />
and to encourag e vur private sectors to take advantage of<br />
the opportunities created by the reform of our economies.<br />
Mr President, a hundred years ago, in what becaue known as a<br />
Golden Age, th. infant Australian nation forjel an identity<br />
and political system which still very largely defines us to<br />
ourselves and to the world.<br />
It was a reflection of the country's origins and the<br />
imperial values of the day that the identity and the system<br />
were often, in both spirit and substance, anti-Asian.<br />
In the 1990s I~ believe the AU~ tralian identity is being reshaped<br />
in a way which is consistent with the multicultural<br />
realiLy of our society, and the final paesing of the<br />
vestiges of our colonial past.<br />
Much will not be changed. Much we would defend AUjj<br />
change. But the new identity Will be emphatically different in this<br />
it will. positively. engage with the region in which we<br />
live.<br />
Mr President, it is my Toat sincere hope that we shall<br />
continue1 1U make our relationship broader$ deeper and more<br />
stable, in an important sense, each of us is the other's best test<br />
of how effectively we will be able to deal with -the social<br />
and political diversity, and the rapid change, which will<br />
mark our region and the world in the 1990s.<br />
My visit may be seen as a signal of Australia's<br />
determination to pass that test#<br />
Mr President, I am very glad to be here. I look forward to<br />
our discussions tozqorrow on important bilateral, regional<br />
and international 4evelopments.<br />
Your Excellencies, Distinc5Uished Guests, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen, I would now like to ask you to join me in a toast<br />
to the health of His Excellency the President and Mrs<br />
Soeharto, to the prosperity or the Republic of Indonesia,<br />
and to further progress in friendship and co-operation<br />
between our two nations. </p>
