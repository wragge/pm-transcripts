This morning Australians woke to the sad news that Pope Shenouda III, Patriarch of Coptic Orthodox Church, has died in Egypt overnight.</p>
<p>Pope Shenouda had served in religious life for sixty years. He was spiritual leader of his people for four decades.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, I offer my condolences to the Coptic community in this very sad hour. We know the eight million Coptic Christians in Egypt - and millions more worldwide - have lost their patriarch in a most difficult time in their history. </p>
<p>I also know the Australian Coptic community looks to events in Egypt with great anxiety for their fellow faithful and the holy places.</p>
<p>I want them to know today that the Copts of Egypt are not without friends in the world, or in Australia. </p>
