PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TOAST AT LUNCH IN LENINGRAD<br />
29' NOVEMBER 1987<br />
Mr Chairman<br />
Distinguished Representatives of the Leningrad Soviet<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Thank you for the welcoming remarks which you have addressed<br />
to me and to the members of the Australian party.<br />
It seems appropriate that my visit to the Soviet Union<br />
which I have been looking forward to immensely should<br />
begin in a city which has played so important a role in the<br />
history of relations between your country and the West.<br />
Among the many proud traditions of your city, its<br />
achievements as a cradle of culture, humanism and<br />
modernisation are conspicuous. Peter the Great's building<br />
of the city symnbolised his determination to build a modern<br />
state. Here the Decembrists struck the first blow for<br />
greater freedom and justice in Russia.<br />
Here your literary geniuses, Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky and<br />
Blok created works which crossed national boundaries to<br />
exercise a profound influence on the intellectual<br />
development of men and women throughout the world. Here<br />
Dmitri Shostakovich, whose name will always be linked with<br />
Leningrad, learned his art.<br />
Here was assembled one of the finest collections of European<br />
painting at the Hermitage which my wife, my party and I will<br />
be visiting with great interest this afternoon. From here<br />
many of your explorers set out on voyages of discovecy to<br />
distant lands, among them the great Miklukho Maclay, who<br />
visited Australia and carried out pioneering research in<br />
Papua New Guinea.<br />
In a word, your city became not just a great cultural centre<br />
but a centre of cultural exchange between Russia and the<br />
outside world. </p>
<p>2.<br />
am commencing my visit to the Soviet Union within weeks of<br />
the 70th anniversary of the Russian revolution, at a time<br />
implications not only for the peoples of the Soviet Union<br />
but potentially for the world.<br />
Clearly one aim of perestroika and glasnost is to open wider<br />
the window to the West. As such, they contain the promise<br />
of fundamental and sustained improvement in relations<br />
between East and West. much can be done to replace<br />
hostility with trust by promoting a freer exchange of ideas<br />
and freer contacts between peoples. The Australian<br />
Government welcomes the measures already taken by the Soviet<br />
Government in this historic process.<br />
we are gratified that Leningrad too is playing a role in<br />
these very positive developments. The works of the Nobel<br />
prize-winning Leningrad poet, Josif Brodsky, are to be<br />
published in the Soviet Union, though he is now resident in<br />
the West. Such decisions do much to enhance the reputation<br />
of the Soviet Union, and to build that trust which is the<br />
only firm foundation for a new era in East-West relations.<br />
This morning I laid a wreath at the cemetery where hundreds<br />
of thousands of victims of the tragic days of World War Two<br />
lie buried. I did so not only as a tribute to the enormous<br />
sacrifice of the people of Leningrad, but also to express<br />
the resolve shared by all of us that such a vast human<br />
tragedy must not be allowed to occur again..<br />
Mr Chairman<br />
In speaking of this splendid city Pushkin wrote of..<br />
" Peter's creation your severe, graceful appearance, the<br />
Neva's majestic current, the granite of her banks, the<br />
tracery of your cast-iron railings, the transparent<br />
twilight, the moonless gleam of your still nights We<br />
are privileged indeed to be shown Leningrad, of which you<br />
are so justly proud, and to enjoy your generous hospitality.<br />
I wish to thank you for this, and to propose a toast to you,<br />
Mr Chairman, and to the people of the hero-city of<br />
Leningrad. </p>
