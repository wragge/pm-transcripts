FOR PRESS NORTHERN TERRITORY DEVELOPMENT OF GOVE<br />
BAUXITE DEPOSITS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
Tne Prime Minister announced today that, following<br />
negotiations conducted by the Minister for National Development,<br />
Senator Sir William Spooner, and the Minister for Territories,<br />
Mr. Hasluck, the Government had approved the issuing of special<br />
mineral leases to the Gove Bauxite Corporation over bauxite<br />
deposits in the Gove Peninsula of Arnham Land, Northern<br />
Territory, The leases would be subject to conditions requiring<br />
the construction of an alumina plant with an annual capacity of<br />
not less than 500,000 tons. The plant, when completed, would<br />
cost in the vicinity of œ L45m., provide direct employment for<br />
about 800 operatives, support a population of about 3,000 and<br />
yield export income at the rate of œ 1241mo per anm-ajmo<br />
In this venture Gove Bauxite Corporation would be<br />
associated with the Pechiney Company of France, the largest<br />
producer of aluminium in E. arope and the fifth largest in the<br />
wcrldo In due course, on application, the leases would be<br />
transferred to an Australian subsidiary of Pechineyo<br />
The conditions of the leases, which cover an area of<br />
about 57 square miles and are for a period of 42 years, with<br />
a right of renewal, require the lesee to make an immediate<br />
stor;, on the mining and export of 10m, tons of bauxite and<br />
to carry it out within a period of 18 years. This operation,<br />
which will include the construction of a port, will involve<br />
an immediate expenditure of about œ 2-nm,<br />
The lessee will be required within three years after the<br />
granting of the leases to incur expenditure of not less than<br />
œ 300,000 in carrying out further exploration of the leased<br />
area and otherwise assessing the economic feasibility of<br />
the construction of an alumina plant of not less than 500,000<br />
tons annual capacity. The lessee will also be required to<br />
submit within three years after the granting of the leases a<br />
plan acceptable to the Government for the development of the<br />
leased areas, including the erection of the alumina plant and<br />
to complete such plant by the end of 1970o<br />
Failure to comply with these conditions render the<br />
leases liable to forfeiture.<br />
The Minister for Territories will accord the lessee<br />
ancillary rights to enable it to establish the facilities<br />
needed on its project such as harbour works and loading<br />
facilities, roads, railways, town site and to obtain its<br />
requirements of water, building materials, etc0 / 2 </p>
<p>S2<br />
Gove Bauxite Corporation Ltd. was granted a proOpecting<br />
right over the area in July, 1961, with the right to apply<br />
for leases if it proved the exsitence of sufficient bauxite<br />
to enable 10m. tons of bauxite to be mined for export and<br />
the existence of further deposits sufficient to justify<br />
consideration of the establishment of an alumina plant<br />
for treatment of the bauxite on the spot,<br />
The Corporation fulfilled its obligations under the<br />
permit within the stipulated time.<br />
The Prime Minister said that this project represented<br />
a further major step forward in the Government's efforts<br />
to develop the Northern Territoryo In addition to the<br />
direct employment providod by it,. its influence will<br />
extend to other sections of the Northern Territory economy.<br />
As the area over which mineral leases are to be<br />
granted falls within the Arnham Land aboriginal reserve,<br />
the bauxite mined will attract double the normal rate of<br />
royalty, the proceeds of which are to be paid into a trust<br />
fund for the general benefit of aborigines in the Torritory.<br />
The deposits covered by the leases referred to in<br />
this ctatement are in what is known as the " Gove Perimeter".<br />
An adjacent lease, Special Minerals Lease \ Nol, is at present<br />
held by British Aluminium<br />
