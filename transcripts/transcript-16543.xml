    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will provide more than $2.1 million towards the $2.5 million redevelopment of the Coronation Park Netball Complex in Minto.</p>
<p>The Complex supports up to 6,000 players and is often used for championship level competitions.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's investment will also support jobs in the community, with figures from Campbelltown City Council showing that the project will support about 60 jobs in construction, landscaping, plumbing and other repairs.</p>
<p>Federal funding is part of the Government's $800 million Community Infrastructure Program  -  the largest one-off investment in local infrastructure in Australia's history.</p>
<p>Through the Rudd Government's nation building economic stimulus package, we are investing in major projects like this to support local jobs and economies during the global recession.</p>
<p>The redevelopment will include:</p>
<p>     * Replacement of the grass court area with asphalt, relocation and enhancement of the children's playground area, and demolition of the existing 30 year old administration office and amenities block;</p>
<p>     * Construction of a new netball office administration building, including change room areas, meeting rooms, cool rooms, canteen and kitchen areas, offices, umpires rooms, amenities with disabled access, first aid rooms and baby change areas;</p>
<p>     * Redesign and installation of a new electricity substation, redesign and construction of the car park area;</p>
<p>     * Increase car spaces from 70 to 210 and provide a set-down area for buses and ambulances; and</p>
<p>     * Better entrance/exit roadways to improve flow of cars entering and exiting Redfern Road to provide easier, safer and more controlled access to the complex as well as set down areas for ambulances and buses.</p>
<p>This funding builds on $1.5 million that the Rudd Government has already delivered for 15 local projects in Campbelltown City this year. It brings our community infrastructure investment in Campbelltown to more than $3.6 million this year.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 per cent of the stimulus package is infrastructure with construction projects already underway. More than 3,000 projects are being funded through the Government's Community Infrastructure Program across Australia to support local jobs.</p>
