PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 13 OCfOBER 1978<br />
ABORIGINAL EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING<br />
The Prime Minister has written to State Premiers and to the<br />
Chief Minister of the Northern Territory concerning employment and<br />
training of Aboriginals.<br />
He has informed Premiers that, under the National Em-ployme nt<br />
Strategy for Aboriginals, Commonwealth Departments have been<br />
asked to renew efforts towards employing Aboriginals and<br />
identifying positions where an Aboriginal background could be a<br />
significant factor in the efficient performance of the jobs<br />
concerned.<br />
He has also said that the Commonwealth Department of Construction<br />
now requires tenderers, in areas where Aboriginals comprise a<br />
significant proportion of the population, to consult with the<br />
Department of Employment and Industrial Relations regarding the<br />
possibility of employing and training Aboriginals.<br />
The Prime Minister sought the cooperation of State Premiers and<br />
the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in promoting the<br />
employment of Aboriginals in State and local government.<br />
The Prime Minister asked the Premiers and Chief Minister to<br />
consider inserting a clause into specifications for State works<br />
similar to that for Commonwealth works and to consider giving the<br />
opportunities to contract for small-scale works being carried out<br />
in or adjacent to Aboriginal communities.<br />
With regard to training for Aboriginals, the Prime Minister said<br />
the Commonwealth Government was undertaking a review of all<br />
existing training schemes to assess their effectiveness and see<br />
if any new steps needed to be taken.<br />
He asked the Premiers and the Chief Minister to participate in<br />
the review of existing training schemes.<br />
The Prime Minister also asked the Premiers and the Chief Minister<br />
to examine the possibility of providing training opportunities,<br />
over and above normal departmental requirements, to enable<br />
Aboriginals to receive basic skills and work experience in a num-ber<br />
of areas. Commonwealth financial assistance under the<br />
National Employment and Training ( NEAT) Scheme would be available<br />
to fund. such training. </p>
