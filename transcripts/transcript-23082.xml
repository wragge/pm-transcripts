    <content><![CDATA[<p>I introduce the <em>Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013</em>.</p>
<p>The Australian people have already voted upon this Bill.</p>
<p>Now, the Parliament gets its chance.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the election was a referendum on the Carbon Tax.</p>
<p>The people have spoken.</p>
<p>Now, itâs up to this Parliament to show that itâs listened.</p>
<p>The Australian people have pronounced their judgment against the Carbon Tax: they want it gone and this bill delivers.</p>
<p>It delivers on the Coalitionâs commitment to the Australian people to scrap this toxic tax.</p>
<p>It is also, Madam Speaker, a cornerstone of the Governmentâs plan for a stronger economy built on lower taxes, less regulation and stronger businesses.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, repealing the carbon tax should be the first economic reform of this Parliament and it will be followed by further economic reforms: bills to repeal the mining tax, to restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission and to deal with Laborâs debt legacy.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the first impact of this bill will be on households whose overall costs will fall $550 a year on average.</p>
<p>Thanks to this bill, household electricity bills will be $200 lower next financial year without the Carbon Tax.</p>
<p>Household gas bills will be $70 lower next financial year without the Carbon Tax.</p>
<p>Prices for groceries, for household items and for services will also fall because the price of power is embedded in every price in our economy.</p>
<p>This is our bill to reduce your bills, to reduce the bills of the people of Australia.</p>
<p>When the price of power comes down, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be ready to ensure these price reductions are passed on to households and businesses.</p>
<p>But families and pensioners will keep the tax cuts and benefit increases already provided.</p>
<p>The Carbon Tax will go, but the carbon tax compensation will stay so that every Australian should be better off.</p>
<p>Repealing the Carbon Tax will reduce costs for all Australian businesses, every single one of them.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker the previous Government said and argued that only big business paid the Carbon Tax.</p>
<p>That simply wasnât true.Â  Every small business paid the Carbon Tax through higher electricity and gas bills and higher costs for supplies.</p>
<p>As well, Madam Speaker, the Carbon Tax acts as a reverse tariff.</p>
<p>Not only does the Carbon Tax make it more difficult for Australian businesses to compete abroad, it makes it more difficult for domestic businesses to compete at home â because there is no Carbon Tax on imports.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax removes over 1,000 pages of primary and subordinate legislation.</p>
<p>Repealing the Carbon Tax cuts the size of the climate change bureaucracy.</p>
<p>So, repealing the Carbon Tax will reduce the cost of living, make jobs more secure and improve the competitive position of our country.</p>
<p>Thatâs what it does: it reduces the cost of living, it makes jobs more secure and improves the competitive position of our country.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be against that, particularly when itâs what the Australian people have just voted for?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax is what the employers and what the jobs providers of our country want now.</p>
<p>The Business Council of Australia âsupports the wind-up of the current carbon pricing mechanism because it places excessive costs on business and households and because (our) carbon chargeâ¦is now one of the highest in the worldâ.</p>
<p>The carbon tax has ripped through the economy, hitting schools, hospitals, nursing homes, charities, churches, council swimming pools and community centres.</p>
<p>It has hit each and every group and each and every individual that uses power â and that was always its goal: to make electricity more expensive.</p>
<p>That was the intention of the previous government, to put power prices up because that was their way of reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The intention of the new government is to put power prices down by axing this toxic tax and by using other means to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>By reducing the cost of electricity and gas, we will help to make households better off, workers more secure and our economy stronger.</p>
<p>No one should be in any doubt â the Government is repealing the Carbon Tax in full.</p>
<p>We are not playing word games.</p>
<p>We are not playing tactical political games.</p>
<p>We are doing what we were elected to do.</p>
<p>Others have said they would terminate the Carbon Tax, but they were only renaming it.</p>
<p>Well, Madam Speaker, we are not renaming it.</p>
<p>We are not floating it.</p>
<p>We are not keeping the machinery in place so we can dust it off in the future.</p>
<p>We are abolishing the Carbon Tax in full.</p>
<p>We have said what we mean and we will do what we say â the Carbon Tax goes. It goes.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax at the end of the financial year provides certainty for business and it simplifies the transition.</p>
<p>It means that this Government will not be proceeding with the previous Governmentâs legislated Carbon Tax increase that would have taken effect from the 1st of July next year.</p>
<p>As well, Laborâs Carbon Tax changes for the on-road fuel costs of heavy vehicles that were going to commence on the 1st of July 2014 will not happen.</p>
<p>That saves consumers the previous Governmentâs planned increase in the price of everything that had to be trucked around the country.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the new Government cannot undo the past, we can only make the future better â and that is what we intend to do.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, under this Government, the Carbon Tax will not apply from 1 July so there will be no need for further compensation packages.</p>
<p>We will end the merry-go-round of Carbon Tax industry assistance that takes from one pocket and puts less back in the other.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we will ensure that the benefits of repealing the Carbon Tax are passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>The ACCC will have further powers to take action against any business that engages in price exploitation in relation to the Carbon Tax repeal.</p>
<p>Penalties of up to $1.1 million for corporations and $220,000 for individuals will apply.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Government is repealing the Carbon Tax because there is a less complicated and less costly way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions â a way that will actually reduce emissions and wonât damage the economy.</p>
<p>The Government will scrap the Carbon Tax and then proceed with its Direct Action Plan.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the Direct Action Plan will be the Emissions Reduction Fund â a market-based mechanism for reducing carbon dioxide emissions; a Fund which provides a powerful and direct additional incentive for businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Fund will use positive incentives to reduce Australiaâs emissions.</p>
<p>Direct Action through the Fund means more trees, better soils and smarter technology and this is the right way to get emissions down.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Carbon Tax is a $9 billion hit on the economy this year alone.</p>
<p>It is a $9 billion burden on jobs, a $9 billion burden on investment and a $9 billion burden on Australia that we just donât need.</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, this bill gets rid of it.</p>
<p>This bill is the Governmentâs Bill to reduce peopleâs bills and I so commend this bill to the House.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
