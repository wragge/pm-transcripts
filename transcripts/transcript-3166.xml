PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 190<br />
February 1974<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THEL PRIME MINISTER, MR. WHITLAM,<br />
THE PREMIER OF WESTERA AUSTRALIA, MR. TONKIN, AND<br />
THE LORD MAYOR OF PERT+-, I! R. LEE-STEERE<br />
New planning proposals for part of the central area of<br />
Perth were announced today by the Prime Minist-er Mr. Whitlam,<br />
the Premier of Western Australia, Mr. Tonkin and the Lord<br />
Mayor of Perth, Mr. Lee-Steere.<br />
The imaginative proposals envisage extensive changes<br />
to the appearance and character of the city.<br />
They involve:-<br />
re-planning and widening of Forrest Place;<br />
a new Administrative Centre in Forrest Place for<br />
the Australian Post Office;<br />
re-development and landscaping of the central railway<br />
area; integration of the Cultural Centre north of the<br />
railway line with the central railway area.<br />
The proposals regarding Forrest Place are the result of<br />
agreement between the Australian and State Governments and representatives<br />
of the Perth City Council. The other two proposals do not<br />
involve the Australian Government.<br />
All four proposals have been incorporated in an overall<br />
plan which has been submitted to Cabinet by the Perth Central Area<br />
Design Co-ordinating Committee after receiving an interim report<br />
from its consultant, Professor Gordon Stephenson.<br />
The proposals were considered by State Cabinet at its<br />
meeting on Tuesday. / 2 </p>
<p>-2 described<br />
The new concept for Forrest Place is/ in the following<br />
joint st-tement. A new plaza will be created in Forrest Place, Perth.<br />
In addition, the Australian Post Office proposes to construct<br />
a new Administrative Centre adjacent to the existing Perth G. P. O.<br />
The two developments will be made possible by an exchange of land<br />
between the Australian Government and the Perth City Council.<br />
The Prime minister promised the creation of the new<br />
Forrest Place Plaza at an election meeting in Forres. Place shortly<br />
before the 1972 Federal elections.<br />
The West-. Australian Government has. active ' ly supported the<br />
proposal in negotiations over the transfer of land. The Australian<br />
Government will transfer to the City Council the land on which<br />
Padbury Building now stands and the building will be demolished.<br />
Forrest Place will be widened and public space will be<br />
increased significant ' ly. This will transform Forrest Place into a<br />
public pedestrian plaza enclosed at the northern end by the proposed<br />
Post Office Administrative Centre.<br />
The new building will protect the plaza from winds while not<br />
preventing a desirable amount of air circulation and sun penetration.<br />
The Administrative Centre will be designed to enable vistas<br />
from within the plaza at ground and first floor level to the Perth<br />
Cultural Centre.<br />
The old Central Hotel structure,' will be demolished as well as<br />
the Padbury Building and the new Administrative Centre will be erected<br />
on part of these sites and part of the northern section of Forrest<br />
Place. The Administrative Centre will enable a centralisation of<br />
many now scattered elements of Perth's postal and telephone services.<br />
It will be sited across the northern end of Forrest Place with two<br />
extra floors at the western end. This will enable it to achieve<br />
harmony with the existing G. P. O. building which will remain.<br />
Subject to the approval of the Australian Parliament, the<br />
Administrative Centre could be operational early in 1979. State and<br />
Civic authorities propose an elevated pedestrian way linking Hay Street<br />
and the Cultural Centre.<br />
This will traverse the eastern side of the plaza, pass through<br />
the new Administrative Centre and cross Wellington Street.<br />
The re-development of the Forrest Place area follows a<br />
feasibility study carried out by a local firm of architects and town<br />
planning consultants. The study commission by the Australian<br />
Department of Housing and Construction was carried out in conjunction<br />
with State and City planning authorities. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
We believe that the re-development will materially<br />
enhance the environment of Forrest Place and will complement<br />
conceptual plans of the State Government and the Perth City<br />
Council for the development of the " heart of Perth".<br />
The Administrative Centre will also provide services of<br />
benefit to the community in Perth.<br />
The Premier, Mr. Tonkin said that two models and plans<br />
showing the proposals would go on public exhibition in the<br />
R. and I. Bank, Barrack Street, Perth, on Thursday morning.<br />
