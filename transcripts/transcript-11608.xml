    <content><![CDATA[<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard of Australia and Prime Minister Jenny Shipley</p>
<p> of New Zealand met in New Zealand in February 1999 for annual discussions</p>
<p> on a range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues.</p>
<p>As a consequence of those discussions and of a mutual desire further</p>
<p> to develop the bilateral economic partnership, Prime Ministers agreed</p>
<p> to establish a Joint Task Force on Bilateral Economic Relations under</p>
<p> the direction of their Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The</p>
<p> Task Force was to address a small number of specific bilateral issues</p>
<p> and to examine ways of building on the already strong economic foundations</p>
<p> of CER. Prime Ministers agreed that the specific bilateral issues would</p>
<p> include:</p>
<p> . barriers and costs to trans-Tasman investment;</p>
<p> . conclusion of negotiations on a bilateral child support</p>
<p> arrangement; and</p>
<p> . revision of the bilateral Social Security Agreement.</p>
<p>On 4 August 1999, after receiving the report of the Task Force, Prime</p>
<p> Ministers Howard and Shipley issued a Joint Communique announcing the</p>
<p> results of the Task Force's work and an agreed program of future action.</p>
<p> In order to ensure the efficient implementation of the work program, Australia's</p>
<p> Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and New Zealand's Ministry</p>
<p> of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), in consultation with the two Departments</p>
<p> of Prime Minister and Cabinet, were to provide Prime Ministers with a</p>
<p> joint progress report before their next bilateral meeting.</p>
<p>This report is intended to meet that requirement. Its structure mirrors</p>
<p> the structure of the communique. Extracts from the communique appear in</p>
<p> bold italics and are followed by comments</p>
<p> on progress in implementing the measures agreed by Prime Ministers.</p>
<p>Closer Economic Relations (CER)</p>
<p>"The main focus of both our nations' trade policies is currently</p>
<p> on securing further trade liberalisation through a new WTO round and we</p>
<p> are working cooperatively to promote its launch at the WTO Ministerial</p>
<p> meeting to be held in November in Seattle.</p>
<p>"New Zealand and Australia are willing to consider free trade arrangements</p>
<p> with other significant individual economies or regional groupings, where</p>
<p> they would deliver faster and deeper liberalisation than the multilateral</p>
<p> process, with the objective of gaining better market access for our exporters,</p>
<p> faster economic growth and stronger employment growth. Such arrangements</p>
<p> would need to reflect the principles underpinning CER, including WTO consistency."</p>
<p>Global trade liberalisation</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have continued to work very closely in various</p>
<p> international fora, including the WTO, APEC and the Cairns Group, to secure</p>
<p> our shared trade liberalisation objectives, particularly in the area of</p>
<p> agriculture. Australian and New Zealand delegations consulted closely</p>
<p> in the lead up to, and at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle from</p>
<p> 30 November to 3 December 1999. Following the failure at Seattle to launch</p>
<p> a new round of WTO trade negotiations, Ministers and officials are continuing</p>
<p> to consult closely on the best way to move forward on the earliest possible</p>
<p> launch of a round and on other shared objectives such as progress on the</p>
<p> mandated negotiations in agriculture and services.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the priority we give to the launch of a new multilateral</p>
<p> round of trade negotiations, both countries remain open to the possibility</p>
<p> of concluding free trade agreements with other countries or regional groupings</p>
<p> where these could be expected to deliver substantial economic gains which</p>
<p> could not be achieved elsewhere within a similar timeframe.</p>
<p>Both governments will seek, through negotiations in the WTO, to multilateralise</p>
<p> progress made in regional trade liberalisation. Australia and New Zealand</p>
<p> will take this up in the forthcoming mandated negotiations on agriculture</p>
<p> and services notwithstanding the lack of agreement in Seattle to a new</p>
<p> round of trade negotiations.</p>
<p>AFTA/CER Task Force</p>
<p>In Singapore on 1 October 1999, CER and ASEAN trade and economic ministers</p>
<p> agreed to establish an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) / CER High Level Task</p>
<p> Force to explore the feasibility of an AFTA-CER free trade area by 2010.</p>
<p> The Task Force has been asked to submit a set of recommendations, including</p>
<p> on the scope and coverage of a possible FTA and to outline the requirements</p>
<p> an FTA would have to meet if it was to be consistent with Article XXIV</p>
<p> of the GATT and Article V of the GATS.</p>
<p>The Rt Hon Sir William Birch GNZM and the Hon Tim Fischer MP have been</p>
<p> appointed to represent New Zealand and Australia respectively. The Task</p>
<p> Force members met in Jakarta on 8-9 February. The second Task Force meeting</p>
<p> will be in New Zealand on 27-28 April and a third meeting is planned for</p>
<p> September. There were useful discussions between Task Force members in</p>
<p> Jakarta in February and positive progress was made. The feasibility study</p>
<p> will be completed in time to be considered at the next meeting of ASEAN</p>
<p> economic and CER trade ministers in Thailand in October 2000.</p>
<p>Pacific Regional Trade Agreement (PARTA)</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are also consulting closely with the Forum</p>
<p> island countries regarding the establishment of a Pacific Regional Trade</p>
<p> Agreement following the decision by leaders at the South Pacific Forum</p>
<p> meeting in Palau on 5 October 1999 to negotiate a free trade agreement</p>
<p> between Forum Member countries. The manner in which Australia and New Zealand</p>
<p> are to be included in the Agreement is under discussion and will be resolved</p>
<p> through the negotiation process. Australia and New Zealand met in Wellington</p>
<p> in January 2000 to discuss a joint approach to PARTA negotiations, and</p>
<p> will participate in a pre-negotiations workshop in Suva on 29-30 March.</p>
<p>New Zealand work on free trade agreement (FTA) prospects</p>
<p>New Zealand has begun negotiation of a bilateral FTA with Singapore,</p>
<p> started work on a Republic of Korea/New Zealand Study and is giving consideration</p>
<p> to work in 2000 on an agreed study of an FTA among Singapore, Chile and</p>
<p> New Zealand. New Zealand is keeping Australia closely informed of progress</p>
<p> and the option is open for Australia to associate itself with this work,</p>
<p> which proceeds in the context of our shared commitment to multilateral</p>
<p> trade liberalisation.</p>
<p>Investment</p>
<p>"Australia has reviewed its foreign investment requirements in line</p>
<p> with its APEC Individual Action Plan and will liberalise its foreign investment</p>
<p> regime. The changes will lower compliance costs for all foreign investors</p>
<p> and provide benefits for New Zealand.</p>
<p>"Australia will:</p>
<p>. increase its existing foreign investment business acquisition threshold</p>
<p> from $A5 million ($A3 million for rural) to $A50 million on a multilateral</p>
<p> basis;</p>
<p>. remove foreign investment approval requirements for New Zealanders</p>
<p> who hold or are entitled to hold a special category visa and invest</p>
<p> in Australian residential real estate through Australian registered</p>
<p> companies and trusts; and</p>
<p>. provide simplified processing arrangements for proposals to invest</p>
<p> in businesses, valued at less than $A100 million, on a multilateral</p>
<p> basis."</p>
<p>Amendments to the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulations</p>
<p> 1989, giving effect to the first two measures (above), entered</p>
<p> into force on 10 September 1999. The third measure was implemented by</p>
<p> changes to administrative arrangements on the same day. These three measures</p>
<p> together provide a simpler and more efficient framework for New Zealanders</p>
<p> wishing to invest in Australia.</p>
<p>Additional Australian measures</p>
<p>Consistent with this approach, the Australian Government has also made</p>
<p> the following changes to foreign investment policy:</p>
<p> . The voluntary notification threshold for the Australian</p>
<p> assets of an offshore company to be acquired by another offshore company</p>
<p> has been increased from $20 million to $50 million.</p>
<p>. Acquisitions of residential real estate by Australian permanent</p>
<p> resident visa holders, not ordinarily resident in Australia, purchasing</p>
<p> through Australian companies or trusts has been exempted from notification</p>
<p> requirements;</p>
<p> . Australian citizens and their foreign spouses purchasing</p>
<p> as joint tenants are no longer required to seek approval for purchases</p>
<p> of residential property in Australia.</p>
<p> . The acquisition of house and land packages, where construction</p>
<p> has not commenced, is no longer limited to fifty per cent of the project's</p>
<p> sales. Approval is conditional on continuous construction of the relevant</p>
<p> dwelling commencing within twelve months.</p>
<p> . Where properties are not subject to heritage listing, the</p>
<p> notification threshold applying to the acquisition of developed non-residential</p>
<p> commercial properties has been raised from $5 million to $50 million.</p>
<p> . Acquisitions of developed non-residential commercial properties,</p>
<p> valued between the notification threshold and $100 million, are no</p>
<p> longer subject to detailed examination, unless the facts of the proposal</p>
<p> raise issues pertaining to the national interest.</p>
<p> . The policy of designating Integrated Tourism Resorts (ITRs),</p>
<p> within which foreign persons are permitted to acquire residential</p>
<p> property without restriction, now applies only to developed residential</p>
<p> property which is leased back to the resort operator, to be available</p>
<p> for tourist accommodation when not occupied by the owner. Owners of</p>
<p> residential property in existing ITRs have retained their entitlements.</p>
<p> . An exemption is now obtainable for the acquisition by foreign</p>
<p> interests of strata-titled hotel rooms in designated hotels where</p>
<p> each room is subject to a long-term (10 years or more) hotel management</p>
<p> arrangement.</p>
<p> . An exemption now exists for the acquisition of interests</p>
<p> in Australian urban land by foreign-owned responsible entities acting</p>
<p> on behalf of managed unit trusts and other managed public investment</p>
<p> schemes registered under Chapter 5C of the Australian Corporations</p>
<p> Law, where they are investing for the benefit of fund investors</p>
<p> or unit holders ordinarily resident in Australia. This is consistent</p>
<p> with rules applying to foreign-owned life insurers and superannuation</p>
<p> funds.</p>
<p>"For its part, New Zealand will raise the threshold at which consent</p>
<p> for non-land foreign investment is required from $NZ10 million to $NZ50</p>
<p> million, on a multilateral basis. The criteria for land-related foreign</p>
<p> investment will remain unchanged."</p>
<p>In New Zealand, regulations entered into force on 9 December 1999 which</p>
<p> raised the threshold at which consent for non-land foreign investment</p>
<p> is required from NZ$10 million to NZ$50 million.</p>
<p>"Australia and New Zealand will consult each other on our respective</p>
<p> foreign investment policies in the context of any specific review of those</p>
<p> policies under our international obligations."</p>
<p>Since the communique was issued, there has been no review of Australian</p>
<p> or New Zealand foreign investment policies under our international obligations.</p>
<p> No such review is currently scheduled.</p>
<p>Should either party undertake such a review, it will consult the other</p>
<p> party as required by the communique.</p>
<p>Social security</p>
<p>"New Zealand and Australia both want more stable and durable social</p>
<p> security arrangements that will provide a better strategic fit for our</p>
<p> wider CER relationship, both now and as it develops in future years. As</p>
<p> part of this, Australia and New Zealand:</p>
<p>. will undertake a full review of social security arrangements, with</p>
<p> a view to developing a sustainable long-term solution to current problems.</p>
<p> We expect that terms of reference will be settled before our next</p>
<p> meeting, in February 2000. We further expect to start putting in place</p>
<p> the changes in arrangements stemming from the review before the Prime</p>
<p> Ministerial meeting in February 2001; and</p>
<p>. will implement an interim arrangement for 2 years that will markedly</p>
<p> simplify the current complex and overly cumbersome administrative</p>
<p> arrangements by simply agreeing the reimbursement track in advance,</p>
<p> and provide for a higher level of reimbursement of the social security</p>
<p> costs incurred by Australia over that period than that provided for</p>
<p> under the current Agreement. Specifically, we have agreed that New</p>
<p> Zealand will reimburse Australia $A125m for the year 1999/2000 and</p>
<p> $A135m for the year 2000/2001 for the costs of providing social security</p>
<p> to New Zealand citizens in Australia. This interim agreement, including</p>
<p> increased reimbursement, will continue until it can be replaced by</p>
<p> a new Social Security Agreement."</p>
<p>Review of social security arrangements</p>
<p>Officials from New Zealand and Australia met in Wellington on 17-18 February</p>
<p> to finalise the terms of reference for the review of social security arrangements</p>
<p> and discuss arrangements for conducting the review. It was agreed that</p>
<p> the review was to be completed with a final report to be presented to</p>
<p> Governments by 30 June 2000, with a view to both countries agreeing on</p>
<p> and starting to implement the changes in arrangements stemming from the</p>
<p> review before the prime ministerial meeting in 2001. The terms of reference</p>
<p> for the review are attached to this report.</p>
<p>Interim arrangements</p>
<p>An exchange of notes implementing the interim reimbursement arrangements</p>
<p> agreed by Prime Ministers was completed and came into force on 25</p>
<p> October 1999. The interim arrangement operates with effect from 1 July</p>
<p> 1999 and will remain in force until the entry into force of a revised</p>
<p> bilateral Social Security Agreement. The reimbursement amounts agreed</p>
<p> by Prime Ministers will be applied for the years 1999/2000 and 2000/2001.</p>
<p> If the interim arrangements remain in force after 30 June 2001, the reimbursement</p>
<p> paid by New Zealand to Australia will be derived in accordance with the</p>
<p> terms of the communique. A forecasting model which will underpin determination</p>
<p> of the reimbursement amount is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Child Support</p>
<p>"Australia and New Zealand have been developing a draft Child Support</p>
<p> Agreement (CSA) to promote more equitable payment arrangements for New</p>
<p> Zealand and Australian parents. We have agreed that the CSA should be</p>
<p> implemented at the earliest opportunity, with operation commencing from</p>
<p> 1 July 2000."</p>
<p>The proposed bilateral child support arrangements comprise two agreements,</p>
<p> a principal Child Support Agreement (CSA) and a service arrangement. The</p>
<p> principal agreement provides for the establishment and enforcement of</p>
<p> child and spousal maintenance liabilities by each country. The final text</p>
<p> of the Agreement was agreed between Australian and New Zealand Child Support</p>
<p> Agencies during February 2000 and is due to be signed in March 2000. Discussions</p>
<p> on the Service Arrangement are still proceeding and it is envisaged that</p>
<p> these will be completed and the Arrangement signed in April/May 2000.</p>
<p>Implementing the CSA in Australia</p>
<p>The agreements will come into force in Australia following amendments</p>
<p> to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the</p>
<p> Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Family Law Act 1975.</p>
<p> The agreements are also subject to the Commonwealth's treaty review process,</p>
<p> including scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties</p>
<p> (JSCOT). Subject always to Parliamentary and JSCOT approval, Australia's</p>
<p> procedural arrangements for the entry into force of the Child Support</p>
<p> Agreement by 1 July 2000 are on track.</p>
<p>Implementing the CSA in New Zealand</p>
<p>The Agreement is to be given effect in New Zealand by Order in Council.</p>
<p> It will enter into force 30 days after New Zealand and Australia have</p>
<p> notified each other that respective domestic implementation processes</p>
<p> are complete. Therefore, domestic processes in New Zealand (and Australia)</p>
<p> will have to be concluded before 1 June.</p>
<p>Business law</p>
<p>"We have agreed to explore the scope for further regulatory coordination</p>
<p> of our respective regimes and have agreed that any further reform would</p>
<p> need to take account not just of CER but also of the broader regional</p>
<p> and global environments, including the emergence of global standards.</p>
<p>"A study has been commissioned by New Zealand on possible approaches</p>
<p> to further trans-Tasman business law reform, having regard to our objective</p>
<p> of positioning Australian and New Zealand business on the world stage.</p>
<p> Officials will hold discussions on the study in August, with a view to</p>
<p> identifying possible areas for further regulatory coordination.</p>
<p>"As part of this process, New Zealand and Australia will give specific</p>
<p> consideration to:</p>
<p>. cross-recognising trans-Tasman companies through a simplified registration</p>
<p> mechanism;</p>
<p>. issues related to the regulation of overseas financial products</p>
<p> markets which are adequately supervised; and</p>
<p>. cross-border insolvency, in particular, the adoption of the UNCITRAL</p>
<p> Model Law</p>
<p>"Australia recently announced that it would reform its disclosure</p>
<p> requirements for financial products (other than securities). These reforms</p>
<p> are similar in approach to New Zealand's existing regime. In implementing</p>
<p> the reforms, Australia will harmonise its requirements with New Zealand's,</p>
<p> to the greatest extent possible consistent with its policy framework,</p>
<p> to reduce compliance costs and help facilitate the offering of common</p>
<p> products in both countries."</p>
<p>Officials from the New Zealand Ministry of Commerce and the Australian</p>
<p> Treasury met in New Zealand in August 1999 with a view to identifying</p>
<p> possible areas for further regulatory coordination and to consider implementation</p>
<p> of other business law aspects of the communique programme.</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding</p>
<p>Officials have agreed to review and modernise the 1988 Memorandum of</p>
<p> Understanding (MOU) on the Harmonisation of Business Laws, and are working</p>
<p> to produce a new MOU for signature by Ministers by early 2000. The MOU</p>
<p> will reflect the desire of both countries to reduce business compliance</p>
<p> costs, increase trans-Tasman competition and reflect the increasing importance</p>
<p> of a global approach to business laws. It will recognise that business</p>
<p> law harmonisation will not necessarily develop identical laws but should</p>
<p> work towards complementary systems which are capable of resolving any</p>
<p> differences which may act as barriers to trade and investment.</p>
<p>Cross-recognition</p>
<p>Substantial work has already been done on the issue of cross-recognition</p>
<p> of trans-Tasman companies. New Zealand officials are preparing a review</p>
<p> paper which will discuss options for taking the issue forward. A specific</p>
<p> proposal for cross-recognition will be considered by officials in the</p>
<p> first half of 2000, with a view to decision by respective Ministers in</p>
<p> the second half of 2000.</p>
<p>Recognition of overseas financial products markets</p>
<p>Australia is developing the necessary statutory framework to support</p>
<p> recognition of overseas markets which are subject to comparable regulation</p>
<p> as part of its proposed Financial Services and Markets legislation being</p>
<p> developed under the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. Both countries</p>
<p> are also undertaking further work on comparing their respective disclosure</p>
<p> regimes for financial products, so as to be in a position to assess the</p>
<p> scope for achieving a mutual recognition of disclosure regimes by. As</p>
<p> part of this work, New Zealand has prepared a paper on the New Zealand</p>
<p> disclosure regime for financial products, which is currently being considered</p>
<p> by Australian officials.</p>
<p>Cross-border insolvency</p>
<p>Officials have considered cross-border insolvency issues with a view</p>
<p> to adoption of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law</p>
<p> (UNCITRAL) Model Law on cross-border insolvency. While it may be possible</p>
<p> to go further than the Model Law in relation to trans-Tasman cooperation</p>
<p> on cross-border insolvency matters a number of differences in the way</p>
<p> insolvency administrations are conducted in each country (eg. licensing</p>
<p> of liquidators) still need to be addressed. Officials will ensure that</p>
<p> trans-Tasman harmonisation is considered in the context of future policy</p>
<p> development, with a view to developing a harmonised cross-border insolvency</p>
<p> regime for consideration by respective governments.</p>
<p>Customs</p>
<p>"Our respective Customs agencies have been addressing harmonisation</p>
<p> and simplification issues within CER for some time, and have made considerable</p>
<p> progress. This work will be accelerated, with the objective of: improving</p>
<p> facilitation of trans-Tasman trade by streamlining customs regulatory</p>
<p> procedures; reducing customs compliance costs for trans-Tasman business;</p>
<p> and introducing 'one-stop shop' on-line customs clearance procedures for</p>
<p> agreed trans-Tasman exporters. Officials will implement an agreed work</p>
<p> programme which includes specific milestones for the next year.</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand customs agencies will also look closely at</p>
<p> the information presently required from importers and exporters, with</p>
<p> a view to investigating ways of appropriately reducing business compliance</p>
<p> costs."</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand customs services, in consultation with relevant</p>
<p> national agencies, have continued to cooperate on the development of measures</p>
<p> to further harmonise customs procedures and reduce compliance costs for</p>
<p> business, consistent with the pre-existing 25 May 1999 "Trans-Tasman</p>
<p> Cargo Management Statement of Intent". This work has been accelerated</p>
<p> as follows:</p>
<p>Compliance costs</p>
<p>Business compliance costs will be reduced as a consequence of Australia's</p>
<p> cargo management re-engineering program, likely to be completed by mid-2001.</p>
<p> The program aims to reduce by at least 30 per cent the amount of information</p>
<p> required for export/import transactions and will provide the necessary</p>
<p> basis for a trans-Tasman internet-based system for customs reporting.</p>
<p>"One-stop shop"</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are evaluating possibilities for establishing</p>
<p> partnerships with strategic industry partners involving periodic Customs</p>
<p> entries and deferred payment of duty. Using methodology developed by Australian</p>
<p> Customs, New Zealand had initiated a trial of partnerships for exports</p>
<p> in August 1998, prior to the Prime Ministers' 1999 meeting. Draft business</p>
<p> rules for accredited clients and an independent audit framework are now</p>
<p> being developed by Australia with a view to an Australian program commencing</p>
<p> by end 2000. The objective in the medium term is to include Australian</p>
<p> and New Zealand traders in this program to facilitate development of a</p>
<p> system of "cross recognition" for each other's audit and compliance</p>
<p> regimes to facilitate cargo clearance. Information on respective compliance</p>
<p> regimes has been exchanged by the two customs services.</p>
<p>Streamlining procedures</p>
<p>A preliminary examination of each country's data requirements has been</p>
<p> undertaken and an analysis of the potential for harmonising our respective</p>
<p> data collection systems is underway. Much will depend on similar work</p>
<p> underway within the G7. This G7 work will be presented to Heads of State</p>
<p> at the next G7 Summit in June 2000 and was analysed by trans-Tasman customs</p>
<p> services in consultation with other relevant agencies. A draft comparison</p>
<p> of Australian and New Zealand Customs import and export data was passed</p>
<p> to New Zealand by Australian Customs in August 1999 and the subsequent</p>
<p> New Zealand analysis is now under consideration by Australian Customs.</p>
<p> This consideration will be completed by 29 February 2000. The customs</p>
<p> agencies propose to publish their analysis by the end of August 2000.</p>
<p>A revised tariff concept paper, which examines the potential for amalgamating</p>
<p> the two countries' tariff functions, was sent by New Zealand Customs to</p>
<p> Australian Customs on 2 September 1999 and is now the subject of</p>
<p> an extensive work program involving several Australian agencies. As a</p>
<p> first step Australian and New Zealand Customs have identified over 500</p>
<p> differences in their respective tariffs. As the next stage in this process</p>
<p> Australian Customs is now identifying goods and classes of goods where</p>
<p> these differences occur. It is expected that this information will be</p>
<p> sent to New Zealand Customs by the end of March 2000. New Zealand is examining</p>
<p> the possibility of adopting Australia's Tariff and Precedent Information</p>
<p> Network (TAPIN) tariff database system, which examination is due to be</p>
<p> completed by 29 February 2000.</p>
<p>A New Zealand proposal to adopt a shared threshold for customs duty on</p>
<p> imports is also being considered by Australia in the context of new tax</p>
<p> system which will be implemented on 1 July 2000.</p>
<p>Oceans management</p>
<p>"New Zealand and Australia will conclude an agreement on the delimitation</p>
<p> of the Australian and New Zealand maritime zones by no later than 2003</p>
<p> ï­ one to three years ahead of our respective deadlines for submissions</p>
<p> on the limits of our continental shelves to the United Nations.</p>
<p>"New Zealand and Australia will continue to work cooperatively in</p>
<p> the development of the Trans-Tasman Understanding on Oceans Policy to</p>
<p> ensure it results in mutual and complementary approaches to the protection</p>
<p> and development or our marine resources.</p>
<p>"Australia will also involve New Zealand in the development of a</p>
<p> Regional Marine Plan for the South-eastern region of Australia's Exclusive</p>
<p> Economic Zone (EEZ) in relation to issues of joint interest."</p>
<p>Maritime delimitation</p>
<p>Both sides plan for substantive bilateral discussions on maritime delimitation</p>
<p> to begin by October 2000, as the first stage of a programme designed to</p>
<p> enable formal bilateral agreement by 2003 as agreed.</p>
<p>Oceans policies</p>
<p>The Australian Government released Australia's Oceans Policy in</p>
<p> December 1998. In October 1999, the New Zealand Government announced that</p>
<p> it will develop an integrated Oceans Policy. New Zealand officials have</p>
<p> begun early work on this, welcoming the useful material contained in the</p>
<p> Australian policy document, and will continue discussions with Australian</p>
<p> counterparts during the development of the policy.</p>
<p>As the New Zealand Oceans Policy is developed, the Trans-Tasman Understanding</p>
<p> on Oceans Planning and Management will, correspondingly, be progressively</p>
<p> developed to ensure complementary approaches to oceans management. The</p>
<p> Understanding will be developed through the Australian and New Zealand</p>
