FOR PRESS: DUKE OF EDINBURGH TO BE PATRON<br />
Statement by Sir Ian McLenanhairman ofLhe Executive Committee<br />
of the Ian Cu :; cxs Momjoiial Foundation<br />
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh has accepted<br />
the invitation of the Ian Clunies Ross Memorial Foundation to<br />
become its Patron.<br />
The Ian Clunies Ross Memorial Foundation was established<br />
in 1959 as a non-profit organisation to honour the memory of the<br />
late Sir Ian Clunies Ross, D. VoSco, Honorary LLODo<br />
( Melbourne), FoA. A. who was Chairman of the C. SJI. RoO. from 1949<br />
until his death in June, 1959.<br />
His life had been one of outstanding service to Australia,<br />
The first project of the Foundation is the building of<br />
a National Science Centre in Melbourne, This will provide office<br />
accommodation for the scientific and technological societies, a<br />
number of which have their national headquarters in Melbourne. It<br />
will also provide an auditorium and smaller meeting rooms for<br />
lectures exhibitions, committee meetings and other gatherings<br />
of scientists, By supporting the work of the societies in this<br />
way, it is hoped to strengthen considerably the Australian<br />
scientific community.<br />
A site at 187-195 Royal Parade, Parkville ( Melbourne)<br />
has been purchased for a sum of œ 50,000. This is admirably suited<br />
to the purposes of the Foundation since it is close to the city,<br />
opposite the University of Melbourne and in an area where there are<br />
a number of other scientific and technological bodies, It is also<br />
in an area where car parking will not present difficulties. The<br />
Governors have appointed Messrs. Godfrey Spowers, Hughes, Mewton<br />
and Lobb, as architects for Clunies Ross Housu, and have given their<br />
general approval to preliminary sketch plans for a building. The<br />
ground floor will be devoted to auditorium and meeting rooms and<br />
the upper floors to the societies' offices.<br />
As a result of a campaign for funds conducted on a<br />
national basis, a sum of œ 242,000 has so far been received and a<br />
further sum of œ 42,000 promised. The Governors of the Foundation<br />
are confident that it will be possible to raise more money for the<br />
purposes of the Foundation and negotiations are at present being<br />
undertaken with several possible sources of fuuids. Final details<br />
of the building will not be decided until the Foundationts<br />
financial resources are more accurately known, but it is hoped<br />
that it will be possible to call tenders and start building<br />
operations during 1964,<br />
Although the Foundation's first project is the establishment<br />
of the National Science Centre in Melbourne, it plans to work<br />
in all States. At present negotiations are in hand for opening an<br />
office of the Foundation in Brisbane.<br />
CANBERRA, 23rd January, 1964.<br />

Mr. G. B. Uresford, Secretary of the Ian Clunies Ross Memorial<br />
Foundation, 314 Albert Street, East Melbourne. Telephone 41.6611.<br />
