    <content><![CDATA[<p>On this day seventy years ago, Japan surrendered unconditionally and our then Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, declared: The war is over.</p>
<p>Cities and towns across the country erupted in celebration as people flocked to sing, dance, wave flags and light bonfires.</p>
<p>Men, women and children shared the relief and elation of a nation.</p>
<p>Today, in awe and in gratitude, we honour a generation that fought for freedom and prevailed.</p>
<p>Almost a million Australians served in the Second World War. Some 40,000 gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny.</p>
<p>They served with courage alongside our Allies, and today we especially honour the unbreakable bond with the United States that was forged in the Pacific theatre.</p>
<p>Together, and at great cost, our parents and grandparents won the war that defined their time.</p>
<p>Together, and with great resolve, they built a peace that endures to this day.</p>
<p>We thank them for conquering an evil that may otherwise have flourished.</p>
<p>We thank them for defending the free and democratic Australia we so cherish today.</p>
<p>To all who served in our name, we owe a debt of gratitude that can never fully be repaid.</p>
<p>You stood for what is right and good and decent when it mattered most, and our world is a better place because of you.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
