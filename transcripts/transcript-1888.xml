VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
ARRIVAL STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON, AT RAAF FAIRBAIRN ON RETURN<br />
FROM SOUTH EAST ASIA 17 JUNE 1968<br />
Since leaving Canberra twelve days ago, I have visited four<br />
of Australia's nearest neighbours in South East Asia.<br />
It has been, I hope, a valuable journey and has contributed to<br />
closer relations with the countries visited, besides demonstrating Australia's<br />
continuing interest in the security and advancement of South East Asia.<br />
In Vietnam I was honoured to visit our servicemen at their<br />
Woperational bases. I found them in great shape. Their morale is high and they<br />
are doing their job with resolve and confidence in the finest Anzac tradition.<br />
Talks held in Saigon with Vietnamese leaders and senior American officials<br />
were also helpful. In Singapore and Malaysia, we discussed a variety of matters,<br />
and in particular the future stability and development of the South East Asian<br />
region in the wake of the British with~ drawal.<br />
I was particularly pleased to be able to visit Indonesia, our<br />
nearest nieighbour. There, I had Lengthy private discussions with President<br />
Soeharto which I think will further friendship, co-operation and understanding<br />
between our countries. An agreement to increase cultural exchanges were<br />
* signed between our two countries while I was in Djakarta.<br />
One benefit from the visit is that I now have personal relationships<br />
with the leaders of the four count Aies whose futures are closely related to our<br />
own and this should be in itself of benefit in meeting challenges which the future<br />
Omay hold.<br />
Note: The Prime Minister is now due at Fairbairn between 10. 30 and<br />
11. 30 p. m. this evening. Because of the late hour, he will not be giving a press<br />
conference. The above statement will cover his return. He will be speaking<br />
in more detail, and answering questions, when he is Guest of Honour of the<br />
National Press Club in Canberra on Thursday. A. EGGLETON<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister </p>
