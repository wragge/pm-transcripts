" ENCOUNTER"<br />
TV INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON, ON CHANNEL 7 NETWORK<br />
Interviewer: Mr. Barry Jones 1 FEBRUARY 1969<br />
The interview opens with Barry Jones'<br />
playiXn back a segment of an interview recorded with<br />
Mr. Grton shortly prior to his selection as Liberal<br />
V/ Party Leader. On this old tape, Mr. Gorton comments:<br />
" The candidates in this election are men of<br />
ability and integrity and I think anybody could lead<br />
Australia with distinction. I just happen to believe<br />
convincingly enough that I think that I would like the<br />
chance to do it. I suppose because I feel I could do<br />
it better."<br />
Q. Prime Minister, do you think you have done it better?<br />
PM. I think that's a question that should be left to the opinion<br />
of the Australian people rather than to myself to answer. I hope by now<br />
they will have formed an opinion, and later on they will have an opportunity<br />
of expressing their views on the question that you have just asked me.<br />
Q. Do you remember just after President Kennedy came in,<br />
one of his first reactions was to say the job was very much harder than<br />
he had imagined. He thought in the Eisenhower years it would be a<br />
comparatively easy job. When he came in, he found it was terribly<br />
difficult. For somebody coming in from seventh in Cabinet ranking<br />
into the No. 1 job, what sort of problems did you find?<br />
PM. Well, I suppose the same sort of problems that anybody<br />
that ever was in No. 1 job in the Cabinet would find. I never thought<br />
the job was going to be easy or was easy, and I doubt whether it ever<br />
would be easy because there is a constant string of problems coming<br />
up for solution, a constant number of matters on which there are<br />
arguments on one side and arguments on another, and on which you have<br />
to make a balance between the different arguments and decide. Also,<br />
I would add to that there is a much greater sense of responsibility<br />
at least there is in my case for all the areas of government rather<br />
than for concentrating one's attention on the particular portfolio that<br />
one had being interested in the other areas but more interested in<br />
one's specific portfolio. Now there is a more widespread feeling of<br />
responsibility. o / 2 </p>
<p>Q. Coming in from outside, in a sense as a backbencher's<br />
candidate against the establishment, you must have been something<br />
like an Opposition Leader, coming in with a new slate, but coming in<br />
Iwithout a mandate of your own.<br />
PM. I don't know. I think I came in with a mandate that<br />
was given to me by the members of the Liberal Party who elected<br />
their leader.<br />
Q. But it was an inherited mandate.<br />
PM. Oh, I didn't take it that way at all. I took it as a<br />
selection by them of somebody they thought would make a good leader<br />
and that it was up to me to do what I felt was right and what I hoped<br />
would meet with approbation.<br />
Q. You didn't find difficulty in overcoming what is thought<br />
of as a notorious resistance within Cabinet and within the Public Service.<br />
PM. No, I think that's been very much overplayed. I don't<br />
U think it is being played nearly as much now, but it was written up at<br />
the start, and I think very very much overplayed. One journalist<br />
would write it and then another pick it up, and after a while, it<br />
seemed to remember " Alice in Wonderland" when the Red Queen<br />
Ssaid, " What I tell you three times is true". Well, it seems to be the<br />
didea that " what I write three times is true". I didn't ever discover<br />
4k_, this great difficulty that was said to be there. I am sure if there was<br />
any basis for it then, there is none for it now.<br />
Q. Obviously, the tremendous work that Mr. Hewitt has<br />
done would have eased any of the tension in the Prime Minister's<br />
Department. But it was certainly understood at the time of Mr. Hewitt's<br />
-appointment and with Sir John Bunting being put at the head of a separate<br />
section, that there was widespread tension and criticism.<br />
PM. You are now not talking about the Cabinet, you are<br />
talking about the public service?<br />
Q. I did mention the public service<br />
PM. 1 Yes, but I was answering you in relation to Cabinet.<br />
You are now specifically asking about the public service. I think that<br />
has been written up, too, in a way that I think is without proper basis.<br />
I have appointed in the course of time quite a number of heads of<br />
Departments in the past; Mr. Landau for instance in the Navy<br />
Department, ( the new Director-General of Works was in line, I didn't<br />
actually appoint him, but he was in line for recommendation); Sir Hugh<br />
Ennor in Education and Science; Walter Ives has taken over CSIRO<br />
we worked terribly closely together. Of course I had worked with<br />
Mr. Hewitt before, mainly when he was Chairman of the Universities<br />
Commission but also when he was in the Defence Division of the<br />
Treasury. I daresay there might well be some high-ranking public<br />
servants who find their advice is now questioned, probed and not / 3 </p>

necessarily taken., who may at first have thought this was not as good<br />
as it had been before, but I don't think that is continuing. Anyway, I<br />
f/ A~ t~ hink it is a necessary thing to do.<br />
Prime Minister, I will take you on to the recent exercise<br />
in London when you were one of 29 Prime Ministers at the Conference<br />
in London. To what extent was it just an old boys' reunion at which you<br />
reminisced about your problems but didn't actually achieve anything<br />
tangible?<br />
PM. Well, it wasn't an old boys' reunion as far as I was<br />
concerned. It was the first time I had ever appeared there, and it<br />
wasn't an old boys' reunion as far as several other countries were<br />
concerned because it was the first time that they had ever appeared.<br />
Nor, I think, did it have the flavour of old Carthusians or somebody<br />
coming back to discuss their school days or anything of that kind.<br />
Indeed, it was obvious as must happen when you have so many different<br />
countries, there were many different points of view on almost everything<br />
that was put up. What pleased me about it was that these points of<br />
view were put moderately with firmness, with conviction but<br />
moderately, and that having been put by some participant, that participant<br />
was then ready to sit and listen to an opposing point of view also being<br />
put that way. This, I think, from reports I've heard was a different<br />
approach from what had previously occurred at these conferences,<br />
I think a great advance.<br />
SQ. But the two outstanding problems don't seem to be any<br />
nearer resolut ion. Now in the case of Nigeria, I understand the<br />
i ~ Nigerian / Biafran problem was not even raised at all.<br />
PM. The Nigerian/ Biafran problem was not raised in the<br />
Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference proper, it being regarded<br />
as an internal matter for Nigeria, the Nigerian Government being<br />
recognised as the Government of Nigeria by the United Kingdom, and<br />
indeed by ourselves. What was the other problem?<br />
yourself? You didn't feel disposed to raise the Nigerian thing<br />
I felt that this was a matter where one could be getting<br />
into a situation where you could set a precedent for Commonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers' Conferences, suggesting actions of some kind or<br />
another in what were primarily internal matters.<br />
This wasn't perhaps because you were anticipating New<br />
Guinea being raised on a future occasion?<br />
No, it wasn't.<br />
The second problem, of course, was the problem of<br />
Rhodesia. Now, Australia lined up with a minority in the straw vote,<br />
one understands a. / 4<br />
Q. PM. Q. PM. Q. </p>
<p>PM., Well, there wasn't a vote, but if you mean that Australia<br />
lined up with Great Britain, yes, Australia did. It would have been<br />
surprising if it hadn't because before the conference took place, the<br />
policy of the Australian Government, clearly expressed, was that we<br />
felt that this matter was one for solution between the British Government<br />
and the regime in Rhodesia; and if arrangements could be made between<br />
the British Government and the regime in Rhodesia, then that was the<br />
way in which the problem should be settled. This in fact was the view<br />
of Great Britain and this in fact was the view that we supported. We<br />
were, of course we, and the others who supported us in a minority<br />
in expressing that view, but thank goodness these conferences don't<br />
depend on votes or majorities or minorities. It was left unequivocally<br />
that it is a matter between Great Britain and the regime in Rhodesia,<br />
though Great Britain said she would consult the members of the<br />
Commonwealth as events progressed.<br />
Q. In the days before your elevation to the purple, you<br />
were always thought of as being a great Rhodesia-liner, a great<br />
Rhodesia front man. How did this impression get created?<br />
PM. I haven't the slightest idea, have you?<br />
Q. No, I haven't got the faintest idea. By the way, is this<br />
the grin that endeared you so much with the African delegates?<br />
PM. I wouldn't have any idea. Somebody asked me about<br />
that when I arrived back in Australia and I pointed out that the African<br />
delegates' grins were much much wider than mine and their teeth were<br />
much better and they were really rather more attractive.<br />
Q. Have you ever, even from childhood had any sort of<br />
personal reaction to colour yourself?<br />
PM. No, I don't think I have. Never. You like people. Let<br />
me try and expand on that a little bit. From childhood, no I never have.<br />
Later on, in later years, it has been a reaction in this way: Some<br />
people seem to think you must like somebody an agree with his point<br />
of view because he is a different colour from yours. I think that is<br />
utterly and stupidly ridiculous. I think it doesn't matter whether they<br />
are a different colour from yours. You agree with their point of view<br />
if you agree with it. , You disagree with it if you disagree with it. You<br />
like some people who/' black or brown. You dislike others. You like<br />
some people who are white and you dislike others.<br />
All right, if we could pass on from this perhaps, Prime<br />
Minister, to the concept of the new nationalism that is being talked<br />
about a good deal since you have been Prime Minister, this concept<br />
that I think you first used on my programme of being Australian to<br />
the boot-heels. Except in the case of perhaps the MLC where there<br />
is a bit of Australian economic nationalism, there has been little<br />
tangible evidence of what you mean by the new nationalism. Now, is<br />
the new nationalism just a slogan or does it have a reality to you? o </p>
<p>F*<br />
PM / 6 / 1D7 1 .<br />
It has a reality to me, and it has a reality which can<br />
be expressed both tangibly and intangibly. It can be expressed tangibly<br />
in the case that you have mentioned, the case of the MLC. Some people<br />
think it was wrong. I think it was right to discover who it was that was<br />
buying up these shares and to make sure that that company was not<br />
taken over. It can have tangible expression in the guidelines spelt out<br />
not in the same detail as they must be spelt out in as soon as possible,<br />
but spelt out in my speech at the Australia Club. That is that we don't<br />
want good Australian companies taken over and owned by overseas<br />
interests. We do want an opportunity to participate in equity capital<br />
with developmental projects so that Australians will benefit from the<br />
growth of the companies as Australia grows. This is sort of tangible<br />
economics. Yes, but in the case of the Gove aluminium project,<br />
this may mean an actual diminution of the proportion of the Australian<br />
ownership, providing the quantum is greater.....<br />
It doesn't really matter, because in the case of the Gove<br />
aluminium project, Australians were offered the chance of a 50 per cent<br />
equity in participation. Now this is all one asks, that they be offered<br />
the chance. If they turn it down, if the investors in Australia aren't<br />
prepared to take that up, then that is their loss. Ultimately it may be<br />
Australia's loss, but that is their loss, and it is not sufficient reason<br />
for preventing the developmental project going ahead if the opportunity<br />
is offered. But, of course, there is more than economic nationalism.<br />
There is the psychological sort of nationalism. You have declared<br />
yourself publicly against Australia as a republic. But is the concept<br />
of Queen of Australia and you said, after all, our allegiance is not<br />
to the Queen of England but to the Queen of Australia, is this really<br />
meaningful? You mentioned Alice in Wonderland before. Now isn't<br />
this a bit of an Alice in Wonderland<br />
No, I don't think so, because in fact that is the legal<br />
situation now that the Queen is " divisible", if you are going to call that<br />
an Alice in Wonderland concept, but nevertheless, a lot of legal concepts<br />
are is divisible and is the Queen of Australia. I believe in a<br />
constitutional monarchy for Australia, and I believe in our allegiance<br />
going to the Queen of our own country, rather than to the Queen considered<br />
as the Queen of some other country. Now, you also asked me about<br />
psychological nationalism. I want to see grow in the Australian people,<br />
and I believe there is growing in the Australian people a primary feeling<br />
of being Australian so that they are happy even if they live in Victoria<br />
because of the great development going on in Western Australia, so that<br />
they are happy even if they live in Western Australia because of the Bass<br />
Strait oil discoveries which will benefit Australia. So that they think<br />
not primarily of the area of Australia in which they live, but of the nation<br />
in which they live and what they can do to benefit the nation as a whole.<br />
And what they can do to see that the nation as it grows, as it becomes<br />
more powerful takes its full place in the community of nations.<br />

Q. PM. Q. / 7<br />
ranKywa y Iyfou conceded that young people say people under<br />
that the concept of the Queen of England as the Queen of<br />
Australia was an almost meaningless concept, would you concede then<br />
that perhaps you may see an Australian republic whether you like it or<br />
not in your lifetime? I don't believe I will see it in my lifetime. I wouldn't<br />
want to see it in my lifetime. I would oppose it because I believe that<br />
the constitutional monarchy is a good form of government and perhaps<br />
the best form of government that has yet been evolved. The concept of<br />
a head of state above and beyond political considerations inside that<br />
state to whom all can look.<br />
But this is true of our Governor-General<br />
As the Queen's representative. It is not, I think, as<br />
true applied to a representative as it is applied to a monarch itself,<br />
and you are asking me about the Queen herself.<br />
/ A But surely Australia, so far as other nations looking at<br />
VAustralia, Australia would be better served in a sense if Lord Casey<br />
? o ould go to bed as Governor-General one night and wake up as<br />
President of an Australian republic with yourself as Prime Minister<br />
next morning. We would still have the Queen as head of-the<br />
Commonwealth and we would still have the ex-Governor-General as<br />
the symbol? Well, I am saying that what I would like to see, and do<br />
see and want to continue seeing is not the Queen as the head of the<br />
Commonwealth but the Queen as the Queen of Australia.<br />
Well, can you assert change without at the same time<br />
altering already existing UK and US ties?<br />
Altering already existing UK ties and US ties...,.<br />
I don't see why they should alter the ties. I don't believe that either<br />
the United Kingdom or the United States would take a different attitude<br />
towards Australia merely, because Australia is becoming more nationally<br />
conscious. and placing its own interests or what it sees as its own<br />
interests first amongst the responsibilities of its own government.<br />
Clearly, over a comparatively recent span of years changes have taken<br />
place. The United Kingdom can have a different foreign policy in regard<br />
to certain things than Australia. In the past, it couldn't in fact it<br />
didn't. It was the one foreign policy. It can have different defence<br />
policies now. It can have different economic policies now. But we<br />
are each seeking the same ultimate goal for mankind and we are each<br />
activated by the same traditions of the rule of law and of democracy.<br />
And indeed we in our Australian boots and they in their English boots,<br />
though there may be by-paths of particular aspects of policy, are<br />
marching side by side not in the same pair of boots but as partners.<br />

Prime Minister, how do you think the United States<br />
under President Nixon would react to a shade more independence<br />
in Australia's foreign policy?<br />
I don't believe the United States expects us to follow<br />
blindly their foreign policy any more than I hope they expect us to<br />
accept without question their economic policy. I see no indication that<br />
they would, and I certainly see no reason why we should not paying<br />
regard to our own interests decide our own policies.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I wanted to ask you something about<br />
ehe celebrated Gorton style. Now, how does your style of leading party<br />
/ V1 _ J and government compare with say, that of the Menzies' style?<br />
PM. I don't know what my style of leading the party and the<br />
government is. I just do what seems normal and natural to do and I<br />
don't know how that would compare with other previous leaders and I<br />
don't think it is a thing on which one can make comparisons. I would<br />
imagine each individual would have his own method, his own natural<br />
inclination, his own natural approach, and I would have thought<br />
comparisons were unnecessary and not likely to lead to any great<br />
benef it. Do you think you are a creature of impulse? Do you<br />
think you rely on intuition? You are often said to shoot from the hip.<br />
Is that a valid charge? Well, I wouldn't myself have thought so. -Although<br />
sometimes it is a necessary part of a politician's make-up to have<br />
some feelings of intuition. But looking back over the past, looking<br />
back over the weeks and weeks of negotiations that went into the<br />
arrangements which culminated in our entering overseas shipping,<br />
looking back over the weeks of negotiations that led to an oil-pricing<br />
policy, it would seem to me that if that was to be regarded as shooting<br />
from the hip, then somebody that carried on that way in the old West,<br />
wouldn't have lasted two seconds, because you had to think it out first.<br />
It's curious, though, that you should mention the old<br />
West. I think one of the most interesting things about you is your degree<br />
of enthusiasm for the United States Civil War. How did you become a<br />
US Civil War buff? Well, because I suppose from sentimentality, and that<br />
is certainly all it could be. Certainly not from conviction cr from<br />
commonsense, one supported the cavaliers in the war, knowing that<br />
they should not have won and being glad that they did not<br />
Wrong, but romantic!<br />
Yes. One supported the Southerners because they<br />
couldn't get any munitions or anything in and the Northerners could,<br />
and they were outnumbered and they fought on, and it's a terribly<br />
good thing they didn't win. Again, kind of romantic. Now, I married<br />
a girl who happens to come from Maine, the very northernmost Yankee<br />

State, and-she was rather in favour of the Union cause. This led to a<br />
lot of good-humoured discussions, and then to the buying of books and<br />
then to the buying of more books, and it had this added interest from<br />
an historian's point of view because I am an historian that in that<br />
conflict, for the first time, a cleavage between old methods of making<br />
war and new methods occurred. The rifle was brought in instead of the<br />
musket; the rifle cannon was brought in instead of the smooth-bore'<br />
cannon. Even aerial observation was brought in from balloons.<br />
Oh, you had that in Napoleonic times, of course.., a bit.<br />
Well, I think you might have a bit. You probably know<br />
more than I do, but the Army of the Potomac used this quite a lot.<br />
Railways were used much more than ever before to move troops<br />
around from point to point. Entrenchments were used. At the beginning<br />
of the war, for example, it was felt to be ungentlemanly to crcui behind<br />
a tree. You stood up. After a while you dug a hole which was the<br />
sensible thing to do. But you asked me why this happened, and this is<br />
the sort of evolution of it.<br />
Can't you see a certain irony for a centralist like<br />
yourself identif ying with the South. It is much easier to see you<br />
identifying with Lincoln and Sir Henry Bolte as Jeff Davis<br />
-PM. Q. PM. I told you it was a romantic attachment and I wasn't<br />
necessarily intellectually convinced that the South should win and I<br />
) think it was a good thing probably that they didn't. No it was a good<br />
V. thing they didn't: Prime Minister, the " Power Struggle", the Alan Reid<br />
book. You must have obviously read at least part of it. What impression<br />
did you have? Is it substantially accurate as an account of your climb<br />
to the top? Well, some bits of it I can only speak about the<br />
bits in which I myself figure. There's a whole area in the middle of<br />
the book which seems to be devoted to arguments between Mr. McEwen<br />
and Mr. McMahon taking place way back in the past before we " ruled<br />
off the book". I don't know and I am not interested in them, and whether<br />
they are accurately presented or not I don't know. But the parts in which<br />
I appear are reasonably, but by no means entirely, accurate.<br />
It is certainly not designed to push your particular barrow?<br />
PM. PM. damage me. No, I don't think it is designed to push my barrow or<br />
In a sense, as the inheritor of somebody else's kingdom,<br />
you must be looking forward to an election, because an election can<br />
resolve matters. Are you looking forward to the election contest?<br />
Well, the election resolves who is going to be the<br />
government is that what you mean? / 9<br />
PM. oloo </p>
<p>9<br />
Q. Yes, but you have got an inherited government. Clearly,<br />
if you had a mandate from the people under your own belt<br />
PM. As you say, I have an inherited government, but that<br />
surely as the record shows doesn't indicate that one is bound down to<br />
whatever it was that the previous government was thought to be bound<br />
to do. I hadn't heard in previous governments of suggestions for Going<br />
some of the things that I have suggested to you of entering a shipping<br />
line, of trying to prevent takeovers of good Australian companies, of<br />
having a new look at overseas investment policy, of trying to re-examine<br />
in depth the health and social services schemes, of removing the fear<br />
of long-term illness these are all things which we have done, not as<br />
a matter of inheritance but as a matter of initiative.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, if Mr. McMahon were toappointed<br />
Governor of New South Wales, which would be essentially a step<br />
outside your control, would you envisage a wholesale reshuffle before<br />
the elections?<br />
PM. Well, you are asking such an entirely hypothetical<br />
question I have never heard any suggestion that Mr. McMahon would<br />
want or was likely to be, or that anybody had ever thought of him being<br />
appointed Governor of New South Wales.<br />
Q. I am sorry. I didn't intend to spring it on you but it is<br />
certainly being shouted fromn the housetops in New South Wales, rightly<br />
or wrongly, I don't know.<br />
PM. Is it?<br />
Q4Q Do you see much change in your own party since you<br />
haveg ab eene wPriem e hM iniostnerr a nd aretl ataedd yto uth is, w do yaotu see sthhev dnistanceh<br />
narrowed in the last twelve months?<br />
PM. I think the gap between the Country Party and our own<br />
Party in one sense may have narrowed. In another sense, it didn't need<br />
PM, to narrow. We had the same ideological approach as distinct from the<br />
Labor Party, which has two ideological approaches fighting inside it.<br />
We had the same ideological approach all the time. We were close like<br />
that.<br />
Q. All of you? From Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes right through<br />
to Don Chipp?<br />
PM. II think so. I don't see any significant differences in<br />
anything but emphasis on some ad hoc decisions but the same<br />
ideological ends, I think, are there. On other matters, we are<br />
working very very closely together in the day to day matters. Certainly<br />
I believe it would be impossible to find two people working more closely<br />
together than John McEwen and myself. </p>
<p>1, -1 -6<br />
i V1419S/ 10<br />
As two practical and pragmatic politicians, do you see<br />
yourself and Gough Whitlam converging in a sense. Do you think that<br />
your emergence as Prime Minister has made any difference in the Labor<br />
Party and Mr. Whitlam's role in it?<br />
Well, I wouldn't know what affected Mr. Whitlam' s<br />
/ role in the Labor Party, but I would think it would be things inside the<br />
Labor Party rather than things outside which would have an effect on<br />
the attitudes which from time to time he might take up.<br />
Prime Minister just as the very last question.<br />
Do you have any ambitions as a record-breaker? Would you like to<br />
see yourself as a long-term 15-or perhaps 16-year Prime Minister?<br />
No, I wouldn't. In fifteen years' time, I would be<br />
approaching middle age, and I think a shorter period of time than<br />
that is quite enough. Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
