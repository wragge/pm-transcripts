PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 27 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
EXTRACT FROM PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO<br />
NSW CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES<br />
Retrospective tax legislation is by no means new. As far<br />
back as 1936 the British Parliament passed tax legislation<br />
which operated on tax avoidance schemes entered into before<br />
1936, and when that legislation was appealed in the Court<br />
of Appeal, one of the highest courts in Britain, the senior<br />
judge of that court made two very significant comments.<br />
" For years a battle of maneouvre has been waged<br />
between the legislature and those who are minded<br />
to throw the burden of taxation off their own shoulders<br />
on to those of their fellow subjects<br />
In that battle the legislature has often been worsted<br />
by the skill, determination and resourcefulness of<br />
its opponents of whom the present appellant has not.<br />
been the least successful.<br />
It would not shock us in the least to find that the<br />
legislature has determined to put an end to the<br />
struggle by imposing the severest of penalties. It<br />
scarcely lies in the mouth of the taxpayer who plays<br />
with fire to complain of burnt fingers."<br />
He also said:.<br />
" The fact that the section has to some extent<br />
a retroactive effect again appears to us of no<br />
importance when it is realised that the legislation<br />
is a move in a long and fiercely contested battle<br />
with individuals who well understand the rigour of<br />
the contest."<br />
one of Britain's most distinguished jurists, Viscount Simon, who<br />
was the Lord Chancellor, the equivalent to the Chief Justice,<br />
in an appeal by a taxpayer concerning the same legislation<br />
and he upheld the legislation in that appeal -pointed to the<br />
unfairness of tax avoidance practices:<br />
" Judicial dicta may be cited which point out that,<br />
however elaborate and artificial such methods * may be,<br />
those who adopted them are Tentitled' to do so.* / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
There is, of course, no doubt that they are within their legal<br />
rights, but that is no reason why their ef forts, or those of<br />
the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter, should<br />
be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or-as a<br />
discharge of the duties of good citizenship.<br />
on the contrary, one result of such methods, if they succeed,.<br />
is, of course, to increase pro tanto the load of tax on the<br />
shoulders of the great body of good citizens who do not<br />
desire,' or do not know how, to adopt these manoeuvres."<br />
Viscount Simon made a very significant point in that statement.*<br />
I should like to conclude by making it perfectly clear that<br />
the Government does not in any way regard the proposed<br />
legislation as a precedent for future action.<br />
Rather, it is legislation that has been called into<br />
existence to meet the particular and special circumstances<br />
which in the final analysis places a greater tax burden on<br />
Australian taxpayers.<br />
I understand that the British Goverrunent introduced a major<br />
piece of retrospective tax legislation in 1978 designed to<br />
eliminate once and for all aritificial1 tax avoidance schemes. </p>
