NATIONAL PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON<br />
Hotel Canberra-Rex, Canberra APRIL 1971<br />
~ peeh~ yhe PimeMinister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Mr. Chairman, Thank you and all members of the Press Club for inviting me here today.<br />
I hope I come back on many, many occasions, not as a vision or a memory, not<br />
as a former, but I hope in the way I have come today, in the capacity to enjoy mlyself<br />
as I am in your immediate company.<br />
And may I too refer to a bit of history because this will be the last occasion<br />
we will see Tony Eggleton here for some time. When I first became the Foreign<br />
M41inister then the External Minister for reasons that I will never really understand.'<br />
( Laughter) But I did suggest to the then Permanent Head perhaps the area where we<br />
were suffering most was in public relations, and I thought it mould be wise if I could<br />
get a sufficiently high enough grading for a good public relations officer, the bloke<br />
I would choose would be Tony Eggleton. We then decided well, perhaps, we couldn't<br />
get him quite enough for that, so the best thing we could do was to induce him to come<br />
in as a PR officer and later on we would be able to put him into the diplomatic service<br />
proper. Tony, I can assure you it was a tremendous personal loss to me when I was<br />
advised that it would be highly unlikely that you would come not because you would<br />
take to heart the salary, but because you had other commitments and you were a bloke<br />
who lived up to your commitments first and foremost. So we will miss you, and we<br />
do hope, Tony in the days to come you will remember that if I am around the scene,<br />
anyhow, I will be one of the first to welcome you back and I will still be thinking of<br />
you for some position in the Commonwealth Civil Service diplomatic or otherwise.<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to speak to you about three<br />
different subjects. The first one I want to speak to you about is the state of our<br />
economy, then something about the People's Republic of China I will call it from now<br />
on Coptinental China and then to refer to this problem we have about the so-called<br />
political problems associated with the sale of wheat.<br />
Well, now first of all about the state of the economy itself. No-one can<br />
deny that we are growing at a very satisfactory rate. Our rate of development is good,<br />
and before I get on, therefore, to what are our real problems, I would like, if I could,<br />
to dis ' miss certain other elements of the economy that are not causing great concern<br />
but perhaps are ones that we can regard as very satisfactory too.<br />
Now the first one happens to be our balance of payments, and within our<br />
London balances. And I want you to remember these figures in the context of what<br />
I want to say to you later on about wheat, because we haven't got a crisis in our trade<br />
relationships, and we haven't got a crisis in our balance of payments or in our<br />
international balances either. In fact, up to the present in this year, we will have a<br />
surplus in our balances of something like $ 188 million, and our international balances<br />
are running well over 700 million. For a country like us even though we are a<br />
big trader, these are satisfactory figures. </p>
<p>Secondly, insofar as the money supply is concerned, as I mentioned in a<br />
speech in the House not so very long ago, we thought that round about the beginning<br />
of tbe. June quarter we would have to liberalise the money supply, and the Reserve<br />
Bank did that yesterday, and made a statement about it yes terday. It wasn't as much<br />
as perhaps we might have expected it to be some two months ago, but it was in fact<br />
reduced probably or mainly because of the fact that we had reduced the deficit of the<br />
States when we gave them $ 43-$ 48 million at the beginning of last week.<br />
And the other point that I want to mention to you is that consumption and<br />
retail sales, or consumption expenditure and retail sale3 are running at a normal<br />
level and are not therefore a contributory factor to our current economic difficulties.<br />
Now, having said that may I then turn round and analyse what are the<br />
difficulties and the specific kind of remedies that we are making in order to meet them.<br />
Well first and foremost then, may I look at the private sector I want to<br />
divide this up into three sectors if I can private, public and then average incomes<br />
or average wages and earnings, and then to deal with the remedies themselves.<br />
But first of 41l, if I can look at the private sector, we had two areas where<br />
the demand -was too great and where the demand on resources was exceeding the<br />
actual supply, where the main area was in investment in plant and equipment and<br />
we immediately took action to take away the investment allowance. The second area<br />
was in commercial building and construction, and here the rate of commencements<br />
was exceedingly high and couldn't have continued unless we had a price increase of<br />
something of the order of 12-L to 15 per cent per annum, judged upon Commonwealth<br />
public works expenditure figures.<br />
We got the various elements of the industry together and they assured us<br />
that they knew that they were over-building and that there would be a very substantial<br />
drop in approvals and in commencements and I believe that process is continuing.<br />
Now, therefore, in the private sector we do look as though we can get<br />
control of the demand factor.<br />
I now turn, therefore, to the public sector, and here, of course, we do<br />
have one of the two major problems besetting this country. In terms of our public<br />
expenditure, there will be an increase in the State sector this year of something like<br />
16 per cent and they have particularly big difficulties because they are labourintensive<br />
in their employment figures and with wages in the education and in police<br />
and in other civil service sectors, they have of course have got a boost in costs that<br />
couldn't have been forecast at the time when their Budgets were being prepared.<br />
And, secondly, we have one other very big problem there that I believe<br />
that it is in terms of expenditure on goods and services outside wages that the amount<br />
or the increase that is taking place is great and consequently we had in co-operation<br />
with the States to reduce ours and they had to reduce theirs. They reduced their<br />
expenditures by something of the order of $ 60 million in this current year. We<br />
attempted a goal of about $ 75 million and I believe that to be a reasonable and a<br />
satisfactory figure for the moment. / 3 </p>
<p>So in the public sector we therefore took action.<br />
Coming to the third element, and that is average earnings, these of course<br />
were the besetting evil that we had to face because I am confident in this view that<br />
had it not been for the 6 per cent increase in the national wage case, driven forward<br />
by the impact of a 40 per cent wage drift that is the. amounts that were paid in<br />
average earnings over and above Arbitration awards I am absolutely certain that<br />
we would have been able to keep the economy under fairly tight control and we wouldn't<br />
have the inflationary problem that now threatens us today.<br />
But when the national wage increase of 6 per cent, adding $ 900 million<br />
to the pay cheque the take-~ home pay cheque occurred, then of course a totally<br />
different element has to be introduced. And there was really nothing that we could<br />
do about this because once your increasein wages runs ahead of your increase in<br />
productivity, you get an inbuilt infdlationary pressure and there is very little or<br />
nothing that any Government can do about this particular element.<br />
So this does introduce an element of inflation that will, I believe..., an<br />
underlying element of inflation that in terms of discounted gross national production<br />
will, I think, be certainly higher than 5 per cent and is the real difficulty that the<br />
Government has to face now and in the days to come.<br />
Now the effect of this increase in average incomes and wages might not<br />
occur immediately because savings can to some extent reduce the impact and, of<br />
course, it can occur over a period of time and not be concentrated in any one<br />
particular Budget year. So what then are we doing?<br />
We have of course announced the various measures that I have spoken<br />
of a few moments ago, but we are also looking at a wide range of measures so that<br />
we don't have to press down too heavily in any one sector. Within the course of the<br />
next few weeks we will be introducing a special Bill on resale price maintenance,<br />
outlawing it, but having certain conditions under which an application can. be made to<br />
the tribunal. We are looking in detail at the problem of restrictive practices again<br />
to see if there can be a tightening-up in the procedures and in the kind of activity<br />
that we might regard as contrary to the national interest or contrary to the competitive<br />
interests within the Australian economy.<br />
We will also be looking at the same time to see if we can strengthen the<br />
Arbitration Commission and in these and in other ways we hope that we will be able<br />
to get an internally consistent and a general programme that will, subject to what<br />
I have said about the national wage case and average earnings, will, I think, put<br />
us in a favourable position so that when the next Budget comes along we will be<br />
able to reduce the rate of government expendi ture both in the States and in the<br />
Commonwealth and thus give one other dampener to demand.<br />
Now what I want to point out to you is this. That the problems are there<br />
and in particular I have to emphasise, as other people have emphasised, too, the<br />
real problem today is one of inflation and we must look at every avenue of expenditure<br />
to ensure not only of expenditure but particularly in the area of arbitration awards / 4 </p>
<p>and over-award payments made by industry, to ensure that to the maximum of our<br />
extent we can reduce the inflationary impact. So that then is the first statement I<br />
want pd to make to you.<br />
And the second one relates to our relationships with Continental China<br />
Peking China. And here I believe there has been a great deal of misunderstanding.. This<br />
problem itself must be looked at in two separate components. And I believe that when<br />
I have listened to what has been said by the Opposition and particularly by people Who<br />
have recently been talking too freely and in an ill-informed way down in Adelaide,. I<br />
have been surprised at the lack of understanding of what is actually -happening.<br />
Well, now let me look at the two components associated with China that is<br />
Continental China and associated with it the problem of a Taiwan China the Republic<br />
of China itself. First, as I said, we have the probilem of admission to the United Nations.<br />
Now Taiwan China is in fact a member of the United Nations. It is a fact of life, and the<br />
government there has de facto control and constitutional control over 14-1 million people.<br />
It has lived up to all its international obligations, and lived up to its obligations under<br />
the United Nations Charter.<br />
On the contrary, Continental China Peking China is not a member of the<br />
United Nations. It is not recognised by us. And while there are many who feel they vould<br />
like it to be a responsible member of the United Nations and of the international<br />
community, they do so and we do so on these grounds: that if they are to become a<br />
member of the United Nations and to be recognised, then there must be some kind of<br />
assurances that they will live up to their international obligations, particularly those<br />
to the United Nations. In other words that they won't try and achieve their political<br />
objectives by force of arms. Two, that they won't be guilty of insurgency or guerrilla<br />
operations in neighbouring countries. And thirdly, that we hope they will leave their<br />
neighbours in peace. Or to put it a little more eloquently they will let the people of<br />
the countries concerned determine their own futures.<br />
Now these are the goals that we have had in our international life, and<br />
they are the goals that we want to sustain in the future. Now what then is the present<br />
and the immediate problem that we have to fact?<br />
At the last year at the United Nati. where I had the pleasure to be present,<br />
I did come to the conclusion that of the two resjlutions that were before the United,<br />
Nations one relating to what is called the Important Question and that means that a<br />
particular question can be determined important and once it becomes important<br />
it requires a two-thirds majority to permit the subsequent resolution itself to be<br />
put into effect I wondered to myself whether it would be possible to sustain the Important<br />
Question for very many more years, and then when it canrto the substantive question<br />
of what is called The Albanian Resolution, then I was fairly certain that that resolution<br />
would be carried and the effect of that would be that Continental China would become a<br />
member of the United Nations and a permanent memiber of the Security Council. But<br />
what you people and all Australians have to remember is that it would have automatically<br />
led to the expulsion of Taiwan. </p>
<p>Taiwan has been-a odinmerber,-and has lived up to its international<br />
obligations and is responsible ior the welfare of 14! L million people. Now her<br />
attitude has therefore been clear as a Government.<br />
-Let us look, first of all, at what is the immediate and pressing<br />
problem that is of admission. And consequently, as a government, we came to<br />
the conclusion that our attitude would be of doing all in our power to sustain the<br />
position of Taiwan as a member of the United Nations. We have had discussions<br />
with many of our great friends. VWe have had them visit us and talk to us. We have<br />
talked to them. We have let them know our thinking and I believe that the contribution<br />
made and the papers prepared by our own Department of Foreign Affairs are at<br />
least the equal of anything that I have seen or anything that I have heard. And while<br />
I am not now the Minister, I pay enormously high tribute to the quality of the work<br />
that has been done by the civil servants in that Department.<br />
We will do all we can to sustain the positi on providing the R. 0. C. wiant<br />
their position to be sustained in the United Nations itself.<br />
Well now, then, let me come to the question of recognition, and here<br />
I believe we run up against an extremely difficult problem because recognition<br />
is now gaining some force. But what has happened, and I can illustrate this to you<br />
by reference to the position of Canada.<br />
In the case of Canada it recognised, but it recognised on the basis that<br />
it noted the claim of Continental China, that it had an inalienable right to the whole<br />
of China including Taiwan, and it was made clear by the Canadian Government that<br />
recognition in this way meant that there should be withdrawal of recognition by<br />
Canada of the representation of the Taiwan Government. In other words, recognition<br />
of one meant withdrawal of recognition of the other, and this is the constitutional<br />
and legal position as presented to me.<br />
Now, wouldn't it be a strange thing for us if we put the cart before the<br />
horse and we went straight ahead with recognition and said, " Well, it will mean<br />
that we have to withdraw recognition from you", or what would happen is that if<br />
we recognised Continental China, it would mean that Taiwan China itself would say,<br />
" Look if you are going to do that, let us get in first and we will be first in the queue<br />
because we don't want you to take the initial action".<br />
Now I believe. the proper and the responsible course there, the only wise<br />
course that you can take and this does require a great degree of subtlety, a great<br />
degree of subtlety of handling and a knowledge of what most other countries in the<br />
United Nations and in other parts of the world are thinking. But I believe that the<br />
first step and the immediate step must be to try and ensure that by September of<br />
this year we and our friends have mobilised sufficient strength to be able to keep<br />
the Taiwan Government in the United Nations and to be able to ensure that it plays<br />
its proper part in international affairs.<br />
Now as to the facts themselves, I am fairly certain tha t if you were to<br />
be able to get a Gallup Poll of all the members of the United Nations, what it would<br />
mean would be this : That on admission, there would be a majority who favour the<br />
admission of Communist China Continental China to the United Nations, and </p>
<p>I think it would be by a bigger majority than the. Albanian majority was carried last<br />
year. Equally, too, am I certain of this that a very big majority of the members of the<br />
United Nations would like to find some means by which Taiwan China the Republic<br />
of China could also retain its membership. That is our paramount goal and it is<br />
the one that we will adhere to, and it is the policy we will be pursuing between now and<br />
the next meeting of the United Nations in September of this year.<br />
And now may I come to the other subject that I want to speak to you about<br />
and that is the one relating to wheat. I wonder if there could be more misunderstanding<br />
of the single problem of wheat than there has been at the Conference of the ALP in<br />
Adelaide. Let me first of all try and persuade you on the facts and on the logic of<br />
the situation alone. And the facts are these, and they are very easyto understand.<br />
First of all this year in the first four months of this year we have sold<br />
over three million tons of wheat in the international markets. That is 1. 1 million or<br />
per cent more or whatever it ha-ppens to be in percentage terms more than we<br />
sold last year. The biggest saiea v's-eavee ver had up until this year in the<br />
corresponding four months have been 2. 6 million tons. So we are selling, and we are<br />
selling better than ever before. But we haven't got to worry too much about the<br />
Chinese market, at least in this crop year.<br />
Secondly, in international trade, the quantities in international trade have<br />
increased from 54 to 57 million tons and we are participating in that growth.<br />
Thirdly, and this was pointed out by the Chairman of the Wheat Board<br />
yesterday or last night and p'biish-, l t. day that China itself has had nine successive<br />
good crop years and has now s'. iCient wh.-t to meet its immediate requirements and has<br />
sufficient wheat also to build up quite substantial stocks.<br />
Now there are two other facts of life that you should know. Normally<br />
China imports wheat because it has a curpi-us of high quality rice that it can export<br />
at a premium to other countries. Bec-: Iase there is a surplus of premium rice<br />
throughout the world today and is litk" y . row, China therefore is in a position<br />
where she has got a surplus of rice and w-:' re she doesn't need to depend so heavily upon<br />
the importation of wheat even c:' r is the kind that she wants most, and in<br />
terms of quality and price it is prU-b'bJLy their terms the best kind of wheat they<br />
can get, subject to getting a reasonable quantity of high protein Canadian wheat.<br />
Now those are the facts of life as they exist today and the other fact that I<br />
should mention is that within the cocur.! s of the last few days the Australian Wheat<br />
Board has returned from negotiating with Nung Fung Hong Corporation, cn behalf of<br />
the Chinese Government in order to find out what the true position with regard to<br />
Chinese Continental Chinese demand for wheat should be. They had established<br />
and are continuing to establish the most clo se and friendly commercial relationships<br />
with them, and the Corporation itself has s3id to them, " We want you to keep in<br />
closest contact with us. We want the goodwill that exists between us to keep on because / 7 </p>
<p>4 4 7.<br />
conditions may change."<br />
And with the changing conditions, well, your guess is just as good as<br />
mine -as to what could happen.<br />
Now, I admit quite freely here that of course the Continental Chinese<br />
would be making as much political mileage out of this as they could, but equally<br />
certain am I of this particular fact that when they want wheat, and they want it<br />
in quantities, they are hard traders and they will buy where they can get the best<br />
commercial advantage. Some politics yes, but not a great deal. But I am sure<br />
of this, that it is the hard facts of commercial life that will determine what their<br />
actions will be. Put that in context against the fact that we are doL.-g pretty well<br />
in the international wheat trade, the price is good, particularly good, and the<br />
Wheat Board itself certainly cannot, if you read its statement of last night, be<br />
regarded as coming back with any feeling that there is a crisis or that we face<br />
real problems. Now as to the suggestion that there should be a political group, promoted<br />
by people like Mr. Hawke and the Secretary of the Labour Party not the Parliamentary<br />
representatives and this is something of tremendous significance to us that a<br />
delegation should be going to China, to Peking China, to be able to put the political<br />
position to them not as the representatives of the Australian wheatgrowers, not as<br />
the constitutionally-established or legally-established Wheat Board that has the<br />
responsibility for selling our wheat. If the delegation goes, I venture to suggest that<br />
they can do both political harm and they can do harm to the interests of every single<br />
grower throughout the Australian community. But they would do that only in<br />
circumstances when China has a shortage of wheat through either bad crop years<br />
or for other reasons. What I want to emphasise is that this is n political gesture<br />
and I have never known political gestures to be successful in commercial life of this<br />
kind. On the contrary, if you are playing politics for the shabbiest of motives, the<br />
probability is that you will do harm and I believe this can do, as I repeat it again<br />
this can do damage to the wheat interests of this country.<br />
So there were the various matters that I vmanted to speak to you about today.<br />
I want you to understand, too, and particularly those who are members of the Press<br />
Gallery and of the National Press Club that my door has in the past been always open<br />
to you. I believe as a practising politician that it is our responsibility as Members<br />
of Parliament and as Members of a Cabinet and of a Government to be able to provide<br />
you, unless there are security reasons to the contrary and that applies particularly<br />
to Foreign Affairs that we should give you access to the maximum of information.<br />
I want you to understand, too, that whenever you are givei, information that you feel<br />
ought to be checked that either my door or the door of my Press Office will be open.<br />
Consequently we will do our best to see that this communications gap is narrowed.<br />
Thank you Mr. Chairman for giving me the chance of coming here and<br />
speaking to you today. I ask you to put any question you want to me, and if it is in<br />
my capacity, I give you my assurance I will do my best to answer it.<br />
* This paragraph has been adjusted in line with the amendment made by the Prime<br />
Minister in the subsequent question time. </p>
