TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE,<br />
CANBERRA, 29 AUGUST 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you confirm that Saddam Hussein will<br />
release all women and children<br />
PM: I can't confirm it. We have no confirmation from it<br />
yet. As far as we're concerned it's still a report but I<br />
express the hope that the report is true.<br />
JOURNALIST: How many Australians are held that you think<br />
could be released under these circumstances?<br />
PM: Well you can't put a precise number on it because<br />
he's apparently limited the purported proposal to women<br />
and children. But it's, you know, you would think over a<br />
hundred. JOURNALIST: is true, does it alter your perception<br />
of Saddam. Hussein? Does it make him a nice guy?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think of the offer?<br />
PM: It's a totally bizarre situation with which we've<br />
been dealing and this is another element in a bizarre<br />
situation. Most of them have had no redeeming features.<br />
This at least if it's true and as I say I can't confirm<br />
it yet offers some hope for people who deserve hope.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will Cabinet be making a decision<br />
on Telecom before the special conference?<br />
PM: That's a matter for internal decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what does yesterday's decision on<br />
the Commonwealth Bank mean to the special conference<br />
PM: It means different things for different people and<br />
for me it confirms the logic of what I've been talking<br />
about. I've got to go now.<br />
JOURNALIST: win on Ansett and Qantas and Telecom<br />
since you've had a win on this one, on the Commonwealth<br />
Bank? PM: Life is not as simple as that.<br />
ends </p>
