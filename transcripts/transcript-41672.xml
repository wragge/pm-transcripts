    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, the Honourable Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, will visit Australia from 23 to 29 June.</p>
<p>Australia enjoys a close relationship with Vanuatu, with our two nations sharing strong economic, security and people to people links.</p>
<p>The visit will provide an opportunity for Australia and Vanuatu to enhance our strategic partnership and deepen our economic and security cooperation.</p>
<p>Discussions will focus on opportunities to increase bilateral trade and investment. In line with existing areas of cooperation, leaders will also discuss bilateral cooperation on labour mobility, policing and cyber security.</p>
<p>The visit will provide an opportunity to discuss shared regional challenges, such as climate change and transnational crime.</p>
<p>We are committed to stepping up our engagement in the Pacific in support of a stable and prosperous region. As Vanuatuâ€™s largest bilateral aid donor, Australia will invest approximately $62.3 million in development assistance in 2018-19.</p>
<p>Our cooperation focuses on supporting economic governance, infrastructure, education health, law and justice.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Salwai will be accompanied by Mrs Marie-Justine Salwai and will travel to Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane as part of the visit.</p>
