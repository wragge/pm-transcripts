The Prime Minister today has advised Premiers that $ 165.3 million<br />
will be made available to the States for pa~ ssing to local<br />
government authorities as general revenue assistance in 1977-78<br />
under arrangements provided by the Commonwealth in the Local<br />
Government ( Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976.<br />
The amounts ' to be paid to each State in 1977-78,. together<br />
with the corresponding amounts for 1976-77 are:<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAX-SHARING ENTITLEMENTS<br />
1976-77 1977-78<br />
$ m Sm<br />
New South Wales 51.3 60.3<br />
Victoria 35.4 42.1<br />
Queensland 24.2 27.9<br />
South Australia 11.9 14.2<br />
Western Australia 13.2 15.5<br />
Tasmania 4.0 5.3<br />
Total 140.0 165.3<br />
The distribution shown for 1977-78 is based on the -percentage<br />
distribution recommended by the Grants Commission and accepted<br />
by all Premiers at the Premiers' Conference on 1 July 1977.<br />
Amending legislation to give effect to this distribution will<br />
be given priority in the Budget sittings and it is not expected<br />
to cause any delays in payments to local government authorities.<br />
" Local Government will1 in the light of this information now be<br />
able to reasonably estimate the amount it is likely to receive<br />
in this year", the Prime Minister said. a o/ 2 </p>
<p>The funds provided to the States under -these arrangements<br />
are allocated to individual local government authorities by<br />
the States. Under general guidelines provided in the Commonwealth<br />
legislation, at least 30% of the funds are to be distributed<br />
to all Councils on a per capita basis, which may be weighted'<br />
for area or population density, with the balance being allocated<br />
on a needs basis which is the subject of prior inquiry and<br />
report by the individual State Grants Commissions.<br />
The funds will be made available to the States for payment to<br />
each local government authority as soon as possible after the<br />
States Grants Commissions have completed their assessments and<br />
th e Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs<br />
has been notified that the proposed distribution is in accordance<br />
with the legislation.<br />
The general revenue assistance to local government has increased<br />
from $ 80 million under the previous, government to $ 140 million<br />
last year the first year of the new tax-sharing arrangements<br />
and $ 165 million this year. The Commonwealth Government's<br />
tax sharing arrangements hove thus provided a very substantial<br />
and rapidly growing source of funds to local government bodies<br />
throughout the country. Just as importantly, the funds are<br />
provided without strings giving local governments the freedom,<br />
and the responsibility, to determine their own expenditure<br />
priorities. Canberra<br />
