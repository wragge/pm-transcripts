ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED </p>
<p>A warm welcome, Your Excellency, and a warm welcome also to you, First Lady of Timor-Leste, Ms Isabel Ferreira.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, I know that you are no stranger to Australia.</p>
<p>Your previous visits as Chief of the Defence Force have a lasting legacy in the enduring links you forged with Australia’s military leadership.</p>
<p>However, this is your first visit as President, and it is a privilege to welcome an old friend in a new and distinguished capacity.<br />
 Mr President, I have also been a frequent visitor to your beautiful country over the years.</p>
<p>Timor-Leste was one of the first countries I visited as Prime Minister, reflecting the importance I personally place on our relationship.</p>
<p>I last visited Timor-Leste as Foreign Minister in July 2011. </p>
<p>I visited Timor-Leste’s National Police Academy – supported by the AFP’s Timor-Leste Police Development Program. </p>
<p>I travelled to Maliana in Timor-Leste’s west to visit a farming community benefitting from the AusAID and ACIAR-supported Seeds of Life program.</p>
<p>The friendship between our people goes back far beyond independence in 2002.</p>
<p>It was forged in the jungles of World War II, when brave and selfless Timorese locals gave shelter, food and assistance to the Australian soldiers of Sparrow Force.</p>
<p>These ties were strengthened from the mid-1970s onwards, when Timorese communities established themselves in Melbourne, Sydney and Darwin.</p>
<p>Our friendship deepened again when Australia led the multilateral INTERFET force after the independence ballot.</p>
<p>And again when we participated in the UN International Stabilisation Force.</p>
<p>Many Timorese who made a safe home here in Australia during those difficult years of conflict have now returned to Timor-Leste.</p>
<p>Lending their energies and talents to the building of a proud new nation.</p>
<p>Now, a decade on from independence, our relationship is that of close neighbours, good friends and partners.</p>
<p>History tells us it can take a nation a generation, or more, to build resilience and confidence after conflict.</p>
<p>Timor-Leste has turned its face to the future with resolve and energy.</p>
<p>And in one short decade it has laid the foundations of a modern state.</p>
<p>It has been a transition to a more stable and self-determined future.</p>
<p>But a future in which friends are still within hearing, still there with a hand outstretched.</p>
<p>So, while domestic and military security is now in the hands of Timor-Leste’s own, home-grown forces, Australia is still there, helping to build local capacity through our bilateral defence and policing programs.</p>
<p>And Australians are working side by side with locals to help achieve the Timor-Leste Government’s ambitious development goals.</p>
<p>Delivering health and education projects.</p>
<p>Ensuring that women get the health services they need during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Delivering water and sanitation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Pursuing rural development goals.</p>
<p>Re-building the rural roads so essential to economic supply chains.</p>
<p>Repairing destroyed schools, so that children can get the education they deserve.</p>
<p>The students enrolled in primary education rose from 190,000 in 2000, to almost 239,000 in 2010, a significant achievement.</p>
<p>Today almost half of the students who complete primary school are girls.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to work together – and in partnership with others in the region.</p>
<p>Last week in Indonesia I met President Yudhoyono and I note – Mr President – that you also visited Indonesia on a state visit last month. </p>
<p>The inaugural trilateral leaders meeting between our three countries  was held November 2012 and we look forward to further discussions.</p>
<p>I am heartened to see that we both have such strong relationships with our near neighbour.</p>
<p>And all three nations are committed to exploring the possibilities of working more closely together.</p>
<p>The Seasonal Worker Program is another example of a new area where we are working together for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>People, and the connections between them, have historically been at the heart of the relationship between Timor-Leste and Australia.</p>
<p>That won’t change.</p>
<p>Whatever our shared path over the coming years, we will tread it together.</p>
<p>Your Excellency – obrigardo wain.</p>
<p>I thank you for honouring us with your visit.</p>
<p>You are among friends.</p>
