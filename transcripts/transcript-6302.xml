J U T R L! 4<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA31 January 1984<br />
The attached telex was today sent to the Queensland<br />
Premier. ACTINGI </p>
<p>The Hon. J. Bjelke-Petersen, MLA,<br />
Premier of Queensland,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
BRISBANE QLD 4000.<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
I refer to your telex of 29 January 1984 to the Prime<br />
Minister concerning the differences between our two<br />
governments on the level of Medicare compensation payments<br />
to Queensland.<br />
I am afraid that, in both your telex of 29 January and that<br />
of 26 January, you have envisaged a role for the Commonwealth<br />
Grants Commission in this matter that was not contemplated by<br />
the Prime Minister, and is simply not appropriate within the<br />
framework of the current arrangements for the payment of tax<br />
sharing grants to the States. These arrangements were, you<br />
will recall, settled at the June 1982 Premiers' Conference and<br />
are to run until 1984-85. I understand that your Government<br />
accepted these arrangements as put forward by the previous<br />
Commonwealth Government.<br />
However, in his correspondence of 18 November and 24 January<br />
the Prime Minister suggested that, if you believe Queensland<br />
is receiving unfair financial treatment, there will be an<br />
opportunity for that contention to be tested in the Grants<br />
Commission's next review of relativities. In other words,<br />
there is already an established mechanism for considering<br />
Queensland's case. </p>
<p>You have suggested that the Grants Commission should be asked<br />
to report separately and immediately on the level of Medicare<br />
compensation being offered to Queensland. But it would<br />
simply not be possible for the Commission to examine equity and<br />
relativity questions effectively if its examination were to<br />
be confined to one particular Commonwealth program. It is<br />
precisely the purpose of the forthcoming review of relativities<br />
to examine the overall financial implications of all<br />
Commonwealth programs for the States.<br />
As the Prime Minister has indicated, the Commonwealth is<br />
prepared to insert an additional clause into the terms of<br />
reference for that review, to ensure that Queensland's<br />
arguments in relation to Medicare are fully examined.<br />
This review is due to be completed before the middle of next<br />
year, and the recommendations would need to be considered at<br />
next year's Premiers' Conference. It is quite misleading of<br />
you to suggest that, because of the previous Government's<br />
delay in implementing the 1982 Grants Commission report, it<br />
would take this Government five or six years to settle the<br />
issue.<br />
The Commonwealth's approach to Medicare compensation has<br />
been to ensure that no State is disadvantaged financially as<br />
a result of the Commonwealth's introduction of the Medicare<br />
scheme. It has never been the Commonwealth's intention that<br />
individual States should " profit" franMedicare yet the<br />
attitude being taken by your Government seems to be to extract<br />
as much as possible from the scheme so that, in your words, </p>
<p>" we can now do something else with the cash".<br />
The situation has now clearly been reached where it is not the<br />
Commonwealth's policy which threatens to disadvantage<br />
Queensland taxpayers, but your own Government's desire to<br />
profit from the introduction of Medicare.<br />
If the Queensland Government signs the Medicare Agreement, it<br />
will be better off than it would have been if the existing<br />
health insurance arrangements had continued, in particular as<br />
a result of the special payment of $ 15 million in 1983-84 and<br />
million in a full year offered as part of the Medicare<br />
compensation arrangements. As a result of the Agreement,<br />
your Government will be more than fully compensated for additional<br />
costs and lost revenue.<br />
It is quite wrong to imply that Queenslanders will be paying<br />
the levy without receiving as much in return. On current<br />
estimates, the Commonwealth would expect to raise $ 212 million<br />
from Queensland taxpayers under the Medicare levy, abolition<br />
of the tax rebate, and other sources in 1984-85. In contrast,<br />
Commonwealth outlays in Queensland under Medicare in 1984-85<br />
are expected to be of the order of $ 220 million.<br />
In the light of the Commonwealth's offer to insert an<br />
additional clause into the Terms of Reference of the Grants<br />
Commission Review, I ask again that you indicate as soon as<br />
possible your willingness to sign the agreement so that the<br />
people of Queensland can participate fully inthe Medicare<br />
program. Yours sincerely<br />
Lionel Bowen </p>
