    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australians have been deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake of 26 January. Unofficial reports indicate over 10,000 people have died and many thousands more are missing.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I extend to Prime Minister Vajpayee, and the Government and people of India our heartfelt sympathies. I am contacting Prime Minister Vajpayee separately to convey condolences to the families of the victims and our offer of support.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will contribute $1 million to assist immediate emergency relief programmes through the United Nations and International Organisations. These funds will provide emergency assistance to the devastated communities including delivering clothes, blankets, medical supplies and clean water.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is also supporting the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team by sending an experienced disaster management expert, Mr Joe Barr, to assist in assessing the situation and coordinating international assistance.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to monitor the situation in order to determine how best we can provide any further assistance.</p>
