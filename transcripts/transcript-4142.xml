PRIME~ jMD, 3STER 4 JUNE 1976<br />
FOR PRESS F76/ 109<br />
VISITS OF NUCLEAR POWERED WARSHIPS<br />
I wish to inform the House that my Government has decided to allow<br />
the resumption of visits to Australian ports by nuclear powered<br />
warships. This decision has been made after a long and careful<br />
examination of the many aspects associated with this subject.<br />
In furtherance of the objective of ensuring that matters affecting<br />
the environment are fully examined and taken into account, the<br />
Government has given very careful consideration to a classified draft<br />
Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the Department of Defence.<br />
However, in the opinion of the Government it would be contrary to<br />
the interests of Australia for this document to be made available<br />
publicly. Nevertheless, in order that maximum possible information consistent<br />
with the interests of Australia, be made available to the public,<br />
a document entitled " Environmental Considerations of Visits of<br />
Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia" dated. May 1976 is attached to<br />
this statement.<br />
The House will be aware that there have been a number of visits in<br />
the past by United States nuclear powered warships. In the interests<br />
of our national security, the Australian Government attaches great<br />
importance to the presence in this area, under the ANZUS alliance,<br />
of the United States Navy, which is increasingly converting to nuclear<br />
powered warships.<br />
With well ove r one hundred naval reactors in operation, United States<br />
nuclear powered warships have visited over thir-ty countries and<br />
eighty five foreign ports. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
our decision follows consultations with the United( States Governmen-,&gt;"<br />
on safety procedures and legal indemnity. In the latter connection,<br />
the United Sfates Congress in December 1974 enacted a Law ( Public Law<br />
93-513) pursuant to which, as was made clear by the Joint Congressiona2"<br />
committee on Atomic Energy, the United States accepts absolute liabilit'<br />
for any nuclear damage which might-result from a nuclear incident<br />
involving the reactor of a United States warship.<br />
The Government is taking these decisions on the basis of international<br />
experience with nuclear powered warships and in light of-the<br />
assessments in the unclassified Environmental document which I am<br />
tabling. The Government accepts the expert advice that the risk of<br />
an incident resulting in a release of radio-activity is extremely<br />
low and the hazard to human health and the environment is remote.<br />
All necessary control and safety measures will be implemented<br />
at the berths th be used.<br />
Those matters are dealt with in detail in the document " Environmental<br />
Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia".<br />
I would also point to the remarkable safety record of United States<br />
nuclear powered warships.<br />
There is further compelling reason why action is required in this<br />
matter. About a third of the United States Navy is nuclear powered.<br />
we have a military alliance with the United States through the ANZUS<br />
Treaty. Under Article II of that Treaty, we have undertaken to act<br />
separately and jointly to maintain and develop our individual and<br />
collective capacity.... Unless nuclear powered ships are able to use<br />
Australian ports, there will be no prospects of Australia remaining<br />
an adequate and reliable ANZUS partner. That is not a statement from<br />
any American source it is my own.<br />
The ANZUS Treaty requires cooperation with the United States.<br />
At the very least, that would require that the. United States be able<br />
to replenish her ships and that we should provide such support as<br />
% are able, not only in peace-time circumstances as a good ally,<br />
but in any emergency that may arise in the future. The vital<br />
character of-our alliance with the United States and with ANZUS<br />
require this actio n to be taken. </p>
<p>O /. In reaching a decision on the resumption of visits, the Government<br />
has had the benefit of a very wide range of expert advice. Defence<br />
and Australian Atomic Energy Conmission scientists have participated<br />
in. the examinations and relevant matters have received consideration<br />
by the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council.<br />
Appropriate arrangements concerning environmental safeguards will<br />
be applied in consultation with state, governments by a group of<br />
officials led by officials of the Department of Environment, Housing<br />
and Community Development. Such arrangements will be undertaken,<br />
as necessary, before visits take place.<br />
