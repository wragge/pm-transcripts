    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, we mourn the passing of a giant of our region.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Lee Kuan Yew led a vulnerable, fledgling nation to independence.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to his vision and determination, Singapore is one of the world’s most successful countries.</p>
<p>In Lee Kuan Yew’s own words, Singapore’s remarkable journey has been from 'third world to first’.</p>
<p>Thanks to his leadership, Singapore is now one of the world’s most prosperous nations, a financial powerhouse, and one of the world's easiest places to do business.</p>
<p>Our region owes much to Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<p>Here in Australia and beyond, leaders sought and learned from his wise counsel.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew enjoyed close relationships with successive Australian Prime Ministers and worked with them to establish the strong partnership that Singapore and Australia have today. </p>
<p>At every stage, Australia and Singapore have stood shoulder to shoulder. We continue to do so today, as we salute one of the significant leaders of our time.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I extend my condolences to Mr Lee’s family and to the people of Singapore.</p>
