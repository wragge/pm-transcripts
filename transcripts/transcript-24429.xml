    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Commonwealth Government released the first Infrastructure Australia audit of northern Australiaâs infrastructure.</p>
<p>The audit outlines the regionâs current infrastructure asset base and its potential long-term needs.Â  Its findings affirm the Commonwealthâs objective to further develop the north and to encourage greater levels of private sector investment in infrastructure in northern Australia.</p>
<p>It found that the population in northern Australia is projected to grow more quickly than Australia as a whole, at 1.8 per cent a year, compared to 1.6 per cent in the broader population.</p>
<p>At this growth rate, northern Australia will be home to around 1.77 million people by 2031, while upper estimates place up to 2.1 million people in our north.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth will work with northern jurisdictions to develop a pipeline of critical infrastructure projects â roads, rail, water, electricity, ports and communications â to cater for the growing population and deliver economic growth.</p>
<p>The right mix of infrastructure investment, delivered in the right place at the right time will be critical to providing a strong future for northern Australia.</p>
<p>It will also ensure northern businesses and communities are better connected, both across the north and with growing international markets to Australiaâs north.</p>
<p>Reforms being undertaken to improve infrastructure planning, project appraisal and selection will complement the work of the audit.Â </p>
<p>This work will assist in allocating funding to infrastructure projects that return the highest benefits to communities for a stronger and more prosperous northern Australia.</p>
