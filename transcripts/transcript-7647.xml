PARIS MONDAY 19 JUNE 1989<br />
I am delighted to be able to return to Paris for my second<br />
official visit to France. I count it a special privilege to<br />
be here as Prime minister of Australia at this time on the<br />
eve, as it were, of the celebration of the epoch making<br />
events of two hundred years ago.<br />
At such a time, it gives me particular pleasure to be able<br />
to state that the fundamental relations between our two<br />
countries have never been stronger. Australia and France<br />
now have a friendly and co-operative relationship which<br />
reflects our shared history, our shared democratic ideals<br />
and our shared aspirations for the advancement of our<br />
people.<br />
Already, during my visit, I have had powerful and poignant<br />
reminders of our long and close association. Tremendous<br />
tides of history have worked to bring our two peoples<br />
together. Yesterday, at the Somme, Australian and Frenchmen<br />
and women assembled together to honour the sacrifice of two<br />
generations of our fellow countrymen in the cause of<br />
democracy and freedom.<br />
This evening, during my call on the Mayor of Paris,<br />
M. Jacques Chirac, I announced an Australian gift to the<br />
City of Paris of a bust of the great explorer Jean-Francois<br />
de La Perouse. This, in itself, commemorates one of the<br />
most remarkable and indeed, romantic episodes in the<br />
history of exploration; that day in January 1788 when two<br />
expeditions from the far ends of the earth met near what is<br />
now the great city of Sydney the French on a scientific<br />
naval voyage of discovery and the British to found a tiny<br />
settlement from which the modern nation of Australia has I 140 </p>
<p>grown. That remarkable encounter further serves to remind<br />
us of the significant ro ' le played by France in the<br />
exploration of Australia and the Pacific not only by the<br />
ill-fated La Perouse, but by Bougainville, D'Entrecasteaux,,<br />
Baudin and Peron.<br />
I had the opportunity today to discuss with President<br />
Mitterrand and Prime Minister Rocard developments in New<br />
Caledonia. I told them that we applaud and support your<br />
achievement in bringing about agreement between the major<br />
parties to the dispute in that territory. We share your<br />
hope that the Matignon Accords will provide-the basis for a<br />
long-term and peaceful settlement in New Caledonia.<br />
Australia stands ready, in agreement with the French<br />
authorities, to do what it can to co-operate with the people<br />
of Mew Caledonia in this crucial period of their<br />
development, which is important to the peaceful and stable<br />
development of the South Pacific region.<br />
Australia welcomes France's policies in New Caledonia as a<br />
constructive contribution to the affairs of the South<br />
Pacific, where we are willing to co-operate with you in the<br />
pursuit of common goals and policies.<br />
I do not seek, however, to gloss over Australia's<br />
disappointment and opposition to the continuation of your<br />
nuclear testing program in our region. Australia's views<br />
are, of course, shared by other member countries of the<br />
South Pacific Forum.<br />
As my talks with French leaders today confirmed, Australia<br />
and France share common views on a wide range of<br />
international issues. Both countries are prepared to take<br />
risks in the search for peace, as evidenced by our efforts<br />
ina respect of Cambodia and the Middle East, specifically<br />
Lebanon. Likewise, we have worked together closely on<br />
disarmament issues, especially those relating to Chemical<br />
weapons. Mr Fauroux, Mmne Avice, this important occasion tonight,<br />
involving both business and Government leaders, demonstrates<br />
our commitment to work tovards a significant improvement in<br />
OUr coonamic relaUtuuwaihp. As we agreed in our earlier<br />
talks, there is considerable scope to expand two way trade<br />
and investment. I very much appreciate the involvement of<br />
you, Mr Fauroux, of Mmne Avice, and of your Ministerial<br />
colleagues. My Government has taken major policy initiatives over the<br />
past six years to open up the Australian economy to foreign<br />
trade and investment. We welcome French interest and French<br />
investment: we are convinced that Australia offers much to<br />
French businessmen both in its own right'and as a </p>
<p>springboard to the considerable and rapidly expanding<br />
markets of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
I very much welcome the initiative of Prime Minister Rocard<br />
in creating a ' Club Australia' under the guidance of Mr Jean<br />
Gandois,, to work towards improving French knowledge of the<br />
Australian market and of the opportunities which exist for<br />
trading with and investing in Australia. I can assure you<br />
that this initiative has the full support of my Government.<br />
As I told you before dinner, we are working actively in<br />
Australia to establish complementary institutional<br />
arrangements which will strengthen further the vital links<br />
between our private sectors. It is they who are at the<br />
sharp end of the relationship and it is incumbent upon both<br />
governments to ensure that they have a positive and<br />
supportive framework in which to operate.<br />
For our own part, we are conscious of the need to develop<br />
greater awareness in the Australian business community of<br />
the opportunities represented by the large French market and<br />
of the significant role you play in leading-edge scientific<br />
and technological developments. The Australian business<br />
leaders who have accompanied me to Paris represent some of<br />
Australia's largest and most highly respected companies. As<br />
was evidenced in our discussions before dinner, they are<br />
interested and committed to finding mutually beneficial<br />
commercial opportunities with their French counterparts.<br />
Some are already positively involved in the French market in<br />
a very significant way.<br />
A great challenge for Australia is to take advantage of the<br />
enormous opportunities offered by the creation of a single<br />
European Market in 1992. Indeed, an important purpose of my<br />
visit is to explore further the implications of 1992, and to<br />
urge European Governments not to lose sight of the impact of<br />
their decisions on other trading nations and regions in the<br />
world. The Australian Government and people welcome the historic<br />
developments now unfolding in Western Europe. They portend<br />
for the peoples of Europe a transformation of the pattern of<br />
their history as momentous as that achieved by the French<br />
Revolution itself.<br />
A Single Market open to the outside world will be a truly<br />
positive force in the international trading system and is<br />
something Australia would very much welcome. A Market<br />
closed and restrictive will have failed its ultimate<br />
promise. Hr Faurowc, Mine Avice, I cannot mention these issues without<br />
referring to the Common Agricultural Policy of the European<br />
Community. </p>
<p>The CAP has done great damage directly to Australia, by<br />
distorting internal agricultural markets. Indirectly, that<br />
damage has been compounded through the United States'<br />
retaliation in the form of its Export Enhancement Program<br />
and other mechanisms. Australia has been caught in the<br />
crossfire of the EC/ Us trade war.<br />
In Australia's view, subsidised agricultural trade casts a<br />
shadow over our relations with France, and other community<br />
countries. As you know, we, and our Cairns Group partners,<br />
are working actively to ensure that such problems are<br />
resolved in the Uruguay Round of negotiations due to end in<br />
1990. A successful outcome would not only be to the benefit<br />
of efficient primary producers worldwide but would bri~ ng<br />
very direct benefit to European consumers in the form of<br />
cheaper food and foodstuffs.<br />
If agriculture represents a difficulty between us, there is<br />
a matter of supreme importance to this generation and all<br />
future generations which offers enormous scope for<br />
French-Australian co-operation.<br />
I take this opportunity to place on record the Australian<br />
government's recognition of the-French contribution towards<br />
focusing the world's attention on the crucial question of<br />
the environment. We are grateful for the leadership that<br />
France gave at the Hague meeting last March. We salute<br />
President Mitterrand and Prize Minister Rocard for their<br />
leadership and commitment.<br />
My discussions in Paris have established common ground<br />
between our two countries on Antarctica. We share deeply<br />
felt reservations about jeopardising this unique area of the<br />
world by exposing it to mining. I am confident that we can<br />
work together to protect the Antarctic wilderness as a<br />
legacy to future generations of the environmental sense of<br />
responsibility of this generation.<br />
M. Fauroux, lMe Avice,<br />
It is a special privilege to be here in Paris at such an<br />
historic time for France and for the world.<br />
The history of European settlement in Australia is<br />
contemporaneous with the history of Western civilisation<br />
since the French Revolution. Indirectly, that momentous<br />
event has had a profound influence on us. over the years,,<br />
Australia and France have found themselves on the same side<br />
in the great and tragic conflicts which-have shaped the<br />
modern era. And today, I find enormous encouragement in the<br />
common values and goals which link the citizens of Australia<br />
and France as we prepare to enter the 21st Century. </p>
