    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today that Professor Peter Johnston will join the Prime Ministerial Taskforce that is undertaking the review into uranium mining, processing and the longer term contribution of nuclear energy in Australia.</p>
<p>Professor Johnston is Head of Physics at the School of Applied Sciences, RMIT.  He is also the Registrar and a member of the National Executive of the Australian Institute of Physics and a councillor of the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering.  Professor Johnston is a member of the Radiation Health and Safety Council that advises the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and a former member of the Nuclear Safety Committee and Radiation Health Committee.</p>
<p>Professor Johnston is replacing Ms Sylvia Kidziak AM, who has had to step down for personal reasons.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank Ms Kidziak for her preparedness to serve on the Taskforce and for bringing to the Taskforce her deep and valuable experience in nuclear health and safety.</p>
<p>The Taskforce is currently receiving submissions from the public on its terms of reference and will issue a draft report for public comment in November.  Its final report is due by the end of 2006.</p>
