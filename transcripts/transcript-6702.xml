PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT ON THE BLF<br />
21 AUGUST 1985 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MR SPEAKER,<br />
BEFORE I AZDRESS i. YSELF SPECIFICALLY TO THE BILL BEFORE THE<br />
HOUSE, LET ME SAY THAT THIS GOVERNMENT D6IESN'T NEED ANY<br />
ADVICE ON THE CONDUCT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FROM THOSE ON<br />
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HOUSE, WHO BY THEIR INEPTITUDE BROUGHT<br />
ABOUT A SITUATION OF ANARCHY IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE<br />
BEGINNING OF THE 1980s.<br />
AND IF THEY WERE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, WHICH THEY WILL<br />
NOT HAVE, REPRODUCE EXACTL. Y THE SAME SITUATION BY THE NONSENSE<br />
THAT THEY ARE TALK: NG ABOUT IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.<br />
THEY WOULD SCRAP ENTIRELY THE SYSTEM OF CENTRALISED WAGE<br />
FIXATION, THEY TALK ABOUT MUDGINBERRI, THEY WOULD HAVE<br />
A SITUATION WHERE THE STREGTH OF TRADE UNIONS AND THE STRENGTH<br />
OF EMPLOYERS WOULD BE PITTED CONSISTENTLY AGAINST ONE ANOTHER<br />
AROUND THIS COUNTRY. IT'S A POLICY WHICH BROUGHT CHAOS IN<br />
1981-82,<br />
THEY LEARN NOTHING. THEY WOULD INFLICT IT UPON AUSTRALIA<br />
AGAIN. NEITHER THIS COUNTRY NOR THIS GOVERNMENT WANTS ANY<br />
ADVICE FROM THIS COLLECTION INCOMPETENTS IN THE AREA OF<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. </p>
<p>THE BILL NOW BEFORE THE HOUSE IS A UNIQUE AND I BELIEVE<br />
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION,<br />
IT STEMS DIRECTLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S CONVICTION THAT NO<br />
GOVERNt. MENT CAN TOLERATE, OR IN ANY WAY ACQUIESCE, IN THE<br />
FORMS OF UNIONISM PERPETRATED BY UNIONS SUCH AS THE BLF,<br />
As I SAID WHEN FORESHADOWING THIS LEGISLATION LAST WEEK:<br />
" THE BLF's COMPLETE DISDAIN FOR THE LAW, THEIR<br />
FREQUENT RESORT TO PRACTICES OF THUGGERY AND PHYSICAL<br />
COERCION: HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY."<br />
THE BLF HAS FORFEITED ANY CLAIM IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE HAD<br />
EITHER ON THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE OR ON THE TRADE UNiON NOVEMENT.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT OVER MANY YEARS THE BLF HAS<br />
DEMONSTRATED NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR THE SYSTEM AND VALUES<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY, THERE SHOULD NOW BE NO BASIS UPON<br />
WHICH IT CAN HOPE TO ELICIT ANY MEASURE OF PROTECTION OR<br />
SUPPORT FROM OUR SOCIETY,<br />
I KNOW OF NO SENSE IN WHICH THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT CAN<br />
REGARD THE INDUSTRIAL THUGGERY PRACTISED BY THE BLF WITH<br />
ANYTHING BUT PROFOUND DISQUIET. THE BLF CONSISTENTLY NOW<br />
HAS PUT ITSELF OUT OF LINE WITH THE MAINSTREAM OF WHAT<br />
LEGITIMIATE TRADE tr. Inr! St.: IS A!. OUtT. iT FOR THIS REASOr </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS THAT THE LEGISLATION NO-' v PROPOSED TO<br />
THIS HOUSE WiLL GET INDEED ALREADY HAS GOT THE<br />
NECESSARY LEVEL OF SUPPORT FROM THE TRAL) E UNiON MOVLPIENT,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS PART IS DETERMINED TO CREATE A NEW<br />
INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY, AN<br />
ENVIRONMENT OF GREATER PEACE AND SUBSTANTiALLY IMPROVED<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
WITH BENEFITS TO BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYE S<br />
AND FOR EMPLOYERS<br />
AND FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEGUN LIGHTLY THIS LEGISLATIVE<br />
INITIATIVE AGAINST THE BLE, To PROPOSE . AS W1E NOW DO<br />
MEASURES WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE<br />
REGISTRATION OF THE BUILDERS LABOURERS' FEDERATION UNDER<br />
THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT, OR THE EFFECTIVE<br />
EQUIVALENT OF SUCH DEREGISTRATION IN PARTS OF AUSTRALIA, IS<br />
A MAJOR STEP NOT LEAST FOR A LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />
BUT THERE COMES A POINT AT WHICH GOVERNMENT HAS TO SAYENOUGH,<br />
AND WE HAVE DONE THAT,<br />
WIE AND OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE INDUSTRY HAVE SHOWN INDEED<br />
CONSIDERABLE PATIENCE IN THE FACE OF REPEATED FAILURE BY<br />
THE BLE TO ADHERE TO INDUSTRIAL AGREEMENTS. </p>
<p>THE' ACT IONS OF THE ELF HAVE POSED A CONTINUOUS THREAT TO<br />
THE STABILITY OF THE BUILDING INDUSIRY, THE EMPLOYMENT OF<br />
OTHER BUILDING WORKERS, AND TO THE PRICES AND INCOMES<br />
ACCORD. THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF THE BLF APPROACH THAT ARE<br />
THOROUGHLY REPREHENSIBLE BY THE STANDARDS OF CONTEMPORARY<br />
SOCIETY: THEY USE THE STRIKE WEAPON AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL<br />
TACTICS SUCH AS SELECTIVE BANS AND LIMITATIONS WITH<br />
THE OBJECTIVE OF " THE MOST HARM TO THE BOSS, THE LEAST<br />
HARM TO ( THEMSELVES)". ( STEVE BLACK, NSW SECRETARY OF<br />
BLF 1979),<br />
SUCH ACTION FREQUENTLY IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE USE OF<br />
VIOLENCE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INTERRUPTION OF CONCRETE<br />
POURS AND INTIMIDATION OF FELLOW WORKERS AS WELL AS<br />
EMPLOYERS TO ACHIEVE BLF OBJECTIVES.<br />
STANDOVER METHODS AND GUERRILLA TACTICS ARE COMMON<br />
WEAPONS OF THE BLF<br />
THEY HAVE USED THEIR CENTRAL POSITION IN THE<br />
INDUSTRY WITH DEVASTATING EFFECT THROUGH MEASURES<br />
SUCH AS<br />
BANS ON STRATEGIC PARTS OF JOBS AND EQUIPMENT<br />
ONE DAY AND ONE WEEK BANS ON CONCRETE POURS,<br />
BREAKAGE OF CONCRFTE POURS<br />
ON TRU,[ CK DELIVFRIES AND UNLOADING I </p>
<p>SAFETY AND OVERTIME BANS,<br />
THEIR ACTION IS NOT CONFINED TO DIRECT INDUSTRIAL FORAYS,<br />
THEY HAVE ALSO OCCUPIED BUILDINGS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES,<br />
PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS, AND, AT LEAST ON ONE OCCASION,<br />
PREMISES OF ANOTHER UNION, THE SIGHT OF THE BLF ENGAGING<br />
IN VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS AND PHYSICAL ASSAULT AGAINST<br />
FELLCW UNIONISTS HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE,<br />
THE BLF's BEHAVIOUR AND TACTICS ARE ADDRESSED IN DETAIL IN<br />
THE 1982 WINNEKE ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT, AND I QUOTE BRIEFLY FROM<br />
IT, MR DEPUTY SPEAKER, IN THESE TERMS:<br />
" THESE TACTICS FIND NO SUPPORT OR CONDONATION IN ANY<br />
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION IN THIS COUNTRY, THEIR CONDUCT<br />
NOT ONLY EX: EEDS THE BOUNDS OF INDUSTRIAL PROPRIETY<br />
BUT, IN MANY INSTANCES, BLATANTLY TRANSGRESSES<br />
CRIM! NAL LAW,. IN MANY, IF NOT MOST, INSTANCES DEMANDS<br />
ARE MADE ACCOMPANIED BY THREATS, THOSE THREATS ARE<br />
FREOUENTLY It1PLEMENTED AND THE IMPLEMENTATION HAS GOME<br />
FAR BEYOND FINANCIAL LOSS AND HAS INVOLVED DAMAGE TO<br />
PROPERTY AND PERSON THE RESULT HAS BEEN TO PLACE<br />
THE BLF IN A UNIOUE POSITION A POSITION OF BEING<br />
ABOVE THE LAW,".<br />
THE FEDERATION HAS ALSO SHOWN CONTEMPT FOR THE<br />
PROCESSES OF CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION. IT HAS<br />
CONTINUALLY REFUSED TO ABIDE BY ORDERS OF THE<br />
COMMISSION AND CONSISTENTLY DESPITE MANY<br />
UNDERTAKINGS PURSUED CLAItIS OUTSIDE THE GUIDELINES<br />
THE Cor;. ISSjOr:, </p>
<p>THE DISI) AIN INFORMING THE BLF APPROACH TO THE<br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION COMES THROUGH<br />
CLEARLY IN REMARKS BY BLF OFFICE hOLDERS, A FEW<br />
EXAMPLES: ARE NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT ANY DECISION FROM<br />
THE COMMISSION ON A DEMARCATION BETWEEN BUILDERS'<br />
LABOURERS AND THE AWU." DALTON 1979).<br />
S.,, UNDERTAKINGS CANNOT BE FOREVER AND EVER.... WE ARE<br />
NOT GOING TO BE HELD TO AN AGREEMENT FOREVER AND<br />
EVER." ( NORM GALLAGHER 1979),<br />
" THE FEDERATION ', ILL NOT ABIDE BY ANY DECISION OR<br />
ORDER THAT WOULD FOLLOW. THE FEDF9ATION WOULD PURSUE<br />
ITS CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD,"<br />
CAPOGRECO 1980),.<br />
SUCH EXPRESSIONS OF ATTITUDE BY BLF OFFICIALS UNFORTUNATELY<br />
HAVE NOT BEEN IDLE THREATS, THEY HAVE INFORMED THOSE VERY<br />
ACTIONS OF THE BLF WHICH NOW MAKE NECESSARY THE ACTION<br />
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT,<br />
BLF ACTIVITIES THAT THE GOVERNMENT REGARDS AS FAR BEYOND<br />
THE BOUNDS OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE WOULD INCLUDE THE<br />
FOLLOWING: I<br />
BREAKING THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERTAKING TO THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
REGISTRAR REGARDING FUTURE CONDUCT WHICH WAS A<br />
COrt,' ITl ON I'R RE-REGISTRATION IN 107 </p>
<p>BETWEEN 1976 AND 1982 THE BLF REPEATEDLY PURSUED<br />
CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM, USED VIOLENCE AND<br />
INTIMIDATION IN PURSUIT OF ITS CLAIMS AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL ACTION OVER NON-INDUSTRIAL ISSUES,<br />
DISREGARDING THE MORATORIUM ON IN4DUSTRIAL ACTION<br />
AGREED IN 1983 IN RETURN FOR NEGOTIATIONS TOWARDS A<br />
FORMAL AGREEMENT WHICH WOULD REPLACE DEREGISTRATION<br />
PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED UNDER THE FORMER GOVERNMENT<br />
DESPITE THE MORATORIUM, THE BLF MOU. NTED WHAT THE<br />
CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION<br />
CONFERENCE, MR VOSTI, DESCRIBED AS THE<br />
" INTOLERABLE" ACTION OVER THE FLETCHER WATTS<br />
D I F UT E,<br />
BREACHING OF ITS NO FURTHER CLAIMS UNDERTAKING IN<br />
OCTOBER 1983 TO THE COMMISSION AS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE<br />
NATIONAL WAGE CASE INCREASES,<br />
* THESE BREACHES WERE FLAGRANT. Two MONTHS AFTER<br />
GIVING THE UNDERTAKING THE BLF ENGAGED IN A<br />
CAMPAIGN FOR AN EXTRA $ 9 PER WEEK IN 1984, MADE<br />
DEMANDS FOR A 36 HOUR WEEK AT SHOPPING CENTRE<br />
SITES, MADE CLAIMS FOR THE 1985 2,6% NATIONAL VIAGE<br />
CASE INCREASE PRIOR TO ITS RATIFICATION BY THE<br />
COMMISSION AND TOOK INDUSTRIAL ACTION IN SUPPORT OF<br />
SITE ALLOWANCE CLAIMS, </p>
<p>AND THE LIST GOES ON, IN PECEMBER 1983 THE BLF MADE<br />
UNDERTAKINGS TO THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WERE ACCEPTED BY THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AS GROUNDS FOR ITS WITHDRAWAL FROM THE<br />
DEREGISTRATION CASE, BUT BY FEBRUARY 1984, THE BLF HAD<br />
LAUNCHED A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR AN EXTRA $ 9 PER WEEK<br />
RATHER THAN PARTAKING IN NEGOTIATIONS DIRECTED TOWARDS A<br />
SUPERANNUATION SCHEME, IN APRIL 1984 THE BLF ENGAGED IN A<br />
DISRUPTIVE DISPUTE OVER A DEMARCATION ISSUE AT THE ALCAN<br />
KURRI KURRI SMELTER SITE, DURING THIS DISPUTE THE BLF<br />
PICKETTED THE SITE AND DAMAGED CARS OF EMPLOYEES. THE<br />
OFFICES OF THE COMPANY'S SOLICITORS WERE ALSO INVADED.<br />
THIS PERIOD ALSO WITNESSED THE MCG LIGHT TOWERS DEMARCATION<br />
DISPUTE DURING WHICH THE SITE WAS FENCED OFF AND POLICE<br />
WERE REQUIRED TO COUNTER A BLF PICKET OUTSIDE THE SITE,<br />
BLF MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED ON A NUMBER OF CHARGES INCLUDING<br />
TRESPASS AND RESISTING ARREST. SUPPORTING BANS WERE ALSO<br />
PLACED ON OTHER VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT PROJECTS, ON TWO<br />
OCCASIONS THE BLF ATTEMPTED TO INVADE THE OFFICES OF THE<br />
RIVAL UNION, THE AWU,<br />
No GOVERNMENT CAN IGNORE ANARCHY OF THIS KIND,<br />
VHILE H.^ AVE EEN DP. EPARING FOR THE EVENTUALITY OF SUCH<br />
LEGISLATInN THE NEW SOUTH 1,' ALES GOVERNMENT HAS NOW<br />
DEREGISTERED THE BLF </p>
<p>AND THE CAIN GOVERNMENT IN VICTORIA HAS TAKEN<br />
LEGiSLATIVE ACTION THAT WOULD AIMOUNT TO EFFECTIVE<br />
DEREGISTRATION OF THE BLF FROM ' THE VICTORIAN<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM<br />
To BE FULLY EFFECTIVE THESE MEASURES BY VICTORIA AND NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE COMPLEMENTED By FEDERAL<br />
GOVERNMENT ACTION<br />
PARTICULARLY IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA WHERE THE<br />
FEDER~ ALLY REGISTERED ELF HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF MAJOR<br />
DISRUPTION<br />
IN ITS DETERMINATION TO BRING THE ELF TO ACCOUNT, THE<br />
GO\ VERNMENT HAS REMAINED MINDFUL OF COMMUNITY CONCERN ThAT<br />
THE DEREGISTRATION POWERS WE NOW PROPOSE SHOULD NOT BE USED<br />
INDISCRIMINATELY OR CAPRICIOUSLY<br />
WE SEE NO BASIS -EITHER BY WAY OF PRECEDENT OR<br />
PRACTICE -FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATION BEING APPLIED<br />
IN A WIDER, TOTALLY CRUDE EXERCISE IN UNION BASHING.<br />
THE CIRCUMSTANCES POSED BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE ELF<br />
ARE GENUINELY UNIQUE. </p>
<p>I clI<br />
THESE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY WEIGHED IN THE BILL THAT<br />
WAS INTRODUCED TO THE PARLiAMENT YESTERDAY, HAVING REGARD<br />
TO THE OVERWHELMING NEED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST KEY<br />
ELEMENTS OF THE BLF AND THE NEED TO MINIMISE THE POTENTIAL<br />
FOR ABUSE.<br />
ACCORDINGLY A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BILL IS THE ROLE<br />
OF A FULL BENCH OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION<br />
COM MISSION IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE BLF HAS ENGAGED IN<br />
CONDUCT THAT HAS PREVENTED OR SERIOUSLY HINDERED ARBITRAL<br />
PROCESSES. SUCH A DETERMINATION BY THE ARBITRATION CO~ iIwISSION WOULD BE<br />
A PREREQUISITE OF ANY GOVERN4MENT DECISION TO DEREGISTER THE<br />
BL--F WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE OVERWHELMING NEED TO ENSURE<br />
THAT JUSTICE IS DONE IN THIS MATTER, BUT THAT ALSO IT<br />
IS SEEN TO BE DONE<br />
THE BASIS FOR THE GOV'ERNMENT'S INTRODUCING THIS SPECIAL<br />
LEGISLATION IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE BLF's CONDUCT AMOUNTS TO<br />
A REPUDIATION OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM FOR THE PREVENTION AND<br />
SETTLEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES AND OF ITS<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES AS A FEDERALLY REGISTERED ORGANISATION OF<br />
EMPLOYEES, AS WELL AS BEING UTTERLY DISRUPTIVE TO<br />
INDUSTRIAL PEACE. </p>
<p>As tHE MINISTER SAI,: YESTERDAY:<br />
" IN THE GOVERNEr'T'S vIEW, THE ACTION WHICH IS<br />
CONTEMPLATED IN THIS LEGISLATION IS SO SERIOUS THAT IT<br />
IS ESSENTIAL THAT THERE BE IMPARTIAL CONSIDERATION BY<br />
AN INDEPENDENT TRIBUNAL OF THE FEDERATION'S CONDUCT.<br />
THIS WILL OCCUR AGAINST SPECIFIC CRITERIA WHICH ARE<br />
APPROPRIATE TESTS OF WHETHER THE FEDERATION HAS<br />
BEHAVED RESPONSIBLY AS AN ORGANISATION REGISTERED<br />
UNDER THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT AND IN A<br />
WAY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM."<br />
THE BILL BEFORE THE HOUSE ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE MINISTER<br />
FOR EMPLOYM. E NT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO BE ABLE TO<br />
DECIDE UPON APPROPRIATE ACTION FOLLOWING A FINDING OF<br />
MISCONDUCT BY THE UNION,<br />
HONOURABLE MEMBERS WILL ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL<br />
PROVIDES FOR A RANGE OF GOVERNMENT ACTION WHICH COULD BE<br />
TAKEN AGAINST THE BLF EXTENDING FROM.<br />
NATIONAL DEREGISTRATION OF THE ELF UNDER THE<br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT TO<br />
SELECTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE BLF IN RELATION TO<br />
TERMINATING OR SUSPENDING RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES OR<br />
CAPACITIES OF THE BLF UNDER THE CONCILIATION AND<br />
ARBITRATION ACT, </p>
<p>12,<br />
HONOURABLE MEMBERS WILL APPRECIATE THAT DEREGISTRATION,<br />
PARTICULARLY IN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD BE A POTENT<br />
ACTION AGAINST THE BLF<br />
ANY AWARD APPLYING TO THE BLF WOULD CEASE TO HAVE ANY<br />
EFFECT IN RELATION TO THE BLF A1ND ITS MEMBERS<br />
THE BLF WOULD NOT BE CiPABLE OF BEING A PARTY TO A<br />
PROCEEDING BEFORE THE COMMISSION OR TO AN AWARD MADE<br />
BY THE COMIMISSION, AND THE C0or11SSION WOULD NOT HAVE<br />
ANY POWERS UNDER THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT<br />
IN RELATION TO AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE IN SO FAR AS THAT<br />
DISPUTE INVOLVED MEMBERS OF THE FEDERATION,<br />
IT WOULD ALSO BE OPEN TO THE MINISTER TO MAKE ORDERS 1. HICH<br />
WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF GRANTING TO OTHER REGISTERED<br />
ORGANISATIONS COVERAGE OF WORK IN AN INDUSTRY OR IN A<br />
LOCATION IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE BLF IS OR HAS BEEN<br />
REGISTERED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL REQUIRE THE ASSISTANCE OF EMPLOYERS,<br />
THE ACTU AND OTHER BUILDING UNIONS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF<br />
ITS PROPOSALS,<br />
THERE WILL BE A PARTICULARLY HEAVY ONUS ON EMPLOYERS IN THE<br />
INDUSTRY TO TAKE A FIRM STAND, Too OFTEN IN THE PAST<br />
EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO DO SEPARATE DEALS WITH THE r<br />
BLF AGAINST THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. </p>
<p>-FURTHER, EMPLOYERS HAVE ADOPTED INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS'<br />
PRACTICES WHICH HAVE FACILITATED THE SUCCESS OF THE<br />
BLE'S TACTICS,<br />
EMPLOYERS CAN HELP BY NOT ON4LY REFUSING TO ABIDE THE<br />
BEHAVIOUR OF THE BLF, BUT EV-EN MORE IMPORTANTLY DOING<br />
NOTHING TO LEND SOLACE OR SUCCOUR TO ITS POSITION. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO EXPECT EMPLOYERS TO HONOUR THEIR~<br />
OBLIGATIONS IN RELATION TO AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF[<br />
INDUSTRIAL BEHAVIOUR INCLUDING BY ADHERENCE TO PROCEDURES<br />
OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AGREEMENT, BY REFUSIN'G TO PAY FOR<br />
TIME LOST DURING STRIIKES AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL ACTION, BY[<br />
ENSURING THAT SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE APPLIED AND BY<br />
SEEING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ENROLLED IN BUILDING INDUSTRY<br />
SUPERANNUAl iON.<br />
W4HAT BUILDERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS TH4AT IN THE LONGER TERMA<br />
THEIR INTERESTS, AN4D THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, DEPEND<br />
UPON HAVIN4G A RATION4AL SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
WlITHIN WHICH THERE IS, AS THERE APPROPRIATELY SHOULD BE<br />
WITHIN A DEMOCRACY, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGITIMATE TRADE<br />
UNIONS TO PUT POINTS OF VIEW AND FOR THERE TO BE RATIONAL<br />
INTERCHANGES BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND ORGANISED WORKERS. THIS<br />
RELATIONSHIP OBVIOUSLY HINGES ON THE PARTIES TO THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP BEING ABLE TO RELY ON THERE BEING CIVILIZED<br />
BEHAVIOUR WITHIN THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT. </p>
<p>14.,<br />
CGOTAINLY THE COMMUNITY HAS HAD ENOUGH OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF<br />
THE BLF AND OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE BUILDING<br />
INDUSTRY AS A '-HOLE, THE CX-IMUNITY EXPECTS EMPLOYERS AND<br />
ALL UNIONS INVOLVED TO RESPOND TO THE CLEAR COMMUNITY<br />
POSITION ON THIS,<br />
IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING<br />
CONFIDERATION4 TO NON-LEGISLATIVE MEASURES DESIGNED TO<br />
ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS ON GOVERNMENT PROJECTS ADHERE TO<br />
GOV'ERNMENT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PRACTICES,<br />
THIS GO\ VERNMENT BELIEVES FIRMLY IN LEADERSHIP BY<br />
EXAMPLE IN THIS MATTER AND WILL BE APPROACHING STATE<br />
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT SIMILAR MEASURES,<br />
MR SPEAKER,<br />
IT IS WELL KNOWN IBELIEVE THAT IWOULDN'T ALWAYS EMBRACE WHAT<br />
IS IN THE EDITORIALS OF THE ' AUSTRALIAN' NEWSPAPER BUT I DO BECAUSE<br />
THEY ARE SOMETIMES WRONG, BUT ON THIS OCCASION THEY ARE<br />
PRE-EMINENTLY RIGHT. AND ON THE 19TH JULY OF THIS YEAR IN<br />
AN EDITORIAL IN THE ' AUSTRALIAN' THIS WAS SAID<br />
" THE BLF HAS SHOWN ABSOLUTE DESREGARD FOR BOTH THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL AND CIVIL LAWS OF AUSTRALIA FOR YEARS, IT<br />
HAS IGNORED THE ORDERS OF INDUSTRIAL COURTS, INVADED<br />
PRIVATE OFFICES AND DESTROYED PROPERTY, EMPLOYED WqHAT<br />
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS STANDOVER TAC'. ICS IN<br />
NEGOTIATIONS WITH BUILDING COMPANIES AND COST THE<br />
COUNTRY UNTOLD MILL IONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH<br />
OUFSTIONALE INDUSTRIAL ACTION" </p>
<p>WE INTEND PUTTING AN END TO THIS SITUATION,<br />
I SUPPOSE, MR DEPUTY SPEAKER, IT DOESN'T NEED TO EBE EMPHASISED BUT<br />
I DO MAKE THE POINT WITH THE BACKGROUND I HAVE IN THE TRADE UNION<br />
MOVEMENT IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE TO HAVE ARRIV'ED AT THIS SITUATION,<br />
BUT IT IS A NECESSARY POSITION THAT WE HAVE REACHED NOW AND<br />
WE INTEND TO TAKE THE ACTION WHICH IS NECESSARY IN THE INTERESTS<br />
OF THIS SOCIETY.<br />
WE DO SO IN THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE AND LOOK TO THIS<br />
HOUSE FOR FULL AND UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT IN THE ACTION NOW<br />
PROPOS ED,<br />
I COMMEND THE BILL TO THE HOUSE.<br />
