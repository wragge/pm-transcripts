    <content><![CDATA[<ol><li>During President Widodo’s state visit to Australia, Prime Minister Turnbull and President Widodo met for the annual Indonesia-Australia Leaders’ Meeting with other Australian and Indonesian Ministers in Sydney on 25–26 February 2017.</li>
<li>Leaders acknowledged the deep historical ties between Australia and Indonesia as a foundation for a strong 21st Century partnership. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which is the bedrock for Indonesia and Australia’s defence and security relationship. Our relationship continues to evolve, reflecting the strength of the partnership between our two dynamic and growing countries.</li>
<li>To seize the opportunities before us, Leaders agreed to draw on the strengths of each country to create jobs and investment and raise living standards; to harness a shared strategic vision for our region to safeguard sea lanes, fight terrorism and deter transnational crime; and to celebrate our diversity, through deeper community understanding of our neighbouring societies, languages and cultures.</li>
<li>The Australia-Indonesia relationship has the potential to bring enormous benefits to our peoples and to be one of the most consequential in our region. Our common interests mean we will be much stronger if we work together in our rapidly changing region. Risks and uncertainties only make it more critical we have a strong partnership that enables us to tackle challenges and seize opportunities together.</li>
<li>Leaders reaffirmed Australia and Indonesia’s mutual commitment to each other’s prosperity and security, underpinned by an extensive framework of cooperation spanning political, economic, security, development, education and people-to-people ties.</li>
</ol><p>Enhanced Economic Partnership</p>
<ol start="6"><li>As the two largest economies in the region, Australia and Indonesia have shared interests and a common future. Leaders noted trade links are strong, but have not yet reached their full potential. They recognized that as close neighbours in the world’s most dynamic region opportunities are on our doorstep.</li>
<li>Leaders committed to intensify our efforts to achieve a high-quality Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) to transform our economic partnership. The two Leaders’ commitment on IA-CEPA reflects our shared determination to demonstrate regional leadership in support of trade to drive growth and prosperity. IA-CEPA will improve on commitments under our existing free trade agreement, the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement. It will create new openings for trade and investment to ensure the economic relationship can flourish into the future.</li>
<li>Our vision for IA-CEPA goes beyond a traditional free trade agreement. It will face the challenges and seize the opportunities of the current trading environment building on the special Indonesia–Australia relationship. Accordingly, IA-CEPA will deliver on trade and investment, and also drive cooperation and support greater partnership.</li>
<li>Negotiations are progressing well, with the last round of talks held just last week. Leaders recommitted to concluding a comprehensive deal this year.</li>
<li>Leaders discussed the importance of infrastructure to fulfilling economic potential. Leaders noted that a new Australian-funded 10 year $300 million program in Indonesia was due to commence in April. This program will support the development of high quality infrastructure.</li>
<li>Leaders agreed on the importance of maintaining stable food supply and affordability and reaffirmed their commitment to build cooperation in the beef and cattle industry. Leaders recognised the progress made so far through the Partnership on Food Security in the Red Meat and Cattle Sector and the focus on building a strong integrated supply chain in cattle and beef products between the two countries. They agreed that market-based solutions and building capacity are the best means to ensure strong and productive industries, stabilise prices and grow markets.</li>
