PRIME MINISTER 108/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE FION P. J. KEATIN~ G, MP<br />
ELECTIONS AND THE CONVENTIONS OF GOVERNMENT<br />
Just over six months ago, Dr Hewson made an unsuccessful appeal to the people of<br />
Australia to elect him as Prime Minister. if he can hold the wolves of his own party at<br />
bay, he will no doubt try again in a couple of years' time.<br />
But Dr Hewson's behaviour in recent weeks threatens to undermine the democratic<br />
process itself, and to pollute his own leadership ambitions for the fu~ ture, He has now<br />
put himself under a grave obligation to spell out just what his determination to<br />
vandalise the Government's budget means to the future of representative democracy in<br />
this country.<br />
Does Dr Hewson now concede and accept that any future Liberal Government has<br />
forfeited the right to frame and enact budgetary and economic policy? Do his own<br />
actions now lead him to conclude that being elected the majority party in the House of<br />
Representatives means only that the Government is entitled to whatever power it can<br />
negotiate with marginal and minority parties in the Senate? Does he accept that he is<br />
trampling on the basic principles of operation of the democratic system of government<br />
in this country?<br />
Dr Hewson, who seeks to be elected to power through the conventional method of<br />
leading a party to a majority position in the House of Representatives, is the leading<br />
participant in a dangerous move to transfer power to the less representatively elected<br />
upper house. Down that track lays chaos and potential disaster. Dr Hewson might<br />
feel frustrated and cheated that he didn't get what he wanted from the last election, but<br />
that doesn't entitle him to take out his petulance on the entire system of government.<br />
There are grave dangers for any country when the power and authority of the elected<br />
government is blurred or undermined. There is a very fine line betwecn the<br />
Opposition's right to make forcefuil political capital, and irresponsible, intolerable<br />
behaviour. Some timie in the next several days, Dr Hiewson will walk back from, or<br />
over, that line. The media have a duty to inform Australia about the course of action<br />
he takes, and to call him to account if he crosses that line.<br />
