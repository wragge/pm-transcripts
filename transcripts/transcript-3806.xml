Press Statemenft No. 526<br />
June 1975<br />
SENATOR BERT M4ILLINER<br />
I was deeply grieved to hear of Senator milliner-' s--<br />
death. As well as being a respected and admired member<br />
of the Labor Party and the trade union movement, Bert<br />
Milliner was a close family friend.<br />
His long years of service to the party included a<br />
quarter of a century as a member of the Queensland Central<br />
Executive and 9 years as President of the Queensland Branch.<br />
He served his union, his party and the Parliament<br />
with great loyalty and distinction. I extend my deepest<br />
sympathy to his widow and family.<br />
