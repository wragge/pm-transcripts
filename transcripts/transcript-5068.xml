OFFCE: OV THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CAN BERRA<br />
13 June, 1979<br />
WILLESEE INTERVIEW<br />
Because of extensive editing, the text of the interview which<br />
the Prime Minister gave to Mr. Michael Willesee is being issued<br />
in full.<br />
Mr. Wi.;_ llesee-indicated when he sought the interview on the<br />
Government's recent economic statement that it was for a special<br />
programme which was to last the full half hour of his scheduled<br />
broadcast time.<br />
Whe.-the interview was put to air on Monday evening, 11 June, it<br />
was heavily edited. The responses to eight questions were<br />
brcadcast in part only. In one of these instances, the<br />
Priz-, e Minister's reply was cut in the middle of the broadcast<br />
portion, with a further cut at the end. In another instance,<br />
the answer to one question was cut and joined to the answer to<br />
a different question later in the interview.<br />
Points made by the Prime Minister in edited-out portions of the<br />
part answers broadcast included the following:<br />
Despite the high unemployment, there has been a steady<br />
rise in private civilian employment for some 8 or 9 months.<br />
There are optimistic signs in the economy in that<br />
Australian industry is gtf-tting a better share of the<br />
domestic market.<br />
The basic employment potential in Australia is growing<br />
for the first time for many years.<br />
Having to renew the tax surcharge was a disappointment,<br />
but the Government' s main commitment was to responsible<br />
economic management.<br />
Changes in the economic situation after the August Budget<br />
included substantial increases in interest rates in Britain<br />
and the the growth in the size of the wheat crop over<br />
estimates, the unexpected extent of the rise in beef prices,<br />
and the events in Iran with their impact on oil prices, all<br />
of which had an effect on the money supply and there was<br />
a need to respond to these changes.<br />

<p>PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 7 JUNE 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY MIKE WILLESEE<br />
Willesee I might as well get all the upopular stuff over with first.<br />
Broken promises. You've answered a lot of questions about these<br />
in recent times and I know you'vye said they were all made in<br />
good faith and I think most people would accept that. I'd like to go<br />
through them anyway. Unemployment: You were very wide of the mark<br />
with unemployment. Why?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Unemployment did fall through 1978.-It didn't fall enough to start to<br />
reduce the number unemployed. ( Deletion: WHAT WE HAVE HAD<br />
HOWEVER, IN THE LAST 8 OR 9 MONTHS, IS A STEADY RISE IN PRIVATE<br />
CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT, AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED<br />
FOR 7 OR 8 YEARS). I think we earlier underestimated the<br />
difficulty in getting manufacturing industry moving, getting<br />
the employment base, therefore rising. We obviously hoped we would have<br />
more success on the wages front but I don't state that as an<br />
excuse, I just state it as a fact of life. ( Deletion: THE<br />
IMBALANCES THAT HAVE COME INTO THE ECONOMY ARE CLEARLY TAKING<br />
MUCH LONGER THAN ANYONE HOPED IN WORKING THEMSELVES OUT<br />
BUT THERE ARE SOME OPTIMISTIC SIGNS AT THE MOMENT<br />
BECAUSE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IS GETTING A BETTER SHARE OF THE<br />
DOMESTIC MARKET AND IT'S ALSO, IN AN EXCITING WAY, GETTING OUT<br />
INTO MNANY EXPORT MARKETS IN A FASHION THAT'S JUST NOT BEEN<br />
POSSIBLE OVER THE LAST 5 OR 6 YEARS. THIS OF COURSE IS THE BASIS<br />
ON WHICH AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT HAS TO BE BUILT).<br />
Will ese e<br />
You couldn't have been more definite about your statements of<br />
unemployment falling you've specifically said that it will<br />
start to fall from February and it will keep falling. Then you<br />
went on to your taxation promises, also you were pretty<br />
definite about them...<br />
Pri-m Mfiister<br />
Unemployment did go on falling throughout that year 1978-<br />
so let's not forget that.<br />
Wi 11,= a<br />
But you wouldn't say now that you were promising that fall only<br />
for the year. It was an on-going thing under your government<br />
that was your promise. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Everyone knows there is a seasonal increase in unemployment as<br />
school leavers leave and as they register in November or December.<br />
Nobody could take what was said as indicating that that would not<br />
occur. There was a fall in employment throughout the year, but I've said t<br />
fall was not great enough to start to reduce the basic number unemployed.<br />
( Deletion: NOW, WE HAVE SEEN FOR 7 OR 8 MONTHS, A RISE IN<br />
PRIVATE CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT AND THAT MEANS THAT THE BASIC<br />
EMPLOYMENT POTENTIAL IN AUSTRALIA IS GROWING. AND THIS IS FOR<br />
THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. SO, YOU KNOW, MAYBE A LITTLE LATER,<br />
CERTAINLY NOT AS MUCH AS WE'D HOPED, BUT POLICIES ARE WORKING IN<br />
ESTABLISHING MORE JOBS).<br />
( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
WHAT ABOUT TAX? YOU SAID THEY WOULDN'T RISE. YOU WERE QUITE<br />
SPECIFIC ABOUT IT.)<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
WE SAID THAT TAXES WOULD FALL AND WE SAID WE'D INTRODUCE NEW<br />
TAX SCALES, AND SO WE HAVE. WE ALSO SAID WE'D INTRODUCE TAX<br />
INDEXATION WHICH MEANT 7HAT GOVERN T NEEDED MORE REVENUE THEY<br />
WOULD HAVE TO LEGISLATE FOR IT AND SO WE HAVE, IN THAT. BUT I<br />
THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY ASKING ABOUT THE SURCHARGE.)<br />
( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
NO, NO, FIRSTLY YOU SAID TAX WILL NOT RISE JUST AS A SIMPLE<br />
STATEMENT, PROMISE.)<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
WE NEVER SAID THAT TAXES WOULDN'T GO UP BUT WE DID SAY THAT IF<br />
GOVEPMENTS WANTED MORE MONEY, THEY'LL HAVE TO LEGISLATE FOR IT<br />
AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DEBATE ABOUT TAX INDEXATION. BEFORE THE<br />
LAST ELECTION WE'D INTRODUCED NEW TAX SCALES AND TAX REFORMS. EARLIER,<br />
BEFO. E THOSE REFORMS, ON THE HAYDEN SCALES, PEOPLE WERE ENTERING<br />
THE 45½ IN THE DOLLAR RATE AT $ 10,000 AND THE 55½ IN THE DOLLAR<br />
RATE AT $ 16,000. UNDER OUR REFORMS WE REDUCED THAT TO<br />
32½ IN THE DOLLAR AT $ 10,000. THAT RATE CONTINUED RIGHT THROUGH,<br />
AND EVEN WITH THE SURCHARGE, PEOPLE AT $ 10,000 ARE PAYING 10½ IN<br />
THE DOLLAR LESS THAN WITH MR. HAYDEN, AND AT $ 16,000 ARE PAYING MORE<br />
THAN 20½ IN THE DOLLAR LESS. THE SURCHARGE WAS THERE, AND IT<br />
REM-AINS FOR THE REASONS THAT JOHN HOWARD AND MYSELF HAVE<br />
EXPLAINED, BUT LET NOBODY MISS THE POINt TAXES ARE VERY MUCH LOWER<br />
INCO E TAXES THAN THEY WERE, AND IT'S OUR AIM TO KEEP<br />
IT THAT WAY.)<br />
WILLESEE<br />
Equally, they. can't wiss the point that you said that taxes will not<br />
go up, and they did go up.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You're getting again back to the tax indexation side of the argument.<br />
We said that tax indexation will be introduced so that we don't / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
get a continual rip-off in taxatLion through the process<br />
of inflation. If governments want more money, they'll<br />
have to legislate for it. And we never said at some stage that<br />
we might not have to collect more tax to meeL the government's<br />
bills. We've kept a very tight rein on expenditure, as I think<br />
everyone knows, but at the same time, if we've wanted more<br />
revenue, we'Ive had to legislate for it openly and plainly, but none<br />
of that can detract from the fact that income taxes are much,<br />
much lower than they were under the Hayden scales. That was<br />
the main commitment, and that commitment has been fulfilled.<br />
( Deletion : NOW, THE SURCHARGE WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT WE ALSO<br />
SAID THAT WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED THAT IT WOULD BE TEMPORARY AND FOR<br />
REASON \ S THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE* BUDGET IT WASN'T POSSIBLE TO<br />
TAKE THAT OFF ON JULY 1.<br />
AGAIN, THE REASONS FOR THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AND OUR<br />
MAIN COM. 1MITMENT HAS TO BE TOWARDS THE RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEM', ENT, PROPER BUDGETARY MANAGEMENT, BECAUSE IF THE GOVERNMENT<br />
FAILS ON THAT, YOU THEN DISSIPATE THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE<br />
IN GETTING INFLATION DOWN AND IN MAKING AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
COMPETITIVE). ( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
PEOPLE WANT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. I'M JUST TRYING TO<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
I'M GLAD YOU RECOGNISE -THAT.)<br />
( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
I HOPE EVERYONE RECOGNISES THAT. THE RIGHT THING MUST BE DONE.<br />
BUT YOU SEE YOU DID SAY VERY SIMPLY AND BALDLY IN THE ' 77<br />
POLICY SPEECH, THE GOVERNMENT WILL BRING TAXES DOWN FURTHER<br />
AND NOT INCREASE THEM.)<br />
_( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
WE DID BRING THEM DOWN. IN FEBRUARY WE INTRODUCED THOSE NEW<br />
TAX SCALES THEY APPLIED FROM FEBRUARY 1978 AND I'VE INDICATED<br />
TH. P-l PE-DUCTIONS IN TAXATION AT THE $ 10,000 LEVEL ARE MORE<br />
THAN l0 IN THE DOLLAR COMPARED WITH THE HAYDEN SCALES AT THE<br />
$ 16,000 LEVEL, MORE THAN 20 IN THE DOLLAR LESS THAN UNDER THE HAYDEN<br />
SCAL'ES. BY ANY STANDARDS, THAT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION<br />
Willesee It's just such a simple thing. You said you will not increase<br />
them and you did. People get very confused about the economy,<br />
It's very hard for them to follow and they see very simple and bald<br />
statements and they want them to be true and they are not true.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We said we'd introduce new tax scales, we said we'd introduce<br />
lower tax scales and reduce taxes, and we have. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Wil le see<br />
You said you wouldn't increase taxes but you did.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We made it perfectly plain with the introduction of tax<br />
indexation. We said that if governments want more money they'll<br />
have to legislate for it. And so we did.<br />
Willesee<br />
Don't you think that people might look at you now and think,<br />
" Look, he's behaving like a politician. He wants to get the<br />
best out of each answer, which is his right, but he's not facing<br />
up to those basic<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you want to get the best out of each question, and<br />
not recognising the fact that taxes are very much lower than<br />
they have been. You're running the risk of doing what so often<br />
seems to happen when you and I get on an interview you want me<br />
to say something, and you stick on that point, or try to, and<br />
you generally fail to get me to say what you want me to say.<br />
Why should I?<br />
Willeasee<br />
Yes, I do generally fail, but I just feel, in the public interest,<br />
if I put a question that is important, I should get the answer.<br />
Now, I've put to you several times that you said you would not<br />
increase taxes...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
YVou're totally missing whatwe said about tax indexation. Now<br />
I knowA tax indexation is not well understood, but it stops<br />
governments getting the rip-off from continual increases in<br />
taxation as a result of inflation, which means that governments<br />
need more money to meet their bills, they've got to tax for it<br />
and do it plainly, openly and honestly, and that's precisely<br />
what we did.<br />
Will esee<br />
Was it and honest promise wahen you said, " I will not<br />
in--as t-axes'<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
We never gave a blanket commitment not to increase any taxes,<br />
and it would be totally wrong to suggest that we did<br />
Will esee<br />
But that's what you said in your policy speech. </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
we'd introduce company -taxes and we'd increase company taxes<br />
and we have adjusted other elements of taxation because we'd<br />
have to make sure that revenue adequately matches expenditure.<br />
And any government that didn't do that, would be totally irresponsible.<br />
Wil11e see<br />
All right, I give up on that one. At the time of the mini-budget<br />
you said you had to go back on promises, not exactly your<br />
words but that's what you meant, because a lot of things had<br />
changed. At what time did you know things had changed<br />
sufficiently, that you couldn't keep all your promises?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I th 4nk there was a contLinual change probably from about<br />
Noveinzer onwards.<br />
( Deletion: THE RATES WERE SET FOR A NOVEMBER LOAN, AND AT THE<br />
VERY STAME TIME, THERE WERE VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN rIIEPEST RATES IN<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THEN, RIGHT<br />
THROUGH TILL FEBRUARY OR MARCH WE WERE GETTING REVISED ESTIMATES<br />
OF TIHE WHEAT CROP. IT ENDED UP BY BEING DOUBLE THE YEAR BEFORE<br />
AND VERY, VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANYONE HAD EARLIER ANTICIPATED.<br />
BEEF PRICES ROSE MUCH MORE THAN ANYONE HAD EXPECTED AND THEN THE<br />
EVEINTS IN IRAN WHICH LED TO A SHORTAGE OF OIL AND A MUCH<br />
GRE;? ER INCREASE IN OIL. MORE RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASES<br />
AND IMPROVEMENTS IN METAL PRICES.<br />
NOW, MUCH OF THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR FARMERS OR FOR THE BALANCE OF<br />
PAYM ENTS, FOR THE MINING INDUSTRY WITH METAL PRICES, BUT ITS<br />
BAD NEWS FOR THE M-ONEY SUPPLY.)<br />
Will ese e<br />
Prime Minister, if you noticed these changes from about November<br />
as you say, why then at the end of February this year did you<br />
say in a major speech to Parliament " I believe that ' 79 is<br />
the year in which the fruits of our economic policy will become<br />
clearly apparent"?<br />
Prime Ministerrlh of our economic policies are becoming apparent. In<br />
many industries, they're doing very much better than they have<br />
been or many years.. The rural industries are clearly doing<br />
better : and there wouldn't have been of course if inflation had still<br />
bee-n running rampant. Their costs increased 30% in 1974<br />
in one year alone. The trade offensive around the world has<br />
secured much better markets for many of our products. Without<br />
markets they wouldn't be doing well. ( Deletion: MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRY IS MORE COMPETITIVE THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE VERY EARLY<br />
THEY'RE GETTING INTO EXPORT MARKETS, THEIR PROFITS ARE UP<br />
AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. INVESTMENT IS UP VERY GREATLY.<br />
NOW, NONE OF THIS COULD HAVE OCCURRED, NONE OF THIS<br />
WOULD HAVE OCCURRED, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE RIGOUR OF OUR<br />
ECONOMIC POLICIES OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.) ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Willesee Can you understand people being confused when you were so<br />
bouyant about the economy at the end of February, and a couple of<br />
months later you bring in a horror mini-budget, and warn of a<br />
tougher August budget?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A horror mini-budget I think out in the community there is a<br />
very broad acceptance that what was done was necessary because<br />
any government, whether an economy is running well or whether<br />
an economy is running badly, ought to respond to changed<br />
circumstances so that matters keep on a proper path. ( Deletion:<br />
I DON' LIKE BEING TECHNICAL, BUT IF MATTERS OCCUR WHICH ARE GOING<br />
TO AFFECT MONEY SUPPLY SIGNIFICANTLY, IF FACTORS OCCUR WHICH ARE<br />
GOING TO AFFECT INFLATIONARY PRESSURES DURING THE COURSE OF THE<br />
YEAR, THEN QUITE PLAINLY A GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO RESPOND TO THAT.<br />
BUT RESPONDING TO THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING<br />
WELL, DOESN'T MEAN THAT INDUSTRIES AREN'T DOING MUCH<br />
BETTER, DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE BAMANCE OF PAYMENTS ISN'T STRONGER<br />
THAT IT'S BEEN FOR YEARS).<br />
Willesee<br />
When the Whitlam GCverrment had the economic reins and made a<br />
mess, you held them responsible, didn't you?<br />
Prile Minister<br />
Yes, of course.<br />
Willesee Do you think people should hold you responsible for what's<br />
gone wrong now?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Weli, wha-Ts~ gone wrong? The fact that we had to introduce some<br />
measures in May? That's not a sign of something going wrong.<br />
It was a sign as we said on many occasions, we put this<br />
cross on our own backs. ( Deletion: IT W AS A SIGN THAT WE SHOULDN" T HAVE SAID<br />
THAT THAT COMITMENT IN RELATION TO THE SURCHARGE WOULD BE<br />
TEMPORARY. NOW, THAT'S CERTAIN. BUT THE FACT THAT THE WHEAT<br />
HARVEST WAS DOUBLED, MEAT PRICES HAVE GONE UP A GREAT DEAL, THAT<br />
METAL PRICES ARE MUCH MORE BOUYANT NOW THESE ARE THINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE WOL<br />
BELIEVE TO BE GOOD AND DESIRABLE. BUT THEY ALSO IN THE MOVEMENTS,<br />
EXCEEDED WHAT HAD EARLIER BEEN EXPECTED AND WITH THE WAGE INCREASES,<br />
OIL INCREASES, AND BOUYANCY IN A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS, THERE WERE<br />
SIGiS OF RENEWED INFLATIONARY EXPECTATIONS, AND CLEARLY WE HAD<br />
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT.<br />
ALWAYS IN AN ECONOMY, THERE'LL BE CHANGES THROUGHOUT<br />
THE YEAR, AND SOMETIMES A GOVERNMENT MIGHT NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT<br />
BETWEEN AUGUSTS, NOT JUST LEAVE IT TILL THE AUGUST BUDGET. THAT<br />
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG. THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE<br />
TRIMMING YOUR SAILS TO KEEP ON A STEADY COURSE, AND THAT'S WHAT<br />
WE DID.)<br />
Willesee<br />
But there are things wrong you've got an enormous deficit, enormous<br />
unemployment. You told us these things wouldn't happen. If you<br />
go back to 1975, you said, " I'll need three years to right / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Wil11 s C C<br />
the economy, after the mess -the Labor Party has left it in."<br />
Prime Minister<br />
By the end of the third year, on all the surveys that came out<br />
of industry overthe last summer months, and into this year, for the<br />
first time they are looking to the future with confidence.<br />
And they still are.<br />
( Deletion: WILLESE<br />
BUT THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR. YOU'VE HAD TO BREAK PROMISES, YOU'VE<br />
GOT A MASSIVE DEFICIT<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
IS THIS THE FIFTH YEAR?<br />
( Delet.-ion: WILLESEE<br />
' 76, ' 77, ' 78, ' 79 FOURTH YEAR.<br />
( Deletion: PRIMNE MINISTER<br />
YES. THREE AND A HALF YEARS, AND AS WE GO INTO THE<br />
BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH YEAR, AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR,<br />
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT THERE WAS MUCH GREATER VIGOUR<br />
AND LIFE IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS,<br />
BECAUSE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE<br />
RURA-L INDUSTRIES CAN BE PROFITABLE AGAIN, BECAUSE WE HAVE<br />
ESTABLISHED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRY CAN ONCE AGAIN COMPETE IN AUSTRALIA OR AROUND THE WORLD.<br />
NOW NONE OF THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS.<br />
NONE OF THAT MEANS THAT THERE AREN'T STILL THINGS THAT, AS A<br />
GOVERNMENT AND AS A NATION, WE HAVE TO WORK AT. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN<br />
LOOK TO A CIRCUMSTANCE AND SUDDENLY SAY, " WE'LL GO THROUGH<br />
THIS DOOR AND THERE'LL BE NO MORE PROBLEMS, NO MORE DIFFICULTIES",<br />
WELL, LIFE IS NOT LIKE THAT, AND GOVERNMENT IS NOT LIKE THAT<br />
AND I DOUBT IF PRODUCING YOUR SHOW IS LIKE THAT.).<br />
( Deletion: W1ILLESEE<br />
BTT YUiA~ PROMISE IN Y3UR SITUATION, PARTICULARLY AS<br />
PRINLE MINISTER -YOU SAY UNEMPLOYMENT WILL GO DOWN AND<br />
IT GOES UP YOU DONT SAY THAT...<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
WE DISCUSSED THAT EARLIER, AND THROUGH 1978 UNEMPLOYMENT WENT<br />
DOWN MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH. I'VE INDICATED TO YOU THAT<br />
IT DIDN'T GO DOWN ENOUGH ONCE THE NEXT BATCH OF SCHOOL LEAVERS<br />
CAME ONTO THE LABOUR MARKET TO REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER UNEMPLOYED.<br />
I'VE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY, MANY<br />
YEARS, PRIVATE CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN INCREASING, MONTH<br />
BY MONTH, FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS. THAT AGAIN IS AN INDICATION<br />
OF A MORE BOUYANT SITUATION IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, IN<br />
THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.)<br />
Look, its fair enough for you to want to say that things are<br />
all lousy </p>
<p>8<br />
Willesee No, not all lousy, but some things are...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But that's the implication from your question...<br />
Willesee I'm being quite specific unemployment and tax are two very<br />
specific things...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I made the point that taxes are much lower than they were, and<br />
our ceneral thrust is to try and get taxes lower if we can, as<br />
you know.<br />
We've spoken about the unemployment question. In addition to that,<br />
on the wages front, the increases have been much greater than<br />
we would have expected and greater I believe than many people<br />
in the outside world would have expected, or wanted. ( Deletion:<br />
AND TH= AT PLAINLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH IS HOLDING BACK THE<br />
RATE OF RECOVERY W'iTIN THE AUSTALIAN ECONOMY. ALRIGHT, THAT'S NOT<br />
TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT IT DOES POINT TO<br />
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN AUSTRALIA,<br />
OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE GOT THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT POWER BASE AS<br />
THE ARBITRATION COM4ISSION HAS, WHICH CAN EITHER ASSIST THE<br />
PROCESS OF RECOVERY OR INHIBIT IT.)<br />
Willesee<br />
Do you think people regard you as a credible Prime M'inister,<br />
particularly in view of the mini-budget?<br />
Prim. e Minister<br />
I would think so, yes, because as a result of the mini-budget<br />
we've made it perfectly plain that we'll stay on course in<br />
relation to the broad economic policy, that we're going to<br />
continue to bear down on inflation and establish the circumstances<br />
in which Australians can work for the future with a great deal<br />
of confidence. If we hadn't had that mini-budget, people would<br />
have been saying and the economic commentators would have been<br />
sayin-that the August Budget is going to be an impossible one<br />
because the deficit will be too large. There'll be no doubts<br />
about that now.<br />
Wi I -see<br />
There aren't too many people saying that you did the mini-budget<br />
for the wrong reasons they believe you did it for the right<br />
reasons. / 9 </p>
<p>.9-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That's a pretty fair concession on you part.<br />
Will ese e<br />
I think it's a simple fact. No one thinks you did it deliberately<br />
to become unpopular, or to deliberately break promises.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They know that it was unpopular but they also know it was the<br />
right thing for the Australian economy.<br />
Wil leS e<br />
But, to do that, you had to swallow this rather bitter pill of<br />
brea'king promises, and be seen to break promises.<br />
Pri-me Minister<br />
We had to swallow the rather bitter pill in relation to the<br />
surcharge.<br />
Willesee Did you stop and think about that in a personal sense?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Of course I did. One thing you think about it, " why did we<br />
do that in the first place?" Quite clearly we weren't doing it<br />
to box ourselves in a corner in May and establish a commitment<br />
that we wouldn't be able -to meet. So, we thought we were making that<br />
conmitment, we were iraking it, in good faith. We weren' t able to meet it and I<br />
have said before that was a cross that we have to bear, or that I have to bear<br />
( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
HOW DO YOU BEAR THAT CROSS? DOES IT WORRY YOU, FOR EXAMPLE?)<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
IT . DDB/ SN' T HELP Ir-' YOU ALLOW THINGS TO WORRY YOU. YOU'VE GOT<br />
TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT HAPPENS, WHAT YOU DO, THE IMPLICATIONS<br />
OF IT...<br />
( De ~ IL T_ 5E E<br />
DID YOU DISCUSS IT WITH SOME BODY, PRIVATELY?)<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
THESE THINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN CABINET WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES,<br />
OBVIOUSLY. WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A DECISION, THEY'RE CABINET<br />
DECISIONS, GOVERNMENT DECISIONS, NOT FRASER'S DECISIONS HOWEVER<br />
MUCH PEOPLE SOIIETIPIES MIGHT WANT TO SUGGEST THEY ARE.) </p>
<p>10<br />
( Deletion: ILLESEE<br />
BUT DON'T YOU THINK, " ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BELIEVE ME ANY MORE?")<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE A GOVERNMENT THAT<br />
QUITE PATENTLY, IS TAKING THE RIGHT COURSE FOR THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.)<br />
( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
YOU SEEM TO AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY COME BACK TO GOVERNMENT<br />
AND CABINET, BUT THAT WAS A VERY PERSONAL THING, TO BREAK A<br />
PROMISE, WASN'T IT?)<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
LOOK, IT WAS A GOVERNMENT DECISION, INCORPORATED IN THE TREASURER'S<br />
SPEECH, AND CERTAINLY, I'M HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT, IF THEPRE'S A<br />
COMMITMENT OF THAT KIND THAT'S NOT MET, IT GETS TIED ROUND MY<br />
NECK AND PEOPLE TRY TO SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION OF<br />
FRASER'S. BUT IN THE SENSE, THAT IN FACT IT WAS A GOVERNMENT<br />
DECISION, IT MAKES IT A GOVERNMENT MATTER. NOW, IT'S ONLY A<br />
PERSONAL MATTER IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE TRY TO HANG FRASER WITH IT.)<br />
( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
DO YOU TAKE MANY THINGS HOME AT NIGHT, IN A PERSONAL SENSE?<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
NO, I THINK WHEN I LEAVE THIS BUILDING YOU PUT IT BESIDE YOU<br />
BECAUSE THE DAY IS BUSY ENOUGH THERE'S ONE QUESTION, THEN<br />
ANOTER... ( Deletion: WILLESEE<br />
THEPRE MUST BE SOME THINGS THAT GET UNDER YOUR SKIN?)<br />
( Deletion: PRIME MINISTER<br />
THINGS CAN GET UNDER THE SKIN, YES., BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY<br />
THAT I HAVE TO CARRY THEM AROUND WITH ME. I THINK IT'S VERY<br />
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO SHUT DOORS, TO BE ABLE TO, IN THE SENSE OF " THIS<br />
WEEKED IS GOING TO BE SPENT WITH MY FAMILY, I'M GOING TO GET<br />
DOWN ON THE FARM, OR GO FISHING OR WHATEVER". I THINK IF YOU ARE GOING<br />
TO ALLOW A JOB OR A CIRCUMSTANCE TO WORRY YOU, CONCERN YOU,<br />
GET UNDER YOUR SKIN, MAKE YOU FRET ALL THE TIME, THEN IT MAKES<br />
A JOB JUST THAT MUCH HARDER, AND THERE'S NO POINT AT IT BECAUSE<br />
YOU WON'T BE DOING THE JOB ANY BETTER). 000---</p>
