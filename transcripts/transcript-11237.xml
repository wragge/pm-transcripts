    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Steve Waugh on his appointment as Australia's</p>
<p> new cricket captain. It is an excellent choice.</p>
<p>Steve Waugh has made a remarkable contribution to Australian cricket</p>
<p> over a long period. His batting performance has been quite outstanding.</p>
<p>He has worked loyally and studiously with two previous Australian</p>
<p> captains, Allan Border and Mark Taylor. I am sure that he will lead</p>
<p> the Australian test team with great distinction in the West Indies</p>
<p> and in subsequent test series.</p>
<p>I also congratulate Shane Warne on his appointment as Vice Captain.</p>
<p>All Australians will wish the One Day team well in their encounter</p>
<p> with England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne tonight.</p>
<p> 12 February 1999</p>
