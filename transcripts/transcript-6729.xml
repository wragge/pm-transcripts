PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON AM 20 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Warwick Beutler asks the Prime Minister first if, in line with<br />
what he calls his ninth principle oftax reform, this package<br />
has widespread support.<br />
PM: Well, what we were talking about there was a package. Now<br />
you would never have a situation where any package you brought<br />
down it would be -the case that for every single element in the<br />
package that you would have broad community support. You really<br />
had to hav'e-in regard to the fundamentals of your approach,[<br />
broad community support. And that is why Option C failed the test<br />
of principle nine because quite clearly a broad based consumption<br />
tax was a central element of that approach. And it was quite<br />
clear-there wasn't broad community support for that. Now as far<br />
as the capital gains tax in this package is concerned, it is much IF<br />
different from the sort of capital gains that was talked about<br />
and contemplated by many people. And it is our judgment that as<br />
a part of the overall package it will be acceptable. K<br />
BEUTLER: It still does not impress too many people. The initial<br />
reactions aren't all that favourable. The National Party says,<br />
for example, that it will depress<br />
PM: The National Party<br />
BEUTLER: Well, yes,<br />
PM: Come on, the people who advocate flat tax. We are not<br />
suggesting are we, that we take the National Party seriously.<br />
The Liberal Party doesn't take the Naticnal Party seriously,<br />
the National Farmers Federation doesn't take them seriously.<br />
There is virtually no one in the country that takes them<br />
seriously so don't ask me to take seriously an organisation<br />
which is there is no one else in the country that takes them<br />
seriously.<br />
BEUTLER: W6ll, let's talk about the National Farmers Federation.<br />
then they're not terribly pleased with the capital gains tax. They<br />
say it will depress rural land values.<br />
PM: They are wrong because what you have got to appreciate is<br />
that the farmers were talking about a situation where existing<br />
assets would be covered. They were talking before about the<br />
disastrous impact of deeming at death. Now neither of those<br />
situations apply. What people will understand, I believe, and </p>
<p>accept is that while this very modified tax was brought in in<br />
terms of revenue gain, what we have done is to put in a capital gains tax<br />
which by its very existence will mean that we have brought in an<br />
important elemnent in stopping tax avoidance.<br />
BEUTLER: Would you shed too many tears if the Democrats in the<br />
Senate scuttled the capital gains tax proposal?<br />
PM: I don't believe that the Democrats in the Senate would do that.<br />
You are talking about an entirely hypothetical position indeed. I have<br />
only had the opportunity to this point of reading the press release<br />
by Don Chipp and I don't draw the conclusion from what he has said<br />
that that's what they would do. </p>
