    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGO NOT FOR RELEASE BEFORE-9 P. M. ( EST) I<br />FOR PRESS P. M. Nn. 79/ 1965<br />COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE ANNUAL LEAVE<br />Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies</p>
<p><br />The Government has decided not to grant an increaseÂ from three to four weeks in the standard of annuaI leave forÂ cfficers and employees in the Commonwealth Public Service andÂ Commonwealth instrumentalities. The request for four weeks' annual leave was madeÂ to the Government by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, theÂ High Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and theÂ Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations.</p>
<p>The claims by the unions also sought commensurate adjustmentsÂ to all who already receive in excess of three weeks annualÂ leave", for example, shift workers who already receive four weeks'Â annual leave. The Cabinet closely examined the full and carefullyÂ documented case presented to me on Friday 1st October, 1965.</p>
<p>In its view the case for an extra week's leave was not substantiated.</p>
<p><br />In making comparisons between the Cimmonwealth and States,Â and the Commonwealth and other countries, all the facts must beÂ taken into consideration. As an example, although, as pointed outÂ by the deputation, the pub] ic services in a number of overseasÂ countri3s provide for ahditional annual leave based on age, statusÂ or lergth of service, they do not provide for the substantialÂ furlough, or lon-service leave, entitlements which are availableÂ in the Commonwealth Service and also in other public services inÂ Australia. If an extra week's leave for the total staff inÂ Commonwealth employment were granted, an additional 5,800 workers<br />would be needed. This would increase the annual wage and salary<br />bill of the Commonwealth by about Å 9M. For example in the<br />P. M. G.' s Department alone, an extra week's leave would require an<br />additional 1,650 employees estimated to cost Å 2.35M. a year.<br />Export inspection services in the Department of Primary Industry<br />are another example the Deoartment would have to increase its<br />demands on the already very limited community resources of<br />veterinarians and qualified meat and dairy inspectors. Similar<br />difficulties would arise in other areas of Commonwealth employment,<br />for example Repatriation services, defence oroduction factories,<br />airlines, etc. An increase in annual leave to Commonwealth<br />employees almost certainly would have repercussions throughout<br />the community. It , uould undoubtedly be of great significance not<br />only to State and local governments but also to private employers.<br />The granting of the additional leave must have the<br />effect of increasing the amount of overtime worked at a time when<br />overtime is already excessive and additional demands for labour<br />must increase the pressure on wages and prices as competition<br />for labour becomesmnre intense.</p>
<p><br />In order to Ifset the 1ls of ne week's work by<br />the 5.4 million civilian employees ( excluding II. S. W. Government<br />workers who already have four weeks' leave), it would be necessary<br />to recruit some 75,000 additional workers. This would be well Aikh<br />impossible as there are very few untapped resources of labour a<br />the moment. At the end of August 56690 people were registerd<br />for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service and zhbre<br />were 47,600 unfilled vacancies.<br />CANBERRA, 14th October, 1965.</p>
