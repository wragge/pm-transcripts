    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is it becoming Government policy to criticise the Reserve</p>
<p> Bank for its decisions on interest rates given the comments by Mr Reith,</p>
<p> Gary Nairn and David Hawker?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Reserve Bank independently sets interest rates. I heard Mr</p>
<p> Reith this morning and I thought he was just saying what I guess everybody</p>
<p> feels and that is they'd rather the interest rate rise not occur.</p>
<p> I think it is important to understand that the Reserve Bank sets interest</p>
<p> rates and the Reserve Bank gave an explanation as to why interest rates</p>
<p> were adjusted. People have argued that you should have an independent</p>
<p> Reserve Bank and I guess the flip side of the coin is that from time to</p>
<p> time if the bank is regarded as independent, people feel they have some</p>
<p> capacity to express a view. I think we should all be mature enough to</p>
<p> recognise that. I think interest rate adjustments are sensitive issues</p>
<p> and I think everybody has to behave in a sensitive manner and I don't</p>
<p> think the perception that, inaccurate though it is, the perception that</p>
<p> interest rates are driven by the strength of the economy in one part of</p>
<p> Australia, namely Sydney, is helped by the imagery of people in the dealing</p>
<p> room of a bank cheering the announcement of a rise in official interest</p>
<p> rates. That's seems a very insensitive, negative signal to people</p>
<p> in the regions of this country who are struggling. I think everybody has</p>
<p> got to understand that perception in these things is very important and</p>
<p> the view that the equilibrium of monetary policy is an important thing,</p>
<p> and it is, has to be tempered with a recognition that at the sharp end</p>
<p> people who are struggling lament very much any upward movement in interest</p>
<p> rates. That's if you are a borrower. But I have to say that a few</p>
<p> self-funded retirees have said to me today that they are not the least</p>
<p> bit unhappy about the adjustment in interest rates.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you see Mr Reith's view that the interest rate rise of 50 bases</p>
<p> points will hurt small business?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Reith was echoing the views of small business as it came to</p>
<p> him. Well, I don't think you can make that definitive judgement on</p>
<p> that until you see things working their way through. My view is that the</p>
<p> Australian economy is very strong, it's not overheating. I would</p>
<p> expect there to continue to be quite strong employment growth and a quite</p>
<p> strong contribution from the small business sector. But I go back to the</p>
<p> point I was seeking to make a moment ago that the national prosperity</p>
<p> is being felt in most parts of the country but in some it isn't.</p>
<p> And it's very important that people understand the perception of</p>
<p> these things and that I don't think it's particularly positive</p>
<p> for people to be cheering the announcement of an interest rate rise. And</p>
<p> if financial institutions worry about their image perhaps they should</p>
<p> look at things like that as one of the reasons why some people in the</p>
<p> community feel that there is an insensitivity on their part to the difficulties</p>
<p> of others.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>They seem to be suggesting [inaudible]...we were right, you were wrong.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what the circumstance was. What the explanation</p>
<p> was in a sense is immaterial. What is important is the impact it has on</p>
<p> the rest of the community. I don't think it helps the image of the</p>
<p> financial community to have people in the dealing room cheering about</p>
<p> an increase in interest rates. I think it's really quite counterproductive.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the Murdoch media's ferocious anti-GST campaign hurting the Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in the end whether any campaign hurts the Government or not is</p>
<p> a matter for the Australian people. I am not going to get into the business</p>
<p> of whether something is hurting the Government or not. I would imagine</p>
<p> that when it's all shaken down people will make the judgement and</p>
<p> I will accept that verdict. I think sections of that campaign are unreasonable.</p>
<p> I can think of, sort of, successive front pages which, well at least two</p>
<p> of the cases, where an advert in relation to the impact of the GST, for</p>
<p> example, the impact on season tickets for the Australian football league,</p>
<p> that was demonstrated within an hour to be inaccurate. I think there has</p>
<p> been a bit of a campaign on that issue but we'll leave it at that.</p>
<p> But, you know, I am not...put it in context, as I indicated last night</p>
<p> if I think treatment of an issue by a newspaper or a radio station or</p>
<p> a television statement is unfair I'll say so. I was critical yesterday</p>
<p> of the Sydney Morning Herald's treatment of the Job Network</p>
<p> story so I don't think you should get over excited about my reference</p>
<p> to the Murdoch press.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you personally angered by the treatment of your son [inaudible]...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, I'd prefer at the moment not to say anything publicly</p>
<p> about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think is motivating them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well, you are employed by them, so you should ask them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think it is payback for the digital decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, come on, we are lapsing in the balm of Maclean sunlight into all</p>
<p> sorts of things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>CARE Australia, is their reputation as a humanitarian aid organisation</p>
<p> damaged?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I haven't looked into all of that. I'd be very surprised</p>
<p> if the enormous good work that CARE does is dented by this, I'd be</p>
<p> very surprised. But look, I don't pretend to have looked into it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you accept that your Government's decision in 1996 [inaudible]</p>
<p> regional affairs department has had an adverse...[inaudible] of providing</p>
<p> services to the bush?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I don't think in the sweep of things it has because it was part</p>
<p> of getting a budget in order which has got interest rates down and strengthened</p>
<p> the national economy. You have got to put that into balance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I stress...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, not necessarily.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but that doesn't mean that that was its function. I mean,</p>
<p> decisions made by individual departments have a greater impact on services</p>
<p> in the bush than decisions made by a department rejoicing in the name</p>
<p> of regional services.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think the cuts [inaudible]...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh Michelle, I don't for a moment think that the cuts made in the</p>
<p> 1996 Budget went too far, I think that the cuts made in the 1996 Budget</p>
<p> put this nation in very good shape. And I am dealing with the here and</p>
<p> now and the here and now is that there is a concern about maintaining</p>
<p> existing services and there's a desire where it's possible to</p>
<p> do so to improve the quality of service delivery.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is this latest interest rate rise going to cut into</p>
<p> your personal income tax cut when the GST comes into effect?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no, it doesn't affect the personal income tax cuts in any</p>
<p> way. Even after these increases the average mortgagor in this country,</p>
<p> the average homebuyer will be $266 a month better off than he or she was</p>
<p> in 1996 when Mr Keating was voted out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the 80 per cent of income earners below $50,000 a year are they going</p>
<p> to have their tax cuts now reduced because of the interest rate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, the tax cuts are unaffected. I mean, interest rates can rise or they</p>
<p> can fall but the tax cuts are unaffected.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And do the fuel excise increases make it any more difficult for the Government</p>
<p> to deliver on its promise post-GST of the petrol price decrease or that</p>
<p> petrol prices need not rise after this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, that's unaffected by that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I just ask one question on Telstra. The Communications Authority</p>
<p> has announced an inquiry into the new mobile phone technology, CDMA in</p>
<p> response to numerous concerns mainly from the bush. Does that hamper or</p>
<p> undermine your campaign to try and sell the remaining 50.1%?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER :</p>
<p>No, no I think it reinforces how serious we are about seeing that there</p>
<p> are adequate services provided in the bush. I think that is a demonstration</p>
<p> of our concern. Thank you.</p>
