  I am pleased to announce that the Government will provide up to $380</p>
<p> million of Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) credit</p>
<p> insurance to the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) under the National Interest</p>
<p> provisions of the EFIC Act.</p>
<p>  This will be provided to the AWB for the balance of its 1998 wheat</p>
<p> sales to Indonesia. The availability of the insurance cover will depend</p>
<p> on the finalisation of a sovereign guarantee from the Indonesian Government.</p>
<p>  The decision demonstrates the Government's commitment to help</p>
<p> Australian farmers and exporters maintain traditional markets and</p>
<p> protect Australian jobs, in the face of the current Asian economic</p>
<p> turmoil.</p>
<p>  Australia has been the largest supplier of wheat to Indonesia in the</p>
<p> past few years and the provision of this insurance cover is crucial</p>
<p> to maintaining Australia's market share, particularly in light</p>
<p> of the potential for increased credit based competition from United</p>
<p> States and Canadian suppliers.</p>
<p>  In a climate where food prices in Indonesia have doubled in some cases</p>
<p> or even tripled, this decision also stands as a clear statement of</p>
<p> the Government's support for the Indonesian people.</p>
<p>  Maintaining adequate supplies of food and other essential commodities</p>
<p> is vital to preserving stability in Indonesia and restoring health</p>
<p> to the Indonesian economy. EFIC credit insurance provides the certainty</p>
<p> necessary for Australia-Indonesia trade to continue.</p>
