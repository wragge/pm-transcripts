EXTRACTS OF PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALBANY, 18 OCTOBER 1984<br />
.3OUURNALIST Mr Hawke will you say now no capital gains tax after<br />
the election. I will say what I have said consistently7 that we will have<br />
a total review of the tax system. The same way as the Liberals have<br />
said there should be a total review. And within that review We<br />
cannot pre-empt discussion about a capital gains tax. But there<br />
is no, there is no plan, to introduce a capital gains tax or any<br />
other form of tax. What there is an intention to do, as distinct<br />
from the Liberals who surreptitiously say that a capital gains tax<br />
is an inevitable part of tax reform, we are saying nothing is<br />
inevitable, there will be a total review. We'll talk to the<br />
community, the business community, the trade unions, the Taxpayers'*<br />
Association and welfare organisations. And it would be improper<br />
for me to say now thaL we would not allow any issue to be canvassed<br />
in that discussion. But the distinction between us and the Liberals<br />
is that you know that you can trust us as to the way we'll go about<br />
it. They have shown that they'll say one thing in an election and<br />
after that election break that position absolutely.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you agree with Senator Button's<br />
perspective that there will be budgetary problems next year, arnd<br />
more specifically that those problems will result in intolerable<br />
pressure for new taxes or stronger existing ones.<br />
No, there will be no intolerable pressure for new taxes.<br />
I'm glad you asked the question in regard to Senator Button's<br />
comments in this area of the Budget. What I and the Treasurer have<br />
said consistently from the time that we came into office is that<br />
we would not be able in one Budget or in two Budgets to rectify the<br />
Oconomic chaos that we inherited to get Australia on the path<br />
of stable, sustained long-term recovery of a non-inflationary kind.<br />
And we've said we're going t~ o have to continue in Budget after<br />
Budget to implement Policies which will ensure the achievement of<br />
that objective. Now I want to point out what we've done in that<br />
regard. Because if youtre going to in an election period compare<br />
and contrast the two Parties that are asking for the support of<br />
Government in this area, You've got to look at the facts of what<br />
has been done and then say on that basis what is likely for the<br />
future. Now what was the position under the Liberal National<br />
Party when they were in, in their last two years in regard to their<br />
Budget? In 1981/ 82 their estimate was for a neutral budget<br />
outcome a nil deficit. It in fact blew out to half a billion<br />
dollars. In the last year, 82-83, they budgetted for a deficit of<br />
$ 1.7 billion. It in fact blew out to $ 4.5 billion. Tn other words<br />
in their last two years a blow-out of their Budget deficit of $ 3.* 3<br />
billion that was their last two years a blow-out of the defi&amp; t.<br />
In the last year 16increase in the deficit. Now what have we<br />
dono. We in fact in our first year cut back'from have cut back from<br />
the $ 9.6 billion that was in the offing then and budgetted for a<br />
deficit of not the $ 9.6 billion, but $ 8.4 billion. Now we not only </p>
<p>2.<br />
P. M. cont...: ahieved that but we came in under, came in under &gt; ur<br />
deficit. It was $ 7.9 billion. So we were half a billion dollar<br />
Sunder. In this year we have budgetted for $ 6.7 billion and we will<br />
achieve that. So in our two years we will have reduced the deficit<br />
by $ 2.9 billion against their blow-out. Now what I've said for the<br />
future and what the Treasurer has said for the future is that in<br />
this next year we will do these things and it's consistent with<br />
our record. Firstly, there will be a further lowering of the<br />
deficit. Secondly, that will be achieved with no overall increase<br />
in the level of taxes. And thirdly, and essentially which follows<br />
as a matter of economic logic, that will be done and can only be<br />
done on the basis that the rate of growth of expenditures will be<br />
less than the rate of economic growth. Now we don't go into this<br />
election with hypocrisy and conjured up flat-earth economics.<br />
Mr Peacock is talking about vast increases in expenditures, tax cuts<br />
and a lower deficit. You can't do that. What we do is to say we<br />
have in fact reduced the deficit. We have in fact reduced income<br />
taxes. We will continue to do that. Now thos'e are the realities.<br />
And I say all of that in the context that we will continue<br />
obviously as a Government to have to address ourselves carefully<br />
as we have done to these Budgetary problems. We inherited chaos<br />
and the greatest depression since the great depression. We've had<br />
to turn that round, we've done it, but we've done it in a way which<br />
has involved reductions in the deficit, no increases in the overall<br />
level of taxation. We'll continue to doit. And'our record in this<br />
area will stand up in any debate, any analysis, against the<br />
Opposition. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given that you say you're not goling<br />
to pre-empt the decision on taxation reform can you see political<br />
danger of allowing an issue like capital gains to exist. Because<br />
people in the community don't really know how it effects them<br />
Well I'm grateful for that question. The danger in this area<br />
is not from us, but from the Opposition. Now I am not saying that<br />
there will be a capital gains tax, but what we can say in respect<br />
of capital gains, that we have made certain principles quite clear<br />
as to a capital gains tax if there were to be one. As far as the<br />
Labor Party is concerned, if there were to be a capital gains tax<br />
we've made it crystal clear that the family home would never be part<br />
of a capital gains tax. Secondly, that in a situation of a capital<br />
gains tax there would be offsets of capital losses against capital<br />
gains. It would apply only to realised capital gains.. So in respect<br />
of that area it's quite clear for the great majority of people if<br />
there were to be a capital gains, we've spelt out the principles<br />
that would have to apply. But what about the Liberals. They have<br />
said quite clearly that a capital gains tax will be an inevitable<br />
part of any review they have to take. That's what they've said.<br />
That's what their analaysts have said. Don't take any account of<br />
what Mr Peacock or Mr Howard may say on Monday bedause that will<br />
be just as much a fraud in 1984 as what they said in 1977. They<br />
have said a capital gains tax is inevitable. That's what their<br />
backroom boys and their advisers say, and that's what Mr Howard<br />
believes. But what do we know about their capital gains tax.<br />
Would the family home be free and exempt under a Liberal's capital<br />
gains tax. We don't know, because they won't come clean about any<br />
part of their thinking. So the family home may get caught under<br />
a Liberal capital gains tax. They may not allow an offset of capital<br />
losses against capital gains. That's the difference between Labor<br />
and the Liberals. They will have one, but you don't know anything<br />
about it. What it will catch. Who it will catch. What the net </p>
<p>3.<br />
P. M. cont...: will be. under us we say in the review, capital gains<br />
will be one of the things thiat's looked at. And at least you know<br />
in respect of Labor the principles that would be involved if it were<br />
to be implemented.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( H-ywood, inaudible view on capital gains tax).<br />
No I'm not exercising a personal view. And I'll tell You<br />
why I'm not, is that if in fact you're going to allow the<br />
community and its various organisations to have a free and open<br />
analysis and debate and discussion, it's better in those<br />
circumstances, I think, that you don't try and pre-empt. And the<br />
other thing, and I say this quite frankly, I want myself to have<br />
my mind informed by the public debate because you may have a view.<br />
for instance, and it's a theoretically correct view, that without<br />
a capital gains tax you may not have all the instruments necossariy<br />
to completely wipe out the tax avoidance industry. I mean that,<br />
as you know Greg is one of the arguments that's put forward in<br />
favour of a capital gains tax. That wihtout a capital gains tax<br />
you can't have a totally effective armoury against the tax<br />
avoidance industry. But it may be that in the debate and the<br />
analysis that there are other ways in which you can be sure that<br />
that would arise. Because'what you've got to remember is that a<br />
capital gains tax would not be d significant source of revenue.<br />
It is regarded by those who advocate i~ t as desirable basically as<br />
an anti-tax avoidance instrument rather than as a significant source<br />
of revenue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you put a lot of emphasis in your taxation<br />
statements... do you think it's poSsible to hdve a fair and.<br />
eq~ uitable tax system without some system of death duties?<br />
I think that's possible,* yes. And I'm glad you raised the<br />
question of fairness and equity. In the taxation roview that we<br />
are going openly to conduct and invite evoryone to participate in,<br />
I want the community to know that the twin criteria that will inform<br />
the minds of my Government will be fairness or equity, if you liko,<br />
-and efficiency. Those are the criteria. We say to the people of<br />
Australia that after all these years no-one says that the existing<br />
tan system is fair or that it's the most efficient system. So we<br />
want a fair system. And we have shown by our achievements and<br />
commitments that we can be trusted in this area. The Liberals cannot, </p>
