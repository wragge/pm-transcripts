CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL HOUSING CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA 13 MARCH 1989<br />
I want first of all to congratulate the organisers of this<br />
conference. You have rightly recognised the importance of housing as an<br />
issue important to the economy, and important to<br />
Australian families and your meeting, very appropriately,<br />
coincides with the recent upsurge in the community's concern<br />
about the future of housing in Australia.<br />
That community concern is rooted in a number of factors,<br />
some of them seeming paradoxes.<br />
In a year when the housing industry is working at virtually<br />
its maximum capacity, many people, including young couples<br />
starting out in life, are finding home ownership beyond<br />
them. Booming house prices are creating two classes of<br />
Australians: those who, in owning a home, are sitting<br />
inside what in some cases is a spectacularly improving<br />
asset; and those who don't own a home and who feel they are<br />
missing out.<br />
Some people are struggling, in a period of temporarily high<br />
interest rates, to meet their home loan payments to the<br />
banks and building societies. They despair that they are,<br />
in an all-too-literal sense of the word, mortgaging their<br />
futures.<br />
But more disturbing still is the plight of those who aspire,<br />
in vain, not to home ownership, but to the more basic<br />
requirement of a roof over their heads.<br />
At a time of record Government spending on public housing,<br />
too many people even, tragically, including young<br />
teenagers are sleeping in the streets.<br />
So the questions being asked throughout the community about<br />
the future of housing are important questions and I hope<br />
that conferences such as this will be able to contribute to<br />
the continuing process of developing answers to them. </p>
<p>For the Government's part, we saw, just over a week ago, the<br />
convening of a special Premiers' Conference which focused<br />
attention on the important issues surrounding the supply<br />
side of the question.<br />
Given the rough and tumble nature of politics the<br />
constructive attitudes that the Premiers brought to this<br />
meeting bode very well for the development of useful and<br />
meaningful solutions on this supply side of the housing<br />
equation. I want initially to outline to you my perspective on the<br />
importance of the housing industry in Australia's growing<br />
economy. Put simply, we can't look at any single feature of the<br />
housing issue in isolation.<br />
Housing is a very large sector of the national economy.<br />
It makes a strong, and an increasingly strong, contribution<br />
to gross domestic product.<br />
And as an employer, the housing and construction industry<br />
provides jobs and income security for more than half a<br />
million Australians.<br />
Investment in housing which includes new dwellings as well<br />
as the burgeoning market in alterations and renovations<br />
accounts for between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent of total<br />
GDP. Over the year to the 1988 September quarter, real housing<br />
investment grew by an astonishing 25 per cent.<br />
In that period, real GDP grew by 2.9 per cent. Just over<br />
one-third of that total increase in GDP came from housing<br />
investment. This considerable contribution of course reflects the strong<br />
upturn in new dwelling starts that has occurred since the<br />
beginning of 1987/ 88.<br />
The Indicative Planning Council forecasts around 165,000<br />
commencements in 1988-89 up by more than one-fifth on the<br />
previous year.<br />
This will bring the annual average number of new starts over<br />
the years of my Government to around 140,000 compared with<br />
around 129,500 a year in the Fraser years. On average<br />
around 10,000 more new dwellings are being built every year<br />
over the whole life of this Government than under the<br />
previous Government.<br />
Next year, according to the Indicative Planning Council, we<br />
should see about 142,000 starts still above the 140,000<br />
average achieved under my Government. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
By a ny standards, the Housing industry is a giant of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
I want today to outline some of the challenges that this<br />
giant is going to have to face over the coming years not<br />
to imply that the industry alone bears the responsibility<br />
for the resolution of these challenges, but to urge you, and<br />
the broader community, to recognise them and to begin<br />
working together to meet them.<br />
Some of these challenges are all-too-familiar. Some I think<br />
have not yet received the attention they deserve, from<br />
within the industry or within the broader community.<br />
Let me begin by sketching in the background in particular,<br />
the implications of the current boom in housing prices and<br />
the related question of high interest rates.<br />
A few years ago, before financial deregulation, controls on<br />
mortgage interest rates meant that the supply of housing<br />
finance was closely linked with Government monetary policy.<br />
This meant there was a marked cycle to the availability of<br />
home finance: when monetary policy was relaxed, finance was<br />
plentiful; when it was tight, finance was scarce.<br />
In those days, the key constraint on efficient activity in<br />
the housing industry was not, as it is today, the supply of<br />
resources, but the housing finance constraint, with this<br />
cycle of plenty and scarcity.<br />
The resultant inefficiencies were staggering. whenever the<br />
industry had geared up for a peak in activity, there was a<br />
collapse. Thousands of skilled workers lost their jobs and<br />
left the industry. Thousands more had to be trained for the<br />
next peak.<br />
Financial deregulation has changed all of this, because<br />
interest rates can now adjust to bring the supply and demand<br />
for housing finance to equilibrium.<br />
This has led to an unprecedented period of stability in the<br />
flow of finance to the housing industry.<br />
But it has also of course created the potential for people<br />
to be squeezed by periods when interest rates are high.<br />
That is what we are seeing at present, but it must be kept<br />
in perspective.<br />
Over the twelve months to January, median housing prices<br />
increased Australia-wide by some 40 per cent, with increases<br />
in Sydney and Perth of some 60 per cent.<br />
over roughly the same period of time, interest rates have<br />
increased from around 14 per cent to around 15 per cent an<br />
increase of about 7 per cent. </p>
<p>That seven per cent increase is roughly in line with the<br />
increase in average weekly earnings.<br />
In other words, the massive lift in housing prices reflects<br />
the simplest lesson of a supply and demand curve that even<br />
with the massive output of the housing industry at present,<br />
supply of housing has not kept pace with demand.<br />
That is why, as I have said on a number of occasions, an<br />
artificial reduction in housing interest rates, while it<br />
might make it easier in the short run for people to pay<br />
their mortgages, would not solve the overall imbalance in<br />
supply and demand.<br />
Indeed it would worsen the imbalance, putting further upward<br />
pressure on house prices.<br />
I make this point about interest rates, too.<br />
It is wrong, both economically and socially, to make a<br />
simple comparison between the current level of interest<br />
rates in a deregulated environment and the alleged good old<br />
days when there was a fixed ceiling on rates of<br />
13.5 per cent.<br />
We must remember that the 13.5 per cent housing loans rarely<br />
cov-ered the full purchase price, and had to be topped up<br />
with ' cocktail' loans that attracted interest rates much<br />
higher than those that now generally prevail.<br />
I don't seek to run away from the fact that housing interest<br />
rates are causing distress out there in the community.<br />
No Government wants interest rates a point higher than<br />
absolutely necessary especially this Government, whose<br />
highest priority has been, ultimately, the protection of the<br />
living standards of ordinary Australians. Interest rates<br />
will have to stay high to reduce spending on imports. But<br />
as soon as it's economically responsible to reduce them, it<br />
will be done.<br />
The present degree of monetary policy tightness, coupled<br />
with continuing tight fiscal policy and a responsible wages<br />
policy, will be sufficient to restore the economy to a<br />
sustainable level of demand growth that is, a level which<br />
will permit good progress in reducing our current account<br />
deficit relative to our GDP.<br />
I have already mentioned that housing activity is forecast<br />
to fall. overall, I am confident that demand pressures will<br />
moderate over calendar 1989. That will create some scope<br />
for moderation in interest rate pressures.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Demand for housing will remain strong for some time to come.<br />
The Indicative Planning Council suggests there will be about<br />
153,000 new starts a year for the next five years. </p>
<p>If action is not taken now to improve the supply of<br />
resources to the industry, housing prices will continue to<br />
increase and more people will find houses unaffordable.<br />
None of us can accept that.<br />
So we must tackle the longer-term supply questions.<br />
The first challenge therefore that I wish to address today<br />
concerns the supply of suitable housing land.<br />
Australia is one of the most urbanised nations in the world.<br />
Our capital cities have grown so much that land that was<br />
once on the outskirts is now being advertised in the Real<br />
Estate pages as inner city. Clearly, we need to reassess<br />
the use we make of our scarce urban land.<br />
In many senses this is a special challenge for Government<br />
because rising land prices have already transformed most of<br />
the private sector's land holdings from vacant lots into<br />
shopping centres, factories and houses.<br />
Governments, both Commonwealth and State, have been slower<br />
to reassess the use of their sometimes extensive city land<br />
holdings. The Commonwealth has now done this seriously. At the<br />
Premiers' Conference, the Federal Government announced a<br />
major program of land releases for housing development<br />
around 27,000 blocks, the equivalent of 15 new suburbs, over<br />
the next five years.<br />
In the following five years, a further 31,000 blocks will be<br />
released.<br />
This is a significant step forward, and I pay tribute to the<br />
Housing Industry Association for the role it played in<br />
stimulating this issue and identifying some of these blocks.<br />
I now urge other Governments in Australia to follow the<br />
example set by the Commonwealth.<br />
A second challenge relates to another supply issue the<br />
supply of skilled labour through improved housing industry<br />
training. I referred earlier to the effects of financial deregulation,<br />
particularly on lessening substantially the boom and bust<br />
cycle that previously used to plague the housing industry.<br />
I hope in this new environment, now more conducive to long<br />
run planning, that long term solutions to our training needs<br />
will be found.<br />
Recent sharp increases in subcontracting costs for some<br />
trades show that skilled labour is now, as it has been, in<br />
short supply. </p>
<p>In Sydney, rates for bricklayers increased by more than<br />
per cent between 1987 and late 1988.<br />
The Federal Government recently concluded arrangements with<br />
the New South Wales division of the Housing Industry<br />
Association which provided for the immigration of up to 225<br />
building trades workers before mid-1990. This arrangement<br />
involves an increased apprenticeship training commitment by<br />
the industry.<br />
In February we began consultation with industry groups, the<br />
HIA, the ACTU and building unions with a view to developing<br />
a national arrangement along similar lines.<br />
But more needs to be done. The challenge must be taken up<br />
by industry and unions.<br />
A third challenge concerns the vexing question of developing<br />
more innovative pattern to our housing development.<br />
As our cities continue to sprawl, there is a lot of people<br />
for whom the attainment of a house on a suburban block comes<br />
not only at a high price in dollar terms but also at too<br />
high a social price: isolation, distance from transport and<br />
other amenities, length of commuter travel times.<br />
Having acknowledged these problems, however, we must<br />
remember that ours is a unique way of life.<br />
Foreign visitors to Australia often comment with awe on the<br />
quality of life generated by our deep-seated preference for<br />
separate houses each occupying quarter-acre blocks in suburb<br />
after green leafy suburb.<br />
And it is true that Australian suburbs provide a quality of<br />
life which is the envy of much of the world.<br />
we should be jealous of our achievement. We do not want, in<br />
Australia, to duplicate the failures of inner city Tokyo,<br />
London or New York.<br />
We need a uniquely Australian solution to these issues.<br />
We need to ensure that we are not creating a millstone<br />
around our necks by requiring, as many local zoning and<br />
other regulations virtually do, that no housing pattern<br />
other than the quarter-acre block is allowed to exist in our<br />
cities. It is this kind of thinking which lies behind the Green<br />
Street Project or, to give it its formal title, the Joint<br />
Venture for More Affordable Housing. This is a co-operative<br />
program, run by industry and the Federal, State and Local<br />
Governments, which has been particularly effective at<br />
demonstrating that a wider range of housing choices exists,<br />
and that more innovative building and land development<br />
techniques can usefully be employed. </p>
<p>Its success is measured by the savings of up to 24 per cent<br />
which have been achieved on house and land development.<br />
But, again, more needs to be done.<br />
At the recent Special Premiers' Conference, the Commonwealth<br />
announced a package of five measures costing an estimated<br />
$ 8.8 million over the next three years.<br />
These measures are:<br />
first, a three year program to redress inadequacies in<br />
the availability of data on land supply and the<br />
composition of demand;<br />
second, a joint program under which financial and<br />
technical assistance will be provided over the next<br />
three years to Local Government for a review of<br />
technical residential land development regulations;<br />
third, a program to promote improvement in the<br />
administrative aspects of approval processes at local<br />
government level, which will include demonstration<br />
studies, research and information dissemination;<br />
fourth, the setting up of an expert task force to<br />
examine the scope for significant reforms of technical<br />
regulation of building codes and standards, which will<br />
draw on the Commonwealth, State and Local Government,<br />
the design professions and the building industry; and<br />
finally, the promotion of analysis and policy<br />
development in relation to housing supply within the<br />
Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce.<br />
These measures will, I hope, provide a necessary framework<br />
within which innovative design can flourish. It is then up<br />
to you, the people involved in all aspects of the industry,<br />
to provide the practical ground-level solutions.<br />
At the same time, as we begin to formulate answers to this<br />
third challenge, we must recognise a fourth: that new<br />
patterns of life are being created by technological growth<br />
and the changing nature of Australian society and industry.<br />
High technology may have a profound impact on the kinds of<br />
housing people might choose in two decades time.<br />
New developments in transport, such as the proposed very<br />
Fast Train, may make it possible for people to commute to<br />
city centres more rapidly from much further away.<br />
Computers and new communications equipment may actually<br />
reduce the need for people to travel to city centres at all;<br />
they are certainly making it possible for major corporate<br />
offices to operate in a small town or provincial centre<br />
instead of in the middle of a capital city. </p>
<p>At the same time, let us recognise early that an<br />
increasingly prosperous Australia, and an Australia that is<br />
attracting increasing numbers of tourists from overseas, is<br />
going to have to provide recreational accommodation in<br />
unprecedented numbers.<br />
Let us make sure that this is provided in a way that our<br />
coastlines, our mountains, our deserts are not vandalised by<br />
insensitive development that allows a well-off minority to<br />
despoil the natural beauty which is the heritage of us all.<br />
Finally, my fifth challenge is that we must ensure that<br />
decent, affordable housing is within the means of all<br />
Australians. This is a challenge to us all.<br />
And at each level of the community's housing needs, the<br />
Federal Government is proud of its record of assistance and<br />
leadership.<br />
We have offered an additional $ 40m over 3 years to the<br />
States under the Supported Accommodation Assistance program<br />
to provide additional and improved services for the<br />
homeless.<br />
-To assist the large number of Australians whose incomes are<br />
below the level necessary to achieve home ownership in the<br />
-private market place, we have doubled funding for public<br />
housing in real terms in the five years to 1987-88 compared<br />
to the previous five years to 1982-83.<br />
And for young home buyers, the First Home Owners Scheme is<br />
widely regarded as the most successful home ownership<br />
assistance scheme ever introduced. From October 1983 to<br />
February 1989, FHOS assisted over 320,000 households into<br />
home ownership at a cost of $ 1.4 billion.<br />
And FHOS continues to help people achieve home ownership.<br />
Around 42,000 applications will be approved this year down<br />
somewhat on the 54,000 applications approved last year but<br />
about the same number as was approved in 1986-87.<br />
I have mentioned the Indicative Planning Council's measure<br />
of underlying demand for housing starts at 153,000 per year.<br />
At the current approval rates, FHOS accounts for over a<br />
quarter of this group a wide coverage by any standard.<br />
Another important recent initiative was the establishment of<br />
the National Review of Housing Policy in June 1988. This<br />
review, being conducted by my colleague Peter Staples, the<br />
Minister for Housing and Aged Care, will assess the<br />
performance of housing assistance programs and develop<br />
strategies for improving these programs. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The Australian dream of a home of one's own is still a<br />
desirable one, and it is still an attainable one.<br />
It is still part of the promise of life in this great<br />
country of ours.<br />
We must not let the peak of the house price cycle convince<br />
us otherwise.<br />
But as Australia develops, so must our strategies for<br />
realising the dream.<br />
My Government's commitment to housing is deep and long<br />
standing, we have a proud record in housing because we<br />
have kept our sights on finding the proper longterm<br />
solutions, not the wrong, short-term, knee-jerk reactions.<br />
Through financial deregulation, we have taken the most<br />
important step possible towards ending the boom-bust nature<br />
of housing. Effective housing planning can now take place.<br />
We have dramatically improved access to affordable housing<br />
for all Australians.<br />
And those efforts have now been supplemented by supply side<br />
measures. I have tried to indicate today the range of challenges<br />
facing us in the future.<br />
But if we are to be successful in meeting any of those<br />
challenges we will need co-operation and commitment from all<br />
of us: the Commonwealth, States and Local Government,<br />
industry, unions, planners, architects and others.<br />
In declaring this Conference open I can do no better than to<br />
wish you success in finding common ground and building that<br />
co-operation. </p>
