NATIONAL PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON : PRIME MINISTER'S OPENING ADDRESS<br />
MAY 1974<br />
Mr. President, your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
Please forgive me if I'm not too formal. I have no text to<br />
declaim to you. I will make some preliminary observations<br />
and then whether I like it or not I'll have to answer your<br />
questions. I gather that on previous speeches in this particular round<br />
there have been a great number of references to economic<br />
affairs. I shall quote from a part of your newspapers<br />
tomorrow morning which you won't be writing yourselves.<br />
It's a letter from economists a majority of the professors<br />
and staff in economic faculties right round Australia. It<br />
states, since the present government won office, Australia<br />
has witnessed several significant changes in economic policy.<br />
The government has, for instance, revalued the currency, cut<br />
tariffs across the hoard, increased interest rates and<br />
substantially reduced the alarming growth in the money supply.<br />
Inflation has, of course, been the major concern of economic<br />
management for the government. The rapid increase in prices<br />
has been an international phenomenon as well as a national<br />
one and we doubt that any Australian government could have<br />
managed to isolate our economy from these international<br />
price movements. We believe that the general thrust of the<br />
government's policy responses has been in the best interests<br />
of the nation as a whole. More importantly, we seriously<br />
doubt that the previous government would have had the wisdom<br />
or the courage to undertake it. It had certainly given no<br />
indication of moving in that direction while it was in power,<br />
even though the need for such policies had become obvious.<br />
There can be no doubt that inflation would have been even<br />
more severe had the government not taken the steps outlined<br />
above. .2/ </p>
<p>We urge the public to carefully weigh these matters before<br />
making their decision on the 18th May. The letter which is<br />
being delivered to all the metropolitan morning papers today<br />
is signed by 130 professors and staff members, the first<br />
signature being Professor Trevor Swan, the Doyen of<br />
Economics at the Australian National University in this<br />
c ity where we are meeting and the it goes right through<br />
and the last signaturies are from Drs. Ironmonger and Sheehan<br />
of the Institute of Applied Economic Research, Melbourne, the<br />
Editor and the Assistant Editor of the Australian Economic<br />
Review. I noticed that in his address to you yesterday, Mr. Snedden<br />
had doubted that on the 2nd of December the people of<br />
Australia had voted for a change and~ doubted that they knew<br />
what they were doing when they voted the way they did. I<br />
would merely point out that the program which I put on behalf<br />
of the Australian Labor Party in the elections before the 2nd<br />
December 1972 had been developed openly over many years. It<br />
hadn't emerged from a war council the previous weekend. It<br />
hadn't been evolved behind closed doors three weeks befQre.<br />
It in fact had been in print in party documents for months<br />
and years before. It had been debated in public. It had been<br />
put up in the form of motions and amendments in both Houses<br />
of the national Parliament. It was well known, and there<br />
could have been no greater, longer opportunity for the<br />
Australian people to know what any political party would do<br />
if it received their support than was the case before we were<br />
elec -ted by the people with a comfortable majority in the<br />
House of Representatives on the 2nd December 1972. Now how<br />
have we tried to carry out our programs, the ones which we<br />
enunciated then? We have put through the Parliament a record<br />
number of bills. There has never been so active a Parliament<br />
as that which was dissolved three weeks ago. None of the<br />
legislation we introduced diverged from programs which we had<br />
published and debated before the people elected us to a majority<br />
in the House of Representatives. I'm told that in another<br />
speech last night on David Frost, Mr. Snedden said that he .3/ </p>
<p>would now accept all the legislation that went through<br />
except those bills which had been rejected in the Senate.<br />
Perhaps then, I can refer to some of those bills which<br />
had been rejected in the Senate so that one can see the<br />
difference in approach between the Government and the<br />
conservative coalition opposing it.<br />
One of the bills rejected by the Senate was the Trade<br />
Practices Bill. It followed up on suggestions which had<br />
been made by Liberal attorneys-general including Mr. Snedden<br />
himself. In particular, it wanted to ensure that companies<br />
could not by collusion fix prices between them. It also<br />
had an extensive code for customer protection. We have said<br />
we would introduce such legislation. We introduced it 9<br />
months ago. It came up for debate oh three occasions in<br />
the subsequent months in the Senate where it had been<br />
introduced first. On each of those three occasions, the<br />
Senate voted not even to debate the bill. Then there was<br />
the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill. It<br />
was an expansion of a bill which Sir John McEwen had been<br />
able to get through our predecessors over the oppositioh<br />
of many Liberal Ministers, including Mr. McMahon was was at<br />
that time the Treasurer. It was designed to give Australians<br />
the opportunity to stake out a claim for a share in basic<br />
industries. It was to prevent the takeover of those industries.<br />
It was to give the national government the resources to<br />
prevent a further erosion of Australian ownership and control<br />
in basic industries. That was rejected by the Senate. Then<br />
there was the Health Insurance legislation. There surely<br />
could have been no program which had been so widely discussed.<br />
It was discussed not only in the 1972 House of Representatives<br />
elections, but in the 1969 House of Representatives elections.<br />
It was discussed in the Senate elections in 1967 and 1970.<br />
Our legislation completely accords with the program which we<br />
outlined on so many occasions for the people. Then there is .4/ </p>
<p>the Petroleum and Minerals Authority legislation. That has<br />
been twice rejected by the Senate. It is designed to<br />
enable the taxpayers through a government instrumentality<br />
to take a share in the discovery of Australian natural<br />
resources and the development of them. It would give the<br />
opportunity for Australians through their own instrumentality<br />
to learn the scientific and economic basis of these basic<br />
industries, based on our natural resources. It follows<br />
legislation which was the means by which France and Italy<br />
and now Canada are taking a share in the discovery and the<br />
development of-their resources. It would avoid the situation<br />
which arose under our predecessors whereby 68.3% of our<br />
energy resources our oil, our natural gas, our uranium and<br />
our coal -are controlled from overseas. Add the metallic<br />
resources -the iron ore, the bauxite, copper, lead, the<br />
zinc, titanium, magnesium and so on and you still have<br />
controlled from overseas. It was a means of avoiding<br />
that overseas control becoming still more dominant. Twice<br />
rejected by the Senate.<br />
Then there are the electoral bills. In particular the<br />
bills which would have given votes for the Senate for the<br />
people enrolled in the two territories. We put the<br />
proposition at the last two House of Representatives<br />
elections I believe it's a proposition overwhelmingly<br />
supported in the two territories but the Liberals,<br />
Country Party take the attitude the Senate is a States<br />
House. And then there was the legislation unanimously<br />
recommended over 15 years ago that thca variation from the<br />
average en rolment from electorates in any State should not<br />
be more than 10%. You shouldn't have the present<br />
The 10% maximum variation was endorsed by Country Party as<br />
well as Liberal and Australian-Labor Party members of the<br />
Constitutional Review Committee set up by Sir Robert Menzies<br />
in 1956 reporting to the Parliament unanimously in 1958.<br />
The legislation was twice rejected by the Senate. Now there<br />
were other bills too, but I give those basic ones because<br />
many of them are bills upon which the Governor-General said<br />
the Parliament had become unworkable and therefore we were<br />
entitled to have an election for the whole of both Houses<br />
at the same time. </p>
<p>Now, that's what we've done by way of legislation, in<br />
carrying out oiir programs. Then, the rest of our programs-<br />
I pointed out to you when I last spoke to you would be<br />
based on expert advice. It was well known before we came<br />
in that there was not in the state public services or in<br />
the federal public service enough men and women who had been<br />
given the responsibility of investigating and recommending<br />
courses of action dealing with what were seen to be problems<br />
for the Australian people, but problems which could not be<br />
solved unless governments took some action about them. And<br />
I'm reminded that I said at the gathering like this before<br />
the elections in December 1972 the key channel for communication<br />
between the Parliament and the people will be a<br />
number of expert commissions making regular reports and<br />
recommendations on new spending. These bodies will not<br />
merely be exercises in more efficient, more expert<br />
administration of public affairs they will be an expression<br />
of our determination to keep the public informed and to keep<br />
the public involved in the public debate on the great<br />
national affairs and the great national decisions. We have<br />
been as good as our word. We have where we've been able<br />
to get the legislation through set up standing commissions.<br />
The chairman, sometimes also the deputy chairman, have been<br />
full time. But the rest of the men and women appointed to<br />
those commissions have been experts in state public services,<br />
universities and various professions and organisations. They<br />
have been happy to serve on these bodies knowing that whether<br />
the government accepted their recommendations or not the<br />
Parliament and thus the people would be told what the<br />
recommendations were. We've sought to end the situation<br />
where the government was regarded as the only body which was<br />
entitled to know what the experts recommended. And there<br />
was before we came in a very great disillusion among<br />
academics and heads of commerce and other organisations about<br />
the use that they could be to the public, particularly in<br />
advice given to governments. We have ended that suspicion,<br />
we have involved them, there have been scores as you know<br />
of professors and captains of industry and managing directors<br />
and directors who have and state public servants as well 6/ </p>
<p>as federal public servants who've been willing to be named<br />
and identified among those who were advising the national<br />
government. And in every case the report has been made<br />
promptly available. It's been made available usually<br />
before even the government has made up its mind upon them.<br />
And the consequence has been that if the government has<br />
differed or delayed on these reports, then the public was<br />
able to make a judgement and assessment itself. It's<br />
remarkable the extent to which there has been support for<br />
and acceptance of these reports. And the big initiatives<br />
we've taken in development of programs have been along<br />
these lines, that is the increases in government<br />
expenditure which we've undertaken have been on the basis<br />
of public reports by experts which the public have themselves<br />
received, and the cuts in public expenditure we've made,<br />
amounting to well over 400 million dollars a year, have been<br />
on the basis of such expert reports available to the public.<br />
Now people don't demur at what's in these reports they<br />
accept the facts. They acknowledge the validity of the<br />
recommendation. It doesn't stop them criticising us when<br />
we act upon them but in all these matters that we've clone<br />
-the public's known why we did it on whose advice we acted<br />
it's not been secret. It's not been delayed. It's been<br />
available promptly and fully and we believe by this process<br />
there's been a rational enquiry, rational development and<br />
rational allocation of our natural resources and our human<br />
resources such as no previous government has been willing<br />
to bring about. And even while this campaign's been going<br />
on there have been many such reports received. They're being<br />
printed and a summary of them has been published. Now let<br />
me mention some of them.<br />
There is Sir James Vernon's report on the post office, the<br />
biggest business in Australia but one which certainly needed<br />
a review and investigation. And now that it has been made<br />
available, Dr. Coombs will conduct the Royal Commission into<br />
the rest of the Public Service. There has been no enquiry<br />
into the Public Service in Australia for over 50 years.<br />
There has been in the United States, Canada, Britain, so<br />
many other countries but not here. We are the people who .7/ </p>
<p>haethought about it. Then there's been Sir Walter Scott's<br />
enquiry into government procurement. He pointed out the<br />
inefficiencies, the waste, which have been caused by the<br />
inherited system of purchase by the Australian Government.<br />
Then there's Professor Crisp's report on the collection of<br />
statistics and data. So often, departments and instrumentalities<br />
have collected information and kept it to themselves,<br />
not even given it to each other, still less the public. The<br />
report here has been received and published. And I recall<br />
the very significant ones that we've received previously.<br />
It was Mr. Rattigan's committee'which gave us the basis for<br />
the tariff cut across the board of 25%. It wag Sir John<br />
Crawford's report which led to the transformation, the<br />
strengthening, the widening of the tariff board into the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission. It's now Tom Fitzgerald's<br />
report which has made the public aware of the implications<br />
of mining policies which we inherited. There's Professor<br />
Karmel's various reports on the schools and on the open<br />
university and there could have been no greater increase<br />
in government expenditure on any subject than there has been<br />
flowing from Professor Karmel's report on the schools. We<br />
sdught it early, we published it immediately, we adopted it<br />
in full and the Liberals in fact voted against the application<br />
of the report twice, when it first came in both Houses and<br />
in both Houses again when the Country Party and DLP at last<br />
let it through. There's Professor Cochrane's report on adult<br />
training and retraining. There's Mr. Cangen' s report on<br />
technical education and further education and I conclude with<br />
Mr. Justice Woodward's concluding report on the Aborigines.<br />
Now, you will notice that these reports have been quite basic.<br />
There have been no such wide-ranging basic reports into our<br />
natural and human resources in the memory of anyone in this<br />
room and they are all promptly available to you and to the<br />
public. The only difficulty's been that after a dearth of<br />
information before we camne in you've now had a flood of<br />
information and we are accused of not letting the public<br />
know fully the implications of our programs. I acknowledge<br />
and I guess you, as practising journalists, would all<br />
acknowledge the difficulty of getting through the full text .8/ </p>
<p>8.<br />
and facts and reconiunendations disclosed and made by these<br />
expert bodies. But never let it be said that the public<br />
wasn't fully informed. They were told what our objectives<br />
were and when we have sought further advice they've been<br />
told what the advice was. And I suppose this applies<br />
particularly to the biggest new commitment that I've been<br />
able to make on behalf of the government during this<br />
campaign, and that is the commitment on the care and<br />
education of boys and girls under five years of age. When<br />
we came in, as I frankly admitted to you, and in my policy<br />
speech before the December 72 elections, there was not the<br />
information available in government circles state or<br />
federal. There was no coordination of the information<br />
between community groups and voluntary organisations. The<br />
people who knew about these things had never been asked<br />
for their views for the information, for the facts that<br />
they had, their views as to what should be done about it.<br />
We promptly asked a committee under Miss Joan Fry to make<br />
a report on it. We asked the Social Welfare Commission,<br />
under Mrs. Marie Coleman the first woman ever to be the<br />
head of an Australian government instrumentality or<br />
d~ partment we've asked the Priorities Review Staff in<br />
the Department of the Special Minister of State to review<br />
all these things, make recommendations and accordingly we<br />
4 now have a fuller program than has even been proposed<br />
before, for that 1,300,000 boys and girls under five<br />
as many people under five as there are over 65. We would<br />
never have ventured, surely, to neglect those 1.3 million<br />
people over 65 as we have the 1.3 million under five. And<br />
hundreds of thousands of them without anybody to look after<br />
them no parent throughout the working day. Well, of<br />
course it'll cost $ 130 million this coming financial year.<br />
It's a very clear contrast to our opponents who would be<br />
prepared to spend on this overall matter of day care and<br />
pre-schools, $ 20 million a year. We've spent $ 18 million<br />
in the last six months a big contrast. But you know why<br />
we're doing it. Everybody's told. Nobody knew before we<br />
collected the information and sought the advice. </p>
<p>Now I suppose you'd expect me to say something about the<br />
alternative package. I'm indebted to you for examining so<br />
many aspects of it. It ought to be enough for me to refer<br />
to some aspects myself. I gather there is to be in this<br />
alternative package, if the public bought it, an incomes<br />
and prices freeze. I must confess and I've devoted a great<br />
deal of attention to the proposals, I find no company, no<br />
organisation or employers or employees who is prepared to<br />
support it and every country which has tried it over the<br />
last year or so has now abandoned it. It was first started<br />
on President Nixon' s support idea, two and a half years ago<br />
in the United States, the Congress has at last abandoned it<br />
as counter-productive, but one would have thought that any<br />
effective freeze of prices would cover meat and fresh food.<br />
Now, as one of my opponents has said, it's impossible it<br />
may be possible to freeze meat and vegetables, but it's not<br />
possible to freeze the pric~ es of it, and I'm not reassured<br />
by my other opponent saying it can be done, it will be done.<br />
Well, I wish they would agree on how it'd be done and then<br />
of course there's the price of petrol the cat being let<br />
out of the bag, the tiger being let out of the tank, the'<br />
ESSO tank and the simple fact is that there is not a shred<br />
of evidence to say that oil exploration in Australia is more<br />
expensive or less profitable than in any other country in<br />
the world. The only thing that's happened is that other<br />
countries have usually put up their taxes and royalties very<br />
highly. But we haven't. There's no need whatever to increase<br />
the price of crude oil by 40% or any other percentage to<br />
continue to get what has already been discovered in Australia<br />
or to encourage people to go out and search further. If you<br />
can't have a limitation on prices of such things as meat and<br />
vegetables and fresh fruit, which everybody consumes, or the<br />
price of petrol, which everybody directly or indirectly is<br />
affected by, then it's very difficult to see how one can<br />
have any limitation on prices by that method at all. And<br />
then of course there's the freeze on incomes. I'm not impressed </p>
<p>by the constant assertion that somehow the Arbitration<br />
Commission's awards would be made inoperative. Now that<br />
word does not come from Tony Eggleton, I'm sure it comes<br />
from Ronald Ziegler, and the... but however impressive the<br />
word may be, however impressed you may be by such statements<br />
used in other circumstances, there is the fact that finally<br />
the High Court would decide. And the Chief Justice, Sir<br />
Garfield Barwick, said this in 1967 in the total wage case:<br />
" The Parliament is unable itself to legislate the level of<br />
wages to be paid, nor has it power to direct the Arbitrator<br />
as to the level of wages he shall prescribe in the settlement<br />
of a dispute as to wages." The constitutional power<br />
requires that settlement of the dispute be left to the<br />
arbitrator. I thought everybody knew that. I'm surprised<br />
at anybody aspiring to be Prime Minister of the country<br />
being ignorant of it or trying to conceal it. The fact is<br />
that the only way to exclude the Arbitration Commission,<br />
to make its awards inoperative, is to abolish it. As long<br />
as it exists then, under the Constitution, it has the<br />
authority to conciliate and arbitrate in the settlement<br />
of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any<br />
one State. If you abolish the machinery, then of course,<br />
like the inter-state commission, it can't exercise its<br />
constitutional responsibility. I don't believe the<br />
Australian public will support the idea of abolishing the<br />
Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Now,<br />
in all these matters I was not reassured by a statement<br />
Mr. Douglas Anthony issued today. " Mr. Snedden and I have<br />
had discussions to try to tie in all the loose ends and to<br />
look for weaknesses that probably exist." Now I would have<br />
thought that Mr. Anthony, who for twelve months has been<br />
urging the absolutely unprecedented and unprincipled course<br />
that a House of Representatives, recently elected, should<br />
be refused the money to carry on its program by a Senate<br />
half elected 3 years ago and half 6 years ago I'm<br />
surprised that he should have been urging this course so long<br />
without having been able to evolve an alternative program.<br />
Perhaps it's not so much to be wondered at that Mr. Snedden<br />
hadn't been able to do it. 11/ </p>
<p>But let me show in practice what has been done in some of<br />
these respects because the two Right Honourable Gentlemen<br />
have, in the past, had responsibility in fiscal and monetary<br />
matters let me deal with some of the monetary matters.<br />
There was, as you know, a very big dispute between them and<br />
their colleagues about the value of the dollar before<br />
Christmas 1971 and in that Holy Season there was an unholy<br />
row for three days and for three nights. And the wrong<br />
decision was made. Again there was a dispute as to the<br />
inflow of overseas funds on loan. And in consequence for<br />
the six months before we came in, the amount of money<br />
circulating in Australia rose by 17%, There was no<br />
equivalent increase in production. In fact there were a<br />
very great number of men and women out of work. Productivity<br />
increased by the money supply by 17% and the Treasury and<br />
the Reserve Bank had been urging them throughout the year to<br />
do something about the value of the dollar and the inflow of<br />
overseas funds. No legislation is required for those purposes.<br />
All that is required is an administrative decision. When we<br />
came in, promptly we examined the position, we accepted ' the<br />
advice and everybody, including all the leading economists in<br />
Australia, right up to today's letter, have endorsed what<br />
we've done. And none of the things we've done have earned<br />
many plaudits at the time. We have trodden on many toes,<br />
special interest groups, they resent it I feel, I hear, but<br />
undoubtedly the public has benefited from it. Now these<br />
were tough decisions. They were decisions which had been<br />
shirked by our predecessors, they were decisions which we<br />
had promptly made.<br />
I conclude with a reference which I gather Mr. Snedden made<br />
to you yesterday and which he-had also made in the Parliament,<br />
and I would have thought that he would have understood the<br />
situation better by now. Because, not only was he formerly<br />
a Treasurer and should have known some of these other matters 12/ </p>
<p>I quoted, but he was also an Attorney General and he stated<br />
as regards these referendums, that there was no need to<br />
carry the referendum to syncronise the elections for the<br />
two Houses, * but the fact that the elections for two<br />
Houses were being held at the one time, next Saturday,<br />
would automatically syncronise them. of course, the<br />
Constitution says that when there's been a double dissolution<br />
the term of the Senators will date from the 1st July<br />
preceding. The Constitution also says that Members of the<br />
House of Representatives can have three years term from<br />
the first meeting of their House. That means that as the<br />
Constitution stands, the Senators would have to come up for<br />
election before July 1976, somewhere in May 1976. The<br />
House of Representatives wouldn't have to face the people<br />
again until July 1977. Now not only does the Constitution<br />
say this, history bears it out, because after the last<br />
double dissolution in 1951, there was another Senate<br />
election in April 1953 and a House of Representatives<br />
election in April 1954. So that is a very clear example<br />
why that referendum should be carried. Because the next<br />
election should be, again, for both Houses at the same.<br />
time and that is what the first referendum is designed to<br />
achieve, and it was recommended back in 1958 by the-<br />
Constitution Review Committee appointed by Sir Robert<br />
in 1956. Now, I won't go through the other referendums<br />
there are equally valid reasons for all of them. Three<br />
of them date from recommendations dating from 1958, the<br />
fourth one, the local government one, dates from what I was<br />
saying to you before the last elections, what had been in<br />
the Party Platform before that. They're well known. Local<br />
government should be involved in the Australian national<br />
financial set up. Ratepayers alone cannot be expected to<br />
finance the things which federal and state governments and<br />
public services can't most appropriately supply, but which<br />
these days can be best supplied on a local basis, by the<br />
councils, community groups and voluntary organisations. .13/ </p>
<p>13.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I've said enough, I think, to illustrate the differences<br />
there are before the people next Saturday, and I believe<br />
that the government deserves their support because it<br />
has a complete program. It has stuck to that program.<br />
It's tried to keep faith with the people and we have<br />
made available to the people all the advice and the<br />
facts on the further developments of programs which we<br />
were committed to introduce. </p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />
QUESTION: Average weekly earnings for the March quarter<br />
will be coming out in about two weeks time. They're expected<br />
to show an increase in the past year of something like 17%.<br />
They won't reflect the increases from the National Wage Case<br />
or the GMH settlement or the Metal Trades Industries<br />
Settlement that took place recently. Would you expect to<br />
bump it up to something like 20 in the next two quarters.<br />
The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has pointed out<br />
that part of the reason for the increase is that the wage<br />
system at the moment is allowing large parts of the<br />
workforce to double up on the national increases that it's<br />
awarding. Now I was wondering whether you could tell us<br />
and it's called a conference, between the parties for the<br />
national wage case... I was wondering whether you could tell<br />
us what instructions representatives from a Federal Labor<br />
Government would have if they attended such a conference and<br />
whether you could be a little more explicit about the form<br />
your intervention would take in cases coming up before the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from the unions<br />
that you said could be ( unclear)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The attitude we would take before this<br />
conference this is the conference which the Arbitration<br />
Commission said in its judgment on the 1974 National Wage<br />
Case it would be holding in 6 months' time to consider to<br />
evolve a formula for relating the wages, the award payments<br />
which it set, to any increase in the cost of living. You<br />
know to bring about automatic regular cost of living<br />
adjustments. Is that the one you're referring to, Mr Bracken?<br />
Yes Well the attitude we would take before that conference<br />
would be in accordance with the brief on indexation which </p>
<p>-2-<br />
the Cabinet approved and which was put before the Commission<br />
during its hearing of that case. Half of the industrial<br />
disputes in Australia in the last year have been due to the<br />
fact that people have resorted to direct action to maintain<br />
the value of their award wages. And we believe that by<br />
having a regular adjustment of those wages and salaries<br />
every quarter or half-year whatever the Commission agreeswould<br />
reduce that sort of pressure. Quite apart from<br />
being a matter of elementary justice. The Commission's<br />
predecessor did adopt that from about 1921 to 1953. And the<br />
course neither promoted nor put a brake on inflation. The<br />
effect of it'was neutral. So that is the attitude we<br />
would take. I suppose the brief on indexation which the<br />
Department of Labour prepared and which the Cabinet endorsed<br />
for this recent case, would be reviewed. But nevertheless,<br />
that is the general attitude we would take at this conference,<br />
which you remember my colleague, Mr Clyde Cameron applauded<br />
when the Commission announced it in its judgement.<br />
QUESTION: The election campaign so far has been largely<br />
a contest between yourself and Mr Snedden. Has Mr Snedden<br />
performed better than you thought he would.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose hie had to.<br />
QUESTION: You referred at some length, during your speech<br />
to the fact that your government has released a number of<br />
reports on a number of matters. But I would like to point<br />
out that on a number of major questions, such as revaluation,<br />
tariff cuts, and the Coombs Report and a number of others;<br />
no reports were seen before the Government made its decisions.<br />
Now in cases like this, do you intend to continue making<br />
decisions without releasing the reports on major matters<br />
and only releasing reports on minor ones.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: T he Coombs Report was released on the<br />
same day as, and in company with, the Budget papers in<br />
August. It was considered in the preparation of the<br />
Budget four weeks before that. There were a very great<br />
number of budgetary implications in the Coombs Report. If </p>
<p>-3-<br />
we had released the Coombs Report before the Budget came<br />
in there would inevitably have been speculation as to what<br />
would be in the Budget. The Coomnbs Report was accepted in<br />
part, rejected in other parts and accepted with modifications<br />
in other parts again. So this was clearly a budgetary<br />
document. It was tabled with the budgetary documents.<br />
And so it doesn't come into the category of matters where<br />
you release a report before you have made a decision.<br />
Tariff Board reports, Industries Assistance Commission<br />
reports, as they now are, are released immediately unless<br />
the Commission itself recommends that the publication of<br />
the report would cause speculation. where it so recommends,<br />
and it hasn't in any of its reports up till now, we would<br />
not publish the reports until the Government's decision had<br />
been announced. But we have published all its reports up<br />
till now as soon as they have been able to be printed, even<br />
if the decision hadn't been made, because the Commission<br />
itself said there would not be speculation if those reports<br />
were published as soon as they could be printed.<br />
QUESTION: You were elected eighteen months ago partly on<br />
a promise of open government. And I can see that there has<br />
been a great deal more information available to the people<br />
in the various commissions you set up. However you were<br />
elected more specifically on a promise of a freedom of<br />
information act. This has not yet been forthcoming, some<br />
public servants might say that an intelligent politician<br />
breaks a stupid promise. However I note that the Queen<br />
renewed the promise in her speech last February. Sir, are<br />
you having difficulties in getting this bill out of the<br />
bureaucracy, are there difficulties in implementing a<br />
freedom of information act, have you as one of your close<br />
advisers said, and he is very close at the moment, been<br />
snowed by the public service.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I did undertake to introduce a freedom<br />
of information act. The Queen made the same promise when<br />
she opened the last session of the last Parliament, and the<br />
bill has been drafted. And in my policy speech on Monday<br />
fortnight I sta-ted we will proceed with our freedom of<br />
information act. We will also appoint a civil ombudsman and<br />
that is in the same general context,-we have already appointed </p>
<p>-4-<br />
a military ombudsman. I have instructed the Public<br />
Service Board they may have already done it to repeal<br />
the statutory rule 34B which makes it illegal for public<br />
servants to comment on these matters. It has been discussed<br />
between the Public Service organisations and the Public<br />
Service Board. And on the agreement between them, I have<br />
directed that the rule be abolished. The whole question<br />
of relations with the Public Service will be among the<br />
terms of reference of the Coombs' Royal Commission into the<br />
Public Service.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I hadn't intended to ask you<br />
this, but since you have just mentioned the point to us,<br />
the understanding of those organisations with which some<br />
of us are involved talking to the Public Service on<br />
Section 34B is that far from repealing it, they are<br />
devising a more complex, and in our view, no less<br />
restrictive form of words, than exists at present. Now<br />
if your understanding is that you have directed them to<br />
repeal it, would you remind them that that was the<br />
. intention.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No they are aware of it. I have told them<br />
that there are to be no guidelines which are more<br />
repressive than the regulation. The guidelines of course<br />
wouldn't have the force of law. They would be a gloss<br />
upon the provisions of the present act. But the regulations<br />
which made certain courses illegal, are to be repealed.<br />
I am told that the course I have directed to be taken, meets<br />
the wishes of the Public Service organisations which have<br />
been thrashed out in discussions with the Public Service<br />
Board. I am rather sorry that it has taken so long, but I<br />
am told that this is what they all wish now and so therefore,<br />
at the earliest moment, I have done it. But the Public<br />
Service Board, the public service organisations, all<br />
interested people, will certainly be welcome to give their<br />
views in writing and by word and through representatives, to<br />
the Royal Commission on the Public Service. </p>
<p>QUESTION: The formal structure fore pre-blection briefings<br />
with the public service for the Opposition, fell through.<br />
Do you intend to do anything about getting formal guidelines<br />
for those properly working well before another election<br />
and whether you are back in government, or whether you<br />
are in opposition, will you work for rather more contact<br />
with the public service for the opposition party during<br />
the time before an election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't understand your question at<br />
first, because I didn't realise you were referring to<br />
briefings of spokesmen for the Opposition on these matters<br />
during the run up to an election campaign. I made that<br />
undertaking, I honoured it. Mr Cooley, the Chairman of<br />
the Public Service Board, was immediately in touch with<br />
Mr Snedden. You know the subsequent correspondence. I am<br />
assured that what Mr Cooly offered to Mr Snedden was<br />
fully in accordance with the British practice which I<br />
undertook to apply in Australia. I have honoured my<br />
obligations. I think it is a proper course. I don't<br />
believe that any opposition should find itself in the<br />
situation that we did, where the Public Service Board<br />
had in fact sought permission from Mr McMahon to confer<br />
with me and my designated shadow ministers, on any changes<br />
in the case of a change of government and Mr McMahon wouldn't<br />
allow the discussions to take place. I said that such<br />
discussions should always take place. I might elaborate<br />
that the difficulty for other members of the opposition<br />
was that Mr Snedden would never designate who they would<br />
be with. You couldn't have half a dozen people discussing<br />
things with every permanent head of every department. But<br />
I was perfectly willing for any person that he designated<br />
as having the shadow responsibility for any department<br />
to confer with the head of that department. But he never<br />
designated any of them. He said he would nominate who<br />
would be his ministers, he has never done it. If you can't<br />
nominate who would be your Treasurer how can you nominate<br />
who the lesser ones would be. Mr Snedden could have had<br />
from the Public Service Board or from any permanent head<br />
the full facilities that any Leader of the Opposition has had<br />
in Britain. And I might point out that I have said that </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Mr Peacock for instance can be briefed by anybody in the<br />
Foreign Affairs Department. I have said that Mr Snedden<br />
can. And Mr Snedden has been fully briefed as to all<br />
internal or external security arrangements to which the<br />
Australia Government is a party. That is there is nothing<br />
that I have said should be withheld from an alternative<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
QUESTION: Has there been any contact between the Opposition<br />
and the public service during'the course of the Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been. For instance,<br />
Bill Hayden has done this with Mr Chipp, to give an instance<br />
I know. I have heard of no instanc3 where an opposition<br />
spokesman wanting to be briefed on a particular matter,<br />
hasn't been given that opportunity. I know of no instance<br />
where it has been refused.<br />
QUESTION: May I join you in quoting from the transcript<br />
of your address to the pre-1972 election Press Club Lunch<br />
in which you were asked, " will you publish Treasury's<br />
detailed economic forecasts" and you replied not in a<br />
referendum context " Yes, yes, yes, I would publish the<br />
Treasury's economic forecasts." You criticised Mr Bury<br />
for not having done so. And you said " I have been quite<br />
firm in not giving any undertakings to do things which I<br />
wasn't quite certain that an incoming government could do<br />
in the lifetime of the Parliament, elected on the 2nd of<br />
next month." Does this mean that you have not been<br />
successful yet in getting the Treasury's economic forecasts<br />
published and that you will do so in the life of the next<br />
Parliament? PRIME MINISTER: I still incline to the view that they<br />
should be published. But the contrary view is pressed upon<br />
me by the authors of these documents and I suppose I can<br />
su mmarise their view without injustice to them by saying<br />
that if what they forecast or advise is to become public<br />
property, they would be more reticient in what they write<br />
and advise. It is a point of view which I have to weigh<br />
carefully. But there are other advisers to me, I suppose </p>
<p>-7-<br />
there is no mystery about it Dr Coombs and Professor Gruen<br />
for instance, who believe that these should be published.<br />
That is my inclination, but the Parliament didn't go its<br />
full life as you know. I would certainly think that within<br />
3 years from the date I gave that undertaking, I will be able<br />
either to fulfil it or to acknowledge that in the light of<br />
further advice I don't believe I should honour it. But<br />
it is a worrying question. I can't be dogmatic about it.<br />
I'm still inclined to the view that these should be<br />
published but it's not easy to know what's done in other<br />
countries and to what extent. It's something that I want<br />
to discuss further on the spot with them. But I would<br />
think that well before 2 December 1975 I will be able to<br />
give you a clear reply to it.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday, one of your friends in the press<br />
gallery, suggested that you were in a position to make<br />
political capital out of the Victorian Liberal Attorney-<br />
General's granting a fiat to a group of citizens to<br />
challenge the legality of State aid. Could you tell Us<br />
how you can make political capital out of the fact that<br />
Mr Hartley is one of those people seeking to challenge the<br />
policies granting aid to independent schools and also that<br />
another was your appointee to the Schools Commission.<br />
I think Mrs Turner is associated with the D. O. G. S. in<br />
seeking to overturn what apparently is still the<br />
Government's policies.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've never discussed the matter with<br />
Mrs Turner. The fact is of course that she is one of<br />
the members of the Karmel Committee which was unanimous<br />
on these points. It maybe that the lady has changed her<br />
mind. The document was signed some time ago and I think<br />
by Mr Hartley and Mrs Turner and the other 30 odd signatories<br />
to it. But the point is that whatever their views might have<br />
been then or might be now, there could be no challenge in<br />
the High Court to this legislation unless a State Attorney-<br />
General gave his permission, gave his fiat, his let-it-bedone.<br />
For ten years D. O. G. S. and others have been seeking<br />
the permission of a State Attorney-General, Liberal or Labor,<br />
in every State, to allow a challenge to be made to </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Commonwealth legislation providing funds for Church<br />
schools. For ten years they have contacted every Attorney-<br />
General in every State of both sides of politics. And<br />
Mr Wilcox's predecessor or predecessors as Liberal<br />
Attorneys-General in Victoria over the last ten years<br />
always refused their permission, their fiat. Mr Wilcox<br />
has granted his. So whatever may be the view now or<br />
then of Mrs Turner and Mr Hartley and the other estimable<br />
signatories, the fact is that however many signed it,<br />
whatever there were, whatever they said, it would never<br />
have got to the High Court but for an Attorney-General<br />
having at loast been found after ten years, to give his<br />
permission for it to be taken to the High Court. Now<br />
in these circumstances it is regretable that the hundreds<br />
of thousands of dollars will have to spent out of our<br />
taxes in resisting such a claim in the High Court. The<br />
challenge would never have got there but for a State<br />
Attorney-General having given his permission. And it<br />
happens to be the Liberal Attorney-General of the State<br />
of Victoria.<br />
QUESTION: I would like to move from Australia to<br />
Foreign Affairs. Would your government if returned press<br />
nations on the litoral of the Indian Ocean to regard the<br />
re-opened Suez Canal as a non-military area.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: All nations, around the shores of the<br />
Indian Ocean and on all the islands in it, want the Indian<br />
Ocean to be kept free of great power rivalry. I can't<br />
speak for the government of South Africa, I don't think<br />
it has expressed a view on it, I am not aware of it. But<br />
it is certain that every other nation in and around the<br />
Indian Ocean seeks to keep the great power rivalry out of<br />
it. They don't want the Soviet Union and the United States<br />
to escalate their rivalry in the Indian Ocean. And the<br />
re-opening of the Suez Canal would of course facilitate<br />
the passage of the very large fleets of the two super powers,<br />
from the Mediteranean into the Indian Ocean. Certainly as<br />
I understand it, they all want the Suez Canal re-opened,<br />
but they don't want the present naval activity to be<br />
escalated. Every one of them is unaninous in that regard. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
And we have co-operated with them in the relevant<br />
United Nations Committees.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday you told us that your government<br />
would not increase direct or indirect taxes in the next<br />
budget. Was this a decision made in consultation with<br />
Mr Crean and also, does it mean that if taxation scales<br />
are restructured that the high income earner will also<br />
be excluded from taxation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hadn't had a specific discussion<br />
with Mr Crean before I attended that particular press<br />
conference at least I know who my Treasurer will be<br />
before I hold press conferences but his general view is<br />
the same as mine that there is no need to have an overall<br />
increase in direct taxation or an overall increase in<br />
indirect taxation in order to fulfil the programs which<br />
we've initiated, both those which are under way and those<br />
which we are about to launch. There are of course, very<br />
many more men and women working and productivity increased<br />
by 6 percent last year as against 2 per cent in the<br />
previous year, 1972. And as I said in the Policy Speech<br />
in November 1972, we believe that our programs can be<br />
financed from increases in productivity rather than<br />
increases in taxation. So I make the overall assessment<br />
as to direct and indirect taxation. Now as regards direct<br />
taxation, in particular, I have mentioned the restructuring<br />
of the tax scales it's a term I used in November 1972 and it's<br />
a term I used last month. I've used it on both occasions<br />
and it's the term I repeat now. And I've spoken on both<br />
occasions in the context of the committee of inquiry into<br />
taxation under Mr Justice Asprey, which Mr Snedden appointed<br />
in September 1972. We supported the appointment of it and<br />
Mr Crean and I have discussed these matters with<br />
Mr Justice Asprey I myself of course have known him, oh<br />
I suppose for well over thirty years and with members of<br />
that committee. We haven't of course sought to know what<br />
its recommendations will be, but we have asked that the<br />
recommendations'be in our hands by 1 June that will give<br />
us plenty of time to discuss the matters before we have our<br />
Cabinet meeting on the Budget in August, which will be about </p>
<p>4 weeks before we introduce the Budget in September. The<br />
only suggestion that we've made to the Asprey Committee<br />
which is not in its terms of reference as settled by<br />
Mr Snedden is that it should consider taxation discrimination<br />
against women. There was no such reference in its terms<br />
of reference, we think there should be and we believe<br />
that it will take that into account when it makes<br />
recommendations on the whole range of matters. We have<br />
not pre-empted the findings of this very expert committee.<br />
QUESTION: In your first Budget you had a 20 percent<br />
increase in government spending, you increased indirect<br />
taxation and you had a deficit budget. How would you<br />
have in your 1974/ 75 budget tax cuts, and a 20 percent<br />
increase in government spending and how would be balance<br />
the budget or bing down a surplus budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We might be in balance this year.<br />
There's about seven weeks to go before the final accounts<br />
for the year come in. We did budget for a deficit this<br />
year but in fact we mightn't have a deficit. We might be<br />
in balance this year, but as I believe that every economist<br />
would advise in times when there is inflation, it is<br />
inflationary to budget for a deficit, and we would therefore<br />
expect to balance our budget or even, if other commitments<br />
could still be met, to have a surplus budget this year.<br />
Now your reference about a 20 percent increase. I take it<br />
you are making a selective quotation from what was said<br />
by me on Frost which you'll all be watching tonight.<br />
Now perhaps I could get the quotation from this here just<br />
to put in in full context. Mr Snedden apparently has given<br />
Mr Frost some question to ask me, and one was about this<br />
business with Syntec Newsletter, the people who brief<br />
Mr Malcolm Fraser about whom Mr Snedden has at least said<br />
he won't be Treasurer. Now, Mr Frost asked me: " would<br />
there be an expansion needed by less than 40 percent but<br />
more than zero" and I said yes. " What would you guess it<br />
was" " midway, midway around 20 percent. Off hand I'd say<br />
that, obviously there would be that amount in some fields<br />
and less than that in others." " But the average would average<br />
out at about 20 percent maybe, but'I wouldn't think any more </p>
<p>-11-<br />
than that." I should make it plain that the expenditure<br />
by governments in the last year in Australia has not gone<br />
up by as high a percentage as the expenditure by<br />
individuals and companies. Government expenditure is<br />
not rising by the overall national percentage.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, in answer to the first question that<br />
was asked today by Warrick Bracken, you said that the use<br />
of the cost of living adjustment or indexation of wages<br />
had neither promoted nor put a break on inflation, that<br />
means it's useless as I've said. What then, in view of<br />
your assessment of the uselessness of indexation as a<br />
measure against wage cost inflation, do you propose to<br />
control the problem which Warrick Bracken referred to,<br />
of 20 percent and above increases in the wage costs<br />
that are in prospect?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You would not be correct in taking<br />
it that I said it would be useless. What I did say is,<br />
it would bring justice to the mean and women working under<br />
the awards of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission, I also said it would promote harmony in<br />
industry. It would do both those things.<br />
QUESTION: But you were saying it would be useless as an<br />
economic tool against inflation, I take it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not saying one does it in the<br />
context of inflation at all. It is neutral in its effect<br />
on inflation. May I repeat again so you can take it<br />
correctly. It will lead to justice for the mean and women<br />
working under federal awardsand it will bring about harmony<br />
in industry. Both are worthy objectives. It was for those<br />
reasons that we sought indexation from the Commission in<br />
the 1974 National Wage Case, it is for those reasons that<br />
the Commission, for the first time for twenty years, decided<br />
to consider the matter. It will do so within six months<br />
we will promote that conference. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
QUESTION: I was going to ask you about housing but last<br />
night down at Chelsea Town Hall, you said that you would,<br />
the Labor Party could, get Issacs, Henty, Deaking and even<br />
Flinders and Bruce. Mr Hawke said earlier this week that<br />
the Labor Party could win by 20 seats. Mr Snedden said<br />
last week that he could win by 15. Are you prepared to<br />
give us a prediction now and if not could you tell us<br />
what your views are on the wisdom of political leaders<br />
making such forecasts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm much more in agreement with Mr Hawke<br />
than with Mr Snedden. I don't necessarily volunteer these<br />
matters, but if I'm asked a question, of course I give a<br />
civil reply and I believe a sensible one. I'm going to<br />
treat you bush lawyers with respect. You're all the members<br />
of the same rat pack as far as I'm concerned. I wish I<br />
had the same freedom to pontificate as you have. Now<br />
I want utter silence while I give this answer. You ought<br />
to bring your wives and companions round during the trip<br />
you know, it makes you much more agreeable. This has been<br />
the most unharried, harmonious meal we've been able to<br />
have for over a fortnight.........<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The choice on Saturday is between a<br />
confused and divided Opposition and a strong, united<br />
Government. It's between an Opposition confused and<br />
divided on inflation and a government which has shown it<br />
can take tough courses of action to cure inflation. Its<br />
between an Opposition whose policies brought about<br />
inflation and a Government whose policies have produced<br />
the biggest drop in the rate of inflation during the<br />
March quarter of any of the worlds large industrial and<br />
trading nations. Its between an Opposition pledged to<br />
the sell out of Australian resources and a government<br />
pledged to preserve and promote Australian ownership.<br />
Its between an Opposition committed to cut back schools<br />
expenditure by $ 300 million a year and a government that<br />
has opened wide the door to new educational opportunities<br />
for all Australian children. Its between an Opposition<br />
representing rich sectional interests and a government </p>
<p>-13-<br />
representing all the people. Its between turning back<br />
and moving forward. I believe the Australian people will<br />
move forward. Forward to a brighter and better future. </p>
