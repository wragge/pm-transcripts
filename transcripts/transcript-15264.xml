<p>Since December 27, 2002, when the National Security Hotline was activated, it has received more than 96,000 calls. </p>
<p>The number of calls increases whenever an incident occurs. Sometimes people are simply seeking re-assurance, sometimes looking for information, and critically, sometimes they are passing on information. </p>
<p>There is no doubt the Hotline - 1800 123 400 - has become a valuable tool in the fight against terrorism. </p>
<p>Not everybody remembers that number, but people certainly know it exists because they ring directory assistance to ask for it, particularly in the wake of widely publicised incidents. </p>
<p>Calls to the Hotline, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, are answered by trained operators.  Reports from the public are passed on to relevant police or security. </p>
<p>About half the calls received by the Hotline are referred to the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, and relevant State or Territory police. </p>
<p>We cannot guarantee there will never be a terrorist attack on Australian soil. </p>
<p>No one can ever do that. </p>
<p>But we are doing everything in our power to try to prevent one occurring, and we rely critically on ordinary Australians to help us in that very important task. </p>
